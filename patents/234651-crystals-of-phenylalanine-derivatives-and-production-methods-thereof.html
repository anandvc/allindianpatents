Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention<br>
The definitions or examples in the present specification are indicated as follows.<br>
"The compound of the formula CD" is described in Example 196 of Patent Literature 1.<br><br>
"Crystal" mean a solid substance that gives a characteristic diffraction diagram in the powder X-ray analysis and usually means crystals or crystalline solids. Further, the mixtures of crystals and amorphous are acceptable. In such a case, the crystals may be contained in the substantial ratio.<br>
"The α-type crystal" means the crystal wherein the peaks exist at the diffraction angles (2 0) of 6.2, 10.2, 10.7, 10.8, 14.0, 14.4, 16.0, 16.2 and 21.7 in the powder X-ray diffraction pattern. Particularly, it means the crystal wherein the peaks exist at the diffraction angles (2 0) of 10.7, 10.8, 14.0, 16.2 and 21.7.<br>
"The T -type crystal" means the crystal wherein the peaks exist at the diffraction angles (2 0) of 7.2, 8.1, 10.3, 10.9, 14.5, 15.1, 16.4, 17.3, 18.3, 19.4, and 23.3 in the powder X-ray diffraction pattern.<br>

Particularly, it means the crystal wherein the peaks exist at the diffraction angles (2 0) of 11.5, 13.9, 18.5,    20.0 and 21.0.<br>
In the production methods of the present invention, in addition to using amorphous or noncrystalline solids as the compound (I), the raw material, the amorphous or noncrystalline solids may be used to once prepare crystals, and then other crystals may be produced using the obtained crystals in accordance with the other production methods of the present invention.<br>
The used crystallization processes include, for example, the crystallization by<br><br>
cooling, the crystallization with a poor solvent(s), the crystallization by suspension, the crystallization by neutralization, and the crystallization by concentration. Any process can be conducted if the subject compound is dissolved or suspended to a crystallizing solvent(s) to crystallize. In the crystallization, a seed crystal(s) is preferably added to the mixture. Meanwhile, the crystallization by cooling and the crystallization with a poor solvent(s) may be combined together.<br>
The crystallizing solvents are those that are usually known as usable crystallizing solvents. They may be one kind or a mixed solvent(s) of several crystallizing solvents.<br>
As for the mixed solvents of the several crystallizing solvents, it is possible to use the mixed solvent(s) wherein the solvent that dissolves the subject compound well (a good solvent) and the solvent that is soluble in the good solvent but hardly dissolves the subject compound (a poor solvent) are mixed in suitable quantities. It is also possible to use several solvents as the good solvent and those as the poor solvent. In that case, it is preferable that they equally intermingle with each other.<br>
The solvents that dissolve the subject compound (the compound of the formula (I)) well can be used as "the good solvents." They include acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, acetone, chloroform, dichloromethane, dimethylformamide, formamide, and dimethylsulfoxide.<br>
The solvents that are soluble in the above good solvents but hardly dissolve the subject compound (the compound of the formula (I)) can be used as "the poor solvents." They include water; alcohols such as methanol, ethanol and octanol; ethers such as diethylether; esters of acetic acids such as ethyl acetate; and hydrocarbons such as toluene, cyclohexane and hexane.<br>
In case of the crystallization by cooling, the key is to once dissolve the<br><br>
compound in the good solvent(s), the mixed solvent(s) of the good solvents, or the mixed solvent(s) of the good solvent(s) and the poor solvent(s), and then to cool down the mixture to precipitate the crystals of the subject compound. In order to once dissolve it, heating is preferable and the heating temperature is within the range from 30°C to around the boiling point of the solvent.<br>
For example, when precipitating the a -type crystal, it is preferable to dissolve the compound of the formula (I) in a good solvent(s) containing at least one kind selected from acetonitrile, dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran, acetone, dimethylsulfoxide and chloroform, or in a mixed solvent of acetonitrile-water, or in a mixed solvent of acetonitrile-dimethylformamide; and then cool down the mixture to 0 to 30°C and more preferably 4 to 25°C to crystallize.<br>
In the above, the volume ratio of acetonitrile in the mixed solvent of acetonitrile-water is preferably within the range from 50 to less than 100v/v%, and more preferably from 80 to 99v/v%.<br>
When precipitating the a -type crystal, it is preferable to dissolve the compound of the formula (I) in dimethylformamide and then cool down the mixture to 0 to 30°C and more preferably 4 to 25°C to crystallize.<br>
In case of the crystallization with a poor solvent(s), the key is the selection of the good solvents and the poor solvents or the used quantities thereof. The crystals of the subject compound are precipitated by adding the poor solvent(s) to the good solvent(s). As for the selection of the used solvents or the used quantities thereof, the most suitable condition can be selected by the experiments on solubility.<br>
For example, when precipitating the a -type crystal, it is preferable to dissolve the compound of the formula (I) in a good solvent(s) and then adding a poor solvent(s) thereto to crystallize, wherein the combination of the good solvent(s) and the poor solvent(s) is either one of dimethylsulfoxide-toluene,<br><br>
dimethylformamide-diethylether,	dimethylformamide-toluene,<br>
chloroform-ethanol,	chloroform-toluene,	chloroform ■ diethylether,<br>
dichloromethane-diethylether,	tetrahydrofuran-water,<br>
tetrahydrofuran-cyclohexane,	acetone-water,	acetonitrile-water	or<br>
dimethylformamide-acetonitrile. In these combinations, the good solvent(s)/the poor solvent(s) is preferably used in 1/20 to 5/1 (volume ratio).<br>
Meanwhile, depending on the combinations of the good solvents, the above includes addition of the other good solvent(s) to the above good solvent(s) to precipitate the crystals of the subject compound.<br>
For instance, when precipitating the α-type crystal, it includes the method comprising the steps of dissolving the compound of the formula (I) in dimethylformamide under heating (e.g. 30 to 80°C); adding dropwise 1 to 20 times volume and more preferably 2 to 8 times volume of acetonitrile to the dissolution solution at 0 to 80°C to crystallize.<br>
When precipitating the y "type crystal, it is preferable to dissolve the compound of the formula (I) in a good solvent(s) and then add a poor solvent(s) thereto to crystallize, wherein the combination of the good solvent(s) and the poor solvent(s) is dimethylformamide-water. In this case, dimethylformamide/water is preferably used in 50/1 to 1000/1 (volume ratio).<br>
Besides, when precipitating the £ "type crystal, it is preferable to dissolve the compound of the formula (I) in a good solvent(s) and then add a poor solvent(s) thereto to crystallize, wherein the combination of the good solvent(s) and the poor solvent(s) is either one of dichloromethane-ethanol or dimethylsulfoxide-diethylether. In these combinations, the good solvent(s)/the poor solvent(s) is preferably used in 1/5 to 1/2 (volume ratio).<br>
The crystallization by suspension includes the method which comprises the steps of- suspending the compound of the formula (I) in either one of acetonitrile,<br><br>
a mixed solvent of acetonitrile-water, or a mixed solvent of acetonitrile-dimethylformamide; and stir the mixture to crystallize. In case of using the mixed solvent(s), acetonitrile-water or acetonitrile-dimethylformamide is preferably used in 50/50 to 95/5 (volume ratio).<br>
When obtaining the a -type crystal, in case of using acetonitrile-water (90/10- volume ratio) as a suspending solvent, it is preferable to suspend the amorphous or the crystals (here, the crystals mean various crystal forms) of the compound of the formula (I) in the solvent, stir the mixture at 0 to 30°C and isolate the crystals at 0 to 30°C (e.g. at room temperature) by filtering out. At that time, the subject a -type crystal may be seeded at 0 to 30°C.<br>
Further, when obtaining the a-type crystal, it is preferable to suspend the amorphous or the crystals (here, the crystals mean various crystal forms) of the compound of the formula (I) at 0 to 40 °C (e.g. at room temperature) in acetonitrile-dimethylformamide (80/20: volume ratio), stir the mixture at 0 to 40°C and isolate the crystals at 0 to 40°C (e.g. at room temperature) by filtering out.   At that time, the subject a -type crystal may be seeded at 0 to 40°C.<br>
On the other hand, when obtaining the α-type crystal, in case of using acetonitrile-water (90/10) volume ratio) as a suspending solvent, it is preferable to suspend the amorphous or the crystals (here, the crystals mean various crystal forms) of the compound of the formula (I) in the solvent, stir the mixture at 40°C or higher (e.g. 60°C) and isolate the precipitated crystals at 40°C or higher (e.g. 60°C) by filtering out. In such a case, the maximum temperature is preferably the boiling point of the solvent or that of the mixed solvent or lower than it. At that time, the subject  θ-type crystal may be seeded at 40 to 60°C.<br>
Besides, when obtaining the θ-type crystal, it is preferable to suspend the amorphous or the crystals (here, the crystals mean various crystal forms) of the compound of the formula (I) in acetonitrile-dimethylformamide (80/20: volume<br><br>
ratio), stir the mixture at 50°C or higher (e.g. 60°C) and isolate the precipitated crystals at 50°C or higher (e.g. 60°C) by filtering out. In such a case, the maximum temperature is preferably the boiling point of the solvent or that of the mixed solvent or lower than it. At that time, the subject α-type crystal may be seeded at 50 to 60°C.<br>
The intersection of the saturation solubility curves of the a -type crystal and the 9 "type crystal to each solvent system exists at around 30 to 40 °C in acetonitrile-water (90/10: volume ratio) and around 40 to 50 °C in acetonitrile-dimethylformamide (80/20 - volume ratio). At around these temperatures, the mixture of the a -type crystal and the α-type crystal is obtained.<br>
The crystallization by neutralization includes the method comprising the steps of dissolving the compound of the formula (I) or a hydrochloride of the compound of the formula (I) in a lower alcohol solution containing hydrogen chloride! and then neutralizing the mixture with a base(s) to crystallize.<br>
The bases include inorganic bases such as sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide and organic bases such as triethylamine.<br>
The alcohol solutions having 1 to 6 carbon atoms include methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, pentanol and hexanol. Methanol and ethanol are preferable among them.<br>
The crystals of the present invention are useful in the points that they are the crystals excellent in "preservation stability" or "moisture resistance" of drug substances or preparations; and those that can be produced on the industrial scale.<br>
Especially, since the θ-type crystal is thermodynamically most stable under room temperature, it can be easily isolated under room temperature and has low hygroscopicity.     Since the   α-type crystal is thermodynamically most stable<br><br>
under high temperature (50°C or higher), it can be easily isolated under high temperature (50°C or higher). The 7] -type crystal is also thermodynamically stable and they-type and S -type crystals are useful in the point of their low hygroscopicity.<br>
All of the a -type,γ-type, ε-type, η -type and θ -type crystals can be produced on the industrial scale. Particularly, the α-type and θ-type crystals are preferable in terms of the production on the industrial scale.<br>
The present invention will be further illustrated as follows.    The following Examples will illustrate the production examples of the crystals of the present invention.   They only explain the present invention and do not particularly limit the invention. Examples<br>

(Test Examples)<br>
Test Examples will further illustrate the effects of the present invention.<br>
The   thermodynamically   stable   crystal   forms   were   confirmed  by   Test Examples 1 and 2.    Similarly, the crystal forms having low hygroscopicity were confirmed by Test Example 3. (Test Example l) Differential scanning calorimetry- DSC<br>
(1)	The measuring method and conditions<br>
1 to 7mg of the samples of each of the above obtained crystal forms (a -type, γ-type, ε-type and η-type) were weighed and sealed in the aluminum pan. Then, DSC was conducted in the following conditions.<br>
Reference-         An empty aluminum pan<br>
Scan Speed:       10°C/min.<br>
Sampling time- 0.2 sec.<br>
Range:	50 to 350°C<br>
(2)	The measurement results<br><br>
Figure 8 shows the DSC patterns of the α-type, y "type, ε-type and r\ "type crystals.<br>
It was observed by DSC that all of the a -type,  γ-type,  γ-type and  η-type crystals have the endothermic peak at around 265°C.    The measurement of the melting points by the visual observation determined the each melting point of the a -type, γ-type,  ε-type and η -type crystals at around 257 to 264°C. (Test Example 2)<br>

(1)	The measuring method and conditions<br>
The measurement was conducted in the same conditions as those of the above measurement of the powder X-ray diffraction patterns.<br>
Meanwhile, in order to change the temperature, the desired temperature was set by the temperature control unit.<br>
(2)	The measurement results<br>
Figure 9 shows the temperature changes of the powder X-ray diffraction patterns of the  γ-type,  γ-type,  ε-type and η -type crystals.<br>
All of the γ-type, γ-type, ε-type and η -type crystal forms changed to new crystal form patterns (corresponding to the θ-type crystal in the present specification) on the high temperature side by the temperature change. It was thought that the reason why all of the crystal forms had the melting point at around 265°C in Test Example 1 was the melting point of the  θ-type crystal.<br>
The transition temperature from the α-type crystal to the α-type crystal was seen at 230°C or higher and 250°C or lower; that from the γ-type crystal to the θ-type crystal was seen at 160°C or higher and 200°C or lower; that from the ε-type crystal to the θ-type crystal was seen at 150°C or higher and 200°C or lower; and that from the  7] -type crystal to the  θ -type crystal was seen<br><br>
at 210°C or higher and 230°C or lower.<br>
The T-G curves (T- temperature [°C], G: the relative value of Gibbs free energy) of the a -type,γ-type, ε -type, η -type and θ-type crystals were indicated from the above results (refer to Figure 10).<br>
From Figure 10, it is thought that the thermodynamically stable crystal form at room temperature is the α-type crystal and α-type &gt;  η -type &gt;  7'type &gt;ε-type &gt;  θ-type in that order.   Meanwhile, when the crystal transition occurs in high temperature range, it is thought that the  θ-type crystal is generated and stably exists. (Test Example 3)<br>
The measuring method of the water adsorption of the crystals (creation of the vapor adsorption isotherm)<br>
(1)	The measuring method of water adsorption amount and conditions<br>
l00mg of each of the above obtained α-type, γ-type and ε-type crystals were weighed and vacuum dried at 50°C overnight. Then, under the constant temperature of 25°C, the water adsorption amount of the crystals was determined with a full automatic vapor adsorption measuring apparatus (BELSORP-18, BEL Japan, Inc.) (Mitsuiki et al., J. Agric. Food Chem., Vol. 46, No.9, Page 3528*34, 1998).<br>
(2)	The measurement results<br>
Figure 11 shows the vapor adsorption isotherm of the α-type, /-type and ε-type crystals (The horizontal axis indicates the relative humidity [%]/100; and the vertical axis indicates the water adsorption amount [%].)<br>
All of the α-type, α-type and ε-type crystals have the water adsorption amount of 2% or lower even in the relative humidity of 100%. Therefore, it is seen that they have low water adsorption and the ε-type andγ-type crystals have particularly low water adsorption.<br><br>
For reference, Figure 12 shows the vapor adsorption isotherm of the T\ "type crystal (The horizontal axis indicates the relative humidity [%]/10(K and the vertical axis indicates the water adsorption amount [%].)<br>
