DESCRIPTION<br>
CABLE PLUG FOR A COAXIAL CABLE AND METHOD<br>
FOR FITTING SUCH A CABLE PLUG<br>
5<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to the field of plug-in<br>
connector technology for coaxial cables. It relates to<br>
1	0  a cable plug for a coaxial cable in accordance with the<br>
precharacterizing clause of claim 1 and to a method for<br>
fitting such a cable plug.<br>
A cable plug of the type mentioned at the outset is<br>
15  known, for example, from the document EP-A2-0 901 200.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Coaxial cables, as are used nowadays, for example, in<br>
2	0  the sector of base stations of mobile radio networks,<br>
have, in a concentric arrangement, an inner conductor<br>
and an outer conductor, which are insulated from one<br>
another by a dielectric lying there between. The outer<br>
conductor is generally surrounded by a protective outer<br>
25 sheath consisting of plastic. The outer conductor of a<br>
coaxial cable can be in the form of metallic braiding<br>
(at frequencies which are not; too high) . However, it<br>
can also be in the form of a continuous tube. If an<br>
increased flexibility of the ■ cable is not required, the<br>
30 tube of the outer conductor may have smooth walls. In<br>
order to achieve increased flexibility, corrugated<br>
tubes or hoses consisting of metal are generally used<br>
as the outer conductor, it being possible for the<br>
corrugations  to  either  be  separated  annularly  or<br>
35  continuously helical.<br>
In many cases it is desirable to provide detachable<br>
connections for such coaxial cables in order to<br>
simplify fitting and maintenance. For this purpose,  a<br><br>
WO 2006/047907	- 2 -	PCT/CH2005/000662<br>
large number of cable plugs have been developed and<br>
proposed in the past which differ from one another in<br>
terms of cable type and fixing concept. In principle,<br>
such a cable plug needs to fulfill the following<br>
5  requirements:<br>
•	The cable plug needs to produce good electrical<br>
contact between the plug housing, which generally<br>
forms the outer conductor within the plug,  and<br>
the outer conductor of the cable.<br>
10 • The cable plug needs to ensure a mechanical<br>
connection having a high tensile strength between<br>
the plug housing and the outer conductor of the<br>
cable in order to ensure that the plug-in<br>
connection  can  be  subjected  to  a  sufficient<br>
15       mechanical load.<br>
•	The  cable  plug,  in  particular  if  the  plug-in<br>
connection - as in the case of base stations - is<br>
subjected  to  weathering  influences ,  needs  to<br>
adjoin the outer sheath of the coaxial cable in a<br>
2	0        sealing manner in order to prevent the ingress of<br>
moisture,  dirt  and  other  influences	on  the<br>
interior of the cable.<br>
•	Other,  constant requirements relate to	a simple<br>
design,  fitting which is as simple as	possible<br>
25        and cost-effective manufacture and storage.<br>
A known cable plug by the Applicant which is suitable<br>
in particular for coaxial cables having an outer<br>
conductor with annular corrugations is illustrated in<br>
30  longitudinal section in figure 1. The cable plug 10 has<br>
a housing 18, which acts as the outer conductor and in<br>
which an inner conductor 16 is held concentrically and<br>
in electrically insulated fashion by means of an<br>
insulator 15. A union nut 11 is fitted such that it can<br>
35 be rotated on the plug-in side end on the housing 18 by<br>
means of a snap ring 13, with which union nut the cable<br>
plug 10, once it has been inserted into a corresponding<br>
female connector, can be screwed to the female<br>
connector. For guidance purposes during the insertion,<br><br>
WO 2006/047907	- 3 -	PCT/CH2005/000662<br>
an annular insert 14 is provided around which a seal 12<br>
is arranged. On the cable side of the cable plug 10,<br>
the inner conductor 16 merges with a seal 21, which<br>
rests in an inner conductor 19 and produces the<br>
5 electrical contact with the inner conductor of the<br>
coaxial cable (not illustrated). The cable-side screw<br>
connection, which is used for contact-making, retaining<br>
and sealing purposes, comprises a large number of<br>
different parts:  in order to make contact with and<br>
10 retain the outer conductor of the coaxial cable, a<br>
contact sleeve 2 4 is provided which is split into<br>
individual, radially sprung tongues by axially running<br>
slits 23 arranged distributed over the circumference.<br>
The contact sleeve 2 4 has, on the plug-in side, an edge<br>
15 which thickens in the form of a bead inwards and with<br>
which the contact sleeve 24 bears against a<br>
circumferential projection 22 shaped in the interior of<br>
the housing 18. A flanged edge of the outer conductor<br>
of the cable is clamped in between the bead-shaped edge<br>
20 of the contact sleeve 24 and the projection 22 during<br>
fitting in order to produce the electrical contact<br>
between the housing 18 and the outer conductor and to<br>
mechanically fix the cable. The fixing of the outer<br>
conductor is illustrated in detail, for example, in the<br>
25 figures of the document mentioned at the outset<br>
EP-A2-0 901 200.<br>
The contact ring 2 4  is pressed in clamping fashion<br>
against the projection 22 by means of a first hollow<br>
30 screw 20, which can be screwed into the housing 18. At<br>
the same time, in order to provide sealing between the<br>
first hollow screw 20 and the housing 18, an inner seal<br>
17 is compressed. In order to provide sealing between<br>
the first hollow screw 2 0 and the outer conductor of<br>
35 the cable, a further seal 25 is provided which<br>
surrounds the outer conductor and is pressed radially<br>
inwards against the outer conductor by being compressed<br>
axially by means of a further hollow screw 26. Finally,<br>
a further seal 17'  is provided in the second hollow<br><br>
WO 2006/047907	- 4 -	PCT/CH2005/000662<br>
screw 2 6, which further seal 17' provides sealing with<br>
respect to the outer sheath of the cable.<br>
Owing to the various screw connections and seals, the<br>
5 design and • fitting of the known cable plug shown in<br>
figure 1 are complicated and laborious. One of the<br>
reasons for these disadvantages can be found in the<br>
contact sleeve 24: the contact sleeve 24 could in<br>
principle, if it were to be in the form of a sleeve<br>
10 without slits, press the flanged edge of the cable<br>
outer conductor against the projection 22 uniformly<br>
over the entire circumference and therefore not only<br>
produce the necessary electrical and mechanical contact<br>
but at the same time also take on the sealing function<br>
15 for the outer conductor with respect to the housing.<br>
Further seals may therefore not be required and it<br>
would be possible to implement a significantly<br>
simplified cable plug which can be fitted more easily.<br>
However, the contact sleeve 24 has slits, since it is<br>
20 necessary for the contact sleeve 24, in the case of a<br>
cable having an outer conduct or with annu1ar<br>
corrugations, to be capable of being pushed onto the<br>
outer conductor, on the one hand, despite the<br>
corrugation and,  on the other hand,  to dip into the<br>
25 first corrugation trough with the beaded edge behind<br>
the flanged conductor edge in order to press the<br>
conductor edge safely against the projection 22. Such<br>
configurations are not only known from EP-A2-0 901 200,<br>
but also from US-A-4,046,451 or EP-A1-0 938 165.<br>
30<br>
A slightly different situation results if the coaxial<br>
cable has a corrugated outer conductor with a helical<br>
corrugation, as is the case in documents EP-A1-0 599<br>
602  or  US-A-5,518,420  or  US-A-6,032,358.  Here,  in<br>
35 principle a closed sleeve, i.e. one without slits, can<br>
be used as the contact sleeve and has a thread<br>
structure, which matches the helical corrugation of the<br>
outer conductor, on the inner side and can be screwed<br>
onto the outer conductor like a nut. Even in this case,<br><br>
WO 2006/047907	- 5 -	PCT/CH2005/000662<br>
sealing is not obviously considered at the flanged edge<br>
of the outer conductor since, in all cases, additional<br>
sealing means such as 0 rings or the like are provided<br>
in order to seal the cable plug off towards the<br>
5  outside.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the invention is therefore to provide a<br>
10  cable plug for a coaxial cable, in particular having an<br>
outer conductor with annular corrugations, which avoids<br>
the  disadvantages  of  known  cable  plugs  and  is<br>
characterized  in  particular  by  a  simplified,  cost-<br>
effective design and simplified fitting, as well as to<br>
15  specify a method for fitting said cable plug.<br>
The object is achieved by the totality of the features<br>
in claims 1 and 21, 23. The essence of the invention<br>
consists in designing the fixing means for fixing the<br>
2 0 cable outer conductor to the cable plug such that, with<br>
the fixing, at the same time a sealing connection is<br>
produced between the outer conductor of the coaxial<br>
cable and the housing of the cable plug. As a result,<br>
it is possible to dispense with further sealing means<br>
25 and additional screw connections, and a particularly<br>
simple cable plug which can be fitted easily and is<br>
also suitable in principle for all types of cable outer<br>
conductors results.<br>
30 One preferred configuration of the invention is<br>
characterized by the fact that the fixing means<br>
comprise a sealing and clamping ring, which is pushed<br>
over the end of the outer conductor of the coaxial<br>
cable and, with an annular, first sealing face, presses<br>
35 an edge at the end of the outer conductor in a sealing<br>
manner against a continuous and annular, second sealing<br>
face, which is arranged in the housing of the cable<br>
plug, and that the sealing and clamping ring is<br>
arranged and guided axially within the housing.<br><br>
WO 2006/047907	- 6 -	PCT/CH2005/000662<br>
In order to actuate the sealing and clamping ring,<br>
provision is advantageously made for the fixing means<br>
to further comprise a screw element, which can be<br>
5 screwed to the housing of the cable plug and, when it<br>
is screwed to the housing, exerts an axial force on the<br>
sealing and clamping ring. The screw element is in<br>
particular in the form of a nut or hollow screw, which<br>
has a pressure ring on the inside, with which it dips<br>
10 into the housing when screwed and presses onto the<br>
sealing and clamping ring in the axial direction.<br>
In order that the sealing and clamping ring can be used<br>
without any problems in all types of corrugated and<br>
15 uncorrugated outer conductors, it is advantageous that<br>
the sealing and clamping ring is designed to be closed<br>
annularly, that the sealing and clamping ring has a<br>
conically tapering ring section towards the sealing<br>
side,  that  a  corresponding  conical  guide  face  is<br>
20 arranged in the housing, on which guide face the<br>
sealing and clamping ring is guided with its conical<br>
ring section towards the axis, that the first sealing<br>
face is designed to be continuous, and that the two<br>
sealing faces are oriented essentially at right angles<br>
2 5  to the conical guide face.<br>
The deformation of the sealing and clamping ring during<br>
screwing is facilitated if the sealing and clamping<br>
ring is cylindrical on the side facing away from the<br>
30 sealing side and has a ring section with a reduced wall<br>
thickness in the cylindrical part, adjacent to the<br>
conical ring section.<br>
The sealing and clamping ring may consist of a metallic<br>
35  material, in particular of stainless steel. However, it<br>
may also consist of a plastic or a composite material.<br>
The production of the cable plug is simplified if the<br>
second sealing face and possibly the conical guide face<br><br>
WO 2006/047907	- 7 -	PCT/CH2005/000662<br>
are formed on a metallic adjusting ring, which is<br>
inserted into the housing of the cable plug and is in<br>
electrical contact with the housing.<br>
5 A configuration of the cable plug in accordance with<br>
the invention which is an alternative to the closed<br>
sealing and clamping ring is characterized by the fact<br>
that the sealing and clamping ring is designed as an<br>
open ring provided with a split or designed to comprise<br>
10 a plurality of ring segments. It can therefore be<br>
pushed over the corrugations of the outer conductor<br>
without any difficulties in the slightly open state<br>
and, after closing, can be fixed axially in a simple<br>
manner in a corrugation trough. Owing to the opening<br>
15 split, much less severe forces are required for the<br>
clamping and sealing in order to press the end of the<br>
outer conductor with a radial component against the<br>
corresponding sealing face.<br>
2 0 Preferably, the fixing means further comprise a screw<br>
element, which can be screwed to the housing of the<br>
cable plug and, when screwed to the housing, exerts an<br>
axial force on the sealing and clamping ring, means for<br>
guidance being provided on the sealing and clamping<br>
2 5 ring and on the screw element and preventing the<br>
sealing and clamping ring from tipping.<br>
In particular,  the guide means  comprise  a  v-shaped<br>
guide groove in the front face of the screw element and<br>
30  a  v-shaped  edge  contour,  which matches  said  guide<br>
groove, on the sealing and clamping ring.<br>
The sealing and clamping ring may be essentially<br>
cylindrical. In this case, it preferably has a<br>
35 circumferential annular bead on the inside, with which<br>
annular bead it presses the outer conductor against the<br>
second sealing face. The use of the sealing and<br>
clamping ring is further simplified if it is designed<br><br>
WO 2006/047907	- 8 -	PCT/CH2005/000662<br>
to be mirror-symmetrical with respect  to a  central<br>
plane passing through the annular bead.<br>
However,  the  sealing and clamping ring may also be<br>
5  conical.<br>
In the method according to the invention, the flanged<br>
edge can be clamped in in particular by means of a<br>
screw connection.<br>

APPROACHES FOR IMPLEMENTING THE INVENTION<br>
In an illustration comparable to that in figure 1, a<br>
preferred  exemplary  embodiment  of  a  cable  plug<br>
2 0 according to the invention is reproduced in figure 2.<br>
The cable plug 30 comprises a housing 33, which<br>
concentrically surrounds an inner conductor 31, which<br>
is held in insulated fashion in the housing by means of<br>
an .insulator 32. In turn, a union nut 27 is fixed with<br>
2 5 the aid of a snap ring 2 9 such that it can be rotated<br>
at the plug-in side end of the housing 33. For sealing<br>
purposes in interaction with the female connector, a<br>
seal 2 8 is provided. In order to fix, make contact with<br>
and seal the outer conductor of the coaxial cable,  a<br>
30 screw connection is provided which comprises three<br>
elements, namely an adjusting ring 34 consisting of<br>
metal, for example brass, which is inserted into the<br>
housing 33 and is supported on a shoulder at the level<br>
of the insulator 32, a sealing and clamping ring 35 and<br>
35 a nut 36. The nut 3 6 can be screwed onto the housing 33<br>
at the cable-side end, the cable being guided through a<br>
central through-hole in the nut 36. A pressure ring 37<br>
is formed in the interior of the nut 36, dips into the<br>
central hole in the housing 33 when the nut 36 is<br><br>
WO 2006/047907	- 10 -	PCT/CH2005/000662<br>
screwed onto the housing 33 and presses on the cable-<br>
side ring face of the sealing and clamping ring 35.<br>
The adjusting ring 34 and the sealing and clamping ring<br>
5 35, which are illustrated individually in figures 3 and<br>
4, form, with their mutually assigned sealing faces 39<br>
and 42, a clamping mechanism, which clamps the flanged<br>
edge 52 on the outer conductor 50 of an introduced<br>
coaxial cable 47 in when the cable plug 30 is screwed<br>
10 (see figure 5) . In order that the sealing and clamping<br>
ring 35 can be pushed over the corrugations of an outer<br>
conductor 5 0 with annular corrugations without any<br>
problems (as is shown in figure 5), but at the same<br>
time can also engage safely behind the flanged edge 52<br>
15 when screwed together, it comprises a plurality of ring<br>
sections 43, 44 and 45, of which the plug-in side ring<br>
section 4 3 tapers conically in the plug-in direction<br>
and the two other ring sections 44 and 45 are<br>
cylindrical. A corresponding conical guide face 41 on<br>
20 the adjusting ring 34 lies opposite the conical ring<br>
section 4 3 and causes the conical ring section 4 3 to be<br>
increasingly narrowed when the cable plug 30 is screwed<br>
and therefore when the sealing and clamping ring 35 is<br>
inserted into the housing 33. This narrowing results in<br>
25 the sealing and clamping ring pressing an edge of the<br>
outer conductor 50 of sufficient width against the<br>
sealing face 39 on the adjusting ring 34 and therefore<br>
ensuring reliable sealing.<br>
30 In order to make safe clamping possible in the case of<br>
a conically widened flanged edge 52 and the Inwardly<br>
directed narrowing movement of the sealing and clamping<br>
ring 35, the two sealing faces 39 and 42 on the<br>
adjusting ring 34 and the sealing and clamping ring 35,<br>
35 respectively, are oriented essentially at right angles<br>
to the conical guide face 41. Since the two sealing<br>
faces 39, 42 form closed, uniform rings, the flanged<br>
edge 52, which is clamped in between the two sealing<br>
faces 39, 42, acts as a metallic sealing ring.<br><br>
WO 2006/047907	- 11 -	PCT/CH2005/000662<br>
'The sealing and clamping ring 35,  as a closed ring<br>
(without  any  slits),  is  subjected  to  considerable<br>
mechanical loads during screwing owing to the narrowing<br>
5  associated therewith. It therefore needs to be produced<br>
from a suitable material in order to withstand these<br>
loads. In particular, the material of the sealing and<br>
clamping ring 35 should also be selected such that as<br>
few intermodulations as possible occur within the cable<br>
10 plug 30 on signal transmission. A metallic material<br>
such as, for example, aluminum or in particular<br>
stainless steel (V2A, material No. 4301) has proven<br>
successful. However, it should be nonmagnetic in order<br>
not to negatively influence the conduction properties<br>
15 in the cable plug. However, other materials such as<br>
plastics or composite materials can also be used. Such<br>
a suitable composite material is, for example, a PTFE<br>
filled with small metal particles. The sealing and<br>
clamping ring 35 can additionally be coated in order to<br>
20  make it subject to as little friction as possible.<br>
When fitting the cable plug 30 shown in figure 5, first<br>
the nut 36 is pushed over the coaxial cable 47. Then,<br>
the sealing and clamping ring 35 is pushed over an<br>
2 5 exposed end of the outer conductor 50 of the coaxial<br>
cable 47.<br>
Subsequently, the edge at the end of the outer<br>
conductor  50  is  flanged on  the  outside  to  form a<br>
30 flanged edge 52. Then, the cable is inserted with the<br>
exposed inner conductor 4 8 into the female connector<br>
part, which has slits, of the inner conductor 31 in the<br>
cable plug 30. Finally, the nut 3 6 is screwed onto the<br>
housing  33  until  the  flanged  edge  is  clamped  in<br>
35 uniformly around the circumference between the two<br>
sealing faces 39, 42 in a sealing and retaining mariner<br>
and in a manner providing electrical contact. An<br>
exposed section of the dielectric 4 9 of the cable is in<br>
this  case  accommodated  by  the  adjusting  ring  34.<br><br>
WO 2006/047907	- 12 -	PCT/CH2005/000662<br>
Towards  the  rear  out,  the  coaxial  cable  4 7  can<br>
additionally be  sealed by a  sealing  ring,  which  is<br>
introduced into a corresponding annular groove 38 in<br>
the nut 36.<br>
5<br>
The sealing clamping of the flanged edge 52 in the<br>
cable plug 30 shown in figure 5 is not restricted to<br>
coaxial cables having an outer conductor with annular<br>
corrugations, but can also be used in cables having an<br>
10 outer conductor with helical corrugations or in cables<br>
having a straight, tubular outer conductor, with the<br>
result that, on top of the advantageous simple design<br>
and simple fitting, a single plug type can be used for<br>
many types of cable. Even in the case of cables with a<br>
15 braided outer conductor, corresponding clamping can be<br>
achieved with the novel cable plug without, however, it<br>
being possible for sufficient simultaneous sealing to<br>
be ensured.<br>
2 0 The previously explained exemplary embodiment shown in<br>
figures 2-5 was based on a closed sealing and clamping<br>
ring, which, owing to its constant inner diameter is<br>
not only subject to restrictions when pushed onto the<br>
outer conductor of the coaxial cable but also requires<br>
25  considerable forces during the clamping and sealing.<br>
An improvement in this respect can be achieved if, in<br>
the context of the invention, a sealing and clamping<br>
ring is used which is not completely closed but is<br>
30 open, i.e. is provided with a slit or a split at least<br>
at one point, or overall comprises a plurality of<br>
independent ring segments. Owing to the design as an<br>
open ring, the inner diameter of the sealing and<br>
clamping  ring  can  be  enlarged  by  being  bent  up<br>
35 temporarily so as to facilitate the procedure for<br>
pushing it onto the outer conductor, with the result<br>
that the sealing and clamping ring can then bo pushed<br>
over the corrugations of the outer conductor without<br>
any  effort.  Once  it  has  been pushed  on,  the  inner<br><br>
WO 2006/047907	- 13 -	PCT/CH2005/000662<br>
diameter can be reduced in size again by being bent<br>
together. The sealing and clamping ring then assumes,<br>
for example, a position between two adjacent<br>
corrugations which is secured against being axially<br>
5  displaced.<br>
A first exemplary embodiment for a cable plug with an<br>
open sealing and clamping ring is reproduced in<br>
figures 6 and 7,  in which case no hatching of the<br>
10 sectioned parts has been provided. The cable plug 60 in<br>
figure 6 has a similar design to the cable plug 30 from<br>
figure 5. A housing 56 coaxially surrounds an inner<br>
conductor 53, which is retained in insulated fashion in<br>
the housing 56. A union nut 55 is provided for the<br>
15 plug-in connection, and an annular seal 54 is used for<br>
sealing the plug-in connection. From the opposite side,<br>
the end of a coaxial cable 65 having a corrugated outer<br>
conductor 61 and a surrounding outer sheath 64 is<br>
inserted into the cable plug 60. The connection of the<br>
2 0 inner conductor of the coaxial cable 65 to the inner<br>
conductor 53 of the cable plug 60 is not illustrated in<br>
figure 6.<br>
For the sealing clamping of the outer conductor 61 in<br>
25  the housing 56, an open sealing and clamping ring 58<br>
(with slits or splits) is provided which is illustrated<br>
individually  in  figure 7.  The  metallic  sealing  and<br>
clamping  ring  58  is  essentially cylindrical.  It  is<br>
mirror-symmetrical with respect to a central plane 74<br>
30  at right angles to the ring axis. In the central plane<br>
74,  an  inwardly protruding,  circumferential  annular<br>
bead 68 is integrally formed on the inner side of the<br>
sealing and clamping ring 58, which annular bead, when<br>
the screw connection 59, 63 is tightened, presses the<br>
35  outer  conductor  61  in sealing and clamping  fashion<br>
against a sealing face 57,  which is formed slightly<br>
conically on the housing 56.  Since the  sealing and<br>
clamping ring 5 8 is provided with a radial split 69<br>
(figure 7b), it can be compressed comparatively easily<br><br>
WO 2006/047907	- 14 -	PCT/CH2005/000662<br>
when the cable plug 60 is screwed whilst; reducing the<br>
size of the inner diameter and therefore produces the<br>
required contact pressure for the outer conductor 61.<br>
5 The screw connection comprises a hollow screw 63 (with<br>
an inner sealing groove 62) and a corresponding thread<br>
arrangement 59. The hollow screw 63 has a v-shaped<br>
guide groove 7 3 on the front end facing the sealing and<br>
clamping ring 58,  which guide groove accommodates a<br>
10 corresponding v-shaped edge contour 66, 67 on the<br>
sealing and clamping ring and thus guides the sealing<br>
and clamping ring 58 during the screwing and prevents<br>
it from tipping. The sealing and clamping ring 58<br>
enters axially into a corresponding bore in the housing<br>
15 56, which is delimited towards the inside by the<br>
conical sealing face 57. The annular bead 68, which<br>
fixes the sealing and clamping ring 58 at the same time<br>
in a corrugation trough of the outer conductor 61 (see<br>
also  figure 7c) ,  presses  the  outer  conductor  61  in<br>
20 sealing and clamping fashion inwards against the<br>
sealing face 57 .<br>
A slightly different configuration of the open sealing<br>
and clamping ring is implemented in the cable plug 70<br>
25  from figure 8. The sealing and clamping ring 72 in this<br>
case has a conical shape, with which the ring, with its<br>
front end,  presses the outer conductor 61  in sealing<br>
and clamping fashion against a corresponding sealing<br>
face 71.<br>
30<br>
The open sealing and clamping ring has the following<br>
features and advantages:<br>
The sealing and clamping ring has splits and makes<br>
sealing possible owing  to the guidance  in  the<br>
35       housing of the cable plug.<br>
With the open sealing and clamping ring, the<br>
sealing is brought about virtually without any<br>
complexity in terms of deformation. The force used<br><br>
WO 2006/047907	- 15 -	PCT/CH2005/000662<br>
is conducted directly and without losses to the<br>
sealing faces from the outer conductor.<br>
Owing  to  the  reduced  expenditure  of  force,  a<br>
reduction in the physical length of the cable plug<br>
5       of up to 25% is possible.<br>
The sealing and clamping ring can be reused up to<br>
30 times,  since it does not become plastically<br>
deformed.<br>
The sealing and clamping ring is so far open that<br>
10       it can be pushed over the corrugations of the<br>
outer conductor without any problems.<br>
Even during the insertion into the housing,  the<br>
ring is so far closed that it can no longer slide<br>
out of the corrugation of the outer conductor.<br>
15  -    The v-shaped guide on the nut prevents the ring<br>
from tipping.<br><br>

The invention relates to a cable plug (30) for a coaxial cable (47), in particular<br>
comprising an external corrugated conductor. Said plug comprises an electrically<br>
conductive housing (33), which concentrically surrounds an insulated internal conductor<br>
(31), in addition to fixing elements (34,35,36), which are used to connect the external<br>
conductor of the coaxial cable electrically and mechanically to the housing (33) of the<br>
cable plug (30). The aim of the invention is to permit a particularly simple configuration<br>
and assembly for a cable plug of this type. To achieve this, the fixing elements<br>
(34,35,36) ensure a fixed and sealed connection between the external conductor of the<br>
coaxial cable and the housing (33) of the cable plug (30).</td>
