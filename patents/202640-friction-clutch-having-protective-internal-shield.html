				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to the field of friction clutches and more particularly to friction clutches having adjustment mechanisms, <br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Known friction clutches provide a releasable torsional connection between a motor vehicle engine flywheel and an associated transmission. Repeated clutch disengagement and engagement cycles wear the friction material of the clutch driven disc. The wear results in a change in the axial location of the pressure plate in the engagement position. The shift in axial location results in a decrease in the clutch engagement force or clamping load. Clutches are commonly provided with adjustment mechanisms to compensate for such wear.<br>
Clutches achieve the required clamping loads by applying a spring load to the pressure plate. One type of clutch applies a spring load to a plurality of radially oriented levers which in turn engage the pressure plate. If compressive coil or angle springs are employed, the spring load is commonly applied to radially inner ends of the levers. The levers are pivotally supported at the radially outer ends. As the friction material wears, the engaged position of the radially inner lever tips moves closer to the flywheel. Adjustment mechanisms disposed<br><br>
between the cover and the levers compensate for this change by<br>
increasing the axial distance of the levers' pivot points from the cover.<br>
Alternatively, the change in friction material thickness is compensated<br>
for by providing an adjustment mechanism on the pressure plate<br>
instead of the cover. Clutches may employ diaphragm springs in place<br>
of coil springs. Some types of diaphragm springs may have radially<br>
inwardly directed fingers in place of multiple piece lever and spring<br>
arrangements. The fingers act as the levers of the heavy duty<br>
clutches in that they are axially displaced at their radially inner most<br>
tip to release the clutch.	<br>
Known adjustment mechanisms typically rely on the relative rotation of two parts having inclined surfaces in common engagement with each other. The relative rotation of these elements compensates for wear of the friction material. One strategy for compensating is to axially displace the pivot ends of the levers away from the cover and closer to the flywheel, thereby reducing the amount of spring deflection required to achieve a full clutch engagement. Another strategy is to axially displace the pressure plate's point of contact with the levers away from an engagement surface of the pressure plate, thereby compensating for friction material wear. The ease of adjustment is greatly affected by the coefficient of friction between the relatively rotating parts. When the engaged surfaces become contaminated by debris from the clutch, it increases the difficulty of properly adjusting the clutch to compensate for any wear of the friction elements. The configuration of the clutch allows, and indeed promotes the circulation of debris through the clutch. Spinning the<br>
3<br><br>
clutch cenfrigually forces or impels air and airborne debris through large openings in the clutch cover. Debris may include facing dust, cast iron dust, fretting material and external road dirt, moisture and/or salt.<br>
It is desired to provide a clutch with an adjusting mechanism which is relatively insensitive to the debris commonly found in clutches.<br>
It is also desired to provide a clutch with a shield protecting the adjustment mechanism from the entry of debris there into.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>

A frictionai clutch 10 for a motor vehicle is shown in Fig. 1. Clutch 10 rotates about an axis 12. A flywheel 14 is rotatably fixed to a crankshaft of a motor vehicle engine (not shown). A driven disc 16, centered with respect to axis 12, has a hub which engages an input shaft 17. A friction element 18 of driven disc 16 is engaged by an engagement surface 20 of pressure plate 22 on one side and by an engagement surface 24 of flywheel 14 on the other side.<br>
A cast cover 26 is disposed over pressure plate 22 and is fixed to flywheel 14. A plurality of straps 28 circumferentially extend between pressure plate 22 and cover 26. Straps 28 rotatably fix pressure plate 22 to cover 26, while allowing relative axial displacement of pressure plate 22 to cover 26. Six levers 30 extend radially outwardly from a release assembly 34 to an adjustment mechanism 32. Levers 30 engage pressure plate 22 at a point between their engagement with adjustment mechanism 32 and release assembly 34. The radially innermost tips of levers 30 engage release sleeve retainer 36. As release assembly 34 is axially displaced along<br><br>
axis 12, levers 30 pivot about their radially outer ends to enable engagement and disengagement of clutch 10. Clutch apply springs 38 are disposed between release sleeve retainer 36 and cover 26, as are assist springs 40. Apply springs 38 bias retainer 36 toward flywheel 14. The force of springs 38 Is transferred through levers 30 to pressure plate 22, thereby clamping driven disc 16 against engagement surface 24 of flywheel 14.<br>
Adjustment mechanism 32 includes an adjusting ring 42 having engagement projections 44 retaining levers 30. Adjustment mechanism 32 also includes a first or stationary cam rotatably coupled to adjusting ring 44, and a second or rotating cam 48 axially disposed between first cam 46 and cover 26. Second cam 48 has a wear indicator tab which extends through a slot in cover 26. First cam 46 and second cam 48 have engaging inclined or cam surfaces which vary the distance of adjusting ring 42 from cover 26 with the amount of relative rotation between cams 46 and 48. Cams 46 and 48 are shown schematically in Fig. 8. A biasing spring, disposed between second cam 48 and any of the elements not rotating with respect to cover 26, biases second cam 40 to rotate in a direction increasing the distance of adjusting ring 42 from cover 26. Although no biasing spring is shown in Fig. 1, biasing springs 168, 268 and 468 are shown in the embodiments of Figs. 2, 3 and 5. Adjustment for the wear of driven disc 16 occurs when clutch 10 is in a released condition.<br>
While the apply springs 38 engage retainer 36, levers 30 are subject to a reactive load at adjusting ring 42 which is proportional to<br>
- " -<br><br>
the load from springs 38.   Therefore, adjusting mechanism 32 is operably disposed between cover 26 and springs 38.<br>
A rigid adjustment mechanism shield 50 axially extends from cover 26 toward pressure plate 22, axially overlapping adjusting ring 42. Shield 50 is substantially annular in shape and is located radially within adjustment mechanism 32. Shield 50 is axially aligned with adjustment mechanism 32 to overlap and extend beyond the cam surfaces of first cam 46 and second cam 48. Shield 50, as shown in Fig. 1, is formed of sheet metal and has a radially extending flange welded to cast cover 26. However, it should be appreciated that shield 50 may be alternatively formed, such as by casting it as part of a unitary or one piece shield and cover. Shield 50 may, if necessary, have a gap or an opening therein to accommodate passage of an end of the biasing spring on a first side of shield 50 to the rotatable cam 48 on an opposite side of shield 50. It should also be appreciated that while shield 50 is shown concentric with axis 12, it may be located eccentrically thereto as necessary to dynamically balance clutch 10.<br>
When clutch 10 is in operation, shield 50 prevents debris such as facing dust, cast iron dust, fretting material and external road dirt, moisture and salt from being centrifugally flung outward and into the cam or inclined surface interface from the center of the clutch. This debris, when it accumulates between the surface interface, has a deleterious effect on the performance of the adjustment mechanism. Shield 50 advantageously reduces the amount of debris reaching the interface. The axial length of shield 50 is selected to insure overlap of<br>
1<br><br>
shield 50 over the cam surfaces.<br>
A second embodiment of a shield for a clutch adjustment mechanism is shown in Fig. 2. Clutch 110 has a stamped cover 126 instead of the cast cover of the first embodiment. Clutch 110 is shown without a flywheel and without a driven disc. Pressure plate 122 is rotatably connected to cover 126 by a plurality of straps (not shown). The straps, like straps 28, prevent relative rotation between pressure plate 122 and cover 126 while allowing relative axial displacement of pressure plate 122 relative to cover 126. A flexible shield 150 extends between a radially inwardly projecting engagement shelf 152 of adjusting ring 144 to a rearmost inner surface of cover 126 to provide a protective seal in axial alignment with both first cam 146 and second cam 148. Flexible shield 150 has folds which enable accordion style deflection as adjusting ring 144 is moved further from cover. 126 with increasing wear of the driven disc.<br>
It should be appreciated that bolt 154 is typically removed from clutch 110 after installation of clutch 110 in a vehicle to enable pressure plate 122 to travel freely. Flexible shield 150 is formed of a suitable plastic which is both able to flex, and to sustain the anticipated temperature conditions of clutch 110.<br>
A third embodiment of the invention, shown in Fig.  3,  is substantially like that of the second embodiment shown in Fig. 2. However, in place of a unitary shield 50 or 150, shield 250 comprises a first baffle element 256 extending into a baffle slot 258.  Baffle slot<br><br>
258 is defined on one side by second cam 248 and on the opposite side Dy a second baffle element 260 extending toward adjusting ring 144. Shield 250 defined by baffle elements 256 and 260 greatly reduce the amount of debris which is able to reach the cam surfaces.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a stamped cover 326. Cover 326 has a stamped one piece shield 350 fixed thereto. Shield 350 is substantially the same as shield 50, except that shield 350 is associated with a stamped cover 326 instead of a cast cover 26.<br>
Fig. 5 illustrates a clutch 410 nearly identical to the clutch 210 of Fig. 3. However, shield 450 employs a first baffle element 456 extending from adjusting ring 444 instead of first cam 446. However, as in the clutch of Fig. 3, first baffle element 456 extends into a baffle slot 458 and second baffle element 460 extends from second cam 448 toward adjusting ring 444.<br>
A clutch 510 having an alternative adjustment mechanism 532 is shown in Figs. 6 and 7. Clutch 510 uses, in place of cams, outer diameter threads 562 on an outer diameter of adjusting ring 544 and inner diameter threads 564 in cover 526. Threads 562 and 564 each provide respective inclined surfaces which result in the axial displacement of adjusting ring 554 with relative rotation between those surfaces. In the embodiment shown in the Figs. 6 and 7, adjustment does not occur automatically. Adjustment is made by rotating a pinion gear 566 which engages teeth on an inside diameter of adjusting ring 544 in a manner well known in the art. It should be appreciated that it is also known employ a spring loaded worm gear in<br><br>
place of pinion gear 566 for an automatic wear compensating system. Most commonly, the threads used in such adjustment mechanisms are of a fine thread. The coarse or acme style thread shown in the figures has been found to be much less sensitive to the intrusion of debris than fine threads. With fine threads, the debris tends to Induce corrosion and binding of the threads, rendering the adjustment mechanism Ineffective. It has been found that the increase in the helix angle of the thread, associated with the switch to coarse threads, reduces any tendency of the threads to bind. It has been further found that torsional activity created by the engine, combined with the relatively coarse thread and the associated large helix angle, keeps the adjusting ring operating in a free condition for a longer period of time than an adjustment mechanism employing a fine thread. The benefits of coarse threads can be further enhanced by shielding the threaded area from debris with a shield 550 which axially extends from cover 526 toward pressure plate 522 at least as for as the thread Interface.<br>
It should be appreciated that there are readily apparent alternative embodiments to the above-described clutch configurations. For example, a diaphragm spring may be used In place of the coil springs. Yet alternatively, a diaphragm spring with integral levers or fingers could be employed in place of the separate springs and fevers. Additionally, the adjustment mechanism and the associated shield could- be alternatively disposed between the levers and the pressure plate Instead of between the levers and the cover. Also, the locations of the rotating cam and the stationary cam could be transposed.<br>
The embodiments disclosed herein have been discussed for the purpose of familiarizing the reader with the novel aspects of the invention. Although preferred embodiments of the Invention have been shown and disclosed, many changes, modifications and substitutions may be made by one having ordinary skill in the art without necessarily departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as described In the following claims.<br>

The adjustment mechanism (32, 532) is centered about the axis (12) and is located at a first radial distance from the axis (17). The adjustment mechanism (32, 537) is operably disposed between the biasing member (38) and one of the pressure plate (22, 122, 522) and the cover (26, 126, 326, 426, 526). The annular shield (50, 150, 750, 350, 450, 550) is disposed radially within the adjustment mechanism (32, 532). The annular shield (50, 150, 250, 350, 450, 550) is axially alignment with the adjustment mechanism (32, 532) . The shield (50, 150, 750, 350, 450, 550) is sized and oriented to protect the adjustment mechanism (32, 532) from debris radiating outward from a central area of the clutch (10, 110, 210, 410, 510).</td>
