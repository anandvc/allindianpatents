A MULTI-SPEED TRANSMISSION WITH<br>
A COUNTERSHAFT GEARING<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	The invention relates to a multi-speed transmission having a<br>
countershaft gearing arrangement.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002]	A typical multi-speed, dual clutch transmission uses a combination<br>
of two friction clutches and several dog clutch/synchronizers to achieve "power-<br>
on" or dynamic shifts by alternating between one friction clutch and the other,<br>
with the synchronizers being "pre-selected" for the oncoming ratio prior to<br>
actually making the dynamic shift. "Power-on" shifting means that torque flow<br>
from the engine need not be interrupted prior to making the shift. This concept<br>
typically uses countershaft gears with a different, dedicated gear pair or set to<br>
achieve each forward speed ratio. Accordingly, the total number of gears required<br>
in this typical design is two times the number of forward speeds, plus three for<br>
reverse. This necessitates a large number of required gear pairs, especially in<br>
transmissions that have a relatively large number of forward speed ratios.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0003]	In an aspect of the present invention a powertrain having a<br>
transmission input member, a power source for generating a torque in the input<br>
member, a first intermediate shaft, a second intermediate shaft concentric with the<br>
first intermediate shaft, a clutch, countershaft, a first and second set of gears, an<br>
output shaft and a first transfer gear is provided. The clutch is selectively<br>
engagable to couple the transmission input member with one of the first and<br>
second intermediate shafts. The first set of gears are connected for common<br><br>

rotation with the first intermediate shaft and intermesh with a first selectable set of<br>
gears to form a first plurality of co-planar gear sets, wherein each of the gears of<br>
the first selectable set of gears is connectable for common rotation with one of the<br>
countershaft and the output shaft for selectively transferring the torque when the<br>
clutch is engaged. The second set of gears is connected for common rotation with<br>
the second intermediate shaft and intermesh with a second selectable set of gears to<br>
form a second plurality of co-planar gear sets, wherein each of the gears of the<br>
second selectable set of gears is connectable for common rotation with one of<br>
countershaft and the output shaft for selectively transferring the torque when the<br>
clutch is engaged. The output shaft is disposed radially outward of the second<br>
intermediate shaft. The first transfer gear is coupled to one of the first and second<br>
countershafts for transferring torque from the countershaft to the output shaft.<br>
[0004]	In another aspect of the present invention, the first set of gears<br>
further includes two gears.<br>

further comprises three gears.<br>

and second countershafts and intermeshing with an output gear connected for<br>

to the output shaft.<br><br>

perpendicular to the input member.<br>
[0011]	In another aspect of the present invention, the clutch is a dual clutch<br>

DESCRIPTION<br>
[0025]	Referring to the drawings, wherein like reference numbers refer to<br>
like components, in Figure 1 a multi-speed transmission 10 is depicted. The<br>
transmission 10 includes an input member 12 and output member 14. In the present<br>
embodiment, the input member 12 and the output member 14 are shafts, and will be<br>
referred to as such. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the input and output<br>
members 12, 14 may be components other than shafts. The input shaft 12 is<br>
continuously connected with a torque converter 16 or other starting device. An<br>
engine (not shown) is connected to and provides a driving torque to the torque<br>
converter 16. The output shaft 14 is continuously connected with a final drive unit<br>
18. The transmission 10 includes a countershaft gearing arrangement 20 that<br><br>
5<br>
P000054<br>
includes intermediate shafts, a countershaft, co-planar intermeshing gear sets and<br>
selectively engagable synchronizers as will be described herein. For instance, the<br>
countershaft gearing arrangement 20 includes a first intermediate shaft 22 and a<br>
second intermediate shaft 24, which is a sleeve shaft concentric with the first<br>
intermediate shaft 22. The countershaft gearing arrangement 20 further includes a<br>
countershaft 26. The countershaft 26 is both spaced from and parallel with the input<br>
shaft 12, the output shaft 14 and the intermediate shafts 22, 24. Further still<br>
countershaft gearing arrangement 20 includes a transfer gear shaft 28 for rotatably<br>
supporting a plurality of transfer gears, as will be described in further detail below.<br>
Transfer gear shaft 28 is coaxial with first intermediate shaft 22.<br>
[0026]	The first and second intermediate shafts 22, 24, countershaft 26<br>
transfer gear shaft 28, and output shaft 14 are supported by a first, second and third<br>
support structure or wall 23, 25, 27 formed in the housing of transmission 10. As<br>
conventionally known, the walls 23, 25, 27 are fitted with bearings 29 for rotatably<br>
supporting the first and second intermediate shafts 22, 24, countershafts 26 and<br>
output shaft 14. Wall 23 is disposed closest to the torque converter 16 and the final<br>
drive unit 18. Wall 25 is disposed adjacent wall 23 and wall 27 is disposed adjacent<br>
wall 25. Wall 27 is for example a rear wall of the transmission 10.<br>
[0027]	A dual clutch 30 is connected between input shaft 12 and first and<br>
second intermediate shafts 22, 24. The dual clutch 30 includes a clutch housing 32<br>
connected for common rotation with input shaft 12. Clutch housing 32 has a first<br>
clutch portion 32a and a second clutch portion 32b connected by a housing shaft 33.<br>
Housing shaft 33, for example, is a sleeve shaft that is concentric with first<br>
intermediate shaft 22 and may be welded or otherwise connected to first and second<br>
clutch portions 32a, 32b or integrally formed therewith. Housing shaft 33 allows<br>
first and second clutch portions 32a, 32b to be positioned remote from each other to<br>
provide packaging clearance for transverse extending shafts, drivelines and like<br>
members 35 coupled to final drive unit 18. Further, clutch 30 has a first and a<br>
second clutch element or hubs 34 and 36. Clutch elements 34 and 36 together with<br>
housing 32 are configured to form a friction clutch, as well known in the art as a<br><br>
6<br>
P000054<br>
dual clutch. More specifically, clutch elements 34, 36 and clutch housing 32 have<br>
friction plates mounted thereon that interact to form a friction clutch. Further, clutch<br>
element 34 is connected for common rotation with first intermediate shaft 22 and<br>
clutch element 36 is connected for common rotation with second intermediate shaft<br>
24. Thus, selective engagement of clutch element 34 with clutch housing 32,<br>
connects the input shaft 12 for common rotation with first intermediate shaft 22 and<br>
selective engagement of clutch element 36 with clutch housing 32, connects the<br>
input shaft 12 for common rotation with second intermediate shaft 24.<br>
[0028]	The countershaft gearing arrangement 20 also includes co-planar,<br>
intermeshing gear sets 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 and 100. Gear set 40 includes co-<br>
planar, intermeshing gears 42 and 44. Gear 42 is connected for common rotation<br>
with second intermediate shaft 24. Gear 42 intermeshes with gear 44. Gear 44 is<br>
selectively connectable for common rotation with countershaft 26. As shown in Fig.<br>
1, gear set 40 is disposed adjacent wall 23 and provides a seventh gear ratio.<br>
[0029]	Gear set 50 includes co-planar, intermeshing gears 52 and 54. Gear<br>
52 is connected for common rotation with second intermediate shaft 24. Gear 52<br>
intermeshes with gear 54. Gear 54 is selectively connectable for common rotation<br>
with the output shaft 14. As shown in Fig. 1, gear set 50 is disposed adjacent gear<br>
set 40 and provides a first gear ratio.<br>
[0030]	Gear set 60 includes co-planar, intermeshing gears 62, 64 and 66.<br>
Gear 62 is connected for common rotation with second intermediate shaft 24. Gear<br>
62 intermeshes with gear 64, which is selectively connectable for common rotation<br>
with output shaft 14. Gear 62 also intermeshes with gear 66, which is selectively<br>
connectable for common rotation with countershaft 26. As shown in Fig. 1, gear set<br>
60 is disposed adjacent gear set 50 and provides third and fifth gear ratios.<br>
[0031]	Gear set 70 includes co-planar, intermeshing gears 72, 74 and 76.<br>
Gear 72 is connected for common rotation with first intermediate shaft 22. Gear 72<br>
intermeshes with both gear 74 and gear 76. Gear 74 is selectively connectable for<br>
common rotation with the output shaft 14. Gear 76 is selectively connectable for<br><br>
7<br>
P000054<br>
common rotation with the countershaft 26. As shown in Fig. 1, gear set 70 is<br>
disposed adjacent gear set 0 and provides fourth and sixth gear ratios.<br>
[0032]	Gear set 80 includes co-planar intermeshing gears 82, 84, 86 and 88.<br>
Gear 82 is connected for common rotation with first intermediate shaft 22 and<br>
intermeshes with idler gear 86 and gear 88. Idler gear 86 is rotatable about idler axis<br>
/. Gear 86 also intermeshes with gear 84. Gear 84 is selectively connectable with<br>
output shaft 14. Gear 88 is selectively connectable with countershaft 26. As shown<br>
in Fig. 1, gear set 80 is disposed adjacent gear set 70 and wall 25 and provides a<br>
second and reverse gear ratios.<br>
[0033]	Gear set 90 is a transfer gear set that includes transfer gears 92 and<br>
94. Transfer gear 92 is connected for common rotation with a transfer gear shaft 28<br>
and intermeshes with gear 94. Transfer gear 94 is connected for common rotation<br>
with output shaft 14. As shown in Fig. 1, gear set 90 is disposed between walls 25<br>
and 27 and transfers torque from transfer gear shaft 28 to output shaft 14.<br>
[0034] Co-planar gear set 100 is a transfer gear set that includes transfer gears<br>
102 and gear 104. Transfer gear 102 is connected for common rotation with transfer<br>
gear shaft 28 and intermeshes with gear 104. Transfer gear 104 is connected for<br>
common rotation with output shaft 14. As shown in Fig. 1, gear set 100 is disposed<br>
adjacent gear set 90 and transfers torque from transfer gear shaft 28 to output shaft<br>
14.<br>
[0035]	The transmission 10 further includes a plurality of selectively<br>
engagable synchronizers 110, 112, 114, 116, 118, 120, 122 and 124. Synchronizers<br>
110/112, 114/116, 118/120 and 122/124 are a left and right side of synchronizer<br>
assemblies, sharing a common synchronizer hub and sleeve. Synchronizer 110 is<br>
selectively engagable to connect gear 54 with output shaft 14 for common rotation<br>
therewith. Synchronizer 112 is selectively engagable to connect gear 64 with output<br>
shaft 14 for common rotation therewith. Synchronizer 114 is selectively engagable<br>
to connect gear 66 with countershaft 26 for common rotation therewith.<br>
Synchronizer 116 is selectively engagable to connect gear 44 with countershaft 26<br>
for common rotation therewith. Synchronizer 118 is selectively engagable to<br><br>
8<br>
P000054<br>
connect gear 74 with output shaft 14 for common rotation therewith. Synchronizer<br>
120 is selectively engagable to connect gear 84 with output shaft 14 for common<br>
rotation therewith. Synchronizer 122 is selectively engagable to connect gear 76<br>
with countershaft 26 for common rotation therewith. Synchronizer 124 is<br>
selectively engagable to connect gear 88 with countershaft 26 for common rotation<br>
therewith.<br>
[0036]	The transmission 10 is capable of transmitting torque from the input<br>
shaft 12 to the output shaft 14 in at least seven forward torque ratios and one reverse<br>
torque ratio. Each of the forward torque ratios and the reverse torque ratio is<br>
attained by engagement of dual clutch 30 and one of the clutch elements 34, 36 and<br>
one or more of the synchronizers 110, 112, 114, 116, 118, 120, 122 and 124. Those<br>
skilled in the art will readily understand that a different speed ratio is associated with<br>
each torque ratio.<br>
[0037]	To establish the reverse torque ratio clutch element 34 of the dual<br>
clutch 30 and synchronizer 120 are engaged. By the engagement of clutch element<br>
34 of the dual clutch 30, torque is transferred from the input shaft 12 through clutch<br>
housing 32 to the first intermediate shaft 22. Further, torque is transferred from the<br>
first intermediate shaft 22 through gear 82 to idler gear 86. Idler gear 86 transfers<br>
the torque to gear 84. Upon engagement of synchronizer 120, gear 84 transfers<br>
torque to output shaft 14. Output shaft 14 transfers the torque to the final drive unit<br>
18.<br>
[0038]	A first forward torque ratio (1st gear) is achieved by engaging clutch<br>
element 36 of the dual clutch 30 and synchronizer 110. By the engagement of clutch<br>
element 36 of the dual clutch 30, torque is transferred from input shaft 12 through<br>
clutch housing 32 to the second intermediate shaft 24. Further, torque is transferred<br>
from the second intermediate shaft 24 to gear 52. Gear 52 transfers the torque to<br>
gear 54. Upon engagement of synchronizer 110, gear 54 transfers torque to output<br>
shaft 14. Output shaft 14 transfers the torque to the final drive unit 18.<br>
[0039]	A subsequent forward torque ratio (2nd gear) is established by<br>
engagement of clutch element 34 of the dual clutch 30 and synchronizer 124. By the<br><br>
9<br>
P000054<br>
engagement of clutch element 34 of the dual clutch 30, torque is transferred from<br>
input shaft 12 through clutch housing 32 to the first intermediate shaft 22. Further,<br>
torque is transferred from the first intermediate shaft 22 to gear 82. Gear 82<br>
transfers the torque to gear 88. Upon engagement of synchronizer 124, gear 88<br>
transfers torque to countershaft 26. Countershaft 26 transfers the torque to transfer<br>
gear 104. Gear 104 transfers torque to transfer gear 102, which in turn transfers the<br>
torque to transfer gear shaft 28. Transfer gear shaft 28 transfers the torque to<br>
transfer gear 92. Transfer gear 92 transfers the torque to transfer gear 94. Transfer<br>
gear 94 transfers the torque to output shaft 14. Output shaft 14 transfers the torque<br>
to the final drive unit 18.<br>
[0040]	The subsequent torque ratio (3rd gear) is established by engagement<br>
of clutch element 36 of the dual clutch 30 and synchronizer 112. By the engagement<br>
of clutch element 36 of the dual clutch 30, torque is transferred from input shaft 12<br>
through clutch housing 32 to the second intermediate shaft 24. Further, torque is<br>
transferred from the second intermediate shaft 24 to gear 62. Gear 62 transfers the<br>
torque to gear 64. Upon engagement of synchronizer 112, gear 64 transfers torque<br>
to output shaft 14 Output shaft 14 transfers the torque to the final drive unit 18.<br>
[0041]	The next subsequent forward torque ratio (4th gear) is established by<br>
engagement of clutch element 34 of the dual clutch 30 and synchronizer 118. By the<br>
engagement of clutch element 34 of the dual clutch 30, torque is transferred from<br>
input shaft 12 through clutch housing 32 to the first intermediate shaft 22. Further,<br>
torque is transferred from the first intermediate shaft 22 to gear 72. Gear 72<br>
transfers the torque to gear 74. Upon engagement of synchronizer 118, gear 74<br>
transfers torque to output shaft 14. Output shaft 14 transfers the torque to the final<br>
drive unit 18.<br>
[0042]	The subsequent torque ratio (5th gear) is established by engagement<br>
of clutch element 36 of the dual clutch 30 and synchronizer 114. By the engagement<br>
of clutch element 36 of the dual clutch 30, torque is transferred from input shaft 12<br>
through clutch housing 32 to the second intermediate shaft 24. Further, torque is<br>
transferred from the second intermediate shaft 24 to gear 62. Gear 62 transfers the<br><br>
10<br>
P000054<br>
torque to gear 66. Upon engagement of synchronizer 114, gear 66 transfers torque<br>
to countershaft 26. Countershaft 26 transfers the torque to transfer gear 104. Gear<br>
104 transfers torque to transfer gear 102, which in turn transfers the torque to<br>
transfer gear shaft 28. Transfer gear shaft 28 transfers the torque to transfer gear 92.<br>
Transfer gear 92 transfers the torque to transfer gear 94. Transfer gear 94 transfers<br>
the torque to output shaft 14. Output shaft 14 transfers the torque to the final drive<br>
unit 18.<br>
[0043]	A subsequent forward torque ratio (6th gear) is established by<br>
engagement of clutch element 34 of the dual clutch 30 and synchronizer 122. By the<br>
engagement of clutch element 34 of the dual clutch 30, torque is transferred from<br>
input shaft 12 through clutch housing 32 to the first intermediate shaft 22. Further,<br>
torque is transferred from the first intermediate shaft 22 to gear 72. Gear 72<br>
transfers the torque to gear 76. Upon engagement of synchronizer 122, gear 76<br>
transfers torque to countershaft 26. Countershaft 26 transfers the torque to transfer<br>
gear 104. Gear 104 transfers torque to transfer gear 102, which in turn transfers the<br>
torque to transfer gear shaft 28. Transfer gear shaft 28 transfers the torque to<br>
transfer gear 92. Transfer gear 92 transfers the torque to transfer gear 94. Transfer<br>
gear 94 transfers the torque to output shaft 14. Output shaft 14 transfers the torque<br>
to the final drive unit 18.<br>
[0044]	The subsequent torque ratio (7th gear) is established by engagement<br>
of clutch element 36 of the dual clutch 30 and synchronizer 116. By the engagement<br>
of clutch element 36 of the dual clutch 30, torque is transferred from input shaft 12<br>
through clutch housing 32 to the second intermediate shaft 24. Further, torque is<br>
transferred from the second intermediate shaft 24 to gear 42. Gear 42 transfers the<br>
torque to gear 44. Upon engagement of synchronizer 116, gear 44 transfers torque<br>
to countershaft 26. Countershaft 26 transfers the torque to transfer gear 104. Gear<br>
104 transfers torque to transfer gear 102, which in turn transfers the torque to<br>
transfer gear shaft 28. Transfer gear shaft 28 transfers the torque to transfer gear 92.<br>
Transfer gear 92 transfers the torque to transfer gear 94. Transfer gear 94 transfers<br><br>
11<br>
P000054<br>
the torque to output shaft 14. Output shaft 14 transfers the torque to the final drive<br>
unit 18.<br>
[0045]	The present invention contemplates that a variety of torque ratios<br>
(i.e., the ratio of torque of the output shaft 14 to the input shaft 12) are achievable<br>
through the selection of tooth counts of the gears of the transmission 10. Moreover,<br>
the present invention advantageously provides the transfer gears 92, 94 in one plane<br>
and transfer gears 102, 104 in another plane. This arrangement provides the<br>
opportunity to achieve the desired gear ratios. Further, flexibility is provided in the<br>
selection of gear ratios with respect to 1st gear and 7th gear, as the gears (42, 44, 52<br>
and 54) that provide these ratios are disposed in two separate planes. An overall<br>
transmission length reduction is achieved through the use of idler gear 86.<br>
