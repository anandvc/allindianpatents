				<td>COMOINATION THERAPY USING RECEPTOR TYROSINE KINASE INHIBITORS<br>
AND ANGIOGENESIS INHIBITORS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The invention relates to a combination therapy for the treatment of tumors and tumor<br>
metastases comprising administration of receptor tyrosine kinase antagonists/<br>
inhibitors, especially ErbB receptor antagonists, more preferably EGF receptor (Her 1)<br>
antagonists and anti-angiogenic agents, preferably integrin antagonists, optionally<br>
together with agents or therapy forms that have additive or synergistic efficacy when<br>
administered together with said combination of antagonists/inhibitors, such as<br>
chemotherapeutic agents and or radiation therapy. The therapy can result in<br>
a synergistic potential increase of the inhibition effect of each individual therapeutic on<br>
tumor cell proliferation, yielding more effective treatment than found by administering<br>
an individual component alone.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF receptor or EGFR), also known as c-<br>
erbB1/Her 1, and the product of the neu oncogene (also known as c-erbB2/Her 2) are<br>
the members of the EFG receptor super family, which belongs to the large family of<br>
receptor tyrosine kinases. They interact at the cell surface with specific growth factors<br>
or natural ligands, such as EGF or TGF alpha, thus, activating the receptor tyrosine<br>
kinase. A cascade of downstream signaling proteins are activated in general leading<br>
to altered gene expression and increased growth rates.<br>
C-erbB2 (Har 2) is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase having a molecular weight of,<br>
about 185(000, with considerable homology to the EGF receptor (Her 1), although a<br>
specific ligand for Her 2 has not yet been clearly identified so far.<br>
The .EGF receptor is a transmembrane glycoprotein which has a molecular weight of<br>
170.000, And is found on many epithelial cell types. It is activated by at least three<br>
ligands, EGF, TGF-α (transforming growth factor alpha) and amphiregulin. Both<br>
epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-a) have<br>
been demonstrated to bind to EGF receptor and to lead to cellular proliferation and<br>
tumor growth. These growth factors do not bind to Her 2 (Ulrich and Schlesinger,<br>
1990, Cell 61, 203). In contrast to several families of growth factors, which induce<br><br>
receptor dimerization by virtue of their dimeric nature (e.g. PDGF) monomeric growth<br>
factors, such as EGF, contain two binding sites for their receptors and, therefore, can<br>
cross-link two neighboring EGF receptors (Lemmon et al., 1997, EMBO J. 16,281).<br>
Receptor dimerization is essential for stimulating of the intrinsic catalytic activity and<br>
for the autophosphorylation of growth factor receptors. It should be remarked that<br>
receptor protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) are able to undergo both homo- and<br>
heterodimerization.<br>
Clinical studies indicate that both EGF receptor and c-erbB2 are overexpressed in<br>
certain types of tumors, especially, breast, ovary, bladder, colon, kidney, head and<br>
neck cancers and squamous carcinomas of the lung. (Mendelsohn, 1989, Cancer<br>
Cells 7,359; Mendelsohn, 1990, Cancer Biology 1, 339). Therefore, these<br>
observations have stimulated preclinical investigations targeting on inhibiting the<br>
function of human EGF receptors or c-erbB2 as novel therapeutic approaches to<br>
treat cancer (see e.g. Baselga et al., 1996, J. Clin. Oncol. 14, 737; Fan and<br>
Mendelsohn, 1998, Curr. Opin. Oncol. 10, 67). It has been reported that, for example,<br>
anti-EGF receptor antibodies as well as anti-Her 2 antibodies show fruitful results in<br>
human cancer therapy. Thus, humanized monoclonal antibody 4D5 (hMAb 4D5,<br>
HERCEPTIN®) is already a commercialized product.<br>
It has been demonstrated that anti-EGF receptor antibodies while blocking EGF and<br>
TGF-a binding to the receptor appear to inhibit tumor cell proliferation. In view of<br>
these findings, a number of murine and rat monoclonal antibodies against EGF<br>
receptor have been developed and tested for their ability inhibit the growth of tumor<br>
cells in vitro and in vivo (Modjtahedi and Dean, 1994, J. Oncology 4, 277). Humanized<br>
monoclonal antibody 425 (hMAb 425) (US 5,558,864; EP 0531 472) and chimeric<br>
monoclonal antibody 225 (cMAb 225) (Naramura et al., 1993, Cancer Immunol.<br>
Immunother. 37, 343-349.WO 96/40210), both directed to the EGF receptor, have<br>
shown their efficacy in clinical trials. The C225 antibody was demonstrated to inhibit<br>
EGF-mediated tumor cell growth in vitro and inhibit human tumor formation in vivo in<br>
nude mice. The antibody, moreover, appeared to act, above all, in synergy<br>
with certain chemotherapeutic agents (i.e., doxorubicin, adriamycin, taxol, and<br>
cisplatin) to eradicate human tumors in vivo in xenograft mouse models. Ye et al.<br><br>
(1999, Oncogene 18, 731) have reported that human ovarian cancer cells can be<br>
treated successfully with a combination of both cMAb 225 and hMAb 4D5.<br>
Angiogenesis, also referred to as neovascularization, is a process of tissue<br>
vascularization that involves the growth of new blood vessels into a tissue. The<br>
process is mediated by the infiltration of endothelial cells and smooth muscle ceils.<br>
The process is believed to proceed in any one of three ways: (1) the vessels can<br>
sprout from pre-existing vessels; (2) de novo development of vessels can arise from<br>
precursor cells (vasculogenesis); or (3) existing small vessels can enlarge in diameter<br>
(Blood et al., 1990, Bioch. Biophys. Acta 1032, 89. Vascular endothelial cells are<br>
known to contain at least five RGD-dependent integrins, including the vitronectin<br>
receptor (αvβ3 or αvβ3), the collagen Types I and IV receptor, the laminin receptor,<br>
the fibronectin/laminin/collagen receptor and the fibronectin receptor (Davis et al.,<br>
1993, J. Cell. Biochem. 51, 206). The smooth muscle cell is known to contain at least<br>
six RGD-dependent integrins, including αvβ3 αvβ5.<br>
Inhibition of cell adhesion in vitro using monoclonal antibodies immunospecific<br>
for various integrin a or B subunits have implicated the vitronectin receptor αvβ3 in cell<br>
adhesion of a variety of cell types including microvascular endothelial cells (Davis et<br>
al., 1993, J. Cell. Biol. 51, 206).<br>
Integrins are a class of cellular receptors known to bind extracellular matrix proteins,<br>
and mediate cell-extracellular matrix and cell-cell interactions, referred generally to as<br>
cell adhesion events. The integrin receptors constitute a family of proteins with shared<br>
structural characteristics of non-covalent heterodimeric glycoprotein complexes<br>
formed of a and 3 subunits. The vitronectin receptor, named for its original<br>
characteristic of preferential binding to vitronectin, is now known to refer to three<br>
different integrins, designated αvβ1, αvβ3 and avB5. αvβ1 binds fibronectin and<br>
vitronectin. αvβ3 binds a large variety of ligands, including fibrin, fibrinogen, laminin,<br>
thrombospondin, vitronectin and von Willebrand's factor. αvβ5 binds vitronectin. It is<br>
clear that there are different integrins with different biological functions as well as<br>
different integrins and subunits having shared biological specificity and function. One<br>
important recognition site in a ligand for many integrins is the arginine-glycine-<br>
aspartic acid (RGD) tripeptide sequence. RGD is found in all of the ligands identified<br><br>
above for the vitronectin receptor integrins. This RGD recognition site can be<br>
mimicked by linear and cyclic (poly)peptides that contain the RGD sequence. Such<br>
RGD peptides are known to be inhibitors or antagonists, respectively, of integrin<br>
function. It is important to note, however, that depending upon the sequence<br>
and structure of the RGD peptide, the specificity of the inhibition can be altered to<br>
target specific integrins. Various RGD polypeptides of varying integrin specificity<br>
have been described, for example, by Cheresh, et al., 1989, Cell 58, 945, Aumailley<br>
et al., 1991, FEBS Letts. 291,50, and in numerous patent applications and patens<br>
(e.g. US patents 4,517,686, 4,578,079, 4,589,881,4,614,517, 4,661,111, 4,792,525;<br>
EP 0770 622).<br>
The generation of new blood vessels, or angiogenesis, plays a key role in the growth<br>
of malignant disease and has generated much interest in developing agents that<br>
inhibit angiogenesis (see, for example, Holmgren et al., 1995, Nature Medicine 1,<br>
149; Folkman, 1995, Nature Medicine 1, 27; O'Reilly et. al., 1994, Cell 79, 315). The<br>
use of αvβ3 integrin antagonists to inhibit angiogenesis is known in methods to inhibit<br>
solid tumor growth by reduction of the blood supply to the solid tumor (see, for<br>
example, US 5,753,230 and US 5,766,591, which describe the use of αvβ3<br>
antagonists such as synthetic polypeptides, monoclonal antibodies and mimetics of<br>
αvβ3 that bind to the αvβ3 receptor and inhibit angiogenesis). Methods and<br>
compositions for inhibiting αvβ5 mediated angiogenesis of tissues using antagonists of<br>
the vitronectin receptor αvβ3 are disclosed in WO 97/45447. Angiogenesis is<br>
characterized by invasion, migration and proliferation of endothelial cells, processes<br>
that depend on cell interactions with extracellular matrix components. In this context,<br>
the integrin cell-matrix receptors mediate cell spreading and migration. The<br>
endothelial adhesion receptors of integrin αvβ3 were shown to be key players by<br>
providing a vasculature-specific target for anti-angiogenic treatment strategies<br>
(Brooks et al., 1994, Science 264, 569; Friedlander et. al., 1995, Science 270). The<br>
requirement for vascular integrin αvβ3 in angiogenesis was demonstrated by several<br>
in vivo models where the generation of new blood vessels by transplanted human<br>
tumors was entirely inhibited either by systemic administration of peptide antagonists<br>
of integrin αvβ3 and αvβ3, as indicated above, or, alternatively, by anti- αvβ3 antibody<br><br>
LM609 (Brooks et al., 1994, Cell 79, 1157; ATCC HB 9537). This antibody blocks the<br>
αvβ3 integrin receptor the activation of which by its natural ligands promotes apoptosis<br>
of the proliferative angiogenic vascular cells and thereby disrupts the maturation of<br>
newly forming blood vessels, an event essential for the proliferation of tumors.<br>
Nevertheless, it was recently reported, that melanoma cells could form web-like<br>
patterns of blood vessels even in the absence of endothelial cells (1999, Science 285,<br>
14), implying that tumors might be able to circumvent some anti-angiogenic drugs<br>
which are only effective in the presence of endothelial tissue.<br>
Numerous molecules stimulate endothelial proliferation, migration and assembly,<br>
including VEGF, Ang1 and bFGF, and are vital survival factors. VEGF (Vascular<br>
Endothelial Growth Factor) has been identified as a selective angiogenic growth<br>
factor that can stimulate endothelial cell mitogenesis. VEGF, in particular, is thought<br>
to be a major mediator of angiogenesis in a primary tumor and in ischemic ocular<br>
diseases. VEGF is a homodimer (MW : 46.000) that is an endothelial cell-<br>
specific angiogenic (Ferrara et al., 1992, Endocrin. Rev., 13,18) and<br>
vasopermeability factor (Senger et al., 1986, Cancer Res., 465629) that binds to high-<br>
affinity membrane-bound receptors with tyrosine kinase activity (Jakeman et al., 1992,<br>
J. Clin. Invest., 89, 244). Human tumor biopsies exhibit enhanced expression of<br>
VEGF mRNAs by malignant cells and VEGF receptor mRNAs in adjacent endothelial<br>
cells. VEGF expression appears to be greatest in regions of tumors adjacent to<br>
vascular areas of necrosis, (for review see Thomas et al., 1996, J* Biol. Chem.<br>
271(2), 603; Folkman, 1995, Nature Medicine 1, 27). WO 97/45447 has implicated the<br>
αvβ5 integrin in neovascularization, particularly, that induced by VEGF, EGF and TGF-<br>
α, and discloses that αvβ5 antagonist can inhibit VEGF promoted angiogenesis.<br>
Effective anti-tumor therapies may also utilize targeting VEGF receptor for inhibition of<br>
angiogenesis using monoclonal antibodies. (Witte et a!., 1998, Cancer Metastasis<br>
Rev. 17(2), 155). MAb DC-101 is known to inhibit angiogenesis of tumor cells.<br>
As summarized above it is evident that EGF, VEGF and integrins αvβ3 and αvβ5 and<br>
their receptors are basically involved in tumor proliferation and tumor angiogenesis,<br>
and that effective inhibitors, especially monoclonal antibodies, directed to EGF<br><br>
receptor and/or VEGF receptor and/or integrin receptors or any other protein tyrosine<br>
kinase receptors are principally suitable candidates for tumor therapy. Monoclonal<br>
antibodies which can specifically recognize their antigen epitopes on the relevant<br>
receptors, are of special interest<br>
However, the use of such antibodies, which were successful in vitro and in animal<br>
models, have not shown satisfying efficacy in patients as mono-drug therapy. Similar<br>
results were obtained when other anti-angiogenic or EGF receptor antagonists than<br>
antibodies were used in clinical trials. It seems, that tumors, if some specific sites are<br>
blocked, may use other cell surface molecules to compensate for said original<br>
blocking. Thus, tumors do not really shrink during various anti-angiogenic or anti-<br>
proliferative therapies. For these reasons, combination therapies were proposed to<br>
circumvent this problem using monoclonal antibodies together with cytotoxic or<br>
chemotherapeutic agents or in combination with radiotherapy. Indeed, clinical trials<br>
have shown that these combination therapies are more efficient than the<br>
corresponding mono-administrations. Thus, for example, antibody-cytokine fusion<br>
protein therapies have been described which promote immune response-mediated<br>
inhibition of established tumors such as carcinoma metastases. For example, the<br>
cytokine interleukin 2 (IL-2) has been fused to specific monoclonal antibodies KS1/4<br>
and ch14.18 directed to the tumor associated antigens epithelial cell adhesion<br>
molecule (Ep-CAM, KSA, KS1/4 antigen) or the disialoganglioside GD, respectively,<br>
to form the fusion proteins ch14.18-IL-2 and KS1/4-IL-2, respectively (US 5,650,150).<br>
Another clinical approach is based on the administration of monclonal antibody c225<br>
in combination with Herceptin® (Ye et al, 1999, I.e.). Furthermore, the combination of<br>
anti-EGF receptor antibodies together with anti-neoplastic agents, such as cisplatin or<br>
doxorubicin, was disclosed in EP 0667 165 (A1) and US 6,217,866); a similar<br>
combination, especially a combination of Herceptin® with cisplatin and other cytotoxic<br>
factors, was described in Genentech's US 5,770,195. Synergy effects between an<br>
anti-angiogenic integrin Ov antagonist and above-mentioned antibody-cytokine fusion<br>
proteins were observed in tumor metastases (Lode et aL 1999, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.<br>
96,1591, WO 00/47228). Methods of using integrin antagonists together with anti-<br>
neoplastic agents were recently claimed in WO 00/38665. Recently, it was found that<br><br>
a combination of gemcitabine with specific monoclonal antibody DC-101, which<br>
inhibits angiogenesis, increased the anti-tumor effect in pancreatic cancer of mice<br>
compared with gemcitabine alone. DE 198 42415 discloses the combination of a<br>
specific cyclic RGD peptide as integrin inhibitor with specific anti-angiogenesis<br>
agents. Other approaches suggest the administration of EGF receptor blocking<br>
agents, antibodies included, or integrin antagonists combined with radiation or<br>
radiotherapy, respectively (e.g. WO 99/60023, WO 00/0038715).<br>
Nevertheless, although various combinations therapies are under investigation and in<br>
clinical trials, the outcome of these therapies are not fruitful enough. Therefore, it is a<br>
need to develop further combinations which can show increased efficacy and reduced<br>
side-effects.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present inventions describes for the first time a novel pharmaceutical treatment<br>
which is based on the new concept in tumor therapy to administer to an individual in a<br>
therapeutically effective amount an agent that blocks or inhibits a receptor tyrosine<br>
kinase, preferably an ErbB receptor and more preferably an EGF receptor together<br>
with an anti-angiogenic agent. Optionally the composition according to this invention<br>
may comprise further therapeutically active compounds, preferably selected from the<br>
group consisting of cytotoxic agents, chemotherapeutic agents and other<br>
pharmacologically active compounds which may enhance the efficacy of said agents<br>
or reduce the side effects of said agents.<br>
Thus, the invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising as preferred<br>
ErbB receptor antagonists an anti-EGFR (ErbB1 / Her 1) antibody and as anti-<br>
angiogenic agent an inhibitor or antagonist of any of the αvβ3, αvβ5 or αvβ6 integrin<br>
receptors, preferably an RGD containing linear or cyclic peptide. Especially, the<br>
inventions relates, as a preferred embodiment, to a specific combination therapy<br>
comprising anti-EGFR or anti-Her2 antibodies, such as humanized monoclonal<br>
antibody 425 (h425, EMD 72000), chimeric monoclonal antibody 225 (c225) or<br>
Herceptin® together with preferably RGD-containing integrin inhibitors, most<br><br>
preferably with the cyclic peptide cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMe-Val), optionally<br>
together with a chemotherapeutic compound.<br>
According to this invention said therapeutically active agents may also be provided by<br>
means of a pharmaceutical kit comprising a package comprising one or more<br>
receptor tyrosine kinase antagonists, one or more anti-angiogenic agents, and<br>
optionally, one or more cytotoxic / chemotherapeutic agents in single packages or in<br>
separate containers. The therapy with this combinations may include optionally<br>
treatment with radiation.<br>
However, the invention relates, furthermore, to a combination therapy comprising the<br>
administration of only one (fusion) molecule, having anti-receptor tyrosine kinase,<br>
preferably anti-ErbB receptor activity and anti-angiogenic activity, optionally together<br>
with one or more cytotoxic / chemotherapeutic agents. An example is an anti-EGFR<br>
antibody, such as h425 or c225 as described above and below, which is fused at the<br>
C-terminal of its Fc portion to an anti-hormonal agent by known recombinant or<br>
chemical methods. A further example is a bispecific antibody, whereinone specificity<br>
is directed to an nuclear hormone receptor and the other one is directed to the EGF<br>
receptor.<br>
Principally, the administration can be accompanied by radiation therapy, wherein<br>
radiation treatment can be done substantially concurrently or before or after the drug<br>
administration. The administration of the different agents of the combination therapy<br>
according to the invention can also be achieved substantially concurrently or<br>
sequentially. Tumors, bearing receptors on their cell surfaces involved in the<br>
development of the blood vessels of the tumor, may be successfully treated by the<br>
combination therapy of this invention.<br>
It is known that tumors elicit alternative routes for their development and growth. If<br>
one route is blocked they often have the capability to switch to another route by<br>
expressing and using other receptors and signaling pathways. Therefore, the<br>
pharmaceutical combinations of the present invention may block several of such<br><br>
possible development strategies of the tumor and provide consequently various<br>
benefits. The combinations according to the present invention are useful in treating<br>
and preventing tumors, tumor-like and neoplasia disorders and tumor metastases,<br>
which develop and grow by activation of their relevant hormone receptors which are<br>
present on the surface of the tumor cells. Preferably, the different combined agents of<br>
the present invention are administered in combination at a low dose, that is, at a dose<br>
lower than has been conventionally used in clinical situations. A benefit of lowering<br>
the dose of the compounds, compositions, agents and therapies of the present<br>
invention administered to an individual includes a decrease in the incidence of<br>
adverse effects associated with higher dosages. For example, by the lowering the<br>
dosage of an agent described above and below, a reduction in the frequency and the<br>
severity of nausea and vomiting will result when compared to that observed at higher<br>
dosages. By lowering the incidence of adverse effects, an improvement in the quality<br>
of life of a cancer patient is contemplated. Further benefits of lowering the incidence<br>
of adverse effects include an improvement in patient compliance, a reduction in the<br>
number of hospitalizations needed for the treatment of adverse effects, and a<br>
reduction in the administration of analgesic agents needed to treat pain associated<br>
with the adverse effects. Alternatively, the methods and combination of the present<br>
invention can also maximize the therapeutic effect at higher doses.<br>
Tumors, bearing (over-expressed) ErbB receptors, preferably ErbB1 (Her1, EGFR) of<br>
ErbB2 (Her 2) receptors on their cell surfaces, may be successfully treated by the<br>
combinations according to the inventions. The combinations within the<br>
pharmaceutical treatment according to the inventions show an astonishing synergetic<br>
effect. In administering the combination of drugs real tumor shrinking and<br>
disintegration could be observed during clinical studies while no significant adverse<br>
drug reactions were detectable. Above all, the three-drug combinations (receptor<br>
tyrosine kinase, preferably ErbB receptor blocking agent plus anti-angiogenic agent<br>
plus chemotherapeutic agent) show superior efficacy. However, whether a<br>
chemotherapeutic drug is synergistically effective or not depends on the drug itself,<br>
the receptor tyrosine kinase, preferably ErbB receptor antagonist and the tumor cell<br>
that is treated with said agents, and must be usually checked case by case.<br><br>
In detail the invention refers to:<br>
•	a pharmaceutical composition comprising an agent or agents having<br>
(i) at least one receptor tyrosine kinase blocking / inhibiting specificity and<br>
(ii) at least one angiogenesis blocking / inhibiting specificity,<br>
wherein said agent or agents is / are not a cytokine immunoconjugate,<br>
optionally together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or<br>

The pharmaceutical combinations and methods of the present invention provide<br>
various benefits. The combinations according to the present invention are useful in<br>
treating and preventing tumors, tumor-like and neoplasia disorders. Preferably, the<br>
different combined agents of the present invention are administered in combination at<br>
a low dose, that is, at a dose lower than has been conventionally used in clinical<br>
situations. A benefit of lowering the dose of the compounds, compositions, agents<br>
and therapies of the present invention administered to a mammal includes a<br>
decrease in the incidence of adverse effects associated with higher dosages. For<br>
example, by the lowering the dosage of a chemotherapeutic agent such as<br>
methotrexate, doxorubicin, gemcitabine, docetaxel, paclitaxel, bleomycin or cisplatin,<br>
a reduction in the frequency and the severity of nausea and vomiting will result when<br>
compared to that observed at higher dosages. Similar benefits are contemplated for<br>
the compounds, compositions, agents and therapies in combination with the integrin<br>
antagonists of the present invention. By lowering the incidence of adverse effects,<br>
an improvement in the quality of life of a cancer patient is contemplated. Further<br>
benefits of lowering the incidence of adverse effects include an improvement in<br>
patient compliance, a reduction in the number of hospitalizations needed for the<br>
treatment of adverse effects, and a reduction in the administration of analgesic agents<br>
needed to treat pain associated with the adverse effects.<br><br>
Alternatively, the methods and combination of the present invention can also<br>
maximize the therapeutic effect at higher doses.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
If not otherwise pointed out the terms and phrases used in this invention have the<br>
meanings and definitions as given below. Moreover, these definitions and meanings<br>
describe the invention in more detail, preferred embodiments included.<br>
A "receptor" or "receptor molecule" is a soluble or membrane bound / associated<br>
protein or glycoprotein comprising one or more domains to which a ligand binds to<br>
form a receptor-ligand complex. By binding the ligand, which may be an agonist or an<br>
antagonist the receptor is activated or inactivated and may initiate or block pathway<br>
signaling.<br>
By" ligand" or "receptor ligand" is meant a natural or synthetic compound which<br>
binds a receptor molecule to form a receptor-ligand complex. The term ligand<br>
includes agonists, antagonists, and compounds with partial agonist/antagonist action.<br>
An "agonist" or "receptor agonist" is a natural or synthetic compound which binds<br>
the receptor to form a receptor-agonist complex by activating said receptor and<br>
receptor-agonist complex, respectively, initiating a pathway signaling and further<br>
biological processes.<br>
By "antagonist" or "receptor antagonist" is meant a natural or synthetic compound<br>
that has a biological effect opposite to that of an agonist. An antagonist binds the<br>
receptor and blocks the action of a receptor agonist by competing with the agonist<br>
for receptor. An antagonist is defined by its ability to block the actions of an agonist. A<br>
receptor antagonist may be also an antibody or an immunotherapeutically effective<br>
fragment thereof. Preferred antagonists according to the present invention are cited<br>
and discussed below.<br><br>
An "ErbB receptor" is a receptor protein tyrosine kinase which belongs to the ErbB<br>
receptor family and includes EGFR(ErbBl), ErbB2, ErbB3 and ErbB4 receptors and<br>
other members of this family to be identified in the future. The ErbB receptor will<br>
generally comprise an extracellular domain, which may bind an ErbB ligand; a<br>
lipophilic transmembrane domain; a conserved intracellular tyrosine kinase domain;<br>
and a carboxyl-terminal signaling domain harboring several tyrosine residues which<br>
can be phosphorylated. The ErbB receptor may be a "native sequence" ErbB receptor<br>
or an "amino acid sequence variant" thereof. Preferably the ErbB receptor is native<br>
sequence human ErbB receptor. ErbB1 refers to the gene encoding the EGFR protein<br>
product. Mostly preferred is the EGF receptor (Her 1). The expressions "ErbB1" and<br>
"Her 1" are used interchangeably herein and refer to human Her 1 protein. The<br>
expressions "ErbB2" and "Her 2" are used interchangeably herein and refer to human<br>
Her 2 protein. ErbB1 receptors (EGFR) are preferred according to this invention<br>
"ErbB ligand" is a polypeptide which binds to and/or activates an ErbB receptor.<br>
ErbB ligands which bind EGFR include EGF, TGF-a, amphiregulin, betacellulin, HB-<br>
EGF and epiregulin.<br>
The term "tyrosine kinase antagonist/inhibitor" refers to natural or synthetic agents<br>
that are enabled to inhibit or block tyrosine kinases, receptor tyrosine kinases<br>
included, which are of specific interest of this invention. Thus, the term includes "ErbB<br>
receptor antagonists/inhibitors', which are defined below in more detail. With<br>
exception of these antagonists, preferably anti-ErbB receptor antibodies additionally<br>
suitable tyrosine kinase antagonists of the invention are chemical compounds which<br>
have shown efficacy in mono- drug therapy for, e.g., breast and prostate cancer.<br>
Suitable indolocarbazole-type tyrosine kinase inhibitors can be obtained using<br>
information found in documents such as US patents 5,516,771; 5,654,427;<br>
5,461,146; 5,650,407. US patents 5,475,110; 5,591,855; 5,594,-009 and WO<br>
96/11933 disclose pyrrolocarbazole-type tyrosine kinase inhibitors and prostate<br>
cancer. Preferably, the dosage of the chemical tyrosine kinase inhibitors as defined<br>
above is from 1 pg/kg to 1 g/kg of body weight per day. More preferably, the dosage<br>
of tyrosine kinase inhibitors is from 0.01 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg of body weight per day.<br><br>
The term 'ErbB receptor antagonist / inhibitor" refers to a natural or synthetic<br>
molecule which binds and blocks or inhibits the ErbB receptor, and is therefore a<br>
member of the "(receptor) tyrosine kinase antagonist/inhibitor" family. Thus, by<br>
blocking the receptor the antagonist prevents binding of the ErbB ligand (agonist) and<br>
activation of the agonist/ligand receptor complex. ErbB antagonists may be directed<br>
to Her 1 (or EGFR / Her 1) or Her 2. Preferred antagonists of the invention are<br>
directed to the EGF receptor (EGFR, Her 1). The ErbB receptor antagonist may be an<br>
antibody or an immunotherapeutically effective fragment thereof or non-<br>
immunobiological molecules, such as a peptide, polypeptide protein. Chemical<br>
molecules are also included, however, anti-EGFR antibodies and anti-Her 2<br>
antibodies are the preferred antagonists according to the invention.<br>
Preferred antibodies of the invention are anti-Herl and anti-Her2 antibodies, more<br>
preferably anti-Herl antibodies. Preferred anti-Herl antibodies are MAb 425,<br>
preferably humanized MAb 425 (hMAb 425, US 5,558,864; EP 0531 472) and<br>
chimeric MAb 225 (cMAb 225, US 4,943,533 and EP 0359 282). Most preferred is<br>
monoclonal antibody h425, which has shown in mono-drug therapy high efficacy<br>
combined with reduced adverse and side effects,.Most preferred anti-Her2 antibody is<br>
HERCEPTIN® commercialized by Genentech/Roche.<br>
Efficacious EGF receptor antagonists according to the invention may be also other<br>
natural or synthetic chemical compounds. Some examples of preferred molecules of<br>
this category include organic compounds, organometallic compounds, salts of organic<br>
and organometallic compounds.<br>
Efficacious ErbB receptor antagonists according to the invention may be also small<br>
molecules. Small molecules of the invention are not biological molecules as defined<br>
above having a molecular weight of approximately not greater than 400. Preferably,<br>
they have no protein or peptide structure, and are most preferably synthetically<br>
produced chemical compounds. Some examples of preferred small molecules include<br>
organic compounds, organometallic compounds, salts of organic and organometallic<br>
compounds.<br>
Numerous small molecules have been described as being useful to inhibit EGF<br>
receptor and / or Her 2 receptor. Examples are: styryl substituted heteroaryl<br>
compounds (US 5,656,655); bis mono and/or bicyclic aryl heteroaryl, carbocyctic, and<br><br>
heterocarbocyclic compounds (US 5,646,153); tricyclic pyrimidine compounds (US<br>
5,679,683); quinazoline derivatives having receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitory activity<br>
(US 5,616,582); heteroarylethenediyl or heteroarylethenediylaryl compounds (US<br>
5,196,446); a compound designated as 6-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-2-(4-(2-diethyl-<br>
aminoethoxy) phenylamino)-8-methyl-8H-pyrido(2,3)-5-pyrirnidin-7-one (Panek, et al.,<br>
1997, J. Pharmacol. Exp. Therap. 283,1433) inhibiting EGFR, PDGFR, and FGFR<br>
families of receptors.<br>
An "anti-angiogenic agent' refers to a natural or synthetic compound which blocks,<br>
or interferes with to some degree, the development of blood vessels. The anti-<br>
angiogenic molecule may, for instance, be a biological molecule that binds to and<br>
blocks an angiogenic growth factor or growth factor receptor. The preferred anti-<br>
angiogenic molecule herein binds to an receptor, preferably to an integrin receptor or<br>
to VEGF receptor. The term includes according to the invention also a prodrug of said<br>
angiogenic agent. There are a lot of molecules having different structure and origin<br>
which elicit anti-agiogenic properties. Most relevant classes of angiogenesis<br>
inhibitong or blocking agents which are suitable in this invention, are, for example:<br>
(i) anti-mitotics such as flurouracil, mytomycin-C, taxol;<br>
(ii) estrogen metabo!ites_such as 2-methoxyestradiol;<br>
(iii) matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitors, which inhibit zinc<br>
metalloproteinases (metalloproteases) (e.g. betimastat, BB16, TIMPs,<br>
minocycline, GM6001, or those described in "Inhibition of Matrix Metalloproteinases:<br>
Therapeutic Applications" (Golub, Annals of the New York Academy of Science, Vol.<br>

results in inhibiting tumor growth, as well as anti-angiogenic activity which results in<br>
inhibiting the development of blood vessels and endothelial cells, respectively);<br>

antagonists and αv receptor antagonists, for example, anti-αv receptor antibodies and<br>
RGD peptides. Integrin (receptor) antagonists are preferred according to this<br>
invention.<br>
The term "integrin antagonists / inhibitors" or "integrin receptor antagonists /<br>
inhibitors" refers to a natural or synthetic molecule that blocks and inhibit an integrin<br>
receptor. In some cases, the term includes antagonists directed to the ligands of said<br>
integrin receptors (such as for 0763." vitronectin, fibrin, fibrinogen, von Willebrand's<br>
factor, thrombospondin, laminin; for αvβ5: vitronectin; for αvβ1: fibronectin and<br>
vitronectin; for αvβ6: fibronectin). Antagonists directed to the integrin receptors are<br>
preferred according to the invention. Integrin (receptor) antagonists may be natural or<br>
synthetic peptides, non-peptides, peptidomimetica, immunoglobulins, such as<br>
antibodies or functional fragments thereof, or immunoconjugates (fusion proteins).<br>
Preferred integrin inhibitors of the invention are directed to receptor of αv integrins<br>
(e.g. αvβ3, αvβ5, αvβ6 and sub-classes). Preferred integrin inhibitors are αv<br>
antagonists, and in particular αvβ3 antagonists. Preferred αv antagonists according to<br><br>
the invention are RGD peptides, peptidomimetic (non-peptide) antagonists and anti-<br>
integrin receptor antibodies such as antibodies blocking αv receptors.<br>
Exemplary, non-immunological αvβ3 antagonists are described in the teachings of US<br>
5,753,230 and US 5,766,591. Preferred antagonists are linear and cyclic RGD-<br>
containing peptides. Cyclic peptides are, as a rule, more stable and elicit an<br>
enhanced serum half-life. The most preferred integrin antagonist of the invention is,<br>
however, cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMeVal) (EMD 121974, Cilengitide®, Merck<br>
KgaA, Germany; EP 0770 622) which is efficacious in blocking the integrin receptors<br>
αvβ3, αvβ1, αvβ6, αvβ8, α11bβ3. Suitable peptidyl as well as peptidomimetic (non-<br>
peptide) antagonists of the αvβ3/ αvβ5 / αvβ6 integrin receptor have been described<br>
both in the scientific and patent literature. For example, reference is made to Hoekstra<br>
and Poulter, 1998, Curr. Med. Chem. 5,195; WO 95/32710; WO 95/37655; WO<br>

nonanoic acid derivatives which are potent αvβ3 integrin receptor antagonists were<br>
disclosed. Other chemical small molecule integrin antagonists (mostly vitronectin<br>
antagonists) are described in WO 00/38665. Other αvβ3 receptor antagonists have<br>
been shown to be effective in inhibiting angiogenesis. For example, synthetic receptor<br>
antagonists such as (S)-10.11-Dihydro-3-[3-(pyridin-2-ylamino)-1-propyloxy]-5H-<br>
dibenzo[ a,d]cycloheptene-10-acetic acid (known as SB-265123) have been tested in<br>
a variety of mammalian model systems. (Keenan et al., 1998, Bioorg. Med. Chem.<br><br>

encompasses antigen binding fragments thereof, including F(ab)2, Fab, and<br>
engineered Fv or single-chain antibody. One suitable and preferably used monoclonal<br>
antibody directed against integrin receptor αvβ3 is identified as LM609 (Brooks et al.,<br>
1994, Cell 79, 1157; ATCC HB 9537). A potent specific anti-OvB5 antibody, P1F6, is<br>
disclosed in WO 97/45447, which is also preferred according to this invention. A<br>
further suitable αvβ6 selective antibody is MAb 14D9.F8 (WO 99/37683, DSM<br>
ACC2331, Merck KGaA, Germany) as well as MAb 17.E6 (EP 0719 859, DSM<br>
ACC2160, Merck KGaA) which is selectively directed to the αv- chain of integrin<br>
receptors. Another suitable anti-integrin antibody is the commercialized Vitraxin ®.<br>
The term "antibody" or "immunoglobulin" herein is used in the broadest sense and<br>
specifically covers intact monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, multispecific<br>
antibodies (e.g. bispecific antibodies) formed from at least two intact antibodies, and<br>
antibody fragments, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity. The term<br>
generally includes heteroantibodies which are composed of two or more antibodies or<br>
fragments thereof of different binding specificity which are linked together.<br>
Depending on the amino acid sequence of their constant regions, intact antibodies<br>
can be assigned to different "antibody (Immunoglobulin) classes". There are five<br>
major classes of intact antibodies: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, and several of these<br>
may be further divided into "subclasses" (isotypes), e.g., IgGl, lgG2, lgG3, lgG4, IgA,<br>
and lgA2. The heavy-chain conscant domains that correspond to the different classes<br>
of antibodies are called , δ, ε, γ and μ respectively. Preferred major class for<br>
antibodies according to the invention is IgG, in more detail lgG1 and lgG2.<br>
Antibodies are usually glycoproteins having a molecular weight of about 150,000,<br>
composed of two identical light (L) chains and two identical heavy (H) chains. Each<br>
light chain is linked to a heavy chain by one covalent disulfide bond, while the number<br>
of disulfide linkages varies among the heavy chains of different immunoglobulin<br><br>
isotypes. Each heavy and light chain also has regularly spaced intra-chain disulfide<br>
bridges. Each heavy chain has at one end a variable domain (VH) followed by a<br>
number of constant domains. The variable regions comprise hypervariable regions or<br>
"CDR" regions, which contain the antigen binding site and are responsible for the<br>
specificity of the antibody, and the "FR" regions, which are important with respect to<br>
the affinity / avidity of the antibody. The hypervariable region generally comprises<br>
amino acid residues from a "complementarity determining region" or "CDR" (e.g.<br>
residues 24-34 (L1), 50-56 (L2) and 89-97 (L3) in the light chain variable domain and<br>
31-35 (HI), 50-65 (H2) and 95-102 (H3) in the heavy chain variable domain; and/or<br>
those residues from a "hypervariable loop" (e.g. residues 26-32 (L1 ), 50-52 (L2)<br>
and 91-96 (L3) in the light chain variable domain and 26-32 (H1), 53-55 (H2) and 96-<br>
101 (H3) in the heavy chain variable domain; Chothia and Lesk J. Mot. Biol. 196:901-<br>
917 (1987)).The TR" residues (frame work region) are those variable domain<br>
residues other than the hypervariable region residues as herein defined. Each light<br>
chain has a variable domain at one end (VL) and a constant domain at its other end.<br>
The constant domain of the light chain is aligned with the first constant domain of the<br>
heavy chain, and the light-chain variable domain is aligned with the variable domain<br>
of the heavy chain. Particular amino acid residues are believed to form an interface<br>
between the light chain and heavy chain variable domains. The "light chains" of<br>
antibodies from any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two clearly distinct<br>
types, called kappa (K) and lambda (X), based on the amino acid sequences of their<br>
constant domains.<br>
The term "monoclonal antibody" as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from<br>
a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies<br>
comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring<br>
mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are<br>
highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. Furthermore, in contrast<br>
to polyclonal antibody preparations which include different antibodies directed against<br>
different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a<br>
single determinant on the antigen. In addition to their specificity, the monoclonal<br>
antibodies are advantageous in that they may be synthesized uncontaminated by<br><br>
other antibodies. Methods for making monoclonal antibodies include the hybridoma<br>
method described by Kohler and Miistein (1975, Nature 256, 495) and in "Monoclonal<br>
Antibody Technology, The Production and Characterization of Rodent and Human<br>
Hybridomas" (1985, Burdon et al., Eds, Laboratory Techniques in Biochemistry and<br>
Molecular Biology, Volume 13, Elsevier Science Publishers, Amsterdam), or may be<br>
made by well known recombinant DNA methods (see, e.g., US 4,816,567).<br>
Monoclonal antibodies may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the<br>
techniques described in Clackson et al., Nature, 352:624-628 (1991) and Marks etal.,<br>
J. Mol. Biol., 222:58, 1-597(1991), for example.<br>
The term "chimeric antibody" means antibodies in which a portion of the heavy<br>
and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in<br>
antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class<br>
or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to<br>
corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to<br>
another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long<br>
as they exhibit the desired biological activity (e.g.: US 4,816,567; Morrison et al.,<br>
Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA, 81:6851-6855 (1984)). Methods for making chimeric and<br>
humanized antibodies are also known in the art. For example, methods for making<br>
chimeric antibodies include those described in patents by Boss (Celltech) and by<br>
Cabilly (Genentech) (US 4,816,397; US 4,816,567).<br>
"Humanized antibodies" are forms of non-human (e.g., rodent) chimeric antibodies<br>
that contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. For the<br>
most part, humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in<br>
which residues from a hypervariable region (CDRs) of the recipient are replaced by<br>
residues from a hypervariable region of a non-human species (donor antibody) such<br>
as mouse, rat, rabbit or nonhuman primate having the desired specificity, affinity and<br>
capacity. In some instances, framework region (FR) residues of the human<br>
immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore,<br>
humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient<br>
antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications are made to further refine<br><br>
antibody performance. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially<br>
all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all<br>
of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and<br>
all or substantially all of the FRs are those cf a human immunoglobulin sequence. The<br>
humanized antibody optionally also will comprise at least a portion of an<br>
immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin.<br>
Methods for making humanized antibodies are described, for example, by Winter (US<br>
5,225,539) and Boss (Celltech, US 4,816,397).<br>
"Antibody fragments" comprise a portion of an intact antibody, preferably<br>
comprising the antigen-binding or variable region thereof. Examples of antibody<br>
fragments include Fab, Fab', F(ab')2, Fv and Fc fragments, diabodies, linear<br>
antibodies, single-chain antibody molecules; and multispecific antibodies formed from<br>
antibody fragment(s). An "intact" antibody is one which comprises an antigen-binding<br>
variable region as well as a light chain constant domain (CL) and heavy chain<br>
constant domains, CH1, CH2 and CH3. Preferably, the intact antibody has one or<br>
more effector functions. Papain digestion of antibodies produces two identical<br>
antigen-binding fragments, called "Fab" fragments, each comprising a single antigen-<br>
binding site and a CL and a CH1 region, and a residual "Fc" fragment, whose name<br>
reflects its ability to crystallize readily. The "Fc" region of the antibodies comprises, as<br>
a rule, a CH2, CH3 and the hinge region of an lgG1 or lgG2 antibody major class.<br>
The hinge region is a group of about 15 amino acid residues which combine the CH1<br>
region with the CH2-CH3 region. Pepsin treatment yields an "F(ab')2" fragment that<br>
has two antigen-binding sites and is still capable of cross-linking antigen. "Fv" is the<br>
minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen-recognition and<br>
antigen-binding site. This region consists of a dimer of one heavy chain and one light<br>
chain variable domain in tight, non-covalent association. It is in this configuration that<br>
the three hypervariable regions (CDRs) of each variable domain interact to define an<br>
antigen-binding site on the surface of the VH - VL dimer. Collectively, the six hypervariable regions confer antigen-binding specificity to the antibody. However,<br>
even a single variable domain (or half of an Fv comprising only three hypervariable<br>
regions specific for an antigen) has the ability to recognize and bind antigen, although<br><br>
at a lower affinity than the entire binding site. The Fab fragment also contains the<br>
constant domain of the light chain and the first constant domain (CH1) of the heavy<br>
chain." Fab'" fragments differ from Fab fragments by the addition of a few residues<br>
at the carboxy terminus of the heavy chain CH1 domain including one or more<br>
cysteines from the antibody hinge region. F(ab')2 antibody fragments originally were<br>
produced as pairs of Fab' fragments which have hinge cysteines between them.<br>
Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known (see e.g. Hermanson,<br>
Bioconjugate Techniques, Academic Press, 1996;. US 4,342,566). "Single-chain Fv"<br>
or "scFv" antibody fragments comprise the V, and V, domains of antibody,<br>
wherein these domains are present in a Single polypeptide chain. Preferably, the Fv<br>
polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the VH and VL domains<br>
which enables the scFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. Single-chain<br>
FV antibodies are known, for example, from Pluckthun (The Pharmacology of<br>
Monoclonal Antibodies, Vol. 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds., Springer-Verlag, New<br>
York, pp. 269-315 (1994)), W093/16185; US 5,571,894; US 5,587,458; Huston et al.<br>
(1988, Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. 85, 5879) or Skerra and Plueckthun (1988, Science 240,<br>
1038).<br>
"Bispecific antibodies" are single, divalent antibodies (or immunotherapeutically<br>
effective fragments thereof) which have two differently specific antigen binding sites.<br>
For example the first antigen binding site is directed to an angiogenesis receptor (e.g.<br>
integrin or VEGF receptor), whereas the second antigen binding site is directed to an<br>
ErbB receptor (e.g. EGFR or Her 2). Bispecific antibodies can be produced by<br>
chemical techniques (see e.g., Kranz et al. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 78,<br>
5807), by "polydoma" techniques (See US 4,474,893) or by recombinant DNA<br>
techniques, which all are known per se. Further methods are described in WO<br>
91/00360, WO 92/05793 and WO 96/04305. Bispecific antibodies can also be<br>
prepared from single chain antibodies (see e.g., Huston et al. (1988) Proc. Natl.<br>
Acad. Sci. 85, 5879; Skerra and Plueckthun (1988) Science 240, 1038). These are analogues of antibody variable regions produced as a single polypeptide chain. To<br>
form the bispecific binding agent, the single chain antibodies may be coupled together<br>
chemically or by genetic engineering methods known in the art. It is also possible to<br><br>
produce bispecific antibodies according to this invention by using leucine zipper<br>
sequences. The sequences employed are derived from the leucine zipper regions of<br>
the transcription factors Fos and Jun (Landschulz et al., 1988, Science 240,1759; for<br>
review, see Maniatis and Abel, 1989, Nature 341,24). Leucine zippers are specific<br>
amino acid sequences about 20-40 residues long with leucine typically occurring at<br>
every seventh residue.. Such zipper sequences form amphipathic α-helices, with the<br>
leucine residues lined up on the hydrophobic side for dimer formation. Peptides<br>
corresponding to the leucine zippers of the Fos and Jun proteins form heterodimers<br>
preferentially (O'Shea et al., 1989, Science 245, 646). Zipper containing bispecific<br>
antibodies and methods for making them are also disclosed in WO 92/10209 and WO<br>
93/11162. A bispecific antibody according the invention may be an antibody, directed<br>
to VEGF receptor and αV33 receptor as discussed above with respect to the<br>
antibodies having single specificity.<br>
"Heteroantibodies" are two or more antibodies or antibody-binding fragments which<br>
are linked together, each of them having a different binding specificity.<br>
Heteroantibodies can be prepared by conjugating together two or more antibodies<br>
or antibody fragments. Preferred heteroantibodies are comprised of cross-linked<br>
Fab/Fab' fragments. A variety of coupling or crosslinking agents can be used<br>
to conjugate the antibodies. Examples are protein A, carboiimide, N-succinimidyl-S-<br>
acetyl-thioacetate (SATA) and N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio) propionate (SPDP)<br>
(see e.g., Karpovsky et al. (1984) J. EXP. Med. 160,1686; Liu et a. (1985) Proc. Natl.<br>
Acad. Sci. USA 82, 8648). Other methods include those described by Paulus, Behring<br>
Inst. Mitt., No. 78, 118 (1985); Brennan et a. (1985) Science 30 m:81 or Glennie et al.<br>
(1987) J. Immunol. 139, 2367. Another method uses o-phenylenedimaleimide<br>
(oPDM) for coupling three Fab' fragments (WO 91/03493). Multispecific antibodies<br>
are in context of this invention also suitable and can be prepared, for example<br>
according to the teaching of WO 94/13804 and WO 98/50431.<br>
The term "fusion protein" refers to a natural or synthetic molecule consisting of one<br>
ore more proteins or peptides or fragments thereof having different specificity which<br>
are fused together optionally by a linker molecule. As specific embodiment the term<br><br>
includes fudsion constructs, wherein at least one protein or peptide is a<br>
immunoglubulin or antibody, respectively or parts thereof ("immunoconjugates").<br>
The term "immunoconjugate' refers to an antibody or immunoglobulin respectively,<br>
or a immunologically effective fragment thereof, which is fused by covalent linkage to<br>
a non-immunologically effective molecule. Preferably this fusion partner is a peptide<br>
or a protein, which may be glycosylated. Said non-antibody molecule can be linked to<br>
the C-terminal of the constant heavy chains of the antibody or to the N-terminals of<br>
the variable light and/or heavy chains. The fusion partners can be linked via a linker<br>
molecule, which is, as a rule, a 3 -15 amino acid residues containing peptide.<br>
Immunoconjugates according to the invention consist of an immunoglobulin or<br>
immunotherapeutically effective fragment thereof, directed to a receptor tyrosine<br>
kinase, preferably an ErbB (ErbB1/ErbB2) receptor and an integrin antagonistic<br>
peptide, or an angiogenic receptor, preferably an integrin or VEGF receptor and<br>
TNFα or a fusion protein consisting essentially of TNFα and IFNγ or another suitable<br>
cytokine, which is linked with its N-terminal to the C-terminal of said immunoglobulin,<br>
preferably the Fc portion thereof. The term includes also corresponding fusion<br>
constructs comprising bi- or multi-specific immunoglobulins (antibodies) or fragments<br>
thereof.<br>
The term "functionally intact derivative" means according to the understanding of<br>
this invention a fragment or portion, modification, variant, homologue or a de-<br>
immunized form (a modification, wherein epitopes, which are responsible for immune<br>
responses, are removed) of a compound, peptide, protein, antibody (immunoglobulin),<br>
immunconjugate, etc., that has principally the same biological and / or therapeutic<br>
function as compared with the original compound, peptide, protein, antibody<br>
(immunoglobulin), immunconjugate, etc. However, the term includes also such<br>
derivatives, which elicit a reduced or enhanced efficacy.<br>
The term "cytokine" is a generic term for proteins released by one cell population<br>
which act on another cell as intercellular mediators. Examples of such cytokines are<br>
lymphokines, monokines, and traditional polypeptide hormones. Included among the<br><br>
cytokines are growth hormone such as human growth hormone, N-methionyl<br>
human growth hormone, and bovine growth hormone; parathyroid hormone;<br>

TNFa or TNFS. Preferred cytokines according to the invention are interferons and<br>
TNFa.<br>
The term "cytotoxic agent" as used herein refers to a substance that inhibits or<br>
prevents the function of cells and/or causes destruction of cells. The term is intended<br>
to include radioactive isotopes, chemotherapeutic agents, and toxins such as<br>
enzymatically active toxins of bacterial, fungal, plant or animal origin, or fragments<br>
thereof. The term may include also members of the cytokine family, preferably IFNy<br>
as well as antineoplastic agents having also cytotoxic activity.<br>
The term "chemotherapeutic agent" or "anti-neopiastic agent" is regarded<br>
according to the understanding of this invention as a member of the class of<br>
"cytotoxic agents", as specified above, and includes chemical agents that exert anti-<br>
neoplastic effects, i.e., prevent the development, maturation, or spread of neoplastic<br>
cells, directly on the tumor cell, e.g., by cytostatic or cytotoxic effects, and not<br>
indirectly through mechanisms such as biological response modification. Suitable<br>
chemotherapeutic agents according to the invention are preferably natural or<br>
synthetic chemical compounds, but biological molecules, such as proteins,<br>
polypeptides etc. are not expressively excluded. There are large numbers of anti-<br>
neoplastic agents available in commercial use, in clinical evaluation and in pre-<br>
clinical development, which could be included in the present invention for treatment of<br><br>
tumors / neoplasia by combination therapy with TNFα and the anti-angiogenic agents<br>
as cited above, optionally with other agents such as EGF receptor antagonists. It<br>
should be pointed out that the chernotherapeutic agents can be administered<br>
optionally together with above-said drug combination. Examples of chernotherapeutic<br>

The "pharmaceutical compositions" of the invention can comprise agents that<br>
reduce or avoid side effects associated with the combination therapy of the present<br><br>
invention ("adjunctive therapy"), including, but not limited to, those agents, for<br>
example, that reduce the toxic effect of anticancer drugs, e.g., bone resorption<br>
inhibitors, cardioprotective agents. Said adjunctive agents prevent or reduce the<br>
incidence of nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy, radiotherapy or<br>
operation, or reduce the incidence of infection associated with the administration<br>
of myelosuppressive anticancer drugs. Adjunctive agents are well known in the<br>
art. The immunotherapeutic agents according to the invention can additionally<br>
administered with adjuvants like BCG and immune system stimulators. Furthermore,<br>
the compositions may include immunotherapeutic agents or chemotherapeutic agents<br>
which contain cytotoxic effective radio labeled isotopes, or other cytotoxic agents,<br>
such as a cytotoxic peptides (e.g. cytokines) or cytotoxic drugs and the like.<br>
The term " pharmaceutical kit" for treating tumors or tumor metastases refers to a<br>
package and, as a rule, instructions for using the reagents in methods to treat tumors<br>
and tumor metastases. A reagent in a kit of this invention is typically formulated as a<br>
therapeutic composition as described herein, and therefore can be in any of a variety<br>
of forms suitable for distribution in a kit. Such forms can include a liquid, powder,<br>
tablet, suspension and the like formulation for providing the antagonist and/or<br>
the fusion protein of the present invention. The reagents may be provided in separate<br>
containers suitable for administration separately according to the present methods, or<br>
alternatively may be provided combined in a composition in a single container in the<br>
package. The package may contain an amount sufficient for one or more dosages of<br>
reagents according to the treatment methods described herein. A kit of this invention<br>
also contains "instruction for use" of the materials contained in the package.<br>
The term "pharmaceutical treatment" refers to therapeutic methods of the present<br>
invention for treating tumor cells in tumors and tumor metastases are based on the<br>
combined use of angiogenesis inhibiting (anti-angiogenesis) therapy and anti-<br>
tumor immunotherapy by using receptor tyrosine kinase blocking agents, preferably<br>
ErbB antagonists, above all anti-ErbB1(EGFR, Her1) /anti-ErbB2 (Her2) antibodies.<br>
More than one type of angiogenesis inhibiting agent can be used in combination with<br>
more than one type of preferably anti-ErbB receptor inhibiting agent. The combined<br><br>
use can occur simultaneously, sequentially, or with the intervention of a period of time<br>
between the treatments. Any of the specific therapeutics may be administered more<br>
than once during a course of treatment. The method can result in a synergistic<br>
potentiation of the tumor cell proliferation inhibition effect of each individual<br>
therapeutic, yielding more effective treatment than found by administering an<br>
individual component alone. Thus, in one aspect, the method of the invention<br>
encompasses administering to a patient, in combination, an amount of an anti-<br>
angiogenic agent and an anti-ErbB receptor (Her1/Her2) agent, that may not result in<br>
effective angiogenesis inhibition, or anti-tumor cell activity if given in that amount<br>
alone. The method of the invention comprises a variety of modalities for practicing the<br>
invention in terms of the steps. For example, the agents according to the invention<br>
can be administered simultaneously, sequentially, or separately. Furthermore, the<br>
receptor tyrosine kinase blocking agent and the anti-angiogenic agent can be<br>
separately administered within a time interval of about 3 weeks between<br>
administrations, i.e., from substantially immediately after the first active agent is<br>
administered to up to about 3 weeks after the first agent is administered. The method<br>
can be practiced following a surgical procedure. Alternatively, the surgical procedure<br>
can be practiced during the interval between administration of the first active agent<br>
and the second active agent. Exemplary of this method is the combination of the<br>
present method with surgical tumor removal. Treatment according to the method will<br>
typically comprise administration of the therapeutic compositions in one or more<br>
cycles of administration. For example, where a simultaneous administration is<br>
practiced, a therapeutic composition comprising both agents is administered over a<br>
time period of from about 2 days to about 3 weeks in a single cycle. Thereafter,<br>
the treatment cycle can be repeated as needed according to the judgment of the<br>
practicing physician. Similarly, where a sequential application is contemplated,<br>
the administration time for each individual therapeutic will be adjusted to typically<br>
cover the same time period. The interval between cycles can vary from about zero<br>
to 2 months. The monoclonal antibodies, polypeptides or organic mimetics /<br>
chemotherapeutics of this invention can be administered parenteral^ by injection or<br>
by gradual infusion over time. Although the tissue to be treated can typically be<br>
accessed in the body by systemic administration and therefore most often treated by<br><br>
intravenous administration of therapeutic compositions, other tissues and delivery<br>
means are contemplated where there is a likelihood that the tissue targeted contains<br>
the target molecule. Thus, monoclonal antibodies, polypeptides or organic agents of<br>
this invention can be administered intraocularly, intravenously, intraperitoneally,<br>
intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intracavity, transdermally, by orthotopic injection and<br>
infusion, and can also be delivered by peristaltic means. The therapeutic<br>
compositions containing, for example, an integrin antagonist of this invention<br>
are conventionally administered intravenously, as by injection of a unit dose, for<br>
example. Therapeutic compositions of the present invention contain a physiologically<br>
tolerable carrier together with the relevant agent as described herein, dissolved or<br>
dispersed therein as an active ingredient.<br>
As used herein, the terms "pharmaceutically acceptable" and grammatical<br>
variations thereof, as they refer to compositions, carriers, diluents and reagents,<br>
are used interchangeably and represent that the materials are capable of<br>
administration to or upon a mammal without the production of undesirable<br>
physiological effects such as nausea, dizziness, gastric upset and the like. The<br>
preparation of a pharmacological composition that contains active ingredients<br>
dissolved or dispersed therein is well understood in the art and need not be limited<br>
based on formulation. Typically, such compositions are prepared as injectables either<br>
as liquid solutions or suspensions, however, solid forms suitable for solution, or<br>
suspensions, in liquid prior to use can also be prepared. The preparation can also be<br>
emulsified. The active ingredient can be mixed with excipients which are<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable and compatible with the active ingredient and in<br>
amounts suitable for use in the therapeutic methods described herein. Suitable<br>
excipients are, for example, water, saline, dextrose, glycerol, ethanol or the like and<br>
combinations thereof. In addition, if desired, the composition can contain minor<br>
amounts of auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents., pH buffering<br>
agents and the like which enhance the effectiveness of the active ingredient. The<br>
therapeutic composition of the present invention can include pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts of the components therein. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts<br>
include the acid addition salts (formed with the free amino groups of the polypeptide)<br>
that are formed with inorganic acids such as. for example, hydrochloric or phosphoric<br><br>
acids, or such organic acids as acetic, tartaric, mandelic and the like. Salts formed<br>
with the free carboxyl groups can also be derived from inorganic bases such as, for<br>
example, sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium or ferric hydroxides, and such<br>
organic bases as isopropylamine, trimethylamine, 2-ethylamino ethanol, histrdine,<br>
procaine and the like. Particularly preferred is the HCI salt when used in the<br>
preparation of cyclic polypeptide αv antagonists. Physiologically tolerable carriers are<br>
well known in the art. Exemplary of liquid carriers are sterile aqueous solutions that<br>
contain no materials in addition to the active ingredients and water, or contain a buffer<br>
such as sodium phosphate at physiological pH value, physiological saline or both,<br>
such as phosphate-buffered saline. Still further, aqueous carriers can contain more<br>
than one buffer salt, as well as salts such as sodium and potassium chlorides,<br>
dextrose, polyethylene glycol and other solutes. Liquid compositions can also contain<br>
liquid phases in addition to and to the exclusion of water. Exemplary of such<br>
additional liquid phases are glycerin, vegetable oils such as cottonseed oil, and water-<br>
oil emulsions.<br>
Typically, a therapeutically effective amount of an immunotherapeutic agent in the<br>
form of a, for example, anti-ErbB receptor antibody or antibody fragment or antibody<br>
conjugate or an anti-angiogenic receptor antibody, fragment or conjugate is an<br>
amount such that when administered in physiologically tolerable composition is<br>
sufficient to achieve a plasma concentration of from about 0.01 microgram (μg) per<br>
milliliter (ml) to about 100 μg/ml, preferably from about 1 ng/ml to about 5 μg/ml and<br>
usually about 5 μg/ml. Stated differently, the dosage can vary from about 0.1 mg/kg to<br>
about 300 mg/kg, preferably from about 0.2 mg/kg to about 200 mg/kg, most<br>
preferably from about 0.5 mg/kg to about 20 mg/kg, in one or more dose<br>
administrations daily for one or several days. Wnere the immunotherapeutic agent is<br>
in the form of a fragment of a monoclonal antibody or a conjugate, the amount can<br>
readily be adjusted based on the mass of the fragment / conjugate relative to the<br>
mass of the whole antibody. A preferred plasma concentration in molarity is from<br>
about 2 micromolar (μM) to about 5 millimolar (mM) and preferably, about 100 μM to<br>
1 mM antibody antagonist. A therapeutically effective amount of an agent according of<br>
this invention which is a non-immunotherapeutic peptide or a protein polypeptide (e.g.<br><br>
IFN-alpha), or other similarly-sized small molecule, is typically an amount of<br>
polypeptide such that when administered in a physiologically tolerable composition<br>
is sufficient to achieve a plasma concentration of from about 0.1 microgram (μg) per<br>
milliliter (ml) to about 200 μg/ml, preferably from about 1 μg/ml to about 150 ng/ml.<br>
Based on a polypeptide having a mass of about 500 grams per mole, the preferred<br>
plasma concentration in molarity is from about 2 micromolar (μM) to about 5<br>
millimolar (mM) and preferably about 100 ΜM to 1 mM polypeptide antagonist. The<br>
typical dosage of an active agent, which is a preferably a chemical antagonist or a<br>
(chemical) chemotherapeutic agent according to the invention (neither an<br>
immunotherapeutic agent nor a non-immunotherapeutic peptide/protein) is 10 mg to<br>
1000 mg, preferably about 20 to 200 mg, and more preferably 50 to 100 mg per<br>
kilogram body weight per day.<br>
The term "therapeutically effective" or "therapeutically effective amount" refers to<br>
an amount of a drug effective to treat a disease or disorder in a mammal. In the case<br>
of cancer, the therapeutically effective amount of the drug may reduce the number of<br>
cancer cells; reduce the tumor size; inhibit (i.e., stow to some extent and preferably<br>
stop) cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs; inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent<br>
and preferably stop) tumor metastasis; inhibit, to some extent, tumor growth; and/or<br>
relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the cancer. To<br>
the extent the drug may prevent growth and/or kill existing cancer cells, it may be<br>
cytostatic and/or cytotoxic. For cancer therapy, efficacy can, for example, be<br>
measured by assessing the time to disease progression (TTP) and/or determining the<br>
response rate (RR).<br>
Example: The following is a short clinical trial report:<br>
A patient, 45 years old, was originally suffering from progressive squamous cell<br>
carcinoma of the superior maxilla.<br>
EMD 72000:	Monoclonal human antibody 425 (h425), Merck KgaA, Germany<br>
EMD 121974:	Cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMeVal), Cilengitide®, Merck KgaA,<br>
Germany;<br><br>
Chemotherapeutics: various (gemcitabine, cisplatin, etc.)<br>
Case history and clinical findings/status at the start of the compassionate use<br>
treatment: In July 1997 the patient first presented at the Virchow Klinikum, Germany.<br>
A biopsy of the suspected large tumor in the upper maxilla was performed. Histology<br>
revealed a squamous cell carcinoma classified as T4 ,N0 MO. On August 5,1997<br>
partial resection of the superior maxilla and resection of regional lymph nodes was<br>
done. Histology revealed that no clean margin had been achieved, so an additional<br>
resection was performed during the same hospital stay. Due to the unfavourable<br>
histologic classification the patient received a post-operative radiation therapy up to<br>
50.4 Gray from September to October 1997.<br>
In July 1998 progression of disease was suspected which led to hospitalization.<br>
Histology now showed an adenosquamous carcinoma. After consultation of<br>
radiotherapists another radiotherapy was recommended which started in August<br>
1998.	The patient was treated simultaneously with gemcitabine (100 mg) as a<br>
radiosensitizer. The 6 week-therapy led to complete clinical remission. Following the<br>
combined radio-chemotherapy the patient received a therapy with 1000 mg<br>
gemcitabine (5 circles of 16 administrations).<br>
In March 1999 again progression of the carcinoma occurred which led to additional<br>
radiation therapy and palliative resection of the tumor. In August 1999 again tumor<br>
progression and chemotherapy with cisplatin (75 mg/m2) and docetaxel (75 mg/m2)<br>
was started. After three administrations the therapy was stopped due to lack of effect<br>
on tumor growth.<br>
Diffuse bleedings out of the large tumor mass required frequent transfusions of<br>
erythrocyte concentrates.<br>
Course of compassionate use treatment with anti-anqioqenic agent /<br>
chemotherapeutic agents: Under treatment with EMD 121974 (600 mg/m2) and<br>
gemcitabine (Gemzar) (1000mg /m2) in November 1999 a regression of the tumor<br>
was diagnosed. Since mid of January 2000 the patient had been able to hear again<br>
on his right ear and he had been able to open his mouth 30% more than in December<br>
1999.	The surface of the tumor showed signs of granulation and wound healing.<br>
Bleeding stopped and there was no need for further transfusions.<br><br>
The patient was treated with EMD 121974 and Gemzar from 17.11.1999 until<br>
30.03.2000. From 06.04.2000 until 28.04.2000 EMD 121974, Gemzar and a<br>
chemotherapy with 5-FU,cisplatin and rescuvolin was given to the patient because a<br>
progression of the tumor was detected. Chemotherapy-treatment was stopped<br>
because of haematotoxicity and Citengitide treatment was continued alone. From<br>
April to June 2000 the patient received 600 mg/m2 EMD 121974 twice a week only<br>
resulting in stable disease.<br>
The patient's condition worsened after several weeks and the patient was treated .<br>
with an increased dose of 1200 mg/m2 EMD 121974 twice weekly.<br>
Treatment with h425 + Cilenqitide + chemotherapeutics: EMD 72000 was first given in<br>
November 2000 in a dosage of 200 mg (infusion over half an hour) after<br>
premedication with dexamethasone / dimetindenmaleate ( Fenistil) and ranitidin<br>
(Zantic). One week later the patient received additionally gemcitabine (1000mg/m2).<br>
The weekly treatment schedule was : Monday: 1200mg/m2 Cilengitide (one hour<br>
infusion),Thursday 200 mg EMD 72 000 (half an hour infusion) followed by<br>
1000mg/m2 gemcitabine (one hour infusion), Friday 1200 mg/m2 Cilengitide (one hour<br>
infusion). Under this treatment a crater-like disintegration of the tumor mass was<br>
observed. The tumor masses were surgically removed at several occasions. The<br>
effect of the combined treatment was considered exceptionally impressive by the<br>
treating physicians. No therapy related adverse drug reactions in relation to EMD<br>
121974 and EMD 72000 were observed. Up to now the patient's condition remained<br>
improved.<br><br>
