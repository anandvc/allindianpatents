This amount can be determined by systematic field trials, which are within the capabilities of a<br>
person skilled in the art.<br>
Thus, according to the invention, there is provided a fungicide composition comprising, as an<br>
active ingredient, an effective amount of a compound of formula (I) as herein-defined and an<br>
agriculturally acceptable support, carrier or filler.<br>
According to the invention, the term "support" denotes a natural or synthetic, organic or<br>
inorganic compound with which the active compound of formula (I) is combined or associated to<br>
make it easier to apply, notably to the parts of the plant. This support is thus generally inert and<br>
should be agriculturally acceptable. The support may be a solid or a liquid. Examples of suitable<br>
supports include clays, natural or synthetic silicates, silica, resins, waxes, solid fertilisers, water,<br><br>
alcohols, in particular butanol, organic solvents, mineral and plant oils and derivatives thereof. Mixtures of such supports may also be used.<br>
The composition according to the invention may also comprise additional components. In particular, the composition may further comprise a surfactant. The surfactant can be an emulsifier, a dispersing agent or a wetting agent of ionic or non-ionic type or a mixture of such surfactants. Mention may be made, for example, of polyacrylic acid salts, lignosulphonic acid salts, phenolsulphonic or naphthalenesulphonic acid salts, polycondensates of ethylene oxide with fatty alcohols or with fatty acids or with fatty amines, substituted phenols (in particular alkylphenols or arylphenols), salts of sulphosuccinic acid esters, taurine derivatives (in particular alkyl taurates), phosphoric esters of polyoxyethylated alcohols or phenols, fatty acid esters of polyols, and derivatives of the present compounds containing sulphate, sulphonate and phosphate functions. The presence of at least one surfactant is generally essential when the active compound and/or the inert support are water-insoluble and when the vector agent for the application is water. Preferably, surfactant content may be comprised from 5% to 40% by weight of the composition.<br>
Optionally, additional components may also be included, e.g. protective colloids, adhesives, thickeners, thixotropic agents, penetration agents, stabilisers, sequestering agents. More generally, the active compounds can be combined with any solid or liquid additive, which complies with the usual formulation techniques.<br>
In general, the composition according to the invention may contain from 0.05 to 99% by weight of active compound, preferably 10 to 70% by weight.<br>
Compositions according to the invention can be used in various forms such as aerosol dispenser, capsule suspension, cold fogging concentrate, dustable powder, emulsifiable concentrate, emulsion oil in water, emulsion water in oil, encapsulated granule, fine granule, flowable concentrate for seed treatment, gas (under pressure),gas generating product, granule, hot fogging concentrate, macrogranule, microgranule, oil dispersible powder, oil miscible flowable concentrate, oil miscible liquid, paste, plant rodlet, powder for dry seed treatment, seed coated with a pesticide, soluble concentrate, soluble powder, solution for seed treatment, suspension concentrate (flowable concentrate), ultra low volume (ULV) liquid, ultra low volume (ULV) suspension, water dispersible granules or tablets, water dispersible powder for slurry treatment, water soluble granules or tablets, water soluble powder for seed treatment and wettable powder.<br>
These compositions include not only compositions which are ready to be applied to the plant or seed to be treated by means of a suitable device, such as a spraying or dusting device, but also concentrated commercial compositions which must be diluted before application to the crop.<br><br>
The compounds according to the invention can also be mixed with one or more insecticide, fungicide, bactericide, attractant, acaricide or pheromone active substance or other compounds with biological activity. The mixtures thus obtained have a broadened spectrum of activity.<br>
