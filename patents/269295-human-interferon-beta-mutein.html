				<td>HUMAN INTERFERON-BETA MUTEIN FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a human interferon-beta mutein. In particular, the present invention relates to the human interferon-beta mutein having one or two additional sugar chains compared to natural human interferon-beta.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Interferon (IFN) which is a member of cytokines shows antiviral activity, suppresses cell proliferation and regulates natural immune response. Interferon-beta (IFN-P) is a spherical protein having 5 helices and has a molecular weight of 22 kDa which becomes 18 kDa when removed its sugar chain (Arduini et al., Protein Science 8: pp 1867-1877,1999).<br>
Interferon-beta has been actively studied for its clinical applications, and in particular, it has been in the spotlight as a relieving, alleviating or treating agent for multiple sclerosis symptom (Goodkin et al., Multiple sclerosis: Treatment options for patients with relapsing-remitting and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, 1999).<br>
Besides multiple sclerosis, it has been reported that interferon-beta shows diverse immunological activities such as antiviral activity, cell growth inhibition or anti-growth activity, increasing lymphocytotoxicity, immunoregulatory activity, inducing or suppressing proliferation of target cells, activating macrophages, increasing cytokine production, increasing cytotoxicity T cell effect, increasing natural killer cells, and therefore, it is effectively used for treating cancer, autoimmune disorders, viral infections, HIV-relating diseases, hepatitis C, rheumatoid arthritis and the like (Pilling et al., European Journal of Immunology 29: pp 1041-1050, 1999, Young et al., Neurology 51: pp 682-689, 1998; Cirelli et al., Major therapeutic uses of interferons. Clin Immunother 3: pp 27-87,1995).<br>
Human interferon-beta is a kind of glycoproteins linked to one or more sugar chains, and such sugar chain plays an important role in the glycoprotein's activity.<br>
Therefore, there is an instance where a glycoprotein's activity becomes increased when a sugar chain is additionally introduced thereto.<br>
PCT Publication No. WO96/25498 and U.S.A. Patent No. 5,618,698 have disclosed that the activities of hTPO and hEPO glycoproteins are increased by introducing with one or more sugar chains.<br>
The present invention has disclosed a human interferon-beta mutein having increased or improved activity or ability by introducing with a sugar chain into human natural interferon-beta, as a point of view described above.<br>
Accordingly, in an embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a human interferon-beta mutein having increased or improved activity or ability by introducing a sugar chain into human natural interferon-beta.<br>
Other objects or embodiments according to the present invention are provided hereunder.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the present invention relates to a human interferon-beta mutein.<br>
Since the human interferon-beta mutein of the present invention takes the form of introducing with one or two additional sugar chains lo natural human interferon-beta, it shows improved or increased antiviral activity, cell growth suppression activity, immunoregulatory ability and prolonged in vivo half-life (see Figs. 7 to 10).<br>
As described in the following Examples, in case of expressing the polypeptide being replaced the 27th amino acid, arginine (R) in the natural human interferon-beta having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 with threonine (T) or serine (S) or being added with a glycine-asparagine-isoleucine-valine (G-N-I-T-V) sequence to the C-terminal end of the natural human interferon-beta in an animal cell, the present invention can prepare a human interferon-beta mutein having improved or increased activity or ability compared to the natural human interferon-beta by introducing with one or two additional N-linked sugar chains into the natural interferon-beta.<br>
The present invention is provided based on these experimental results.<br>
The human interferon-beta mutein having increased or improved activity or ability compared to the natural human interferon-beta is characterized by including the glycine-asparagine-isoleucine-valine (G-N-I-T-V) sequence at the C-terminal end in the amino acid sequence of the natural human interferon-beta or a natural human interferon-beta mutein and having a N-linked sugar chain at that sequence position.<br>
The term "natural human interferon-beta mutein" used herein including claims means all polypeptides harboring a part of or the whole amino acid sequence derived from the natural human interferon-beta with maintaining human interferon-beta activity.<br>
The term "human interferon-beta activity" used herein means one or more activities sufficient to define a polypeptide as human interferon-beta among the previously known activities being exhibited by human interferon-beta. Such activities include activity for relieving, alleviating or treating multiple sclerosis, antiviral activity, cell growth inhibition, anti-growth activity, anti-proliferation, increasing lymphocytotoxicity, immunoregulatory activity, inducing or suppressing target cell's proliferation, increasing cytokine production, increasing cytotoxic T cell effect, increasing natural killer cell, activity for preventing or treating cancer, preventing or treating auto-immune disorders, preventing or treating viral infections, preventing or treating HIV-relating diseases, preventing or treating hepatitis C and preventing or treating rheumatoid arthritis.<br>
Further, the term "polypeptide harboring a part of or the whole amino acid sequence derived from the natural human interferon-beta" used herein means a polypeptide containing the whole amino acid sequence of the natural human interferon-beta represented by SEQ ID NO: 1 or an essential part thereof, or a polypeptide substantially similar to such polypeptide.<br>
The term "polypeptide including an essential part of the whole amino acid of SEQ ID NO: 1" used herein means a polypeptide which shows relatively lower activity than the natural human interferon-beta having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, but contains a part of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 with still harboring the human interferon-beta activity. In addition, the term<br>
"polypeptide substantially similar to the whole amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 or an essential part thereof" used herein means a polypeptide which shows relatively lower activity than the natural human interferon-beta having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, but contains the whole amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 or an essential part thereof having one or more substituted amino acids with still harboring the human interferon-beta activity.<br>
For example, the polypeptide including an essential part of the whole amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 may be a polypeptide being deleted its N-terminal and/or C-terminal end in the polypeptide having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1. Further, the polypeptide substantially similar to the whole amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 or an essential part thereof is exemplified by a polypeptide having one or more substituted amino acids wherein the substituted amino acid is chemically equivalent to the original amino acid before the substitution. For example, in case of a hydrophobic amino acid such as alanine, it is preferable to replace with another hydrophobic amino acid such as glycine or further hydrophilic amino acid such as valine, leucine or isoleucine than the original amino acid.<br>
Sometimes, since the N-terminal end, the C-terminal end or the substituted amino acid may influence on a motif essential for the activity of human interferon-beta, there are instances where the polypeptide being deleted its N-terminal end and/or C-terminal end or having a substituted amino acid does not show any human interferon-beta activity. Nevertheless, by confirming whether a polypeptide derived from the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 has one or more activities among the activities described above, and/or through a well-known method in the art relating to the identification of human interferon-beta based on the time for a filing date of the present invention, to classify and detect an active polypeptide from such inactive polypeptides belongs to a conventional capacity range of a skilled person in the art.<br>
The above description being collectively considered, the human interferon-beta mutein of the present invention may be defined as one of the following polypeptides which contain a glycine-asparagine-isoleucine-threonine sequence at its C-terminal end, have an N-linked sugar chain at that sequence position and show<br>
the human interferon-beta activity:<br>
(a)	a polypeptide containing the whole amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:<br>
1;<br>
(b)	a polypeptide including an essential part of the amino acid sequence of<br>
SEQ ID NO: 1; and<br>
(c)	a polypeptide substantially similar to the polypeptide (a) or (b).<br>
Therefore, it has to be understood that the human interferon-beta mutein of the present invention is a polypeptide harboring the human interferon-beta activity which contains a glycine-asparagine-isoleucine-threonine sequence at its C-terminal end and has an N-linked sugar chain at that sequence position.<br>
Likewise, although the human interferon-beta mutein of the present invention is defined and understood as all polypeptides showing the human interferon-beta activity which contain a glycine-asparagine-isoleucine-threonine sequence at their C-terminal ends and have an N-linked sugar chain at that sequence position, the preferred human interferon-beta mutein of the present invention is a polypeptide which contains a glycine-asparagine-isoleucine-threonine sequence at the C-terminal end of the natural human interferon-beta having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 and has an N-linked sugar chain at that sequence position.<br>
Further, the preferred human interferon-beta mutein of the present invention is a polypeptide substantially similar to the polypeptide containing the whole amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 or an essential part thereof (corresponding to the above polypeptide (C)). Such polypeptide contains two N-linked sugar chains: one is located at the glycine-asparagine-isoleucine-threonine sequence of its C-terminal end, and the other is located at the 25th to the 28th amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NO: 1 consisting of asparagine-glycine-theronine/serine-leucine, which is modified by replacing the 27th amino acid arginine of SEQ ID NO: 1 with threonine or serine.<br>
The most preferred form in the human interferon-beta muteins of the present invention is a polypeptide which contains a N-linked sugar chain at the position where the 27th amino acid arginine of SEQ ID NO: 1 is replaced with threonine or serine, and contains another N-linked sugar chain at the position where the glycine-<br>
asparagine-isoleucine-threonine sequence is added to its C-terminal end.<br>
The following Examples of the present invention show that the human interferon-beta mutein introduced with two additional sugar chains exhibits further improved or increased activity or ability than the human interferon-beta mutein introduced with only one additional sugar chain compared to the natural human interferon-beta (see Examples 5 and 6, and Figs. 7 to 10).<br>
Meanwhile, the human interferon-beta mutein of the present invention may be defined with a different way as the following.<br>
In particular, the human interferon-beta mutein of the present invention can be defined as a polypeptide showing the human interferon-beta activity as one of the following polypeptides which is introduced with an additional N-linked sugar chain into the position where the 25th to the 28th ammo acid sequences of SEQ ID NO: 2 consisting of asparagine-glycine-threonine/serine-leucine are conserved:<br>
(a)	a polypeptide containing the whole amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:<br>
2;<br>
(b)	a polypeptide including an essential part of the amino acid sequence of<br>
SEQ ID NO: 2; and<br>
(c)	a polypeptide substantially similar to the polypeptide (a) or (b).<br>
The paragraph "the 25th to the 28th amino acid sequences consisting of asparagine-glycine-theronine/serine-Ieucine are conserved" used herein including claims means that the 25th to the 28th amino acid sequences consisting of asparagine-glycine-theronine/serine-leucine must be present at the polypeptide (b) or (c) (i.e., the polypeptide including an essential part of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 or the polypeptide substantially similar to the whole or an essential part of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2).<br>
When the human interferon-beta mutein of the present invention is defined with a different way as described above, the preferred human interferon-beta mutein of the present invention is a polypeptide containing the whole amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 which is introduced with an additional N-linked sugar chain into the position of the 25th to the 28th amino acid sequences consisting of asparagine-glycine-theronine/serine-leucine.<br>
The amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 is the sequence being replaced the<br>
27th amino acid arginine in the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 with threonine or serine.<br>
Meanwhile, the term "polypeptide including an essential part of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2" or "polypeptide substantially similar to the whole or an essential part of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2" has the same meaning as described above.<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention relates to a polynucleotide encoding the human interferon-beta mutein as described above.<br>
The term "human interferon-beta mutein as described above" includes the human interferon-beta muteins of the present invention as defined above with two different ways and all the preferred embodiments each thereof.<br>
When given a certain amino acid sequence, a skilled person in the art can easily synthesize a polynucleotide encoding the certain amino acid sequence based on the given sequence by employing his conventional techniques.<br>
The term "polynucleotide" used herein is defined as the meaning including all single-strand or double-strand RNA or DNA or a polymer thereof.<br>
Meanwhile, when considered the activity, the above polynucleotide is preferable to be a polypeptide encoding the human interferon-beta mutein which is introduced with a glycine-asparagine-isoleucine-threonine-valine sequence into the C-terminal end of the natural human interferon-beta consisting of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 or a polynucleotide encoding the human interferon-beta mutein consisting of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2. More preferably, the polynucleotide is a polynucleotide encoding the human interferon-beta mutein which is introduced with the glycine-asparagme-isoleucine-thereonine-valme sequence into the C-terminal end of the natural human interferon-beta consisting of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 and has the substitution of the 27th amino acid arginine with theronine or serine.<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention relates to an animal cell expression vector comprising the polynucleotide described above which is capable of expressing the human interferon-beta mutein of the present invention in the<br>
animal cell.<br>
The human interferon-beta mutein of the present invention includes one or two additional sugar chains compared to the natural human interferon-beta. When considered the fact that the addition of such sugar chain is a phenomenon generally occurred in an animal cell, the animal cell expression vector fundamentally comprises:<br>
(i) the polynucleotide encoding the human interferon-beta mutein as described above;<br>
(ii) a promoter operably linked to the nucleotide sequence of (i) which generates a RNA molecule;<br>
(iii) a polynucleotide encoding a leader sequence;<br>
(iv) a replication origin; and<br>
(iv) 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) causing polyadenylation of the 3'-terminal end of the RNA molecule.<br>
The promoter employable in the present invention means the sequence capable of activating transcription, which is well-known in the art. Similarly, the leader sequence which leads to the translocation of a translated protein into the endoplasmic reticulum where a glycosylation is occurred and 3'-UTR capable of stabilizing the leader sequence and mRNA are well-known in the art.<br>
Meanwhile, the expression vector of the present invention may selectively comprise a reporter gene (e.g., luciferase and (3-glucuronidase) or an antibiotic resistance gene as a selective marker (e.g., neomycin, carbenicillin, kanamycin, spectinomycin, hygromycine), and may further comprise an enhancer.<br>
Meanwhile, the animal cell expression vector employable in the present invention includes pSV2-neo (Southern and Berg, J. Mo/. Appl. Genet. 1: 327-341, 1982), pCAGGS (Niwa et al., Gene 108: 193-200, 1991), pcDL-SRa296 (Takebe et al., Mol Cell Biol 8: 466-472,1988), pAc373 (Luckow et al., Bio/Technology 6: 47-55,1988), and such vectors listed above may comprise a promoter, leader sequence, replication origin, 3'-UTR, reporter gene, selective marker gene and/or enhancer described above on occasion demands.<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention relates to an animal cell<br>
transformed with the expression vector and a method for the production of a human interferon-beta mutein by culturing the animal cell.<br>
The term "transformation" used herein including claims means the modification of a host cell's genotype by introducing with a foreign polynucleotide (in the present invention, which means a polynucleotide encoding the human interferon-beta mutein), and means the introduction of a foreign polynucleotide into a host cell regardless of the transformation method used. The foreign polynucleotide introduced into a host cell may be maintained with or without the integration into the host cell's genome, and the present invention includes the both cases.<br>
Meanwhile, the term "animal cell" used herein includes all animal cells and insect cells employable in the production of a recombinant protein. Exemplary animal cells employable in the present invention include COS cells, CHO cells, C-127 cells, BHK cells, rat Hep I cells, rat Hep II cells, TCMK cells human pneumocytes, human hepatoma cells, HepG2 cells, mouse hepatocytes, DUKX cells, 293 cells and so on, and the insect cell is exemplified by a silkworm culture cell.<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising the human interferon-beta mutein according to the present invention.<br>
Human interferon-beta included in the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention has been generally used as a therapeutic agent for multiple sclerosis, but it has been also reported that it can be used for treating cancer, autoimmune disorders, viral infections, HIV-relating diseases and hepatitis C (Pilling et al., European Journal of Immunology 29:1041-1050,1999) and its new pharmacological effect has been continuously discovered.<br>
Therefore, the pharmacological effect in the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention must be understood to include all the other pharmacological effects being exhibited by human interferon-beta as well as the pharmacological effect as a therapeutic agent for multiple sclerosis.<br>
Further, such pharmacological effect must be understood to include any pharmacological effect that will be discovered in the future as well as all the<br>
pharmacological effects reported up to now as the pharmacological effect of human interferon-beta.<br>
Since the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention is characterized by comprising the human interferon-beta mutein having improved or increased activity or ability prepared according to the method of the present invention, although the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may include any pharmacological effect of human interferon-beta that will be discovered in the future as well as its all pharmacological effects reported up to now, the scope of the present invention is not to be unduly enlarged.<br>
Nevertheless, when considered the fact that human interferon-beta has been widely used as a therapeutic agent for multiple sclerosis and its therapeutic effects for cancer, auto-immune disorders, viral infections, HIV-relating diseases and hepatitis C have been previously discovered, the above pharmacological effect is preferable to be such pharmacological effects.<br>
Meanwhile, the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be administered via various routes including oral, transdermal, subcutaneous, intravenous and intramuscular introduction.<br>
The inventive pharmaceutical composition may be formulated into several kinds of formulations in accordance with any of the conventional procedures. In preparing the formulation, the active ingredient is preferably admixed or diluted with diluents such as fillers, expanders, binders, wetting agent, disintegrants and surfactants or excipients.<br>
For treating a human patient, a typical daily dose of the inventive pharmaceutical composition may range from about 0.01 to 5 mg/kg body weight, and can be administered in a single dose or in divided doses. However, it should be understood that the amount of the active ingredient actually administered ought to be determined in light of various relevant factors including the condition to be treated, the chosen route of administration, the age, sex and body weight of the individual patient, and the severity of the patient's symptom; and, therefore, the above dose should not be intended to limit the scope of the invention in any way.<br>

The following Examples are intended to further illustrate the present invention and they should not be construed as limiting the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example 1; Synthesis of a gene encoding a human interferon-beta mutein having one or more additional Asn-X-Ser/Thr sequences via mutagenesis<br>
In order to artificially modify R27 (the 27th amino acid sequence, arginine) in the amino acid sequence of human interferon-beta (IFN-P) presented by SEQ ID NO: 1 (Fig. 1) into thereonine (T) or serine (S), or to add a glycine-asparagine-isoleucine-threonine-valine sequence (G-N-I-T-V) to the C-terminal end of IFN-p, site-directed mutagenesis and DNA synthesis were conducted by using a gene encoding natural interferon-beta of SEQ ID NO: 3 as a template.<br>
Namely, a series of primer pairs were synthesized by targeting for the site to be subjected to mutagenesis. At this time, the primer pairs used in overlapping PCR for synthesizing a gene encoding an interferon-beta mutein were as follows:<br>
i) a primer pair for synthesizing R27T<br>
R27T-5': GCAATTGAATGGGACGCTTGAATACTGCCTC (SEQ ID NO: 4)<br>
R27T-3': GAGGCAGTATTCAAGCGTCCCATTCAATTGC (SEQ ID NO: 5)<br>
ii) a primer pair for synthesizing R27S<br>
R27S-5': GCAATTGAATGGGAGTCTTGAATACTGCCTC (SEQ ID NO: 6)<br>
R27S-3': GAGGCAGTATTCAAGACTCCCATTCAATTGC (SEQ ID NO: 7)<br>
iii) a primer pair for synthesizing GNITV<br>
GNITV-5': CTTACAGGTTACCTCCG A A ACGGT A AT ATC ACTGTC TGAAGATCTCCTAGCCTGTCC (SEQ ID NO: 8)<br>
GNITV-3': G A ATGTCC A ATGG AGGCTTTGCC ATT AT AGTG AC AGACTTCTAGAGGATCGGACAGG (SEQ ID NO: 9)<br>
(wherein R27T and R27S are the genes encoding interferon-beta muteins having the substitution of arginine at the 27th position with theronine and serine,<br>
respectively, through the mutagenesis of an interferon-beta gene, and GNITV is the gene encoding the interferon-beta mutein which is added a glycine-asparagine-isoleucine-threonine-valine (G-N-I-T-V) sequence to its C-terminal end through the mutagenesis of an interferon-beta gene. The followings are the same.)<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, PCR was conducted by using plasmid pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, USA) containing the gene encoding interferon-beta as a template, two overlapping primer pairs and Pfu-turbo DNA polymerase. PCR reaction solution was prepared by mixing 5 µl of a 10x reaction buffer solution, 5 to 50 ng of a template gene, 125 ng each of the primer pair and 1 id of a dNTP mixture., its final volume was adjusted to 50 fd with ultrapure water, and then, 1µl  of Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (2.5 U/ µl) was added thereto. The PCR conditions were as follows: 12 cycles of 30 sec at 95 °C, 60 sec at 55 °C and 480 sec at 68 "C after an initial denaturation of 30 sec at 95 °C.<br>
The PCR product was treated with 1 fd of Dpnl (10 U/µl) at 37 °C for 4 hrs to remove the methylated template gene. After 1 id of the Dpnl treated PCR product was added to XLl-blue E. coli cells melted on ice, the mixture was heated at 42 °C for 45 sec and cooled by ice. E. coli cells thus prepared were suspended in 500 fd of a culture medium, incubated at 37 °C for an hour, and subjected to centrifugation to harvest the cells. Thus harvested cells were spread onto a LB agar plate, incubated at 37°C for 16 hrs or more until a colony was generated. After plasmid DNA was purified from the colony, the gene encoding an interferon-beta mutein was subjected to sequencing analysis by using a DNA sequencer. As a result, the 27th amino acid was modified into the codon encoding threonine (R27T) or serine (R27S) via site-directed mutagenesis. Further, the codon encoding the amino acid sequence (GNITV) consisting of glycine-asparagine-isoleucine-threonine-valine was added to the C-terminal end of the natural human interferon-beta. Plasmids containing thus prepared gene were designated pGEMT-IFN-β-R27T, pGEMT-IFN-β-R27S and pGEMT-IFN-β-GNITV, respectively.<br>
PCR was performed by using pGEMT-IFN-(β-R27T and pGEMT-IFN-β-R27S as a template, the overlapping primer pair (iii) specific for GNITV and Pfu-turbo DNA polymerase under the same conditions, and the PCR product thus amplified was subjected to cloning as described above. As a result, the gene having the<br>
substitution of alanine at the 27th position with threonine or serine and the addition of the codon encoding the amino acid sequence consisting of glycine-asparagine-isoleucine-threonine-valine was obtained. Plasmids containing such gene were designated pGEMT-IFN-(β-R27T+GNITV and pGEMT-IFN-(β-R27S+GNITV.<br>
Table 1 shows the plasmicls inserted with 5 interferon-beta mutein genes prepared according to the present invention, respectively. [Table 1] Interferon-beta mutein genes<br>
(Table Removed 1)<br>
Example 2: Construction of an expression vector, transfection into COS cells and cell culture<br>
PCR was carried out by using each of the plasmids containing the interferon-beta mutein prepared in Example 1 as a template and a primer pair of PI (CCGGAATTCGCCACCATGACCAACAAGTGTCTCCTCCAAA, SEQ ID NO: 10) and P2 (CCGCTCGAGGTCACTTAAACAGCATCTGCTGGTTGA, SEQ ID NO: 11), to obtain the genes encoding artificially substituted interferon-beta (Fig. 3). At this time, DNA polymerase (Stratagene) was employed in this PCR reaction, and the amplified gene had recognition sites for restriction enzymes EcoRI and Xhol at its both ends. The IFN-β mutein gene thus amplified and pCDNAS.l (Invitrogen) were treated with EcoRI and Xhol, respectively. The linearized IFN-p mutein gene and pcDNAS.l were recovered from an agarose gel by using a Qiagen extraction kit, subjected to ligation, and then, transformed into E. coli DH5a. Plasmid DNA was purified from the colony generated after culturing the E. coli transformant in a LB-<br>
ampicillin agar medium, treated with restriction enzymes EcoRI and Xhol, and then, subjected to 1 % agarose gel electrophoresis, to select the colony inserted with only the IFN-p mutein gene. It was confirmed that plasmid DNA of the selected colony has the nucleotide sequence of IFN-p mutein gene by sequencing analysis. Such plasmid was designated pCDNA3.1-IFN-(3-X (wherein, X is a number of each interferon-beta mutein).<br>
COS cells (ATCC No. CRL-1650) were transfected with the recombinant expression vectors corresponding to natural interferon-beta, interferon-beta muteins R27T, R27S, R27T+GNITV and R27S+GNITV among the prepared recombinant expression vectors, respectively. Namely, the pre-cultured COS cells were inoculated into a 60 mm tissue culture dish at a concentration of 2x105 cells/ ml and incubated for 24 hrs. Each recombinant expression vector DNA 2 µg and 7 µl of a Lipofectin™ (Gibco BRL) reagent were added to 100 id of DMEM having no serum, respectively, and kept at room temperature for 15 min. Two solutions thus prepared were mixed with each other and kept at room temperature for 15 min, to form a lipofectin-DNA complex. After a serum-free DMEM was added to the lipofectin-DNA complex, the mixture was gently placed on the COS cells cultured in the plate, and the plate was incubated in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator for 6 hrs to occur the transfection. The COS cells transfected with each expression vector were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (JRH), 50 µg/ml of penicillin and 50 µg/ml. of streptomycin at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 48 hrs. During the cultivation, the conditioned culture solution was collected for 3 to 5 days.<br>
Example 3; Characterization of interferon-beta mutein Example 3-1; Confirmation of sugar chain addition<br>
The supernatant containing the recombinant human interferon-beta or the interferon-beta mutein was separated from the culture solution of the transfected COS cells prepared in Example 2. The supernatant 1~2 µg was mixed with an anti -interferon-beta rabbit polyclonal antibody and was subjected to immunoprecipitation at room temperature overnight. Protein A sepharose resin 20 to 80 µl diluted with PBS (phosphate buffered saline) at an equal volume was<br>
added to the supernatant containing the antibody, and the mixture was reacted at room temperature for an hour. The mixture was subjected to centrifugation to separate a pellet, and the pellet was washed with PBS. A part of the pellet was treated with N-glycanase to cut a N-linked sugar chain. The pellets treated with and without N-glycanase were subjected to 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gels were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane and subjected to western blot analysis using an anti-interferon-beta mouse monoclonal antibody according to the method described by Runkel et al (Pharaceutical Research 15: 641-649,1998).<br>
As a result of analyzing the supernatant of the COS cells transfected with each of the interferon-beta muteins, it has been confirmed that its protein molecular weight of the interferon-beta mutein increases compared to that of the natural interferon-beta (Fig. 5). When the interferon-beta mutein having the increased protein molecular weight was treated with N-glycanase, its sugar chain was removed, which results in decreasing the molecular weight (Fig. 5).<br>
Example 3-2; Activity comparison of interferon-beta muteins<br>
To compare the activities of natural interferon-beta and interferon-beta muteins, the amount of the interferon protein was quantified via EIA (enzyme immunoassay), and titers of the natural interferon-beta and interferon-beta muteins were measured through a viral activity test.<br>
EIA was performed by using a kit (PEL) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Namely, 100 µl of a diluting solution was distributed to each well specified within an antibody-absorbing plate included in the enzyme immunoassay kit. An international standard solution and samples were diluted with a diluting solution at a proper dilution rate and 100 µl each of the diluents were added to the well. The plate was kept at room temperature for an hour. At this time, the international standard solution was prepared by dissolving one ample of the human IFN-p international standard (NIBSC) in 1 mi of a formulation buffer and distributing 100 µl of the resulting solution to a vial. The vial was stored at -70 °C, and when used, the frozen vial was melted and the content was properly diluted<br>
with a diluting solution before the use.    After the residual reaction solution was removed from each well, the well plate was washed with 250 fd of a washing solution three times, and 100 uH of an enzyme-antibody conjugate solution was added to each well.   The well plate was kept at room temperature for an hour. After the reaction was completed, the reaction solution was removed.   The well plate was washed with 200 µl of a washing solution three times and the residual solution was completely removed there from.    A pre-prepared substrate-coloring solution 100 µl was then added to each well and reacted at room temperature for 30 min.    After the reaction was completed, 100 µl of a reaction stop solution was added to each well to stop the reaction and the absorbance was measured at 450 ran. A standard curve was drawn by plotting a concentration of the standard solution to a horizontal axis and the absorbance (A450 ran) thereof to a traverse axis, and the concentration of human IFN-(3 corresponding to each absorbance of the international standard solution and samples was calculated from the standard curve.    The average value of three diluent concentrations was determined by multiplying the calculated   concentration  by   each  dilution  rate,  the   measured   values   of  the international standard solution and samples were calculated there from, and then, the final concentration was calculated.    The antiviral activity test was performed according to the same method as described in Example 6.    The ratio of antiviral titer and EIA value in the several culture solutions of COS cells transiently expressing each interferon-beta mutein are shown in Table 2.   From these results, it has been confirmed that the molecular weight of the interferon-beta mutein increases due to the addition of sugar chain, and its activity also is equal to or higher than that of the natural interferon-beta.    For the mass-production of such interferon-beta mutein, the interferon-beta mutein expression vector described above was transfected into CHO cell line. [Table 2]<br>
Increase in the molecular weight of the interferon-beta mutein and the ratio of antiviral titer and EIA value<br>
(Table Removed 2)<br><br>
++: the molecular weight is 26 kDa which is added one sugar chain thereto. ++++: the molecular weight is 30 kDa which is added two sugar chains thereto.<br>
Example 4: Transfection and cell culture (CHO cells)<br>
CHO cells (DG44) were grown in a 60 mm cell culture dish until their confluence reaches to about 40-80% (1-4x105 cells/60 mm dish). A Lipofectin™ reagent 3 µl (Gibco) was well mixed with 97 µl of a-MEM (serum-free and antibiotics-free), and plasmid pcDNA3.1-IFN-|3-X DNA (0.1 µg/µl, or more, about 2 µg) and pSP72-DHFR (0.2 µg) were added thereto. After the mixture was kept at room temperature for 30 min, it added to the CHO cells cultured above (Fig. 4). One day after, the culture medium was replaced with alpha-MEM supplemented with 50 µg/ml of G418 and 10% FBS. Subsequently, the cells were cultured in alpha-MEM minimal medium lacking deoxyribonucleoside and ribonucleoside for 7-10 days, to select transfectant cells. After then, CHO DHFR+ transfectant cells were secondarily selected. The secondarily selected CHO DHFR+ transfectant cells were subjected to colonization on a 96-well plate through a limiting dilution method and continuously cultured in a selective medium. Finally, the transfectant cells were cultured in a minimal medium containing 10% serum with gradually increasing MTX (methotrexate, Sigma) concentration by 2-fold from 20 nM to 1000 nM, to tertiarily select MTX resistant clones grown in the MTX selective medium.<br>
A single cell was separated from the healthy cell line grown in the medium containing 1 µM of MTX for at least a month. First, after a single cell was inoculated into each well of a 96 well-multi plate and cultured, the well having only one single cell was selected. A candidate group showing a high expression rate was selected via El A quantifying analysis. The selected candidate group was cultured by serially transferring it in a 24-well plate to a 6-weii plate. The candidate group thus cultured was selected again via EIA quantifying analysis, to<br>
finally establish a high expression cell line of interferon-beta. As a result of measuring the amount of interferon-beta produced in the recombinant CHO cell line thus prepared above, while the natural interferon-beta cell line produced 1.8 µg/mg/24 hr of IFN-β, CHO-R27T and CHO-R27T-GNITV cell lines expressing the interferon-beta mutein produced 6.5 µg/ml /24 hr and 7.0 µg/ml /24 hr of IFN-p, respectively, which is 3-fold higher than that of the natural cell line.<br>
Example 5: Purification of interferon-beta added with one or more sugar chains produced in CHO cell line<br>
The cell line incorporated with one or more mutein sequences in Example 4 was cultured by using a cell factory (Nunc, Cat No. 170069). Each expression cell line was diluted with alpha-MEM containing 10% FBS into a concentration of 5 x lO4 cells/ ml, and subcultured in the cell factory at 5% CO2, 37 °C for 72 hrs, to confirm a cell growth. The cells were washed with PBS three times to remove the residual serum component at most, and its culture medium was replaced with a serum-free medium (Sigma C8730). After the replacement with the serum-free medium, the culture solution was collected at every 24 hrs four times and the fresh serum-free medium was added thereto each time for the collection. The total four collected culture solutions were subjected to purification. Blue sepharose resin (Amersham-Pharmacia) 200 mi was filled in XK50/20 column (Amersham-Pharmacia) and equilibrated with 10 C.V. (column volume) of a buffer A (20 mM sodium phosphate, 1 M Nad, pH 7.4). The micro-filtered culture solution was flowed into the equilibrated column at a flow rate of 20 m£/min, and monitored by a UV detector at a wavelength of 280 ran. A buffer B (20 mM sodium phosphate, 1 M NaCl, 30% ethylene glycol, pH 7.4) was flowed into the column to remove unabsorbent components, and the protein absorbed to the resin was eluted with a buffer C (20 mM sodium phosphate, 1 M NaCl, 60% ethylen glycol, pH 7.4). The effluent was subjected to dialysis with PBS (phosphate buffered saline), concentrated with a concentrator (Centricon, Cut off 10,000), and then, subjected to dialysis again with PBS.<br><br>
Example 6; Physicochemical characterization of interferon-beta added with one or more sugar chains produced in CHO cell line Example 6-1; SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis<br>
The sample purified in Example 5 was mixed with a 5x sample buffer (125 mM Tris-HCL 5% SDS, 50% glycerol, 0.1% (3-mercaptoethanol, 1 mg/ml bromophenol blue) at a ratio of 1:4, and the mixture was pre-treated at 95 "C for 5 min. The pre-treated mixture 20 µl was loaded onto a well of 15% polyacrylamide gel with a standard molecular weight marker and developed. After the electrophoresis was completed, the gel was stained with Coomassie brilliant blue and destained with a destaining solution. As a result, the natural interferon-beta showed about 18.0 kDa of a band corresponding to the protein having no sugar chain and about 22.0 kDa of a band corresponding to the protein having a sugar chain. In case of IFN-(3 introduced with one additional sugar chain, about 26.0 kDa of a band was additionally detected, and in case of IFN-P introduced with two additional sugar chains, about 30.0 kDa of a band was additionally detected, compared to the band pattern of the natural interferon-beta (Fig. 6).<br>
Example 6-2; Test for confirming the addition of sialic acid to the sugar chain terminal end<br>
The content of interferon-beta in all the purified proteins was measured by using a human IFN-p ELISA kit (PEL). The content of sialic acid in each protein was measured by modifying the method of Masaki Ito et al. (Anal. Biochem. 300: 260, 2002). Sialic acid was separated from a glycoprotein by reacting the purified protein with 0.1 N hydrochloric acid at 80 °C for an hour. Some of them was labeled with fluorescein by using a sialic acid fluorescence labeling kit (Takara) and subjected to HPLC to analyze the content. The results are shown in Table 3 as the % ratio of the weigh of sialic acid in the interferon-beta mutein compared to that of the natural interferon-beta. [Table 3] The weight of sialic acid in the interferon-beta mutein<br>
(Table Removed )<br>
Example 7; Biological activity of interferon-beta mutein expressed in CHO cells Example 7-1; Antiviral activities of R27T, R27S  and  GNITV interferon-beta muteins<br>
Antiviral activities of R27T, R27T+GNITV, GNITV interferon-beta muteins and the interferon-beta being removed its sugar chain (IFNβ-1b) were relatively compared each other based on the antiviral activity of the natural interferon-beta (IFNβ-la). At this time, Rebif (Serono) was employed as the natural interferon-beta.<br>
A549 cells were cultured in MEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 x MEM unessential amino acid solution and 100 mM sodium pyruvate. At the day of such analysis, the cells were transferred to the same fresh medium and their cell density was adjusted to 5 x lO5 cells/ml. Test and control interferon-betas were diluted with the same medium. Such dilution was carried out within a 96-well multiplate to be contained in the well at a volume of 100 µl/well and the samples were serially diluted by 2-told. All samples were prepared in two sets. Control wells containing only 100 µl of the medium (having no interferon-beta) were included therein. After 100 µl of the cells were added to each well, the well plate was incubated at 37 °C, 5% COa for 20 hrs. The medium was removed from the plate and 100 id of EMCV (1000 TCID50/ml) diluted with the same medium was added to each well. After the plate was incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 22 hrs, the medium was removed therefrom, and the plate was stained with crystal violet. After removing the dye, 100 [µl of 2-methoxyethanol was added thereto to extract the dye, and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm to determine the antiviral activity.<br>
While the interferon-beta being removed its sugar chain (IFN(β-lb) showed relatively low activity under the same condition, R27T, R27T+GNITV and GNITV showed higher activities than the natural interferon-beta (IFNβ-la; Rebif).<br>
R27T+GNITV introduced with two additional sugar chains showed 4-fold higher activity than the natural interferon-beta, and R27T introduced with one additional sugar chain showed 3-fold higher activity than the same (Fig. 7).<br>
Example 7-2; Inhibition of cell growth<br>
Further the effects of interferon-beta muteins on cell growth were examined, and relatively compared each other based on the effect of the natural interferon-beta (IFNfβ-la) equal to the antiviral activity. At this time, Rebif (Serono) was employed as the natural interferon-beta. Anti-proliferation activity was measured by using Daudi cells.<br>
Daudi cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 100 U/ml, of penicillin, 100 mg/ml of streptomycin, 2 mM glutamine and 10% FBS. Test and control interferon-betas were serially diluted by 2-fold with RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS within a 96-well multiplate to be contained in the well at a volume of 100 µl/well. All samples were prepared in two sets. The cells were added to a 96-well multiplate at a concentration of 1x104 cells/well, and the well plate was incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 40 to 48 hrs. Subsequently, 50 µl of 'the medium containing 1 µCi of 3[H] thymidine was added to each well, and the well plate was incubated for 6 hrs. The cells were harvested and their incorporated amount of radioactivity was measured.<br>
The interferon-beta muteins suppressed the growth of Daudi cells and their activities were dose-dependent. The interferon-beta being removed its sugar chain (IFN(3-lb) showed lower anti-proliferation activity than the natural interferon-beta (IFNβ-la), while R27f, R27T+GNITV and GNITV interferon-beta muteins showed higher activity than the same. The activities of the interferon-beta muteins were ranked in order of R27T+GNITV, R27T and GNITV (Fig. 8).<br>
Example 7-3: Immunoregulatory ability<br>
Immunoregulatory abilities of the natural interferon-beta and muteins thereof were measured through the activation of MHC class I in A549 cells.<br>
A549 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 2 mM glutamine. The cells were inoculated into the medium containing the 2-fold serially diluted natural interferon-beta, muteins thereof or interferon-beta being removed its sugar chain (IFNβ-lb) at a density of 1x105 cells/ml, respectively, and incubated at 37 °C, 5% COa for 48 hrs. The cells were treated with a Hank's buffered salt solution containing 5 mM EDTA and harvested by centrifugation. The pellet thus separated was suspended in a FACS buffer at a density of 2x107 cells/ml, and its expression amount of MHC class I was measured by FACS analysis. An anti-HLA ABC antibody coupled with biotin and streptavidin coupled with fluorescein were employed in this measurement, and all samples were made in two sets.<br>
The immunity enhancement effects of the interferon-beta muteins were similar to or slightly higher than that of the natural interferon-beta (IFNβ-la). Such effects of the interferon-beta muteins were increased in order of GNITV, R27T and R27T+GNITV, which is equal to the above described two different activities. The interferon-beta having no additional sugar chain showed low immunoregulatory effect compared to its concentration (Fig. 9).<br>
Example 7-4; Pharmacokinetic constant study<br>
In vivo activity test was conducted according to the method which measures the change in blood concentration of the interferon-beta mutein depending on time in the rat administered with the interferon-beta mutein which was expressed in CHO cells. Hsd:Sprague-Dawley female rats having an average body weight of 246.3±258.1 g were employed in such in vivo activity test, and they were acclimated for a week to the cage environment being set temperature to 24±1°C, relative humidity to 55% and a lighting condition to 12 hrs light/12 hrs dark. The rats were bred in the same cage during the experiment.<br>
After weighing the rats and making them randomly distributed according to their average body weights, they were divided into four groups of administering with the natural interferon-beta, two muteins and no drug, respectively, each consisting of 4 rats. Catheter was inserted at the jugular vein of the rats by a surgical operation 2 days before the experiment. The average body weight of the<br>
catheter inserted rats was 253.5 g.<br>
The natural interferon-beta and each interferon-beta mutein were injected to the rats- via tail vein as a test sample. The jugular vein catheter was washed with saline before the blood collection, and 0.3 ml of blood was collected at the time point corresponding to 1, 5, 15, 30, 75, 180, 300 and 480 min after the injection. After the blood collection, the catheter was filled with heparin saline (50 IU/µl) to prevent it from clogging. The collected blood samples were immediately treated with a 4% sodium citrate solution as an anticoagulant to prevent from coagulation, and subjected to centrifugation to separate the plasma except for hemocytes. The separated plasma was stored at -70 °C. The blood concentration of the interferon-beta in the experimental animal was measured by an antiviral test. Fig. 10 shows the blood concentrations of the interferon-beta mutein and the natural interferon-beta remaining in the rats according to time-course. Further, pharmacokinetic constants were calculated from these residual blood concentrations.<br>
The  results  are  shown  in Table  4.     R27T+GNITV  and   R27S+GNITV interferon-beta muteins introduced with two additional sugar chains showed 3-fold prolonged half-life rather than that of the natural interferon-beta, and R27T, R27S and GNITV interferon-beta muteins introduced with one additional sugar chain showed 3-fold prolonged half-life rather than that of the natural interferon-beta. [Table 4] Half-lives of interferon-beta muteins and natural interferon-beta in rats<br>
(Table Removed 4)<br>
As described above, according to the present invention, the interferon-beta muteins having improved or increased activity or ability compared to the natural interferon-beta can be provided.<br>
Since the human interferon-beta muteins of the present invention further contain one or two additional sugar chains compared to the natural human interferon-beta, they show improved or increased antiviral activity, cell growth inhibitory activity, immunoregulatory ability, and prolonged half-life. This means that it is capable of reducing a dose and the number of injection times of human interferon-beta.<br>
Meanwhile, according to the present invention, a gene encoding the interferon-beta mutein, an animal cell expression vector containing the gene, an animal cell trasnfected with the expression vector, a method for preparing the human interferon-beta mutein by culturing the animal cell and a pharmaceutical composition comprising the human interferon-beta are also provided.<br>
