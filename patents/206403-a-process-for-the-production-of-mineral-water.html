FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a process for the production of mineral water.<br>
This invention further relates to a process for the production of mineral water.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The process Known in the art for the production of mineral water involves chemical treatment followed by ion exchange or softening or a combination of softening, chemical treatment and reverse osmosis. Such extraneous treatment entails expenses.<br>
Further, a lot of static equipment is required and the mineral content of the water is also modified to a great extent. Such methods also involve extensive monitoring and control.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of this invention to propose a process for the production of mineral water which does not require any extraneous chemical treatment.<br>
It is a further objection of this invention to propose a process for (he production of mineral water which does not modify the mineral content of water.<br>
Another objection of this invention is a process for the production of mineral water, which is highly efficient.<br>
Yet another objection of this invention is a process for the production of mineral water, which requires very little static equipment and monitoring or control systems and is therefore cost effective.<br>
-2-<br>
These and other objections of the invention wilt be apparent from the ensuing description.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to this invention is provided a process for the production of mineral water comprising the steps of optionally heating source water in a heat chamber, followed by spraying the water from the heal chamber into a vacuum chamber for evaporative cooling, removal of precipitated solids by pre-fittration, followed by filtration and storage of the mineral water thus produced.<br>
In accordance with this invention, in a first stop water flows from Overhead Tank Into the vessel named heat chamber. Water level Is maintained and subjected to electrical heating so that temperature is maintained at 75 ± 50 Or less according to analysis of source water. Direct heating with electrodes of suitable materials and thermostatic control i3 used. The step of heating may not be required for some water with very high bicarbonate content.<br>
Hot gases (mainly containing carbondioxlde CO2 and oxygen O2) and vapours released from the second step under vacuum are again injected into the heat chamber. Bacteria are killed by heat. Chemical reactions taking place for precipitation of Iron and a little Calcium may be represented by the following equations:-<br>
Ferric Hydroxide and Calcium Carbonate are precipitated in very fine state and alongwlth turbidity, of the Inlet raw water Is taken Into the vacuum chamber In step -11 of the process. .<br>
-3-<br>
In the next step i.e step II, hot Water from Heat chamber is sprayed in the vapour space of the Vacuum Chamber. Water gets cooled by evaporative cooling to 21 -25 oC, corresponding to vacuum of 700 - 730 Hg. Excess dissolved Co2 and water vapour are sucked by a vacuum pump. This positive displacement type vacuum pump is the only moving machinery and all other equipment and fittings used for this process are static vessels, columns and filters.<br>
In the vacuum chamber physical transformation of the separated solids occur. Fine precipitates and coloidal suspensions coalose to easily filterable solid sludge. The process of coaugulation is hastened by turbulence due to release of gas &amp; vapours. The precipltated soilds are removed in a pre-filter. Prefiltered water then passes through a column packed with Active Carbon pyrites, sand and membrane. Thus purified mineral water is taken through 0.2 mmicrofiller and then flows into Storage Tank. The nitration through active carbon pyrites helps to remove arsenic.<br>
In case of small domestic units all the components of prefillratlon, Active Carbon filter and micro filters are assembled In the same vacuum chamber.<br>
However, in High capacity industrial units these purification step has to be separately assembled in separate vessels according to suitable design.<br>
Released gases and vapours from the vacuum pump discharge are purified through Active Carbon catch pot and injected to either heat chamber or to product water tank or both.<br>
-4-<br>
The next step i,e, step III comprises of separation of sludges, purification of Vacuum Chamber outlet wafer and also purification of gases, vapours purification and recycling of released carbondioxide.<br>
All odourous organic chemicals are also adsorbed in this column. Prefilter and Active Carbon filters are regenerated by backwashing at regular intervals.<br>
A.C. filter outlet water passes through 0.3 u filter. U.V, purification and ozone treatment may also be provided as optional item for devitalising virt.<br>
Product water thus treated is taken to product storage tank.<br>
Process parameters and controls varies depending on chemical constituents and physical characters of water from source.<br>
Properties of mineral water produced by this new process is compared with name from other process is shown in the Table - I<br>
-5-<br>
Table - I         Characteristics of Mineral Water obtained from New process and<br>
other processes.<br>
Characteristics	Raw Water	Mineral Water (New process)	Mineral Water (other process)	<br>
a)   Physical				<br>
Colour, Hazen	Less than 1	Less than 1		Less than 1<br>
Odour	Agreeable	Agreeable		Agreeable<br>
Turbidity, NTU	0.2	Less than 0.2		Less than 0.2<br>
PH	7.6	7.3		7.2 -7.5<br>
b) Chemical				<br>
TDS, mg/L	390- 560	360-520		200 - 240<br>
Total hardness				<br>
(as CaCo3)mg/L.	365-425	330-390		100- 150<br>
Calcium				<br>
(as Ca) Mg/L.	130	120		45-50<br>
Magnesium				<br>

(as HC03)mg/L	280	300		170-210<br>
Arsenic, Mg./L.	&gt;0.003	Not traceable		Not traceable<br>
Heavy metal and Toxic substances	Within limits of tolerance	Organic Chemicals    Organics are are removed.             Heavy metals Toxic elements are    are further Slightly reduced.        reduced by lON Exchange/Ro		<br>
-6-<br>
It may be seen from above Table 1 that essential minerals content like Calcium, Magnesium remains unaltered in the Mineral Water made by the invented process. Only 5 - 8% reduction in Calcium content, iron. Arsenic, if present in source water is totally eliminated, Alkalinity, Bicarbonate, content increases by 10 - 20% which gives pleasing taste and Is very important Ingredient as an antacid in the digestive system.<br>
This invented process has several distinct advantages over other processes for Mineral Water.<br>
Unlike other processes based on Chemical treatment followed by Ion Exchange or soffaner or soffener/chemical treatment Reverse Osmosis combination, this invented process does not require any extraneous chemical or chemical treatment of water.<br>
Essential mineral content In the mineral water is not modified.<br>
This process requires less than half of static equipment compared to other processes and is highly energy efffcient and cost effective. The process is simple in its operation and does not require monitoring and control, it is very easy to operate, and is therefore ideal for small capacity units (Domestic) and high capcaity industrial units.<br>
Fortification with Carbon Dioxide from external source is not required, High bicarbonate content in mineral water is produced by extraction of Co2 in the raw water and incorporation of the same after purification in the mineral water.<br>
-7-<br>
Absorbents used in this process are mixed with pyrites as addition safe guard against Arsenic, Antimony, Lead, Bismath which are precipitated and removed by backwash.<br>
This new process gives Mineral water with higher shelf life. Drainage and wastage of water from the vessels is not required if water is not used for more than 5 days.<br>
-8-<br>
