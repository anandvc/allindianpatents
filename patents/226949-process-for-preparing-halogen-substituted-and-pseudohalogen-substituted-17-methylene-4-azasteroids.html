Methods for preparing novel compounds and for producing pharmaceutical compositions thereof are described.<br>
The compounds of the invention, 17-methylene~4-azasteroids, are new, their preparation and their biological activity have thus far not been described.<br>
Compounds preferred according to the invention are indicated in Claim 3. Another object of the present invention are pharmaceutical compositions containing as the active ingredient at least one 17-metnyIene-4-azasteroid of general formula I, said compositions optionally containing appropriate auxiliary agents and carriers.<br>
The compounds of the invention are 5a-reductase inhibitors. Hence, they are suitable for the treatment of diseases caused by elevated testosterone levels and finally dihydrotestosterone levels in the blood and tissues.<br>
Diseases induced by excessive androgen effects can also occur at normal blood testosterone levels if the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone in the tissues is elevated. This Is the case, for example, in idiopathic forms of hirsutism (REF).<br>
Progesterone plays an important role in the tight closing of the os of uterus (Mahendroo). The softening thereof before giving birth is a result of local 5ct-reductase-indiic«d degradation of progesterone to dflrydroprogesterone, which is a very weak gestagen. By inhibiting the progesterone cataboUsm in this part of the uterus, the substances of the invention are therefore also<br>
suitable for preventing premature maturation and opening of the os of uterus.<br>
5o&gt;Reduced metabolites of progesterone (REF from Lancet) and other C21-steroids and the metabolites thereof formed in me body, for example aUo-pregnaBolone, can act as neurosteroids and can interact with neurosteroids. Disorders of this function can result in depression. Possible indications for the substances of the invention are prostate diseases, alopecia of the masculine type, acne and hirsutism as well as various gynecological clinical conditions such as the premenstrual syndrome. The appearance of Sa-reduced metabolites of progesterone in the CNS plays an important role in the onset of such conditions. Premature opening of the os of uterus can be induced by increased degradation of progesterone to dihydroprogesterone in this tissue. The substances of the invention are suitable for preventing this catabolism and thus the premature maturation of the cervix uteri. The substances of the invention can exert their action by inhibiting the Sa-reduction of testosterone or progesterone in the organs and tissues affected by this disorder. In addition, the blood levels of the So-reduced metabolites are lowered.<br>
Moreover, the compounds of the invention constitute intermediates for the synthesis of other pharmacologically highly active steroid products.<br>
The compounds of the invention are prepared as indicated in Claims 4 and 5.<br>
According to the invention, the compounds of Claim 1 can be derived from the 17-methylenesteroids of general formula II and general formula VH-<br>

Evaluation of antiandrogenic activity in castrated male rats (see figures/table). Castrated immature male rats were treated for 7 days with testosterone p«»pionale (TP) and the substances of the invention (0.1 mg of TP alone and/or 1 mg of 5a-reductase inhibhor/anlrnal/day, s.c., n = 5 -10/group). The treatment with TP caused a severe increase in weight of the accessory genital glands (prostate and seminal vesicle). In the animals treated with the vehicle and with 5a-reductase inhibitor alone, the weights of the examined organs remained at low values. We found that the substances of the invention exerted an inhibitory effect hi the teat systems selected.<br>
Table XX [sic] shows that the compounds J 1879 and J 1924 weakened appreciably the effects of TP on the prostate and seminal vesicle.<br>
Table:<br>
Inhibition of the action of testosterone propionate (TP) on the growth of the seminal vesicle and prostate. Test on sexually immature, castrated male rats, n = 5 - 10/group, dosage: TP: 0.1 mg/animal/day s.c., Sa-reductase inhibitor, 1 mg/animal/day s.c., difference vehicle controls and. TP controls * 100%.<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
The studies to determine the ICso values of the steroids J 1879 and J 1924 for the 5a-reductase outside the genital tract were carried out in four different human bone cell lines (hOB cells). The cells were incubated for 6 hours with 0.5 uM androstendione (0.1 joM [*H] androstendionc; 0.4 nM androstendione) with or without adding increasing concentrations of the inhibitor (10"11 - \ 0 M).<br>
After the incubation, the medium was extracted with chloroform : metbanol (2 : 1, vol: vol), the steroids (substrate and So-reduced metabolites) were separated by thin-layer chromatography, and the DNA content of the cells of the samples was determined. The 5a-reductase activity (sum of the So-reduced metabolites formed: 5a-androstandione, Sa-dihydrotestosterone, 3a-androstan-3a,17p-diol, 5a-androstan-3p,17p-diol expressed inpmol/jig DNA/h) was determined in duplicate samples. The relative So-reductase activity (Sa-reductase activity of the samples with added inhibitor compared to the corresponding control values, namely those for the samples without added<br>
inhibitor) is shown in the figure always as a mean ± SEM. The ICso values of J 1879 and J 1924 for the Sa-reductase in bone cells amounted to 
In addition, within the framework of studies to determine the ICso values of J 1879 and J 1924, the inhibiting action of LY 191704, a nonsteroidal specific inhibitor of type-1 5a-reductase. finasteride, a 4-azasteroid with inhibiting action mainly on type-2 5a-reductase, and progesterone, a physiological substrate of 5a-reductase, was determined for comparative purposes in all four cell toes at a concentration of 10^ M. It can be seen from the figures that the substances of the invention inhibited the fa-reductase in the cell types studied more strongly and at substantially lower concentrations than did the said natural substrates and reference substances.<br>
