				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method for unhairing animal skins or hides via a total lime and sulfides free enzymatic solution. More particularly, the present invention relates to a process of eco-friendly lime and sulfide free of unhairing using enzymes of animal and/or herbal origin. The total elimination of lime and sulfide in the unhairing process leads to reduced TDS (total dissolved solids), BOD (Biological oxygen demand) and COD (Chemical oxygen demand) in the effluent without affecting the collagen of the skin/hide or the grain pattern.<br>
This process also helps in the complete recovery of hair. These enzymes can be used in leather processing at pH ranging from 4.0 - 10.0 without the addition of lime and sulfide or any solid carriers thereby reducing the TDS of the effluent and the pollution thereof.<br>
The aim of unhairing is to remove the hair at its root along with the epidermal layer so that the hair is preserved in its native form. Unlike in the conventional method in which hair itself is attacked and destroyed by the use of calcium hydroxide and sodium sulfide, when it gets contacted with these chemicals, the objective of this process is the enzymatic removal of epidermal layer so that the hair is loosened or removed at its root.<br><br><br>
Background and Prior art references<br>
Traditionally, lime blended with sodium sulfide is used to remove wool and hair and dissolve these into a pulp. Additionally, this process opens the fiber structure and plumps the hide due to alkalinity. The duration of the process may vary from 18 hours to 7 days depending upon the method employed. This process is responsible for the major parts of the COD load from a tannery due to the chemicals include - 2 to 10% lime and 1 to 4% sodium sulfide. The water polluted with these chemicals and the solubilized hair leads to an increase in alkalinity, organic nitrogen, BOD, COD and TDS. There will be air pollution with hydrogen sulfide and the solid wastes with hair pulp, lime and organic matter forming sludge.<br>
Conventionally, lime in combination with sodium sulfide has been used for the unnairing of hides/skins. For hair loosening and opening up, enzymes that remain sufficiently stable in alkaline pH are also used in addition to lime and sulfide. This later method of operation generally takes place in the pH range from 9-12. Both lime and sulfide and its enzyme supported unhairing process result in the discharge of effluent with high TDS (total dissolved solids) and increased pH that pollutes the soil as well as the ground water and therefore cause irreversible damage to the ecosystem.<br>
Since the discovery of the enzymatic unhairing process in 1910 by Otto Rohm (German Patent No. 268-873), considerable amount of work has been carried out and G.H.Green has given a notable review ((J. Soc. Leather Traders Chemists, 36, 217-232, 1952).<br>
The use of proteases in different partial operations in the beam house has been proposed and also realized in practice. [Cf.E.Pfleiderer and R.Reiner in Biotechnology, Editor H.J.Rehm, pp.729-743, VCH 1988]. In addition, amylases, particularly in combination with proteases, have similarly found an entry into bating operation of the beam house (US pat No. 4,273,876).<br><br>
Most of these enzymes used in beam house operation are of microbial origin. Apart from the microbial enzymes, enzymes of animal origin have also been reported (Christner etal, 1992, US pat No.5, 102,422) for the purpose of bating.<br>
The concurrent use of lipase and amylases (in the form of pancreatin) in the presence of desoxycholic acid is known from Hungarian paten 33 25 (Chem.Abstr. 77, 7341K).<br>
Monsheimer et al 1981 (US Pat NO. 4,273,876) have disclosed a method for the enzymatic bating of pelts with simultaneous removal of scud in acid pH range in the presence of an amylase and a protease of either microbial or pancreatic origin.<br>
Sorenson et al (WO 90/12118) have disclosed a method for unhairing of skins/hides with an aqueous float with a pH value of 3.5 - 5.0 and containing an organic acid and a special carbohydrase.<br>
The purification and characterization of proteases from Calotropis gigantean have been reported by K.I. Abraham and P.M. Joshi. (Biochimica Biophysica Acta, 568, 111-119, and 120-126,1979).<br>
The purification and properties of the enzyme from Carica papaya have been reported by A.K. Balls, H. Lineweaver and R.R. Thomson (Science, 86, p379, 1937) and A.K. Balls and H. Lineweaver (Journal of Biological Chemistry, 130, p669, 1939).<br>
However, the formulations of these enzymes with suitable treatment to impart stability and storability for the application in industries have not been reported so far. Therefore, to avoid expensive purification processes, we have extracted the crude enzyme and processed it by adding suitable buffer, glycerol and preservative with a view to keep the total activity of the enzyme intact.<br>
The proteolytic enzymes of pancreas have been reported by K.A. Walsh (in<br>
Methods in Enzymology, vol 19, 41- 63, 1970). The proteolytic enzyme trypsin and<br>
inactive precursor trypsinogen were first obtained in crystalline form from<br><br>
bovine pancreatic tissue by Northrop, J.H., Kunitz, M. and Herriot, R.M. (Crystalline Enzymes, second edition, Columbia University Press, New York, 1948). The inactive trypsinogen is transformed into active trypsin by trypsin itself or by calcium ions.<br>
The cited enzyme formulation of patent 5,102,422 contains not only the enzymes of microbial and plant origins and also it has many organic compounds that the applicants have not used in this present invention. The enzyme formulation (5,102,422) requires lime for its activity. The distinguished property of enzymes of the present invention is that it does not require lime or sulfide for depilation.<br>
Additionally, enzymes of the present invention, essentially removes the hair along with the epidermal layer which leaves the pelt scud free and white in colour. This evolves a process for hair saving.<br>
The same enzymes of the present invention could also be used in the recovery of value added products from bio-wastes of leather industry for various applications, for e.g., hydrolysis of chrome shavings and fleshing etc.<br>
In the process of unhairing, both the lime and sulfide and its enzyme supported processes result in the discharge of effluent with high TDS, alkalinity, sulfide, organic nitrogen and ammonia. Besides, these processes are responsible for the major part of BOD and COD load, mainly due to the chemicals that include calcium hydroxide and sodium sulfide.<br>
The inventions thus far reported claim to have enzymes for unhairing in the presence of lime or lime and sulfide system or acids. Secondly, the enzyme solutions containing herbal (plant) enzymes in leather processing have not been reported so far.<br>
The enzyme preparations containing pancreatic enzymes have been reported to be useful only for bating and degreasing. Several organic solvents have been reportedly used in the enzyme preparation. These may have adverse effects on the public health and environment particularly at the application level.<br><br>
Moreover, the enzymes that depend mostly on structural organizations for their activity have the tendency of denaturation by organic solvents like any other proteins.<br>
The purification and characterization of proteases from Calotropis gigantea have been reported by K.I. Abraham and P.M. Joshi (Biochimica et Biophysica Acta, 568, 111-119, 120-126, 1979). The purification and properties of the enzyme Carica papaya have been reported by A.K.Balls and H.Lineweaver (Journal of Biological Chemistry, 130, p 669, 1939). However, the formulations of these enzymes with suitable treatment to impart stability and storability for the application in industries have not been reported so far. Therefore, to avoid the expensive purification processes, the applicants have extracted the crude enzyme and processed it by adding suitable buffer, glycerol and preservative with a view to keep the total activity of the enzyme intact.<br>
The proteolytic enzymes of pancreas have been reported by K.A. Walsh (in Methods in Enzymology, vol 19, 41-63, 1970). The proteolytic enzyme trypsin and its inactive precursor, trypsinogen were first obtained in crystalline form from bovine pancreatic tissue by Northrop, J.H., Kunitz, M and Herriot R.M. (Crystalline Enzymes, second edition, Columbia University Press, New York, 1948). The inactive trypsinogen is transformed into active trypsin by trypsin itself or by calcium ions.<br>
Use of many chemicals and solvents in the prior art products (US Pat No. 5,102,422 and 5,525,509) may lead to a number of leather imperfections. The methods followed are also cumbersome and cost defective due to power and water consumption.<br>
The enzyme carriers such as Bentonite, kaolines used in the prior art products at the unhairing stage further contribute to increase the TDS of the effluent.<br>
However, no animal enzymes have be«" reported so far for unhairing in the absence of lime and/or lime and sulfidt stem or acids. Additionally, the<br>
 enzymatic unhairing and bating occurring in a single step has also not been reported yet.<br>
Objectives of the invention<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a novel process for total lime - sulfide free unhairing in skins/hides using animal and/or herbal (plant) enzymes to solve the problems caused by lime or lime and sulfide or lime and sulfide aided enzymatic method of leather processing.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to minimize/avoid water and power consumption and reduces the effluent volume drastically.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to use an enzyme solution for beam house operation that is stable even up to 60°C for at least 6 weeks without loosing its activity for the intended end use areas of the enzymes.<br>
Still another objective of this invention is to use an enzyme solution that is economically and ecologically acceptable for use in leather processing.<br>
Still yet another objective of this invention is to evolve an enzymatic process wherein both lime, lime and sulfide free unhairing and bating taking place simultaneously.<br>
Yet another objective of this invention is to recover the whole hair in its native state as it appears on the animal for its further utilization and to reduce the BOD and COD levels of the effluent discharged.<br>
Still yet another objective of this invention is to remove the hair along with the epidermal layer to obtain scud free white pelt, which is uncommon in other enzymatic or non-enzymatic methods of unhairing.<br>

Additionally, the enzymatic beam house operation facilitates the removal of hair from hide/skin along with the basal layer of epidermis that leaves the pelt white, scud free and undamaged grain ready for tanning that has never been reported so far in any invention or report.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration of the present invention and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
a)	Plant enzyme   preparation  from  exudates:   The   crude  enzyme<br>
preparation was carried out by collecting the exudates over 0.2M<br>
phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing glycerol. The final volume of the<br>
exudate, buffer and the glycerol in the enzyme preparation was in the<br>
ratio of 2:2:1. This was stirred by using a stirrer for 30 minutes to 1 hour<br>
at room temperature to obtain homogenous solution. This enzyme<br>
preparation was filtered through a bed of glass wool and the activity of<br>
the enzyme found to be 60 - 80 U/ml (by Kunitz). This crude enzyme<br>
preparation was used for unhairing process.<br>
b)	Enzyme from plant parts: The fresh part of the plant (any part), after a<br>
preliminary wash with clean water, was homogenized thoroughly with<br><br>
equal part by weight of 0.01M-phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, containing 2% sodium meta bisulphite (w/v) which served as preservative. 15% (w/w) of this enzyme preparation was applied on the flesh side of the skin/hide and left for 20 hours at room temperature for unhairing. c) Preparation of enzyme from animal source: The animal organ(s) after cleaning free of blood and fat, was rinsed once with clean water, homogenized thoroughly with equal volume of 0.1M sodium bicarbonate, pH 8.0 to 9.0 containing 0.2M calcium chloride. Sodium meta bisulfite, 2% (w/w), was then added as preservative and mixed thoroughly. This homogenate was then filtered through nylon mesh and the activity of this crude enzyme solution was found to be 100 -150U/ml solution (by Kunitz).<br>

We found a 65.54% reduction in BOD when compared to the conventional method. In the conventional method, the total BOD is 37kg/ton whereas in our enzymatic method it is only 12.75kg/ton. The COD is reduced to 35.84% and TDS to 42.63% when compared to the conventional method.<br>
The main advantages of the present invention are the following:<br>
1.	The most important advantage is that the process does not require<br>
any lime or sulfide or the chemicals of such kind for its functionality.<br>
In other words, it is a total lime and sulfide free enzymatic method of<br>
unhairing.<br>
2.	The leather process in the beam house operation involving the<br>
inventive enzymes optionally minimizes the consumption of water<br>
and power.<br>
3.	The exciting benefit of this process of unhairing is the removal of hair<br>
from the skin along with the basal layer of epidermis and therefore<br>
facilitates the easy collection of hair or wool and thereby prevents the<br>
formation of bio-sludge.<br>
4.	Yet another advantage of this process is its eco-friendly nature,<br>
because the pulping of hair as occurs in the conventional process<br>
that is responsible for the increased BOD and TDS,  is totally<br>
eliminated.<br>
5.	Yet another advantage of this process of unhairing is the reduction in<br>
the COD level compared to the conventional method.<br>
6.	Still another advantage of this inventive enzymatic unhairing process<br>
is the total prevention of the chemical sludge formation.<br>
7.	Still another advantage of this inventive enzymatic unhairing process<br>
is the minimal handling loss.<br>
8.	Still yet another advantage of this process of unhairing is, obtaining a<br>
scud free white pelt, which may help in improving the color brilliance<br>
of the leather in the post tanning operation.<br>
9.	Still yet another advantage of this enzymatic unhairing process is the<br>
increase in the area of the unhaired skin.<br><br><br><br><br>
