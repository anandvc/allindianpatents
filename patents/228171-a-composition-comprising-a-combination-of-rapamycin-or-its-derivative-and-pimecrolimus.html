IBD In man, like many other chronic inflammatory or autoimmune diseases, can be seen as a result of a convergence of interactions between susceptibility genes, the environment and<br><br>
Che immune system. The extent of interplay t)etween these factors will detemnine the clinical manifestation of disease; Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) and the various cIinical subgroups as defined by severity and location. The leading current hypothesis on the pathogenesis of IBD Is that it is a dysregulated immune response to normal enteric bacterial antigens (see e.g. Wrsner JB, Inflammatory Bowel Disease. 5th ed; W.B. Saunders, p. 208-39. p. 299-304; p. 305-14 and p. 315-25). In both CD and UC the number of lamina propria T lymphocytes Is increased (see e.g. Selby et al. (1984), Gut; 25 (1);32-40), There is evidence, mostly from experimental models such as the SCID-IBD model, that suppressor subsets of T cells prevent a reaction to the normal flora encountered in the gut (see e.g. Groux H, et ai, (1999), ImmunolToday; 20 (10):442-5). In IBD this balance has been disturbed and the ensuing inflammatory cascade develops into a chronic response. The transfer of syngeneic CD4* T cells which express high levels of CD45RB (CD4*CD45RB*^) to SCID mice (SCID-iBD) induces a severe colitis and wasting disease which usually results in death of the mice within 4-8 weeks following transfer of the pathological CD4'CD45RB^ T cells (see e.g. Powrie F et al (1993), IntlmmunoL; 5 (11):1461-71). This severe model of colitis shares many of the features of human IBD and has indeed been used throughout the 1990's to enhance further understanding of the disease in man and is regarded to reflect IBD more than any other model. These Include colitis induced by administration of exogenous agents or by gene manipulation (see e.g. Blumberg RS et al, (1999) Cun-.Opin.Immunol.; 11 (6):648'56; Strober W et al, (1998), Ann.lntem.Med.; 128 (10):848-56; Strober W et al, (1998), Scand.J.lmmunol.; 48 (5):453-8). Using tiie SGID-IBD model, antibodies against TNFa, IFNy and IL-12 have shown transient and partial benefidal effects (see e.g. Powrie F etal (1994). Immunity.; 1 (7):553-62; Simpson SJ, etal (1998), J.Exp.Med.; 187 (8):1225-34; Mackay F et al (1998), Gastroenten^logy; 115 (6):1464-75). More recently, beneficial effects have also been reported with antibodies to the GDI 34 ligand (to OX40L, see e.g. Malmstrom V et al (2001). J.Immunol.; 166 (11):6972-81); to CD154 (see e.g. Liu Z. et al, (2000), J.lmmunol.; 164 (11):6005.14; De Jong YP etal (2000). Gastroenterology; 119 (3):715-23) and to the p7 integrin or MAdCAM-1 (see e.g. Picarella D et al, (1997), J.Immunol.; 158 (5):2099-106). Together these data demonstrate that the disease can be abrogated by inhibition of either the main inflammatory mediators including TNFa. and/or cytokines involved in neutralizing Thi type differentiation and effector function or by interfering with the antigen presentation steps occurring in the lymph nodes or with the process of leucocyte homing of these cells.<br><br>

Example 1 Test methods SCID-IBD Mouse Model<br>
Female BALB/cJ and C.B.I7 scid/scid mice (Fox Chase SCIDÂ®, Bomholtgaard, Denmaric) are maintained in ventilated cage racks (Micro-vent type 84-11, Allentown Caging Equipment Co., Allentown, New Jersey, USA) under specific pathogen free conditions. The experimental procedures performed on the mice are authorized under the license number MA 1048/00 (Magistratabtellung No. 58, Amt der Wiener Landesregierung). Briefly, CD4*CD45RB"' T lymphocytes are isolated from BALB/c mouse spleens by two-colour FACS-sorting through a live/dead gate and injected (2x104 cells/mouse, i.p.) into 6-9 week old female SCID mice. Negative control mice receive PBS i.p. and one such mouse is in each cage as a sentinel to monitor possible infections in this immunodeficient colony (PBS-mice).<br>
SCID mice are first reconstituted witti the CD4*CD45RB*^ T cells and tiien treated witii test compounds or vehicle as controls. As test compounds Compound A (RAD) and pimecroiimus (ASM) are used. 3 separate studies using different dosaging are carried out In each study botii compounds are administered alone and combined. All 3 studies follow the same basic protocol of 4 groups of mice with one group receiving, by daily oral gavage, both vehicles (placebo), one group Compound A alone, one group ASM alone, and one group a combination of Compound A and pimecroiimus, from day 1 to day 29 after cell transfer. Dosages administered:<br>
Study 1: Dosage 1:      Compound A: 0,1 mg/kg/d, ASM: 60mg/kg/d Study 2: Dosage 2:      Compound A: 0.1 mg/kg/d, ASM: 30mg/kg/d, and Study 3: Dosage 3:      Compound A: 0.05 mg/kg/d, ASM: 10 mg/kg/d. The body weight of each mouse is monitored throughout and at the end of the study mice are weighed.<br>
The mice are anaesthetized at the end of tiie study and blood withdrawn via cardiac puncture for separation into serum which is frozen and stored at -80Â°. Blood is also taken Into 10 mM EDTA for preparation for FACS analysis. The spleen and MLN are taken from each mouse, weighed and processed for FACS analysis of single cell suspensions.<br>
A photographic picture is taken of the opened abdominal cavity and tiien a 1cm long piece of tiie colon. Just above the rectum, is fixed in formalin for histology. Specimens are embedded in paraffin, sections (3 pm thick) are cut and stained witii H &amp; E.<br><br>
Four colour FACS analysis is performed on cell suspensions prepared from the blood,<br>
spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) of each mouse.<br>
Antibodies are obtained from Pharmingen. Cells which are double positive for CDS and CD4<br>
are counted as lymphocytes. Cells positive for Ly-6G (myeloid differentiation antigen) and<br>
negative for CDS or CD4 are neutrophils (also their cellular characteristics (forward and side<br>
scatter) distinguishes them from the other cells).<br>
The number of cells per sample is calculated from the total cell number In each cell<br>
suspension and the % of positively identified (samples analysed on a FACS Calibur** using<br>
CellQuest ProÂ® software) cells per sample.<br>
The mean of these values for a group of mice can thus be calculated. To process some of<br>
the data furtiier, the determined values are adjusted by subtracting the background value<br>
found in non-transferred mice and calculating the % reduction, or indeed increase, in mean<br>
cell number, relative to the placebo treated group.<br>
All data presented as mean values are qualified by an s.e.m. value. The body weight data<br>
are analysed eitiier by repeated measures analysis or by first finding the mean AUC and<br>
then applying an ANOVA multiple comparison test with Tukey post hoc con^ction. Histology<br>
scores are represented as the mean severity score and compared v^th a Wilcoxon-Mann-<br>
Whitney test with exact p-values (StatXact-5 software) and Bonferroni post hoc correction<br>
factor All otiier data are first analysed for normal distribution and then tiie ANOVA test for<br>
multiple comparison is applied. Statistical significance is taken as p
The developing reaction in the SCID mouse to tiie ti^nsfer of CD4*CD45RB^ T cells shows that T cell expansion is the first event and the inflammatory sequelae follow, v^rtiich can be measured as a critical loss of body weight, a severe colon inflammab'on and systemic signs such as increased serum haptoglobin levels and neutrophilia. The increasing T cell population with time also results in an increase in size of lymphoid organs which are otherwise comparatively small in the non-transferred SCID mouse. By day 28 post T cell transfer the Inflammation is relatively consistent within a group of mice and this has been adopted as the shortest time where accurate effects of treatinent with test compounds can be measured. The effects of a range of doses of Compound A and ASM as single preventative compounds are, in brief, comparative effective dose ranges are found to be from 30 to 100 mg/kg/d adminlstiation of ASM and 0.1 to Img /kg/d of Compound A In the present tests sub-maximal doses of each compounds are used and the effect of the single and combined treatment in the same study is determined.<br><br>
Results<br>
Synergistic effect of combined treatment of SCID-IBD mice with Compound A and ASM on the loss of body weight<br>
The first yislble symptom resulting from the transfer of disease causing CD4*CD45RB** T ceils to SCID mice is a severe loss of body weight, usually significant 21 days after transfer. These mice (designated as placebo in these studies, e.g. in the Figures) continue to lose body weight until death occurs, generally 4 to 8 weeks after cell transfer. Non-transferred mice (designated as "PBS(-mouse)" in the Figures) remain stable or gain weight in the course of the study, in the 3 individual studies described herein, the mean % difference in body weight between the non-transferred and the vehicle-treated mice is calculated to be 16.3 Â±1.8%.<br>
If transfen-ed SCID mice are treated with Compound A alone or with ASM alone, a significant, but low inhibition of weight loss is only found for mice treated with ASM at a dosage of 60 mg/l<g whereas thus dosages used of either compound alone have only minor effects on the loss body weight a combined administration and asm has significant protective effect even at lowest doses mg see e.g. figure since dosage administered no or small cannot be additive but is synergistic.></g>
Further data (not shown) has been obtained which confirms the synergistic effect of a<br>
combination according to the present invention.<br>
In short, we have found a synergistic effect of a combination of ASM and Compound A in the<br>
SCID-IBD model, when using sub-maximal doses of 60, 30 and 10 mg/kg/d of ASM and 0.1,<br>
0.1 and 0.05 mg/kg/d of Compound A, respectively. The dose of 60 mg/kg/d of ASf^ alone<br>
still elicited significant effects on its own but all other single treatment groups resulted in only<br>
mild disease inhibition.<br>
Specifically we have obtained the following results:<br>
- All three combinations, most strikingly also the lowest doses of 10 mg/kg/d of ASM and<br>
0.05mg/kg/d of Compound A, results In no loss of body weight (data shown, see Figures 1<br>
to 3)<br><br>
-	At the low dose combinations of 10 and 0.05 mg/kg/d a synergistic effect on the colon inflammation is shown. Either compound alone had very little effect, whilst the severity scores In the combined treatment group are mostly mild (data not shown),<br>
-	ASM potently reduces serum haptoglobin levels at 60 and 30mg/kg/d whilst Compound A is very weakly active at 0.1 or 0.05 mg/kg/d. Again, synergism is evident in the low dose study where the % reduction of each compound alone was 32,7% (ASM 10 mg/kg/d) or 27.4% (Compound A, 0.05mg/kg/d) whereas the combined treatment group is significantly inhibited by 81.0% (data not shown).<br>
â€¢ In the low dose study there is no significant reduction in lymphocyte numbers in any of the treatment groups, although the numbers in the combined group are reduced (46,5,19.0 and 48.0% in blood, spleen and MLN, respectively) relative to vehicle-treated mice. In the study where ASM and Compound A are given at higher doses (30 mg/kg/d and 0.1 mg/kg/d, respectively; study 2) there are significant reductions in lymphocyte numbers (73.0,80.3 and 90.7% In blood, spleen and MLN, respectively) whereas numbers in the single treatment groups (ASM or Compound A, respectively, administered alone) are not reduced. Similarly, with tiie higher dose of ASM (60 mg/kg/d; study 1), which alone decreases lymphocyte numbers specifically in the MLN (73.5%), the combination with Compound A (0.1 mg/kg/d) results in significant reductions in both blood (65.4%) and spleen (64.8%) in addition to an enhanced reduction (93.2%) in tiie MLN, The dose of 0.1 mg/kg/d of Compound A alone has only weak, if any effects on lymphocyte numbers.<br>
ASM981 combined with Compound A acts svnerqisticallv to reduce colon inflammation in SCiD-lBD mice<br>
The inflammation in the colon of SCID-IBD mice shares many features observed in lesional tissue of a Crohn's diseased colon. In order to examine the intestinal mucosal damage in SCID-IBD mice a histological examination of the colon sections was performed according to defined morphological parameters. The severe colitis associated with this model of IBD is characterized with a massive cellular infiltrate which in places involves nearly all of the submucosa. The infiltrate is mixed and comprised of lymphocytes, macrophages, neutrophils and some eosinophils. Also evident is the loss of crypt archltechjre, extensive elongation and epithelial hyperplasia. A severely inflamed colon section will also have crypt abscesses. Numeric scores were given as per the following scheme: a score of 0 to 3 is given for the leucocyte infiltrate where 11s mild, 2 is moderate and 3 is a severe infiltrate including the submucosal layer. A score of 0 to 2 is given for Goblet cell depletion where 2 is given for a<br><br>
complete lack of the alcian blue staining, 0 is given for a normal amount of staining and 1 is intermediate. A score of 0 to 3 is given for mucosal hyperplasia and degenerative changes which include crypt elongation, epithelial hyperplasia, presence of crypt abscesses, erosions and epithelial necrosis. The maximum possible score is 8 and (PBS)-mlce are scored 0. We find that the dose of 60mg/kg/d ASM981 alone has a significant effect. Doses of Compound A below 0.5mg/kg/d are not significantly active and also not in this model. However, the two compounds together reduce the inflammation (Figure 5) to mild levels (scores below 4) that could not be achieved by the additive effects of each alone. In conclusion, in the SCID-IBD model, at dosages which alone have minimal effects, combined treatment with pimecrolimus and Compound A results in highly significant prevention of the disease. The strong effect we see on body weight and colon inflammation does not con-elate with the lymphocyte numbers alone. The synergistic effect is not exclusive to lymphocyte numbers but may be affecting lymphocyte activity or function as well as other cells involved in the disease. These data confirm that a combination of pimecrolimus and Compound A act synergistically in the SCID-IBD mouse model.<br>

Example 3<br>
Utility of a compound of formula II in treating diseases and conditions as specified herein<br>
A) In vivo: Activity After Topical Administration In Model of Allergic or Allergen-induced Contact Dermatitis A1) Oxazolone Allergy (Mouse):<br><br>
10 Ml of a 2% oxazolone solution are applied onto the abdominal skin of mioe for sensitization. 8 days later a second exposure with 10 Î¼l of a 2% oxazolone solution is perfomied by application on the peripheral internal surface of the pinna. 20 minutes and 2 hours after the second exposure has released the challenge reaction, the test solution is applied at the site of the second exposure. Evaluation of the inhibition of inflammation with the test substance is effected by reference to an untreated group treated with the solvent used for dissolving the test substance, alone. 24 hours after the second exposure the animals are killed and the separated pinnae are weighted. The difference in weight between the two pinnae is used for evaluation; the individual differences in the test group and in the solvent control group are statistically compared (by simple variance analysis with subsequent Dunnet Test by normal distribution test if nonnally distributed, otherwise by Kruskal-Wallis litest and Wilcoxon-Mann-Witney U-test). A2) Dintrofiuorobenzene (DNFB) Allergy (Swine):<br>
The use of DNFB or dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) for inducing a contact allergy is a classical experimental approach v/hich is also being used in humans (P.S.Friedmann and C.Moss, IVIodels in dermatology, 1987, IVIaibach, Lowe, Ed., Vol.2, p.275-281, Karger-Basel). In view of the resemblance between porcine and human sicin a corresponding model for topical testing of substances is built up in the swine, on the 1^ and 3"^ day 100 MI each of a 10% DNFB preparation is applied to the inner surface of the right and, respectively, left thigh. On the 14*^ day each swine is marked on the right and the left side of the back with circular markings of 5 cm in diameter (8 markings per animal) and 150 yl each of a 5% DNFB preparation is applied thereon. The substances are tested either in the fomn of galenic compositions or of a solution. The carriers are used in each case as placebo controls. The test products are carefully applied 4 times (first 20 minutes, then 6, 24 and 32 hours after release of challenge reaction). Prior to each application the test areas are evaluated with respect to reddening, swelling and consistence. The coloration of the test areas is then determined quantitatively with a reflectometer, repeatedly. From the data of brightness (L*) and saturation (C*) the erythema index is computed according to the following formula: 100 - L* X C*. The mean erythema index is a reflection of the activity acconding to the<br><br><br>
B) in vivo: Activity After Topical Administration in the Irritant-Induced Dermatitis IModei (mouse):<br>
B1) 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate /TPA) -induced Dermatitis:<br>
Irritation with TPA in test animals is a method for testing substances as to their antiinflammatory activity after local application (Maibach, Lowe, Ed. Models in Dermatology, Vol. 3,1987, p.86-92, Karger-Basel). NI^RI mice are given 10 pi of a TPA solution on tl-je inner and outer side of the right pinna (2x10 l/mouse = 2 x 0,5 pi TPA/mouse). The left pinnae remain untreated. Treatment is effected 30 minutes after initation. by application of 2 x pi of test solution onto the irritated ear surfaces, as described above. The evaluation of the test group is performed by comparison with a group where the right pinna has been treated with only the irritating solution and with the solvent used for the test substance. 6 hours after application of the irritant the animals are killed, the pinnae separated and weighed. The difference in weight of the two pinnae is used for the evaluation, whereby the individual differences of the test groups are statistically compared with the individual differences of the control groups (as under A1).<br>
B2) Dermatitis Induced By Croton Oil<br>
Croton oil may be used, as TPA, in order to induce an im'tant-induced dermatitis on which substances can be tested for their anti-inflammatory acdvity (Maibach, Lowe, Ed., Model in Dennatology, Vol.3,1987, p.86-92, Karger-Basel). NMRI-mice are given 15 pi of 0.23% croton oil (in a mixture of dimethylacetamide, acetone and ethanol 2/4/4) on the inner side of the right pinna. Treatment is effected simultaneously with the Initation, the test substance being dissolved in the solution of irritant applied at the auricular test site. Evaluation of the test group is perfomied by comparison of the inflammation with a group receiving only the irritant solution on the pinna. The animals are killed 6 hours after application of the irritant, the pinnae separated and weighted. The difference between the weights of the two individual pinnae is used for evaluation by statistical comparison of the single differences in the test group with the single differences in the control group (as under A1).<br><br>
C) In vivo: Atopic Dermatitis (human):<br>
in a randomized, double-blind study, 7 to 12 patients (in total) with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis are treated twice daily for 3 weeks with a composition comprising 0.05 to 2% by weight of a compound of formula 11 (based on tiie total weight of the composition) over a defined, symptomatic area of 200 to 1000 cm2 of skin. The change in the summary score for erythema, odema and pruritus between first and last days of treatment is evaluated. Local toierability of study medications and routine safety parameters, including haematology and clinical chemistry, are recorded.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
