DESCRIPTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel compounds, substituted<br><br>
[2-(1-piperazinyl)ethoxy]methyl compounds of formula<br>
in which<br>
R]_ represents a -CONH2, -CN, -COOH, -COOM or -COOR3 group, M being an<br>
alkali metal and R3 being an alkyl radical having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms;<br>
and<br>
R2 represents a hydrogen atom or a group -COR4 or -Rg, where R4 is<br>
chosen from the groups -ORg or -R-j, in which<br>
Rg represents an allyl or alkylaryl radical,<br>
Rg represents a linear or branched alkyl radical having from 1 to 4<br>
carbon atoms, a haloalkyl, alkylaryl, alkylnitroaryl or alkylhaloaryl<br>
radical, and<br>
R7 represents a haloalkyl radical,<br>
to a process for the preparation of these compounds, and to their use for the<br>
preparation of compounds of formula<br>
(Figure Remove) in which R]_ has the same meaning as in formula I and X]_ and X2<br>
independently represent a hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine or bromine atom. In<br>
the case where R]_ represents a -COOH group and where X^_ represents a chlorine<br>
atom in position 4 and X2 represents a hydrogen atom, the compound of formula<br>
II is 2-[2-[4-[(4-chlorophenyl)phenylmethyl]-1-piperazinyl]ethoxy]acetic acid<br>
of formula<br>
CH-N NCH9-CH7-0- 2 ~ ' 'in)<br>
In the case where R^_ represents a -CONH2, -CN, -COOM or -COOR3 group, M being<br>
an alkali metal and R3 being an alkyl radical having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms<br>
and where X]_ represents a chlorine atom in position 4 and X2 a hydrogen atom,<br>
the compounds of formula II are valuable intermediates for the preparation of<br>
2-[2-[4-[(4-chlorophenyl)phenylmethyl]-1-piperazinyl]ethoxy]acetic acid of<br>
formula III, as well as pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.<br>
2-[2-[4-[(4-Chlorophenyl)phenylmethyl]-1-piperazinyl]ethoxy]acetic acid<br>
dihydrochloride, a product which is also known under the common international<br>
name of cetirizine, is described in Canadian patent 1,199,918 and has been<br>
introduced as a medicament for the treatment of allergic syndromes, for<br>
instance chronic and acute allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis,<br>
pruritus, urticaria, etc. In its therapeutic application, this product<br>
proved to be remarkably free of side effects on the central nervous system,<br>
such as drowsiness, attenuated mental performance, etc. (cfr. D.P. TASHKIN<br>
et al., Annals of Allergy, Part II, 59_, (1981) , 49-52, as well as F.M. GENGO et<br>
al., Annals of Allergy, Part II, 59,(1987),53-57).<br>
In the case where R^_ represents a -COOH group and where X]_ and X2 each<br>
represent a fluorine atom in position 4, the compound of formula II is 2-<br>
[2-[4-[bis (4-fluorophenyl)methyl]-l-piperazinyl]ethoxy]acetic acid of formula<br>
CH-N N CH-CH-0 CH<br>
In the case where R]_ represents a -CONH2, -CN, -COOM or -COOR3 group, M being<br>
an alkali metal and R3 being an alkyl radical having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms<br>
and where X^_ and X2 each represent a fluorine atom in position 4, the<br>
compounds of formula II are valuable intermediates for the preparation of<br>
2-[2-[4-[bis (4-fluorophenyl)methyl]-l-piperazinyl]ethoxy]acetic acid of formula<br>
IV as well as pharmaceutically acceptable salts.<br>
2-[2-[4-[Bis (4-f luorophenyl) me thy l]-l-piperazinyl]ethoxy]ace tic acid<br>
dihydrochloride is also known under the common international name of<br>
efletirizine. The use of efletirizine for the treatment of rhinitis or<br>
rhino-conjunctivitis of allergic origin has been suggested in several recent<br>
communications (51st Annual Meeting or American Academy of Allergy and<br>
Immunology, reproduced in J. Allergy Clin. Immunol., 95/1 (1995), part 2,<br>
Abstract 229 and XV^ Congress of Allergology and Clinical Immunology,<br>
reproduced in Allergy &amp; Clin. Immunol. News, (1994) suppl. No. 2, abstracts<br>
428, 1136, 1496 and 1864). These communications indicate that the intranasal<br>
administration of efletirizine might provide an effective therapeutic<br>
treatment of rhinitis or rhino-conjunctivitis of allergic origin.<br>
Canadian patent 1,199,918, in the name of the Applicant, describes the<br>
synthesis of 2-[2-[4-[(4-chlorophenyl)phenylmethyl]-1-<br>
piperazinyl]ethoxy]acetic acid and its dihydrochloride. In this synthesis,<br>
the starting material is 1-[(4-chlorophenyl)phenylmethyl]piperazine, which<br>
may be reacted with methyl (2-chloroethoxy)acetate or<br>
2-(2-chloroethoxy)acetamide to form respectively methyl 2-[2-[4-[(4-<br>
chlorophenyDphenylmethyl]-1-piperazinyl]ethoxy]acetate (compound of formula<br>
II with R! = -COOCH3, Xx = -Cl (position 4) and X2 = -H) or 2-[2-[4-[(4-<br>
chlorophenyDphenylmethyl]-1-piperazinyl]ethoxy]acetamide (compound of<br>
formula II with R1 = -CONH2, X-^ = -Cl (position 4) and X2 = -H) . This methyl<br>
ester as well as this acetamide may then be subjected to hydrolysis with an<br>
inorganic base (potassium or sodium hydroxide) to form the sodium or<br>
potassium salt, which is readily converted into cetirizine and its<br>
dihydrochloride.<br>
Canadian Patent 1,320,732, also in the name of the Applicant, gives an<br>
alternative synthetic route for the preparation of 2-[2-[4-[(4-<br>
chlorophenyl)phenylmethyl]-1-piperazinyl]ethoxy]acetic acid and its<br>
dihydrochloride.<br>
According to that patent, 2- [2- [4- [ (4-chlorophenyl)phenylmethyl] -1--<br>
piperazinyl] ethoxy] acetic acid and its dihydrochloride are prepared by a<br>
process which is characterized in that 2-[4-[(4-chlorophenyl)phenylmethyl]-1-<br>
piperazinyl]ethanol is reacted with an alkali metal haloacetate, in the<br>
presence of an alkali metal alkoxide, and in that the alkali metal salt thus<br>
obtained is converted into the corresponding acid and, where appropriate,<br>
into its dihydrochloride.<br>
Canadian patent 1,317,300, also in the name of the Applicant provides another<br>
synthetic process which makes it possible to prepare 2-[2-[4-[(4-<br>
chlorophenyl)phenylmethyl]-1-piperazinyl]ethoxy]acetic acid and its<br>
dihydrochloride.<br>
According to that patent, 2-[2-[4-[(4-chlorophenyl)phenylmethyl]-1-<br>
piperazinyl]ethoxy]acetic acid and its dihydrochloride are prepared by a<br>
process which is characterized in that 2-[2-[4-[(4-<br>
chlorophenyl)phenylmethyl]-1-piperazinyl]ethoxy]acetonitrile (compound of<br>
formula II with R]_ = -CN, X^ = -Cl (position 4) and X2 = -H) is hydrolysed in<br>
aqueous, alcoholic or aqueous-alcoholic medium and with a base or with an<br>
acid, and in that the acid thus obtained is converted, where appropriate,<br>
into its dihydrochloride.<br>
The 2-[2-[4-[(4-chlorophenyl)phenylmethyl]-1-piperazinyl]ethoxy]acetonitrile<br>
used as starting material is obtained by reacting l-[(4-<br>
chlorophenyl)phenylmethyl]piperazine with a 2-haloethoxyacetonitrile.<br>
This reaction is carried out in the presence of an acid acceptor, such as an<br>
alkali metal carbonate, and optionally in the presence of a small amount of<br>
alkali metal iodide to accelerate the reaction, in an inert organic solvent<br>
such as an alcohol (for example n-butanol, etc.), preferably at a temperature<br>
in the region of the reflux temperature.<br>
Given the increasing therapeutic value of cetirizine and of compounds of<br>
similar structure, the Applicant set itself the objective and undertook<br>
research studies with the aim of developing a new synthetic route to 2-[2-[4-<br>
[(4-chlorophenyl)phenylmethyl]-1-piperazinyl]ethoxy]acetic acid and<br>
-pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof which would make it possible to<br>
obtain this compound from known and/or readily accessible reagents and which<br>
would moreover provide this compound in a sufficient purity and an<br>
economically acceptable yield. Moreover, for the purpose of simplifying the<br>
industrialization of the process, the Applicant set itself the further<br>
objective of developing a synthetic route which might have fewer steps than<br>
the known processes.<br>
In addition, given the therapeutic value of other compounds of formula II,<br>
such as efletirizine for example, it would be advantageous for these other<br>
compounds to be able to be prepared according to essentially similar<br>
processes.<br>
Consequently, it is necessary to find precursors which, on the one hand, may<br>
themselves be prepared readily and economically, and, on the other hand, may<br>
be converted readily and in high yields into compounds of formula II.<br>
The Applicant has just discovered a family of compounds, namely substituted<br>
[2-(1-piperazinyl)ethoxy]methyl compounds which satisfy this objective<br>
entirely.<br>
The subject of the present invention is thus, as novel compounds, substituted<br>
[2-(1-piperazinyl)ethoxy]methyl compounds of formula<br>
R; N N—CH-CH-O—CH-R1<br>
in which<br>
R! represents a -CONH2, -CN, -COOH, -COOM or -COOR3 group, M being an<br>
alkali metal and R3 being an alkyl radical having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms;<br>
and<br>
R2 represents a hydrogen atom or a group -COR^ or -Rg, where R^ is<br>
chosen from the groups -ORg or -Ry, in which<br>
R5 represents an allyl or alkylaryl radical,<br>
Rg represents a linear or branched alkyl radical having from 1 to 4<br>
carbon atoms, a haloalkyl, alkylaryl, alkylnitroaryl or alkylhaloaryl<br>
radical, and<br>
R-y represents a haloalkyl radical.<br>
These compounds may readily be obtained by reaction of a piperazine of<br>
formula<br>
(Figure Remove)in which R2 represents a hydrogen atom or a group -COR or<br>
-R5, where R4 is chosen from the groups -ORg or -R7/ in which R5 represents<br>
an allyl or alkylaryl radical, Rg represents a linear or branched alkyl<br>
radical having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, a haloalkyl, alkylaryl,<br>
alkylnitroaryl or alkylhaloaryl radical, and R7 represents a haloalkyl,<br>
with a substituted [2-haloethoxy]methyl of formula<br>
X-CH-CH-0 CH~R1 (VI)<br>
in which R± represents a -CONH2, -CN, -COOH, -COOM or -COOR3 group, M being<br>
an alkali metal and R3 being an alkyl radical having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms<br>
and X represents a halogen atom. Usually, a compound of formula VI is used<br>
in which X represents a chlorine or iodine atom, but this reaction may also<br>
be carried out with the corresponding bromide. It has been observed that<br>
when X represents an iodine atom, it is advantageous to work at fairly low<br>
temperatures (below 40°C) and for relatively short times (2 hours for<br>
example).<br>
This reaction is generally carried out by heating to between 30 and 180°C,<br>
for several hours, in a solvent chosen from aliphatic alcohols, aliphatic<br>
ketones (for example methyl ethyl ketone), aromatic hydrocarbons (for example<br>
toluene or xylene) or alternatively in water and, in the presence of an acid<br>
acceptor such as a tertiary organic base (for example triethylamine) or an<br>
inorganic base (for example sodium carbonate). When a large excess of<br>
piperazine (more than three equivalents relative to the [2-haloethoxy]methyl)<br>
is used, the piperazine itself acts as acid acceptor and it is not essential<br>
to add an additional acid acceptor. Advantageously, a piperazine and its<br>
dihydrochloride may also be used in equivalent amounts.<br>
In general, in order to prepare the substituted [2-(1-piperazinyl)-<br>
ethoxy]methyl compounds of the invention, it is preferred, for obvious<br>
reasons of simplicity, to use the piperazine of formula V in which R2<br>
represents a hydrogen atom. It may nevertheless prove wise to protect one of<br>
the amine functions of the piperazine during this reaction with a<br>
conventional protecting group for this function in order to prevent the<br>
piperazine from reacting twice with the compound of formula VI.<br>
As protecting group for the amine function, any protecting group known <br>
those skilled in the art for this purpose may be used.<br>
To this end, it is possible to choose a protecting group which, after<br>
formation of the compound of formula I, may be selectively cleaved off<br>
according to the equation:<br>
Protecting groups which are particularly suitable in this case are for<br>
example haloalkyl, alkylhaloaryl, alkylaryl, alkylnitroaryl, and<br>
alkylhaloaryl carbamates, amides such as trifluoroacetamide or alternatively<br>
tertiary amines, such as N-allylamines or N-alkylarylamines.<br>
With these groups, the reaction for the deprotection of the amine function of<br>
the piperazine may be carried out by a simple heating, by catalytic<br>
hydrogenation or by hydrolysis by means of a base or an acid, according to<br>
techniques which are well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
According to one variant, as protecting group for the amine function, a group<br>
may also be chosen which may be cleaved off under conditions such that, in<br>
the case where R]_ represents a -CONH2, -CN, -COOM or -COOR3 group, M being an<br>
alkali metal and R3 being an alkyl radical having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms,<br>
simultaneously with the reaction for deprotection of the amine function, the<br>
group R]_ is converted into a -COOH group, and, in the case where R-j_<br>
represents a -COOH group, this -COOH group is conserved during the reaction<br>
for deprotection of the amine function.<br>
This reaction is carried out according to the equation:<br>
CH-CH-0—CH-R HN N—CH-CH~0—CH-—COOH<br>
Protecting groups which are particularly suitable in this case are for<br>
example alkyl carbamate groups.<br>
With such carboxylated groups, the amine function of the piperazine may be<br>
deprotected by heating for several hours in alcoholic or aqueous medium in<br>
the presence of an inorganic base or by any other conventional method known<br>
to those skilled in the art.<br>
In the two preceding equations,<br>
Rl represents a -CONH2, -CN, -COOH, -COOM or -COOR3 group, M being an<br>
alkali metal and R3 being an alkyl radical having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms;<br>
and<br>
R2 represents a hydrogen atom or a group -COR^ or -R$, where R4 is<br>
chosen from the groups -ORg or -R7, in which<br>
R5 represents an allyl or alkylaryl radical,<br>
Rg represents a linear or branched alkyl radical having from 1 to 4<br>
carbon atoms, a haloalkyl, alkylaryl, alkylnitroaryl or alkylhaloaryl<br>
radical, and<br>
R-j represents a haloalkyl radical.<br>
The substituted [2-(1-piperazinyl)ethoxy]methyl compounds of formula I thus<br>
prepared find their main value as precursors for the preparation of compounds<br>
of formula II (or compounds of formulae III and IV in the case where R^<br>
represents a -COOH group) which may thus be prepared in sufficient purity, in<br>
an economically acceptable yield, in fewer steps and starting from the same<br>
precursors, which represents an appreciable advantage as regards simplifying<br>
the industrial process and reducing the production costs.<br>
Consequently, the present invention also relates to the preparation of<br>
compounds of formula II (or compounds of formulae III and IV in the case<br>
where R-j_ represents a -COOH group) by reaction of a compound of (Figure Remove)<br>
which R2 represents a hydrogen atom with a diphenylmethyl halide of formula<br>
VII according to the equation:<br>
(Figure Remove)R-L represents a -CONH2, -CN, -COOH, -COOM or -COOR3 group, M being an<br>
alkali metal and Rj being an alkyl radical having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms;<br>
and<br>
X' represents a halogen atom chosen from chlorine, bromine and iodine,<br>
Xj_ and X2 independently represent a hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine or<br>
bromine atom.<br>
This reaction is carried out by reacting the diphenylmethyl halide of formula<br>
VI with the compound of formula I in molar proportions of between 4:1 and 1:4<br>
for a period of between a few minutes and several hours at a temperature<br>
between about 60 and about 160°C, in an inert solvent chosen from aliphatic<br>
alcohols, aliphatic ketones (for example methyl ethyl ketone), aromatic<br>
hydrocarbons (for example toluene or xylene), aliphatic nitriles (for example<br>
acetonitrile). It is optionally possible to carry out the reaction in the<br>
presence of an acid acceptor such as a tertiary organic base (for example<br>
triethylamine) or an inorganic base (for example sodium carbonate). This<br>
reaction may optionally be carried out in the presence of an alkali metal<br>
- iodide.<br>
As indicated above, the compounds of formula II (in which R]_ represents a<br>
--CONH2 , -CN, -COOM or -COOR3 group, M being an alkali metal and R3 being an<br>
alkyl radical having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, Xx represents a chlorine atom<br>
in position 4 and X2 a hydrogen atom) are already known and their conversion<br>
into 2-[2-[4-[(4-chlorophenyl)phenylmethyl]-1-piperazinyl]ethoxy]acetic acid<br>
of formula III has already been described in aqueous, alcoholic or aqueousalcoholic<br>
medium, and with a base or with an acid. Moreover, the compound of<br>
formula II in which R]_ represents a -COOH group and X]_ represents a chlorine<br>
atom in position 4 and X2 a hydrogen atom, is 2-[2-[4-[(4-<br>
chlorophenyl)phenylmethyl]-1-piperazinyl]ethoxy]acetic acid of formula III.<br>
Thus, for the subsequent conversion of the alkyl 2-[2-[4-[(4-<br>
chlorophenyl)phenylmethyl]-1-piperazinyl]ethoxy]acetate (compound of formula<br>
II with R-L = -COOR3, X-L = -Cl in position 4 and X2 = -H) or 2-[2-[4-[ (4-<br>
chlorophenyl)phenylmethyl]-1-piperazinyl]ethoxy]acetamide (compound of<br>
formula II with R]_ = -CONH2, X]_ = -Cl in position 4 and X2 = -H) into 2-<br>
[2-[4-[(4-chlorophenyl)phenylmethyl]-1-piperazinyl]ethoxy]acetic acid of<br>
formula III, reference is made to Canadian patent 1,199,918 and for<br>
conversion of the 2-[2-[4-[(4-chlorophenyl(phenylmethyl]-1-<br>
piperazinyl] ethoxy] acetonitrile (compound of formula II with R]_ = <br>
Cl in position 4 and X2 = -H), reference is made to Canadian patent<br>
1,317,300.<br>
For the conversion of the other compounds of formula II, the process is<br>
performed analogously.<br>
The examples which follow illustrate the invention without however limiting<br>
it. In these examples, the melting points were determined by differential<br>
scanning calorimetry (D.S.C.) with a temperature gradient of 20°C/min. The<br>
mass spectra were recorded with a Finnigan MAT TSQ 700 machine. The nuclear<br>
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded with a Bruker machine at<br>
250 MHz in dimethyl sulphoxide using tetramethylsilane as internal standard.<br>
The chemical shifts are indicated in 8 (ppm). The letters s, d, dd, t, q, b<br>
and m respectively indicate a singlet, a doublet, a doubled doublet, a<br>
triplet, a quartet, a broad peak and a multiplet.<br>

acetone and stirred for 30 minutes at room temperature. The insoluble<br>
material is filtered off and the filtrate is concentrated on a rotary<br>
evaporator under reduced pressure. 8.5 g of a brown oil are obtained, which<br>
product is purified by preparative chromatography on silica gel (eluent:<br>
89/10/1 (v/v/v) mixture of dichloromethane/methanol/28% aqueous ammonia<br>
solution gradually replaced by a 78/20/2 (v/v/v) mixture of the same<br>
constituents). 3.4 g (34.8%) of 2-[4-[bis(4-fluorophenyl)methyl]-lpiperazinyl]<br>
ethoxy]acetic acid are obtained in the form of a colorless oil.<br>

IV. 3 .1. (2-[4-[Bis (4-fluorophenyl)methyl]-!-piperazinyl]ethoxy) acetamide.<br>
2.85 g (0.01 mol) of (4-chlorophenyl)phenylmethane bromide, 4.1 g (0.022 mol)<br>
of 2-(1-piperazinyl)ethoxyacetamide and 10 ml of acetonitrile are introduced<br>
into a 50 ml three-necked round-bottomed flask fitted with a water-cooled<br>
condenser and a magnetic stirrer. The mixture is brought at reflux for 2<br>
hours. The mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature. The mixture is<br>
concentrated on a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure and the residue is<br>
taken up in 25 ml of water and 50 ml of dichloromethane. The pH of the<br>
aqueous phase is brought to 14 with IN NaOH solution. The organic phase is<br>
separated out after settling has taken place and reextraction is then carried<br>
out with 50 ml of dichloromethane. The organic phases are combined, washed<br>
•with saturated sodium chloride solution, dried over magnesium sulphate,<br>
filtered and concentrated on a rotary evaporator at 50°C. 4.14 g of a yellow<br>
oil are obtained, which product is purified by preparative chromatography on<br>
silica gel (eluent: 98.9/1/0.1 (v/v/v) mixture of dichloromethane/<br>
methanol/28% aqueous ammonia solution gradually replaced by a 95.6/4/0.4<br>
(v/v/v) mixture of the same constituents). 3.4 g (86.5%) of (2-[4-[bis(4-<br>
