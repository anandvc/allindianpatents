Background Art<br>
In an electrostatic coating system, a negative high voltage is applied to a spray to provide a negative electrode and a coating objective article is grounded to provide a positive electrode, and an electric field is formed therebetween. A coating material is sprayed to the coating objective article after it is negatively charged- Recently, in the field of the electrostatic coating, water-based coating material is increasingly used.  When a water-based coating material is used in an electrostatic coating system, a voltage block device is disposed between a coating material source and a spray in order to prevent the voltage applied to the coating material in the spray from passing through the conductive water-based coating material to the coating material source.<br>
