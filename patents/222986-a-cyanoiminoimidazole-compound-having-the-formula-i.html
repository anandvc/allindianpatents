Appropriate inorganic peroxides comprise, for example, hydrogen peroxide, alkali metal or earth alkaline metal peroxides, e.g. sodium peroxide, potassium peroxide; appropriate organic peroxides may comprise peroxy acids such as, for example, benzenecarboperoxoic acid or halo substituted benzenecarboperoxoic acid, e.g. 3-chlorobenzenecarboperoxoic acid, peroxoalkanoic acids, e.g. peroxoacetic acid, alkylhydroperoxides, e.g. t-butyl hydroperoxide. Suitable solvents are, for example, water, lower alkanols, e.g. ethanol and the like, hydrocarbons, e.g. toluene, ketones, e.g. 2-butanone, halogenated hydrocarbons, e.g. dichlorornethane, and mixtures of such solvents.<br>
Intermediates menlioned hereinabove may be prepared following art-known techniques.<br>
In particular, intermediates of formula (II) may be prepared by first reacting an amine of formula (VII) with dimethyl cyanocarbonimidodithioate or diphenyl cyano-carbonimidate or a functional derivative thereof. Said reaction can conveniently be<br><br>
performed in a reaction inert solvent such as, for example, dichloromethane, benzene or toluene, optionally cooled on an ice-bath, and in the presence of a base such as, for example, /V,A/-diethylethanamine or sodiumbicarbonate. The thus obtained intermediate may be subsequently reacted with an intermediate of formula (VIII) or a functional derivative thereof, to form an intermediate of formula (II). Said reaction can conveniently be performed in a reaction inert solvent such as, for example, 1,4-dioxane, in the presence of a base such as, for example, A^Af-diethylethanamine, and optionally in the presence of a catalyst such as, for example, ./V,,/V-dimethyl-pyridinamine. Stirring and elevated temperatures may enhance the rate of the reaction.<br><br>
Alternatively, the above reaction may be performed in reverse order, i.e. first react an intermediate of formula (VIII with dimethyl cyanocarbonimidodithioate or diphenyl cyanocarbonimidate or a functional derivative thereof, and subsequently react the thus formed intermediate with an amine of formula (VII).<br>
Intermediates of formula (III) wherein R1' is hydrogen, said intermediates being represented by formula (III-1), may be prepared by first reacting an amine of formula (VII) with a cyano derivative of formula (IX) wherein W3 is an appropriate leaving group such as, for example, a halogen, in the presence of a base such as, for example, sodiumcarbonate, in a reaction-inert solvent such as, for example, A^,A^-dimethyl-formamide. Subsequently, the cyanide moiety in the thus formed intermediate may be reduced using a suitable reducing agent such as, for example, lithium aluminium hydride or hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst such as, for example, Raney nickel, thus obtaining an intermediate of formula (III-1).<br><br>

Some of the compounds of formula (I) and some of the intermediates in the present invention contain at least one asymmetric carbon atom. Pure stereochemically isomeric forms of said compounds and said intermediates can be obtained by the application of art-known procedures. For example, diastereoisomers can be separated by physical methods such as selective crystallization or chromatographic techniques, e.g. counter current distribution, liquid chromatography and the like methods. Enantiomers can be obtained from racemic mixtures by first converting said racemic mixtures with suitable resolving agents such as, for example, chiral acids, to mixtures of diastereomeric salts or compounds; then physically separating said mixtures of diastereomeric salts or compounds by, for example, selective crystallization or chromatographic techniques, e.g. liquid chromatography and the like methods; and finally converting said separated diastereomeric salts or compounds into the corresponding enantiomers.<br>
Pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I) may also be obtained from the pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate intermediates and starting materials, provided that the intervening reactions occur stereo-specifically. The pure and mixed stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I) are intended to be embraced within the scope of the present invention.<br>
The compounds of formula (I), the W-oxide forms, pharmaceutically acceptable acid or base addition salts and the stereochemically isomeric forms thereof, are potent inhibitors of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) isoenzymes of family IV (cAMP-specific<br>
family).<br>
cAMP (adenosine cyclic 3',5'-monophosphate) is a key second messenger, the concentration of which affects particular cell activities through activation of enzymes such as kinases. PDE IV is known to hydrolyse cAMP to its corresponding inactive 5'-monophosphate metabolite. Hence, inhibition of PDE IV leads to an elevation of cAMP levels in particular cells such as the respiratory smooth muscle cell and in a wide variety of inflammatory cells, i.e. certain lymphocytes, e.g. basophils, neutrophils and<br><br>
eosinophils, monocytes and mast-cells. A number of allergic, atopic and inflammatory diseases are deemed to be caused by higher-than-normal PDE IV concentrations which result in low cAMP levels and hypersensitivity of the thus affected cells for excitatory stimuli. (Examples of said hypersensitivity are for example, excessive histamine release from basophils and mast cells or excessive superoxide anion radical formation by eosinophils.) Hence, the present compounds having potent phosphodiesterase IV inhibitory properties are deemed useful agents in alleviating and/or curing allergic, atopic and inflammatory diseases. The functional effects of PDE IV inhibitors are e.g. respiratory smooth muscle relaxation, bronchodilation, platelet aggregation inhibition and inhibition of white blood cell mediator release. Examples of allergic diseases are bronchial asthma, cheilitis, conjunctivitis, contact dermatitis and eczema, irritable bowel disease, deshydroform eczema, urticaria, vasculitis, vulvitis; examples of atopic diseases are dermatitis and eczema, winterfeet, asthma, allergic rhinitis; and related afflictions are, for example, psoriasis and other hyperproliferative diseases.<br>
The present invention thus also relates to compounds of formula (I) as defined hereinabove for use as a medicine, in particular for use as a medicine for treating atopic diseases or as an anti-asthmatic medicine. Thus the compounds of the present invention may be used for the manufacture of a medicament for treating atopic or asthmatic diseases, more in particular atopic dermatitis.<br>
The PDE IV inhibitory activity of the compounds of formula (I) may be demonstrated in the test "Inhibition of recombinant human mononuclear lymphocyte (MNL) phosphodiesterase type IV B produced in insect cells with a baculovirus vector". Several in vivo and in vitro tests may be used to demonstrate the usefulness of the compounds of formula (I) in treating the described allergic, atopic and inflammatory diseases. Such tests are for instance, "Bronchoconstriction of the guinea pig trachea in vitro", "Bronchoconstriction of the guinea pig trachea in vivo" and the in vivo tests "Arachidonic acid induced pinnal inflammation in mice", "TPA induced ear inflammation in mice", and "Delayed type hypersensitivity in mice".<br>
Further, the present compounds have only very low inhibitory activity on the phosphodiesterase isoenzymes of family III (cGMP-inhibited family). Inhibition of, in particular, PDE III leads to an elevation of cAMP in the cardiac muscle, thereby causing effects on the contractile force of the heart as well as on the relaxation of the heart.   In the treatment of the described allergic, atopic and inflammatory diseases, cardiovascular effects clearly are undesired. Hence, as the present compounds inhibit<br><br>
PDE IV at much lower concentrations as they inhibit PDE III, their therapeutic use may be adjusted to avoid cardiovascular side-effects.<br>
Art-known PDE IV inhibitors often cause adverse gastro-intestinal side effects. Most of the present compounds, however, have few effects on the gastro-intestinal tract, which may be demonstrated in the test "Gastric emptying of a caloric meal in rats".<br>
The designation PDE III and IV as used herein refers to the classification by J. A. Beavo and D. H. Reifsnyder, TIPS Reviews, April 1990, pp.  150-155.<br>
The compounds of the present invention also have cytokine inhibitory activity. A cytokine is any secreted polypeptide that affects the function of other cells by modulating interactions between cells in the immune or inflammatory response. Examples of cytokines are monokines and lymphokines and they may be produced by a wide variety of cells. For instance, a rnonokine is generally referred to as being produced and secreted by a mononuclear cell, such as a macrophage and/or monocyte but many other cells produce monokines, such as natural killer cells, fibroblasts, basophils, neutrophils, endothelial cells, brain astrocytes, bone marrow stromal cells, epideral keratinocytes, and [i-lymphocytes. Lymphokines are generally referred to as being produced by lymphocyte cells. Examples of cytokines include Interleukin-1 (IL-1), Interleukin-2 (IL-2), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Interleukin-8 (IL-8), alpha-Tumor Necrosis Factor (cxTNF) and beta-Tumor Necrosis Factor (pTNF).<br>
The cytokine specifically desired to be inhibited is aTNF. Excessive or unregulated TNF production is implicated in mediating or exacerbating a number of diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatoid spondylitis, osteoarthritis, gouty arthritis, and other arthritic conditions; sepsis, septic shock, endotoxic shock, gram negative sepsis, toxic shock syndrome, adult respiratory distress syndrome, cerebral malaria, chronic pulmonary inflammatory disease, silicosis, pulmonary sarcoidosis, bone resorption diseases, reperfusion injury, graft versus host reaction, allograft rejections, fever and myalgias due to infection, such as influenza, cachexia secondary to infection or malignancy, cachexia secondary to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), AIDS, ARC (AIDS related complex), keloid formation, scar tissue formation, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or pyresis.<br>
The cytokine inhibitory activity of the compounds of formula (I), such as the inhibition of (xTNF production, may be demonstrated in the in vitro test "Cytokine production in human whole blood cultures".<br><br>
In addition, the compounds of the present invention are expected to show no or little endocrinological side-effects. This may be evidenced by, for instance, the "Testosterone in vivo" test, the "In vitro inhibition of the aromatase activity"-test and the "In vivo inhibition of the aromatase activity-test.<br>
In view of their useful PDE IV and cytokine inhibiting properties, the subject compounds may be formulated into various pharmaceutical compositions for administration purposes comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and as active ingredient a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I). To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, a therapeutically effective amount of the particular compound, in base or acid addition salt form, as the active ingredient is combined in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. These pharmaceutical compositions are desirably in unitary dosage form suitable, preferably, for administration orally, rectally, topically, percutaneously, by inhalation or by parenteral injection. For example, in preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as suspensions, syrups, elixirs and solutions: or solid carriers such as starches, sugars, kaolin, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of powders, pills, capsules and tablets. Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. For parenteral compositions, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, at least in large part, though other ingredients, for example, to aid solubility, may be included. Injectable solutions, for example, may be prepared in which the carrier comprises saline solution, glucose solution or a mixture of saline and glucose solution. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed. In the compositions suitable for percutaneous administration, the carrier optionally comprises a penetration enhancing agent and/or a suitable wettable agent, optionally combined with suitable additives of any nature in minor proportions, which additives do not cause any significant deleterious effects on the skin. Said additives may facilitate the administration to the skin and/or may be helpful for preparing the desired compositions. These compositions may be administered in various ways, e.g., as a transdermal patch, as a spot-on or as an ointment. As appropriate compositions for topical application there may be cited all compositions usually employed for topically administering drugs e.g. creams, gellies,<br><br>
dressings, shampoos, tinctures, pastes, ointments, salves, powders and the like. Application of said compositions may be by aerosol, e.g. with a propellent such as nitrogen, carbon dioxide, a freon, or without a propellent such as a pump spray, drops, lotions, or a semisolid such as a thickened composition which can be applied by a swab. In particular, semisolid compositions such as salves, creams, gellies, ointments and the like will conveniently be used,<br>
In order to enhance the solubility and/or the stability of the compounds of formula (I) in pharmaceutical compositions, it can be advantageous to employ a-, p- or y-cyclo-dextrins or their derivatives, in particular hydroxyalkyl substituted cyclodextrins, e.g. 2-hydroxypropyl-(3-cyclodextrin. Also co-solvents such as alcohols may improve the solubility and/or the stability of the compounds of formula (I) in pharmaceutical compositions. In the preparation of aqueous compositions, addition salts of the subject compounds are obviously more suitable due to their increased water solubility.<br>
It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. Examples of such dosage unit forms are tablets (including scored or coated tablets), capsules, pills, powder packets, wafers, injectable solutions or suspensions and the like, and segregated multiples thereof.<br>
The present invention also relates to a method of treating warm-blooded animals suffering from disease states related to an abnormal enzymatic or catalytic activity of PDE IV, and/or disease states related to a physiologically detrimental excess of cytokines, in particular allergic, atopic and inflammatory diseases, more in particular asthmatic and atopic diseases, most particular atopic dermatitis. Said method comprises the administration of a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I) or a TV-oxide form, a pharmaceutically acceptable acid or base addition salt or a stereochemically isomeric form thereof in admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier.<br>
In general it is contemplated that an effective daily amount would be from 0.01 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg body weight. It is evident that said effective daily amount may be lowered or increased depending on the response of the treated subject and/or depending on the evaluation of the physician prescribing the compounds of the instant invention. The<br><br>
effective daily amount range mentioned hereinabove are therefore guidelines only and are not intended to limit the scope or use of the invention to any extent.<br>
The following examples are intended to illustrate and not to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Experimental part<br>
Of some compounds of formula (I) the absolute stereochemical configuration was not experimentally determined. In those cases the stereochemically isomeric form which was first isolated is designated as "A" and the second as "B", without further reference to the actual stereochemical configuration.<br>
Hereinafter, "THF" means tetrahydrofuran, "RT" means room temperature, "DMF" means /VJV-dimethylformamide and "DIPE" means diisopropylether.<br>

C. Pharmacological example<br>
Example C. 1: Inhibition of recombinant human mononuclear lymphocyte (MNL) phosphodiesterase type IV B produced in insect cells with a baculovirus vector. The alleviating and/or curing effect of the instant compounds on allergic and atopic diseases was assessed by an in vitro assay system to detect an inhibiting effect on the recombinant human MNL phosphodiesterase type IV B.<br>
Seventy-two hours after infection with recombinant baculovirus, the insect cells were harvested and pelleted at 500 g for 5 minutes. The cells were lysed in 10 ml lysis-buffer consisting of 20 mM Tris, 10 mM EGTA, 2 mM Na2EDTA, 1% Triton-X-100, ImM Na3VC)4, 10 mM NaF, 2 Jig/ml of leupeptine, pepstatine and aprotinine, 0.3 fig/ml benzamidine and 100 p,g/ml TPCK pH 7.5. After 5 minutes on ice, solubilized cells were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4°C. The resulting supernatant was filtered through a 0.45 |im filter (Millipore) and brought to TBS buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl pH 7.4).<br>
The supernatant containing phosphodiesterase (PDE) type IV B, was subsequently loaded onto a 5 ml anti-FLAG-M2 affinity gel column, previously activated with 5 ml<br>
100 mM glycine pH 3.5 and equilibrated with 20 ml 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl pH 7.4. After washing the column with equilibration buffer, PDE IV was eluted in 1.5 ml fractions containing 37.5 |il 1M Tris pH 8. The fractions were dialyzed overnight against 20 mM Tris, 2mM Na2EDTA and 400 mM NaCl pH 7.5 and tested for PDE IV activity. Indentification was done on SDS PAGE and Western Blot (anti-FLAG-M2). Active fractions were pooled, brought to 10% glycerol and stored at -70°C.<br>
The incubation mixture (pH 8) (200 (il) contained 20 mM Tris, 10 mM magnesium sulphate, 0.8 (iM Hl-cAMP (310 mCi/mmole) and the phosphodiesterase type IV, the amount depending on the enzymatic activity. A protein concentration was chosen that showed a linear increase of phosphodiesterase activity during an incubation period of maximum 10 minutes at 37°C and where less than 10% of the initial substrate was hydrolyzed.<br>
When the effect of different compounds on phosphodiesterase activity was tested, the medium without cAMP was incubated with the compound(s) or its carrier (DMSO - 1% final concentration) for 5 minutes. The enzymatic reaction was started by addition of ^H-cAMP and stopped 10 minutes later after transferring the microtiter-plate in a waterbath at 100°C for 5 minutes. After cooling to room temperature, alkaline phosphatase (0.25 |ig/ml) was added and the mixture was incubated at 37°C for 20 min. 100 (4,1 of the mixture was subsequently applied to a GF-B filter-microtiter-plate (Millipore) filled with 300 (4,1 DEAE-Sephadex-A25 suspension. The plate was washed 3 times with 75 (4.1 20 mM Tris pH 7.5 and the filtrates were collected for counting in the Packard Top Count scintillation counter.<br>
The inhibiting effect of the present compounds on recombinant human MNL phosphodiesterase PDE IV B was measured at different concentrations of the instant compounds. The ICso values (expressed in M) were calculated graphically from the<br>
thus obtained inhibition values and are listed in Table 2. Table 2<br><br><br><br>
