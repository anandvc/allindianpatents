METHOD FOR DISSOLVING PPTA IN SULFURIC ACID USING A TWIN SCREW EXTRUDER<br>
The invention pertains to a method for dissolving PPTA (which is the acronym of poly(para-phenylene-terephthalamide)) or copolymers thereof in sulfuric acid using a twin screw extruder.<br>
Methods for dissolving PPTA are known in the art. Common methods include dissolving PPTA in liquid sulfuric acid in a reactor or kneader and degassing the formed solution. The process takes about 4 hours at a temperature of 85° C, which causes degradation of the polymer or copolymer.<br>
Alternatively, mixing is performed at low temperature (below 25° C) of PPTA with (frozen) sulfuric acid ice, followed by melting and degassing the produced solid solution. The process takes about 6 hours and has a large residence time distribution. This process is limited to mixtures having a PPTA-content between 17.5 and 19.8 wt.%. Below 17.5 wt.% PPTA in sulfuric acid, a substantial amount of off-spec material is formed. Further, copolymers cannot be dissolved or are only to dissolve with difficulties because the formed solid solutions become too sticky and/or are formed to big lumps that cannot easily be processes further. These known methods thus have inherent disadvantage.<br>
It is an objective of the invention to provide a solution to the above problems. To this end a new method has been developed, which is devoid of the above disadvantages. The invention therefore relates to a method for dissolving PPTA or copolymers thereof in sulfuric acid using a twin screw extruder having transporting, mixing, and kneading elements comprising an entering zone, an intermediate zone, a mixing zone, a negative transport zone, a degassing zone, and a pressure build-up zone, the method comprising the steps:<br>
•	Transporting PTA or copolymer thereof into the entering zone at a transport capacity low enough as to prevent sulfuric acid entering the entering zone; entering sulfuric acid in the intermediate zone at high shear conditions to remove the optionally formed gel layer;<br>
•	introducing sulfuric acid in the entering or intermediate zone;<br>
•	essentially fully filling the mixing zone to allow sufficient time to mix and dissolve PPTA or copolymer thereof in the sulfuric acid to obtain a PPTA or<br><br>
copolymer thereof - sulfuric acid solution; '•    creating after the mixing zone a negative transport zone to obtain a product lock between the mixing zone and the degassing zone;<br>
•	creating a thin film of the PPTA or copolymer thereof - sulfuric acid solution in the degassing zone to degas the solution;<br>
•	entering the solution into the pressure build-up zone to partially fill this zone and to leave the twin screw extruder.<br>
Twin screw extruders, as such are known in the art and used to mix and extrude polymers, For instance, in NL 8500429 a polyethylene mixture was obtained by using a twin screw extruder, which mixture was suitable for making tapes, films, tubes, and the like. In other publications, for instance in EP 821708, a twin screw extruder has been described for use in polymerizing an aliphatic diamine and an aliphatic dicarboxylic acid to obtain a non-aromatic polyamide (i.e., nylon). The use for other polymers than polyethylene or polyamide or its use for making a spin dope was not disclosed.<br>
The invention is illustrated by the following figures.<br>
Fig. 1a and 1b shows a schematic view of a twin screw extruder.<br>
Fig. 2a and 2b show a single and double flighted transport element.<br>
Fig. 3 shows transport element with mixing character.<br>
Fig. 4 shows mixing element without transporting.<br>
A schematic figure of a twin screw extruder as used in the invention is shown in Fig. 1a. PPTA and/or the copolymer thereof (a) is dosed into the entering section (hopper) 1 of the extruder and transported to the intermediate zone 2. Sulfuric acid (b) is injected into the extruder in the intermediate zone 2 and 3 (the sulfuric acid is not injected in the entering zone to prevent that the sulfuric acid will flow back into the hopper which will cause severe problems) and together with the PPTA polymer transported to the mixing section 4. In the mixing section 4 the PPTA and sulfuric acid are intensively mixed. The mixing by so called mixing elements generates a lot of heat dissipation so that simultaneously to the mixing process the dissolution process will take place. The heat dissipation during mixing and the dissolution energy is enough to almost carry out the total process adiabatically. After the PPTA (or the copolymer) has been dissolved the dissolution can be degassed. To carry out a degassing process first a product-lock is implemented in the negative transport<br><br>
zone 5. Now the dissolution can be degassed under low pressure ((c); e.g., at 40,mbar absolute). The degassed solution, a so called a spin-dope (d), is transported at a certain pressure out of the extruder by the pressure build-up section 6. A schematic figure of another twin screw extruder as used in the invention is shown in Fig. 1b. PPTA and/or the copolymer thereof (a) is dosed into the entering section 1 of the extruder. Sulfuric acid (b) is injected into the extruder in the entering zone and together with the PPTA polymer transported to the mixing section 2. In the mixing section 2 the PPTA and sulfuric acid are intensively mixed. The mixing by so called mixing elements generates a lot of heat dissipation so that simultaneously to the mixing process the dissolution process will take place. The heat dissipation during mixing and the dissolution energy is enough to almost carry out the total process adiabatically. After the PPTA (or the copolymer) has been dissolved the dissolution can be degassed. To carry out a degassing process first a product-lock is implemented in the negative transport zone 3. Now the dissolution can be degassed under low pressure ((c); e.g., at 40 mbar absolute). The degassed solution, a so called a spin-dope (d), is transported at a certain pressure out of the extruder by the pressure build-up section 4<br>
In Figures 2a and 2b positive and negative conveying elements are shown that are used in several zones of the extruder, viz:<br>
a)	In the entering zone of the extruder.<br>
The conveying elements have the function to transport the PPTA polymer (or copolymer thereof) towards the mixing zone without compacting the polymer. Compacting the polymer leads to agglomerates of the polymer which are more difficult to dissolve. In this zone single (Fig. 2a) and double flighted positive (Fig. 2b)   long lead conveying elements can be used<br>
b)	In the product-lock.<br>
The conveying elements have the function to form a barrier between the mixing zone and the degassing zone. This barrier, called the product-lock, is achieved by negative conveying elements. To achieve an efficient product-lock there should be used short lead elements, the length being defined short with respect to the length of the extruder. Suitable lengths are within the range from about 0.5 D to about 0.75 D.<br>
c)	In the degassing zone.<br>
The conveying elements have the function to create a thin film in the degassing zone, meaning that the elements should give a strong transport. To achieve<br><br>
strong transport long lead elements should be used. Suitable lengths are about 1.25 D to about 3 D mm.<br>
d)     In the pressure build-up zone.<br>
The conveying elements have the function to create a pre-determined pressure level within a short path in the extruder. To create this pressure level efficiently, the conveying elements should have a short lead. Suitable lengths are about 0.5 D to about 0.75 D mm.<br>
In Figure 3 transport-free elements are shown that are used in the mixing zone of the<br>
extruder.<br>
Major functions of these elements are<br>
•	distributively mixing PPTA (or copolymer thereof) and sulfuric acid and to remove a gel-blocking layer around the polymer particle of low concentrated PPTA (or copolymer thereof) in sulfuric acid.<br>
•	dissolving the PPTA (or copolymer thereof) in the sulfuric acid. This dissolution process is a diffusion-related process requiring an amount of time.<br>
Therefore mixing elements without transport function should be used in the mixing zone.<br>
Figure 4 shows interrupted flight elements, which are used in the mixing zone of the<br>
extruder.<br>
Major functions of these elements are<br>
•	transporting the PPTA (or copolymer thereof)/sulfuric acid through the mixing elements and through the product-lock.<br>
•	distributively mixing PPTA (or copolymer thereof) and sulfuric acid and partly removing a gel-blocking layer around the polymer particle of low concentrated PPTA (or copolymer thereof) in sulfuric acid<br>
Therefore transport elements with interrupted flights have to be used in the mixing zone.<br>
The screw configuration can be constructed with a number of different elements such<br>
as transporting, mixing, and kneading elements.<br>
To carry out the process of dissolving PPTA or copolymer in sulfuric acid the following<br>
screw configuration is preferred:<br>
The entering zone element has preferably a length of 1-6 D, more preferably 3-6 D<br>
(D stands for diameter of the screw in mm), and can have a length as large as 6 to<br><br>
9	D and is equipped with transport elements which are single or double flighted. In<br>
Figures 2a and 2b single and double flighted constructions are shown, respectively.<br>
The single and double flighted elements are well known conveying elements which do<br>
not cause compaction of the polymer during conveying.<br>
The mixing and dissolution zones have a length of 15 to 30 D, and preferably of 20 to 23 D, using elements without transport character (see Figure 3; such as W&amp;P Igel or Hedgehog and or single /multi row tooth mixing ZME; Berstorff single or multi row tooth mixing ZB, and Clextral multi row tooth mixing BMEL) or having interrupted transport character (see Figure 4, such as W&amp;P type SME or Berstorff type EAZ-ME). The mixing elements without transport character are characterized in that they do not cause conveying and that they are therefore totally filled-up with product, having dispersive mixing character. The mixing elements with interrupted transporting character have a channel with conveying character. These elements have distributive mixing character and are not necessary totally filled-up. The product-lock between the dissolution and the degassing process has been constructed with so called negative transport elements with a length of 0.1 to 10 D, preferably about 1 D. The negative transport elements have an anti clockwise channel and therefore cause backward transport.<br>
The degassing zone has a length of 2-20 D, preferably 6-8 D and is equipped with transport elements to obtain a thin film for a short degassing time. These elements are transport elements with a long lead and a strong conveying character.<br>
The pressure build-up zone has a length of about 2-20 D, and preferably about 6-8 D, and is constructed with transport elements. These elements are transporting elements with a short lead (for instance, two flights over a length of 0.5 D) and a strong conveying character.<br>
The method of the invention is taking place in less than 30 min, often between 2 and<br>
10	min, and usually in about 4-6 minutes. Due to the short residence time hardly any<br>
degradation occurs.<br>
The short dissolution times are particularly important when changing to another concentration, which will take about 4 times the residence time. Thus this method with its short residence times is economically attractive when different product types are produced. The method is also very suitable for adding additives to the polymer or copolymer, such as colorants, conductive agents, friction-modifying agents, and the like. Those additives can in principle be added at any site of the extruder, and<br><br>
preferably at the beginning of the extruder. Solids, for instance, can advantageously be added to the hopper. All sorts of PPTA or copolymer concentrations can be prepared by using the present method because there is no solid solution stage which in the prior art methods causes a lot of off-spec material at low concentrations or with copolymers.<br>
Because of the excellent mixing character the process in the twin screw extruder can also be used to efficiently mix nanoparticles into the prepared solution of polymer or copolymer. The use of twin screw extruders according to this invention allows very fast dissolution of PPTA or other aramid polymers or copolymers in sulfuric acid, has further the advantage that mixing, degassing, and pressure building are performed in one apparatus, and that any aramid polymer or copolymer in any concentration can be used. The process can be performed on-line in combination with a spinning process, and leads to a product having improved properties and decreased degradation.<br>
Further, the total investment of equipment for the dissolution process is lower than the required investments for the known routes, as the total energy consumption for the total dissolution process is lower than for the prior art methods.<br>
Surprisingly, it was also found that yarns that were spun with spin dopes made according to this new method have better mechanical properties, such as higher tenacities, elongation at break and breaking energies, and lower modulus than similar yarns spun with known spin dopes. It is therefore also an objective of the invention to provide yarns with these improved properties.<br>
The invention is further illustrated by the following non-limitative examples that only serve to clarify the invention.<br>
The dosing systems<br>
The dosing of the PPTA or copolymer is taking place in the entering zone of the extruder (hopper). The dosing of the PPTA is carried out by a so called Loss in Weight system. Because of the fact that the dissolution equipment has hardly any buffer capacity the dosing system should have a high accuracy.<br>
The dosing system of the sulfuric acid (H2S04) is taking place after the entering zone. The dosing of H2S04 is carried out with a gear pump or a 3-headed plunge pump. The flow of H2S04 was measured with a coriolis tube with backwards controlling of the<br><br>
frequency of the pump in order to dose the required amounts of H2S04.<br>
Because the dissolution equipment has hardly any buffer capacity the dosing system<br>
should have a high accuracy.<br>
Dissolving PPTA (or copolymer thereof) in H2S04 is taking place in a twin screw extruder made of material which is resistant against wear and tear of the process. The screw configuration of the extruder should meet a number of specifications viz.:<br>
-	the transport in the entering zone is constructed in such a way that the transport capacity for PPTA/H2S04 is sufficient to prevent that any H2S04 is coming into the hopper of the extruder, causing severe problems;<br>
-	the mixing/dissolution zone is constructed in such a way that this zone is fully filled to give the dissolution process sufficient time, without introduction of hot spots in this zone and achieving maximum capacity for the dissolution;<br>
-	after the mixing/dissolution zone a negative transport zone is constructed to create a product lock between dissolution and degassing;<br>
-	the degassing zone is constructed in such a way that a thin film of PPTA/ H2S04 dissolution is created to degas the solution in a very short time (for instance, from 2 to 8 sec);<br>
-	the pressure build-up zone is constructed in such a way (i.e., by the rpm of the extruder and the length of the pressure build-up elements) that with a standard output pressure this zone is filled up for 50%.<br>
The invention is illustrated by the following non-limitative examples.<br>
GENERAL PROCEDURES<br>
Determination of the linear densities<br>
The method described is suitable for the determination of linear densities of all types<br>
of p-aramid filament yarn, having a nominal linear density (LD) of 200 to 25,000 dtex.<br>
Principle<br>
Linear density (LD) is determined by weighing a measured length of yarn conditioned in the form of a skein. This length of yarn is measured under specified tension. The unit of LD is decitex (dtex); one dtex being defined as the mass of one gram per 10,000 meters length.<br><br>
Procedure<br>
The yarn is pre-dried in a ventilated oven of 45 ± 5° C.<br>
Standard atmosphere: temperature of 20 ± 2° C at a relative humidity of 65 ± 2%.<br>
Standard pretension in the yarn during winding is 5 ± 3.0 mN/tex, calculated on the<br>
basis of the nominal LD.<br>
Determination of the linear density<br>
Using a precision reel, make up a skein under pretension. The length L of the skein,<br>
which depends upon the nominal linear density, is indicated in the Table below.<br><br>
wherein:<br>
M	= mass of skein (mg)<br>
L	= length of skein (m)<br>
The linear density (LD) is calculated as the average of n determinations, including the<br>
standard deviation sn-i. The average values are given as<br>
LD = dtex (sn.i)<br>
Determination Of The Force-Elongation<br>
The method is suitable for the determination of the force-elongation properties of all<br>
types of Twaron filament yarns, having a nominal LD of 200 to 50,000 dtex.<br>
Principle<br>
The specimen (provided with protective twist) is mounted in the clamps of a tensile<br>
testing machine (CRE-type), which is operated until rupture.<br>
The breaking force (BF) and the elongation at break (EAB), and various other tensile<br>
properties are given by a computer system connected to the tester.<br><br>
Pneumatically closing clamps:<br>
For LD up to 10,000 dtex, clamps with a wrap of 180° are used, e.g. Instron cat. No.<br>
2714-032 (formerly type 4D). The clamps may be provided with an enlarged cylinder<br>
diameter for higher clamping force.<br>
For LD between 10,000 and 50,000 dtex, clamps with a wrap of 270° are used, e.g.<br>
Instron cat. No. 2714-107. The clamping blocks must be highly polished.<br>
The amount of twist to be inserted is given is based on the equation:<br><br>
wherein:<br>
YT = yarn twist<br>
LD = linear density in tex<br>
For LD above the 10,000 dtex, a YT of 30 tpm has to be inserted. Pre-dry the twisted<br>
yarn on the twisting bobbin for 3 hours in the ventilated oven at 50± 5° C and<br>
subsequently condition for at least 16 hours in the standard atmosphere (temperature<br>
of 20 ± 2° C at relative humidity of 65 ± 2%).<br>
The number of determinations per laboratory sample is n = 3 (clamp breaks not<br>
included).<br>
Calculation<br>
Breaking strength BS (N) is calculated as the average of n determinations BF.<br>
Elongation at break EAB is calculated as follows:<br>
wherein:<br>
L0 = initial length (mm), length at a pretension of 20 mN/tex.<br>
E    = extension (mm) from the initial length to the extension at breaking force.<br>
For the slack start procedure the initial length is calculated as follows:<br><br>
wherein:<br>
Ls	= gage length (mm) at the start<br>
D	= the displacement (mm) of the moving clamp from the start position to<br>
the position where the force is equal to the specified pretension.<br><br>
Breaking tenacity BT is calculated from the measured value of breaking force BF (N) and the measured value of LD (dtex) by means of the following formula:<br>
The chord modulus (CM) in a force-elongation curve is the ratio of the change in force to the change in elongation between two specified points on the curve. The formula for a CMA calculation is as follows:<br><br>
wherein:<br>
F
F2	= force in N for point 2 corresponding to 300 mN/tex<br>
Ei	= elongation in % for Fi<br>
E2	= elongation in % for F2<br>
LD	= linear density in dtex.<br>
To obtain the chord modulus in GPa; multiply the value in N/tex with the density (D) in g/cm3.<br>
CMA(Gpa) = CMA(N/tex)x D(g/cm3)<br>
The results of the n determinations are averaged and the corresponding standard deviation sn.i is calculated and reported as BS =.N (sn-i)<br>

Claims<br>
1.	A method for dissolving PPTA or copolymers thereof in sulfuric acid using a twin<br>
screw extruder having transporting, mixing, and kneading elements comprising an<br>
entering zone, an intermediate zone, a mixing zone, a negative transport zone, a<br>
degassing zone, and a pressure build-up zone, the method comprising the steps:<br>
•	transporting PPTA or copolymer thereof into the entering zone at a transport capacity low enough as to prevent sulfuric acid entering the entering zone;<br>
•	introducing sulfuric acid in the entering or intermediate zone;<br>
•	essentially fully filling the mixing zone to allow sufficient time to mix and dissolve PPTA or copolymer thereof in the sulfuric acid to obtain a PPTA or copolymer thereof - sulfuric acid solution;<br>
•	creating after the mixing zone a negative transport zone to obtain a product lock between the mixing zone and the degassing zone;<br>
•	creating a thin film of the PPTA or copolymer thereof - sulfuric acid solution in the degassing zone to degas the solution;<br>
•	entering the solution into the output pressure build-up zone to partially fill this zone and to leave the twin screw extruder.<br><br>
2.	The method according to claim 1 wherein the residence time of the PPTA or copolymer thereof in the twin screw extruder is less than 30 min, preferably between 2 and 10 min, more preferably between 4 and 6 min.<br>
3.	The method according to claim 1 or 2 wherein the entering zone has a length 3 to 6 D, equipped with single or double flighted transport element.<br>
4.	The method according to any one of claims 1-3 wherein the mixing zone has a length of 20-23 D equipped with mixing elements with and without transport character.<br>
5.	The method according to any one of claims 1-4 wherein the negative transport zone has negative transport elements having a length of about 1 D.<br>
6.	The method according to any one of claims 1-5 wherein the degassing zone has a length of 6-8 D equipped with transport elements.<br>
7.	The method according to any one of claims 1-5 wherein the pressure bult-up zone has a length of 2-20 D equipped with conveying elements having a short lead of 0.5 D to 0.75 D mm.<br>
8.	The method according to any one of claims 1-6 wherein the PPTA or copolymer thereof is mixed with nanoparticles and sulfuric acid, or wherein the PPTA or copolymer thereof - sulfuric acid solution is mixed with nanoparticles.<br><br>
9. 'Yam spun with a spin dope obtained by the method of any one of claims 1-7 having improved tenacity, elongation, and/or breaking energy in comparison with yarns made prior art spin dopes.<br><br></td>
