PREPARATION AND THEIR USE AS ANTIMYCOBACTERIAL AGENTS<br>

3.	PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel compounds belonging to the class of oxazolidinones useful in the treatment of acid fast organisms such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium spp. The present invention further relates to methods for preparation of the novel compounds and to pharmaceutical compositions containing the novel compounds useful in the treatment of tuberculosis. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Tuberculosis (TB), an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis is transmitted mainly through air, affecting most often the lungs. When persons with pulmonary TB cough they produce tiny droplet nuclei containing M. tuberculosis, which remain suspended in air for a prolonged period of time. A person who breathes the air containing the aforesaid droplet nuclei containing M. tuberculosis can become infected with TB.<br>
TB, one of the three major infectious diseases in the priority list of the World Health Organization's (WHO) agenda kills about two million people around the world every year. About six million new cases are reported every year and nearly 20% of adult deaths and 6% of infant deaths are attributable to the disease (C. Dye et. al., J. Am. Med. Ass., 1999, 282, 677-686). About a billion people are expected to be affected by TB by the year 2020, with 35 million likely to succumb to the disease (WHO Fact Sheet No. 104, Global Alliance for TB Drug Development- Executive Summary of the Scientific Blueprint for TB Development : http://www.who.int/inf-fs/en/factl04.html).<br>
With the emergence of the AIDS epidemic and the increase in cases of HIV coupled with TB as well as the continued resistance of M. tuberculosis to isoniazid and rifampicin, the two most powerful anti-tubercular drugs available today there is an urgent need for new anti-tubercular drugs to combat the killer disease (S. H. E. Kaufmann et. al., Trends Microbiol., 1993, 1,2-5 ; B. R. Bloom et. al., N. Engl. J. Med., 1998, 338, 677-678).<br>
Although, many new compounds are becoming available for fighting a number of infectious diseases, the number of such compounds having antimycobacterial activity are few. This could partly be due to the complexity of research involved and partly due to business considerations (B. N. Roy et. al., J. Ind. Chem. Soc, April 2002, 79, 320-335 and references cited therein).<br>
However, renewed thrust in research in the last decade has resulted in development of new antimycobacterial compounds,<br>
a)	differing widely in structures,<br>
b)	having different mode/mechanism of action,<br>
c)	possessing favourable pharmacokinetic properties,<br>
d)	which are safe and have low incidence of side-effects, and<br>
e)	which provide a cost-effective dosage regimen.<br>
2<br><br>
Among the aforesaid new compounds, the oxazolidinones first developed during the mid-1980s (W. A. Gregory et. al., J. Med. Chem., 1989, 32,1673-1681 and 1990,33,2569-2578 ; C-H Park et. al., J. Med. Chem., 1992, 35, 1156-1165) are a unique class in themselves. The in vivo results for some of the oxazolidinones show that they are active against various Gram-positive bacteria such as staphylococci, pneumococci and enterococci, including resistant strains such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA], methicillin-resistant Streptococcus epidermidis [MRSE], penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae [PRSP], vancomycin-resistant enterococci [VRE], etc. (B. Riedl et. al., Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents., Ashley Publications Ltd., 1999,9 (5), 625-633 and the references contained therein).<br>
The oxazolidinones inhibit bacterial protein synthesis at a very early step in the initiation of complex formation involved in the process of translating mRNA into protein. The oxazolidinones, in general, are not cross-resistant with any known antibiotic because of this unique mechanism (D. C. Eustice et. al., Antimicrob. Agents Chemother., 1988, 32, 1218 and Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 1988,150. 965).<br>
A feature of the oxazolidinone molecule is that only those compounds, which are enantiomers with a (5S)-acetamidomethyl configuration in the left side of the molecule are known to exhibit antibacterial activity (W. A. Gregory et. al., J. Med. Chem., 1989, 32, 1673-1681). Another feature is that most of such antibacterial compounds invariably carry a (substituted) phenyl ring attached to the nitrogen atom of the oxazolidinone ring in the right side of the molecule (B. Riedl et. al., Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents., Ashley Publications Ltd., 1999, 9 (5), 625-633 and the references contained therein).<br>
The most promising compound among the N-phenyl oxazolidinones, which has been approved for human use is (S)-N-[[3-[3-fluoro-4-(4-morpholinyl)phenyl]-2-oxo-5-oxazolidin-yl]methyl]-acetamide), commonly known as linezolid (M. Barbachyn et. al., WO 995/07271). Linezolid possesses good in vitro and in vivo potency against most of the Gram-positive bacteria, including resistant strains {Drugs of the Future, 1996,21.(11), 1116-1123).<br>
The left hand side i. e. position 5- and the right hand side i. e. position 3- respectively of<br>
the oxazolidinone ring nucleus allows for many variations and has resulted in the discovery of a<br>
large number of compounds having antimicrobial and antibacterial properties. Such<br>

The respective N-oxides of the group R2 of the compounds of formula I listed above also form a novel aspect of the present invention.<br>

General method for synthesis of compounds of formula (I)<br><br>
In a typical experiment, the amine compound of formula (II), wherein the groups A, B, and R2 have the same meanings as defined hereinbefore is dissolved in a 1:1 mixture of tertahydrofuran and water or a 1:1 mixture of methylene chloride and water. To the solution is added the carboxylic acid compound of formula (III), followed by addition of 1-hydroxybenztriazole (HOBt). The resulting mixture is cooled to a temperature of 0-5° C to which l-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride, 1.1 Eq.) is added and gradually allowed to warm to room temperature and agitated at this temperature for 24 hours. At the end of<br>
17<br><br>
the reaction, a solution of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate is added and the organic phase separated from the aqueous phase. Evaporation of the solvent and chromatography of the residue over silica gel affords compound of formula (I), generally as white solids.<br>
The N-oxides of the group R2 of compound of formula (I) thus obtained are preferably prepared by addition of m-chloro perbenzoic acid (m-CPBA) to a cooled solution of the compound of formula (I) in a chlorinated hydrocarbon solvent such as methylene chloride and ethylene chloride and thereafter agitating the reaction mixture at room temperature for 12-15 hours. Evaporation of the solvent under reduced pressure, followed by chromatography of the residue over silica gel affords the corresponding N-oxides in high purity.<br>
The N-oxides thus prepared, while retaining most of the antimycobacterial activity of the corresponding deoxo compound exhibit exceedingly high water solubility over the deoxo analogue, thereby helping in manufacture of suitable iv formulations, which forms an important aspect of this invention.<br>
The starting materials required for synthesis of compound of formula (I), thus involve the amine compound of formula II and the carboxylic acid compound of formula III.<br>

Thus, the starting amines of formula (II), wherein the groups A, B, and R2 have the same meanings as defined hereinearlier are prepared as per the method disclosed by W. A. Gregory et. al., J.

The method is essentially summarized in Scheme-II.<br><br><br>
In a typical method, morpholine, thiomorpholine, piperidine, 4-benzyl piperazine, pyrrolidine, 1,2,4-triazine, 12,3-benzotriazine, benzyl amine, a heterocycloalkyl or a heteroaryl moiety etc., each one of which corresponds to the group R2 defined hereinbefore is reacted with 3,4-difluoro nitrobenzene in the presence of a base and a solvent to give the corresponding derivative in which the fluorine atom at 4-position is substituted by the group R2. The nitro group in the compound thus obtained is reduced to amino group, which is thereafter protected by a suitable protective group. Reaction of the N-protected compound thus obtained with (R)-glycidyl butyrate in the presence of a strong base like n-butyl lithium leads to formation of the 5-hydroxymethyl oxazolidinone ring. The hydroxy group in the compound thus obtained is converted to sulfonyl derivative, for e.g. a methanesulfonyloxy (mesyl) or a p-toluenesulfonyloxy (tosyl) derivative by reaction with methanesulfonyl chloride or p-toluenesulfonyl chloride respectively. Reaction of the respective mesyl or tosyl derivative with sodium azide gives the corresponding azide, which is converted to the amine compound of formula (II) by standard methods, for e.g. by reaction with a triaryl/trialkyl phosphine, followed by hydrolysis.<br>

The ability of the compounds 1-78 of formula (I) of this invention to inhibit the growth of Mycobacterium species was determined by the BACTEC 460 TB system. The reference strain M tuberculosis H37Rv ATCC 27294 was grown in Middlebrook 7H9 broth containing 10% ADC<br>
supplement at 37°C on a rotay shaker at 150 rpm for grown for 7days. The turbidity of the culture was adjusted to 1.0 Mc farland. The BACTEC 7H12B medium vials were seeded with 0.1ml of the 1.0 Mc farland adjusted M. tuberculosis culture. In the control vials 0.1ml of the culture was added after lOOfold dilution of the initial inoculum. Stock solution of lmg/ml of each compound was prepared in DMSO in separate sterile tubes. The compounds were further diluted to concentration of 25 ^g/100 ul, 0.1ml was than added to the 7H12B vial containing mycobacterial culture so that final concentration of the compound 6.25 u.g/ml. The cap in all the vials were cleaned with isopropanyl alcohol and kept in racks. The vials were then incubated at 37°C without shaking. Test vials was read daily on the BACTEC system till the GI of the control vial reached &gt; 30.Once the GI in the control reached 30 AGI (GI = GI (n&gt; - GI („.i) ) was determined for all test and control vials. If AGI of test vial is less than that of the control vial the culture was sensitive to the test compound. in vitro Agar Dilution assay<br>
MIC of compound of formula (I) of this invention against strains of Mycobacterium were determined by a reference agar dilution method as per the NCCLS- M24-T2. recommendations. The compounds were dissolved in DMSO and diluted twofold to obtain ten serial dilutions of each compound. Appropriate volume of compounds were incorporated into duplicate plates of Middlebrook7H10 agar medium supplemented with 10% Middlebrook supplement oleic acid-albumin-dextrose (OADC) enrichment at concentration of 0.03u,g/ml to 16|j,g/ml. Test organisms (mycobacterium strains) were grown in Middle brook 7H9 broth containing 0.05% Tween-80 and 10% ADC supplement. After 7 days of incubation at 37°C the broths were adjusted to the turbidity of 1.0 McFarland standard; the organism were further diluted 10 fold in sterile water containing 0.10% Tween-80. The resulting mycobacterial suspensions were spotted (3-5jxl/spot) onto drug supplemented 7H10 media plates. The plates were sealed and incubated at 37°Cfor 3-4 weeks in upright position. The MIC was recorded as the lowest dilution of the drug that completely inhibited the growth of test organisms. Test isolates included 10 clinical isolates that were generally susceptible to common tubercular agents and 10 strains that were resistant to one or more standard anti tubercular drugs. Appropriate reference strains and control drug was included in each batch of test.<br>

in vivo studies:<br>
The efficacy of the compound of formula (I) of this invention was also evaluated in murine model of pulmonary tuberculosis. Mycobacterium tuberculosis cultures grown in Middle brook 7H9 broth containing 0.05% Tween-80 and 10% ADC supplement at 37°C for 7 days on a rotary shaker. For, animal inoculation liquid cultures were declumped by brief sonication and were diluted appropriately in 7H9 broth to obtain a concentration of lxl07CFU's/ 0.2ml. Four-week-old male outbred Swiss albino mice housed in a pathogen free, biosafety level 3 environment within micro isolator cages were used throughout the study. Infections were produced by intravenous inoculation into caudal tail vein of 0.2ml of declumped M. tuberculosis suspension. Following infection, mice were randomly distributed in different groups of six each.<br>
Treatment for initial study was started one day after infection. For, treatment Compound No. 30 of formula I was dissolved in 10% PEG. Isoniazid was dissolved in sterile water. The drugs were prepared each morning prior to administration. Therapy was given 5 days per week for four weeks. All the agents were administered by gavage and were dosed at 50,25,12.5mg / kg of body weight. Control group of infected but untreated mice were killed at the initiation of therapy (early control) or at the end of the treatment period (late control). Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation 3-5 days after the administration of the last dose of drug. The spleens and right lung were removed aseptically and homogenized in tissue homogeniser. At least 4 serial tenfold dilution of the homogenate was plated onto selective Middlebrook 7H11 agar plates in duplicate. The colony counts were recorded after incubation at 37°C for 4 weeks. The viable cell counts were converted to Logio values. A compound showing 2 Log reduction in viable counts compared to the controls was considered significant.<br>

3.	PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel compounds belonging to the class of oxazolidinones useful in the treatment of acid fast organisms such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium spp. The present invention further relates to methods for preparation of the novel compounds and to pharmaceutical compositions containing the novel compounds useful in the treatment of tuberculosis. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Tuberculosis (TB), an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis is transmitted mainly through air, affecting most often the lungs. When persons with pulmonary TB cough they produce tiny droplet nuclei containing M. tuberculosis, which remain suspended in air for a prolonged period of time. A person who breathes the air containing the aforesaid droplet nuclei containing M. tuberculosis can become infected with TB.<br>
TB, one of the three major infectious diseases in the priority list of the World Health Organization's (WHO) agenda kills about two million people around the world every year. About six million new cases are reported every year and nearly 20% of adult deaths and 6% of infant deaths are attributable to the disease (C. Dye et. al., J. Am. Med. Ass., 1999, 282, 677-686). About a billion people are expected to be affected by TB by the year 2020, with 35 million likely to succumb to the disease (WHO Fact Sheet No. 104, Global Alliance for TB Drug Development- Executive Summary of the Scientific Blueprint for TB Development : http://www.who.int/inf-fs/en/factl04.html).<br>
With the emergence of the AIDS epidemic and the increase in cases of HIV coupled with TB as well as the continued resistance of M. tuberculosis to isoniazid and rifampicin, the two most powerful anti-tubercular drugs available today there is an urgent need for new anti-tubercular drugs to combat the killer disease (S. H. E. Kaufmann et. al., Trends Microbiol., 1993, 1,2-5 ; B. R. Bloom et. al., N. Engl. J. Med., 1998, 338, 677-678).<br>
Although, many new compounds are becoming available for fighting a number of infectious diseases, the number of such compounds having antimycobacterial activity are few. This could partly be due to the complexity of research involved and partly due to business considerations (B. N. Roy et. al., J. Ind. Chem. Soc, April 2002, 79, 320-335 and references cited therein).<br>
However, renewed thrust in research in the last decade has resulted in development of new antimycobacterial compounds,<br>
a)	differing widely in structures,<br>
b)	having different mode/mechanism of action,<br>
c)	possessing favourable pharmacokinetic properties,<br>
d)	which are safe and have low incidence of side-effects, and<br>
e)	which provide a cost-effective dosage regimen.<br>
2<br><br>
Among the aforesaid new compounds, the oxazolidinones first developed during the mid-1980s (W. A. Gregory et. al., J. Med. Chem., 1989, 32,1673-1681 and 1990,33,2569-2578 ; C-H Park et. al., J. Med. Chem., 1992, 35, 1156-1165) are a unique class in themselves. The in vivo results for some of the oxazolidinones show that they are active against various Gram-positive bacteria such as staphylococci, pneumococci and enterococci, including resistant strains such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA], methicillin-resistant Streptococcus epidermidis [MRSE], penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae [PRSP], vancomycin-resistant enterococci [VRE], etc. (B. Riedl et. al., Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents., Ashley Publications Ltd., 1999,9 (5), 625-633 and the references contained therein).<br>
The oxazolidinones inhibit bacterial protein synthesis at a very early step in the initiation of complex formation involved in the process of translating mRNA into protein. The oxazolidinones, in general, are not cross-resistant with any known antibiotic because of this unique mechanism (D. C. Eustice et. al., Antimicrob. Agents Chemother., 1988, 32, 1218 and Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 1988,150. 965).<br>
A feature of the oxazolidinone molecule is that only those compounds, which are enantiomers with a (5S)-acetamidomethyl configuration in the left side of the molecule are known to exhibit antibacterial activity (W. A. Gregory et. al., J. Med. Chem., 1989, 32, 1673-1681). Another feature is that most of such antibacterial compounds invariably carry a (substituted) phenyl ring attached to the nitrogen atom of the oxazolidinone ring in the right side of the molecule (B. Riedl et. al., Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents., Ashley Publications Ltd., 1999, 9 (5), 625-633 and the references contained therein).<br>
The most promising compound among the N-phenyl oxazolidinones, which has been approved for human use is (S)-N-[[3-[3-fluoro-4-(4-morpholinyl)phenyl]-2-oxo-5-oxazolidin-yl]methyl]-acetamide), commonly known as linezolid (M. Barbachyn et. al., WO 995/07271). Linezolid possesses good in vitro and in vivo potency against most of the Gram-positive bacteria, including resistant strains {Drugs of the Future, 1996,21.(11), 1116-1123).<br>
The left hand side i. e. position 5- and the right hand side i. e. position 3- respectively of<br>
the oxazolidinone ring nucleus allows for many variations and has resulted in the discovery of a<br>
large number of compounds having antimicrobial and antibacterial properties. Such<br>
representative compounds, albeit not meant to be limiting are disclosed in the following prior art<br>

The respective N-oxides of the group R2 of the compounds of formula I listed above also form a novel aspect of the present invention.<br>
The pharmaceutically active compounds of formula (I), the corresponding N-oxides of the group R2 and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof of this invention can be prepared by methods known to one skilled in the art.<br>
Typically, compounds of formula (I), can be prepared by coupling of the amino fragment of formula (II)<br><br><br><br>
Scheme-!<br>
General method for synthesis of compounds of formula (I)<br><br>
In a typical experiment, the amine compound of formula (II), wherein the groups A, B, and R2 have the same meanings as defined hereinbefore is dissolved in a 1:1 mixture of tertahydrofuran and water or a 1:1 mixture of methylene chloride and water. To the solution is added the carboxylic acid compound of formula (III), followed by addition of 1-hydroxybenztriazole (HOBt). The resulting mixture is cooled to a temperature of 0-5° C to which l-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride, 1.1 Eq.) is added and gradually allowed to warm to room temperature and agitated at this temperature for 24 hours. At the end of<br>
17<br><br>
the reaction, a solution of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate is added and the organic phase separated from the aqueous phase. Evaporation of the solvent and chromatography of the residue over silica gel affords compound of formula (I), generally as white solids.<br>
The N-oxides of the group R2 of compound of formula (I) thus obtained are preferably prepared by addition of m-chloro perbenzoic acid (m-CPBA) to a cooled solution of the compound of formula (I) in a chlorinated hydrocarbon solvent such as methylene chloride and ethylene chloride and thereafter agitating the reaction mixture at room temperature for 12-15 hours. Evaporation of the solvent under reduced pressure, followed by chromatography of the residue over silica gel affords the corresponding N-oxides in high purity.<br>
The N-oxides thus prepared, while retaining most of the antimycobacterial activity of the corresponding deoxo compound exhibit exceedingly high water solubility over the deoxo analogue, thereby helping in manufacture of suitable iv formulations, which forms an important aspect of this invention.<br>
The starting materials required for synthesis of compound of formula (I), thus involve the amine compound of formula II and the carboxylic acid compound of formula III.<br>
The amine compound of formula II can be selected from i)        (S) - N -[3 - (3 - fluoro - 4 - morpholinylphenyl) - 2 - oxo - 5 -  oxazolidinyl] methyl<br>

The method is essentially summarized in Scheme-II.<br><br><br>
In a typical method, morpholine, thiomorpholine, piperidine, 4-benzyl piperazine, pyrrolidine, 1,2,4-triazine, 12,3-benzotriazine, benzyl amine, a heterocycloalkyl or a heteroaryl moiety etc., each one of which corresponds to the group R2 defined hereinbefore is reacted with 3,4-difluoro nitrobenzene in the presence of a base and a solvent to give the corresponding derivative in which the fluorine atom at 4-position is substituted by the group R2. The nitro group in the compound thus obtained is reduced to amino group, which is thereafter protected by a suitable protective group. Reaction of the N-protected compound thus obtained with (R)-glycidyl butyrate in the presence of a strong base like n-butyl lithium leads to formation of the 5-hydroxymethyl oxazolidinone ring. The hydroxy group in the compound thus obtained is converted to sulfonyl derivative, for e.g. a methanesulfonyloxy (mesyl) or a p-toluenesulfonyloxy (tosyl) derivative by reaction with methanesulfonyl chloride or p-toluenesulfonyl chloride respectively. Reaction of the respective mesyl or tosyl derivative with sodium azide gives the corresponding azide, which is converted to the amine compound of formula (II) by standard methods, for e.g. by reaction with a triaryl/trialkyl phosphine, followed by hydrolysis.<br>

against M. tuberculosis including sensitive and resistant strains are summarized in Table-I. The MIC value of a representative preferred Compound No. 30 of   formula I against different species of mycobacteria is summarized in Table-II. in vitro Growth Inhibition assay<br>
The ability of the compounds 1-78 of formula (I) of this invention to inhibit the growth of Mycobacterium species was determined by the BACTEC 460 TB system. The reference strain M tuberculosis H37Rv ATCC 27294 was grown in Middlebrook 7H9 broth containing 10% ADC<br>
supplement at 37°C on a rotay shaker at 150 rpm for grown for 7days. The turbidity of the culture was adjusted to 1.0 Mc farland. The BACTEC 7H12B medium vials were seeded with 0.1ml of the 1.0 Mc farland adjusted M. tuberculosis culture. In the control vials 0.1ml of the culture was added after lOOfold dilution of the initial inoculum. Stock solution of lmg/ml of each compound was prepared in DMSO in separate sterile tubes. The compounds were further diluted to concentration of 25 ^g/100 ul, 0.1ml was than added to the 7H12B vial containing mycobacterial culture so that final concentration of the compound 6.25 u.g/ml. The cap in all the vials were cleaned with isopropanyl alcohol and kept in racks. The vials were then incubated at 37°C without shaking. Test vials was read daily on the BACTEC system till the GI of the control vial reached &gt; 30.Once the GI in the control reached 30 AGI (GI = GI (n&gt; - GI („.i) ) was determined for all test and control vials. If AGI of test vial is less than that of the control vial the culture was sensitive to the test compound. in vitro Agar Dilution assay<br>
MIC of compound of formula (I) of this invention against strains of Mycobacterium were determined by a reference agar dilution method as per the NCCLS- M24-T2. recommendations. The compounds were dissolved in DMSO and diluted twofold to obtain ten serial dilutions of each compound. Appropriate volume of compounds were incorporated into duplicate plates of Middlebrook7H10 agar medium supplemented with 10% Middlebrook supplement oleic acid-albumin-dextrose (OADC) enrichment at concentration of 0.03u,g/ml to 16|j,g/ml. Test organisms (mycobacterium strains) were grown in Middle brook 7H9 broth containing 0.05% Tween-80 and 10% ADC supplement. After 7 days of incubation at 37°C the broths were adjusted to the turbidity of 1.0 McFarland standard; the organism were further diluted 10 fold in sterile water containing 0.10% Tween-80. The resulting mycobacterial suspensions were spotted (3-5jxl/spot) onto drug supplemented 7H10 media plates. The plates were sealed and incubated at 37°Cfor 3-4 weeks in upright position. The MIC was recorded as the lowest dilution of the drug that completely inhibited the growth of test organisms. Test isolates included 10 clinical isolates that were generally susceptible to common tubercular agents and 10 strains that were resistant to one or more standard anti tubercular drugs. Appropriate reference strains and control drug was included in each batch of test.<br>

in vivo studies:<br>
The efficacy of the compound of formula (I) of this invention was also evaluated in murine model of pulmonary tuberculosis. Mycobacterium tuberculosis cultures grown in Middle brook 7H9 broth containing 0.05% Tween-80 and 10% ADC supplement at 37°C for 7 days on a rotary shaker. For, animal inoculation liquid cultures were declumped by brief sonication and were diluted appropriately in 7H9 broth to obtain a concentration of lxl07CFU's/ 0.2ml. Four-week-old male outbred Swiss albino mice housed in a pathogen free, biosafety level 3 environment within micro isolator cages were used throughout the study. Infections were produced by intravenous inoculation into caudal tail vein of 0.2ml of declumped M. tuberculosis suspension. Following infection, mice were randomly distributed in different groups of six each.<br>
Treatment for initial study was started one day after infection. For, treatment Compound No. 30 of formula I was dissolved in 10% PEG. Isoniazid was dissolved in sterile water. The drugs were prepared each morning prior to administration. Therapy was given 5 days per week for four weeks. All the agents were administered by gavage and were dosed at 50,25,12.5mg / kg of body weight. Control group of infected but untreated mice were killed at the initiation of therapy (early control) or at the end of the treatment period (late control). Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation 3-5 days after the administration of the last dose of drug. The spleens and right lung were removed aseptically and homogenized in tissue homogeniser. At least 4 serial tenfold dilution of the homogenate was plated onto selective Middlebrook 7H11 agar plates in duplicate. The colony counts were recorded after incubation at 37°C for 4 weeks. The viable cell counts were converted to Logio values. A compound showing 2 Log reduction in viable counts compared to the controls was considered significant.<br>

3.	PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel compounds belonging to the class of oxazolidinones useful in the treatment of acid fast organisms such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium spp. The present invention further relates to methods for preparation of the novel compounds and to pharmaceutical compositions containing the novel compounds useful in the treatment of tuberculosis. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Tuberculosis (TB), an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis is transmitted mainly through air, affecting most often the lungs. When persons with pulmonary TB cough they produce tiny droplet nuclei containing M. tuberculosis, which remain suspended in air for a prolonged period of time. A person who breathes the air containing the aforesaid droplet nuclei containing M. tuberculosis can become infected with TB.<br>
TB, one of the three major infectious diseases in the priority list of the World Health Organization's (WHO) agenda kills about two million people around the world every year. About six million new cases are reported every year and nearly 20% of adult deaths and 6% of infant deaths are attributable to the disease (C. Dye et. al., J. Am. Med. Ass., 1999, 282, 677-686). About a billion people are expected to be affected by TB by the year 2020, with 35 million likely to succumb to the disease (WHO Fact Sheet No. 104, Global Alliance for TB Drug Development- Executive Summary of the Scientific Blueprint for TB Development : http://www.who.int/inf-fs/en/factl04.html).<br>
With the emergence of the AIDS epidemic and the increase in cases of HIV coupled with TB as well as the continued resistance of M. tuberculosis to isoniazid and rifampicin, the two most powerful anti-tubercular drugs available today there is an urgent need for new anti-tubercular drugs to combat the killer disease (S. H. E. Kaufmann et. al., Trends Microbiol., 1993, 1,2-5 ; B. R. Bloom et. al., N. Engl. J. Med., 1998, 338, 677-678).<br>
Although, many new compounds are becoming available for fighting a number of infectious diseases, the number of such compounds having antimycobacterial activity are few. This could partly be due to the complexity of research involved and partly due to business considerations (B. N. Roy et. al., J. Ind. Chem. Soc, April 2002, 79, 320-335 and references cited therein).<br>
However, renewed thrust in research in the last decade has resulted in development of new antimycobacterial compounds,<br>
a)	differing widely in structures,<br>
b)	having different mode/mechanism of action,<br>
c)	possessing favourable pharmacokinetic properties,<br>
d)	which are safe and have low incidence of side-effects, and<br>
e)	which provide a cost-effective dosage regimen.<br>
2<br><br>
Among the aforesaid new compounds, the oxazolidinones first developed during the mid-1980s (W. A. Gregory et. al., J. Med. Chem., 1989, 32,1673-1681 and 1990,33,2569-2578 ; C-H Park et. al., J. Med. Chem., 1992, 35, 1156-1165) are a unique class in themselves. The in vivo results for some of the oxazolidinones show that they are active against various Gram-positive bacteria such as staphylococci, pneumococci and enterococci, including resistant strains such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA], methicillin-resistant Streptococcus epidermidis [MRSE], penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae [PRSP], vancomycin-resistant enterococci [VRE], etc. (B. Riedl et. al., Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents., Ashley Publications Ltd., 1999,9 (5), 625-633 and the references contained therein).<br>
The oxazolidinones inhibit bacterial protein synthesis at a very early step in the initiation of complex formation involved in the process of translating mRNA into protein. The oxazolidinones, in general, are not cross-resistant with any known antibiotic because of this unique mechanism (D. C. Eustice et. al., Antimicrob. Agents Chemother., 1988, 32, 1218 and Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 1988,150. 965).<br>
A feature of the oxazolidinone molecule is that only those compounds, which are enantiomers with a (5S)-acetamidomethyl configuration in the left side of the molecule are known to exhibit antibacterial activity (W. A. Gregory et. al., J. Med. Chem., 1989, 32, 1673-1681). Another feature is that most of such antibacterial compounds invariably carry a (substituted) phenyl ring attached to the nitrogen atom of the oxazolidinone ring in the right side of the molecule (B. Riedl et. al., Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents., Ashley Publications Ltd., 1999, 9 (5), 625-633 and the references contained therein).<br>
The most promising compound among the N-phenyl oxazolidinones, which has been approved for human use is (S)-N-[[3-[3-fluoro-4-(4-morpholinyl)phenyl]-2-oxo-5-oxazolidin-yl]methyl]-acetamide), commonly known as linezolid (M. Barbachyn et. al., WO 995/07271). Linezolid possesses good in vitro and in vivo potency against most of the Gram-positive bacteria, including resistant strains {Drugs of the Future, 1996,21.(11), 1116-1123).<br>
The left hand side i. e. position 5- and the right hand side i. e. position 3- respectively of<br>
the oxazolidinone ring nucleus allows for many variations and has resulted in the discovery of a<br>
large number of compounds having antimicrobial and antibacterial properties. Such<br>
representative compounds, albeit not meant to be limiting are disclosed in the following prior art<br>

General method for synthesis of compounds of formula (I)<br><br>
In a typical experiment, the amine compound of formula (II), wherein the groups A, B, and R2 have the same meanings as defined hereinbefore is dissolved in a 1:1 mixture of tertahydrofuran and water or a 1:1 mixture of methylene chloride and water. To the solution is added the carboxylic acid compound of formula (III), followed by addition of 1-hydroxybenztriazole (HOBt). The resulting mixture is cooled to a temperature of 0-5° C to which l-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride, 1.1 Eq.) is added and gradually allowed to warm to room temperature and agitated at this temperature for 24 hours. At the end of<br>
17<br><br>
the reaction, a solution of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate is added and the organic phase separated from the aqueous phase. Evaporation of the solvent and chromatography of the residue over silica gel affords compound of formula (I), generally as white solids.<br>
The N-oxides of the group R2 of compound of formula (I) thus obtained are preferably prepared by addition of m-chloro perbenzoic acid (m-CPBA) to a cooled solution of the compound of formula (I) in a chlorinated hydrocarbon solvent such as methylene chloride and ethylene chloride and thereafter agitating the reaction mixture at room temperature for 12-15 hours. Evaporation of the solvent under reduced pressure, followed by chromatography of the residue over silica gel affords the corresponding N-oxides in high purity.<br>
The N-oxides thus prepared, while retaining most of the antimycobacterial activity of the corresponding deoxo compound exhibit exceedingly high water solubility over the deoxo analogue, thereby helping in manufacture of suitable iv formulations, which forms an important aspect of this invention.<br>

In a typical method, morpholine, thiomorpholine, piperidine, 4-benzyl piperazine, pyrrolidine, 1,2,4-triazine, 12,3-benzotriazine, benzyl amine, a heterocycloalkyl or a heteroaryl moiety etc., each one of which corresponds to the group R2 defined hereinbefore is reacted with 3,4-difluoro nitrobenzene in the presence of a base and a solvent to give the corresponding derivative in which the fluorine atom at 4-position is substituted by the group R2. The nitro group in the compound thus obtained is reduced to amino group, which is thereafter protected by a suitable protective group. Reaction of the N-protected compound thus obtained with (R)-glycidyl butyrate in the presence of a strong base like n-butyl lithium leads to formation of the 5-hydroxymethyl oxazolidinone ring. The hydroxy group in the compound thus obtained is converted to sulfonyl derivative, for e.g. a methanesulfonyloxy (mesyl) or a p-toluenesulfonyloxy (tosyl) derivative by reaction with methanesulfonyl chloride or p-toluenesulfonyl chloride respectively. Reaction of the respective mesyl or tosyl derivative with sodium azide gives the corresponding azide, which is converted to the amine compound of formula (II) by standard methods, for e.g. by reaction with a triaryl/trialkyl phosphine, followed by hydrolysis.<br>

against M. tuberculosis including sensitive and resistant strains are summarized in Table-I. The MIC value of a representative preferred Compound No. 30 of   formula I against different species of mycobacteria is summarized in Table-II. in vitro Growth Inhibition assay<br>
The ability of the compounds 1-78 of formula (I) of this invention to inhibit the growth of Mycobacterium species was determined by the BACTEC 460 TB system. The reference strain M tuberculosis H37Rv ATCC 27294 was grown in Middlebrook 7H9 broth containing 10% ADC<br>
supplement at 37°C on a rotay shaker at 150 rpm for grown for 7days. The turbidity of the culture was adjusted to 1.0 Mc farland. The BACTEC 7H12B medium vials were seeded with 0.1ml of the 1.0 Mc farland adjusted M. tuberculosis culture. In the control vials 0.1ml of the culture was added after lOOfold dilution of the initial inoculum. Stock solution of lmg/ml of each compound was prepared in DMSO in separate sterile tubes. The compounds were further diluted to concentration of 25 ^g/100 ul, 0.1ml was than added to the 7H12B vial containing mycobacterial culture so that final concentration of the compound 6.25 u.g/ml. The cap in all the vials were cleaned with isopropanyl alcohol and kept in racks. The vials were then incubated at 37°C without shaking. Test vials was read daily on the BACTEC system till the GI of the control vial reached &gt; 30.Once the GI in the control reached 30 AGI (GI = GI (n&gt; - GI („.i) ) was determined for all test and control vials. If AGI of test vial is less than that of the control vial the culture was sensitive to the test compound. in vitro Agar Dilution assay<br>
MIC of compound of formula (I) of this invention against strains of Mycobacterium were determined by a reference agar dilution method as per the NCCLS- M24-T2. recommendations. The compounds were dissolved in DMSO and diluted twofold to obtain ten serial dilutions of each compound. Appropriate volume of compounds were incorporated into duplicate plates of Middlebrook7H10 agar medium supplemented with 10% Middlebrook supplement oleic acid-albumin-dextrose (OADC) enrichment at concentration of 0.03u,g/ml to 16|j,g/ml. Test organisms (mycobacterium strains) were grown in Middle brook 7H9 broth containing 0.05% Tween-80 and 10% ADC supplement. After 7 days of incubation at 37°C the broths were adjusted to the turbidity of 1.0 McFarland standard; the organism were further diluted 10 fold in sterile water containing 0.10% Tween-80. The resulting mycobacterial suspensions were spotted (3-5jxl/spot) onto drug supplemented 7H10 media plates. The plates were sealed and incubated at 37°Cfor 3-4 weeks in upright position. The MIC was recorded as the lowest dilution of the drug that completely inhibited the growth of test organisms. Test isolates included 10 clinical isolates that were generally susceptible to common tubercular agents and 10 strains that were resistant to one or more standard anti tubercular drugs. Appropriate reference strains and control drug was included in each batch of test.<br>

in vivo studies:<br>
The efficacy of the compound of formula (I) of this invention was also evaluated in murine model of pulmonary tuberculosis. Mycobacterium tuberculosis cultures grown in Middle brook 7H9 broth containing 0.05% Tween-80 and 10% ADC supplement at 37°C for 7 days on a rotary shaker. For, animal inoculation liquid cultures were declumped by brief sonication and were diluted appropriately in 7H9 broth to obtain a concentration of lxl07CFU's/ 0.2ml. Four-week-old male outbred Swiss albino mice housed in a pathogen free, biosafety level 3 environment within micro isolator cages were used throughout the study. Infections were produced by intravenous inoculation into caudal tail vein of 0.2ml of declumped M. tuberculosis suspension. Following infection, mice were randomly distributed in different groups of six each.<br>
Treatment for initial study was started one day after infection. For, treatment Compound No. 30 of formula I was dissolved in 10% PEG. Isoniazid was dissolved in sterile water. The drugs were prepared each morning prior to administration. Therapy was given 5 days per week for four weeks. All the agents were administered by gavage and were dosed at 50,25,12.5mg / kg of body weight. Control group of infected but untreated mice were killed at the initiation of therapy (early control) or at the end of the treatment period (late control). Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation 3-5 days after the administration of the last dose of drug. The spleens and right lung were removed aseptically and homogenized in tissue homogeniser. At least 4 serial tenfold dilution of the homogenate was plated onto selective Middlebrook 7H11 agar plates in duplicate. The colony counts were recorded after incubation at 37°C for 4 weeks. The viable cell counts were converted to Logio values. A compound showing 2 Log reduction in viable counts compared to the controls was considered significant.<br>

3.	PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel compounds belonging to the class of oxazolidinones useful in the treatment of acid fast organisms such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium spp. The present invention further relates to methods for preparation of the novel compounds and to pharmaceutical compositions containing the novel compounds useful in the treatment of tuberculosis. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Tuberculosis (TB), an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis is transmitted mainly through air, affecting most often the lungs. When persons with pulmonary TB cough they produce tiny droplet nuclei containing M. tuberculosis, which remain suspended in air for a prolonged period of time. A person who breathes the air containing the aforesaid droplet nuclei containing M. tuberculosis can become infected with TB.<br>
TB, one of the three major infectious diseases in the priority list of the World Health Organization's (WHO) agenda kills about two million people around the world every year. About six million new cases are reported every year and nearly 20% of adult deaths and 6% of infant deaths are attributable to the disease (C. Dye et. al., J. Am. Med. Ass., 1999, 282, 677-686). About a billion people are expected to be affected by TB by the year 2020, with 35 million likely to succumb to the disease (WHO Fact Sheet No. 104, Global Alliance for TB Drug Development- Executive Summary of the Scientific Blueprint for TB Development : http://www.who.int/inf-fs/en/factl04.html).<br>
With the emergence of the AIDS epidemic and the increase in cases of HIV coupled with TB as well as the continued resistance of M. tuberculosis to isoniazid and rifampicin, the two most powerful anti-tubercular drugs available today there is an urgent need for new anti-tubercular drugs to combat the killer disease (S. H. E. Kaufmann et. al., Trends Microbiol., 1993, 1,2-5 ; B. R. Bloom et. al., N. Engl. J. Med., 1998, 338, 677-678).<br>
Although, many new compounds are becoming available for fighting a number of infectious diseases, the number of such compounds having antimycobacterial activity are few. This could partly be due to the complexity of research involved and partly due to business considerations (B. N. Roy et. al., J. Ind. Chem. Soc, April 2002, 79, 320-335 and references cited therein).<br>
However, renewed thrust in research in the last decade has resulted in development of new antimycobacterial compounds,<br>
a)	differing widely in structures,<br>
b)	having different mode/mechanism of action,<br>
c)	possessing favourable pharmacokinetic properties,<br>
d)	which are safe and have low incidence of side-effects, and<br>
e)	which provide a cost-effective dosage regimen.<br>
2<br><br>
Among the aforesaid new compounds, the oxazolidinones first developed during the mid-1980s (W. A. Gregory et. al., J. Med. Chem., 1989, 32,1673-1681 and 1990,33,2569-2578 ; C-H Park et. al., J. Med. Chem., 1992, 35, 1156-1165) are a unique class in themselves. The in vivo results for some of the oxazolidinones show that they are active against various Gram-positive bacteria such as staphylococci, pneumococci and enterococci, including resistant strains such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA], methicillin-resistant Streptococcus epidermidis [MRSE], penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae [PRSP], vancomycin-resistant enterococci [VRE], etc. (B. Riedl et. al., Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents., Ashley Publications Ltd., 1999,9 (5), 625-633 and the references contained therein).<br>
The oxazolidinones inhibit bacterial protein synthesis at a very early step in the initiation of complex formation involved in the process of translating mRNA into protein. The oxazolidinones, in general, are not cross-resistant with any known antibiotic because of this unique mechanism (D. C. Eustice et. al., Antimicrob. Agents Chemother., 1988, 32, 1218 and Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 1988,150. 965).<br>
A feature of the oxazolidinone molecule is that only those compounds, which are enantiomers with a (5S)-acetamidomethyl configuration in the left side of the molecule are known to exhibit antibacterial activity (W. A. Gregory et. al., J. Med. Chem., 1989, 32, 1673-1681). Another feature is that most of such antibacterial compounds invariably carry a (substituted) phenyl ring attached to the nitrogen atom of the oxazolidinone ring in the right side of the molecule (B. Riedl et. al., Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents., Ashley Publications Ltd., 1999, 9 (5), 625-633 and the references contained therein).<br>
The most promising compound among the N-phenyl oxazolidinones, which has been approved for human use is (S)-N-[[3-[3-fluoro-4-(4-morpholinyl)phenyl]-2-oxo-5-oxazolidin-yl]methyl]-acetamide), commonly known as linezolid (M. Barbachyn et. al., WO 995/07271). Linezolid possesses good in vitro and in vivo potency against most of the Gram-positive bacteria, including resistant strains {Drugs of the Future, 1996,21.(11), 1116-1123).<br>
The left hand side i. e. position 5- and the right hand side i. e. position 3- respectively of<br>
the oxazolidinone ring nucleus allows for many variations and has resulted in the discovery of a<br>
large number of compounds having antimicrobial and antibacterial properties. Such<br>

General method for synthesis of compounds of formula (I)<br><br>
In a typical experiment, the amine compound of formula (II), wherein the groups A, B, and R2 have the same meanings as defined hereinbefore is dissolved in a 1:1 mixture of tertahydrofuran and water or a 1:1 mixture of methylene chloride and water. To the solution is added the carboxylic acid compound of formula (III), followed by addition of 1-hydroxybenztriazole (HOBt). The resulting mixture is cooled to a temperature of 0-5° C to which l-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride, 1.1 Eq.) is added and gradually allowed to warm to room temperature and agitated at this temperature for 24 hours. At the end of<br>
17<br><br>
the reaction, a solution of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate is added and the organic phase separated from the aqueous phase. Evaporation of the solvent and chromatography of the residue over silica gel affords compound of formula (I), generally as white solids.<br>
The N-oxides of the group R2 of compound of formula (I) thus obtained are preferably prepared by addition of m-chloro perbenzoic acid (m-CPBA) to a cooled solution of the compound of formula (I) in a chlorinated hydrocarbon solvent such as methylene chloride and ethylene chloride and thereafter agitating the reaction mixture at room temperature for 12-15 hours. Evaporation of the solvent under reduced pressure, followed by chromatography of the residue over silica gel affords the corresponding N-oxides in high purity.<br>
The N-oxides thus prepared, while retaining most of the antimycobacterial activity of the corresponding deoxo compound exhibit exceedingly high water solubility over the deoxo analogue, thereby helping in manufacture of suitable iv formulations, which forms an important aspect of this invention.<br>

In a typical method, morpholine, thiomorpholine, piperidine, 4-benzyl piperazine, pyrrolidine, 1,2,4-triazine, 12,3-benzotriazine, benzyl amine, a heterocycloalkyl or a heteroaryl moiety etc., each one of which corresponds to the group R2 defined hereinbefore is reacted with 3,4-difluoro nitrobenzene in the presence of a base and a solvent to give the corresponding derivative in which the fluorine atom at 4-position is substituted by the group R2. The nitro group in the compound thus obtained is reduced to amino group, which is thereafter protected by a suitable protective group. Reaction of the N-protected compound thus obtained with (R)-glycidyl butyrate in the presence of a strong base like n-butyl lithium leads to formation of the 5-hydroxymethyl oxazolidinone ring. The hydroxy group in the compound thus obtained is converted to sulfonyl derivative, for e.g. a methanesulfonyloxy (mesyl) or a p-toluenesulfonyloxy (tosyl) derivative by reaction with methanesulfonyl chloride or p-toluenesulfonyl chloride respectively. Reaction of the respective mesyl or tosyl derivative with sodium azide gives the corresponding azide, which is converted to the amine compound of formula (II) by standard methods, for e.g. by reaction with a triaryl/trialkyl phosphine, followed by hydrolysis.<br>

The compound of formula (I) of the present invention displayed antimycobacterial activity when tested by in vitro growth inhibition assay and agar incorporation methods. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (jag/ml) obtained for representative compounds of formula (I)<br>
41<br><br>
against M. tuberculosis including sensitive and resistant strains are summarized in Table-I. The MIC value of a representative preferred Compound No. 30 of   formula I against different species of mycobacteria is summarized in Table-II. in vitro Growth Inhibition assay<br>
The ability of the compounds 1-78 of formula (I) of this invention to inhibit the growth of Mycobacterium species was determined by the BACTEC 460 TB system. The reference strain M tuberculosis H37Rv ATCC 27294 was grown in Middlebrook 7H9 broth containing 10% ADC<br>
supplement at 37°C on a rotay shaker at 150 rpm for grown for 7days. The turbidity of the culture was adjusted to 1.0 Mc farland. The BACTEC 7H12B medium vials were seeded with 0.1ml of the 1.0 Mc farland adjusted M. tuberculosis culture. In the control vials 0.1ml of the culture was added after lOOfold dilution of the initial inoculum. Stock solution of lmg/ml of each compound was prepared in DMSO in separate sterile tubes. The compounds were further diluted to concentration of 25 ^g/100 ul, 0.1ml was than added to the 7H12B vial containing mycobacterial culture so that final concentration of the compound 6.25 u.g/ml. The cap in all the vials were cleaned with isopropanyl alcohol and kept in racks. The vials were then incubated at 37°C without shaking. Test vials was read daily on the BACTEC system till the GI of the control vial reached &gt; 30.Once the GI in the control reached 30 AGI (GI = GI (n&gt; - GI („.i) ) was determined for all test and control vials. If AGI of test vial is less than that of the control vial the culture was sensitive to the test compound. in vitro Agar Dilution assay<br>
MIC of compound of formula (I) of this invention against strains of Mycobacterium were determined by a reference agar dilution method as per the NCCLS- M24-T2. recommendations. The compounds were dissolved in DMSO and diluted twofold to obtain ten serial dilutions of each compound. Appropriate volume of compounds were incorporated into duplicate plates of Middlebrook7H10 agar medium supplemented with 10% Middlebrook supplement oleic acid-albumin-dextrose (OADC) enrichment at concentration of 0.03u,g/ml to 16|j,g/ml. Test organisms (mycobacterium strains) were grown in Middle brook 7H9 broth containing 0.05% Tween-80 and 10% ADC supplement. After 7 days of incubation at 37°C the broths were adjusted to the turbidity of 1.0 McFarland standard; the organism were further diluted 10 fold in sterile water containing 0.10% Tween-80. The resulting mycobacterial suspensions were spotted (3-5jxl/spot) onto drug supplemented 7H10 media plates. The plates were sealed and incubated at 37°Cfor 3-4 weeks in upright position. The MIC was recorded as the lowest dilution of the drug that completely inhibited the growth of test organisms. Test isolates included 10 clinical isolates that were generally susceptible to common tubercular agents and 10 strains that were resistant to one or more standard anti tubercular drugs. Appropriate reference strains and control drug was included in each batch of test.<br>

in vivo studies:<br>
The efficacy of the compound of formula (I) of this invention was also evaluated in murine model of pulmonary tuberculosis. Mycobacterium tuberculosis cultures grown in Middle brook 7H9 broth containing 0.05% Tween-80 and 10% ADC supplement at 37°C for 7 days on a rotary shaker. For, animal inoculation liquid cultures were declumped by brief sonication and were diluted appropriately in 7H9 broth to obtain a concentration of lxl07CFU's/ 0.2ml. Four-week-old male outbred Swiss albino mice housed in a pathogen free, biosafety level 3 environment within micro isolator cages were used throughout the study. Infections were produced by intravenous inoculation into caudal tail vein of 0.2ml of declumped M. tuberculosis suspension. Following infection, mice were randomly distributed in different groups of six each.<br>
Treatment for initial study was started one day after infection. For, treatment Compound No. 30 of formula I was dissolved in 10% PEG. Isoniazid was dissolved in sterile water. The drugs were prepared each morning prior to administration. Therapy was given 5 days per week for four weeks. All the agents were administered by gavage and were dosed at 50,25,12.5mg / kg of body weight. Control group of infected but untreated mice were killed at the initiation of therapy (early control) or at the end of the treatment period (late control). Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation 3-5 days after the administration of the last dose of drug. The spleens and right lung were removed aseptically and homogenized in tissue homogeniser. At least 4 serial tenfold dilution of the homogenate was plated onto selective Middlebrook 7H11 agar plates in duplicate. The colony counts were recorded after incubation at 37°C for 4 weeks. The viable cell counts were converted to Logio values. A compound showing 2 Log reduction in viable counts compared to the controls was considered significant.<br>
The in vivo data for a representative compound of formula (I) is given in Table-II.<br>
Acute toxicity of Compound No. 30 of Chart-I was estimated in mice and the LDo was found to be &gt;1000 mg/kg P. O.<br>
