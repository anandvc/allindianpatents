DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Definitions<br>
As used herein, the terms "administering", "administration", and (ike terms refer to any method which, in sound medical or cosmetic practice, delivers the composition to a subject in such a manner as to provide a therapeutic effect<br>
The phrase "aqueous solvent" as used herein refers to a solvent such as water or containing water. Other dissolved components may be present in small amounts, such as, for example, salts, buffers, and other components understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to be optionally present in an aqueous solution.<br>
The phrase "crystalline form" as used herein refers to crystals of the same molecule having different physical properties as a result of the order of the molecules in the crystal lattice. Accordingly, as used herein the phrase "crystalline form" is intended to refer to different crystalline forms, polyniorphs, pseudopotymorphs, and solvate forms of a single molecular entity. Different crystalline forms of a single compound may have different chemical, physical, mechanical, electrical, thermodynamic, and/or biological properties from each other. The differences in physical properties exhibited by crystalline forms affect pharmaceutical parameters such as storage stability, compressibility, density (important in formulation and product manufacturing), dissolution rates (an important factor in determining bio-availability), solubility, melting point, chemical stability, physical stability, powder flowability, compaction, and particle morphology. Each separate crystalline form of an individual compound will exhibit consistent chemical, physical, mechanical, electrical, thermodynamic, and biological properties.<br>
12<br><br>
The phrase "derivative" as used herein refers to any hydrate, solvate, salt, racemate, isomer, enantiomer, prodrug, metabolite, ester, or other analog or derivative of a particular chemical compound or molecule. The term "derivative" may also mean a modification to the disclosed compounds including, but not limited to, hydrolysis, reduction, or oxidation products, of the disclosed compounds. Hydrolysis, reduction, and oxidation reactions are known in the art.<br>
Differences in stability can result from changes in chemical reactivity (e.g. differential oxidation, such that a dosage form discolors more rapidly when comprised of one crystalline form than when comprised of another crystalline form) or mechanical changes (e.g. tablets crumble on storage as a kinetically favored crystalline form converts to thermodynamically more stable crystalline form) or both (e.g. tablets of one crystalline form are more susceptible to breakdown at high humidity). As a result of solubility/dissolution differences, some crystalline form transitions affect potency and/or toxicity. In addition, the physical properties of the crystal may be important in processing; for example, one crystalline form might be more likely to form solvates or might be difficult to filter and wash free of impurities (i.e. particle shape and size distribution might be different between one crystalline form relative to the other).<br>
As used herein, the phrases an "effective amount" or a "therapeutically effective amount" of an active agent or ingredient, or pharmaceutically active agent or ingredient, which are synonymous herein, refer to an amount of the pharmaceutically active agent sufficient enough to have a therapeutic effect upon administration. A therapeutically effective amount of the pharmaceutically active agent may, will, or is expected to cause a relief of symptoms. Effective amounts of the pharmaceutically active agent will vary with the particular condition or conditions being treated, the severity of the condition, the duration of the treatment, the specific components of the composition being used, and like factors.<br>
As used herein, the phrase "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" refers to salts of certain ingredient(s) which possess the same activity as the unmodified compound(s) and which are neither biologically nor otherwise undesirable.

Of these different crystalline forms, the most preferred will provide an antifungal, antimicrobial drug having the lowest impurity content, most consistent product quality, most consistent physical characteristics including color, rate of dissolution, and ease of handling, and greatest long term stability in comparison to the other crystalline forms or the amorphous form.<br>
Accordingly, the present subject matter relates to methods of identifying, obtaining, and purifying the various crystalline forms of (1R,2R)-7-chloro-3-p-(2.4-difluorophenyl)-<br>
15<br><br>
2-hydroxy-1-methyl-3-(1H-1l2l4-triazoH-yl)propyl]quinazolin-4(3H)-one.	These<br>
crystalline forms, namely Forms I-VI, were identified as six distinct crystal forms. Certain physical characteristics of these crystalline forms generated during crystallization studies, are as follows:<br>
•	Form I: typically obtained by crystallizing the amorphous form using supercritical C02 crystallization conditions. This form displays a characteristic XRPD pattern, a characteristic IR spectrum, and a characteristic DSC profile.<br>
•	Form II: typically obtained by crystallizing the amorphous fonn using supercritical CO2 crystallization conditions. This form displays a characteristic XRPD pattern, a characteristic IR spectrum, and a characteristic DSC profile.<br>
•	Form III: typically obtained under standard crystallization conditions using a variety of solvents such as ethanol, ethyl acetate, dichloromethane, and a combination of ethanol and ethyl acetate. This form displays a characteristic XRPD pattern, a characteristic IR spectrum, and a DSC profile with a strong en do thermic peak onset at about 99*C. No degradation products of form III were detected after 6 months of storage at 30eC/65% RH and 25°C/60% RH.<br>
•	Form IV: typically obtained by first dissolving any form in ethanol, then suspending this solution in water and stirring for a certain amount of time. This form may also be obtained directly from the amorphous form or Forms III or VI of (1R,2R)-7-chloro-3-[2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-2-hydroxy-1-methyl-3-(1H-1(2.4-triazoM -yl)propyI]quinazolin-4(3H)-one after storage for an extended period of time, for example after storage for 3 months at 40°C and 75% RH, as some but not all of the original form converts to Form IV. This form displays a characteristic XRPD pattern, a characteristic IR spectrum, and a DSC profile with a strong endothermic peak onset at about 121 °C.<br>
•	Form V: typically obtained under standard crystallization conditions, typically by first dissolving the amorphous form in ethyl acetate, then adding hexane to this solution. Diethyl ether can then be optionally added. This form displays a characteristic XRPD pattern, a characteristic IR spectrum, and a DSC profile with a strong endothermic peak onset at about 108°C. Form V can best be characterized as a crystalline phase containing between about 2 and about 7% by weight of ethyl acetate and about 0.5 to about 2.5% by weight of hexane.<br>
•	Form VI: typically obtained by slurrying (1R,2R)-7-chloro-3-[2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-2-hydroxy-1-methyl-3-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)propyfJ       quinazolin-<br>

4(3H)-one in aqueous ethanol or by slowly cooling a saturated aqueous ethanol solution that was seeded. This form may be obtained when the slurry comprises any other Form of (1R,2R-7-chlorD-3-I2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-2-hydroxy'1-methyl-3-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)propyf] quinazolin-4(3H)-one, such as, for example, the amorphous form, Form III, Form IV, Form V, or combinations thereof. Complete conversion of a Form III slurry at 45"C to Form VI was noted after 3 hours in ethanol-water (1*91* High, water activities are preferred far preparing Form VI to ensure that Forms III and/or V are not generated. This form displays a characteristic XRPD pattern, a characteristic IR spectrum, and a DSC profile with a strong endothermlc peak ranging from about 102'C to 108"C. Form VI can best be characterized as a non-hygroscopic monohydrate.<br>

Optimal XRPD methods to analyze Form VI can typically either entail spinning a capillary (Inel) using t method (1) shown below or spinning a flat sample (Shimadzu) using a method (2) shown below. Figure 16 is obtained using the following method (1).<br>
(1)	The XRPD pattern for Form VI was measured using an Inel XRG-3000<br>
dtffractometer equipped with a CPS (Curved Position Sensitive) detector with a 28<br>
range of 120". Real time data were collected using Cu-Ka radiation. The tube voltage<br>
and amperage were set to 40 kV and 30 mA, respectively. The monochromator slit was<br>
set at 5 mm by 160 urn The pattern is displayed from 2.5-40 °28. Samples were<br>
prepared for analysis by packing them into thin-walled glass capillaries. Each capillary<br>
was mounted onto a goniometer head that is motorized to permit spinning of the<br>
capillary during data acquisition. The samples were analyzed for 300 sec. Instrument<br>
calibration was performed using a silicon reference standard.<br>
(2)	Alternatively, X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) analyses were performed using<br>
a Shimadzu XRD-6000 X-ray powder diffractometer using Cu Ka radiation. The<br>
instrument was equipped with a long fine focus X-ray tube. The tube voltage and<br>
amperage were set to 40 kV and 40 mA, respectively. The divergence and scattering<br>
slits were set at 1° and the receiving slit was set at 0.15 mm. Diffracted radiation was<br>
detected by a Nal scintillation detector. A Q~28 continuous scan at fVmin (0.4 sec/0.02 °<br>
step) from 2.5 to 40° 29 was used. The sample was spun at a rate of 25 rpm. A silicon<br>
standard was analyzed to check the instrument alignment Data were collected and<br>
analyzed using XRD-6100/7000 v. 5.0. Samples were prepared for analysis by placing<br>
them in an aluminum holder with silicon well.<br>

=: Infrared spectra were acquired on a Magna-IR 060® Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrophotometer (Thermo Nicolet) equipped with an Ever-Glo mid/far IR source, an extended range potassium bromide (KBr) beamsplitter, and a deuterated triglycine sulfate (DTGS) detector. A diffuse reflectance accessory (the Collector™, Thermo Spectra-Tech) was used for sampling. Each spectrum represents 256 co-added scans collected at a spectral resolution of 2 cm'1. Sample preparation consisted of placing the sample into a 13-mm diameter cup and leveling the material with a frosted glass slide. A background data set was acquired with an alignment mirror in place. A Log MR {R = reflectance) spectrum was acquired by taking a ratio of these two data sets against each other. Wavelength calibration was performed using polystyrene.<br>

_ A colorless needle of CzoHieCIFiNsC.I-bO was isolated from 1:1 ethanol-water slurry and the structure determined by single crystal. X-ray diffraction. The needle having approximate dimensions of 0.45 x 0.13 x 0.13 mm was mounted on a glass fiber in a random orientation. Preliminary examination and data collection were performed using Mo Ka radiation (K = 0.71073A) on a Nonius KappaCCD equipped with a graphite crystal, incident beam monochromator.<br>
Cell constants for data collection were obtained from least-squares refinement, using the setting angles of 6937 reflections in the range 3 
The data were collected at a temperature of 150K. Data were collected to a maximum 2 6 of 50.1°.<br>
Data Reduction<br>
A total of 6937 reflections were collected, of which 3516 were unique. Frames were integrated with DENZO-SMN (Z. Otwinowski and W. Minor, Methods Enzymol., 276.307.1997).<br>
-" Lorentz and polarization corrections were applied to the data. The linear absorption coefficient is 2.3 /cm for Mo Ka radiation. An empirical absorption correction using SCALEPACK (Z. Otwinowski and W. Minor, Methods Enzymol., 276. 307, 1997) was applied. Transmission coefficients ranged from 0.934 to 0.970. Intensities of equivalent reflections were averaged. The agreement factor for the averaging was 14.2% based on intensity.<br>

Structure Solution and Refinement<br>
The structure was solved by direct methods usin9 SIR2004 (M. C. Burla. R. Caliandro, M. Camalli, B. Carrozzini, G. L. Cascarano, L» °e caro, C. Giacovazzo, G. Polidori, and R. Spagna.. J. Appl. Cryst, 38, 381, 2005. the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety). The remaining atoms were located in succeeding difference Fourier syntheses. Hydrogen atoms were included in the refinement but restrained to ride on the atom to which tHev are bonded. The structure was refined in full-matrix least-squares by minimizing the function:<br>
The weight w is defined as l/lo^FoVl 9322P1 where P=(F02 +2Fcz)/3.<br>
Scattering factors were taken from the "International Tables for Crystal log raphy** ("International Tables for Crystallography", Vol. C, KUiwer Academic Publishers, Utrecht, The Netherlands, 1992, Tables 4.2.6.8 and 6.1.* -4- the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety). Of the 3516 reflections used in the refinements only 2654 reflections with F02&gt;2o (F02) wef* used in calculating R1. The final cycle of refinement included 293 variable parameters and converged (largest parameter shift was 
Z-HF.-F.VI.F. =0.069<br>
The standard deviation of an observation of unit weight was 1.09. The highest peak in the final difference Fourier had a height of 0.20 e/A3- Tne minimum negative peak had a height of -0.30 e/A3. The factor for the determination of the absolute structure (H. D. Flack, Acta Cryst, A39, 876, 1983, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety) refined to 0.02.<br>
60<br><br>
Refinement was performed on a LINUX PC using SHELX-97 (G. M. Shetdrick, SHELXL97. A Program for Crystal Structure Refinement Univ. of Gottingen, Germany, 1997, the contents of the program, and user manuals of the program, are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety). Crystal log rap hie drawings were done using programs ORTEP (C. K. Johnson, ORTEPII, Report ORNL-5138. Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Tennessee, USA, 1976 the contents of the report, the program, and user manuals of the program, are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety) and Mercury (Mercury 1.4.1, Cambridge Crystallographic Diffraction Center, Cambridge, 2005, the contents of the program, and user manuals of the program, are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety).<br>
The orthorhombic cell parameters and calculated volume were: a = 12.0968(15)A, 6 = 12.6245(16)A, c = 13.3520(19)A, a  0 « y = 90°. V * 2039.1(5)A3. For Z = 4 and formula weight = 449.65g/mol, the calculated density is 1.47 g/cm3. The quality of the structure obtained was reasonable, as indicated by the R-value of 6.9%. Usually R-values in the range of 2 to 6% are quoted for the most reliably determined structures (J. Glusker, K. True blood, Crystal Structure Analysis: A Primer, 2nd ed.; Oxford University press: New York, 1985; p.87, the contents of the entire book are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety).<br>
Structure Drawings and Packing Diagrams<br>
An ORTEP drawing of Form VI is shown in Figure 19. The asymmetric unit shown in Figure 19 contains one molecule of Form VI and one water molecule.<br>
Packing diagrams viewed along the a, b, and c crystallographic axes are shown in Figure 20, Figure 21, and Figure 22, respectively. Hydrogen bonding between adjacent Form VI and water molecules generates a three-dimensional network. The water molecules reside in channels running parallel to the crystallographic a axis (Figure 23). Packing diagrams were prepared using Mercury modeling software. Hydrogen bonds are represented as dashed lines.<br>

In a further embodiment, the process further comprises refluxing the solution or suspension of (1R,2R)-7-chtoro-3-[2-{2,4-difluorophenyl)-2-hydroxy-1 -methyl-3-{1 H-1,2,4-triazoM -yl)propyl]quinazolin-4(3H)-one and ethanol before adding the mixture to water.

one and ethanol before adding the mixture to water.<br>
Form VI may be prepared by slurrying albaconazole in aqueous ethanol or by slowly cooling a saturated aqueous ethanol solution that was seeded.    In order to<br>
85<br><br>
estimate rate of conversion, a slurry experiment of Form III was setup at 45°C in ethanol-water (1:9), seeded with Form VI and aliquots periodically removed. Solids from the first aliquot removed after - 3 hours were composed of only Form VI by XRPD analysis. A slow cool method was also attempted by cooling a saturated solution of albaconazole in aqueous ethanot that was seeded. Form VI solids were isolated in a 41% yield.<br>
It is further noted that the process for making Form VI is similar to the process for making Form IV. Embodiments of both processes may use the same or similar ratios of ethanolrwater and similar mixing and stirring methods. En this regard, it is contemplated herein that, in one process of making Form VI, the (1R,2R)-7-ohloro-3-[2-(2,4-difluoropheny!)-2-hydroxy-1-rnethyl-3-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-y])propyl]quinazolin-4(3H)-one first proceeds through the crystalline Form IV before continuing on to Form VI when starting with the same aqueous solvent-(1R,2R)-7-chloro-3-[2-{2,4-difluorophenyl)-2-hydroxy-1-methyl-3-(1 H-1,2,4-triazoM-yl)propyl]quinazolin-4(3H)-one mixture. In one embodiment. Form IV is an intermediate in the productbn of Fomi VI, and the rate of the transformation is a function of the ratio of solvents, temperature, stirring, and time. In general, shorter stirring times and lower stirring temperatures favor formation of Form IV, while longer stir times and higher stirring temperatures favor formation of Form VI. For example, in this regard, Form VI can be obtained in aqueous ethanol at 22°C after about 6 hours of stirring; and at 28°C after about 5 hours of stirring. One can also allow the process to proceed longer, for example, 18-24 hr, and still obtain Form VI. Selection of solvent may also affect the time it takes for Form IV to convert to Form VI. For example, in some embodiments, Form VI may form in aqueous ethanol or aqueous acetone in 3-7 hours; or Form VI may form in aqueous methanol or aqueous isopropanol or aqueous n-propanol only after 7-18 hours. In a preferred embodiment, a minimum stirring time of 5 hr is required to prepare Form VI. The presence of Form IV or Form VI can be monitored by an appropriate technique, such as, for example, microscopy or x-ray diffraction, in order to determine the best time/conditions for its isolation<br>

Dosage<br>
Appropriate dosage levels for any of the crystalline forms of any of the active ingredients and/or their specific crystal forms are well known to those of ordinary skill In the art and are selected to maximize the treatment of the previously described microbial and/or fungal conditions. Dosage levels on the order of about 0.001 mg to about 5,000 mg per kilogram body weight of the active ingredient components are known to be "useftJTTn the treatment of the diseases, disorders, and conditions contemplated herein. Typically, this effective amount of the active agent will generally comprise from about 0.001 mg to about 100 mg per kilogram of patient body weight per day. Moreover, ft will be understood that this dosage of ingredients can be administered in a single or multiple dosage units to provide the desired therapeutic effect.<br>
If desired, other therapeutic agents can be employed in conjunction with those provided in the above-described compositions. The amount of pharmaceutical active ingredients that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated, the nature of the disease, disorder, or condition, and the nature of the active ingredients.<br>
The preferred pharmaceutical compositions may be given In a single or multiple doses daily. In a preferred embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions are given from one to three times daily. Starting with a low dose twice dairy and slowly working up to higher doses rf needed is a preferred strategy. The amount of pharmaceutically active ingredients that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated, the nature of the disease, disorder, or condition, and the nature of the active ingredients.<br>
It is understood, however, that a specific dose level for any particular patient will vary depending upon a variety of factors, including the activity of the specific pharmaceutically active agent; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient; the time of administration; the rate of excretion; possible drug combinations; the severity of the particular condition being treated; and the form of administration. One of ordinary skill in the art would appreciate the variability of such factors and would be able to establish specific dose levels using no more than routine experimentation.<br>
The optimal pharmaceutical formulations will be determined by one skilled in the art depending upon considerations such as the particular pharmaceutically active agent combination and the desired dosage.
