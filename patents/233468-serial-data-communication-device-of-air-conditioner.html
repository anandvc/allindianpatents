				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a serial data communication device of an air conditioner which is capable of executing a serial data communication by using an alternating current power line between an indoor microprocessor and an outdoor microprocessor.<br>
Discussion of Related Art<br>
Generally, an air conditioner is comprised of an indoor heat exchanger and an outdoor heat exchanger. In the air conditioner, typically, an indoor device is occupied on the interior of space in which air conditioning and dehumidification are needed and an outdoor device is occupied on the outside of the above space. For example, in case of house or building, the area in which the air conditioner is to be installed is firstly divided into an indoor area in which a human body dwells and an outdoor area.<br>
Such the air conditioner includes a compressor which serves to compress<br>
refrigerant, an outdoor heat	exchange which<br>
expands the refrigerant within a passage, a capillary tube which functions to reduce the pressure of refrigerant within the compressor, and an indoor heat exchanger to which an indoor fan is attached, each of which is connected by a pipe line.<br>
FIG. I is a circuit diagram illustrating a serial data communication device of an air conditioner in the prior art. Referring to FIG. 1, the conventional communication device connects an indoor microprocessor 50 with an outdoor microprocessor 10 by means of a connector CNT1, thus to achieve the communication between the indoor/outdoor microprocessors and to accomplish the supply of an alternating current power to the outdoor microprocessor 10.<br>
In more detail, terminals C and D of the connector CNT1 serve to supply the alternating current power to the outdoor microprocessor 10, and terminals A and B of the connector CNT1 forms a communication line between the indoor microprocessor 50 and the outdoor microprocessor 10, to thereby achieve a serial data communication therebetween.<br>
A data transmission process from the indoor microprocessor 50 to the outdoor microprocessor 10 will be firstly discussed.<br>
In the case where data transmission of the indoor microprocessor 50 to the outdoor microprocessor 10 is<br>
performed, a data receiving terminal RXD1 of the indoor microprocessor 50 is in a disabled state, and then a data transmitting terminal TXD1 of the indoor microprocessor 50 outputs the data to be transmitted to the outdoor microprocessor 10.<br>
Next, a first comparator COMP1 compares an output voltage waveform with a reference voltage waveform which is adjusted by resistors R2 and R3, to thereby output the compared result to the terminal A of the connector CNT1 through an output resistor R9 and a pull-up resistor R10.<br>
Then, the transmission data on the data transmitting terminal TXD1 of the indoor microprocessor 50 is transmitted through a first photocoupler PC1. Thereafter, the transmission data is passed through a pull-up resistor R12 and a load resisuor R13, to prevent the generation of noise therein, and is then transmitted to a data receiving terminal RXD2 of the outdoor microprocessor 10.<br>
Secondly, in the case where data transmission of the outdoor microprocessor 10.to the indoor microprocessor 50 is performed, the data receiving terminal RXD2 of the outdoor microprocessor 10 is in a disabled state, and then a data transmitting terminal TXD2 of the outdoor microprocessor 10 outputs the data to be transmitted to the indoor microprocessor 50. Then, the data outputted from the data<br>
transmitting terminal TXD2 is transmitted through a second photocoupler PC2 and is finally applied to an input terminal of a second comparator COMP2 through resistors R14, R9 and R7 and a pull-up resistor R10.<br>
Next, the second comparator COMP2 compares the output voltage level of the data transmitted from the outdoor microprocessor 10 with the reference voltage level to thereby output the compared result to the data receiving terminal RXD1 of the indoor microprocessor 50, thus to achieve a desired data communication between the indoor microprocessor 50 and the outdoor microprocessor 10.<br>
A reference numeral R4 denotes a load resistor, R5 a pull-up resistor, each of R5 and R8 a divisional pressure resistor, and R16 a protection resistor of a light emitting diode LED1. Further, each of reference numerals C1, C2 and C3 represents a noise removing condenser.<br>
However, the conventional serial data communication device in an air conditioner should require two power lines for supplying an alternating current power and two communication lines for exchanging data, such that there is a problem in that the disconnection between the alternating current power lines and the communication lines may be generated, which results in the damage of peripheral circuits thereof, unfortunately.<br>
Moreover, the conventional serial data communication device in an air conditioner should have a single connector in which the alternating power lines and the communication lines are all formed, such that there is a problem in that noises in data during the data transmission may be generated.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a serial data communication device of an air conditioner that substantially obviates one or more of the problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related art.<br>
An object of the invention is to provide a serial data communication device of an air conditioner which can form a communication line by using alternating current power lines, thus to decrease the number of communication lines between an indoor microprocessor and an outdoor microprocessor and at the same time to prevent peripheral circuits from being damaged due to the disconnection of the lines.<br>

Now, an explanation of operation and effects of a serial data communication device of an air conditioner according to the present invention will be discussed hereinafter.<br>
First, if the air conditioner is operated, the rectification part 30 converts the alternating current power into the direct current power, and a signal of a logic "high" level is outputted to the data transmitting terminals TXD11 and TXD51 of the outdoor microprocessor 10 and the indoor microprocessor 50, respectively,-to thereby enable the first and second switching transistors Q21 and Q41 and to thereby enable the photodiodes of the first and third insulation switching parts PC21 and PC41. At the same time, the data receiving terminals RXD11 and RXD51 of the outdoor microprocessor 10 and the indoor microprocessor 50 are in an<br>
enabled state, to thereby be in a standby state for reception of the data.<br>
Meanwhile, if the outdoor microprocessor 10 receives the data in the state where the receiving terminals RXD11 and RXD51 are in the standby state, the data is passed in order of the resistor R22, the first switching transistor Q21, the first insulation switching part PC21, the second insulation switching part PC22, the resistor R25, the diode D21, the connector CNT2, the diode D41, the resistor R41, the third insulation switching part PC41, the fourth insulation switching part PC42, and the resistors R45 and R48 and is finally transmitted to the data receiving terminal RXD51 of the indoor microcomputer 50.<br>

In the case where data transmission of the indoor microprocessor 50 to the outdoor microprocessor 10 is executed, the second switching transistor Q41 and the third insulation switching part PC41 are turned on/off in accordance with the control signal outputted from the data transmitting terminal TXD51. As a result, the second insulation switching<br>
part PC22 is turned on/off, to thereby transmit the data to the data receiving terminal RXD11 of the outdoor microprocessor 10 through the resistor R27.<br>
In other words, since the data transmitting terminal TXD11 of the outdoor microprocessor 10 is in a logic "high" state, the first switching transistor Q21 and the first insulation switching part PC21 are enabled. As a result, the power is applied through the second insulation switching part PC22 to the third insulation switching part PC41. The second insulation switching part PC22 is turned on/off as the third insulation switching part PC41 is turned on/off, such that the data is finally transmitted to the data receiving terminal RXD11 of the outdoor microprocessor 10.<br>
FIG. 6 is a waveform diagram illustrating transmission signals of each parts, during data transmission of the outdoor microprocessor 10 to the indoor microprocessor 50 is executed.<br>
Hence, it can be appreciated in the serial data communication device of an air conditioner according to the present invention that two lines for supplying the alternating current power and a single line for transmitting the data are required, for the purpose of achieving the power supply and data transmission/reception.<br>
As clearly apparent from the foregoing, a serial data communication device of an air conditioner according to the<br>
present invention has the following advantages: since a communication line is formed by using alternating power lines, the number of communication lines between an indoor microprocessor and an outdoor microprocessor can be reduced and the generation of noises in data during the data transmission can be prevented. Furthermore, a serial data communication device of an air conditioner according to the present invention can previously avoid the disconnection of the communication line, to thereby prevent the peripheral circuits from being damaged due to the disconnection thereof.<br>
It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in a serial data communication device of an air conditioner of the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention.
