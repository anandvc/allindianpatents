7-Aminotriazolopyrimidines, processes and intermediates for their preparation, compositions comprising them and their use for controlling harmful fungi<br>
The present invention relates to 7-aminotriazolopyrimidines of<br>
the formula I,		—<br><br>

where R1 and R2, independently of one another, may, if they are not hydrogen, be partially or fully halogenated and/or may carry one to three radicals from the group Ra<br>
Ra      is cyano, nitro, hydroxyl, Ci-Ce-alkyl, C1-C6-haloalkyl, C3-C6-cycloalkyl, C1-C6-alkoxy, C1-C6-haloalkoxy, C1-C6-alkylthio, C1-C6-alkylamino, di-C1-C6-alkylamino, C2-Ce-alkenyl, C2-C6-alkenyloxy, C2-C6-alkynyl, C3-C8-alkynyloxy and unhalogenated or halogenated oxy-C1-C4-alkyleneoxy,<br>
or<br>
R1 and R2 together with the linking nitrogen atom may form a 5- or 6-membered ring which contains one to four nitrogen atoms or one to three nitrogen atoms and one sulfur or oxygen atom and which may be substituted by one to three radicals from the group Ra;<br><br>
R3     is C1-C1o-alkyl, C2-C1o-alkenyl, C2-Cio-alkynyl-, C3-C8-cycloalkyl, phenyl-C1-C10-alkyl,<br>
where R3 may be unsubstituted or partially or fully halogenated and/or may carry one to three radicals from the group Ra, or<br>

X      is halogen, cyano, C1-C4-alkoxy, C1-C4-haloalkyl, phenyl or Ra-substituted phenyl;<br>
and their salts.<br>
Additionally, the invention relates to processes and<br>
intermediates for preparing the compounds lr and also to<br>
compositions and to the use of thecompQunds I for controlling<br>
harmful fungi.,	^<br>
6-Aryltriazolopyrimidines are disclosed in WO 98/46608 and EP-A 550 113. 6-Benzyltriazolopyrimidines which are specifically substituted by aromatic groups and have pharmaceutical action are known from US 5,231,094 and US 5,387,747. EP-A 141 317 discloses 7-aminotriazolopyrimidines which may carry an alkyl radical in the 5-position. 6-cycloalkyltriazolopyrimidines having various radicals in the 5-position are mentioned in EP-A 613 900.<br>
The compounds described in WO 98/46608, EP-A 550 113, EP-A 141 317 and EP-A 613 900 are suitable for use as crop protection agents against harmful fungi.<br>
However, in many cases their action is unsatisfactory.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide compounds<br>
having improved activity.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved by the 7-aminotriazolopyrimidines of the formula I. Furthermore, we have found intermediates and processes for preparing the compounds I, and the use of the compounds I and of compositions comprising them for controlling harmful fungi.<br>
The compounds of the formula I differ from the compounds known from the abovementioned publications by the combination of the substituents X with the radical R3 on the triazolopyrimidine skeleton.<br><br>
Compounds of the formula I in which X is halogen are obtained, for example, from dicarbonyl compounds of the formula II.1, which are cyclized with 3-amino-l,2,4-triazole of the formula III to give hydroxytriazolopyrimidines of the formula IV.1:<br><br>
This reaction is usually carried out at temperaturs of from 25°C to 210°C, preferably from 120°C to 180°C, in the presence of a base [cf. EP-A-770615].<br>
Suitable bases are, in general, organic bases, for example tertiary amines, such as trimethylamine, triethylamine, triisopropylethylamine, tributylamine and N-methylpiperidine and pyridine. Particular preference is given to triethylamine and tributylamine.<br>
The bases are generally employed in catalytic amounts; however, they can also be employed in equimolar amounts, in excess or, if appropriate, as solvent.<br>
The starting materials are generally reacted with one another in equimolar amounts. In terms of yield, it may be advantageous to employ an excess of II.1 based on III.<br>
The starting materials required for preparing the compounds I are known from the literature or can be prepared in accordance with the literature cited [Heterocycl. 1996, 1031 — 1047; Tetrahedron Lett. 24. (1966), 2661 - 2668], or they are commercially available.<br>
The hydroxytriazolopyrimidines of the formula IV.1 are then reacted with a halogenating agent to give halotriazolopyrimidines of the formula V.l:<br><br><br>
This reaction is usually carried out at temperatures of from 0°C to 150°C, preferably from 80°C to 125°C, in an inert organic solvent or without additional solvent [cf.EP-A-770 615],<br>
Suitable halogenating agents are, preferably, brominating or chlorinating agents, such as, for example, phosphorus oxybromide or phosphorus oxychloride, undiluted or in the presence of a solvent.<br>
Suitable solvents are aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as pentane, hexane, cyclohexane and petroleum ether, aromatic hydrocarbons, such as toluene, o-, m- and p-xylene, particularly preferably toluene, o-, m- and p-xylene.<br>
It is also possible to use mixtures of the solvents mentioned.<br>
The halotriazolopyrimidines of the formula V.l are then reacted with an amine of the formula VI to give<br>
7-aminotriazolopyrimidines of the formula I in which X is halogen:<br><br>
This reaction is usually carried out at temperatures of from 0°C to 70°C, preferably from 10°C to 35°C, in an inert organic solvent in the presence of a base [cf.EP-A-550 113].<br>
Suitable solvents are aromatic hydrocarbons, such as toluene, o-, m- and p-xylene, halogenated hydrocarbons, such as methylene chloride, chloroform and chlorobenzene, and ethers, such as diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, tert-butyl methyl ether, dioxane, anisole and tetrahydrofuran.<br><br>
Suitable bases are, in general, inorganic compounds, such as alkali metal and alkaline earth metal hydroxides, such as lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide, alkali metal and alkaline earth metal oxides, such as lithium oxide, sodium oxide, calcium oxide and magnesium oxide, alkali metal and alkaline earth metal hydrides, such as lithium hydride, sodium hydride, potassium hydride and calcium hydride, alkali metal amides, such as lithium amide, sodium amide and potassium amide, alkali metal and alkaline earth metal carbonates, such as lithium carbonate, potassium carbonate and calcium carbonate, and also alkali metal bicarbonates, such as sodium bicarbonate, organometallic compounds, in particular alkali metal alkyls, such as methyllithium, butyllithium and phenyllithium, alkylmagnesium halides, such as methylmagnesium chloride, and also alkali metal and alkaline earth metal alkoxides, such as sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide, potassium ethoxide, potassium tert-butoxide and dimethoxymagnesium, moreover organic bases, for example tertiary amines, such as trimethylamine, triethylamine, triisopropylethylamine and N-methylpiperidine, pyridine, substituted pyridines, such as collidine, lutidine and 4-dimethylaminopyridine, and also bicyclic amines. Particular preference is given to triethylamine, potassium carbonate and sodium carbonate.<br>
In general, the bases are employed in catalytic amounts; however, they can also be used in equimolar amounts, in excess or, if appropriate, as solvent. Alternatively, an excess of the compound VI may serve as base.<br>
The starting materials are generally reacted with one another in equimolar amounts. In terms of yield, it may be advantageous to employ an excess of VI based on V.I.<br>
To obtain 7-aminotriazolopyrimidines of the formula I in which X is cyano or Ci-C4-alkoxy, 7-aminotriazolopyrimidines of the formula I are reacted with a compound of the formula VII:<br><br><br>
Here, M is an ammonium, tetraalkylammonium, alkali metal or alkaline earth metal cation and X' is cyano or afkoxy. This reaction is usually carried out at temperatures of from 0°C to 150°C, preferably from 20°C to 75°C, in an inert organic solvent [cf. WO 99/41255].<br>
Suitable solvents are ethers, such as diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, tert-butyl methyl ether, dioxane, anisole and tetrahydrofuran, alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, n-butanol and tert-butanol, and also dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethylformamide and dimethylacetamidef  particularly preferably diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, methanol and dimethylformamide.<br>
It is also possible to use mixtures of the solvents mentioned.<br>
The starting materials are generally reacted with one another in equimolar amounts. In terms of yield, it may be advantageous to employ an excess of VII, based on I.<br>
7-Aminotriazolopyrimidines of the formula I in which X is Ci-C4-haloalkyl or unsubstituted or Ra-substituted phenyl can be obtained from dicarbonyl compounds of the formula II.2, which are cyclized with 3-amino-l,2,4-triazole of the formula III to give 7-hydroxytriazolopyrimidines of the formula IV.2:<br><br>
This reaction is carried out under the same conditions as the conversion of II.1 into IV.1 described above.<br>
The 7-hydroxytriazolopyrimidines of the formula IV.2 are then reacted with a halogenating agent to give 7-halotriazolopyrimidines of the formula V.2:<br><br><br>
This reaction is carried out under the same conditions as the conversion of IV.1 into V.l described above.<br>
Compound V.2 is then reacted with an amine of the formula VI to give compounds of the formula I:<br><br>
This reaction is carried out under the same conditions as the conversion of V.l into I described above.<br>
The reaction mixtures are worked up in a customary manner, for example by mixing with water, separation of the phases and, if appropriate, chromatographic purification of the crude products. Some of the intermediates and end products are obtained in the form of colorless or slightly brownish viscous oils which can be purified or freed from volatile components under reduced pressure and at moderately elevated temperature. If the intermediates and end products are obtained as solids, purification can also be carried out by recrystallization or digestion.<br>
If individual compounds I are not obtainable by the routes described above, they can be prepared by derivatization of other compounds I.<br>
7-Hydroxy- and 7-halotriazolopyrimidines of the formulae IV and V, <br><br>
where Y is a hydroxyl group or a radical from the group X as set forth in claim 1, Hal is halogen and R3 and X are as defined in claim 1 are novel.<br>
Particular preference is given to intermediates of the formulae IV and V, in which R3 is Ci-Cio-alkyl, in particular CH3, CH2-CH3, (CH2)3-CH3, CH2-CH(CH3)2, CH(CH3) -CH2-CH2-CH3, C(CH3)3, (CH2)7-CH3, CH(CH3)2, C2-Cio-alkenyl, in particular CH2-CH=CH2, C3-C8-cycloalkyl, in particular cyclopropylmethyl, cyclopentyl or cyclohexyl, phenyl-Ci-Cio-alkyl, in particular CH2-C6H5, CH2-o-Cl-C6H4, Ci-Cio-haloalkyl, in particular CH2-CF3/ CH(CH3)-CF3 or CH(CF3)2, and X is halogen, in particular chlorine, cyano, Ci-C4-alkoxy,in particular OCH3, Ci-C4-haloalkyl, in particular CF3/ phenyl or Ra-substituted phenyl, in particular phenyl.<br>

Examples of the action against harmful fungi<br>
The fungicidal action of the compounds of the formula I was demonstrated by the following tests:<br>
The active compounds were prepared separately or jointly as a 10% strength emulsion in a mixture of 70% by weight of cyclohexanone, 20% by weight of NekanilR [sic] LN (Lutensol® AP6, wetting agent having emulsifying and dispersing action based on ethoxylated alkylphenols) and 10% by weight of WettolR [sic] EM (nonionic emulsifier based on ethoxylated castor oil) and diluted with water to the desired concentration.<br>
Use Example 1 - Activity against Botrytis cinerea on bell pepper leaves<br>
Bell pepper seedlings of the cultivar "Neusiedler Ideal Elite" were, after 4-5 leaves were well-developed, sprayed to runoff point with an aqueous preparation of active compound which had been prepared from a stock solution of 10% of active compound, 85% of cyclohexanone and 5% of emulsifier. The next day, the treated plants were inoculated with a spore suspension of Botrytis cinerea  which contained 1.7 x 106 spores/ml in a 2% strength aqueous biomalt solution. The test plants were then placed in a climatized chamber at 22-24°C and high atmospheric humidity. After 5 days, the extent of the fungal attack on the leaves could be determined visually in %.<br>
In this test, the [lacuna] with 250 ppm of active compounds 1-10, 1-61, 1-65, 1-66, 1-68, 1-69, 1-76, 1-78, 1-84, 1-100, 1-101, 1-146 and 1-153 to 1-155 showed no or at most 15% infection, whereas the untreated plants were 90% infected.<br>
Jse Example 2 - Activity against downy mildew on grapevines (Plasmopara viticola)<br>
Leaves of potted vines of the cultivar "Miiller-Thurgau" were sprayed to runoff point with an aqueous preparation of active compound which had been prepared from a stock solution of 10% of ■LCtive compound, 85% of cyclohexanone and 5% of emulsifier. The iext day, the leaves were inoculated with an aqueous zoospore suspension of Plasmopara viticola.  The grapevines were initially placed in a water-vapor-saturated chamber at 24°C for 48 hours and :hen in a greenhouse at 20-30°C for 5 days. After this period of :ime, the plants were once more placed into a moist chamber for L6 hours to promote sporangiophore eruption. The extent of the<br><br>
development of the infection on the undersides of the leaves was then determined visually.<br>
In this test, the [lacuna] with 250 ppm of active compounds 1-8 to 1-10, 1-19, 1-25, 1-27, 1-49, 1-60 to 1-62, 1-69, 1-84, 1-101, 1-113, 1-133, 1-146 and 1-153 to 1-155 showed no or at most 15% infection, whereas the untreated plants were 85% infected.<br><br>
