				<td>SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR INTEGRATED GASIFICATION CONTROL<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
I.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to gasification, and more particularly to a system and method for integrated gasification control.<br>
II.	Related Art<br>
Gasification is among the cleanest and most efficient technologies for the production of power, chemicals and industrial gases from hydrocarbon feedstocks, such as coal, heavy oil, and petroleum coke. Simply stated, gasification converts hydrocarbon feedstocks into clean synthesis gas, or syngas, composed primarily of hydrogen (H2) and carbon monoxide (CO). In a gasification plant, the feedstock is mixed with oxygen (O2) and they are injected into a gasifier. Inside the gasifier, the feedstock and the O2 are subjected to a high-temperature and a high-pressure. As a result, the feedstock and the O2 break down into syngas.<br>
In addition to H2 and CO, the syngas contains other gases in small quantities, such as ammonia, methane and hydrogen sulfide (H2S). As much as 99% or more of the H2S present in the syngas can be recovered and converted to elemental sulfur form and used in the fertilizer or chemical industry. Ash and any metals are removed in a slag-like state, and the<br><br>
syngas is cleansed of particulates. The dean syngas is then used for generating electricity and producing industrial chemicals and gases.<br>
Gasification allows refineries to self-generate power and produce additional products. Thus, gasification offers greater efficiencies, energy savings, and a cleaner environment. For example, a gasification plant at a refinery in El Dorado, Kansas converts petroleum coke and" refinery wastes into electricity and steam, making the refinery entirely self-sufficient for its energy needs and significantly reducing waste and coke handling costs. For these reasons, gasification has increasingly become popular among refiners worldwide. Currently, there are several hundred gasification plants in operation worldwide.<br>
The operation of the gasification plant requires various control systems to control the gasifier and other equipments connected thereto. Currently, gasification plants utilize independent controllers, for example, proportional integral derivative (PID) controllers, to independently control various processes in the gasification plant. The independent controllers operate separately and do not interact with each other. As a consequence, the desired setpoint at each controller must be entered separately. Unfortunately, independent controllers often   provide poor response, which results in increased wear and tear of the gasifier and other associated equipments. Specifically, poor controller response can damage a gasifier refractory vessel (a layer of bricks in the gasifier designed to keep heat inside the gasifier) and thermocouple temperature sensors that measure the temperatures in the gasifier. Poor controller response also leads to gasifier shut downs and "off-spec" syngas that does not meet required specifications.<br>
For these reasons, a need has been recognized for an integrated control system that<br>
will control various critical components of the gasification plant. An integrated control<br>
- 2 -<br><br>
system should improve the reliability of the gasification plant by reducing gasifier shut downs and maximizing mn-time. Also, an integrated control system should reduce wear and tear of the gasifier and other associated components.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed toward an integrated control system (ICS) for a gasification plant. The ICS controls the operation of a gasifier and other critical components of a gasification plant. The present invention increases the performance of a gasification plant by controlling the operation of a gasifier and other critical components by an integrated controller, rather than by several independent controllers.<br>
The ICS is a sub-system of a larger distributed control system that controls the operation of the gasification plant. Briefly stated, the ICS controls the following:<br>
(i) oxygen to carbon (O/C) ratio in a gasifier,<br>
(ii) syngas demand or the desired output of a gasifier;<br>
(iii) load constraints;<br>
(iv) moderator flow into a gasifier;<br>
(v) air separation unit (ASU);<br>
(vi) oxygen header vent valves; and<br>
(vii) syngas header pressure.<br>
The ICS provides safer operation and increased equipment life of the gasifier and other critical components by controlling the O/C ratio. Optimum hydrocarbon conversion occurs when the O/C ratio is controlled. According to the present invention, the O/C ratio is controlled by controlling the oxygen and carbon flow rates into the gasifier.<br>
-3-<br><br>
The syngas demand is determined from a demand setpoint value and a demand signal. The demand signal is produced by macro conversion of a carbon flow rate.<br>
The load constraints arc determined from a feed pump setpoint value, a feed pump PV/SP, where PV/SP is the actual power to the desired power ratio, an oxygen valve position, and an oxygen vent/recycle value.<br>
The flow of moderators (steam) into the gasifier is controlled by adjusting one or more oxygen line steam valves and carbon line steam valves. If recycled black-water is also used as a moderator, the black-water flow is controlled by adjusting the speed of a black-water pump.<br>
The oxygen discharge from the ASU is controlled by adjusting an oxygen compressor inlet valve. The amount of oxygen vented through oxygen header vent valves is controlled by adjusting the position of the vent valves. The syngas header pressure is controlled by three methods: a high pressure control; a low pressure control; and a "low low" pressure control.<br>
The present invention provides a method for controlling an oxygen to carbon (O/C) ratio in a gasification plant. The method comprises the steps of: determining a syngas demand based on load constraints, the syngas demand being representative of a desired output of a gasifier; determining oxygen and carbon setpoint values based on an oxygen to carbon (O/C) ratio setpoint value and the syngas demand, and adjusting oxygen and carbon valves in the gasification plant based on the oxygen and carbon setpoint values, respectively.<br>
The present invention provides a method for determining an oxygen setpoint value in a gasification plant. The method comprises the steps of: multiplying an oxygen setpoint value by a carbon flow rate to generate an oxygen setpoint high limit; determining an oxygen demand constrained by a carbon flow rate at a low selector from a syngas demand and the oxygen setpoint high limit; multiplying the oxygen setpoint high limit by a predetermined factor to generate an oxygen setpoint low limit, and determining a constrained oxygen setpoint value at a high selector from the oxygen setpoint low limit and the oxygen demand constrained bv the carbon flow rate.<br>

plant. The method comprises the steps of: generating a compensaicd oxygen line steam flow<br>

signal at a first'flow compensator from an oxygen line steam flow rate, a steam temperature and a steam pressure; generating a compensated carbon line steam flow signal at a second flow compensator from a carbon line steam flow rate, the steam pressure and the steam temperature; adding the compensated oxygen line steam flow signal and the compensated carbon line steam flow signal at a first adder to generate a total steam flow signal; determining a total moderator flow from the total steam flow signal and a recycled black-water flow; dividing the total moderator flow by the carbon flow at a first divider to determine a moderator/carbon ratio; determining a desired oxygen line steam rate from the moderator/carbon ratio signal and a moderator/carbon setpoint value at a ratio controller; determining an oxygen line steam valve signal from the desired oxygen line steam rate and the oxygen line steam flow signal; adjusting an oxygen line steam valve by the oxygen line steam valve signal; determining a carbon line steam valve signal from the compensated carbon line steam flow signal and a carbon line steam flow setpoint value; and adjusting a carbon line steam valve by the carbon line steam valve signal.<br>
The present invention provides a method for controlling an air separation unit (ASU) that provides oxygen to a gasification plant. The method comprises the steps of: comparing oxygen valve positions of a plurality of gasifiers that are operating simultaneously at a high selector, and outputting a value x: calculating F(x) - 0.002x + 0.08, where F(x) &gt; 0.99, and x is the output of the high selector; and calculating F(y) = 0.002y + 0.81, where F(y) &gt; 1.0, and y is the oxygen valve position of a selected gasifier.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates a gasification system 100 in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The gasification system 100 comprises an oxygen unit 104, a feedstock unit 108, a gasifier 112 and a sulfur remover 116.<br>
The oxygen unit 104'can be an air separation unit (ASU) that receives air from the atmosphere and produces oxygen. ASUs are sold by various manufacturers, such as Praxair and Air Products. The oxygen unit 104 is typically connected to the gasifier 112 via one or more oxygen lines 120.<br>
Alternatively, the gasification system 100 may have a plurality of gasifiers 112. In such an arrangement, the plurality of gasifiers may be connected to an ASU via an oxygen header (a main line). The oxygen is distributed among the various gasifiers via the oxygen header.<br>
The oxygen lines 120 terminate in one or more oxygen injectors in the gasifier 112. The oxygen injectors inject the oxygen into the gasifier 112. The oxygen lines 120 also<br>
- 12-<br><br>
include one or more oxygen valves 124. The oxygen valves 124 are adjusted to control the flow of oxygen to the gasifier 112.<br>
The feedstock unit 108 is connected to the gasifier 112 via one or more feed lines 128. The feedstock is supplied to the gasifier 112 via the feed lines 128. The feed lines 128 terminate in one or more feed injectors in the gasifier 112 that inject the feedstock into the gasifier 112. The feed lines 120 also include one or more feed valves 132. If gaseous feedstocks are used, the feed valves 132 are adjusted to control the flow of gaseous feedstock into the gasifier 112. In contrast, when solid or liquid feedstocks are used, their flow is controlled by the speed of a variable speed charge pump.<br>
The gasification system 100 can be designed to process solids (for example, coal, petroleum coke, plastic, rubber), liquids (for example, heavy oil, orimulsion, refinery byproducts) or gases (for example, natural gas, refinery exhaust gas). Gaseous feed stocks are directly fed into the gasifier 112, where they are mixed with the oxygen. Liquid feed stocks are generally pumped into the gasifier 112.<br>
In contrast, solid feedstocks are generally ground into fine particles and mixed with water or waste oil to form a slurry prior to being fed into the gasifier 112. The slurry is then pumped into the gasifier 112 by a slurry pump and is fed into the gasifier 112 by the feed injectors. The slurry flow into the gasifier 112 can also be controlled by adjusting the speed of the slurry pump.<br>
Moderators, such as, steam and recycled black-water, are added to the feed stock and the oxygen prior to gasification. The addition of moderators increases the efficiency of the gasifier 112. Steam is typically supplied via steam lines. Black-water is the water collected from the bottom of the gasifier, and is pumped back into the gasifier as a moderator.<br>
Referring again to FIG. 1, the feedstock and the oxygen are then fed into the gasifier 112 through the feed injectors. The gasifier 112 is a refractory' lined vessel that is designed to withstand high temperature and high pressure. The gasifier 112 has no moving pans or any<br>
- 13-<br><br>
atmospheric release points. In the gasifier 112, the feedstock and the oxygen mixture, or the "feed mix", are exposed to a temperature of approximately 2500 degrees F and a pressure of up to approximately 1200 psi. Upon exposure to these extreme conditions, the feed mix breaks down into a gaseous mixture having two main components, H2 and CO. This gaseous mixture of mainly H2 and CO is known as the synthesis gas or "syngas."<br>
The syngas may be passed through a syngas scrubber where the syngas is rinsed. The syngas contains heat that can be used to generate steam.<br>
The gaseous mixture also includes small quantities of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), ammonia, methane, and other by-products of the feed mix. The gaseous mixture is then passed through a sulphur remover 116 where H2S is removed from the gas.<br>
*   The syngas is transported from the sulfur remover 116 by a syngas header 136. The syngas can be burned as a fuel to generate power. Alternatively, the syngas is used to produce fertilizers, plastics and other chemicals.<br>
As stated before, the present invention is directed to an integrated control system for the gasification plant 100. The integrated control system controls the gasifier 112 and other associated components, such as the ASU, the oxygen header, the syngas header and the moderator.<br>
In one embodiment, the critical control system is a part of a distributed control system that controls the operation of the gasification system 100. FIG. 2 is a block diagram of a distributed control system 200 that controls the operation of the gasification system 100.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 2, a distributed control network 204 forms the backbone of the distributed control system 200. One or more cathode ray tube (CRT) stations 208 are connected to the network 204. The CRT stations 208 display the current state of the gasification system 100. Operators monitor the operation of the gasifier 112 and other components via the CRT stations 208.<br>
- 14 -<br><br>
An application station 212 is connected to the network 204. Operators generally run supervisory applications, e.g., monitoring alarms, monitoring pumps, via the application station 212.<br>
An integrated control system (ICS) 216 is connected to the network 204. In one embodiment, the ICS 216 comprises a computer microprocessor and one or more random access memories (RAMs). The ICS 216 controls the operation of the gasifier 112 and other critical components of the gasification system 100. The RAM stores one or more programs specifically developed for the ICS 216. The computer microprocessor executes the programs stored in the RAMs. One or more input/output (I/O) cards are connected to the ICS 216. The I/O cards provide an interface between the microprocessor and various sensors, valves and pump motor speed controllers.<br>
One or more non-critical control systems 220 are also connected to the network 204. The non-critical control systems 220 control the non-critical components of the gasification system 100. A communication gateway 224 is connected to the network 204. The gateway 224 enables the network 204 to communicate with third party systems, for example, a safety instrumentation system or an emergency shutdown system.<br>
FIG. 3 is a high-level block diagram of the ICS 216 in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Broadly, the ICS 216 comprises an oxygen to carbon (O/C) ratio control system 304, an ASU control system 308, a moderator control system 312, and a syngas header control system 316. Each of these systems is described in detail below.<br>
1.         O/C Ratio Control<br>
Briefly stated, optimum hydrocarbon conversion occurs when the O/C ratio is controlled during gasification. Preferably, the O/C ratio must be continuously monitored and automatically controlled. Without continuous O/C control, the O/C ratio can become too high<br>
- 15"-<br><br>
or too low. If the O/C ratio becomes too high, the temperature inside the gasifier 112 varies widely, which reduces the gasifier's refractory life and thermocouple life. On the other hand, if the O/C ratio becomes too low, hydrocarbon conversion drops, thereby reducing the efficiency of the gasifier 112. A low O/C ratio also increases the amount of solids produced in the gasifier 112, which causes a gasifier shutdown if the solids arc not removed quickly.<br>
The present invention provides a novel O/C ratio control that improves the performance of the gasifier 112. Also, the present invention provides safer operation and increased component life of the gasification system 100 by minimizing temperature variations in the gasifier 112. If an ASU is integrated with a gasification system 100, the O/C control system must be coupled to OT compressor controls in the ASU for steady operation of the gasifier 112 and the O2 compressor.<br>
Briefly stated, according to the present invention, the O/C ratio is determined by calculating the oxygen and carbon flow signal. FIG. 4 is a flow diagram of a method for controlling the O/C ratio in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. In a step 404 a syngas demand is determined based on load constraints. The syngas demand is the desired output of the gasifier 112. The actual calculation of the syngas demand is explained in detail in FIG. 5. The load constraints are limiting factors in the feed mix that limit the performance of the gasifier 112. The load constraint calculation is also explained in greater detail in FIG. 6. o<br>
In a step 408, an oxygen setpoint value is determined based on an O/C setpoint value and the syngas demand. The O/C setpoint value calculation is described in further detail later. In a step 412, a carbon setpoint value is determined based on the O/C setpoint value and the syngas demand. In a step 416, the oxygen flow is controlled by adjusting the oxygen valves. The oxygen valves are adjusted based on the oxygen setpoint value. In a step 420, the carbon flow is adjusted based on the carbon setpoint value.<br>
16-<br><br>
(a)       Syngas Demand Control<br>
FIG. 5 illustrates the step 404 (calculating the syngas demand) in further detail. In a step 504, a carbon flow rate is convened to a demand controller signal by a macro unit conversion. Alternatively, with an integrated ASU, an oxygen flow rate is converted to a demand controller signal by a macro unit conversion to minimize ASU fluctuations. The demand controller signal is represented by a pure carbon mass flow in tons/day. The pure carbon mass flow is calculated from the following equation:<br>
m = (F)* (12.011)*(24/2000). where,<br>
m = pure carbon mass flow in tons/day, and F = elemental slurry flow in Ib-mol/hour.<br>
In one embodiment, the carbon flow rate (the elemental slurry flow) is measured by a magnetic meter or by a variable speed charge pump. In a step 508, the demand controller signal and a demand controller setpoint value are received at a proportional integral derivative (PID) controller. The demand controller setpoint value is a desired value and is generally entered by an operator.<br>
The operation of a PID controller is well understood by persons skilled in the relevant art. The PID controller calculates an error signal that represents the difference between a signal and a setpoint value (or a reference signal), and multiplies the error signal by a gain. The output of the PID controller is a value between 0.0 and 1.0 (0% to 100%). Particularly, the PID controller calculates the error signal that represents the difference between the demand controller signal and the demand controller setpoint value, and multiplies the error signal by again.<br>
- 17-<br><br>
In a step 512, a signal selector receives the output of the PID controller and an automatic demand value. The determination of the automatic demand value is explained in detail later. Depending on the operating mode of the gasifier 112, the signal selector selects either the output of the PID controller or the automatic demand value as the selected demand value. During a manual mode, the signal selector selects the PID controller output. During an automatic mode, the signal selector selects the automatic demand value-During an override mode, the signal selector selects the higher of the two inputs.<br>
In a step 516, a low selector receives the selected demand value, that is, the output of the signal selector, and a syngas demand override value. The determination of the syngas demand override value is described later. The low selector selects the lower of the selected demand value and the syngas demand override value as a load constrained demand value. In a step 520, the load constrained demand value is converted to a bias signal. The bias signal has a value between -2% and +2% of a full scale, where the full scale corresponds between 0 and a maximum allowable elemental flow, where an elemental flow refers to flow in moles (1 mole = 6.02 x 1023 molecules), rather than volumetric flow.<br>
Finally, in a step 524, the oxygen flow rate is biased by the bias signal. The biased oxygen flow rate is the syngas demand signal.<br>
(i)        Load Constraints<br>
FIG. 6 is a flow diagram of the method for determining the load constraints or the "syngas demand override value" in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. In a step 604, a high selector selects the highest value among the following values: (1) a feed pump setpoint value; (2) a feed pump power PV/SP, where PV/SP is the actual measured power to the maximum allowable power ratio; (3) an oxygen compressor power PV/SP; (4) a gasifier oxygen valve position value (this value is used only if an integrated ASU is not used); (5) a compressor suction vent valve position value or an oxygen pump<br>
- 18-<br><br>
recycle valve position value (this value is used only if an integrated ASU is used); and (6) an oxygen compressor suction valve position value (this value is only used if an integrated ASU is used). The high selector outputs the highest value as a constrained controller signal.<br>
In a step 608, a constrained controller setpoint value is multiplied by 98% (or 0.98) at a multiplier. Although, 0.98 is the preferred factor, other factors (e.g., 0.95,0.90) may also be used.<br>
The constrained controller setpoint value is the desired value and is entered by the operator. In a step 612, a PXD controller receives the constrained controller signal from the high selector and the output from the multiplier (98% of the constrained controller setpoint value). The output of the PID controller is the syngas demand override value.<br>
2.	O/C Setpoint Control<br>
FIG. 7 is a flow diagram of the method for determining the O/C setpoint value according to one embodiment of the present invention. In a step 704, the oxygen flow rate is divided by the carbon flow rate at a divider to obtain the O/C ratio value.<br>
However, if solid or gas feedstocks are used, then the following steps.must be performed in addition to the step 704 described above. In a step 708, the measured O/C setpoint value from the step 704 is used to infer the gasifier temperature. In one embodiment, a linear interpolation method is used to infer the gasifier temperature. The inferred gasifier temperature is the virtual temperature signal.<br>
In a step 712, the'operator uses the virtual temperature signal to select a virtual temperature setpoint value. In a step 716, the O/C ratio setpoint is interpolated from the virtual temperature setpoint value.<br>
3.	Oxygen Setpoint Control<br>
- 19-<br><br>
FIG. 8 is a flow diagram of a method for calculating the oxygen setpoint value in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. In a step 804, the O/C setpoint value is multiplied by the carbon flow rate at a first multiplier. The output of the first multiplier is a carbon flow rate in an oxygen basis (or an oxygen setpoint high limit). In a step 808, the syngas demand signal (biased oxygen flow rate from step 524 in FIG. 5) and the first multiplier output is received at a low selector. The low selector outputs an oxygen demand constrained by the carbon flow rate.<br>
In a step 812, the output of the first multiplier, i.e., the oxygen setpoint high limit, is received at a second multiplier, where it is further multiplied by a factor 0.98. The output of the second multiplier is an oxygen setpoint low limit. Although, the oxygen setpoint low limt is set at 98% of the oxygen setpoint high limit, it should be understood that other factors (e.g., 95%, 90%) may also be used to set the oxygen setpoint high limit.<br>
In a step 816, the oxygen setpoint low limit and the output of the low selector, that is, the oxygen demand constrained by the carbon flow rate, are received at a high selector. The high selector outputs a constrained oxygen setpoint value. Thus, the oxygen flow rate is constrained between 98% and 100% of the carbon flow rate. In other words, the carbon flow rate leads the oxygen flow rate but by no more than 2%. It will be apparent to one skilled in the art that the oxygen flow rate can be constrained between other percentage values of the carbon flow rate. In other words, the carbon flow rate can be allowed to lead the oxygen flow rate by other percentage values.<br>
If an ASU is integrated with the gasification system 100, then the following additionals steps also need to be performed. In a step 820, the equation F(x) = 0.002x + 0.81 is solved, where F(x) &gt; 1.0 and x represents the oxygen valve position. F(x) is an oxygen setpoint modifier that is used to drive the oxygen valves fully open, that is, out of control, when the oxygen is controlled at the ASU.<br>
-20-<br><br>
The oxygen valve position calculation is described later. In a step 824, F(x) is multiplied by .the output of the high selector, i.e., the constrained oxygen setpoint value, to obtain the oxygen control setpoint value.<br>
4.         Carbon Setpoint Control<br>
According to the present invention, the carbon setpoint value is calculated from a constrained carbon setpoint and the O/C ratio setpoint. FIG. 9 is a flow diagram of a method for determining the carbon control setpoint value. In a step 904, the oxygen flow rate and the syngas demand is received at a high selector. The high selector outputs a carbon set point low limit in an oxygen basis. In a step 908, the oxygen flow rate is multiplied by 1.02 at a multiplier. The output of the multiplier is a carbon setpoint high limit. It should be understood that the oxygen flow rate can be multiplied by other numbers, e.g., 1.05, 1.1, to set the carbon setpoint high limit.<br>
In a step 912, the carbon setpoint high limit and the carbon setpoint low limit are received at a low selector. The low selector outputs the constrained carbon setpoint. Finally, in a step 916, the constrained carbon setpoint is divided by the O/C ratio setpoint and the carbon control setpoint value is^obtained.<br>
5.         Oxygen Flow Control<br>
The oxygen flow rate is controlled by adjusting the valve position in the oxygen lines. FIG. 10 is a flow diagram for the oxygen flow control. In a step 1004, the oxygen temperature, the oxygen pressure and the oxygen flow rate are received at a flow compensator. The oxygen temperature is measured from thermocouples in the oxygen lines. The oxygen pressure is measured by pressure transmitters in the oxygen lines. The oxygen flow rate is measured by oxygen flow transmitters in the oxygen<br>
-21 -<br><br>
lines. The flow compensator corrects the oxygen flow based on pressure and temperature variations.<br>
The compensated oxygen flow is calculated by the following equation:<br><br>
where,<br>
q	-	compensated oxygen flow,<br>
q	=	oxygen flow,<br>
p	=	oxygen pressure in psig,<br>
Po	=	absolute pressure conversion factor, preferably 14.696 psig,<br>
PR	=	absolute oxygen design pressure in psia,<br>
T	=	oxygen temperature in °F,<br>
To	=	absolute temperature conversion factor, preferably 459.69°F, and<br>
TR	=	absolute oxygen design temperature, in °R.<br>
The flow compensator outputs a compensated oxygen flow. In a step 1008, the compensated oxygen flow is converted to a molar oxygen'flow.<br>
The oxygen flow is convened to a molar oxygen flow by the following equation:<br>
F = q *(2/379.5)<br>
where,<br>
q = volumetric oxygen flow in standard cubuc feet/hour (scsh), and<br>
F = elemental oxygen flow in Ib-mol/hour.<br>
- 22 -<br><br>
In a step 1012, the molar oxygen flow is multiplied by the oxygen purity value at a multiplier. The oxygen purity value (for example, 96%) is obtained from an oxygen purity analyzer. The multiplier outputs an oxygen flow signal.<br>
In a step 1016, the oxygen flow signal and an oxygen control setpoint value is received at a PED controller. In a step 1020, the output of the PID controller is received by two velocity limiters, an increase velocity limiter and a decrease velocity limiter. The output of the PID controller is rate limited by one of the two velocity limiters, depending on the rate of change of the output. If the output of the PED controller is increasing (i.e., positive rate of change), then it is rate limited by the increase velocity Hmiter. On the other hand, if the output of the PID controller is decreasing (i.e., negative rate of change), then it is rate limited by the decrease velocity limiter.<br>
In a step 1024, the output of the two velocity limiters are received at a signal selector, and the signal selector selects one of the signals based on whether the rate of change of the signal is positive or negative. If the output of the PID controller is increasing, the signal selector selects the increase velocity limiter. If the output of the PID controller is decreasing, the signal selector selects the decrease velocity limiter. The output of the signal selector is used to adjust the oxygen valve position.<br>
6.         Carbon Flow. Control<br>
According to the present invention, the carbon flow rate into the gasifier 112 is controlled by the carbon pump speed. Briefly stated, the carbon pump speed is controlled by a measured carbon flow rate and a desired carbon control setpoint. A PID controller is used to adjust the carbon pump speed.<br>
FIG. 11 is a flow diagram of a method for carbon flow controls. In a step 1104, the carbon flow rate is determined from the charge pump speed. The carbon flow rate is calculated from the following equation:<br>
-23-<br><br>
q = qr. (s/sr)<br>
where,<br>
q = charge pump flow in gpm,<br>
qr = charge pump design flow,<br>
s = charge pump speed in rpm, and<br>
sr = charge pump design speed in rpm.<br>
In a step 1108, a signal selector receives the inferred carbon flow rate and the measured carbon flow rate. In one embodiment, the measured carbon flow rate is obtained from a magnetic flow meter. The signal selector selects one of the signals depending on the operating condition. The signal selector outputs the actual carbon flow rate.<br>
In a step 1112, the carbon flow rate is converted to a molar carbon flow rate at a molar converter. For solid feedstocks, the carbon flow rate is converted to a molar carbon flow rate by the following equation:<br><br>
where,<br>
F = elemental carbon flow in lb-mol/hour,<br>
q - slurry flow (represents the slurry pump speed),<br>
Xcoke = coke carbon concentraion, between 85% and 92%, and<br>
Xslurry = slurry coke concentration, between 55% and 65%.<br>
-24-<br><br>
When liquid feedstocks are used, the carbon flow rate is converted to a molar carbon flow rate by the following equation:<br><br>
Where,<br>
Q - carbon flow in gal/min,<br>
F = elemental carbon flow in Ib-mol/hr,<br>
Sg - specific gravity of carbon, and<br>
Xc - carbon content of the liquid.<br>
The molar conversion takes into account the velocity limited carbon content and the velocity limited slurry concentration. The velocity limited carbon content and the velocity limited slurry concentration is explained below.<br>
First, the carbon content is determined from the shipment of the feedstock, e.g.. coke. . The carbon content is then velocity limited or "rate limited" by a velocity limiter. For example, if the carbon content of the current shipment of the feedstock differs significantly, e.g., by 20%, from the carbon content of the previous shipment that was used in the gasifier, then the velocity limiter limits the rate of change to, for example, .05% per minute. In other words, the velocity limiter informs the carbon flow controls that the carbon content is changing only at a rate of, for example, .05% per minute" rather than a drastic sudden change of 20%. The slurry concentration is determined by lab analysis and is likewise rate limited.<br>
In a step 1116, the molar carbon flow rate is multiplied by the velocity limited slurry concentration at a first multiplier. In a step 1120, the first multiplier output is again multiplied by the velocity limited carbon content at a second multiplier. The output of the second multiplier is a carbon flow signal. In a step 1124, a PED controller receives the carbon flow<br>
-25-<br><br>
signal and the carbon control setpoint value and outputs the carbon pump speed. The output of the PID controller is generally rate limited by a velocity limiter to protect the carbon pump<br>
7.         Feed Injector Oxygen Control<br>
As noted before, the oxygen is supplied by the ASU to the gasifier. In one embodiment of the present invention, an oxygen line is split into two lines prior to being fed into the gasifier 112. The two oxygen lines and a carbon line (from the feedstock unit) merge to form three concentric pipes in a feed injector. The center pipe supplies oxygen. The intermediate pipe surrounding the center pipe supplies feedstock. The outer pipe surrounding the intermediate pipe supplies oxygen. The oxygen is controlled by two valves. A center oxygen valve located prior to the split, that is, up-stream, and an annular oxygen valve located in the concentric section, that is, down-stream, of the pipe.<br>
FIG. 12 is flow diagram for feed injector controls. In a step 1204, an annular oxygen split value is determined. The annular oxygen split value is given by F(x) - 1-x, where x is the oxygen split setpoint value. The oxygen split setpoint value is the percentage (e.g., 30%) of the total oxygen that is flowing in the center line. Ifx= 30%, then F(x)= 1-0.3 = 0.7.<br>
In a step 1208, the oxygen split setpoint value is multiplied by the compensated oxygen flow signal at. a first multiplier. The first multiplier outputs the oxygen setpoint value. In a step 1212, the annular oxygen split signal is multiplied by the compensated oxygen flow signal at a second multiplier and an annular oxygen setpoint value is obtained. In a step 1216, the oxygen split signal is subtracted from the oxygen flow signal to obtain the annular oxygen flow signal. The oxygen flow signal is measured by transmitters in the oxygen line. In a step 1220, the annular oxygen flow signal and the annular oxygen setpoint is received at a PID controller. The PID controller outputs an annular oxygen valve position. In a step 1224, the oxygen flow signal and the oxygen setpoint value is received at a PID controller that outputs a<br>
center oxygen valve position.<br>
-26-<br><br>
8.         Moderator Controls<br>
As stated before, in a gasification process, moderators are added to the oxygen and the feedstocks before they are fed into the gasifier 112. In the present invention, steam is added to the oxygen and the feedstock. Optionally, recycled black-water may be added to the feedstock. Black-water is the water collected from the bottom of the gasifier which is then added to the carbon as a moderator. Typically, biack-water collected from the gasifier is pumped back as a moderator by a pump.<br>
The amount of moderators in the oxygen and carbon is controlled by adjusting the oxygen line steam valve and the carbon line steam valve. If recycled black-water is also used as a moderator, the amount of black-water is controlled by adjusting the speed of a recycled black-water pump.<br>
FIGS. I3A and I3B illustrate a flow diagram for controlling the moderator in the gasifier 112. In a step 1304, the oxygen line steam flow rate, the steam temperature and the steam pressure are received at a first flow compensator. The oxygen line steam flow rate is measured by a flow meter in the steam line. The steam temperature is measured by one or more thermocouples in the steam line. The steam pressure is measured by one or more pressure transmitters in the steam line.<br>
The flow compensator outputs an oxygen line steam flow signal that is compensated for the steam pressure and the steam temperature. The compensated steam flow signal is calculated by the following equation:<br><br><br><br>
q	=	steam flow,<br>
P	=	steam pressure in psig,<br>
Po	=	absolute pressure conversion, usually 14.696 psig,<br>
PR	=	absolute steam design pressure in psia,<br>
T	=	steam temperature in °F,<br>
To	=	absolute temperature conversion, usually 459.69°F, and<br>
TR	=	absolute steam design temperature, in °R.<br>
In a step 1308, the carbon line steam flow rate, the steam pressure and the steam temperature are received at second flow compensator, and the flow compensator outputs a compensated carbon line steam flow signal. In a step 1312, the compensated oxygen line steam flow signal and the compensated carbon line steam flow signal are added at a first adder and a total steam flow signal is generated. In a step 1316, the total steam flow is added to the recycled black-water flow rate and the total moderator flow rate is determined. In one embodiment, the black-water flow rate is measured by a magnetic meter in the carbon line.<br>
In a step 1320, the total moderator flow rate is divided by the carbon flow rate at a first divider, and a moderator/carbon ratio is generated. In a step 1324, the moderator/carbon ratio, the carbon flow rate and a moderator/carbon ratio setpoint value is received at a first ratio controller. The ratio controller outputs a desired oxygen line steam rate by comparing the moderator/carbon ratio signal and the moderator/carbon ratio setpoint value. A ratio controller typically follows a desired ratio by varying one component of a ratio while the other component of the ratio remains fixed until the desired ratio is achieved. The following o example illustrates the operation of a ratio controller.<br>
Suppose a desired ratio is 2/3 or .666. Now consider that a ratio controller receives a ratio x/y. The ratio controller will vary y while x remains fixed until x/y = .666. Alternatively, the ratio controller can vary x while y remains fixed.<br>
In a step 1328, the desired oxygen line steam rate may be replaced by a predetermined value at a safety system setpoint override. In a step 1332, the oxygen line steam flow signal and the output from the safety system setpoint override are received at a first PED controller.<br>
-28 -<br><br>
The first PID controller outputs the oxygen line steam valve signal that is used to adjust the oxygen line steam valves.<br>
In a step 1336, the compensated carbon line steam flow signal and a carbon line steam flow setpoint arc received at a second PID controller. The PID controller outputs a carbon line steam valve signal that is used to adjust the carbon line steam valves.<br>
In a step 1340, the carbon flow rate is divided by the recycled black-water flow rate at a second divider. In a step 1344, a second ratio controller generates a black-water controller setpoint value from the output of the divider. In a step 1348, a third PID controller receives the recycled black-water flow rate and the black-water controller setpoint value, i.e., the output of the second ratio controller. The third PID controller outputs a recycled black-water pump speed signal that is used to control the speed of the recycled black-water pump.<br>
P.         ASU/Oxygen Controls<br>
The present invention provides an ASU/Oxygen Controls where an ASU is integrated with the gasification system 100. The oxygen discharge from the ASU is controlled by adjusting an oxygen compressor inlet valve.<br>
FIGS. 14A and 14B illustrate a flow diagram for the ASU/Oxygen Controls in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. In step 1404, the oxygen valve position of the gasifler 112 and other gasifiers that may be operating simultaneously are compared at a high selector. In a step 1408, the following equation is solved: F(x) = 0.002x + 0.08, where F(x) &gt; 0.99, and x is the output of the high selector. F(x) is an oxygen setpoint modifier that is used to restrict oxygen at the ASU to cause the downstream gasifier oxygen valves to open to the point where they release control of the oxygen to the ASU.<br>
In a step 1412, the following equation is solved: F(y) = 0.002y + 0.81, where F(y) &gt; 1.0, andy is the oxygen valve position of the gasifier 112. F(y) is an oxygen setpoint modifier used to counteract the oxygen setpoint modifier F(x) of the step 820.<br>
- 29 -<br><br>
In a step 1416. the actual oxygen setpoint value b divided by Ffy) at a divider. The actual oxygen setpoint value is calculated by the operator and catered into the system. In a step 1420, Che output of the divider and other similar outputs from other gasifiers are. added ai a first adder. In a step 1424. the output of the first adder is multiplied at a multiplier by F(x) obtained in step 1408. The multiplier outputs a discharge controller setpoint value. The discharge controller setpoint value represents the combined total oxygen setpoint value, that is, the discharge of the ASU.<br>
to a step 1428, the oxygen flow rate from ail gasifiers are .added at a second adder and a total oxygen flow rate is calculated. In a step 1432, a P© controller receives the discharge controller setpoint and the total oxygen value setpoint. The PDD controller outputs a discharge controller output signal. In a step 1436, the output of the PDD controller is velocity limited at a velocity Umicer. In a step 1440, the velocity limited discharge controller output signal is received at a low selector along with outputs from other ASU controllers (e.g., compressor suction flow controller, ASU suction vent controller) and compressor protection controllers. The output of the low selector is the oxygen compressor inlet valve signal.<br>
10.       Oxygen Header Vent Valve Controls<br>
In the gasification system 100, a common line, known as the "oxygen header", is used to distribute oxygen among various gasifiers. During an ernergeacy condition, the oxygen in the header is vented through header valves. The amount of oxygen vented through the header vent valves is controlled by adjusting the header vent valves.<br>
FIGS. 15A and 15B illustrate a flow diagram for controlling the oxygen header vent valves. In a step 1504, an oxygen header pressure signal is multiplied by 1-02 at a multiplier. In a step 1508, the output of the multiplier is velocity limited at a velocity Umiter. The output of the velocity Hmiter is the oxygen header control seipoini value.<br>
-30-<br><br>
In a step 1512, a predicted oxygen flow is calculated from the oxygen pressure, the oxygen temperature, the oxygen valve position, the oxygen line steam flow rate and the syngas scrubber pressure. The oxygen pressure is measured by one or more pressure transmitters in the oxygen line. The oxygen temperature is measured by one or more thermocouples in the oxygen line. The oxygen line steam flow rate calculation was described eariier. The syngas scrubber pressure is measured by a pressure transmitter in a syngas scrubber.<br>
The predicted oxygen flow can be calculated by treating the gasifier oxygen valve and the gasifier feed injector as two restrictions in series. The flow through a restriction is a function of the upstream and down stream pressures and the size of the restrictions. The down stream pressure for the feed injector is the syngas gas scrubber pressure. The upstream pressure for the feed injector cannot be directly measured. So it is instead inferred from the steam flow to the oxygen line upstream of the feed injector. The inferred pressure also serves as the downstream pressure for the oxygen valve restriction. As the oxygen valve opens and closes, the value of its restriction changes. Multiple iterative equations must be used to determine the impact of the oxygen valves when it is above or below its designed normal position.<br>
In one embodiment, the predicted oxygen flow is calculated by the equation provided below. However, it should be understood that many other types of equations can be easily used to compute the predicted oxygen flow. One skilled in the art can easily substitute alternative equations to compute the predicted oxygen flow.<br>

In a step 1516, the predicted oxygen flow is added to predicted oxygen flows from other gasifler trains at an adder. In a step 1520, the total predicted oxygen flow is subtracted from the design oxygen header flow value and a predicted oxygen header vent flow is obtained. The design oxygen header flow value is a constant, which represents the amount of oxygen that the oxygen pipes are designed to carry. In a step 1524. an oxygen header vent valve bias value is calculated from the predicted oxygen header vent flow and an oxygen header vent valve critical flow. The oxygen header vent valve bias calculation is described in the Texaco Design Document. The oxygen header vent valve critical flow is the maximum allowable flow through the vent valve.<br>

In a step 1528, a PED controller receives the oxygen header control setpoint value and the oxygen header pressure signal. The PID controller outputs an unbiased oxygen header vent valve signal. Finally, in a step 1532, the output of the PED controller is biased by the oxygen header valve bias value and a biased oxygen header vent valve signal is obtained. The oxygen header vent valve signal is used to adjust the vent valves of the oxygen header,<br>
11.       Syngas Header Pressure Control<br>
-As stated before, the syngas is transported from the gasifier by one or more syngas headers. Generally, the operator enters a normal pressure control setpoint, also called the syngas header pressure setpoint. The syngas header pressure setpoint is then used for high pressure control, low pressure control and "low low" pressure control.<br>
FIG. 16 is "a flow diagram of a method for determining the normal pressure control of the syngas header. In a step 1604, the syngas header pressure signal is measured by one or more pressure transmitters in the syngas header. In a step 1608, a PID controller receives the syngas header pressure setpoint and the syngas header pressure signal. The PID controller outputs a boiler syngas setpoint value. The boiler refers to a boiler downstream of the gasifier, which intakes the syngas and bums the syngas to generate power. The boiler syngas setpoint value represents the amount of syngas the boiler should consume.<br>
The present invention provides for the control of high pressure in the syngas header. FIGS. 17A and 17B illustrate a flow diagram for a high pressure control of the syngas header. In a step 1704, the syngas header flow rate, the syngas header temperature and the syngas header pressure signal are received at a flow compensator. The flow compensator calculates a compensated syngas header flow. In a step 1708. a syngas header flare vent valve bias is calculated from the compensated syngas header flow, the syngas header temperature and the maximum allowable flow through syngas header valve. The syngas header flare vent valve bias is calculated from the following equation:<br>
-35-<br><br><br><br>

Absolute temperature conversion, usually 459.69°F, and<br>
Absolute clean syngas design temperature, in °R.<br><br>
In a step 1712, the syngas header flare vent valve bias and a combustion turbine trip signal is received at a bias ramp. In a step 1716, the output of the bias ramp is added to other combustion turbine trip signals from other turbines at an adder. In a step 1724, the syngas header pressure setpoint is multiplied by 1.02 at a multiplier. The output of the multiplier is the high pressure setpoint. In a step 1720, the syngas header pressure signal and the high pressure setpoint are received at a PID controller. The PID controller outputs when the syngas header pressure increases by more than 2% of the high pressure setpoint. In a step 1728, the output of the PID controller is biased by the output of the adder and the syngas header flare vent valve position is obtained.<br>
FIG. 18 is a flow diagram of the method for a low pressure control of the syngas<br>
header. In a step 1804, a gasifier trip signal and a ramp start signal is received at a bias ramp.<br>
-36-<br><br>
The ramp start signal is entered by the operator. In a step 1808, the syngas header pressure setpoint is multiplied by- 0.98 at a multiplier and a low pressure setpoint. In other words, the low pressure setpoint is set at 98% of the syngas header pressure setpoint.<br>
In a step 1812, a PUD controller receives the syngas header pressure signal and the low pressure setpoint and outputs an unbiased low syngas pressure signal. In a step 1816, the unbiased low syngas pressure signal is biased by the output of the bias ramp to obtain the low syngas presure signal.<br>
FIG. 19 is a flow diagram of a method for a gasification pressure control. In a step 1904, a gasifier trip signal and a ramp start signal is received at a bias ramp. The gasifier trip signal is produced when there is a gasifier shutdown. The ramp Stan signal is a constant value. The bias ramp generates a bias signal that will be used to unload gasifier syngas inventory into the syngas header.<br>
In a step 1908, the high pressure setpoint value is multiplied by 0.98 at a multiplier. In a step 1916, the output of the multiplier is biased by the output of the bias ramp, i.e., the bias signal, and the normal pressure setpoint value is obtained. In a step 1912, a first PID controller receives a scrubber pressure and the high pressure, setpoint. The scrubber pressure is measured by pressure transmitters in the overhead of the syngas scrubber. The first PID controller outputs a flare valve position. In a step 1920, a second PID controller receives the scrubber pressure and the normal pressure setpoint and generates a syngas letdown valve controller signal. The automatic demand value noted earlier is derived from the carbon pump speed and the low syngas pressure signal.<br>
FIG. 20 is a flow diagram of a method for determining the automatic demand. In a step 2004, the speed differential of two carbon pumps (from two gasifier trains) is calculated. The difference represents a predicted train differential. In a step 2008, a PID controller receives the predicted train differential and a zero (0) setpoint value. The output of the PID controller is between 0 and 100%. In a step 2012, the output of the PID controller is<br>
-37-<br><br>
convened to a bias value. In one embodiment, the output of the PID controller is converted to a value between -10 and +10. In a step 2016, the low syngas pressure signal is biased by the bias value and the automatic demand is generated In a step 2020, the bias value is multiplied by -I and is provided to the other gasification train as an automatic demand.<br>

An integrated control system (ICS) for a gasification plant controls the operation of a gasifier and other critical components of the gasification plant. The ICS improves the performance of a gasification plant by controlling the operation of a gasifier and other critical components by an integrated controller, rather than by several independent controllers. The ICS is a sub-system of a larger distributed control system that controls the operation of the gasification plant. The ICS controls the following: (i) oxygen to carbon (O/C) ratio in a gasifier; (ii) syngas demand or the desired output of a gasifier; (iii) load constraints; (iv) moderator flow into a gasifier; (v) air separation unit (ASU); (vi) oxygen header vent valves; and (vii) syngas header pressure.</td>
