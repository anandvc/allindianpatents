BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
FIG. 1 is a diagram showing the arrangement of a wireless selective calling receiver and an external registering device, which constitutes an embodiment of the invention; and<br>
FIG. 2 is a diagram showing an example of a pattern which is newly registered by the wireless selective calling receiver and the external registering device of the invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
A preferred embodiment of the invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
FIG. 1 is a block diagram showing the arrangements of a wireless selective calling receiver and an external registering device which constitutes an embodiment of the invention.  In FIG. 1, reference numeral 10 designates the wireless selective calling receiver of the invention (hereinafter referred to merely as a receiver 10 when applicable), which comprises a display section 1, a control section 2, and a memory section 3.  The display section 1 is to visually display characters or patterns.  The control section 2 is to control the outputting of characters or patterns to the display section 1 and to control the characters or pattern data which have been stored in the memory section 3.  The memory section 3 is to store characters or pattern data to be displayed.<br><br>
In FIG. 1, reference numeral 20 designates the external registering device (hereinafter referred to merely as "a device 20", when applicable), which comprises a display section 4, a control section 5, an input section 6, and an output section 7.  The input section 6 is to make it possible to input characters or patterns.  The display section 4 is to visually display character or patterns after the control section 5 recognizes the characters or patterns thus inputted.  The output section 7 functions as follows:  After the control section 5 (described later) converts the inputted characters or patterns into electrical signal data, the output section 7 makes it possible to store them in the wireless selective calling receiver.  The control section 5 recognizes the inputted characters or patterns and causes them to be displayed on the display section 4, and converts the inputted characters or patterns into electrical data which are sent to the output section 7 adapted to resister the inputted characters or patterns in the wireless selective calling receiver 10.<br>
The operations of the wireless selective calling receiver 10 and the external registering device 20 which have been constructed as described above, will be described.<br>
In the case where it is required to newly register a character or pattern which are to be displayed on the display section 1 of the wireless selective calling receiver 10, first of all a character or pattern to be newly stored is<br><br>
inputted by the input section of the external registering device 20.  The character or pattern thus inputted is recognized by the control section 5, so that the character or pattern is converted into electrical signal data by the latter 5 which is outputted.  In this case, the wireless selective calling -receiver 10 apply the address in the memory section 3 where the character or pattern is newly stored to the external registering device 20, so that the operator is allowed to recognize the address.  One signal data is displayed on the display section of the external registering device 20; that is, the operator who has inputted the character or pattern is allowed to recognize the newly stored character or pattern and its storing address.  The other signal data is transmitted from the control section 5 to the output section 7, and sent through a signal transmitting line 8 to the wireless selective calling receiver 10.<br>
The character or pattern data thus transmitted to the wireless selective calling receiver is sent to the control section 2 and the memory section 3 therein.  The character or pattern data is transmitted through the control section 2, so that one of the signal data is stored in a newly storing address in the memory section 3 in the wireless selective calling receiver 10, the other is displayed on the display section 1.  In this case, the wireless selective calling receiver 10 applies the address to the external registering device 2 0 where the data is to be stored in the memory<br><br>
section.  Alternatively, the embodiment may be so modified that a character or pattern data is directly stored in the memory section 3 in the wireless selective calling receiver 10.  The character or pattern data stored in the memory section 3 in the wireless selective calling receiver 10, similarly as in the case the characters or pattern data which have been stored before, are displayed on the display section 1 in the wireless selective calling receiver 10.<br>
The character or pattern displayed on the display section 1 of the wireless selective calling receiver 10, is changed as follows:  First, the character or pattern data stored in the memory section 3 in the wireless selective calling receiver 10, and its address are applied to the external registering device 20.  Under this condition, the input section 6 of the external registering device 20 is operated to store a new character or pattern to in the address of the character or pattern to be renewed.  The character or pattern thus inputted is recognized by the control section 5 of the external registering device, and converted into electrical signal data which is outputted.  In this operation, the wireless selective calling receiver 10 applies the address, which is changed in the memory section 3,  to the external registering device 20, to allow the operator to recognize it. One of the signal data is displayed on the display section 4 of the external registering device 20; that is, the character or pattern to be changed and its storing address are<br><br>
displayed for the operator who has inputted the character or pattern.  The other signal data is transmitted from the control section 5 to the output section 7, and sent through the signal transmitting line 8 to the wireless selective calling receiver 10.<br>
The character or pattern data sent to the wireless selective calling receiver 10 are transmitted to the control section 2 and the memory section 3 in the wireless selective calling receiver 10.  And, the character or pattern data are transmitted through the control section 2 of the wireless selective calling receiver*  more specifically, one of the signal data is newly stored in the existing address in the memory section 3 of the receiver 10, while the other is displayed on the display section 1.  In this case, the wireless selective calling receiver 10 applies the addresses of character or pattern data changed in the memory section 3 to the external registering device 20.  Alternatively, the embodiment may be so modified that the character or pattern data are stored directly in the memory section 3 of the receiver 10.  The character or pattern data, which have been stored in the memory section 3 of the receiver 10, similarly as in the case of the character or pattern data which have been registered, are displayed on the display section 1 of the receiver 10.<br>
FIG. 2 is a diagram for a description of the operations of the receiver 10 and the device 20 in the following case:<br><br>
The input pattern is "a house with a chimney".  The input pattern is actually inputted with the input section 6 of the device 20.  The pattern data thus inputted is displayed on the display section 4 under the control of the control section 5 of the device 20, and is transmitted through the output section 7 and the signal transmitting line 8 to the receiver 10, so as to be stored in the memory section 3 of the receiver 10 and displayed on the display section 1.<br>
As is seen from FIG. 2, in FIG. 1 the input section 6 and the display section 4 in the device 2 are different blocks; however, they may be one unit in which the input section 6 is a tablet with a pen, and the display section 4 is a liquid crystal display unit.<br>
The signal transmitting line 8 through which the receiver 10 and the device 20 are connected to each other may be a cable which has terminal connectors at both ends which are readily connected to the receiver 10 and the device 20.<br>
As was described above, the invention provides the wireless selective calling receiver which is able to register formed optional character or pattern data in the memory device therein, or change character or pattern data which have been registered; and an external registering device which is able to register formed optional character or pattern data in the memory device of the wireless selective calling receiver or change character or pattern data which have been registered.   The wireless selective calling<br><br>
receiver is connected to the external registering device through the connecting means, so that, instead of the fixed character or pattern data which have been registered, optional character or pattern data can be registered.<br><br><br>
