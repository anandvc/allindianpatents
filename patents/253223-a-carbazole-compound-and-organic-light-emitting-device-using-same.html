CARBAZOLE DERIVATIVE AND ORGANIC LIGHT<br>
EMITTING DEVICE USING SAME<br>
Technical Field<br>
[1] The present invention relates to a novel organic compound and an organic light<br>
emitting device using die same.<br>
Background Art<br>
[3] An organic light emitting device has a structure in which an anode, a cathode, and<br>
an organic material layer including a single molecule or polymers between these<br>
electrodes are layered, and is based on a mechanism in which an electron and a hole<br>
which are injected from the cathode and the anode into the organic material layer form<br>
an exciton, and in which light having certain wavelengths is generated when the<br>
exciton drops to a ground state.<br>
[4] The principle of the organic light emitting device was discovered for the first time<br>
by Pope et al. using a single crystal of anthracene in the year 1965. Subsequently, in<br>
the year 1987, Tang in Kodak Co. suggested an organic light emitting device having a<br>
function-separation type of laminate structure in which an organic material layer is<br>
divided into two layers: a hole transport layer and a light emitting layer. It was<br>
confirmed (hat high emission intensity of 1000 cd/m2 or more was obtained at a low<br>
voltage not more than 10 V in the organic light emitting device (Tang, C. W.;<br>
VanSlyke, S.A. AppL Phys. Lett. 1987,57,913). With this as an impetus, the organic<br>
electroluminescent device has started to be watched with keen interest, and, recently,<br>
many studies are being intensely conducted on an organic electroluminescent device<br>
having a function-separation type of laminate structure.<br>
[5] However, the organic light emitting device is problematic in that a light emitting<br>
lifetime is short, and durability and reliability are low. This is known to result from<br>
physical and chemical transformation, photochemical and electrochemical transformation,<br>
delamination, fusion, crystallization, and thermal decomposition of organic<br>
materials constituting layers of the organic light emitting device, and oxidation of a<br>
cathode.<br>
[6] Accordingly, there is a need to develop an organic material which is capable of<br>
being used in the organic light emitting device and to avoid the above problems.<br>
[7] Meanwhile, an organic material including carbazole, particularly an organic<br>
material having a linear structure which includes two carbazole molecules, has<br>
frequently been used for a long time as a drum photosensitive material for £ duplicator<br>
or as a photoconductive material. Furthermore, a trimer type of triindole compound,<br>
which has a nonlinear structure as shown in the following Formula and includes three<br>
carbazoles, is known.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
 [11] For example, a compound, in which R is H, CH3, or CH2CH2N(CH2CH2)2O in<br>
the above Formula, was known long ago as a byproduct generated in a biochemistry<br>
field (J Org Chem 1998,63(20), 7002-7008, Tetrahedron 1980,36,1439). Japanese<br>
Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 2004-123619 discloses a compound, in which R in<br>
the above Formula is H as an effective component of a stabilizing agent for organic<br>
materials. Additionally, Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 2004-055240<br>
discloses a compound having the basic structure of the above Formula as an electrode<br>
active material.<br>
[12] In an organic light emitting device field, many studies have been made into the use<br>
of a compound containing carbazole as a donor compound or a light emitting material<br>
capable of injecting or transporting holes. For example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open<br>
Publication No. 2001-261680 discloses the use of a compound in which R is an alkyl<br>
group having a carbon number of 2 to 24 in the above Formula as a photoconductive<br>
material, a nonlinear optical material, or an electroluminescent (EL) material.<br>
[13] However, in the case of the compound having the nonlinear trimer structure as<br>
described above, only a compound in which an amine group is substituted with<br>
hydrogen or an alkyl group can be generated or synthesized as a byproduct in the biochemistry<br>
field. Even if the compound having the trimer structure can be synthesized,<br>
synthesis thereof is difficult and the yield is very low, thus few studies have been made<br>
with respect to this. For example, when using the method disclosed in Japanese Parent<br>
Laid-Open Publication No. 2001-261680, only an alkyl group can be introduced to R<br>
in the above-mentioned Formula.Disclosure of Invention<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[32] Hereinafter, a detailed description will be given of Ihe present invention.<br>
[33] In an organic light emitting device field, it is known that carbazole or its derivatives<br>
can be used as a donor compound or a light emitting material capable of injecting or<br>
transporting holes. For example, the use of carbazole having an arylamine group<br>
introduced thereto as a hole transport material and a light emitting material is known<br>
(US 6,649,722). However, as described in the Background Art, up to now, among<br>
compounds of carbazole and its derivatives, an organic material which is capable of<br>
assuring light emitting efficiency and stability of the organic light emitting device so as<br>
to commercialize (he organic light emitting device has not been developed.<br>
[34] A study has been made into the use of trimer compounds of carbazole or its<br>
derivatives as a donor material or a light emitting material, which is capable of<br>
injecting or transporting holes, of an organic light emitting device. However, since it is<br>
difficult to synthesize the trimer compounds of carbazole or its derivatives, variety of<br>
the type of compounds has not been assured, thus there is a limit to the study of the<br>
usage of the above compounds.<br>
[35] The present inventors have conducted repeated studies into trimer compounds of<br>
carbazole or its derivatives, resulting in the synthesis of a novel compound of the<br>
following Formula 1.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
In the above Formula 1, XI to X3 and Rl to R3 are the same as in the abovementioned<br>
definition.<br>
Representative examples of the compound of Formula 1 include a compound of<br>
Formula 2 and a compound of Formula 3.<br>
Formula 2<br>
In the above Formula 2, Rl to R3 are a substituted or unsubstituted aromatic group,<br>
or a substituted or unsubstituted heteroaromatic group, and<br>
R4 to R15 are each selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, a halogen atom,<br>
a nitriie group (CN), a Ditto group (NO2), a formyl group, an acetyl group, a benzoyl<br>
group, an amide group, a styryl group, an acetylene group, a quinoline group, a<br>
quinazoline group, a phenanthroline group, a cuproin group, a substituted or unsubstituted<br>
alkyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted aromatic group, a substituted or<br>
unsubstituted aralkyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted arylamine group, a<br>
substituted or unsubstituted alkylamine group, a substituted or unsubstituted aralkylamine<br>
group, and a substituted or unsubstituted heterocyclic group.<br>
Formula 3<br>
In the above Formula 3:<br>
Rl to R3 each are selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, a substituted or<br>
unsubsiHuted alkyl group, a substituted or unsubstiluted aromatic group, and a<br>
substituted or unsubstituted heteroaromatic group;<br>
R4 to R9 each are selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, a halogen atom,<br>
a nitrite group (CN), a nitro group (NO2), a formyl group, an acetyl group, a benzoyl<br>
group, an amide group, a styryl group, an acetylene group, a quinoline group, a<br>
quinazoline group, a phenanthroline group, a cuproin group, a substituted or unsubstituted<br>
alkyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted aromatic group, a substituted or<br>
unsubstituted aralkyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted arylamine group, a<br>
substituted or unsubstituted alkylamine group, a substituted or unsubstituted aralkylamine<br>
group, and a substituted or unsubstituted heterocyclic group; and<br>
Y is selected from the group consisting of 0, S, and NR' (R' is selected from the<br>
group consisting of hydrogen, a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group, and a<br>
substituted or unsubstituted aromatic group).<br>
Structural characteristics of compounds of Formulae 2 and 3, and their effects are as<br>
follows.<br>
Hie compound of the above Formula 2 has a trimer structure including three<br>
carbazoles, in which an amine group of carbazole is substituted with an aromatic<br>
group. The compound of the above Formula 3 has a trimer structure including three<br>
carbazole derivatives in which a 5-membered hetero ring such as thiophene is<br>
positioned at the position of one benzene of carbazole.<br>
[60] In the compounds of Formulae 2 and 3, monomers, that is, carbazole or its<br>
derivatives, constituting the trimer do not affect each other in view of chemical<br>
structures. Furthermore, in the above compounds, an increase in a conjugation length<br>
due to trimerization is not so big as in a compound having a linear structure. For the<br>
same reason, in the compounds of Fonnulae 2 and 3, optical, spectroscopic, and electrochemical<br>
properties of the monomers are not changed significantly.<br>
[61] Accordingly, the compounds of Formulae 2 and 3 have intrinsic properties of<br>
carbazole and carbazole derivatives in which the 5-membered hetero ring such as<br>
thiophene is positioned at one benzene of carbazole, that is, hole injection or transport<br>
properties and/or light emitting properties in the organic light emitting device. Thus,<br>
the compounds of Formulae 2 and 3 can act as a hole injection material, a hole<br>
transport material, a light emitting host, or a light emitting dopant hi the organic light<br>
emitting device.<br>
'62] Additionally, since molecular weight increases while the intrinsic properties of<br>
carbazole or its derivatives are maintained in the compounds of Formulae 2 and 3, they<br>
are thermally more stable man compounds of the monomers. Therefore, the<br>
compounds of the present invention can increase the life of the organic light emitting<br>
device.<br>
63] Furthermore, as described above, since the compounds of Formulae 2 and 3 have<br>
conjugation lengths that are relatively shorter than those of compounds having linear<br>
structures, an energy band gap is wide, thus they are used as a host material, along with<br>
fluorescent guest materials and particularly phosphorescent guest materials, in the<br>
organic light emitting device.<br>
64] Meanwhile, in the compound of Formula 2, an amine group is substituted with an<br>
aromatic group with respect to the conventional carbazole trimer compound hi which<br>
an amine group is substituted with hydrogen or an alkyl group. In Formula 2, the<br>
aromatic group substituting (he amine group affects a HOMO (highest occupied<br>
molecular orbital) energy level of the compound, unlike hydrogen or the alkyl group.<br>
Accordingly, the HOMO energy level of the compound of Formula 2 as the hole<br>
injection and/or transport material or me light emitting material is optimized depending<br>
on the type of aromatic group substituting the amine group, and preferably, depending<br>
on the number of amine contained in the aromatic group.<br>
65] Based on the above description, the compound of Formula 2 can improve the<br>
stability of holes, hole transport properties and/or light emitting properties of the<br>
organic light emitting device hi comparison with the carbazole trimer compound, in<br>
which the amine group is substituted with hydrogen or the alkyl group as disclosed in<br>
the prior art. Thereby, efficiency of the device is improved. For example, in the<br>
compound of the present invention, an aromatic group having excellent light emitting<br>
efficiency is introduced to the ainine group, thereby a light emitting material having<br>
excellent light emitting properties, for example, a host material or a dopant material, is<br>
prepared.<br>
[66] Even though the compound of Formula 2 has the above-mentioned advantages, it<br>
has not been synthesized in the prior art due to difficulty in synthesis. Thus, there has<br>
been no study of die usage of the above compound. A method of producing die<br>
compound of Formula 2 will be described later.<br>
[67] The above-mentioned basic physical properties of the compound according to the<br>
present invention result from a structure in which carbazole is trimerized like the<br>
compound of Formula 2 and the amine group of carbazole is substituted with the<br>
aromatic group, or a structure in which the carbazole derivatives where the<br>
5-membered hetero ring such as thiophene is positioned at one benzene of carbazole<br>
are trimerized like Formula 3. Since the basic structure of the compound of the present<br>
invention is not changed depending on the substituents of (he compound, (he basic<br>
physical properties of the compound according to the present invention are not<br>
changed depending on the substituents. However, in the compounds of Formulae 2 and<br>
3, the degree of realization of basic physical properties, emission wavelength of light<br>
and/or other incidental properties are changed depending on the types of substituents.<br>
[68] The method of producing the compound according to the present invention is as<br>
follows.<br>
[69] In the prior art, the compounds of Formula 2 and Formula 3 cannot be synthesized<br>
because it is difficult to synthesize trimer compounds of carbazole or its derivatives.<br>
Particularly, the compound of Formula 2, in which the amine group is substituted with<br>
die aromatic group in the carbazole trimer, cannot be produced using die mediod of<br>
producing die conventional carbazole trimer compound, in which the amine group is<br>
substituted with die alkyl group in die carbazole trimer. For example, in die prior art, in<br>
order to produce die compound in which die amine group of die carbazole trimer is<br>
substituted with die alkyl group, a carbazole monomer, in which die amine group is<br>
substituted with die alkyl group, is produced and men trimerized. With die above conventional<br>
procedure, however, it is impossible to produce die compound of Formula 2,<br>
in which die amine group is substituted with die aromatic group.<br>
[70] After die compound of Formula 4 is produced, die compound of Formula 4, a<br>
precursor of die aromatic compound which will substitute die amine group, Na(t-BuO),<br>
a Pd2(dab)3 catalyst, and a 2-(di-t-burylphosphino)diphenyl Ugand are reacted in a<br>
xylene solvent to produce die compound of Formula 2.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
 [75] The compound of Formula 3 may be produced using a niethod in which a carbazole<br>
derivative monomer where a 5-membered hetero ring such as (hiopheae are positioned<br>
at one benzene of carbazole is trimerized and a substituenl is introduced to an amine<br>
group of the carbazole derivative, or a method in which the amine group of the<br>
carbazole derivative monomer is substituted with the substituent and the monomer is<br>
then trimerized.<br>
[76] Examples of the halogen atom of the substituents of Formulae 2 and 3 include<br>
fluorine (F), chlorine (Q), bromine (Br), and iodine (I).<br>
[77] An alkyl group of the substituents of Formulae 2 and 3 preferably has a ca/bon<br>
number of 1 - 20, and is exemplified by a straight chain alkyl group, such as a methyl<br>
group, an ethyl group, a propyl group, or a hexyl group, and a branched chain alkyl<br>
group, such as an isopropyl group or a t-butyl group.<br>
[78] Examples of an aromatic group of the substituents of Formulae 2 and 3 include a<br>
monocyclic aromatic group, such as a phenyl group, a polycyclic aromatic group, such<br>
as naphthyl, anthryl, pyrene, and perylene, and a heterocyclic aromatic group, such as<br>
pyridine.<br>
[79] Examples of an aralkyl group of the substituents of Formulae 2 and 3 include an<br>
alkyl group having a carbon number of 1 - 20 which is substituted with aromatic hydrocarbons,<br>
such as phenyl, biphenyl, naphthyl, terphenyl, anthryl, pyrel, and perylene.<br>
[80] Examples of an arylamine group of die substituents of Formulae 2 and 3 include an<br>
amine group which is substituted with aromatic hydrocarbons, such as phenyl,<br>
biphenyl, naphthyl, terphenyl, anthryl, pyrene, and perylene.<br>
[81] Examples of an alkylamine group of (he substituents of Formulae 2 and 3 include<br>
an amine group which is substituted with aliphatic hydrocarbons having a carbon<br>
number of 1-20.<br>
[82] Examples of an aralkylamine group of the substituents of Formulae 2 and 3 include<br>
an amine group which is substituted with aromatic hydrocarbons, such as phenyl,<br>
biphenyl, naphthyl, lerphenyl, anthryl, pyrene, and perylene, and aliphatic hydrocarbons<br>
having a carbon number of 1 - 20.<br>
[83] Examples of a heterocyclic group of the substituents of Formulae 2 and 3 include a<br>
pyrrolyl group, a thienyl group, an indole group, an oxazol group, an imidazole group,<br>
a thiazd group, a pyridyl group, a pyrirnidine group, a piperazine group, a thiophene<br>
group, a ruran group, and a pyridazinyl group.<br>
[84] Substituted alkyl, aromatic, aralkyl, arylamine, alkylamine, aralkylamine, and heterocyclic<br>
groups of the substituenls of Formulae 2 and 3 may include a halogen atom,<br>
such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine, a nitrile group, a nitro group, a formyl<br>
group, an acetyl group, an arylamine group, an alkylamine group, an aralkylamine<br>
group, a benzoyl group, an amide group, a styryl group, an acetylene group, a phenyl<br>
group, a naphthyl group, an anthryl group, a pyrene group, a perylene group, a pyridyl<br>
group, a pyridazyl group, a pyrrolyl group, an imidazolyl group, a quinolyl group, an<br>
enthrone group, an acridone group, and an acridine group.<br>
[85] In an embodiment of the present invention, the compound of Formula 2 may be a<br>
compound in which Rl to R3 each are substituted or unsubstituted aromatic groups;<br>

 [172] Furthermore, the present invention provides an organic light emitting device whic<br>

[ 173] The organic material layer of the organic light emitting device according to the<br>
present invention may have a single layer structure, or alternatively, a multilayered<br>
structure in which two or more organic material layers are layered. For example, as the<br>
organic material layer, the organic light emitting device of the present invention may<br>
have a hole injection layer, a hole transport layer, a light emitting layer, an electron<br>

 [256] EXAMPLE 1<br>
[257]<br>
[258] Preparation of an organic light emitting device<br>
[259]<br>
[260] A glass substrate, on which ITO (indium tin oxide) was applied to a thickness of<br>
1500 A to form a thin film, was put in distilled water, in which a detergent was<br>
dissolved, and washed for 30 min using ultrasonic waves. Subsequently, ultrasonic<br>
washing was conducted in distilled water twice for 10 min. A product manufactured by<br>
Fischer Inc. was used as the detergent, and distilled water was produced by filtering<br>
twice using a filter manufactured by Millipore Inc. After the washing using distilled<br>
water was finished, ultrasonic washing was conducted sequentially using isopropyl<br>
alcohol, acetone, and methanol solvents, and drying was then conducted. Next, it was<br>
transported to a plasma washing machine. Subsequently, the substrate was washed<br>
using nitrogen plasma for 5 min, and then transported to a vacuum evaporator.<br>
[261] Hexanitrile hexaazalriphenylene of the following Formula 5 was vacuum deposited<br>
to a thickness of 500 A by heating on a transparent ITO electrode, which was prepared<br>
through the above procedure, so as to form a hole injection layer. The compound of<br>
Formula 2-1, which was a material transporting holes and was produced in preparation<br>
example 1, was vacuum deposited thereonto in a thickness of 400 A, and the<br>
compound (Alq3) of Formula 6 was vacuum deposited thereonto in a thickness of 300<br>
A, to form a light emitting layer. A compound of Formula 7 was vacuum deposited on<br>
the light emitting layer to a thickness of 200 A so as to form an electron transport<br>
layer. Lithium fluoride (LiF) having a thickness of 10 A and aluminum having a<br>
thickness of 2500 A were sequentially deposited to form a cathode.<br>
[262] In the above procedure, the deposition speed of an organic material was maintained<br>
at 1 A/sec, and lithium fluoride and aluminum were deposited at a speed of 0.2 A/sec<br>
and 3 7 A/sec, respectively.<br>
[263] In the resulting organic light emitting device, an intrinsic green spectrum of Alq3<br>
having brightness of 4000 cd/m2 was observed at a forward current density of 100 mAJ<br>
cm2, and corresponded to x of 0.34 and y of 0.56 based on a 1931 Cffi color<br>
coordinate.<br>

EXAMPLE 2<br>
The procedure of example 1 was repeated to produce an organic light emitting<br>
device except that the compound of Fonnula 2-2 was used as a hole transport material<br>
instead of the compound of Fonnula 2-1.<br>
la the resulting organic light emitting device, an intrinsic green spectrum of Alq3<br>
having brightness of 4960 cd/m2 was observed at a forward current density of 100 mA/<br>
cm2, and corresponded to x of 0.33 and y of 0.56 based on a 1931CEE color<br>
coordinate.<br>
[278]<br>
[279] EXAMPLE 3<br>
[280]<br>
c The procedure of example 1 was repeated to produce an organic light emitting<br>
device, except that the compound of Formula 2-9 was used as a hole transport material<br>
instead of the compound of Formula 2-1.<br>
[282] In the resulting organic light emitting device, an intrinsic green spectrum of AJq3<br>
having brightness of 49S9 cd/m2 was observed at a forward current density of 100 mA/<br>
cm2, and corresponded to x of 0.33 and y of 0.56 based on a 1931 CDE color<br>
coordinate.<br>
[283]<br>
[284] COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1<br>
[285]<br>
[286] The procedure of example 1 was repeated to produce an organic light emitting<br>
device except that NPB, which was conventionally known as a hole transport material,<br>
was vacuum deposited to a thickness of 400 A on a hole injection layer instead of the<br>
compound of Formula 2-1 to form a hole transport layer.<br>
[287] In the resulting organic light emitting device, an intrinsic green spectrum of Alq3<br>
having brightness of 340 cd/m1 was observed at a forward current density of 100 mA/<br>
cm2, and corresponded to x of 0.32 and y of 0.56 based on a 1931 CDE color<br>
coordinate.<br>
[288]<br>
[289] From the results of the above-mentioned examples and comparative example, it can<br>
be seen that the compounds of the present invention function to transport holes like<br>
NPB, which is a conventional hole transport material, and improve the efficiency of a<br>
device at the same current density in comparison with NPB.<br>
