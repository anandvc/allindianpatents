				<td>"Multiplexing Unit, System and Process for Communication in a Computer Network."<br>
This invention relates to a multiplexing unit for communication in a computer network<br>
among a number of client machines that support client programs and one or more servers that<br>
support application programs, whereby the client programs and the application programs may be<br>
incompatible.<br>
It also deals with a communication system that integrates one or more of such units, as<br>
well as a process that it will be able to use.<br>
The invention will find its application in particular in the field of travel or shipping<br>
reservations by computerized systems.<br>
Such systems, commonly called CRS (computerized reservation systems), use<br>
communications by computer networks to connect clients (such as agents in the travel sector or<br>
private individuals) and the central services of companies dealing with reservations.<br>
These systems are brought in to provide very diverse components such as servers,<br>
computer terminals, and individual e-mail using varied and often multipart links that consist of<br>
local or worldwide networks.<br>
This heterogeneity is also found at the level of data formats and communication protocols.<br>
If certain protocols, suchas the HTTP/HTML combination, are adequately standardized to limit<br>
interoperability problems, others such as HOP or JRMP require that the parts agree on common<br>
interfaces even if the manner of showing it on a network is standardized. -<br>
There is therefore a significant need to rationalize the mode of operation and<br>
communication in computerized systems as described above.<br>
On this subject, multiplexing devices are currently proposed according to several variants.<br>
Overall, they ensure a centralization of connections and a reduction in the number of connections<br>
necessary for data routing.<br>
They do not provide full satisfaction, however. Thus, they have problems of response<br>
time or, when they are set up close to a group of machines, they are awkward to run.<br>
Furthermore, it is hard to administer a large number of clients: it is necessary that the<br>
servers support several versions of applications to meet the requests of clients whose software<br>
systems are at different update levels.<br>
Another drawback of the current systems is that their use is not flexible, in particular in<br>
terms of the load distribution between the servers, fault management and possible bottlenecks.<br>
Solutions to the problems mentioned were proposed, such as the use of middleware.<br>
This is software that acts as an intermediary between a client part and a server part of the<br>
system.<br>
Their use involves, however, awkward adaptations of the applications. They therefore<br>
weigh on the costs and development periods. This drawback is all the more important, provided<br>
that the middleware should also be deployed, which increases the risks of non-interoperability and<br>
complicates the administration tasks.<br>
In terms of compatibility of the applications brought into play in computerized systems,<br>
the multiplexing means and the middleware currently known do not offer any specific solution.<br>
Known from document WO-A-99,44155, however, is a device for the conversion of data<br>
and the distribution of load in a computer network. According to this document, conversion of<br>
the data into a fixed format is initiated systematically so as to facilitate their processing. A<br>
system of assigning a server to certain clients and managing their throttling is also shown.<br>
This system is static and does not make it possible to select the server based on the<br>
contents of the client messages.<br>
This device is clearly oriented toward using a unique protocol that is EDIFACT. It does<br>
not seek to ensure complete compatibility, regardless of the formats and protocols used by a given<br>
server.<br>
Furthermore, the proposed load distribution is limited to specific circumstances and does<br>
not seek to administer the activity of the servers globally. In addition, this system is not modular.<br>
which hinders its upgradability, and the path followed by the messages comprises numerous steps<br>
that unfavorably influence the response time of the network.<br>
The mechanism is produced in the code of clients and servers that should therefore be<br>
modified to use it.<br>
The invention that is proposed here has as its object to remedy the drawbacks of the<br>
techniques known until then.<br>
One of its first objectives is to ensure an effective conversion of messages to make them<br>
compatible with any target application. The invention therefore makes possible communication<br>
between all of the components of the network.<br>
In the same step, it makes it possible to organize the multiplexing of data by using input<br>
and output management modules that are easily controUed by an administration element: for<br>
example, the integration of a new type of client in the system will be carried out quickly by the<br>
creation of a new input management module. As for clients who use the same protocol that is<br>
used under the same conditions, they will be able to share the same input management module. It<br>
is seen well that the invention set forth here offers modularity and a capacity for adaptation to the<br>
structural or functional evolution of the network.<br>
It also ensures an optimized management of the throttling of servers by a load distribution<br>
according to determined criteria, such as the nature of the request, the space requirement, and<br>
possible faults.<br>
This unit can also be administered in a centralized way<br>
Other objects and advantages of the invention will emerge during the following description<br>
that exhibits a preferred but non-limiting embodiment.<br>
This invention relates to a multiplexing unit for communication in acomputer network<br>
among a number of client machines that support client programs and one or more servers that<br>
support application programs, whereby the client programs and the application programs may be<br>
incompatible, characterized by the fact that it comprises:<br>
- For each type of client machine, an input management module that receives requests from<br>
client programs and transmits the responses to them;<br>
- For a server or a group of servers, an output management module that transmits to the<br>
server the client messages that are addressed to it and that transmits the responses to the<br>
input management modules of the client machines;<br>
- Routing means that are connected to input and output management modules that are able<br>
to define the identity of at least one output management module for the processing of a<br>
request and to determine the identity of the client machine to which the message that is<br>
obtained from the target server is to be addressed;<br>
- And conversion means that are able to convert, if necessary, the contents of the request<br>
into a client message that is compatible with the application program of the target server<br>
and the contents of the message that is obtained from the target server into a response that<br>
is compatible with the client program.<br>
This unit can be presented under the following variants:<br>
- The routing means comprise load distribution means that can define the identity of a target<br>
server for the processing of a request according to load conditions,<br>
- The routing means comprise at least one routing application module that can be attached<br>
to the remainder of the routing means and that can carry out routing functions according<br>
to predetermined rules,<br>
- The conversion means comprise at least one conversion application module that can be<br>
attached to the remainder of the conversion means and can carry out predetermined<br>
conversion functions,<br>
- The output management modules comprise a queue file device that can concentrate the<br>
input to the servers,<br>
- It comprises an administration module that can administer the creation, the suppression,<br>
the modification and the state of operation of the input and output management modules.<br>
The invention also relates to a system for communication in a computer network among<br>
a number of client machines that support client programs and one or more servers that support<br>
application programs, whereby the client programs and the application programs may be<br>
incompatible, characterized by the fact that it integrates at least one multiplexing unit according to<br>
the invention.<br>
According to an embodiment, the system comprises a monitoring agent that can control<br>
the administration module of the multiplexing unit or units.<br>
According to another possibility, it comprises extensions in the form of dynamic link<br>
libraries that can be loaded by a multiplexing unit to hold application modules.<br>
Finally, the invention describes a process for communication in a computer network<br>
among a number of client machines that support client programs and one or more servers that<br>
support application programs, whereby the client programs and the application programs may be<br>
incompatible, able to be used by the system according to the invention, characterized by the fact<br>
that<br>
- Each client machine of a type under consideration is connected to an input management<br>
module that receives the requests of the client program and transmits the responses to it;<br>
an output management module that transmits to the server the client messages that are<br>
addressed to it and that transmits the responses to the input management modules of the<br>
client machines is connected to a server;<br>
- The request is routed by recognition of the data of the request including the address of the<br>
input management module and the network address of the client machine from which it is<br>
obtained, then at least one target server is determined according to these data;<br>
- The request is converted into a client message of a format that is compatible with the<br>
target server or servers;<br>
- The client message is routed to the output management module of the target server for<br>
transmission;<br>
- The message that is obtained from the target server is routed and transmitted by the<br>
output management module by recognition of the message that is obtained from the target<br>
server, then the corresponding client machine is determined according to the result of this<br>
recognition;<br>
- If necessary, before or after its routing, the message that is obtained from the target server<br>
is converted into a response of a format that is compatible with the client machine or<br>
machines;<br>
- The response is routed to the input management module of the client machine for<br>
transmission.<br>
This process may comprise the following stages:<br>
- The data of the request that are recognized for its routing comprise the nature of its<br>
contents,<br>
- For the routing of the request and the message that is obtained from the target server, at<br>
least one attachable routing application module is invoked to carry out predetermined<br>
routing functions,<br>
- For the conversion of the request and the message that is obtained from the target server,<br>
at least one attachable conversion application module is invoiced to carry out<br>
predetermined conversion functions.<br>
The throttling is administered differently according to the number and the nature of the<br>
output management modules that are selected by the routing mechanism.<br>
- If a single output management module was found during the routing and receives<br>
throttling messages, the throttling is then administered by:<br>
?Definition, at the level of the output management module, of a maximum<br>
number of messages that can be processed by the server up to a new<br>
definition;<br>
? Counting the number of client messages received by the output<br>
management module;<br>
? Subtraction of the number of client messages received from the maximum<br>
number to obtain a number of acceptable messages so as to determine a<br>
throttling level.<br>
If all of the output management modules that are found during the routing receive<br>
throttling messages, the following operations are carried out for each one:<br>
" Definition, at the level of the output management module, of a maximum<br>
number of messages that can be processed by the server up to a new<br>
definition;<br>
? Counting of the number of client messages received by the output<br>
management module;<br>
? Subtraction of the number of client messages received from the maximum<br>
number to obtain a number of acceptable messages so as to determine a<br>
throttling level,<br>
and the output management module that has the best throttling level is selected.<br>
- If only a portion of the output management modules found during the routing receive<br>
throttling messages and the other portion is not subject to the throttling:<br>
1. The following operations are carried out for each output management module that<br>
receives throttling messages:<br>
" Definition, at the level of the output management module, of a maximum<br>
number of messages that can be processed by the server up to a new<br>
definition;<br>
? Counting of the number of client messages received by the output<br>
management module;<br>
? Subtraction of the number of client messages received from the maximum<br>
number to obtain a number of acceptable messages so as to determine a<br>
throttling level;<br>
? The number of acceptable messages is divided by the time remaining up to<br>
a new definition of the maximum number of acceptable messages to obtain<br>
a request submission frequency;<br>
? The request submission frequency is added to the current time to determine<br>
from when the output management module can accept a new client<br>
message.<br>
2. The client message is directed to the first output management module that receives<br>
throttling messages that can accept it<br>
3. The client message is directed to another output management module if no output<br>
management module that receives throttling messages can accept it.<br>
The bad is distributed among the output management modules that do not receive<br>
throttling messages by the following operations:<br>
1. Construction of a table of output management modules that do not receive<br>
throttling messages<br>
2. Incrementing a counter with each client message received<br>
3. Integer division of the counter number by the number of output management<br>
modules that do not receive throttling messages<br>
4. Use of the remainder of the division as an index in the table to find the output<br>
management module that does not receive throttling messages to be used.<br>
The attached drawings are provided by way of non-limiting examples. They represent an<br>
embodiment. They will make it possible to understand the invention easily.<br>
Figures 1 and 2 show two multiplexing embodiments according to the prior art.<br>
Figure 3 shows a diagram of the installing of middleware between a client part and a<br>
server part.<br>
Figure 4 is an overall view of the invention.<br>
Figure 5 illustrates various stages of operation of the invention.<br>
In Figure 2, a standard organization of the computer network was shown. In this<br>
network, a number of client machines 1 are connected to one or more servers 3 that are often at a<br>
location that is removed from the client machines. By way of example, the clients can be private<br>
individuals who are connected to the network, for example, by means of a worldwide extension<br>
network 2, such as the Internet, or operators that specialize in the travel field. They can also be<br>
computer servers.<br>
The networks currently use a large number of client machines. It is therefore preferably<br>
necessary to seek to minimize the number of connections among client machines 1 and servers 3,<br>
concentration and switching operations carried out by means of multiplexing.<br>
In the case of Figure 2, certain client machines 1 are, by means of network 2, connected<br>
with a single server 3. The clients should have knowledge of the server or servers to which they<br>
can be connected. The time for establishing connections is very important and in case of<br>
connection failure, the client generally cannot know if the failure is due to the network or to the<br>
server. The only fault tolerance mechanism that it can use is to try to establish a connection with<br>
another server that offers the same service, which is long, hazardous and complicates the use and<br>
the development of the client program.<br>
Multiplexings were proposed that make possible abetter response time. A configuration<br>
thereof is illustrated in Figure 1. In this framework, multiplexers 4 are positioned downstream<br>
from a group of client machines 1 so as to manage their communications with network 2.<br>
It is understood that if multiplexers 4 are multiplied, the management of the network<br>
becomes difficult. Actually, in case of adaptation, development or evolution of certain constituent<br>
parts of the network, it is necessary to carry out operations of updating in multiplexers 4 that can<br>
be remote and can sometimes be located at a client site or commercial partner site.<br>
To remedy these drawbacks and those disclosed previously for this type of multiplexing,<br>
the use of middleware 9 as shown in Figure 3 was proposed.<br>
In this figure, middleware 9 constitutes an intermediary software between a client part and <br>
a server part.<br>
The client part comprises a client activity layer 5 where certain processing is carried out,<br>
as well as an interface layer 7 with middleware 9.<br>
In contrast, a server activity layer 6 is present and communicates to middleware 9 by<br>
means of an interface layer 8.<br>
The drawbacks of the uses of middleware 9 were already mentioned above.<br>
The solution proposed by the invention is illustrated diagrammaticaUy in Figures 4 and 5.<br>
In a general way, it is seen in Figure 4 that the invention connects a client activity layer 10<br>
and a server activity layer 11. This connection is carried out by standard network interface layers<br>
12,13.<br>
To carry out the communication, a communication system 15 according to the invention is<br>
present and connected to a standard network layer 14.<br>
Diagrammatically, communication system 15 was shown in two diagram blocks that<br>
disclose the modularity of the invention.<br>
Also present, via arrows, are message transfers from client activity layer 10 to server<br>
activity layer 11. The direction of the arrows, proposed here by way of example, goes in the<br>
client-server direction, but the reverse is also, of course, carried out.<br>
A request 20 is addressed to communication system 15 from client activity layer 10 and,<br>
by means of communication system IS according to the invention, is reflected at the activity layer<br>
of server 11 in a client message 22.<br>
For the transmission of such a client message 22 to the server, routing functions, and<br>
optionally load distribution or else conversion, are carried out.<br>
In the remainder of the description and to understand the invention well, the term "request<br>
20" designates a message that is sent by the client and the word "response 21" designates a<br>
message that is received by the client.<br>
By referring now to Figure 5, it is seen that by way of example, a communication between<br>
a client machine 16 and a server 17 was shown.<br>
Their connection is carried out by means of a multiplexing unit according to the invention.<br>
Such a unit can use a number of client machines 16 and servers 17. Furthermore, the system<br>
according to the invention, which integrates the thus presented multiplexing unit, can comprise<br>
other similar units according to the invention.<br>
The proposed system is therefore perfectly modular and organized and can be monitored<br>
and administered in a centralized way.<br>
Below, particular embodiments of the multiplexing unit according to the invention are<br>
described.<br>
Figure 5 shows the formation for each client machine 16 of an input management module<br>
18. Such a management module 18 is created for each type of client machine to be connected and<br>
can be modified or eliminated as required.<br>
The input management module ensures the reception of requests 20 that are obtained from<br>
the client machine and the transmission of responses 21 to these requests 20. The path followed<br>
by the request that is obtained from a client program supported by client machine 16 was<br>
identified by an arrow 20.<br>
Furthermore, in the multiplexing unit, an output management module 19 is assigned to one<br>
or more servers 17. In a similar way, output management module 19 has as its function to receive<br>
the messages to be processed by server or servers 17 and to reflect them to the latter.<br>
As shown, a queue files system is run to form a client message file 22 to be processed at<br>
the level of output management module 19. A queue files device identified by 26 is illustrated on<br>
this subject in Figure 5.<br>
Routing means are present so as to determine one or more output management modules<br>
19, to which request 20, obtained from the client, machine, will be transferred.<br>
Connected, on the one hand, whh input management module 18 and, on the other hand,<br>
with output management module 19, the routing means make it possible to define the identity of<br>
at least one target output management module for processing a request 20, and conversely, the<br>
identity of the client machine to which message 23 that is obtained from the target server should<br>
be addressed.<br>
The routing means preferably comprise load distribution means 27 that will make ft<br>
possible to define the identity of a single output management module 19 for processing request 20<br>
according to the load parameters.<br>
Embodiments of this distribution will be described later, but parameters that can be taken<br>
into account will be indicated here and now: the fault state of any servers, the throttling of<br>
servers, and the nature of the messages to be processed.<br>
The load conditions are essentially defined in the system by messages of the maximum<br>
number of messages normally obtained from throttling agents. The latter can be installed at the<br>
level of servers or independent of one another.<br>
Furthermore, an administration module 36 is described later that can maintain values by<br>
default to compensate for failure of the throttling agent, if necessary.<br>
According to an advantageous possibility, routing means comprise one or more routing<br>
application modules 24,30. These modules are connected to routing sub-systems 29, 34<br>
connected with input management modules 18 and output management modules 19.<br>
Routing application modules 24,34 can be attached to the remainder of the routing<br>
means, which ensures a perfect modularity of operation.<br>
Routing decisions are preferably made at the level of application modules 24, 34. These<br>
decisions are then applied by the remainder of the routing means.<br>
Following the routing operations to be carried out, various application modules can be<br>
used and connected.<br>
In view of the scope of the computer networks that are used, compatibility problems arise<br>
with regard to formats and transfer protocols used by the client applications and the server<br>
applications.<br>
To remedy this, the multiplexing unit presented here comprises conversion means. These<br>
means ensure the conversion, if necessary, of the contents of requests 20 into client messages 22<br>
that are compatible and therefore exploitable by the application program of target server 17.<br>
Likewise, the conversion means carry out a conversion of the contents of message 23 that is<br>
obtained from target server 17 into a response 21 that is compatible with the client program in<br>
question.<br>
Advantageously, the design of the conversion means is similar to that of the routing<br>
means. This means that the conversion means comprise conversion sub-systems 28,33 that can<br>
communicate with conversion application modules 25, 31 to which they are connected. In a way<br>
parallel to the routing means, it will be possible to use and to upgrade application modules 25,31<br>
according to the conversion functions that are to be carried out.<br>
An application module is combined by configuration with an input or output management<br>
module. Consequently, it is possible to make several different application modules coexist within<br>
a multiplexing unit according to the invention. It is also possible to modify them or to use many<br>
of them without stopping the multiplexing unit.<br>
The sub-systems as presented can invoke one or more attachable application modules.<br>
Within the multiplexing unit, an administration module 36 will preferably be formed.<br>
Administration module 36 manages input management modules 18 and output management<br>
modules 19 of the unit. Module 36 creates, eliminates or modifies the input and output<br>
management modules. Furthermore, it can run statistical and verification functions on the state of<br>
modules, including the state of their load and their throttling. According to an advantageous<br>
possibility, the administration can be extended by one or more administration application modules<br>
35. These modules make possible the administration of routing and conversion application<br>
modules in particular to provide them with routing tables and descriptions of messages.<br>
Several multiplexing units as they have just been described can be used to constitute a<br>
communication system according to the invention. In this framework, the multiplexing units will<br>
be used in parallel and will manage a number of client machines 16 and servers 17.<br>
In this way, the monitoring of the communication system will be carried out in a<br>
centralized way for all of the multiplexing units. The system can thus comprise a monitoring<br>
agent that can control administration modules 36 of the units.<br>
By different management and monitoring tools, an operator, for example by means of a<br>
graphic interface, can manage and monitor the system by setting to work the monitoring agent,<br>
itself controlling administration modules 36.<br>
Furthermore, several multiplexing units can be placed in parallel in connection with the use<br>
of extensions in the form of Dynamic Link Libraries (DLL). These extensions can be loaded, as<br>
desired, by one or the other of the multiplexing units so as to extend its functionalities. These<br>
functionalities will be able to be used in routing sub-systems 29, 34, in conversion sub-systems 28,<br>
33 and in the monitoring and administration of the multiplexing units.<br>
These dynamic link libraries can constitute all of the following elements: application<br>
modules 24, 25, 30, 31 and administration application 35.<br>
The functionalities of the system can also be extended by this means in connection with the<br>
management of the throttling of the server.<br>
Below, the communication process according to the invention that can be used both by the<br>
communication system described above and by the multiplexing units that are in the system,<br>
forming an integral part of the invention, is described.<br>
Reference is also made to Figure 5 for illustrating the stages of this process.<br>
As indicated above in connection with the multiplexing unit, the clients are connected to<br>
an input management module. An output management module is connected to one or more<br>
servers or, according to another method, waits for the server connections. The principle of the<br>
invention is to accommodate existing clients and servers and their operational constraints without<br>
modification. When a request 20 is to be addressed to the remainder of the system for its<br>
processing, it is routed to a server 17 by observing routing data. Among the latter appears the<br>
address of input management module 18 and the network address of client machine 16.<br>
Other parameters can be used to determine the path of request 20 and in particular the<br>
contents of the request. The routing will thus comprise an operation for monitoring and analysis<br>
of the contents of request 20.<br>
The routing stage will preferably be carried out two times, one starting from a routing<br>
sub-system 29 in connection with input management module 18. The second is carried out by<br>
invoking at least one routing application module 24 that can be attached to sub-system 29. By<br>
using routing parameters, application module 24 determines the identity of one or more output<br>
management modules 19. The routing is then applied by sub-system 29.<br>
In the case where several possibilities of target servers were defined, one of them can be<br>
chosen according to load distribution criteria.<br>
Below, variants of the invention that can carry out such a load distribution between output<br>
management modules ! 9 according to throttling criteria will be described.<br>
When the identity of output management module 19 is determined at the end of the<br>
routing operation, a conversion stage of request 20 into a client message 22 that is compatible<br>
with target servers 17 will be carried out.<br>
When it is necessary, the conversion operation can also be carried out in two steps. The<br>
first consists in invoicing a conversion application module 25 that is connected front a conversion<br>
sub-system 28. Sub-system 28 invokes one or more conversion application modules 25 according<br>
to the conversion function to be run.<br>
Conversion application module 25 returns to sub-system 28 a client message 22 that is<br>
compatible with server 17.<br>
This client message 22 is transferred to server 17 via output management module 19 of<br>
server 17.<br>
At output management module 19, a queue file is created to receive client messages 22, to<br>
play a buffer role and to send the messages successively to server 17.<br>
A queue file is required to the extent that input management modules 18 are<br>
"multithread": i.e., able to submit several requests simultaneously.<br>
A different "thread" execution path is combined with each server 17 and the different<br>
execution paths pull messages in parallel from queue file 26.<br>
Once the client message is processed at server 17, the latter returns a server message 23.<br>
Corresponding to what was described at management module 18, a routing operation and<br>
then a conversion operation is carried out by invoking routing application modules 30 and<br>
conversion application modules 31.<br>
The routing of message 23 is carried out based on the recognition of the nature of this<br>
message 23.<br>
The conversion operation could be carried out before the routing function, but it is<br>
preferably carried out after. Actually, it is a longer operation but of a less uncertain outcome than<br>
that of the routing.<br>
According to a preferred variant of the process according to the invention, throttling is<br>
administered for the server or servers, or for at least a portion of servers 17 included in the<br>
system.<br>
The throttling is administered differently according to the number and the nature of the<br>
output management modules that are selected by the routing mechanism.<br>
If a single output management module was found during the routing and receives<br>
throttling messages, its throttling is then managed by:<br>
? Definition, at the level of the output management module, of a maximum<br>
number of messages that can be treated by the server up to a new<br>
definition;<br>
? Counting the number of messages received by the output management<br>
module;<br>
? Subtraction of the number of messages from the maximum number to<br>
obtain a number of acceptable messages so as to determine a throttling<br>
level.<br>
If all of the output management modules found receive throttling messages, then each<br>
output management module maintains a number of acceptable messages as described above. The<br>
routing mechanism selects the output management module with the largest number of acceptable<br>
messages, ie., the best throttling level.<br>
If a portion of the output management modules found receive throttling messages and<br>
another portion does not receive any and is therefore not subject to throttling, the purpose of the<br>
routing is to use as much as possible, within the imposed throttling limits, the throttled output<br>
management modules and then to evenly distribute the remaining load between the non-throttled<br>
output management modules. To do this, a request submission frequency is calculated for each<br>
throttled output management module by dividing the number of acceptable messages by the<br>
remaining time up to a new definition of the maximum number of acceptable messages and from<br>
this frequency, from when this output management module can accept a request. The routing<br>
mechanism selects the first throttled output management module that can accept a request and if<br>
no request is found, it selects a non-throttled management module according to the load<br>
distribution mechanism by default.<br>
For this purpose, and according to a preferred variant, a counter is maintained that is<br>
increased by one for each message received and initialized again in the case of exceeding capacity.<br>
The routing mechanism constructs a table of selected output management modules. It calculates<br>
the remainder of the integer division of the counter by the number of output management modules<br>
selected and selects the output management module that corresponds to this index in the table.<br>
