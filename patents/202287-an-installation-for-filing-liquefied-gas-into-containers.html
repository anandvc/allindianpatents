				<td>AN INSTALLATION FOR FILLING LIQUIFIED GAS INTO CONTAINERS TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an installation for filling liquified gas into containers. A first aspect of the invention relates to an installation having a distributed power supply system for supplying power consuming parts of the installation. A second aspect of the invention relates to an installation having a generator for generating power for supplying power consuming parts of the installation.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Installations for filling liquified gas into containers and accessories for such installations are known from a number of prior art documents, including EP 0 534 876 A1, EP 0 537 094 A1, EP 0 578 958 A1, EP 0 617 226 A1, EP 0 641 966 A1, EP 0 660 027 A1, EP 0 661 493 A1. Such prior art installations usually comprise one or more carrousels or turntables on which the containers are positioned during the process of filling them with liquified gas. A carrousel normally comprises a number of filling assemblies each of which is adapted to support a container.<br>
The filling assembly usually comprises different kind of equipment for handling the container before, during and after filling process, such as a scales, a valve, means for positioning the container in relation to the valve means for opening a closure/opening mechanism provided in the container and means for connecting the valve to the opening of container. The installation may further comprise an electronic control system for controlling the filling process, so that the desired amount of liquified gas may be filled into the container. Such equipment is usually driven by electrical power. In common prior art installations, an AC/DC power supply is associated to each filling assembly. In<br><br>
case the equipment of the filling assemblies is driven by direct current, each filling assembly may comprise means for converting alternating current into direct current. Due to the highly explosive environment, the risk of explosions caused by any electrical or other equipment capable of generating sparks/ignition has to be minimized. Thus, in usual installations this risk is - minimized by securing electrical and other equipment, e.g., by embedding electrical parts in special housings and/or by designing electrical circuits in a safe way.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
It has been found that the layout of an installation wherein an individual power supply is associated to each filling assembly needs extensive measures in order to minimise the risk of causing explosions, and thus installations with such a layout are expensive to manufacture and install. However, due to the relatively high power consumption of the equipment of the filling assemblies, no alternative layouts have been available so far.<br>
An object of the present invention is therefore to provide an installation for filling liquified gas into containers which is safe to a maximum degree while being relatively easy to implement and manufacture so as to thereby increase the security of the installation and to reduce the costs related to manufacturing and installation. A further object of the invention is to provide an installation wherein the power consumption of power consuming parts of the filling assemblies is reduced compared to prior art installations, so as to thereby reduce the operating costs of the installation.<br>
Thus, according to a first aspect, the present invention provides an installation for filling liquified gas into containers and comprising:<br><br>
a plurality of filling assemblies each of which comprises one or more power consuming parts, each filling assembly being adapted to support a container at least during the process of filling liquified gas into the container,<br>
at least one AC/DC to DC converter for converting alternating current from an alternating current power supply or direct current from a direct current power supply into direct current, each AC/DC to DC converter being adapted to supply direct current to at least two filling assemblies.<br>
The AC/DC to DC converter may be a AC to DC converter for converting alternating current into direct current or it may be a DC to DC converter or it may be a combination of an AC to DC converter and a DC to DC converter. In particular, a DC to DC converter may be adapted to reduce the voltage of direct current supplied to the converter from, e.g., 24 V to, e.g., 12 V. An AC to DC converter is typically adapted to convert alternating current having a RMS voltage of 230 V AC to direct current having a voltage of 12 V DC. The AC/DC to DC converter comprised in the installation according to the invention is preferably adapted to reduce the voltage of the electrical power supplied to the installation, the voltage being reduced from a relatively high level to a relatively low level, low voltage.<br>
In the present context, voltage at the relative high level which may be, e.g., 24 V DC or 230 V AC, is referred to as "high voltage" whereas the relative low level which may be, e.g., 12 V DC is referred to as "low voltage".<br>
Due to the special design of the power supplying system of an installation according to the invention, the power consuming parts of two or more filling assemblies may be supplied with current at low voltage. This has the particular advantage that, compared to prior art installations, fewer high voltage power supply units having a considerably higher risk of causing ignition than low voltage power supply units are required.<br><br>
Moreover, the power distribution network of the installation according to the invention has a considerably lower risk of causing ignition of the explosive atmosphere as compared to prior art installations. This is due to the fact that the power distribution network of an installation according to the invention is a low voltage network having a considerably lower risk of creating sparks. Preferably, all high voltage power supplying units in the distribution network of the installation are positioned in a non-explosive environment (non-hazardous area) so as to minimize risk of creating sparks and/or causing ignition of the explosive atmosphere in a highly explosive environment (hazardous area). In particular, all high voltage power supplying units may be positioned in a remote location relative to the filling assemblies.<br>
A still further advantage of an installation according to the invention is that the measures necessary in order to minimize the risk of creating sparks/ignition are easier to implement and cheaper to manufacture due to the fact that fewer high voltage parts and cables are required than in prior art installations.<br>
Preferably at least one of the filling assemblies and more preferably all of the filling assemblies are mounted on a movable structure such as, e.g., a carrousel or turntable or a conveyor.<br>
In case power is supplied from an alternating current supply, the voltage of the power supply is in the range between 110 V and 120 V or in the range between 210 V and 240 V. Usually the voltage of the alternating power supply is approximately 115 V or approximately 230 V. In case power is supplied from an direct power supply, the voltage of the direct current supply preferably is in the range between 1 and 100 V, such as between 5 and 50 V, usually between 8 and 32 V, such as approximately 24 V.<br>
A second aspect of the present invention relates to an installation for filling liquified gas into containers and comprising:<br><br>
at least one filling assembly each comprising one or more power consuming parts, each filling assembly being adapted to support a container at least during the process of filling liquified gas into the container,<br>

a stationary structure along which the movable structure may move, at least one generator for generating electrical current so as to supply current to the one or more power consuming parts, the at least one generator comprising one or more stationary parts and one or more moving parts,<br>
the relative movement between the stationary and the movable parts of the generator being generated by the relative movement between the movable structure and the stationary structure.<br>
An installation according to this aspect of the invention has the particular advantage compared to prior art installations that it requires no power distribution network comprising current leading cable or electrical parts capable of creating sparks and/or causing ignition of the explosive atmosphere. Moreover, an installation according to the invention is easy to manufacture and to install as it requires no power distribution network, and the operation costs of such an installation are kept to a minimum.<br>
It should be understood that the terms "movable parts" and "stationary parts" should not be interpreted as "globally movable" or "globally stationary" but as "movable" and "stationary" in the same reference coordinate system. Thus, stationary parts may be mounted on movable elements, e.g., on the movable structure comprised in an installation according to the invention.<br>
Preferably at least one generator and more preferably all of the generators are connected to at least one AC/DC to DC converter for converting current<br><br>
supplied by.the generator into direct current, so as to supply direct current to one or more of the power consuming parts of the filling assembly.

In such a power transmission system which per se is known from the prior art, the stationary and the movable parts of the generator are arranged with a gap therebetween, so that there is no physical contact between the stationary structure and the movable structure while power is being generated or transmitted.<br>
As an alternative to the generator described above, the one or more of the movable parts of the generator may be mounted rotatably around one or more of the stationary parts, the parts of the generator comprising at least one coil and at least one magnetic member. Preferably both the movable and the stationary parts of the generator being mounted on the movable structure.<br>
The movable structure may comprise a running wheel for running along the stationary structure and being pressed against the stationary structure, e.g., by a spring. The running wheel may be mechanically connected to the rotatably mounted parts of the generator, so that the running wheel is capable of driving<br><br>
he rotatably mounted parts of the generator due to friction between the unning wheel and the stationary structure. The generator may comprise a wo-, three- or multipolar dynamo.<br>
The below description relates to both aspects of the present invention, except vhere the contrary is pointed out explicitly.<br>

Preferably at least some and more preferably all of the power consuming parts of at least some of the filling assemblies and preferably all of the filling assemblies are intrinsically safe. This implies that electrical circuits of the power consuming parts are intrinsically safe.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Fig. 1-3 are perspective views of an installation according to the invention. The installation comprises one or more carrousels or turntables 1 on which containers 2 are conveyed while being filled with liquified gas. The carrousels are arranged on'a stationary structure 1a. Empty or nearly empty containers are brought to the installation by, e.g., a truck from which they are transferred to a conveyor 4. Each filling carrousel 1 comprises a number of filling assemblies 5 on which the containers 2 are being filled with liquified gas.<br>
The containers 2 may be handled in a semiautomatic way where operators 6 cooperate with automatic conveyor or handling means, or in a fully automatic way.<br>
Figs. 4 and 5 show a filling assembly 5. The filling assembly 5 comprises a platform 7 on which the container 2 is positioned during the process of filling liquified gas into the container. An electronic scales for weighing the container 2 is comprised in the platform 7. The filling assembly 5 further comprises a filling head 8 comprising a valve for regulating the flow rate of liquified gas into the container. The filling head 8 is connected to a storage tank for storing liquified gas through a pipe 9. The electronic scales comprised in the platform 7 is electronically connected to a control system which is capable of opening and closing the valve comprised in the filling head 8, so as to, e.g., close the valve when the container 2 and the liquified gas comprised therein has reached a desired or pre-set weight.<br>
Fig. 6 is a diagrammatic illustration of the power supply system of a prior art installation. The installation is supplied with alternating current or with direct<br><br>
current, the power supply being indicated by reference signs Cin. The power supply Cin may be 11 5 or 230 V AC or 24 V DC. The supplied power is led through a power supply unit comprising an AC/DC to DC converter S1 which is preferably embedded in an MEXQ" housing as described above. A number of filling assemblies S2 are supplied with direct current from a number of power supply units S1, whereby a power supply unit S1 is associated to each filling assembly S2. The filling assemblies S2 are provided with scales Wl, W2, ..., Wn for weighing containers. Usually, a prior art system as illustrated in Fig. 6 is provided with 20-50 filling assemblies S2 each comprising a scales. Normally, any electrical part of each filling assembly S2 is intrinsically safe as described above.<br>
Fig. 7 is an illustration of a power distribution network of an installation according to a first aspect of the invention. All high voltage power units are positioned in a non-explosive environment (non-hazardous area). To considerable reduce the risk of creating sparks and/or causing ignition only low voltage units are positioned in the highly explosive environment (hazardous area). The installation is supplied with alternating current or direct current, preferably 11 5 or 230 V AC or 24 V DC or 12 V DC. In case where the voltage of the supplied power exceeds approximately 12V DC, the voltage is converted to 12 V DC using DC to DC converters.<br>
A number of filling assemblies UFM are supplied with direct current from the converters (power supplies). Each filling assembly UFM is provided with a scales for weighing containers. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the installation is provided with 24 filling assemblies UFM each comprising a scales. Compared to the prior art installation of Fig. 6, the installation of Fig. 7 has the particular advantage that all high voltage units are positioned outside the highly explosive area (hazardous area). Accordingly, the need for "EXQ" housings is eliminated since the power distribution network in the highly explosive area is a pure low-voltage network.<br><br>
The power supply systems illustrated in Figs. 6 and 7 may, e.g., be comprised in the installations shown in Figs. 1-3. The filling assemblies, denoted S2 in Fig. 6,and UFM in Fig. 7, may be of the type shown in Figs. 4 and 5.<br>
Fig. 7 also shows means for identifying container INLET at the entry of the installation. Further, means for testing (OUTLET WITH CHECK SCALE and LEAKTESTER) are also shown in Fig. 7. Even further, Fig. 7 shows a communication and power separator and electronic control means PC.<br>
Fig. 8 is a sketch of a detail of a generator 17 for supplying current to power consuming parts comprised in an installation according to a second aspect of the invention.<br>
The generator 17 comprises a stationary primary coil or wire 10 extending along an E-shaped track or profile 1 3 comprised in the stationary structure 1 a (cf. Figs. 1-3) and extending along the carrousel 1. The primary coil or conductor 10 co-operates with the stationary profile 13 which is preferably a ferrite profile. The movable parts of the generator 17 comprise a secondary coil 11 arranged on each filling assembly 5, the coil 11 being wound around an U-shaped profile 14 extending along the filling assembly or part thereof. The E-shaped profile 13 and the U-shaped profile 14 are arranged with a gap therebetween, so that there is no physical contact betwe'en the stationary parts and the movable parts of the generator 17. The induced current is led through a cable 12 to one or more power consuming parts comprised in the filling assembly 5 or to a charger charging an accumulator.<br><br><br>
