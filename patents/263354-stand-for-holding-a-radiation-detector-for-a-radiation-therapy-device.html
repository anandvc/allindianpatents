				<td>STAND FOR HOLDING A RADIATION DETECTOR FOR A RADIATION THERAPY<br>
DEVICE<br>
Description<br>
A stand for holding a radiation detector for a radiation<br>
therapy device, as well as a radiation therapy device having a<br>
stand for holding a radiation detector.<br>
The invention relates to a stand for holding a radiation<br>
detector for a radiation therapy device and a radiation therapy<br>
device having a stand for holding a radiation detector.<br>
Radiation therapy devices are used in medicine in order to<br>
treat diseased tissue, for example tumor tissue, with ionizing<br>
radiation. During radiation therapy such as this, radiation for<br>
example in the form of high-energy X-ray radiation, in the form<br>
of radiation composed of lightweight particles such as<br>
electrons or positrons, or in the form of radiation composed of<br>
heavy particles such as protons or ions is used. During<br>
radiation therapy, it is of critical importance that it is only<br>
the diseased tissue which is specifically bombarded, while the<br>
surrounding, healthy tissue is very largely not irradiated.<br>
In order to allow only the diseased tissue to be irradiated,<br>
the respective treatment area must be positioned as exactly as<br>
possible relative to the radiation therapy device, and the<br>
radiation must be aligned and delineated as exactly as possible<br>
with respect to the irradiation area. It is known for a<br>
radiation detector which uses the therapeutic radiation to<br>
produce an image of the irradiation area, or else of its<br>
surrounding area, to be used for positioning of the treatment<br>
area and for alignment and delineation of the therapeutic<br>
radiation. This has the disadvantage that, because of its high<br>
quantum energy, the therapeutic radiation is scattered to a<br>
greater extent about the treatment area and the tissue<br><br>
surrounding this treatment area than diagnostic radiation,<br>
whose quantum energy is lower, so<br><br>
that this type of imaging has comparatively low contrast.<br>
Diagnostic X-ray radiation typically has a maximum quantum<br>
energy of 150 kiloelectron volts (KeV) while, in contrast,<br>
therapeutic X-ray radiation typically has a quantum energy in<br>
the region of a megaelectron volt (MeV).<br>
It is known from US 6 888 919 B2 for an additional, diagnostic<br>
X-ray imaging system to be used for exact positioning of the<br>
tumor, comprising an X-ray source for production of low-energy<br>
diagnostic X-ray radiation and a radiation detector for<br>
diagnostic imaging based on detection of the diagnostic X-ray<br>
radiation. Furthermore, US 6 888 919 B2 also discloses a<br>
radiation therapy device in which the therapeutic radiation<br>
source is arranged on a gantry which can be rotated around a<br>
horizontal axis in order to allow the therapeutic radiation to<br>
be aligned flexibly relative to the patient.<br>
In order to allow the diseased tissue of the patient to be<br>
treated to be positioned as freely as possible, it is necessary<br>
to design the gantry together with the components arranged on<br>
this gantry to be as compact as possible, and to ensure that<br>
the distance between the radiation head, which in addition to<br>
the therapeutic radiation source may also have at least one<br>
collimator for beamforming, to the isocenter of the radiation<br>
therapy device is as great as possible. Particularly in the<br>
case of radiation therapy devices with an additional diagnostic<br>
X-ray imaging system, the lack of space represents a major<br>
problem for the design configuration of the radiation therapy<br>
device.<br>
US 688 919 B2, cited above, discloses a radiation therapy<br>
device which, in addition to a first gantry which can be<br>
rotated about an axis and has a therapeutic radiation source,<br>
has a second gantry which can be rotated about the same axis<br>
and has a diagnostic radiation source on one side and a<br>
radiation detector<br><br>
for imaging on the other side. The radiation detector is, in<br>
particular, in the form of a multi-energy imaging unit which<br>
can produce an image both on the basis of the therapeutic<br>
radiation and on the basis of the diagnostic radiation. The<br>
diagnostic X-ray emitter may, in particular, be moved in and<br>
out. In order to produce an image based on the diagnostic X-ray<br>
radiation, the first gantry is pivoted with the therapeutic<br>
radiation source to the side with respect to the second gantry<br>
with the diagnostic radiation source, so that the diagnostic<br>
radiation source can be moved out. In order to treat the<br>
diseased tissue with the therapeutic radiation, the diagnostic<br>
X-ray radiation source is moved in, and the therapeutic X-ray<br>
radiation source together with the gantry is pivoted to the<br>
previous position of the moved-out, diagnostic X-ray radiation<br>
source. This results in a diagnostic image of the diseased<br>
tissue being produced first of all with the moved-out<br>
diagnostic X-ray radiation source, from a viewing angle which<br>
corresponds to the radiation direction of the subsequent<br>
radiation treatment using the therapeutic radiation source. The<br>
disadvantage of this radiation therapy device is that its<br>
design is complicated and that, because of the additional<br>
second gantry, the free space for positioning and alignment of<br>
the patient to be treated is restricted.<br>
A radiation detector system for a radiation therapy device is<br>
known from US 5 142 559. The radiation detector system<br>
comprises a rotating chassis on which a radiation detector is<br>
arranged via holding arms. The rotating chassis is arranged on<br>
a mounting tower such that it can be moved in the vertical<br>
direction. The holding arms together with the radiation<br>
detector are mounted on the rotating chassis such that they can<br>
rotate about a horizontal axis.<br>
WO 2004/004829 A1 discloses an irradiation system with a<br>
radiation detector which can be pivoted out for maintenance<br>
purposes. A patient can be positioned between a radiation<br><br>
source on one side and the detector on the other side, for<br>
therapy purposes.<br>
WO 2005/015125 A1 discloses a system for calibration of source<br>
and detector instruments for which, by way of example, a<br>
radiation therapy apparatus is mentioned, having a detector<br>
whose alignment can be calibrated.<br>
WO 2004/033026 A2 discloses an imaging appliance for a<br>
radiation therapy device. The imaging appliance comprises a<br>
robot arm on which an imaging detector is arranged. In one<br>
exemplary embodiment, the robot arm has two parallel pivoting<br>
axes, and is mounted such that it can be moved parallel to<br>
these axes on a gantry of the radiation therapy device. The<br>
detector surface, which is arranged parallel to the movement<br>
direction in each pivoting position, can be aligned with an<br>
image radiation source and with a target volume by means of<br>
this robot arm.<br>
The present invention is based on the object of integrating a<br>
radiation detector in a space-saving manner in a radiation<br>
therapy device.<br>
This object is achieved by a stand as claimed in patent claim 1<br>
and by a radiation therapy device as claimed in patent<br>
claim 16; advantageous refinements are the subject matter of<br>
the dependent claims which respectively refer back to them.<br>
The embodiment of the stand according to the invention with<br>
only three parts in order to hold a radiation detector with<br><br>
the capability to move in a lifting direction as a first<br>
mechanical degree of freedom and with the capability to pivot<br>
about a pivoting axis essentially parallel to the lifting<br>
direction as a second mechanical degree of freedom allows the<br>
radiation detector to be positioned in a space-saving manner. The<br>
design configuration in just three parts and with only two<br>
mechanical degrees of freedom on the one hand allows the stand to<br>
be designed to be particularly compact while on the other hand<br>
nevertheless allowing the radiation detector to be positioned<br>
flexibly. Furthermore, this design of the stand ensures, in a<br>
simple manner, a high degree of mechanical stability and a<br>
particularly exact positioning capability, because of the small<br>
amount of mechanical play iin the degrees of freedom.<br>
Designing the mount part and/or the intermediate part with at<br>
least one lifting rail for guidance of the intermediate part which<br>
can be moved relative to the mount part results in the stand being<br>
particularly highly robust with particularly exact movement<br>
guidance, free of mechanical play, during movement of the<br>
intermediate part in the lifting direction.<br>
An embodiment of the mount part and/or of the intermediate part<br>
with a lifting drive rod which is powered by external power in<br>
order to move of the intermediate part allows a simple drive for<br>
this movement along the lifting direction. In particular, a motor<br>
is arranged on the mount part and/or the intermediate part in<br>
order to move the intermediate part relative to the mount part by<br>
external power.<br>
In a direct reversal of the mechanical principle, the drive rod<br>
and/or the lifting rail may be arranged both on the mount part<br>
and on the intermediate part.<br>
Designing the intermediate part and/or the arm part such that<br>
the arm part can be pivoted powered by external power relative<br>
to the<br><br>
intermediate part allows the pivoting movement to be controlled<br>
easily. In particular, a motor is arranged<br><br>
either on the intermediate part or on the arm part for pivoting<br>
by external power.<br>
Designing the arm part with the holding apparatus for holding<br>
the radiation detector such that the holding apparatus is<br>
arranged such that it can be moved relative to the arm part in<br>
a movement direction essentially at right angles to the lifting<br>
direction of the intermediate part of the stand makes it<br>
possible to flexibly vary the respective viewing angle during<br>
production of an image with the radiation detector; this<br>
requirement is particularly advantageous for production of a<br>
three-dimensional image of the tissue to be treated, based on<br>
the production of a plurality of images from different viewing<br>
angles.<br>
Designing the arm part with at least one holding rail for<br>
guidance of the holding apparatus results in the radiation<br>
detector being held in a particularly robust manner with little<br>
mechanical play while it is being moved along the movement<br>
direction. The same advantage is likewise achieved by a direct<br>
reversal of the mechanical principle in the form of an<br>
embodiment of the holding apparatus for an interlocking<br>
arrangement on at least one holding rail of the radiation<br>
detector.<br>
An embodiment of the arm part with a drive belt powered by<br>
external power or a drive chain powered by external power for<br>
movement of the holding apparatus ensures a simple drive during<br>
movement of the holding apparatus for the radiation detector<br>
along the movement direction. The drive belt or the drive chain<br>
can, in particular, be driven by a motor which can be arranged<br>
on the holding part.<br>
Designing the arm part with a movement drive rod which is<br>
powered by external power for movement of the holding apparatus<br>
and/or for movement of the radiation detector allows a simple<br><br>
drive for this linear movement along the movement direction. In<br>
particular, a motor<br><br>
is arranged on the arm part for externally powered movement of<br>
the holding apparatus and of the radiation detector relative to<br>
the arm part. It is feasible for the movement drive rod to have<br>
a gearwheel which engages in an interlocking manner in a<br>
toothed rail on the holding apparatus or on the radiation<br>
detector.<br>
Designing the mount part for arrangement on a gantry of a<br>
radiation therapy device with a first radiation source for<br>
production of first radiation which can be emitted in a first<br>
radiation direction makes it possible to use the stand in a<br>
radiation therapy device. For example, it is also possible to<br>
retrofit an existing radiation therapy device with a stand such<br>
as this for holding the radiation detector. The abovementioned<br>
lifting direction is, in particular, essentially parallel to<br>
the first radiation direction. By way of example, the first<br>
radiation source may be a therapeutic radiation source for the<br>
production of X-ray radiation in the MeV energy range, of<br>
electron radiation or proton radiation.<br>
An embodiment of the stand such that the radiation detector<br>
which can be held on the holding apparatus, can be pivoted<br>
and/or moved to at least one examination position within the<br>
radiation area of the first radiation source makes it possible<br>
to produce a diagnostic record of the body tissue located<br>
within a target volume of the radiation therapy device from a<br>
viewing angle that corresponds essentially to the perspective<br>
of the first radiation source. This allows the diseased body<br>
tissue to be treated to be positioned particularly accurately<br>
in the target volume.<br>
In its examination position, it is possible for the radiation<br>
detector to be effectively located in front of the first<br>
radiation source in the first radiation direction and to be<br>
located together with it on the same side relative to the<br><br>
target volume. In this case, it is expedient for a second<br>
radiation source<br><br>
to be arranged on the opposite side relative to the target<br>
volume, emitting second radiation through the target volume in<br>
the direction of the radiation detector. In this case, in<br>
particular, it is feasible for the first radiation source to<br>
produce high-energy therapeutic radiation, while the second<br>
radiation source produces low-energy diagnostic radiation.<br>
According to a further refinement, a stand design is provided<br>
such that the radiation detector can be moved to different<br>
examination positions within the radiation area of the first<br>
radiation source, in each case at different distances from the<br>
first radiation source; this allows flexible replacement or<br>
combination of different beamforming elements, which can be<br>
arranged between the first radiation source on the one side and<br>
the radiation detector on the other side.<br>
An embodiment of the stand such that the radiation detector<br>
which can be arranged on the holding apparatus can be pivoted<br>
out of the radiation area of the first radiation source makes<br>
it possible for the radiation detector to be removed from the<br>
radiation area in a simple manner, for example in order to<br>
carry out a radiation-therapy treatment using the first<br>
radiation source.<br>
An embodiment of the stand such that the radiation detector can<br>
be moved, outside the radiation area of the first radiation<br>
source, to a parked position which is offset with respect to<br>
the examination position in the opposite direction to the first<br>
radiation direction allows particularly space-saving<br>
positioning of the first radiation source. This parked<br>
position, which is moved in in comparison to the examination<br>
position, and in which the first radiation source is further<br>
away from the target volume, creates a particularly large<br>
amount of free space for positioning of the respective patient<br>
to be treated.<br><br>
An embodiment of the stand such that the radiation detector,<br>
when in its parked position, can be positioned alongside the<br>
first radiation source essentially at right angles to the first<br>
radiation direction in a lateral direction results in a<br>
particularly space-saving and physically simple arrangement.<br>
The radiation therapy device according to the invention with a<br>
gantry on which not only the first radiation source but also<br>
the stand for holding the radiation detector are arranged on<br>
the one hand makes it possible to produce an image of the<br>
respective target volume from the viewing angle of the first<br>
radiation source from an examination position of the radiation<br>
detector within the radiation area of the first radiation<br>
source, and on the other hand a particularly space-saving<br>
positioning of the radiation detector in a parked position,<br>
which is offset with respect to the examination position in the<br>
opposite direction to the first radiation direction, outside<br>
the radiation area.<br>
Since the radiation detector can be designed to be considerably<br>
narrower than a radiation source and can effectively be<br>
positioned in front of the first radiation source in the first<br>
radiation direction, there is no need to pivot the first radiation<br>
source away, which would be complex, in order to produce a<br>
diagnostic image of the target volume, as in US 6 888 919 B2.<br>
According to a further refinement, the first radiation source is<br>
designed to produce the first radiation in the form of therapeutic<br>
radiation, in particular therapeutic X-ray radiation.<br>
A particularly large amount of space can be saved by arranging<br>
both the first radiation source and the radiation detector in each<br>
case on the same side relative to the target volume, which can be<br>
irradiated with the first radiation, in their examination<br><br>
position.<br>
A second radiation source which is arranged on a side opposite<br>
the radiation detector relative<br><br>
to the target volume makes it possible to use the radiation<br>
detector to produce an image of the tissue located in the<br>
target volume and of the tissue located in an area surrounding<br>
the target volume. This refinement is particularly expedient<br>
when the radiation source which is arranged on the same side<br>
relative to the target volume can produce only therapeutic<br>
radiation.<br>
For example, it is feasible for both the stand for holding the<br>
radiation detector and the first radiation source for producing<br>
the therapeutic radiation to be located at one end of the<br>
gantry, and for the second radiation source for producing<br>
diagnostic X-ray radiation to be located on the other side of<br>
the gantry. Particularly in a situation such as this, it is<br>
expedient to design the stand such that, when the radiation<br>
detector is in its examination position, it is aligned to<br>
detect second radiation emitted from the second radiation<br>
source in the direction of the radiation detector in the<br>
examination position.<br>
In order to allow the viewing angle to be varied flexibly<br>
during production of the diagnostic image, the stand is<br>
designed such that the holding apparatus is arranged such that<br>
it can be moved relative to it in a movement direction<br>
essentially at right angles to the first radiation direction.<br>
Inter alia, this refinement makes it possible to produce a<br>
three-dimensional image of the target volume and of the tissue<br>
located in the area surrounding this target volume, by<br>
producing a plurality of images from different viewing angles.<br>
The second radiation source is expediently arranged such that<br>
it can be pivoted about an axis at right angles to the first<br>
radiation direction and at right angles to the movement<br>
direction. In order to produce images from different viewing<br>
angles, the second radiation source is pivoted in synchronism<br>
with the linear movement of the holding apparatus for the<br>
radiation detector, such that the<br><br>
second radiation strikes the radiation detector throughout the<br>
entire irradiation time.<br><br>
The second radiation source is expediently designed to produce<br>
the second radiation in the form of diagnostic radiation, in<br>
particular diagnostic X-ray radiation.<br>
According to a further refinement, the radiation detector is<br>
designed to detect the first radiation passing through the<br>
radiation detector; when in the examination position, this<br>
makes it possible to use the radiation detector to measure on<br>
the one hand the radiation area and on the other hand the<br>
intensity of the first radiation emitted from the first<br>
radiation source. Furthermore, any attenuation of the first X-<br>
ray radiation produced by the patient who is in each case to be<br>
treated can be measured in combination with the second<br>
radiation detector on the side of the target volume opposite<br>
that of the abovementioned radiation detector. This attenuation<br>
makes it possible to deduce the total radiation energy absorbed<br>
in the patient when irradiated with the first radiation.<br>
The invention as well as further advantageous refinements of<br>
the invention according to features of the dependent claims<br>
will be explained in more detail in the following text with<br>
reference to schematically illustrated exemplary embodiments in<br>
the drawing, without this implying that the invention is<br>
restricted to these exemplary embodiments. In the figures:<br>

detail in the figure description relating to Figure 3.<br>
The holding apparatus 6 for the radiation detector 2 is<br>
arranged on the arm part 5 such that it can move in a movement<br>
direction 9 which runs essentially at right angles to the<br>
lifting direction 7. The method of operation of the holding<br>
apparatuses 6 and the drive mechanism for the movement will be<br>
explained in more detail in the figure description relating to<br>
Figures 3 and 4.<br>
In Figure 1, the stand 1 is set such that the radiation<br>
detector 2 is arranged in its examination position in which it<br>
is located with a first radiation source in its intended<br>
radiation area, with the stand 1 being arranged with the<br>
radiation detector 2 on a radiation therapy device. In this<br>
case, the intended radiation direction 29 is aligned parallel<br>
to the lifting direction 7, and points downward in Figure 1.<br><br>
Figure 2 shows a perspective illustration of the stand shown in<br>
Figure 1, with the radiation detector 2 having been positioned<br>
by means of a pivoting movement of the arm part through 90° in<br>
the counterclockwise direction with respect to a plan view of<br>
the pivoting axis 8, and a lifting movement of the intermediate<br>
part 4 as far as the upper end of the mount part 3 to a parked<br>
position outside the intended radiation area.<br>
Figure 3 shows a detailed enlargement of a perspective<br>
illustration of the stand 1 as shown in Figure 1 from the rear,<br>
with a housing cover, at the rear of the arm part 5 having been<br>
removed.<br>
A drive motor 14 is arranged in the arm part 5 and allows a<br>
motor-powered pivoting movement of the arm part 5 relative to<br>
the intermediate part 4 by means of power being transmitted to<br>
the intermediate part 4 through a direction-changing<br>
transmission 17.<br>
Furthermore, the arm part 5 has a further motor 15 which drives<br>
the linear movement of the radiation detector 2 via a third<br>
direction-changing transmission 18 and via a movement drive rod<br>
20.<br>
Figure 4 shows a further detailed enlargement of the arm part<br>
as shown in Figure 3, with the housing of the arm part not<br>
being illustrated. In addition to the motor 15, the direction-<br>
changing transmission 18 and the movement drive rod 20, a<br>
gearwheel 21 can be seen which is arranged coaxially on this<br>
movement drive rod 20 and engages in an interlocking manner in<br>
a toothed drive rail 22 of the radiation detector 2. The<br>
interlock between the gearwheel 21, which is driven indirectly<br>
by the motor 15, and the drive rail 22 converts a rotary<br>
movement of the motor 15, which is arranged in a fixed position<br>
relative to the housing of the arm part 5, to a linear movement<br>
of the radiation detector 2.<br><br>
Furthermore, Figure 4 shows the holding apparatuses 6 which are<br>
attached to the outside of the housing of the arm part 5, and<br><br>
which surround the holding rail 19 in an interlocking manner.<br>
Figure 5 shows a detailed enlargement of a perspective<br>
illustration of a further exemplary embodiment of the stand 1<br>
shown in Figure 1 from the rear, with a drive mechanism, which<br>
has been modified in comparison to the previously described<br>
exemplary embodiment, for linear movement of the radiation<br>
detector. As in Figure 3, the rear housing cover of the arm<br>
part 5 has been removed in order to show the drive mechanism.<br>
The arm part 5 has a motor 15 which drives the linear movement<br>
of the radiation detector 2 via the third direction-changing<br>
transmission 18 and via a drive belt 23 which is passed over a<br>
guide roller 21 and is connected at one end to the holding<br>
apparatus 6 for the radiation detector 2.<br>
Figure 6 shows a perspective illustration of the arm part 5<br>
according to the exemplary embodiment illustrated in Figure 5,<br>
tilted slightly forwards. The arm part 5 has a holding rail 19<br>
for guidance of the holding apparatus 6 relative to the arm<br>
part 5, with only two rail holders 25 of the holding apparatus<br>
6 being illustrated, which surround the holding rail in an<br>
interlocking manner from two opposite sides. In order to allow<br>
the holding rail 19 and the rail holders 25 to be seen better,<br>
this figure does not show the majority of the holding apparatus<br>
or of the radiation detector.<br>
Figure 7 shows a side view of a radiation therapy device 2 6<br>
having a gantry 27 which is arranged on a base stand 32 such<br>
that it can rotate about a vertical rotation axis 33, having a<br>
first radiation source 28 arranged on the gantry 27 and having<br>
the stand 1, arranged on the gantry 27, with the radiation<br>
detector 2 for the examination shown in Figure 1. The first<br>
radiation source 28 can emit the first radiation<br><br>
examination area which surrounds this target volume 35 can be<br>
produced. This X-ray image can be used not only to position and<br>
to align a patient to be treated relative to the target volume<br>
35, but also to constrain the radiation area 30 by means of a<br>
shutter.<br>
The radiation detector 2 can be moved by the stand 1 in a<br>
movement direction 9 which runs at right angles to the plane of<br>
the illustration in this figure. In synchronism with this<br>
linear movement, the second radiation detector 36 can be tilted<br>
about a tilt axis 39 at right angles to the first radiation<br>
direction 29 and at right angles to the movement direction 9,<br>
so that the second radiation which can be emitted from the<br>
second X-ray source 36 strikes the radiation detector 2 during<br>
its linear movement; this means that the X-ray image, which is<br>
initially only two-dimensional can be used to obtain<br>
information at right angles to the radiation direction 29, as<br>
well, over the examination area, relating to the three-<br>
dimensional tissue arrangement in the radiation direction 29.<br>
This is done just by two X-ray images with different imaging<br>
perspectives. After the at least one X-ray image has been<br>
recorded, the second radiation source 36 can be moved in a<br>
vertical direction 38 with respect to the gantry 27.<br>
A further radiation detector 37 is arranged on the side<br>
opposite the radiation detector 2 relative to the target volume<br>
35 and is designed to produce an X-ray image of the target<br>
volume 35 and/or of the examination area surrounding this<br>
target volume 35, based on the high-energy, first radiation.<br>
Any attenuation of the first radiation resulting from the<br>
patient, who is positioned, at least partially, in the target<br>
volume 35, can be determined by a development of the radiation<br>
detector 2, which is arranged underneath the first radiation<br>
source 28, in such a way that this is also suitable for<br>
detection of the high-energy first radiation, in combination<br>
with the further radiation detector 36 on the opposite side of<br><br>
the target volume 36. In addition to the second radiation<br>
source 36, the further<br><br>
radiation detector 38 can also be moved in in the vertical<br>
direction 38 with respect to the gantry 27.<br>
Figure 8 shows a side view of the radiation therapy device 26<br>
shown in Figure 7, with the radiation detector 2 in its parked<br>
position shown in Figure 2, which is offset with respect to the<br>
examination position in the opposite direction to the first<br>
radiation direction 29, outside the radiation area of the first<br>
radiation source. In this parked position, the radiation<br>
detector is positioned alongside the first radiation source 28<br>
in a lateral direction at right angles to the first radiation<br>
direction 29.<br>
It is also possible to provide the gantry 27 with cladding,<br>
which is not illustrated in Figures 7 and 8, within which the<br>
radiation detector 2 is positioned, in its parked position,<br>
such that it cannot be seen from the outside.<br>
Fundamentally, one embodiment may be summarized as follows: in<br>
order to integrate a radiation detector in a space-saving<br>
manner in a radiation therapy device, at least one stand is<br>
provided for holding the radiation detector, in particular such<br>
that it can be moved in the lifting direction and can be<br>
pivoted about a pivoting axis; the radiation therapy device<br>
according to this embodiment comprises a gantry, a first<br>
radiation source and the stand, by means of which the radiation<br>
detector can be moved on the one hand to at least one<br>
examination position within the radiation area of the first<br>
radiation source, and on the other hand to a parked position,<br>
which is moved in in the opposite direction to a first<br>
radiation direction from the first radiation source in<br>
comparison to the examination position, outside the radiation<br>
area.<br><br>
