				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to cashew nut shelter.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Shelling of roasted cashew nut is conventionally accomplished by<br>
cracking the nut along its longitudinal axis in manual hand beating<br>
method to release the edible kernel. The irregular shape of the cashew<br>
nut and the brittleness of the kernel inside the rather hard shell make<br>
the shelling process complicated and results in breakage of kernels<br>
leading to reduction of market price and acceptability for export. The<br>
cashew nut shell liquid (CNSL), present over the cashew nut shell surface<br>
causes a blistering effect on human skin and more over the conventional<br>
method hardly meets the quality control standards for shelling of cashew<br>
nuts.<br>
Reference can be made to Ohler, 1979 (Ohler, J. G. Cashew<br>
Communication 71, Deptt. Of Agril, Res., Royal Tropical Institute,<br>
Armsterdam, 1979, 18-49, 65; 201-207) wherein a manually operated<br>
device has been reported where there are two nut shaped blades between<br>
which the nut<br><br>
is held. The blades cut into the shell to a per-determined depth. One of<br>
the blades is twisted to separate the shell halves to complete shelling.<br>
The drawbacks arc that the method is a non-continuous one and needs<br>
enough skill because the nut is to be hand-held in between two blades<br>
making it prone to accident.<br>
Further, reference can be made to Thivavarnvor, 1989 (Thivavarnvong T.<br>
The Desing Synthesis of a Semi-automatic Cashew Nut Shells: ASAE<br>
Paper 1089-6615, 1989) wherein a semi-automatic version of the blade<br>
system has been proposed which relies on hand feeding of a circular<br>
plate conveyor which takes each nut in turn into the path of a cam<br>
operated blade. The drawbacks are that this method is labour intensive<br>
and the throughput is limited to 45 nuts/min for two people and one<br>
machine.<br>
Yet further, reference can be made to Russel. 1960 (Russel D.C. Cashew<br>
Nut Processing, Agricultural Services Bulletin 6, Agricultural Service:<br>
Division F.A.O , Rome 1969 21-50) wherein the principle of shelling is<br><br>
throwing the roasted cashew nuts at a target plate by means of a<br>
centrifuge. The drawbacks are that a significant proportion of the nuts<br>
may remain unshelied and the process often results in a high percentage<br>
of broken kernels (up to 30%).<br>
Reference may be made to Jain and Kumar, 1997 (Jain, R.K. &amp; Kumar,<br>
and S. Development of a power operated cashew nut sheller Journal of<br>
Food Engineering) wherein a power operated cashew nut sheller based on<br>
the principle of compression and shear. The drawbacks are that the<br>
shelling efficiency is only 70% and yield in terms of whole, half, split and<br>
broken is 50%, 22% and 28% respectively.<br>
Reference may be made to U.S Patent 4612854 (Henry J.Chiro, 1986)<br>
wherein a nutcracker having a horizontal base and a horizontal lower<br>
cracking plate removing removable positioned on the base. An upper<br>
cracking plate is horizontally disposed above the lower cracking plate<br>
and slidably engaged on a upper frame allowing vertical horizontal<br>
movement of the upper cracking plate relative to the base. The<br><br>
drawbacks are that the shelter may only be suitable for spherical nuts<br>
not for the irregular shaped nuts as in case of cashew nut.<br>
Reference may be made to LT.S .Patent 641430 (Han, Marlin D.nut<br>
Splitter 1987) wherein a nut splitter has been developed for macalamia<br>
nuts utilizing a disk like cutting element for splitting the nutshell. The<br>
drawbacks are that the splitter is suitable for spherical macadamia nuts,<br>
may not be useful for irregular shaped cashew nuts.<br>
Reference may be made to U.S Patent 4044663 (Straw, Jesse Harold, Nut<br>
Shelter, 1977) wherein a nut shelter has been developed on the principle<br>
of applying an impact upon the nut once suitably positioned by a nut<br>
holder. The drawbacks are that in case of cashew nut the impact is to be<br>
applied along the longitudinal axis at 2 to 3 spots making it sure that the<br>
shell cracks fully and the kernel is released<br>
Based on the prior art details and drawbacks thereof as mentioned the<br>
necessity getting a suitable device for cashew nut shelling very much<br>
exists. The irregular shape of the cashew nut and brittleness of the<br><br>
kernel inside the rather hard shell are the major points of concern<br>
considering the invention of a cashew nut sheller. The thickness of the<br>
cashew nut shell around the kernel also varies and needs special<br>
attention. During shelling adequate care should be taken to release the<br>
whole kernel that ensures the cost factor and ultimately benefit to the<br>
cashew nut processor as well as the cashew nut growers. The presence of<br>
CNSL on the shell surface which causes blistering effect on human skin<br>
needs to be looked after to assure quality control aspects.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a Cashew nut<br>
sheller, which obviates the drawbacks of prior art.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a mean for applying<br>
impulse along the natural line of cleavage of the nut on the concave<br>
surface for rapture of the nutshell, which is made brittle during the<br>
roasting operation.<br><br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a mean for holding<br>
the nut for giving necessary support during application of impulse force one the nut.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a seven numbers of<br>
adjustable chisel shaped pins, which would penetrate the nut along the<br>
contour of the concave surface when the nut is placed along the<br>
longitudinal axis.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide chisel shaped pins<br>
for rupture and conical shaped pins for holding the nut during the<br>
application of impulse force.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a mean for applying<br>
the tensile force by means of necessary links which would result in<br>
opening of the outer sale of the outer sale to release the whole edible<br>
kernel with testa intact.<br><br>

DESCRITPION OF THE INVENTION WITH REFERENCE TO<br>
ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Based on the principle of impulse and tension, the cashew nut sheller<br>
has been developed wherein nuts are placed on a bottom holding<br>
assembly one by one and are subjected to a impulse force by a top<br>
shelling assembly. The top shelling assembly comprises of for example<br>
seven numbers chisel shaped adjustable pins mounted on a curved plate<br>
while the bottom holding assembly has for example five adjustable<br>
conical shaped pointed pins, mounted on a flat plate and both the<br>
assemblies has half lap joints.<br>
The impulse force through the top shelling assembly is effected through<br>
the downward movement of the pedal with adequate force such that the<br>
pins mounted on it, penetrate to the desired depth on the longitudinal<br>
axis causing a rupture along the natural line of cleavage of the nut. The<br>
top shelling assembly and bottom holding assembly are linked through a<br><br>
suitable locking mechanism such that half of top and bottom pins move<br>
to right side resulting in spitting of the shell and release of the whole<br>
kernel. On the main frame the pedal operating unit is linked to the top<br>
and bottom assemblies with suitable hinge arrangements such that the<br>
impulse and tensile force are effected simultaneously resulting in the<br>
completion of the shelling process. The pins on top and bottom are<br>
mounted such that their depth of penetration can be adjusted as per the<br>
shell thickness at each point under load.<br>
Reference is made to fig 1-4. The "LP shaped pedal operating assembly(2)<br>
is attached to the main frame (1) on its two rear legs by swinging type<br>
hitches (9). The pedal pipe is rigidly fixed to the right side bar and is<br>
attached in parallel to the left side bar with two nuts and bolts. The left<br>
side bar through an<br>
"L" type link (10) is hinged to a spring loaded actuating assembly (5). The<br>
top shelling assembly (3) is attached through a hinge (11) on its left arm<br>
to the spring loaded actuating assembly which comprises of two coaxial<br>
pipes(12) fitted one over the other and three nos. of compression<br><br>
springs(13) separated by bushwasher type locks(14). The spring loaded<br>
actuating assembly is further supported by a bush type guide (15) and<br>
attached to a horizontal support (16) on the main frame. This<br>
arrangement makes the top shelling assembly to move down when the<br>
pedal is pressed down. The top shelling assembly is hinged to the main<br>
frame by two support blocks and bushes(17). It has got two parallel<br>
round bars (18) and two square bars (19) fitted perpendicular to each<br>
other on which the shelling unit (7) has been fitted. The left hand side<br>
bar is rigidly fixed while the right hand side bar is movable and gets<br>
interlocked to a spring loaded sliding assembly (6) as the top shelling<br>
assembly moves down. The shelling unit comprises of two halves of<br>
curved metal plates(20) interlocked by a half-lap joint and has/seven nos.<br>
chisel shaped pins (21) mounted on the curved plates, which are<br>
adjustable. There are three pins on the left hand side and four pins on<br>
the right hand side of the shelling unit. The spring loaded sliding<br>
assembly (6) has got a spring (22) locked between two bushes (23) and is<br>
hinged at one end to a horizontal parallel pipe by a clamp (24) while the<br>
other end is attached to the bottom holding assembly. This assembly (4)<br>
has got two parallel square bars (25) just below the two parallel bars of<br>
the top shelling assembly of which the left side is fixed and the right side<br>
is movable on the main frame by the help of two bushes (26). The bottom<br><br>
springs(13) separated by bushwasher type locks(14). The spring loaded<br>
actuating assembly is further supported by a bush type guide (15) and<br>
attached to a horizontal support (16) on the main frame. This<br>
arrangement makes the top shelling assembly to move down when the<br>
pedal is pressed down. The top shelling assembly is hinged to the main<br>
frame by two support blocks and bushes(17). It has got two parallel<br>
round bars (18) and two square bars (19) fitted perpendicular to each<br>
other on which the shelling unit (7) has been fitted. The left hand side<br>
bar is rigidly fixed while the right hand side bar is movable and gets<br>
interlocked to a spring loaded sliding assembly (6) as the top shelling<br>
assembly moves down. The shelling unit comprises of two halves of<br>
curved metal plates(20) interlocked by a half-lap joint and has seven nos.<br>
chisel shaped pins (21) mounted on the curved plates, which are<br>
adjustable. There are three pins on the left hand side and four pins on<br>
the right hand side of the shelling unit. The spring loaded sliding<br>
assembly (6) has got a spring (22) locked between two bushes (23) and is<br>
hinged at one end to a horizontal parallel pipe by a clamp (24) while the<br>
other end is attached to the bottom holding assembly. This assembly (4)<br>
has got two parallel square bars (25) just below the two parallel bars of<br>
the top shelling assembly of which the left side is fixed and the right side<br>
is movable on the main frame by the help of two bushes (26). The bottom<br><br>
holding assembly has got two halves of flat metal plates (27) interlocked<br>
by a half-lap joint and has five nos. pointed shaped pins (28) which are<br>
also adjustable and positioned in between two inclined metal plate<br>
supports. Three are two pins on the left hand side and three pins on the<br>
right hand side of the holding assembly. The right side square bar of the<br>
bottom holding assembly is attached to two bushes for facilitating sliding<br>
movement i.e. one on the top shelling assembly while the other one is<br>
fitted to a shaft (37) on the main frame. On the left side square bar of the<br>
bottom holding assembly a fulcrum unit (8) is rigidly fixed which has got<br>
two arms (30) placed perpendicular to each other. One of these arms is<br>
attached to the horizontal parallel pipe (33) by a hinge (32) while the<br>
other is hinged (34) to a vertical pipe (34)(Fig 4). A bush type guide (35)<br>
fitted to the horizontal support of the main frame, supports this vertical<br>
pipe and has a platform (36). rigidly fixed at the bottom. When this<br>
platform is pressed down the sliding assembly moves to right by the<br>
action of the fulcrum and results in movement of the right side halve of<br>
the top shelling unit and bottom holding unit.<br><br>
The main advantages of the present invention are :-<br>
1.	That, the shelling of one roasted cashew nut is completed in one<br>
stroke of operation.<br>
2.	That, the whole kernel is released intact from the shell of the nut<br>
when shelling process is completed.<br>
3.	That, the height of the pins are adjusted before the start of shelling<br>
operation which ensures the desired depth of penetration in the<br>
shell without causing any damage to the kernel of the cashew nuts<br>
of the grade for which pins are already set.<br>
4.	That, the cashew nut is left alone being placed in longitudinal axis<br>
of the nut on the bottom holding assembly in between the two side<br>
supporting plates that ensures safety to the operator. Further more<br>
the CNSL contact with hand is avoided to a great extent.<br>
OPERATION OF THE INVENTION<br>
A cashew nut is placed on the bottom holding assembly in between two<br>
side supports along the longitudinal axis. The pedal is then pressed<br>
downwards, that brings the top shelling assembly down by the help of<br><br>
the spring loaded actuating assembly resulting in penetration of pins<br>
along the natural line of cleavage of the nut. Further movement of the<br>
pedal makes the platform of the vertical pipe move down resulting in the<br>
sliding assembly to move to right by the action of the fulcrum. By this<br>
time the right hand side halves of top shelling unit and bottom holding<br>
unit also move to right being interlocked which results in the splitting of<br>
the nut shell to two halves to release the whole intact kernel (Fig. 2).<br>
Then the pedal is released and the top shelling assembly and bottom<br>
holding assembly regain their position automatically by the action of the<br>
springs on the spring loaded actuating assembly and spring loaded<br>
sliding assembly. This way, by one stroke of operation one cashew nut is<br>
shelled when the top-shelling assembly and the spring loaded sliding<br>
assembly, respectively applies the impulse force and tensile force<br>
simultaneously. The next stroke of operation starts again with the<br>
placement of another cashew nut in between the side supports. The<br>
height of the pins on top shelling unit and bottom holding unit are<br>
adjusted as per the size of the cashew nut. For a particular grade of the<br>
cashew nut this arrangement can be fixed and can be changed when the<br><br>
grade is changed. The height of the main frame has been designed to<br>
facilitate the pedel operation in standing posture by an operator.<br>
It is to be noted that the present invention is susceptible to<br>
modifications, adaptations and changes by those skilled in the art. Such<br>
variant embodiments employing the concepts and features of this<br>
invention are intended to be within the scope of the present invention,<br>
which is further set forth under the following claims:-<br><br>
