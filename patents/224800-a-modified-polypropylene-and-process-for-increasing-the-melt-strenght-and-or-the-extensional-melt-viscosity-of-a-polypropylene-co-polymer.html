				<td>PROCESS<br>
FOR INCREASING THE MELT STRENGTH OF POLYPROPYLENE<br>
The present invention relates to polypropylene homopolymers and copolymers. In particular,<br>
the present invention relates to a process for increasing the melt strength and/or the<br>
extensional melt viscosity of said polymers by melt phase processing.<br>
The melt strength and extensional viscosity of linear or straight chain polymers, such as<br>
polypropylene, decreases rapidly with temperature. By contrast, polymers such as low<br>
density polyethylene which are highly branched retain relatively high melt strengths and<br>
extensional viscosities. It is generally understood that the difference In melt strengths and<br>
extensional viscosities is attributable to the presence of long chain branching in polymers such<br>
as low density polyethylene. Long chain branching allows a greater degree of chain<br>
entanglement.<br>
A number of methods for increasing the melt strength/extensional viscosity of polypropylene<br>
and related polymers through the introduction of branching or a limited degree of crosslinking<br>
in a process involving reactive extrusion have been proposed and are summarised in a recent<br>
paper by Wang et al. (Wang, X., Tzoganakis, C., and Rempel, G.L., J. Appl. Polym. Sci,<br>
1996, 61, 1395). One such process involves the reactive extrusion of polypropylene with a<br>
White (US 5578682) has disclosed the use of various polyunsamrated crosslinking agents (for<br>
example, bismeleimide derivatives) in combination with free radical initiators to achieve an<br>
increase in the melt strength various polymers.<br>
It is well known that the melt phase processing of polypropylene leads to mechanochemical<br>
degradation. The processing of polypropylene in the presence of free radical initiators<br>
SUBSTITUTE SHEET (Rule 26) (RO/AU)<br>
provides an increased rate of degradation. This controlled degradation of polypropylene is<br>
used commercially for the production of controlled rheology resins having reduced<br>
polydispersity and reduced die swell (Lambla, M. in Comprehensive Polymer Science,<br>
Pergamon, New York 1992, vol Suppl. 1, p 619; Hogt, A.H., Meijer, J., Jelinic, J. in<br>
Reactive Modifiers for Polymers, Al-Malaika, S Ed., Chapman &amp; Hall, London, 1996, p<br>
84.). The degradation of polypropylene as described therein results in a lowering of melt<br>
strength.<br>
The batch modification of polypropylene to produce crosslinked (insoluble) polypropylene<br>
by treatment with peroxides is described by Borsig et al. (Borsig, E., Fiedlerova, A., Lazar,<br>
M. J., Macromol. Sci. Chem. 1981, A16, 513). Initiators which produce benzoyloxy<br>
radicals or phenyl ladicals are described as being more efficient in inducing crosslinking or<br>
grafting than those which produce t-butoxy or alkyl radicals. The process requires the use<br>
of high levels of peroxide. The use of polyfunctional monomers as coagents to retard<br>
degradation and enhance crosslinking is described by Chodak, I.; Fabianova, K.; Borsig,<br>
E.; Lazar, M. Agnew. Makromol. Chem., 1978, 69, 107.<br>
DeNicola (EP 384; 31A2) has disclosed a means :o produce a branched propylene polymer<br>
material showing a net increase in the weight average molecular weight by solid state<br>
modification of predominantly isotactic semi-crystalline linear polypropylene. The process<br>
described in EP384331A2 involves blending peroxides with short half lives (eg peroxy<br>
dicarbonates) with linear propylene polymer in a mixing vessel at temperatures from 23°C<br>
to 120°C in an in;rt atmosphere and continuing to mix for a period of time until the<br>
peroxide decompos es and polymer fragmentation and branching occurs without significant<br>
gelation of the pclymer. DeNicola states that at temperatures greater than 120°C no<br>
branching or melt strength enhancement is achieved.<br>
U.S. 5,464,907 teathes that certain unsaturated itaconale derived peroxides may<br>
be used to induce grafting in polypropylene and a-olefm copolymers. They report that use<br>
of other peroxides generally results in chain degradation<br>
Polypropylene is also known to undergo substantial degradation during melt phase grafting<br>
of monofunctional monomers, for example maleic anhydride and glycidyl methacrylate. It<br>
has also been reported that the degradation that accompanies grafting of these monomers to<br>
polypropylene may be reduced by the addition of relatively high concentrations of certain<br>
comonomers including styrene (see, for example Sun, Y.J., Hu, G.-H., and Lambla, M.,<br>
Angew. Makromol. Chem. 1995, 229, 1; Chen, L-F., Wong, B. and Baker, W.E. Polym,<br>
Eng. Sci. 1996, 36, 1594.) Sun et al. report that there is degradation (as indicated by an<br>
overall decrease in molecular weight) when styrene alone is grafted onto polypropylene even<br>
when a relatively high concentration is used (4 moles/lOOg PP). Either 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-(t-<br>
butylperoxy)hex-3-yne or 2,5-dimethyl-2,5(t-butylpcroxy-hexane(DHBP) was used as the<br>
initiator in these experiments.<br>
We have found that melt mixing polypropylene homopolymer or ethylene-polypropylene<br>
copolymer in the presence of a suitable initiator provides one or more of the following:<br>
increased melt strength; increased extensional viscosity; increased molecular weight; and<br>
broadened molecular weight distribution.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a process for modifying a polypropylene<br>
(co)polymer wherein said process comprises melt mixing the polypropylene (co)polymer in<br>
the presence of an initiator wherein said initiator is selected from the group defined by<br>
formula 1:<br>
Formula 1<br>
wherein R is selected from the group consisting of optionally substituted C, to Qg acyl,<br>
optionally substituted-C1 to C18 alkyl, aroyl defined by formula 2,<br>
Formula 2<br>
and groups of formula 3,<br>
wherein U, V, X, Y, Z, U' V, X', Y' and Z' are independently selected from the group<br>
consisting hydrogei, halogen, C1-C18 alkyl, C1-C18 alkoxy, aryloxy, acyl, acyloxy, aryl.<br>
carboxy, alkoxycarbonyl, aryloxycarbonyl, trialkyl silyl, hydroxy,<br>
or a moiety of formula 4,<br><br>
Formula 4<br>
and wherein T is alkylene.<br>
Advantageously the thus formed modified polypropylene may be obtained without the<br>
associated production of significant and detrimental amounts of gels.<br>
Polymers suitable for use in the present invention include a wide variety of polypropylene<br>
homopolyraers, opolymers and blends containing one or more polypropylene<br>
homopolyiners and/or copolymers.<br>
Suitable polypropylene homopolymers include isotactic polypropylene, atactic<br>
polypropylene ami syndintactic polypropylene. Commercial isotactic polypropylene<br>
having a proportion of<br>
meso/dyads of greater than 90% is preferably used in the process of the present invention.<br>
Isotactic polypropylene is a semi-crystalline polymer having a number of properties which<br>
have made it one of the most widely used commercial polymers. These properties include<br>
heat resistance, stress cracking resistance, chemical resistance, toughness, and low<br>
manufacturing costs. However, the melt strength of isotactic polypropylene as measured<br>
directly by extensional viscosity or use of a commercial melt strength tester or indirectly by<br>
more qualitative measures such as drop time or die swell ratio is relatively low. This<br>
relatively low melt strength limits the use of polypropylene in applications such as foam<br>
extrusion, thermoforming and film blowing. In order to use polypropylene in such<br>
applications it is necessary to employ sophisticated processing equipment. The present<br>
invention now permits this already widely used commercial polymer to be used in an even<br>
wider range of applications.<br>
Polypropylene copolymers include copolymers of propylene and other monomers with such<br>
other monomers being present preferably in amounts of up to 10%wt/wt. A preferred<br>
comonomer is ethylene.<br>
The present invention is also applicable to other polvmers cornnrisinp a-olefin monomers.<br>
The initiators for use in the present invention may be selected from the group defined by<br>
formula 1.<br>
Formula 1<br>
wherein R is selected from the group consisting of optionally substituted C1 to C18 acyl,<br>
optionally substituted C1 to C18 alkyl, aroyl defined by formula 2,<br>
Formula 2<br>
and groups of formula 3,<br>
Formula 3<br>
wherein U, V, X, Y, Z, U', V', X', Y' and Z' are independently selected from the group<br>
consisting hydrogen, halogen, C1-C18 alkyl, C1-C18 alkoxy, aryloxy, acyl, acyloxy, aryl,<br>
carboxy, alkoxycarboxyl aryovycarboxyl, trialkyl silyl ht\ydroxy,<br>
or a moiety of formula 4,<br>
Formula 4<br>
and wherein T is alkylene.<br>
The alkyl, including acyl and alkoxy, groups included in the initiators of formula 1 may<br>
include hetero atoms within the carbon chain (eg polyalkylene oxide) and may be branched<br>
or unbranched and may be substituted with one or more groups such as with alkyl, aryl,<br>
alkoxy or halogen substituents.<br>
Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the aroyloxy radical of formula 5<br>
Formula 5<br>
,where U, V, X, Y and Z are as hereinabove defined, provide the surprising increase in melt<br>
strength. Other compounds which generate these aroyloxy radicals may also be used in the<br>
present invention.<br>
A preferred class of initiators of formula 1 are diaroyl peroxides of formula 6.<br>
Formula 6<br>
where X, Y, Z, U, V, X', Y' Z' U' V are independently selected from the group<br>
consisting of hydrogen and C1 - C18 alkyl where at least one of X, Y, Z, U, V and X', Y',<br>
Z', U', V' are not hydrogen.<br>

of the ring substituent as well as the structure of the substituent itself i.e. for propyl; n-propyi and<br>

ethylhexyi (octyloxy)perbcnzoate(all isomers), 2-ethylhexyl (nonyloxy)perbenzoate (all isomers)<br>
The initiators for use in the present invention also include compounds of formula 1 where at<br>
least one of U, V, X, Y, Z, U', V', X' Y' and Z' is a moiety of formula 4 where R is as<br>
defined above. Preferably there is no more than one moiety of formula 4 per aromatic ring.<br>
Such initiators are di or higher functional peroxides and may include polymeric peroxides<br>
such as Bis (tertbutylmonoperoxy phthaloyl) diperoxy terephthalate, Bis (tertamylmonoperoxy<br>
phthaloyl) diperoxy terephthalate diacetyl phthaloyl diperoxide, dibenzoyl phthaloyl diperoxide,<br>
bis(4 methylbenzoyl) phthaloyl diperoxide, diacetyl terephthaloyl di peroxide, dibenzoyl<br>
terephthaloyl diperoxide, Poly[ dioxycarbonyldioxy(l,l,4,4-tetramethyl-1,4-butanediyl)]<br>
peroxide.<br>
It is described that the initiators are selected such that it has an appropriate decomposition<br>
temperature (half life), solubility, and reactivity and such that the groups R, T, X, Y, Z, U, V,<br>
X', Y', Z',, U', V' give no adverse reaction under the conditions of the process. Preferred<br>
peroxides will have a 0.1 hour half life in the range 100 - 170°C<br>
The amount of initiator used in the process of the present invention should be an effective<br>
amount to achieve the desired increase in melt strength. Melt strength is considered in the<br>
art to be an indication of long-chain branching in polyolefins. It is preferable in the process<br>
of the present invention that long-chain branching predominates over crosslinking in the<br>
reaction between the initiator and the polypropylene (co)polymer. Crosslinking of the<br>
polypropylene (co)polymcr may result in the formation of gels which disrupt the appearance<br>
of the polypropylene (co)polymer. In the process of the present invention it is desirable to<br>
control Die degree and distribution of crosslinking and keep the level of crosslinking as<br>
uniform and as low as necessary to produce the desired effects. The amount of crosslinking<br>
which occurs in the polypropylene (co)potymer is dependant upon the amount of initiator melt<br>
mixed with the polypropylene (co)polymer. The amount of crosslinking is also dependent<br>
upon the degree of mixing as any regions high in initiator concentration will result in<br>
excessive localised crosslinking and the formation of gels. It is desirable that good<br>
distributive and dispersive mixing be employed to promote even distribution of the initiator<br>
in the polypropylene (co)polymer so as to minimise the variation in initiator concentration<br>
throughout the polypropylene (co)polymer and reduce the likelihood of the formation of gels.<br>
Preferably the initiator will be present in the range of from 0.004 to 0.25 moles of initiator<br>
per kg of the polypropylene homopolymer or copoiymer (polypropylene (co)polymer). The<br>
more preferred range being from 0.006 to 0.10 moles of initiator per kg. of the polypropylene<br>
(co)polymer and even more preferred range being from 0.01 to 0.05 moles of initiator per<br>
kg of the polypropylene (co)polymer.<br>
The initiator is preferably introduced into the polymer melt directly, either neat (as a powder<br>
or a liquid), dispersed or dissolved in a suitable medium (for example, dissolved in 2-<br>
butanone) or adsorbed on polymer pellets or powder which are added as a masterbatch. It<br>
is desirable that the initiator is rapidly mixed with the polymer melt at a raie in keeping with<br>
the half life of the initiator at the processing temperature of the polypropylene (co)porymer.<br>
The initiator may be added either alone, or along with the polypropylene (co)polymcr, or with<br>
any other polymer, additive or filler, so that the polymer melts and mixes with the initiator<br>
as it is decomposing. When the initiator is fed to the main feed throat of the extruder it is<br>
preferred to have a barrel temperature which is relatively low in the region adjacent to the<br>
main feed throat and increases towards the die to prevent premature decomposition of the<br>
peroxide.<br>

peroxide, m,p'-Bis(methylben2oyI) peroxide.<br>
The initiators may optionally be used in combination with one or more monoene monomers.<br>
It will be understood by those skilled in the art that by the term "monoene monomer'1 it is<br>
meant a monomer having a single reactive double bond.<br>
The preferred menoene monomer(s) or mixtures thereof include vinyl monomers of<br>
structure CH2 = CHX where X is chosen so as to confer the desired reactivity and solubility.<br>
More preferred monomers include styrene. The amount of monomer will preferably be up<br>

preferred range being 1 to 4 times the total moles of initiator added to the polypropylene<br>
(co)polymer.<br>
The monomer may be added with the polypropylene (co)polymer or it can be added prior to<br>
the initiator, with the initiator or subsequent to the initiator. However it is preferred to have<br>
the monomer mixed and dispersed into the polymer melt before the initiator has substantially<br>
decomposed. The monomer is preferably introduced into the polymer melt directly, either<br>
neat (as a powder or a liquid), dispersed or dissolved in a suitable medium (for example,<br>
dissolved in 2-butanone) or adsorbed on polymer pellets or powder which are added as a<br>

Advantageously iratiators may be selected to avoid undesirable by-products. In certair<br>
applications. it may be desirable to avoid the use of initiators which generate benzene. For<br>
example di toluoyl peroxides (bis methyl benzoyl peroxides) may be used in preference to<br>
dibenzoyl peroxide.<br>
The processability and other properties of the product may be improved by a chain scissior.<br>
step following the initial polymer modification step This may be carried out by:<br>
a) adding one or more additional initiators with or subsequent to the first initiator addition;<br>
b) the use of high shear mixing;<br>
c) the use of high temperatures;<br>
d) the use combina ion is of one or more of (a) - (c) above.<br>
This additional step in the production of a polymer enables tailoring the properties of the<br>
product to meet the requirements of the desired application. For example, by this two stage<br>
process it is possitle to produce materials with similar melt viscosity to the base polymer<br>
but a substantially increased melt strength. Use of the single stage process generally<br>
provides both an. ir crease in melt strength and an increase in melt viscosity (see examples)<br>
One or more additional initiators may be added to the polypropylene (co)polymer during<br>
the modification process either with or subsequent to the initiator and monomer addition.<br>
The additional ;:ni iator is typically added to give chain scission of the polypropylene<br>
(co)polymer so as to decrease the melt viscosity and improve the processability of the<br>
modified polypropylene (co)polymer. The additional initiator should be introduced to the<br>
polymer melt after the first initiator or have a sufficiently long half-life relative to the first<br>
initiator such that its decomposition can be staged to occur after the initial polymer<br>
modification process. In some instances a polypropylene (co)polymer modified in<br>
accordance with the present invention may have a MFK1 g/10 min. With use of the<br>
additional initiator an MFI &gt;1 g/10 min may be achieved. The additional initiator may be<br>
selected from the group consisting of 2.5-dimethyl-2,5-di(t-butylperoxy)hexane (DHBP),<br>
dicumyl peroxide DCP), t-butyl peroxy-2-ethylhexonate(TBEH), and dilauryl peroxide<br>
(DLP) or any other peroxide which may result in the overall chain scission of the<br>
polypropylene (co)polymer during melt processing. For example in the absence of the<br>
monoene monomers, t-butyl peroxybenzoate or other non-preferred initiators for use in the<br>
presence of the monomer may be preferably added as the additional initiator. While the<br>
improvement in processability through chain scission normally results in some decrease in<br>
the melt strength/extensional viscosity of the modified polypropylene (co)polymer, the<br>
melt strength/extensional viscosity may still be acceptable, and improved over the<br>
unmodified polypropylene (co)polymer.<br>
It is possible to combine the process of the present invention with other processes of polymer<br>
modification or witi, for example, the addition of fillers, additives or stabilisers, or blending<br>
with other polymers.<br>
In the process of th; present invention the polypropylene (co)polymer is melt mixed in the<br>
presence of initiato and optionally a monoene monomer. Melt mixing may be carried out<br>
by any convenient means capable of mixing the polypropylene (co)polymer at<br>
temperatures above the melting point of the polypropylene (co)polymer.<br>
Suitable apparatus for melt mixing the polypropylene (co)polymer include continuous and<br>
batch mixers. Suitable mixing equipment include:; extruders such as single screw and twin<br>
screw extruders, static mixers, cavity transfer mixers and combinations of two or more<br>
thereof. It is preferred that the melt mixing is conducted in either a co or counter- rotating<br>
twin screw extrude].<br>
The barrel set temperatures are preferably in the range 80-280 °C. Typical melt<br>
temperatures are in the range 170-290 °C.<br>
In order to optimise the melt strength/extensional viscosity, the preferred melt<br>
temperatures are in the range 160 °C to 220 °C. This range provides optimal properties<br>
whilst minimising the amount of chain scission which occurs during processing. However,<br>
in some cases it may be desirable to use higher temperatures such as in the<br>
venting/discharge sections of single screw or twin screw extruders or to induce some chain<br>
scission in order to decrease the molecular weight of the modified polypropylene<br>
(co)polymer and irr prove the processability of the modified polypropylene (co)polymer.<br>
Typically, the die temperatures are in the range 180-290 °C.<br>
Preferably the extrusion conditions are adjusted so that the polypropylene (co)poiymer.<br>
initiator/monomer mixture are conveyed as quickly as possible into the melting/mixing zone<br>
to maximise the melt phase reaction (eg for twin screw extruders - high throughput rates.<br>
higher screw speeds under starve fed conditions). It is more prefeired that the additives arc<br>
added to and mixed with molten polypropylene (co)polyrner to further enhance the melt phase<br>
reaction. Preferably residence times in the range of from 10 seconds to 5 minutes are selected<br>
depending upon the temperature profile, throughput rate and initiator levels. More preferred<br>
residence times axe in the range of from 15 seconds to 120 seconds.<br>
Vacuum venting can be applied to remove volatile by-products, solvents and/or excess<br>
monomer.<br>
While not wishing to be limited by theory, it is believed that the effectiveness of the present<br>
invention is determined by three factors:<br>
(a) The rate and specificity of the reaction of the aroyloxy or the derived phenyl radicals or<br>
substituted phenyl radicals with polypropylene, and the monomer if present. It is believed<br>
that the aroyloxy, phenyl or substituted aroyloxy or phenyl radicals show less specificity for<br>
abstraction of tertiary vs. secondary or primary hydrogens than do, for example, alkoxy or<br>
alkyl radicals.<br>
(b) The initiator half-life. Use of an initiator with a short initiator half-life will generate a<br>
locally high concentration of radicals thus increasing the likelihood of radical combination<br>
events.<br>
(c) The solubility characteristics of the initiator in the polymer melt.<br>
Without wishing to be bound by theory, peroxides that generate aroyloxy or aryl radicals (for<br>
example benzoyloxy, p-toluouloxy) are preferred over those that generate alkoxy radicals (for<br>
example, t-butoxy radical, cumyloxy radical). It is believed and supported in the literature<br>
that the latter class of peroxides promote chain scission under the melt mixing conditions.<br>
While not wishing to be bound by the mechanism, it is believed that this effect is due to the<br>
specificity shown by the alkoxy radicals as opposed to the aroyloxy or aryl radicals generated<br>
by the peroxides of structure 1. Furthermore we believe that peroxides which generate both<br>
alkoxy and aroyloxy or aryl radicals (for example, t-butyl perbenzoate) show intermediate<br>
behaviour. It is believed that they promote less chain scission than peroxides which generate<br>
only alkoxy radicals (for example, dialkyl peroxides) when used alone and can be used to<br>
advantage in systems where a monomer coagent is employed. Preferred peresters are thus<br>
those which generate alkoxy radicals which are not active in hydrogen abstraction (for<br>
example t-amyl perbenzoate).<br>
Similarly, it is believed, without wishing to be bound by theory, that the effectiveness of the<br>
monomer is determined by:<br>
(a) The solubility of the monomer in the polymer melt. For example, sryrene is known to be<br>
soluble in molten polypropylene.<br>
(b) The reactivity of the monomer towards polypropylene derived radicals.<br>
(c) The propensity for the radical formed by addition of monomer to give combination or<br>
addition (which leads to branch or crosslink formation) vs. disproportionabon or hydrogen<br>
abstraction. It is known mat the benzylic radicals give predominantly combination and have<br>
low (with relation to other radicals) tendency to abstract hydrogen.<br>
Other initiators and monomers that meet the above criteria may also be used to advantage in<br>
the present invention.<br>
Surprisingly, the process of the present invention results in a polypropylene (co)polymer with<br>
substantially increased melt strength. We have found that it is possible with the present<br>
invention to obtain a polypropylene (co)polymer which has a melt strength at least 25%<br>
greater than the melt strength of the base polymer. We have also found that it is possible to<br>
obtain an increase in melt strength of greater than 100% for a number of the polypropylene<br>
(co)polymers produced in accordance with the process of the present invention. Increases in<br>
melt strength were assessed using a Gottfert-Rheotens melt strength tester operated with a<br>
roller acceleration of 1.2 cm/sec3 measuring the melt strength of a 2 mm strand of molten<br>
polypropylene (co)porymer (melt temperature of 210°C) which is fed to the Gottfert tester at<br>
~4 g/min.<br>
In a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a modified polypropylene:<br>
(co)polymer produced according to the process described herein, wherein said modifier!<br>
polypropylene (co)polymer preferably has a melt strength at least 25%, and more preferably<br>
at least 100%, grerier than the unmodified polypropylene (co)polymer.<br>
The polypropylene (co)porymers produced according to the process of the present invention<br>
also may provide a significant increase in long-chain branching. Long-chain branching may<br>
be assessed by the Dow Rheology Index. Advantageously, the modified polypropylene<br>
(co)polymers may demonstrate a Dow Rheology Index (DRI) of greater than 1, preferably<br>
at least 2 and most preferably greater than 60.<br>
The process of the present invention may also be used to increase the melt elasticity of a<br>
polypropylene (co)polymer.<br>
Advantageously, the process of the. present invention also provides a means to alter the<br>
molecular weight, molecular weight distribution and/or degree and length of branching of<br>
polypropylene, ethylene-propylene copolyners, and analogous a-olefin copolymers with or<br>
without altering the melt strength of said polymers by melt processing<br>
The process of the preheat invention may provide a means to generally increase the molecular<br>
weight and broadea the molecular weight distribution and/or introduce branching of the<br>
polypropylene (co)polymer. This will not always equate to significant increases in the melt<br>
strength or extensions] viscosity of the polymer that is being modified eg modification of a<br>
lower molecular weight polymer to broaden the molecular weight and/or induce shorter<br>
branches. Such a product may not necessarily demonstrate a high melt strength, but may<br>
demonstrate other desireable properties, for example improved filler uptake, mechanical<br>
properties, surface properties, thermal and morphological properties.<br>
The modified polypropylene (co)polymer produced by the process of the present invention<br>
may be used either neat or blended with another polymer or other additives to provide the<br>
desired balance of properties in the polymer blend.<br>
The modified polypropylene (co)polymers and blends may be used in a wide variety of<br>
applications including thermoforming, blow moulding, tube or pipe extrusion, blown films,<br>
foams and extrusion coating.<br>
The present invention may also be used in the recycling of waste polypropylene or materials<br>
containing waste polypropylene.<br>
The increased melt strength of the modified polypropylene (co)polymers renders these<br>
(co)polymers more suitable for use in thermoforming applications. The modified<br>
polypropylene (co)polymers may be used to thermofonn containers such as margarine tubs.<br>
The benefits of this invention include that the polypropylene (co)polymers and blends<br>
containing same provide a wider temperature processing window than conventional isotactic<br>
polypropylene. The modified polypropylene (co)polymers may also be used in large pan<br>
thermoforming such as in the production of refrigerator liners and the like where conventional<br>
isotactic polypropylene is unsuitable.<br>
The modified polypropylene (co)polymers produced in accordance with the present invention<br>
are suitable for blow moulding and we have found that they can be more readily blow<br>
moulded into containers. Furthermore, the increased melt strength makes it possible to<br>
produce large blow moulded parts through the use of the high melt strength modified<br>
polypropylene (co)polymer. Thus components currently made by rotational moulding may<br>
now be produced by blow moulding using the modified polypropylene (co)polymer of the<br>
present invention.<br>
Profile extrusion for example tube or pipe extrusion, using the modified polypropylene<br>
(co)polymer has been found to produce a more consistent product than conventional isotactic<br>
polypropylene.<br>
Blown films made of polypropylene are generally blown downwards using relatively<br>
expensive equipment. The modified polypropylene (co)polymers of the present invention<br>
have sufficient melt strength for them to be able them to be blown upwardly using<br>
conventional polyethylene type film blowing equipment which is less expensive and generally<br>
more convenient to operate. Advantageously the modified polypropylene (co)polymcrs of the<br>
present invention may be used in the production of blown films.<br>
The modified polypropylene (co)polymers of the present invention may also be foamed with<br>
a wider processing window than for conventional polypropylene. Either a physical or<br>
chemical blowing agent may be used. It is preferred to use carbon dioxide as a physical<br>
blowing agent to produce foams having a fine closed cell structure. Foamed pellets may be<br>
subsequently moulded to form components for use in a variety of applications such as<br>
automotive door trims, roofttnings, dash boards, bumpers and the like. Applications such as<br>
in foamed packaging arc also possible, including thermoformed containers, insulating cups<br>
and the like.<br>
Waste polypropylene or waste streams containing a significant proportion of polypropylene<br>
are presently difficult to recycle as conventionally a high degree of chain scission results from<br>
die recycling process. The process of the present invention may be used to upgrade recycled<br>
streams containing polypropylene by increasing the overall mechanical properties of the<br>
recycled polypropylene by the addition of initiator and monomer in accordance with the<br>
present invention.<br>
The present invention will now be described with reference to the following non-limiting<br>
examples. Described hereunder are the measurement techniques used in the examples and a<br>
full description of the process conditions employed. Comparative Examples are labelled CE-<br>
n.<br>
Melt Strength Measurement<br>
Melt strengths were measured on a "Rheotens" Melt Strength Tester, Type 010.1, supplied<br>
by Gottfert Werkstoff-Pruftnaschinen Gmbh of Buchen, Germany. This test involves drawing<br>
an extruded strand of polymer vertically into the nip between two counter-rotating nip rollers.<br>
The strand was extruded using a Brabender Plasticord single screw extruder of screw diameter<br>
19mm and length to diameter ratio (L/D) of 25. The extrudatc exited via a right angle<br>
capillary die (2mm diameter). The temperature profile used was uniform along the length of<br>
the barrel of the extruder and the die and was set at 190°C. The nip rollers are mounted on<br>
a balance arm which allows the force in the drawing strand to be measured. The velocity of<br>
the nip rolls is increased at a uniform acceleration rate. As the test proceeds, the force<br>
increases until eventually the strand breaks. The force at breakage is termed the "melt<br>
strength".<br>
While there is no internationally-established standard set of test requirements for melt strength<br>
testing, comparative melt strength values obtained under the given set of test conditions<br>
provide a quantitative determination of the increase in melt strength used in the patent. The<br>
test conditions used were: die temperature 190°C, extruder output rate -4 g/min, acceleration<br>
rate 1.2 cm/sec2, draw distance 210 mm, matt finish steel rollers.<br>
Dow Rheotogy Index<br>
The Dow Rheology Index (DRI) is believed in the art to be a measure of the long chain<br>
branching in a polymer. It is expressed as the deviation of a viscosity parameter obtained<br>
from shear rheology measurements on a "branched" polymer compared with that for a linear<br>
polymer. The branched polymers have lower values of the viscosity parameter than the linear<br>
polymers (for a given relaxation parameter). The parameters are obtained by fitting the<br>
Cross model to the shear viscosity flow curves. The DRI method has been described by Lai,<br>
Plumley, Butler, Knight and Kao in a paper in SPE ANTEC '94 Conference Proceedings<br>
(ppl814-1818) - "Dow Rheology Index (DRI) for Insite Technology Polyolefins (ITP):<br>
Unique Structure-Processing Relationships".<br>
Dynamic Rheology Tests<br>
The dynamic rheology tests were performed on a Rheometrics Dynamic Stress Rheometer<br>
SR200. Test conditions were: parallel plates, temperature 190°C, frequency range 0.01 to<br>
100 rad/sec, and 3-4% strain, in a nitrogen atmosphere to prevent degradation. G' is the<br>
storage modulus representing the elasticity of the polymer melt, G"is the loss modulus which<br>
represents the viscous component of the deformation. The polydispersity index is 10 to<br>
power 5 divided by the crossover modulus, which is the value of G1 = G"<br>
when the G' and G" curves crossover - it is believed to be a measure of MWD. The higher<br>
G' the greater elasticity in the polymer and the higher the MW.<br>
MFI<br>
Melt flow indexes (MFI) were measured a 230°C with a 2.16 kg load according to ASTM<br>
1238.<br>
Drop Times<br>
The drop times were determined by measuring the time taken for the polypropylene strand<br>
(cut at the die face) to drop from the die of the extruder to the floor. The die of the JSW twin<br>
screw extruder was 1140 mm above the floor. The drop time test combines the effects of<br>
melt viscosity, extensional viscosity, chain entanglement (as shown by die swell), and<br>
elasticity (as shown by the tendency resist neck formation). Higher melt viscosity<br>
polypropylene polymers had drop times which incorporated some additional effect due to<br>
prolonged cooling of the slower moving (falling) molten strand.<br>
GPC<br>
GPC molecular weights were determined using a Waters 150C high temperature GPC unit.<br>
1,2,4-trichlorobenzene was used as the solvent, eluting through two Styragel HT6E linear<br>
columns. The oven temperature was set at 140oC and the pump flow rate was l.0ml/min.<br>
Calibration was performed using narrow polydispersity polystyrene standards. AH molecular<br>
weights quoted as polystyrene equivalents.<br>
Mn= number average molecular weight<br>
Mw= weight average molecular weight<br>
Mz= viscosity average molecular weight<br>
Mp= peak molecular weight<br>
Twin Screw Extruder<br>
The twin screw extruder used in the examples was a JSW TEX-30 with a 30 mm screw<br>
diameter and an overall L/D of 42 [comprising ten temperature controlled barrel sections<br>
(L/D 3.5, temperatures between 120 and 230°C as specified in Table 1), three unheated<br>
sampling/monitoring blocks (L/D 1.167) and a cooled feed block (L/D 3-5)) equipped with<br>
two JSW TTF20 gravimetric feeders, one K-Tron KQx gravimetric additives feeder and a<br>
volumetric liquid addition pump (Fuji Techno Industries model HYM-03-08)]. The extruder<br>
was operated in either co-rotating (intermeshing self wiping) or counter rotating<br>
(intermeshing non-self wiping) modes with a throughput rate of between 5 and 20 kg/hr and<br>
screw speeds of between 100 and 400 rpm as specified in Table 1. The melt temperature and<br>
pressures were monitored at three points along the barrel and in the die.<br>
The overall extruder configuration and modifier conditions may be recited, for example, as<br>
condition: A16.<br>
Solvent Addition of Modifiers<br>
The initiator, and monomer if present, was introduced as a solution in 2-butanone or xylene.<br>
The concentration of the initiator varied from 5.6% wt/wt to 8.5% wt/wt. The benzoyl<br>
peroxide and the di-toluol peroxides were both powders wetted with 25% (wt/wt) water. The<br>
monomer was present in an amount between 4 to 10% wt/wt solvent.<br>
Increased levels of initiator were generally added by increasing the amount of solution added<br>
to the polymer melt. The additional peroxides (if any) were added with the initiator in the<br>
carrier solvent.<br>
Solventless Addition of Modifiers<br>
t-Butyl peroxybenzoate is a liquid. The solventless modification of the polymer was achieved<br>
by absorbing the initiator onto powdered polymer or blending it with powdered polymer at<br>
concentrations ranging from 5% wt/wt to 10% wt/wt to form a masterbatch. The masterbatch<br>
was added to the extruder in varying feed rates to alter the amount of additives. The amount<br>
of polymer feed was adjusted accordingly to give constant overall feed rate.<br>
The stabilisers were also added as a masterbatch. The amount of stabiliser was generally kept<br>
constant at 0.33%wt/wt Irganox 1010 and 0.17%wt/wt Irgaphos 168 in the total composition.<br>
The main polymer feed was added as either powder or pellets.<br>
Single Screw Extruders<br>
Killion<br>
The Killion single screw extruder used in the examples was a segmented single screw extruder<br>
of L/D=40 (11 barrel sections , 10 heated) and screw diameter of 31.75 mm.<br>
Polypropylene powder, stabilisers (0-33%wt/wt Irganox 1010, 0.17%wt/wt Irgaphos 168 in<br>
total) and initiator were added to the feed throat of the single screw extruder via a twin screw<br>
K-Tron volumetric feeder.<br>
Alternatively, the polypropylene powder and stabilisers were added via the K-Tron feeder and<br>
polypropylene powder, stabilisers and the modifiers were added as a master batch via a single<br>
screw APV Accurate volumetric feeder. The masterbatch contained 7.5%wt/wt benzoyl<br>
peroxide (prepared using a dispersion of benzoyl peroxide containing 25%wt/wt water).<br>
The output of the extruder was ~ 1.5 kg/hr using a screw speed of 30rpm. The set barrel<br>
temperature was either (I) a flat 220°C with each barrel section and the die set at a<br>
temperature of 220°C or (ii) 230oC/190oC with the first six melting sections of the barrel set<br>
at 230oC and the next four metering sections of the barrel and the die set at 190°C. The melt<br>
temperature varied from 220 to 260°C.<br>
Brabender<br>
5 The Brabender single screw extruder used was a single screw extruder of L/D = 25 (4 Barrel<br>
sections), compression ratio 2.5:1 and screw diameter of 19 mm. The die was a 4 mm rod<br>
die.<br>
The screw speed of the extruder was 20 ipm. The set barrel temperature was 140oC, 170°C,<br>
 180°C, 180°C. Residences time: Start 3 min 40 sec; Middle 4 min 35 sec; and End 7 min<br>
30 sec.<br>
Polypropylene powder either as cryoground pellets or ex-reactor powder was mixed with the<br>
modifiers and added to the feed throat, either flood feed or by a Brabender single screw<br>
volumetric feeder.<br>
The following commercial polypropylene (co)polymers were used in the examples. The<br>
properties of the (co)polymers are shown in Table 4 below.<br>
1* Melt strength and MFI were measured for a particular batch and we have found actual<br>

Examples of Carbon Dioxide Foaming of Modified PP<br>
The equipment used for foaming the polypropylene (from earlier examples) was a tandem<br>
extrusion line made up of an Leitritz twin screw extruder (34 mm screw diameter, co-<br>
rotating, with 11 barrel sections) connected via a melt pipe to a single screw extruder (43 mm<br>
screw diameter). CO2 was introduced into barrel six of the twin screw extruder. The gassed<br>
polymer was then cooled slowly in the single screw extruder.<br>
Non high melt strength grades of polypropylene have foam temperature processing windows<br>
of less than 1°C.<br>
Foamed examples 13 and 17 both has a fine closed cell structure.<br>
Examples of thermoforming<br>
The modified polypropylene produced in Example 69 was extruded on a Welex single screw<br>
extruder through a sheet die to produce a sheet 78cm wide and "1.25 mm thick. The sheet<br>
was fed to a Gabler F702 continuous thermoformer to produce margarine tubs. Tubs<br>
produced from the modified PP sample had a crush strength of 25 kg after 1 hour. No<br>
appreciable sag was noticed of the PP sheet during the process.<br>
The modified polypropylene of Example 5 was blow moulded on Bekum blow moulder fitted<br>
with a general puipose polyolefin screw using a 750 ml screw top bottle mould, (radially non<br>
symmetrical bottle with waist). The mould temperature was 0C.<br>
The blow mouldabiuty of the modified injection moulding grade of PP was compared against<br>
that of a commercial low melt flow index PP homopolymer (ICI GWM110 of MFI = 1.5).<br>
It was found that the modified PP homopolymer (MFI = 9.1 and Melt Strength = 6.9 cN)<br>
i could be easily blow moulded into 750 ml bottles. Conventional PP of similar MFI could not<br>
be-successfully blow moulded. The modified PP gave similar performance to an extrusion<br>
grade PP of low MFI.<br>
The results are very promising where a higher MFI PP could be used to blow bottles. This<br>
possibly opens up the opportunity to produce large blow moulded parts through use of a high<br>
melt strength modified PP which has been tailored to have an MFI acceptable to blow<br>
moulding (ie 1-2 MFI)<br>
