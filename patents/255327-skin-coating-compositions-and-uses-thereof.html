				<td>Skin Coating Composition and Uses Thereof<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention generally relates to a composition suitable for coating skin<br>
wherein the composition forms a durable waterproof flexible film on skin. The composition<br>
may include different ingredients for different applications. In one embodiment, the<br>
composition includes pigment and/or dye and may be used to coat a skin blemish such that the<br>
skin blemish blends in with the surrounding skin. In another embodiment, the composition<br>
includes a sunscreen agent and may be used as a sunscreen. In yet another embodiment, the<br>
composition includes a therapeutic agent for treating the skin.<br>
The subject matter of this application is related to the applicant's co-pending<br>
International Patent Application filed on 29 July 2005 and entitled "A Colour Compensating<br>
System" as well as Australian Provisional Patent Application No. 2004904225, the entire<br>
contents of which are herein incorporated by cross-reference.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Compositions for coating skin are known. Some are in the form of cosmetics for<br>
masking skin discoloration and skin blemishes, others are in the form of sunscreens for<br>
providing protection against the adverse effects of solar radiation, and yet others are in the<br>
form of skin care products for promoting healthy skin. For example, US 2,435,005 discloses<br>
skin protecting treatments or oils for use as an insect repellent or sunscreen agent. While US<br>
2002/0197221 discloses cosmetic compositions for coating the skin.<br>
Some of the known skin coating compositions have the disadvantage that they are not<br>
long-lasting on the skin and may require frequent reapplication. Some compositions may be<br>
readily rubbed off the skin, whereas other compositions may be readily washed off the skin by<br>
way of sweat or when in contact with water.<br><br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention broadly relates to a coating composition that, when applied to<br>
the skin, forms a durable waterproof (i.e. impervious to water) flexible film.<br>
According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a coating<br>
composition for skin, said composition comprising resin and flexibilizer, wherein upon<br>
application to skin, said composition forms a waterproof flexible film, characterised in that<br>
said composition comprises:<br>
about 5-30% w/w resin; <br>
about 50-80% w/w alcohol; <br>
about 7-42.5% w/w oil;<br>
about 2-10% w/w cellulosic preparation; and <br>
about 0.5-10% w/w inorganic thickener,<br>
wherein the ratio of resin to oil to cellulosic preparation ranges from 0.5:0.7:1 to<br>
15:21.25:1.<br>
According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a method for coating<br>
skin comprising the steps of:<br>
(i) coating skin with a composition comprising resin and flexibilizer; and<br>
(ii) allowing the composition to form a waterproof flexible film over the skin.<br>
Preferably, the flexible film is durable and is capable of remaining adhered to the skin<br>
for 1 to 3 days and more preferably up to about 5 days. The durability of the film will depend,<br>
inter alia, on the composition of the film, the properties of the skin and the environmental<br>
conditions to which the skin and film are subjected.<br>
The properties of the film will depend on the choice and quantity of resin and<br>
flexibilizer. Preferably, the ratio of resin to oil to cellulosic preparation ranges from<br>
0.5:0.7:1 to 15:21.25:1. The properties of the film may be adjusted as necessary by changing<br>
the ingredients of the composition as well as by varying the relative amounts of ingredients.<br>
Other ingredients (eg. diluent, thickener and adhesive) may be added to the composition, and<br>
these will also affect the properties of the film.<br>
The composition may be, for example, in the form of a paste, cream, gel, liquid or<br>
aerosol. The film may be opaque, translucent or transparent. The composition may be used as a<br>
bandage or as artificial skin.<br><br>
The composition may include a diluent. Any suitable type of diluent may be used.<br>
The composition may include more than one type of diluent. Any suitable quantity of diluent<br>
may be used. For instance, the composition may contain little diluent if applied to the skin as a<br>
paste, e.g. using a brush or sponge. The composition may contain more diluent if applied to the<br>
skin as a liquid, e.g. using an airbrushing gun. The composition may be in the form of an<br>
aerosol, packaged under pressure with a suitable gaseous propellant. The diluent may be<br>
evaporative. Preferably, the diluent is an alcohol, such as ethanol, which will readily evaporate.<br>
The alcohol may be denatured or non-denatured. Preferably, ethanol (denatured with IPA) is<br>
present in the composition in an amount of about 20-80% weight by weight (w/w) .<br>
Any suitable type of resin may be used. The composition may include more than one<br>
type of resin. The resin may be of natural or synthetic origin. Any suitable quantity of resin<br>
may be used. The resin may be a natural alcohol-soluble resin such as shellac. Preferably, the<br>
resin is de-waxed (blonde) bleached shellac. More preferably, shellac is present in the<br>
composition in an amount of about 5-30% w/w.<br>
Any suitable type of flexibilizer (plasticiser) may be used to impart flexibility to the<br>
film and to hinder flaking of the film from the skin. The composition may include more than<br>
one type of flexibilizer. Any suitable quantity of flexibilizer may be used. A suitable<br>
flexibilizer may be oil. The oil may be of animal, vegetable, mineral or synthetic origin. The<br>
oil may be, for example, castor oil, pine oil, eucalyptus oil, ti-tree oil, rosehip oil or soya bean<br>
oil, or a mixture thereof. Preferably, oil is present in the composition in an amount of about 1-<br>
70% w/w. More preferably, the oil is present in the composition in an amount of about 7-<br>
42.5% w/w.<br>
The composition may include a cellulosic preparation. A cellulosic preparation is an<br>
example of another suitable flexibilizer. Any suitable type of cellulosic preparation may be<br>
used. The cellulosic preparation may comprise, for example, ethyl cellulose. Preferably, a<br>
cellulosic preparation is present in the composition in an amount of about 2-20% w/w. More<br>
preferably, a cellulosic preparation is present in the composition in an amount of about 2-10%<br>
w/w.<br>
The composition may include an adhesive for improving attachment of the film to the<br>
skin. Any suitable type of adhesive may be used. The composition may include more than one<br>
type of adhesive. Any suitable quantity of adhesive may be used. Preferably, the adhesive is<br>
ethyl cellulose or sucrose acetate isobutyrate.<br><br>
The composition may include an anti-agglomeration agent or dispersing agent. Any<br>
suitable agent or agents may be used. A suitable agent may be a blend of neutralised acid esters<br>
of phosphoric acid together with 2-(2-butoxyethoxy)ethanol.<br>
The composition may include thickener to increase the viscosity of the composition.<br>
Any suitable type of thickener may be used. The composition may include more than one type<br>
of thickener. Any suitable quantity of thickener may be used. A suitable thickener may<br>
include, for example, one or more of the following: a cellulosic preparation or an inorganic<br>
thickener such as silicon dioxide (fumed silica), castor oil derivatives, quaternium ammonium<br>
compound of bentonite, zinc stearate, nano zinc oxide (Zinclear™), inorganic thixotrope or<br>
modified clays. Preferably, inorganic thickener is present in the composition in an amount of<br>
about 0.5-10% w/w.<br>
The composition may include a preservative for extending the shelf life of the<br>
composition. Any suitable type of preservative may be used. The composition may include<br>
more than one type of preservative. Any suitable quantity of preservative may be used. A<br>
suitable preservative may include, for example, one or more of the following: butylated<br>
hydroxytoluene (BHT), butylated hydroxyanisole, hydroquinone and methylhydroquinone.<br>
Preferably, preservative is present in the composition in an amount of about 0.5-5% w/w.<br>
The film is preferably highly resistant to being washed off with water. The film may<br>
remain intact even when immersed in hot water. The film preferably bonds to the skin when<br>
immersed in saltwater. The film is preferably highly resistant to being rubbed off. The film<br>
may remain attached to the skin even if a shaver is scraped over the film. If more than one film<br>
layer is applied to the skin, the film layers may bond to one another. Preferably, the film<br>
enables the skin to breathe. It appears that the skin is able to breathe in that the film does not<br>
completely seal sweat pores of the skin as well as perhaps hair follicles of the skin.<br>
According to a preferred form of the invention, the coating composition comprises:<br>
about 5-30% w/w resin;<br>
about 50-80% w/w alcohol;<br>
about 7-42.5% w/w oil;<br>

The coating composition according to the first aspect of the invention may include<br>
different ingredients for different applications. For example, the coating composition may<br>
include at least one pigment and/or dye and be used to coat discoloured skin or a skin blemish<br>
such that the discoloured skin or skin blemish blends with the surrounding skin. The skin<br>
discoloration/skin blemish may be due to, for example, a birthmark, a mole, a basal cell<br>
carcinoma, vitiligo, a scar, a burn, pigmentation, acne, a vein, tattoo, eczema, dermatitis or<br>
bruising. Alternatively, such a composition may be used to simply change the skin colour of an<br>
individual.<br>
Alternatively or additionally, the coating composition may include at least one<br>
sunscreen agent and be used as a sunscreen. The sunscreen may protect individuals against<br>
premature ageing of skin, skin cancer and other harmful effects of solar radiation.<br>
Alternatively or additionally, the coating composition may include at least one therapeutic<br>
agent for preventing or treating disorders of the skin - for example, cuts, inflammation or<br>
infections.<br>
According to a third aspect of the present invention, there is provided a coloured<br>
coating composition for skin, said composition comprising resin, flexibilizer and pigment<br>
and/or dye, wherein upon application to skin, said composition forms a waterproof flexible<br>

According to a fourth aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for coating a<br>
skin discoloration or skin blemish such that the skin discoloration or blemish blends with the<br>
surrounding skin, said method comprising the steps of:<br>
(i) coating a skin discoloration or blemish with a composition comprising resin,<br>
flexibilizer, and pigment and/or dye; and<br>
(ii) allowing the composition to form a waterproof flexible coloured film over the<br>
skin discoloration or blemish.<br>
Preferably, said composition comprises:<br>
about 5-30% w/w resin;<br>
about 50-80% w/w alcohol;<br><br>
about 7-42.5% w/w oil;<br>
about 2-10% w/w cellulosic preparation; and<br>
about 0.5-10% w/w inorganic thickener,<br>
wherein the ratio of resin to oil to cellulosic preparation ranges from 0.5:0.7:1 to<br>
15:21.25:1.<br>
In another embodiment, the method comprises the pre-step of diluting the composition of<br>
in ethanol to produce a composition having 30% volume by volume (v/v) of the<br>
composition and 70% v/v ethanol and applying the diluted composition to the skin by<br>
spraying.<br>
The method may further comprise the step of (iii) applying a fixing powder to the<br>
coated skin discoloration of blemish to create a matte effect and to produce a more natural skin<br>
appearance. The fixing powder may be applied immediately after application of the<br>
composition and then reapplied after washing the skin. The application of a fixing powder is<br>
preferred if the composition is applied to the skin as a spray.<br>
The fixing powder may be of any suitable composition. The fixing powder can<br>
comprise talc, kaolin, zinc stearate, silicone oil (dimethicone), propylene glycol, and one or<br>
more preservatives such as, for instance, methylparaben, propylparaben, ethylparaben,<br>
butylparaben and mydazolidinyl urea. Talc and kaolin are opaquing agents. Zinc stearate is a<br>
lubricant. Dimethicone aids in spreading and rubbing of the powder on the skin and acts as a<br>
barrier preventing water penetration. Propylene glycol is a solvent. The fixing powder may<br>
also reduce any stickiness of an exposed surface of the film.<br>
In a preferred form the fixing powder comprises:<br>
about 93% w/w talc;<br>
about 4.7% w/w zinc stearate;<br>
about 1.4% w/w silicone oil; and<br>
about 0.9% w/w Unigerm G2™ (mixture of methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylene<br>
glycol and mydazolidinyl urea).<br>
The method preferably comprises the step of cleaning the skin (of natural oils,<br>
cosmetics etc.) before applying the coating composition.<br>
The method may comprise additional initial steps of:<br><br>
measuring at least one colour property of the skin discoloration or blemish;<br>
measuring at least one colour property of the surrounding skin; and<br>
using the measured at least one colour property of the skin discoloration or blemish<br>
and the at least one colour property of the surrounding skin to formulate a composition having<br>
a compensatory colour such that the skin discoloration or blemish when coated with the<br>
composition blends with the surrounding skin.<br>
Details of these additional initial steps may be found in the applicant's co-pending<br>
International Patent Application entitled "A Colour Compensating System" as well as in<br>
Provisional Patent Application No. 2004904225.<br>
The coloured coating composition preferably has a degree of translucency when<br>
applied to the skin discoloration or blemish and is not of identical colour to the surrounding<br>
skin. The present inventor has found that previous attempts to cover discoloured<br>
skin/blemishes by selecting an opaque cosmetic coating that is exactly the same colour as the<br>
surrounding skin and subsequently applying that coating to the skin discoloration/blemish to<br>
hide or mask the discoloration/blemish resulted in an unnatural and overly-made up, almost<br>
plasticky, look. Rather than simply trying to hide the discoloration/blemish, the translucent<br>
coating can have an additive or complementary effect with the underlying<br>
discoloration/blemish such that the discoloration/blemish, when coated, has a more natural<br>
appearance whilst still matching the appearance of the surrounding skin.<br>
According to a fifth aspect of the present invention, there is provided a sunscreen<br>
composition for skin, said composition comprising resin, flexibilizer and sunscreen agent,<br>
wherein upon application to skin, said composition forms a waterproof flexible film having a<br>
defined sun protection factor (SPF) value.<br>
Any suitable type of sunscreen agent may be used. The composition may include one<br>
or more sunscreen agents. Suitable sunscreen agents include titanium dioxide and zinc oxide.<br>
Preferably, the composition includes zinc oxide. If a clear sunscreen is desired, the zinc oxide<br>
may have a particle size of about 5-100 tun, and more preferably a particle size of about 20-40<br>
tun. If a white opaque sunscreen is desired, the zinc oxide may have a larger particle size.<br>
The composition may have any defined SPF value, depending on its intended use. Preferably,<br>
the SPF value is at least 15 and more preferably at least 30. The composition may be applied to<br>
the skin in layers so as to exceed an SPF value of 30. A multilayer film may provide an SPF<br>
value of over 1000.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment the at least one sunscreen agent is present in an amount of<br>
about 10 to 60 % w/w sunscreen agent.<br>
Preferably, the sunscreen film is durable in that it need not be reapplied for at least 1<br>
to 3 days and up to about five days.<br>
The sunscreen composition may further include a pigment and/or dye for coating<br>
discoloured skin or skin blemishes, or for producing an opaque film. Individuals suffering<br>
from xeroderma pigmentosum may benefit from a long-lasting opaque sunscreen having a high<br>
SPF value. Such individuals may benefit from a multilayer film, whether the films are of the<br>
same composition or of different compositions.<br>
Preferably, the resin is shellac, the alcohol is denatured ethanol, the oil is castor oil (7-<br>
20% w/w) or a mixture of castor oil (7-15% w/w) and rosehip oil (0.1-5% w/w), the cellulosic<br>
preparation is ethyl cellulose, and the sunscreen agent is zinc oxide having a particle size of<br>
between about 5-100 nm.<br>
Preferably, the preferred form further comprises about 0.5-1% w/w preservative, such<br>
as BHT.<br>
Preferably, the preferred form further comprises about 0.5-5% w/w vitamin E acetate.<br>
According to a sixth aspect of the present invention, there is provided a therapeutic<br>
composition for skin, said composition comprising resin, flexibilizer and at least one<br>
therapeutic agent, wherein upon application to skin, said composition forms a waterproof<br>
therapeutic flexible film.<br>
According to a seventh aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for<br>
prevent or treating a disorder of the skin, said method comprising the step of applying to the<br>
skin a composition comprising resin, flexibilizer and at least one therapeutic agent, wherein<br>
upon application to skin, said composition forms a waterproof therapeutic flexible film.<br>
According to an eighth aspect of the present invention, there is provided the use of a<br>
composition in the preparation of a medicament for the prevention or treatment of a skin<br>
disorder, said composition comprising resin, flexibilizer and at least one therapeutic agent,<br>
wherein said composition forms a waterproof therapeutic flexible film when applied to skin.<br>
Any suitable type of therapeutic agent may be used. The composition may include one or more<br>
therapeutic agents. A suitable therapeutic agent may be an antimicrobial such as a bactericide<br>
or fungicide. Another suitable therapeutic agent may promote wound healing or have anti-<br><br>
inflammatory properties. Yet another suitable therapeutic agent may be a steroid for treating<br>
eczema or dermatitis. Such therapeutic agents are well known in the art. Examples of suitable<br>
therapeutic agents include vitamins, such as vitamin E, and rosehip oil. Examples of suitable<br>
growth factors are described, for example, in the specification published as WO92/09301 to<br>
the American National Red Cross.<br>
The therapeutic composition may include a pigment and/or dye for coating<br>
discoloured skin or skin blemishes and/or a sunscreen agent.<br>
As mentioned above, each of the above compositions may be formulated for<br>
application to the skin, for example, as a paste, cream, gel, liquid or aerosol. The composition<br>
may be applied by way of a sponge, brush or spray. The colour, strength, flexibility, plasticity,<br>
stability, opacity, viscosity may be readily optimised by adjusting the quantity of each<br>
ingredient of the composition. The same coating composition or different coating compositions<br>
may be applied to the skin in two or more layers, so as to achieve an optimal effect.<br>

carcinomas, pigment-related disorders, scars, burns, acne, veins, tattoos, eczema, dermatitis<br>
and bruising. The composition can be specifically colour tailored to the needs of an individual.<br>
In order to formulate an appropriate coloured coating composition for coating a skin<br>
blemish, several readings of colour (hue, chroma and lightness) were taken from the skin<br>
blemish and normal skin surrounding the skin blemish using a spectrophotometer, the<br>
procedure for which is described in detail in the applicant's co-pending International Patent<br>
Application entitled "A Colour Compensating System". Colour readings were taken from the<br>
darkest region of the skin blemish and averaged. Colour readings were also taken from normal<br>
skin surrounding the skin blemish and averaged.<br>
A computer database was then interrogated. The computer database contained<br>
information relating to the colour properties of the blemish and the colour properties of the<br>
skin, as well as information relating to the appropriate colour properties of the coating<br>
composition to apply to the blemish such that the coated blemish exhibits the colour of the<br>
surrounding skin. The preferred coating compositions have a degree of translucency such that<br>
the colour of the coated skin blemish comprises the additive affects of the colour of the coating<br>
and the underlying colour of the blemish.<br>
The computer database may be used to select the coating composition. Alternatively,<br>
the computer database may provide information as to the desirable colour properties of the<br>
coating composition required to obtain the appropriate compensatory colour properties and this<br>
information may then be used to provide instructions to the user as to an appropriate coating<br>
composition to be prepared to obtain the desired compensatory colour properties.<br>
Once the desired coloured coating composition had been determined, that coating<br>
composition was made up from its basic ingredients.<br><br>
A. Preparation of Primary Pigment and Dye Dispersions<br>
A primary dispersion was made for each pigment and dye to be used in the coloured<br>
composition.<br>
Primary dispersions were prepared using one or more of the following pigments and<br>
dyes:<br>
•	Natural or synthetic iron oxides, black, red, yellow, brown, blended in various<br>
ratios.<br>
•	Rutile titanium dioxide (micronised).<br>
•	Zinc oxide (micronised).<br>
•	Ultramarine blue (micronised).<br>
•	Mixed metal oxide (cobalt) blue, black, turquoise, green.<br>
•	Bon arymadide red pigments.<br>
•	Bon red (calcium).<br>
•	Rubine toners.<br>
•	Arylamide yellows.<br>
•	Transparent iron oxide pigments.<br>
•	Phthalocyanine blues.<br>
•	Dioxazine violets.<br>
•	Pearlescent pigments in various colours, including white, copper, bronze.<br>
•	Solvent dyes red, orange, yellow, blue, violet, brown, black.<br>
Such pigments and dyes (as well as other suitable pigments and dyes) are available<br>
from Redox Chemicals, Polyimpex, Avlo Australia, Clariant Australia, Shepherd International,<br>
Merk Australia, Ravenswood Australia, HCA Colours, Degussa Australia, Quantum<br>
Chemicals, Multichem, GCI Chemicals Australia, Orica Australia, Tradechem, Johnson and<br>
Mathey, Elementis, Bayer Chemicals Pty Ltd, BASF Australia, DIC International, APS<br>
Australia, and OMYA Southern.<br>
Each pigment or dye 5-60% w/w was individually mixed to balance with castor oil (to<br>
100% w/w) using a high-speed disperser for approximately 20 minutes, until the pigment or<br>
dye was fully wetted.<br><br>
Each resulting liquid/paste was processed through a bead mill or triple roll mill until a<br>
dispersion was achieved of less than 5 micron particle size. Particle size and agglomeration<br>
parameters were checked, e.g. using a Hegman guage. Each primary pigment and dye<br>
dispersion was then stored in a respective container.<br>
B. Preparation of a Film Forming Composition<br>
Shellac in both solid and liquid form is available from Redox Chemicals, Avlo<br>
Australia as well as from Quantum Chemicals. There are many forms of natural shellac<br>
available which vary greatly in colour from dark amber to blonde honey colour. A bleached<br>
version was used to give minimum coloration to the coloured composition.<br>
De-waxed (blonde) shellac flakes 28% w/w were added slowly to ethanol 55 % w/w<br>
and stirred until all of the shellac had dissolved. The solution was strained through a 10 micron<br>
filter cloth and then the following ingredients were added: ethyl cellulose 4% w/w; castor oil<br>
4% w/w; inorganic thixotrope 4% w/w; preservatives 2% w/w and ethanol to 100% w/w.<br>
A suitable preservative may include, for example, one or more of the following:<br>
butylated hydroxytoluene, butylated hydroxyanisole, hydroquinone and methylhydroquinone.<br>
Such preservatives may be obtained from Multichem, Redox Chemicals, APS Australia,<br>
Quantum Chemicals and Johnson Mathey.<br>
The solution was stirred with gentle heating until all of the solids had dissolved and<br>
then strained through a 10 micron filter cloth. The solution was then stored in a container.<br>
C.	Preparation of a Blend of Primary Pigment and Dye Dispersions<br>
From the computer/spectrophotometer prediction, select primary pigment and dye<br>
dispersions (from part A.) were blended together using a high-speed mixer until homogenous -<br>
eg. white ("vehicle") 86.16% w/w, black 03.77% w/w, red 0.58% w/w, yellow ochre 10.88%<br>
w/w. A white base (vehicle) was usually prepared from a dispersion of zinc oxide or titanium<br>
dioxide.<br>
D.	Preparation of a Coloured Film Forming Coating Composition<br>
A final coloured film forming coating composition was then prepared as follows:<br>
blend of pigment and dye dispersions (from part C.)	12% w/w<br>
film forming composition (from part B.)	88% w/w<br>
The coloured coating composition was mixed vigorously and then applied to skin<br>
using brushing, sponging, or airbrushing.<br><br>
The composition may be readily applied to large skin areas using an airbrush gun. For<br>
airbrushing, the final coloured film forming composition 30% volume by volume (v/v) may be<br>
diluted in ethanol 70% v/v. The composition is preferably applied to the skin in a cross-<br>
hatching manner.<br>
For brushing or sponging, the coloured film forming composition may be used<br>
without dilution. A sponge having pores of an appropriate size can produce a stippled effect on<br>
the skin. The skin is usually cleaned with soapy water (to remove oils and chemical residues)<br>
prior to applying the composition.<br>
Figure 1 shows a patient 1 having a port wine stain 2 extending over her arm 3, neck 4<br>
and chest 5. Figure 2 shows the same patient 1 but with the port wine stain 2 coated with a<br>
coloured composition prepared in accordance with Example 1.<br>
Example 2 - Preparation of a Coloured Film Forming Coating Composition<br>
and Use Thereof for Coating a Skin Blemish<br>
This example describes the preparation of another preferred coloured coating<br>
composition and its use in coating a skin blemish such that the blemish has the appearance of<br>
normal skin surrounding the blemish.<br>
A. Preparation of Primary Pigment and Dye Dispersions<br>
A primary dispersion was made for each pigment and dye to be used in the coloured<br>
composition. Primary dispersions were prepared as described in part A. of Example 1 except<br>
that the quantity of each pigment or dye varied and was balanced to 100% w/w using triple<br>
refined castor oil.<br>
B. Preparation of a Film Forming Composition<br>
A film forming composition was prepared as described in part B. of Example 1 except<br>
that the composition comprised:<br>
de-waxed (blonde) shellac flakes	10.37% w/w;<br>
ethyl cellulose	6.10% w/w;<br>
castor oil	13.34% w/w;<br>
rosehip oil	0.99% w/w;<br>
BHT	1.23% w/w;<br><br>
fumed silica	4.17% w/w; and<br>
ethanol	63.80% w/w.<br>
C.	Preparation of a Blend of Primary Pigment and Dye Dispersions<br>
As described in part C. of Example 1, select primary pigment and dye dispersions<br>
(from part A.) were blended together.<br>
D.	Preparation of a Coloured Film Forming Coating Composition<br>
A final coloured film forming coating composition was then prepared as follows:<br>
blend of pigment and dye dispersions (from part C.)	12% w/w<br>
film forming composition (from part B.)	88% w/w<br>
The coloured coating composition was mixed and then applied to skin using brushing,<br>
sponging, or airbrushing. For airbrushing, the final coloured film forming composition 30%<br>
volume by volume (v/v) may be diluted in ethanol 70% v/v.<br>
Shellac, ethyl cellulose, castor oil, fumed silica and ethanol are the minimum<br>
ingredients required to form the film.<br>
If a matte effect is desired, a fixing powder may be further applied to the coated skin.<br>
The fixing powder may be initially applied by sponge immediately after application of the<br>
composition and then reapplied after washing the skin. The fixing powder comprised:<br>
92.99% w/w talc;<br>
4.65% w/w zinc stearate;<br>
1.43% w/w silicone oil; and<br>
0.93 % w/w Unigerm G2™ (a mixture of methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylene<br>
glycol and mydazolidinyl urea).<br>
Example 3 - Preparation of a Film Forming Sunscreen Composition<br>
and the Use Thereof<br>
This example describes the preparation of a sunscreen composition and the use<br>
thereof. The sunscreen composition may protect individuals from premature ageing of skin,<br>
skin cancer and other harmful effects of solar radiation. Since the sunscreen film is long-<br>
lasting and has a high SPF value, it will be of particular use to those who are exposed to<br>
sunlight for long periods of time (e.g. sportsmen).<br><br>
A. Preparation of a Film Forming Composition<br>
De-waxed (blonde) shellac flakes 28% w/w were added slowly to ethanol 55% w/w<br>
and stirred until all of the shellac had dissolved. The solution was strained through a 10 micron<br>
filter cloth and then the following ingredients were added: ethyl cellulose 4% w/w; castor oil<br>
4% w/w; inorganic thixotrope 4% w/w; preservatives 2% w/w and ethanol to 100% w/w. The<br>
solution was stirred with gentle heating until all of the solids had dissolved and then strained<br>
through a 10 micron filter cloth. The solution was stored in a container.<br>
B. Preparation of a Nano Zinc Oxide Dispersion<br>
Inorganic zinc oxide was milled to a nano scale, of less then 100nm particle size.<br>
High energy milling in dry form was used to induce chemical reactions during ball-powder<br>
collisions to form nano particles in a solid-state matrix.<br>
Agglomeration was minimized by ensuring that the particles were encapsulated on<br>
formation by a solid diluent phase (typically sodium chloride). The solid diluent phase was<br>
removed by a basic washing technique. This process formed equiaxed nano particles with a<br>
very narrow size distribution and very low levels of agglomeration.<br>
The solid diluent phase allowed the particles to be heat treated without any<br>
agglomeration occurring. The heat treatment step ensured the product was completely reacted,<br>
removed all residual chemicals and stabilized the surfaces of the particles. The stabilized<br>
surfaces assisted in decreasing the reactivity of the particles, which aided in the subsequent<br>
dispersion in both aqueous and non-aqueous phases, and limited the generation of free radicals.<br>
Zinc oxide becomes transparent when processed to nano particle size but still retains<br>
its UV protection properties. Due to its high refractive indices, zinc oxide blocks UV by both<br>
scattering and band gap absorption. A 20-40nm particle size was selected to provide broad<br>
spectrum UVB and UVA protection with maximum transparency in excess of 80%.<br>
Dry milled 20-40nm zinc oxide (40% w/w) was added slowly to the film forming<br>
composition of part A. (60% w/w) and mixed for a minimum of 20 minutes until a<br>
homogenous dispersion had been produced. The nano zinc oxide dispersion was then strained<br>
through a 10 micron filter cloth and stored in a container.<br>
C. Preparation of a Film Forming Sunscreen Composition<br>
A final film-forming sunscreen composition was made up as follows and mixed<br>
vigorously before application to the skin:<br><br>
film forming composition (of part A.)	70% w/w<br>
nano zinc oxide dispersion (of part B.) 30% w/w<br>
The sunscreen composition was then applied using brushing, sponging, or airbrushing.<br>
Example 4 - Sun Protection Factor Value of a Sunscreen Composition<br>
Containing Micronised Zinc Oxide<br>
A coloured coating composition was prepared in accordance with Example 1 and had<br>
the colour blend: blue 0.60% w/w; red 0.53% w/w; yellow ochre 11.25% w/w; and white<br>
(vehicle) 47.60% w/w. Since the vehicle comprised micronised zinc oxide, the coloured<br>
coating composition also functioned as a sunscreen.<br>
The composition was analysed using a Labsphere SPF Analyser with the following<br>
parameters:<br>
•	substrate: MimSkin ® on quartz<br>
•	film thickness: 2mg/cm2<br>
•	number of scans: 10<br>
•	UVBAJVA cut off: 320 nm<br>
The results are summarised in the following tables:<br>
Brush application - single film layer<br><br>
The final table shows that multilayering the film on skin (four layers) is likely to<br>
provide a much higher SPF value, in this case being 1216.65. Figure 3 is a plot of percentage<br>
transmittance versus wavelength for the composition when applied as four layers, and indicates<br>
that the composition can provide broad UV protection.<br><br>
Example 5 - Preparation of a Film Forming Therapeutic Sunscreen Composition<br>
This example describes the preparation of a preferred therapeutic sunscreen<br>
composition.<br>
A film forming composition was prepared as described in parts A., B. and C. of<br>
Example 3 except that the final composition comprised:<br>
de-waxed (blonde) shellac flakes	12.96% w/w;<br>
ethyl cellulose	7.79% w/w;<br>
castor oil	1.14% w/w;<br>
rosehip oil	0.50% w/w;<br>
BHT	1.00% w/w;<br>
vitamin E acetate	0.50% w/w;<br>
nano zinc oxide (Zinclear™)	34.40%; and<br>
ethanol	41.44% w/w.<br>
Shellac, ethyl cellulose, castor oil, nano zinc oxide and ethanol are the minimum<br>
ingredients required to form the film.<br>
The composition contains the therapeutic agent vitamin E acetate. This agent is an<br>
antioxidant and can decrease the effects of psoriasis, erythema and scaring from wounds. If<br>
desired, other therapeutic agents (eg. growth factors, steroids) may be used in the composition.<br>
Example 6 - Sun Protection Factor Value of a Sunscreen Composition<br>
Containing Nano Zinc Oxide<br>
The therapeutic composition of Example 5 was analysed using a Labsphere SPF<br>
Analyser with the following parameters:<br>
•	substrate: MimSkin ® on quartz<br>
•	rub-in method<br>
•	film thickness: 2mg/cm2<br>
•	number of scans: 10<br>
•	UVB/UVA cut off: 320 nm<br>
The results are summarised in the following tables:<br>
Pre photodegradation<br><br><br>
Figure 4 is a plot of percentage transmittance versus wavelength for the composition<br>
when applied as a single layer. As for the composition tested in Example 4, multilayering the<br>
film on skin (four layers) provided a much higher (and more than additive) SPF value, and<br>
provided broad UV protection (results not shown).<br>
Example 7 - Sun Protection Factor Value of a Coloured Sunscreen Composition<br>
A coloured coating composition was prepared in accordance with Example 2.<br>
The following primary dispersions were prepared (to 100% w/w balance with castor<br>
oil):<br>
black iron oxide (Elementis)	25% w/w<br>
rubine bright red (Polyimpex)	20% w/w<br>
white (Tronox® CR-828 titanium dioxide)	50% w/w<br>
yellow ochre	40% w/w<br>
The following primary dispersion quantities were mixed with 44g of the film forming<br>
composition described in part B. of Example 2:0.03g black iron oxide; 0.07g rubine bright<br>
red; 4.13g white; and 1.48g yellow ochre.<br>
Since the composition contained titanium dioxide, the coloured coating composition<br>
could also function as a sunscreen.<br>
The composition, applied in 1 to 4 layers, was analysed using a Labsphere SPF<br>
Analyser with the following parameters:<br>
•	substrate: MimSkin ® on quartz<br>
•	rub-in method<br>
•	film thickness: 2mg/cm2<br>
•	number of scans: 10<br>
•	UVB/UVA cut off: 320 nm<br>
The results are summarised in the following tables:<br>
Spray application - single film layer<br><br><br>
The final table shows that multilayering the film on skin (four layers) is likely to<br>
provide a much higher SPF value, in this case being 115.21. Figures 5-8 are plots of<br>
percentage transmittance versus wavelength for the composition when applied as one to four<br>
layers, respectively, and indicate that the composition can provide broad UV protection.<br>
