The present invnetion relates to alkaline raannases from Bacillus Sp specifically to microbial enzymes exhibiting mannanase activity as their major enzymatic activity in the neutral ar;c alkaline cH ranges; to a method of producing such enzymes; and tc net.-.cds for using such enzymes in the paper and pulp, textile, cii drilling, cleaning, laundering, detergent and cellulose finer processing industries.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Mannar, containing polysaccharides are a major component cf cne hemice.lulose fraction in woods and endosperm m many leguminous seeds and in some ma:ure seeds of non-leguminous plants. Essentially unsubstituted linear beta-1,4-mannan is found in some r.-r,-leguminous plants. Unsubstituted beta-1,4-mar.nan which is present e.g. in ivory nuts resembles cellulose in the conformation cf the individual polysaccharide chains, and is water-insoluble. In leguminous seeds, water-scluble galactcmannan is the main storage carbohydrate comprising up to 20% cf the total dry weight. Galactcmannans have a linear beta-1,4-m.anna.n backbone substituted with single alpha-1, 6-galactcse, optionally substituted with acetyl groups. Mannans are also found in several monoootyledonous plants and are the most abundant polysaccharides in the cell wail material in palm kernel meal. Glucomannans are linear polysaccharides with a backbone of beta-1,4-linked mannose and glucose alternating in a more or less regular manner, the backbone optionally being substituted with galactose and/or acetyl groups. Mannans, galactcmannans, glucomannans and galactoglucomannans ;i.e. glucomannan backbones with branched galactose) contribute to more than 50% of the softwood hemicellulose. Moreover, the<br><br>
cellulose of many red algae certains a significant amount of mannose.<br>
Mannanases have  been identified in several Bacillus organisms. For example, Talbot et al., Appl. Environ. Microbiol., Vol.56, Nc. 11, pp. 3505-3510 (1990) describes a. beta-mannanase derived from Bacillus  stearothermophilics in dimer form having molecular weight of 162 kDa and an optimum pH of 5.5-7.5. Mendcza et al., World J. Microbiol. Biotech., Vol. 10, No. 5, pp. 551-555 (1994) describes a beta-manr.anase derived from Bacillus   subcilis   having a molecular weight of 3S kDa, an optimum activity at pH 5.0 and 55°C and a pi of 4.8. JP-A-03047076 discloses a beta-rr.ar.nanase derived from Bacillus   sp., having a molecular weight of 37±3 kDa measured by gel filtration, an optimum pH of 8-10 and a pi of 5.3-5.4. J?-A-63056289 describes the production of an alkaline, thermostable beta-mannanase which hydrolyses beta-1,4-D-mannopyranoside bonds of e.g. mannans and produces manno-oligosaccharides. JP-A- ■ 63036775 relates to the Bacillus microorganism FERM P-8356 which produces beta-mannanase and beta-mannosidase at an alkaline pK. JP-A-08051975 discloses alkaline beta-mannanases from alkalophilic Bacillus   sp.   AM-001 having molecular weights of 43±3 kDa and 57±3 kDa and optimum pH of 8-10. A purified mannanase from Bacillus  amylcliquafaciens  useful in the bleaching of pulp and paper and a method of preparation thereof is disclosed in WO 97/11164. WO 91/18974 describes a hemicellulase such as a glucanase, xylanase or mannanase active at an extreme pH and temperature. WO 94/25576 discloses an enzyme from Aspergillus aculaatus,   CBS 101.43, exhibiting mannanase activity which may be useful for degradation or modification of plant or algae cell wall materiali WO 93/24622 discloses a mannanase isolated from Trichoderma   reseei  useful for bleaching iignocellulosic pulps.<br><br>
WG 95/35362 discloses cleaning compositions containing plan- cell wall degrading enzymes having pectinase ar.d/cr hemicellulase and optionally cellulase activity for the re-oval of stains of vegetable origin and further discloses an alkaline mannanase fro™ the strain C11SB.G17.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a novel and efficient enzyme exhibiting mannanase activity also in the alkaline pH range, e.g. when applied in cleaning compositions or different industrial orocesses.<br>

DEFINITIONS<br>
Prior to discussing this invention in further detail, the following terir.s will first be defined.<br>
The tern*. v,ortholog" (or "species homolog") denotes s polypeptide or protein obtained from one species that has homol¬ogy to an analogous polypeptide or protein from a'different species.<br>
The term "paraloc" denotes a polypeptide cr protein obtained from a given species that has homology to a distinct polypeptide or protein from that same species.<br>
The term "expression vector" denotes a DNA molecule, linear or circular, that comprises a segment encoding a polypeptide cf interest operably linked to additional segments that provide for its transcription. Such additional segments may include promoter and terminator sequences, and may optionally include one or mere origins of replication, one or more selectable markers, an enhancer, a poiyadenylation signal, and the like.  Expression sectors are generally derived from plas-rdd or viral DHA, cr may contain elements cf both. The expression vector of the invention nay be any expression vector that is conveniently subjected to recombinant DNA procedures, and the choice of vector will often lepend on the host ceil into which the vector is to be ntroduced. Thus, the vector may be an autonomously replicating ector, i.e. a vector which exists as an extrachrcmosomal ntity, the replication of which is independent cf chromosomal eplication, e.g. a plasmid. Alternatively, the vector may be ne which, when introduced into a host ceil, is integrated into he host cell genome and replicated together with the hrornosome (s) into which it has been integrated.<br>
The term "recombinant expressed" or "recombinantly expressed" used herein in connection with expression cf a<br><br>
polypeptide or crcte:r: is defined according no the standard definition in the art. Re conic inantly expression cf a protein is generally performed oy using an expression vector as described immediately abcve. ;    The term "isolated", when applied to a polynucleotide mole¬cule, denotes that tr.e polynucleotide has been removed from its natural genetic milieu and is thus free of other extraneous or unwanted coding sequences, and is in a form suitable for use within genetically engineered orotein production systems.  Such isolated molecules are those that are separated from their natural environment and include cDNA and genomic clones.  Iso¬lated DMA molecules cf the present invention are free of other genes with which they are ordinarily associated, but may include naturally occurring 5' and 3' untranslated regions such as promoters and terminators.  The identification of associated regions will be evident to one   of ordinary skill in the art (see for example, Dynan and Tijan, Nature 316_:114-78, 1985).  The term "an isolated polynucleotide" may alternatively be termed "a cloned polynucleotide".<br>
When applied to a protein/polypeptide, the term "isolated" indicates that the protein is found in a condition other than its native environment. In a preferred form, the isolated pro¬tein is substantially free cf other proteins, particularly other homologous proteins (i.e. "homologous impurities" (see below)). It is preferred to provide the protein in a greater than 40% pure form, more preferably greater than 60% pure form.<br>
Even more preferably it is preferred to provide the protein in a highly purified form, i.e., greater than 8G% pure, more preferably greater than 95% pure, and even more preferably greater than 99% pure, as determined by SDS-PAGE.<br>
The term "isolated protein/polypeptide may alternatively be termed "purified protein/polypeptide".<br><br>
Tiie term "homologous impurities" means any invcurity (e.g. an¬other polypeptide zr.ar-   tne pelypeotide of the ir.vendor) which originate from the homologous ceil where the polypeptide of the invention is originally obtained from.<br>
The terrr. "obtained from" as used herein in connection with a specific microbial source, means that the polynucleotide and/or polypeptide is produced by the specific source (homologous expression), or by a cell in which 3 gene from the source have beer, inserted (heterologous expression) .<br>
The term "cperably linked", when referring to DMA segments, denotes that the segments are arranged so that they function in concert for their intended purposes, e.g. transcription initi¬ates in the promoter and proceeds through the coding segment to the terminator<br>
The term, "polynucleotide" denotes a single- or dcuble-stranded polymer of ceoKVribonucleotide cr ribonucleotide bases read from the 5' to tne 3' end.  Polynucleotides include RNA and DNA, and may be isolated from natural sources, synthesized in vitro, or prepared from a combination of natural and synthetic molecules.<br>
The term "complements' of polynucleotide molecules" denotes polynucleotide molecules having a complementary base sequence and reverse orientation as compared to a   reference sequence. For example, the sequence 5' ATGCACGGG 3' is complementary to 5' CCCGTGCAT 3'.<br>
The term "degenerate nucleotide sequence" denotes a sequence of nucleotides that includes one or more degenerate codons (as compared to a reference polynucleotide molecule that encodes a polypeptide). Degenerate codons contain different triplets of nucleotides, but encode the same amino acid residue (i.e., GAU and GAC triplets each encode Asp) .<br><br>
The ;srn "promoter" denotes a portion cf a gene contair.ir.a<br>
DMA sequences that provide fcr the binding of RNA polymerase and<br>
initiation of transcription.  promoter sequences are commonly,<br>
but not always, four.d in the 51 nor.-coding regions of genes.<br>
\	The tern "secretory signal sequence" denotes a DK'A sequence<br>
that encodes a polypeptide (a "secretory peptide") that, as a component of a larger polypeptide, directs the larger polypep¬tide through a secretory pathway cf a ceil in whicn. it is syn¬thesized.  The larger peptide is commonly cleaved to remove the secretory peptide during transit through the secretory pathway.<br>
The term "enzyme core" denotes a single domain enzyme which may or may not have been modified, or altered, but which has retained its original activity; the catalytic domain as known in the art has remained intact and functional.<br>
By the term "linker" or "spacer" is meant a polypeptide comprising at least two amino acids which may be present between the domains of a nvuitiaomain protein, for example.an enzyme comprising an enzyme core and a binding domain such as a cellulose binding domain (CBD) or any other enzyme hybrid, or between two proteins or polypeptides expressed as a fusion polypeptide, for example a fusion protein comprising two core enzymes. For example, the fusion protein cf an enzyme core with a CBD is provided by fusing a DNA sequence encoding the enzyme core, a DNA sequence encoding the linker and a DNA sequence encoding the CBD sequentially into one open reading frame and expressing this construct.<br>
The term "manr.sr.ase" or "galactomar.r.anase" denotes a rran-nanase enzyme defined according to the art as officially being named mar.nan endc-1,4-beta-mannosidase and having the alterna¬tive names beta-mannanase and endo-1,4-mannanase and catalysing hydrolyses of 1,4-beta-D-mannosidic linkages in mannans, galac-tomannans, glucomannans, and galactoglucomannans which enzyme<br><br>

Percent sequence identity is determined by conventional nethods, by means of computer programs known in the art such as GAP provided in the GCG program package (Program Manual for the Wisconsin Package, Version 8, August 1994, Genetics Computer 3roup, 575 Science Drive, Madison, Wisconsin, USA 53711) as iisclosed in Keedleman, S.B. and Wunsch, CD., (1S7C), Journal Df Molecular Biology, 4S, 443-453, which is hereby incorporated uy reference in its entirety. GAP is used with the following settings for polypeptide sequence comparison: GAP creation penalty of 3.0 and GAP extension penalty of 0.1.<br><br>

Substantially homologous proteins and polypeptides are char¬acterized as having one or more amino acid substitutions, dele¬tions or additions. These changes are preferably of a minor nature, that is conservative ammo acid substitutions (see Table 2) and other substitutions that do not significantly affect the folding or activity of the protein or polypeptide; small dele-tions, typically of one to about 3C amir.o acids; and small amino- or carboxyl-terminal extensions, such as an ammo-terminal methionine residue, a small linker peptide of up to about 20-25 residues, or a small extension that facilitates purification (an affinity tag), such as a pcly-histidine tract, protein A (Nilsson et ai., EMEO J, j_:1075, 1955; Nilsson et a!., Methods Enzymol. 198;3, 1991. See, in general Ford et ai., Protein Expression and Purification 2_:    95-107, 1991, which is incorporated herein by reference. DMAs encoding affinity tags are available from commercial suppliers {e.g., Pharmacia Bio¬tech, Piscataway, NJ; New England Eiclabs, Beverly, MA).<br>
However, even though the changes described above preferably are of a minor nature, such changes may also be of a larger nature such as fusion of larger polypeptides of up to 300 amino acids or more both as amino- or carboxyl-terminal extensions to a Mannanase polypeptide of the invention.<br>

A limited number of non-conservative amino acids, amino acids that are net encoded by the genetic code, and unnatural amino acids may be substituted for amino acid resi¬dues. "Unnatural amino acids" have been modified after protein synthesis, and/cr have a chemical structure in their side chain{s) different from that of the standard amino acids. Unnatural amino acids can be chemically synthesized, or prefera¬bly, are commercially available, and include pipecolic acid, thiazolidine carboxylic acid, dehydroproline, 3- and 4-methylproline, and 3,3-dimethylproline.<br>
Essential amino acids in the mannanase polypeptides cf the present invention can be identified according to procedures known in the art, such as site-directed mutagenesis or alanine-scanning mutagenesis (Cunningham and Wells, Science 244: 1081-1065, 1989). In the latter technique, single alanine mutations are introduced at every residue in the molecule, and the resul-<br><br>
tant mutant molecules are tested :or biclccica. activity (i.e mannanase activity) to identify a^ino acio residues that are critical to the activity of the molecule. See also, Hilton et al" J- Bic'^Cnenu 2^1:4699-4 708, 1996. The active site of the enzyme or other biological interaction can also be determined by physical analysis of structure, as determined by such techniques as nuclear magnetic resonance, crystallography, electron dif¬fraction or phoccaffinity labeling, in conjunction with mutation of putative contact site ammo acias.  See, for example, de Vos et al., Science 2J^:3C6-212, 1992; Smith et al. , J. Mel. Biol. 22_4_:899-9G4, 1992; Wlccaver et al . , FEBS Lett. 309:59-64, 1992.<br>
The identities of essential amino acids can also be inferred from analysis of homologies with polypeptides which are related to a polypeptide according to the invention.<br>
Multiple an-inc acio substitutions car. be made and tested us¬ing known methods of mutagenesis, recombination and/cr shuffling followed by a relevant screening procedure, such as those dis¬closed by Reidhaar-Olscr. and Sauer (Science 241:53-57, 1988), Bowie and Sauer (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA £6:2152-2156, 1989), W095/17413, or WO 95/22625. Briefly, these authors disclose methods for simultaneously randomizing two or more positions in a polypeptide, or recombination/shuffling of different mutations (W095/17413, W095/22625/, followed by selecting for functional a polypeptide, and then sequencing the mutagenized polypeptides to determine the spectrum of allowable substitutions at each posi¬tion. Other methods that can be used include phage display (e.g., Lowman et al., Ei^cher^ 30_: 10832-108 37, 1991; Ladner et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,223,409; Huse, WIPO Publication WO 92/06204) and region-directed mutagenesis (Derbyshire et al., 3ene 15:145, 1986; Ker et al., DNA 7:127, 1988) . '<br>
Mutagenesis/shuffling methods as disclosed above can be com¬bined with high-throughput, automated screening methods to<br><br>
aezecz   activity cf cloned, mutagemzed polypeptides in host cells. Mu-age-ized DMA molecules chat encode ac:ive polypeptides can be recovered frorr, the host cells and rapidly sequenced   usina modern equipment. These methods allow the rapic ae:er^nat::or. of the importance cf individual ammo acid residues :r. ~   polypep¬tide of interest, ana can be applied to polypeptides cf unknown structure.<br>
Using the methods discussed above, one of crdinarv sstill in the art can identify ar.c/or prepare a variety of polypeptides that are substantially homologous to residues 23-340 cr 33-490 of SEQ ID NO:2; cr to residues 32-344 or 32-494 of SEQ ID NO: 6; or tc residues 32-362 cr32-5S6 of SEQ ID MO:10; or to residues 33-331 of SEQ ID N0:12; or to residues 166-488 or.22-483 cf SEQ' ID MO:14; cr to residues 63-369 cr 32-369 of SEQ ID NO:16; cr tc residues 1-305 of SEQ ID NO:18; cr to residues 1-132 cf SEQ ID NO:20; or to residues 29-320 of SEQ ID K0:22; cr to residues 29-188 of SEQ ID NO:24; or to residues 301-625 or 30-625 of SEQ ID -]0:26; or to residues 166-496 cr 38-496 of SEQ ID NO:28; or tc residues 26-361 of SEQ ID NO:30; cr to residues 593-903 or 23-303 of SEQ ID NO:32 and retain the mannanase activity of the jiId-type protein.<br>
The mannanase enzyme of the invention may, in addition to the enzyme core comprising the catalytically domain., also com¬prise a cellulose binding domain (CBD), the cellulose binding domain and enzyme core (the catalytically active domain) of the enzyme being operably linked. The cellulose binding domain (CBD) may exist as an integral part of the encoded enzyme, or a CBD from another origin may be introduced into the msr.nan de¬grading enzyme thus creating an enzyme hybrid. In this context, the tern "cellulose-binding domain" is intended to be under¬stood as defined by Peter Tomme et ai. '■'Cellulose-Bindirig Do-mains: Classification and Properties" in "Enzymatic Degradation<br><br>
cf Insoluble Carbohydrates", John K. Saddler and Michael K. Penner (Eds.), ACS Symposium Series, No. 613, 1996. This defi¬nition classifies more t.nan 120 cellulose-binding dorrains ;ntc 10 families ji-X), and demonstrates 'hat CBDs are found in various enzymes such as cellulases, xylanases, j.annar.ases, arabinofurancsidases, acetyl esterases and chitinases. CBCs have also beer, found in algae, e.g. the red alga Porphyra  cur-pursa  as a non-hydrolytic poiysaccharide-binding protein, see Tomme en al., cp.cit.   However, most of the CBDs are from cellu-lases and xyiar.ases, CEDs are found at the N and C termini of proteins cr are internal. Enzyme hybrids are known in the art, see e.g. WC 90/CC60S and "WC 95/16782, and may be prepared by transforming into a host cell a DMA construct comprising at least a fragment of DMA encoding the cellulose-binding domain ligated, with or without a linker, to a DMA sequence encoding the mannan degrading enzyme and growing the host cell to ex¬press the fused gene. Enzyme hybrids may be described by the following formula:<br>
C3D - MR - X ■wherein CBD is the N-terminal or the C-termir.al region of an amino acid sequence corresponding to at least the cellulose-binding domain; MR is the middle region (the linker), and may be a bond, or a short linking group preferably cf from about 2 to about 100 carbon atoms, more preferably of from 2 to 40 carbon atoms; or is preferably from about 2 to to about 100 amino acids, more preferably cf from 2 to 4 0 amino acids; and X is an N-terminal or C-terminal region of the mannanase of the invention.

Techniques for manipulating cloned DNA molecules and intro¬ducing exogenous DNA into a variety of host cells are disclosed by Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning:  A Laboratory Manual, 2nd ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, 1989; Ausubel et al. (eds.), Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., NY, 198"; and "Bacillus subtilis and Other Gram-Positive Bacteria", Sonensheim et al., 1993, American Society, for Microbiology, Washington D.C., which ire incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In general, a DNA sequence encoding a mannanase cf the pres¬ent invention is operabiy linked to other genetic elements<br><br>
required for its expression, Generally including a transcripticr. promoter and terminattr within an expression vector. The vectc-will also commonly contain one or more selectable markers and one cr more origins cf replication, althougn those skilled in the art will recognize that within certain systems selectable markers may be provided on separate vectors, and replication of the exogenous DMA may be provided by integration into the host cell genome.  Selection of promoters, terminators; selectable markers, vectors and ether elements is a matter of routine design within the level cf ordinary skill in the art. Many such elements are describee in the literature and are available through commercial supoiiers.<br>
To direct a polypeptide into the secretory pathway of a host cell, a secretory signal sequence (also known as a leader se-<br>
i<br>
; quence, prepro sequence cr pre sequence) is provided in the expression vector. The secretory signal sequence may be that ox the Doiypeptide, or mav be derived from another secreted protein or synthesized de novo.   Numerous suitable secretory signal sequences are known in the art and reference is made to "Bacillus subtilis and Other Gram-Positive Bacteria", Soner.sheim et al., 1993, American Society for Microbiology, Washington D.C.; and Cutting, S. M.(eds.) "Molecular Biological Methods for Bacillus", John Wiley and Sons, 1990, for further description of suitable secretory signal sequences especially fcr secretion in a Bacillus host cell. Tne  secretory signal sequence is joined to the  DNA sequence in the correct reading frame. Secretory signa_ sequences are commonly positioned 51 to the DMA sequence encod¬ing the polypeptide of interest, although certain•signal se¬quences may be positioned elsewhere in the DNA sequence cf interest (see, e.g., Welch et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,037,743; Holland et al., u.S. Patent No. 5,143,830).<br><br>
The expression vector cf the invention may be any expression vector that is conveniently subjected to recombinant DNA procedures, and the choice of vector will often depend on the host cell into which the vector it is to be introduced. Thus, the vector may be an autonomously replicating vector, i.e. a vector which exists as an extrachromosomai entity, the replication of which is independent of chromosomal replication, e.g. a plasmid. Alternatively, the vector may be one which, when introduced into a host cell, is integrated into the host ceil genome and replicated together with the chromosome(si into which it has been integrated.<br>
Examples cf suitable promoters for use in filamentous fungus host cells are, e.g. the ADK3 promoter (McKnight et al., The EMBO J.   4, (1985), 2053 - 2099) or the tpiA promoter. Examples of other useful promoters are those derived from, the gene encoding Aspergillus cryzae  TARA amylase, Rhizcmucor miekei aspartic proteinase, Aspergillus  niger  neutral a-amylase, Aspergillus niger  acid stable a-amylase, Aspergillus niger  or Aspergillus  a.wamori  glucoamylase (giuA) , Rhizomucor miehei lipase, Aspergillus cryzae  alkaline protease, Aspergillus   oryzae triose phosphate isomerase or Aspergillus  nidulans  acetamidase.<br>
Transformed or transfected host cells are cultured according to conventional procedures in a culture medium containing nutri¬ents and other components required for the growth cf the chosen host cells. A variety of suitable media, including defined media and complex media, are known in the art and generally include a carbon source, a   nitrogen source, essential amino acids, vita¬mins and minerals. Media may also contain such components as growth factors or serum, as required. The growth medium will generally select for cells containing the exogenously added DNA by, for example, drug selection or deficiency in an essential<br><br>
nutrient which is complemented by the selectable marker carried en the expression vector cr co-trar.sf ected intc the host cell.<br>
PROTEIN ISOLATION 5     When the expressed reccmoir.ant polypeptide is secreted the polypeptide may be purified from the grow-!-, media. Preferably the expression host cells are removed from the media before purification of the polypeptide (e.g. by centrifugation!.<br>
When the expressed recombinant polypeptide rs nor secreted ' from the host ceil, the host cell are preferably disrupted and the polypeptide released into an aqueous "extract" which is the first stage of such purification techniques. Preferably the expression host cells are collected from the media before the cell disruption (e.g. by centrifugaticn).<br>
The cell disruption may be performed by conventional tech¬niques such as by iysczyme digestion or by forcing the cells through high pressure. See (Robert K. Scobes, Protein Purifica¬tion, Second edition, Springer-Verlag) for further description of such cell disruption techniques.<br>
Whether or not the expressed recombinant polypeptides (or chimeric polypeptides) is secreted or not it can be purified using fractionation and/or conventional purification methods and media.<br>
Ammonium sulfate precipitation and acid or chaotrope extrac¬tion may be used for fractionation of samples. Exemplary purifi¬cation steps may include hydroxyapatite, size exclusion, F?LC and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Suit¬able anion exchange media include derivatized dextrar.s, agarose, cellulose, polyacrylamide, specialty silicas, and the like. PEI, DEAE, QAE and Q derivatives are preferred, with DEAE Fast-Flow Sepharose [Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ) being particularly pre¬ferred. Exemplary chromatographic media include those media<br><br>
derivacizeo with phenyl, butyl, c: cctyi groups, sue:, as Pnsr.yl-Sepharose FF (Pnarmacia. , Toycpearl butyl E5C    (Tcsc Haas, Mont¬gomery-vine, FA;, Cctyi-Sepharose [Pharmacy] and-the like; or poiyacrylic resins, such as Amberchrom CG 71 (Toso Haas; and the like. Suitable solid supports include glass beads, silica-based resins, celiulosic resins, agarose beads, cross-linked agarose beads, polystyrene beads, cross-linked poiyacrylamide resins and the like that are insoluble under the conditions in which they are tc be usee. These supports may  be modified with reactive groups that allow attachment of proteins by amino groups, car-boxyl groups, sulfhydryl groups, hydroxyl groups and/or carbohy¬drate moieties. Examples of coupling chemistries include cyano¬gen bromide activation, N-r.ycrcxysuccinimide activation, epoxide activation, sulfhydryl activation, hydrazide activation, and carboxyi and ammo derivatives fcr carbodiimide coupling chemis¬tries. These and other solid media are well known and widely used in the art., and are available from commercial suppliers.<br>
Selection of a particular method is a matter of routine de¬sign and is determined in part by the properties of the chosen support. See, for example, Affinity Chromatography: Principles S Methods, Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology, Uppsala, Sweden, 1988.<br>
Polypeptides of the invention or fragments thereof may also be orepared through chemical synthesis. Polypeptides of the invention may be monomers cr multimers; glycosylated or non-Glycosylated; pegylated or non-pegylated; and may or may not include an initial methionine amino acid residue.<br>

The above-mentioned enzymes may be of any suitable origin, such as vegetable, animal, bacterial, fungal and yeast origin. Origin can further be mesophilic or extremophilic (psychrophilic, psychrctrophic, thermophilic, barophilic, aika-lophilic, acidophilic, halophilic, etc.). Purified or non-purified forms of these enzymes may be used. Nowadays, it is common practice to modify wild-type enzymes via protein / ge¬netic engineering techniques m order to optimise their perform¬ance efficiency in the cleaning compositions of the invention. For example, the variants may be designed such that the compati¬bility of the enzyme tc commonly encountered ingredients of such compositions is increased. Alternatively, the variant may be<br><br>
designed such that the optimal PH, bleach or cneiant stability, catalytic activity and the like, of the entyme variant is tai¬lored to suit the particular cleaning application.<br>
Ir: particular, attention should be focused on amino acios f sensitive to oxidation m the case of bleach stability anc or. surface charges for the surfactant compatibility. The isoelec¬tric point of such enzymes may be modified by the substitution of some charged anino acids, e.g. an increase in isoelectric point may help to improve compatibility with anionic surfac¬tants. The stability c£ the enzymes may be further enhanced by the creation of e.g. additional salt bridges and enforcing metal binding sites to increase cheiant stability.<br>

Softening agent,s ;<br>
fabric softening agents can also be incorporated into laundry detergent compositions in accordance with the present invention. These agents may be inorganic or organic in type. Incrganic softening agents are exemplified by the smectite clays disclosed in GE-A-1 400898 and in US 5,019,252. Organic fabric softening agents include the water insoluble tertiary amines as disclosed in GB-A1 514 276 and EP 0 oil 340 and their combination with mono C:,-C14 quaternary ammonium salts are disclosed in EP-B-Q 026 528 and di-lang-chain amides as disclosed in EP 0 242 919.

Addition of such polymers also enhances the performance of the enzymes according the invention.<br>
Use in the paper pulp industry<br><br>
Further, it is contemplated that the mannanase of the present invention is useful in chlorine-free bieacning processes for paper pulp (chemical pulps, semichenrcal pulps, mechanical pulps or kraft pulps) in order to increase the brightness f thereof, thus decreasing cr eliminating the need for hydrogen peroxide in the bleaching process.<br>
Use in the textile and cellulosic fiber processing industries<br>
The mannanase cf the present invention can be used in com¬bination with other carbohydrate degrading enzymes (for instance xyiogiucanase, xylanase, various pectinases) for preparation of fibers cr for cleaning of fioers in combination with detergents.<br>
In the present context, the term "cellulosic material" is intended to mean fibers, sewn and unsewn fabrics,'including knits, wover.s, denims, yarns, and toweling, made from cotton, cotton blends cr natural or manmade cellulosics (e.g. orig¬inating from xylan-containing cellulose fibers such as from wood pulp) or blends thereof. Examples of blends are blends of cotton or rayon/viscose with ere cr more companion material such as wool, synthetic fibers (e.g. poiyamide fibers, acrylic fibers, polyester fibers, polyvinyl alcohol fibers, polyvinyl chloride fibers, polyvinyiidene chloride fibers, polyurethane fibers, polyurea fibers, aramid fibers), and cellulose-containing fibers (e.g. rayon/viscose, ramie, hemp, flax/linen, jute, cellulose acetate fibers, lyoceli).<br>
The processing of cellulosic material for the textile industry, as for example cotton fiber, into a material ready for garment manufacture involves several steps: spinning of the fiber into a yarn; construction of woven or knit fabric from the yarn and subsequent preparation, dyeing and finishing operations. Woven goods are constructed by weaving a filling yarn between a series of warp yarns; the yarns could be two<br><br>
different types.<br>
Desizmg: polymeric size like e.g. mannan, starch, CMC cr PVA is added before weaving m order to increase the warp speed; This material must be removed before further processing. Tne enzyme of the invention is useful fcr removal of mannan contain¬ing size.<br>
Degradation of thickeners<br>
Galactomanr.ans such as guar gum and locust bean gu~ are widely used as thickening agents e.g. in food and print paste for textile printing such as prints on T-shirts. The enzyme or enzyme preparation according re the invention can be used for reducing the viscosity of eg residual food in processing equip¬ment and thereby facilitate cleaning after processing. Further, it is contemplated that the enzyme or enzyme preparation is useful for reducing viscosity of print paste, thereby facilitat¬ing wash out of surplus print paste after textile printins.<br>

The enzyme or enzyme preparation according to the invention is preferably used as an agent fcr degradation or modification of mannan, galactcmannan, glucomannan or galactoglucomannan containing material originating from plants. Examples of such material is guar gum and locust bean gum.<br>
The mannanase of the invention may be used in modifying the physical-chemical properties of plant derived material such as the viscosity. For instance, the mannanase may be used to reduce the viscosity of feed or food which contain mannan and to promote processing of viscous mannan containing material. '<br>
Coffee extraction<br><br>
r<br>
The enzyme or enzyme preparation ct   the invention may also  be used for nyarciysmg gslsctomannar.s present in a liquid coffee extract, preferably in. order to inhibit gel formation ourir.a freeze drying of the (instant) coffee. Preferably, ' the .T.ar.r.anase of the invention is immobilized in order to reduce enzyme consumption and avoid contamination of the coffee. This use is further disclosed in EP-A-676 145.<br>
Use in the fracturing of a subterranean formation (oil drilling)<br>
Further, it is contemplated that the enzyme cf the present invention, is useful as an enzyme breaker as disclosed in US patent nos. 5,8C6,5S7, 5,562,160, 5,201,370 and 5,067,5S5 to BJ Services Company (Houston, TX, U.S.A.), all of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Accordingly, the mannanase of the present invention is use¬ful in a method of fracturing a subterranean formation in a well bore in which a gellable fracturing fluid is first formed by blending together an aqueous fluid, a hydratable polymer, a suitable cross-linking agent for cross-linking the hydratable polymer to form a polymer gel and an enzyme breaker, ie the enzyme of the invention. The cross-linked polymer gel is pumped into the well bore under sufficient pressure to fracture the surrounding formation. The enzyme breaker is allowed to degrade the cross-linked polymer with time to reduce the viscosity or the fluid so that the fluid can be pumped from the formation back to the well surface.<br>
The enzyme breaker may be an ingredient of a fracturing fluid or a breaker-crosslinker-polymer complex which further comprises a hydratable polymer and a crosslinking agent, The fracturing fluid or complex may be a gel or may be gellaole. The complex is useful in a method for using the complex in a rrac-curing fluid to fracture a subterranean formation that surrounds<br><br>
a well bore by pumping the fluid to a desired location within the well bore under sufficient pressure to fracture the sur¬rounding subterranean formation. The complex may be maintained in a substantially non-reactive state by maintaining specific conditions cf pH and temperature, until a time at which the fluid is in place m the well bore and the desired fracture is completed. Once the fracture is completed, the specific condi¬tions at which the complex is inactive are no longer maintained. When the conditions change sufficiently, the complex becomes active and the breaker begins to catalyze polymer degradation causing the fracturing fluid to become sufficiently fluid to be pumped from the subterranean formation to the well surface.<br>

After 18 hours incubation at 37°C colonies were seen on plates. Several clones were'analysed by isolating plasrald DNA from overnight culture broth.<br>
One such positive clone was restreaked several times on agar plates as used above, this clone was called MB594. The . clone MB594 was grown overnight in TY-10 ug/ml kanamycin at 37°C, and next day 1 ml of ceils were used to isolate piasmid from the cells using the Qiaprep Spin Piasmid Miniprep Kit #27106 according to the manufacturers recommendations for B.subtilis  piasmid preparations. This DNA was DNA sequenced and revealed the DNA sequence corresponding to the mature part of the marmanase, i.e. positions 94-1404 of the appended SEQ ID NO:1.   The derived mature protein is shown in SEQ ID NO:8. It will appear that the 3' end of the mannanse encoded by the sequence of SEQ ID NO:5 was changed to the one shown in SEQ ID NO:7 due to the design of the lower primer used in the PCR. The resulting amino acid sequence is shown in SEQ ID NO:8 and it is apparent that the C terminus of the SEQ ID NO:6<br>
(SHHVREIGVQFSAADNSSGQTALYVDNVTLR) is changed to the C terminus Of SEQ ID N0:8 (IIMLGK).<br>
