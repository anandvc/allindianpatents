Case  20871<br>
Dihydro-benzo[b] [l,4]diazepin-2-one derivatives as mGluR2 antagonists II<br>
The present invention relates to compounds of general formula I<br><br>
selected from the group consisting of halogen, lower alkyl, fluoro-lower alkyl, C3-C6-cycloalkyl, lower alkoxy and fluoro-lower alkoxy;<br><br>
R2     is -NR'R-, fluoro4ower alkoxy or<br>
S-oxo-piperazin-l-yl, pyrrolidin-l-yl or piperidm-l-}d, which rings are optionally substituted by R-;<br>
R'     is hydrogen, lower alkyl, C3-C6-cycloalkyl, fluoro-lower alkyl or 2-lower alkoxy lower alkyl;<br>
R-    is hydrogen, lower alkyl,<br><br>
and to their pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts.<br><br>
It has surprisingly been found that the compounds of general formula I are metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonists. Compounds of formula I are distinguished by valuable therapeutic properties.<br>
In the central nervous system (CNS) the transmission of stimuli takes place by the interaction of a neurotransmitter, which is sent out by a neuron, with a neuroreceptor.<br>
. L-glutamic acid, the most commonly occurring neurotransmitter in the CNS, plays a critical role in a large number of physiological processes. The glutamate-dependent stimulus receptors are divided into two main groups. The first main group forms hgand-controUed ion channels. The metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) form the second main group and, furthermore, belong to the family of G-protein-coupled receptors.<br>
At present, eight different members of these mGluR are known and of these some even have sub-types. On the basis of structural parameters, the different influences on the synthesis of secondary metabolites and the different affinity to low-molecular weight chemical compounds, these eight receptors can be sub-divided into three sub-groups: mGluRl and mGluRS belong to group I, mGluR2 and mGluR3 belong to group II and mGluR4, mGluR6, mGluR7 and mGluRS belong to group III.<br>
Ligands of metabotropic glutamate receptors belonging to the group II can be used for the treatment or prevention of acute and/or chronic neurological disorders such as psychosis, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, cognitive disorders and memory deficits.<br>
Other treatable indications in this connection are restricted brain function caused by bypass operations or transplants, poor blood supply to the brain, spinal cord injuries, head injuries, hypoxia caused by pregnancy, cardiac arrest and hypoglycaemia. Further treatable indications are chronic and acute pain, Himtington's chorea, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), dementia caused by AIDS, eye injuries, retinopathy, idiopathic parkinsonism or parkinsonism caused by medicaments as well as conditions which lead to glutarnate-defidency functions, such as e.g. muscle spasms, convulsions, migraine, urinary incontinence, nicotine addiction, opiate addiction, anxiety, vomiting, dyskinesia and depressions.<br><br>
Objects of the present invention are compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts per se and as pharmaceutically active substances, their manufacture, medicaments based on a compound in accordance with the invention and their production, as well as the use of the compounds in accordance with the invention in the control or prevention of illnesses of the aforementioned kind, and, respectively, for the production of corresponding medicaments.<br>
The compounds of formula I can also be used in form of their prodrugs. Examples are esters, N-oxides, phosphate esters, glycoamide esters, glyceride conjugates and the like. The prodrugs may add to the value of the present compounds advantages in absorption, pharmacokinetics in distribution and transport to the brain.<br>
All tautomeric forms of the compounds of the invention are also embraced herewith.<br>

The term -pharmaceutically acceptable addition salt- refers to any salt derived from an inorganic or organic acid or base.<br>
The compounds of general formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be manufactured according to methods, which process comprises<br>
a) reacting a compound of formula II<br><br>
which subsequently undergoes deprotection of the amino group and cyclization, to obtain a compound of formula<br><br>
1<br>
According to scheme A, compounds of general formula I, in which X, Y, R1 R2 and R3 are as described above, can be prepared from compounds of general formula II via an acyiation-deprotection-cyclization sequence;<br>
For example reacting compounds of general formula II with a dioxinone IV, in which Y and R3 are as described above&gt; in an inert solvent such as toluene or xylene at elevated temperatures, preferably between 80 °C and 160 °C gives rise to compounds of general formula III.<br>
Alternatively, compounds of general formula III can also be prepared by for example reaction of a compound of general formula II with a p-ketoester (general formula rVa), in which Y and R^ are as described above using the same conditions as described for the reaction with the dioxinones.<br>
Afterwards, deaving the BOC protecting group in compounds of general formula III and concomitant cydization of the deprotected compound yidds the desired     compounds of general formula I. Any other suitable amino protecting group, such as e.g- Fmoc or benzyloxycarbonyl (Z), can be altemativdy used instead of the BOC group.<br><br>
The deprotection-cyclization step can be carried out by treating the compounds of general formula III with for example a Bronsted add such as trifluoroacetic add in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane (DCM). The reaction is preferably carried out at temperatures between 0°C and 50 °C- It may be advantageous to use also anisole or 1,3-dimethoxybenzene as a carbocation scavenger in the reaction mixture.<br><br>
According to scheme B, compounds of general formula 11 in which R^ is phenyl optionally substituted as described above for compounds where X is a single bond and R is as described above, can be prepared by different routes depending on the nature of R3 from the iodo-compounds of general formula V, in which R3 is as described above. As shown in scheme B, the key step is a coupling reaction of Suzuki-type to produce compounds of the general formula Via.<br>
Compounds of general formula II, in which R1, R3 and X are as described above can be prepared according to scheme B, by reducing the nitro group in compounds of general formula Via to the amino group. The reduction can for example be carried out using hydrogen gas in presence of a suitable catalyst like for example Raney-Nickel or Palladium on carbon. Another possible reduction method is using stannous (II) chloride (SnCl2-2H2O) in ethanol at temperatures between 70 --C and 80 °C (as described in Tetrahedron Lett, 1984,25,839), or alternatively in polar aprotic solvents, like DMF, DMA or NMP and the like, optionally in the presence of bases, like for example pyridine or triethylamine and the like, at temperatures between 0°C and 80 °C. Another suitable method is using zinc-powder in the presence of ammonium<br><br>
chloride in protic solvents like for example water or ethanol at temperatures between 20 °C and 80 °C. The exact conditions for the respective compounds of general formula II can be found in the experimental part.<br>
Compounds of general formula V, in which R1 is as described above, can be prepared by different routes depending on the individual residue R2:<br><br>
As shown in scheme C, compound Bl can be prepared from the commercially available 5-chloro-2-nitroaniline by iodination to give the synthetic intermediate Al, which in turn can be protected to yield the compound BL<br>
The iodination step can be carried out by for example using iodine monochloride in acetic acid in the presence of sodium acetate. The reaction can be for example carried out at temperatures between 20°C and 80 °C.<br>
The protection of the amino function can be applied to a number of commercially available starting materials or compounds synthesized by anyone skilled in the art to produce the corresponding 2-nitroanilines with the general formula VII, in which X is a single bond and R1 is as described above. This transformation leads to the key intermediates of the general formula VIb, and the exact conditions for the respective compounds used in this invention can be foimd in the experimental part.<br>
)    One possibility for the protection of the amino function is for example reacting compounds of general formula VII with di-tert-butyl-carbonate in the presence of a base such as cesium carbonate. The reaction can be carried out in polar solvents such as acetone or butanone and the like at temperatures between 20 °C and 60 °C.<br><br>
Alternatively, the protection of the amino group can be achieved by preparing the intermediate isocyanate by treatment of compoimds of the general formula VII with diphosgene, preferably in aprotic solvents such as ethyl acetate or 1,4-dioxane at temperatures from 0 °C to 100 °C, and subsequent treatment of the isocyanate with tert. butanol in solvents such as dichloromethane or 1,2-dichloroethane and the like at temperatures between 20 °C and 85 °C to give the desired compoimds of general formula Vlb.<br>
Another suitable method to achieve this protection step is the intermediate formation of a di-BOC compound by treatment of compounds of the general formula VII with di-tert.-butyl-carbonate in the presence of DMAP in an aprotic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran and the like, followed by selective removal of a single BOC-group by treatment with a Bronsted-acid, like e.g. TFA, in aprotic solvents such as dichloromethane, chloroform or 1,2-dichloroethane at temperatures between 0 °C and 20 °C to give the desired compounds of general formula VIb.<br>
According to scheme D, compounds of general formula VII in which R1 is pyrrol- 1-yl optionally substituted as described above, X is a single bond and R is chloride, can be prepared from known 5-chloro-2-nitro-l,4-phenylenediamine [CAS-No. 26196-45-2] by selective condensation of the 4-amino-group with a suitable substituted 2,5-dimethoxytetrahydrofuran with the general formula VIII, as described in/. Heterocycl Chem, 1988,25,1003.<br><br>
The reaction is preferably carried out in acidic media, like for example acetic acid or propionic add and the like, at temperatures between 40 °C to 100 °C. The exact conditions for the respective compounds can be found in the experimental part<br><br>
The corresponding substituted 2,5-dimethoxytetrahydrofurans -with the general formula VIII, in which Ra, Rb and Rc are as described above in the general claim for the pyrrol-1-yl compounds, are either commercially available, or synthesized from the suitable substituted furan, as shown in scheme E. The corresponding substituents can optionally be protected with suitable protecting groups, known to someone skilled in the art, or alternatively can be introduced after the pyrrol ring synthesis. The two-step sequence consists of reacting the furan with bromine in MeOH at low temperature, like for example -35 '°C, followed by treatment with base, like for example triethylamine and the like or potassium carbonate or sodium hydrogen carbonate and the like. The resulting 2,5-dimethoxydihydrofuran with the general formula VIII, in which Ra, Rb  and Rc are as described above, can be reduced by catalytic hydrogenation, preferably in MeOH with catalysts like for example Palladium on carbon or Raney-Nickel and the like, to produce the desired 2,5-dimethoxytetrahydrofurans with the general formula VIII. An example for this sequence can be found in Tetrahedron 1971,27, 1973-1996.<br><br>
The exact conditions for the individual compounds to be synthesized can be found in the experimental part.<br>
As shown in scheme F, compounds of general formula VIc, in which R2 is attached via a nitrogen-atom and is as described above, can be prepared from the intermediate compounds with the general formula VIb - which individual synthesis can be found in the experimental part - by a nucleophilic substitution reaction with the respective amines in the presence of a suitable base.<br><br><br>
The reaction is preferably carried out in a polar, aprotic solvent such as dimethyl formamide, N-methyl-pyrrolidone or dimethyl sulfoxide and the like. The base can be selected from the sterically hindered amines such as triethylamine or Hiinig's base, alkoxides such as sodium methoxide and tert.-butoxide, or hydrides such as sodium hydride. The reaction can be performed at temperatures between 20 **C and 110 ^C, depending on the individual compounds to be synthesized.<br><br>
According to scheme G&gt; compounds of general formula II in which R^ is as described above for compounds where X is an ethynediyl group can be prepared by different routes from the iodo-compounds V, depending on the nature of R and R As shown in scheme G, the transformation can for example be carried out<br>
a)	by directly attaching the R1-alkynediyl-substituent to a compound of general<br>
formula V via a Sonogashira-type coupling to produce compounds of the general<br>
formula VId followed by the reduction of the nitro group or<br>
b)	by two stepwise Sonogashira-type couplings, in which first trimethylsilyi-acetylene<br>
is coupled to a compound of general formula V to yield, after desilylation with sodium<br>
hydroxide in methanol, the intermediate X which then can be transformed via a<br><br>
second Sonogashira-type coupling with the appropriate reactant R1-I, R1-Br or R1-OSO2CF3 into compounds of the general formula VId and reduction of the nitro group leads to the desired compounds of general formula IL<br>
The exact conditions for the respective compounds can be found in the experimental part.<br><br>
According to Scheme H, the dioxinones and 6-keto esters building blocks with the general formula TV and IVa can be prepared by methods known to someone skilled in the art from the corresponding carboxylic acid derivatives R -COR, i.e. free acids, methyl or ethyl esters and acid chlorides. The exact conditions for the corresponding compounds can be found in the experimental part.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be manufactured readily according to methods known per se and taking into consideration the nature of the compound to be converted into a salt. Inorganic or organic adds such as, for example, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulphuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid or citric acid, formic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, acetic acid, succinic acid, tartaric add, methanesulphonic add, p-toluenesulphonic add and the like are suitable for the formation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of basic compounds of formula I.<br><br>
The compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts are metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonists and can be used for the treatment or prevention of acute and/or chronic neurological disorders, such as psychosis, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, cognitive disorders and memory deficits. Other treatable indications are restricted brain function caused by bypass operations or transplants, poor blood supply to the brain, spinal cord injuries, head injuries, hypoxia caused by pregnancy, cardiac arrest and hypoglycaemia. Further treatable indications are acute and chronic pain, Huntington's chorea, ALS, dementia caused by AIDS, eye injuries, retinopathy, idiopathic parkinsonism or parkinsonism caused by medicaments as well as conditions which lead to glutamate-deficient functions, such as e.g. muscle spasms, convulsions, migraine, urinary incontinence, nicotine addiction, psychoses, opiate addiction, anxiety, vomiting, dyskinesia and depression.<br>
The compounds of formula I and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations. The pharmaceutical preparations can be administered orally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions. However, the administration can also be effected rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, or parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions.<br>
The compounds of formula I and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be processed with pharmaceutically inert, inorganic or organic carriers for the production of pharmaceutical preparations. Lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts and the like can be used, for example, as such carriers for tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semi-solid and liquid polyols and the like; depending on the nature of the active substance no carriers are, however, usually required in the case of soft gelatine capsules- Suitable carriers for the production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar, glucose and the like. Adjuvants, such as alcohols, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oils and the like, can be used for aqueous injection solutions of water-soluble salts of compounds of formula I, but as a rule are not necessary. Suitable carriers for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats, semi-liquid or liquid polyols and the like.<br>
In addition, the pharmaceutical preparations can contain preservatives, solubilizers, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorants, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, masking agents or antioxidants. They can also contain still other therapeutically valuable substances.<br><br>
As mentioned earlier, medicaments containing a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a therapeutically inert excipient are also an object of the present invention, as is a process for the production of such medicaments which comprises bringing one or more compounds of formda I or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and, if desired, one or more other therapeutically valuable substances into a galenical dosage form together with one or more therapeutically inert carriers.<br>
The dosage can vary within wide limits and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. In general, the effective dosage for oral or parenteral administration is between 0.01-20 mg/kg/day, with a dosage of 0.1-10 mg/ kg/day being preferred for all of the indications described. The daily dosage for an adult human being weighing 70 kg accordingly lies between 0.7-1400 mg per day, preferably between 7 and 700 mg per day.<br>
The present invention relates also to the use of compounds of formula I and of pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof for the production of medicaments, especially for the control or prevention of acute and/or chronic neurological disorders of the aforementioned kind.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are group II mGlu receptor antagonists. The compounds show activities, as measured in the assay described<br>
below, of 10μM or less, typically 1μM or less, and ideally of 0.3μM or less.<br>
In the table below are described some specific Ki values of preferred compounds.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Transfection and cell culture<br>
cDNA encoding the rat mGlu2 receptor protein in pBluescript II was obtained from Prof. S. Nakanishi (Kyoto, Japan), and subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA I-amp from Invitrogen (NV Leek, The Netherlands). This vector construct (pcDlmGR2) was co-transfected with a psvNeo plasmid encoding the gene for neomycin resistance, into CHO cells by a modified calcium phosphate method described by Chen &amp; Okayama (1988), The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle medium with reduced L-glutamine (2 -mM final concentration) and 10 % dialysed foetal calf serum from Gibco BRL (Basel, Switzerland). Selection was made in the presence of G-418 (1000 ug/ml final). Clones were identified by reverse transcription of 5 μg total RNA, followed by PCR using mGlu2 receptor specific primers 5'-atcactgcttgggtttctggcactg-3' and 5'-agcatcactgtgggtggcataggagc-3' in 60 mM Tris HCl (pH 10), 15 mM (NH4)2SO4,2 mM MgCl2, 25 units/nil Taq Polymerase with 30 cycles annealing at 60 oC for 1 min., extention at 72 °C for 30 s, and 1 min. 95 °C denaturation.<br><br>
Membrane preparation<br>
Cells, cultured as above, were harvested and washed three times with cold PBS and frozen at -80 °C. The pellet was resuspended in cold 20 mM HEPES-NaOH buffer containing 10 mM EDTA (pH 7.4), and homogenised with a polytron (Kinematica, AG, Littau, Switzerland) for 10 s at 10 000 rpm. After centrifugation for 30 min. at 4 °C, the pellet was washed once with the same buffer, and once with cold 20 mM HEPES-NaOH buffer containing 0.1 mM EDTA, (pH 7.4). Protein content was measured using the Pierce method (Socochim, Lausanne, Switzerland) using bovine serum albumin as standard.<br>
[3H]'LY354740 binding<br>
After thawing, the membranes were resuspended in cold 50mM Tris-HCl buffer containing 2 mM MgClo and 2 mM CaCl2, (pH 7) (binding buffer). The final concentration of the membranes in the assays was 25°Cg protein/ml. Inhibition experiments were performed with membranes incubated with 10 nM [3H]-LY354740 at room temperature, for 1 hour, in presence of various concentrations of the compound to be tested. Following the incubations, membranes were filtered onto Whatmann GF/C glass fiber filters and washed 5 times with cold binding buffer. Non specific binding was measured in the presence of 10°CM DCG IV. After transfer of the filters into plastic vials containing 10 ml of Ultima-gold scintillation fluid (Packard, Zurich, Switzerland), the radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation in a Tri-Carb 2500 TR counter (Packard, Zurich, Switzerland),<br>

Preparation of 4-iodo-2-nitroanilines by iodination of 2-nitroanilines [according to Wilson, J. Gerald; Hunt, Frederick C Aust /, Chem. 1983,36^ 2317-25]<br>
To a stirred solution of the Z-nitroanilinc (LO mol) in HOAc (500 mL) containing anhydrous NaOAc (93-103 g, 1.125-1.25 mol), iodine monochloride (59-66 mL, 1.125-1.25 mol) in HOAc (300 mL) was added over 60 min. The reaction mixture was heated to the given temperature until thin layer chromatography (tic) indicated complete conversion of the starting material, stirred for another 30 min at 23 oC, then diluted slowly with H2O (1000 mL) which caused the separation of the crystalline product. Stirring was continued for 1 h and the product was filtered off, washed free of HOAc and dried in vacuum at 60 oC.<br>

It has surprisingly been found that the compounds of general formula I are metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonists. Compounds of formula I are distinguished by valuable therapeutic properties.<br>
In the central nervous system (CNS) the transmission of stimuli takes place by the interaction of a neurotransmitter, which is sent out by a neuron, with a neuroreceptor.<br>
. L-glutamic acid, the most commonly occurring neurotransmitter in the CNS, plays a critical role in a large number of physiological processes. The glutamate-dependent stimulus receptors are divided into two main groups. The first main group forms hgand-controUed ion channels. The metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) form the second main group and, furthermore, belong to the family of G-protein-coupled receptors.<br>
At present, eight different members of these mGluR are known and of these some even have sub-types. On the basis of structural parameters, the different influences on the synthesis of secondary metabolites and the different affinity to low-molecular weight chemical compounds, these eight receptors can be sub-divided into three sub-groups: mGluRl and mGluRS belong to group I, mGluR2 and mGluR3 belong to group II and mGluR4, mGluR6, mGluR7 and mGluRS belong to group III.<br>
Ligands of metabotropic glutamate receptors belonging to the group II can be used for the treatment or prevention of acute and/or chronic neurological disorders such as psychosis, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, cognitive disorders and memory deficits.<br>
Other treatable indications in this connection are restricted brain function caused by bypass operations or transplants, poor blood supply to the brain, spinal cord injuries, head injuries, hypoxia caused by pregnancy, cardiac arrest and hypoglycaemia. Further treatable indications are chronic and acute pain, Himtington's chorea, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), dementia caused by AIDS, eye injuries, retinopathy, idiopathic parkinsonism or parkinsonism caused by medicaments as well as conditions which lead to glutarnate-defidency functions, such as e.g. muscle spasms, convulsions, migraine, urinary incontinence, nicotine addiction, opiate addiction, anxiety, vomiting, dyskinesia and depressions.<br><br>
Objects of the present invention are compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts per se and as pharmaceutically active substances, their manufacture, medicaments based on a compound in accordance with the invention and their production, as well as the use of the compounds in accordance with the invention in the control or prevention of illnesses of the aforementioned kind, and, respectively, for the production of corresponding medicaments.<br>
The compounds of formula I can also be used in form of their prodrugs. Examples are esters, N-oxides, phosphate esters, glycoamide esters, glyceride conjugates and the like. The prodrugs may add to the value of the present compounds advantages in absorption, pharmacokinetics in distribution and transport to the brain.<br>
All tautomeric forms of the compounds of the invention are also embraced herewith.<br>

a) reacting a compound of formula II<br><br>
which subsequently undergoes deprotection of the amino group and cyclization, to obtain a compound of formula<br><br>
1<br>
According to scheme A, compounds of general formula I, in which X, Y, R1 R2 and R3 are as described above, can be prepared from compounds of general formula II via an acyiation-deprotection-cyclization sequence;<br>
For example reacting compounds of general formula II with a dioxinone IV, in which Y and R3 are as described above&gt; in an inert solvent such as toluene or xylene at elevated temperatures, preferably between 80 °C and 160 °C gives rise to compounds of general formula III.<br>
Alternatively, compounds of general formula III can also be prepared by for example reaction of a compound of general formula II with a p-ketoester (general formula rVa), in which Y and R^ are as described above using the same conditions as described for the reaction with the dioxinones.<br>
Afterwards, deaving the BOC protecting group in compounds of general formula III and concomitant cydization of the deprotected compound yidds the desired     compounds of general formula I. Any other suitable amino protecting group, such as e.g- Fmoc or benzyloxycarbonyl (Z), can be altemativdy used instead of the BOC group.<br><br>
The deprotection-cyclization step can be carried out by treating the compounds of general formula III with for example a Bronsted add such as trifluoroacetic add in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane (DCM). The reaction is preferably carried out at temperatures between 0°C and 50 °C- It may be advantageous to use also anisole or 1,3-dimethoxybenzene as a carbocation scavenger in the reaction mixture.<br><br>
According to scheme B, compounds of general formula 11 in which R^ is phenyl optionally substituted as described above for compounds where X is a single bond and R is as described above, can be prepared by different routes depending on the nature of R3 from the iodo-compounds of general formula V, in which R3 is as described above. As shown in scheme B, the key step is a coupling reaction of Suzuki-type to produce compounds of the general formula Via.<br>
Compounds of general formula II, in which R1, R3 and X are as described above can be prepared according to scheme B, by reducing the nitro group in compounds of general formula Via to the amino group. The reduction can for example be carried out using hydrogen gas in presence of a suitable catalyst like for example Raney-Nickel or Palladium on carbon. Another possible reduction method is using stannous (II) chloride (SnCl2-2H2O) in ethanol at temperatures between 70 --C and 80 °C (as described in Tetrahedron Lett, 1984,25,839), or alternatively in polar aprotic solvents, like DMF, DMA or NMP and the like, optionally in the presence of bases, like for example pyridine or triethylamine and the like, at temperatures between 0°C and 80 °C. Another suitable method is using zinc-powder in the presence of ammonium<br><br>
chloride in protic solvents like for example water or ethanol at temperatures between 20 °C and 80 °C. The exact conditions for the respective compounds of general formula II can be found in the experimental part.<br>
Compounds of general formula V, in which R1 is as described above, can be prepared by different routes depending on the individual residue R2:<br><br>
As shown in scheme C, compound Bl can be prepared from the commercially available 5-chloro-2-nitroaniline by iodination to give the synthetic intermediate Al, which in turn can be protected to yield the compound BL<br>
The iodination step can be carried out by for example using iodine monochloride in acetic acid in the presence of sodium acetate. The reaction can be for example carried out at temperatures between 20°C and 80 °C.<br>
The protection of the amino function can be applied to a number of commercially available starting materials or compounds synthesized by anyone skilled in the art to produce the corresponding 2-nitroanilines with the general formula VII, in which X is a single bond and R1 is as described above. This transformation leads to the key intermediates of the general formula VIb, and the exact conditions for the respective compounds used in this invention can be foimd in the experimental part.<br>
)    One possibility for the protection of the amino function is for example reacting compounds of general formula VII with di-tert-butyl-carbonate in the presence of a base such as cesium carbonate. The reaction can be carried out in polar solvents such as acetone or butanone and the like at temperatures between 20 °C and 60 °C.<br><br>
Alternatively, the protection of the amino group can be achieved by preparing the intermediate isocyanate by treatment of compoimds of the general formula VII with diphosgene, preferably in aprotic solvents such as ethyl acetate or 1,4-dioxane at temperatures from 0 °C to 100 °C, and subsequent treatment of the isocyanate with tert. butanol in solvents such as dichloromethane or 1,2-dichloroethane and the like at temperatures between 20 °C and 85 °C to give the desired compoimds of general formula Vlb.<br>
Another suitable method to achieve this protection step is the intermediate formation of a di-BOC compound by treatment of compounds of the general formula VII with di-tert.-butyl-carbonate in the presence of DMAP in an aprotic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran and the like, followed by selective removal of a single BOC-group by treatment with a Bronsted-acid, like e.g. TFA, in aprotic solvents such as dichloromethane, chloroform or 1,2-dichloroethane at temperatures between 0 °C and 20 °C to give the desired compounds of general formula VIb.<br>
According to scheme D, compounds of general formula VII in which R1 is pyrrol- 1-yl optionally substituted as described above, X is a single bond and R is chloride, can be prepared from known 5-chloro-2-nitro-l,4-phenylenediamine [CAS-No. 26196-45-2] by selective condensation of the 4-amino-group with a suitable substituted 2,5-dimethoxytetrahydrofuran with the general formula VIII, as described in/. Heterocycl Chem, 1988,25,1003.<br><br>
The reaction is preferably carried out in acidic media, like for example acetic acid or propionic add and the like, at temperatures between 40 °C to 100 °C. The exact conditions for the respective compounds can be found in the experimental part<br><br>
The corresponding substituted 2,5-dimethoxytetrahydrofurans -with the general formula VIII, in which Ra, Rb and Rc are as described above in the general claim for the pyrrol-1-yl compounds, are either commercially available, or synthesized from the suitable substituted furan, as shown in scheme E. The corresponding substituents can optionally be protected with suitable protecting groups, known to someone skilled in the art, or alternatively can be introduced after the pyrrol ring synthesis. The two-step sequence consists of reacting the furan with bromine in MeOH at low temperature, like for example -35 '°C, followed by treatment with base, like for example triethylamine and the like or potassium carbonate or sodium hydrogen carbonate and the like. The resulting 2,5-dimethoxydihydrofuran with the general formula VIII, in which Ra, Rb  and Rc are as described above, can be reduced by catalytic hydrogenation, preferably in MeOH with catalysts like for example Palladium on carbon or Raney-Nickel and the like, to produce the desired 2,5-dimethoxytetrahydrofurans with the general formula VIII. An example for this sequence can be found in Tetrahedron 1971,27, 1973-1996.<br><br>
The exact conditions for the individual compounds to be synthesized can be found in the experimental part.<br>
As shown in scheme F, compounds of general formula VIc, in which R2 is attached via a nitrogen-atom and is as described above, can be prepared from the intermediate compounds with the general formula VIb - which individual synthesis can be found in the experimental part - by a nucleophilic substitution reaction with the respective amines in the presence of a suitable base.<br><br><br>
The reaction is preferably carried out in a polar, aprotic solvent such as dimethyl formamide, N-methyl-pyrrolidone or dimethyl sulfoxide and the like. The base can be selected from the sterically hindered amines such as triethylamine or Hiinig's base, alkoxides such as sodium methoxide and tert.-butoxide, or hydrides such as sodium hydride. The reaction can be performed at temperatures between 20 **C and 110 ^C, depending on the individual compounds to be synthesized.<br><br>
According to scheme G&gt; compounds of general formula II in which R^ is as described above for compounds where X is an ethynediyl group can be prepared by different routes from the iodo-compounds V, depending on the nature of R and R As shown in scheme G, the transformation can for example be carried out<br>
a)	by directly attaching the R1-alkynediyl-substituent to a compound of general<br>
formula V via a Sonogashira-type coupling to produce compounds of the general<br>
formula VId followed by the reduction of the nitro group or<br>
b)	by two stepwise Sonogashira-type couplings, in which first trimethylsilyi-acetylene<br>
is coupled to a compound of general formula V to yield, after desilylation with sodium<br>
hydroxide in methanol, the intermediate X which then can be transformed via a<br><br>
second Sonogashira-type coupling with the appropriate reactant R1-I, R1-Br or R1-OSO2CF3 into compounds of the general formula VId and reduction of the nitro group leads to the desired compounds of general formula IL<br>
The exact conditions for the respective compounds can be found in the experimental part.<br><br>
According to Scheme H, the dioxinones and 6-keto esters building blocks with the general formula TV and IVa can be prepared by methods known to someone skilled in the art from the corresponding carboxylic acid derivatives R -COR, i.e. free acids, methyl or ethyl esters and acid chlorides. The exact conditions for the corresponding compounds can be found in the experimental part.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be manufactured readily according to methods known per se and taking into consideration the nature of the compound to be converted into a salt. Inorganic or organic adds such as, for example, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulphuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid or citric acid, formic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, acetic acid, succinic acid, tartaric add, methanesulphonic add, p-toluenesulphonic add and the like are suitable for the formation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of basic compounds of formula I.<br><br>
The compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts are metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonists and can be used for the treatment or prevention of acute and/or chronic neurological disorders, such as psychosis, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, cognitive disorders and memory deficits. Other treatable indications are restricted brain function caused by bypass operations or transplants, poor blood supply to the brain, spinal cord injuries, head injuries, hypoxia caused by pregnancy, cardiac arrest and hypoglycaemia. Further treatable indications are acute and chronic pain, Huntington's chorea, ALS, dementia caused by AIDS, eye injuries, retinopathy, idiopathic parkinsonism or parkinsonism caused by medicaments as well as conditions which lead to glutamate-deficient functions, such as e.g. muscle spasms, convulsions, migraine, urinary incontinence, nicotine addiction, psychoses, opiate addiction, anxiety, vomiting, dyskinesia and depression.<br>
The compounds of formula I and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations. The pharmaceutical preparations can be administered orally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions. However, the administration can also be effected rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, or parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions.<br>
The compounds of formula I and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be processed with pharmaceutically inert, inorganic or organic carriers for the production of pharmaceutical preparations. Lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts and the like can be used, for example, as such carriers for tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semi-solid and liquid polyols and the like; depending on the nature of the active substance no carriers are, however, usually required in the case of soft gelatine capsules- Suitable carriers for the production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar, glucose and the like. Adjuvants, such as alcohols, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oils and the like, can be used for aqueous injection solutions of water-soluble salts of compounds of formula I, but as a rule are not necessary. Suitable carriers for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats, semi-liquid or liquid polyols and the like.<br>
In addition, the pharmaceutical preparations can contain preservatives, solubilizers, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorants, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, masking agents or antioxidants. They can also contain still other therapeutically valuable substances.<br><br>
As mentioned earlier, medicaments containing a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a therapeutically inert excipient are also an object of the present invention, as is a process for the production of such medicaments which comprises bringing one or more compounds of formda I or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and, if desired, one or more other therapeutically valuable substances into a galenical dosage form together with one or more therapeutically inert carriers.<br>
The dosage can vary within wide limits and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. In general, the effective dosage for oral or parenteral administration is between 0.01-20 mg/kg/day, with a dosage of 0.1-10 mg/ kg/day being preferred for all of the indications described. The daily dosage for an adult human being weighing 70 kg accordingly lies between 0.7-1400 mg per day, preferably between 7 and 700 mg per day.<br>
The present invention relates also to the use of compounds of formula I and of pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof for the production of medicaments, especially for the control or prevention of acute and/or chronic neurological disorders of the aforementioned kind.<br>

After thawing, the membranes were resuspended in cold 50mM Tris-HCl buffer containing 2 mM MgClo and 2 mM CaCl2, (pH 7) (binding buffer). The final concentration of the membranes in the assays was 25°Cg protein/ml. Inhibition experiments were performed with membranes incubated with 10 nM [3H]-LY354740 at room temperature, for 1 hour, in presence of various concentrations of the compound to be tested. Following the incubations, membranes were filtered onto Whatmann GF/C glass fiber filters and washed 5 times with cold binding buffer. Non specific binding was measured in the presence of 10°CM DCG IV. After transfer of the filters into plastic vials containing 10 ml of Ultima-gold scintillation fluid (Packard, Zurich, Switzerland), the radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation in a Tri-Carb 2500 TR counter (Packard, Zurich, Switzerland),<br>

The catalyst was filtered off, washed thoroughly with MeOH or EtOH and THF (1:1) [or EtOAc], the solvent was removed in vacuum to give the title compound, which was generally pure enough for further transformations, but could be crystallized firom hot hexane if necessary. Method b: Reduction with SnCl2'2H2O<br>
A mixture of the nitro compound (1.0 mmol) and SnCl2'2H2O (5.0 mmol) was either stirred in EtOH (30 mL) at 70-80 °C or alternatively in pyridine (3 mL) and DMF (12 mL) at 23 °C under Argon atmosphere until tic indicated complete conversion [cf. Tetr. Lett. 1984,25, 839]. The reaction mixture was brought to pH 8 by addition of sat NaHC03-sol. and extracted with EtOAc (2 X 100 mL). The combined organic layer were washed with brine and dried over Na2SO4. Removal of the solvent left a yellow solid, which - if necessary - can be purified by silica gel column chromatography.<br><br>
