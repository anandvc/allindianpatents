TORQUE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM WITH ELECTRONICALLY-CONTROLLED<br>
POWER TAKE-OFF MODULE<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]	This application claims the benefit of United States Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/822,989, filed August 21, 2006, which is hereby incorporated by<br>
reference in its entirety.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002]	The invention relates to a system for distributing driving torque between<br>
vehicle wheels and includes an electronic power take-off unit for same.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003]	The ability to control torque distribution among the wheels of a vehicle<br>
improves vehicle traction. Torque distribution systems, also referred to as torque biasing<br>
systems, include limited slip differentials having a clutch that is engagable to transfer<br>
torque between left and rights wheels and active-on-demand systems, also utilizing a<br>
selectively engagable clutch, to transfer torque between front and rear wheels. Existing<br>
torque distribution systems typically require the addition of an electric motor-driven<br>
pump for actuation of the clutch, thus increasing required componentry. Alternative<br>
existing systems may engage the clutches using a pump that is actuated by a speed<br>
difference between wheels, thus requiring that the vehicle be in motion for the system to<br>
operate.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0004]	A torque distribution system for a vehicle permits the transfer of torque<br>
between vehicle wheels using a selectively engagable clutch that is hydraulically engaged<br>
using hydraulic pressure provided by an engine-driven pump, allowing for enhanced<br>
system functionality and reduced part content in comparison with known torque<br>
distribution systems. The system includes at least one torque-transmitting mechanism,<br><br>
GP-308901-PTT-DLT<br>
2<br>
such as an "active-on-demand" clutch that is selectively engagable to transfer torque<br>
between a front differential and a rear differential (thereby transferring torque from the<br>
front wheels to the rear wheels) and/or an electronically-limited slip differential clutch<br>
selectively engagable to transfer torque from one front wheel to the other front wheel<br>
through the front differential. Utilization of the transmission hydraulic pump, typically<br>
present in a transmission for providing lubrication and cooling to transmission gears and<br>
gear selection clutches, allows pressure to be provided to engage the clutch even when<br>
the wheels are stationary, i.e., to launch the vehicle. This is not possible with limited slip<br>
differential clutches that are actuated by hydraulic pressure provided by a pump that is<br>
driven by a speed difference between two of the wheels to generate hydraulic pressure to<br>
actuate the clutch. Braking of the vehicle is also not required in order to engage either<br>
the electronically-limited slip differential clutch or the active-on-demand clutch.<br>
Additionally, cost, weight, and packaging space savings and reduced electrical power<br>
consumption may be realized with respect to systems requiring a separate motor and<br>
pump to provide hydraulic pressure for clutch engagement.<br>
[0005]	Preferably, the clutch or clutches of the torque distribution system are<br>
packaged as a module, referred to herein as an electronically-controlled power take-off<br>
module, having its own casing mountable adjacent the transmission casing with a fluid<br>
connection there between to allow the transmission pump to connect with the clutches.<br>
An electronic controller may be used to control engagement of the clutches based on<br>
vehicle operating information such as wheel speed, yaw rate, steering angle, and lateral<br>
acceleration. The controller may also modulate the amount of hydraulic pressure<br>
provided to the clutches to allow slipping engagement, with associated reduced torque<br>
transfer, when desired.<br>
[0006]	Specifically, a torque distribution system for a vehicle having wheels and<br>
a hydraulic pump includes at least one torque-transmitting mechanism selectively<br>
engagable to transfer torque between at least two of the wheels. The hydraulic pump is<br>
hydraulically connectable with the torque-transmitting mechanism(s) for controlling<br>
engagement thereof. The hydraulic pump is driven by the engine and so can provide<br><br>
GP-308901-PTT-DLT<br>
3<br>
hydraulic pressure regardless of wheel speed. Preferably, the hydraulic pump also<br>
provides lubrication and hydraulic pressure to the transmission.<br>
[0007]	The torque distribution system may utilize a first or front differential<br>
mechanism having a first member operatively connected for driving rotation by an output<br>
member of the transmission, a second member operatively connected for driving rotation<br>
of the left front wheel and a third member operatively connected for driving rotation of<br>
the right front wheel. The torque-transmitting mechanism may be a first friction clutch<br>
that is selectively engagable to transfer torque between the second and third members,<br>
thereby transferring torque between the left and right front wheels.<br>
[0008]	Additionally, a longitudinally-extending member such as a propeller shaft<br>
spans at least partially between the front wheels and rear wheels. A rear differential<br>
mechanism operatively connects the rear wheels with the longitudinally-extending<br>
member.   The torque-transmitting mechanism may be a clutch that is selectively<br>
engagable for transferring torque between the front differential and the longitudinally-<br>
extending member to thereby transfer torque between the front and rear wheels.<br>
[0009]	The torque distribution system may include an electronic controller that<br>
receives a sensor signal correlated with at least one vehicle condition and then sends a<br>
control signal based on the sensor signal and determinative of hydraulic pressure applied<br>
to the torque-transmitting mechanism(s), thereby permitting controlled slip to vary the<br>
amount of torque transferred by the torque-transmitting mechanism(s).<br>
[0010]	The torque distribution system may include a hydraulic control module<br>
which operatively connects the electronic controller with the torque-transmitting<br>
mechanism of the torque distribution system. The hydraulic control module includes a<br>
first solenoid selectively actuatable by a control signal from the controller to allow<br>
hydraulic pressure provided by the pump into fluid communication with the torque-<br>
transmitting mechanism. Preferably, an accumulator and an additional solenoid are<br>
provided. The additional solenoid is in fluid communication between the accumulator<br>
and the first solenoid and is selectively actuatable and configured to permit hydraulic<br>
flow to the first solenoid when actuated and prevent hydraulic flow to the first solenoid,<br>
maintaining hydraulic pressure in the accumulator, when not actuated. A check valve or<br><br>
GP-308901-PTT-DLT<br>
4<br>
a second additional solenoid may be positioned between the hydraulic pump and the<br>
accumulator to control fluid flow between the hydraulic pump and the accumulator.<br>
Preferably, pressure sensors are operatively connected to each of the torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms to monitor apply pressure of the torque-transmitting mechanisms and<br>
communicate the monitored pressure to the controller, thereby allowing feedback control<br>
of clutch apply torque.<br>
[0011]	The torque-transmitting mechanisms, e.g., the active-on-demand clutch,<br>
the electronically-limited slip differential clutch, and the electronic controller of the<br>
torque distribution system, may be referred to as an electronically-controlled power take-<br>
off module. The torque-transmitting mechanisms may be packaged in a module casing<br>
that encloses the torque-transmitting mechanisms and is connectable to a transmission<br>
casing for the transmission to permit fluid transfer from the transmission pump to the<br>
torque-transmitting mechanisms through the connected transmission casing and module<br>
casing. The different combinations of electronically-controlled solenoid(s), accumulator,<br>
ball check valve, and pressure sensor(es) discussed herein, may be referred to as a<br>
hydraulic control module that is part of the electronically-controlled power take-off<br>
module<br>
[0012]	The above features and advantages and other features and advantages of<br>
the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description of the<br>
best modes for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0018]	Referring to the drawings, wherein like reference numbers refer to like<br>
components, Figure 1 shows a vehicle 10 powered by an engine 11. The engine 11 is<br>
operatively connected to a transmission 12, contained within a transmission casing 14.<br>
via a torque converter (shown in Figure 2). An electronically-controlled power take-off<br>
module 16 has a module casing 18 connected to the transmission casing 14. Operation<br>
and control of the electronic power take-off module 16 is described with respect to Figure<br>
2. The power take-off module 16 is part of a torque distribution system 17 for<br>
transferring torque between the left and right front wheels, 20, 22 via a front differential<br>
mechanism (labeled 46 in Figure 2) contained within the transmission casing 14, and<br>
between the front wheels 20, 22 and a rear differential mechanism 24 connected with rear<br>
wheels 26, 28 via a propeller shaft 30, also referred to herein as a longitudinally-<br>
extending member, used to connect the power take-off module 16 to the rear differential<br>
mechanism 24.<br>
[0019]	Referring to Figure 2, the engine 11 has an output shaft 32 connected to a<br>
transmission input member 34 via a torque converter 36. The engine 11 drives a pump<br>
portion P of the torque converter 36 to which a hydraulic pump 38 is connected. The<br>
hydraulic pump 38 provides hydraulic fluid for cooling a transmission gearing<br>
arrangement 13, including hydraulically-actuated gear selection friction clutches (not<br>
shown), located within the transmission casing 14 that are engagable to provide desired<br>
speed ratios between the transmission input member 34 and a transmission output<br>
member 40, as is understood by those skilled in the art. The output member 40 drives an<br>
output gear 42 meshingly engaged with a carrier member 44 of the front differential<br><br>
GP-308901-PTT-DLT<br>
6<br>
mechanism 46 (relative size of gear 42, carrier member 44, engine 11 and transmission<br>
12 not to scale). The front differential mechanism 46 also includes a left side gear 48 and<br>
a right side gear 50 connected for respective rotation with the left and right wheels 20. 22.<br>
As is understood by those skilled in the art, pinion gears 52 mounted on a pinion shaft 54<br>
meshingly engage with both of the side gears 48, 50 and permit the wheels 20, 22 to turn<br>
at different speeds during turning of the vehicle 10. A pinion gear 55 rotates with the<br>
propeller shaft 30 and meshingly engages with a carrier 57 of the rear differential 24.<br>
[0020]	The power take-off module 16 includes two torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms in the form of friction clutches 56, 58, that, along with the hydraulic pump<br>
38 and an electronic controller 110 (shown in Figures 3-5) form a transmission<br>
distribution system 17 that transfers torque between left and right front wheels 20, 22 and<br>
between front wheels 20, 22 and rear wheels 26, 28, as described hereinafter.<br>
[0021]	The friction clutch 56 is also referred to as an electronically-limited slip<br>
differential clutch. A hub 59 extends from a right wheel shaft 60 that rotates with the<br>
right side gear 50 and operatively connects to the right wheel 22. Hydraulic pressure<br>
supplied from the pump 38 to an apply cavity 62 moves a piston 64 which provides an<br>
axial force through a thrust bearing 66 to cause engagement of clutch plates splined to the<br>
hub 59 with clutch plates splined to a second hub 68 that is connected for rotation with a<br>
sleeve shaft 70 that rotates with the carrier 44. An additional thrust bearing 72 absorbs<br>
axial force between the hub 68 and a portion of the module casing 18 (shown in<br>
fragmented, cross-sectional view, but understood to be an integral casing as<br>
schematically depicted in Figure 1). When the friction clutch 56 is released (i.e., not<br>
engaged), the front differential mechanism 46 functions as an open differential.<br>
[0022]	The friction clutch 58, also referred to as an active-on-demand clutch, is<br>
selectively engagable via hydraulic pressure provided by the hydraulic pump 38 to<br>
connect a longitudinal shaft 74 for common rotation with propeller shaft 30. The<br>
longitudinal shaft 74 is operatively connected to and driven by rotation of the sleeve shaft<br>
70. Specifically, a set of intermeshing gears, including gear 76 mounted for rotation with<br>
sleeve shaft 70 and gear 78 mounted for rotation with intermediate shaft 80 transfers<br>
torque to a set of beveled gears including beveled gear 82 rotating with intermediate shaft<br><br>
GP-308901-PTT-DLT<br>
7<br>
80 and beveled gear 84 rotating with longitudinal shaft 74, permitting a 90 degree shift in<br>
the axis of rotation between the sleeve shaft 70 and longitudinal shaft 74. Multiple<br>
angular thrust bearings 86 absorb loads between the gears 78, 82, 84, shafts 74 and 80<br>
and the casing 18. When the friction clutch 58 is released (i.e., not engaged) no torque is<br>
sent to the rear differential mechanism 24.<br>
[0023]	A hub 88 extends from longitudinal shaft 74. Selective engagement of<br>
friction clutch 58 is via hydraulic pressure from the pump 38 supplied to fill cavity 90 to<br>
move piston 92 to engage friction plates extending from hub 88 with friction plates<br>
extending from a hub 94 connected for rotation with propeller shaft 30. A roller bearing<br>
96 is placed between propeller shaft 30 and casing 18. Thrust bearings 98 and 100,<br>
transfer axial loading from the piston 92 to the friction plates and reaction loading from<br>
hub 88 to housing 18, respectively.<br>
[0024]	Referring to Figure 3, hydraulic and electronic control of the<br>
electronically-limited slip differential clutch 56 and the active-on-demand friction clutch<br>
58 of Figure 2 is illustrated with respect to the respective clutch pistons 64 and 92. A<br>
hydraulic control module 101 includes a valve body 102 within the casing 18 of the<br>
power take-off unit 16. The valve body 102 houses electronically-controlled solenoid<br>
valves 104 and 106. The pump 38 pressurizes fluid drawn from a fluid source 107, such<br>
as a sump in the transmission casing 14, and is hydraulically connected with the solenoid<br>
valves 104 and 106 via a fluid passage extending through a passage opening 108 (also<br>
shown in Figures 1, 2, 4 and 5) formed by aligned apertures in the adjacent transmission<br>
casing 14 and module casing 18. (In Figures 3-5, the transmission casing 14 and the<br>
module casing 18 are depicted in phantom, and are only schematic, but represent the<br>
same casings 14, 18 depicted in Figures 1 and 2.) Other alternative means to<br>
hydraulically connect the pump 38 with the valve body 102 may be employed, such as an<br>
external tube. The controller 110 receives input information signals 111 from the vehicle<br>
10, also referred to herein as sensor signals, which may include information from a yaw<br>
sensor, a steering wheel angle sensor, a lateral acceleration (G-force) sensor and wheel<br>
speed sensors. The controller 110 is shown external to casings 14 and 18, but may be an<br>
existing transmission controller housed in the transmission casing 14, a body module<br><br>
GP-308901-PTT-DLT<br>
8<br>
controller housed in a body of the vehicle 10, or a separate controller housed in the<br>
module casing 18. The input information signals 111 are processed by the controller 110<br>
according to an algorithm stored therein to determine whether either or both of the<br>
friction clutches 56, 58 should be engaged to transfer torque, and the level of torque to be<br>
transferred and corresponding amount of hydraulic pressure that should be provided. The<br>
controller 110 provides control signals 112, 114 to move either or both of the respective<br>
solenoid valves 104, 106 an amount correlated to the amount of hydraulic pressure<br>
determined to be applied (movement is in a downward direction in Figure 3), thereby<br>
allowing pressurized hydraulic fluid to reach fill cavity 62 and/or fill cavity 90 to engage<br>
the respective clutches 56, 58.   Accordingly, the hydraulic control module 101 is<br>
electronically controlled by the controller 110 to vary the clutch capacity of the clutches<br>
56,58.<br>
[0025]	Referring to Figure 4, an alternative embodiment of a hydraulic control<br>
module 201 utilizes the same components as the hydraulic control module 101 of Figure<br>
3, and adds a ball check valve 203, an accumulator 204 and an additional solenoid valve<br>
206. Solenoid valves 104, 106 and 206 are included in valve body 202. The ball check<br>
valve 203, accumulator 204 and additional solenoid valve 206 allow pressure to be stored<br>
in the hydraulic lines or passages shown connecting the pump 38 with the fluid apply<br>
chambers 62 and 90 of friction clutches 56, 58 of Figure 2, thus reducing clutch apply<br>
time. The accumulator 204 stores pressurized fluid, as is known in the art. The ball<br>
check valve 203 is biased (e.g., spring loaded) to prevent backflow of the pressurized<br>
fluid to the sump 107 but is opened by a predetermined amount of fluid pressure<br>
delivered from the pump 38 sufficient to overcome the bias. The first additional solenoid<br>
206 is in a closed position when unactuated, with a ball check valve therein preventing<br>
flow from the accumulator 204 to the solenoid valves 104, 106, thus maintaining stored<br>
pressure in the accumulator 204 and the hydraulic lines or passages. The first additional<br>
solenoid 206 receives a control signal 208 from the controller 110 actuating the solenoid<br>
206 and causing it to open (by shifting to the left in Figure 4) to permit flow<br>
therethrough.<br><br>
GP-308901-PTT-DLT<br>
9<br>
[0026]	Referring to Figure 5, another alternative embodiment of a hydraulic<br>
control module 301 utilizes the same components as the hydraulic control module 201 of<br>
Figure 4, except that the ball check valve 203 is replaced with a solenoid valve 306 that<br>
establishes, along with solenoid valves 104, 106 and 206, valve body 302. The solenoid<br>
valve 306 responds to a control signal 316 from the controller 110 to permit pumped,<br>
pressurized hydraulic fluid into the accumulator 204. The solenoid valve 306 allows<br>
more active control of when line pressure is stored than does the ball check valve 203 of<br>
Figure 4. Also, two pressure sensors 308 and 310 are added to monitor the clutch<br>
pressure at the apply chambers 62, 90 of friction clutches 56, 58 of Figure 2, respectively.<br>
The pressure sensors 308, 310 allow feedback clutch pressure control. Such pressure<br>
sensors may be employed in each of the hydraulic control module embodiments<br>
discussed herein.<br>
[0027]	Thus, referring again to Figure 1, the friction clutches 56, 58 are<br>
controlled using hydraulic pressure from an engine-driven transmission pump 38 that is<br>
also used to provide pressure to transmission friction clutches (not shown, but housed<br>
within transmission casing 14, as is known in the art), and therefore allows torque<br>
distribution regardless of a difference in wheel speed. The electronically-controlled<br>
power take-off module 16 is relatively compact in size due to the absence of any<br>
additional pump or pump motor. The torque distribution system 16 permits torque<br>
distribution even when the vehicle wheels 20, 22, 26 and 28 are stationary, i.e., to assist<br>
with torque distribution at launch.<br>
[0028]	While the best modes for carrying out the invention have been described<br>
in detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention relates will recognize various<br>
alternative designs and embodiments for practicing the invention within the scope of the<br>

comparison with known torque distribution systems. The system may include an "active-<br>
on-demand" clutch that is selectively engagable to transfer torque between a front<br>
differential and a rear differential (thereby transferring torque from the front wheels to<br>
the rear wheels) as well as an electronically-limited slip differential clutch selectively<br>
engagable to transfer torque from one front wheel to the other front wheel through the<br>
front differential. Utilization of the transmission hydraulic pump allows pressure to be<br>
provided to engage the clutch even when the wheels are stationary, i.e., to launch the<br>
vehicle.</td>
