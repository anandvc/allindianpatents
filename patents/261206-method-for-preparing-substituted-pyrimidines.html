hi the following Schemes 1-5 the definitions of R1 and R2 in the compounds of Formulae 1 through 9 are as defined above in the Summary of the Invention and description of Embodiments unless otherwise indicated.<br>
As is shown in Scheme 1, a method has now been discovered for preparing ester compounds of Formula 1 from the corresponding acetal compounds of Formula 2 by oxidation with persulfate ion, alternatively identified herein as simply persulfate. Persulfate oxidant refers to an oxidant containing persulfate. ,(Formula Removed)<br>
The persulfate (alternatively spelled persulphate) ion is believed to have the chemical structural formula eOS(0)2OOS(0)2Oe. As persulfate is an anion, reagents containing persulfate (i.e. persulfate oxidants) are generally salts, typically comprising ammonium or an alkali metal as the cation. Commercially available persulfate oxidants include ammonium persulfate, potassium persulfate, potassium peroxymonosulfate (e.g., OXONE®) and sodium persulfate. Ammonium persulfate works particularly well for the present method. A strong sulfur- or phosphorus-containing mineral acid is used in the present method to promote the oxidation reaction. Strong sulfur- or phosphorus-containing mineral acids refers to acids containing sulfur or phosphorus but not carbon and having a pKa of less than 3. Examples of<br>
strong sulfur- or phosphorus-containing mineral acids include sulfur acid and phosphoric acid. Sulfuric acid, which is available at low cost, works well for the present method. Both the persulfate and the acid are usually used in a molar ratio of in a range of about 1 (i.e. 1:1) to 3 (i.e. 3:1) relative to the substrate, with a molar ratio in a range of about 1.1 to 2.2 preferred.<br>
In the present method a compound of Formula 2 is contacted with the persulfate oxidant hi the presence of a strong sulfur- or phosphorus-containing mineral acid and an oxidation resistant solvent. The term "oxidation resistant solvent" refers to solvents that resist oxidation, particularly by persulfate oxidants. The reaction of the present method works particularly well in alkane nitrile solvents, such as, but not limited to, acetonitrile or propionitrile. Acetonitrile gives excellent results and is preferred for reasons including cost and availability. . The reaction can be conducted in a temperature range of about 0 to about 40 °C, with the range of about 25 to about 35 °C preferred. Compounds of Formula 2 can be isolated by conventional methods such as dilution with water, extraction or crystallization and the like, all of which are well known to one skilled in the art. This method is illustrated in Example 7 below.<br>
It will also be appreciated that the alkoxy moieties in compounds of Formula 1 may undergo facile exchange (J. March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, 3rd Ed, Wiley). This transformation can be used to provide compounds of Formula 1 with different R2 groups if desired. This method is illustrated in Example 8 below.<br>
Compounds of Formula 2 can be prepared by treatment of compounds of Formula 3 with ammonia, as illustrated in Scheme 2. ,(Formula Removed)<br>
The reaction generates hydrogen chloride as a byproduct, which binds with ammonia to form ammonium chloride salt. Although ammonia can be formed in situ by contact of ammonium salts such as ammonium chloride or ammonium sulfate with bases, the method is most simply and inexpensively conducted by using at least two molar equivalents of ammonia (one molar equivalent to form the compound of Formula 2 and the other molar equivalent to react with the hydrogen chloride formed). Larger amounts of ammonia increase the speed of reaction. The compounds of Formula 3 are thus contacted with<br>
ammonia generally about ?  to  about 20 molar equibaents  with about   5    TO ABOUT 15  molar<br><br>
equivalents being preferred, typically in a sealed vessel. This animation method is generally conducted in a solvent (i.e. animation solvent), which can comprise one or more of a wide variety of nonacidic organic solvents, for example, ether, alcohol or aromatic solvents. As particular examples, the animation solvent can comprise tetrahydrofuran, p-dioxane, methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, n-butanol, sec-butanol, toluene or xylenes, with ethanol being preferred. The reaction can be conducted between about 60 and about 100 °C and at a pressure of about 100 to about 1000 kPa to provide an effective concentration of ammonia in the amination solvent. Usually conditions in the preferred temperature range of about 70 to about 80 °C and preferred pressure range of about 200 to about 500 kPa are selected to effect the conversion in approximately 8 h. A preferred procedure involves adding the compound of Formula 3 to the amination solvent containing ammonia at a temperature in a range of about 0 to about 40 °C (preferably about 10 to about 30 °C) and then raising the temperature to a range of about 60 to about 100 °C (preferably about 70 to about 80 °C) to effect the reaction. After removal of the inorganic byproducts the product can be isolated by conventional techniques such as extraction, chromatography or crystallization. This method is illustrated by Example 6 below.<br>
Conversion of the hydroxyl moiety in compounds of Formula 4 to the chloro moiety in compounds of Formula 3 is illustrated hi Scheme 3. ,(Formula Removed)<br>
In this method a dehydroxylating-chlorinating agent such as thionyl chloride or more preferably phosphorus oxychloride, is added to a compound of Formula 4 in the presence of N,N-dimetliylformamide. A molar ratio of the dehydroxylatrng-chlorinating agent to the compound of Formula 4 in the range about 1 (i.e. 1:1) to about 1.5 (i.e. 3:2) is operable, with a ratio of about 1.1 to about 1.3 being preferred. The trans formation is usually carried out in at least one additional aprotic solvent such as, but not limited to, dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, chlorobenzene or toluene. Alternatively an excess of 7V,7V-dimethyl-formamide can be used as the solvent. Toluene works very well as a solvent for this method.<br>
The reaction can be conducted in a temperature range of about —5 to about 40 °C. After the initial addition of the chlorinating agent at about -5 to about 0 °C, the reaction mixture is preferably warmed to about ambient temperature (e.g., about 15-40 °C). After<br>
dehydroxylating-chlorrnatrng agent and neutralize acidic byproducts, and the product is isolated by conventional procedures such as distillation, crystallization and the like. This method is illustrated by Example 5 below.<br>
Compounds of Formula 4 can be prepared from compounds of Formula 5 as shown in Scheme 4. ,(Formula Removed)<br>
Chlorination can be achieved in a number of ways, such as by chlorination with elemental chlorine or by use of a reagent such as sodium hypochlorite. When chlorine is used, a compatible solvent must be employed, as well as a base to remove hydrogen chloride formed in the reaction. Typically the base used with chlorine is an alkali metal carboxylate. The solvent used with the chlorinating agent comprising chlorine and an alkali metal carboxylate is typically a carboxylic acid, often the carboxylic acid corresponding to the alkali metal carboxylate. For reasons of cost and convenience, sodium acetate is a preferred alkali metal carboxylate and acetic acid is a preferred carboxylic acid for this method. To achieve high yields and purities of the product of Formula 4, the rate of chlorine addition and the temperature of the reaction mixture should be carefully controlled. The total amount of chlorine added should be as close to 1 molar equivalent relative to the compound of Formula 5 as practical. Typically the measured amount of chlorine corresponds to 1.00 molar equivalents, or very slightly less (e.g., 0.98 molar equivalents) to ensure that excess chlorine is not added. The rate of chlorine addition should be such that the temperature of the reaction can be maintained in the range about 20 to about 35 °C, preferably in the range of about 25 to about 35 °C. The quantity of the base, e.g., alkali metal carboxylate, should be sufficient to absorb the hydrogen chloride generated, and typically is about 1 to about 1.2 molar equivalents. This method is illustrated by Example 4 below.<br>
Alternatively when a reagent such as aqueous sodium hypochloride is used as the chlorinating agent a wide range of chloruiation solvents may be employed, such as alcohols, carboxylic acids, haloalkanes, halobenzenes and unhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., toluene, xylenes). Preferred solvents include toluene, methanol and acetic acid. Typically the reaction is conducted at ambient temperature (e.g., about 20-35 °C).<br>

Compounds of Formula 5 can be prepared by combination of a carboximidamide hydrochloride of Formula 7, an ester of a dialkoxy acetate of Formula 8, an ester of acetic acid of Formula 9, and an alkali metal alkoxide base as shown in Scheme 5. ,(Formula Removed)<br>
 Formula 8 and Formula 9 are added to an alkali metal alkoxide (i.e. MOR2) such as sodium or potassium methoxide, ethoxide, 1-propoxide, 2-propoxide or t-butoxide in a suitable solvent such as toluene, chlorobenzene or heptane. The alcohol (R2OH) formed is removed by distillation. A sufficient excess of the compound of Formula 9 must be used such that at least one molar equivalent relative to the compound of Formula 8 remains available for the reaction after the alcohol R2OH is removed by distillation, possibly involving azeotropes comprising R2OH, the Formula 9 compound and/or solvent. This step provides the sodium salt of the Claisen condensation product of the compounds of Formula 8 and Formula 9 as an intermediate, which is then condensed with the carboximidamide of Formula 7. Preparation of the Claisen condensation product is illustrated by Example 2 below.<br>
In a typical example where toluene is used as solvent and R2 is Et, the alcohol R2OH is removed by distillation as the ethyl acetate-ethanol azeotrope. When all the alcohol formed by contact of the alkali metal alkoxide with the compounds of Formulae 8 and 9 has been removed, a mixture of the carboximidamide hydrochloride of Formula 7 in ethanol is added at ambient temperature. The reaction mixture can then be boiled to drive the reaction to completion and to remove ethanol as the toluene-ethanol azeotrope, leaving the product in a toluene mixture, from which it can be easily obtained by washing of the toluene solution and evaporation. This method is illustrated by Example 3 below.<br>
Methods for the preparation of amidines of Formula 7 and their salts are well known in the art; see, for example, J. Chem. Soc. 1950, 1603 and Japanese patent publication JP 2004/359609. A method of preparation is illustrated by Example 1 below.<br>

EXAMPLE 1 Preparation of cyclopropanecarboxiniidamide monohydrochloride in ethanol solution<br>
Ethyl cyclopropanecarboximidate monohydrochloride (40.5 g 0.27 mol) was added portionwise to a saturated solution of ammonia in ethanol (50 mL). A further portion of ethanol (33 mL) was added. The mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure, and the residue was dissolved in ethanol to give the title composition (83 mL).<br>
EXAMPLE 2 Preparation of the sodium salt of ethyl 4,4-diethoxy-3-oxobutanoate in toluene solution<br>
Sodium ethoxide in ethanol (21 %, 89.5 g, 0.276 mol) was added to toluene (470 mL). The mixture was boiled using a ten-plate Oldershaw column to remove distillate as a ethanol-toluene azeotrope. After a total of about 140 mL of distillate had been removed and the head temperature of the column had risen to 110 °C the mixture was cooled to 80 °C. A mixture of ethyl diethoxyacetate (46.3 g, 0.263 mol) and ethyl acetate (101.5 g, 1.15 mol) was added. The mixture was boiled to remove the excess ethyl acetate as an ethyl acetate-ethanol azeotrope.<br>
When the pot temperature reached about 115 °C and the column head temperature reached about 105 °C, about 112 mL of distillate had been removed, leaving about 420 mL of residue in the pot. The mixture was then allowed to cool to provide the title composition.<br>
