The reaction time is usually within the range of 5 minutes to 7 2 hours.  The reaction temperature is usually within the range of -20°C to 100°C (provided that, when a solvent used has a boiling point below 100°C, -20°C to the boiling point of the solvent), preferably -5°C to 100°C (provided that, when a solvent used has a boiling point<br>
below 100°C, -5°C to the boiling point of the solvent) .<br>
The reaction can be carried out at any molar ratio of the compound of the formula (II) to the carboxylic acid compound of the formula (III) or a reactive derivative thereof, but preferably at a ratio of one mole to one mole or around this ratio.
