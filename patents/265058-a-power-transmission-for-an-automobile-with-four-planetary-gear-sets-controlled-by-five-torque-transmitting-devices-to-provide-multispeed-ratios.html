8-SPEED TRANSMISSION<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of United States Provisional Patent Application<br>
No. 60/912,964, filed April 20th, 2007, and which is hereby incorporated by reference in its<br>
entirety.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002]	The present invention relates to a power transmission having four planetary gear<br>
sets that are controlled by five torque-transmitting devices to provide at least eight forward<br>
speed ratios and at least one reverse speed ratio.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003]	Passenger vehicles include a pbwertrain that is comprised of an engine, multi-<br>
speed transmission, and a differential or final drive. The mulfi-speed transmission increases<br>
the overall operating range of the vehicle by permitting the engine to operate through its torque<br>
range a number of times. The number of forward speed ratios that are available in the<br>
transmission determines the number of times the engine torque range is repeated. Early<br>
automatic transmissions had two speed ranges. This severely limited the overall speed range<br>
of the vehicle and therefore required a relatively large engine that could produce a wide speed<br>
and torque range. This resulted in the engine operating at a specific fuel consumption point<br>
during cruising, other than the most efficient point. Therefore, manually-shifted (countershaft<br>
transmissions) were the most popular.<br>
[0004]	With the advent of three- and four-speed automatic transmissions, the automatic<br>
shifting (planetary gear) transmission increased in popularity with the motoring public. These<br>
transmissions improved the operating performance and fuel economy of the vehicle. The<br>
increased number of speed ratios reduces the step size between ratios and therefore improves<br><br>
P001212-PTT-DLT<br>
2<br>
the shift quality of the transmission by making the ratio interchanges substantially<br>
imperceptible to the operator under normal vehicle acceleration.<br>
[0005]	Six-speed transmissions offer several advantages over four- and five-speed<br>
transmissions, including improved vehicle acceleration and improved fuel economy. While<br>
many trucks employ power transmissions having six or more forward speed ratios, passenger<br>
cars are still manufactured with three- and four-speed automatic transmissions and relatively<br>
few five- or six-speed devices due to the size and complexity of these transmissions.<br>
[0006]	Seven-, eight- and nine-speed transmissions provide further improvements in<br>
acceleration and fuel economy over six-speed transmissions. However, like the six-speed<br>
transmissions discussed above, the development of seven-, eight- and nine-speed transmissions<br>
has been precluded because of complexity, size and cost.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007]	The present invention provides an improved transmission having four planetary<br>
gear sets controlled to provide at least eight forward speed ratios and at least one reverse speed<br>
ratio.<br>
[0008]	The transmission family of the present invention has four planetary gear sets,<br>
each of which includes a first, second and third member, which members may comprise a sun<br>
gear, a ring gear, or a planet carrier assembly member, in any order.<br>
[0009]	In referring to the first, second, third and fourth gear sets in this description and<br>
in the claims, these sets may be counted "first" to "fourth" in any order in the drawing (i.e.,<br>
left to right, right to left, etc.). Additionally, the first, second or third members of each gear<br>
set may be counted "first" to "third" in any order in the drawing (i.e., top to bottom, bottom<br>
to top, etc.) for each gear set.<br>
[0010]	Each carrier member can be either a single-pinion carrier member (simple) or a<br>
double-pinion carrier member (compound). Embodiments with long pinions are also possible.<br><br>
P001212-PTT-DLT<br>
3<br>
[0011]	A first interconnecting member continuously connects the second member of<br>
the first planetary gear set with the third member of the second planetary gear set.<br>
[0012]	A second interconnecting member continuously connects the second member of<br>
the second planetary gear set with the first member of the third planetary gear set.<br>
[0013]	A third interconnecting member continuously connects the third member of the<br>
third planetary gear set with the third member of the fourth planetary gear set.<br>
[0014]	A fourth interconnecting member continuously connects the first member of the<br>
first planetary gear set with the first member of the fourth planetary gear set.<br>
[0015]	A fifth interconnecting member continuously connects the third member of the<br>
first planetary gear set with the second member of the third planetary gear set.<br>
[0016]	The input member is continuously connected with the first member of the first<br>
planetary gear set. The output member is continuously connected with the second member of<br>
the fourth planetary gear set.<br>
[0017]	A first torque-transmitting device, such as a brake, selectively connects the third<br>
member of the first planetary gear set with a stationary member (transmission housing/casing).<br>
[0018]	A second torque-transmitting device, such as a brake, selectively connects the<br>
first member of the second planetary gear set with a stationary member (transmission<br>
housing/casing).<br>
[0019]	A third torque-transmitting device, such as a brake, selectively connects the<br>
second member of the second planetary gear set with a stationary member (transmission<br>
housing/casing).<br>
[0020]	A fourth torque-transmitting device, such as a clutch, selectively connects the<br>
first member of the first planetary gear set with the second member of the first planetary gear<br>
set.<br>
[0021]	A fifth torque-transmitting device, such as a clutch, selectively connecting the<br>
second member of the first planetary gear set with the second member of the fourth planetary<br>
gear set.<br><br>
P001212-PTT-DLT<br>
4<br>
[0022]	The five torque-transmitting devices are selectively engageable in combinations<br>
of two to yield at least eight forward speed ratios and at least one reverse speed ratio.<br>
[0023]	A variety of speed ratios and ratio spreads can be realized by suitably selecting<br>
the tooth ratios of the planetary gear sets.<br>
[0024]	The above features and other features and advantages of the present invention<br>
are readily apparent from the following detailed description of the best modes for carrying out<br>
the invention when taken in connection with the accompanying drawings.<br>

P001212-PTT-DLT<br>

[0038]	As shown in Figure lb, and in particular the truth table disclosed therein, the<br>
torque-transmitting devices are selectively engaged in combinations of two to provide at least<br>
eight forward speed ratios and at least one reverse speed ratio all with single transition<br>
sequential shifts, and including two overdrive ratios.<br>
[0039]	As set forth above, the engagement schedule for the torque-transmitting devices<br>
is shown in the truth table of Figure lb. The chart of Figure lb describes the gear ratios and<br>
ratio steps that are attained in the above described transmission. For example, the step ratio<br>
between the first and second forward speed ratios is 1.59, while the step ratio between the<br>
reverse speed ratio and first forward ratio is -0.60.<br>
[0040]	Referring to Figure lc, the embodiment of powertrain 10 depicted in Fig. la is<br>
illustrated in a lever diagram format. A lever diagram is a schematic representation of the<br>
components of a mechanical device such as an automatic transmission. Each individual lever<br>
represents a planetary gearset, wherein the three basic mechanical components of the planetary<br>
gear are each represented by a node. Therefore, a single lever contains three nodes: one for<br>
the sun gear member, one for the planet gear carrier member, and one for the ring gear<br>
member. The relative length between the nodes of each lever can be used to represent the ring-<br>
to-sun ratio of each respective gearset. These lever ratios, in turn, are used to vary the gear<br>
ratios of the transmission in order to achieve appropriate ratios and ratio progression.<br>
Mechanical couplings or interconnections between the nodes of the various planetary gear sets<br>
are illustrated by thin, horizontal lines and torque transmitting devices such as clutches and<br>
brakes are presented as interleaved fingers. If the device is a brake, one set of the fingers is<br>
grounded. Further explanation of the format, purpose and use of lever diagrams can be found<br>
in SAE Paper 810102, authored by Benford, Howard and Leising, Maurice, "The Lever<br>
Analogy: A New Tool in Transmission Analysis", 1981, which is hereby fully incorporated by<br>
reference.<br>
[0041]	The powertrain 10 includes an input member 17 continuously connected with the<br>
engine 12, an output member 19 continuously connected with the final drive 16, a first<br><br>
P001212-PTT-DLT<br>
8<br>
planetary gear set 20A having three nodes: a first node 22A, a second node 26A and a third<br>
node 24A; a second planetary gear set 30A having three nodes: a first node 32A, a second<br>
node 36A and a third node 34A; a third planetary gear set 40A having three nodes: a first node<br>
42A, a second node 46A and a third node 44A; and a fourth planetary gear set 50A having<br>
three nodes: a first node 52A, a second node 56A and a third node 54A.<br>
[0042]	The input member 17 is continuously connected with the node 22A and the<br>
output member 19 is continuously connected with the node 56A.<br>
[0043]	The node 26A is continuously connected with the node 34A. The node 36A is<br>
continuously connected with the node 42A. The node 44A is continuously connected with<br>
node 54A. The node 22A is continuously connected with node 52A. The node 24A is<br>
continuously connected with the node 46A.<br>
[0044]	A first torque-transmitting device, such as brake 80, selectively connects the<br>
node 24A with the transmission housing 60. A second torque-transmitting device, such as<br>
brake 82, selectively connects the node 32A with the transmission housing 60. A third torque-<br>
transmitting device, such as brake 84, selectively connects the node 36A with the transmission<br>
housing 60. A fourth torque-transmitting device, such as clutch 85, selectively connects the<br>
node 22A with the node 26A. A fifth torque-transmitting device, such as clutch 86, selectively<br>
connects the node 26A with the node 56A.<br>
[0045]	To establish ratios, two torque-transmitting devices are engaged for each gear<br>
state. The engaged torque-transmitting devices are represented by an "X" in each respective<br>
row in Figure lb. For example, to establish reverse gear, the brake 80 and clutch 86 are<br>
engaged. The brake 80 engages the node 24A with the transmission housing 60. The clutch<br>
86 engages the node 26A with the node 56A. Likewise, the eight forward ratios are achieved<br>
through different combinations of clutch engagement as per Figure lb.<br>
[0046]	The powertrain 10 may share components with a hybrid vehicle, and such a<br>
combination may be operable in a "charge-depleting mode". For purposes of the present<br>
invention, a "charge-depleting mode" is a mode wherein the vehicle is powered primarily by an<br><br>
P001212-PTT-DLT<br>
9<br>
electric motor/generator such that a battery is depleted or nearly depleted when the vehicle<br>
reaches its destination. In other words, during the charge-depleting mode, the engine 12 is only<br>
operated to the extent necessary to ensure that the battery is not depleted before the destination is<br>
reached. A conventional hybrid vehicle operates in a "charge-sustaining mode", wherein if the<br>
battery charge level drops below a predetermined level (e.g., 25%) the engine is automatically<br>
run to recharge the battery. Therefore, by operating in a charge-depleting mode, the hybrid<br>
vehicle can conserve some or all of the fuel that would otherwise be expended to maintain the<br>
25% battery charge level in a conventional hybrid vehicle. It should be appreciated that a hybrid<br>
vehicle powertrain is preferably only operated in the charge-depleting mode if the battery can be<br>
recharged after the destination is reached by plugging it into an energy source.<br>
[0047]	While the best modes for carrying out the invention have been described in<br>
detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention relates will recognize various<br>
alternative designs and embodiments for practicing the invention within the scope of the<br>
appended claims.<br><br>
