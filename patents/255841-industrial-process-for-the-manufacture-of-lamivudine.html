INDUSTRIAL PROCESS FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF LAMIVUDINE FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to simple, economical, cost-effective method for the preparation of lamivudine of formula (I).<br>
INTRODUCTION<br>
Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is a fatal disease of the immune system transmitted through blood especially by sexual contact or contaminated needles and is presumed to be caused by the HIV virus, which is an RNA genetically unique retrovirus, having a gene not found to date in other retroviruses. The HIV virus appears to preferentially attack receptive T-cells also known as CD4+ cells. These cells are white blood cells that turn the immune system on to fight disease. The virus invades the receptive T-cells and the T-cells become an HIV virus producer. The receptive T-cell is quickly damaged and their number in the human being is depleted to such an extent that the body's beta-cell as well as other T-cells no longer function normally and thereby destroys the body's ability to fight infections (US 4 837 208 and US 4 828 838, Zidovudine).<br>
Many of the nucleosides and their analogues belonging to the important class of therapeutic agents, have proved as effective drugs against hepatitis B virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and human T-lymphotropic virus due to their antiviral activity (Ref: US 5 693 787).<br>
One of the many drugs found to be active against HIV virus is Lamivudine of formula (I), chemically known as (-)-l-[(2R,5S)-2-(hydroxymethyl)-l,3, oxathiolan-5-yl]cytosine.<br><br>
2<br><br>
Lamivudine is (-) enantiomer of dideoxy analogue of cytidine, marketed under the trade name Epivir. It is an anti-retroviral agent belonging to the class of the drugs called "Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTI)." Lamivudine inhibits HIVI, HIV2 reverse transcriptase and also the reverse transcriptase of hepatitis B. The therapeutic action of lamivudine is due to the intracellular conversion of lamivudine to the active metabolite lamivudine-S'-triphosphate, which inhibits the RNA and DNA dependant activities of HIV reverse transcriptase by termination of the viral DNA chain. Lamivudine, exhibits little effect on mammalian cell and mitochondrial DNA content and does not interfere with cellular deoxynucleotide metabolism. (Ref: http://en.wikipedia.ora/wiki/Lamivudine. http://xweb.crha-<br>
health.ab.ea/clin/sac/larnivudi.huru http://home.intekom.com/pharm/aspen-p/a-lamiv.html and Drug Label qntp://wwwJ)Ja.aov/cder/foi/label/2004/21003s005.21004s0061bl.pdf)<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Lamivudine of formula (I) contains two chiral centers, and exists as four diastereomers (two in the cis-configuration and two in the trans-configuration). However, prior art indicates that only the cis isomer of compound (I) exhibits the desired biological activity (Ref: US 5 693 787).<br>
It is well known in the prior art, that optical isomers of pharmaceutical compounds having an asymmetric center, invariably exibit different physiological activities. One optical form may be bioactive, while the other could be inactive or toxic.<br><br>
3<br>
It is found that among the cis isomers of the compound of formula (I) only (-) enantiomer has considerably lower cytotoxicity and should be provided with the purity of the desired isomer being above 99% (WO 91/17159).<br>
US   5 047 407 (assigned to IAF BioChem International) discloses a process for the preparation of of formula (I) according to the method represented in Scheme-1.<br><br>
Scheme-1: Method as disclosed in US 5 047 407 for preparation of compound of formula (I).<br>
The method summarized in Scheme-1 discloses the preparation of 2-benzoyloxymethyl-5-(N-acetylcytosin-l-yl)-l,3-oxathiolane (VI) by reaction of 2-benzoyloxymethyl-5-ethoxy-l,3-oxathiolane (II) with silylated cytosine (III) in the presence of a catalyst like<br><br>
4<br>
trimethylsilyl triflate with three days of refluxing. The racemic product (IV) was then acetylated to give compound of formula (V), which was purified by column chromatography to give the cis isomer of 2-benzoyloxymethyl-5-(N-acetyl-cytosin-l-yl)-1,3-oxathiolane (VI), which was then hydrolyzed to give lamivudine of formula (I).<br>
This method suffers from the drawback of longer reaction times, and further the product obtained has to be purified by column chromatography, which is cumbersome and time-consuming on an industrial scale.<br>
Also, separation by column chromatography does not give a single enantiomer but gives 60:40 ratio of trans: cis isomers respectively i.e. the cis isomer (desired isomer) is obtained in low yield compare to undesired isomer i.e. trans isomer. Therefore, this method is not suitable for industrial scale.<br>
WO 91/17159 discloses another method for preparation of (+)-cis-4-amino-l-(2-benzoyloxymethyl-l,3-oxathiolane-5-yl)-lH-pyrimidin-2-one of formula (IV) and lamivudine of formula (I), according to the method summarised in Scheme-2.<br>
The method involves reaction of 5-methoxy-l,3-oxathiolane-2-methanol benzoate (VIII) with silylated cytosine (III) in presence of trimethylsilyl trifluromethane sulfonate to give (±)-cis-4-amino-l-(2-benzoyloxymethyl-l,3-oxathiolane-5-yl)-(lH)-pyrimidin-2-one (IV). Deprotection of hydroxy group on an amberlite resin column gives (±)-cis-4-amino-1 -(2-hydroxymethyl-1,3 -oxathiolane-5-yl)-( 1 H)-pyrimidin-2-one (I-b), which is then separated by chromatography using a chiral column to give lamivudine of formula (I).<br>
This method has the following drawbacks:<br>
a)	utilizing a hazardous chemical like trimethylsilyl trifluromethane sulfonate,<br>
b)	employs column chromatography twice, firstly by using a resin column for deprotecting hydroxy group and secondly using a chiral column for separation of desired isomer. Utilization of chromatography extensively, increases the cost of<br><br>
5<br>
the  process,  since  this  involves  lot  of solvent,  the  method  is  also  quite cumbersome since it involves a lot of time.<br><br>
Scheme-2: Method as disclosed in WO 91/17159 for preparation of compound of formula (I).<br>
US 6 329 522 (assigned to Glaxo Group Ltd) discloses preparation of compound of formula (I), according to method summarized in Scheme-3.<br>
The method involves preparation of compound of formula (I) from the optically active intermediate (2R,5R)-5-hydroxy-[l,3]-oxathiolane-2-carboxylic acid - 2S-isopropyl-5R-methyl-lR-cyclohexyl ester (IX), which is then converted to its chloro derivative (X) by reaction with a mixture of thionyl chloride / DMF in presence of methanesulphonic acid.<br><br>
6<br><br>
Scheme-3: Method as disclosed in US 6 329 522 for preparation of compound of formula (I).<br>
The chloro derivative (X) is then reacted with silylated cytosine (III) in presence of triethylamine to give (2R,5R)-5-(4-amino-oxo-2H-pyrimidine-l-yl)-[l,3]oxathiolane-2-carboxylic acid - 2S -isopropyl-5R-methyl-lR-cyclohexyl ester (XI). The menthyl ester group of compound after hydrolysis in alkaline conditions is treated with salicylic acid to give lamivudine monosalicylate (XII), which on treatment with triethyl amine in methylated spirit gives lamivudine of formula (I).<br>
This patent further neither mentions optical purity nor the yield of (2R,5R)-5-(4-Amino-oxo-2H-pyrimidine-l-yl)-[l,3]oxathiolane-2-carboxylic acid-2S-isopropyl-5R-methyl-lR-cyclohexyl ester, thus obtained.<br>
US 5 204 466 (assigned to Emory University) also describes a method as disclosed in Scheme-4 for preparation of lamivudine, which comprises reaction of compound of<br><br>
7<br>
formula (XV) with silylated cytosine in the presence of Lewis acid such as SnCl4, to give compound of formula (XVI) in 80 % yield after flash chromatography.<br><br>
Scheme-4: Method as disclosed in US 5 204 466 for preparation of compound of formula (I).<br>
However, this method requires flash chromatography to get the desired isomer of the compound, which however, is not feasible on the commercial scale.<br>
WO 92/20669 discloses two methods Method-A (Scheme-5A) and Method-B (Scheme-   . 5B) for the preparation of lamivudine of formula (I).<br><br>
8<br><br>
Scheme-5(A):  Method-A as disclosed in WO 92/20669 for the preparation of Lamivudine of formula (I).<br><br>
9<br><br>
Scheme-5(B): Method-B as disclosed in WO 92/20669 for the preparation of Lamivudine of formula (I).<br>
Both these methods utilize a hazardous reagent like iodotrimethylsilane and t-butyldimethylsilyl triflate for the preparation of menthyl ester derivative of lamivudine. Further, repeated steps of fractional crystallization reduces the yield and increases the cost of utilities and labour required for these repeated steps.<br>
Thus the prior art methods suffer from the following drawbacks:<br>
a)  these methods utilizes a hazardous and a costly reagent like iodotrimethylsilane, which is expensive for utilization on an industrial scale.<br><br>
10<br>
b)	utilization of reagents like trimethylsilyl trifluoromethane sulfonate or Lewis acids does not lead to preferential synthesis of the desired isomer intermediate and requires separation of the desired isomer by chromatographic techniques.<br>
c)	reaction involving silylated cytosine (III), is quite long and time consuming even after utilization of costly reagents like trimethylsilyl triflate.<br>
d)	repeated fractional crystallization reduces the yield and consequently increases the cost of utilities, labour etc.<br>
The present inventors have therefore developed a method, which overcomes the drawbacks of prior art and provides a improved process for preparation of Lamivudine of formula (I).<br>
Futher, it has been reported in literature (US 5 905 082) that lamivudine exists in two polymorphs, known as Polymorphic Form I and Form II.<br>
Form I is abtained by crystallization from aqueous solution, in the form of needle shaped crystals. However, this form is not suitable for pharmaceutical formulation in the form of solid dosage forms because of unfavourable properties for preparing dosage form.<br>
Form II is bipyramidal and preferred in the manufacture of solid dosage form. This form is obtained by recrystallization from non-aqueous media, like lower alcohols such as ethanol, industrial methylated spirit etc.<br>
WO 03/027106 Al discloses that Form II of Lamuvidine of formula (I) is obtained by crystallization of lamivudine from solvents like ethyl acetate, acetonitrile, aliphatic ketones, esters, either straight chain or branched chain ethers containing d-8 atoms.<br>
This PCT application discloses that straight chain or branched chain ethers containing C1. 8 atoms can be used for crystallizing lamivudine to give Form-II polymorph. However there are no enabling disclosures for their preparation and neither mentions the ethers that could be employed for preparing Form-II lamivudine.<br><br>
11<br>
The present inventors have found that Form-II polymorph of lamivudine of formula (I)<br><br>
can be obtained by the utilization of cyclic ethers like tetrahydrofuran.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the invention is to provide simple and cost effective process, without isolation of any intermediate, for the preparation of (-)-l-[(2R, 5S)-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3, oxathiolan-5-yl]cytosine of formula (I).<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a process for the preparation of (-)-l-[(2R, 5S)-2-(hydroxymethyl)-l? 3-oxathiolan-5-yl] cytosine of formula (I) having the desired yield and optical purity.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to make the process commercially viable by avoiding the separation of diastereomers to give lamivudine of formula (I).<br>
A still further object of the invention is to provide a process for preparation of a compound of formula (I), which avoids the use of costly reagents like trimethylsilyl iodide and instead employs a mixture of trimethylsilyl chloride and alkali metal iodide, thereby making the process cost-effective.<br>
Yet a still further object of the invention is to provide a process for preparation of formula (I), while avoiding the use of high volume of the solvent for getting the desired form of Lamivudine of formula (I).<br>
Still, another object of the invention is to utilize cyclic ethers for getting the desired Form-II of Lamivudine of formula (I), without preparation of lamivudine salicylate of formula (XII).<br><br>
12<br>
