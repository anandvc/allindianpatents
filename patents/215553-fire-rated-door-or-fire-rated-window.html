				<td>Title: Fire rated door or fire rated window<br>
Description<br>
The present invention relates to a fire rated door or fire rated window which are<br>
installed in fire protection partitions to prevent the spread of smoke and fire.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a fire rated door or fire rated window<br>
to prevent the spread of smoke and fire, suitable for use in the region of a fire<br>
protection partition, said fire rated door or fire rated window comprising a mobile<br>
frame with its filling compartment, which consists of a fire resistant material, and<br>
the mobile frame is partially or completely enclosed by a stationary frame<br>
component, characterised in that the fire rated door and the fire rated window<br>
consist of a fire resistant plastic material which is a glass fiber reinforced plastic<br>
material with glass fiber ravings being used and arranged in axial direction, as<br>
the support material in the plastic material.<br>
This fire rated door type is for example disclosed by EP 0 401 555 A2, where a glass pane<br>
is mounted in a metal frame equipped with a surrounding groove. In this case, the glass<br>
pane ends before the frame and is connected with the metal frame by means of additional<br>
metal edge strips serving as compensating adapters. The metal strips are glued with<br>
traditional fire rated glue for example made on water-glass base.<br>
EP 0 612 910 A2 displays a closing ledge for metal doors, which ledge, to increase<br>
stability in the lower part, is pressed between two protruding legs.<br>
A door frame profile for fire rated doors is disclosed by EP 0 444 393 A2, where a glass<br>
pane is retained in a strong door frame profile. The door frame profile is executed as<br>
hollow section and it presents, inserted into its chambers, fire rated plates that guarantee<br>
the fire resistance of such door.<br>
A fire-resistant glazing is described in DE 296 45 259 A1. In this case, silicate glass panes<br>
made from tempered glass are used on the one side, and a reinforced silicate glass pane<br>
is used on the other side of an intermediate air gap. The construction of such fire-resistant<br>
glazing is realised by means of a metal frame embracing and overlapping the border<br>
edge.<br><br>
DE 297 42 665 A1 reveals a fire retarding swing door or center pivoted door, where the<br>
door frame respectively the borders of the door leaves present a thermal insulation<br>
material, extending over the entire length respectively the entire width. This thermal<br>
insulation material will expand when heat develops, such that in the event of fire, the door<br>
component includes a secure fire barrier. This door is composed of plane material, which<br>
is not transparent and, in a partial section, is interrupted by a window to be mounted.<br>
The object of the invention is to conceive a fire rated door or a fire rated window<br>
abandoning the materials conventionally used for fire protection purposes, like light metal,<br>
wood or steel, and to manufacture said construction units at reduced cost.<br>
It is therefore proposed to manufacture the mobile as well as the stationary door frame of<br>
a fire rated door or of a fire rated window with profiles made from a fire resistant plastic<br>
material. Fire rated doors and windows are installed into fire rated walls and in the event<br>
of danger, serve the purpose to stop the spread of a fire and also of smoke. For this<br>
reason, fire rated doors and fire rated windows are classified according to corresponding<br><br>
fire rating classes. These individual fire-rating classes are organised according to the time<br>
the individual construction units will resist to a fire.<br>
The profiles, no matter whether they are solid profiles or hollow profiles with different<br>
cavities, are preferably arranged to build frames used for fire rated doors or fire rated<br>
windows. Either a multilayer glass pane, generally used as fire rated glass pane with<br>
correspondingly arranged fire protection layers, which will absorb the thermal radiation<br>
due to the heat development, or a fire resistant plastic material composed as plane<br>
material, can be employed as filling compartment within the frame.<br>
According to the invention it is also conceivable, to manufacture the frame and the filling<br>
compartment as a single piece in mouldings. Likewise in case of a low fire rating class, a<br>
fire rated door or a fire rated window may be arranged in that the frame manufactured<br>
from plastic is embedded between two glass panes. In this case, the spaced glass panes<br>
can extend as far as to the exterior border of the mobile frame. In case a higher fire rating<br>
class is chosen, a transparent fire protection material can be introduced between the<br>
spaced glass panes. This fire protection material can consist of a fire rated glass pane as<br>
described before or also of a liquid fire protection gel.<br>
The fire resistant plastic material consists of a support material in form of endless glass<br>
fiber rovings arranged in axial direction of the profile. This "raw profile" is moreover<br>
reinforced in radial direction with an additional glass fiber complex. For this purpose, the<br>
glass fibers are impregnated with a resin matrix and hardened in a moulding that<br>
corresponds to the profile"s form. The moulding is in this case heated to ensure a faster<br>
manufacturing process.<br>
The employed resin matrix basically consists of unsaturated polyester resins including<br>
appropriate hardeners, accelerators, additives and this is the most important, fire retarding<br>
fillers. Corresponding colours are added in form of colour pastes to achieve an adaptation<br>
to the aesthetics of existing buildings. Such fire rated doors can be executed as sliding<br>
doors, as well as single leaf or double leaf doors with or without rebate. As the production<br>
of such profile forms is almost without limits, it is also possible to combine corresponding<br>
profiles.<br>
With corresponding design, such mobile frame can also be manufactured from fire<br>
resistant plastic material as stationary frame. If hollow profiles are used, they can be filled<br>
partially or completely with fire protection material.<br><br>
