Shower Support<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention is based on a support with which a shower head may be mounted at a particular<br>
distance from a fixed location.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
There are a wide variety of supports with which a shower head may be detachably, or permanently,<br>
mounted at a distance from a wall. In the case of a known support of that type, a pair of shower<br>
heads that may be pivoted about mutually parallel axes is arranged between the legs of a U-shaped,<br>
curved arm. The wall-mounting arm, which is configured from hollow, profiled stock, serves as a<br>
water conduit. The pair of shower heads are identically configured and simultaneously supplied with<br>
water from a common water supply.<br>
Other types of wall-mounting supports have just a single shower head that is either attached directly<br>
to the arm, or is detachable therefrom.<br>
Reference may be made to US 6,442, 775 relating to a shower fixture comprising:<br>
a base adapted to be fixed to a wall, connected to a pressurized-water supply, and having a<br>
pressvirized water outlet;<br>
a pair of generally parallel and spaced tubes having inner ends pivotal about an inner horizontal axis<br>
on the base and outer ends, at least one of the tubes being internally connected at the base to the<br>
outlet, whereby pressurized water can flow from the supply through the base to the tube;<br>
an element joining together the two tubes for joint pivoting; and<br>
a shower head mounted betwieen the outer ends, pivotal on the tube about an outer horizontal axis,<br>
and connected internally at the outer axis to the one tube, whereby water from the one tube can flow<br>
into the head.<br>
However, the above said patent does not disclose inventive features of the proposed application so as<br>
to get the desired technical effect.<br>
Further, reference may be made to US 4, 901, 927 in which both shower heads can be supplied with<br>
water independently from each other but the further shower head is not supplied by a hose and can<br>
not be removed from its fixture.<br>
Further, a shower apparatus with a shower member is known in the art, for which reference may be<br>
made to US 1,354,838.<br><br>
The patent discloses a shower apparatus comprising a shower tube, a T-shaped coupling member<br>
therein having an internal valve seat opposite the middle port of said coupling number, and a shower<br>
member having a tubular shank threaded into the middle orifice of said coupling member and<br>
provided with a valve to engage said interior valve seat to selectively close the water supply passage<br>
to said shower member without closing the passage from one end port of said coupling member to its<br>
other end port. Further it also relates to a shower apparatus comprising a shower tube, one or more<br>
T-shaped coupling members therein each having a valve seat, and one or more individual shower<br>
members having a tubular shank threaded into one orifice of a coupling member and provided with a<br>
valve to engage the valve seat of the coupling member to close a water supply passage to said<br>
shower member through its shank.<br>
In the above said invention, the tilting of the shower tube opens and closes a valve which controls<br>
the water flow through the shower tube which implies that in a particular position no water flows<br>
into the shower tube.<br>
Therefore, it is not required to provide the uppermost shower head with a hose for which an<br>
additional valve would be necessary.<br>
Further, as can be seen from the left column of the first page of the specification that, this known<br>
invention is related to an improved adjustable shower unit with cut off mechanism. This cut off<br>
mechanism is implemented by the two-way valve and controlled by the shower tube.<br>
The uppermost shower head of the reference cited can be supplied with water independently from<br>
the other shower heads, but the shower attachment of the reference can be used only if the support is<br>
positioned at a very low height namely in the bath tub. This results from the fact that, the handle for<br>
the valve for the uppermost shower head is arranged at the end of the shower tube.<br>
The problem addressed by the invention is creating a shower support that will provide additional<br>
showering opportunities and means for devising showering procedures.<br>
In order to solve the problem, the invention proposes a shower support having those features stated<br>
under principal claim. Elaborations on the invention are covered under subclaims.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In addition to the usual shower fixture or usual shower head, the shower support proposed by the<br>
invention thus has attached to it a second shower fixture that will hereinafter be referred to as an<br>
"additional shower fixture". The latter may beneficially be a showering fixture whose shape,<br>
dimensions, and/or design differ<br><br>
from those of the main shower fixture. For example, it might be a small shower<br>
head, or one that yields a jet having a totally different structure.<br>
In particular, under an elaboration on the invention, it may be provided that the<br>
additional shower fixture has its own water supply in order that it may be supplied<br>
with water, if desired, even water at a different temperature, independently of the<br>
main shower head, where it will be beneficial if it is provided that the additional<br>
shower fixture may be connected to the main shower fixture in order that the<br>
former may then be operated either in combination with the main shower fixture, or<br>
alone.<br>
The separate water supply to the at least one additional shower fixture may be<br>
effected by, for example, providing that it has its own water supply in the form of its<br>
own shower hose. However, it will be particularly judicious if it is supplied with<br>
water via a channel arranged within the arm. That channel may, for example, be<br>
connected to a hose connected to a line coming from the mixer faucet, in the<br>
vicinity of the mounting fixture. However, it will also be feasible If the channel is<br>
connected directly to a water line inside the mounting fixture in order that no<br>
conduits will be visible from outside.<br>
One way in which a water-supply channel may be configured is configuring the arm<br>
in the form of a length of hollow, profiled stock, at least out to the additional shower<br>
fixture.<br>
The location at which the additional shower fixture is arranged may be chosen to<br>
suit the showering procedure desired. The additional shower fixture may, for<br>
example, be mounted immediately adjacent to, or even outboard of, the main<br>
shower fixture. However, it will be particularly judicious if it is arranged between the<br>
mounting fixture and the support for the main shower head. It may be mounted<br>
such that supplements the jet, or array of jets, exiting the main shower fixture.<br><br>
Under an elaboration on the invention, it may be provided that the direction of the<br>
jet exiting the additional shower fixture is adjustable, where adjustments thereof<br>
may be accomplished by, for example, either altering the positioning of the<br>
additional shower fixture as a whole or altering merely part of the additional shower<br>
fixture. In particular, rotating it about a fixed, relative to the arm, axis represents<br>
one means of adjustment.<br>
According to the invention, under an elaboration thereon, it may be provided that<br>
the at least one additional shower fixture is mounted on the side of the wall-<br>
mounted arm. If several additional shower fixtures are to be involved, it will be<br>
judicious to mount them on both sides of the wall-mounting arm. Of course,<br>
mounting an additional shower fixture on the underside of the wall-mounting arm<br>
will also be feasible, and is proposed by the invention.<br>
If several additional shower fixtures are present, the invention proposes that all of<br>
them be supplied by a common water supply. Groups of additional shower fixtures<br>
may be formed, if desired, in which case, a single, common, water conduit<br>
supplying all additional shower fixtures of every group would be provided.<br>
According to the invention, under an elaboration thereon, it may be provided that<br>
the at least one additional shower fixture is permanently attached to the arm, rather<br>
than being detachable therefrom, where "permanently attached" does not mean<br>
that the shower fixture involved is nonadjustable. "Permanently attached" shall also<br>
be construed as implying that the additional shower fixture involved will still be<br>
detachable using a tool. Attaching an additional shower fixture to the wall-mounting<br>
arm using a quick-connect coupler, for example, a plug-in connector, is also<br>
feasible, and is proposed by the invention. The plug-in connector employed will<br>
then be configured such that no water will exit when the additional shower fixture<br>
involved is detached.<br><br>
It will be particularly beneficial if the arm may be pivoted about a horizontal, relative<br>
to its mounting fixture, axis in order that the receptacle for the hand-held shower<br>
head or shower head may be swung downward in order to adjust the shower<br>
head's location to suit users of various heights. That axis will then be orthogonal to<br>
the longitudinal axis of the arm. The arm may also be rotated about a horizontal<br>
axis coincident with its longitudinal axis in order to shift the direction of the jet<br>
exiting the shower head to the left or right.<br>
According to the invention, it may be provided that, even if the wall-mounting arm is<br>
mounted on the mounting fixture such that it may be pivoted or rotated, the water<br>
conduit passes through the linkage joining them, which may be accomplished by,<br>
for example, providing a sealed feedthrough, or a hose passing through that<br>
linkage.<br>
The shape of the wall-mounting arm may be arbitrary, provided that only a single<br>
additional shower fixture may be attached thereto, which dictates that the wall-<br>
mounting arm must have certain minimum dimensions. For example, under an<br>
elaboration on the invention, it may be provided that the wall-mounting arm is<br>
configured In the form of a fork whose tines may begin at a particular distance from<br>
the mounting fixture. If such a forked arm is employed, according to the invention, it<br>
may be provided that the additional shower fixtures are arranged on the outer<br>
faces of both of its tines, which will allow obtaining a more divergent array of jets,<br>
or a more divergent jet.<br>
The shower head may, as usual, be supplied with water by a shower hose, in<br>
which case, ttie connector for connecting the shower hose to the water supply may<br>
also be located on the wall-mounting arm's mounting fixture.<br>
Other features, details, and benefits of the invention will be evident from the<br>
following description of a preferred embodiment of the invention, the claims and the<br><br>
abstract, whose wordings are herewith mack part of this description by way of reference<br>
thereto, and the accompanying drawings, which depict:<br>
Fig. 1	a schematized side view of a shower support according to the invention;<br>
Fig. 2	a top view of the shower support shown in Fig. 1;<br>
Fig. 3	a second embodiment of a shower support according to the invention.<br>
Fig. 1. depicts a greatly simplified side view of a shower support according to the<br>
invention. In the case of example, shown, this Shower support is mounted on a wall 1. A<br>
mounting fixture 2, which, in the case of the example shown, is in the form of a console<br>
3, serves to attach it to the wall. The console 3 is bolted to the wall. Within the console 3,<br>
the shower support is connected to a water line, preferably one conveying mixed hot and<br>
cold water, coming from a mixer faucet. A wall-mounting arm 5 is pivoted on a<br>
protrusion 4 on the console 3. Its pivot axis is horizontal and normal to the plane of the<br>
paper, i.e., parallel to the surface of the wall. A setscrew that may be operated by a knob<br>
6 holds the wall-mounting arm 5 in place at a particular angular position. The wall-<br>
mounting arm extends outward from the wall, from the mounting fixture 2, to its far end<br>
7. A receptacle, which is not depicted in detail in Fig. 1, for a shower head 8 is attached<br>
to the wall-mounting arm 5 in the vicinity of the latter's far end 7. In the case of the<br>
embodiment shown, the shower head 8 is disk-shaped, although it might well have any<br>
other shape, and has a handgrip 9 that is slightly angularly offset from the plane of the<br>
shower head 8. A shower hose 10 that passes through the handgrip 9 and hangs<br>
downward therefrom, forming a loop, leads to the mounting fixture 2.<br>
A pair of additional shower fixtures 11 that spay downward are attached to that side of<br>
the wall-mounting arm 5 that may be seen in Fig. 1. They are supplied with water through<br>
the interior of the wall-mounting arm 5, which is configured from a length of hollow,<br>
profiled stock.<br><br>
Fig. 2 depicts a simplified view of the arrangement shown in Fig. 1. The wall-<br>
mounting arm 5 splits, commencing at a short distance beyond the location thereon<br>
where it is attached to the console 3, thereby forming a pair of tines 14 that are<br>
configured such that they diverge, but are parallel to one another in the vicinity of<br>
the far end 7 of the wall-mounting arm, where a receptacle 13 for the shower head<br>
8 is provided between the tips 12 of the tines 14.	<br>
This top view shows that the additional shower fixtures 11 are attached to the outer<br>
faces of the pair of tines 14, which allows the additional shower fixtures 11, which<br>
spray downward, to generate an array of jets having a larger cross-sectional area.<br>
Fig. 3 depicts another manner in which a shower support according to the invention<br>
might be configured. The embodiment shown in Figs. 1 and 2 has a forked, wall-<br>
mounting arm 5 that, when viewed from the side, is curved, but the embodiment<br>
shown in Fig. 3 has a solid wall-mounting arm 15. A conical receptacle 16 for a<br>
hand-held shower head is schematically depicted on the right end, i.e., far end, of<br>
the wall-mounting arm 15, in Fig. 3. The hand-held shower head may be inserted<br>
therein. In the case of the example shown, a pair of additional shower fixtures 11,<br>
one on either side of the wall-mounting arm 15, is arranged on the wall-mounting<br>
arm 15.<br><br>
