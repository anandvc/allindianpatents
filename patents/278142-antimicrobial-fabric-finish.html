				<td>ANTIMICROBIAL FABRIC FINISH<br>
BACKGROUND:<br>
[0001]     One useful method of finishing a fabric item is the exhaustion process. In this method, all or part of a fabric item is submerged in a liquid solution that contains one or more fabric finishing compounds. During the submersion, some or all of the fabric finishing compound migrates from the solution to the fabric. After the fabric is removed from the solution and men dried, some amount of the fabric finishing compound is attached to the fabric. It is sometimes desired to use the exhaustion method in preference to other methods of finishing fabrics. For example, if the fabric item is not flat, the exhaustion method may be preferred because other methods only work well for flat fabric items. For another example, it is sometimes possible to choose conditions for an exhaustion process in which all or nearly all of a fabric finishing compound transfers from the solution to the fabric while the fabric is submerged; such processes may be preferred for one or more of the following reasons: (A) because such processes make more efficient use of the fabric finishing compound than non-exhaustion methods and/or (B) because, in such processes, the <br>
amount of fabric finishing compound that attaches to the fabric is controlled by the <br>
transfer process while the fabric item is submerged in the solution, and so it is not necessary to measure or control the amount of liquid solution that remains with the <br>
fabric item after the fabric item is removed from submersion in the liquid solution. [0002]     A common alternative method for fabric finishing is padding, in which a fabric item is dipped in a fabric finish solution and removed from the fabric finish solution. Then some of the solution is removed from the wet fabric in a controlled way to leave a pre-determined amount of the solution on the fabric. The amount of liquid solution remaining on the fabric is controlled, for example, by the weight pick up property of the fabric and nip rollers. The fabric with remaining liquid solution is then dried, and the fabric finish compound that had been in the solution remains on <br>
the fabric item. Mediods like padding do not make significant use of transfer of fabric finish compound from the liquid solution to the fabric during submersion. The amount of fabric finish compound that is finally deposited on the fabric is controlled by the amount of liquid solution that is applied to the fabric.<br>
[0003]     US 7,335,613 describes a treated fabric in which the substrate has a finish that contains a metal/polymer complex. Such complexes are known to provide antimicrobial activity.<br>
[0004]     Prior to the present invention, it was considered that such a metal/polymer complex could only be used in solutions that had pH higher than 7.5. It was considered that the complex would precipitate and become useless at lower pH, and so the pH of the fabric finishing solution was normally raised to a level high enough so that the complex was very stable in water. That pH is usually approximately 9. Such stable solutions were considered to be useful in padding methods of fabric finishing. It was further considered mat, in such high-pH solutions, the complex was so stable in water mat, if an exhaustion process were attempted, little or no complex would transfer from the solution to the fabric item. Therefore it was considered that these complexes were not suitable for use in exhaustion processes, because at high pH the complex was too stable and at low pH the complex would precipitate and the solution would become useless.<br>
[0005]     It is desired to provide a composition that contains one or more metal/polymer complexes and that is suitable for fabric finishing using an exhaustion process.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:<br>
[0008]     As used herein, when a ratio of two numbers is said to be "X: 1 or higher," it is meant that the ratio has the value Y:l, where Y is equal to or greater than X. Similarly, when a ratio of two numbers is said to be "W: 1 or lower," it is meant that the ratio has the value Z:l, where Z is equal to or lower than W.<br>
[0009]     As used herein, a liquid is a composition that is in the liquid state at one atmosphere pressure over a range of temperatures that includes 15°C to 85°C. [0010]     A "polymer," as used herein and as defined by FW Billmeyer, JR. in Textbook of Polymer Science, second edition, 1971, is a relatively large molecule made up of the reaction products of smaller chemical repeat units. Polymers may have structures that are linear, branched, star shaped, looped, hyperbranched, crosslinked, or a combination thereof; polymers may have a single type of repeat unit ("homopolymers") or they may have more than one type of repeat unit ("copolymers"). Copolymers may have the various types of repeat units arranged randomly, in sequence, in blocks, in other arrangements, or in any mixture or combination thereof. [0011]     Polymer molecular weights can be measured by standard methods such as, for example, size exclusion chromatography (SEC, also called gel permeation chromatography or GPC). Generally, polymers have weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of 1,000 or more. Polymers may have extremely high Mw; some polymers have Mw above 1,000,000; typical polymers have Mw of 1,000,000 or less. Some polymers are crosslinked, and crosslinked polymers are considered to have infinite Mw. Some polymers are characterized by Mn, the number-average molecular weight.<br>
[0012]     As used herein "weight of polymer" means the dry weight of polymer. [0013]     Molecules that can react with each other to form the repeat units of a polymer are known herein as "monomers." Each monomer, after incorporation into a polymer by a polymerization reaction, becomes a "residue" of that monomer contained in that polymer.<br>

[0057]     The treated fabrics of the present invention may advantageously be used in a variety of materials to impart antimicrobial properties thereto, including, for example, apparel, apparel interlining, upholstery, carpeting, padding, ceiling tiles, acoustical tiles, backing, wall coverings, roofing products, house wraps, insulation, bedding, wiping cloths, towels, gloves, rugs, floor mats, drapery, napery, textile bags, awnings, vehicle covers, boat covers, tents, agricultural coverings, geotextiles, automotive headliners, filtration media, dust masks, fiber fill, envelopes, tags, labels, diapers, feminine hygiene products (e.g., sanitary napkins, tampons), laundry aids (e.g., fabric dryer-sheets), wound care products and medical care products (e.g., sterile wraps, caps, gowns, masks, drapings).<br>
It is to be understood that for purposes of the present examples that each operation disclosed herein is performed at 25 °C unless otherwise specified.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
In the examples below we used a solution (labeled silver-polymer solution) containing (based on the weight of the solution) 22% by weight of an acrylic polymer, 3% by weight silver, 3% by weight ammonium nitrate, ethanol (42% by weight), water (22% by weight) and ammonium hydroxide (6% by weight) and butanol (2% by weight). The polymer was, based on the weight of polymer, 45% by weight butyl acrylate, 45% by weight vinylimidazole, and 5% by weight acrylic acid.<br>
Examples 1-6<br>
To tap water was added the indicated amount of SilvaDur™ ET (see Table 1), thus forming the silver-polymer solution described above. To this solution was added glacial acetic acid to adjust the pH to the value shown in Table 1. In to this solution was introduced enough fabric to obtain a solution/fabric weight ratio of 20:1. The temperature of the treatment bath was increased to the temperature indicated in Table 1. To calculate the weight ratio of solution to fabric, the fabric weight is the weight of dry fabric prior to submersion in the solution. Fabric was kept submerged in the solution at the temperature shown for 20 minutes. The % shown below is the concentration of complex in the solution, by weight based on the weight of the solution. "T" is temperature. The "target" is the amount of silver (by weight based on the weight of the treated fabric) that is calculated to be present on the fabric, based on the assumption that all the silver in the solution is deposited onto the fabric. Fabric was either cotton or polyethyleneterphthalate (PET). The solution was cooled, the fabric was squeezed and dried. The amount of silver in the fabric was determined by XRF (X-ray fluorescence) spectroscopy. In some samples different sections of the treated fabric were analyzed to determine the homogeneity of the treatment.   The amount of silver in the recovered solution was determined by ICP-AES (Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectrometry).<br>
Table 1.<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
The data in Table 1 show that significant amounts of the silver is transferred to the fabric via the exhaustion process. This is corroborated by the fact that in Example 1 and Example 2, analysis of the solution, after the exhaustion process, showed very little silver.<br>
