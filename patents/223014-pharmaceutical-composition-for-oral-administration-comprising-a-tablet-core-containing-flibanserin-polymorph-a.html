				<td>The present invention relates to pharmaceutical composition for oral administration comprising a tablet core, containing flibanserin polymorph A.<br>
The invention relates to oral pharmaceutical compositions containing flibanserin, methods for the preparation thereof and use thereof as a medicament.<br>
Background of the invention The compound 1 -[2-(4-(3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)piperazin-1 -yl)ethyl]-2,3-dihydro-1 H-benzimidazol-2-one (flibanserin) is disclosed in form of its hydrochlorid in European Patent Application EP-A-526434 and has the following chemical structure:<br><br><br>
(Structure Removed)<br>
Flibanserin shows affinity for the 5-HT1A and 5-HT2-receptor. It is therefore a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of a variety of diseases, for instance depression, schizophrenia, Parkinson, anxiety, sleep disturbances, sexual and mental disorders and age associated memory impairment.<br>
A certain pharmaceutical activity is of course the basic prerequisite to be fulfilled by a pharmaceutically active agent before same is approved as a medicament on the market. However, there are a variety of additional requirements a pharmaceutically active agent has to comply with. These requirements are based on various parameters which are connected with the nature of the active substance itself. Without being restrictive, examples of these parameters are the stability of the active agent under various environmental conditions, its stability during production of the pharmaceutical formulation and the stability of the active agent in the final medicament compositions. The pharmaceutically active substance used for preparing the pharmaceutical compositions should be as pure as possible and its stability in long-term storage must be guaranteed under various environmental conditions. This is absolutely essential to prevent the use of pharmaceutical compositions which contain, in addition to the actual active substance, degradation products thereof, for example. In such cases the content of active substance in the medicament might be less than that specified.<br>
Uniform distribution of the active substance in the formulation is a critical factor, particularly when the medicament has to be given in low doses. To ensure uniform<br><br><br><br>
distribution, the particle size ot the active substance can be reduced to a suitable level, e.g. by grinding. Since degradation and/or amorphization of the pharmaceutically active substance as a side effect of the grinding (or micronising) has to be avoided as far as possible, in spite of the hard conditions required during the process, it is absolutely essential that the active substance should be highly stable throughout the grinding process. Only if the active substance is sufficiently stable during the grinding process is it possible to produce a homogeneous pharmaceutical formulation which always contains the specified amount of active substance in reproducible manner.<br>
Finally, the properties of the pharmaceutical composition as such decisively contribute to the bioavailability of the active agent and hence efficacy of the medicament in the intended medical use.<br>
The aim of the invention is thus to provide a new formulation for oral administration containing flibanserin which meets the stringent requirements imposed on pharmaceutical compositions as mentioned above.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
It has been found, surprisingly, that the free base of flibanserin in a specific polymophic form best fulfils the requirements to be met within the formulation according to the invention.

Synthesis of flibanserin polymorph A:<br>
375 kg of 1-[(3-trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-4-(2-cloroethyl)piperazin are charged in a reactor with 2500 kg of water and 200 kg of aqueous Sodium Hydroxide 45%. Under stirring 169.2 kg of 1-(2-propenyl)-1,3-dihydro-benzimidazol-2H-one, 780 kg of isopropanol, 2000 kg of water and 220 kg of aqueous Sodium Hydroxide 45% are added. The reaction mixture is heated to 75-85°C and 160 kg of concentrated hydrochloric acid and 200 kg of water are added. The reaction mixture is stirred at constant temperature for about 45 minutes. After distillation of a mixture of water and Isopropanol (about 3000 kg) the remaining residue is cooled to about 65-75°C and the pH is adjusted to 6.5 - 7.5 by addition of 125 kg of aqueous Sodium Hydroxide 45%. After cooling to a temperature of 45-50°C, the pH value is adjusted to 8-9 by addition of about 4 kg of aqueous Sodium Hydroxide 45%.Subsequently the mixture is cooled to 30-35°C and centrifuged. The residue thus obtained is washed with 340 I of water and 126 I of isopropanol and then with water until chlorides elimination. The wet product is dried under vacuum at a temperature of about 45-55°C which leads to 358 kg of crude flibanserin polymorph A. The crude product thus obtained is loaded in a reactor with 1750 kg of Acetone and the resulting mixture is heated under stirring until reflux. The obtained solution is filtered and the filtrate is concentrated by<br><br>
distillation, The temperature is maintained for about 1 hour 0-5°C, then the precipitate solid is isolated by filtration and dried at 55°C for at least 12 hours. The final yield is 280 kg of pure flibanserin polymorph A.<br>

Then Hypromellose (Methocel E5 Prem) and/or additional wet binding components are stirred in, and the dispersion is cooled down to room temperature. If necessary, the liquid is allowed to stand overnight (completeness of solution / reduction of frothing) and stirred up before use. If necessary, any weight loss is compensated with purified water. The dry matter (soldis content) of this granulation liquid is preferrably in the range of 4-6 %.<br>
For the granulation process Lactose monohydrate, fine milled and sieved, the required quantity of Flibanserin polymorph A (depending on the dose strength), rnicronized quality, and Cellulose, microcrystalline (Avicel PH 101) are filled in in this order, mixed homogeneously for about 4 minutes using impeller and chopper blades. Next the granulation liquid is added either manually or by spray nozzles and the wet mass is granulated for about 2-3 minutes, again using impeller and chopper blades. After discharging of the high shear mixer/granulator the wet granules are wet-<br><br>
screened through a 3.0 mm mesh size sieve to destroy large agglomerates. The wet-screened material is transferred to a conventional fluid bed drier (or alternatively to a tray drier) and dried at an inlet air temperature of approximately 100 °C until an exhaust air temperature (or alternatively product temperature) of approximately 50°C (45-55°C) is reached. The residual moisture of the granulate in terms of loss on drying should be in the range of 0.5-1.5 %. The dried granules are then dry screened with the help of a Comil screen machine using a 2 mm rasp screen. Finally, the screened granulate is filled into a suitable free-fall blender, e.g. a container mixer, the crosslinked Carboxymethylcellulose sodium (Croscarmellose sodium, brand name: Ac-Di-Sol) and Magnesium stearate are added, and the components are mixed for 10-20 minutes, preferrably 15 minutes, at a mixing speed of 10 rpm until homogeneous.<br>
The final tableting mixture is compressed on a suitable tablets press (e.g. rotary press) to the respective target weight of the required dose strength of Flibanserin tablets using the appropriate tools (e.g. in case of 50 mg tablets: 9 mm round, biconvex, with bevelled edges; or in case of 100 mg tablets: 14x6.8 mm oblong shaped). Predetermined hardness specifications for the different tool dimensions have to be followed in order to achieve the intended drug dissolution profile and product characteristics.<br>
Since the drug substance Flibanserin is of bitter taste and slightly light sensitive, a protecting film coat has to be applied to the tablet cores in order to achieve a stable and consumer friendly product. To this end a coating suspension is prepared by filling purified water into a suitable mixing vessel, and dissolving polyethyleneglycol 6000 and then hydroxypropylmethylcellulose with the help of a high intensity stirrer. In a next step an aqueous slurry of titanium dioxide, talc and iron oxide red (in case of coloured film tablets) is poured and stirred into the film-forming polymer solution. The dry matter of this coating suspension is in the range of 10-15 %, preferrably about 12-13%.<br>
The above prepared tablet cores are filled into a suitable.film coater (e.g. an Accela Cota with a 36" pan, or a Glatt GC 1250 Coater with perforated pan, and top spray system), and preheated up to a temperature of approximately 50 °C. After this product temperature is reached the coating suspension is sprayed onto the cores with the help of one or more spray nozzles at a spray pressure of about 2 bar, a spray rate of about 4 kg/h (in case of Accela Cota), an inlet air temperature of about 60-85°C. It is important to control and maintain the product temperature during spraying at a level of between 48-52° C to achieve a high quality film-coat. After the spraying is finished the film-coated tablets are cooled down to approx. 30°C before the equipment is discharged. The total process time for the film-coating is in the range of 2-3 hours.<br><br>
After all in-process and quality controls have been performed the bulk film-coated tablets are now ready for primary packaging into the respective marketing presentations (e.g. PVC/PVDC blister packs or HOPE bottles).<br>
The following film-coated tablets were obtained in analogy to the method of preparation described hereinbefore.<br>
