ABSTRACT<br>
A Method and system for film digitizing and transmitting images to a remote destination by placing the film in the view box with uniform lighting having a front panel for holding and projecting the film, capturing digital images of the films by providing at least one digital cameras, connecting the digital camera to at least one computer CPU by USB cable, digitizing the captured images using one or more computer software segments, processing the digitized images to enhance the quality of the images, transmitting the images to desired remote location through internet, telephone line or wireless, printing the images on paper using at least one printer.<br><br>
METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR FILM DIGITIZING AND TRANSMITTING IMAGES<br>
TO A REMOTE DESTINATION<br>
INTRODUCTION<br>
The present invention relates to digitizing and transmitting images to a remote destination.<br>
More particularly, the present invention relates to film digitizing images using a view box equipped with digital camera.<br>
Still particularly, the present invention seeks to transmit images which are digitized using view box equipped with digital camera to a remote destination with the help of computer network.<br>
Even more particularly, the invention provides methods and systems for film digitizing and transmitting images to a remote destination by using either the local area networks with or without wireless extensions. The present digitizing and transmition can be applied to many computer networking environments, e.g. environments based upon the IEEE 802.11 family of standards (WiFi), Ultra Wide Band (UWB), IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX), Bluetooth, and others.<br>
Computer systems have proliferated from academic and specialized science applications to day-to-day business, commerce, information distribution and home applications. Such systems can include personal computers (PCs) to large mainframe and server class computers.    Powerful mainframe and server class computers run specialized<br>
2<br><br>
applications for banks, small and large companies, e-commerce vendors, and governments. Personal computers can be found in many offices, homes, and even local coffee shops. Thus using computers to aid digitization, storage, transmission and ultimately reaching the expert viewing the digitized film is the object of this invention.<br>
The computer systems located within a specific local geographic area (e.g. an office, building floor, building, home, or any other defined geographic region (indoor and/or outdoor)) are typically interconnected using a Local Area Network (LAN)(e.g. the Ethernet). The LANs, in turn, can be interconnected with each other using a Wide Area Network (WAN)(e.g. the Internet). A conventional LAN can be deployed using an Ethernet-based infrastructure comprising cables, hubs switches, and other elements to achieve the object of tramsmitting the digitized images to desired remote locations.<br>
Connection ports (e.g. Ethernet ports) can be used to couple multiple computer systems to transmit the image over the LAN. For example, a user can connect to the LAN by physically attaching a computing device (e.g. a laptop, desktop, or handheld computer) to one of the connection ports using physical wires or cables. Other types of computer systems, such as database computers, server computers, routers, and Internet gateways, can be connected to the LAN in a similar manner to achieve the transmission of the digitized images.<br>
Advantageously, digitizing the image can facilitate a quick and effective way of providing the image to a reomote location using wireless or other extension internet. To provide this transmission, one or more computers are connected with the image digitizer camera which) can take digital pictures of the images which need to be digitized and then such digital images are transmitted over the internet to desired remote location or locations<br>
3<br><br>
and could be stored or downloaded using intermediate equipment either on such remote locations or on a central servers or routers.<br>
In the past, digital images were transmitted over the computer network focused only on images, which were personal and represented either personal or professional images. However, the application of Internet communication to transmitting images, which are normally not transmittable over the computer network, can introduce additional advantage of both, the digital image capturing equipment and also the transmitting system.<br>
From the above, techniques for improving methods of transmitting films with secure features is highly desired. To prevent delays in transmitting films from one location to the other, in order to prevent unauthorized access to such images, the method and system invented could provide much needed progression of safety measures and techniques in which the films is digitized using the available equipments and images and transmitted over the internet to desired remote location. The method and system espoused herein can provide additional security measures such as encryption, pin or password and/or firewalls in order to restrict viewing of such images transmitted over the remote location or stored in retrievable format on any electronic medium.<br>

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the present invention, techniques related to film digitizing and transmission to a remote desired location is provided. More particularly, the invention provides methods and systems to transmit images of films, which are digitized using view<br><br>
box equipped with digital camera to a desired remote location with the help of computer network.<br>
The present film digitizing and transmission can be applied to many computer networking environments, e.g. environments based upon the IEEE 802.11 family of standards (WiFi), Ultra Wide Band (UWB), IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX), Bluetooth, and others.<br>
The physical transfer and review of the films pose serious problems owing to the limitation of factors such as geographical location in which film is present, geographical location where it is to be viewed (and both such geographical locations could be separated by thousands of kilometer), the inability of experts to opine on such films and their desire to seek further opinion (or second opinion) on the same, the requirement of such film to be reviewed in locations outside the political borders etc.<br>
For example, a film which is physically present in say the state of Maharashtra but needs to be viewed in state of Bengal, would take considerable time to be physically available in Bengal. Moreover, such movement is possible, at present, only by way of using services of department of post or courier, and both pose a threat to the film. In postal or courier movement of the film, it is subjected to wear and tear, the harsh environment inherent to such movement, rain, water, sun, moisture, spillage, tampering, cracks, tearing and many of such non exhaustive hardships would cause the film to be unfit for either viewing or for rendering opinion. Unfortunately, the film may also not reach in time in time and case sensitive situations or the film may be viewed by unauthorized entities. Additionally, there is undeniable risk of the film been lost in transit.   Please note that the above risk factors only<br>
10<br><br>
magnify manifold when such film is to be transmitted to a foreign location. To send the film to such foreign location could also cost considerable amount and thus render the whole exercise expensive and futile (if at all the film reached the destination and suffers damages/wear and tear).<br>
Therefore, as people become more mobile in search of job and better living standards, the transmission of films become more ubiquitous, complicated and expensive. The people are increasingly concerned about expense, damage to the film, unauthorized access to the film etc.<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the invention, methods and system for film digitizing and transmission to a desired remote location are provided. These methods and systems can digitize films which need to be transmitted and then transmit such digitized images to desired remote location which could have further security systems of entering a pin or password before the viewer can view the images thereby providng security to the individual whose film has been digitized and transmitted.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention will now be explained with reference to figures 1 &amp; 2 of the accompanying drawings.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates Vertical Cross Section of the Film Digitizing and Transmission System and figure 2 illustrates the Architecture of the Entire System.  Figure 1 &amp; 2 show the<br>
11<br><br>
various components of the method and system for film digitizing and transmitting images to a remote destination with their internal co-relation with other parts and their respective functions.<br>
The Vertical Cross Section of the Film Digitizing and Transmission System shown in the<br>
Figure 1 consists of:<br>
Camera holder<br>
Camera<br>
Tray<br>
Polycarbonate Acrylic Sheet<br>
Light Source<br>
Steel Paper Reflector<br>
The Camera holder (Fig.l, Numeral 1), holds a digital Camera (Fig.l, Numeral 2) at the top end of the Film digitizing and transmission system. Digital Camera means any device capable of capturing digital images. The camera is fixed at an optimal distance from the Tray, which enables digitizing of films of all sizes without moving the camera. The camera is modified so that the capturing switch (Fig.2, Numeral 8) is connected through a push button kept outside on the system. Pressing this button digitizes the film.<br>
This Camera is focused in a manner so as to be able to take the digital picture of the film placed on the Tray (Fig.l, Numeral 3). This Tray means is a retractable box set on hinges, which can be pulled out or pushed in. The lower portion of the Tray is made of Polycarbonate Acrylic Sheet of white color (Fig.l, Numeral 4).  It has a handle to pull or push. The films of<br>
12<br><br>
all sizes can be kept on this Tray for digitizing. This Tray has metal clipping means so as to stabilize the film placed on the Tray and prevent the film from moving.<br>
A Light Source (Fig.l, Numeral 5) is provided by means of Circular CFLs. Four such CFLs are placed in such a way that uniform lighting is provided which results in diagnostic quality images.<br>
Steel Paper Reflector (Fig.l, Numeral 6), a reflector paper with steel finish, which is attached all around the lower portion around the light source. This provides uniform lighting and enhances quality of captured images.<br>
The Architecture of the entire system, as shown in the figure 2 consist of:<br>
Internet / Telephone line / Wireless<br>
Camera<br>
Tray<br>
USB Cable<br>
Light source<br>
Computer Monitor<br>
Computer CPU<br>
Capture Switch for the camera<br>
Printer<br>
The Camera is connected through a USB cable (Fig.2, Numeral 4) to a Computer CPU (Fig.2, Numeral 7). The Computer CPU can be kept inside the System or can be outside the system. The computer CPU is connected to a keyboard, Mouse, Storage media and a<br>
13<br><br>
Display unit.   Inside the CPU an Internal Modem is connected which is used to transmit images to a remote destination through telephone line or internet or wireless connection.<br>
User first enters the patient details like patient ID, name, address, study name into the software which allows archiving, processing and transmission to a remote destination. The digitized film is transferred through the USB cable to the CPU storage media. The software tool residing on the CPU automatically trims the film to remove the unwanted portion of the film and adds it to the relevant patient's file. Thereafter, a User can pull up the image and process it further for diagnosis, the images can be transferred to a remote destination at a click of button, the images can be printed on to a paper printer attached to the CPU and finally, the images could be archived.<br>
A Patient is registered on the computer program by entering the details like patient name, date, body part etc. The Tray in pulled out of the unit and film is placed in between the clips and Tray is pushed back inside the unit. The Capture Button (Fig.2, Numeral 8) on the unit is pushed to digitize the film placed inside. The digitized image is automatically sent to the computer, which receives it through the USB cable and stores it under the correct patient name after cropping the irrelevant area automatically. This image can be further processed to enhance it by zooming on an area, increasing or decreasing the brightness and contrast of image. In addition, the user can transmit the image to remote destination through internet, telephone line or wireless by the click of a button. The user can also take a print of the digitized image on plain paper using a Printer (Fig.2, Numeral 9).<br>
