INDOLES HAVING ANTI-DIABETIC ACTIVITY<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The instant inven:;on is concerned with indoles having an ary'loxyalkanoic acid substituent. and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and prodrugs thereof, which are useful as therapeutic compounds, paiticularly in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes mellitus. and of conditions that are often associated with this disease, including obesity and lipid disorders.<br>
BACKGROUUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Diabetes is a disease derived from multiple causative factors and characterized by elevated levels of plasma glucose (hyperglycemia) in the fasting state or after administration of alucose durins an oral glucose tolerance test. There are two generally recognized forms of diabetes. In type 1 diabetes, or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), patients produce little or no insulin, the hormone which regulates glucose utilization. In type 2 diabetes, or noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), insulin is still produced in the body. Patients having type 2 diabetes often have hyperinsulinemia (elevated plasma insulin levels); however, these patients are insulin resistant, which means that they have a resistance to the effect of insuhn in stimulating zlucose and lipid metabolism in the main insulin-sensitive tissues, which are muscle, Uver and adipose tissues. Padents who are insulin resistant but not diabetic compensate for the insulin resistance by secreting more insulin, so that serum glucose levels are not elevated enough to meet the criteria of Type 2 diabetes. In patients with Type 2 diabetes, even elevated plasma insulin levels are insufficient to overcome the pronounced insulin resistance.<br>
Persistent or uncontrolled hyperglycemia thai occurs with diabetes is associated with increased and premature morbidity and mortality. Often abnormal glucose homeostasis is associated both directly and indirectly with obesity, hypertension, and alterations of rhe lipid, lipoprotein and apolipoprotein metabolism, as well as other metabolic and hemodynamic disease. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus have a significantly increased risk of macrovascuiar and microvascular complications, including atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy. Therefore, therapeutic control of glucose homeostasis, lipid metabolsm, obesity, and<br><br>
hypertension are critically important in the clinical management and treatment of diabetes mellitus.<br>
Many patients who have insulin resistance or Type 2 diabetes often have several symptoms that together are referred to as syndrome X, or the metabolic syndrome. A patient having this syndrome is characterized as having three or more symptoms selected from the following group of five 'symptoms: (1) abdominal obesity; (2) hypertriglyceridemia; (3) low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL); (4) high blood pressure; and (5) elevated fasting glucose, which may be in the range characteristic of Type 2 diabetes if the patient is also diabetic. Each of these symptoms is defined in the recently released Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment Panel IH, or ATP HI), National Institutes of Health, 2001, NTH Publication No. 01-3670. Patients with metabolic syndrome, whether or not they have or develop overt diabetes mellitus, have an increased risk of developing the macrovascular and microvascular complications that are listed above that occur with t&gt;pe 2 diabetes, such as atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease.<br>
Insulin resistance is not primarily caused by a diminished number of insulin receptors but by a post-insulin receptor binding defect that is not yet completely understood. This lack of responsiveness to insulin results in insufficient insulin-mediated activation of uptake, oxidation and storage of glucose in muscle and inadequate insulin-mediated repression of lipolysis in adipose tissue and of glucose production and secretion in the liver.<br>
There are several available treatments for type 2 diabetes, each of which has its own limitations and potential risks. Physical exercise and a reduction in dietary intake of calories often dramatically improve the diabetic condition and are the best first line treatment of type 2 diabetes. Compliance with this treatment is very poor because of well-entrenched sedentary lifestyles and excess food consumption, especially of foods containing high amounts of fat. A widely used drug treatment involves the administration of meglitinide or a sulfonylurea (e.g. tolbutamide or glipizide), which are insulin secretagogues. These drugs increase the plasma level of insulin by stimulating the pancreatic p-cells to secrete more insulin. When administration of a sulfonylurea or meglitinide becomes ineffective, the amount of insulin in the body can be supplemented by the injection of insulin so that insulin concentrations are high enough to stimulate even the very insulin-resistant tissues.<br><br>
However, dangerously low levels of plasma glucose can result from administration of insulin and/or insulin secretagogues, and an increased level of insulin resistance due to the even higher plasma insulin levels can occur.<br>
The biguanides are another class of drugs that are widely used to treat type 2 diabetes. The two best known biguanides, phenformin and metfonnin, cause some correction of hyperglycemia without risk of causing hypoglycemia. The biguanides can be used either win insulin or with an insulin secretagogue without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia. However, phenformin and metformin can induce lactic acidosis and nausea/diarrhea. Metformin has a lower risk of side effects than phenformin and is widely prescribed for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes.<br>
The glitazones (i.e. 5-benzylthia2olidine-2,4-diones) are a newer class of compounds that can ameliorate hyperglycemia and other symptoms of type 2 diabetes. These agents substantially increase insulin sensitivity in muscle, liver and adipose tissue in several animal models of type 2 diabetes, resulting in partial or complete conrection of elevated plasma glucose levels without the occurrence of hj'poglycemia. The glitazones that are currently marketed (rosiglitazone and pioglitazone) are agonists of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) gamma subtype. PPAR-gamma agonism is generally believed to be responsible for the improved insulin sensidtization that is observed with the glitazones. New PPAR agonists are being developed for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes and/or dyslipidemia. Many of the newer PP.-VR compounds are agonists of one or more of the PPAR alpha, gamma and delta subtypes. Compounds that are agonists of both the PPAR alpha and PPAR gamma subtypes (PPAR alpha/gamma dual agonists) are promising because they reduce hyperglycemia and also improve lipid metabolism.<br>
PPAR agonists, and particularly glitazones, have had shortcomings which have so far detracted from their attractiveness. Some of the compounds, and especially troglitazone, have exhibited liver toxicity. Troglitazone was eventually withdrawn from the marketplace because of hepatotoxicity. Another weakness in the currently marketed PPAR agonists is that monotherapy for type 2 diabetes produces only modest efficacy - a reduction in average plasma glucose of = 20% and a decline from ~ 9.0% to ==8.0% in HemoglobinAlC. The current compounds also do not greatly improve lipid metabolism, and may actually have a negative effect on the lipid profile. These shortcomings have provided an incentive to develop better insulin sensitizers for Type 2 diabetes v.hich function via similar mechanism(s) of action.<br><br>
Recently, there have been reports of compounds that are PPAR gamma antagonists or partial agonists. WOO 1/30343 describes a specific compound that is a PPAR partial agonist/antagonist that is useful for the treatment of obesity and Type 2 diabetes. WO02/08188 discloses a class of PPAR agonists and partial agonists that are indole derivatives and that are useful in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes, with reduced side effects relating to body and heart weight gain<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The class of compounds described herein is a new class of PPAR agonists that do not contain a 1,3-thiazolidinedione moiety. The class of compounds includes many compounds that are PPARy partial agonists, but also may include PPARy full agonists and/or PPARy antagonists. Some compounds may also have PPARa activity in addition to PPARy activity.  Some compounds may be mixed full or partial PPARoc/y agonists.  These compounds are useful in the treatment and control of diabetes, hyperglycemia, and insulin resistance.<br>
The compounds may also be useful in the treatment of one or more lipid disorders, including mixed or diabetic dyslipidemia, isolated hypercholesterolemia, which may be manifested by elevations in LDL-C and/or non-HDL-C, hyperapoBliproteinemia, hypertriglyceriderada, an increase in triglyceride-rich-lipoproteins, and low HDL cholesterol concentrations. They may also be useful in the treatment or amelioration of atherosclerosis, obesity, vascular restenosis, inflammatory conditions, psoriasis, polycystic ovary syndrome, and other PPAR mediated diseases, disorders and conditions.<br>

Utilities<br>
Compounds of the present invention are potent ligands having agonist, partial agonist or antagonist activity on one or more of the various peroxisome proliferator activated receptor subtypes, particularly PPARY- The compounds may also be ligands or agonists, partial agonists or antagonists of the PPARa subtype as well as the PPARy subtype, resulting in mixed PPARO/Y agonism or in agonism of mainly the PPARa subtype.   Some compounds (generally less preferred) may also be PPAR6 ligands and have PPAR5 activity in addition to their other PPAR activity. The compounds of this invention are useful in treating or controlling diseases, disorders or conditions which are mediated by one or more ligands of the individual PPAR subtypes (eg. y or a) or a combination of PPAR subtypes (e.g. oJy).   One aspect of the present invention provides a method for the treatment and control of diseases that<br><br>
can be mediated by administration of a PPAR agonist or partial agoinist, such as type 2 diabetes.<br>
Administration and Dose Ranges<br>
Any suitable route of administration may be employed for providing a mammal, especially a human, with an effective dose of a compound of the present invention. For example, oral, rectal, topical, parenteral, ocular, pulmonary, nasal, and the like may be employed. Dosage forms include tablets, troches, dispersions, suspensions, solutions, capsules, creams, ointments, aerosols, and the like. Preferably compounds of Formula I are administered orally.<br>
The effective dosage of active ingredient employed may vary depending on the particular compound employed, the mode of administration, the condition being treated and the severity of the condition being treated. Such dosage may be ascertained readily by a person skilled in the art.<br>
When treating or controlling diabetes mellitus and/or hyperglycemia or hypertriglyceridemia or other diseases for which compounds of Formula I are indicated, generally satisfactory results are obtained when the compounds of the present invention are administered at a daily dosage of from about 0.1 milligram to about 100 milligram per kilogram of animal body weight, preferably given as a single daily dose or in divided doses two to six times a day, or in sustained release form. For most large mammals, the total daily dosage is from about 1.0 milligrams to about 1000 milligrams, preferably from about 1 milligrams to about 50 milligrams. In the case of a 70 kg adult human, the total daily dose will generally be from about 1 milligram to about 350 milligrams. For a particularly potent compound, the dosage for an adult human may be as low as 0.1 mg.  The dosage regimen may be adjusted within this range or even outside of this range to provide the optimal therapeutic response.<br>
Oral administration will usually be carried out using tablets. Examples of doses in tablets are 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, and 250 mg. Similar dosages may also be used in other oral formulations (e.g.capsules).<br>
Pharmaceutical Composidons<br>
Another aspect of the present invention provides pharmaceutical compositions which comprise a compound of Formula I and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention<br><br>
comprise a compound of Formcla I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt as an active ingredient, as well as a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and optionally other therapeutic ingredients. The tenn "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" refers to salts prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic bases or acids including inorganic bases or acids and organic bases or acids.<br>
The compositions include compositions suitable for oral, rectal, topical, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, and intravenous), ocular (ophthalmic), pulmonary (nasal or buccal inhalation), or nasal administration, although the most suitable route in any given case will depend on the nature and severity of the conditions being treated and on the nature of the active ingredient. They may be conveniently presented in unit dosage form and prepared by any of the methods well-known in the art of pharmacy.<br>
In practical use, the compounds of Formula I can be combined as the active ingredient in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration, e.g., oral or parenteral (including intravenous). In preparing the compositions for oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations, such as, for example, suspensions, elixirs and solutions; or carriers such as starches, sugars, raicrocrystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of oral solid preparations such as, for example, powders, hard and soft capsules and tablets, with the solid oral preparations being preferred over the liquid preparations.<br>
Because of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. If desired, tablets may be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques. Such compositions and preparations should contain at least 0.1 percent of active compound. The percentage of active compound in these compositions may, of course, be varied and may conveniently be between about 2 percent to about 60 percent of the weight of the unit. The amount of active compound in such therapeutically useful compositions is such that an effective dosage will be obtained. The active compounds can also be administered intranasally as, for example, liquid drops or spray.<br><br>
The tablets, pills, capsules, and the like may also contain a binder such as gum tragacanth, acacia, com starch or gelatin; excipients such as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent such as com starch, potato starch, alginic acid; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; and a sweetening agent such as sucrose, lactose or saccharin. When a dosage unit form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier such as a fatty oil.<br>
Various other materials may be present as coatings or to modify the physical form of the dosage unit. For instance, tablets may be coated with shellac, sugar or both. A syrup or elixir may contain, in addition to the active ingredient, sucrose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and a flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor.<br>
Compounds of formula I may also be administered parenterally. Solutions or suspensions of these active compounds can be prepared in water suitably mixed with a surfactant such as hydroxypropylcellulose. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols and naixtures thereof in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms.<br>
The pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases, the form must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (e.g. glycerol, propylene glycol and liquid polyethylene glycol), suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils.<br>
Combination Therapy<br>
Compounds of Formula I may be used in combination with other drugs that may also be useful in the treatment or amelioration of the diseases or conditions for which compounds of Formula I are useful. Such other drugs may be administered, by a route and in an amount commonly used therefor, contemporaneously or sequentially with a compound of Formula I.  When a compound of Formula I is used contemporaneously with one or more other drugs, a pharmaceutical composition in unit dosage form containing such other drugs and the compound of Formula I is<br><br>
preferred. However, the combination therapy also includes therapies in which the compound of Formula I and one or more other drugs are administered on different overlapping schedules. It is also contemplated that when used in combination with one or more other active ingredients, the compound of the present invention and the other active ingredients may be used in lower doses than when each is used singly. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention include those that contain one or more other active ingredients, in addition to a compound of Formula I.<br>
Other active ingredients that may be administered with the compounds of this invention include other antidiabetic agents, such as a sulfonylurea, metformin, insulin or a DP-IV inhibitor, or a lipid lowering drug, such as a statin (eg simvastatin). Statins that may be coadministered with the compounds of this invention include simvastatin, lovastatin, rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, fluvastatin, itavastatin, rivastatin, and ZD-4522.<br>

Since the compounds were solubilized in DMSO, control cells were incubated with equivalent concentrations of DMSO; final DMSO concentrations were 
Agonism is determined by comparison of maximal transactivation activity with a full PPAR agonist, such as rosiglitazone. Generally, if the maximal stimulation of transactivation is less than 50% of the effect observed with a full agonist, then the compound is designated as a partial agonist. If the maximal stimulation of transactivation is greater than 50% of the effect observed with a full agonist, then the compound is designated as a full agonist. The compounds of this invention generally have EC50 values in the range of 1 nM to 3000 nM.<br><br>

solvent system consisting of 5% isopropanol in heptane at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Peaks were recorded at the wavelength of 254 um with an UV detector. Under these conditions, the retention time of the S enantiomer is approximately 10 minutes while the retention time of the R enantiomer is about 20 minutes. Enantiomeric excess (ee%) are calculated as area under curve of the S enantiomer subtract area under curve of the R enantiomer and divided by the sum of the two areas. For preparative purpose, the Chiracel OD Semi-Prep column (20 x 250 mm, 10 micron) was used. A 1.8 ml sample solution of approximately 40 mg/ml in concentration was injected.

Fractions containing the S enantiomer were collected between 20-25 minutes after injection, while those containing the R enantiomer were collected at about 40-45minutes. Repeated injections resulted in continuous separation of the two enantioraers. Fractions containing the separated enantiomers were then combined, and concentrated to obtain the optically active product as a clear oil.
