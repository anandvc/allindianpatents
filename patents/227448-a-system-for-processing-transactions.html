FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
This invention relates to a self-service transaction process for use in retail banking, ticketing and the like and a touchscreen monitor combined with a computer system, executable software to control a defined sequence of operations and a variety of devices that allow a user to conduct a variety of banking transactions in an efficient manner.<br>
BACKGROUND:<br>
Touchscreens, by their inherent intuitive characteristics, are finding increasing use in self-service kiosk applications. Particularly for transaction kiosks, it becomes very efficient to provide a specific choice of descriptive icons to aid a user to touch upon which the display changes in a predetermined sequence. This sequence is designed to result in a particular transaction being completed. In kiosk environments a keyboard is not accessible hence the user can only touch icons on the screen, thus the chances of accidentally or intentionally tampering or accessing information other than what is required is eliminated. The user cannot switch off the computer or alter any of the settings.<br>
In a transaction kiosk applications the software will be capable of allowing the user to enter information using an on-screen virtual keyboard that has only those keys that are required to input information. To correct wrong inputs a backspace button can be provided. Apart fi-om these the software can allow the user to scroll up or down a table and select one of the options. Touching the OK icon will imply the information input is OK and the GUI (Graphic User Interface) reads the information &amp; performs checks with the database as per the requirement of that transaction step and displays the next screen as per the sequence. If the check results are not OK, relevant screens can be displayed as per predetermined criteria say, to allow the user to try again a number of times. This allows authorizing the user to perform transactions after the Identity is verified.<br>
Information can be captured by, or output to a variety of devices connected to the kiosk like MICR reader, magnetic card, smart card, web camera, receipt printer, barcode printer, biometric sensor etc.<br><br>
Transaction kiosks are useful to perform repetitive, high frequency tasks which otherwise would be performed by persons leading to longer waiting times, varying efficiencies 8L possibilities of errors.<br>
CURRENT SCENARIO:<br>
1.    Retail Transactions in Banks:<br>
Banks across India have been following a procedure for over 40 years at the Customer front end, for simple transactions like cash withdrawal, cash deposits. Instrument Purchase, check balance, print statement etc.<br>
Millions of customers, on a regular basis have to undergo cumbersome procedures to effect simple transactions as explained below.<br>
The Method:<br>
•	To withdraw cash a customer fills up a cheque or a voucher which the clerk manually<br>
examines, issues a metal token, enters &amp; updates the transaction using a computer terminal, which is again verified and approved by an accountant on another computer terminal and then passed over to the cashier, who calls out the token number and the customer hands over the token &amp; collects cash.<br>
•	To deposit Cash or an Instrument, a pay-in slip is filled in duplicate-triplicate in some cases (account number, date, amount in figures &amp; words and signature), cash is given to cashier who counts &amp; stamps counterfoil, and Instrument is given to clerk who verifies &amp; stamps counterfoil.<br>
•	To purchase instrument, voucher is filled in duplicate (date, beneficiary, amount, commission, total, location), handed to clerk with a cheque payable to bank (or cash to cashier), clerk passes to accountant who prepares Instrument and hands to customer<br>
•	To update pass-book clerk receives it accesses account and updates using printer.<br>
•	To issue new cheque-book, clerk receives requisition, enters account number on each cheque leaf, records numbers against account numbers and hands over cheque book generally never on the same day.<br><br>
Shortcomings &amp; Problems:<br>
It is very obvious to observe that these procedures create bottle-necks in the work process. The same clerk handles varied jobs which leads to increased waiting times when customer traffic is high. A customer wishing to conduct a simple transaction needing a few minutes has to needlessly wait for other customers' transactions in process to be complete; after filling up mundane details like date, account number, name in duplicate.<br>
To elaborate- issuing withdrawal slips, checking for withdrawal, updating pass book, issuing cheque book, opening new accounts is performed by the clerk. A sub-staff moves vouchers &amp; tokens to &amp; fi"o between the clerk, accountant and cashier. The accountant verifies every withdrawal, issues Instruments, allows OD, verifies new accounts, accepts Investments, authorizes loans etc. The clerk issues &amp; accepts cash. Each of these staff possesses varying degrees of efficiency, patience and capacity for repetitive tasks.<br>
The existing method in spite of computerization results in crowding at service counters, long queues harassed staff &amp; customers. Besides, under the above circumstances, cash &amp; non-cash transactions being serviced in the same area poses a risk to customers as any person (with possible devious intentions) can walk into a bank branch and pose innocent queries about certain banking services. Aged persons, disabled persons find it very tedious to perform simple transactions.<br>
The following URLs are included herein by way of reference wherein the current banking scenario is discussed in detail:<br>
http://www.banknetindia.com/<br>

http://www.banknetindia.com/banking/art.htm<br>
http://www.banknetindia.com/anking/bsoftware.htm<br>
http://www.banknetindia.com/banking/bitpresentlevel.htm<br><br>
The convenience that the current banking system provides for personal as well as business purposes is limited by the fact that these transactions need to be conducted from the branch where the account exists.<br>
•	Cash withdrawal is not possible in any branch (other than branch where account exists) of the same bank (without magnetic swipe card or smart card).<br>
•	Cash Deposit is not possible at any branch of the same bank (other than branch where account exists).<br>
•	Instrument Purchase is not possible at any branch of the same bank (other than branch where account exists).<br>
•	Standing Instructions cannot be issued from any branch of same bank (other than branch where account exists).<br>
•	Account Balance cannot be checked from any branch of the same bank (other than branch where account exists).<br>
In trying to leverage a wide presence across the coimtry, banks in India are exploring initiatives to deploy the latest in Banking Automation Software like:<br>
i) Stand-alone branch-level packages-<br>
These are usually written in FoxPro, C or Dbase and handle specific functions at branches;<br>
these are sometimes networked on a LAN to simulate a TBA environment. But there are also<br>
high-end packages with a central Server (which can    be a Pentium PC or NT or a MINI or<br>
even a Main Frame, supported by multiple (dumb or intelligent) terminals. Some of them use<br>
sophisticated RDBMS like ORACLE as back-end and provide user-friendly front-end with<br>
Windows GUI.<br>
ii) Multi-branch solutions -<br>
These are used to network a cluster of branches in a city (or spread over several cities); the<br>
account maintenance can be central (where facilities like Anywhere Banking are required) or<br>
can be distributed, networking being achieved through Wide Area Network (WAN) on<br>
terrestrial lines / high speed lines/ satellite networks - and now even wireless.<br>
iii) Foreign Packages -<br><br>
Examples are Bank Master, Kappiti, Sanchez etc. These need to be extensively customized to<br>
suit Indian requirements - but their strength he in their proven capabilities in developing and<br>
offering modem / global banking products / services that India is just ushering in.<br>
iv) Packages for specialized niche areas -<br>
Like Asset Liability Management (ALM), Treasury Management, Trading / Dealing Room<br>
activities. Custodial Services/ Depository Participant etc. These are high-end packages with<br>
sophisticated analytical and decision tools.<br>
v) Service Branch / high-volume transaction processing packages -<br>
These  include,  clearing,  drafts  issue/ payments  / reconciliation  (Remittances),  Bills<br>
(payments/ collection/ purchases). Dividend Warrant Processing, inter-branch reconciliation<br>
etc. These are often developed and implemented by service providers   to whom the work is<br>
outsourced.<br>
vi) IT Services -<br>
These are not Packages in the sense, these are developed to handle specific problems like<br>
disaster recovery, virus protection, security handling, linking / networking multiple legacy<br>
systems between themselves or to new platforms or to new delivery chaimels like ATMs, etc.<br>
New initiatives like Net-Banking, Tele-Banking, Mobile-Banking, are being deployed, but these can cater to only a fraction of the population with the situation in about 40,000 odd branches remaining unchanged.<br>
The Banking automation software available in the market does not focus on improving the service times or overcome the shortcomings existing at the front-end customer service counters.<br>
There is no definite solution that will:<br>
•	Simplify, streamline &amp; optimize the workflow at the customer front-end<br>
•	Eliminate, minimize the bottle-necks &amp; problems at service counters<br>
•	Allow flexibility to withdraw, deposit cash, purchase Instrument in any branch (without magnetic / smarts).<br><br>
2.   Ticket Purchase for Railways, Bus and Airlines<br>
The procedure to purchase journey tickets for travel by railways, road or air is very old and entirely manual in spite of computerization.<br>
Railway Stations<br>
A customers checks accommodation availability status for a particular train and fills up a form and stands in the queue. On reaching the ticket window, hands over the application form, to clerk who again checks the status, enters all information, allots seats, collects payment in Cash or Credit card, prints tickets and hands over ticket to customer.<br>
The problems faced by the customer is that of finding out the available trains, selecting a train, then coming to the railway station to check if accommodation is available or not, then alter the joumey dates and then fill up the form, then stand in a queue. After all this. By the time the customer reaches the ticket window, the accommodation status may have changed. To select a train, a railway time table can be used. To check accommodation customer refers to the status display which depicts availability by green &amp; red tokens or on an electronic display board. In smaller stations this information is given at enquiry counters.<br>
The traveler does not have a choice in the seats allotted. A group of passengers may be allotted separate seats. Senior citizens or ailing persons may be allotted top berths or seats far away from the doors making it difficult to board and alight.<br>
This procedure leads to a lot of delay and long queues and inconvenience to the traveler. Also<br>
as payment by credit card is not popular, the payment has to be made in cash which means an<br>
additional task has be performed by withdrawing from a bank.<br>
Long queues, big crowds are, in today's context a very big security risk.<br>
Advance joumey tickets can be booked on the Intemet. But this facility is restricted to a small<br>
population who are comfortable with using computers and cannot be used in semi urban or<br>
rural places. Also there is an extra cost (Rs.30 per ticket) charged to deliver the tickets by<br>
courier.<br><br>
Bus Stations<br>
The procedure is almost similar. The bus schedule is displayed in the bus stands, or traveler<br>
makes enquiries at the enquiry counters. They then go to the ticket window verbally convey<br>
their travel schedule, the clerk books ticket using computer system and prints ticket, collects<br>
payment and issues ticket to passenger. This procedure is for advance ticket booking.<br>
For current booking, the passengers board the bus (rush in without queue) and occupy seats.<br>
The bus conductor then enters the bus and issues ticket to the passengers.<br>
Though bus routes are scheduled, passengers have to wait and push their way whenever a bus<br>
arrives. There is no system of a passenger queue for buses traveling on a common route.<br>
Air travel<br>
Air tickets are generally purchased through travel agents or airline ticketing offices. Though such a booking can be conveyed on the telephone the ticket has to be physically collected or delivered in person. If a person stays in a place where there is no airport or travel agents then he is dependent on a friend or a contact to book a ticket and deliver it. This entails extra communication costs.<br>
While checking in at the airport, there is a queue at the check-in counter. Baggage has to be checked in and a boarding pass has to be collected. Seats are allotted by the counter staff normally without a proper choice. Persons without check-in baggage, frequent travelers have to stand in this queue.<br>
OBJECTIVES OF THE INVENTION<br>
This Invention makes the process of such transactions very fast, convenient and efficient. Long queues, crowding is eliminated and the process of conducting such transactions becomes very comfortable and easy.<br>
It is a further objective of the invention to provide a new, simple method to facilitate retail-banking transactions using a touch screen transaction kiosk that offers self-service with the following features &amp; advantages:<br>
•	Optimal sequence of operations by user<br>
•	User friendly, training for usage not required<br><br>
Reduces waiting time for customers Reduces crowding at service counters First-come-first-serve Multi-lingual<br>
Customers are not made to wait for jobs in queue Customers need not interact with bank staff for simple queries Saves time &amp; effort put in by Bank staff in performing repetitive &amp; mundane chores Frees up bank staff to offer better personalized services Utilize existing human resources for better operations Improve the work process flow<br>
Allows customers to withdraw / deposit cash. Purchase Instrument, Issue Standing Instructions, Transfer Cash from any branch Improve the security in bank premises<br>
Allow the banks to expand services with minimum infrastructure Deployable at Merchant establishments to accept payments by fund transfer Scalable to adapt to new technology Economical to purchase &amp; maintain<br>
Portable: can be located within premises or at external establishment Minimizes use of paper vouchers, cheques Can be designed to be user friendly for the disabled.<br>

Note:<br>
This is a brief description of the method of conducting 2 types of retail banking transactions.<br>
Other transactions are mentioned in full details in Annexure 1.<br>
Description of ATK100 self service Ticketing transactions (Box 2. Block B) The ATKIOO is connected to the database, enterprise application network of the service establishment like Railways, Bus transport and Airlines. The User Interface extracts relevant information like vehicle schedules, seating acconmiodation, fare calculation etc and presents it to the user Interface.<br><br><br><br>
A person wishing to travel, visits the Railway station and touched the welcome screen of the ATKIOO and follows the procedure given below:<br>
1.	The screen displays an instruction to enter the 'from' and Ho' station names for the journey.<br>
2.	On entering the station names, the screen displays all the trains connecting these 2 stations with the travel schedule and instructs the passenger to select one train.<br>
3.	On selecting one train, the screen asks for a date of journey along with preferred class of travel and number of tickets and individual age of passengers<br>
4.	On entering these details, the screen indicates if the tickets are available for that schedule along with the total cost of tickets and asks if the tickets are to be reserved<br>
5.	If the person touches 'yes' button then the reservation system blocks these specific tickets, prints a receipt with a queue number and travel schedule and all other details<br>
6.	The person takes the receipt, and waits for the queue number to be called by any ticket window clerk.<br>
7.	When the queue number is called, the person goes to the ticket window, gives the receipt, along with the requisite amount of money or credit card.<br>
8.	The ticket clerk prints the tickets and hands over to the person booking the tickets.<br>
Note:<br>
a.	The User Interface will display the appropriate selection buttons like OK,<br>
Cancel, Go to Previous screen, alphanumeric keys and exit which the<br>
passenger touches to input information.<br>
b.	In case of advance reservation, the names of passengers and contact details<br>
can be written manually in the space designed in the receipt depending on the<br>
number of passengers mentioned in the transaction. The names and contact<br>
details will be entered into the reservation system by the counter clerk.<br>
c.	On entering the age of the passenger, the system will automatically calculate<br>
the concession fares for children and senior citizens<br>
d.	The passenger can also select specific seat numbers from the available<br>
accommodation.<br><br>
Purchasing a Bus ticket or airline ticket usim the ATKIOO<br>
The general procedure is same as that for railway tickets.<br>
Note: L  The ATKIOO can be located in bank branches and connected to a transaction processing switch which can be interfaced to the enterprise application software. A person can book tickets from a bank branch and either pay cash at the cashier counter or ask for the amount to be debited from the bank accoxmt in that branch. In this case, a PNR (Passenger Name Record) number will be issued against payment for the ticket. The actual tickets can be collected from the ticket issuing authority against the PNR number prior to the joumey date. 2.  The ATKIOO can be located at any third party merchant establishment that the bank approves and authorizes to conduct retail banking &amp; other transactions on their behalf as a contract. The basic procedure will remain the same. General;<br>
The Invention has been detailed with an arrangement of hardware devices, features and a<br>
process of operations to result in particular transactions.<br>
However many more similar or newer transactions will be possible using, omitting or<br>
altering the process and features.<br>
To name a few:<br>
It will be possible to deploy this kiosk in a merchant establishment to enable payments to<br>
be transferred to merchant for services availed from Customer's account by customer<br>
It will be possible for a person to withdraw cash-self without a printed token, using only a<br>
web cam, or only numeric keypad, or with only the cashier monitoring the transaction.<br>
It will be possible to configure a set of speakers to play recorded voice instructions to<br>
instruct the user to conduct transactions.<br>
It will be possible to allot a one time PIN dedicated to a particular amoimt of cash, which<br>
can be supplied to a beneficiary located in another city, who can use the ATKIOO to<br>
withdraw cash for the single occasion.<br>
It will be possible for a person to deposit a cheque in any city.<br>
It will be possible for a person to check	account balance and  get  an account<br><br>
statement from any branch, in any city.<br>
It will be possible for a person to change PIN<br>
It will be possible to person to make deposits into loan accounts<br>
It will be possible to Issue Standing Instructions<br>
It will be possible for an administrator to monitor the transactions in a network scenario<br>
It will be possible that, high-risk, non-secure areas during late hours, having conducted a transaction in the lobby, the user could need to enter PIN or swipe card to access entry to the premises to receive cash.<br>
It will be possible to transfer cash from account to a smart cash card, (load a smart card) It will be possible to make Utility bill payments.<br>
