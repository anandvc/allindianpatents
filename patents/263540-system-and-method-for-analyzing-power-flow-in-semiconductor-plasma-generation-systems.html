SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR ANALYZING POWER FLOW IN<br>
SEMICONDUCTOR PLASMA GENERATION SYSTEMS<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
[0001] This application claims the priority filing benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application Serial No. 60/689,769 filed June 10, 2005.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
|0002] The present invention relates generally to the measurement of power<br>
flow in RF transmission systems, and more particularly relates to systems and<br>
methods for measuring fundamental and harmonic amplitude and phase relationships<br>
of voltage and current signals in RF-based excitation systems for semiconductor<br>
plasma generators.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] RF plasma reactors of the type employed in processing semiconductor<br>
wafers require a large amount of RF power. Basically, the technique involves the<br>
ignition and maintenance of a processing plasma through the application of electric<br>
power to the plasma. The plasma interacts with gases introduced and with the target<br>
and wafer surfaces involved to affect the desired processing results.<br>
[0004] Due to the increasing complexity of semiconductor devices, tighter and<br>
tighter control over the manufacturing process has been required. In order to achieve<br>
tighter process control in modern plasma processing, it is desirable to obtain more<br>
information about the associated RF voltage and current signals under actual<br>
processing conditions. This usually has been done by available V-I probes inserted in<br>
the power transmission path to measure the fundamental and harmonic signal power<br>
being directed to the plasma generation system.<br>
[0005] Those skilled in the art have recognized that the fundamental and<br>
harmonic amplitude and phase angle relationships of the RF voltage and current<br>
signals account for much of .the variation in process performance during<br>
semiconductor wafer manufacture. Due to non-linearity of the processing plasma,<br><br>
WO 2006/135515<br><br>
PCT/US2006/018087<br><br>
2<br>
harmonics of the fundamental RF excitation frequency will be induced, even if the<br>
load appears to be matched at its fundamental frequency. As a result, the overall<br>
power delivered to the processing plasma includes the sum of the power levels of the<br>
fundamental and harmonic frequencies. Known plasma processing tools routinely<br>
employ two or more RF signal frequencies to enhance process performance yields.<br>
However, the introduction of two or more excitation frequencies into the plasma<br>
generation system tends to increase process uncertainty due to the introduction of<br>
intermodulation frequency components into the total power flow.<br>
[0006] Prior art attempts have been made to characterize power flow in plasma<br>
processing, such as those disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,523,955 and 5,273,610.<br>
For example, U.S. Patent No. 5,523,955 discloses a measuring probe inserted in the<br>
power transmission path for sensing RF signals. The sensed signals are then used to<br>
indirectly derive AC signals for calculating phase angle information relating to the<br>
original sensed signals. However, until the present invention, the techniques required<br>
to directly measure the relative phase angle information of the fundamental and<br>
harmonic frequency content of the RF voltage and current signals in an accurate and<br>
stable fashion have not been readily available to those skilled in the art.<br>
[0007] Therefore, there remains a strong need to provide a system and<br>
method for measuring and analyzing the critical amplitude and phase angle<br>
relationships between the fundamental signal frequencies and harmonics of the<br>
fundamental frequencies. Information characterizing the frequency content of the RF<br>
excitation signals can then be monitored to regulate and control power flow to the<br>
processing chamber in order to improve manufacturing yields, and make plasma<br>
processing more controlled and repeatable.<br>
[0008] Although the present invention is described herein in terms of a system<br>
and method for analyzing power flow in semiconductor plasma generators, those<br>
skilled in the art will appreciate that the present invention may also be used in a<br>
variety of other power transmission systems including, but not limited to magnetic<br>
resonance imaging (MRI) systems and industrial heating systems such as inductive and<br>
dielectric heating systems. For example, in MRI systems, analysis of harmonic<br>
amplitude and phase information may be utilized to control and regulate magnetic<br><br>
WO 2006/135515<br><br>
PCT/US2006/018087<br><br>
3<br>
resonance of transmitted signals under various load (e.g. patient) conditions. In<br>
industrial heating applications, analysis of harmonic amplitude and phase information<br>
may be utilized to control and regulate power flow to the work-piece and/or<br>
processing apparatus to improve processing performance.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0009] A measuring probe for measuring power flow in an RF power<br>
transmission system, including a voltage sensor and a current sensor connected to a<br>
measuring receiver for receiving and measuring RF voltage and current signals. RF<br>
voltage and current signals are converted into digital representations of the RF<br>
waveforms, either directly, or by sampling-based frequency converters that bring the<br>
RF voltage and current signals to a fixed intermediate frequency (IF) before digital<br>
conversion. The digital representations of the RF signals contain fundamental and<br>
harmonic amplitude and phase information relating to the original RF signals. Digital<br>
signal processing circuitry manages data capture, mathematical transforms, signal<br>
filters, scaling, and creation of mathematically alterable analog outputs for external<br>
process control. Also, the circuitry extracts information about the fundamental and<br>
harmonic amplitude and phase components of each of the original RF signals. A<br>
universal serial bus (USB) and/or Ethernet connection is provided for connecting the<br>
measuring receiver to an external computer for additional numerical and graphical<br>
analysis.<br>
[0010] Also disclosed is a method for measuring and analyzing power flow<br>
parameters in an RF transmission system wherein a plurality of measuring probes are<br>
inserted in the power transmission path to determine impedance match, insertion loss<br>
and power flow. The networked probes may provide two-port measurements, and<br>
may be used to determine input impedance, output impedance, insertion loss, internal<br>
dissipation, power flow efficiency, scattering, and the effect of plasma non-linearity<br>
on the RF signal. In one exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a single<br>
measuring receiver is employed to retrieve data from several probes, wherein the data<br>
from the several probes is fed to an external computer for post processing. In another<br><br>

exemplary embodiment, multiple measuring receivers are connected to each probe<br>
individually, thereby allowing for "real time" processing of system data.<br>
[0011] The above and still further objects, features and advantages of the<br>
present invention will become apparent upon consideration of the following detailed<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
[0017] With reference to the drawings which illustrate the basic concepts of<br>
the present invention, Fig. 1 is a general block diagram illustrating a system for<br>
measuring the fundamental and harmonic amplitude and phase relationships in an RF-<br>
based excitation system. One or more alternating power sources 2 generate<br>
alternating voltage and current signals which are transmitted via RF transmission lines<br>
4 through a matching network 5 to a tool chuck 40, which may for example be a<br>
semiconductor plasma reactor. For purposes of the present disclosure, the term<br>
'transmission line' is meant to encompass all known or later developed means for<br>
transmitting electrical signals including, but not limited to coaxial cable, waveguide,<br>
micros trip, twisted-pair, copper wire, and the like.<br><br>
WO 2006/135515<br><br>
PCT/US2006/018087<br><br>
5<br>
[0018] The matching network 5 converts the complex impedance of the plasma<br>
to match the characteristic load impedance for the generator at its fundamental<br>
frequency. A measuring probe 8 is inserted in the power transmission path to<br>
measure the voltage and current signals transmitted through the RF transmission lines<br>
4. The measuring probe 8 is a high power device comprising a voltage sensor 10 and<br>
a current sensor 12 for sensing the voltage and current signals, respectively. The<br>
voltage sensor 10 and current sensor 12 are connected to the center conductor of the<br>
RF transmission line 4, whereby the sensor housing itself becomes part of the outer<br>
conductor of the transmission line.<br>
[0019] The probe 8 is connected to a measuring receiver 14 comprising RF<br>
connector input channels 10a and 12b for receiving the voltage and current signals<br>
from the voltage and current sensors 10, 12, respectively. The receiver 14 also<br>
comprises a digital interface (not shown) for uploading temperature readings and<br>
calibration data stored in the probe housing, so that individual impedance probes can<br>
be calibrated with calibration data stored within the probe housing.<br>
[0020] Referring now to Fig. 2, the current sensor 12 of the measuring probe<br>
8 comprises a single loop of rigid coaxial transmission line that is positioned parallel<br>
with the center conductor 102 of the probe 8 and associated transmission line 4. The<br>
outer conductor of die current sensor 12 is modified to act as a Faraday Shield, so that<br>
extraneous capacitive coupling is eliminated and only the mutually coupled RF current<br>
produces an output voltage. The voltage at one end of the current sensor loop 12 is<br>
connected to the measuring receiver interface in a manner known in the art to measure<br>
the current signals transmitted through the transmission line 4.<br>
[0021] Referring again to Fig. 2, the voltage sensor 10 typically comprises a<br>
disk that is capacitively coupled to the center conductor 102 of the probe 8. The<br>
voltage sensor 10 is connected to the input of the transmission line, which in turn is<br>
connected to the measuring receiver interface to receive and measure the RF voltage<br>
signals from the transmission line 4.<br>
[0022] In one exemplary embodiment of the invention, the cavity region<br>
between the probe housing 101 and the center conductor 102 may be filled with a<br>
dielectric material in order to raise the breakdown voltage so that the measuring probe<br><br>
WO 2006/135515<br><br>
PCT/US2006/018087<br><br>
6<br>
8 can withstand voltage levels in excess of 7500 volts peak. It is understood that the<br>
dimensions of the center conductor 102 and the housing 101 may be adjusted so that<br>
the characteristic impedance of the line section is approximately 50 ohms.<br>
10023] In order to maintain the precision of the measurement results provided<br>
by the probe sensors 10, 12, the temperature of the center conductor 102 and outer<br>
conductor/housing 101 are constantly monitored, and small adjustments to sensor<br>
calibration coefficients are made to correct for inevitable changes in sensor coupling<br>
caused by heating of the center conductor 102.<br>
|0024] Each probe 8 is characterized by a calibration process that determines<br>
the exact current and voltage coupling coefficients and the phase angle between them<br>
over the operating frequency range of the device. During the calibration process, the<br>
temperature of the center conductor 102 and outer conductor /housing 101 are<br>
recorded. This calibration data or information is stored within the probe assembly in<br>
digital form and is retrieved each time the probe 8 is attached to a measuring receiver<br>
14. As a result, multiple measuring probes 8 can share a single measuring receiver 14<br>
because the locally stored temperature readings and calibration data is loaded each<br>
time the probes and receivers are mated. In addition to calibrating the individual<br>
probes, the interconnecting transmission lines are also individually calibrated. The<br>
calibration data from the transmission line is stored within the transmission line<br>
assembly itself. In our exemplary embodiment, the transmission line assembly<br>
consists of two RF cables and a data cable. A digital memory chip is located inside<br>
the data cable connector, allowing calibration data from the transmission line<br>
assembly to be stored within the transmission line assembly itself. The measuring<br>
receiver is adapted to download calibration data from the transmission line and the<br>
probe housing via a digital interface. In this way, the calibration process of the<br>
present invention allows each component to be calibrated individually. This<br>
individual calibration process advantageously allows interchangeability of individual<br>
components in the field without the requirement of performing a total system re-<br>
calibration.<br>
[0025] In operation, the temperature of the center conductor 102 is constantly<br>
monitored using an infrared thermometer 105, and the reading is then compared to the<br><br>
PCT/US2006/018087<br>
WO 2006/135515<br>
7<br>
temperature of the outer conductor/housing 101. The resulting temperature difference<br>
is used to make adjustments to the voltage and current coupling coefficients due to the<br>
change in size and spacing of the center conductor 102 with respect to the outer<br>
conductor/housing 101. Simultaneously, the parasitic reactances associated with the<br>
probe components may also be determined. The calibration process also adjusts the<br>
measured impedance information to account for the parasitic reactance of the probe.<br>
[0026] Turning now to Figs. 3A, 3B, the voltage and current signals received<br>
from the voltage and current sensors 10, 12 are processed similarly. The voltage and<br>
current signals are isolated from each other by the respective voltage channel 10a and<br>
current channel 12b. Due to large fluctuations in signal levels associated with changes<br>
in the operating frequency, an active equalizer 13 is implemented between the voltage<br>
and current sensors 10, 12 in tire form of a wide bandwidth operational amplifier with<br>
capacitive feedback. The equalizer 13 "integrates" the voltage and current signals to<br>
compensate for the "rate-of-change" response of the voltage and current sensors 10,<br>
12. In one exemplary embodiment, the outputs of the equalizers are connected to a<br>
sampling-based frequency converter 15 to bring the signal under test to a fixed<br>
intermediate frequency (IF) before digital conversion. In another embodiment, the<br>
outputs of the equalizers 13 may be connected directly to variable gain stages 18 and<br>
A/D converters 20 for digital conversion.<br>
[0027] As illustrated in Fig. 3A, an optional sampling-based frequency<br>
converter 15 may be used to convert the RF signals and harmonics thereof to much<br>
lower IF frequencies which are then compatible with bandwidth restrictions of existing<br>
high-resolution analog-to-digital (A/D) converter technology. In this embodiment, a<br>
pair of sampling gates 16 are part of a zero-order-hold circuit that captures a small<br>
sample of the RF signal and holds that value until the next sample is taken. The<br>
sampling gates are closed by a narrow pulse of about 300 picoseconds duration.<br>
During the instant that the sampling gate is closed, the RF signal voltage is impressed<br>
on a sampling capacitor. Sampler amplifiers 17 are employed to buffer the voltage on<br>
the sampling capacitor so that the level is maintained between samples. The bandwidth<br>
of the sampler is sufficiently wide so as not to significantly affect the phase of signals<br>
up to about 1000 MHz. Predictable delay related phase shift can be calibrated out in<br><br>
WO 2006/135515<br><br>
PCT/US2006/018087<br><br>
8<br>
the digital signal processing circuits 22. Referring to Figs. 3A, 3B, the IF signals are<br>
phase locked to the conversion cycle of the A/D converters 20 so that a plurality of<br>
samples can be taken for each cycle at the highest desired harmonic of the IF. In<br>
accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the invention, exactly four samples are<br>
taken for each cycle of the highest desired harmonic of the IF. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, the sampling rate is calculated so that the RF waveform reproduced at<br>
the IF frequency maintains the corresponding phase relationship between the<br>
fundamental signal frequency and harmonics of the fundamental signal frequency, and<br>
preserves up to about fifteen harmonics of the fundamental operating frequency.<br>
[0028] One advantage of using a sampling-based frequency converter is that a<br>
local oscillator frequency shift from only about 1.95 to 2.1 MHz is needed to cover all<br>
of the typical plasma generator frequencies of 2, 13.56, 27.12, 60, and 162 MHz.<br>
Moreover, sampling-based frequency converters generally have the simplest<br>
architecture and highest bandwidth when compared to traditional mixer-based<br>
frequency converters.<br>
[0029] However, because sampling down conversion translates all signals<br>
within the input RF bandwidth simultaneously, it may not be entirely appropriate for<br>
systems where multiple excitation signal frequencies are used. In the case of multiple<br>
excitation frequencies, Nyquist sampling may be advantageously used. It is also<br>
contemplated that the sampling means may comprise a combination of a Nyquist<br>
sampling, rate analog-to-digital converter and a band-pass sampling analog-to-digital<br>
converter for sampling and digitizing the RF voltage and current signals. It is known<br>
that Nyquist sampling acquires at least two samples per cycle of the highest frequency<br>
of interest. Once die signals have been digitized, digital signal processing circuitry 22<br>
does additional signal processing including data capture management, mathematical<br>
transforms, filters, scaling, and creation of mathematically alterable analog outputs for<br>
external control systems. A high speed universal serial bus (USB) or Ethernet port 24<br>
serves to connect the probe assembly to an external computer 21 for additional<br>
numerical and graphical analysis. A pair of digital-to-analog converters 26 may be<br>
employed to receive output from the digital signal processor 22 in order to reconstruct<br><br>
WO 2006/135515<br><br>
PCT/US2006/018087<br><br>
9<br>
the original RF voltage and current waveforms. Power supply circuits 28 generate the<br>
necessary internal operating voltages from an external DC supply.<br>
[0030] Referring now to Figs. 4A, 4B, and 4C, there is shown exemplary<br>
waveform data generated in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Fig. 4A illustrates an exemplary raw voltage waveform, Fig. 4B illustrates an<br>
exemplary raw current waveform, and Fig. 4C illustrates an exemplary raw power<br>
waveform. In accordance with the present invention, Fourier transforms are used to<br>
separate the fundamental frequency and harmonic components of the voltage and<br>
current signals so that digital signal processing algorithms can be applied to correct<br>
the amplitude and phase of individual frequency components. This process removes<br>
imperfections in the coupling response of the probe sensors and removes parasitic<br>
reactance associated with probe construction. Individual frequency components may<br>
then be recombined in the proper phase relationships so as to recreate the original<br>
voltage and current waveforms. The output results of the digital signal processing<br>
section comprises voltage, current, phase angle, power and impedance at each<br>
frequency component, along with waveform data.<br>
[0031] When multiple probes are used, the input and output impedances and<br>
insertion loss can also be determined easily. Once the two-port impedance parameters<br>
are determined, all other two-port parameters can be calculated. For example, the<br>
impedance parameters can be converted to admittance or scattering parameters.<br>
[0032] Turning now to Fig. 5, there is illustrated a method for analyzing<br>
power flow in an RF based excitation system, wherein two or more measuring probes<br>
8a, 8b, 8c are inserted at different points in the RF power transmission line 4 so as to<br>
reveal information about power flow parameters in die RF excitation system. For<br>
example,, measuring probe 8a may be inserted between the generator 2 and<br>
transmission line 4, whereas measuring probe 8b may be inserted between the<br>
transmission line and matching network 5, and probe 8c may be inserted between the<br>
matching network 5 and the tool chuck 40. The outputs from the networked probes<br>
can then be combined to reveal information about the impedance match and insertion<br>
loss of the components in the RF excitation system.<br><br>
WO 2006/135515<br><br>
PCT/US2006/018087<br><br>
10<br>
[0033] Measurements from the multiple probes are made simultaneously at the<br>
fundamental and harmonically related signal frequencies. The networked probes are<br>
then interrogated to recover instantaneous voltage, current, and phase information<br>
representing power flow and impedance levels at different points in the power<br>
application path. In this way, the characteristics of transmission lines 4, matching<br>
devices 5, connectors, and reactor plasma itself can then be quantified, for example,<br>
by calculating two-port impedance, admittance, transmission, and/or scattering<br>
parameters associated with pairs of probes. The calculations reveal the characteristics<br>
of each component at the fundamental excitation frequency and each of the harmonics<br>
simultaneously. For example, two-port measurements from the probes 8b, 8c<br>
positioned before and after the matching network, respectively, can be used to<br>
determine input or output impedance (admittance), insertion loss, internal dissipation,<br>
and power transmission efficiency at the fundamental or the harmonic frequencies of<br>
the RF signal. Measurements from probe 8c positioned between the matching<br>
network 5 and the tool chuck 40 can be used to reconstruct the RF voltage and current<br>
waveforms to observe the effect of plasma non-linearity on the RF signals.<br>
[0034] The exemplary methods discussed above provide critical information<br>
about the fundamental and harmonic amplitude and phase relationships of the RF<br>
excitation signals. This information can then be monitored to determine faults and<br>
improper operation in any of the functional blocks during normal tool operation. The<br>
probes may be checked periodically in a maintenance mode, and the measurement data<br>
may be analyzed to identify opportunities for process improvement. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, the measuring probes are constructed to isolate the voltage and current<br>

harmonics of the highest test (i.e. excitation) signal frequency, although it is<br>
