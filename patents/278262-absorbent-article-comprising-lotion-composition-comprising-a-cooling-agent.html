				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a feminine care absorbent article comprising a lotion composition comprising a cooling agent.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Disposable absorbent articles, such as diapers, training pants, and catamenial devices having lotioned topsheets are known. Lotions of various types are known to provide various skin benefits, such as prevention or treatment of diaper rash. These lotions can be applied to the topsheet of absorbent articles, for example, and can be transferred to the skin of the wearer during use.<br>
Certain wearers of disposable absorbent articles, such as catamenial devices, prefer products that can provide sensorial benefits, in addition to fluid absorbency benefits. A sensorial benefit desired by some wearers is a cooling sensation that can convey a feeling of freshness to the wearer. There has thus been a desire to create an absorbent article, such as a catamenial<br>
Previous attempts have been made to incorporate conventional cooling agents, such as menthyl lactate or N-ethyl p-menthanecarboxamide (also known as "WS-3"), in absorbent articles, such as catamenial devices. See, e.g., US 2004/00826654 Al and US 2004/0081680 Al. Due to their volatile property, these materials are generally placed in products that can directly reach the sensory receptors in the skin or mucosal tissue. This is achieved either through direct contact with the target tissue (i.e., oral rinse, nasal spray, massage oil). In the context of an absorbent article these materials are generally loaded into the core of the product. Nonetheless, these conventional cooling agents remain highly volatile such that it can be difficult for such materials in an absorbent article to remain stable upon shipment and storage, especially when exposed to high temperatures during shipment and storage. Other cooling agents have recently been identified that have lower volatility. However, this presents a problem of delivery to the epidermal cooling receptors. Furthermore, some of these cooling agents can be unacceptable to the wearer due to the psychological profile associated with the odor of the cooling agent.<br>
A desire thus remains to develop an absorbent article product that can provide a sensorial benefit to the wearer, such as a cooling sensation, that does not suffer from stability problems<br>
upon shipment and storage of the absorbent article product and can be delivered to the skin of the wearer.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to an absorbent article comprising a lotion composition comprising particular cooling agents and a carrier. In one embodiment, the absorbent article comprises a topsheet, a backsheet, an absorbent core disposed between the topsheet and the backsheet, and a lotion composition disposed on one or more layers of the absorbent article, wherein the lotion composition comprises a carrier and a cooling agent comprising a N-substituted p-menthane carboxamide material having a formula:<br>
Formula Removed<br>
 <br>
in which m is 0 or 1, Y and Z are selected independently from the group consisting of H, OH, C1-C4 straight or branched alkyl, and a C1-C4 straight or branched alkoxy; X is (CH2)n--R, where n is 0 or 1 and R is a group with non-bonding electrons, with the provisos that:<br>
(a)	when Y and Z are H, X is not F, OH, MeO or NO2 in the 4-position and is not OH in the 2 or 6-position;<br>
(b)	when Y or Z is H then X, Y and Z are such that:<br>
(i) the groups in the 3- and 4-positions are not both OMe; (ii) the groups in the 4- and 5-positions are not both OMe;<br>
(iii) the groups in 3- and 5-positions are not OMe if the group in the 4-position is OH; and<br>
(iv) the groups in the 3- and 5-positions are not OH if the group in the 4-position is methyl.<br>
In another embodiment, the absorbent article comprises a topsheet, a backsheet, an absorbent core disposed between the topsheet and the backsheet, and a lotion composition disposed on one or more layers of the absorbent article, wherein the lotion composition comprises a cooling agent having an enthalpy of vaporization of at least 71 kJ/mol at 760 Torr.<br>
The cooling agent is preferably substantially odorless (e.g. having no perceptible odor or only a light or faint perceptible odor).<br>
The absorbent articles of the present invention comprising such cooling agents provide a beneficial cooling sensation to the skin of the wearer of the absorbent article. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING<br>
The Figure is a top view of an absorbent article comprising a topsheet, backsheet, and an absorbent core, with a lotion composition applied thereto.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
As used herein, the term "absorbent article" refers to devices that absorb and contain body exudates, primarily menses. The term "disposable" is used herein to describe absorbent articles which are not intended to be laundered or otherwise restored or reused as an absorbent article after a single use. Examples of absorbent articles include feminine hygiene garments such as sanitary napkins, pantiliners, interlabial devices, hemorrhoid pads, and the like.<br>
The absorbent articles herein are utilized by consumers who can detect and react to sensate materials, such as the cooling agents described herein, and are typically adults.<br>
Disposable absorbent articles and components thereof, including the topsheet, backsheet, absorbent core, and any individual layers of these components, have a body surface and a garment surface. As used herein, "body surface" means that surface of the article or component which is intended to be worn toward or adjacent to the body of the wearer, while the "garment surface" is on the opposite side and is intended to be worn toward or placed adjacent to the wearer's undergarments when the disposable absorbent article is worn.<br>
FIG. 1 shows a catamenial device 10, that can be a sanitary napkin or pantyliner, having a body-contacting surface 12 comprising a topsheet 14, a liquid impervious backsheet 16 joined to the topsheet 14, an absorbent core 18. The sanitary napkin 10 has a longitudinal axis L and may also be provided with additional features commonly found in napkins, including "wings" or "flaps" (not shown) as is known in the art, and , and/or a fluid acquisition layer to promote fluid transport to the absorbent core 18. Likewise, the topsheet of the sanitary napkin can have various optional characteristics, as is known in the art. For example, the topsheet 14 can have channels embossed therein to direct fluid flow, and can have apertures therethrough to aid in fluid acquisition. The topsheet 14 of the catamenial device 10 of the present invention has a lotion composition 22 disposed onto the topsheet.<br>
The topsheet is preferably compliant, soft feeling, and non-irritating to the wearers skin and hair. Further, the topsheet is liquid pervious, permitting liquids (e.g., menses and/or urine) to<br>
readily penetrate through its thickness. A suitable topsheet may be manufactured from a wide range of materials such as woven and nonwoven materials (e.g., a nonwoven web of fibers); polymeric materials such as apertured formed thermoplastic films, apertured plastic films, and hydrofonned thermoplastic films; porous foams; reticulated foams; reticulated thermoplastic films; and thermoplastic scrims. Suitable woven and nonwoven materials can be comprised of natural fibers (e.g., wood or cotton fibers), synthetic fibers (e.g., polymeric fibers such as polyester, polypropylene, or polyethylene fibers) or from a combination of natural and synthetic fibers. When the topsheet comprises a nonwoven web, the web may be manufactured by a wide number of known techniques. For example, the web may be spunbonded, carded, wet-laid, melt-blown, hydroentangled, combinations of the above, or the like.<br>
The backsheet is impervious to liquids (e.g., menses and/or urine) and is preferably manufactured from a thin plastic film, although other flexible liquid impervious materials may also be used. As used herein, the term "flexible" refers to materials which are compliant and will readily conform to the general shape and contours of the human body. The backsheet prevents the exudates absorbed and contained in the absorbent core from wetting articles which contact the absorbent article such as bedsheets, pants, pajamas and undergarments. The backsheet may thus comprise a woven or nonwoven material, polymeric films such as mermoplastic films of polyethylene or polypropylene, or composite materials such as a film-coated nonwoven material.<br>
The backsheet and the topsheet are positioned adjacent the garment surface and the body surface, respectively, of the absorbent core. The absorbent core can be joined with the topsheet, the backsheet, or both in any manner as is known by attachment means (not shown in FIG. 1) such as those well known in the art. However, embodiments of the present invention are envisioned wherein portions of the entire absorbent core are unattached to either the topsheet, the backsheet, or both.<br>
In one embodiment, the topsheet of catamenial device 10 is made of a hydrophobic material. Therefore, if the topsheet is a nonwoven, the constituent fibers are preferably hydrophobic. Fibers are considered to be hydrophobic if film sheets formed from the polymers of the fibers would exhibit contact angles with water greater than 60 degrees, more preferably 75 degrees, and even more preferably greater than about 90 degrees. Contact angles as a measure of hydrophobicity are well known in the art, and methods for measuring contact angles are equally well known. As is well known, contact angles greater than about 90 degrees are considered hydrophobic, and contact angles less than 90 degrees are often considered hydrophilic. As used herein, however, contact angles of 60 degrees or greater are considered hydrophobic.<br>
In another embodiment, the topsheet of catamenial device 10 is made of a hydrophilic material.<br>
The lotion composition of the present invention comprises a carrier and a particular cooling agent. In one embodiment, the cooling agent comprises a N-substituted p-menthane carboxamide represented by the following formula:<br>
Formula Removed <br>
in which m is 0 or 1, Y and Z are selected independently from the group consisting of H, OH, C1-C4 straight or branched alkyl, and a C1-C4 straight or branched alkoxy; X is (CH2)n~R, where n is 0 or 1 and R is a group with non-bonding electrons, with the provisos that:<br>
(a)	when Y and Z are H, X is not F, OH, MeO or NO2 in the 4-position and is not OH in the 2 or 6-position;<br>
(b)	when Y or Z is H then X, Y and Z are such that:<br>
(i) the groups in the 3- and 4-positions are not both OMe; (ii) the groups in the 4- and 5-positions are not both OMe;<br>
(iii) the groups in 3- and 5-positions are not OMe if the group in the 4-position is OH; and<br>
(iv) the groups in the 3- and 5-positions are not OH if the group in the 4-position is methyl.<br>
In one embodiment, X is in the 4-position. In certain embodiments, Y and Z are H, OH, Mc or OMe. In certain embodiments, Y and Z are selected independently.<br>
Useful groups with non-bonding electrons are halogens, OH, OMe, NO2, CN, Ac, SO2NH2, CHO, CO2H and C1-C4 alkyl carboxylates such as CO2Et. Other C1-C4 alkyl carboxylates with non-bonding electrons may be useful.<br>
The compounds of the above formula have 3 chiral centres, giving rise to 8 stereoisomers. All possible stereoisomers are included in the scope of the compounds represented by the above formula.<br>
The cooling compounds may be prepared by reacting an arylalkylamine derivative with an appropriate acid chloride or carbonyl chloride. The carbonyl chloride can be prepared from 1-menthol ((lR,2S,5R)-2-isopropyl-5-methylcyclohexanol).<br>
Non-limiting examples of suitable N-substituted p-menthane carboxamide cooling agents include N-(4-cyanomethylphenyl) p-menthanecarboxamide, N-(4-sulfamoylphenyl) p-menthanecarboxamide, N-(4-cyanophenyl) p-menthanecarboxamide, N-(4-acetylphenyl) p-menthanecarboxamide, N-(4-hydroxymethylphenyl) p-menthanecarboxamide, N-(3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl) p-menthanecarboxamide, or mixtures thereof. A preferred N-substituted p-menthane carboxamide cooling agent is N-(4-cyanomethylphenyl) p-menthanecarboxamide commercially available from Givaudan under the trade name EVERCOOL 180.<br>
The particular N-substituted p-menthane carboxamide cooling agents according to the formula recited above tend to have lower volatility than other more conventional cooling agents, such as those recited in the previous paragraph. Lower volatility cooling agents are especially useful for incorporation in the absorbent articles of the present invention. It is believed that such lower volatility cooling agents are more stable in the finished product upon shipment and storage of the product, wherein the absorbent articles are potentially exposed to higher temperatures. The more conventional and more highly volatile cooling agents tend to be unstable in such shipping and storage environments unless steps are taken to increase the stability such as hermetically sealing the absorbent articles to avoid exposure to the surrounding environment. Such packaging, however, significantly increases costs and results in a product that is less consumer-friendly, e.g. it is more difficult to open and difficult to dispose. Alternatively, the more conventional cooling agents would have to be used at much higher levels in the absorbent article to offset the amount of cooling agent lost during shipping and storage due to volatilization of the cooling agent, thereby resulting in higher costs.<br>
In one embodiment, the particular cooling agent utilized herein will have an enthalpy of vaporization of at least 71 kJ/mol at 760 Torr, or at least 73 kJ/mol at 760 Torr, or at least 75 kJ/mol at 760 Torr. The enthalpy of vaporization is a calculated value determined by using, for example, Advanced Chemistry Development (ACD/Labs) Software V9.04 for Solaris (© 1994-2008 ACD/Labs). For example, N-(4-cyanomethylphenyl)-p-menthanecarboxamide has an enthalpy of vaporization of approximately 75.8 kJ/mol at 760 Torr; 3-(l-menthoxy)-2-methylpropane-1,2-diol (TPG-1) has an enthalpy of vaporization of approximately 71.6 kJ/mol at 760 Torr; and l-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-4-(3-nitrophenyl)-3,6-dihydropyrimidin-2-one (ICILIN or AG-3-5) has an enthalpy of vaporization of approximately 91.9 kJ/mol at 760 Torr.<br>
The particular cooling materials, such as the particular N-substituted p-menthane carboxamides, recited above can be utilized alone, in combination with each other, and/or in combination with more traditional cooling materials known in the art, for example, menthol, menthone, isopulegol, N-ethyl p-menthanecarboxamide (WS-3), N,2,3-trimethyl-2-isopropylbutanamide (WS-23), menthyl lactate (Frescolat® ML), menthone glycerine acetal (Frescolat® MGA), mono-menthyl succinate (Physcool®), mono-menthyl glutarate, O-menthyl glycerine (CoolAct® 10), menthyl-N,N-dimethylsuccinamate or 2-sec-butylcyclohexanone (Freskomenthe®). Such conventional cooling materials tend to have an enthalpy of vaporization of less than 71 kJ/mol at 760 Torr, and preferably less than 65 kJ/mol at 760 Torr. For example, N-ethyl p-menthanecarboxamide (WS-3), N,2,3-trimethyl-2-isopropylbutanamide (WS-23), menthol, menthyl lactate, ethyl 3-(p-menthane-3-carboxamide) acetate (WS-5), menthone glycerine acetal, menthoxypropane-l,2-diol, isopulegol, p-menthane-3,8-diols, N,N-dimethyl menthyl succinamide, (3S,3aR,3bR,4S,7R,7aR)-Octahydro-3,7-dimethyl-4-(l-methylethyl)-lH-cyclopenta[l,3] cyclopropa[l,2]benzen-3-ol (Cubebol®), and menthyl PCA, have enthalpy of vaporization values of approximately 58.4 kJ/mol at 760 Torr, approximately 47 kJ/mol at 760 Torr, approximately 52.5 kJ/mol at 760 Torr, approximately 63.1 kJ/mol at 760 Torr, approximately 64 kJ/mol at 760 Torr, approximately 65.5 kJ/mol at 760 Torr, approximately 70.5 kJ/mol at 760 Torr, approximately 50.4 kJ/mol at 760 Torr, approximately 58.7 kJ/mol at 760 Torr, approximately 63.4 kJ/mol at 760 Torr, approximately 60.2 kJ/mol at 760 Torr, and approximately 66.1 kJ/mol at 760 Torr, respectively.<br>
The particular cooling agents herein, such as the N-substituted p-menthane carboxamide cooling agent, can be blended in a carrier to be described below at a concentration ranging from about 0.0001% to about 10.0%, from about 0.0001% to about 3.0%, from about 0.001% to about 1.0%, or from about 0.01% to about 1.0%, by weight of the lotion composition.

Suitable carriers further encompass waxes. As used herein, the term 'wax' refers to oil soluble materials that have a waxy constituency and have a melting point or range of above ambient temperature, in particular above 25°C. Waxes are materials that have a solid to semisolid (creamy) consistency, crystalline or not, being of relative low viscosity a little above their liquefying point. Suitable waxes which can be incorporated into the lotion composition include animal, vegetable, mineral or silicone based waxes which may be natural or synthetic, and including mixtures thereof. Waxes can include but are not limited to: natural waxes from vegetal origin, such as bayberry wax, beeswax, candelilla wax, carnauba, ceresin, purcelline, shea butter, cocoa butter, Japan wax, jojoba wax, lanolin wax, esparto gras wax, cork wax, guaruma wax, rice shoot wax, ouricury wax, mink wax, montan wax, rice bran wax, spent grain wax, spermaceti wax, steryl dimethicone, sunflower wax, ceresine wax, sugar cane wax, carnauba wax, candelilla wax, fruit-derived waxes, such as orange wax, lemon wax, grapefruit wax and bayberry wax, and the like; and waxes from animal origin such as beeswax, woolwax, bear fat, shellac wax, and the like. Natural waxes further comprise mineral waxes such as ceresin and ozokerite waxes. Synthetic waxes comprise petroleum-based waxes, such as certain carrier materials described hereinbefore, such as paraffin, vaseline, petrolatum, micro wax, and microcrystalline wax. Further suitable synthetic waxes are polyalkylene and polyethyleneglycol waxes, e.g. polyethylene wax; waxes based on chlorinated naphtalenes such as 'Halowax', synthetic hydrocarbon waxes, and the like, PEG-6 beeswax, PEG-8 beeswax, C30 alkyl dimethicone, synthetic beeswax, synthetic candelilla wax, synthetic carnuba wax, synthetic japan wax, synthetic jojoba wax, motan acid wax, motan wax, ouricury wax, rezowax, including<br>

Further suitable waxes are chemically modified waxes, in particular hardened or hydrogenated waxes such as, for example, hydrogenated cottonseed oil, hydrogenated jojoba oil, hydrogenated jojoba wax, hydrogenated microcrystalline wax, hydrogenated rice bran wax, Montan-ester waxes, Sasol waxes, jojoba esters, and the like.<br>
Other wax components can be certain fats (including mono-, di- and triglycerides and fatty acid alkylesters), fatty alcohols, fatty acids, including substituted fatty acids (in particular hydroxy substituted fatty acids, for example, 12- hydroxystearic acid), dialkyl(ene)ethers, dialkyl(ene) carbonates, dicarboxylic acids (in particular the C16-C40- dialkylesters of dicarboxylic acids, e.g. the C16-C40- alkyl stearates, C18- C38-alkylhydroxystearyl stearates or C20-C40- alkyl erucates) and hydroxy fatty alcohols. Still further wax components are selected from the group of aromatic carbonic acids, tricarboxylic acids, or from the group of lactides of long-chained hydroxycarbonic acids. Myristyl lactate is a suitable carrier. Further wax components that can be used are C30-C50 alkyl bees wax; tri-C16-C40-alkyl citrates, e.g. tristearyl citrate, triisostearyl citrate, trilauryl citrate; ethyleneglycol di fatty acid esters, in particular the ethylene glycol di-C12-C30- fatty acid esters, e.g. ethylene glycol dipalmitate, ethyleneglycol distearate, and ethyleneglycol di(12- hydroxystearate).<br>
Other suitable carriers include materials that act as solidifying agents, including some of the materials described hereinbefore. Suitable solidifying agent(s) in the lotion compositions of the present invention can function to help solidify the composition so that the composition is a solid at room temperature and has a melting point of at least 32°C. The solidifying agent may also provide a tackiness to the composition that improves the transfer by adhesion to the skin of the wearer. Depending on the solidifying agent selected, the solidifying agent can also modify the mode of transfer so that the composition tends to fracture or flake off instead of actually rubbing off onto the skin of the wearer which can lead to improved transfer to the skin. The solidifying agent may further function as an emollient, occlusive agent, moisturizer, barrier enhancer, viscosity enhancer and combinations thereof. The solidifying agents can be selected from alkyl siloxanes, polymers, hydrogenated vegetable oils having a melting point of 35°C or greater, fatty acid esters with a melting point of 35GC or greater, alkyl hydroxystearates, branched esters, alkoxylated alcohols and alkoxylated carboxylic acid. Additionally, the solidifying agents can be selected from animal, vegetable and mineral waxes and alkyl silicones.

The absorbent article of the present invention can optionally further comprise indicia to emphasize the cooling benefits or cooling sensation provided by the absorbent article. Such indicia can include graphics, patterns, and the like that comprise colors such as green, blue, or combinations thereof. The colors green, blue, or combinations thereof tend to visually communicate the cooling benefits or cooling sensation provided by the absorbent article to the consumer. Such indicia can be incorporated into the packaging for the absorbent articles or can be incorporated into the absorbent articles themselves, such as inidicia that is printed or impregnated into the components of the absorbent article (e.g. the topsheet or backsheet of the absorbent article).<br>
The absorbent article of the present invention can optionally further comprise essential oil materials that help to connote the cooling benefits or cooling sensation provided by the absorbent article. Such essential oil materials can be incorporated into the absorbent article separate from the lotion composition or can be made part of the lotion composition. Non-limiting examples of suitable  essential  oil  materials   include   Acorns   gramineus,   Anthemis   nobilis,   Artemisia<br>
dracunculus, Basil, Bergamot, Calamintha sylvatica, Caraway, Cedarwood, Chamomile, Cineol, Cinnamon, Cinnamon bark, Citrus aurantium, Clove, Cypress, Dill, Eucalyptus, Eugenol, Frankincense, Galangol, Geranium, Ginger, Hibiscus, Hop, Jasmine, Juniper, Laurus nobilis, Lavender, Lemon balm, Lemongrass, Lemon, Limonene, Linalool, Linalyl acetate, Lippia alba, Marjoram, Melissa, Myrrh, Neroli, Nutmeg, Passiflora, Patchouli, Peppermint, Pinene, Rose, Rosewood, Rosemary, Sage, Sandalwood, Spearmint, Sweet Fennel, Sweet Orange, Thyme, Valerian, Ylang ylang, Hibiscus, or mixtures thereof.

Preferred oils associated with a harmonizing effect include Lavender, Neroli, and Ylang ylang.<br>
The particular essential oils herein, such as described above, can be blended in a carrier at a concentration ranging from about 0.0001% to about 10.0%, from about 0.0001% to about 3.0%, from about 0.0001% to about 0.1%, from about 0.001% to about 1%, or from about 0.01% to about 1.0%, by weight of the lotion composition. The essential oil can also be prepared in a premix in an oil diluent. Nonetheless, the final concentration of the essential oil will typically fall in the ranges described above.<br>
The cooling agents of the present invention, other ingredients of the lotion composition, or the lotion composition itself can be encapsulated in a variety of suitable encapsulation materials. Non-limiting examples of suitable encapsulation materials are described in detail as "Perfume Carrier Materials" in US 7,186,680 at column 25, line 23 to column 28, line 52.<br>
When applied to the outer surface of sanitary napkin topsheets, the lotion compositions of the present invention can be transferable to the wearer's skin by normal contact, wearer motion, and/or body heat, thereby providing a cooling sensation on the skin of the wearer.<br>
The sanitary napkin topsheets of the present invention contain an effective amount of the lotion composition. As used herein, the term "effective amount of a lotion composition" refers to an amount of a particular lotion composition which, when applied to a sanitary napkin topsheet, will be effective in providing a cooling benefit or cooling sensation to the skin of the wearer. The effective amount of a lotion composition will depend, to a large extent, on the particular lotion composition used.<br>
In preparing lotioned absorbent articles according to the present invention, the lotion composition can be applied to the outer surface (i.e., body facing surface) of the topsheet, but can also be applied to the inner surface of the topsheet or to any other component of the absorbent article. Any of a variety of application methods that evenly distribute the lotion composition can be used. Suitable methods include spraying, printing (e.g., flexographic printing), coating (e.g.,<br>
gravure coating), extrusion, or combinations of these application techniques, e.g. spraying the lotion composition on a rotating surface, such as a calender roll, that then transfers the composition to the outer surface of the topsheet.<br>
The manner of applying the lotion composition to the topsheet, or other component, can be such that the topsheet does not become saturated with the lotion composition. If the topsheet becomes saturated with the lotion composition, there is a greater potential for the lotion to block the topsheet openings, reducing the ability of the topsheet to transmit fluid to the underlying absorbent core. Also, saturation of the topsheet is not required to obtain the therapeutic and/or protective lotion benefits. Particularly suitable application methods will apply the lotion composition primarily to the outer surface of the topsheet.<br>
The minimum level of lotion to be applied to the topsheet is an amount effective for providing a cooling benefit or cooling sensation to the skin of the wearer. The lotion composition is preferably applied to the topsheet of the present invention in an amount ranging from about 0.1mg/in2 to about 75 mg/in2 (mg of lotion per square inch of coated topsheet), preferably from about 0.5 mg/in2 to about 60 mg/in2, and more preferably from about 1 mg/in2 to about 60 mg/in2. Such relatively low levels of lotion composition are adequate to impart the desired cooling benefits, yet do not saturate the topsheet's absorbency and/or wettability properties.<br>
The lotion composition may be applied to the entire surface of the topsheet or portions thereof. The lotion composition can be applied in a stripe aligned with and centered on the longitudinal centerline of the disposable absorbent article. The lotion composition can be applied in a plurality of stripes having uniform or non-uniform widths. Alternatively the lotion can be aligned with and centered in apposition to the longitudinal centerline.<br>
The lotion composition can also be applied nonuniformly to the outer surface of the sanitary napkin topsheet. By "nonuniform" is meant that the amount, pattern of distribution, etc. of the lotion composition can vary over the topsheet surface. For example, some portions of the treated surface of the topsheet can have greater or lesser amounts of lotion composition, including portions of the surface that do not have any lotion composition on it. For example, the lotion composition can be applied on one region of the topsheet in the shape of a rectangle and/or a circle, and/or as mutliplicity of dots.<br>
The lotion composition can be applied to the topsheet or other component at any point during assembly. For example, the lotion composition can be applied to the topsheet of the finished disposable absorbent product before it has been packaged. The lotion composition can<br>
also be applied to the topsheet before it is combined with the other raw materials to form a finished disposable absorbent product.<br>
The lotion composition is typically applied from a melt thereof to the absorbent article. Since the lotion composition will typically melt at significantly above ambient temperatures, it is usually applied as a heated coating. Typically, the lotion composition is heated to a temperature in the range from about 35°C to about 100°C, preferably from 40°C to about 90°C, prior to being applied. Once the melted lotion composition has been applied, it is allowed to cool and solidify to form solidified coating or film on the surface of the topsheet or other component. Preferably, the application process is designed to aid in the cooling/set up of the lotion.<br>
Lotion compositions of the present invention can be applied by printing methods, or continuous spray or extrusion as is known in the art, or as is described in US 5,968,025.<br>
It can be preferred that the lotion be applied in a plurality of stripes parallel to the longitudinal axis of the absorbent article. This allows for both transfer of the lotion to a broader area of the vulva and improved fluid handling of the absorbent article.<br>
In another embodiment, instead of (or in addition to) being applied to the topsheet of an absorbent article, the lotion composition can be applied to a wipe article that is supplied with the absorbent article (for example, as described in detail in US 5,569,230 or US 6,911,022). In another embodiment, the lotion composition can be provided as a stand-alone product in the form of a cream product that can be applied to the absorbent article or to the skin by hand. In another embodiment, the lotion composition can be provided as a stand-alone product in the form of a spray product that can be sprayed onto the absorbent article or the skin by the wearer of the absorbent article.<br>
