				<td>This invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of multilayered silver sheathed bismuth based superconducting tapes with high critical current densities.<br>
The multilayered silver sheathed bismuth based superconducting tapes with high critical current densities prepared by the process of the present invention will find application in power transmission, high field magnets for MRI, scientific equipments, particle accelerators, mineral separators and electric motors.<br>
It has been widely accepted that bismuth based high temperature superconductors are suitable for processing superconducting tapes with high critical current densities at 77 K by powder-in-tube (PIT) technique. Reference may be made to our copending Patent Application No. 2370 / DEL / 95 and A.N. Iyer et al. , ; Proceedings of the Symposium on Processing of long lengths of superconductors held in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, USA, p.13 (1994); T. Hikata et al. presented at the International Workshop on superconductivity, Kyoto, Japan (1994); G. Grasso et al. physica C 241, 45 (1995)]. Prototype coils and magnets have been developed by a few research groups using monofilamentary tapes with generated fields of several tesia [ p. Haldar et al. Proceedings of the Symposium on processing of long length of Superconductors held at Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, USA, p-23 (1994) ] . World wide efforts are now being concentrated on development of multifilamentary tapes/wires by different methods with high critical current  densities.     The   following    methods     are     currently<br>
used far fabrication of muitifi1aimentary tapes.<br>
i. Wire clrawing - Rebundling - Wire drawing method [S. X. Dou et al. Proceedings of the Symposium on processing of long lengths of superconductors held at Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, USA, p.31 (1994); K. Kwasnitz et al. Physxca C, 233, 423 (1994)]<br>
In this method the superconducting powder is initially packed in a high purity silver tube of appropriate dimensions. After sealing the ends the tube is groave--rDl 1 ed/drawn into wires. The wires are cut into D ieces and are rebundled in anoth¬er silver tube or in a silver billet in which holes are drilled in a desired pattern. This tuba 'billet bundled wi th wires having the superconductor core inside is further groove-rol1ed/drawn into wi res» These wires are subsequently flat~rolled and heat treated to obtain multifilamentary tapes.<br>
2- Jelly-Rol1 Process<br>
[C.H.  Kato et al. Superconductor Science and  Technology  7,<br>
470 (1994); K.liatsuzaki et al . Japanese Journal of Applied Phys¬ics, 33, L308 (1994)].<br>
Here a layer of superconducting material is deposited on a silver sheet. The deposited sheet is rolled to form a 'jelly-roll' configuration. The jelly-rolled si silver/superconductor composite is subsequently flat—rolled and heat treated to yield muitilayered silver sheathed superconducting tapes,<br>
3. Accordion Folding Method<br>
EL. Martini et al. Superconductor Science and Technology,  7,<br>
24(1994)]<br>
In this method a silver sheet is folded in the form af an accordion with uniform spacing. The spaces between the silver layers are then filled with the superconductor powder- The silver/superconductor layered structure is then uniaxially pressed to form a rectanoular billet. It is then longitudinally cut width-wise so "as to get strips of the layered composite. These strips are subsequently rolled and heat treated to obtain multilayered silver sheathed superconducting tapes.<br>
The main drawback of ail the hitherto known methods for making multifilamentary tapes is the limitation of obtaining high critical current density (Jc). It has been found that the Jc values of the multifi1amentary- t-zpes prepared by the above meth¬ods are considerably lower compared to monofi1 amentary tapes prepared by powder in tube (PIT) method. For example, Jc values greater than 60,000 A/cm2 at 77 K. and self field has been report¬ed for monofilamentary silver sheathed bismuth based supercon-ducting tapes whereas the best result of Jc for multifi1 amentary tapes prepared by the well accepted existing technique, i.e. by wire drawing - rebundling - wir3 drawing method is IS,500 A/cm2 CS.X. Dou et al. Proceedings of the Symposium on Processing of long lengths of superconductors held at Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, USA, p.31 (1994); Y. Yamada et al. Proceedings of the 5th Inter¬national Symposium on Superconductivity, p.717 (1993); fi. Ueyama et al. Japanese Journal of Applied Physics, 30, L1384 (1994)]. This is because the degree of grain alignment and densification of the individual superconducting layers in a multilayered tape are significantly lower than those achieved in a  monofi1amentary<br>
tape . In the fabrication of monafilamentary tapes each tape is separately rolled down to an overall thickness of around 0.09     mm<br>
in different stages tuith intemediate heat treatment. The proc¬ess imparts a very high degree of grain aligment to the bismuth based superconductor core which consists of platy grains. On the other hand, in the hitherto known processes for multilayered tapes, the rol1xng operation is done combinedly for all the 1 ayers right from the beginning. Here;, the load that can be applied during rolling is limid by the deformation characteris¬tics of the soft silver matri layers provided between the alter¬nate layers of the superconducto" core. Therefore, the degree of grain alignment and the densificttion of the individual supercon-ducting layers of the multilayered tapers are considerably lower than that of the monolayer tape prepared by PIT method.<br>
The main objec t of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of multilayered silver sheathed bismuth based superconducting tapes with high critical current densities. It is also the object of the present invention to reduce the silver to superconductor ratio in the fabricated tapes.<br>
The critical current density of mono or multifi1amentary tapes ca.n be improved significantly by increasing the degree of grain alignment along with the rolling direction of the tapes (in the a-b plane) and by increasing the densification of the super¬conducting layer. In all the hitherto known processes for fabri¬cation of  multilayered tapes hardly any afetempt has been made  to<br>
impart increased grain orientation or densification of the individual layers of the superconductor before these are rolled together. As a result, the grain orientation and densification of the individual superconductor layers fabricated by the known processes are considerably lower compared to those of a monolayer tape prepared by repeated rolling and heat treatment. In the present invention multilayered tapes are fabricated from individual monolayer tapes having a high degree of grain orientation and densification. Such monolayer tapes with thickness 0.09-0.2 mm are stacked and folded by a thin silver sheet of thickness in the range 0.05-0.1 mm and are further rolled and heat treated to obtain critical current densities comparable to those of the monolayer tapes. Further, the method allows use of a higher superconductor to silver ratio. Consequently the process of the present invention not only provides multilayered tapes with increased "engineering Jc" but also saves a good amount of high purity silver.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides An improved process for the preparation of multilayered silver sheathed bismuth based superconducting tapes with high critical current densities which comprises<br>
(a)	packing a highly reactive ( Bi.Pb) - Sr-Ca-Cu-O precursor powder free from carbon in high purity seamless silver tubes,<br>
(b)	groove-rolling   and   annealing   the   silver  tubes   to   form   silver sheathed wires with thickness in the range of 0.8-2mm,<br>
(c)	flat-rolling and annealing the wires sheathed (Bi,Pb)-Sr-Ca-Cu-O tapes with thickness in the range of 0.3-0.5 mnn,<br>

(e)	stacking five to twenty numbers of the said monolayer tapes and folding them together by using high purity silver sheets having a thickness in the range 0.05 to 0.1 mm.<br>
(f)	annealing and flat-rolling the folded structure to form multilayered tapes to a thickness in the range 0.25 to 1.5 mm,<br>
(g)	heat treating the multilayered tapes at a temperature in the range of 810-840°C in an oxidizing atmosphere for a period in the range 50-150 h to obtain desired multilayered silver sheathed bismuth based superconducting tapes with high critical current densities.<br>
According to a feature of the process of other present invention the cation stoichiometry of the precursor powder used is Bi : Pb : Sr: Ca : Cu = 1.5 - 1.9 : 0.3 - 0.5 : 1.8 - 2.3 : 2 - 2.5 : 2.5 - 3.8.<br>
