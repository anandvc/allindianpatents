				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a portable device for in-situ sub-sampling of aqueous sediments. The present invention particularly relates to a portable device for close interval in-situ sectioning of unconsolidated aqueous sediments, such as on the sea bed, from either near shore or deep-sea waters, from fresh water river, lake, reservoir, lagoon, estuary, and creek environment, or from the areas of similar water bodies elsewhere. The present invention more particularly relates to a device useful as a portable apparatus having simple mechanical controls for sectioning in-situ aqueous sediments on the sea bed / bottom in real time at the desired / required intervals up to few millimeters, which can be collected in a special core liner by inserting in the core barrel of gravity-or piston- corer or similar other corers.<br>
The novel portable device of the present invention for in-situ sub-sampling of aqueous sediments, enables precise sectioning of the in-situ sediments on the bottom itself and comparatively much faster than the existing devices and methods up to few millimeters level at desired intervals without contamination and mixing, and saves high cost, a large amount of time and manpower. The novel portable device of the present invention enables obtaining precise, uncontaminated, and high quality in-situ sub-sections directly from the sea bed / bottom in real time. Furthermore, the above object is achieved by using a simple, light and portable mechanical device / apparatus which can be taken on board / field and quickly assembled and brought in use. The apparatus is very low cost, environment friendly and destined for reuse for number of operations.<br>
Background of the present invention and related hitherto known prior art references and description are given herein below:<br>
Undisturbed aqueous sediment samples from the seabed are commonly obtained by coring. Although different coring equipments are available the oceanographers depending on the requirement prefers the commercially available gravity corer, piston corer, or spade / box corer for the seabed sampling. The samples obtained by grab are usually mixed and disturbed. Compared to grab, the corer brings a long vertical section of unconsolidated bottom sediments. Considering the changes in the temperature and pressure the sediment undergoes during its travel from the sea floor to the surface, it is necessary that these sediments are cut / sectioned / sub-sampled immediately and preserved to suitable them for the wide range of applications and experiments. Hence, the long core liner from the core barrel are immediately cut and stored in the refrigerated room at a temperature ranging between 1 to 4° C. On the other hand, the geologists, chemists and biologists prefer to sub-sample the sediments in the core liner immediately after its retrieval on board. In the view of<br>
different parameters to be determined, the geologists prefer the sub-sampling of sediments at 1, 2, 5 and 10 cm intervals and the biologists prefer these sections at 0.5, 3, and 5 cm intervals.<br>
The coring samplers have limitations on length of sample from the sea bed. The box or spade core takes relatively short (
The gravity corer is weighted by heavy lead weights for generating the downward momentum of a large mass to embed the corer deep into the seafloor. The sediment or soil is retained in the barrel by means of a core catcher. Steel barrels are usually lined with a plastic liner (Noorany, 1972). Cylindrical gravity corers of 30 cm diameter and 4.6 m length are commercially available. Later, the sub-sampling is done on the exposed sediment by cutting the core liner.<br>
A special cylindrical gravity sampler called as 'free corer' does not require a winch and wire and consists of two assemblies: (a) an expandable weight and casing and (b) a recoverable core barrel attached to a buoyant chamber (Moore, 1961). The device is dropped from a ship and allowed to fall freely to the sea floor. Upon impact, a simple mechanism releases the core barrel and the buoyant float from the weight-casing assembly. The barrel containing the sample is then lifted out of the casing by the buoyant float and rises to the surface. The free corer is an effective means of obtaining near water samples in deep water (Noorany, 1972). The Moore free corer has 1.2 m long and 7.6 cm diameter core barrel. The core liner is cut to expose the sediment to perform sub-sampling.<br>
The piston core device consists of a weight stand mounted above a length of stainless steel core barrel (Kullenburg, 1955). A plastic liner, housing a fitted piston, is inserted into the core barrel to contain the sample. A short open barrel is used to act as a trigger weight. The lifting cable is fitted into a trigger arm with a slack loop and tension is applied by a separate trigger weight. The piston core device is lowered from the ship with a cable to the sea floor. The piston is maintained stationary while the barrel slides past it in to the sediment. When the weight touches the seabed it releases the sampling tube, which falls freely and penetrates in to sediments. While penetrating, the piston creates a partial vacuum state within the core liner, thus improving the amount of sample recovered (Noorany, 1972). The device is then returned to the ship's deck, where the sediment core is removed from the core barrel. The length of sample obtained is rarely longer than 6.1 m and one of the longest underwater samples obtained in single penetration 23 m long silty-clay core recovered by<br>
the 30.5 m long 11.4 cm diameter piston sampler of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (Noorany, 1972). The sub-sampling of the sediment is done in similar way that of the gravity core by cutting the core liner.<br>
In recent years, a pressure differential seafloor corer-carrier for obtaining long core samples of seafloor sediments has been developed (Haynes, 1980). The corer-carrier is composed of two main components: The first component is a pump assembly that pumps seawater and sediment as to create a negative pressure differential; the negative pressure differential being the driving force that forces the corers into the seafloor such that cores of over 30 m in length can be obtained. The second component is a space frame mounted and fastened to the pump and functions as a rack to which conventional corers are attached. Once the corers are embedded to their full length, the pump is used to create a positive pressure differential, which helps to remove the corer-carrier from the seafloor. However, the sub-sampling of the sediment is done on board as mentioned above by cutting the core liner.<br>
Once on deck, the core liner from the core barrel of the piston or gravity core is removed and cut in pieces (usually half to 1 meter length) for handling and preservation. The geologists, chemists and biologists sub-sample / section / split the sediment from the core liner immediately at the required intervals for determining different parameters.<br>
In order to section / split / sub-sample, the sediments in the long acrylic / PVC core liner (of 5 to 15 m length), the gravity or piston corer is removed and kept horizontal on a supporting platform and cut manually along its length by a hacksaw or by an angle grinding machine mounted with a diamond wheel or by using the method developed by Mallik, (1986). After cutting the core liner lengthwise in the two halves, the top PVC cover is removed to expose the sediment and the sub-sampling intervals are marked on the surface of the sediment using knife / sharp edge and scale. This method has many drawbacks. First, the sediment is exposed for long duration. Second, the fine particles generated due to cutting of the acrylic / PVC liner sticks to the exposed surface of the sediment and contaminate. The PVC particles stuck to the sediment are removed using knife or tissue paper. Further, precise sub-sampling of the sediment in the core liner is questionable as the sections are cut vertically with approximation by keeping the core liner horizontal. Changes in the physical, mechanical and pore water properties of the sediment are possible due to time lapsed in sub-sampling process, position of core liner, and also due to time lapsed from the time the sampler brought on board and actual start and end of the sub-sampling.<br>
Kemp et al., (1971) developed a piston extruder using a stationary vertical piston over which a core tube is placed for removing the sediment from the core tube. However, it was pointed that the control of accurate extrusion is difficult for small increments using these arrangements as the extrusion device consist of a variety of fixtures. Later developed device by Glew (1988) claims in providing extrusion of sediment from core tube up to 50 cm length in precise increment of any size, and the incremental motion of the ram is set by fixed stops against an adjustable scale. This clearly implies that the sample increment matches to the fixed stops and portion between two stops can not be further sub-sampled and thus indicate the limitations of the device.<br>
In our co-pending Indian patent application no.: 0736DEL2006, we have described and claimed a portable apparatus which is used for sectioning / splitting / sub-sampling the aqueous sediments in the core liner up to millimeter levels. The device is best used for sub-sampling / sectioning the sediments from the box / spade corer as it limits to the core length of 60-100 cm. Also, the corer is required to be mounted on the apparatus for sub-sampling / sectioning purpose.<br>
All these devices, such as by Kemp et al.,1971; Glew, 1988; and our co-pending Indian patent application no.: 0736DEL2006, cannot do sub-sampling / sectioning / splitting of in-situ sediments on the sea bed / bottom.<br>
Another method of sub-sampling or sectioning the sediments from the small core liner includes holding the liner in one hand and pushing the sediments by a piston in another hand. This method has many drawbacks, such as i) it is difficult to hold in hand the core liner containing sediment &gt; 30 cm length, ii) the liner remains in inclined position, iii) the 'precision' in sectioning the sediments is approximate, iv) the sectioned sample is mixed in the collecting bag, and v) the sample portion is squeezed while removing from the core liner. This method is commonly used for sub-sampling sediments from box / spade corer, and also for those from the gravity- and / or piston corer after cutting the core liner to the required / suitable length.<br>
The purpose of the proposed special core liner / apparatus for sectioning sediments up to few millimeters level is to facilitate rapid, simple, and accurate sub-sampling / sectioning / splitting of the aqueous in-situ sediment on the sea bed / bottom which avoids contamination and mixing, and saves extra expenditure, time, and manpower.<br>
A variety of forms have evolved over several decades starting in 1939 with different techniques to collect sea floor sediment samples. Sediment samplers by Lang A. M. (patent # US2153894, 1939; &amp; US2519056, 1950) are not suitable for sectioning of the sediments from core as the sediment is removed by syringe or operated by single air line. The later developed sea floor sediment sampler by Shipek C.J. (US3165931; 1965) and Kennedy V.C.<br>
(US3347101; 1967) is also not suitable for sectioning of the sediments after retrieval from the seabed. Similarly, patent no. US3707196, 1972; GB1400096, 1975; SU628425, 1978; US4234046, 1980; SU976329, 1982; US4312762, 1982; US4729437, 1988; W08912220, 1989; SU1828488, 1993; DE10057738, 2002; US6742406, 2002 also disclose sediment samplers mainly for the retrieval of the sea floor sediments. However, these samplers though very good for the main purpose of sampling the sediments, fail miserably for accurate in-situ sub-sampling on sea bed / bottom.<br>
The US patent no. US4398361 by Amann et al., (1983) discloses recovery of sediments from the bottom of the sea in which a suction head is lowered into the sediment and continuously moved to scrape the sediment to loosen it. The sediments are therefore mixed because they are suctioned and lifted up, and sub-sampling is not possible on bottom or on board the vessel.<br>
The US patent no. JP2004068250 by Yoshikawa Tadao (2004) discloses sediment sampling method and device for accurately measuring the property of excavated sediment. This device is used in an earth pressure type shield excavator including a pressure chamber for discharging excavated sediment taken in the pressure chamber. However, the device is not suitable for removing the sediments from the core liners and / or sectioning or any type of sub-sampling.<br>
Similarly, the US patent no. CN2687653Y by Huang Honghui (2005) discloses small gravity sediment column type sampling device. However, it is not suitable for sectioning or any type of sub-sampling the sediments using core liner.<br>
A number of devices have been commercially used for scooping, sectioning or slicing the sediments but they all suffer from one or more deficiencies and have limited applications. These devices either utilize powered rotary slicer, or their moving parts are unduly complex. Early sediment scoop device were designed not for the oceanographic purpose but for removing sediment from soups or other liquids, cream from the surface of milk, or jam from cooking vessels or containers, egg slicer. Hence, these devices do not suit for any kind of sub-sampling of sediments.<br>
The US patent no. GB234955 by E. M. B. Griffit (1925) discloses scoop device for removing sediment from the surface of liquids and for other culinary or like purposes consists of a substantially semi-cylindrical vessel with a flat side and a sharp top. However, this device cannot be adopted for precise sectioning or any kind of sub-sampling of sediments. Similarly, the US patent no. US2437637; US2449737 by Bridge E.W. (1948) discloses machine for slicing, cutting, and core removing but, they are not suitable for any type of sub-sampling the sediments.<br>
Domestic grating or slicing machine by Braun E.P.R. and Braun A.K.H. (1960) uses a grating or slicing disc mounted between a cover and a casing whose assembly slides down on a coupling sleeve of a shaft driven by reducing gears mounted within a core (patent # GB829731). This machine is not suitable for sectioning or sub-sampling the sediments from the core liners at the desired intervals. The machine can not perform in-situ sub-sampling of sediments on sea bed / bottom.<br>
Similarly, improved slicing machine by Unexcelled Chemical Corp. (1967) relates to apparatus for slicing food products and arranging them in stack form. More particularly, this apparatus is controlled automatically within close tolerances and underweight stacks rejected so that the stacked slices are packaged in prescribed weights. The slices pass as a stack from the stacker to a two-speed weighing conveyer driven at low speed (patent # GB1055310). The machine therefore can not be used for extrusion and sectioning / sub-sampling the sediments from the core liners. Further, it can not obtain in-situ sub-samples of sediments on sea bed / bottom.<br>
In one of the food slicing machine by Hobart Mfg. Co. (1973), the main object is to converting meat or other material into thin slices of precisely uniform thickness (patent # GB1328431). The working of this machine is therefore not suitable either for extrusion and/ or sectioning/ sub-sampling of sediments from the core liner for scientific purpose. The machine can not be used to obtain in-situ sub-sample of sediments from sea bed / bottom.<br>
The US patent no. US3975957 by Mesecar Rodericks S. (1976) discloses a sediment sampling system with a sampling bed and an elongated roller at one end of the bed for supplying the sheet of sample collecting material. This system mainly helps collection of sediments for predetermined period and can be used for different environmental conditions and but not suitable for the sub-sampling or sectioning of the sediments in the core liners. Further, it can not carry out in-situ sub-sampling of sediments on sea bed / bottom.<br>
Similarly, a scraper proposed by Tanaka Shizuo and Eguchi Sueyoshi (1981) is power driven and helps to scoop the sediment on the ground at one stroke to prevent spillage (patent # JP56115429). The working of this system is not suitable for sectioning the sediments precisely from the core liners and also for obtaining in-situ sub-samples of sediments from the sea bed / bottom.<br>
The US patent no. US4337693 by Dandrea P.L. (1982) discloses pepper coring and slicing apparatus with a conveyor. It has individual pepper holding devices for holding peppers with the stem portion upward. It also has a processing station for coring and splitting the peppers, and a discharge station where the peppers are ejected from the pepper holders and dropped onto a conveyor for further processing. This apparatus is complex and the method is not suitable for precise sectioning/ sub-sampling of the sediments from the core liners for scientific purpose. Also, it can not liable for in-situ sub-sampling of sediments on sea bed / bottom.<br>
The US patent no. US4310969 by Cannizzaro J. and Winston L. (1982) discloses partial coring device designed to meet the objective of merely removing a portion of the core of the fruit and to leave a hole. It is a cylindrically shaped coring device with an axially-slidable side member that alternately ejects and retracts a core-slicing or cutting structure removable of a portion of the core of a fruit. The methodology adopted in the apparatus is not suitable for sectioning/ sub-sampling the sediments from the core liner and also for obtaining in-situ sub-samples of sediments from the sea bed / bottom.<br>
Apparatus developed by Hans A., Jurgen B., Klaus L. and Fritzo P. (1983) mainly deals with the recovery of sediments from the sea bottom (patent # CA1141784) where, the suction head provides low frictional resistance during penetration and high frictional resistance upon retrieval. The apparatus therefore is not suitable for sectioning / sub-sampling the sediments from the core liners. It evenly fails to carry out in-situ sub-sampling of sediments on sea bed / bottom.<br>
The purpose of slicing method of magnetic head core block developed by Homoto Masahiro, Kawai Kazuhiko and Sugiyama Shintarou (1985) (patent # JP60043211) is to facilitate easy operation and prevent core chips from scattering. This device also improves yield by arranging all core blocks in positioning grooves accurately and slices plates, one by one, using a cutter. Lower parts of core blocks are embedded in the grooves and both members are joined into one body by applying an adhesive between the plane of the plate and flanks of each core block. The plate is sliced with the cutter along a reference cutting line. This method makes gap lines of respective core blocks and stress applied to cut core chips by the cutter in the cutting operation is reduced to lessen the inclination for scattering. However, the method described is not suitable for adopting for sectioning / sub-sampling the sediments from the core liners, or achieving in-situ sub-sampling of sediments on sea bed / bottom.<br>
The US patent no. US4497163 by Ogman Abraham (1985) fulfills the object of slicing a large round bale of fibrous agricultural crop material into two or more parts. However, it is not suitable for sectioning the sediments without cutting the core liners and similarly not proper for in-situ sub-sampling of sediments on sea bed / bottom.<br>
Similarly, the US patent no. US4581990 by Matsumoto Hideo (1986) discloses an apparatus developed for slicing vegetables and fruits. One such apparatus had an object to provide a slicing by which a fruit or vegetable, such as a cabbage, can be completely sliced in such a manner that only a core remains. However, such apparatus is not suitable where precise slices / sub-samples of the sediment from the core liner are required for scientific purpose to suit various experiments. Moreover, the apparatus can not be used for in-situ sub-sampling of aqueous sediments on sea bed / bottom.<br>
The sampler by Isotalo Ilkka (1989) is designed particularly for picking up samples from the sediment and/or the aqueous layer near the bottom of a watercourse (patent # WO8912220). Sampling device by Bugiel G. (1992) is in particular designed for taking as far as possible unadulterated fluid samples such as ground water or ground gas (patent # EP0469427). Similarly, unit developed by Hilt B. (1993) is applicable for peeling, slicing and core removal form fruit and vegetables (patent # FR2692188). All these samplers / sampling devices are not suitable for the removing and / or sectioning / sub-sampling the sediments from core liners. In the same way, these samplers can not be used for in-situ sub-sampling of sediments on sea bed / bottom.<br>
Slicing machine by Yoshida Osamu and Tsuchiyama Hiroshi (1994) improves flatness of the cut surface due to the grindstone of an inner peripheral blade (patent # JP6270137). However, machine is not suitable for sectioning / sub-sampling the sediments precisely from the core liners at the desired intervals, or for in-situ sub-sampling of sediments on sea bed / bottom.<br>
Slicing machine by Yamagishi Makoto (1995) uses power and is applicable where cutting resistance due to abrasion when the pressing force of a core is sprayed to a cutter blade (patent* JP7112431). The machine has a position detector to detect displacement of the cutter blade during operation. However, the machine can not be used for slicing / sub-sampling the sediments from the core liners. Similarly, it is not suitable for obtaining in-situ sub-samples of sediments from sea bed / bottom.<br>
Another slicing machine designed by Yoshida Osamu (1995) has a crystal ingot, which is cut into a thin slice by the rotation of the inner diameter blade (patent # JP7304028). Main drawback of this machine that is powered and the contamination is possible from coolant nozzle in the cut edge. Further, it has a gas jetting means for jetting dry air for removing coolant flowing along blade surfaces after cutting, and makes the machine bulky. The machine is not suitable for the precise sectioning the sediments at regular intervals from the core liner. It is equally not suitable for obtaining in-situ sub-samples of sediments from sea bed / bottom.<br>
In the continuous sediment-agitating device by Ikeda Shozo, Nomoto Giichi and Nakajima Katsuji (1999), a large quantity of sediment containing obstructions is agitated (patent # JP11100838). The agitator is composed of a rotary shaft and a large number of linear members. The rotary shaft is fixed with two circular plates separated by a distance in the axial direction, and the outer peripheral parts are provided with a large number of linear member through-holes. Sediment is continuously fed from the filling port and agitated by the linear members before slicing. Thus, the device is not suitable for sectioning / sub-sampling the sediments from the core liner, or for obtaining in-situ sub-samples of sediments from sea bed / bottom.<br>
Similarly, apple slicing device by Surdu Raluca (2000; patent # RO115999) is not suitable for slicing / sub-sampling sediments from core liners mainly because the device has a central cutting rod to remove core and the soft portion of the apple is sliced by some fixed and radially arranged cutting blades inclined at 30°, and requires a compression cover to press the apple manually. In the same way, the device is not appropriate for obtaining in-situ sub-samples of sediments from sea bed / bottom.<br>
Another device by Yamada Yyuzo (2002) for removing sediment deposit in dam lake uses a shield material for sectioning water in the dam pond and a suction pump for sucking sediments from suction region. A separator is used for separating sediments from water sucked by the suction pump (patent* JP2002047633). This method is therefore not suitable for sectioning / sub-sampling the sediments at regular interval from the core liner, and also not suitable for obtaining in-situ sub-samples of sediments from sea bed / bottom.<br>
Sediment sampling adaptor by Umeoka Mikio (2003) allows sampling of sediment in method for Swedish weight sounding test (patent # JP2003027454). It is composed of a cylinder body and a joint member, a thread groove and discharge holes. This adopter has a specific purpose and can not be used for sectioning / sub-sampling the sediments from the core liner, or for obtaining in-situ sub-samples of sediments from sea bed / bottom.<br>
Except for the device / apparatus proposed by Kemp et al.,1971; Glew,1988; and our co-pending Indian patent application no.: 0736DEL2006; the sediment samplers, devices, cutters, splitters, and slicers discussed above suffer from a common drawback such as they all have uncontrolled and variable motion of the sampler which causes changes in the sample texture, and promote churning / mixing and contamination of the sediment, and have no proper mechanism for precise sectioning the sediments at the desired / required intervals from the core liner, or for obtaining in-situ sub-samples of sediments from sea bed / bottom. In addition, none of them can hold the core liner in proper position for precise sub-sampling / sectioning the sediment present inside the core liner. Therefore, using these devices forcibly would certainly damage the precious sediment sample from sea bed, disturb their physical and chemical properties, and effect in mixing and contamination of the sediment sample, and the main object of sectioning the sediments at the desired intervals would not be achieved. Such sediments will not be suitable for any kind of research purpose and laboratory experiments.<br>
Limitations of device / apparatus by Kemp et al., 1971; and Glew, 1988; are that the sample increment matches to the fixed stops and portion between two stops cannot be further sub-sampled and thus indicate the limitations of the device. The apparatus cannot be used to obtain in-situ sub-samples of sediments on the sea floor.<br>
Limitations of our co-pending Indian patent application no.: 0736DEL2006, being that the device is best used for sub-sampling / sectioning the sediments from the box / spade corer as it limits to the core length of 60-100 cm. Also, the corer is required to be mounted on the apparatus for sub-sampling / sectioning purpose.<br>

The portable device of the present invention for in-situ sub-sampling of the aqueous sediments, yields ready and in-situ sub-sections of the aqueous material, i.e. sediment from the seafloor. This in-situ sub-sectioning is not possible using the commercially available corers. One can only collect seabed sample using the existing devices. Those samples have to be sub-sampled later either on board or in the laboratory. The novelty of the device of the present invention is that it can simultaneously sample and also sub-section the same in-situ. The user directly gets the in-situ aqueous sub-samples in an automatic manner. The novel core liner can be reused repeatedly, which in turn minimizes expenditure on purchase of costly core liners. In addition, a lot of time and manpower are also saved by using this device. This device is very user and eco-friendly. It is best suitable for determining various geological, biological and chemical parameters related to the aqueous sediments from the seafloor. The device also ensures minimum mixing or contamination of the material inside the selected sub-sections. The cost of the portable device of the present invention is of the order of Rs. 2000/-.<br>
No existing device is capable of bringing in-situ sub-sections of the aqueous material from the seafloor. The present invention relates to a device useful as a portable apparatus having simple mechanical controls for sectioning in-situ aqueous sediments on the sea bed in real time at the required intervals up to few millimeters.<br>
The non-obvious inventive steps pertaining to constructional features, which enable realization of the novelty of the present invention resides in providing in combination a weight stand having a wire connecting ring, core barrel with nose cone core catcher, core liner and ring holder; wherein the core liner essentially consists of a plurality of vertically placed rings or sections attached by means to form a tubular core liner and each of the said rings / sections having a plurality of diametrically opposite external surface depressions for enabling easy pull-out of ring section of interest of the core liner by means of a ring or section holder having pointed inward projections.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration of the working of the invention in actual practice and should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention in any way.<br>
Example -1<br>
Sub-sampling of core sediments at 0.5 cm interva^ for geological and biological studies: Sediments sections of 0.5 cm interval from box / spade core were required for determining geomagnetic and benthic biological parameters. In order to achieve this, novel / special core liner of 6 cm I.D. and 50 cm length was inserted in the box / spade core containing pelagic sediments collected on board RV A.A. Siderenko. Earlier, the special core liner was prepared by perfectly joining 100 ready acrylic sections (0.5 cm thick and 6 cm I.D.) of core liner with adhesive / packing tape from top to bottom from outside at two positions approximately parallel to each other. The special core liner was removed slowly from the box and taken to wet laboratory on board by protecting the ends and inside sediment, and kept in vertical position and cleaned from outside. During sub-sampling, the adhesive tape from both sides was slowly pulled down / lowered from the top up to the end of the 1st section. Afterwards, the top 1st section was slowly taken out and the sediment present in the section was collected in a fresh polythene bag of appropriate size and labeled as 0-0.5 cm along with the station no., and kept in an ice box. Later, the adhesive tape was further lowered slowly up to the next (i.e. 2nd) section and the sediment present in this section was collected in another fresh polythene bag and labeled as 0.5-1 cm depth.<br>
In this way, the entire sediment in the core liner was sub-sampled at 0.5 cm interval from top to the bottom. At the end, all the acrylic sections of the core liner were cleaned, washed, dried, and kept ready for use after aligning and joining them together with the adhesive tape. All the sub-sample bags from the ice box were transferred immediately to the deep freezer.<br>
Example - 2<br>
Sub-sampling of core sediments at 1 cm interval geological studies: Spade / box core sediments at 1 cm interval were required for determining geochemical and sedimentological parameters. In order to achieve this, novel / special core liner of 6 cm I.D. and 50 cm length was inserted in the box / spade core with seabed sediment collected on board RV A.A. Siderenko. Prior to the operation, the special core liner was kept ready by perfectly joining 50 nos. of 1 cm thick 6 cm I.D. ready sections of core liner by adhesive / packing tape from top to bottom from two sides approximately parallel to each other. The special core liner was taken away slowly from the box and carried to the onboard wet laboratory by protecting both ends and the inside sediment, where it was kept vertical and cleaned from outside. For sub-sampling purpose, the adhesive tape from either side of the liner was slowly removed from the top up to the bottom of the 1st section and the section was carefully removed out along with the sediment. The sediment in the section removed was collected in a fresh polythene bag and labeled as 0-1 cm depth along with the station no. and kept in an ice box. The sediment stick to the section was removed using plastic spatula. Later, the adhesive tape was further lowered down slowly up to the bottom of the next (i.e. 2nd) section and the sediment from this section was collected in another fresh polythene bag and labeled as 1-2 cm depth.<br>
In this way, the entire sediment in the core liner was sub-sampled at 1 cm interval from top to the bottom. At the end, all the acrylic sections of the core liner were cleaned, washed with distilled water, dried, and kept ready for reuse after aligning and joining them together with the adhesive tape. All the sub-sample bags from the ice box were transferred immediately to the deep freezer.<br>
Example - 3<br>
Sub-sampling of core sediments at 2 cm interval for geological and biological studies: Core sediments at 2 cm interval were required for determining sedimentological, geotechnical, geochemical, microbiological and benthic biological parameters. In order to achieve this, novel / special core liner of 6 cm I.D. and 50 cm length was inserted in the box / spade core sediments collected on board RV A.A. Siderenko. Before the operation, the special core liner was kept ready by joining together 25 nos. ready sections of the 2 cm thick and 6 cm I.D. core liner with adhesive / packing tape from top to bottom at two sides approximately parallel to each other. The special core liner was removed from the box giving protection to inside sediment using rubber stopper at both ends, and taken to the on board wet laboratory. After cleaning the core from outside, the adhesive / packing tape from either side of core was slowly removed from the top up to the bottom of the 1st section and the section was carefully taken out along with the sediments. The sediment thus removed was collected in a fresh polythene bag and labeled as 0-2 cm depth along with the station no., and kept in an ice box. The sediment stick to the section was removed using plastic spatula. Later, the adhesive / packing tape was further lowered down slowly up to the bottom of the next (i.e. 2nd) section and the sediment from this section was collected in another fresh polythene bag and labeled as 2-4 cm depth.<br>
In this way, the entire sediment in the core liner was sub-sampled at 2 cm interval from top to the bottom. At the end, all the acrylic sections of the core liner were cleaned, washed with distilled water, dried, and kept ready for use after aligning and joining them together with the adhesive tape. All the sub-sample bags from the ice box were transferred immediately to the deep freezer.<br>
Example - 4<br>
Sub-sampling of sediments from core liner at variable intervals for geological and biological studies: Core sediment at 2 cm interval up to 10 cm depth followed by 5 cm interval up to the end of the core was required for determining sedimentological, geotechnical, geochemical, micorbiological and benthic biological parameters. In order to achieve this, novel / special core liner of 6 cm I.D. and 50 cm length was inserted in the box / spade core sediments collected on board RV A.A. Siderenko. Previously, the special core liner was kept ready as per the requirement by joining together 5 ready sections of 2 cm thick and 6 cm I.D. followed by 8 sections of 5 cm thick and 6 cm I.D core liner with adhesive  / packing tape from top to bottom at two sides approximately parallel to each other. The special core liner was removed slowly by protecting sediments with the rubber stoppers at both ends, and taken to the onboard wet laboratory and cleaned from outside. During sub-sampling, the adhesive / packing tape from either side of core was slowly pulled down from the top up to the bottom of the 1st section and the section was slowly and carefully taken out along with the sediments and collected in a fresh polythene bag and labeled as 0-2 cm depth along with the station no., and kept in an ice box. The sediment stick to the section was removed using plastic spatula. Later, the tape was further lowered up to the bottom of the next (i.e. 2nd) section and the sediment was collected in another fresh polythene bag and labeled as 2-4 cm depth. In this way, initially the sediment in the core liner was sub-sampled at 2 cm interval up to 10 cm depth.<br>
Later, the adhesive tape was further lowered down slowly up to the bottom of the next (i.e. 6th) section (of 5 cm thick) and the sediment was collected in another fresh polythene bag of bigger size and labeled as 10-15 cm depth. Then, the adhesive tape was further pulled down slowly up to the bottom of the next (i.e. 7th) section and the sediment was collected in another fresh polythene bag of and labeled as 15-20 cm depth. In this way, the sediment in the core liner was sub-sampled at 5 cm interval up to the end of the core liner. At the end, all the acrylic sections of the core liner were cleaned, washed with distilled water, dried, and kept ready for use as per the requirement after aligning and joining them together with the adhesive tape. All the sub-sample bags from the ice box were transferred immediately to the deep freezer.<br>
Example - 5<br>
Sub-sampling of core sediments at 1 cm interval geological studies: Gravity core sediments at 1 cm interval were required for comparative studies on geochemical and sedimentological parameters. In order to achieve this, the novel / special core liner of 5.5 cm I.D. and 2 m length was inserted in the core barrel of the gravity corer on board CRV Sagar Sukti. The special core liner was prepared by perfectly joining 200 nos. of 1 cm thick and 5.5 cm I.D. ready sections of acrylic core liner by adhesive / packing tape from top to bottom from two sides approximately parallel to each other. After the successful operation of gravity corer, the special core liner was removed from the barrel, cleaned from outside and cut in to 2 pieces of 1 m each for carrying to shore laboratory by protecting the ends of the liner for inside sediment. For sub-sampling purpose, the adhesive tape from either side of the liner was slowly removed from the top up to the bottom of the 1st section and the section was carefully removed out along with the sediment. The sediment in the section removed was collected in a fresh polythene bag and labeled as 0-1 cm depth along with the station no. and kept in an ice box. The sediment stick to the section was removed using spatula. Later, the adhesive tape was further lowered down slowly up to the bottom of the next (i.e. 2nd) section and the sediment from this section was collected in another fresh polythene bag and labeled as 1-2 cm depth.<br>
In this way, the entire sediment in the core liner was sub-sampled at 1 cm interval from top to the bottom. At the end, all the acrylic sections of the core liner were cleaned, washed with distilled water, dried, and kept ready for reuse. All the sub-sample bags from the ice box were transferred immediately to the deep freezer.<br>
