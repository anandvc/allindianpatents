AS ORIGINALLY FILED<br>
Zeolite material of the pentasil structure type, its preparation and its use<br>
The present invention relates to a zeolite material of the pentasil structure type, in particular of the structure type ZSM-5, having an alkali metal and alkaline earth metal content of not more than 150 ppm and a molar ratio of Si to Al in the range of from 250 to 1500, wherein at least 95% by weight of the spherical primary particles of the zeolite material have a diameter in the range of less than or equal to 1 µm and at least 90% preferably at least 95% of all primary particles are spherical. The present invention also relates to a molding which contains this zeolite material and the use of the zeolite material as such or of the molding as a catalyst. The present invention furthermore relates to a special process in which the zeolite material or the molding which contains this material is used as a catalyst.<br>
In all industrial chemical processes in which catalysts are used, attempts are made to increase the life of the catalysts and hence the time for which it is possible to operate without changing the catalyst and hence without intervention in the process. One measure in this context is to reduce the particle size of the catalysts. In the case of a crystalline catalyst material, for example a zeolite catalyst, this means that the size of the crystals, in particular of the zeolite crystals, should be kept as small as possible.<br>
Zeolites are known to be crystalline aluminosilicates having ordered channel and cage structures which have micropores which are preferably smaller than about 0.9 nm. The network of such zeolites is composed of Si04 and AI04 tetrahedra which are linked via common oxygen bridges. An overview of the known structures is to be found, for example, in W.M. Meier, D.H. Olson and Ch. Baerlocher, "Atlas of Zeolite Structure Types", Elsevier, 5th Edition, Amsterdam 2001. In detail particularly the types assigned by X-ray analysis to the ABW, ACO, AEI, AEL, AEN, AET, AFG, AFI, AFN, AFO, AFR, AFS, AFT, AFX, AFY, AHT, ANA, APC, APD, AST, ATN, ATO, ATS, ATT, ATV, AWO, AWW, BEA, BIK, BOG, BPH, BRE, CAN, CAS, CFI, CGF, CGS, CHA, CHI, CLO, CON, CZP, DAC, DDR, DFO, DFT, DOH, DON, EAB, EDI, EMT, EPI, ERI, ESV, EUO, FAU, FER, GIS, GME, GOO, HEU, IFR, ISV, ITE, JBW, KFI, LAU, LEV, LIO, LOS, LOV, LTA, LTL, LTN, MAZ, MEI, MEL, MEP, MER, MFI, MFS, MON, MOR, MSO, MTF, MTN, MTT, MTW, MWW, NAT, NES, NON, OFF, OSI, PAR, PAU, PHI, RHO, RON, RSN, RTE, RTH, RUT, SAO, SAT, SBE, SBS, SBT, SFF, SGT, SOD, STF, STI, STT, TER, THO, TON, TSC, VET, VFI, VNI, VSV, WIE, WEN, YUG and ZON<br><br>
structure and to mixed structures of two or more of the abovementioned structures are to be mentioned.<br>
Depending on the field of use of the catalyst, the catalyst must have, besides the crystal size, a certain pore size or pore distribution. For example, in the preparation of triethylenediamine, the use of a zeolite catalyst of the structure type ZSM-5 has proven useful. In addition to the properties described above?-the catalyst must also have a certain chemical composition. In the case of the ZSM-5 catalyst, for example, a certain molar ratio of Si to Al in the zeolite material is advantageous.<br>
The use of a zeolite catalyst of the structure type ZSM-5 in the preparation of triethylenediamine is described, for example, in WO 01/02404, the molar ratio of Si to Al being from 100 to 700, particularly preferably from 150 to 250. No information is given concerning the exact preparation of the zeolite active material.<br>
WO 03/004499 describes a process for the selective synthesis of triethylenediamine using a zeolite catalyst, in particular a zeolite catalyst of the . ZSM-5 type, which has a molar ratio of Si to a metal M in the range of greater than 100, preferably greater than 200, more preferably from greater than 300 to 40 000, particularly preferably from 400 to 5000. The metal M, which may occur in the oxidation state III or IV, is selected from the group of Al, B, Fe, Co, Ni, V, Mo, Mn, As, Sb, Bi, La, Ga, In, Y, Sc, Cr and mixtures thereof and Ti, Zr, Ge, Hf, Sn and mixtures thereof, respectively. Aluminosilicate is particularly preferred here. In the example according to the present invention, a sodium aluminosilicate having a ratio of Si to Al of 1000 is used. Nothing is said about particle sizes in this document.<br>
EP 1 215 211 A1 describes a process for the preparation of triethylenediamine, in which the catalyst used is a zeolite catalyst which contains one or more metals M in the oxidation states II, III or IV as oxides, and, where in the case of M being Al, the molar ratio of Si02 to Al203 is greater than 1400. In addition to ZSM-5, further catalysts of the structure type ZSM-11, ZSM-23, ZSM-53, NU-87, ZSM-35 and mixed structures are disclosed. Nothing is said about the crystal size of the zeolite material in this publication, and the only example relates to a zeolite material which contains Si and Ti and hence no Al.<br>
The preparation of a zeolite material of the ZSM-5 type is described in R. Mostowicz and J.M. Berak, Zeolites (1985), 65-72. The crystals disclosed there have sizes of substantially greater than 1 µm. Furthermore, this publication states that the ratio of Si to Al has no influence on the crystal size. Ratios of Si to Al of 30 and 90 are explicitly described.<br><br>
G. Reding, T. Maurer and B. Kraushaar-Czarnetzki, Microporous and Mesoporous Materials 57 (2003), 83-92 describe the preparation of a nanocrystalline ZSM-5 material comprising crystals having a diameter of less than or equal to 100 nm. However, the molar ratio Si to Al is 60. In contrast to the abovementioned publication, Reding et al. state that, depending on the preparation process, the presence of aluminum has a considerable-influence on the particle size distribution.<br>
A.E. Persson, BJ. Schoemann, J. Sterte and J.-E. Otterstedt, Zeolites 15 (1995), 611-619 describe the preparation of a ZSM-5 material having particle sizes in the range of from 130 to 230 nm. However, the molar ratio of Si to Al is in the range of from about 50 to about 230. In order to obtain small particles, this publication expressly recommends synthesizing ZSM-5 with a low ratio of Si02 to Al203. In contrast to a literature reference cited in this publication (C.S. Cundy, B.M. Lowe, D.M.Sinclair, Faraday Discuss. 95 (1993), 235-252), according to which the particle size increases with increasing aluminum concentration, Persson et al. found the opposite effect. According to Persson et al., the zeolite material was prepared using NaOH and also NaCI. Experiments without the addition of a sodium compound led to a decreasing crystal formation rate.<br>
P.A. Jacobs, JA Martens, Synthesis of High-Silica Aluminosilicate Zeolites, Studies in Surface Science and Catalysis, Volume 33, Elsevier, Amsterdam 1987, describe, on page 74 of this literature reference, inter alia that, in the preparation of ZSM-5, the simultaneous changing of two parameters (for example the molar ratio of Si to Al, the salt addition, the Si02 source, the alkalinity of the synthesis system) gives unexpected results which are difficult to predict. For example, crystal structures at a high molar ratio of Si to Al of 750, which have the appearance of intergrown disks, are described. Accordingly, P.A. Jacobs et al. describe substantially lower Si to Ai ratios which are of the order of magnitude of from 14 to 45.<br>
In view of this prior art, it is an object of the present invention, inter alia, to provide a zeolite material which has a high molar ratio Si to Al and simultaneously has very small crystals and moreover an extremely low alkali metal and alkaline earth metal content.<br>
Accordingly the present invention relates to a zeolite material of the pentasil structure type having an alkali metal and alkaline earth metal content of not more than 150 ppm and a molar ratio of Si to Al of from 250 to 1500, wherein at least 90% of the primary particles of the zeolite material are spherical and at least 95%<br><br>
by weight of the spherical primary particles have a diameter ot less than or equal to 1 jam.<br>

The alkali metal and alkaline earth metal content of the zeolite material was determined for the purposes of the present invention according to the method described below: from 0.1 to 0.4 g of a sample of the zeolite material was weighed into a platinum dish and 10 ml each of sulfuric acid and hydrofluoric acid were added. Thereafter, heating was effected on a hotplate and evaporation to dryness was carried out. After cooling, concentrated hydrochloric acid and about the same volume of water were added to the residue and the latter was dissolved with heating. The solution obtained was washed quantitatively into a 50 ml volumetric flask and made up to the mark with water. As a rule, a blank patch was prepared in a corresponding manner.

The diameters of the primary particles as described in the context of the present invention may be determined, for example, via the electron microscopic methods SEM (scanning electron microscopy) and TEM (transmission electron microscopy). The diameters described in the context of the present invention were determined by SEM.<br>
Regarding the molar ratio of Si to Al in the zeolite material, this is preferably in the range of from 300 to 1000, more preferably in the range of from 300 to 900, more preferably in the range of from 300 to 800, more preferably in the range of from<br>

According to further embodiments of the present invention, the molar ratios of Si to Al may also be in the range of from 400 to 600 or from 450 to 500.<br>
The crystalline zeolite material of the pentasile structure type according to the present invention, in particular of the structure type ZSM-5, preferably has a monodisperse particle distribution, wherein the coefficient of variation is less than 50%, preferably less than 25%, even more preferably less than 10%. In this context the coefficient of variation indicates, percentage of the standard deviation from the arithmetic average. The coefficient of variation is thus equal to 100*(delta(X)/X), wherein delta(X) represents the standard deviation and X the arithmetic average of the particle size distribution. The particle size distribution is done in this context using laser diffraction spectrometry according to DIN 13320.<br>
The specific surface area of the crystalline zeolite material according to the present invention, determined according to DIN 66131 (BET), is in general at least 350, preferably at least 400, particularly preferably at least 425, m2/g. For example, the specific surface area is preferably from 350 to 500, more preferably from 400 to 500, particularly preferably from 425 to 500, m2/g.<br><br>
The pore volume of the crystalline zeolite material according to the present invention, determined according to DIN 66134 (Langmuir), is in general at least 0.6, preferably at least 0.7, particularly preferably at least 0.8, ml/g.

The zeolite material according to the present invention, can generally be prepared according to all suitable processes which lead to the zeolite material of the pentasil structure type as specified above and particularly preferably to the ZSM-5 structure type. Regarding possible pentasil structure types, reference may be made to the above list. As examples the structure types MFI, MEL and the mixed structure of MFI and MEL are mentioned.<br>
In general, said zeolites of the pentasil structure type, in particular of the structure type ZSM-5, are prepared by reacting a mixture of an Si02 source and of an AI source and a nitrogen-containing base as a template, optionally also with addition of at least one basic compound, under autogenous pressure or under super-atmospheric pressure in a pressure-resistant container at elevated temperatures in a period of from several hours to a few days, wherein a crystalline product is formed. Said crystalline product is isolated, washed, dried, and calcined at elevated temperatures to remove the organic nitrogen base. In the powder thus obtained, aluminum is at least partly present within the zeolite lattice in alternating proportions with 4-, 5- or 6-fold coordination.<br>
The process according to the present invention is distinguished, inter alia, by the fact that, in contrast to many processes which are described in the prior art, no sodium compound and also no other alkali metal compound and/or alkaline earth metal compound are used as initiators. This avoids the situation where alkali metal and/or alkaline earth metal have to be removed, in at least one additional reaction step, from the zeolite material, which should contain only very small amounts, described above, of alkali metal, or from one of its intermediates.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention also describes a process as described above, wherein no alkali metal compound and no alkaline earth metal compound are used as initiating material and/or starting material in the synthesis of the at least one zeolite material.<br>

aluminum source are used in a ratio which permits the formation of a<br>
crystalline material having a molar ratio of Si to Al in the range of from 250<br>

(iii)       separation of the crystalline material from the mother liquor;<br>
(iv) removal of the at least one template compound from the crystalline material.<br>
The term "primary particle" as used in the context of the present invention denotes particles which are formed exclusively by covalent interaction and in which no Van der Waals interactions are involved in the composition of an individual particle. In the context of the present invention, the term" primary particle" relates to crystals which result from the separation from the mother liquor according to step (iii) described above.<br>

The moldings obtained according to the invention have hardnesses which are in general in the range of from 2 to 15 N, preferably in the range of from 5 to 15 N, particularly preferably from 10 to 15 N.<br>
The present invention accordingly also relates to a molding as described above, having a cutting hardness of from 2 to 15 N.<br>
In the present invention, the hardness described above was determined on an apparatus from Zwick, type BZ2.5/TS1S with a preliminary force of 0.5 N, a feed velocity under the preliminary force of 10 mm/min and a subsequent test velocity of 1.6 mm/min. The apparatus had a fixed turntable and a freely movable punch with built-in blade of 0.3 mm thickness. The movable punch with the blade was . connected to a load cell for force pick-up and, during the measurement, moved toward the fixed turntable on which the catalyst molding to be investigated was present. The test apparatus was controlled by means of a computer which registered and evaluated the measured results. The value obtained is the mean value of the measurements for 10 catalyst moldings in each case. The catalyst moldings had a cylindrical geometry, wherein their average length corresponds to about twice to three times the diameter, and were loaded with the blade of 0.3 mm<br><br>
thickness with increasing force until the molding had been cut through. The blade was applied to the molding perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis of the molding. The force required for this purpose is the cutting hardness (unit N).<br>
The present invention accordingly also relates to a molding, obtainable by a process according any one of the above mentioned embodiments.<br>
The at least one molding according to the invention and/or the molding produced according to the invention can generally be used in all processes or operations in which the properties of the molding and in particular of the zeolite material according to the present invention contained in the molding or a zeolite material prepared according to the invention are desired. Very particularly preferably, the at least one molding according to the invention or the molding produced according to the invention is used as a catalyst in chemical reactions.<br>
The present invention accordingly relates to the use of a molding as described above, or of a molding obtainable by a process as described above, as catalyst.<br>
The zeolite material according to the present invention and/or the moldings according to the present invention are preferably used, for example, in the preparation of epsilon-caprolactam from cyclohexanone oxime and in the preparation of N-vinylpyrrolidone from N-hydroxyethylpyrrolidone.<br>
The use of the zeolite material and/or of the molding in the selective synthesis of triethylenediamine (TEDA) is very particularly preferred.<br>
The present invention accordingly also relates to the use as catalyst as described above, wherein the catalyst is employed for the selective synthesis of triethylenediamine.<br>
TEDA (IUPAC name: 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane) is an important intermediate and final product in the chemical industry, which is used, mainly as such, as a catalyst in the preparation of polyurethanes. A large number of different syntheses, which differ mainly in the choice of the starting materials and of the catalysts used, exists for the preparation of TEDA.<br>
For the preparation of TEDA, it is possible to use a range of different starting materials which contain a C2 building block and/or a nitrogen building block and which may be cyclic or acyclic. Examples of suitable starting materials comprise ethylenediamine, diethylenetriamine, ethanolamine, aminoethylethanolamine, piperazine, aminoethytpiperazine and hydroxyethylpiperazine. Frequently, a single starting material is used, but it is also advantageously possible to use mixtures of<br><br>
two or more suitable starting materials. Usually, water is also added to the reaction mixture. The composition of the product mixture is decisively influenced by the choice of the starting materials, wherein in particular the avoidance of the formation of byproducts, in addition to the availability of the starting materials, is an important aspect with regard to the specification in the working-up to be achieved. In most cases, for increasing the selectivity with respect to the desired product TEDA, the synthesis is carried out in such a way- that only a partial conversion of the starting material or starting materials used occurs. The disadvantage of the low yield is accepted owing to the small amounts of undesired byproducts which can be achieved.<br>
Very generally, the present invention therefore relates to a process for the selective preparation of triethylenediamine by reacting at least one starting material which has a structural unit (I)<br><br>
where R1, R2, R3 and R4, independently of one another, are an hydrogen atom or an alkyl group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms and X is an oxygen atom or nitrogen atom.<br>
Examples of such compounds are, inter alia, ethylenediamine (EDA), monoethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, piperazine (PIP), diethylenetriamine, triethylenetetramine, tri(2-aminoethyl)amine, N-(2-aminoethyl)ethanolamine, morpholine, N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine, N,N'-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine, N-(2-aminoethyl)piperazine and N,N'-bis(2-aminoethyl)piperazine.<br>
In the context of the present invention, it is, for example, preferably possible to prepare TEDA by using piperazine (PIP) as a starting material. It is also possible to use ethylenediamine (EDA) as a starting material. It is also possible to use a mixture of EDA and PIP as a starting material.<br>
The present invention therefore relates to a process for the selective preparation of triethylenediamine by reacting a starting material consisting of<br>
(A)	x% by weight of piperazine and<br>
(B)	y% by weight of ethylenediamine,<br><br>
where x + y = 100 and 0<x and over a zeolite catalyst wherein the contains material as claimed in any of claims to or obtainable></x>
The process according to the present invention can be carried out batchwise and is preferably carried out continuously.<br>
The reaction according to the present invention can be carried out in the liquid phase and is preferably carried out in the gas phase.<br>
The reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of at least one solvent or diluent.<br>
Suitable solvents or diluents are, for example, acyclic or cyclic ethers of 2 to 12 carbon atoms, such as dimethyl ether, diethyl ether, di-n-propyl ether or isomers thereof, MTBE, THF, pyran, or lactones, such as gamma-butyrolactone, polyethers, such as monoglyme, diglyme, etc., aromatic or aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as benzene, toluene, xylene, pentane, cyclopentane, hexane and petroleum ether, or mixtures thereof, and in particular also N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) or water or aqueous organic solvents or diluents of the abovementioned type. Furthermore, ammonia is suitable as a solvent or diluent.<br>
A particularly preferably used solvent or diluent, in particular solvent, is water.<br>
Suitable diluents when carrying out the reaction in the gas phase are also inert gases, such as nitrogen (for example over and above the saturation of the reactor feed) or argon. The reaction is preferably carried out in the gas phase in the presence of ammonia.<br>
The starting components or the reactor feed are or is advantageously pre-tempered.<br>
Suitable reactors in which the process according to the present invention is carried out are stirred containers, in particular tubular reactors and tube-bundle reactors.<br>
The zeolite catalyst, preferably in the form of a molding, is arranged in the reactor, preferably as a fixed bed.<br>
i      The reaction in the liquid phase can be effected, for example, by the suspension, trickle-bed or liquid-phase procedure.<br><br>
The preferred reaction in the gas phase can be effected in a fluidized catalyst bed or, preferably, a fixed catalyst bed.<br>
Where piperazine alone is used as the starting material, preferred procedures are those in which the reaction temperature is in the range of from 300 to 450°C, particularly preferably in the range of from 330 to 400°C. The pressure under which the reaction takes place is in the range of from 0.01 to 50, preferably from 0.5 to 20, bar and particularly preferably in the region of atmospheric pressure, plus the pressure drop which results during passage over the catalyst bed.<br>
More particularly preferably, piperazine is used as a mixture with water, wherein it is more preferable to use a starting material stream which contains at least 10, preferably from 10 to 60, in particular from 20 to 60, % by weight of water, based in each case on the total weight of the starting material stream containing piperazine and water,.<br>
Where piperazine is used as the only starting material, a WHSV (weight hourly space velocity), based on piperazine used in the reaction, in the range of from 0.01 to 5 h-1 more preferably in the range of from 0.02 to 1 h-1 particularly preferably in the range of from 0.05 to 0.8 h-1 is preferred.<br>
Where EDA alone is used as the starting material, preferred procedures are those in which the reaction temperature is in the range of from 300 to 400°C, particularly preferably in the range of from 320 to 350°C. The pressure under which the reaction takes place is in the range of from 0.01 to 50, preferably in the range of from 0.5 to 20, bar and particularly preferably in the range of atmospheric pressure, plus the pressure drop which results during passage over the catalyst bed.<br>
More particularly preferably, EDA is used as a mixture with water, wherein it is more preferred to use a starting material stream which contains not more than 50, preferably not more than 30, in particular not more than 10, % by weight of water, based in each case on the total weight of the starting material stream containing EDA and water.<br>
Where EDA is used as the only starting material, a WHSV (weight hourly space velocity), based on EDA used in the reaction, in the range of from 0.01 to 5 h-1, more preferably in the range of from 0.02 to 1 h-1 particularly preferably in the range of from 0.05 to 0.8 h-1 is preferred.<br>
Where a mixture of PIP and EDA is used as the starting material, the reaction is preferably carried out in such a way that, during continuous operation in the<br><br>
steady state, from 10 to 50% by weight of water and from 90 to 50% by weight of<br>
PIP and EDA (sum of amounts in % by weight of the two compounds PIP and<br>
EDA), more preferably from 30 to 50% by weight of water and from 70 to 50% by<br>
weight of PIP and EDA, particularly preferably from 40 to 50% by weight of water<br>
and from 60 to 50% by weight of PIP and EDA, are fed in, wherein it is optionally<br>
possible to reduce or increase the amount of PIP or of EDA in favor of or at the<br>
expense of EDA or of PIP.	<br>
In this case, the reaction is preferably carried out in such a way that, in continuous operation, the starting material stream contains EDA and PIP in a weight ratio in the range of from 1:1 to 10:1, more preferably in the range of from 2:1 to 6:1, particularly preferably in the range of from 3:1 to 5:1, calculated in each case as the weight of EDA to the weight of PIP,<br>
In the embodiment as described above, according to which from 35 to 60, for example about 40, % by weight of EDA are added, the reaction in the steady state can be carried out in such a way that EDA is converted substantially completely to TED A and PIP, wherein PIP preferably is removed by distillation from the product stream, together with any intermediates and/or byproducts additionally present, and, if necessary after removal of at least one of these intermediates and/or byproducts, about the same amount of EDA is added and the resulting mixture containing EDA and PIP is recycled to the reaction.<br>
This procedure is preferably carried out in such a way that the consumption of PIP on balance tends to zero, and consequently substantially no additional PIP is added during continuous operation.<br>
In this procedure, it has surprisingly been found that the amount of EDA discharged tends to zero. The separation of the reactor discharge is therefore particularly simple.<br>
A particular advantage of the process is that intermediate fractions which contain both TEDA and PIP can be recycled to the reaction.<br>
Where a mixture of EDA and PIP is used as the starting material, preferred procedures are those in which the reaction temperature is in the range of from 290 to 400°C, preferably in the range of from 310 to 370°C, particularly preferably in the range of from 310 to 350°C. The pressure under which the reaction takes place is in the range of from 0.1 to 10, preferably in the range of from 0.8 to 2, bar and particularly preferably in the range of atmospheric pressure, plus the pressure drop which results during passage over the catalyst bed.<br><br>
Where a mixture of EDA and PIP is used as the starting material, a WHSV (weigni hourly space velocity), based on the amines used in the reaction, is preferably in the range of from 0.05 to 6 h-1 more preferably in the range of from 0.2 to 2 h'\ particularly preferably in the range of from 0.3 to 1 h-1.<br>
The use of the catalyst according to the present invention, preferably in the form of moldings, is distinguished, inter alia, by the fact that a very high catalyst life-is achieved. This is in general more than 1000 hours, preferably at least 1200 hours, more preferably at least 1400 hours, more preferably at least 1600 hours, more preferably at least 1800 hours, particularly preferably at least 2000 hours. With constant reaction parameters, no deterioration of the conversion in the reaction was observed during the abovementioned catalyst lives.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention also describes a process as described above, wherein the catalyst has a life of at least 1200 h.<br>
Very particularly preferably, the catalyst is used at least partly in the H form. If a part of the catalyst is not used in the H form, this part is very particularly preferably used in the NH4+ form. Particularly preferably, the entire catalyst is used in the H form.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention also relates to a process as described above, wherein at least a portion of the catalyst is used in the H form.<br>
In a further embodiment of the process according to the present invention , the catalyst, after use and independently of its form, for example after a decrease in the activity and/or the selectivity, is regenerated by a process in which the regeneration is effected by specific burning off of the deposits responsible for the deactivation. An inert gas atmosphere which contains exactly defined amounts of oxygen-donating substances is preferably used for this purpose. Such a regeneration process is described, inter alia, in WO 98/55228 and DE 197 23 949 A1, the respective contents of which are hereby fully incorporated into the present application by reference.<br>
After the regeneration, the activity and/or the selectivity of the catalyst have increased compared with the state immediately before the regeneration.<br>
The zeolite catalyst used according to the invention and to be regenerated is heated, either in the reaction apparatus (reactor) or in an external oven, in an atmosphere which contains from 0.1 to about 20 parts by volume of oxygen-donating substances, particularly preferably from 0.1 to 20 parts by volume of oxygen, to a temperature in the range of from 250 to 800°C, preferably from 400<br><br>
to 550°C, in particular from 450 to 500°C. The heating is preferably carried out at a heating rate of from 0.1°C/min to 20°C/min, preferably from 0.3°C/min to 15°C/min, in particular from 0.5°C/min to 10°C/min.<br>
During this heating phase, the catalyst is heated to a temperature at which the generally organic deposits present there begin to decompose, while at the same time the temperature is regulated via the oxygen content and therefore does not increase in such a way that damage to the catalyst structure occurs. The slow increase of the temperature or dwelling at low temperature by adjusting the corresponding oxygen content and the corresponding heating power is a substantial step for preventing local overheating of the catalyst in the case of high organic loads of the catalyst to be regenerated.<br>
When the temperature of the exit gas stream at the reactor exit decreases in spite of increasing amounts of oxygen-donating substances in the gas stream, the burning-off of the organic deposits is completed. The duration of the treatment is generally in each case from 1 to 30, preferably from about 2 to about 20, in particular from about 3 to about 10, hours.<br>
The subsequent cooling of the catalyst thus regenerated is preferably carried out in such a way that the cooling does not take place too rapidly, since otherwise the mechanical strength of the catalyst may be adversely affected.<br>
It may be necessary to subject the catalyst, after the regeneration by calcination, as described above, has been performed, to washing with water and/or dilute acids, for example hydrochloric acid, in order to remove any inorganic load of the catalyst which may remain due to contamination of the starting materials (traces of alkali metals, etc.). Further drying and/or further calcination of the catalyst can then be carried out.<br>
In a further embodiment of the process according to the present invention, prior to the heating according to the regeneration procedure, the at least partly deactivated catalyst is washed with a solvent in the reactor used for the reaction or in an external reactor, in order to remove desired product still adhering. The washing is carried out in such a way that the desired products adhering in each case to the catalyst can be removed therefrom, but temperature and pressure are not chosen to be so high that the generally organic deposits are likewise removed. Preferably, the catalyst is only rinsed with a suitable solvent. Consequently, all solvents in which the respective reaction product is readily soluble are suitable for this wash process. The amount of solvent used and the duration of the wash process are not critical. The wash process can be repeated several times and can be carried out at elevated temperatures. When CQ2 is used as the solvent,<br><br>
supercritical pressure is preferred, otherwise the wash process can be carried out under atmospheric, superatmospheric or supercritical pressure. After the end of the wash process, the catalyst is generally dried. Although the drying process is generally not critical, the drying temperature should not too greatly exceed the boiling point of the solvent used for the washing, in order to avoid abrupt evaporation of the solvent in the pores, in particular in the micropores, since this may lead to dardSgl'to'fhe catalyst as well.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the preparation process, the continuous process according to the present invention for the synthesis of TEDA need not be interrupted for the regeneration of the catalyst according to the present invention, in order to increase the throughput of the process. This can be achieved by the use of at least two reactors connected in parallel, which can be operated alternately.<br>
The catalyst regeneration can be carried out in such a way that at least one of the reactors connected in parallel is decoupled from the respective reaction stage and the catalyst contained in this reactor is regenerated, at least one reactor always being available for the reaction of the starting material or of the starting materials in each stage in the course of the continuous process.<br>
For improving its purity, the TEDA obtained according to the invention can be recrystallized from suitable solvents, for example pentane or hexane. In general, however, this is not required since TEDA can be prepared by the process according to the present invention with purities of at least 95 % by weight, preferably at least 96 % by weight, particularly preferably at least 97 % by weight.<br>
in a particular embodiment, the claimed TEDA preparation process is combined with the subsequent TEDA process according to DE 199 33 850 A1.<br>
According to this combination, TEDA is first prepared as described above. In the subsequent working-up of the TEDA (e.g. by distillation), which may be a multistep process, the TEDA is vaporized, preferably in the last working-up stage (in particular distillation or rectification stage), and the TEDA vapor which, for example, is obtained at the top or in a side take-off of the distillation column and preferably has a purity greater than 95% by weight, in. particular greater than 97 % by weight, is introduced into a liquid solvent. This introduction of the TEDA vapor directly into a liquid solvent is also referred to below as a TEDA quench.<br>
The introduction of the TEDA vapor into the liquid solvent is effected in a quench apparatus, for example preferably in a falling-film condenser (thin-film, trickle-film or downflow condenser) or in a jet apparatus. The TEDA vapor can be passed<br><br>
cocurrently or countercurrently with the liquid solvent. The introduction of the TEDA vapor from the top into the quench apparatus is advantageous. Tangential feeding of the liquid solvent at the top of the falling-film condenser or feeding of the liquid solvent through one or more nozzles in order to achieve complete wetting of the inner wall of the quench apparatus is furthermore advantageous.<br>
In general, the temperature in the TEDA quench is established by bringing the solvent used and/or the quench apparatus to the temperature of from 20 to 100°C, preferably 30 to 60°C. The absolute pressure in the TEDA quench is in general from 0.5 to 1.5 bar.<br>
In general, the procedure is effected in such a way that, depending on the type of solvent, solutions having a TEDA content of from about 1 to 50 % by weight, preferably from 20 to 40 % by weight are first obtained in the TEDA quench.<br>
By subsequent crystallization of the TEDA from the resulting solution, pure TEDA of high quality is obtained.<br>
The liquid solvent is generally selected from the group consisting of cyclic and acyclic hydrocarbons, chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, alcohols, ketones, aliphatic carboxylic esters, aliphatic nitriles and ethers.<br>
For the preparation of a solution of pure TEDA according to the above process combination, which can be used, for example, as a catalyst solution in the preparation of polyurethane foam, an alcohol (e.g. ethylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol or, preferably, dipropylene glycol) is preferably used as the solvent for the TEDA quench. The color number of a resulting 33% strength by weight TEDA solution in dipropylene glycol is less than 150 APHA, in particular less than 100 APHA, very particularly less than 50 APHA.<br>
The solutions thus obtained generally have a shelf-life of more than 6, preferably more than 12, particularly preferably more than 24, months with respect to the color number.<br>
For the preparation of pure (crystalline) TEDA according to the above process combination, an aliphatic hydrocarbon, in particular a saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon of 5 to 8 carbon atoms (e.g. hexane, heptane or, preferably, pentane) is preferably used as the solvent for the TEDA quench. The crystallization of the pure TEDA from the TEDA solution prepared according to the invention can be effected by the methods known to a person skilled in the art. The TEDA crystals obtained by a subsequent multistage, or preferably one-stage, crystallization have high purity (purity of in general at least 99.5, in particular at<br><br>
least 99.8, % by weight, PIP content less than 0.1, in particular less than 0.05, % by weight, N-ethylpiperazine content less than 0.02, in particular less than 0.01, % by weight) and the color number of a 33% strength by weight solution in dipropylene glycol is less than 50 APHA, in particular less than 30 APHA.<br>
All APHA numbers are determined according to DIN ISO 6271.<br>
The following examples and figures illustrate the invention.<br>

The analyses of the reaction discharges after an operating time of 162, 716 and 1147 hours are summarized in table 1.<br><br>
Accordingly, both the activity of the catalyst and the selectivity were improved by the water treatment of the ZSM-5 powder under hydrothermal conditions. Under PIP-neutral process conditions, an operating time of at least 1147 hours was achievable at constant TEDA selectivity and an EDA conversion of more than 95%.<br>
Comparative example 1: Preparation of ZSM-5 powder with addition<br>

was 853mg/kg. The molar Si : Al ratio was 475 : 1. The BET surface area, determined  according to  DIN 66131,  was 464 m2/g  and  the  pore volume,., determined according to DIN 66134, was 0.95 cm3/g.<br>
Comparative example 2: Production of a molding containing treated<br>
ZSM-5 zeolite<br>
The molding was carried out analogously to example 2, starting from 120 g of ZSM-5 powder from comparative example 1. 131 g of ZSM-5 catalyst extrudates having a cutting hardness of 6.1 N were obtained. The BET surface area, determined according to DIN 66131, was 332 m2/g and the pore volume, determined according to DIN 66134, was 0.63 cm3/g.<br>
Comparative example 3: Preparation of tetraethylenediamine (TEDA)<br>
from piperazine (PIP) and ethylenediamine<br>
(EDA)<br>
The catalyst from comparative example 2 was tested analogously to example 3.<br>
The analysis of the reaction discharge after an operating time of 30 hours gave an EDA conversion of 92%, a PIP conversion of 45% and a TEDA selectivity of 94%. The increased sodium concentration thus led to a reduction in the EDA conversion.<br>
Comparative example 4: Production    of    a     molding     containing<br>
commercial ZSM-5 zeolite<br>
120 g of the commercially available zeolite powder PZ-2/1000H (from Zeochem, H-ZSM-5, molar Si : Al ratio of 500, rounded cuboid primary particles having maximum edge lengths a, b and c of 5, 4 and 2 µm and an Na20 content of less than 100 mg/kg) were molded analogously to example 2 with Ludox AS40. 133 g of ZSM-5 catalyst extrudates having a cutting hardness of 3.9 N were obtained. The BET surface area, determined according to DIN 66131, was 337 m2/g and the pore volume, determined according to DIN 66134, was 0.23 cm3/g.<br>
Comparative example 5: Preparation of tetraethylenediamine (TEDA)<br>
from piperazine (PIP) and ethylenediamine (EDA)<br>
The catalyst from comparative example 4 was tested analogously to example 3. The analysis of the reaction discharge after an operating time of 46 hours gave an EDA conversion of 98%, a PIP conversion of 42% and a TEDA selectivity of 88%.<br><br>
The use of ZSM-5 having a particle size of more than 1 µm led to a significantly lower TEDA selectivity.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
