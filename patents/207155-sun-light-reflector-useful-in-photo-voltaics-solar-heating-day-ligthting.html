GRANTED<br>
2-5-2004<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the last three decades solar energy has been recognized as a potential source of energy for various purposes. The two known components of sunlight namely light and heat are being converted in to useful energy. Light is converted in to electricity through photo-voltaic cells and heat is either being used for heaters or for generating electricity through thermal power plants.<br>
It is common knowledge that photo-voltaic power generation in spite of all its advantages is the costliest of all available options. For this reason,   the progress in this area has not been quite impressive.<br>
In countries between 45 degree north and 45 degree south latitude sunlight is quite rich and it can be harnessed for many purposes including power generation. But power generation through solar thermal plants is also quite costly, particularly when compared with coal based power generation. For this reason all our present and future projects have been opted for only those places where for geographical reasons and limited demands, advantages of cheap coal based plant are nullified and solar energy option is more viable.<br>
For heating purposes, solar energy is being used for solar cookers, water heaters etc. Through government efforts, large number of families is using solar cookers. Owing to low cost and easy handling these cookers are becoming popular. Some non-government organizations are promoting large size of cookers suitable for community mid-day meals.<br>
For lighting and heating of the buildings also solar energy is being harnessed. This is done through passive reflectors and glazed windows/roofs.<br>
However, as yet no device has been invented which can help harnessing solar energy to fuller extent at affordable price for individual users for domestic<br><br><br>
purposes  or  for  small  requirements.  The  cost of machines is high for reasons narrated later herein.<br>
IMPORTANCE OF SUN- TRACKING<br>
Solar energy begins to shower on the earth as soon as the sun appears on the eastern horizon. Its intensity increases until noon, then it begins to decrease until sun sets in the west. This variation is due to angularity of the sun-beams in relation to the surface of the earth. In the morning the sun-rays have to pass through greater layer of air and dust particles; also each unit area of sun-beam falls on larger area of earth-surface due to this angularity.<br>
While nothing can be done to reduce the layer of air and dust, human effort can help in catching larger amount of sunlight by keeping the receiver perpendicular to the sun-beams. This activity of moving objects according to the movement of the Sun is known as sun-tracking.<br>
By sun-tracking, not only the output of the system increases but also some activities like producing high temperature become possible.<br>
PROBLEMS IN SUN TRACKING:<br>
Sun tracking is very complex affair for following reasons:<br>
1)	Sun changes its route everyday throughout the year.<br>
2)	Sun takes different time every day during the year to travel from eastern horizon to western horizon.<br>
3)	Both the route and the timing vary fromplaceto-place even on the same day of the year.(Therefore ho simple mechanical device could be designed so far which could help in following the route of<br><br><br>
the sun at every place in the world - this has precluded large scale production of a mechanical device which could be universally useful).<br>
For collecting sun rays concentrators are used.<br>
They are to be moved in the direction of the sun. This can be done by fixing the mirror on a machine moving on north-south axis and rotating from east to west. The mirror has to be oriented towards sun at sunrise. Then with the climbing of the sun the machine is to be rotated from east to west.<br>
When such a simple rotation is given, it is observed that the mirror does not follow the route as explained below because except on equator the sun moves not only westward but also north-south-north-ward also.<br>
3 A probable solution is to move mirrors slowly towards south also, from sunrise to noon. So we need following information, and a device to achieve this:<br>
1)	Angle of deviation from east at sunrise.<br>
2)	Angle of elevation of the sun at noon.<br><br>
3)	Time taken by the sun to traverse from horizon to reach noon position.<br>
4)	A device to move the mirror both westward and southward at the required speed calculated from the<br>
     above three information.<br>
But unfortunately this arrangement will not work on next day because all 3 factors namely:<br>
1)	Angle of deviation from east at sun rise,<br>
2)	Angle of elevation of the sun at noon and<br>
3)	Time  taken by  the  sun  to  traverse from<br>
horizon  to reach noon position,<br>
will be different every day. So we have to have the information for all the 365 days of the year and the mirror-rotating device has to be programmed for these different movements and for different timings.<br><br><br>
This is a horrible work. Unfortunately, even if such a machine is built, it will be useful for that particular place. It will not work at a place with different latitude.<br>
For this reason no device could be invented which can have simple function and universal application. Therefore, electronics-supported costly systems were opted by large-scale users of solar energy and nothing could be done for small users.<br>
One can imagine the problem of reflecting light on a point of one's choice when sun-tracking itself is a tough task, because for reflecting light, not only the sun is to be tracked but the mirror has to be moved such that the light is always reflected on the desired place even though the angle of incidence and reflectance are changing every moment.<br>
These problems have been solved by the device of the present invention. The advantages of the machine are as follows:<br>
1)	It can be operated manually, through torque of<br>
spring or by electricity.<br>
2)	It is a universal model.<br>
3)	It can reflect light on any point of users' choice, thereby making possible - kitchen-cooking, heating and day-lighting of the buildings, keeping costly photo¬voltaic panels fixed and even inside lock and key while receiving light through a window etc.<br>
4)	Its functioning is very simple and needs no<br>
technical knowledge to operate.<br>
5)	It can be repaired easily.<br>
6)Its cost is low.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
As mentioned earlier, owing to the complexities of the movement of the Sun no mechanical device could be built which could track- the Sun on each day of the year and at each place in the world at a price affordable to a small-scale user.<br><br>
With the advancement of Science and Technology and efforts of inventors, many systems have come into existence
The inventor is working hard for last many years to invent a machine for Sun-tracking which could be manufactured at a price affordable for ordinary people for domestic application, and at the same time it could be convenient to install and use and would suit to their lifestyle.<br>
8    At present there are also some machines which can send sunlight into the kitchen for cooking. These machines have a parabolic mirror which rotates on parallel-earth-axis and sends light along this axis into the house. They cannot send iight to any point of users' choice. This limitation (coupled with high cost and unsuitability to lifestyle has precluded its acceptability to the users; this machine can be used for daylighting also but with the above limitations.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has been devised to reflect sunlight at a point of user's need for daylighting, heating etc. This has two parts namely sun-tracking part and the reflector part^ Sun-tracking part is based on polar-axis tracking with novel featuresto make it a completely automatic system.<br>
Inventor has devised declination-setter which automatically sets the sun-tracking-bar according to the declination of the sun for the day of operation, and thereby does away with the two-axis tracking to cope with the north-south-north movement of the sun during the day or the trouble of adjusting for sun-declination in the polar-axis tracking.<br><br><br>
The present invention has arrangement for starting of the machine at a particular time of the day through time-setter. This has advantage over the sensor-based systems, which have problem if the morning is cloudy and the light lining is far away from the actual point of sun-rise. This has advantage of not only cost but also of simplicity over the computer-data-software based systems because their data and software are place-specific; also in the present invention there is absolutely no necessity of calculating angle of reflectance for the mirror -the machine performs both the jobs simultaneously - the sun-tracking and the reflection on the desired target area.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
FIG. 1.<br>
This is perspective of the complete machine. The parts that need elaboration are separately shown in Figure 2-A, 2-B and 6.<br>
1.	Stand -  to support the whole structure.<br>
2.	Base pipe - to hold revolving arc couple (3) and the shaft (7-A)<br>
3.	Arc-couple - revolving on pipe (2) . Free to move 360 degree, thereby, together with arc-couple(6) makes possible to move mirror in any direction and even then maintaining same distance between the pivot of director bar (10) and pivot of mirror-arm(12) .<br>
4.	Axle - giving free movement to mirror arm (12) caused by sliding director-bar (10) in north-south-north direction when in operation.<br>
5.	Pipe- holding axle(5-A) . Axle (5-A) fitted inside pipe (5) helps to give free movement to mirror-arm<br>
(12) caused by movement of director-bar (10) in the east-west direction when in operation.<br>
06.	Arc-couple - fitted on arc couple (3) with nut-<br>
bolt for adjusting the position vertically in the<br>
desired direction.<br><br><br>
7.	Arc - made of two arcs and having gap to allow its placing on the supporting rod (7-A) such that the rotating bar (9) can be placed on the position parallel to the axis of the earth. This position is attained by bringing the rotating bar in geographical north-south line (alternately called meridian line) and then by moving it in vertical plain by an angle equal to the latitude of the place of operation, e.g. at a place at 30 degree north latitude, the northern end of rotating-bar will have to be moved upwards by an angle of 30 degree in relation to horizontal line.<br>
8.	Declination setter - This device automatically sets the director-bar according to the declination of the Sun on that day. It is described in details in the description of the figures 2-A and 2-B.<br>
9.	Rotating bar - fitted on arc(7) on free bearings. This has to be placed parallel to the axis of the earth. This position is attained by bringing the rotating bar in geographical north-south line (alternately called meridian line)  and then by<br>
moving it in vertical plain by an angle equal to the latitude of the place of operation, e.g. at a place at 30 degree north latitude, the northern end of rotating-bar will have to be moved upwards by an angle of 30 degree in relation to horizontal line.<br>
10.	Director bar - When adjusted by the declination setter for the date of operation, and moved by the rotating bar it remains sun oriented. And as the movement of the Sun has two components namely east-west and north-south-north, the director-bar also moves accordingly. By its movement the director-bar moves the mirror-arm (12) to a position that it reflects sunlight on the target-area.<br>
11.	Slide - Either spherical or cylindrical, fitted on the director-bar and sliding on the mirror-arm (12), it helps to move the mirror-arm (12) in east-west and south-north-south direction.<br>
12.	Mirror-arm - Holds mirror and is moved by the slide<br>
(11). Has free movement in two directions because of free axles(4) and (5-A) .<br><br>
13.	Timer - Moves the rotating bar at a speed of one round every 24 hours. This starts working as soon as the alarm-clock sends the message to start operation and continues to move the rotating-bar (9) until the alarm-clock sends the message to stop and come back to the original position for the next morning. The original position for the next day would be different and would be taken care of by the time-setter .<br>
14.	Bar-disc - The bar of this bar-disc is virtually extension of the director-bar (10) . It is to be fitted on the free end of the director bar (10) passing through the mirror-arm (12). There is a disc between the director-bar (10) and this bar. Mien the director-bar (10) is moved such that there is no shadow of this bar on the disc, it is ensured that the director-bar is sun-oriented.<br>
15.	Time setter - It is attached with the arc (7) on a metal-plate. The user may fix the time for starting of the machine automatically with the help of this component and an alarm-clock (16). This is described in detail in the description of figure - 6.<br>
16.	Alarm-clock - This is a simple alarm-clock which sends the message to the motor of the timer (13) to start and end the working at a specified time everyday. The user has an option to program the starting and ending of the movement of timer-motor (13) as per his choice through electronic circuits {these circuits may be used to bring back the director bar (10) to the position of next day immediately after stopping of the timer at the end of the day) .<br><br><br>
Fig.2-A<br>
l.Axle - This axle is fitted at 90 degree on the rotating bar and has free movement along its circumference. It is moved by the movement of bar (3) caused by the movement of calendar-disc(5).<br>
2.	Sliding Clamp - This holds axle (1) by the two ends of a nail passing through the axle diametrically. By this arrangement only one component of the two-dimensional movement of the calendar-disc is transferred to axle(l).<br>
3.	Bar - It is fitted on one end on the calendar disc loosely, and on the other end on the sliding clamp (2) . By virtue of the dimensions of this bar and calendar-disc (5) , and by the movement of the calendar-disc the desired change in the angle of axle<br>
(1) and thereby in the director-bar (4) is achieved.<br>
4.	Director-bar - Numbered as (10) in Pig-I -It is fitted on the axle(l) firmly and has the same angular movement which the Axle-1 gets due to movement of calendar-disc(5).<br>
5.	Calendar-disc - It has marking for each day on its circumference. It revolves on a pivot fitted on bar(6) and has free movement of 360 degrees. On this, bar-3 is loosely fitted so that the circular movement of the calendar disc is not obstructed by friction.<br>
6.	Bar - It holds calendar disc on pivot. It is parallel to the axle(l).<br>
7.	Timer - this moves the calendar disc at the speed of one round per year.<br>
8.	Rota ting-bar - Numbered as (9) in Pig.-I -This rotates on polar-axis at a speed of one round per 24 hours.<br><br><br>
Fig. 2-B.<br>
01    Rotating-bar - Numbered as (9) in fig.-l. It rotates on<br>
polar-axis. On this all components of the declination-setter are fitted.<br>
02. Calendar-disc - This has marking for each day of the year along its circumference. It is fitted on a pivot on the rota ting-bar (1) and has free movement in 360 degrees.<br>
03. Pivot - This is fitted on the center of the line joining position for two equinoxes on the calendar disc.  It is fitted on rotating bar.<br>
04.  Director-bar -	Numbered as (10) in figure 1.<br>
This is fitted	on the calendar disc firmly at<br>
an  angle  of	66.5  degree  with  the  line<br>
perpendicular	to   the   line   joining   two<br>
equinoxes.<br>
05.  Timer - This moves the calendar-disc at a speed of one round per year.<br>
PIG.-6 -<br>
1.	Timer - This moves time disc (2) at a speed of one round per year.<br>
2.	Time-disc mover - This disc has marking for each day of the year and fitted on one side of the time-setter-plate (4) and fitted firmly with the time disc (3) with an axle passing through the base-plate(4). When moved by  the  timer  it moves  time  disc<br><br><br>
through the common axle between itself and time-disc(3).<br>
3.	Time-disc - This has varying radius corresponding to each date of the time-disc mover.<br>
4.	Time-setter-base-plate - On this all components of time-setter are fitted.<br>
5.	Time point - This is a flat square shaped thick plate sliding on a groove fitted on time-setter-base-plate. It is so fitted that one of the two opposite corners touches the time disc (3) and on its other corner time bar (6) rests after the end of the day to begin working at the appointed time as per users choice. This point is shifted by the movement of the time-disc because of its varying radius for each day.<br>
6.	Time-bar- This is fitted on a co-axial pipe on the rotating bar numbered in Fig-1 as (9) whose cross section is represented by (7) and which is fitted on that position of the rotating bar according to the desire of the user for the starting time of the machine.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The description of machine is given in two parts to give a clear idea of each part - the sun-tracking part and the reflector part.<br>
Part-1:  Sun-tracking system<br>
The inventor had independently discovered that sun-tracking could be very simple if it is done on polar-axis. Later, he came to know that this was already<br><br><br>
known to scientists. The present sun-tracking system is based on polar-axis tracking.<br>
On this polar-axis, if a bar is rotated such that its direction and speed neutralize the rotation of the earth, and a second bar is fitted on this bar, and then this second bar is once oriented towards the Sun, this second bar will remain sun-oriented throughout the day. The rotating-bar neutralizes the movement of the earth by moving from east to west (while the earth rotates from west to east on its polar-axis).<br>
However, because of the revolution of the earth around the Sun, position of the earth undergoes change everyday. Therefore next day, the second bar, let us name this as director-bar, will have to be moved north or south depending upon the movement of the sun. The inventor in his earlier invention (application 559/mum/2002 dtd.26 June 2002) solved this problem by using a calendar-arc on which there was marking for fixing the director-bar The director-bar could be fixed for the date of operation manually, or through an electronically programmed motor.<br>
Looking to the modern life style of people and the constraints in the industrial and commercial organization a completely automatic system would be preferable where there is no need to adjust any component daily, but at the same time it should be simple and sturdy so that in case of failure in the electronic equipments etc. there is a provision to continue its working.<br>
However,  there  are  following  problems  in making  a mechanical automatic system :-<br>
01. The declination of the sun is un-even during the year. The difference is very vast which can be seen as follows :-<br>
Period.	Declination-Change (northwards)<br>
March 22 to Apr 22 - 12 degrees April 22 to May'22 - 8 degrees May 22 to June 22  -    3 degrees<br><br><br>
This uneven change in declination has evaded any mechanical solution. Therefore the scientists have opted sensor/computers etc for the purpose.<br>
02. The movement of the sun cannot be synchronized with the clock. This is so because the length of the day i.e. difference between two local noon is not always 24 hours. The variation can be as much as one minute. The cumulative effect of this variation over a period of time is too much; the earliest local noon at any place is 11-44 a.m. and the latest is 12-14 p.m. - a difference half-an hour. This change also being un¬even during the year, also evades any mechanical solution.<br>
The researchers and the industry have opted sensors, computer and software as solution to these problems. Obviously, these systems are very costly and require some skill to use them. For these reasons their market is not picking up.<br>
Present inventor has devised mechanicaldeclination-setter and time- setter which work automatically and the machine is not to be adjusted manually or through computer software.<br>
Inventor has invented these new components which ensure working of the machine through-out the year and there is no need of adjusting the director bar for each day. The innovation is useful for all sun-€racking systems based on polar-axis tracking. The device to set declination has been named as declination-setter and it is based on the following principles.<br>
The earth moves around the Sun with a tilted axis at 23.5 degree, and completes one round in 365.25 days. Let us imagine that the position of the Sun and the earth are interchanged. By interchanging the position of the sun and the earth we find different angles of sunrays on the earth- axis during the revolution. In the figure we can see that all these angles will be created if we rotate the earth-axis around a perpendicular on the ecliptic i.e. an imaginary plain<br><br>
IN which the earth revolves around the sun during the year A cone of 23.5 degree will be created by this rotation. Now if we change the position of earth-axis and sunrays, we get the angles for each day of the year by rotating sunrays such that it forms a cone of 23.5 degree on the earth axis as shown in the figure-3.<br>
From the above we get a formula that if on the rotating bar our director-bar is rotated such that it forms a cone of 23.5 degree, then it can cover all the positions of the sun during the year.<br>
To translate the above principle into an innovation the inventor has devised two mechanisms, these two versions are described under Description Of figures 2-A and 2-B.<br>
The  device  of  time-setting  is  based  on	the  actual<br>
experience of the difference in the timing of	noon and is<br>
described under the description of figure -	6 as Time-<br>
setter .<br>
Part-2 : Reflecting-system<br>
As seen above the sun-tracking itself is a very complicated work and therefore computers have been put to service for the purpose. When the light is to be reflected/concentrated within the system a good sun-tracking system is sufficient because a concentrator can be fitted in the system which can be kept sun-oriented and the sun-rays get concentrated on the focal point of the concentrator. But when the light is to be reflected on a point outside the system the job becomes still tougher, because as shown in figure (5) angle of incidence of sunlight and therefore, the angle of reflectance goes on changing every minute of the day and therefore this new factor is to be taken care of, in addition to locating the position of the Sun. Looking to the complexity of the problem in existing systems help of computers is being taken.<br><br><br>
After so much experimentation and reflecting on the problem, the inventor has tound the solution through a novel idea. The solution is based on using the principles of reflection of Light, basic geometry and the simple mechanics as explained below:<br>
I. Reflection Of Light:<br>
As per the principles of Optics when a ray falls on the mirror the angle between the incident ray and the reflected ray is divided equally by a perpendicular on the mirror at the point of incidence as shown in the figure (7-a).<br>
2.Principles of Geometry :<br>
As per simple principles of geometry in an isosceles triangle the line which divides the angle between equal sides equally, is perpendicular on the third side as shown in figure (7-b).<br>
3. Combining 1 and 2 above :<br>
The inventor has combined these two principles to devise a formula for reflection of ray of light whose direction is known and the direction of the target is also known.<br>
As shown in figure (7-c) , we have a triangle ABC where sides AB and AC are equal. If a ray of light CA is to be reflected in the direction AB then the mirror MR will have to be placed such that a perpendicular on the mirror at point A divides angle BAC in to two equal parts - as per the laws of reflection quoted above. In this position all the rays coming parallel to CA will be reflected in the direction parallel to AB. Now if the position of the mirror is shifted to the position of BC, even then all the rays parallel to the line CA will be reflected in the direction parallel to AB. This will happen so because AD is perpendicular on both - MR and BC, and therefore line MR and BC are parallel to each other. So we get a formula that if the rays are coming in the direction parallel to one of the equal sides of an isosceles triangle and they are to be<br><br><br>
reflected towards the direction parallel to the other equal side of the triangle then the mirror has to be placed along the line parallel to the third side of the triangle, or the mirror may even be kept along the third line itself.<br>
Now, coming to the application of the above formula we have to remember that we have to reflect the light coming from the Sun which is changing its position every moment of the day. Therefore, the point C will go on shifting its position because AC will always be sun-oriented, whereas the line BA will always be fixed as we have a fixed target to reflect light upon. When CA will be shifted, C will occupy some other position, say E, in the space, which will not be coplanar with our triangle ABC as shown in figure (7-d); therefore to be sure that our system continues to work we must ensure that the mirror is brought along the line BE so that all the three lines continue to be coplanar. We have also to ensure that the triangle ABC continues to be isosceles and the rays coming from the Sun are reflected along the direction parallel to AB - our target.<br>
Therefore we must create following arrangement where:<br>
1)	Line AB is fixed,<br>
2)	Lines CA and BC are moveable on points A and B<br>
respectively so that they can be always kept coplanar with<br>
the line AB.<br>
3)	The isosceles character of the triangle ABC is<br>
maintained - by keeping the length of CA and AB same, while<br>
the length of the line BC goes on changing due to change in<br>
the angle BAC as shown in figure (7-d) .<br>
APPLICATION  OF  MECHANICS  AND  MAKING  OF  THE MACHINE.<br>
Now to realize what has been narrated above in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 we have to have three bars to occupy the positions of the three sides of our triangle ABC.<br><br><br>
Nomenclature:<br>
For convenience let us name the components which are designed on the basis of above principles: As shown in figure (8):<br>
1)	Sun-tracking bar will occupy the position of the line CA and may be named as SUN-ARM,<br>
2)	Bar holding the mirror will occupy the position along the line BC and may be named as MIRROR-ARM,<br>
3)	At the point B, mirror will have its pivot and may be named as MIRROR-PIVOT,<br>
4)	Sun-tracking bar - SUN-ARM - will rotate on point A as its pivot, therefore let us name this point A as SUN-ARM-PIVOT.<br>
5)	Bar occupying the position of the line AB will be<br>
oriented towards target and may be called TARGET-ARM.<br>
Now following arrangements are to be made as shown in figure 9:<br>
1.	Mirror-arm must be sufficiently long to allow all possible locations to point C after knowing the longest angle which the sun-arm may bear with the target-arm. It must have sliding-space on which the sun-arm will slide for different locations of C.<br>
2.	Target-arm must be oriented towards the target and then must be fixed securely on a base to ensure that movements of sun-arm and mirror-arm do not disturb its fixed position. The<br><br><br>
target-arm must also have on one end of it a pivot for the mirror-arm, and arrangement to allow the movement of mirror-arm both ways - one in the circular direction along the circumference of the target arm and the other in the plane of sun-arm and target arm. The target-arm must have on the other end a pivot for the movement of sun-arm both ways as described above for the mirror-arm.<br>
The sun-arm must have on it arrangement to slide on the space provided on the mirror-arm.<br>
If the above arrangements are made our system is complete for reflection of light on target area. However, if the size of the mirror is equal to only BC, then reflected light will keep changing the position and the target will not be fully illuminated at any point of time - for this we must extend the size of the mirror from B to F position as shown in figure- 9. Also the size and shape of illuminated area will go on changing and therefore size of the mirror should be such that the whole target area is always illuminated. An elliptic shaped mirror would be preferable, as it would illuminate (nearly) a circular area throughout.<br>
COMBINING THE TWO PARTS:<br>
To combine the two parts we have to place the director-bar - described in Sun-tracking Part - in the sun-arm position of the system described above in Reflector-Part. The sun-tracking part may be replaced by any other system in the market if the user chooses so, and may opt only reflecting-part of the present invention.<br>
As shown in figure-1 in the actual design of the machine, however, while the same principle is used, the target-arm is truncated and moved differently. Also the sun-arm-pivot, though occupying the position as per original plan, is located in the rotating-bar.<br><br>
FUNCTIONS OF THE COMPONENTS AND THEIR ASSEMBLING FOR OPERATION :-<br>
The whole device is supported by stand (1) .  The stand (1)  has to be adjusted such that the shaft  (7-A) supporting are (7) is in vertical position.<br>
Arc (7) is then placed on the supporting shaft (7-A) such that the rotating bar (9) comes in the position parallel to the axis of the earth. Circular shape of Arc(7) ensures that in any position of the rotating bar (9) the pivot point of director bar is at the same distance from mirror-pivot.<br>
The mirror is fitted on the mirror-arm (12) such that its surface is precisely parallel to the axle(4). Free movement of axle (4) and- (5-A) must be checked before slide (11) is fitted into mirror-arm (12) and the machine is put to operation.<br>
With the help of declination-setter (8) the director-bar (10) is set at the position for the date of operation. In this position the director bar has the same angle with the rota ting-bar (9) as the sun has with the earth-axis on that day of the year.<br>
Also the Time-setter is also fixed at the date of operation so that the machine starts at the desired time next day. Timer of the Time-setter is also put on.<br>
Before starting timer (13) the director-bar which has extension on the other side of the mirror arm (12) bar disc (14) is fitted and the rotating bar is rotated on either side until there is no shadow of the bar on the disc. This ensures sun-orientation of the director-bar (10) .<br>
Then Arc-couple (3) and (6) are so adjusted that the sun-light is reflected on the desired target area. The sun orientation of the director bar (10) must be<br><br><br>
checked  again  and  arc  couples  and  director  bar adjusted if be necessary.<br>
Now the timer (13),timer of the declination setterand the timer of the time-setter must be put on.<br>
WORKING OF THE MACHINE :-<br>
When timer (13) energized by spring work / electricity starts moving the rotating bar (9) , the director bar<br>
(10)	also starts moving. This movement of the<br>
director bar (10) ensures that it is constantly sun<br>
oriented.  By the movement of director bar, the slide<br>
(11)	fitted on the director bar (10) starts moving the<br>
mirror arm. The mirror-arm has movement in two<br>
directions and as explained earlier, it continues to<br>
occupy the position of the third side of the triangle<br>
which ensures reflection of sun light parallel to the<br>
direction of target arm. As long as the timer (13)<br>
keeps moving the rotating bar at the speed of one<br>
round every 24 hours, sun-light is reflected<br>
continuously on the target area until the sun sets in<br>
the west.<br><br><br>
