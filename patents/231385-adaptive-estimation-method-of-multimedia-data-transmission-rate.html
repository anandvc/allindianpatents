				<td>1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a multimedia data transmission system<br>
based upon a real-time transport protocol (RTP)/real-time transport control<br>
protocol (RTCP) in a wired IP (internet protocol), and particularly, to a method for<br>
adaptively estimating a transmission rate of multimedia data by using a function of<br>
monitoring an RTCP network state.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
In general, conditions such as a sufficient bandwidth, a small delay and a<br>
small packet loss and the like should be ensured to transmit multimedia data<br>
through a wired IP network such as the Internet. However, a network layer in a<br>
current wired IP network cannot provide a function suitable to meet quality of<br>
service (QoS) required for video transmission. Therefore, the QoS should be<br>
secured by a higher layer of the network layer. To this end, a real-time transport<br>
protocol (RTP) and a real-time transport control protocol (RTCP) operated on a<br>
transport layer have been proposed.<br>
The RTP is an Internet protocol for real-time multimedia data such as the<br>
audio and video generated in real-time. Although the RTP itself does not ensure<br>
real-time transmission of data, by using the RTP, application programs for<br>
2l5transmission/reception in real-time multimedia data transmission system can<br><br>
support streaming data. The RTP is commonly executed on a UDP (user<br>
datagram protocol). The RTCP is a protocol used to maintain the QoS (Quality of<br>
Service) of the RTP. The RTP is related only to the data transmission whereas the<br>
RTCP relates to monitoring of the data transmission and the transmitting of<br>
session-related information. RTP nodes send to one another, RTCP packets in<br>
order to analyze a network state and to periodically report whether the network is<br>
congested. By the use of the RTP and the RTCP, characteristics according to time<br>
limit in transmitting multimedia data may be considered and it is possible to cope<br>
with a loss generated in the network.<br>
	In a general multimedia data transmission system, a multimedia<br>
application program (application layer) detects the network state through the<br>
RTCP and controls an encoding rate of real-time multimedia data to be<br>
transmitted. The controlling of the encoding rate of the real-time multimedia data<br>
is made through transmission rate control, and a general method of estimating an<br>
ineffective transmission rate by using network state information by the RTCP uses<br>
the following equation 1.<br>
1.22x5	(equation 1)<br>
R(t) =<br>
RTT(t)x p(t)<br>
The R(t) indicates an effective transmission rate, the p(t) indicates a<br>
packet loss ratio and is obtained by the RTCP transmitted from a receiving side.<br>
The RTT(t) indicates a round-trip delay time, and the s indicates a size of a<br>
packet.<br>
When the Round-Trip delay Time (RTT(t)) and the packet loss ratio (P(t))<br>
are given, a general effective transmission rate is estimated by the equation 1.<br>
Namely, in the general method for estimating the transmission rate by using the<br><br>
equation 1, when the packet size (s) is fixed, the estimated transmission rate is<br>
varied according to the Round-Trip delay Time (RTT(t)) and the packet loss ratio<br>
(P(t))-<br>
Figure 1 shows a change in an available transmission rate estimated by<br>
the equation 1 when the packet loss ratio (p(t)) and the packet size (s) are fixed<br>
and the Round-Trip delay Time (RTT(t)) is linearly changed. When the packet loss<br>
ratio is fixed such that p(t)= 0.015 and s = 625 and the Round-Trip delay Time<br>
(RTT(t)) is linearly increased from 80ms to 380ms, the minimum transmission rate<br>
of a user is 50kbps and the maximum transmission rate is 500kbps. As shown in<br>
Figure 1, as the Round-Trip delay Time (RTT(t)) is increased, the estimated<br>
available transmission rate is appropriately decreased.<br>
Figure 2 shows a change in an available transmission rate estimated by<br>
the equation 1 when the Round-Trip delay Time (RTT(t)) and the packet size (s)<br>
are fixed and the packet loss ratio (p(t)) is linearly changed. When the Round-Trip<br>
l|5delay Time (RTT(t)) is fixed to 100ms and the packet size (s) is fixed to 625 and<br>
the packet loss ratio (p(t)) is changed from 0.1% to 20%, the minimum<br>
transmission rate of the user is 50kbps, and the maximum transmission rate is<br>
i<br>
500kbps.<br>
As shown in Figure 2, in the general method for estimating an effective<br>
2jotransmission rate by using the equation 1, it is not considered that a phenomenon<br>
such as time out occurs due to the large packet loss. Accordingly, when the<br>
packet loss ratio is small, the available transmission rate is estimated at an<br>
appropriate value. However, if the packet loss ratio is increased, the available<br>
transmission rate is overestimated. Namely, although the packet loss ratio is 10%<br>
which is considerably large, the available transmission rate is undesirably<br><br>
overestimated at about 200kbps by the general estimation method of the<br>
transmission rate.<br>
Also, the general estimation method of the transmission rate is<br>
disadvantageous in that the network congestion cannot be quickly resolved and<br>
reception quality of multimedia data is degraded because the available<br>
transmission rate is overestimated when the packet loss ratio is large.<br>
US 2002/004841 A1 discloses a method for adjusting the transmission rate of a<br>
multimedia data transmitting apparatus based on a data loss rate indicated in RTCP<br>
receiver report messages fed back from a receiver of the multimedia data. The<br>
transmission rate is Initially set to a given initialisation value. Depending on the<br>
reported data loss rate, the transmission rate is increased, decreased or maintained.<br>
More specifically, if the reported data loss rate is lower than a first threshold value,<br>
the transmission rate is increased. If the data loss rate is larger than a second<br>
threshold value which is greater than the first threshold value, the transmission rate<br>
is decreased. Also, if the data loss rate is reported to lie between the first and second<br>
threshold values, the transmission rate remains unchanged.<br>
D. Slsatem et al., In "The Loss-Delay Based Adjustment Algorithm: A TCA friendly <br>
Adaptation Scheme", Proceedings of NoSSDAV, Cambridge, UK 1998presenta <br>
congestion control mechanism for RTP-based multimedia applications wherein a<br>
sender calculates, on each received RTCP packet from a receiver, a transmission rate<br>
with respect to the receiver in a recursive manner, distinguishing between a no-loss<br>
case and a case of losses being reported. In the no-loss case, the sender Increases<br>
the transmission rate by an increment referred to as an additive increase rate (AIR)<br>
in this article. This additive increment is calculated based on the current transmission<br>
rate, a so-called bottleneck bandwidth indicative of the inter-packet spacing of two<br>
co-travelling packets due to a bottleneck along the transmission route, and a<br>
previous value of the increment In the tossy case, the transmission rate is reduced<br>
proportional to the reported loss factor.<br><br>
The mentioned article also refers to a TCP-throughput model estimating the<br>
throughput of a TCP connection from the maximum packet length, the round trip<br>
time of the connection and the average loss measured during the lifetime of the<br>
connection.<br>
US 2003/103243 Al discloses a method of adjusting a packet sending interval of a<br>
RTP-based communications apparatus so that the transmission rate approximates a<br>
target value.<br>
Principles of RTCP reporting can be found, e.g., in WO 2004/040928 Al.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide an adaptive<br>
estimation method of transmission rate of multimedia data capable of improving<br>
accuracy of an estimated value of an available transmission rate by detecting a<br>
packet loss ratio from a RTCP receiver report packet transmitted from a reception<br>
side and varying an estimation method of an available transmission rate according<br>
to the packet loss ratio.<br>

i(RTCP) receiver report packet from a multimedia data reception unit; detecting a<br>
packet loss ratio from the RTCP receiver report packet; and adaptively estimating<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the<br>
present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying<br>
^drawings.<br>
Figure 3 shows configuration of a general real-time multimedia data<br>
transmission system using a RTP and a RTCP.<br>
As shown, a transmission unit and a reception unit of the general real<br>
time multimedia data transmission system are divided into transport domains and<br>
lpcompression domains (included in an application layer), respectively.<br>
The compression domain of the transmission unit includes a video<br>
encoder which encodes multimedia data according to an estimated transmission<br>
rate; and a video compression unit which compresses the encoded multimedia<br>
data. The transport domain of the transmission unit includes a real-time transport<br>
l|5protocol layer (RTP layer) controlling transport of multimedia data transported<br>
from the video compression unit, a UDP (user datagram protocol) layer and an IP<br>
(internet protocol) layer for transmitting to the reception unit, the multimedia data<br>
transported from the RTP layer, and a transmission rate control unit connected to<br>
the RTP layer, detecting a packet loss ratio from a RTCP receiver report (RR)<br>
2|opacket transmitted from the reception unit, measuring a Round-Trip delay Time<br>
(RTT) by using the RTCP RR packet, estimating a transmission rate by using the<br>
packet loss ratio and the round-trip delay time, and providing the estimated<br>
transmission rate to the video encoder.<br>
The transport domain of the reception unit includes an IP layer and a UDP<br>
layer, a RTP layer controlling transport of multimedia data transmitted from the<br><br>
UDP layer, a service quality monitoring unit monitoring QoS (Quality of Service) of<br>
multimedia data through information included in a header of a RTP packet of the<br>
RTP layer, and a channel report unit for reporting to the transmission unit on<br>
channel information based on the monitored QoS. The channel report unit<br>
{transmits the channel information to the transmission unit through a RTCP RR<br>
packet.<br>
The RTCP RR packet includes a reception report block for feeding back<br>
to the transmission unit, the statistical information of RTP packets transmitted<br>
from the transmission unit. The reception report block further includes a packet<br>
loss ratio and a LSR (last SR timestamp). The LSR indicates a transmission time<br>
of the last RTCP sender report (SR) packet.<br>
The compression layer of the reception unit includes a video decoder<br>
which decodes multimedia data transmitted from the RTP layer.<br>
The multimedia data packet transmitted by the transmission unit of the<br>
l^general multimedia data transmission system having such configuration may be<br>
lost on the Internet or may be abandoned by the reception unit due to excessive<br>
time delay. Other packets arriving in the reception unit on time are transmitted to<br>
the vide decoder through the IP/UDP/RTP layers and then decoded.<br>
The reception unit receives the multimedia data packet and then<br>
2fc)calculates information on a network state such as a packet loss ratio, a delay or<br>
the like through various information existing in a RTP header of the multimedia<br>
data packet, thereby monitoring QoS (Quality of Service). The monitored<br>
information is fed back to the transmission unit through a real-time transport<br>
control protocol (RTCP) of the channel report unit. The transmission unit predicts<br>
2j5an available bandwidth of a current channel by using the information which has<br><br>
been fed back, and the predicted available bandwidth, namely, the available<br>
transmission rate, is transmitted to the video encoder. The video encoder having<br>
received the predicted available transmission rate controls an output encoding<br>
rate of a multimedia data bit stream corresponding to the predicted transmission<br>
rate.<br>
The present invention proposes a new estimation method of a<br>
transmission rate in which the transmission rate is estimated through information<br>
included in a RR packet when a transmission unit receives a RTCP RR packet<br>
from a reception unit in the multimedia data transmission system, while the<br>
method is not against a basic concept of a TCP (transmission control protocol)-<br>
friendly transmission-rate estimation.<br>
In the multimedia data transmission system to which the present invention<br>
is applied, one RTCP packet is transmitted every time a predetermined number of<br>
multimedia data packets of a RTP packet format are transmitted, and the<br>
predetermined number may be 20 as one example.<br>
Figure 4 shows an adaptive estimation method of a transmission rate of<br>
multimedia data.<br>
In the multimedia data transmission system, the transmission unit<br>
transmits multimedia data in RTP packet format to the reception unit (S11).<br>
Here, one RTCP packet is transmitted every time a predetermined number of RTP<br>
packets, for example, 20 RTP packets, are transmitted. Thus, the transmission<br>
unit transmits to the reception unit, one RTCP SR packet every time it transmits<br>
20 RTP packets. The RTCP SR packet includes information related to a<br>
transmission time of the SR packet, namely, a value of a NTP (network time<br>
protocol) time stamp at the time of SR packet transmission.<br><br>
When receiving the RTCP SR packet, the reception unit obtains a<br>
transmission time of the SR packet based on the NTP time stamp value of the<br>
RTCP SR packet, records the obtained transmission time of the SR packet on a<br>
LSR field to generate a RTCP RR packet and transmits the generated RTCP RR<br>
packet to the transmission unit (S13). The RTCP RR packet includes a packet<br>
loss ratio.<br>
The transmission unit having received the RTCP RR packet detects a<br>
packet loss ratio from the RTCP RR packet (S15) and estimates an available<br>
transmission rate (R(tn)) by a calculation method that varies according to the<br>
detected packet ioss ratio as shown in the following equation A.<br><br>
Namely, the transmission unit estimates an available transmission rate (Ri<br>
(tn)) when the detected packet loss ratio does not exceed 5%(t,) 
transmission unit estimates an available transmission rate (R2tn)) when the packet<br>
loss ratio is greater than 5% and smaller than 10% (0.05 <p and the></p>
transmission unit estimates an available transmission rate (R3(tn)) when the packet<br>
loss ratio is not smaller than 10% (p(tn) &gt;.1).<br>
In other words, when the detected packet loss ratio does not exceed 5%<br>
(p(ti) 
(tn)) by the general estimation method using the equation 1.<br><br>
When the detected packet loss ratio is greater than 5% and smaller than<br>
10% (0.05 <p the transmission rate divides size of total data></p>
normally arriving in the reception unit, of 20 RTP packets by a time required to<br>
transmit the 20 packets, thereby estimating the available transmission rate (R2(tn)).<br>
The time required to transmit the 20 RTP packets is calculated by using a<br>
LSR value included in the RTCP RR packet. Namely, the transmission unit<br>
subtracts a LSR value (LSR(tn-1)of a previously-received RTCP RR packet from a<br>
LSR value (LSR(tn)) of the currently-received RTCP RR packet, thereby obtaining<br>
the time required to transmit the 20 RTP packets. Namely, the transmission unit<br>
obtains a transmission time of the nth-transmitted SR packet (SR(tn)) by the LSR<br>
value (LSR(tn)) of the nm-fed back RR packet (RR(tn)) and subtracts a transmission<br>
time of the n-1lh SR packet (SR(tn-1)) from the transmission time of the nth SR<br>
packet (SR(tn)), thereby obtaining a time required to transmit the 20 RTP packets<br>
(LSR(tn)-LSR(tn-l)).<br>
Also, the size of total data having normally arrived in the reception unit is<br>
calculated as follows. The transmission unit checks the number of RTP packets<br>
having been normally transmitted between the transmission time of the n-1th SR<br>
packet (SR(ti-i)) and the transmission time of the nth SR packet (SR(tn)), and<br>
calculates the size of the normally-arriving data by using the checked number of<br>
the normally-transmitted RTP packets. The number of RTP packets having<br>
normally transmitted during an interval between the n-l"1 SR packet (SR(tn-i)) and<br>
the n"1 SR packet (SR(tn)) is s-20-(1-p(t,)). The p(tn) indicates a packet loss ratio<br>
detected from the nm RTCP RR packet, and the s indicates the packet size.<br>
The a and 0 are weighting factors given to allow transmission rates !<br>
estimated by different equations to have continuous values without great<br><br>
differences therebetween when the packet loss ratios are 5% and 10%. The a and<br>
P may be calculated by using the three expressions in equation A when the packet<br>
loss ratio of the RTCP RR packet transmitted from the reception unit is 5% and<br>
the packet loss ratio of the RTCP RR packet is 10%.<br>
Here, if a time required to send the data is constant, the equation for<br>
estimating the available transmission rate (R2(tn)) is defined as a linear expression<br>
with respect to the packet loss ratio p.<br>
If the packet loss ratio detected in the step S15 is not smaller than 10% (p<br>
(tn) &gt; 0.1), the transmission unit estimates the available transmission rate (R3(tn))<br>
at a minimum transmission rate set by a user.<br>
Figure 5 shows transmission rates estimated by a calculation method that<br>
varies corresponding to the magnitude of the packet loss ratio in accordance with<br>
the present invention.<br>
Particularly, in Figure 5, shown are available transmission rates estimated<br>
corresponding to an increase in packet loss ratio p when s=625, RTT=100ms,<br>
and LSR(tn)- LSR(tn-i) = RTT/2 * 20. Here, a=44, (3=395600.<br>
As shown in Figure 5, the available transmission rate estimated by the<br>
equation A is the same as a resulting value of the equation 1 (a resulting value<br>
obtained by the general estimation method of a transmission rate) when the<br>
packet loss ratio does not exceed 5%. When the packet loss ratio is greater than<br>
5% and smaller than 10%, the available transmission rate estimated by the<br>
equation A is lower than the resulting value of the equation 1, and when the<br>
packet loss ratio is not smaller than 10%, the estimated available transmission<br>
rate is the minimum transmission rate input by the user.<br>
Accordingly, in the estimation method of the transmission rate in<br><br>
accordance with the present invention, when the packet loss ratio is large, the<br>
available transmission rate is estimated at a value smaller than an estimated<br>
value obtained by the general estimation method of the transmission rate.<br>
As described so far, in the present invention, a packet loss ratio is<br>
sdetected from a RTCP RR packet transmitted from a reception unit and an<br>
estimation method of an available transmission rate is adaptively selected<br>
according to a range within which the detected packet rate falls into, so that the<br>
available transmission rate is estimated at a smaller value when the packet loss is<br>
large. Accordingly, the network congestion can be quickly resolved and reception<br>
l Equality of multimedia data due to the packet loss can be improved.<br>
As the present invention may be embodied in several forms without<br>
departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof, it should also be<br>
understood that the above-described embodiments are not limited by any of the<br>
details of the foregoing description, unless otherwise specifjed^bjutjather...sJiouJd<br>

second range is a range between 5% and 10%, and the third range is a range of 10% or<br>
more.<br>
3.	The method as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein one RTCP sender report packet is<br>
transmitted and one RTCP receiver report packet is received every time a predetermined<br>
number of RTP packets are transmitted.<br>
4.	The method as claimed in claim 3, wherein the predetermined number of RTP packets<br>
is 20.<br>
5.	The method as claimed in claim 3 or 4, wherein the RTCP receiver report packet<br>
comprises a reception report block for feeding back to a multimedia data transmission<br>
unit, statistical information of RTP packets transmitted from the multimedia data<br>
transmission unit, wherein the reception report block contains a packet loss ratio and a<br>
transmission time of the last RTCP sender report packet.<br><br>
There is disclosed an adaptive estimation method of a multimedia data<br>
transmission rate. A transmission unit of a multimedia data transmission system<br>
transmits multimedia data to a reception unit through a RTP packet (S1 1), the reception<br>
unit transmits state information of a network to the transmission unit through a RTCP<br>
receiver report packet (S13), and the transmission unit detects a packet loss ratio from<br>
the RTCP receiver report packet (S15), and estimates an available transmission rate by a<br>
calculation method that varies according to a range within which the detected packet<br>
loss ratio falls into (S17). Accordingly, the estimation method can speedily resolve<br>
network congestion when the packet loss is large.</td>
