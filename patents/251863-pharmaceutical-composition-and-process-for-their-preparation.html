				<td>The present invention relates to  pharmaceutical  compositions  and process  for their preparation.<br>
The invention relates to novel pharmaceutical compositions of lipase-contalning products for oral administration, in particular pancreattn and pancreatin-containing products, or of enzyme products containing at least one lipase of non-animal, especially microbial origin, in which the pharmaceutical compositions provide improved lipolytic activity, in particular a stabilisation of the lipase in the acidic pH range. These novel pharmaceutical compositions are characterised in that they contain a system which comprises at least one surfactant and one co-surfactant, and that they are self-emulsifiable on contact with a hydrophilic and a lipophilic phase. These novel pharmaceutical compositions are well suited for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of maldigestion, in particular maldigestion based on chronic exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, in mammals and humans.<br>
.Maldigestion in mammals and humans is usually based on a deficiency of digestive enzymes, in particular on a deficiency of endogenous lipase, but also of protease and/or amylase. The cause of such a deficiency of digestive enzymes is frequently a hypofunction of the pancreas 
Substitution with similarly acting exogenous digestive enzymes or mixtures of di-gestive enzymes has proved effective treatment for a deficiency in endogenous digestive enzymes. Most frequently, pharmaceutical preparations {= preparations) which contain porcine pancreatin (= pancreatin) are nowadays used for this purpose. Such<br>
mlxtures of digestive enzymes obtained from the pig pancreas comprise lipases, amy-lases and proteases, and can be used effectively for enzyme substitution therapy in humans owing to the great similarity of the enzymes and accompanying substances contained therein to the contents of human pancreatic juices. For example, processes are described in German patent applications DE 25 12 746 and DE 42 03 315 by which pancreatin is obtained as a natural enzyme mixture by extraction from porcine pancreas and subsequently is converted in a known manner into the desired pharmaceuti-cal form. The pancreatic enzymes are usually administered orally in the form of solid preparations. Thus pancreatin is commercially available for example under the trade<br>
name Kreon® in the form of granules, pellets or capsules with enteric-coated mlcropel-lets.<br>
In order that, when taken orally, the administered enzyme mixtures are not irre-versibly denatured in the stomach by gastric acid and proteolytic enzymes, such as pepsin present there, it is necessary to provide the enzyme mixtures with an enteric coating. Such a coating enables the intact enzyme mixtures to pass through the stomach as far as their point of action, the duodenum, where, owing to the neutral to slightly afkaline conditions prevailing there, the proiective layer is broken down and the enzymes are released. Like the endogenous pancreatic enzymes of healthy humans, the orally supplied enzymes can exert their enzymatic action, in particular amylolytic, lipolytic and proteolytic activity, there. Such solid pancreatin formulations which can be coated with an enteric film are described e.g. in EP O 021 129 A1.<br>
EP O 583 726 A1 describes pancreatin micropellet cores coatable with an enteric film having a pancreatin content of 65-85, in particular 75-80% by weight, which have a bulk density of 0.6 g/ml to 0.85 g/ml, consisting substantially of pancreatin, polyethyl-ene glycol 4000 and low-viscosity paraffin, containing per 100 parts by weight pancreatin: 15-50, in particular 20-30, parts by weight polyethylene glycol 4000; and 1.5-5, in particular 2-3, parts by weight low-viscosity paraffin, and having a spherical to ellip-soid form, the sphere diameter or the minor axis being in the range of 0.7-1.4 mm, in particular 0.8-1.2 mm, and having a particle-size distribution in which at least 80% of the pancreatin micropellet cores have a ratio of minor axis to major axis in the range of 1:1 to 1:2.<br>
Furthermore, EP O 826 375 A1 describes the use of leclthln as a stabilising agent added to water-soluble pharmaceutical preparations of mixtures of digestive enzymes which contain protease/lipase mixtures, in particular pancreatin, and which are suitable for the preparation of aqueous solutions for continuous introduction into the gastroin-testinal tract by means of probes. The lecithin is added to stabilise the mixtures of digestive enzymes against a decrease in the lipolytic activity under the influence of mois-ture.<br>
In the case of medicament formulations not coated with enteric films, it is known that at the point of action of the enzymes, in the duodenum, often only a very small proportion of the lipase contained in the pharmaceutical preparation and taken therewith is active. Thus in DE 36 42 853 A1 such enzyme deactivation is ascribed to insufficient neutralisation of the gastric acid in the duodenum. Whereas in a healthy human the postprandial intraduodenal pH value is about 6, patients with pancreatic insufficiency only have a pH value of 4. At this pH value, the lipase contained in the pharmaceutical preparation has only one fifth of the activity that it would otherwise have at a pH value of 6.<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to make pharmaceutical compositions available which cqntain enzymes or enzyme mixtures with at least lipolytic activity and have improved lipolytic activity and in particular show a stabilisation of the activity of the lipase in the acidic pH range.<br>
According to the invention, pharmaceutical compositions intended for oral ad-ministration are provided which comprise enzymes or enzyme mixtures with at least lipolytic activity and a system comprising at least one surfactant and at least one co-surfactant, and are characterized in that tney can themselves be emulsified on contact with a hydrophilic phase and a lipophilic phase. Preferably the hydrophilic phase used to form the final ernulsion after ingestion of the pharmaceutical composition is supplied by the physiological fluid of the digestive milieu. In a further embodiment of the present invention, the lipophilic phase used to form the final emulsion in the digestive tract after ingestion of the pharmaceutical composition is at least partially supplied by the iipids present in the food ingested. In particular, to achieve this object the invention provides pharmaceutical compositions which contain systems which comprise at least one surfactant, one co-surfactant and a lipophilic phase.<br>
Surprisingly, a lipase-containing pharmaceutical composition containing such a system has improved lipolytic activHy and a lipolytic activity which is stabilised in the acidic pH range. The use of such a system in pharmaceutical compositions of enzymes or enzyme mixtures with at least lipolytic activity furthermore has the advantage that pharmaceutical compositions containing such enzymes or enzyme mixtures can also be used without enteric coatings, such as are described for example in EP O 583 726 Al In the pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention the reduction in the lipolytic activity during passage through the stomach is very much less than with pharmaceutical compositions prepared without the aforementioned system. By means of the system consisting of surfactant, co-surfactant and optionally a lipophilic phase, the lipolytic activity of the pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention is stabilised in the acidic pH range of the stomach compared with convenţional formulations.<br>
The fact that the use of such enteric-coated polymer films and softeners which are otherwise necessary for film-coating various medicament forms (granules, pellets, mini-tablets, tablets etc.) can be dispensed with in the preparation of the lipase-containing compositions according to the invention yieids further advantages. Thus the safety profite of the pharmaceutical composition is improved by omitting the enteric polymer films and softeners, since unnecessary taking thereof is avoided. Furţhermore, the proportions of the amount of film-coating material in the medicament forms pro-vided with an enteric film is approx. 20-30% of the entire weight of the medicament form. Dispensing with these additives makes the amount of medicament form to be taken smaller, which results in better acceptance by the patients.<br>
The possibility of dispensing with enteric coating of the enzymes or enzyme mixtures furthermore has the advantage that thorough mixing of the pharmaceutical preparation with the chyme can take place as earty as in the stomach. Thereupon, there forms an emulsion or micro-emulsion with enlarged surface, on which the lipase con-tained In the pharmaceutical composition is distributed such that it îs given optimum possibilities for attack for breaking down the triglycerides found in the chyme. The for-mation of emulsion and microemulsion is further intensified by the lipolytic breakdown of the triglycerides to form di- and monoglycerides and free fatty acids. Thus the improved possibilities of attack for the lipase result in intensified breakdown of the triglycerides. The hlgher concentration of free fatty acids resulting from the food which is thus<br>
provlded results In better făt absorption in the duodenum. In vitro, an increase in the lipolytic activity by about 10% compared with convenţional lipase-containing pharmaceutical preparations was determined for the pharmaceutical composition according to the invention. The pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention thus exhibit stabilisation of the lipolytic activity in the stomach as well as in the duodenum; addi-tionally, owing to the intensifled formation of a (micro)emulsion, the lipolytic activity is increased. The (micro)emulsion already produced independentiy in the stomach results in better activation of the lipase contained in the pharmaceutical composition.<br>
Self-emulsifying pharmaceutical compositions in general are already known from the prior art. Thus, for example, EP O 670 715 describes a perorally administered composition which is suitable for forming a microemulsion in situ with the biologica! liquid of the organism and thus is said to improve the biologica! availability of an active substance. Such pharmaceutical compositions are known under the term SMEDDS® (Seif Microemulsifying Drug Delivery System) and consist in principie of a mixture of one or more active substances with a defined lipophilic phase, a defined surfactant and a de-fined co-surfactant, the properties of which are specified such that the end product is capable of forming a microemulsion on contact with a given volume of physiological liquid.<br>
Furthermore, EP 1 058 540 B1 describes what is called a SMEDDS® formulation in a particular pharmaceutical form, which is referred to as "pellef. These pellets are composed of an active substance, in particular indomethacin, a binding agent which is suitable for improving the biologica! availability of the active substance, for example Gelucire* 44/14, and a diluent, for example lactose, in micronised form.<br>
The object of the systems known hitherto from the prior art which automatically form a microemulsion was however always to increase the bioavailability of mostly lipophilic active substances in that the SMEDDS® formulation, owing to the micelle formation, permits better absorption of the active substance through the duodenal wall into the blood circulation. In contrast, the aim of the present invention is to provide a pharmaceutical composition which does not contain any lipophilic active substances to be absorbed înto the bloodstream, but provides as active agent enzymes or enzyme mixtures with at least lipolytic activity which develop their action in the gastrointestinal tract. The self-emulsifiable pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention<br>
result In a surprislng increase of the llpolytlc activity contalned thereln and In an im-proved stability of the lipase in the acidic pH ranga. Such pharmaceutical compositions of lipase-containing enzyme products which are self-emulsifiable on contact with a hy-drophillc phase and which comprise a system consisting of a surfactant, a co-surfactant and optionally a lipophllic phase have not been described hitherto In the prior art.<br>
Subramanian and Wasan describe an assay in which they demonstrate that the substance Geluclre® 44/14 in vitro has an inhibiting effect on the pancreatic lipase activity [Subramanian R. &amp; Wasan K.M. (2003) "Effect of lipid excipients on in vitro pancreatic lipase activity" Drug Dev. Ind. Pharm. 29(8): 885-90]. In this experiment, a particular lipid-containing assay buffer with separate solutions of Gelucire9 44/14, pancreatic lipase and co-lipase is mixed, and the influence of Gelucire® on the lipase activity is measured. Since the lipase activity decreases, the authors conclude that Gelucire® and similar lipidic additions to pharmaceutical formulations can have an adverse effect on the in vitro activity of the pancreatic lipase. In contrast, the present invention shows that self-emulsifiable pharmaceutical compositions consisting of lipase-containing enzyme mixtures and a system such as for example Gelucire0 44/14 result in an increase in the lipolytic activity contained in the pharmaceutical formulation.<br>
Some expressions as used in the context of the present invention are explained in more detail below.<br>
The "hvdroDhilic-lipophilic balance" (= HLB) value is an empirica! parameter commonly used to characterize the relative hydrophilicity and lipophilicity of non-ionic amphiphilic compounds is the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (the "HLB" value). Surfac-tants or co-surfactants with lower HLB values are more lipophilic, and have greater solubility in oils, whereas surfactants or co-surfactants with higher HLB values are more hydrophilic, and have greater solubility in aqueous solutions. It should be kept in mind, that for anionic, cationic, or zwitterionic compounds the HLB scale is not gener-ally applicable.<br>
Generally, the HLB value of a surfactant or co-surfactants is a practicai guide used to enable formulation of industrial, pharmaceutical and cosmetic emulsions. How-ever, for many important surfactants, including severa! polyethoxylated surfactants, it has been reported that HLB values can differ by as much as about 8 HLB units, de-<br>
pending upon the empirical method chosen to determine the HLB value [Schott, J. Pharm. Sciences, 79(1), 87-88 (1990)]. Likewise, for certain polypropylene oxide con-taining block copolymers (poloxamers), the HLB values may not accurately reflect the true physlcal chemical nature of the compounds. Finally, commercial surfactant and/or co-surfactant products are generally not pure compounds, but are often complex mix-tures of compounds, and the HLB value reported for a particular compound may more accurately be characteristic of the commercial product of which the compound is a major component. Different commercial products having the same primary surfactant and/or co-surfactant component can, and typically do, have different HLB values. In addition, a certain amount of lot-to-lot variability is expected even for a single commercial surfactant and/or co-surfactant product.<br>
A surfactant in the context of the present invention is a chemical compound com-prising two groups, the first being hydrophilic and/or polar or ionic and having a high affinity for water, and the second containing an aliphatic chain of greater or lesser length and being hydrophobic (lipophilic); i.e., a surfactant compound must be amphi-philic. These chemical compounds are intended to căuşe the formation and stabilisa-tion of oil-in-water emulsions. Surfactants with lower HLB values are more lipophilic, and have greater solubility in oils, whereas surfactants with higher HLB values are more hydrophilic, and have greater solubility in aqueous solutions. Suitable surfactants in the context of the present invention have an HLB value above 6 and below 18, pref-erably above 8 and below 16. Surfactants can be any surfactant suitable for use in pharmaceutical compositions. Suitable surfactants can be anionic, cationic, zwitterionic or non-ionic.

Complete Systems composed of surfactant. co-surfactant and lipophilic phase<br>
Several commercial surfactant and/or co-surfactant compositions contain small to moderate amounts of di- and triglycerides, typically as a result of incomplete reaction of a triglyceride starting material in, for example, a transesterification reaction. Such commercial surfactant and/or co-surfactant compositions, while nominally referred to as "surfactants" and/or "co-surfactant", may be suitable to provide - in addition to the surfactant and/or co-surfactant part of the system - all or part of the lipophilic component, i.e. the di- and triglyceride component, for the compositions of the present invention.<br>

•	as co-surfactant a mixture of mono-acylglycerides with aliphatic saturated<br>
and/or unsaturated C16-C2o carboxylic acids, preferably with oleic and/or li-<br>
noleic acid, and<br>
•	a lipophilic phase of di- and/or triacylglycerides with aliphatic Cie-Cao carbox<br>
ylic acids, preferably with oleic and/or linoleic acid.<br>
As a commercially available mixture of mono-, di- and triacylglycerides with aliphatic saturated and/or unsaturated C19-C20 carboxylic acids Maisine® (Gattefosse) can be used.<br>
Preferably, said pharmaceutical composition is characterised in that the system comprises 2 to 10%, preferably 5%, by weight lysophosphatidylchollne, 28 to 51% by weight mono-acylglycerides mainly of oleic acid and linoleic acid, and 36 to 54% by weight di-acylglycerides and 4 to 20% by weight tri-acylglycerides mainly of oleic acid and linoleic acid, whereby the system consisting of suriactant, co-surfactant and the lipophilic phase together makes up 10% to 30%, preferably 20%, by weight of the pharmaceutical composition.<br>
For the pharmaceutical preparations according to the invention, preferably solid orally administered dosage forms may be selected, for example powders, pellets, granules, tablets, or microspheres, which if desired may be filled into capsules or sa-chets or may be compressed to form tablets. Granules are preferably produced by melt granulation. Tablets are usually made from the powder or the melt granules. Pellets can be produced either by exploiting the thermoplastic properties of the auxiliaries in a heavy-duty mixer (melt pelletisation) or by tradiţional methods e.g. extrusion (e.g. melt extrusion or wet extrusion) and spheronisation. If individual enzyme types are present and are obtained separately, such as a lipase, a protease or an amylase from microbial origin, these may in this case be present together or spatially separated from each other. If the individual enzymes are not spatially separated from each other, dry proc-essing and/or storage is preferred. The pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention, which are self-emulsifiable on contact with a hydrophilic phase and optionally a lipophilic phase, con-tain enzymes or enzyme mixtures with at least lipolytic activity as active substance. In a preferred variant of the present invention, the enzymes or enzyme mixtures may how-<br>
ever, in addition to the llpolytic activity, also have proteolytlc activlty, i.e. contain at least one protease, and/or amylolytic activity, i.e. contain at least one amylase.<br>
In one preferred variant of the present invention, the lipolytic activity of the enzymes or enzyme mixtures is provided by a microbial lipase.<br>
In another embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition contains enzymes or enzyme mixtures whlch are pancreatin and/or pancreatin-like, preferably pancreatin-containing mixtures of digestive enzymes. Preferably, the pancreatin and/or pancreatin-like mixtures of digestive enzymes make up 65 — 85%, in particular 75 - 80% by weight, of the pharmaceutical composition.<br>
Alternatively, the enzyme mixtura used is a mixture of at least one microbial lipase and one or more microbial enzymes from the group of proteases and amylases is used as enzyme mixture.<br>
In one variant of the invention, the enzyme mixture used is purely of microbial origin. Examples of such physiologically acceptable bacteria! and/or fungal enzymes have already been described in the prior art, together with procedures how to obtain these enzymes and with their use for the treatment of maldigestjpn. For example such synthetic mixtures of lipase, protease and amylase, each of which are microbially ob-tained, and also pharmaceutical preparations containing these mixtures are described in internaţional patent application WO 02/060474 and patent application EP O 828 509.<br>
Preferably, the pharmaceutical composition contains microbial enzymes making up 5 - 80%, in particular 20 - 60% by weight, of the pharmaceutical composition.<br>
In the context of the invention, most preferred are those mixtures of digestive enzymes with lipolytic, proteolytic and amylolytic activity, the properties of which are close to those of pancreatin. Pancreatin-containing mixtures of digestive enzymes and also in particular pancreatin itself are therefore preferred in the context of the present invention as disclosed above. However it is possible to add to the pancreatin or the pancreatin-containing mixtures of digestive enzymes if desired one or more microbial enzymes, i.e. lipases, proteases and/or amylases obtained from microbial sources.<br>
Suitable microbial enzymes for the sole use as enzyme mixtura or even as addition to pancreatin or the pancreatin-containing mixtures of digestive enzymes are in particular bacteria! or fungal enzymes, such as from the species Bacillus or Pseudomonas, or from fungal cultures, such as from the species Aspergillus, Humicola or Rhizomucor. Preferably, the microbial enzymes, in particular the microbial lipase, are recombinantly produced. In a further preferred variant of the present invention the microbial lipase is a lipase variant or a mutated lipase.<br>
The present invention furthermore relates to the use of a system comprising<br>
•	at least one surfactant,<br>

for stabilising the lipolytic activity in the acidic pH range and/or for improving the lipolytic activity of solid pharmaceutical preparations containing enzymes or enzyme mixtures with at least lipolytic activity, preferably pancreatin or pancreatin-like mixtures of digestive enzymes.<br>
The possible further configurations of the system to be used, consisting of surfactant, co-surfactant and lipophilic phase, correspond to the embodiments aiready men-tioned for the self-emulsifiable pharmaceutical preparation according to the invention, which comprises such a system.<br>
The invention also relates to a process for the preparation of solid pharmaceutical preparations containing enzymes or enzyme mixtures with at least lipolytic and optionally also proteolytic and/or amylolytic activity, preferably pancreatin and/or pancreatin-like mixtures of digestive enzymes.

The following examples are intended to explain the invention further, but without limiting its scope:<br>
Example 1:<br>
Preparation of pancreatin-containing compositions according to the invention and com-parison of the lipoiytic activity of a usual pancreatin formulation and a pancreatin formu-lation according to the invention comprising a system consisting of a surfactant, co-surfactant and lipophilic phase<br>
a)	Usual preparation (pellets) not according to the invention:<br>
The usual formulation was prepgred according to the process disclosed in patent speci-fication EP O 583 726. 120 g pancreatin and 30 g PEG 4000 were initially dry-mixed and then moistened with 20 g isopropanol. The moist mixture was extruded and then rounded in a suitable rounder with the aid of paraffin oii. The pellets produced were then dried.<br>
b)	Preparation according to the invention (pellets) (Example 1 A)<br>
350 g Gelucire® 50/13 was melted in a beaker in a water bath at a temperature of 52°C. The molton mass was mixed with 650 g pancreatin in a dual-jacket mixer for 10 min. The homogenous mixture was placed in a melt extruder for extrusion. Then the extrudate was rounded in a suitable rounder or spheroniser. The pellets obtained hâd a diameter of 1.0-1.6 mm.<br>
c) Preparation accordlno to the invention (granules) (Exemple 300 g Gelucire* 44/14 was melted in a beaker in a water bath at a temperatura of 48°C. The molten mass was mixed with 700 g pancreatin in a dual-jacket mixer for approx. 15 min. and then cooled (melt granulation).<br>
The determination of the activity of the lipase as a function of the pH value and also the time-dependent change in lipase activity was performeri in accordance with the method of the "Federation Internationale Phatmaceutique/European Pharma-copeia" (abbreviated hereafter to FIP/Ph.Eur.). With this standard analysis method, the hydrolytic activity of the lipase in the sample to be investigated is determined with the substrate olive oii. The free fatty acids cleaved off from the triglycerides of the olive oii are titrated with sodium hydroxide solution at a constant pH of 9.0. The lipase activity of the sample is determined by the comparison of the rate at which the sample hydrolyses an olive oi) ernulsion with the rate at which a suspension of a standard pancreas refer-ence powder hydrolyses the same substrate under the same conditions.<br>
The absolute and relative lipolytic activity of the usual preparation and the preparation according to the invention (pellets) determined in each case in accordance with FIP/Ph.Eur. are summarised in Table 1 . The absolute and relative lipolytic activity of the usual preparation and the preparation according to the invention (granules) determined in each case in accordance with FIP/Ph.Eur. are summarised in Table 2:<br>
Table 1: Absolute and relative lipolytic activity of the standard preparation and the preparation according to the invention (pellets with Gelucire" 50/13)<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Table 2: Absolute and relative llpolytic activity of the standard preparation and the preparation according to the irwention (granules with Gelucire*44/14)<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
It becomes clear from the data that the addition of systems comprising at least one surfactant, at least one co-surfactant and a lipophilic phase to pharmaceutical preparations of enzymes and enzyme mixtures with at least lipolytic activity, preferably pancreatin and/or pancreatin-like mixtures of digestive enzymes, contributes to im-proved lipolytic activity compared with usual formulations of pancreatin known in the state of the ari<br>
The absolute lipolytic activity of the respective pharmaceutical preparation deter-mined in accordance with FIP/Ph.Eur. is expressed with reference to the total lipolytic activity theoretically present in the sample in the form of a relative activity, in order to take account of the different concentrations of pancreatin in the formulations. Compari-son of the relative lipase activities determined shows that the relative lipase activity of the preparations according to the invention is approximately 10% higher than those of the usual formulations. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical preparations according to the invention have increased lipolytic activity compared with usual formulations of pancreatin.<br>
Furthermore, with reference to the value of the relative lipase activity of the preparation according to the invention of more than 100%, it becomes clear that there is an activation effect of the lipase by the system consisting of surfactant, co-surfactant and optionally lipophilic phase added to the preparations according to the invention.<br>
Example 2<br>
Comparison of the stability of lipolytic activity of a usual pancreatin formulation and a pancreatin formulation according to the invention comprising a system consisting of a surfactant, co-surfactant and lipophilic phase at different pH values<br>
In order to compare the stablllty of llpolytlc activity of a usual pancreatin formula-tion and a pharmaceutical formulation according to the Invention comprising an enzyme mixture with at least lipolytic activity and a system consisting of at least one surfactant, at least one co-surfactant, and a lipophilic phase, the activity of such a usual pancreatin formulation was compared with the activity of a mixture of Gelucire® and pancreatin incubated for up to 2 hours at different pH values (pH 6, pH 5 and pH 4).<br>
a)	Standard preparation foellets):<br>
The usual formulation was prepared according to the process disclosed in patent speci-fication EP O 583 726. 120 g pancreatin and 30 g PEG 4000 were initially dry-mixed and then moistened with 20 g isopropanol. The moist mixture was extruded and then rounded in a suitable rounder and with the aid of paraffin oii. The pellets produced were then dried.<br>
b)	Preparation according to the invention (pellets) - Exemple 2<br>
300 g Gelucire® 44/14 was melted in a beaker in a water bath at a temperatura of 48°C. The molten mass was mixed with 700 g pancreatin in a dual-casing high-speed mixer (melt pelletisation).<br>
The determination of the activity of the lipase as a function of the pH value and also the time-dependent change in lipase activity takes place in accordance with the method of the FIP/Ph.Eur. as described above.<br>
To determine the release behaviour of the lipase at different pH values in the usual preparation and the preparation according to the invention, the samples were incubated in a decomposition apparatus for 2 hours at 37°C in phosphate buffer solu-tion (pH 6, pH 5, pH 4). At intervals of 15 minutes, samples were taken and the lipolytic activity in the samples was determined in accordance with the FIP/Ph.Eur. method described above.<br>
600 ml buffer (67 mM phosphate, 34 mM NaCI, pH 6.0, pH 5.0, pH 4.0) was heated to a constant temperature of 37°C in a 1 l beaker in the decomposition tester. Once the constant temperature hâd been reached, 2 g of sample was added to the beaker and the decomposition tester was set moving. The pH value of the phosphate buffer was kept constant during the testing time. At intervals of 15 minutes in each<br><br>
case, samples were taken and the lipolytic activity In the samples was determined in accordance with FIP/Ph.Eur.<br>
The relative lipolytic activity determined after 15, 30,45, 60, 75, 90,105 and 120 minutes of the usual preparation and the preparation according to the invention in accordance with FIP/Ph.Eur. are summarised in Table 3 below; details are cjiven in % of the activity of the respective sample compared with a standard pancress reference powder in accordance with FIP/Ph.Eur.<br>
Table 3: pH-dependency of the relative lipolytic activity of a usual pancreatin formulation and a pancreatin preparation according to the invention<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
It can be seen from these data that the addition of systems compri-sing at least one surfactant, at least one co-surfactant, and a lipophilic phase to phsrmaceutical preparations of enzymes and enzyme mixtures with at least lipolytic activity, preferably pancreatin and/or pancreatin-like mixtures of digestive enzymes, contributes to stabilis-ing the lipolytic activity in the acidic pH range. At a pH vaiue of 6, comparison of the lipolytic activity of a usual pancreatin preparation and a pancreatin preparation according to the invention over a tlme of 120 minutes shows that the lipolytic acstivity in both preparation forms over time decreases only relatively slightly, with the lipolytic activity of the preparation according to the invention increased by approximatehy 10% compared with the usual formulation again being observed within the first hour. However, a pH value of 6 is known not to have any great influence on the lipolytic activity. On the other hand, at a pH value of 5 the lipolytic activity of the usual preparatio n is reduced very much more quickly compared with the preparation according to the invention. Whereas the preparation according to the invention has (ost less than 10% of the lipolytic activity after 90 minutes, the usual preparation has only a lipolytic activity of<br>
less than 70% remalning compared with a pancreas reference powder in accordance with FIP/Ph.Eur. In particular at a pH value of 4, the preparation according to the inven-tion has a markedly greater lipolytic (residual) activity than the usual preparation. Ao cordingly, the pharmaceutical preparations according to the invention have a substan-tially increased lipolytic activity in the acidîc pH medium.<br>

Dosage dependence of a pancreatin formulation according to the invention comprising a system consisting of a surfactant, co-surfactant and lipophilic phase on digestibility of a high lat diet in the Pancreatic exocrine insufficient mlnipig<br>
The efficacy of a pelleted pharmaceutical formulation according to the invention comprising an enzyme mixture with at least lipolytic activity and a system consisting of at least one surfactant, at least one co-surfactant, and a lipophilic phase to improve digestion and absorption of făt in minipigs, in which the pancreatic duet has been ligated to induce a complete pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, was analysed in these pigs fed a high (32%) făt diet.<br>
a) Preparation accordinq to the invention (pellets)<br>
250 g Gelucire® 44/14 (Gattefosse) was melted in a beaker in a water bath at a temperatura of 48°C. The molten mass was mixed with 750 g pancreatin in a dual-casing high-speed mixer (melt pelletisation). The pellet size of this formulation was similar to thatofthe marketed pancreatin product.<br>
Determination of the activitv of lipase<br>
Studies were performed in 6 minipigs (Ellegaard, female Gottingen minipigs) with induced pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, weighing 20-30 kg at surgery. The pigs were prepared as previously described (Tabeling R, Gregory P, Kamphues J. 1999: Studies on nutrient digestibilities (pre-caecal and total) in pancreatic duct-ligated pigs and the effects of enzyme substitution. J. Anim. Physiol. a. Anim. Nutr. 82, 251-263] under halothane anaesthesia; following a mid-line laparotomy; the pancreatic duet was ligated after which the pigs were chronically fitted with an ileo-caecal re-entrant fistula which was exteriorized on the right flank.<br>
The success of the pancreatic duet ligatlon was conflrmed (faecal chymotrypsin test) before starting the digestibility studies, which began at least 4 weeks after the pigs hâd recovered from the surgery.<br>
The pigs were fed two 250 g meals/day (08.00 and 20.00h) of a high făt diet (containing: 180g double-milled Altromin 9021 [modified], 70 g soya oii [Roth]; overall contents are 99% dry matter, 4% crude ash, 32% crude făt, 16% crude protein, 28% starch, 3 % crude fibre) plus 0.625 g Cr2O3 per meal, mixed with 1 litre water. The meals plus enzymes were carefully mixed together immedlately before offering to the pigs. The meals were generally consumed within 5 minutes.<br>
During the study the pigs received 0, 28.000 or 336.000 FIP ţipase units per meal as a formulation according to the invention for 14 days, with a complete collection of faeces for the last 5 days. The faeces (and the feed) were frozen at -20°C, freeze dried, and a Weender analysis was performed [Naumann C, Bassler R. 1993: Die chemische Untersuchung von Futtermitteln. 3. Aufl. VDLUFA-Verlag, Darmstadt] to determine content of dry matter (drying at 103°C for 8h), and crude făt (determined gravimetrically after boiling for 30 min with conc. HCI, foilowed by a 6h extraction with petrol ether), while Cr203 was oxidized to chromate and chromium content was calcu-lated via extinction at 365 nm [Petry H, Rapp W. 1970: Zur Problematik der Chro-moxidbestimmung in Verdauungsversuchen. Z. Tierphysiol. Tieremâhrung und Futter-mitellkunde 27, 181-189].<br>
The content of făt and chromium determined per 100 g dry matter feed and faeces (see above) allowed calculation of the digestibility of făt (CFA) according to the formula: The efficacy to improve digestion and absorption of făt in minipigs, in which the pancreatic duet has been ligated to induce a complete pancreatic exocrine insuffi-ciency, measured in the % făt digestibility is given for the preparation according to the invention for different amounts of lipase activity added (given in FIP/Ph.Eur. units).<br>

From these data it can be concluded that the addition of systems comprising at least one surfactant, at least one co-surfactant, and a lipophilic phase to pharmaceuti-cal preparations of enzymes and enzyme mixtures with at least lipolytic activity, pref-erably pancreatin and/or pancreatin-like mixtures of digestive enzymes, contributes to stabilising the lipolytic activity in the acidic pH range.<br>
Example 5<br>
Determinatlon of the lipolytic activity of a formulation according to the invention comprising a lipase of microblal origin and a system consisting of a surfactant, co-surfactant and lipophilic phase and determination of stability at different pH values<br>
In order to determine the lipolytic activity and to show the improved stability at acidic pH of a pharmaceutical formulation according to the invention comprising an enzyme mixtura with at least lipolytic activity, whereby the lipolytic activity is provided by a microbial, optionally recombinantly produced lipase, and a system consisting of at least one surfactant, at least one co-surfactant, and a lipophilic phase, the activity of a pharmaceutical formulation consisting of a mixture of Gelucire™ and a microbial lipase is determined at different pH values (pH 6, pH 5, pH 4 and 3) and compared to a not stabilized lipase preparation.<br>
a) Preparation according to the invention (granulate)<br>
562.5 g Gelucire® 44/14 was melted in a beaker in a water bath at a temperatura of 48°C. 937.5 g of a microbial lipase preparation (the active lipase protein representing about 50 to 60% (w/w) of the dry matter of the preparation) were provided in a dual-<br><br>
jacket mixer at 46°C, then the molton Gelucfre was added and the compounds were mixed in a first step at low speed for 3 min, then for approx. 15 min. at high speed and finally cooled (melt granulation).<br>
b) Preparation for comoarison (not according to the Invention)<br>
A microbial lipase preparation was prepared by using common spray dry technique.<br>
Determination of the activity of the lipase was performed in accordance with the method of the "Federation Internationale Pharmaceutique" (abbreviated hereafter to FIP) for microbial lipases, except that the concentration of bile salts is 10 mM..<br>
With this standard analysis method, the hydrolytic activity of the lipase in the sample to be investigated is determined using olive oii as substrate. Released free fatty acids are titrated with sodium hydroxide solution at a constant pH of 7.0. The lipase activity of the sample is determined by comparison of the rate at which the sample hy-drolyses an olive oii emulsion with the rate at which a suspension of a microbial lipase reference powder hydrolyses the same substrate under the same conditions.<br>
To determine the pH-stability of the lipase at different pH values in an unstabi-lized preparation and in the preparation according to the invention, the samples were incubated in a decomposition apparatus for 2 hours at 37°C in buffer solution (pH 5, pH 4 and pH 3). At intervals of 15 minutes, samples were taken and the lipolytic activity in the samples was determined in accordance with the FIP method.<br>
100 mg of lipase were incubated in 100 ml buffer (0.1 M malonic acid buffer, 1 mM calcium chioride pH 3,4 and 5) at 37°C. Samples were drawn every 15 min for a total duration of 2 hours and the lipolytic activity of the samples was determined as follows: An olive oii suspension was prepared by mixîng 175 g olive oii with 630 ml of a solution of 700 g of gum arabic and 94.4 g calcium chioride di-hydrate in 5,900 ml wa-ter for 15 minutes in a food mixer at maximal speed. The emulsion was cooled to 37°C and the pH adjusted to pH 6.8 with sodium hydroxide solution. Three reference solu-tions were prepared by extracting an appropriate amount of FIP microbial lipase standard with an ice-cold 1% (m/v) solution of sodium chioride such that reference solutions with 50 FlP-U/ml, 65 FlP-U/ml and 80 FlP-U/ml were obtained. Sample solutions were prepared by extracting an amount of sample corresponding to app. 6,500 units activity<br>
for 15 minutes with a total of 100 ml Ice-cold 1% (m/v) solutlon of sodium chioride. The samples were further diluted in ice-cold 1% (m/v) solution of sodium chioride such that the titration rate was within the range of the titration rates obtained with the reference solutions.<br>
The titration rates of the reference and sample solutions were determined by combining in a thermostated vessel 19 ml of olive oii suspension with 10 ml of a solution of 492 mg llpase activating mixtura (PIP) in 500 ml of water. The combined solutions were thermostated to 37°C and the pH adjusted to pH 7.0. One ml of reference solution or sample solution were added and the released fatty acids titrated under pH stable conditions with 0.1 M sodium hydroxide solution for a duration of 5 minutes. The titration rate was calculated by linear regression from at least d measurement points between the 60th and the SOOth second of titration.<br>
From the titration rates of the reference solutions a calibration function was calculated by linear regression. The calibration function takes the form y = mx + b where y: titration rate; m: slope; x: FlP-units of the reference solution; and b: axis intercept. Us-ing the values thus determined for m and b, the lipolytic activity x was calculated for each sample solution using the formula x = (y-b) / m.<br>
The relative lipolytic activity determined after O, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105 and 120 minutes of an unstabilized microbial lipase preparation and the preparation accord-ing to the invention in accordance with FIP are determined. A comparison of the results obtained can show the improved lipolytic activity and the increased stability within the acidic pH range of the formulation according to the invention comprising a microbial lipase preparation over the unstabilized lipase preparation.<br><br><br><br><br>
