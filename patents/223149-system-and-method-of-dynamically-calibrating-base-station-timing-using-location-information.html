Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates in general to wireless communications systems and, in particular, to system and method for dynamically calibrating base station timing.<br>
Description of Related Art and General Background<br>
Calibrating and maintaining proper timing is an important concem in communication systems. This is particularly true in wireless communications operating under Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) schemes. CDMA is a digital radiofrequency (RF) channelization technique, defined in Telecommunications Industry Association/Electronics Industries Association Interim Standard-95 (TIA/EIA IS-95), entitled "MOBILE STATION-BASE STATION COMPATIBILITY STANDARD FOR DUAL-MODEWIDEBAND SPREAD SPECTRUM CELLULAR SYSTEM", published in 1993. Other aspects of CDMA communication systems are defined in well-known standards, such as, for example, TIA/EIA IS-97, TIA/EIA IS-98, cdmaOne, cdma2000, and wideband CDMA (WCDMA) standards.<br>
Wireless communication systems employing CDMA technologies assign a unique code to communication signals and apply pseudorandom noise(PN) modulation to spread these communication signals across a common wideband spread spectrum bandwidth. In particular, the communication signals are modulated with PN sequences to spread the signals over a wide bandwidth. CDMA systems employ two short PN code sequences (i. e., "I" and "Q") and one long PN code sequence. The short PN codes are used for quadrature spreading and have unique offsets serving as<br><br>
identifiers for a cell or a sector. At the WD 110 receiver, the received spread spectrum signal is despread in order to recover the original data. As long as the WD 110 receiver has the correct code^ it can successfully detect and select its communication signal from the other signals concurrently transmitted over the same bandwidth. The encoding/decoding, modulation/demodulation, and spreading/despreading processes depend on accurate timing for synchronization and proper system operation.<br>
FIG. 1 (Prior Art) illustrates a simplified block diagram of CDMA wireless communication system 100. System 100 allows mobile station or wireless communication device(WD) 110 to communicate with an Interworking Function(IWF) 108 via a base station (BS) 106. ThelWF 108 serves as a gateway between the wireless network and other networks, such as the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) and wireline packet data networks providing Intemet-or Intranet-based access. WD 110 communicates with BS 106, which is associated with a geographic cell or sector, via the wireless interface Um on the reverse link transmission path. BS 106 is configured to process the communication signals from WD 110.<br>
On the forward link transmission path, BS 106 communicates with WD 110 via the wireless interface Um. During forward link transmissions, each BS 106 is capable of transmitting information-bearing signals as well as control signals, such as pilot signals.<br>
Pilot signals are used to identify the BS 106 best suited to accommodate reverse link transmissions. Pilot signals also provide a time and coherent phase reference to enable WD 110 to obtain initial system synchronization and facilitate coherent demodulation on the forward link. All pilot signals are subjected to the same PN spreading code but with a different code phase offsets to enable WD 110 to distinguish between different pilot signals, thereby identifying the originating BS 106.<br><br>
As noted above, proper CDMA system 100 operation requires accurate timing. For example, in accordance with IS-95 and IS-97 standards, each BS 106 is required to use a time base reference from which all time-sensitive transmission components, including pilot PN code sequences and frames, are to be derived. Each BS 106 time base reference is required to be synchronized to CDMA system time. Benefits of synchronized BSs 106 include, for example, improved hand-off speed and reliability, enhanced initial system acquisition (i. e., cell search) speed, increased handset (e. g.WD 110) stand-by time, and improved reliability and power economy due to common channel hand-off operations.<br>
CDMA system time may employ a Global Positioning System (GPS) time base, which may be synchronized with a Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) reference. GPS and UTC may differ by up to a few seconds to compensate for the number of leap year seconds corrections added to UTC since January 6,1980. BSs 106 are further required to radiate pilot PN code sequences within3 us of CDMA System Time and all CDMA channels radiated by BSs 106 are required to be within+l, us of each other. The rate of change for timing corrections may not exceed 1/8 PN chip (101.725 ns) per 200 ms.<br>
Moreover, in accordance with IS-95 and IS-98 standards, each WD 110 is required to use a time base reference used to derive timing for the transmit chip, symbol, frame slot, and system time. During steady-state conditions, each WD 110 is also required to have a timing reference within+1, us of the time of the earliest arriving multipath component being used for demodulation, as measured at the WD 110 antenna connector. In addition, if WD 110 time reference correction is needed, then it is to be<br><br>
corrected no faster than 1/4 PN chip (203.451 ns) in any 200 ms period and no slower than3/8 PN chip (305.18 ns) per second.<br>
These stringent timing requirements are necessary because of the interdependence between BS 106and WD 110 timing. FIG. 2 illustrates the timing relationship at various points within system 100. The start of CDMA System Time is January 6, 1980,00: 00: 00 UTC, which corresponds to the start of GPS time, indicated as GPS time stamp zero (GPS TS-0). Because, as noted above, each BS 106 time base reference is to be synchronized to CDMA system time, GPS provides an absolute time reference and each BS 106 transmission includes a GPS time stamp. For convenience, GPS TS-0 will be used heretofore to demonstrate the timing relationships between BS 106and WD 110.<br>
As indicated in FIG. 2, the interval denoted by reference numeralAl, demonstrates the trailing portions of the PN codes sequences conveyed by the pilot signals transmitted by BS 106 during forward link transmissions, prior to the start of CDMA System Time. The notation 0 (') denotes a portion of the PN code sequences, which comprise n consecutive zeros. The initial state of the long PN code sequence is configured with a " 1" at the most significant bit (MSB), followed by 41 consecutive "0"s. Similarly, the initial state for both, the I and Q short PN code sequences are configured with a "1" at the MSB, followed by 15 consecutive "0"s.<br>
Interval A2 demonstrates the beginning portions of the pilot PN codes sequences transmitted by BS 106 to WD 110 at GPS TS-0. It is to be noted that BS 106 is synchronized with the absolute time reference provided by GPS in order to transmit pilot signals at exactly 2 second intervals (i. e., even second marks). Even second marks are generally divided into twenty-five 80 ms. periods for CDMA frame boundary timing.<br><br>
Moreover, for the Paging Channel, Forward Traffic Channel, Reverse Traffic Channel, and Access Channel, the 80 ms. period is divided into four 20 ms. frames. For the Sync Channel, the 80 ms. period is divided into three -26. 66 ms. frames. The pilot PN sequence repeats every ^26. 66 ms. and the =26. 66 ms. frame boundaries coincide with the pilot PN sequence rollover points, which are offset in the forward CDMA channel to identify the transmitting sector of BS 106.<br>
Interval B3 indicates the reception, by WD 110, of the pilot PN code sequences after a one-way forward link transmission delay (A/,). The forward link transmission delay A/^ may include delays attributable to the line-of-sight (LOS) propagation delay (Aios) between BS 106 and WD 110, as well as BS 106 and WD 110 processing and hardware delays (A^/, A^/, respectively) associated with processing the forward link transmissions.<br>
Interval C3 indicates that WD 110 aligns the timing of the reverse link transmissions with the timing of the received forward link transmissions. This may be achieved by taking into account the well-known forward link processing and hardware delays A^y of WD 110, the well-known reverse link processing and hardware delays A^/ of WD 110, and compensating for the delays by advancing the timing of the reverse link transmissions to correspond to the forward link timing at the antenna connector of WD 110.<br>
Finally, interval D4 indicates the reception, by BS 106, of the reverse link signals conveyed by WD 110, after a one-way reverse link transmission delay(A^/). The reverse link transmission delay AH may include delays attributable to the line-of-sight (LOS) propagation dQ\ay{Aios) between BS 106 and WD 110, as well as BS 106 and WD 110 processing and hardware delays(A^^, A^^, respectively) associated with processing the reverse link transmissions.<br><br>
As noted above, the forward and reverse link WD 110 hardware/processing delays A^/, A^;- are generally well-known and stable. In order to ensure that such delays are accounted for, WD 110 may be specifically calibrated in advance for such purposes. However, unlike A^/, A^^^, BS 106 forward and reverse link hardware/processing delays A/,/, Ai,^ are subject to change and may be difficult to measure. BSs 106 are not configured identically and, depending on traffic statistics, urban densities, frequent RF tuning, and system resources, each BS 106 may be equipped with a variety of system components, each of which have their own delay characteristics. Unless these delays are calibrated and compensated for, there is no certainty that signals at selected reference points have the requisite timing.<br>
Considerable effort and human resources are required to determine and calibrate the delays due to BS 106 components. In many cases, services may be shut down and numerous technicians may be tasked to adequately assess and effect such calibrations.<br>
Moreover, BSs 106 are frequently being modified and upgraded to provide better service or compensate for faulty equipment. Because each component, as noted above, manifests certain delay characteristics, each modification, whether it be a new cable, a new component, or antenna repositioning, requires there-assessment and recalibration of BS 106 delays.<br>
Clearly, BS 106 delay determination and calibration is time and task intensive, requiring substantial economic and manpower resources. Accordingly, what is needed is a system and method for dynamically calibrating base station timing.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention addresses the need identified above by providing a novel system and method capable of dynamically calibrating base station timing.<br>
System and methods consistent with the principles of the present invention as embodied and broadly described herein include a base station for transmitting, receiving, and processing communication signals and a wireless communication device for communicating with the base station. The wireless communication device is configured to determine its location, to detect an arrival time of a first signal transmitted from the base station, and to calculate a line-of-sight delay corresponding to a line-of-sight distance between the wireless communication device and the base station. The line-of-sight distance is based on the base station location information and the wireless communication device location information. The base station measures a round trip delay corresponding to a delay incurred by the first signal and a delay incurred by a second signal transmitted from the wireless communication device back to the base station in response to the first signal. The base station then determines a base station timing calibration error based on the line-of-sight delay, the first signal arrival time, and the round trip delay, and dynamically calibrates the base station timing to compensate for the base station timing calibration error.

FIG. 3A is a simplified functional block diagram of CDMA communications system 300, constructed and operative in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. System 300 comprises BS 106 and WD 110 and is capable of determining the location of a WD 110 and the exact time of day by employing GPS functionality. Such capabilities are well known. For example, one well-known technique includes a GPS-equipped WD 110, which measures the ranges to a plurality of GPS satellites 310A-310B having known locations at the time the measurements are made. Other techniques employ a combination of GPS functionality and a plurality of BSs 106 to triangulate the location of WD 110. Still other techniques for identifying the location of WD 110 have been disclosed, for example, in U. S. Patent Application Nos. 6,058,338 and 6,081,229, commonly owned by the assignee of the present application and herein incorporated by reference.<br>
As indicated in FIG. 3A,WD 110 comprises antenna subsystem llOA for transmitting CDMA signals to, and receiving CDMA signals from, BS 106. Antenna subsystem 11OA is coupled to an antenna connector 11 OB, which serves as the reference point from which WD 110<br><br>
delays are measured. Antenna connectorl 1 OB is coupled to a Radio Frequency (RF) subsection HOC, which is, in turn coupled to an Intermediate Frequency (IF) subsection HOD. As illustrated in FIG. 3A, along the receive path, RF subsection HOC is configured to down-convert the CDMARF signals received from antenna subsystem llOA and supply the down-converted signals to IF subsection HOD. Conversely, along the transmit path, RF subsection 11OC is configured to up-con vert the IF signals received from IF subsection HOD and supply the up-converted signals to antenna subsystem 1 lOA for transmission.<br>
IF subsection 11OD is coupled to microprocessor 11OE, which processes the received IF signals to extract payload information as well as formatting the payload information in a form suitable for IF subsection HOD. Microprocessor HOE is also coupled to a GPS receiverllOF, configured to receive absolute timing information from GFSs 310A-310C in order to determine the exact location of WD 110, as noted above. It will be appreciated that subsections HOC, HOD and GPS receiver 11 OF may include demodulators, power control devices, filters, deinterleavers, decoders, time/frequency units, and other conventional circuitry that, for the purposes of illustration, have been omitted.<br>
During forward link transmissions, the aggregate forward link WD 110 processing/hardware delay incurred by the respective components along the transmit path is denoted as A^y: Similarly, during reverse link transmissions, the aggregate reverse link WD 110 processing/hardware delay incurred by the respective components along the receive path is denoted as A^r- WD 110 forward and reverse link delays A^f, ^wr are known and are typically compensated for. As noted above, WDs 110 may be specifically calibrated in advance to ensure proper WD 110 operation.<br><br>
Because WDs 110 are user-end devices, requiring very little in the way of modifications due to system upgrades, delays A^f, A^^ are generally stable.<br>
BS 106 comprises antenna subsystem 106A for transmitting CDMA signals to, and receiving CDMA signals from,WD 110. Antenna subsystem 106A is coupled to an antenna connector 106B, which serves as the reference point from which BS 106 delays are measured. As illustrated in FIG. 3A, along the receive path, RF subsection 106C is configured to down-convert the CDMA RF signals received from antenna subsystem 106A and supply the down-converted signals to IF subsection 106D. Conversely, along the transmit path, RF subsection 106C is configured to up-convert the IF signals received from IF subsection 106D and supply the up-converted signals to antenna subsystem 106A for transmission.<br>
IF subsection 106D is coupled to microprocessor 106E, which processes the received IF signals to extract payload information as well as formatting the payload information in a form suitable for IF subsection 106D. Microprocessor 106E is also coupled to a GPS receiver 106F, configured to receive absolute timing information from GPSs 310A to 3IOC in order to generate timing and frequency references for proper CDMA system operation. It will be appreciated that subsections 106C, 106D and GPS receiver 106F may include demodulators, power control devices, filters, deinterleavers, decoders,time/frequency units, and other conventional circuitry that, for the purposes of illustration, have been omitted. Furthermore, BS 106 may include additional functionality to assist in determining the position of WD 110 (i. e.. Position Determination Entity (PDE) server mechanism).<br>
During forward link transmissions, the aggregate forward link BS 106 processing/hardware delay incurred by the respective components along the transmit path is denoted as A^/. Similarly, during reverse link<br><br>
transmissions, the aggregate reverse link BS 106 processing/hardware delay incurred by the respective components along the receive path is denoted as<br>
FIG. 3B illustrates the relationships between the various delays encountered in system 300. As noted above, system 300 is capable of determining the location of WD 110 (i. e. ,Xi, &gt;^^, and z^ coordinates). The location of the antenna radiating center of BS 106 (i. e., x^, yt, and Zfj coordinates) is also known. Therefore, as indicated in FIG. 3B, the LOS distance(duos) between WD 110 and BS 106 may be determined by equation (1) :<br><br>
where c is the speed of light (i. e. - 3 x 108 m/sec).<br>
As noted above, during forward link transmissions, BS 106 transmits a pilot signal to WD 110, which provides a timing reference. By virtue of its ability to determine its own location and exact time of day, WD 110 is capable of determining A/,o5 information. In addition, as indicated in FIG. 2, WD 110 exploits the well-known WD 110 forward link hardware/processing delays /)^/ to align the reverse link transmissions with the forward link transmissions. Therefore, as indicated by FIG. 3B, the oneway forward link transmission delays A/&gt; detected by WD 110, which represents the total delay encountered in the forward link between BS 106 and WD 110 may be determined by equation (3):<br><br><br>
where: A^/ represents the forward link WD 110 hardware/processing delay, Solos represents the LOS delay, and A^y represents the BS 106 forward link hardware/processing delays due to calibration error. As will be described below, WD 110 is capable of measuring the forward link transmission delay A/^ and, by virtue of knowing the WD 110 forward link hardware/processing delays A^y^ and A/,o^? it is possible to determine, via equation (3), the value of the BS 106 forward link hardware/processing delays A^y:<br>
It is to be noted that, as indicated by FIG. 3B, the one-way reverse link transmission delay (A;.,), which captures the total delay encountered during the reverse link between WD 110 and BS 106, may be represented by equation (4):<br><br>
where: A^;^ represents the reverse link WD 110 hardware/processing delay, /S^ios represents the LOS delay, and A/,;, represents the BS 106 reverse link calibration error due to BS 106 hardware/processing delays.<br>
BS 106 is capable of measuring the round trip delay (RTD) encountered by a signal communicated from BS 106 to WD 110 and back to BS 106. In particular, RTD encompasses the delay associated with a signal transmitted from BS 106 to WD 110 and the delay associated with a signal transmitted from WD 110 back to BS 106, in response to the signal received from BS 106. It is to be noted that, as shown in FIG. 2,WD 110 aligns the transmission time of its reverse link transmissions with the arrival time of the received forward link transmissions.<br>
As indicated in FIG. 3B, RTD may be determined by the sum of the oneway forward link delay Ay? and the one-way reverse link delay A^.,. Thus, combining equation (3) with equation (4), yields:<br><br><br>
where BTF represents a back-to-the-future counter configured to compensate for WD 110 hardware/processing delays A^/and A^^.<br>
Taking into account the reasonable assumption that the well delays A^^, Ay^&gt;r are adequately compensated for by the back-to-future counter BTF, equation (5) simplifies to:<br>
thus, equation (7) reveals that the ditterence between the measured RTD and twice the Aios, is the BS 106 calibration error due to the combined forward and reverse link BS 106hardware/processing delays A/,/, A^;-. As noted above, by measuring the forward link delay4 and employing equation (3), it is possible to determine the base station forward link processing delay A^y; Thus, to ensure the proper timing of system 300, requires adequately determining forward and reverse link BS 106 calibration errors At/, Atn and calibrating BS 106 to compensate for such delays. Conventionally, forward and reverse link BS 106 hardware/processing delays A^/, A^^, are determined by physically measuring these delays, at the expense of system resources. However, as noted above, the BS 106 forward link hardware/processing delays A/,/may be determined by measuring the forward link delay A^, factoring in the known values for the WD 110 forward link hardware/processing delays A^/ and, Aios and using equation (3) to solve for A^/.<br><br>
Moreover, as noted above, BS 106 is synchronized with the absolute time reference provided by GPS satellites 310A-310D in order to transmit pilot signals with rollover points that correspond to the =26. 66 ms. frame boundaries. In addition, the signals received by WD 110 may be time stamped with the absolute time reference provided by GPS satellites 310A-310D so as to identify when the signals were received. Thus, the arrival time of pilot signals (Xarr) are known. Furthermore, because pilot signals are initiated by BS 106 during forward link transmissions, pilot signal arrival times Xarr are functions of the forward link delays, in accordance with equation (3). Specifically,<br><br>
Because the pilot signal arrival time the forward link WD 110 hardware/processing delay A^/, and the LOS delay H^^LOS are known at WD 110, the forward link BS 106 calibration error A^y^ may be calculated, as indicated by equation (9):<br><br>
Therefore, the forward link BS 106 calibration error A^/ may be determined by detecting the pilot signal arrival time x^^ and subtracting from it the known forward link WD 110 hardware/processing delay A^/and the LOS delay I^LOS- AS such, during forward link calibrations, BS 106 may be calibrated by first determining the forward link BS 106 calibration error A^/based on equation (9) and then compensating for error A^/ by adjusting the transmission processing time of a transmitted signal, accordingly.<br>
Moreover, because the measured RTD is a function of both, the forward link BS  106 calibration error A^y and the reverse link BS 106<br><br>
calibration error A^^, in view of the above, reverse link calibration error A/,/ may also be determined. In particular, rewriting equation (7) to include the calculated forward link BS 106 calibration error A/,/set forth by equation (9) yields:<br>
RTD - 2 ALOS  = (Tarr " Kf ' ^LOs) + A,,	(10)<br>
Solving for the reverse link BS 106 calibration error A^,^ yields :<br>
A^, = RTD - 2 Ai^oS - (Xarr - A^/ - Alos)<br>
= RTD + A^f-T^-A,os	(11)<br>
Therefore, the reverse link BS  106 calibration error A^r may be<br>
determined subtracting from the measured RTD and known forward link WD 110 hardware/processing delay A^fi the known pilot signal arrival time Tarr and the known LOS delay Aios. As such, during reverse link calibrations, BS 106 may be calibrated by measuring both, RTD and pilot arrival time Xarr and then calculating the reverse link BS 106 calibration error A^^. based on equation (11).<br>
FIG. 3C is a flowchart illustrating process 350, constructed and operative in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. Process 350 is configured to calibrate BS 106, based on WD 110 and BS 106 location information.<br>
As indicated in block B355, process 350 determines the location of WD 110 as well as the exact time of day. As noted above, the location of WD 110 may be determined by well-known means, such as, for example, equipping WD 110 with GPS functionality.<br>
In block B360, process 350 determines LOS delay Aios incurred by a signal propagating between BS 106 and WD 110. As noted above in equations (1) and (2), LOS delay Aios is a function of the distanced dLos between the BS 106 antenna radiating center location (i. e., x^, y^, and Z^ coordinates) and the WDl 10 location (i. e., x^, y^, and Z^ coordinates).<br><br>
In block B365, process 350 detects the WD 110 arrival time tarr of a pilot signal transmitted by BS 106. The pilot signal arrival time Xgrr is identified by WD 110 via the absolute time reference information provided by GPS satellites 310A-310D.<br>
In block B370, process 350 measures the RTD encompassing the delay incurred by a first signal transmitted from BS 106 to WD 110 and the delay incurred by a second signal transmitted from WD 110 back to BS 106, in response to the first signal.<br>
In block B375, process 350 determines the forward BS timing calibration error A^/ based on hios and Xarr- Specifically, process 350 determines the forward BS timing calibration error A/,/ in accordance with equation (9). Accordingly, in block B380, process 350 calibrates BS 106 by adjusting the transmission processing time of forward link transmissions in order to compensate for the forward BS timing calibration error A^/.<br>
In block B385, process 350 determines the reverse BS timing calibration error A/,/, based on A^/, ^ios, and Tarr* Specifically, process 350 determines the reverse BS timing calibration error A^/, in accordance with equation (11). Accordingly, in block B385, process 350 calibrates BS 106 by adjusting the receive processing time of reverse link transmissions in order to compensate for the reverse BS timing calibration error A^^-<br>
The foregoing description of the preferred embodiments is provided to enable any person skilled in the art to make or use the present invention. Various modifications to these embodiments are possible, and the generic principles presented herein may be applied to other embodiments as well. For example, certain base stations may lack access to an absolute time reference. In such cases, the base station delays due to the forward link<br><br>
calibration error may contain an additional time offset, representative of the difference between the base station internal clock and an external absolute time reference. By simply combining the forward link calibration error and additional time offset, the base station timing may still be calibrated in accordance with the above described embodiments.<br>
Moreover, the invention may be implemented in part or in whole as a hardwired circuit, as a circuit configuration fabricated into an application-specific integrated circuit, or as a firmware program loaded into nonvolatile storage or a software program loaded from or into a data storage medium as machine-readable code, such code being instructions executable by an array of logic elements such as a microprocessor or other digital signal processing unit.<br>
As such, the present invention is not intended to be limited to the embodiments shown above but rather is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and novel features disclosed in any fashion herein.<br><br><br><br>
