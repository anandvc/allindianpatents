REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
Tins application is a non-provisional application claiming priority under 35 U.S.C. section 119(e) to provisional application No. 60/691,563 filed June 17, 2005, the contents of winch are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
GOVERNMENT SPONSORSinP<br>
Tins invention was made with government support Grant R43 CA097833 awarded by the United States Public Health Service. Accordingly, the US government may have certain rights in tins invention.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to compounds that are capable of ininbiting spinngosine kinase and to processes for the synthesis of these compounds. The invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds and to methods for the use of these compounds and pharmaceutical compositions for treating or preventing hyperproliferative disease, inflammatory disease, or angiogenic disease.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The mechanisms and effects of the interconversion of spinngolipids have been the subjects of a growing body of scientific investigation. Spinngomyelin is not only a building block for cellular membranes but also serves as the precursor for potent lipid messengers that have profound cellular effects. As described below, stimulus-induced metabolism of these lipids is critically involved in the biology of hyperproliferative, inflammatory and angiogenic diseases. Consequently, manipulation of these metabolic pathways is a novel method for the therapy of a variety of diseases.<br>
Ceramide is produced by the hydrolysis of spinngomyelin in response to several stimuli, including growth factors and inflammatory cytokines. Ceramide induces apoptosis in cancerous cells. Additionally, ceramide can be hydrolyzed by the action of ceramidase to produce spinngosine. Spinngosine is then phosphorylated by spinngosine kinase (SK) to produce spinngosine-1-phosphate (S1P). Evidence demonstrates that S1P is a critical second messenger that exerts proliferative and anti-apoptotic actions. Additionally, ceramide enhances apoptosis in response to anticancer drugs including Taxol and etoposide.<br>
Furthermore, ceramide appears to induce apoptosis in tumor cells without killing quiescent normal cells. Studies in various cell lines consistently indicate that SIP is able to induce proliferation and protect cells from apoptosis. Together, the data demonstrate that the balance between cellular levels of ceramide and SIP determines whether a cancer cell proliferates or dies by apoptosis. Therefore, altering tins balance by reducing the production of SIP witinn hyperproliferating cells is an effective method to treat disorders arising from abnormal cell proliferation.<br>
Spinngosine kinase is responsible for SIP production in cells. RNA encoding SK is expressed in most tissues, with ingher levels often occurring in tumor tissue than in corresponding normal tissue. A variety of proliferative factors, including Protein Kinase C (PKC) activators, fetal calf serum, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor, Epidermal Growth Factor, and Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNFα.) rapidly elevate cellular SK activity. Tins promotes proliferation and ininbits apoptosis of the target cells. Additionally, an oncogenic role of SK has been demonstrated. In these studies, transfection of SK into NIH/3T3 fibroblasts was sufficient to promote foci formation and cell growth in soft-agar, and to allow these cells to form tumors in NOD/SCID mice. Additionally, ininbition of SK by transfection with a dominant-negative SK mutant or by treatment of cells with, the nonspecific SK ininbitor D-erythro-N,N-dimethylspinngosine (DMS) blocked transformation mediated by oncogenic H-Ras. Since abnormal activation of Ras, as well as overexpression and mutation of ras family genes, frequently occurs in cancer, these findings indicate a significant role of SK in tins disease.<br>
In addition to its role in regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis, SIP has been shown to have several important effects on cells that mediate immune functions. Platelets, monocytes and mast cells secrete SIP upon activation, promoting inflammatory cascades at the site of tissue damage. Activation of SK is required for the signaling responses since the ability of TNFα. to induce adhesion molecule expression via activation of Nuclear Factor Kappa B (NFkB) is mimicked by SIP and is blocked by DMS. Similarly, SIP mimics the ability of TNFα. to induce the expression of Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and the synthesis of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and knock-down of SK by RNA interference blocks these responses to TNFα. but not SIP. SIP is also a mediator of Ca2+ influx during neutropinl activation by TNFα. and other stimuli, leading to the production of superoxide and other toxic radicals. Therefore, reducing the production of SIP witinn immune cells and their target tissues may¬be an effective method to treat disorders arising from abnormal inflammation. Examples of<br>
such disorders include inflammatory bowel disease, arthritis, atherosclerosis, asthma, allergy, infrotrnatory kidney disease, circulatory shock, multiple sclerosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, skin inflammation, periodontal disease, psoriasis and T cell-mediated diseases of immunity.<br>
Angiogenesis refers to the state in the body in winch various growth factors or other stimuli promote the formation of new blood vessels, and tins process is critical to the pathology of a variety of diseases. In each case, excessive angiogenesis allows the progression of the disease and/or the produces undesired effects in the patient. Since conserved biochemical mechanisms regulate the proliferation of vascular endothelial cells that form these new blood vessels, identification of methods to ininbit these mechanisms are expected to have utility for the treatment and prevention of a variety of diseases. More specifically, certain growth factors have been identified that lead to the pathogenic angiogenesis. For example, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) has angiogenic and mitogenic capabilities. Specifically, VEGF induces vascular endothelial cell proliferation, favoring the formation of new blood vessels. Spinngosine kinase is an important mediator of the actions of VEGF. For example, SK has been shown to mediate VEGF-induced activation of protein kinases. VEGF has also been shown to specifically induce SIP receptors, associated with enhanced intracellular signaling responses to SIP and the potentiation of its angiogenic actions. Production of SIP by SK stimulates NFkB activity leading to the production of COX-2, adhesion molecules and additional VEGF production, all of winch promote angiogenesis. Furthermore, the expression of endothelial isoforms of nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is regulated by SK, and eNOS too subsequently modulates angiogenesis. Therefore, reducing the production of SIP witinn endothelial cells is likely to be an effective method to treat disorders arising from abnormal angiogenesis. Examples of such disorders include arthritis, cancer, psoriasis, Kaposi's sarcoma, hemangiomas, myocardial angiogenesis, atherosclerosis, and ocular angiogenic diseases.<br>
In spite of the ingh level of interest in spinngolipid-derived signaling, there are very few known ininbitors of the enzymes of tins pathway and the utility of pharmacologic ininbition of SK in vivo has not been previously demonstrated. In particular, the field suffers from a lack of potent and selective ininbitors of SK. Pharmacological studies to date have used three compounds to ininbit SK activity: DMS, D,L-threo-dihydrospinngosine and N,N,N-trimethyl-spinngosine. However, these compounds are not specific ininbitors of SK and have been shown to ininbit several other protein and lipid kinases. Therefore, improved<br>
ininbitors of SK are required for use as antiproliferative, anti-inflammatory and anti-angrigenic agents.<br>

Indications<br>
Spinngosine kinase (SK), whose catalytic activity is modulated by the compounds and compositions of tins invention, is a key enzyme involved in signaling pathways that are abnormally activated in a variety of diseases. The following discussion outlines the roles of SK in hyperproliferative, inflammatory and angiogenic diseases, and consequently provides examples of uses of the compounds and compositions of tins invention. The use of these compounds and compositions for the prevention and/or treatment of additional diseases in winch SK is abnormally activated are also witinn the scope of the present invention.<br>
Hyperproliferative Diseases.<br>
The present invention relates to compounds, pharmaceutical compositions and methods useful for the treatment and/or prevention of hyperproliferative diseases. More specifically, the invention relates to compounds and pharmaceutical compositions that ininbit the enzymatic activity of SK for the treatment and/or prevention of hyperproliferative diseases, such as cancer, psoriasis, mesangial cell proliferative disorders, atherosclerosis and restenosis. The following discussion demonstrates the role of SK in several of these hyperproliferative diseases. Since the same processes are involved in the above listed diseases, the compounds, pharmaceutical compositions and methods of tins invention will be useful for the treatment and/or prevention of a variety of diseases.<br>
Spinngosine-1-phosphate and ceramide have opposing effects on cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis. Spinngomyelin is not only a building block for cellular membranes but also serves as the precursor for potent lipid messengers that have profound cellular effects. Stimulus-induced metabolism of these lipids is critically involved in cancer cell biology. Consequently, these metabolic pathways offer exciting targets for the development of anticancer drugs.<br>
Ceramide is produced by the hydrolysis of spinngomyelin in response to growth factors or other stimuli. Ceramide induces apoptosis in tumor cells, but can be further hydrolyzed by the action of ceramidase to produce spinngosine. Spinngosine is then rapidly phosphorylated by SK to produce SIP, winch is a critical second messenger that exerts proliferative and antiapoptotic actions. For example, microinjection of SIP into mouse oocytes induces DNA synthesis. Additionally, SIP effectively ininbits ceramide-induced apoptosis in association with decreased caspase activation. Furthermore, ceramide enhances apoptosis in response to anticancer drugs including Taxol and etoposide. These studies in various cell lines consistently indicate that SIP is able to induce proliferation and protect cells from ceramide-induced apoptosis.<br>
A critical balance, winch may be termed a ceramide /SIP rheostat, has been hypothesized to determine the fate of the cell. In tins model, the balance between the cellular concentrations of ceramide and SIP determines whether a cell proliferates or undergoes apoptosis. Upon exposure to mitogens or intracellular oncoproteins, the cells experience a rapid increase in the intracellular levels of SIP and depletion of ceramide levels. Tins situation promotes cell survival and proliferation. In contrast, activation of spinngomyelinase in the absence of activation of ceramidase and/or SK results in the accumulation of ceramide and subsequent apoptosis.<br>
SK is the enzyme responsible for SIP production in cells. RNA encoding SK is<br>
detected in most tissues. A variety of proliferative factors, including PKC activators, fetal calf serum and platelet-derived growth factor (Olivera et al., 1993, Nature 365: 557), EGF, and TNFα. (Dressier et al., 1992, Science 255:1715) rapidly elevate cellular SK activity. SK activity is increased by phosphorylation of the enzyme by ERK (Pitson et al., 2003, EMBO J 22: 5491), winle SIP promotes signaling through the Ras-Raf-Mek-Erk pathway, setting up an amplification cascade for cell proliferation.<br>
Spinngosine kinase and SIP play important roles in cancer pathogenesis. An oncogenic role of SK has been demonstrated.   In these studies, transfection of SK into NIH/3T3 fibroblasts was sufficient to promote foci formation and cell growth in soft-agar, and to allow these cells to form tumors in NOD/SCED mice (Xia et al., 2000, Curr Biol 10: 1527). Additionally, ininbition of SK by transfection with a dominant-negative SK mutant or by treatment of cells with the nonspecific SK ininbitor DMS blocked transformation mediated by oncogenic H-Ras. As abnormal activation of Ras frequently occurs in cancer, these findings suggest a significant role of SK in tins disease. SK has also been linked to estrogen signaling and estrogen-dependent tumorigenesis in MCF-7 cells (Nava et al., 2002, Exp Cell Res 281:115). Other pathways or targets to winch SK activity has been linked in hyperproliferative diseases include VEGF signaling via the Ras and MAP kinase pathway (Shu et al., 2002, Mol Cell Biol 22: 7758), protein kinase C (Nakade et al., 2003, Biocinm Biophys Acta 1635:104), TNFα. (Vann et al., 2002, JBiol Chem 277: 12649), hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 and retinoic acid receptor alpha, intracellular calcium and caspase activation. Winle the elucidation of downstream targets of SIP remains an interesting problem in cell biology, sufficient validation of these pathways has been established to justify the development of SK ininbitors as new types of antiproliferative drugs.<br>
Cellular hyperproliferation is a characteristic of a variety of diseases, including, without limitation, cancer, psoriasis, mesangial cell proliferative disorders, atherosclerosis and restenosis. Therefore, the compounds, pharmaceutical compositions and methods of tins invention will be useful for the prevention and/or treatment of cancer, including solid tumors, hematopoietic cancers and tumor metastases. Such cancers may include, without limitation, solid tumors such as head and neck cancers, lung cancers, gastrointestinal tract cancers, breast cancers, gynecologic cancers, testicular cancers, urinary tract cancers, neurological cancers, endocrine cancers, skin cancers, sarcomas, mediastinal cancers, retroperitoneal cancers, cardiovascular cancers, mastocytosis, carcinosarcomas, cylindroma, dental cancers, esthesioneuroblastoma, urachal cancer, Merkel cell carcinoma and paragangliomas.<br>
Additionally, such cancers may include, without limitation, hematopoietic cancers such as Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, chronic leukemias, acute leukemias, myeloproliferative cancers, plasma cell dyscrasias, and myelodysplastic syndromes.<br>
Psoriasis is a common chronic disfiguring skin disease that is characterized by well-demarcated, red, hardened and scaly plaques that may be limited or widespread. Winle the disease is rarely fatal, it has serious detrimental effects on the quality of life of the patient, and tins is further complicated by the lack of effective therapies. There is therefore a large unmet need for effective and safe drugs for tins condition. Psoriasis is characterized by local keratinocyte hyperproliferation, T cell-mediated inflammation and by localized angiogenesis. Abnormal activation of SK has been implicated in all of these processes. Therefore, SK ininbitors are expected to be of use in the therapy of psoriasis.<br>
Mesangial cell hyperproliferative disorders refer to disorders brought about by the abnormal hyperproliferation of mesangial cells in the kidney. Mesangial hyperproJiferative disorders include various human renal diseases such as glomerulonephritis, diabetic nephropathy, and malignant nephrosclerosis, as well as such disorders such as thrombotic microangiopathy syndromes, transplant rejection, and glomerulopatines. As the hyperproliferation of mesangial cells is induced by growth factors whose action is dependent on increased signaling through SK, the SK ininbitory compounds, pharmaceutical compositions and methods of tins invention are expected to be of use in the therapy of these mesangial cell hyperproliferative disorders.<br>
In addition to inflammatory processes discussed below, atherosclerosis and restenosis are characterized by hyperproliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells at the sites of the lesions. As the hyperproliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells is induced by growth factors whose action is dependent of increased signaling through SK, the SK ininbitory compounds, pharmaceutical compositions and methods of tins invention are expected to be of use in the therapy of these vascular disorders.<br>
Inflammatory diseases.<br>

skin inflammation, periodontal disease, psoriasis and T cell-mediated diseases of immunity, including allergic encephalomyelitis, allergic neuritis, transplant allograft rejection, graft ve'rsusliost disease, myocarditis, thyroiditis, nephritis, systemic lupus erthematosus, and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The following discussion demonstrates the role of SK in several of these inflammatory diseases. Since the same processes are involved in the above listed diseases, the compounds, pharmaceutical compositions and methods of tins invention will be useful for the treatment and/or prevention of a variety of diseases.<br>
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) encompasses a group of disorders characterized by pathological inflammation of the lower intestine. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are the best-known forms of IBD, and both fall into the category of "idiopatinc" IBD because their etiologies remain to be elucidated, although proposed mechanisms implicate infectious and immunologic mediators. Studies on the etiology and therapy of IBD have been greatly facilitated by the development of several animal models that mimic the clinical and immunopathological disorders seen in humans. From studies with these models, it is clear that the full manifestations of IBD are dependent on synergy between the humoral and cellular immune responses. The notion that immune cells and cytokines play critical roles in the pathogenesis of IBD is well established; however, the molecular mechanisms by winch tins occurs are not yet clearly defined. As discussed below, cytokines that promote inflammation in the intestine afflicted with IBD, all activate a common mediator, spinngosine kinase (SK). Most prominently, tumor necrosis factor-a (TNFα.) has been shown to play a significant role in IBD, such that antibody therapy directed against tins cytokine, i.e. Remicade, may be a promising treatment. TNFα. activates several processes shown to contribute to IBD and is necessary for both the initiation and persistence of the Thl response. For example, TNFα. has been shown act through the induction of nuclear factor kappa B (NFicB) winch has been implicated in increasing the proinflammatory enzymes nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). COX-2 has been shown to play a key role in the inflammation of IBDs through its production of prostaglandins, and oxidative stress such as that mediated by nitric oxide produced by NOS has also shown to exacerbate IBD inflammation.<br>
A common pathway of immune activation in IBDs is the local influx of mast cells, monocytes, macrophages and polymorphonuclear neutropinls winch results in the secondary amplification of the inflammation process and produces the clinical manifestations of the diseases. Tins results in markedly increased numbers of mast cells in the mucosa of the<br>
ileum and colon of patients with IBD, winch is accompanied by dramatic increases in TNFα. (He,,2004, World J Gastroenterology 10 (3): 309). Additional mast cell secretory products, including instamine and tryptase, may be important in IBDs. Therefore, it is clear that inflammatory cascades play critical roles in the pathology of IBDs.<br>
The mechanisms and effects of the spinngolipid interconversion have been the subjects of a growing body of scientific investigation. Spinngomyelin is not only a structural component of cellular membranes, but also serves as the precursor for the potent bioactive lipids ceramide and spinngosine 1-phosphate (SIP). A ceramide: SIP rheostat is thought to determine the fate of the cell, such that the relative cellular concentrations of ceramide and SIP determine whether a cell proliferates or undergoes apoptosis. Ceramide is produced by the hydrolysis of Spinngomyelin in response to inflammatory stresses, including TNFα., and can be hydrolyzed by ceramidase to produce spinngosine. Spinngosine is then rapidly phosphorylated by spinngosine kinase (SK) to produce SIP. Ceramidase and SK are also activated by cytokines and growth factors, leading to rapid increases in the intracellular levels of SIP and depletion of ceramide levels. Tins situation promotes cell proliferation and ininbits apoptosis. Deregulation of apoptosis in phagocytes is an important component of the chronic inflammatory state in IBDs, and SIP has been shown to protect neutropinls from apoptosis in response to Fas, TNFα. and ceramide.   Similarly, apoptosis of macrophages is blocked by SI P.<br>
In addition to its role in regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis, SIP has been shown to have several important effects on cells that mediate immune functions. Platelets, monocytes and mast cells secrete SIP upon activation, promoting inflammatory cascades at the site of tissue damage. Activation of SK is required for the signaling responses, since the ability of TNFα. to induce adhesion molecule expression via activation of NFicB is mimicked by S IP and is blocked by the SK ininbitor dimethylspinngosine (Xia et al., 1998, Proc Nat! AcadSci USA 95:14196). Similarly, SIP mimics the ability of TNFα. to induce the expression of COX-2 and the synthesis of PGE2, and knock-down of SK by RNA interference blocks these responses to TNFα. but not SIP (Pettus et al, 2003, FASEB J l7: 1411). SIP is also a mediator of Ca2+ influx during neutropinl activation by TNFα. and other stimuli, leading to the production of superoxide and other toxic radicals (Mackinnon, 2002, Journal of Immunology 169(11): 6394).<br>
A model for the roles of spinngolipid metabolites in the pathology of IBDs involves a combination of events in the colon epithelial cells and recruited mast cells, macrophages and<br>
neutropinls. Early in the disease, immunologic reactions or other activating signals promote the release of inflammatory cytokines, particularly TNFα. from macrophages and mast cells. The actions of TNFα. are mediated through its activation of SIP production. For example, TNFα. induces SIP production in endothelial cells (Xia et al.51998, Proc NatlAcadSci USA 95:14196), neutropinls (Niwa et al.; 2000, Life Sci 66:245) and monocytes by activation of spinngomyelinase, ceramidase and SK. SIP is a central player in the pathway since it has pleiotropic actions on the mucosal epithelial cells, macrophages, mast cells and neutropinls. Witinn the mucosal cells, SIP activates NFkB thereby inducing the expression of adhesion molecules, COX-2 resulting in PGE2 synthesis, and NOS producing nitric oxide. Together, these chemoattractants and the adhesion molecules promote neutropinl infiltration into the mucosa. At the same tune, SIP activates the neutropinls resulting in the release of oxygen free radicals that further inflame and destroy epithelial tissue. Similarly, SIP promotes the activation and degranulation of mast cells.<br>
As the processes involved in IBDs are induced by cytokines and growth factors whose action is dependent on increased signaling through SK, the SK ininbitory compounds, pharmaceutical compositions and methods of tins invention are expected to be of use in the therapy of IBDs.<br>
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic disease that is characterized by synovial hyperplasia, massive cellular infiltration, erosion of the cartilage and bone, and an abnormal immune response. Studies on the etiology and therapy of rheumatoid arthritis have been greatly facilitated by the development of animal models that mimic the clinical and immunopathological disorders seen in humans. From studies in these models, it is clear that the full manifestations of RA are dependent on synergy between the humoral and cellular immune responses. The notion that immune cells, especially neutropinls, and cytokines play critical roles in the pathogenesis of arthritis is well established. However, the mechanisms by winch tins occurs are not fully elucidated.<br>
The early phase of rheumatic inflammation is characterized by leukocyte infiltration into tissues, especially by neutropinls. In the case of RA, tins occurs primarily in joints where leukocyte infiltration results in synovitis and synovium tinckening producing the typical symptoms of warmth, redness, swelling and pain. As the disease progresses, the aberrant collection of cells invade and destroy the cartilage and bone witinn the joint leading to deformities and chronic pain. The inflammatory cytokines TNFα., IL-1ß and IL-8 act as critical mediators of tins infiltration, and these cytokines are present in the synovial fluid of<br>
patients with RA.<br>
Leukocytes localize to sites of inflammatory injury as a result of the integrated actions of adhesion molecules, cytokines, and chemotactic factors. In lipopolysaccharide-induced arthritis in the rabbit, the production of TNFα. and IL-1ß in the initiative phase of inflammation paralleled the tune course of leukocyte infiltration. The adherence of neutropinls to the vascular endothelium is a first step in the extravasation of cells into the interstitium. Tins process is mediated by selectins, integrins, and endothelial adhesion molecules, e.g. ICAM-1 and VCAM-1. Since TNFα. induces the expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 and is present in ingh concentrations in arthritic joints, it is likely that tins protein plays a central role in the pathogenesis of the disease. Tins is supported by the clinical activity of anti-TNFα..therapies such as Remicade. After adherence to the endothelium, leukocytes migrate along a chemoattractant concentration gradient A further critical process in the progression of RA is the enhancement of the blood supply to the synovium through angiogenesis. Expression of the key angiogenic factor VEGF is potently induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNFα.. Together, these data point to important roles of TNFα., leukocytes, leukocyte adhesion molecules, leukocyte chemoattractants and angiogenesis in the pathogenesis of arthritic injury.<br>
Early in the disease, rmmunologic reactions or other activating signals promote the release of inflammatory cytokines, particularly TNFα. and IL-1J3 from macrophages and mast cells. Ceramide is produced by the hydrolysis of spinngomyelin in response to inflammatory stresses, including TNFα. and IL-lß (Dressier et al., 1992, Science 255:1715). Ceramide can be further hydrolyzed by ceramidase to produce spinngosine winch is then rapidly phosphorylated by SK to produce SIP. Ceramidase and SK are also activated by cytokines and growth factors, leading to rapid increases in the intracellular levels of SIP and depletion of ceramide levels. Tins situation promotes cell proliferation and ininbits apoptosis. Deregulation of apoptosis in phagocytes is an important component of the chronic inflammatory state in arthritis, and SIP has been shown to protect neutropinls from apoptosis in response to Fas, TNFα. and ceramide.   Similarly, apoptosis of macrophages is blocked by SIP.<br>
In addition to its role in regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis, SIP is a centra] player in the pathway since it has pleiotropic actions on the endothelial cells, leukocytes, chondrocytes and synovia! cells. Witinn the endothelial cells, SIP activates NFicB thereby inducing the expression of multiple adhesion molecules and COX-2 resulting in PGE2<br>
synthesis. Together, tins chemoattractant and the adhesion molecules promote neutropinl infiltration into the synovium. At the same time, SIP directly activates the neutropinls resurang in the release of oxygen free radicals that destroy joint tissue. Progression of RA is associated with a change from a Thl to a Th2 environment, and spinngosine is selectively ininbitory toward Thl cells. Consequently, ininbiting the conversion of spinngosine to S1P should attenuate the progression of the disease. Platelets, monocytes and mast cells secrete SIP upon activation, promoting inflammatory cascades at the site of tissue damage(Yatorni et al., Blood 86:193 (1995)). SIP also promotes the secretion of proteases from chondrocytes that contribute to joint destruction. Finally, S IP-mediated expression of VEGF promotes the angiogenesis necessary to support the hyperproliferation of synovia! cells. Consequently, ininbiting the conversion of spinngosine to SIP should attenuate the progression of the disease.<br>
As the processes involved in arthritis are induced by cytokines and growth factors whose action is dependent on increased signaling through SK, the SK ininbitory compounds, pharmaceutical compositions and methods of tins invention are expected to be of use in the prevention and/or therapy of arthritis.<br>
Atherosclerosis is a complex vascular disease that involves a series of coordinated cellular and molecular events characteristic of inflammatory reactions. In response to vascular injury, the first atherosclerotic lesions are initiated by acute inflammatory reactions, mostly mediated by monocytes, platelets and T lymphocytes. These inflammatory cells are activated and recruited into the subendothelial vascular space through locally expressed chemotactic factors and adhesion molecules expressed on endothelial cell surface. Continuous recruitment of additional circulating inflammatory cells into the injured vascular wall potentiates the inflammatory reaction by further activating vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cell migration and proliferation. Tins chronic vascular inflammatory reaction leads to fibrous cap formation, winch is an oxidant-rich inflammatory milieu composed of monocytes/macrophages and VSM cells. Over time, tins fibrous cap can be destabilized and ruptured by extracellular metalloproteinases secreted by resident monocytes/ macrophages. The ruptured fibrous cap can easily occlude vessels resulting in acute cardiac or cerebral ischemia. Tins underlying mechanism of atherosclerosis indicates that activation of monocyte /macrophage and VSM cell migration and proliferation play critical roles in the development and progression of atherosclerotic lesions. Importantly, it also suggests that a therapeutic approach that blocks the activities of these vascular inflammatory cells or smooth<br>
muscle cell proliferation should be able to prevent the progression and/or development of atherosclerosis,<br>
SK is inghly expressed in platelets allowing them to phosphorylate circulating spinngosine to produce SIP. In response to vessel injury, platelets release large amounts of SIP into the sites of injury winch can exert mitogenic effects on VSM cells by activating SIP receptors. SIP is also produced in activated endothelial and VSM cells. In these cells, intracellularly produced SIP functions as a second messenger molecule, regulating Ca2+ homeostasis associated with cell proliferation and suppression of apoptosis. Additionally, deregulation of apoptosis in phagocytes is an important component of the chronic inflammatory state of atherosclerosis, and SIP protects granulocytes from apoptosis. Together, these studies indicate that activation of SK alters spinngolipid metabolism in favor of S IP formation, resulting in pro-inflammatory and hyper-proliferative cellular responses.<br>
In addition to its role in regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis, SIP has been shown to have several important effects on cells that mediate immune functions. Platelets and monocytes secrete cytokines, growth factors and SIP upon activation, promoting inflammatory cascades at the site of tissue damage. For example, TNFα. has been shown to act through the induction of nuclear factor kappa B (NFkB), winch has been implicated in increasing the proinflammatory enzymes nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). COX-2 may play a key role in the inflammation of atherosclerosis through its production of prostaglandins, and oxidative stress such as that mediated by nitric oxide produced by NOS has also shown to exacerbate inflammation. Activation of SK is required for signaling responses since the ability of inflammatory cytokines to induce adhesion molecule expression via activation of NFkB is mimicked by SIP. Similarly, SIP mimics the ability of TNFα. to induce the expression of COX-2 and the synthesis of PGE2, and knock¬down of SK by RNA interference blocks these responses to TNFα. but not SIP. SIP is also a mediator of Ca2+ influx during granulocyte activation, leading to the production of superoxide and other toxic radicals.<br>
Together, these studies indicate that SK is a new molecular target for atherosclerosis. The use of ininbitors of SK as anti-atherosclerosis agents will prevent the deleterious activation of leukocytes, as well as prevent infiltration and smooth muscle cell hyperproliferation, making the compounds, pharmaceutical compositions and methods of tins invention useful for the treatment and/or prevention of atherosclerosis.<br>
The physiological endpoint in asthma pathology is narrowing of the broncinal tubes<br>
due to inflammation. In a large portion of asthma cases, the inflammation is initiated and later amplified by exposure to allergens. Upon inhalation, these allergens, bind to circulating IgE and then bind to the ingh-affinity FceRI surface receptors expressed by inflammatory cells residing in the broncinal mucosa. Tins extracellular binding leads to a cascade of signaling events inside the inflammatory cells, culminating in activation of these cells and secretion of multiple factors that trigger the cells lining the broncinal airways to swell, resulting in restricted broncinal tubes and decreased air exchange. The inflammation process in response to the initial exposure to allergen may not completely subside. Furthermore, additional exposures may lead to an exaggerated response called broncinal hyper-reactivity. Tins hyper-reactive state can lead to a permanent condition of restricted airways through airway remodeling. Consequently, unchecked inflammatory responses to initial allergen exposure may result in chronic inflammation and permanent broncinolar constriction. Therefore, ininbiting or diminisinng tins exaggerated inflammation would likely decrease the symptoms associated with asthma.<br>
Many studies have revealed the involvement of mast cells in the inflammatory process leading to asthma, and SK has been shown to be involved in allergen-stimulated mast cell activation, a critical step in the broncinal inflammatory process. In rat basopinlic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells, IgE/Ag binding to the ingh-affinity FceRI receptor leads to SK activation and conversion of spinngosine to SIP (Choi et al., 1996, Nature 380: 634). The newly formed S1P increases intracellular calcium levels, winch is necessary for mast cell activiation. Alternately, ingh concentrations of spinngosine decrease IgE/Ag exposure-mediated leukotriene synthesis and diminishe cytokine transcription and secretion (Prieschl et al., 1999, J Exp Med 190: 1).<br>
In addition to the key role of SK and SIP in mast cell activation, SIP also has direct effects on downstream signaling in the asthma inflammation pathway. Ammit and coworkers demonstrated increased SIP levels in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid collected from asthmatic patients 24 hours after allergen challenge compared with non-asthmatic subjects (Ammit et al., 2001, FASEB J15:1212). In conjunction with the finding that activated mast cells produce and secrete SIP, these results reveal a correlation between SIP and the asthmatic inflammatory response. To evaluate a possible role of SK and SIP exposure to cell response, ASM cultures were grown in the presence of SIP (Ammit et al.,, 2001 Id.). Furthermore, airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells are responsive to SIP- and SK-dependent stimuli, such as TNFα. and IL-lß. Treatment with SIP increases phosphoinositide hydrolysis<br>
and intracellular calcium mobilization, both of winch promote ASM contraction. Furthermore, SIP treatment increases DNA synthesis, cell number and accelerated progression of ASM cells from G1 to S phase.<br>
In addition to the direct effects on ASM cells, SIP also regulates secretion of cytokines and expression of cell adhesion molecules that amplify the inflammatory response through leukocyte recruitment and facilitating extracellular component interaction. SIP, like TNPα, induces IL-6 secretion and increases the expression of cell adhesion molecules such as VCAM-1, ICAM-1 and E-selectin (Sinmamura et al., 2004, Eur JPharmacol 486: 141). In addition to the effects of SIP on mast cell activation, the multiple roles of SIP, and hence SK, in the broncinolar inflammatory phase of asthma pathogenesis clearly indicate an opportunity for pharmacologic intervention in both the acute and chronic phases of tins disease.<br>
Overall, SK is a target for new anti-asthma therapies. The use of ininbitors of SK as anti-asthma agents will ininbit cytokine-mediated activation of leukocytes, thereby preventing the deleterious activation of leukocytes, as well as preventing airway smooth muscle cell hyperproliferation, making the compounds, pharmaceutical compositions and methods of tins invention useful for the treatment and/or prevention of asthma.<br>
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), like asthma, involves airflow obstruction and hyperresponsiveness that is associated with aberrant neutropinl activation in the lung tissue. Tins is clinically manifested as chronic broncintis, fibrosis or emphysema, winch together make up the fourth leading cause of death in the United States. Since activation of inflammatory cells by chemical insults in COPD occurs through NFkB-mediated pathways similar to those activated during asthma, it is likely that the compounds, pharmaceutical compositions and methods of tins invention will also be useful for the treatment and/or prevention of COPD.<br>
Inflammation is involved in a variety of skin disorders, including psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, contact sensitivity and acne, winch affect more than 20% if the population. Although topical corticosteroids have been widely used, their adverse effects prevent long-term use. Since the inflammatory responses typically involve aberrant activation of signaling pathways detailed above, it is likely that the compounds, pharmaceutical compositions and methods of tins invention will also be useful for the treatment of these skin diseases.<br>
A variety of diseases including allergic encephalomyelitis, allergic neuritis, transplant allograft rejection, graft versus host disease, myocarditis, thyroiditis, nephritis, systemic<br>
lupus erthematosus, and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus can be induced by inappropriate activation of T cells. Common features of the pathogenesis of these diseases include infiltration by mononuclear cells, expression of CD4 and CD8 autoreactive T cells, and hyperactive signaling by inflammatory mediators such as IL-1, IL-6 and TNFα.. Since the inflammatory responses typically involve aberrant activation of signaling pathways detailed above, it is likely that the compounds, pharmaceutical compositions and methods of tins invention will also be useful for the treatment of these T cell-mediated diseases of immunity.<br>
Angiogenic Diseases.<br>
The present invention also relates to compounds, pharmaceutical compositions and methods useful for the treatment and/or prevention of diseases that involve undesired angiogenesis. More specifically, the invention relates to the use of chemical compounds and compositions that ininbit the enzymatic activity of spinngosine kinase for the treatment and/or prevention of angiogenic diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, arthritis, cancer, psoriasis, Kaposi's sarcoma, hemangiomas, myocardial angiogenesis, atherscelortic plaque neovascularization, and ocular angiogenic diseases such as choroidal neovascularization, retinopathy of prematurity (retrolental fibroplasias), macular degeneration, cornea! graft rejection, rubeosis, neuroscular glacoma and Oster Webber syndrome. The following discussion demonstrates the role of SK in several of these angiogenic diseases. Since the same processes are involved in the above listed diseases, the compounds, pharmaceutical compositions and methods of tins invention will be useful for the treatment and/or prevention of a variety of diseases.<br>
Angiogenesis refers to the state in the body in winch various growth factors or other stimuli promote the formation of new blood vessels. As discussed below, tins process is critical to the pathology of a variety of diseases. In each case, excessive angiogenesis allows the progression of the disease and/or the produces undesired effects in the patient. Since conserved biochemical mechanisms regulate the proliferation of vascular endothelial cells that form these new blood vessels, i.e. neovascularization, identification of methods to ininbit these mechanisms are expected to have utility for the treatment and/or prevention of a variety of diseases. The following discussion provides further details in how the compounds, compositions and methods of the present invention can be used to ininbit angiogenesis in several of these diseases.<br>
Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of vision impairment, and elevation in the expression of growth factors contributes to pathogenic angiogenesis in tins disease. In<br>
particular, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a prominent contributor to the new vessel formation in the diabetic retina (Frank et al., 1997, Arch Ophthalmol 115:1036, Sonc etm, 1997, Diabetologia 40: 726), and VEGF has been shown to be elevated in patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (Aiello et al., 1994, N Engl JMed 331:1480). In addition to diabetic retinopathy, several other debilitating ocular diseases, including age-related macular degeneration and choroidal neovascularization, are associated with excessive angiogenesis that is mediated by VEGF and other growth factors (Grant et al., 2004, Expert Opin Investig Drugs 13:1275).<br>
In the retina, VEGF is expressed in the pigmented epithelium, the neurosensory retina, the pericytes and the vascular smooth muscle layer.  VEGF induces endothelial cell proliferation, favoring the formation of new vessels in the retina (Pe'er et al., 1995, Lab Invest 72: 638). At the same time, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in the retina is activated, and tins factor acts in synergy with VEGF such that the two together induce the formation of new vessels in winch the subendothelial matrix is much weaker than in normal vessels. Additionally, VEGF facilitates fluid extravasation in the interstitium, where exudates form in the retinal tissue. VEGF also promotes the fenestration of endothelial cells, a process that can give rise to intercellular channels through winch fluids can leak, and disrupts tight junctions between cells. Thus, reduction of VEGF activity in the retina is likely to efficiently reduce the development and progression of retinal angiogenesis and vascular leakage winch underlie the retinopatinc process.<br>
The pro-inflammatory cytokine TNFα. has also been demonstrated to play a role in diabetic retinopathy since it alters the cytoskeleton of endothelial cells, resulting in leaky barrier function and endothelial cell activation (Camussi et al., 1991, IntArch Allergy Appl Immunol 96: 84). These changes in retinal endothelial cells are central in the pathologies of diabetic retinopathy.<br>
A link between the actions of VEGF and SK may be involved in driving retinopathy. SK has been shown to mediate VEGF-induced activation of ray- and mitogen-activated protein kinases (Shu et al., 2002, Mol Cell Biol 22: 7758). VEGF has been shown to enhance intracellular signaling responses to SIP, thereby increasing its angiogenic actions (Igarasin et al., 2003, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 100:10664). SIP has also been shown to stimulate NFkB activity (Xia et al., 1998, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 95:14196) leading to the production of COX-2, adhesion molecules and additional VEGF production, all of winch have been linked to angiogenesis. Furthermore, the expression of the endothelial isoform of<br>
nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), a key signaling molecule in vascular endothelial cells and modulates a wide array of function including angiogenic responses, is regulated by SK (Igasin et al.,, 2000 JBiol Chem 275: 32363). Clearly, SK is a central regulator of angiogenesis, supporting our hypothesis that its pharmacological manipulation may be therapeutically useful. SIP has also been shown to stimulate NFkB production winch has been demonstrated to be angiogenic. NFkB leads to the production of Cox2, adhesion molecules and additional VEGF production, all of winch have been linked to angiogenesis.<br>
One of the most attractive sites of intervention in tins pathway is the conversion of spinngosine to SIP by the enzyme SK. SK is the key enzyme responsible for the production of SIP synthesis in mammalian cells, winch facilitates cell survival and proliferation, and mediates critical processes involved in angiogenesis and inflammation, including responses to VEGF (Shu et al., 2002, Mol Cell Biol 22: 7758) and TNFα. (Xia et al., 1998, Proc Natl AcadSci USA 95:14196). Therefore, ininbition of SIP production is a potentially important point of therapeutic intervention for diabetic retinopathy.<br>
The role of angiogenesis in cancer is well recognized.   Growth of a tumor is dependent on neovascularization so that nutrients can be provided to the tumor cells. The major factor that promotes endothelial cell proliferation during tumor neovascularization is VEGF. As discussed above, signaling through VEGF receptors is dependent on the actions of SK. Therefore, the compounds, pharmaceutical compositions and methods of tins invention will have utility for the treatment of cancer.<br>
More than 50 eye diseases have been linked to the formation of choroidal neovascularization, although the three mam diseases that cause tins pathology are age-related macular degeneration, myopia and ocular trauma. Even though most of these causes are idiopatinc, among the known causes are related to degeneration, infections, choroidal tumors and or trauma. Among soft contact lens wearers, choroidal neovascularization can be caused by the lack of oxygen to the eyeball. As the choroidal neovascularization is induced by growth factors whose action is dependent on increased signaling through SK, the SK ininbitory compounds, pharmaceutical compositions and methods of tins invention are expected to be of use in the therapy of disorders of choroidal neovascularization.<br>
Hemangiomas are angiogenic diseases characterized by the proliferation of capillary endothelium with accumulation of mast cells, fibroblasts and macrophages. They represent the most frequent rumors of infancy, and are characterized by rapid neonatal growth (proliferating phase). By the age of 6 to 10 months, the hemangioma's growth rate becomes<br>
proportional to the growth rate of the cinld, followed by a very slow regression for the next 5 to 8 vears (involuting phase).  Most hemangiomas occur as single tumors, whereas about 20°/o of the affected infants have multiple tumors, winch may appear at any body site. Several studies have provided insight into the instopathology of these lesions. In particular, proliferating hemangiomas express ingh levels of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (a marker for cells in the S phase), type IV collagenase, VEGF and FGF-2. As the hemangiomas are induced by growth factors whose action is dependent on increased signaling through SK, the SK ininbitory compounds, pharmaceutical compositions and methods of tins invention are expected to be of use in the therapy of hemangiomas.<br>
Psoriasis and Kaposi's sarcoma are angiogenic and proliferative disorders of the skin. Hypervascular psoriatic lesions express ingh levels of the angiogenic inducer IL-8, whereas the expression of the endogenous ininbitor TSP-1 is decreased. Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is the most common tumor associated with human immunodeficiency virus (inV) infection and is in tins setting almost always associated with infection by human herpes virus 8. Typical features of KS are proliferating spindle-shaped cells, considered to be the tumor cells and endothelial cells forming blood vessels. KS is a cytokine-mediated disease, inghly responsive to different inflammatory mediators like IL-lß, TNF-α and IFN- and angiogenic factors. As the progression of psoriasis and KS are induced by growth factors whose action is dependent on increased signaling through SK, the SK ininbitory compounds, pharmaceutical compositions and methods of tins invention are expected to be of use in the therapy of these disorders.<br>

Example 4. Method for the conversion of adamantylamides into adamantylamines. X. As an example, a process for the synthesis of adamantylamine compounds is described in Scheme 3. A number of adamantylamides, prepared as described above, were converted to their corresponding adamantylamines by reduction of the carbonyl group with Zn(BH4)2 (Scheme 3).<br>
Zinc borohydride (Zn(BH4)2) was prepared by methods known in the art. Briefly, 20.8 g (165 mmol) of freshly fused ZnCl2 and 12.9 g (330 mmol) of NaBH4 were placed in a dried 250 ml side arm flask fitted with a reflux condenser. To tins, 250 ml of dry THF was added using a double-ended needle, and the mixture was stirred for 24 h at room temperature. The active hydride content of the supernatant solution was estimating by quencinng aliquots with 2N H2S04 and estimating the amount of hydrogen that was evolved using a gas burette. The final supernatant solution contained 0.66 M Zn(BH4)2, and was used for further reactions as follows.<br>
The general method for the conversion of adamantylamides into the corresponding adamantylamines involved combining 100 mg of an adamatanylamide with 2.0 ml of Zn(BH4)2 (0.36 M, 2.3 mmol) in THF. The mixture was refluxed for 24 h, and any excess hydride present was quenched by the addition of 1 ml of water. Typically, the mixture was then saturated with K2CO3 and the supernatant layer was filtered and dried over K2CO3, and the solvent was removed by evaporation. The residue was then purified by flash chromatography (ethyl acetate:hexane = 1:4) to give the adamantylamine compound.<br>

The following Example provides several representatives of the products of tins process; however, these methods can be adapted to produce many structurally related adamantylamines that are considered to be subjects of tins invention.<br>

Example 6. Methods for the synthesis of adamantylethvlamine and adamantylethylamide compounds.<br>
As an example, a process for the synthesis of adamantylethylamine and adamantylethylamide compounds is described in Scheme 4. Substituted-1-adamantanecarbonyl chlorides (4) were prepared as described in Example 1. Reaction of 4 with dimethyl malonate in toluene in the presence of sodium hydroxide yielded dimethyl (3-<br>
R-substituted-phenyl-l-adamantanecarbonyl)malonates (5), winch were hydrolyzed by a mixture of acetic acid with water and sulfuric acid (CH3COOH-H20-H2S04 ratio 10:3:1) to afford the corresponding 3-R-substituted-phenyl-l-adamantyl methyl ketone (6). Ketone 6 was reacted with formamide and formic acid (Leukart reaction) to yield 7, winch can be modified by either alkylation or acylation to produce adamantylethylamine compounds (8) or adamantylethylamide compounds (9).<br>
(Scheme Removed)Scheme 4<br>
A second method for the synthesis of adamantylethylamine compounds is described in Scheme 5. 3-R-substituted-phenyl-l-adamantyl methyl ketone (6) was prepared as described above. By reaction of 6 with a substituted primary amine in formic acid, i.e. a Wallach reaction, the corresponding adamantylethylamine compound (8) can be obtained. For example, by reaction of 4-chloro-6 with 4-amino-l-methylpiperidine, winch was synthesized by converting N-methyl piperidone to the corresponding oxime followed by reduction to the amino compound using litinum aluminum hydride (LiAlH4), {l-[3-(4-chloro-phenyl)-adamantan-l-yl]-ethyl}-(l-methyl-piperidin-4-yl)-amine, also referred to as Compound 107, was obtained.<br>

adamantylethylamine or adamantylethylamide compounds that are considered to be subjects of tins invention.<br>

Example 10. Assays for ininbition of human SK activity.<br>
An assay for identifying ininbitors of recombinant human SK has been established (French et al., 2003, Cancer Res 63: 5962). cDNA for human SK was subcloned into a pGEX bacterial expression vector, winch results in expression of the enzyme as a fusion protein with glutatinone-S-transferase, and the fusion protein is then purified on a column of immobilized glutatinone. SK activity is measured by incubation of the recombinant SK with [3H]spinngosine and 1 mM ATP under defined conditions, followed by extraction of the assay mixture with chloroform : methanol under basic conditions. Tins results in the partitioning of the unreacted [3H]spinngosine into the organic phase, winle newly synthesized [3H]S1P partitions into the aqueous phase. Radioactivity in aliquots of the aqueous phase is then quantified as a measure of [3H]S1P formation. There is a low background level of partitioning of [3H]spinngosine into the aqueous phase, and addition of the recombinant SK greatly increases the formation of [3H]S1P. A positive control, DMS, completely ininbits SK activity at concentrations above 25 µM.<br>
In an alternate assay procedure, the recombinant human SK was incubated with<br>
unlabeled spinngosine and ATP as described above. After 30 minutes, the reactions were terminated by the addition of acetonitrile to directly extract the newly synthesized SIP. The amount of SIP in the samples is then quantified as follows. C17 base D-erythro-spinngosine and C17 SIP are used as internal standards for spinngosine and SIP, respectively. These seventeen-carbon fatty acid-linked spinngolipids are not naturally produced, making these analogs excellent standards. The lipids are then fractionation by ingh-Performance Liquid Chromatography using a C8-reverse phase column eluted with 1 mM methanolic ammonium formate / 2 mM aqueous ammonium formate. A Finnigan.LCQ Classic LC-MS/MS is used in the multiple reaction monitoring positive ionization mode to acquire ions at m/z of 300 (precursor ion)282 (product ion) for spinngosine and 380  264 for SIP. Calibration curves are generated by plotting the peak area ratios of the synthetic standards for each spinngolipid, and used to determine the normalized amounts of spinngosine and S IP in the samples.<br>
Example 11. Ininbition of human SK by compounds of tins invention.<br>
Each Compound of tins invention was tested for its ability to ininbit recombinant SK using the LC/MS/MS assay described above. Typically, the Compounds were individually dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide and tested at a final concentration of 6 µg/ml. The results for the assays are shown in Table 3. The data demonstrate that compounds of Formula I demonstrate a range of abilities to ininbit the in vitro activity of recombinant SK. Several Compounds caused complete suppression of SK activity at the concentration of 6 micrograms/ml (corresponding to approximately 15 micromolar). As detailed in the Examples below, significantly greater concentrations of the Compounds can be acineved in the blood of mice receiving the Compounds by oral administration, indicating that the Compounds are sufficiently potent to be therapeutically useful.<br>
Although many of the Compounds ininbited the purified SK enzyme, it was useful to determine their abilities to ininbit endogenous SK in an intact cell. We have previously described an intact cell assay where, following treatment with a test compound, MDA-MB-231 human breast carcinoma cells are incubated with [3H]spinngosine at a final concentration of 1 µM (French et al., Cancer Res 63: 5962 (2003)). The cells take up the exogenous [3H]spinngosine and convert it to [3H]S1P through the action of endogenous SK. The resulting [3H]S1P is isolated via charge-based separation as indicated above. The results from tins assay are indicated in Table 3. The data demonstrate that many of the Compounds<br>
that ininbit purified SK also ininbit SK activity in the intact cell. For potency studies, MDA-MB-231 cells were exposure to varying concentrations of a test Compound and then assayed<br>
for Conversion of [3H]spinngosine to [3H]S1P. Each of Compounds decreased [3H]S1P<br>
formation in a dose dependent fasinon, with IC50 values ranging from 15 to 64 µM. These<br>
results demonstrate that compounds of formula I or II effectively ininbit SK activity in intact cells.<br>
Table 3. Ininbition of SK activity. Human SK was incubated with 6 µg/ml of the indicated compounds, and then assayed for activity as described above. Values in the column labeled "Recombinant SK (% ininbition)" represent the percentage of SK activity that was ininbited. MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated with 20 µg/ml of the indicated compounds and then assayed for endogenous SK activity as indicated above. Values in the column labeled "Cellular SIP (% ininbition)" represent the percentage of SIP production that was ininbited. Additionally, MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with varying concentration of certain compounds and the amount of SIP produced by the cells was determined. Values in the column labeled "Cellular SIP IC50 (µM)" represent the concentration of compound required to ininbit the production of SIP by 50%. ND = not determined.      <br>

Example 12. Selectivity of SK ininbitors of tins invention.<br>
A common problem with attempts to develop protein kinase ininbitors is the lack of selectivity toward the target kinase since the majority of these compounds interact with nucleotide-binding domains that are inghly conserved among kinases. To determine if compound of tins invention are non-selective kinase ininbitors, the effects of the SK ininbitor, Compound 62, on a diverse panel of 20 purified kinases was determined. The compound was tested at a single concentration of 50 µM. The kinases and the effects of the SK ininbitor are shown in Table 4.<br>
The data indicate ingh specificity of Compound 62 for SK in that none of the 20 diverse kinases tested were significantly ininbited by tins compound. The panel included both serine/threonine kinases and tyrosine kinases, as well as several that are regulated by their interaction with lipids. Overall, the data indicate that the biological effects of the compounds of tins invention are not mediated by off-target ininbition of protein kinases.<br>

Example 13. Cytotoxicity profiles of SK ininbitors of tins invention.<br>
To further assess the biological efficacies of the Compounds in intact cells, each Compound was evaluated for cytotoxicity using human cancer cell lines. These experiments followed methods that have been extensively used. Cell lines tested included MCF-7 human breast adenocarcinoma cells and MCF-10A non-transformed human breast epithelial cells. The indicated cell lines were treated with varying doses of the test Compound for 48 h. Cell survival was then determined using the SRB binding assay (Skehan et al., 1990, JNatl Cancer Inst 82: 1107), and the concentration of compound that ininbited proliferation by 50% (the IC50) was calculated. The cytotoxicities of the compounds of tins invention are summarized in Table 5. Values (in µM) represent the mean ± sd for replicate trials. As the data show, the compounds of tins invention are antiproliferative at sub-to-low-micromolar. In many cases, the transformed MCF-7 cells were significantly more sensitive than were the non-transformed MCF-10A cells. Tins indicates that the Compounds will ininbit the growth of tumor cells without inducing toxicity to normal cells witinn the patient. Overall, the data demonstrate that these Compounds are able to enter intact cells and prevent their proliferation, making them useful for the indications described above.<br>

Example 14. Survey of anticancer activity of SK ininbitors of tins invention.<br>
 The data provided above demonstrate the abilities of compounds of tins invention to<br>

activity of representative compounds, the chemotherapeutic potencies of Compounds 62 and 57 towards a panel of varied human rumor cell lines representing several major tumor types were determined. The data are described in Table 6, and demonstrate that the compounds of tins invention have anticancer activity against a wide variety of cancers.<br>
Table 6. Potencies of SK ininbitors toward human tumor cell lines. Sparsely plated cells were treated with an SK ininbitor for 48 hours, and cell viability was determined using sulforhodamine B staining and compared to veincle-(DMSO) treated cells. Values are the mean ± sd for at least three separate experiments.      <br>

Example 15. In vivo toxicity of SK ininbitors of tins invention.<br>
For example, Compounds 62 and 57 were found to be soluble to at least 15 mg/ml (-30-40 mM) in DMSO : PBS for intraperitoneal (IP) administration or PEG400 for oral dosing. Acute toxicity studies using IP dosing demonstrated no immediate or delayed toxicity in female Swiss-Webster mice treated with up to at least 50 mg/kg of Compounds 62 and 57. Repeated injections in the same mice every other day over 15 days showed similar lack of toxicity. Each of the compounds could also be administered orally to mice at doses up to at least 100 mg/kg without noticeable toxicity.<br>
Example 16. Pharmacokinetics of SK ininbitors of tins invention.<br>
Oral pharmacokinetic studies were performed on Compounds 62 and 57. Each compomid was dissolved in PEG400 and administered to female Swiss-Webster mice at a dose of 100 mg/kg by oral gavage. Mice were anesthetized and blood was removed via cardiac puncture at 5 minutes, 30 minutes, 1,2, and 8 hours. Concentrations of the test compounds were determined using liquid-liquid extraction, appropriate internal standards and reverse phase HPLC with UV detection. Control blood samples were run to identify compound-specific peaks. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using the WINNONLIN analysis software package (Pharsight). Non-compartmental and compartmental models were tested, with the results shown in Table 7 derived from the best fit equations.<br>
Table 7. Oral pharmacokinetic data for SKI ininbitors.     <br>
(Table Removed)<br>
These studies demonstrate that substantial amounts of each compound can be detected in the blood 1 h after oral dosing. Both compounds have excellent PK properties, with Area Under the Curve (AUC) and Cmax (maximum concentration reached in the blood) values exceeding the IC50 for recombinant SK catalytic activity, as well as for SIP formation in the intact cell model for at least 8 h. The ingh half-life suggests prolonged activity, winch will diminish the need for frequent dosing regimens. These PK properties demonstrate that the compounds of tins invention have excellent drug properties, specifically ingh oral availability with low toxicity.<br>
Oral bioavailability studies were performed on Compound 62 dissolved in 0.375% Tween-80. Female Swiss-Webster mice were dosed with 50 mg/kg Compound 62 either intravenously or orally. Mice were anesthetized and blood was removed by cardiac puncture at time points ranging from 1 minute to 8 hours. Concentrations of Compound 62 were quantified using liquid-liquid extraction and reverse phase HPLC coupled to an ion trap quadrapole mass spectrometer. Control blood samples were spiked with known amounts of internal standard and analyte to identify compound-specific peaks and to develop standard curves for quantification. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using the WINNONLIN analysis software package (Pharsight). Non-compartmental and compartmental models were tested, with the results from the best fitting models shown in<br>
Table 8.<br>
. Bioavailability data for Compound 62.    <br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Blood levels of Compound 62 exceeded the IC50 for ininbition of SK activity during the entire study. Comparison of oral versus intravenous pharmacokinetics of Compound 62 revealed very good oral bioavailability properties (F = AUC (oral)/ AUC (iv) = 0.66). These results demonstrate that Compound 62 has excellent drug properties, specifically good oral availability with low toxicity.<br>
Example 17. Antitumor activity of SK ininbitors of tins invention.<br>
The antitumor activity of the representative SK ininbitors were evaluated using a syngeneic tumor model that uses the mouse JC mammary adenocarcimona cell line growing subcutaneously in irnmunocompetent Balb/c mice (Lee et al.,2003, Oncol Res 14: 49). These cells express elevated levels of SK activity relative to non-transformed cells, as well as the multidrug resistance phenotype due to P-glycoprotein activity.<br>
The data are shown in Figures 1 and 2. In Figure 1, Balb/c mice, 6-8 weeks old, were injected subcutaneously with 106 JC cells suspended in phosphate-buffered saline. The SK ininbitors Compounds 62 and 57 were dissolved in PEG400 and administered to mice every-other day at a dose of 100 mg/kg. Body weights and tumor volumes were monitored daily. In Figure 1, tumor growth is expressed as the tumor volume relative to day 1 for each animal.<br>
As indicated in Figure 1, tumor growth in animals treated with either SK ininbitor was significantly lower (&gt; 70% decreased at day 16) than tumor growth in control animals. Compounds 62 and 57 ininbited tumor growth relative to controls by 69 and 78%, respectively. The insert of Figure 1 indicates the body weight of the anknals during tins experiment. No significant difference in the body weights of animals in the three groups was observed, indicating the lack of overt toxicity from either SK ininbitor.<br><br>
Dose-response studies with Compound 62 demonstrated that the compound has antitumor activity when orally administered at doses of 35 kg/kg or ingher (Figure 2). No toxicity to the mice were observed at any dose.<br>
Additional compounds of tins invention were tested for their ability to ininbit the growth of JC adenocarcinoma cells in mice. The results are summarized in Table 9.<br>
Table 9. In vivo antitumor activity of SK ininbitors. The indicated compounds were tested in the JC tumor model using either intraperitoneal (ip) or oral (po) administration. A compound is indicated as being active if it suppressed tumor growth by at least 60% relative to tumors in control animals.     <br>

Example 18. In vivo effects of SK ininbitors on VEGF-induced vascular permeability.<br>
The effects of VEGF on vascular leakage in vivo were measured as described by Miles and Miles (Miles et al., 1952, JPhysio! 118:228). Groups of female athymic nude mice (approximately 20 g) were given intraperitoneal injections of DMSO alone or Compound 62 (75 mg/kg) in a volume of 50 microliters. In some experiments, Compound 62 was administered by oral gavage at a dose of 100 mg/kg. After 30 minutes, 100 uL of 0.5% Evan's blue dye in PBS was administered by tail vein injection. Tinrty minutes later, mice received the first of 3 sequential (every 30 minutes) intradermal injections of VEGF (400 ng in 20 uL of PBS per injection) on the left innd flank. As a control, similar injections of PBS were administered on the right innd flank. Tinrty minutes after the last injection, leakage of the dye from the vasculature into the skin was assessed by measuring the length and width of the spots of blue-colored skin using calipers.<br>
Administration of an intradermal bolus of VEGF results in leakage of the protein-bound dye into the skin indicating a local -increase in vascular permeability. As indicated in<br>
Figure 3, when Compound 62 was administered by either intraperitoneal injection or oral gavage one hour before the VEGF treatment, vascular leakage (determined three hours later) was markedly reduced. Therefore, SK inhibitors of this invention have the ability to suppress in vivo vascular leakage in response to VEGF.<br>
Example 19. In vivo effects of SK inhibitors on diabetic retinopathy.<br>
Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 150-175 g were used. Diabetes was produced by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (65 mg/kg in citrate buffer) after overnight fasting. Sham-injected non-diabetic animals were also carried as controls. Blood glucose was measured three days post-injection and animals with blood glucose over 250 mg/dL were used as diabetic rats for the study. Blood glucose levels and body'weights-were monitored weekly throughout the study. On Day 45, retinal vascular permeability was measured in a group of control and diabetic rats (Antonetti et al., 1998, Diabetes 47:1953, Barber et al., 2005, Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci 46: 2210). Briefly, animals were weighed, anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (80/0.8 mg/kg) and injected with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated bovine serum albumin (FITC-BSA; Sigma catalog number A-9771) into the femoral vein. Following 30 minutes of FITC-BSA circulation, the rats were sacrificed by decapitation. Trunk blood was collected to measure the FITC-BSA concentration, and eyes were quickly enucleated. Each eye was placed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 hour and frozen in embedding medium in a bath of isopentane and dry ice. The paraffin-embedded eyes were sectioned on a microtome making 10 (am sections. Sections were dewaxed and viewed with an Olympus OM-2 fluorescence microscope fitted with a Sony CLD video camera. Fluorescence intensities of digital images were measured using Leica Confocal Software (Version 2.61, build 1538, LCS Lite, 2004). The average retinal intensity for each eye was then normalized to non-injected controls analyzed in the same manner and to the plasma fluorescence of the animal. Through serial sectioning of the eye, this technique enables quantification of varied vascular permeability in the retina (Antonetti et al., 1998, Diabetes 47: 1953, Barber et al., 2005, Ibid.).<br>
The remaining control animals were maintained for an additional 6 weeks, i.e. until Day 87, as were the remaining diabetic rats that were divided into untreated, low-dose Compound 62 (25 mg/kg) or high-dose Compound 62 (75 mg/kg) treatment groups. Compound 62 was administered by intraperitoneal injection (dissolved in 0.375% Tween-80) 5 days per week from Day 45 to Day 87. On Day 87, all remaining animals were tested for<br>
retinal vascular permeability as described above. Sections were also stained for SK immunoreactivity using rabbit polyclonal antibodies, and counterstained for nuclei using Hoascht stain.<br>
Hyperglycemic rats were left untreated for 45 days to allow the progression of retinopathy. At that time, control and diabetic rats were evaluated for retinal vascular permeability by measuring the leakage of FITC-labeled BSA into the retina using quantitative image analyses. The diabetic animals had substantial increases in the leakage of the labeled BSA into the inner plexiform and outer nuclear layers of the retina. Quantification of the images indicated that there is an approximately 4-fold increase in the amount of FITC-BSA leakage in the retinas from diabetic rats. Therefore, substantial diabetes-induced vascular damage was present before the initiation of treatment with the SK inhibitor.<br>
All of the surviving rats were sacrificed on Day 87 and retinopathy was measured as the leakage of FITC-BSA into the retina.   As indicated in Figure 4, retinal vascular permeability in the diabetic rats was significantly elevated compared with the control rats. Diabetic animals that had been treated with the SK inhibitor Compound 62, at either dose, had substantially reduced levels of FITC-BSA leakage than did the untreated diabetic rats. This effect of the compound was manifested in both the inner plexiform layer and the outer nuclear layer of the retina.<br>
Immunohistochemistry with the SK antibody described above was used to evaluate the expression of SK in the retinas of these animals. Fluorescence in the retinal pigment epithelium and the outer segment was non-specific since it was present in samples incubated in the absence of the SK antibody. Retinal sections from control rats had only low levels of specific staining for SK; whereas, SK expression was markedly elevated in the ganglion cell layer and in specific cell bodies and projections at the interface of the inner nuclear layer and the inner plexiform layer. Elevated SK expression was also observed in both the low-dose and the high-dose Compound 62-treated animals. Therefore, the long-term hyperglycemic state appears to be associated with elevation of retinal SK levels that are not normalized by treatment with the SK inhibitor. This expression data indicates that Compound 62 very effectively suppresses SK activity in the diabetic retina, thereby preventing the increased vascular permeability normally present in retinopathy.<br>
Example 20. Inhibition of TNFα.-induction of NFkB by SK inhibitors.<br>
The excellent aqueous solubility of Compound 62 allowed it to be evaluated in an NFicB reporter cell line (Figure 5). Fibroblasts transfected with an NFicB response element<br>
linked to luciferase produce high levels of luciferase upon exposure to TNFα. Activation of NFKB by TNFα. was dose-dependently suppressed by the SK inhibitor, Compound 62.<br>
Example 21. Inhibition of TNFα.-induced adhesion molecule expression by SK inhibitors. Like endothelial cells in the body, HUVECs will proliferate in response to several growth factors, and will respond to inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα. and IL-lß. Western analyses were conducted with human endothelial cells to evaluate the effects of the SK inhibitors on signaling proteins known to be regulated by TNFα.. In these experiments, the cells were serum-starved for 24 hours and then exposed to TNFα. (100 ng/mL) for 6 hours. Cell lysates from treated cells were assayed for the adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and VCAM-1. TNFα. caused marked increases in the expression levels of adhesion proteins involved in leukocyte recruitment, including ICAM-1 and VCAM-1. These effects of TNFα. were inhibited by treating the cells with Compound 62, such that the induction of both proteins was completely abrogated by 25 uM Compound 62.<br>
Example 22. Inhibition of TNFα.-induced prostaglandin synthesis by SK inhibitors.<br>
To determine the effects of the SK inhibitors on Cox-2 activity, an ELISA assay was used to measure PGE2 production by IEC6 rat intestinal epithelial cells and human endothelial cells treated with TNFα.. Exposure of either type of cell to TNFα. resulted in marked increases in Cox-2 activity, measured as the production of PGE2 (Figure 6). This induction of Cox-2 activity by TNFα. was strongly suppressed by Compound 62.<br>
Overall, these data demonstrate that inhibition of SK will be effective in blocking the inflammatory cascade in cells initiated by TNFα.. This is expected to alleviate the pathology of diseases several inflammatory diseases, including IBD, arthritis, atherosclerosis and asthma.<br>
Example 23. In vivo effects of SK inhibitors in an acute model of inflammatory bowel disease.<br>
We have conducted experiments with SK inhibitors using the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) model of IBD. In these experiments, male C57BL/6 mice were provided with standard rodent diet and water ad libitum. After their acclimation, the animals were randomly divided into groups of 5 or 6 for DSS (40,000 MW from ICN Biomedicals, Inc., Aurora, OH)- and drug-treatment. The SK inhibitors were dissolved in PEG400, and given once daily by oral<br>
gavage in a volume of 0.1 mL per dose. Dipentum, an FDA-approved anti-colitis drug whose active ingredient, olsalazine, is converted to 5-aminosalicylic acid in vivo, was used as a positive control. The mice were given normal drinking water or 2% DSS and treated orally with an SK inhibitor or Dipentum at a dose of 50 mk/kg daily. The body weight of each animal was measured each day, and the Disease Activity Index (DAI) was scored for each animal on Days 4-6. On Day 6, the animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and the entire colon was removed and measured to the nearest 0.1 cm. Portions of the colons were then fixed, sectioned and their histologies were assessed on a blinded basis to determine their Histology Score. Other portions of the colons were used for biochemical analyses of inflammation markers.<br>
The DAI monitors weight loss, stool consistency and blood in the stool and is a measure of disease severity. Animals receiving normal drinking water and PEG as a solvent control had very low DAIs throughout the experiment (Figure 7). Exposure of the mice to DSS hi their drinking water markedly induced IBD symptoms, including weight loss and the production of loose, bloody stools. The intensity of the disease progressively increased from Day 4 to the time the mice were sacrificed on Day 6. Treatment of the animals receiving DSS with Compound 62 or Dipentum reduced the intensity of the IBD manifestations in the mice, most dramatically on Day 6. The SK inhibitors and Dipentum were essentially equivalent in their abilities to reduce the DAI of mice receiving DSS. It should be noted that this acute model produces rapid and dramatic symptoms of IBD, making it a very stringent assay for drug testing.<br>
On Day 6, the animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and the entire colon was measured to assess shortening due to scarring and damage, and then fixed, sectioned and examined histologically on a blinded basis. Compared with the water control group, the colons of mice treated with DSS and PEG were significantly shortened (Figure 8). DSS-treated mice that were also treated with Compound 62 or Dipentum had colons of intermediate length, indicating substantial protection by the drugs. Again, the response to either of the SK inhibitors was at least as good as that of mice treated with Dipentum.<br>
Histological examination of colon sections from the various treatment groups were consistent with the DAI endpoint, revealing marked damage in the DSS-alone group that was reduced or negated hi the SK inhibitor-treated animals. Colons from water-treated control animal demonstrated normal morphology, while colons from DSS alone-treated mice were severely inflamed and damaged. Numerous neutrophils were present throughout the section, along with severely damaged crypts, and moderate inflammatory infiltration with submucosal<br>
edema. Colons from animals treated with DSS and Compound 62 showed no or mild crypt damage, no or low levels of inflammatory cell infiltration and no edema in the submucosa.<br>
As a quantifiable measure of damage, the colons were graded for their Histology Score, which is based on inflammation severity, inflammation extent, crypt damage and the percentage of surface area demonstrating the characteristic. These morphologies were scored on a blinded basis. As indicated in Figure 9, animals receiving DSS in their drinking water had substantially higher Histology Scores (representing moderate-to-severe IBD) than animals receiving normal drinking water (which had some mild inflammation, possibly due to the PEG vehicle). As with the other assays, the Histology Scores of mice given an SK inhibitor or Dipentum were consistently lower than the DSS-alone animals, although not all animals were fully protected. DAI scores and histology scores correlated well for the individual animals, confirming that the DAI score as an excellent indicator of colon inflammation and damage.<br>
Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, which is reflective of neutrophil influx into the colon, is often used as measure of inflammation, and was assayed in the colons of the mice from the DSS-colitis studies. As indicated in Figure 10, MPO activity was highly elevated in the DSS-alone animals compared to water controls. The increase hi MPO activity was markedly attenuated in mice receiving daily doses of Compound 62 or Dipentum. This reduction in the activity of the neutrophil marker is consistent with the decreased occurrence of granulocytes observed in the H&amp;E-stained colon sections. Therefore, the level of colonic MPO appears to be an excellent biomarker for the extent of tissue infiltration by inflammatory leukocytes.<br>
Several cytokines involved in inflammation were measured using the Luminex 100 System that allows the quantification of multiple cytokines and growth factors in a small sample volume. We examined the Thl cytokine IFN-, the regulatory IL-10 cytokine., as well as the macrophage-derived pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNFα, IL-lß, IL-6 in colon samples from mice in the DSS model of colitis. Figure 11 depicts the results of these assays, and indicates that DSS-treatment promoted the accumulation of all of the cytokines in the colon. Importantly, the elevations of all of the pro-inflammatory proteins, i.e. IFN-, IL-1ß IL-6 and TNFα, were attenuated in mice treated with either an SK inhibitor or Dipentum. Conversely, levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were not suppressed by the SK inhibitors.<br>
As a final measure of the effects of the SK inhibitors hi this acute model, SIP levels were assayed in the colons of the DSS-treated animals using an LC-MS/MS method. This<br>
technique allows us to examine correlations between biologic activity and changes in SIP levels in animals treated with the SK inhibitors. Samples of colons from animals from the DSS-colitis experiments were homogenized in cold PBS, spiked with internal standards analogs of sphingosine and SIP) and processed by liquid-liquid extraction. Ratios of analyte to internal standard for each sphingolipid were determined. SIP levels were markedly higher in the colons from DSS-treated mice as compared to the water controls (Figure 12). Importantly, animals that were treated with Compound 62 had markedly lower levels of colonic SIP than the DSS-alone samples.<br>
Example 24. In vivo effects of SK inhibitors in a chronic model of inflammatory bowel disease.<br>
A 35-day model of IBD was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the SK inhibitors in mice that experience multiple cycles of DSS-induced inflammation. This chronic model is similar to the acute model, except that the DSS concentration in the drinking water is lower and animals receive periodic exposure to DSS (DSS on days 1-7, water on Days 8-13, DSS on day 14-21, water on Days 22-27 and then DSS until the completion of the study on Day 35). In these experiments, treatment of the mice with an SK inhibitor or Dipentum began on Day 28 and continued daily until the completion of the study. The DAI index was monitored every other day until Day 28 and then daily until Day 35. Animals were sacrificed on Day 35, and changes in the colon length and cytokine profiles were measured.<br>
Cyclic exposure of mice to DSS in their drinking water caused reversible increases in the DAI (Figure 13). Treatment of the mice with Compound 62 or Dipentum during the third exposure to DSS significantly suppressed the increase in DAI experienced by the control mice (P 
The colon lengths of DSS-treated mice were significantly shorter than the water-treated control animals (4.9 ± 0.2 cm vs. 7.8 ± 0.3 cm) reflecting inflammation-induced scarring. As in the acute model, the colons of animals treated with Compound 62 or Dipentum were of intermediate length (6.2 ± 0.2 and 6.1 ± 0.2 cm, respectively). This is a significant finding since the animals were untreated for the first and second DSS cycles. Therefore, suppression of inflammation-induced colon contraction can be reversed by effective anti-IBD drugs.<br>
Immunohistochemistry revealed that SK expression was present in low levels in the colons of control, non-DSS treated mice. SK expression was elevated in the colons of DSS<br>
treated mice compared to water controls with this expression clearly reduced in DSS mice also receiving Compound 62.<br>
   SIP levels in the colons of the chronic colitis model mice were assessed in an identical manner as described for the acute model, and revealed results similar to those in the acute model with elevated SIP levels in DSS alone treated mice as compared to water controls (Figure 14). Treatment with Compound 62 (oral 50mg/kg daily; 7 days prior to sacrifice) resulted in significant reductions of SIP levels (Figure 14).<br>
The levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFα, IL-1ß, EFN- and DL-6 were substantially increased in the colons of mice treated chronically with DSS; whereas, the level of IL-10 was unchanged (Figure 15). Mice treated with Compound 62 during the final DSS cycle had reduced levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, while animals treated with Dipentum expressed cytokine profiles equivalent to the DSS-alone group. This may reflect the presence of high numbers of resident immune cells in the colons of mice exposed chronically to DSS. However, the elevation in cytokine levels in the SK inhibitor-treated mice does not result in increased DAI or colon shortening, indicating that signaling induced by the inflammatory cytokines had been blocked.<br>
For comparison, the levels of the same cytokines in the serum of the mice at the time of sacrifice were also determined. As indicated in Figure 16, the circulating levels of these cytokines are markedly lower than the colonic levels reflecting the local inflammation in this model. DSS increased the circulating levels of IL-1ß, IFN-, IL-6 and IL-10, while TNFα remained below the detection limit of the assay. None of the test compounds affected the circulating levels of IL-lß or INF-; however, both Compound 62 and Dipentum reduced the serum level of IL-6. Therefore, serum levels of IL-6 may be a useful pharmacodynamic marker for the anti-inflammatory effects of the SK inhibitors during clinical testing.<br>
Example 25. In vivo effects of SK inhibitors in the Collagen-Induced Arthritis model in mice.<br>
The anti-arthritis activities of the SK inhibitor Compound 62 were assessed in the Collagen-Induced Arthritis (CIA) model. Female DBA/1 mice were injected subcutaneously in the tail with chicken immunization-grade type II collagen (Chondrex) emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma) at 2 mg/mL. Three weeks later, the mice received a collagen booster in incomplete Freund's adjuvant and were monitored daily thereafter for arthritic symptoms. Once mice reached a threshold paw thickness and clinical score, they<br>
were randomized into the following treatment groups: Compound 62 (100 mg/kg given orally each day for 6 days per week) or vehicle (0.375% Tween-80 given under the same schedule). That severity of disease in each animal was quantified by measurement of the hind paw volume with digital calipers. Each paw was scored based upon perceived inflammatory activity, in which each paw receives a score of 0 - 3 as follows: 0 = normal; 1 = mild, but definite redness and swelling of the ankle or wrist, or apparent redness and swelling limited to individual digits, regardless of the number of affected digits; 2 = moderate redness and swelling of the ankle and wrist and 3 = severe redness and swelling of the entire paw including digits, with an overall score ranging from 0-12. Differences among treatment groups were tested using ANOVA.<br>
As indicated in Figure 17, treatment with either SK inhibitor dramatically slowed the inflammation response, measured as either the Average Clinical Score (Figure 10A) or the Average Hind Paw Diameter (Figure 10B), with significant decreases beginning at Day 5 of treatment for both endpoints. By the end of the experiment on Day 12, Compound 62 caused a 90% reduction in the increase in hind paw thickness, and a 67% reduction in clinical score compared with vehicle-treated mice. Since a 30% reduction in symptoms is considered demonstrative of anti-arthritic activity in this assay, the SK inhibitor surpasses the criteria for efficacy in this model.<br>
On Day 12, the mice were euthanized and their hind limbs were removed, stripped of skin and muscle, formalin-fixed, decalcified and paraffin-embedded. The limbs were then sectioned and stained with hematoxylin/eosin. Tibiotarsal joints were evaluated histologically for severity of inflammation and synovial hyperplasia. Collagen-Induced Arthritis resulted in a severe phenotype compared with non-induced mice, manifested as severe inflammation and synovial cell infiltration, as well as significant bone resorption. Mice that had been treated with. Compound 62 had significantly reduced histologic damage, correlating with the paw thickness and clinical score data.<br>
Example 26. In vivo effects of SK inhibitors in the Adjuvant-Induced Arthritis model in rats.<br>
Adjuvant-induced arthritis is another widely used assay that recapitulates many features of human rheumatoid arthritis, and so is useful in the evaluation of new drug candidates. Age- and weight-matched male Lewis rats (150-170 g) were injected subcutaneously in the tail with 1 mg of Mycobacterium butyricum (Difco, killed dried) suspended in 0.1 ml of light mineral oil. Symptoms of immune reactivity were present after 2 weeks. Responsive rats were randomized into treatment groups, and received oral daily<br>
doses (1 ml) of: solvent alone (0.375% Tween-80); 100 mg/kg Compound 62; 35 mg/kg Compound 62; or 5 mg/kg Compound 62, or intraperitoneal injections of indomethacin (5 mg/1%) every other day as a positive control. The severity of disease in each animal was quantified by measurement of the hind paw thickness. As above, a reduction of 30% or greater was considered to be an indication of anti-inflammatory activity in this model. As indicated in Figure 17, solvent alone-treated rats demonstrated a progressive increase in paw thickness over the course of the next 10 days. Compound 62 inhibited this arthritic response in a dose-dependent manner, with the highest dose having similar therapeutic efficacy as indomethacin. Compound 62 at doses of 5,35 or 100 mg/kg resulted in 13,42 and 76 percent reductions in the arthritic response, respectively. Thus, Compound 62 is highly effective in this arthritis model. <br><br><br><br>
