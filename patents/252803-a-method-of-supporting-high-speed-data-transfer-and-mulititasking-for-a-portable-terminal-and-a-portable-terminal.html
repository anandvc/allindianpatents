				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
	The present invention relates generally to a portable terminal having a mass<br>
storage secondary memory such as a hard disk. More particularly, the present invention<br>
relates to a portable terminal having a mass storage secondary memory where high-speed<br>
data transfer and multitasking can be supported by using the mass storage secondary memory<br>
as a portable disk of an external apparatus, and to a method of supporting high-speed data<br>
transfer and multitasking for the portable terminal.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
	Recent rapid advances in information and communications technologies have<br>
allowed a mobile communication subscriber to use a conventional portable terminal to obtain<br>
traditional communication services such as voice telephone services and data communication<br>
services such as electronic mail, web browsing, and visual chatting services over wireless<br>
data networks. The mobile communication subscriber can also download various contents<br>
such as music files, moving images, still images, and games from favorite content providers<br>
and store the downloaded contents in the portable terminal for present and future enjoyment.<br>
	A portable terminal with the additional functionality of a camcorder, camera,<br>
or a moving picture experts group (MPEG) audio layer 3 (MP3) player has been developed.<br>
Therefore, a mobile communication subscriber can now use a single portable terminal to<br>
capture still or moving images, store them in the portable terminal, reproduce them with the<br>
portable terminal, or download and reproduce MP3 files.<br>
	Since memory used to store data for a conventional portable terminal is<br>
provided on an internal circuit board, the capacity of the memory is preset during the<br>
manufacturing processes. Therefore, the amount of data that the user can store in the<br>
memory is limited by the preset capacity. For example, the quantity of music files or still and<br>
moving images capable of being stored in the memory will depend on the preset capacity.<br>
	The portable terminal may have a flash memory for storing control programs<br>
to control an operation and function of the portable terminal, and a random access memory<br><br>
(RAM) for running the control programs. The flash memory is a nonvolatile memory used to<br>
store user data files as well as the control programs. Consequently, there is a need for a<br>
portable terminal with a large-capacity memory corresponding to diverse functions of the<br>
portable terminal and a large amount of user data.<br>
	FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating the configuration of a conventional<br>
portable terminal with a mass storage secondary memory.<br>
	The portable terminal comprises a main controller 20 for controlling ordinary<br>
communication functions of the portable terminal, and a sub-controller 40 for controlling<br>
added functions regarding, for example, multimedia.<br>
	The portable terminal also comprises a communication module 32, a key input<br>
unit 34, a basic information memory 36, a coder/decoder (CODEC) 38, a display unit 44, and<br>
a multimedia information memory 46. The communication module 32 is used for external<br>
communication over wireless networks according to the control of the main controller 20 and<br>
the key input unit 34 inputs a user command. The basic information memory 36 stores data<br>
concerning ordinary communication functions of the portable terminal such as use of voice<br>
telephone services. The CODEC 38 codes and decodes input/output audio signals, the<br>
display unit 44 displays operation states of the portable terminal, and the multimedia<br>
information memory 46 stores data concerning added functions of the portable terminal.<br>
	Due to a storage capacity limit of the basic memory 36 and multimedia<br>
information memory 46, the portable terminal further comprises a hard disk 60, which is a<br>
mass storage secondary memory capable of storing a large amount of data. The hard disk 60<br>
is connected through a buffer 52 and hard disk controller 54 to the sub-controller 40. The<br>
buffer 52 acts to selectively output received data to the hard disk controller 54 according to<br>
the control of the sub-controller 40. The hard disk controller 54 controls drive of the hard<br>
disk 60, and data read and write operations thereof. The hard disk controller 54 writes data<br>
input from the sub-controller 40 through the buffer 52 on the hard disk 60, and reads data<br>
stored on the hard disk 60 and transfers the read data to the sub-controller 40 in response to a<br>
command from the sub-controller 40.<br>
	The main and sub controllers 20 and 40 each comprise an interface to an<br>
external electronic device, and can be connected through the interface to the external<br>
electronic device to send or receive certain data to or from the external electronic device.<br>
That is, the main and sub controllers 20 and 40 comprise universal serial bus (USB) full<br>
speed (FS) interfaces 22 and 42, respectively. The main controller 20 and sub-controller 40<br><br>
are connected to a USB interface of a computer 10 to send data to the computer 10 or to<br>
receive data from the computer 10. The USB FS interfaces 22 and 42 support the FS data<br>
rate of the USB version 2.0, whose maximum data rate is 12 Mbits/sec.<br>
	Therefore, the main controller 20 can be connected through the USB FS<br>
interface 22 to the computer 10 via a USB cable, and can send or receive data related to<br>
ordinary voice telephone services such as a telephone number file and a ring tone file to or<br>
from the computer 10 at a data rate of 12 Mbits/sec, respectively.<br>
	The sub-controller 40 can be connected through the USB FS interface 42 to<br>
the computer 10 via a USB cable, and can send or receive multimedia data such as MP3<br>
music files and photographed images to or from the computer 10 at a data rate of 12<br>
Mbits/sec, respectively.<br>
	The main and sub controllers 20 and 40 may set a portable disk mode, in<br>
which they store data received through the USB FS interfaces 22 and 42, respectively, on the<br>
hard disk 60.<br>
	FIG. 2 illustrates a data transfer path from the connected computer to the<br>
portable terminal. The illustrated data transfer path denotes a path for storing data received<br>
through the USB FS interface 22 of the main controller 20 on the hard disk 60.<br>
	Referring to FIG. 2, data is transmitted from the computer 10 via a USB cable<br>
through the USB FS interface 22 to the main controller 20. The data is then transmitted<br>
through the sub-controller 40, buffer 52, and hard disk controller 54 to the hard disk 60.<br>
	FIG. 3 illustrates another data transfer path from the connected computer to<br>
the portable terminal. The data transfer path denotes a path for storing data received through<br>
the USB FS interface 42 of the sub-controller 40 on the hard disk 60.<br>
	Referring to FIG. 3, data is transmitted from the computer 10 via a USB cable<br>
through the USB FS interface 42 to the sub-controller 40. The data is then transmitted<br>
through the buffer 52 and hard disk controller 54 to the hard disk 60.<br>
	When the hard disk 60 of the portable terminal is used as a portable disk of the<br>
computer 10 acting as a host, data transfer is performed under the control of the main<br>
controller 20 and/or sub-controller 40. This facilitates the blocking of task operations of the<br>
portable terminal other than the data transfer. That is, in the portable disk mode of the<br>
conventional portable terminal, data transmission and reception operations involving the hard<br>
disk 60 are possible. Therefore, the portable disk mode of the conventional portable terminal<br>
does not have the ability to support multitasking.<br><br>
	In the portable disk mode of the conventional portable terminal, data transfer<br>
between the computer 10 and the hard disk 60 is performed through the USB FS interface 22<br>
of the main controller 20 or the USB FS interface 42 of the sub-controller 40. Data<br>
transferred in this manner results in the data transfer rate being lowered to the maximum FS<br>
data rate of 12 Mbits/sec and complex data transfer paths.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
	An aspect of exemplary embodiments of the present invention is to address at<br>
least the above problems and/or disadvantages and to provide at least the advantages<br>
described below. Accordingly, an aspect of an exemplary embodiment of the present<br>
invention is to provide a portable terminal that may have a mass storage secondary memory<br>
and a method for the portable terminal, wherein high-speed data transfer between the mass<br>
storage secondary memory and an external apparatus is possible in a portable disk mode.<br>
	Another object of an exemplary embodiment of the present invention is to<br>
provide a portable terminal that may have a mass storage secondary memory and a method<br>
for the portable terminal, wherein multitasking is supported independently of data transfer<br>
between the mass storage secondary memory and an external apparatus in a portable disk<br>
mode.<br>
	A further object of an exemplary embodiment of the present invention is to<br>
provide a portable terminal that may have a mass storage secondary memory and a method<br>
for the portable terminal, wherein a data transfer path between the mass storage secondary<br>
memory and an external apparatus can be easily set in a portable disk mode.<br>
	According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a data<br>
transfer path setting method is provided to facilitate data exchange between a portable<br>
terminal with a mass storage secondary memory and an external apparatus. A first data path<br>
is set to permit the mass storage secondary memory to operate according to an internal<br>
control of the portable terminal. A determination is made as to whether the portable terminal<br>
is connected to the external apparatus. If the portable terminal is connected to the external<br>
apparatus, a determination is then made as to whether a set command is input to set the mass<br>
storage secondary memory as a portable disk of the external apparatus. If the set command is<br>
input, the first data path is blocked and a second data path is set to permit operation of the<br><br>
mass storage secondary memory according to an external control exercised by the external<br>
apparatus.<br>
	The data transfer path setting method may further comprise additional steps.<br>
A determination is made as to whether a task event occurred according to the internal control<br>
of the portable terminal during data transfer between the external apparatus and mass storage<br>
secondary memory through the second data path. If the task event occurred, the occurred<br>
task event is handled in a multitasking manner independently of the data transfer.<br>
	After the data transfer between the external apparatus and mass storage<br>
secondary memory through the second data path is completed, a determination may be made<br>
as to whether a release command is input to release the second data path. If the release<br>
command is input, the second data path is blocked and the first data path is set again.<br>
	The first data path may be set through the mass storage secondary memory, a<br>
secondary memory controller, and a buffer connected to the secondary memory controller.<br>
The secondary memory controller controls the mass storage secondary memory and the<br>
buffer has an output connection set to permit the mass storage secondary memory to operate<br>
according to the internal control of the portable terminal.<br>
	The second data path is set through a high-speed universal serial bus (USB)<br>
interface supporting a high-speed data rate. The high-speed USB interface may have a<br>
maximum data rate of 480 Mbits/sec. The second data path may be set through the mass<br>
storage secondary memory, the secondary memory controller, and the high-speed USB<br>
interface connected to the secondary memory controller with an output connection set to<br>
permit the mass storage secondary memory to operate according to the external control<br>
exercised by the external apparatus.<br>
	The mass storage secondary memory may be a hard disk.<br>
	According to another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a<br>
portable terminal is provided. The portable terminal comprises a mass storage secondary<br>
memory, a secondary memory controller, a buffer, a high-speed interface, a connection<br>
switcher, and a sub-controller. The secondary memory controller controls an operation of the<br>
mass storage secondary memory and the buffer selectively sets the output connection to the<br>
secondary memory controller to permit the mass storage secondary memory to operate<br>
according to internal control of the portable terminal. The high-speed interface selectively<br>
sets the output connection to the secondary memory controller to permit the mass storage<br>
secondary memory to operate according to the external control outside the portable terminal.<br><br>
The connection switcher senses the connection of an external apparatus exercising the<br>
external control and outputs data input from the external apparatus to a data path set<br>
corresponding to the path setting. The sub-controller blocks the output connection of the<br>
buffer, sets the output connection of the high-speed interface, and initializes the secondary<br>
memory controller to permit the mass storage secondary memory to operate according to the<br>
external control exercised by the external apparatus, in response to a set command to<br>
selectively set a connection between the external apparatus and mass storage secondary<br>
memory after connection of the external apparatus to the connection switcher.<br>
	The portable terminal may comprise a main controller for handling an<br>
occurred task event in a multitasking manner independently of the data transfer if the task<br>
event occurs according to the internal control of the portable terminal during data transfer<br>
between the external apparatus and mass storage secondary memory.<br>
	According to an exemplary implementation, after completion of the data<br>
transfer between the external apparatus and mass storage secondary memory and in response<br>
to an input command, the sub-controller blocks the output connection of the high-speed<br>
interface, re-sets the output connection of the buffer, and re-initializes the secondary memory<br>
controller to permit the mass storage secondary memory to operate according to the internal<br>
control.<br>
	According to an exemplary implementation, the high-speed interface is a high-<br>
speed universal serial bus (USB) interface supporting a high-speed data rate, and the high-<br>
speed USB interface may have a maximum data rate of 480 Mbits/sec. The mass storage<br>
secondary memory may be a hard disk.<br>
	According to an exemplary implementation, the connection switcher is a USB<br>
switcher for sensing the connection of the external apparatus via a USB cable and outputting<br>
the data from the external apparatus through the set data path to at least one of the main<br>
controller, the sub-controller and the high-speed interface.<br>
	The main controller and sub-controller may each comprise a USB full-speed<br>
(FS) interface supporting a USB FS data rate. The USB FS interface may have a maximum<br>
data rate of 12 Mbits/sec.<br>
	According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, when the<br>
hard disk is set as a portable disk controlled by an external apparatus, internal association<br>
between the hard disk and portable terminal is blocked and the hard disk is set to operate as<br>
an independent portable disk of the external apparatus, thereby providing a multitasking<br><br>
capability to the portable terminal. This setting permits the portable terminal to operate<br>
independently of ongoing data transfer between the hard disk and the external apparatus in an<br>
independent portable disk mode. Additionally, when the hard disk is set in an independent<br>
portable disk mode which permits the hard disk to operate independently of the portable<br>
terminal, data transfer between the hard disk and the external apparatus is performed through<br>
the high-speed (HS) interface of a USB version 2.0 supporting a maximum data rate of 480<br>
Mbits/sec. Thus, high-speed data transfer is possible through a high-speed USB interface in<br>
the independent portable disk mode of the portable terminal.<br><br>

	The sub-controller 400 displays the connection information associated with<br>
the computer 100 on the main display 420, and displays information required for selecting a<br>
data transfer path between the computer 100 and a corresponding module through the main<br>
display 420.<br>
	FIGS. 5 to 7 illustrate examples of selectable data transfer paths according to<br>
an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.<br>
	FIG. 5 is a block diagram illustrating a first data transfer path from the<br>
connected computer to the portable terminal. The first data transfer path denotes a path for<br>
storing received data related to ordinary communication functions of the portable terminal in<br>
the first memory 260 through the USB FS interface 210 of the main controller 200.<br>
	Referring to FIG. 5, ordinary voice communication related data is transmitted<br>
from the computer 100 through the USB switcher 320 and the USB FS interface 210 to the<br>
main controller 200. The data is then transmitted from the main controller 200 to the first<br>
memory 260.<br>
	FIG. 6 is a block diagram illustrating a second data transfer path from the<br>
connected computer to the portable terminal. The second data transfer path denotes a path for<br>
storing received data related to multimedia functions of the portable terminal in the second<br>
memory 440 through the USB FS interface 410 of the sub-controller 400.<br>
	Referring to FIG. 6, multimedia data is transmitted from the computer 100<br>
through the USB switcher 320 and the USB FS interface 410 to the sub-controller 400. The<br>
multimedia data is then transmitted from the sub-controller 400 to the second memory 440.<br>
	FIG. 7 is a block diagram illustrating a third data transfer path from the<br>
connected computer to the portable terminal. The third data transfer path denotes a path for<br>
the use of the hard disk 600 as a portable disk of the computer 100, namely a portable disk<br>
mode of the hard disk 600, through the high-speed USB interface 340.<br><br>
	If the data transfer path for the portable disk mode is selected, the sub-<br>
controller 400 blocks output connection of the buffer 520 to disable the buffer 520, initializes<br>
and facilitates the high-speed USB interface 340, and initializes the hard disk controller 540.<br>
	As a result, the connection between the hard disk controller 540 and sub-<br>
controller 400 through the buffer 520 is blocked, and thus a data transfer path is established.<br>
The connection permits the hard disk 600 to operate in a portable disk mode independently of<br>
other task operations of the portable terminal controlled by the main and sub controllers 200<br>
and 400. That is, the data transfer path for the independent portable disk mode established<br>
according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention is a path connecting the .<br>
computer 100 to the hard disk 600. The connection is made through the USB switcher 320,<br>
high-speed USB interface 340 and hard disk controller 540. Accordingly, the hard disk 600<br>
can operate as a portable disk of the computer 100 acting as a host.<br>
	After establishment of the independent portable disk mode, the USB switcher<br>
320 transmits data received from the computer 100 to the high-speed USB interface 340,<br>
which can transfer data up to 480 Mbits/sec. Consequently, high-speed data transfer can be<br>
performed through the high-speed USB interface 340 in the portable disk mode of the<br>
portable terminal according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.<br>
	In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, when a data transfer<br>
path involving the hard disk 600 through high-speed USB interface 340 is set for the portable<br>
disk mode, the output connection of the buffer 520 from the sub-controller 400 leading to the<br>
hard disk 600 is blocked. Hence, the hard disk 600 can operate as a portable disk<br>
independently of other task operations of the portable terminal, thereby enabling multitasking<br>
in the portable terminal.<br>
	In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, if there is a call on the<br>
portable terminal while data is being transferred after establishment of the independent<br>
portable disk mode, the main controller 200 rings and the user can answer the call.<br>
Therefore, the portable terminal of an exemplary embodiment of the present invention can<br>
operate in a multitasking manner independently of the data transfer involving the hard disk<br>
600 in a portable disk mode.<br>
	When a command to terminate the independent portable disk mode is input<br>
after completion of the data transfer to the hard disk 600, the sub-controller 400 unblocks the<br>
output connection of the buffer 520 to enable the buffer 520, disables the high-speed USB<br>
interface 340, and initializes the hard disk controller 540.<br><br>
	As a result, the connection between the computer 100 and hard disk 600<br>
through the high-speed USB interface 340 is blocked, and the connection between the sub-<br>
controller 400 and the hard disk 600 through the buffer 520 is set.<br>
	When the portable terminal is powered up and turned on, the main controller<br>
200 boots the portable terminal, identifies connection of the hard disk 600, accesses a file<br>
system of the portable terminal, and then updates lists of files stored in the memories 260,<br>
440 and 360 as well as on the hard disk 600.<br>
	Afterwards, when the portable terminal is connected to the computer 100, the<br>
portable terminal operates in an independent portable disk mode. When the independent<br>
portable disk mode is terminated, the main controller 200 accesses the file system of the<br>
portable terminal and updates lists of changed files on the hard disk 600.<br>
	FIG. 8 is a flow chart illustrating a method of supporting high-speed data<br>
transfer and multitasking for the portable terminal with a mass storage secondary memory<br>
according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.<br>
	After the portable terminal is powered on, the main controller 200 identifies<br>
connection of the hard disk 600 and updates lists of files stored on the hard disk 600 (S100).<br>
When the USB switcher 320 is connected to the computer 100 via a USB cable, the sub-<br>
controller 400 sets an independent portable disk mode for high-speed data transfer between<br>
the hard disk 600 and computer 100 through the high-speed USB interface 340 (S200). In the<br>
independent portable disk mode, the computer 100 acts as a host of the connected hard disk<br>
600, and the hard disk 600 acts as a local disk of the computer 100. At this time, selected<br>
files can be transferred between the computer 100 and hard disk 600, independently of a task<br>
operation of the portable terminal (S300).<br>
	While the files are being transferred between the computer 100 and hard disk<br>
600, the main controller 200 and sub-controller 400 perform any requested task operation<br>
independently of the ongoing file transfer (S400). As described above, the portable terminal<br>
according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention may have a multitasking<br>
capability, wherein it can perform task operations other than an ongoing portable disk mode<br>
operation involving the hard disk 600.<br>
	When the file transfer between the computer 100 and hard disk 600 is<br>
complete, the sub-controller 400 terminates the independent portable disk mode involving the<br>
hard disk 600 in response to an input command (S500). When the hard disk 600 is connected<br>
to the sub-controller 400 after termination of the independent portable disk mode, the main<br><br>
controller 200 accesses a file system to update lists of newly transferred files to the hard disk<br>
600 (S600) and files stored on the hard disk 600 (S600).<br>
	Accordingly, when the portable terminal with the hard disk 600 is connected<br>
to the external computer 100, an independent portable disk mode is set using the high-speed<br>
USB interface 340. At this point, high-speed data transfer is possible between the computer<br>
100 and hard disk 600. Since the portable terminal can perform a task operation<br>
independently of the ongoing data transfer, the portable terminal may have a multitasking<br>
capability.<br>
	FIG. 9 is a flow chart illustrating the hard disk identification and file list<br>
update step (SI 00) in the method of FIG. 8 in more detail.<br>
	When the power is on (SI 10), the main controller 200 boots the portable<br>
terminal (SI30).<br>
	After booting the portable terminal, the main controller 200 identifies the hard<br>
disk 600 (SI 50), accesses a file system (SI 70), and updates lists of files stored on the hard<br>
disk 600 (SI90).<br>
	FIG. 10 is a flow chart illustrating the independent portable disk mode setting<br>
step (S200) in the method of FIG. 8. In the exemplary embodiment of the present invention,<br>
the sub-controller 400 sets the independent portable disk mode.<br>
	The sub-controller 400 determines whether the computer 100 is connected<br>
through the USB switcher 320 (S210). If the computer 100 is connected through the USB<br>
switcher 320, the sub-controller 400 displays selectable data transfer paths to the computer<br>
100 through the main display 420 (S220). That is, the sub-controller 400 displays<br>
information concerning user selectable data transfer paths connecting the computer to at least<br>
one of the main controller 200 through the USB FS interface 210, the sub-controller 400<br>
through the USB FS interface 410, and the hard disk 600 through the high-speed USB<br>
interface 340.<br>
	If the independent portable disk mode using the data transfer path between the<br>
computer 100 and the hard disk 600 through the high-speed USB interface 340 is not selected<br>
(S230), the sub-controller 400 establishes the selected data transfer path and performs<br>
associated subsequent operations (S240).<br>
	If the independent portable disk mode is selected at step S230, the sub-<br>
controller 400 blocks the output connection of the buffer 520 (S250), activates and initializes<br>
the high-speed USB interface 340 (S260), and initializes the hard disk controller 540 to<br><br>
permit the hard disk 600 to operate according to the control of the computer 100 (S270). As<br>
a result, the data transfer path between the computer 100 and the hard disk 600 through the<br>
high-speed USB interface 340 is established, and the hard disk 600 can operate as a portable<br>
disk of the computer 100, independently of the portable terminal (S280).<br>
	FIG. 11 is a flow chart illustrating the independent portable disk mode<br>
termination step (S500) in the method of FIG. 8.<br>
 The sub-controller 400 determines whether a file transfer between the<br>
computer 100 and the hard disk 600 is complete (S510). If the file transfer is not yet<br>
complete, the sub-controller 400 permits continuation of the file transfer (S520).<br>
	If the file transfer is complete, the sub-controller 400 determines whether the<br>
independent portable disk mode is to be terminated (S530). If an input command is not an<br>
independent portable disk mode termination command, the sub-controller 400 operates in<br>
response to the input command (S540).<br>
If the independent portable disk mode termination command is input, the sub-<br>
controller 400 unblocks the blocked output connection of the buffer 520 (S550), and disables<br>
the high-speed USB interface 340 (S560).<br>
	The sub-controller 400 re-initializes the hard disk controller 540 so as to<br>
permit the hard disk 600 to operate according to the control of the sub-controller 400. This<br>
results in the termination of the independent portable disk mode. The independent portable<br>
disk mode is the mode in which the data transfer path is set between the computer 100 and<br>
the hard disk 600 through the high-speed USB interface 340. Once the independent portable<br>
disk mode is terminated, the hard disk 600 operates according to the control of the sub-<br>
controller 400 (S580).<br>
	Exemplary embodiments of the present invention aim to provide a portable<br>
terminal with a hard disk and a method for the portable terminal. When the hard disk is set as<br>
a portable disk controlled by an external apparatus, internal association between the hard disk<br>
and portable terminal is blocked and the hard disk is set to operate as an independent portable<br>
disk of the external apparatus. This provides a multitasking capability to the portable<br>
terminal. Consequently, the portable terminal can operate independently of ongoing data<br>
transfer between the hard disk and the external apparatus in an independent portable disk<br>
mode.<br>
	Also, data transfer between the hard disk and the external apparatus is<br>
performed through the high-speed (HS) interface of a USB version 2.0 supporting a<br><br>
maximum data rate of 480 Mbits/sec when the hard disk is set in an independent portable disk<br>
mode and permitted to operate independently of the portable terminal. Thus, high-speed data<br>
transfer is possible through a high-speed USB interface in the independent portable disk<br>
mode of the portable terminal.<br>
	While the present invention has been shown and described with reference to<br>
certain exemplary embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that<br>
various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit<br>
