The novel amino substituted pyrimidinone derivatives of the present invention are useful for the treatment of inflammation and immunological diseases. Particularly the compounds of the present invention are useful for the treatment of inflammation and immunological diseases those mediated by cytokines such as TNF-a, IL-1, IL-6, IL-ip, IL-8 and cyclooxygenase such as COX-2 and COX-3. The compounds of the present invention are also useful in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis; osteophorosis; multiple myeloma; uveititis; acute and chronic myelogenous leukemia; ischemic heart disease; atherosclerosis;<br><br>
cancer; ischemic-induced cell damage; pancreatic p cell destruction; osteoarthritis; rheumatoid spondylitis; gouty arthritis; inflammatory bowel disease; adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); psoriasis; Crohn's disease; allergic rhinitis; ulcerative colitis; anaphylaxis; contact dermatitis; asthma; muscle degeneration; cachexia; type I and type II diabetes; bone resorption diseases; ischemia reperfusion injury; atherosclerosis; brain trauma; multiple sclerosis; cerebral malaria; sepsis; septic shock; toxic shock syndrome; fever, and myalgias due to infection; and diseases mediated by HIV-1; HIV-2; HIV-3; cytomegalovirus (CMV); influenza; adenovirus; the herpes viruses (including HSV-1, HSV-2) and herpes zoster vimses.<br>
Background of Invention<br>
It has been reported that Cyclooxygenase enzyme exists in three isoforms, namely, COX-1, COX-2 and COX-3. COX-1 enzyme is essential and primarily responsible for the regulation of gastric fluids whereas COX-2 enzyme is present at the basal levels and is reported to have a major role in the prostaglandin synthesis for inflammatory response. These prostaglandins are known to cause inflammation in the body. Hence, if the synthesis of these prostaglandins is stopped by way of inhibiting COX-2 enzyme, inflammation and its related disorders can be treated. COX-3 possesses glycosylation-dependent cyclooxygenase activity. Comparison of canine COX-3 activity with murine COX-1 and COX-2 demonstrated that this enzyme is selectively inhibited by analgesic/antipyretic drugs such as acetaminophen, phenacetin, antipyrine, and dipyrone, and is potently inhibited by some nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Thus, inhibition of COX-3 could represent a primary central mechanism by which these drugs decrease pain and possibly fever. Recent reports show that inhibitors<br><br>
of COX-1 enzyme causes gastric ulcers, where as selective COX-2 and COX-3 enzyme inhibitors are devoid of this function and hence are found to be safe.<br>
The present invention is concerned with treatment of immunological diseases or inflammation, notably such diseases are mediated by cytokines or cyclooxygenase. The principal elements of the immune system are macrophages or antigen-presenting cells, T cells and B cells. The role of other immune cells such as NK cells, basophils, mast cells and dendritic cells are known, but their role in primary immunologic disorders is uncertain. Macrophages are important mediators of both inflammation and providing the necessary "help" for T cell stimulation and proUferation. Most importantly macrophages make IL-1, IL-12 and TNF-a all of which are potent pro-inflammatory molecules and also provide help for T cells. In addition, activation of macrophages results in the induction of enzymes, such as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and cyclooxygenase-3 (COX-3), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and production of free radicals capable of damaging normal cells. Many factors activate macrophages, including bacterial products, superantigens and interferon gamma (IFN y). It is believed that phosphotyrosine kinases (PTKs) and other undefined cellular kinases are involved in the activation process.<br>
Cytokines are molecules secreted by immune cells that are important in mediating immune responses. Cytokine production may lead to the secretion of other cytokines, altered cellular function, cell division or differentiation. Inflammation is the body's normal response to injury or infection. However, in inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, pathologic inflammatory processes can lead to morbidity and mortality. The cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) plays a central role in the inflammatory response and has been targeted as a point of intervention in inflammatory disease. TNF-a is a<br><br>
polypeptide hormone released by activated macrophages and other cells. At low concentrations, TNF-a participates in the protective inflammatory response by activating leukocytes and promoting their migration to extravascular sites of inflammation (Moser et al, J Clin Invest, 83, 444-55,1989). At higher concentrations, TNF-a can act as a potent hydrogen and induce the production of other pro-inflammatory cytokines (Haworth et al., Eur J Immunol, 21, 2575-79, 1991; Brennan et a/.. Lancet, 2, 244-7, 1989). TNF-a also stimulates the synthesis of acute-phase proteins. In rheumatoid arthritis, a chronic and progressive inflammatory disease affecting about 1 % of the adult U.S. population, TNF-a mediates the cytokine cascade that leads to joint damage and destmction (Arend et al., Arthritis Rheum, 38, 151-60,1995), Inhibitors of TNF-a, including soluble TNF receptors (etanercept) (Goldenberg, Clin Ther, 21, 75-87, 1999) and anti-TNF-a antibody (infliximab) (Luong et aL, Ann Pharmacother, 34, 743-60, 2000), have recently been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as agents for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.<br>
Elevated levels of TNF-a have also been implicated in many other disorders and disease conditions, including cachexia, septic shock syndrome, osteoarthritis, inflammatory bowel disease such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis etc.<br>
Elevated levels of TNF-a and/or IL-1 over basal levels have been implicated in mediating or exacerbating a number of disease states including rheumatoid arthritis; osteoporosis; multiple myeloma; uveititis; acute and chronic myelogenous leukemia; pancreatic (5 cell destruction; osteoarthritis; rheumatoid spondylitis; gouty arthritis; inflammatory bowel disease; adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); psoriasis; Crohn's disease; allergic rhinitis; ulcerative colitis;<br><br>
anaphylaxis; contact dermatitis; asthma; muscle degeneration; cachexia; type I and type II diabetes; bone resorption diseases; ischemia reperfusion injury; atherosclerosis; brain trauma; multiple sclerosis; cerebral malaria; sepsis; septic shock; toxic shock syndrome; fever, and myalgias due to infection. HIV-1, HIV-2, HIV-3, cytomegalovirus (CMV), influenza, adenovirus, the herpes viruses (including HSV-1, HSV-2), and herpes zoster are also exacerbated by TNF-a.<br>
It can be seen that inhibitors of TNF-a are potentially useful in the treatment of a wide variety of diseases. Compounds that inhibit TNF-a have been described in several patents.<br>
Excessive production of IL-6 is implicated in several disease states, it is highly desirable to develop compounds that inhibit IL-6 secretion. Compounds that inhibit IL-6 have been described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,004,813; 5,527,546 and 5,166,137.<br>
The cytokine IL-lp also participates in the inflammatory response. It stimulates thymocyte proliferation, fibroblast growth factor activity, and the release of prostaglandin from synovial cells. Elevated or unregulated levels of the cytokine IL-ip have been associated with a number of inflammatory diseases and other disease states, including but not limited to adult respiratory distress syndrome, allergy, Alzheimer's disease etc. Since overproduction of IL-lp is associated with numerous disease conditions, it is desirable to develop compounds that inhibit the production or activity of IL-ip.<br>
In rheumatoid arthritis models in animals, multiple intra-articular injections of IL-1 have led to an acute and destructive form of arthritis (Chandrasekhar et al.. Clinical Immunol Immunopathol. 55, 382, 1990). In studies using cultured rheumatoid synovial cells, IL-1 is a more potent inducer of stromelysin than TNF-a. (Firestein, Am. J. Pathol. 140, 1309, 1992). At sites of<br><br>
local injection, neutrophil, lymphocyte, and monocyte emigration has been observed. The emigration is attributed to the induction of chemokines (e.g., IL-8), and the up-regulation of adhesion molecules (Dinarello, Eur. Cytokine Netw. 5, 517-531, 1994).<br>
In rheumatoid arthritis, both IL-1 and TNF-a induce synoviocytes and chondrocytes to produce coUagenase and neutral proteases, which leads to tissue destruction within the arthritic joints. In a model of arthritis (collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in rats and mice) intra-articular administration of TNF-a either prior to or after the induction of CIA led to an accelerated onset of arthritis and a more severe course of the disease (Brahn et al., Lymphokine Cytokine Res. 11, 253, 1992; and Cooper, Clin. Exp. Immunol. 898, 244, 1992).<br>
IL-8 has been implicated in exacerbating and/or causing many disease states in which massive neutrophil in filtration into sites of inlammation or injury (e.g., ischemia) is mediated chemotactic nature of IL-8, including, but not limited to, the following: asthma, inflammatory bowl disease, psoriasis, adult respiratory distress syndrome, cardiac and renal reperfusion injury, thrombosis and glomerulonephritis. In addition to the chemotaxis effect on neutrophils, IL-8 has also has ability to activate neutrophils. Thus, reduction in IL-8 levels may lead to diminished neutrophil infiltration.<br>

Described below are the examples of pharmacological assays used for finding out the efficacy of the compounds of the present invention wherein their protocols and results are provided. Rat Carrageenan Paw Edema Test<br>
The carrageenan paw edema test was performed as described by Winter et al (Proc.Soc. Exp Biol Me., Ill, 544, 1962). Male Wistar rats were selected and the body weight were equivalent within each group. The rats were fasted for eighteen hours with free access to water. The rats were dosed orally with the test compound suspended in vehicle containing 0.5% methylcellulose. The control rats were administered the vehicle alone. After one hour the rats were injected with 0.1 ml of 1% Carrageenan solution in 0.9% saline into the sub plantar surface of the right hind paw. Paw thickness was measured using vemier calipers at 0 time, after 2 and 3 hours. The average of foot swelling in drug treated animals was compared with that of control animals. Anti-inflammatory activity was expressed as the percentage inhibition of edema compared with control group [Arzneim-Forsch/Drug Res 43(1), 1, 44-50,1993; Ottemess and Bliven, Laboratory Models for Testing NSAIDs, In Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs, (J. Lombardino, ed.l985)]. The data of the selected compounds in this invention are summarized in Table I. In order to evaluate their role on the ulcer formation, the animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, the stomach removed and flushed with 1% formalin (10ml). The stomach was opened along the greater curvature. The haemorrhagic puncta and sulci were identified macroscopically. The presence or absence of stomach lesions was scored. The<br><br>
incidence of ulceration was calculated from the number of rats that showed atleast one gastric ulcer or haemorrhagic erosion.<br><br>
In vitro gvaluation of Cycloxvgenase-2 (COX-2) inhibition activity<br>
The compounds of this invention exhibited in vitro inhibition of COX-2. The COX-2 inhibition activity of the compounds illustrated in the examples was determined by the following method.<br>
Human Whole Blood Assay<br>
Human whole blood provides a protein and cell rich milieu appropriate for the study of biochemical efficacy of anti-inflammatory compounds such as selective COX-2 inhibitors. Studies have shown that normal human blood does not contain COX-2 enzyme. This is correlating with the observation that COX-2 inhibitors have no effect on prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production in normal blood. These inhibitors are active only after incubation of human blood with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which induces COX-2 production in the blood.<br><br>
Method<br>
Fresh blood was collected in tubes containing potassium EDTA by vein puncture from male volunteers. The subjects should have no apparent inflammatory conditions and not taken NSAIDs for atleast 7 days prior to blood collection. Blood was treated with aspirin in vitro (lO”g/ml, at time zero) to inactivate COX-1, and then with LPS (10”g/ml) along with test agents or vehicle. The blood was incubated for 24 h at 37 “C, after which the tubes were centrifuged, the plasma was separated and stored at -80 °C (J Pharmacol Exp Ther 271, 1705, 1994; Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 96, 7563, 1999). The plasma was assayed for PGE2 using Cayman ELISA kit as per the procedure outlined by the manufacturer (Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, USA). The plasma was also tested for TNF-a, IL-ljS, and IL-6 using appropriate human ELISA kit as per the procedure of manufacturer (Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, USA). Representative results of COX-2 inhibition are shown in Table IL<br><br><br><br>
Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha (TNF-a)<br>
This assay determines the effect of test compounds on the production of TNF-a from human monocytes. Compounds were tested for their ability to downregulate the production of TNF-a in activated monocytes. Test compounds were incubated for three, six and twenty four hours with human monocytes, Lipopolysaccharide was used to stimulate the monocytes. The level of TNF-a was quantitated using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent assay performed in a 96 well format. Representative results of TNF-a inhibition are shown in Table III.<br><br><br><br>
InterIeukin-6(IL-6)<br>
This assay determines the effect of test compounds on the production of IL-6 from human monocytes. Compounds are tested for their abiUty to downregulate the production of IL-6 in activated monocytes. Test compounds were incubated for three, six and twenty four hours with human monocytes. Lipopolysaccharide was used to stimulate the monocytes. The level of Interleukin-6 is quantitated using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent assay performed in a 96 well format. Representative results of IL-6 inhibition are shown in Table IV.<br><br><br><br>
Inhibitory Action on Adjuvant Arthritis<br>
Compounds were assayed for their activity on rat adjuvant induced arthritis according to Theisen-Popp et al., (Agents Actions 42, 50-55,1994). Six - seven weeks old, Wistar rats were weighed, marked and assigned to groups [a negative control group in which arthritis was not induced (non-adjuvant control), a vehicle-treated arthritis control group, test substance treated arthritis group]. Adjuvant induced arthritis was induced by an injection of Mycobacterium butyricum (Difco) suspended in liquid paraffin into the sub-plantar region of the right hind paw (J Pharmacol Exp Ther, 284, 714, 1998). Body weight, contralateral paw volumes were determined at various days (0, 4, 14, 21) for all the groups. The test compound or vehicle was administered orally beginning post injection of adjuvant and continued for 21 days. On day 21, body weight and paw<br><br>
volume of both right and left hind paw, spleen, and thymus weights were determined. In addition, the radiograph of both hind paws was taken to assess the tibio-tarsal joint integrity. Hind limb below the stifle joint was removed and fixed in 1% formalin saline. At the end of the experiment, plasma samples were analysed for cytokines, interleukins and prostaglandins. The presence or absence of lesions in the stomachs was also observed.<br>
Two-factor ('treatment' and 'time') Analysis of Variance with repeated measures on 'time' were applied to the % changes for body weight and foot volumes. A post hoc Dunnetf s test was conducted to compare the effect of treatments to vehicle. A one-way Analysis of Variance was applied to the thymus and spleen weights followed by the Dunnett's test to compare the effect of treatments to vehicle. Dose-response curves for % inhibition in foot volumes on days 4, 14 and 21 were fitted by a 4-parameter logistic function using a nonlinear Least Squares* regression. ID50 was defined as the dose corresponding to a 50% reduction from the vehicle and was derived by interpolation from the fitted 4-parameter equation<br>
In-vitro Anti-Cancer activity<br>
The compounds of the present invention were also tested for anticancer activity. Each test compound was screened against a battery of 60 human cell lines obtained from eight organs. The cell suspensions were diluted according to the particular cell type and the target cell density (5000-40,000 cells per well based on cell growth characteristics) was added into 96-well micro titer plates. Inoculates were allowed a pre-incubation period of 24 h at 37 °C for stabilization. Dilutions at twice the intended test concentrations were added at time zero in 100 |il aliquots to micro titer plate wells. Usually test compounds were evaluated at five 10-fold dilutions. The highest well concentration used in the test is 10""* M.<br><br>
The cells were then incubated in the presence of the test compound for further 48 h in 5% CO2 atmosphere and 100% humidity. After completion of the incubation period the adherent cells were fixed to the plate by means of trichloroacetic acid. After three to five times washing, the cell layer was treated with the protein stain Sulforhodamine B. The optical density, which is proportional to protein mass, was then read by spectrophotometer plate readers at a wavelength of 515 nm. The anticancer activity is shown in figures 1-4.<br>
