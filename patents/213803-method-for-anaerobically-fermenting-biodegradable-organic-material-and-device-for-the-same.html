				<td>Method and device for anaorobically fermenting organic<br>
material.<br>
This invention relates to a method for anaerobically fermenting biodegradable<br>
organic material and device for the same.<br>
This invention relates to a method for anaerctoically<br>
fermenting biologically degradable organic material,<br>
whereby this material is mixed with a quantity of already<br>
fermented material as an inoculum for the active<br>
anaerobic fermentation, and whereby this mixture is<br>
introduced at the top into a fermentation chamber in<br>
which a fermenting mass is situated, which moves from an<br>
inlet situated at the top towards an outlet situated at<br>
the bottom.<br>
By organic material, here in particular the organic<br>
fraction of domestic waste is intended, and of similar<br>
industrial waste and other organic fractions, such as,<br>
for example, slurry from water purification installa-<br>
tions, slurry from the paper industry, or other kinds of<br>
organic slurry.<br>
Methods for anaerobically fermenting organic waste can be<br>
divided into wet and dry manners of fermentation.<br>
With wet fermentation methods, fresh or recycled water is<br>
added to the solid organic waste or slurry in order to<br>
form a highly liquid mash or slurry which can be pumped<br>
easily and which can easily be misted in a fermentation<br>
tank, such mash with 6 to 10% of dry matter, depending on<br>
the viscosity of the starting material to be treated , is<br>
pumped into a fermentation tank and is transformed into<br>
biogas, in mixed fermentation systems, in one or two<br>
phases and with mesophilic or thermophilic temperatures.<br>
Due to the high water content of the material in the<br>
termentation tank, the density in this tank is relatively<br>
uniform, and the produced biogas can easily escape from<br>
the mixed mash.<br>
With a dry fermentation, on the contrary, the quantity of<br>
water which is added is limited, such that a relatively<br>
solid biologically degradable waste is pumped or pushed<br>
into a "dry" fermentation tank by means of special pumps.<br>
For organic fractions originating from domestic waste,<br>
the dry matter content of the material fed into the tank<br>
is between 15 and 45%. For more viscous materials, this<br>
may be up to 10 to 15%.<br>
In most cases, with dry fermentation the material is<br>
pumped at the bottom into the standing tank, whereby gas<br>
is injected in order to obtain a mixing and a horizontal<br>
movement of the material. The tank may also be installed<br>
horizontally and may be provided with a mixing device<br>
which realizes the horizontal movement.<br>
Such method of introducing the material at the bottom of<br>
a standing tank is described in WO 86/0520O. Biogas is<br>
brought into the fermentation tank at different<br>
locations, through the underside, such that thxs<br>
underside is divided into sectors. The biogas provides<br>
for a mixing of the contents of the sectors and a<br>
movement of the fermenting mass from one sector to the<br>
other and finally towards the outlet, also situated at<br>
the bottom.<br>
EP-A-0.476.217 describes a method, whereby a horizontal<br>
fermentation tank with therein a mixing device is used.<br>
After having been mixed with a portion of fermented<br>
material, the biodegradable material is pushed, through a<br>
feeding tube realized as a heat exchanger, into the tank<br>
and in this tank is mixed by a blender, as a result of<br>
which the fermenting mass flows horizontally through the<br>
tank, from one extremity to the other, where it is<br>
discharged at the bottom.<br>
According to EP-A-0.205.721 and EP-A-0.577.209, the<br>
fermentation is performed in a vertical fermentation<br>
tank, without a nixing device therein. The biodegradable<br>
material is mixed with fermented material as an inoculum<br>
and is pumped into the tank at the top.<br>
In the tank, the fermenting mass sinks, as fermenting<br>
material is discharged at the bottom. This latter is<br>
performed by means of a sliding grid moving to and fro<br>
above the flat bottom of the tank, which grid pushes this<br>
fermented material into a screw conveyor device situated<br>
therebelow. This device pushes the fermented material<br>
into another screw functioning as a lock by forming a<br>
stopper of fermented material at its conical outlet.<br>
In the method according to EP-A-0-577.209, moreover, due<br>
to the design of the device, a fraction division into, a<br>
liquid and a solid fraction is obtained, such that the<br>
content of solid matter in the fermentation tank can be<br>
maintained and that the dry matter content of the fed<br>
material, which consists of a mixture of inoculum and<br>
fresh material, is situated between 15 and 40%.<br>
In these fermentation tanks without mixer, it is typical<br>
that the content thereof rises and expands as a result of<br>
the produced biogas. This biogas can not bubble<br>
immediately upward as in a wet tank and can not easily<br>
escape, due to the high viscosity of the material in<br>
which it is created and through which it must weave its<br>
way upward.<br>
In practice, the material will expand as a consequence<br>
thereof, and its density will be reduced by about 10 to<br>
40%. The average density depends on various parameters,<br>
such as the degree of biogas production, the feeding<br>
frequency, the kind of structure of the added material,<br>
and the height of the feeding tank. Depending on the<br>
feeding, the density may vary from 0.7 to 1.2 kg/l.<br>
It was noted that this feeding matter, being a mixture of<br>
fresh biodegradable waste and fermented material or<br>
residue, has a density which mostly is higher than 1.0<br>
kg/l, on account of the fact that the prevailing biogas<br>
during mixing of the fermented material and the fresh<br>
material can escape from the fermented material.<br>
When this feeding matter with fresh material and<br>
inoculum, which, due to the degassification, has obtained<br>
a higher density, is brought at the top into the<br>
fermentation tank in which the material has a lower<br>
density, then, depending on the difference in density,<br>
the dimensions and the diameter of the fermentation tank<br>
and the extraction system thereof, too fast a sinking of<br>
this feeding matter through the mass in the tank can be<br>
noted, such that this feeding matter arrives faster at<br>
the bottom than the remainder of the fermenting mass and,<br>
thus, is discharged from the tank without having<br>
undergone an optimum fermentation.<br>
The invention aims at a method which does not have these<br>
disadvantages and whereby the mixture of fresh material<br>
and fermented material is brought at the top into a<br>
vertical fermentation chamber in which material moves<br>
downward from the top, however, whereby it is avoided<br>
that said added mixture sinks faster than the remainder<br>
of the fermenting mass.<br>
According to the invention, the mixture, before being<br>
added to the fermenting mass and further moving downward<br>
during fermentation, is expanded beforehand until its<br>
density approximately coincides with the density of the<br>
already fermenting mass at the beginning of this downward<br>
movement.<br>
Preferably, the mixture is beforehand expanded or reduced<br>
in density, while being moved upward.<br>
Preferably, a mixture is made of one quantity of fresh<br>
material, together with one to ten quantities of<br>
fermented material.<br>
Preferably, a mixture is treated, having a dry matter<br>
content of 10 to 45%.<br>
The downward movement of the fermenting mass in the<br>
fermentation chamber can take place in a fermentation<br>
tank which is free of any mixer, whereby the mixture is<br>
supplied at the upper side of the fermentation tank,<br>
after it has been reduced in density in an expansion<br>
vessel.<br>
The mixture can be expanded beforehand by means of a<br>
preceding biological prefermentation, by injecting a gas<br>
into the mixture, by beating this mixture or also by<br>
adding chemicals which lead to the release of gasses in<br>
the mixture, or by a combination of two or more of these<br>
procedures.<br>
If the expansion or density reduction is performed by<br>
means of biological pre-fermentation, this can be<br>
performed in an expansion vessel in which the mixture<br>
remains at least 5 minutes, and preferably between 15<br>
minutes and 3 hours.<br>
The sojourn time in the expansion vessel also may be more<br>
than three hours, for example, 3 to 72 hours.<br>
The invention also relates to a device which is<br>
particularly suitable for applying the method according<br>
to any of the preceding forms of embodiment.<br>
Consequently, the invention relates to a device for<br>
anaerobically fermenting organic waste, which device<br>
comprises a fermentation tank with a fermentation<br>
chamber, an outlet for fermented material at the bottom<br>
of this tank, and a biogas outlet at the top and a<br>
feeding device comprising a mixer and which, at the top,<br>
gives out into the fermentation tank, and which is<br>
characterized in that the feeding device comprises at<br>
least an expansion vessel situated between the mixer and<br>
the fermentation tank.<br>
The feeding device also may comprise a pump to wnich the<br>
mixer gives out, whereby the expansion vessel is situated<br>
between the pump and the fermentation tank.<br>
This expansion vessel may be situated at least partially<br>
in the fermentation tank as well as at the exterior side<br>
thereof.<br>
The expansion vessel may be reduced to a supply conduit.<br>
The device may comprise a device for gas injection or an<br>
inlet for chemicals which lead to the release of gasses,<br>
wnich latter connects to the expansion vessel, the mixer<br>
or a pump connected thereto, or a beating device can be<br>
provided in the feeding device.<br>
With the intention of better showing the characteristics<br>
of the invention, hereafter, as an example without any<br>
limitative character, several preferred forms of<br>
embodiment of a method and device for anaerobically<br>
fermenting orqanic material according to the invention<br>
are described, with reference to the accompanying<br>
drawings, wherein:<br>
figure 1 schematically represents a vertical cross-<br>
section of a device for anaerobic fermentation<br>
according to the invention;<br>
figure 2 represents a cross-section according to line<br>
II-II in figure 1;<br>
figure 3 schematically represents a cross-section<br>
analogous to that of figure 1, however, relating to<br>
another form of embodiment;<br>
figure 4 represents a cross-section according to line<br>
IV-IV in figure 3;<br>
figures 5 to 9 represent schematic cross-sections<br>
analogous to those of figures 1 and 3. however,<br>
relating to still other forms of embodiment of the<br>
invention.<br>
The device for anaerobically fermenting organic material,<br>
represented in figures 1 and 2, substantially consists of<br>
a closed fermentation tank 1, which comprises a<br>
fermentation chamber 1A, and a feeding device 2<br>
comprising a transport device 3, a mixer 4, a pump 5 and<br>
an expansion vessel 6, which, at the top, gives out into<br>
the fermentation tank: 1, The outlet of the expansion<br>
vessel 6 at the top forms the inlet 6A of the<br>
fermentation tank 1.<br>
The inlet for material in the fermentation tank 1, thus,<br>
is situated at the top, and the outlet 8, which can be<br>
closed off by a valve 7, is situated below the funnel-<br>
shaped bottom of this fermentation tank 1. This<br>
fermentation tank 1 also may have a flat bottom with an<br>
outlet &amp; in the bottom, possibly by means of screws of<br>
other extraction systems, or an outlet 8 at the underside<br>
of its wall.<br>
In the outlet 8, as represented, transport screws 9 can<br>
be installed. The mixer 4 is connected to this outlet 8<br>
and is situated below an extremity of the transport<br>
device 3, which, in the represented example, is formed by<br>
a transport conveyor- By means of this transport conveyor<br>
or another transport device, such as a screw conveyor,<br>
fresh organic material can be added to the mixer 4.<br>
Downstream of the valve 7, a branch 10, which can be<br>
closed off by a valve 11, connects to the outlet 8,<br>
between two screws 9. In the branch 10, downstream of the<br>
valve 11, a transport screw 12 can also be arranged. The<br>
branch 10 connects to a dewatering device 13.<br>
To the mixer 4, a water conduit 15, which can be closed<br>
off by means of a valve 14, is connected for possibly<br>
supplying water to the mixer 4, as well as a steam<br>
conduit 17, which can be closed off by a valve 16, for<br>
injecting steam in order to heat the material.<br>
The outlet of the mixer 4 connects to the inlet of the<br>
pump 5, whereas the outlet of the pump 5, on one hand,<br>
connects to a conduit 19, which can be closed off by a<br>
valve 18, which conduit 19 serves for transporting off<br>
material, and, on the other hand, connects to the<br>
underside of the expansion vessel 6, by means of a<br>
conduit 20 which possibly can be closed off by a valve<br>
20A.<br>
The expansion vessel 6 penetrates into the fermentation<br>
tank 1 through the funnel-shaped bottom thereof and, with<br>
its opening, gives out into the fermentation tank 1 above<br>
the upper side of the inlet 6A, below or above the level<br>
21 of the fermenting mass in this tank 1.<br>
The expansion vessel 6, for example, is round, as well as<br>
the fermentation tank 1, but has a much smaller diameter.<br>
At the top, an outlet 22 for biogas connects to the<br>
fermentation tank 1.<br>
Fresh material to be treated is introduced into the mixer<br>
4 by means of the transport device 3, together with a<br>
part of the fermented material which is coming through<br>
the opened valve 7 out of the fermentation tank 1 and<br>
further is transported by the screws 9 or another<br>
transport, device to the mixer 4.<br>
In the mixer 4, the fresh material and the fermented<br>
material as an inoculum are mixed in a ratio of one<br>
quantity of fresh material for one to ten quantities of<br>
fermented material.<br>
The dry matter content of the fixture is maintained<br>
between 10 and 45% and preferably between 15 and 45% and,<br>
if necessary or desired, a quantity of water, for<br>
example, waste water, is brougnt into the mixer 4 through<br>
water conduit 15. This water can be supplied hot in order<br>
to bring the final eixture to a temperature of 30 to 42ºC<br>
(mesophilic) or 45 to 60ºC (thermophilic) . If no water<br>
must be added, steam can be injected, by means of the<br>
steam conduit 17, into the mixer 4 in order to tiring the<br>
temperature onto the desired level.<br>
Subsequently, the fixture produced in the mixer 4 is<br>
pumped to the expansion vessel 6 through conduit 20.<br>
Valve 18 is closed and valve 20A is open. In this<br>
expansion vessel 6, the mixture moves upward, as<br>
indicated by arrow p1, whereas, it undergoes a biological<br>
pre-fermentation with the production of biogas.<br>
As a consequence thereof, the mixture will rise in the<br>
expansion vessel 6 and decrease in density. The sojourn<br>
time of the mixture in this expansion vessel 6 is at<br>
least 10 minutes and preferably is situated between 30<br>
minutes and 3 hours.<br>
This sojourn time is chosen such that, when, due to the<br>
pumping in of new mixture, the mixture is pushed out of<br>
the expansion vessel 6 and arrives at the top of the<br>
fermentation tank 1, its density is approximately equal<br>
to the density of the fermenting mass which already has<br>
been present at the top of this fermentation tank 1.<br>
As a result of the formation of biogas, the density of<br>
this pre-fermented supplied mixture, due to rising, is<br>
lower than the density of the fresh supplied mixture<br>
which is pumped by the pump 5 from the mixer 4 into the<br>
expansion vessel 6.<br>
In the fermentation tank 1, the further fermentation<br>
takes place, and the fermenting mass sinks towards the<br>
outlet 8, where it leaves the fermentation tank 1 as<br>
fermented material. The formed biogas is discharged<br>
through outlet 22.<br>
By opening the valve 11, fermented material from outlet 8<br>
gets into branch 10. This material is transported by the<br>
screw 12 to the dewatering device 13, where it is<br>
separated into press water 13A and a press cake 13B,<br>
which are transported off.<br>
It is clear that the device may comprise more than one<br>
expansion vessel 6, whereby the expansion vessels 6, for<br>
example, three expansion vessels 6, are connected to the<br>
pump 5, and whereby preferably, they are equal to each<br>
other and installed in the same manner. In figures 1 and<br>
2, two additional expansion vessels 6 are represented in<br>
dashed line.<br>
The form of embodiment represented in figures 3 and 4<br>
differs from that according to figures 1 and 2 in that<br>
the expansion vessel 6, expansions vessels 6,<br>
respectively, if there are several, is or are provided at<br>
the exterior side on the fermentation tank 1.<br>
In figure 3, moreover in dashed line a conduit 23 is<br>
represented, which forms a bypass of the expansion vessel<br>
6, which bypass, on one hand, connects to the conduit 19<br>
and, on the other hand, branches off in branches 23A<br>
which give out onto the upper side of the fermentation<br>
tank 1 and can be closed off by a valve 24. The outlets<br>
of the branches in the tank 1 form the inlet 6A of this<br>
tank 1.<br>
The functioning is as described above, however, if<br>
desired, through bypass 23, the mixture of inoculum and<br>
fresh material can be brought without expansion into the<br>
fermentation tank 1.<br>
The expansion of the mixture of inoculum and fresh<br>
material does not necessarily have to take place by means<br>
of a pre-fermentation in an expansion vessel 6. This<br>
expansion may also be obtained lay injecting gas, for<br>
example, part of the collected biogas, into the mixture,<br>
whereby/ when being introduced into the fermentation<br>
chamber 1A, the mixture immediately expands, and the<br>
density thereof becomes equal to the density at the<br>
fermenting mass at the top of the fermentation chamber<br>
1A.<br>
This gas can be injected into the expansion vessel 6,<br>
however, this expansion vessel 6 may also be reduced to a<br>
normal conduit, for example, only the bypass 23 with the<br>
valves 24 of the form of embodiment according to figures<br>
3 and 4, whereby the gas is brought under pressure into<br>
the mixture.<br>
In figure 5, such device is represented, whereby thus to<br>
conduit 23, an injection conduit 25 gives out which can<br>
be closed off by a valve 26.<br>
The same effect can be obtained by, instead of injecting<br>
gas, injecting a chemical agent which causes gas<br>
production in the mixture. In figure 5, in dashed line an<br>
inlet 27 of such chemical agent is represented, which<br>
connects to conduit 23 and can be closed off by a valve<br>
28. This chemical agent which causes gas production,<br>
possibly can be added in the mixer 4 or in the pump 5.<br>
Still another possibility for reducing the density of the<br>
mixture of fresh material and inoculum supplied to the<br>
fermentation chamber 1A and for expanding this mixture,<br>
consists in beating this mixture, for example, in the<br>
expansion vessel 6.<br>
In this case, too, the expansion vessel 6 can be reduced<br>
to a conduit 23, whereby the beating can take place by<br>
beating devices 29 in chambers 30 in the branches 23A of<br>
this conduit 23, as represented in figure 6.<br>
The expansion vessel 6 does not necessarily have to<br>
extend over the entire height of the fermentation tank 1.<br>
It may, for example, be a vessel which connects to the<br>
fermentation tank 1 at the exterior, at half the height.<br>
The device does not necessarily have to comprise a pump<br>
5. Instead of a pump, it may comprise another transport<br>
mechanism, such as a screw or the like.<br>
The expansion vessel 6 may also be formed by one or more<br>
compartments 32, bordered by partitions 31, of a vertical<br>
tank 33, whereby then the space outside of the<br>
compartment 32 or the compartments 32 forms, form,<br>
respectively, the fermentation tank 1 with the<br>
fermentation chamber 1A.<br>
It is essential, that the compartment 32 or the compart-<br>
ments 32 gives out, give out, respectively, at the top of<br>
the fermentation chamber 1A, and allow for a certain<br>
upward flow of the mixture to be fermented.<br>
In figure 7, a device with such tank 3 3 is represented. A<br>
partition 31, situated above the conical bottom of the<br>
tank 33, together with a part of the wall of the tank 33<br>
forms a compartment 32 which is closed at the bottom and<br>
open at the top. The mixture of fresh material and<br>
inoculum is introduced into this compartment at the<br>
bottom, where it is expanded by means of biological pre-<br>
fermentation.<br>
In figure 8, a similar device is represented, however, in<br>
this case the partition 31 is directed upwardly inclined,<br>
starting from the inside of the tank. As represented,<br>
this ring can be provided over the entire inner<br>
circumference of the tank 33, such that the compartment<br>
thus forms 3 circle-shaped gutter, or can be provided<br>
locally, such that several trough-shaped compartments 32<br>
are formed at the interior side of the tank 33. which<br>
latter compartments form an expension vessel.<br>
The expansion vessel 6 may not only be situated at an<br>
interior side of the termentation tank 1, as represented<br>
in figures 1 and 2, however, it may also be situated<br>
centrally, around the fermentation tank 1, as represented<br>
in figure 9.<br>
This fermentation tank 1 then is formed by a tubular<br>
