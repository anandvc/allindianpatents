SPEC1-6FICATION<br>
6-FLUOROBICYCLO[3.1.0]HEXANE DERIVATIVES TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to pharmaceutically useful 2-amino-3-alkoxy-6-fluorobicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-2,6-dicarboxylic aC1-6d derivatives. More speC1-6fically, the present invention relates to novel 2-amino-3-alkoxy-6-fluorobicyclo- [3.1.0]hexane-2,6-dicarboxylic aC1-6d derivatives effective for treating and preventing psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, anxiety and its assoC1-6ated diseases, bipolar disorder and epilepsy, as well as neurological diseases such as drug dependence, cognitive disorders, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's chorea, Parkinson's disease, dyskinesia assoC1-6ated with muscular stiffness, cerebral ischemia, cerebral failure, myelopathy and head trauma.<br>
The present invention also relates to the finding that compounds acting as antagonists of mGluR2 and mGluR3, which belong to subgroup II of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR), have therapeutic and prophylactic effects on depressive symptoms.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In recent years, successive cloning studies of the glutamate receptor gene have been conducted, with the finding that glutamate receptors have a surprisingly large<br><br>
f<br>
number of subtypes. At present, glutamate receptors are generally divided into two categories: "ionotropic receptors having an ionic channel structure" and "metabotropic receptors coupled with G-protein" (SC1-6nce, 252.,   597-603, 1992). Further, ionotropic receptors are divided into the following three pharmacological groups: N-methyl-D-aspartic aC1-6d (NMDA), a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole- 4-propionate (AMPA) and kainate (SC1-6nce, 253,,   597-603, 1992), while metabotropic receptors are divided into 8 groups (type 1 to type 8) (J. NeurosC1-6, 13. 1372-1378, 1993; Neuropharmacol., 34, 1-26, 1995).<br>
Also, metabotropic glutamate receptors are divided into three pharmacological groups. Among them, group n receptors (mGluR2/mGluR3) bind to adenylate cyclase and inhibit forskolin-stimulated accumulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) (Trends Pharmacol. SC1-6, 14, 13 (1993)). Thus, it can be concluded that compounds acting as antagonists of group II metabotropic glutamate receptors would be effective for treating or preventing acute and chronic psychiatric and neurological diseases.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a drug that is effective for treating and preventing psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, anxiety and its assoC1-6ated diseases, bipolar disorder and epilepsy, as well as neurological diseases such as drug dependence, cognitive disorders, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's chorea, Parkinson's disease, dyskinesia assoC1-6ated with muscular stiffness, cerebral ischemia, cerebral failure,<br><br>
myelopathy and head trauma, wherein the drug acts as an antagonist of group II metabotropic glutamate receptors.<br>
On the other hand, selective serotonin reuptaKe inhibitors (SSRI), noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors and the like are known as antidepressants, but these inhibitors are not designed based on etiological considerations. Consequently, patients for whom such drugs are not effective are likely to  continue to suffer symptoms of depression and experience a reduced quality of life. Thus, there exists a need to develop a drug that is based on etiological considerations, and that addresses a root cause of depressive symptoms.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a new type of antidepressant that is effective for treating and preventing depressive symptoms for which existing drugs are not effective.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>

Also, they have conducted animal experiments to test compounds having an antagonistic effect on group II metabotropic glutamate receptors, finding that such compounds are highly effective<br><br>
r for treating depressive symptoms.<br>

A compound of Formula [I] has five asymmetric carbon atoms in its bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane ring. Configurations preferred for the present invention are optically active forms having absolute structures represented by Formulae [II] and [III], but they may be present in the form of an enantiomer or an enantiomer mixture including a racemate. Namely, the compound of the present invention encompasses all its optically active forms represented by the following Formulae [II] and [III] and their enantiomer mixtures including racemates and diastereomer mixtures,<br><br><br>
The compound of the present invention can also be present as a hydrate or a solvate with an organic solvent.<br>
Further, when the compounds of Formula [I], [II] or IIII], wherein one or both of R1 and R2  represent other than a hydroxyl group or R3 represents other than a hydrogen atom are ester or amide derivatives, these derivatives have no effect on group II metabotropic glutamate receptors. However, such ester and amide derivatives will be hydrolyzed in the body and hence converted into 2-amino- 3-alkoxy-6-fluorobicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-2,6-dicarboxylic aC1-6d derivatives capable of acting on group II metabotropic glutamate receptors. Thus, these ester and amide derivatives are extremely useful  because  they serve as prodrugs.<br>

Test Example 1 (Antagonistic effect of test drugs on cAMP accumulation in CHO cells modified to stably express metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR2)<br>
Using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum [1% proline, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 ng/ml streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine (added before use)], CHO cells modified to stably express metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR2 were seeded in 96-well plates at a ratio of 1.26 x 104cells/well/0.32 cmz/150 (xl and grown at 37°C under 5% C02 for 2 days. The medium was then replaced by L-glutamine-free medium, and after 4 hours, the supernatant was removed by aspiration. PBS( + )-IBMX (10 mM PBS(-), 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM IBMX) was added in 150 [il aliquots and the plates were incubated for 20 minutes at 37°C under 5% C02. After the supernatant was removed again by aspiration, PBS(+)-IBMX containing 10"5 M forskolin, 30 \tH  glutamic acid and 10"10 to 10'4 M test drug was added in 60 jxl aliquots and the plates were incubated for 15 minutes at 37°C under 5% C02 to study the antagonistic effect of test drugs on the glutamic acid-induced inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation (Control experiments were conducted without adding test drugs. (Tanabe et al.. Neuron, 8, 169-179 (1992)). After addition of ice-cold ethanol (100 \il) to stop the reaction, the supernatant was completely collected into separate plates, evaporated to dryness using an evaporator at normal temperature and then stored at -20°C. The dried samples were assayed for cAMP levels<br><br>
using a cAMP EIA kit (Amersham). The value of control samples was subtracted from each measured cAMP level. The IC50 value, the concentration required for 50% antagonism of inhibitory effect of 30 \Oi  glutamic acid of 10"5 M forskolin-stimulated cAMP level, was determined for each test drug.<br>
The compounds of the present invention represented by Formula [I] wherein R1 and R2  are each a hydroxyl group and R3 is a hydrogen atom, i.e.. Compounds 1-58 in Table 1 showed a strong antagonistic effect (IC50 = 500 nM or less), as measured by this test example. For example. Compounds 1, 6, 22, 28, 34, 42 and 52 had IC50 values of 229 nM, 131 nM, 29.1 nM, 40.8 nM, 20.0 nM, 22.7 nM and 24.4 nM, respectively.<br>
Test Example 2 (Effect of test drugs on [3H]MGS0008 receptor binding in CHO cells modified to stably express metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR2J<br>
Using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum [1% proline, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 ug/ml streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine (added before use)], CHO cells modified to stably express metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR2 were seeded into T-<br>
225 flasks and grown at 37°C under 5% C02. Upon confluency, the cells were washed twice with PBS(-), detached with a<br>
cell scraper, and centrifuged at 4°C at 1000 x g for 15 minutes to collect the cells. The resulting pellet was<br>
stored at -80°C. The pellet was thawed before use and<br><br>
suspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4). The suspension was homogenized with a homogenizer for 20<br>
seconds and then centrifuged at 4°C at 48,000 x g for 20 minutes to obtain a pellet. The pellet was suspended<br>
again in the above buffer, homogenized, incubated at 37°C for 15 minutes, and then centrifuged at 4°C at 48,000 x g for 20 minutes. The resulting pellet was further washed twice by centrifugation and then homogenized in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer {2 mM MgCl2, pH 7.4) to give a membrane fraction. The receptor-binding test was performed at a membrane concentration ranging from 50 to 200 ng/0.5 ml assay. After addition of a test drug and 3 nM [3H]MGS0008, the membrane fraction was incubated at 25°C for 1 hour. The reaction was stopped by suction filtration on a Whatman GF/C filter (pre-soaked in 0.3% polyethylenimine) using a Brandel cell harvester. After suction filtration, the filter was washed three times with ice-cold 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer {2 mM MgCl2, pH 7.4, 3 ml). The filter thus obtained was treated with 10 ml of Aquasol-2 and allowed to stand for 6 hours or longer, followed by measuring the fluorescence activity using a Beckman LS6000 liquid scintillation counter. Non-specific binding was<br>
assayed in the presence of 10 \M  LY354740 and subtracted from each measured binding level. The IC50 value, the concentration required for 50% inhibition of the solvent-induced level of [3H]MGS0008 binding, was determined for each test drug.<br>
The compounds of the present invention represented<br><br>
by Formula [I] wherein Rl and R2 are each a hydroxyl group and R3 is a hydrogen atom, i.e.. Compounds 1-58 in Table 1 showed a strong binding activity to mGluR2 receptors (IC50 = 100 nM or less), as measured by this test example.<br>
