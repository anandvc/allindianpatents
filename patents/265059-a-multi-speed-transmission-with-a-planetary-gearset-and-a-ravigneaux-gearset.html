MULTI SPEED TRANSMISSION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	This invention relates to power transmissions having a planetary gear<br>
arrangement and a Ravigneaux-style gear arrangement.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Passenger vehicles include a powertrain that is comprised of an engine, a<br>
multi-speed transmission, and a differential or final drive. The multi-speed transmission<br>
increases the overall operating range of the vehicle by permitting the engine to operate<br>
through its torque range a number of times. The number of forward speed ratios that are<br>
available in the transmission determines the number of times the engine torque range is<br>
repeated. Early automatic transmissions had two speed ranges. This severely limited the<br>
overall speed range of the vehicle and therefore required a relatively large engine that<br>
could produce a wide speed and torque range. This resulted in the engine operating at a<br>
specific fuel consumption point other than the most efficient point during cruising.<br>
Therefore, manually-shifted (countershaft transmissions) were the most popular.<br>
[0003]	With the advent of three- and four-speed automatic transmissions, the<br>
automatic shifting (planetary gear) transmission increased in popularity with the motoring public. These transmissions improved the operating performance and fuel economy of the vehicle. The increased number of speed ratios reduces the step size between ratios and therefore improves the shift quality of the transmission by making the ratio interchanges substantially imperceptible to the operator under normal vehicle acceleration.<br>
[0004]	It has been suggested that the number of forward speed ratios be increased<br>
to six or more. Six-speed transmissions are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,070,927 issued to Polak on January 31, 1978; and U.S. Patent No. 6,422,969 issued to Raghavan and UsoroonJuly23,2002.<br><br>
2<br>
[0005]	Six-speed transmissions offer several advantages over four- and five-speed<br>
transmissions, including improved vehicle acceleration and improved fuel economy. While many trucks employ power transmissions having six or more forward speed ratios, passenger cars are still manufactured with three- and four-speed automatic transmissions and relatively few five or six-speed devices due to the size and complexity of these transmissions.<br>
[0006]	Seven-speed transmissions are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,623,397<br>
issued to Raghavan, Bucknor and Usoro. Eight speed transmissions are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,425.841 issued to Haka. The Haka transmission utilizes three planetary gear sets and six torque transmitting devices, including two brakes and two clutches, to provide eight forward speed ratios and a reverse speed ratio. One of the planetary gear sets is positioned and operated to establish two fixed speed input members for the remaining two planetary gear sets. Seven-, eight- and nine-speed transmissions provide further improvements in acceleration and fuel economy over six-speed transmissions. However, like the six-speed transmissions discussed above, the development of seven-, eight- and nine-speed transmissions has been precluded because of complexity, size and cost.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007]	A transmission is provided having an input member, an output member,<br>
and a stationary member.  A planetary gearset includes respective first, second, and third<br>
members.   A compound gearset includes respective first, second, third, fourth, and fifth<br>
members.     The  first member of the planetary gearset  is continuously operatively<br>
connected to the input member for unitary rotation therewith.   The first member of the<br>
compound gearset is continously operatively connected to the output member for unitary<br>
rotation therewith.<br>
[0008]	The transmission further includes first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth,<br>
and seventh torque transmitting devices being operative to selectively connect members<br>
of the planetary gearset and the compound gearset with the stationary member or with<br><br>
3<br>
other members of the planetary gearset or the compound gearset to provide at least seven forward speed ratios and a reverse speed ratio.<br>
[0009]	The above features and advantages and other features and advantages of<br>
the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description of the best modes for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0010]	FIGURE 1 is a schematic representation of a transmission in accordance<br>
with the present invention; and<br>
[0011]	FIGURE 2 is a ratio chart and truth table depicting a shift logic for use<br>
with the transmission of Figure 1.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
[0012]	Referring to Figure 1, a transmission 10 for a vehicle is schematically<br>
depicted. The transmission 10 includes a planetary gearset 14 and a compound gearset 16. Planetary gearset 14 includes a sun gear member 18, a ring gear member 22, and a planet carrier member 26. Planet carrier member 26 rotatably supports a planetary pinion gear member 30, which is meshingly engaged with ring gear member 22 and with sun gear member 18.<br>
[0013]	Compound gearset 16 includes sun gear member 34, sun gear member 38,<br>
ring gear member 42, ring gear member 46, and planet carrier member 50. Planet carrier member 50 rotatably supports planetary pinion member 54 and planetary pinion member 58. Planetary pinion member 54 is meshingly engaged with sun gear member 38 and with ring gear member 46. Planetary pinion member 58 is meshingly engaged with sun gear member 34, ring gear member 42, and planetary pinion member 54. Compound gearset 16 is a Ravigneaux gearset in which long pinion 54 does not belong to the same kinematic chain between the sun gear 34 and the ring gear 42.<br><br>
4<br>
[0014]	It should be noted that, where used in the claims, first, second, third,<br>
fourth, and fifth members of planetary or compound gearsets do not necessarily refer to a member of a particular type; thus, for example, a first member may be any one of a ring gear member, sun gear member, or planet carrier member.<br>
[0015]	The transmission includes an input member such as input shaft 62.  Input<br>
shaft 62 is continously connected to sun gear member 18 for unitary rotation therewith. Input shaft 62 is connectable to the output member of an engine (not shown) such as a crankshaft, either directly or through a torque converter (not shown). An output member, such as output shaft 66, is continuously connected to ring gear member 42 for unitary rotation therewith. Output shaft 66 is connectable to a vehicle final drive system (not shown) to drive vehicle wheels (not shown) or other tractive device. Shaft 70 is continuously connected to planet carrier member 50 for unitary rotation therewith. Sleeve 74 is concentrically positioned around shaft 70, and is continuously connected to sun gear member 34 for unitary rotation therewith.<br>
[0016]	The transmission 10 includes a plurality of selectively engagable torque-<br>
transmitting devices, or clutches, C1-C7. Clutch C1 is a brake that is selectively engageable to ground ring gear member 22 to a stationary member such as the transmission housing 78. Clutch C2 is a brake that is selectively engageable to ground planet carrier member 26 to transmission housing 78. Clutch C3 is selectively engageable to couple planet carrier member 26 to sun gear member 38 for unitary rotation therewith. Clutch C4 is selectively engageable to couple ring gear member 22 to ring gear member 46 for unitary rotation therewith. Clutch C5 is selectively engageable to couple planet carrier member 26 to sleeve 74 and sun gear member 34 for unitary rotation. Clutch C6 is selectively engageable to couple the input shaft 62 and sun gear member 18 to sleeve 74 and sun gear member 34 for unitary rotation. Clutch C7 is selectively engageable to couple input shaft 62 and sun gear member 18 to shaft 70 and planet carrier member 50 for unitary rotation.<br>
[0017]	An electronic control unit (not shown) is preferably employed to control<br>
the engagement of the torque transmitting devices C1-C7 via hydraulic actuation in a manner understood by those skilled in the art.<br><br>
5<br>
[0018]	Referring to Figure 2, a shift logic sequence for clutches C1-C7 is<br>
depicted that provides seven forward speed ratios and one reverse speed ratio between the input member 62 and the output member 66. Referring to Figures 1 and 2, a first forward speed ratio is achieved when clutches C1, C3, and C4 are engaged. A second forward speed ratio is achieved when clutches C1, C3, and C5 are engaged. A third forward speed ratio is achieved when clutches C1, C3, and C6 are engaged. A fourth forward speed ratio is achieved when clutches C1, C3, and C7 are engaged. A fifth forward speed ratio is achieved when clutches C1, C7, and C6 are engaged. A sixth forward speed ratio is achieved when clutches C1, C7, and C5 are engaged. A seventh forward speed ratio is achieved when clutches C2, C5, and C7 are engaged. A reverse speed ratio is achieved when clutches C2. C3, and C4 are engaged.<br>
[0019]	It should be noted, as apparent from Figure 2, that single step speed ratio<br>
interchanges between all adjacent forward speed ratios is accomplished by single<br>
transition shifting wherein only one clutch is released and only one clutch is engaged to<br>
accomplish the speed ratio shift.   It should be further noted that the planetary gearset<br>
generates underdrive ratios in the first speed ratio through the sixth speed ratio.<br>
[0020]	While the best mode for carrying out the invention has been described in<br>
detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention relates will recognize various alternative designs and embodiments for practicing the invention within the scope of the appended claims.<br><br>
