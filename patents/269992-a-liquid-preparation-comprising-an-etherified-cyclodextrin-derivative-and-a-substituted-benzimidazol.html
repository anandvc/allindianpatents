				<td>LIQUID PREPARATION COMPRISING PIMOBENDAN<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to the field of medicine In particular, the invention relates to novel liquid preparation comprising a substituted benzimidazol, preferably pimobendan as pharmaceutical^ active compound<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Pimobendan is a well-known compound for the treatment of congestive heart failure (CHF) originating for example from dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) or decompensated endocardiosis (DCE) in animals, especially dogs (WO 2005/092343) Pimobendan is also approved as a drug product for cardiovascular treatment of humans<br>
Pimobendan (4,5-dihydro-6-[2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1H-benzimidazol-5-yl]-5-methyl-3(2H)-pyndazinone) is disclosed in EPB-008 391, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety, and having the formula<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
As already was described in EP A-439 030 and WO 2005/08467, pimobendan drug substance is insoluble in water, 1 g substance is soluble in more than 10000 ml At pH 7 the solubility of pimobendan is about 0 1 mg per 100 ml<br>
The substance is administered by the oral route twice daily Yet no liquid preparation comprising pimobendan is available In order to achieve an immediate onset of action for all the innovative indications mentioned above, an injectable solution for parenteral administration by the i v and/or s c route is obligatory An aqueous formulation is required to administer a drug product by the i v / s c route to either humans or animals, formulations with a non-aqueous solvent are neither acceptable nor state of the art due to the risk of severe tolerance problems<br>
Solubility in aqueous solutions is depending on the pH The solubility of pimobendan is significantly higher at pH 1 to 3, however, the chemical stability in solution is reduced so that a stable solution with a reasonable shelf-life cannot be achieved In addition, the local tolerance of such a formulation is very poor This is due to the fact that the target dose would require a drug concentration in solution which can only be achieved by a pH of about pH3 and lower The required concentration in solution exceeds the solubility of pimobendan in water by a factor of about 250, a factor of 1 to 1000 might be the maximum required increase<br>
Certain ethenfied beta-cyclodextnn derivatives are known to improve solubility of sparingly soluble drugs (WO85/02767) However, in WO85/02767 only the use of ethenfied beta-cyclodextnn derivatives up to a concentration of 10 % is described A molar ratio of drug to ethenfied beta-cyclodextnn derivative of 1 6 to 4 1 was thought The solubility of flubendazol within the above given ratio was only increased by a factor 30 However, those formulations are not suitable for the preparation of liquid preparations comprising pimobendan, or any other substituted benzimidazol in therapeutically effective amounts of up to 5 mg/ml, preferably of 0 5 to 3 mg/ml, even more preferably of 0 5 to 15 mg/ml As mentioned above, at least pimobendan formulation comprising up to 1 5 mg/ml needs an increase in solubility at pH 7 by a factor of about 1000 to 1500<br>
The objective underlying the present invention was to provide liquid preparations comprising a substituted benzimidazol, preferably pimobendan as pharmaceutically active compound<br>
The objective underlying the present invention was to provide a pharmaceutically acceptable solution comprising a substituted benzimidazol, preferably pimobendan as pharmaceutically active compound<br>
Another objective underlying the present invention was to provide injectable solutions comprising a substituted benzimidazol, preferably pimobendan as pharmaceutically active compound<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Description of the Figures<br>
Figures  1   and  2  show the  saturated  solubility of pimobendan,  a  substituted<br>
benzimidazol in an aqueous solution comprising various concentrations of the<br>
ethenfied cyclodextnn derivative hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrm (HPßCD)  at pH 3,<br>
5, and 7<br>
Figure 3 shows the saturated solubility of pimobendan, a substituted benzimidazol in an aqueous solution comprising various 20 to 25 % (w/v) of the ethenfied cyclodextnn-denvative hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrm (HPßCD)  dissolved in 10 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7<br>
Figure 4 shows the saturated solubility of pimobendan, a substituted benzimidazol in an aqueous solution comprising 24 % (w/v) of the ethenfied cyclodextnn-denvative hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrm (HPßCD)  dissolved in 10 mM phosphate buffer and sodium chloride at pH 7<br>
Figure 5 shows the effect of autoclaving on the soluble formulation of pimobendan, a substituted benzimidazol<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Before the embodiments of the present invention it shall be noted that as used herein and in the appended claims, the singular forms "a", "an", and "the" include plural reference unless the context clearly dictates otherwise Thus, for example, reference to "a preparation" includes a plurality of such preparations, reference to the "carrier" is a reference to one or more carriers and equivalents thereof known to those skilled in the art, and so forth Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meanings as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs All given ranges and values may vary by 1 to 5 % unless indicated otherwise or known otherwise by the person skilled in the art, therefore, the term "about" was omitted from the description Although any methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in<br>
the practice or testing of the present invention, the preferred methods, devices, and materials are now described All publications mentioned herein are incorporated herein by reference for the purpose of describing and disclosing the substances, excipients, carriers, and methodologies as reported in the publications which might be used in connection with the invention Nothing herein is to be construed as an admission that the invention is not entitled to antedate such disclosure by virtue of prior invention<br>
The solution to the above technical problem is achieved by the description and the embodiments characterized in the claims<br>
The present invention is based on the unexpected observation that a non-linear relationship exists between the rise in concentration of hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPßCD) , an ethenfied cyclodextnn derivative, and the increase in solubility of pimobendan a structurally member of a substituted benzimidazol at a pH of about 5 or 7 Solutions containing a target concentration for pimobendan of about<br>
0	5 to 1 5 mg/ml could be obtained by the use of HPßCD concentration of more than 15 %, preferably of about 20% (w/v) to up to 70% (w/v) of the final formulation Figure<br>
1	teaches, that based on such a non-linear relationship, a HPßCD concentration of more than 20 (w/v) caused in a significant increased solubility of pimobendan, which is used in an exemplanly manner for a substituted benzimidazol In general, by "(w/v)" as used herein is meant weight of substance per volume of the final preparation/formulation<br>
In addition, it was an unexpected observation that the solubility enhancement achieved by HPßCD did not decrease at an increasing pH Solubility of pimobendan at low pH values was in principle higher than at higher pH values This effect was already known from WO 2005/08467 This also was found for solutions comprising the ethenfied cyclodextnn derivative HPßCD (See Figure 1) However, this effect surprisingly is reversed at pH 7 0 The solubility of pimobendan at pH 5 in the presence of HPßCD was significantly reduced as compared to pH 3 Contrary, at pH 7 the solubility of pimobendan in the presence of HPßCD is significantly higher than<br>
that pH 5 The relationship between increasing HPßCD concentrations (by mass) and increase in saturated solubility of pimobendan was linear at pH 3, but non-linear at pH 7 (see Figure 1) The higher the concentration of HPßCD the higher the solubility of pimobendan This non-linear effects allows an increase of solubility of more than factor 1000, which is needed for the preparation of liquid preparation of pimobendan, or any other substituted benzimidazol comprising therapeutically effective amounts of those active ingredients<br>

However, it is shown by the present invention, that the salt might reduce the solubility of pimobendan in the presence of fix amount of HPßCD There are two ways to overcome this problem The first option is to further increase the concentration of HPßCD The other way is to keep restrict the amount of salts It was shown, that after addition of phosphates resulting in an osmolality of about 300 mOsm/Kg the solubility of pimobendan in an exemplanly manner was not affected Thus, according to a further aspect, the present invention relates to any of the above mentioned liquid preparations, preferably to aqueous solutions for injection, that comprise an ethenfied cyclodextnn derivative as described herein, preferably HP(3CD, and a substituted benzimidazol as described herein, preferably pimobendan, wherein such liquid preparation contains an osmolality of about 250 to 350 mOsm/Kg, preferably of about 270 to 320 mOsm/Kg, even more preferably of about 280 to 300 mOsm/Kg A person skilled in the art is able to adjust the osmolality of any of such liquid preparations to the above mentioned ranges by means well known in the art For example, a liquid preparation that comprises about 24 % (w/v) HPßCD and 0 75 mg/ml pimobendan may contain 10 mM of an alkali phosphate, preferably of sodium phosphate to adjust the osmolality of the final liquid preparation to about 290 to 300 mOsm/kg<br>
The pH of the liquid preparation according to the invention is preferably between 5 5 and 8 5 In particular, in case of an injectable solution, the pH is preferably between 6 5 and 7 5 Preferred buffer systems that can be used to adjust the pH to 6 5 to 7 5 are, for example, phosphate, acetate and citrate buffer systems Preparations of any of those buffer systems are described for example in the European Pharmacopoeia (5th Edition 2005, European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines (EDQM), European Pharmacopoeia, 226 avenue de Colmar, F-67029 Strasbourg, France, http //www pheur org) Thus, according to a further aspect, the present invention relates to any of the above mentioned liquid preparations, preferably to aqueous solutions for injection, that comprise an ethenfied cyclodextnn derivative as described herein, preferably HPßCD, and a substituted benzimidazol as described herein, preferably pimobendan, wherein such liquid preparation is adjusted to pH 5 5 to 8 5, preferably to pH 6 5 to 7 5 in case of an injectable solution<br>
As described above, a preferred embodiment of the present invention relates to an injectable solution adjusted to pH 6 to 7 5, that comprise an ethenfied cyclodextnn derivative as described herein, preferably HPßCD, and a substituted benzimidazol as described herein, preferably pimobendan In such case, the preparation of an isotonic solution would further be preferred<br>
In order to achieve an immediate onset of action of the substituted benzimidazol, preferably of pimobendan for all suitable indications, an injectable solution for parenteral administration by the i v and/or s c route is obligatory An aqueous formulation is required to administer a drug product by the i v / s c route to either humans or animals, formulations with a non-aqueous solvent are neither acceptable nor state of the art due to the risk of severe tolerance problems<br>
Thus according to a further aspect, the current invention relates to an injectable solution, i e for parenteral administration by the i v and/or s c route, comprising any of the liquid preparation as described above It might be useful to administer the drug continuously over a defined period of time and not in a one-shot application In such case, administration of an aqueous solution comprising the substituted bemmidazol, preferably pimobendan by infusion is advantageous Thus according to a further aspect, the current invention relates to an injectable solution for infusion, comprising any of the liquid preparation as described above<br>
A solution is absolutely necessary for i v administration, suspended particles bear a high risk of emboli and have to be excluded Ready-to-use solutions are preferred compared to lyophihsed products which have to be reconstituted by adding a diluent / solvent before administration The reconstitution of a drug product to be administered will add several minutes to the treatment which has to be avoided in a life-threatening situation as this In addition local tolerance will depend on the isotonicity and pH range of the formulation A pH in the neutral range of about pH 7 is usually preferred, the higher the actual pH deviates from this target the more likely the risk of not acceptable local tolerance<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
The following examples serve to further illustrate the present invention, but the same<br>
should not be construed as a limitation of the scope of the invention disclosed herein<br>
Example 1<br>
Solubility of pimobendan in the presence of hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextnn<br>
(HPßCD)  at different pH values<br>
The solubility of pimobendan, a substituted benzimidazol, was tested at various concentrations of hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextnn (HPßCD) and at pH 3, 5 and 7 Kleptose® HP (Roquette, France) was used as HPßCD of pharmaceutical grade Saturated solubility of pimobendan was investigated at 10 to 40% (w/v) of HPßCD at pH 3, 5, and 7 The solutions were buffered with a sodium phosphate solution The sample solutions were prepared using the following method<br><br>
a)	Approximately 3 ml of the solution under test was placed in a 7 ml glass vial with a magnetic stirring bar<br>
b)	The pH was adjusted with hydrochloric acid<br>
c)	An excess of pimobendan was added The sample was placed in an ultrasonic bath and sonicated for 5 mm to ensure an excess of pimobendan was present and more added if required,<br>
d)	The samples were placed in a water bath at 25°C and stirred for at least 16 hours<br>
e)	The samples were filtered using 0 2 urn PVDF syringe filter<br>
f)	The samples were assayed by HPLC<br>
The results are shown in Figure 1 and 2 It was surprisingly found that due to a nonlinear relationship between the rise in concentration of HPßCD and the increase in solubility of pimobendan both at a pH of about 5 or 7, solutions containing the target concentration for pimobendan could be obtained by the use of (HPßCD) concentration of more than 15 % (see Figure 1) In addition, it was an unexpected observation that the solubility enhancement achieved by HPßCD did not increase with decreasing pH, but that at pH 7 the solubility at a certain HPßCD concentration was lower at pH 7 than at pH 3, but higher than at pH 5 The relationship between increase of HPßCD concentration (by mass) and increase in saturated solubility of pimobendan was linear at pH 3, but non-linear at pH 5 and pH 7 (see Figure 2)<br>
Example 2<br>
Formulation Development<br>
1  Level of hvdroxvpropvl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPßCD)<br>
Saturated solubility of pimobendan was investigated at 20 to 25% (w/v) of HPßCD in 10 mM phosphate buffer pH 7 0 The study was carried out on three different batches of HPßCD and each solution tested in duplicate (see Figure 3) The solutions were prepared using the following method<br>
a) Approximately 3 ml of the solution under test was placed in a 7 ml glass vial with a magnetic stirring bar<br>
b)	An excess of pimobendan was added The sample was placed in an ultrasonic bath and sonicated for 5 mm to ensure an excess of pimobendan was present and more added if required<br>
c)	The samples were placed in a water bath at 25°C and stirred for at least 16 hours<br>
d)	The samples were filtered using 0 2 urn PVDF syringe filter<br>
e)	The samples were assayed by HPLC<br>
A level of 22 to 24% (w/v) HPßCD was chosen for the formulations comprising 0 5, 0 75 and 1 0 mg/ml pimobendan<br>
2	Osmolality<br>
An isotonic solution was required for the formulation The formulation with 24% (w/v) HPßCD and 10 mM phosphate buffer had an osmolality of 287 mOsm/Kg Sodium chloride was added to increase the osmolality to 303 mOsm/Kg Saturated solubility of pimobendan 0 75 mg/ml at 24% (w/v) HPßCD were investigated and results were compared with those formulations that were not supplemented with sodium chloride Results are shown in Figure 4 The amount of soluble pimobendan dramatically decrease from about 1 23 mg/ml to about 0 71 mg/ml<br>
3	Physical Stability<br>
A sample of the final formulation comprising 24% (w/v) HPßCD, 0 75 mg/ml pimobendan, 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7 0 was filtered through a 0 2 urn syringe PVDF filter into two screw cap class vials One vial was stored at room temperature and the other at 5°C Samples were assessed initially, after one and after two weeks for changes in appearance and sign of precipitation No changes in appearance and no sign of precipitation were observed<br>
3 Filter studies and Autoclavinq studies<br>
A) A sample of the final formulation comprising 24% (w/v) HPßCD, 0 75 mg/ml pimobendan, 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7 0 was filtered through three different filters (Fluorodyne® 0 2 µm (Pall), Durapore®, 0 22 µm (Millipore) and Supor® 0 2 urn (Pall))  For each experiment, 30 ml of the test solution was placed in a 50 ml<br><br>
syringe and then forced through an in-line holder housing a 47 mm membrane of each type Filtrate samples were collected at sampling points 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15 and 25 ml and analyzed to its pimobendan content No change in the pimobendan content was measured for each filter system<br>
B) A sample of the final formulation comprising 24% (w/v) HPßCD, 0 75 mg/ml pimobendan, 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7 0 was filtered through a 0,2 µm syringe PVDF filter and the filtrate was autoclaved at 121°C for 30 mm The results are shown in Figure 5 Only a small amount of degradation was observed when the formulation was autoclaved The level was very low and indicates that the formulation can be autoclaved<br>
Example 3 Manufacturing process<br>
The manufacturing process for the preparation of final formulation comprising HPßCD and pimobendan, is<br>
a)	Weight the HPßCD into the manufacturing container,<br>
b)	Add water to approximately 60% of the final volume,<br>
c)	Mix until HPßCD dissolves using magnetic stirred or paddle stirrer,<br>
d)	Add the buffer components, transfer with water and mix until dissolved,<br>
e)	Check pH to ensure that it is close to pH 7 0 Adjust with sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid if required,<br>
f)	Add pimobendan, transfer with water and mix until dissolved,<br>
g)	Make to volume with water,<br>
h)       Filter the solution and dispense into vials, i)        Autoclave the vials for 30 mm at 121 °C<br>
