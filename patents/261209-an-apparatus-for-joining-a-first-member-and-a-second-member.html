APPARATUS FOR JOINING MEMBERS AND ASSEMBLY THEREOF<br>
Cross-Reference to Related Applications<br>
This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/664,577 by<br>
Hethcock et al., filed 23 March 2005, entitled "Advanced Bonded Compression Joint,"<br>
which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates in general to the field of mechanically-joined<br>
structural assemblies.<br>
Description of the Prior Art<br>
It is desirable for a structural assembly to efficiently transfer loads (e.g., shear<br>
loads) across one or more joints between components of the assembly.<br>
Furthermore, in many structures it is preferred that the loads be substantially<br>
uniformly transferred through the entire structure. Failure to efficiently and uniformly<br>
transfer loads often results in a structure being subjected to stresses concentrated in<br>
localized portions of the structure. Such concentrated, localized stresses may<br>
exceed the design criteria for the structure, even though the overall loading on the<br>
structure is within design criteria.<br>
It is particularly desirable for a structural assembly that includes one or more<br>
adhesively bonded joints to efficiently transfer loads, especially shear loads, across<br>
the bonded joints. If the adhesive bond fails due to concentrated stresses in a<br>
particular portion of the bond, loads will no longer be efficiently transferred between<br>
the members joined by the adhesive bond. As a result, adhesively bonded primary<br>
structure is disregarded from consideration in many applications, such as aircraft<br>
applications.<br>
Moreover, it is desirable for fastener openings or holes to be generated in<br>
parts at a detail fabrication stage, rather than being match-drilled as the parts are<br>
being assembled. Conventional manufacturing methods used to drill fastener holes<br><br>
WO 2006/102566	PCT/US2006/010692<br>
-2-<br>
during the detail fabrication stage often result in the holes being angularly and/or<br>
linearly mismatched when the parts are assembled. Match-drilling is an expensive<br>
process that requires additional tooling and substantial time during the assembly<br>
stage, thus unfavorably impacting product manufacturing flow and cost.<br>
There are many designs of structural assemblies including bolted-bonded<br>
joints well known in the art; however, considerable room for improvement remains.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
There is a need for an improved apparatus for joining members.<br>
Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved<br>
apparatus for joining members and an improved assembly incorporating the<br>
apparatus.<br>
In one aspect, the present invention provides an apparatus for joining a first<br>
member and a second member. The apparatus includes means for joining the first<br>
member and the second member, means for transferring shear loads between the<br>
first member and the second member separate from the means for joining the first<br>
member and the second member, and means for providing a compression preload to<br>
the means for transferring shear loads between the first member and the second<br>
member.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, an assembly is provided. The<br>
assembly includes a first member, a second member, and means for joining the first<br>
member and the second member. The assembly further includes means for<br>
transferring shear loads between the first member and the second member separate<br>
from the means for joining the first member and the second member and means for<br>
providing a compression preload to the means for transferring shear loads between<br>
the first member and the second member.<br>
In yet another aspect, the present invention provides an assembly, including a<br>
first member, a second member, and a joining element joining the first member and<br>
the second member. The assembly further includes a shear load transfer structure<br>
operably associated with the first member and the second member separate from<br><br>
WO 2006/102566	PCT/US2006/010692<br>
-3-<br>
the joining element, and a compression preload feature providing a compression<br>
preload to the shear load transfer structure.<br>
The present invention provides significant advantages, including: (1)<br>
providing lightweight bolted-bonded structural attachments with enhanced strength<br>
and reliability; (2) flexibility at assembly; (3) allowance for in-plane mismatch of<br>
structural components while the selection of thickness and stiffness of the variable<br>
stiffness elements permit gap and angular mismatch of structural components while<br>
retaining the original overall joint stiffness, resulting in consistent joint performance<br>
with reduced assembly time and manufacturing costs; and (4) improvements in static<br>
and fatigued performance with a weight and cost savings over conventional bolted<br>
joints with machined step structure or conventional bonded joints.<br>
Further objects and advantages of this invention will become apparent from a<br>
consideration of the drawings and ensuing description.<br>

the description herein of specific embodiments is not intended to limit the invention to<br>
the particular forms disclosed, but on the contrary, the intention is to cover all<br>
modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the<br>
invention as defined by the appended claims.<br>
Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
Illustrative embodiments of the invention are described below. In the interest<br>
of clarity, not all features of an actual implementation are described in this<br>
specification. It will of course be appreciated that in the development of any such<br>
actual embodiment, numerous implementation-specific decisions must be made to<br>
achieve the developer's specific goals, such as compliance with system-related and<br>
business-related constraints, which will vary from one implementation to another.<br>
Moreover, it will be appreciated that such a development effort might be complex<br>
and time-consuming but would nevertheless be a routine undertaking for those of<br>
ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure.<br>
In the specification, reference may be made to the spatial relationships<br>
between various components and to the spatial orientation of various aspects of<br>
components as the devices are depicted in the attached drawings. However, as will<br>
be recognized by those skilled in the art after a complete reading of the present<br>
application, the devices, members, apparatuses, etc. described herein may be<br>
positioned in any desired orientation. Thus, the use of terms such as "above,"<br>
"below," "upper," "lower," or other like terms to describe a spatial relationship<br>
between various components or to describe the spatial orientation of aspects of such<br>
components should be understood to describe a relative relationship between the<br>
components or a spatial orientation of aspects of such components, respectively, as<br>
the device described herein may be oriented in any desired direction.<br><br>
WO 2006/102566	PCT/US2006/010692<br>
-7-<br>
The present invention represents an apparatus for joining a first member and<br>
a second member, an assembly resulting from the joining of the first member and the<br>
second member, and a method for making the assembly. The apparatus includes a<br>
means for joining the first member and the second member and a means for<br>
transferring a shear load between the first member and the second member that is<br>
separate from the means for joining the first member and the second member. The<br>
apparatus further includes a means for providing a compression preload to the<br>
means for transferring the shear load between the first member and the second<br>
member.<br>
In one embodiment, the means for joining the first member and the second<br>
member is one or more mechanical fasteners. The mechanical fasteners may be,<br>
for example, integral with the first member and/or the second member. Alternatively,<br>
the mechanical fasteners may be separate elements, such as bolts, rivets, or the<br>
like. Such examples are merely representative of the means encompassed by the<br>
present invention for joining the first member and the second member.<br>
The means for transferring the shear load between the first member and the<br>
second member may be integral with one or both of the first member and the second<br>
member. For example, the means for transferring the shear load may be a feature of<br>
the first member and/or the second member, such as one or more knurled features.<br>
The means for transferring the shear load instead, or in addition to, may be a<br>
separate component attached to the first member and the second member, such as<br>
an adhesive layer, a shear transfer adhesive layer, or a shear transfer layer<br>
adhesively bonded to the first member and the second member. Such examples,<br>
however, are merely representative of the means encompassed by the present<br>
invention for transferring the shear load between the first member and the second<br>
member.<br>
The means for providing a compression preload to the means for transferring<br>
the shear load between the first member and the second member may be integral<br>
with one or both of the first member and the second member. For example, the<br>
means for providing the compression preload may be accomplished by bending one<br><br>
WO 2006/102566	PCT/US2006/010692<br>
-8-<br>
or both of the first member and the second member from a first configuration or<br>
position to a second configuration or position. Biasing elements, such as Belleville<br>
washers or the like, may also be employed as the means for providing the<br>
compression preload. Such examples, however, are merely representative of the<br>
means encompassed by the present invention for providing the compression preload<br>
to the means for transferring the shear load between the first member and the<br>
second member.<br>
Figures 1-6 depict various views of a first illustrative embodiment of an<br>
apparatus 101 according to the present invention for joining a first member 103 and<br>
a second member 105 to produce an assembly 107. It should be noted that<br>
particular configurations of first member 103 and second member 105, illustrated in<br>
Figures 1-6, are merely exemplary. The scope of the present invention<br>
encompasses any desired configurations of first member 103 and second member<br>
105 that are suitable for joining by apparatus 101. Moreover, apparatus 101 may be<br>
used to join more than two members (e.g., members 103 and 105) into an assembly.<br>
Furthermore, a plurality of apparatuses (e.g., a plurality of apparatuses 101) may be<br>
utilized to join a first member (e.g., first member 103) and a second member (e.g.,<br>
105) to form an assembly according to the present invention, as will be described in<br>
greater detail below.<br>
Referring to Figures 1-3, which depict side, top, and bottom views of<br>
assembly 107, respectively, apparatus 101 comprises an adhesive layer 109 bonded<br>
to lower surface 111 of first member 103 and to upper surface 113 of second<br>
member 105. Adhesive layer 109 transfers shear loads between first member 103<br>
and second member 105. Apparatus 101 further comprises a fastener 115 that, in<br>
this particular embodiment, comprises a pin 117 extending through first member 103,<br>
adhesive layer 109, and second member 105, a head 119 extending from pin 117,<br>
and a nut 121 threadedly engaged with pin 117. In the illustrated embodiment,<br>
apparatus 101 further comprises a first biasing element 123 disposed between head<br>
119 and an upper surface 125 of first member 103 and a second biasing element<br>
127 disposed between nut 121 and a lower surface 129 of second member 105. In<br>
other embodiments, only one biasing element 123 or 127 is utilized. Preferably, if<br><br>
WO 2006/102566	PCT/US2006/010692<br>
-9-<br>
only one biasing element is used, the biasing element is disposed proximate the<br>
thinner of the members being joined. Pin 117 extends through biasing elements 123<br>
and 127.<br>
In this particular embodiment, biasing elements 123 and 127 comprise<br>
cupped or Belleville washers; however, other biasing elements exist and are within<br>
the scope of the present invention, as will be discussed in greater detail below. It<br>
should be noted that, in various embodiments, biasing element 123 or biasing<br>
element 127 may be omitted. It should also be noted that Figures 1-3 depict<br>
apparatus 101 in an uncompressed state. Apparatus 101 is compressed to<br>
complete assembly 107 for service, as will be discussed in greater detail below. It<br>
should also be noted that fastener 115 may take on many forms other than the<br>
particular form depicted in Figures 1-3, as will also be discussed in greater detail<br>
below.<br>
Figure 4 depicts a cross-sectional view of assembly 107 taken along a line 4-4<br>
in Figure 2. First member 103, second member 105, and adhesive layer 109 define<br>
a fastener opening 401 in which fastener 115 is disposed. Fastener opening 401 is<br>
formed by openings 403, 405, 407 defined by first member 103, adhesive layer 109,<br>
and second member 105, respectively. In the illustrated embodiment, fastener<br>
opening 401 exhibits a diameter Do that is greater than a diameter Dp of pin 117. It<br>
should be noted that, in some embodiments, openings 403, 405, 407 are misaligned<br>
and may exhibit different diameters. If openings 403, 405, 407 exhibit different<br>
diameters, preferably at least one of openings 403, 405, 407 exhibits a diameter<br>
(e.g., diameter Do) larger than diameter Dp of pin 117. Such a configuration provides<br>
flexibility at assembly and reduced manufacturing costs by allowing in-plane<br>
mismatch of members 103 and 105. Match-drill assembly tooling is eliminated, as<br>
members 103 and 105 can be drilled separately to form fastener opening 401.<br>
Moreover, such a configuration at least partially isolates fastener 115 from a fatigue<br>
load spectrum during use. Other means for joining first member 103 and second<br>
member 105, however, accomplish fatigue load spectrum isolation without relying<br>
upon fastener and fastener opening diameter sizes, as will be discussed in greater<br>
detail below.<br><br>
WO 2006/102566	PCT/US2006/010692<br>
-10-<br>
As noted above, apparatus 101 is compressed to complete assembly 107 for<br>
service. Figure 5 depicts a side view of assembly 107 and Figure 6 depicts a cross-<br>
sectional view, corresponding to the view of Figure 4, of assembly 107 in which<br>
apparatus 101 is in a compressed state. Specifically, nut 121 has been advanced<br>
along a threaded portion 501 of pin 117 to urge first member 103 toward second<br>
member 105 and to flatten first biasing element 123 and second biasing element<br>
127. First biasing element 123 and second biasing element 127 further bias first<br>
member 103 toward second member 105 It should be noted that fastener 115 is but<br>
one example of a means for joining first member 103 and second member 105.<br>
Moreover, biasing elements 123, 127 are merely examples of a means for providing<br>
a compression preload to adhesive layer 109.<br>
In preferred embodiments, adhesive layer 109 comprises a compliant<br>
adhesive, i.e., an adhesive that exhibits high strain to failure characteristics. The<br>
degree to which adhesive can be strained prior to failure is implementation specific,<br>
however. In some implementations, the degree of desired compliancy is greater<br>
than in other implementations, depending at least in part upon the thickness of<br>
adhesive layer 109 and the loads experienced by assembly 107. As will be<br>
discussed in greater detail below, adhesive layer 109 may include zones of greater<br>
compliancy (e.g., lower shear modulus) and other zones of lesser compliancy (e.g.,<br>
higher shear modulus). In such embodiments, at higher static loads, adhesive layer<br>
109 strains without failing (e.g., tearing, shearing, or the like), thus allowing pin 117<br>
to contact first member 103 and/or second member 105 and share the joint load<br>
through bearing and shear. Such a configuration provides enhanced ultimate static<br>
strengths over conventional fastened joints.<br>
Examples of such compliant adhesives include, but are not limited to, FM-300<br>
film adhesive from Cytec Engineered Materials of Anaheim, California; AF-163 film<br>
adhesive from 3M Corporation of St. Paul, Minnesota; Magnabond M-6398 paste<br>
adhesive from Magnolia Plastics, Inc. of Chamblee, Georgia; Hysol EC-3448 paste<br>
adhesive from 3M Corporation; and EA-9346.3 paste adhesive from Henkel<br>
Corporation of Bay Point, California. Alternatively, as depicted in Figure 7, adhesive<br>
layer 109 may be replaced by a shear transfer layer 701, comprising, for example,<br><br>
WO 2006/102566	PCT/US2006/010692<br>
-11 -<br>
an elastomer, adhesively bonded to lower surface 111 of first member 103 and<br>
upper surface 113 of second member 105 by adhesive layers 703 and 705. In<br>
preferred embodiments, adhesive layers 703, 705 comprise a compliant adhesive,<br>
such as the compliant adhesives disclosed above for adhesive layer 109; however,<br>
other adhesives may be employed and are encompassed in the scope of the present<br>
invention. Whether shear transfer adhesive layer 109 or the combination of shear<br>
transfer layer 701 with adhesive layers 703, 705 are used, shear transfer adhesive<br>
layer 109 and the combination of shear transfer layer 701 with adhesive layers 703,<br>
705 each form a shear transfer member disposed between and bonded to first<br>
member 103 and second member 105. Such a shear transfer member is but one<br>
example of a means for transferring shear loads between first member 103 and<br>
second member 105.<br>
As discussed above, an assembly according to the present invention may<br>
include a plurality of fasteners, such as fasteners 115. Moreover, a shear transfer<br>
member disposed between a first member and a second member and bonded to the<br>
first member and the second member may take on the form of a plurality of elements<br>
disposed about the fasteners. Such an embodiment is depicted in Figure 8.<br>
Specifically, an assembly 801 comprises a first member 803, a second member 805,<br>
and an apparatus 807 for joining first member 803 and second member 805. In the<br>
illustrated embodiment, apparatus 807 comprises a plurality of fasteners 115 and<br>
corresponding pluralities of first biasing elements 123, shear transfer members 809,<br>
and second biasing elements 127. Note that only one fastener 115, one first biasing<br>
element 123, one shear transfer member 809 and one second biasing element 127<br>
are labeled in Figure 8 for clarity.<br>
Pin 117 (only one labeled for clarity) of each of fasteners 115 is disposed<br>
through a corresponding first biasing element 123, an opening 811 defined by first<br>
member 803, a shear transfer member 809, an opening 813 defined by second<br>
member 805, and second biasing element 127. In the illustrated embodiment, nuts<br>
121 (only one labeled for clarity) are advanced along threaded portions 501 (only<br>
one labeled for clarity) of pin 117 to urge first member 803 toward second member<br>
805, thus joining first member 803 and second member 805. Biasing elements 123,<br><br>
WO 2006/102566	PCT/US2006/010692<br>
-12-<br>
127 further urge first member 803 toward second member 805, providing a<br>
compression preload to shear transfer members 809. In various embodiments,<br>
shear transfer members 809 may comprise a compliant adhesive, such as in<br>
adhesive layer 109, or may comprise a shear transfer layer, such as shear transfer<br>
layer 701, bonded to members 803, 805 by adhesive layers, such as adhesive layers<br>
703, 705. It should also be noted that shear transfer members 809 may exhibit the<br>
same degree of compliancy or different degrees of compliancy. Shear transfer<br>
members 809 transfer shear loads between first member 803 and second member<br>
805.<br>
Preferably, shear transfer members 809 disposed proximate ends and/or<br>
edges of assemblies are more compliant (e.g., exhibit lower shear moduli) than<br>
shear transfer members 809 disposed more distal from ends and/or edges of<br>
assemblies. For example, shear transfer members 809 disposed proximate an end<br>
815 of first member 803 and/or proximate an end 817 of second member 805<br>
preferably are less stiff (e.g., have greater compliance and lower shear moduli) than<br>
other shear transfer members 809 depicted in Figure 8. Such a configuration aids in<br>
accommodating higher peak loads exhibited at ends and/or edges of such<br>
assemblies that otherwise would result in peel failure of an adhesive bond between<br>
conventionally joined members.<br>
As noted above, the particular form of fasteners used in various embodiments<br>
of apparatuses according to the present invention for joining members is not limited<br>
to the form illustrated in Figures 1-8. Rather, any suitable fastener may be<br>
employed. For example, as shown in Figure 9, an assembly 901 according to the<br>
present invention comprises a first member 903, a second member 905, and an<br>
apparatus 907 for joining members 903 and 905. In the illustrated embodiment,<br>
apparatus 907 comprises a shear transfer member 909, disposed between and<br>
bonded to members 903, 905, and a fastener 911 extending through members 903,<br>
905, and 909. Shear transfer member 909 may comprise a compliant adhesive<br>
(such as in adhesive layer 109) or may comprise a shear transfer layer (such as<br>
shear transfer layer 701). Fastener 911 comprises a pin 913, a head 915, and a<br>
collar 917 threadedly engaged with pin 913.<br><br>
WO 2006/102566	PCT/US2006/010692<br>
-13-<br>
A retention tool (not shown) is engaged with a fitting 919 defined by pin 913.<br>
A drive tool (not shown) is engaged with collar 917 and is used to rotate collar 917<br>
with respect to pin 913 while retention tool inhibits pin 913 from rotating to urge<br>
members 903, 905 toward one another. Note that retention tool and drive tool may<br>
be combined into a single tool. In the illustrated embodiment, a drive portion 921 of<br>
collar 917 is designed to shear or break away from collar 917 at a predetermined<br>
torque. In other embodiments, collar 917 remains intact after being advanced along<br>
pin 913. Note that first biasing element 123 and/or second biasing element 127<br>
(each shown in at least Figure 1) may be included in apparatus 907 between head<br>
915 and second member 905 and between collar 917 and first member 903,<br>
respectively.<br>
In another embodiment, shown in Figure 10, an assembly 1001 according to<br>
the present invention comprises a first member 1003, a second member 1005, and<br>
an apparatus 1007 for joining members 1003 and 1005. In the illustrated<br>
embodiment, apparatus 1007 comprises a shear transfer member 1009, disposed<br>
between and bonded to members 1003, 1005, and a fastener 1011 extending<br>
through members 1003, 1005, and 1009. Shear transfer member 1009 may<br>
comprise a compliant adhesive (such as in adhesive layer 109) or may comprise a<br>
shear transfer layer (such as shear transfer layer 701). Fastener 1011 comprises a<br>
head 1013, a cable 1015 extending from head 1013, and a collar 1017 engaged with<br>
cable 1015. A tool (not shown) is engaged with cable 1015 and urged in a direction<br>
indicated generally by an arrow 1019 with respect to collar 1017 to urge first member<br>
1003 toward second member 1005. Collar 1017 engages cable 1015 to retain cable<br>
1015 in position relative to collar 1017. Cable 1015 preferably comprises a stranded<br>
cable and may be trimmed generally flush with collar 1017.<br>
Other fastener forms, however, may be employed in the present invention.<br>
For example, fasteners comprising metallic, fibrous, and/or composite materials may<br>
be used. Examples of composite fasteners include, but are not limited to, fasteners<br>
comprising aluminum; steel; titanium; dry, woven carbon or graphite fibers; carbon or<br>
graphite fibers disposed in a compliant matrix, such as an elastomeric matrix; carbon<br>
or graphite/epoxy composite material; or the like. Fasteners employing cables may<br><br>
WO 2006/102566	PCT/US2006/010692<br>
-14-<br>
retain the cables by friction (as in the embodiment of Figure 10) or by splaying the<br>
cable and introducing a material about the splayed cable fibers to retain the splayed<br>
cable fibers in a splayed configuration. If the particular fastener employed is flexible<br>
to some degree, a larger fastener opening (e.g., fastener opening 401) is not<br>
required, as the flexible fastener will elastically deform in response to loads placed<br>
upon the assembly. Moreover, while the fasteners (e.g., fasteners 115, 911, and the<br>
like) illustrated in the drawings and described herein include nuts or collars that are<br>
threadedly engaged with pins, fasteners employing other mechanical engagements<br>
may be used in the present invention.<br>
The particular forms of biasing elements of the present invention are not<br>
limited to the forms discussed above and illustrated in Figures 1-8. Rather, biasing<br>
elements of the present invention may take on any form suitable for use in biasing a<br>
plurality of members toward one another. For example, as shown in Figures 11-13,<br>
an assembly 1101 according to the present invention comprises first member 103,<br>
second member 105, and apparatus 1103 for joining members 103, 105. Apparatus<br>
1103 comprises a shear transfer member 1105 disposed between and bonded to<br>
first member 103 and second member 105. Shear transfer member 1105 may<br>
comprise a compliant adhesive (such as in adhesive layer 109) or may comprise a<br>
shear transfer layer (such as shear transfer layer 701). Apparatus further includes<br>
fastener 115 extending through members 103, 105, and 1105. In the illustrated<br>
embodiment, a biasing element 1107 is disposed between head 119 of fastener 115<br>
and first member 103. Biasing element 1107 is bowed in one direction, as best seen<br>
by comparing Figures 12 and 13, and is generally rectangular in a plan view, as<br>
shown in Figure 11. Other aspects of assembly 1101 generally correspond to the<br>
aspects of assembly 101, shown in Figures 1-7. It should be noted, however, that a<br>
second biasing element 1107 may be disposed between nut 121 and second<br>
member 105. Alternatively, biasing element 1107 may be disposed between nut 121<br>
and second member 103, rather than between head 119 and first member 103. In<br>
some embodiments, biasing elements (e.g., biasing element 1107) are configured to<br>
achieve a substantially uniform compression force along their perimeters. Biasing<br><br>
WO 2006/102566	PCT/US2006/010692<br>
-15-<br>
elements of the present invention may be bowed in one direction or in more than one<br>
direction.<br>
The apparatus according to the present invention for joining members is<br>
particularly useful when joining a first member and a second member along a lap<br>
joint. For example, as shown in Figures 14 and 15, a plurality of apparatuses 1103<br>
(shown in detail in Figures 11-13) are used to join a first member 1401 and a second<br>
member 1403 along a lap joint 1405 to form assembly 1407. In the illustrated<br>
embodiment, apparatuses 1103 include separate shear transfer members 1105 for<br>
each apparatus 1103. The scope of the present invention, however, is not so<br>
limited. Rather, a single shear transfer member may extend under all of biasing<br>
elements 1107. Alternatively, a shear transfer member may extend under some<br>
biasing elements 1107 while another shear transfer member extends under the<br>
remaining biasing elements 1107. It should be noted that, if a plurality of shear<br>
transfer members exist, one or more of the shear transfer members may exhibit<br>
compliancies that are different from other shear transfer members. For example,<br>
shear transfer members proximate edges of members 1401, 1403 may exhibit<br>
greater compliancies than shear transfer members that are more distal from the<br>
edges of members 1401, 1403. It should also be noted that two or more of the<br>
biasing elements 1107 (shown in Figures 11-13) employed in assembly 1401 may be<br>
unitized into a single biasing element. Moreover, one or more apparatuses 1103<br>
illustrated in Figures 14 and 15 may be replaced with another embodiment of an<br>
apparatus for joining members 1401 and 1403, as disclosed herein and their<br>
equivalents.<br>
The apparatus according to the present invention for joining members is<br>
particularly useful for joining a stiffener to a skin. For example, as shown in Figures<br>
16-18, an apparatus 1600 are used to join an end 1601 of a stiffener 1603 to a skin<br>
1605 to form a panel assembly 1607 to counteract peel stresses proximate end 1601<br>
that are induced during use. In the illustrated embodiment, stiffener 1603 is<br>
adhesively bonded to skin 1605 by adhesive layer 1701. Preferably, adhesive layer<br>
1701 comprises a compliant adhesive, such as discussed above. Generally,<br>
apparatus 1600 corresponds to two apparatuses 1103 (shown in detail in Figures 11-<br><br>
WO 2006/102566	PCT/US2006/010692<br>
-16-<br>
13), except that apparatus 1600 includes a single shear transfer member 1703. The<br>
scope of the present invention, however, is not so limited. Rather, apparatus 1600<br>
may include separate shear transfer members. It should be noted that, if multiple<br>
shear transfer members exist, the shear transfer members may exhibit different<br>
compliancies from one another. It should also be noted that adhesive layer 1701<br>
may exhibit a compliancy that is different from one or both of shear transfer<br>
members 1105. Preferably, the compliancy of shear transfer members 1105 is<br>
greater than the compliancy of adhesive layer 1701. In other words, the shear<br>
moduli exhibited by shear transfer members is less than the shear modulus exhibited<br>
by adhesive layer 1701. Moreover, apparatus 1600 may be replaced with one or<br>
more other embodiments of an apparatus according to the present invention for<br>
joining stiffener 1603 and skin 1605.<br>
It should be noted that the shear transfer members (e.g., adhesive layer 109;<br>
shear transfer layers 701; adhesive layers 703, 705; shear transfer members 809,<br>
909, 1009, 1105, 1703; or the like) may include fiber reinforcement. For example,<br>
shear transfer members 809 preferably include radially-oriented fibers, which<br>
enhance creep resistance of shear transfer members 809. It should also be noted<br>
that the shear transfer members, irrespective of their forms, can be tailored to exhibit<br>
particular desired shear moduli by preferentially orienting reinforcing fibers within the<br>
shear transfer members.<br>
In some embodiments of the present invention, the joined members<br>
themselves provide a means for providing a compression preload to a means for<br>
transferring shear loads between the joined members. For example, as depicted in<br>
Figures 19 and 20, an assembly 1901 comprises a first member 1903, a second<br>
member 1905, a shear transfer layer 1907 disposed between and engaged with first<br>
member 1903 and second member 1905, and a clip 1909. In the disjoined state,<br>
shown in Figure 19, members 1903, 1905 longitudinally bow or are deformed away<br>
from one another. When joined, as shown in Figure 20, members 1903, 1905 are<br>
urged toward one another (as indicated by arrows 1910a, 1910b) to remove the<br>
deformation or bow and provide a compressive preload to shear transfer layer 1907.<br>
In the illustrated embodiment, clip 1909 is applied to members 1903, 1095 to join<br><br>
WO 2006/102566	PCT/US2006/010692<br>
-17-<br>
members 1903, 1905. It should be noted that shear transfer layer 1907 may be<br>
replaced with any of the shear transfer member or feature embodiments disclosed<br>
herein. It should also be noted that only one of members 1903, 1905 may provide<br>
the compressive preload to shear transfer layer 1907. In such an embodiment, only<br>
one of members 1903, 1905 is bowed with respect to the other of members 1903,<br>
1905.<br>
In the embodiment of Figures 19 and 20, clip 1907 is applied to an end 1911<br>
of assembly 1901. The embodiment of Figures 21 and 22 operates similarly, except<br>
that a clip 2201 is used to join a first member 2101 and a second member 2103<br>
along an edge 2105 to form an assembly 2107. Members 2101 and 2103 provide a<br>
compressive preload to a shear transfer layer 2109 disposed between and engaged<br>
with members 2101, 2103.<br>
Members to be joined may also be transversely bowed with respect to one<br>
another to provide a compressive preload to a shear transfer layer. For example, as<br>
shown in Figures 23 and 24, an assembly 2301 comprises a first member 2303, a<br>
second member 2305, a shear transfer layer 2307, and a plurality of clips 2401. In<br>
the disjoined state, shown in Figure 23, members 2303, 2305 transversely bow or<br>
are deformed away from one another. When joined, as shown in Figure 24,<br>
members 2303, 2305 are urged toward one another to remove the deformation or<br>
bow and provide a compressive preload to shear transfer layer 2307. In the<br>
illustrated embodiment, clip 2401 is applied to members 2303, 2305 to join members<br>
2303, 2305. It should be noted that shear transfer layer 2307 may be replaced with<br>
any of the shear transfer member or feature embodiments disclosed herein. It<br>
should also be noted that only one of members 2303, 2305 may provide the<br>
compressive preload to shear transfer layer 2307. In such an embodiment, only one<br>
of members 2303, 2305 is bowed with respect to the other of members 2303, 2305.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention exist in which fastening elements<br>
comprise part of one or both of the joined members. For example, as shown in<br>
Figures 25 and 26, an assembly 2501 comprises a first member 2503, a second<br>
member 2505, a shear transfer layer 2507, and a plurality of fastening elements<br><br>
WO 2006/102566	PCT/US2006/010692<br>
-18-<br>
2509 extending from first member 2503. Alternatively, fastening elements 2509 may<br>
extend from second member 2505 or from both members 2503, 2505. In the<br>
disjoined state, shown in Figure 25, members 2503, 2505 transversely bow or are<br>
deformed away from one another. In other embodiments, however, members 2503,<br>
2505 may longitudinally bow away from one another, in a fashion similar to that of<br>
Figures 19 or 21. When joined, as shown in Figure 26, members 2503, 2505 are<br>
urged toward one another to remove the deformation or bow and provide a<br>
compressive preload to shear transfer layer 2507. In the illustrated embodiment,<br>
fastening element 2509 is bent about second member 2505 to join members 2503,<br>
2505. It should be noted that shear transfer layer 2507 may be replaced with any of<br>
the shear transfer member or feature embodiments disclosed herein. It should also<br>
be noted that only one of members 2503, 2505 may provide the compressive<br>
preload to shear transfer layer 2507. In such an embodiment, only one of members<br>
2503, 2505 is bowed with respect to the other of members 2503, 2505.<br>
While the present invention has been discussed above as including a shear<br>
transfer layer or member, the scope of the present invention is not so limited.<br>
Rather, the joined members may include one or more features that transmit shear<br>
loads between the members. For example, as depicted in Figure 27, a first member<br>
2701 includes a knurled surface 2703 and a second member 2705 includes a<br>
knurled surface 2707. When knurled surfaces 2703, 2707 are mated and members<br>
2701, 2703 are joined (such as by any other the joining techniques disclosed herein),<br>
knurled surfaces 2703, 2707 mechanically engage one another to transfer shear<br>
loads between members 2701, 2703 when in service. Knurled surfaces (e.g.,<br>
knurled surfaces 2703, 2707) or other such mechanical interlocks replace the shear<br>
transfer layers, members, or elements disclosed in any of the above embodiments.<br>
It should be noted that an assembly according to the present invention may<br>
include more than two members. Each joint of such assemblies may be tailored to<br>
balance the load transfer through the assembly by, for example, employing shear<br>
transfer elements or features having different shear transfer characteristics. For<br>
example, one joint of an assembly may include a shear transfer layer, member, or<br>
plurality of layers and/or members having a particular shear modulus or a particular<br><br>
WO 2006/102566	PCT/US2006/010692<br>
-19-<br>
plurality of shear moduli, while another joint of the assembly includes a shear<br>
transfer layer, member, and/or plurality of layers or members having a different<br>
particular shear modulus or a different plurality of shear moduli.<br>
It should be noted that the term "shear load transfer structure," as used<br>
herein, encompasses any of the means for transferring shear loads between<br>
members, shear load transfer layers, members, elements, features, or the like<br>
disclosed herein and their equivalents, including, but not limited to, adhesive layers,<br>
adhesively bonded shear load transfer layers, mechanical interlocking features of<br>
joined members, and the like. It should also be noted that the tern "compression<br>
preload feature." as used herein, encompasses any of the means for providing a<br>
compression preload, biasing elements, bows or deformations of members, or the<br>
like disclosed herein or their equivalents.<br>
The present invention provides significant advantages, including: (1) providing<br>
lightweight structural assemblies with enhanced strength and reliability; (2) flexibility<br>
at assembly; (3) allowance for in-plane mismatch of structural components while the<br>
selection of thickness and stiffness of the shear transfer members permit gap and<br>
angular mismatch of structural components while retaining the original overall joint<br>
stiffness, resulting in consistent joint performance with reduced assembly time and<br>
manufacturing costs; and (4) improvements in static and fatigued performance with a<br>
weight and cost savings over conventional bolted joints with machined step structure<br>
or conventional bonded joints.<br>
Other significant advantages of the present invention exist. The most<br>
attractive is the significant cost reduction and cycle time reduction resulting from<br>
eliminating match drill assembly tooling and process steps. This is made possible by<br>
the loose tolerance fastener holes, which can be drilled at the detail level. The<br>
implementation of this invention would have a significant impact on the cost of rate<br>
tooling and could reduce the number of assembly fixtures required to achieve "rate"<br>
or meet customer demand. It would reduce the capital expense required to employ<br>
robotics for assembly of composite joints. A significant related benefit would be the<br>
reduction in the number of manufacturing discrepancies or material reviews related<br><br>
WO 2006/102566	PCT/US2006/010692<br>
-20-<br>
to drilling during the assembly process. This invention is also an enabling technology<br>
for toolless or jigless assembly.<br>
This invention allows both the fasteners and bond line to work together in<br>
providing a clear easily-inspected visual indication of overload before catastrophic<br>
failure occurs.<br>
It also enables the replacement of fasteners in the field without drilling or<br>
installing oversize fasteners. It has the potential of enhancing the survivability<br>
response of composite structures by spreading partial failure and absorbing higher<br>
levels of energy along joint areas.<br>
Enhanced fatigue life is another advantage provided by the loose tolerance<br>
fastener holes. Fail-safe joint capability is provided by having two components<br>
capable of carrying joint loads, i.e., the adhesive layer (or shear transfer layer in<br>
combination with adhesive layers) being the primary load carrying element and the<br>
fastener being the secondary load carrying element.<br>
The particular embodiments disclosed above are illustrative only, as the<br>
invention may be modified and practiced in different but equivalent manners<br>
apparent to those skilled in the art having the benefit of the teachings herein.<br>
Furthermore, no limitations are intended to the details of construction or design<br>
herein shown, other than as described in the claims below. It is therefore evident that<br>
