				<td>PURIFICATION OF PROTEINS WITH CATIONIC SURFACTANT<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]	The present application claims priority to and the benefit of U.S. provisional<br>
application Serial No. 60/670,520, filed on April 11, 2005, the disclosure of which is being<br>
incorporated by reference herein.<br>
FILED OF INVENTION<br>
[0002]	The invention relates to the field of protein purification using surfactants.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003]	Production of biological macromolecules, particularly proteins, often involves<br>
purity-enhancing steps based on physical and physicochemical properties. Difficulties<br>
encountered in such process steps include, but are not limited to, determining conditions which<br>
enable separation of soluble and insoluble molecules, relatively low recovery of the desired<br>
molecule after a treatment step, loss of biological activity in the course of the process, and<br>
sensitivity of the protein to process step conditions such as pH.<br>
[0004]	Surfactants have been utilized in the processing of biological macromolecules.<br>
Cationic surfactants are a recognized subclass of surfactants, and include amphipathic<br>
ammonium compounds. Amphipathic ammonium compounds comprise quaternary ammonium<br>
compounds of the general formula QN+ and paraffin chain primary ammonium compounds of<br>
the general formula RNH3+. Both types of amphipathic ammonium compounds include long-<br>
chain ammonium surfactants that have a long aliphatic chain of preferably at least six carbon<br>
atoms (Scott (1960) Methods Biochem. Anal. 8:145-197, incorporated herein by reference in its<br>
entirety). The long-chain quaternary ammonium surfactants are known to interact with biologic,<br>
macromolecules. The long-chain quaternary ammonium compounds have at least one substituei<br><br>
-2-<br>
at the nitrogen which consists of a linear alkyl chain with 6-20 carbon atoms. The best known<br>
representatives of this class are the benzalkonium salts (chlorides and bromides),<br>
hexadecylpyridinium chloride dequalinium acetate, cetyldimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)<br>
and hexadecylpyridinium chloride (CPC1), and benzethonium chloride. Quaternary ammonium<br>
surfactants include salts such as cetyl pyridinium salts, e.g. cetyl pyridinium chloride (CPC),<br>
stearamide-methylpyridinium salts, lauryl pyridinium salts, cetyl quinolynium salts, lauryl<br>
aminopropionic acid methyl ester salts, lauryl amino propionic acid metal salts, lauryl dimethyl<br>
betaine stearyl dimethyl betaine, lauryl dihydroxyethyl betaine and benzethonium salts. Alkyl<br>
pyridinium salts comprise stearyl-trimethyl ammonium salts, alkyl-dimethylbenzyl-ammonium<br>
chloride, and dichloro-benzyldimethyl-alkylammonium chloride.<br>
[0005]	Known uses of cationic surfactants for purifying biological macromolecules<br>
include 1) solubilization of aggregates, including protein aggregates; 2) elution of<br>
chromatographic column-bound biological macromolecules; and 3) precipitation of polyanions<br>
such as hyaluronic acid (HA), nucleic acids, and heparin (and molecules which co-precipitate<br>
with polyanions).<br>
[0006]	Cationic surfactants have been used for solubilizing protein aggregates. Otta and<br>
Bertini ((1975) Acta Physiol. Latinoam. 25:451-457, incorporated herein by reference in its<br>
entirety) demonstrated that active uricase could be solubilized from rodent liver peroxizomes<br>
with the quaternary ammonium surfactant, Hyamine 2389. It is found that increase of the<br>
ammonium surfactant concentration resulted in increase of dissolution of both uricase (based on<br>
enzymatic activity) and total protein such that there is no increase in the relative amount of<br>
uricase protein with respect to the amount of total protein. In other words, there was no selective<br>
solubilization of the uricase protein with respect to the total protein, and the uricase protein did<br><br>
-3-<br>
not constitute a higher percentage of the total protein upon solubilization with the cationic<br>
surfactant. Thus, in this process, uricase purity with respect to the total protein content is<br>
apparently not enhanced as a result of quaternary ammonium surfactant solubilization.<br>
[0007]	In another study, Truscoe ((1967) Enzymologia 33:1 19-32, incorporated herein<br>
by reference in its entirety) examined a panel of cationic, anionic, and neutral detergents for their<br>
extraction efficacy of urate oxidase (uricase) from ox kidney powders. While the neutral and<br>
anionic detergents were found to enhance soluble urate oxidase activity, the cationic detergents,<br>
e.g., quaternary ammonium salts, were found to decrease total enzymatic activity with increasing<br>
concentration. The authors concluded that cationic detergents were not useful for purifying ox<br>
kidney urate oxidase<br>
[0008]	Solubilization of recombinant proteins, porcine growth hormone, methionyl-<br>
porcine growth hormone, infectious bursal disease virus protein, B-galactosidase fusion protein,<br>
from E. coli inclusion bodies or cells, with cationic surfactants is described in United States<br>
Patent No. 4,797,474, United States Patent No. 4,992,531, United States Patent No. 4,966,963,<br>
and United States Patent No. 5,008,377, each incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
Solubilization under alkaline conditions is accomplished using quaternary ammonium<br>
compounds including cetyltrimethylammonium chloride, mixed n-alkyl dimethyl<br>
benzylammonium chloride, CPC, N,N-dimethyl-N-[2-[2-[4-(l,l,3,3,-tetramethylbutyl)-<br>
phenoxy]ethoxy]ethyl] benzenemethanammonium chloride, tetradecyl trimethylammonium<br>
bromide, dodecyl trimethylammonium bromide, cetyl trimethylammonium bromide. These<br>
publications mention that, after each solubilization process, the solutions are centrifuged, and<br>
little to no pellet is observed in each case. This observation suggests that most or all of the<br>
proteins are solubilized without regard to selectivity for the solubilization of a target protein. The<br><br>
-4-<br>
purity of the recovered proteins is not indicated. United States Patent No. 5,929,231,<br>
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, describes cetyl pyridinium chloride (CPC)<br>
disintegration of granules and aggregates containing starches. Thus, the prior art relates to use of<br>
cationic surfactants for general, nonspecific solubilization of particulate biological<br>
macromolecules. These methods of the prior art do not disclose increasing the purity of a<br>
desired target protein with respect to total protein with a cationic surfactant.<br>
[0009]	Cationic surfactants have also been used to elute biological macromolecules<br>
adsorbed to cation exchange resins or aluminum-containing adjuvants (Antonopoulos, et al.<br>
(1961) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 54:213-226; Embery (1976) J. Biol. Buccale 4:229-236; and<br>
Rinella, et al. (1998) J. Colloid Interface Sci. 197:48-56, each of which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference in its entirety). United States Patent No. 4,169,764, incorporated herein by reference in<br>
its entirety, describes elution of urokinase from carboxymethyl cellulose columns using a wide<br>
variety of cationic surfactant solutions. The authors state a preference for using tetra substituted<br>
ammonium salts in which one alkyl group is a higher alkyl group up to 20 carbon atoms and the<br>
others are lower alkyl groups up to 6 carbon atoms. Use of such cationic surfactants enables<br>
removal of biological macromolecules from their attachment to a solid matrix.<br>
[0010]	Conversely, impregnation of filters such as those composed of nylon, with<br>
cationic surfactant enables immobilizing of polysaccharides or nucleic acids (Maccari and Volpi<br>
(2002) Electrophoresis 23:3270-3277; Benitz, et al. (1990) United States Patent No. 4,945,086;<br>
Macfarlane (1991) United States Patent No. 5,010,183, each of which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference in its entirety). This phenomenon is apparently due to cationic surfactant-polyanion<br>
interactions which enable precipitation of the polyanion.<br><br>
-5-<br>
[0011]	It is well established that amphipathic ammonium compounds, which comprise<br>
quaternary ammonium compounds of the general formula QN+ and paraffin chain primary<br>
ammonium compounds of the general formula RNH3+, can precipitate polyanions under defined<br>
conditions (reviewed in Scott (1955) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 18:428-429; Scott (1960) Methods<br>
Biochem. Anal. 8:145-197; Laurent, et al, (1960) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 42:476-485; Scott<br>

Biochem. 203:103-112, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). This<br>
precipitation is dependent on the precipitating species having a high polyanion charge density<br>
and high molecular weight (Saito (1955) Kolloid-Z 143:66, incorporated herein by reference in<br>
its entirety). The presence of salts can interfere with or reverse cationic surfactant-induced<br>
precipitation of polyanions.<br>
[0012]	Additionally, polyanions can be differentially precipitated from solutions<br>
containing protein contaminants, under alkaline pH conditions. In such cases, proteins not<br>
chemically bound to the polyanions will remain in solution, while the polyanions and other<br>
molecules bound to the polyanions will precipitate. For example, precipitation of polyanions<br>
such as polysaccharides and nucleic acids is accompanied by co-precipitation of molecules such<br>
as proteoglycans and proteins interacting with the polyanions (Blumberg and Ogston (1958)<br>

[0013]	The isoelectric point (or pi) of a protein is the pH at which the protein has an<br>
equal number of positive and negative charges. Under solution conditions with pH values close<br>
to (especially below) a protein's isoelectric point, proteins can form stable salts with strongly<br>
acidic polyanions such as heparin. Under conditions which promote precipitation of such<br>
polyanions, the proteins complexed with the polyanions also precipitate (LB Jaques (1943)<br>

States Patent No. 4,297,344 (Schwinn, et al., 1981), each of which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference in its entirety).<br>
[0014]	United States Patent No. 4,421,650, United States Patent No. 5,633,227, and<br>
Smith, et al. ((1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259:11046-11051, each of which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference in its entirety) describe purification of polyanions by sequential treatment with a<br>
cationic surfactant and ammonium sulfate (that enables dissociation of polyanion-cationic<br>
surfactant complexes) and subsequent separation using hydrophobic interactions<br>
chromatography. European patent publication EP055188, incorporated herein by reference in its<br>
entirety, describes cationic surfactant-enabled separation of RTX toxin from lipopolysaccharide.<br>
However, there is no mass balance in the amount of lipopolysaccharide that is quantified by<br>
endotoxin activity assays. Neutralization of endotoxin activity by strongly interacting cationic<br>
compounds has been demonstrated (Cooper JF (1990) J Parenter Sci Technol 44:13-5,<br><br>
-7-<br>
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Thus, in EP055188, the lack of endotoxin<br>
activity in the precipitate following treatment with increasing amounts of cationic surfactant<br>
possibly results from neutralization of the activity by surfactant- lipopolysaccharide complex<br>
formation.<br>
[0015]	The above-mentioned methods require intermediary polyanions, solid supports or<br>
aggregates comprising proteins with selective solubility by a cationic surfactant for enabling<br>
purification of soluble proteins using cationic surfactant. Hence, the prior art does not provide a<br>
method of purifying a target protein by contacting the protein with a cationic surfactant in an<br>
amount effective to preferentially precipitate proteins other than the target protein, i.e.,<br>
contaminating proteins, particularly when such contacting is done in the absence of intermediary<br>
polyanions, solid supports, or aggregates of proteins. Often, one skilled in the art encounters<br>
mixtures of soluble proteins and does not have a simple, efficient means for purifying the desired<br>
protein. The novel method for purifying proteins, described herein, enables efficient purification<br>
of target proteins by using cationic surfactants to preferentially precipitate proteins other than the<br>
target protein. Preferably such precipitation of contaminating proteins is direct, and does not<br>
depend upon the presence of polyanions, solid supports or aggregates comprising the<br>
contaminating proteins and other molecules.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0016]	The subject invention provides a method for purifying a target protein from a<br>
mixture comprising the target protein and contaminating protein, comprising the steps of<br>
exposing the mixture to an effective amount of a cationic surfactant such that the contaminating<br>
protein is preferentially precipitated and recovering the target protein.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0028]	Proteins are ampholytes, having both positive and negative charges. The pH of a<br>
solution and charged molecules that interact with a protein impact the net charge of that protein.<br>
Strong interactions between proteins can occur when the net charge of a protein is neutral (the<br>
isoelectric point). When the pH of the solution is below the isoelectric point of the protein, the<br>
protein has a net positive charge, and there may be electrostatic repulsion between cationic<br>
molecules, including other proteins.<br>
[0029]	It is an object of the invention to provide a method for purifying a solubilized<br>
target protein from a solution comprising a mixture of the target protein and contaminating<br>
proteins comprising contacting the solubilized mixture with an effective amount of a cationic<br>
surfactant and recovering the target protein. Cationic surfactants are surface-active molecules<br><br>
-10-<br>
with a positive charge. In general, these compounds also have at least one non-polar aliphatic<br>
group. Preferably the target protein has an isoelectric point greater than 7. In a particular<br>
embodiment, the pH of the solution is about the same as the isoelectric point of the target<br>
protein. In a preferred embodiment, the pH of the solution is less than the isoelectric point of the<br>
target protein. In a particular embodiment, when the pH of the solution is above the isoelectric<br>
point of the target protein, the pH of the solution is within 1-2 pH units of the isoelectric point of<br>
the target protein. In a particular embodiment, when the pH of the solution is above the<br>
isoelectric point of the target protein, the pH of the solution is within 1 pH unit of the isoelectric<br>
point of the target protein.<br>
[0030]	In a particular embodiment, the contaminating protein or proteins are<br>
preferentially precipitated, thereby increasing the proportion of the proteins remaining in<br>
solution represented by the target protein. For example, starting from a solution of target protein<br>
and contaminating protein wherein the target protein is 20% of the total protein in solution, one<br>
can purify the target protein using the methods provided to achieve a solution wherein the target<br>
protein is 30% or more, 40% or more, 50% or more, 60% or more, 70% or more, 80% or more,<br>
90% or more, 95% or more of the total protein remaining in solution.<br>
[0031]	As used herein, the term "preferentially precipitate" means that a protein or group<br>
of proteins are precipitated to a greater extent than another protein or group of proteins. For<br>
example, in the case of a mixture of a target protein and contaminating proteins, the<br>
contaminating proteins are preferentially precipitated with respect to the target protein when<br>
20% or more of the contaminating proteins are precipitated, while less than 20% of the target<br>
protein is precipitated. Preferably, a high percentage of contaminating proteins are precipitated,<br>
while a low percentage of the target protein is precipitated. In preferred embodiments, 30% or<br><br>
-11 -<br>
more of the contaminating proteins are precipitated, while less than 30% of the target protein is<br>
precipitated; 40% or more of the contaminating proteins are precipitated, while less than 40% of<br>
the target protein is precipitated; 50% or more of the contaminating proteins are precipitated,<br>
while less than 50% of the target protein is precipitated; 60% or more of the contaminating<br>
proteins are precipitated, while less than 60% of the target protein is precipitated; 70% or more<br>
of the contaminating proteins are precipitated, while less than 70% of the target protein is<br>
precipitated; 80% or more of the contaminating proteins are precipitated, while less than 80% of<br>
the target protein is precipitated; 90% or more of the contaminating proteins are precipitated,<br>
while less than 90% of the target protein is precipitated; 95% or more of the contaminating<br>
proteins are precipitated, while less than 95% of the target protein is precipitated. Preferably, a<br>
small percentage of the target protein is precipitated. For example, less than 60%, less than 50%,<br>
less than 40%, less than 30%, less than 20%, less than 10%, less than 5% or less than 1% of the<br>
target protein is precipitated.<br>
[0032]	In a particular embodiment, the total amount of protein in solution (target protein<br>
plus contaminating protein), prior to carrying out the purification method of the invention, is<br>
from 0.1 to 10 mg/ml. In particular embodiments, the total amount of protein in solution prior to<br>
carrying out the purification method of the invention is from 0.1 to 3 mg/ml, 0.3 to 2 mg/ml, 0.5<br>
to 2 mg/ml, 0.5 to 1 mg/ml, 1 to 2 mg/ml, or about 1 mg/ml.<br>
[0033]	In particular embodiments, the preferential precipitation of contaminating proteins<br>
is direct, and does not depend, or does not substantially depend, upon the presence of polyanions.<br>
In another embodiment, the preferential precipitation of contaminating proteins is direct, and<br>
does not depend, or does not substantially depend, upon the presence of a solid support. In<br>
another embodiment, the preferential precipitation of contaminating proteins does not depend, or<br><br>

does not substantially depend, upon the presence of aggregates between contaminating proteins<br>
and other molecules. The preferential precipitation of contaminating proteins does not depend or<br>
substantially depend upon a component (e.g., polyanions, solid supports, or aggregates of<br>
contaminating proteins and other molecules) when, for example, the removal of that component<br>
does not effect or does not substantially effect, respectively, the preferential precipitation of<br>
contaminating protein. An example of an insubstantial effect of the removal of a component<br>
would be that the contaminating proteins are preferentially precipitated both when the<br>
component is present and when it is absent. A further example would be the contaminating<br>
proteins are preferentially precipitated to the same extent when the component is present and<br>
when it is absent. Preferably, the same or substantially the same amount of contaminating<br>
proteins are precipitated in the absence or substantial absence of the component as is in the<br>
presence of the component.<br>
[0034]	In another embodiment, the method is performed in the absence of polyanions or<br>
in the absence of substantial amounts of polyanions. In another embodiment, the method is<br>
performed in the absence of a solid support or in the absence of a substantial solid support. In<br>
another embodiment, the method is performed in the absence of aggregates between<br>
contaminating proteins and other molecules, or in the absence of substantial amounts of<br>
aggregates between contaminating proteins and other molecules. Preferably, the method is<br>
performed in the absence of or in the absence of substantial amounts of two or three members of<br>
the group consisting of polyanions; a solid support; and aggregates between contaminating<br>
proteins and other molecules.<br>
[0035]	Once provided the method of the invention, it is routine for one of skill in the art<br>
to select the particular surfactant used and the conditions, e.g., pH, temperature, salinity, cationic<br><br>
-13-<br>
surfactant concentration, total protein concentration, under which this procedure is accomplished<br>
to enhance efficiency of the purification of a particular target protein. For example, purifications<br>
performed at differing pH values and surfactant concentrations may be compared to establish the<br>
optimal purification conditions. Examples of this procedure are provided below in the Examples<br>
section. In a particular embodiment, the pH of the solution is chosen such that it is as high as is<br>
possible without substantially reducing the amount of target protein recovered.<br>
[0036]	It is a further objective of the invention to provide a method for determining<br>
conditions which enable efficient purification of target proteins on the basis of their solubility, as<br>
impacted by cationic surfactants.<br>
[0037]	An effective amount of cationic surfactant is an amount of surfactant that causes<br>
the preferential precipitation of contaminating proteins. In particular embodiments, the effective<br>
amount of surfactant precipitates 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% or 99% of the<br>
contaminating proteins.<br>
[0038]	In an embodiment of the invention, the cationic surfactant is added to a<br>
concentration of from 0.001% to 5.0%, preferably the cationic surfactant is added to a<br>
concentration of from 0.01% to 0.5 % and more preferably, the cationic surfactant is added to a<br>
concentration of from 0.03% to 0.2%. In particular embodiments, the cationic surfactant is<br>
added to a concentration of from 0.01% to 0.1%, 0.01% to 0.075%, 0.01% to 0.05% or 0.01% to<br>
0.03%.<br>
[0039]	In an embodiment of the invention, the above-mentioned method is accomplished<br>
when the cationic surfactant is an amphipathic ammonium compound.<br>
[0040]	In a preferred embodiment, the solubilized target protein is subjected to further<br>
processing after contaminating proteins have been preferentially precipitated. Such further<br><br>
-14-<br>
processing can include additional purification steps, assays for activity or concentration, dialysis,<br>
chromatography (e.g., HPLC, size exclusion chromatography), electrophoresis, dialysis, etc.<br>
[0041]	As used herein, amphipathic ammonium compounds comprise compounds having<br>
both cationic and non-polar components with the general formula of either QN+ or RNH3+. Q<br>
indicates that the nitrogen is a quaternary ammonium (covalently bonded to four organic groups<br>
which may or may not be bonded one to another). When organic groups are bonded one to<br>
another, they may form cyclic aliphatic or aromatic compounds, depending on the electronic<br>
configuration of the bonds between the components which form the cyclic structure. When the<br>
amphipathic ammonium compound selected has the general formula, RNH3+, the compound is a<br>
primary amine wherein R is an aliphatic group. Aliphatic groups are open chain organic groups.<br>
[0042]	In an embodiment of the invention, the selected amphipathic ammonium<br>
compound may form a salt with a halide. Commonly, halide salts refer to those comprising<br>
fluoride, chloride, bromide, and iodide ions.<br>
[0043]	In an embodiment of the invention, the amphipathic ammonium compound has at<br>
least one aliphatic chain having 6-20 carbon atoms, preferably, the amphipathic ammonium<br>
compound has at least one aliphatic chain having 8-18 carbon atoms.<br>
[0044]	In an embodiment of the invention, the selected amphipathic ammonium<br>
compound is selected from the group consisting of cetyl pyridinium salts, stearamide-<br>
methylpyridinium salts, lauryl pyridinium salts, cetyl quinolynium salts, lauryl aminopropionic<br>
acid methyl ester salts, lauryl amino propionic acid metal salts, lauryl dimethyl betaine, stearyl<br>
dimethyl betaine, lauryl dihydroxyethyl betaine and benzethonium salts.<br>
[0045]	Amphipathic ammonium compounds which may be used include, but are not<br>
limited to hexadecylpyridinium chloride dequalinium acetate, hexadecylpyridinium chloride,<br><br>
-15-<br>
cetyltrimethylammonium chloride, mixed n-alkyl dimethyl benzylammonium chloride, cetyl<br>
pyridinium chloride (CPC), N,N-dimethyl-N-[2-[2-[4-(l,l,3,3,-tetramethylbutyl)-<br>
phenoxy]ethoxy]ethyl] benzenemethanammonium chloride, alkyl-dimethylbenzyl-ammonium<br>
chloride, and dichloro-benzyldimethyl-alkylammonium chloride, tetradecyl trimethylammonium<br>
bromide, dodecyl trimethylammonium bromide, cetyl trimethylammonium bromide, lauryl<br>
dimethyl betaine stearyl dimethyl betaine, and lauryl dihydroxyethyl betaine.<br>
[0046]	In an embodiment of the invention, the amphipathic ammonium compound is a<br>
cetylpyridinium salt such as cetylpyridinium chloride.<br>
[0047]	In an embodiment of the invention, the mixture containing the desired protein<br>
further comprises cellular components such as cellular components derived from<br>
microorganisms, for example, bacteria such as E. coli.<br>
[0048]	In an embodiment of the invention, the cellular components are one or more<br>
proteins.<br>
[0049]	In an embodiment of the invention the target protein may be a recombinant<br>
protein, for example, an enzyme.<br>
[0050]	The method of the invention can be used to purify a variety of proteins. These<br>
proteins may include, but are not limited to antibodies, uricase, interferon-beta, leech factor X<br>
inhibitor, acid deoxyribonuclease II, elastase, lysozyme, papain, peroxidase, pancreatic<br>
ribonuclease, trypsinogen, trypsin, cytochrome c, erabutoxin, staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin<br>
Cl, and monoamine oxidase A, and other proteins that are positively charged under alkaline<br>
conditions.<br><br>
-16-<br>
[0051]	In an embodiment of the invention the target protein may be an antibody,<br>
receptor, enzyme, transport protein, hormone, or fragment thereof or a conjugate e.g., conjugated<br>
to a second protein or a chemical or a toxin.<br>
[0052]	Antibodies include but are not limited to monoclonal, humanized, chimeric, single<br>
chain, bispecific, Fab fragments, F(ab')2 fragments, fragments produced by a Fab expression<br>
library, anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibodies, and epitope-binding fragments of any of the above,<br>
but with the proviso that at the conditions of the purification the antibody is positively charged.<br>
[0053]	For preparation of monoclonal antibodies, any technique that provides for the<br>
production of antibody molecules by continuous culture of cell lines may be used. These include<br>
but are not limited to the hybridoma technique of Kohler and Milstein, (1975, Nature 256, 495-<br>
497; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,376,110), the human B-cell hybridoma technique (Kozbor et al., 1983,<br>
Immunology Today 4, 72; Cole et al., 1983, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 80, 2026-2030), and the<br>
EBV-hybridoma technique to produce human monoclonal antibodies (Cole et al., 1985,<br>
Monoclonal Antibodies And Cancer Therapy, Alan R. Liss, Inc., pp. 77-96).<br>
[0054]	Such antibodies may be used as the basis from which to clone and thus<br>
recombinantly express individual heavy and light chains. The two chains may be recombinantly<br>
expressed in the same cell or combined in vitro after separate expression and purification.<br>
Nucleic acids (e.g., on a plasmid vector) encoding a desired heavy or light chain or encoding a<br>
molecule comprising a desired heavy or light chain variable domain can be transfected into a cell<br>
expressing a distinct antibody heavy or light chain or molecule comprising an antibody heavy or<br>
light chain, for expression of a multimeric protein. Alternatively, heavy chains or molecules<br>
comprising the variable region thereof or a CDR thereof can optionally be expressed and used<br>
without the presence of a complementary light chain or light chain variable region. In other<br><br>
-17-<br>
embodiments, such antobodies and proteins can be N or C-terminal modified, e.g., by C-terminal<br>
amidation or N-terminal acetylation.<br>
[0055]	A chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions are derived from<br>
different animal species, such as those having a variable region derived from a murine mAb and<br>
a human immunoglobulin constant region. (See, e.g., Cabilly et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; and<br>
Boss et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,816,397.) Techniques for the production of chimeric antibodies<br>
include the splicing the genes from a mouse antibody molecule of appropriate antigen specificity<br>
together with genes from a human antibody molecule of appropriate biological activity (see for<br>
example, Morrison, et al., 1984, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 81, 6851-6855; Neuberger, et al., 1984,<br>
Nature 312, 604-608; Takeda, et al., 1985, Nature 314, 452-454).<br>
[0056]	Humanized antibodies are antibody molecules from non-human species having<br>
one or more complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) from the non-human species and<br>
framework regions from a human immunoglobulin molecule. Techniques for the production of<br>
humanized antibodies are secribed for example in Queen, U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,089 and Winter,<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,225,539. The extent of the framework regions and CDRs have been precisely<br>
defined (see, "Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest", Kabat, E. et al., U.S.<br>
Department of Health and Human Services (1983).<br>
[0057]	Single chain antibodies are formed by linking the heavy and light chain fragments<br>
of the Fv region via an amino acid bridge, resulting in a single chain polypeptide. Techniques for<br>
the production of single chain antibodies are described for example in U.S. Pat. 4,946,778; Bird,<br>
1988, Science 242, 423-426; Huston, et al., 1988, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85, 5879-5883;<br>
and Ward, et al., 1989, Nature 334, 544-546).<br><br>
-18-<br>
[0058]	A bispecific antibody is a genetically engineered antibody which recognizes two<br>
types of targets e.g. (1) a specific epitope and (2) a "trigger" molecule e.g. Fc receptors on<br>
myeloid cells. Such bispecific antibodies can be prepared either by chemical conjugation,<br>
hybridoma, or recombinant molecular biology techniques.<br>
[0059]	Antibody fragments include but are not limited to: The F(ab')2 fragments, which<br>
can be produced by pepsin digestion of the antibody molecule and the F(ab') fragments, which<br>
can be generated by reducing the disulfide bridges of the F(ab')2 fragments. Alternatively, Fab<br>
expression libraries may be constructed (Huse, et al, 1989, Science 246, 1275-1281) to allow<br>
rapid and easy identification of monoclonal Fab fragments with the desired specificity.<br>

may be produced by any method known to one of skill in the art, such as the method described in<br>

[0070]	In an embodiment of the invention, the contacting is done for between about 1<br>

[0071]	In an embodiment of the invention, the contacting is done at a temperature from<br>

[0078]	The subject invention also provides use of a cetylpyridinium salt for purifying a<br>

[0079]	As to the pH, in embodiments where the mixture is contacted with an effective<br>

charged, the pH will vary with the nature of the target protein. However, the pH is preferably<br>
between pH7 and pH11; preferred ranges are from about pH7 and pH10, pH7 to pH9, pH8 to<br>
pH11, pH8 to pH10 or pH8 to pH9.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
[0080]	The examples which follow are set forth to aid in understanding the invention but<br>
are not intended to and should not be construed to limit its scope in any way.<br>
EXAMPLE 1. Use of CPC for Purification of Recombinant Mammalian Uricase<br><br>
-21-<br>
1.1.	Background<br>
[0081]	Pharmaceutical grade uricase must be essentially free of non-uricase protein.<br>
Mammalian uricase (isoelectric point of 8.67) produced in E. coli accumulated intracellularly in<br>
precipitates similar to organelles referred to as inclusion bodies (IBs) which can be easily<br>
isolated for further purification. In contrast to the classical view that IBs contain scrambled/ mis-<br>
folded expressed protein, these IB-like elements contain correctly folded uricase in a precipitated<br>
form. Exposure of uricase IB-like elements to an alkaline pH, e.g., about pH 9-11, re-dissolved<br>
the precipitated protein. The uricase content in solubilized IB-like elements was about 40 - 60%<br>
and required extensive purification to obtain a homogeneous uricase preparation. Herein, we<br>
demonstrate purification of uricase and other protein with CPC that can be assessed by a variety<br>
of methods. For example, mammalian uricase purity can be assessed by determining the specific<br>
activity, the number of bands which appear following electrophoresis and staining of SDS-PAGE<br>
gels, and the number and size of peaks which appear in a chromatogram following size exclusion<br>
HPLC.<br>
1.2.	MATERIALS AND METHODS<br>
1.2.1.	50 mM NaHCO3 Buffer (pH 10.3)<br>
[0082]	This buffer was prepared by dissolving NaHCO3 to a final concentration of 50<br>
mM. The pH was adjusted to 10.2 -10.4. Depending on starting pH, 0.1 M HC1 or 1 N NaOH<br>
may be used.<br>
1.2.2.	10% CPC solution<br>
[0083]	10% CPC was prepared by dissolving CPC in distilled water to a final<br>
concentration of 10 gr/ 100ml.<br><br>
-22-<br>
1.2.3.	Recombinant porcine uricase expression<br>
[0084]	Recombinant mammalian uricase (urate oxidase) was expressed in E. coli K-12<br>
strain W3110 F", as described in International Patent Publication WO00/08196 of Duke<br>
University and United States Patent Provisional Application No. 60/095,489, incorporated herein<br>
by reference in their entireties.<br>
1.2.4.	Culture and harvest of uricase-producing bacteria<br>
[0085]	Bacteria were cultured at 37°C in growth medium containing casein hydrolysate,<br>
yeast extract, salts, glucose, and ammonia.<br>
[0086]	Following culture, bacteria in which uricase accumulated were harvested by<br>
centrifugation and washed with water to remove residual culture medium.<br>
1.2.5.	Cell disruption and recovery<br>
[0087]	Harvested cell pellet was suspended in 50 mM Tris buffer, pH 8.0 and 10 mM<br>
EDTA and brought to a final volume of approximately 20 times the dry cell weight (DCW).<br>
Lysozyme, at a concentration of 2000-3000 units/ml, was added to the suspended pellet while<br>
mixing, and incubated for 16-20 hours, at 4 - 8°C.<br>
[0088]	The cell lysate was treated by high shear mixing and subsequently by sonication.<br>
The suspension was diluted with an equal volume of deionized water and centrifuged. The pellet,<br>
containing uricase inclusion bodies, was diluted with deionized water (w/w) and centrifuged to<br>
further remove impurities. The pellet obtained from this last wash step was saved for further<br>
processing, and the supernatant was discarded.<br>
1.2.6.	Dissolution<br><br>
-23-<br>
[0089]	The inclusion body (IB) pellet was suspended in 50 mM NaHCO3 buffer, pH<br>
10.3±0.1. The suspension was incubated at a temperature of 25±2°C for about 0.5 - 2 hours to<br>
allow solubilization of the IB-derived uricase.<br>
1.2.7.	CPC treatment<br>
[0090]	10% CPC solution was added in aliquots to homogenized IBs (pH 10.3), while<br>
briskly mixing, to obtain the desired CPC concentration. The sample was incubated for 1 to 24<br>
hours as indicated, during which precipitating flakes formed. The sample was centrifuged for 15<br>
minutes, at 12,000 x g. The pellet and supernatant were separated, and the pellet was suspended<br>
with 50 mM NaHCO3 buffer (pH 10.3) to the original volume. The enzymatic activity of each<br>
fraction was determined, and the fractions were concentrated and dialyzed to remove the<br>
remaining CPC.<br>
1.2.8.	Protein assay<br>
[0091]	The protein content of aliquots of treated and untreated IB samples was<br>
determined using the modified Bradford method (Macart and Gerbaut (1982) Clin Chim Acta<br>
122:93-101).<br>
1.2.9.	Uricase assay<br>
1.2.9.1.	Enzymatic activity<br>
[0092]	Activity of uricase was measured by the UV method (Fridovich, I. (1965) The<br>
competitive inhibition of uricase by oxonate and by related derivatives of s-triazines. J Biol<br>
Chem, 240, 2491-2494; modified by incorporation of 1mg/ml BSA). Enzymatic reaction rate<br>
was determined, in duplicate samples, by measuring the decrease in absorbance at 292 nm<br>
resulting from the oxidation of uric acid to allantoin. One activity unit is defined as the quantity<br><br>
-24-<br>
of uricase required to oxidize one µmole of uric acid per minute, at 25°C, at the specified<br>
conditions. Uricase potency is expressed in activity units per mg protein (U/mg).<br>
[0093]	The extinction coefficient of 1 mM uric acid at 292 nm in a 1 cm path length is<br>
12.2. Therefore, oxidation of 1 µmole of uric acid per ml reaction mixture results in a decrease in<br>
absorbance of 12.2 mA292. The absorbance change with time (AA292 per minute) was derived<br>
from the linear portion of the curve. Uricase activity was then calculated as follows:<br>
Activity (U/ml)= <br>
Where :DF = Dilution factor;<br>
VRM = Total volume of reaction mixture (in µl)<br>
Vs = Volume of diluted sample used in reaction mixture (in µl)<br>
1.2.9.2.	HPLC analysis with Superdex 200<br>
[0094]	The amount and the relative percentage of the native uricase enzyme, as well as<br>
possible contaminants, were quantified according to the elution profile obtained by HPLC using<br>
a Superdex 200 column. Duplicate samples of uricase solution were injected into the column.<br>
The areas of each peak and the percent of total area were automatically calculated and<br>
summarized in the adjacent tables.<br>
1.2.10. SDS-PAGE analysis<br>
[0095]	Proteins in samples containing ~20 g protein/ lane, were separated on 15%<br>
SDS-PAGE gels. The resulting gels were stained with Coomassie brilliant blue.<br>
1.3. RESULTS<br>
[0096]	The effects of CPC (0.005 - 0.075%) treatment (for 1 - 24 hours) on uricase<br>
activity recovered in the supernatant, and its purity are presented in Table 1 and FIG 1. Prior to<br><br>
-25-<br>
CPC treatment (at pH 10.3), the protein concentration was 1.95 mg/ml, and the specific<br>
enzymatic activity was 3.4 - 4.67 U/mg. The results presented in FIG. IB indicate that within<br>
each incubation period, the protein concentration of the supernatant decreased with increasing<br>
CPC concentration. At less than 0.04% CPC, a relatively minor effect on the protein<br>
concentration was observed. CPC, in concentrations of 0.04% to 0.075%, could reduce the<br>
protein concentration to about 50% of the original concentration.<br>
[0097]	In contrast to the effects of CPC on total protein concentration, the total soluble<br>
uricase activity was not significantly influenced by increasing CPC concentration and incubation<br>
time (FIG. 1A). Within each incubation period, the specific enzymatic activity (FIG. 1C)<br>
consistently increased as a function of CPC concentration within the range 0.04% - 0.075%. This<br>
increase was a result of specific removal of non-uricase proteins. Since the specific enzymatic<br>
activity of the final purified enzyme was approximately 9 U/mg, the majority of contaminating<br>
proteins were removed by CPC precipitation. Indeed, HPLC and SDS-PAGE analyses performed<br>
support this conclusion.<br>

SPECIFIC ACTIVITY AND PURITY<br><br><br>
-26-<br><br>
1.4. Confirmation Of CPC enhancement Of uricase purity<br>
[0098]	Uricase-containing IBs were isolated and solubilized, as described in section 1.3.<br>
Samples of the soluble material were analyzed prior to CPC treatment and following filtration of<br>
the CPC-precipitated protein.<br>
1.4.1.	HPLC analysis of non-uricase proteins following treatment with 0.075%<br>
CPC<br>
[0099]	HPLC analysis of solubilized IBs indicated that the uricase-associated peak<br>
(retention time (RT) -25.5 minutes) comprises about 46% of the protein of the crude IB sample<br>
(FIG 2A). Following CPC treatment, the uricase-associated peak increased to approximately<br>
92% of the protein (FIG 2B), and was accompanied by significant reduction of the contaminants<br>
eluting between RT 15-22 min. (FIG 2A). The area of the uricase peak is approximately 70%<br>
of that in FIG 2A. Thus, these results indicate a doubling of uricase purity resulting from<br>
removal of non-uricase protein upon CPC treatment.<br>
1.4.2.	Effect of 0.075% CPC on enzymatic activity<br>
[0100]	The results (presented in Table 2) indicate that mass balance of uricase activity<br>
was retained during the treatment process. CPC exposure was found to precipitate 60% of all<br>
proteins in solution. More than 85% of the enzymatic activity remained in solution, thus the<br>
removal of extraneous protein afforded an increase in specific activity of the produced<br>
supernatant of more than 110%. As in most purification processes, some of the desired activity<br><br>
-27-<br>
remained in the pellet. In this instance, only 17.6% of the original activity remained in the pellet<br>
(and was extracted using 50 mM sodium bicarbonate (7 mSi, pH 10.3) for analytical purposes),<br>
which is a relatively minor fraction of the total amount.<br>

1.4.3. SDS-PAGE Analysis Following Treatment with 0.075% CPC<br>
[0101]	Samples of the crude uricase, prior to exposure to CPC, and of the subsequent<br>
fractions, following separation of soluble and insoluble material, following CPC treatment,<br>
centrifugal separation of the fractions, and reconstitution of the pellet obtained after<br>
centrifugation, containing equal amounts of protein were analyzed by SDS-PAGE methodology.<br>
The results (see FIG. 3) show the presence of contaminating proteins prior to CPC treatment.<br>
Following CPC treatment, the pellet contained most of the contaminating proteins, while the<br>
supernatant contained uricase that resulted in the single major protein band.<br>
EXAMPLE 2. Effect of CPC on Purification of Single Chain (scFv) Antibodies<br>
2.1. MATERIALS AND METHODS<br>
2.1.1. Buffers<br>
2.1.1.1.	Inclusion body dissolution buffer<br>
[0102]	Dissolution buffer contained 6 M urea, 50 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.1 M<br>
cysteine. The pH of the buffer was titrated to 8.5.<br><br>
-28-<br>
2.1.1.2.	Folding buffer<br>
[0103]	Folding buffer contained 1 M urea, 0.25 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.1 M<br>
cysteine. The pH of the buffer was titrated to 10.0.<br>
2.1.2.	Expression of scFv Antibodies in Bacteria<br>
[0104]	ScFv antibodies (pi 8.9) were expressed in E. coll transformed with a vector<br>
encoding a scFv having cysteine-lysine-alanine-lysine at the carboxyl end as described in PCT<br>
Publication WO 02/059264, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
2.1.3.	Culture and Harvest of scFv Antibody-Producing Bacteria<br>
[0105]	ScFv-containing bacterial cells were cultured in minimal medium, at pH 7.2, and<br>
supplemented with L-arginine, final concentration 0.5%, during the five hour period prior to<br>
induction. Expression of scFv was induced by limitation of glucose amount in the medium.<br>
ScFv-containing bacterial cells were harvested from culture by ultra filtration.<br>
2.1.4.	Cell disruption and recovery of inclusion bodies<br>
[0106]	Harvested cell pellet was suspended in 50 mM Tris buffer, pH 8.0 and 10 mM<br>
EDTA and brought to a final volume of approximately 20 times the dry cell weight (DCW).<br>
Lysozyme, at a concentration of 2000-3000 units/ml, was added to the suspended pellet while<br>
mixing, then incubated for 16-20 hours, at 4 °C.<br>
[0107]	The cell lysate was then treated by high shear mixing and subsequently by<br>
sonication. The scFv antibody-containing inclusion bodies were recovered by centrifugation at<br>
10,000 x g. The pellet was diluted approximately sixteen fold with deionized water (w/w) and<br>
centrifuged to further remove impurities. The pellet obtained from this last wash step was saved<br>
for further processing.<br>
2.1.5.	Dissolution and refolding<br><br>
-29-<br>
[0108]	The IB-enriched pellet was suspended in inclusion body dissolution buffer (see<br>
above), incubated for 5 hours at room temperature, and refolded in vitro in a solution based on<br>
arginine/oxidized glutathione. After refolding, the protein was dialyzed and concentrated by<br>
tangential flow filtration against containing urea/phosphate buffer.<br>
2.1.6. CPC treatment<br>
[0109]	10% CPC solution was added to the scFv refolding mixture to a final<br>
concentration of 0.02%, and after 1 - 2 hr incubation, at room temperature, the precipitate was<br>
removed by filtration. The supernatant contained the scFv antibody.<br>
2.2. RESULTS<br>
2.2.1. Effect of CPC concentration on recoverable scFv antibody<br>
[0110]	The effects of CPC (at pH 7.5 or 10) on scFv antibody purity and recovery are<br>
presented in Table 3. Prior to CPC treatment, the initial amount of IB protein was 73 mg,<br>
containing 15.87 mg scFv antibody as determined by HPLC analysis on Superdex 75. The<br>
retention time (RT) of the scFv antibody-containing peaks was approximately 20.6 minutes. The<br>
results indicate that recovery of total protein generally decreased with increasing CPC<br>
concentration, and recovery of scFv antibody remained &gt;80% when the CPC concentration was<br>
at pH 10. Thus, scFv antibody purification was achieved by treatment with 0.01 to 0.03% CPC.<br><br>
-30-<br>
Table 3. Effect of CPC treatment on scFv antibody recovery and purity<br><br>
2.3. CONFIRMATION OF CPC ENHANCMENT OF scFv ANTIBODY PURITY<br>
2.3.1.	HPLC analysis of scFv recovery following treatment with CPC<br>
[0111]	HPLC analysis of refolded protein indicates that the scFv antibody-associated<br>
peak (retention time (RT) -20.6 minutes) comprised about 22.7% of the protein of the total<br>
protein (FIG 4B). The chromatogram of FIG 4C indicates that following treatment with 0.02%<br>
CPC, the scFv antibody-associated peak of the supernatant comprised approximately 75.9% of<br>
the total protein injected, a 3.3-fold purification. Thus, CPC treatment removed protein<br>
impurities from scFv antibody solutions.<br>
2.3.2.	SDS-PAGE analysis on scFv recovery following treatment with CPC<br>
[0112]	The results (see FIG. 5) indicate that prior to CPC treatment, the sample contained<br>
significant amounts of a large number of proteins. Similarly, following CPC treatment, the pellet<br><br>
-31 -<br>
contained a large number of proteins. In contrast, the post-CPC treatment supernatant contained<br>
one major protein band, that of scFv antibody.<br>
EXAMPLE 3. Effect of CPC on purification of recombinant interferon-beta<br>
[0113]	Interferon beta (IFN-beta, pi 8.5-8.9) was expressed in E-coli by known methods.<br>
Nagola, S. et al., Nature, 284:316 (1980); Goeddel, D. V. et al., Nature, 287:411 (1980);<br>
Yelverton, E. et al., Nuc. Acid Res., 9:731 (1981); Streuli, M. et al., Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. (U.S.),<br>
78:2848 (1981); European Pat. Application No. 28033, published May 6, 1981; 321134,<br>
published July 15, 1981; 34307 published Aug. 26, 1981; and Belgian Patent No. 837379, issued<br>
July 1, 1981 described various methods for the production of beta-interferon employing<br>
recombinant DNA techniques. Procedures for recovering and purifying bacterially produced<br>
IFNs are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,450,103; 4,315,852; 4,343,735; and 4,343,736; and<br>
Derynck et al., Nature (1980) 287:193-197 and Scandella and Kornberg, Biochemistry, 10:4447<br>
(1971). Inclusion bodies containing IFN-beta were isolated and solubilized.<br>
[0114]	The resulting solution was treated with CPC. The results shown in Figure 6<br>
indicate a substantial decrease in the level of contaminating proteins present after CPC treatment.<br>
The actual amount of IFN-beta (area under the peak) did not change appreciably following CPC<br>
treatment.<br>
[0115]	Table 4 summarizes the effects of the CPC treatment. Total protein (Bradford)<br>
decreased by 40%, UV absorbance decreased by about 40% but the amount of IFN-beta<br>
remained unchanged.<br><br>
-32-<br>
TABLE 4.<br><br>
a Quantified by Vydac C4 column<br>
b The SEC profile contained several peaks. The peak eluting at 13 min (R.T. 13 min) is reduced<br>
upon treatment with CPC and corresponds to the region where high molecular weight<br>
proteins and variants thereof elute.<br>
EXAMPLE 4. Effect of CPC on purification of factor Xa inhibitor.<br>
[0116]	CPC was used to purify leech factor Xa inhibitor. Leech factor Xa inhibitor<br>
(FXal, pi 8.4-9.1) may be produced as described in United States Patent No. 6,211,341 and<br>
International Patent Publication No. WO94/23735. Following isolation of FXal-containing<br>
inclusion bodies (IBs), the FXal was purified from IBs substantially as described in example 1.<br>
After dissolution of the IB pellet, the preparation was incubated with 10% CPC solution. Then,<br>
the mixture was centrifuged for 15 minutes, at 12,000 x g. The pellet and supernatant were<br>
separated. The pellet was suspended with 50 mM NaHCO3 buffer to the original volume. The<br>
pellet and supernatant were separately concentrated and dialyzed to remove the remaining CPC.<br>
The protein content and activity were assayed and FXaI was found to be the predominant<br>
component in the supernatant and substantially absent from the pellet. The results indicate that<br>
CPC treatment enhanced the efficiency of recovery and the purity of the recovered FXaI.<br>
EXAMPLE 5. Purification of carboxypeptidase B (CPB) by CPC<br><br>
-33-<br>
[0117]	Identical amounts of inclusion bodies obtained from a clone expressing CPB were<br>
solubilized in 8 M urea, pH 9.5 (control and test). Production of CPB is described in<br>
International Patent Publication No. WO96/23064 and in United States Patent No. 5,948,668.<br>
The test sample was treated with CPC 0.11% and clarified by filtration prior to refolding.<br>
Refolding of control and test samples were carried out by diluting the solutions 1:8 into refolding<br>
buffer. After treatment with endoproteinase over night at ambient temperature, equal amounts of<br>
control and test solutions were loaded onto a DEAE Sepharose column. The column was<br>
washed and the active enzyme was subsequently eluted with 60 mM Sodium Chloride in 20 mM<br>
Tris buffer pH 8.<br>
TABLE 5.<br><br>
(*) Protein determination was carried out by the Bradford method.<br>
(**) Prior to refolding the protein was inactive<br>
[0118]	The results presented in Table 5 show that total OD in the CPC treated material<br>
dropped by 49.5% and the total protein content was reduced by 44.5%. Interestingly, total<br><br>
-34-<br>
enzyme activity recovered in the CPC treated sample increased by 79%, suggesting that CPC<br>
removed a component that partially inhibited generation of active enzyme.<br>
