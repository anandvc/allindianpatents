				<td>WONDER HEALING AND VAT ROG HERBAL DRUG<br>
In old days battles were fought with traditional weapons and warriors received different types of injuries, inflicted by them in warfield. Descriptions of herbal formula are present in ancient literature, which applied at night to warfield wounds, made them healed before next morning. If we believe on this, it can be assumed that those herbal formula might have some active ingredients capable to promote so quick wound healing. Although the knowledge about those miraculous drugs became extinct with passage of time but there is possibility that this property of healing agent may still be present in more or less extent in some herbs even today.<br>
	Pain syndromes of musculo-skeletal disorders and arthritis which<br>
	constitute a large group and encountered as very common problems in<br>
clinical practice, are regarded as autoimmune disorders. They have in common wide spread immunologic and inflammatory alterations of connective tissue. Although these are taken as acquired diseases their causes cannot be determined in most instances. However, heredity, environmental antigens, immunoglobulin deficiency, inappropriate T lymphocyte function, immune complexes, anaphylaxis, cytolysis or some combination of all of these factors appear to play causative and pathological roles.<br>
In fundamental 'Ayurved pathy' these diseases are illustrated under chapter of 'Vat Rog' which consists of 2 classes namely 'Amvat' and 'Vat Vyadhi' and their cause is attributed mainly to distrubance in 'Vat Dosh'. According to Ayurvedic philosophy,<br><br>
'Dosh' are of 3 types - 'Vat', 'Pitta' and 'Kaf and any kind of distrubance in them is responsible for causation of disease. According to 'Sharangdhar Samhita' 'Pitta', 'Kaf, 'Mai1 and 'Dhatu' are handicap to make independent motion, while 'Vat' actively moves. And 'Vat' carries at its disposal other 'Dosh' 'Mal' and 'Dhatu' from one place to another inside body just like air is responsible for movement of clouds in sky. This is clear by following 'Shlok'.<br>
Hence abnormality in 'Vat Dosh' is mainly important in causation of diseases under 'Vat Rog'.<br>
'Amvat' is natural disturbance of 'Vat Dosh' and its symptoms are swelling in joints either generalized or confined to one part of body, pain, numbness, heaviness, fever, indigestion, loss of apetite and excess feeling of thirst, which are narrated in 'Madhav Nidan1 in following 'Shlok'.<br>
'Vat Vyadhi' is abnormal disease caused by pathological disturbance in 'Vat Dosh' and its 80 types are described in Avurvedic literature.<br>
NSAID and other anti-inflammatory drugs like gold salts, corticosteroids, antimalarials, cytotoxic drugs and other medicines are being used for treatment of pain syndromes of musculo-skeletal disorders and arthritic diseases along with physical therapy and other conservative<br>
and surgical measures. In 'Ayurved' gold preparations like 'Vrihatvat Chintamani Ras' and various 'Guggulu' preparations are mostly employed for treatment of these diseases. But no measures till known are curative. Further, gastro-intestinal side effects in which gastric ulceration and bleeding are most concerning and other toxic reactions are quiet frequent. This emphasize a strong need of effective drug for these diseases, free from side effects and possessing property of tonic. This invention relates to such valuable single herbal drug which is highly effective for fresh deep wound healing and induces a prominent action on pain syndromes of musculo-skeletal disorders, arthritis, Transverse myelitis and liver disorders.<br>
While searching a effective single medicinal plant for above mentioned diseases, encouraging results were obtained with use of Tridex procumbens herb. A clinical trial of this single herbal drug was conducted on 1878 patients over last one decade mainly on Fresh Deep Wounds, Pain Syndromes of Musculo-skeletal Disorders and Arthritis, but when observations were taken this medicinal herb showed multifold action and wonderful merits on other diseases also. Patients primarily treated for these diseases, after taking full course of treatment with this herbal drug got benefited from other associated diseases also.<br>
The diseases taken under clinical trial were grouped as follow :<br>
I.	Fresh Deep Wounds<br>
II.	Pain Syndromes of Musculo-skeletal Disorders<br>
III.	Arthritis<br>
(i)       Sero-positive (ii)     Sero-negative<br>
IV.	Other Diseases<br>
Diagnosis of above diseases were made clinically supported by relevant investigations.<br>

MANNER  OF   LOCAL  TREATMENT,  ORAL ADMINISTRATION AND DOSAGE OF HERBAL DRUG:<br>
As a drug the medicinal herb was administered as follows:<br>
(a)	Paste Form :<br>
For fresh deep wounds this single herbal drug was used as freshly prepared 'paste' from green part of the plant (leaf and trunk), which was applied locally.<br>
(b)	Powder Form :<br>
For pain syndromes of musculo-skelatal disorders, and arthritis and other diseases this single herbal drug was used orally in powder form of whole plant 'Panchang' with four black peppers along with tap water in dose of 6 gm morning and evening for 6-12 weeks duration.<br>
(c)	Kwath Form :<br>
In later stage of trial for same indications this herbal drug was used in Kwath form instead of powder form in same dosage and duration and this proved to be more beneficial.<br>
The process of kwath preparation is -<br>
the dose of drug<br>
x 16 times of water along with 4 black peppers<br>
slowly heated till l/4th remained<br>
After filtration residue discarded and filtrate was taken as kwath.<br>
DIET AND LIVING PATTERN :<br>
For pain syndromes of musculo-skeletal disorders and arthritis diet and living pattern were also given due care as follows :<br>
Advise in Diet Pattern :<br>
Radish, salad, curd, green leafy vegetables, rajma, paneer, egg, meat and fish were avoided in diet. Whereas in pulse mixture of lentil (masur), red gram (arhar), green gram (moong) and black gram (urad) in diluted form was advised in diet.<br>
Advise in Living Pattern :<br>
Bathing with warm water was advised, living in direct contact of air from air conditioner, cooler and fan was restricted too and drinking of cold water from refrigerator was also denied to patients.<br>
PERCENTAGE  SCALE  USED FOR ASSESSMENT OF RESULTS<br>
To assess results of clinical trial the response after complete course of treatment was classified as under:<br>
(i)      Wonderful : Hundred percent effective or faster relief or more<br>
effective where other medicines were not effective<br>
(ii)     Excellent:   More than 90% relief (iii)    Good:         70-90% relief (iv)    Significant : 50-70% relief in manifestation of disease.<br>

Relief in Other Associated Diseases :<br>
While used primarily on above mentioned diseases, this single herbal drug acts favourably on the following diseases also.<br>
(1)	Acid peptic disease<br>
(2)	Pain in abdomen due to various causes<br>
(3)	Irritable bowel syndrome<br>
(4)	Pedal oedema<br>
(5)	Leucorrhoea<br>
This drug also possesses property of tonic and causes feeling of<br>
betterment and improved vitality.<br>
IMPORTANT     OBSERVATIONS     REGARDING     MODE     OF ACTION OF THIS SINGLE HERBAL DRUG :<br>
1. An important observation about peculiar mode of action of this single herbal drug was noted in clinical trial that in almost all cases of pain syndromes of musculo-skeletal disorders and arthritic diseases in so far as during the course of treatment, generally after 1-3 weeks of taking drug, a occurrence of sudden aggravation of pain and swelling of joints or tissues, effected by disease process prior to beginning of treatment and also of new joints or musculo-skeletal tissues which were not clinically involved previously, appeared usually for 3-7 days. During this period to subside the bout of aggravation of disease trouble, the dose of herbal drug was reduced to half and symptomatic treatment in form of NSAID and other drugs sometimes even including steroids was given for 3 or 4 days to patients. This bout of aggravation of ailment was followed by quick recovery and noticeable relief to patients from their trouble and substantial improvement in presenting features of disease in respect with objective parameters also.<br>
This phenomena of aggravation of disease trouble followed by quick recovery, may be due to effect of some substances which are responsible for causation of ailment and present in body tissues because of pathological disturbances in 'Vat Dosh'. The possibility that due to action of this single herbal drug, these substances are firstly coming out from particular tissues into general circulation causing the bout of aggravation and then finally excreted out from body resulting in quick recovery, should be considered. Further study is needed to reach at definite conclusion about this phenomena.<br>
2.	The   frequency   of urination   increased   during  course  of<br>
treatment with this drug which also resulted in decrease of<br>
oedema.<br>
3.	This herbal drug also possesses a laxative property and<br>
increased frequency of defaecation with formation of soft<br>
loose stool occurred during treatment by this drug.<br><br><br><br>
CONCLUSION :<br>
On the basis of this study investigator deduces that this single herbal drug has several merits and will be one of most useful drugs in future.<br><br><br></td>
