TITLE: REACTIVE CH ROM ATE PASSIVATION FOR GALVANIZED MATERIAL<br>
This present invention relates to development of a reactive-chromate-based passivation<br>
formulation which can be applied as a post treatment coating on the galvanized sheet<br>
surface in continuous galvanizing line, This passivation enhances the white rust<br>
resistance as well as gives an excellent resistance to darkening and fretting corrosion<br>
on galvanized surface.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
In the engineering and construction sectors, hot dip galvanized steel sheets are<br>
preferred by the user for their appearance and long term corrosion protection.<br>
However, the freshly produced galvanized sheets are highly susceptible to external<br>
factors that lead to surface degradation during storage and transport. These surface<br>
defects are mainly in the form of white rust, darkening and fretting corrosion. The<br>
presence of any one or their combination causes poor acceptance of tfie material by the<br>
customer. For these reasons, practically all galvanized sheets are given a cbromate<br>
passivation treatment after galvanizing in a continuous line. A common passivating<br>
agent used is tiie chromic acid leading to a complex chromate film of Cr (IV) and Cr<br>
(IE) in compound form on a galvanized surface. Although the generation of white rust<br>
is effectively prevented by subjecting galvanized steel sheets to a chromate treatment<br>
but tine other surface defects like blackening and / or fretting corrosion occurs in a<br>
relatively short time during storage, usage or transport. To overcome these surface<br>
defects, we need to understand these defects.<br><br>
-3-<br>
White rust: This is found particularly on fresh galvanized, bright surface and especially<br>
in crevices between closely packed sheets. White rust is a white, crumbly, and porous<br>
coating consisting of 2ZnC03.3Zn(OH)2 together with ZnO and voluminous B - Zn(OH)z<br>
When zinc coating corrode in open air, zinc oxide and zinc hydroxide are normally<br>
formed. If the supply of air to the surface of the zinc is restricted, as in a narrow<br>
crevice, there is not enough carbobn dioxide for the subsequent formation of a zinc<br>
carbonate layer. The layer of zinc oxide and zinc hydroxide is voluminous and porous<br>
and adheres only loosely to the zinc surface. Consequently, it does not protect the zinc<br>
surface against oxygen in the water. Corrosion can, therefore, proceed as long as there<br>
is moisture left on the surface.<br>
Darkening; Darkening is more liable to develop when GI sheets are stored in stacked<br>
form after cutting into pieces or in coiled form than when these are left standing in bare<br>
form in a room. It blackens on usages as well in the open, or in enclosed of normal air.<br>
It has been recognized that this phenomenon occurs more readily in steel sheets in<br>
which the coating surface has been activated by skin pass rolling (usually 1-3% draft)<br>
following zinc coating, and in steel sheets coated with a molten zinc^aluminum alloy<br>
containing tcvt-ij! % of akiu'mum. Also on hot-dipped galvanized steel sheets (non-<br>
skin-passed sheets), black tarnish due to the spangles is occasionally observed in spotty<br>
form during ling-term storage. Literature suggests that the larger impurity diffusion in<br>
dull spangle is responsible for its lower resistance to corrosion attack and the<br>
blackening is produced by diffusion and oxidation of antimony /lead that is used as<br>
surfactant.<br><br>
-4-<br>
The galvanized sheet looks black, apparently because the basic zinc carbonate of which<br>
it is composed, and which is represented as (ZnCO.sub.3)x.[Zn(OH).sub.2]y, like white<br>
rust, has a particle diameter felling within the visible light wavelength range of 400 to<br>
700 nm, and is, therefore, very likely to scatter and absorb light. The black patina is<br>
considered as a product of corrosion formed in an environment lacking oxygen, and<br>
particularly with the progress of corrosion from the grain boundary.<br>
Fretting Corrosion: The fretting corrosion appears as light to dark black spots / marks<br>
distributed over the surface. The mechanism of fretting corrosion is that asperities<br>
rubbing together cause attrition and the debris so formed further aids the process. The<br>
conditions necessary are that the small surface shall be in finer contact or shall move<br>
only over very small amplitude. This condition occurs during transporting tiie coils as<br>
tiiey normally stand on tiie circumference that initiate the fretting to take place. It has<br>
been recognized that this phenomenon occurs more readily in steel sheets coated with<br>
a molten zinc-aluminum alloy containing several % of aluminum. The surface is entirely<br>
covered by a tiiin film containing aluminium and oxygen in approximately a 2:3 atom<br>
ratio and the film tiiiekness was of the order of 5nm. This aluminium oxide layer<br>
aggravates the fretting corrosion during the transportation.<br>
PRIOR ART;<br>
The above problems are experienced by most of the hot dip galvanized coil producer<br>
and solved by their own way. A large number of literatures and patents are already<br>
made in tiiis area and few are mentioned here.<br><br>
-5-<br>
Japanese Patient Application Laid-Open No. 114695/82 discloses a process for producing<br>
galvanized steel sheets superior resistance to black tarnishing and intergranular<br>
corrosion. This technique comprises treating the galvanized sheets with an alkali metal<br>
carbonate solution, followed by electroplating the treated sheets with zinc. According to<br>
this patent application, the oxides of Zn, Al, and Fe formed on the hot-dipped<br>
galvanized surface are completely dissolved by the treatment with an alkali metal<br>
carbonate solution and this permits the black tarnishing and the intergranular corrosion<br>
to be prevented even when the subsequent zinc electroplating produced a thin film.<br>
Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. Sho 59-177381 proposed flashing treatment<br>
with an aqueous solution containing Ni or Co ions as a method of preventing a black<br>
patina from appearing after ehromate treatment. The surface of a zinc or zinc-alloy<br>
plated steel sheet is given flashing treatment with an aqueous solution having a pH of 1<br>
to 4, orll to 13, and containing Ni or Co ions, or both prior to its ehromate treatment,<br>
after it is washed with water, a ehromate film is formed thereon.<br>
A similar theory is patented by the USA patent 4663245, a steel sheet coated by hot<br>
dipping with zinc or with a zinc alloy containing low concentrations of Al and Mg is<br>
immersed for a short period of time in a solution of Ni ions and / or Co ions or sprayed<br>
witfi ttiis solution and is subjected to the usual chromating, thereby achieving a superior<br>
effect of preventing black tarnish.<br><br>
-6-<br>
USA patient 6280535 discusses about a chromating process which combines both the<br>
flashing process and chromating process as a single step process by incorporating tiie<br>
metal ion which is used in tfie flashing treatment (Ni or Co) into the chromatining bath.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore, an object of the present invention to propose a chromate treatment<br>
coating on the galvanized sheet surface which eliminates tfie disadvantage of prior Art.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose a chromate treatment coating on<br>
the galvanized sheet surface which reduces the formation of white rust on the<br>
galvanized sheet surfaee.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to propose a chromate treatment coating on<br>
the galvanized sheet surface which reduces the formation of darkening on the<br>
galvanized sheet.<br>
A still further object of the present invention is to propose a chromate treatment<br>
coating on the galvanized sheet surface which reduces the formation of fretting<br>
corrosion.<br>
As yet further object present invention is to propose a chromate treatment coating on<br>
the galvanized sheet surface which is eco-fnendly.<br><br>
-7-<br>
PETAIL DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The chromate treatment was given on the galvanized sheet in a continuous hot-dip<br>
galvanizing line. Regular spangles galvanized sheet material was produced in<br>
commercial line and were chromated by the invented chromate solution.<br>
The invented chromate solution comprising: -<br>
Chromium	- 8.76 g/l.<br>
Nitrate irons	- 3.3 g/l<br>
Cobalt	- 0.2 g/l<br>
Ruorosilicic acid - 0.7 g/l<br>
The chromic acid was used to make chromium formulation, the nitrate ions produced<br>
from nitric acid and cobalt nitrate, ttie cobalt ions produces from cobalt nitrate and the<br>
30% concentration of flurosilic acid were used.<br>
For comparison study, the galvanized sheet material treated by commercially available<br>
chromate passivation solution was taken.<br>
The pH of the invented chromate solution is maintained in the range of 0.7 to 2.5 m6<br>
the temperature of the chromate solution is maintained is range of 25 to 65 degree<br>
centigrade. The chromate film formed on the galvanized surface having a coating<br>
weight of 5 - 40 mg/m2 in term of total chromium formation. The duration of wet<br>
coating on the surface is in the range of 1-5 second for the running strip before drying.<br><br>
-8-<br>
The Chromate passivation Performance was measured by salt spray test as per ASTM B<br>
117. According to this specification, 5% sodium chloride solution is atomized in a salt<br>
spray chamber at 35°C with the solution pH around 7. the test panels are placed at an<br>
angle of 45° in the chamber, exposed to the salt for a certain period and the initiation<br>
of white rust formation on the sample was recorded. The 5% white rust on the<br>
galyanized surface was considered as a cut-off value for the chromate passivation<br>
performance evaluation.<br>
The aluminium leaching from the galvanizing surface after the chromate passivation<br>
was considered as effectiveness of the chromate film in reducing the fretting corrosion.<br>
This galvanized surface analysis was conducted by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM)<br>
attached with Energy Dispersive Spectroscope (EDS) detector to measure the<br>
aluminium wt % present in the surface. It was observed ttiat the aluminium % was<br>
less on surface in invented chromate treated product compared to commercially<br>
available chromate treatment. The aluminium leaching value depends on the aluminium<br>
present on the galvanized surface therefore it was not quantified. However, the<br>
reduction in aluminium has been qualitatively evaluated.<br><br>
