				<td>ALLOYED TUNGSTEN PRODUCED BY CHEMICAL VAPOUR<br>
DEPOSITION<br>
This invention relates to a new and useful improvement in the composition of metal alloys having enhanced wear-, erosion- and chemical resistance and a combination of high hardness and toughness. In particular, the invention relates to enhanced tungsten alloyed carbon, preferably in the form of tungsten carbide nanoparticles, and optionally also with fluorine, produced from the gas phase by way of chemical vapour deposition (CVD).<br>
Alloyed tungsten is widely used as a refractory material and as a heat-resistant construction material, for example in the production of heavy alloys, filaments for incandescent lamps, and in electronics applications. Tungsten carbides are used in machine building, for the production of tools and heavy-loaded wear parts, in the form of a powder metallurgy composite consisting of tungsten monocarbide with cobalt or another metal binder. These materials have enhanced wear- and erosion-resistance and significantly prolong the life of tools and parts operating under harsh conditions.<br>
Alloying of metals is a complex physical-chemical phenomenon of significant practical interest For example, alloying of iron with various amounts of carbon under various conditions might change its mechanical and physical properties dramatically from mild iron, to low carbon steel, high carbon steel and pig iron. The properties of steel, first of all its hardness, significantly depend on the carbon content and the form in which carbon is present in steel (e.g. as free cementite FejC or alternatively as an interstitial solid solution of carbon in iron).<br>
Alloying should be distinguished from inclusions or simple mechanical mixing of several materials. For example free carbon inclusions into iron can have a negative<br>
effect on its mechanical properties, whereas as alloying can improve its mechanical properties.<br>
In several practical applications tungsten is alloyed by substitution impurities and chemical compounds to achieve specific properties. For example JP 2003129164 describes a heavy tungsten-based alloy with 0.1—3 wt% of nickel and copper which has a specific weight 18.5 - 19.2 g/cm3. RU 2206629 describes a powder-metallurgy alloy of tungsten with 0.6-0.8 wt% Co; 0.2-0.4 wt% Ta; 0.2-0.4 wt% Ni; 2.0-5.0 wt% Fe; 0.1-0.2 wt% La, which is recommended as a heavy alloy with specific weight 17.8-18.2 g/cm3 and which can be deformed up to 50-80%.<br>
To increase the re-crystallisation temperature and vibration resistance of an incandescent filament, powder metallurgy tungsten wire is alloyed with aluminium, potassium, silicon and rhenium 0.05-0.19 wt% [US2003132707], or lanthanum oxide 0.05-1.00 wt% [US 5,742,891], aluminium, potassium, silicon and rhenium 0.2-0.4 wt% [US 6,624,577], or to produce a duplex wire with a core of thorium oxide alloyed tungsten (W+ThOa) and an external shell made of rhenium [US 5,041,041],<br>
Modem electrode materials used for arc welding require a combination of arc stability and arc-resistance, that according to US 5,512,240 is achieved by alloying tungsten with lanthanum boride 0.02-1.0 wt%. US 5,028,756 recommends, for electrode wire for electro-erosion cutting, tungsten with Y, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Pm, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu or with then oxides.<br>
Tungsten alloys hold an important position among refractory construction materials. According to US 5,372,661, an alloy consisting of tungsten, molybdenum and rhenium with up to 50 ppm of carbon added as a reducing agent has excellent erosion resistance, ductility, toughness and high re-crystallisation temperature. Transitional metals such as vanadium, chromium, manganese,, iron, cobalt, nickel and rare earth metals are added to refractory materials, in particular to tungsten, to purify it from harmful additions of oxygen, nitrogen, carbon and hydrogen (US 5,722,036).<br>
This purification significantly improves the physical-chemical properties (corrosion-resistance, resistance to high temperatures, electrical conductivity) and technological properties (ductility, suitability for rolling or cutting).<br>
In addition to the widely known hard metals based on tungsten monocarbide, US 4,053,306 describes a composite material comprising tungsten carbide - steel, which has metallurgically-produced tungsten carbide particles 1-20 microns in size evenly distributed in the volume of carbon steel or steel alloyed with nickel and cobalt.<br>
hi accordance with the aforementioned references, metallurgical tungsten is often alloyed for the purpose of purifying it from damaging admixtures and impurities. The admixtures and additives have a very low solubility in the tungsten matrix, and according to [Savitsky E.M., Burkhanov G.S. Metallurgy of Refractory and Rare Metals, (in Russian), Moscow, Nauka, 1971, p. 356] such solutions are possible with concentrations of up to 0.0001 wt%. Admixtures of higher concentration can strongly affect the mechanical properties of tungsten, for example excessive carbon could be most damaging by segregation on the grain boundaries, causing tungsten embrittlement<br>
All the aforementioned examples of alloying are related to metallurgical alloying, which involves either powder metallurgy or melting processes performed at high temperatures above 1200°C. Lakholcin Y.V., Krasovsky A.I.; Tungsten-Rhenium Coatings, (in Russian), Moscow, Nauka, 1989, p. 159 describes alloys of tungsten with rhenium produced by low-temperature CVD from the gas phase in a broad range of concentrations. As shown in this publication, the gas-phase alloying of tungsten with rhenium (up to 9 wt%) provides significant improvement of the mechanical properties of tungsten, simultaneously enhancing its strength and ductility.<br>
Usually, tungsten produced from a mixture of tungsten hexafluoride and hydrogen contains up to 0.0015 wt% of hydrogen, 0.0042 wt% of oxygen, 0.0085 wt% of<br>
nitrogen, 0.0086 wt% of carbon and 0.012 wt% of metal impurities, and has a micro-hardness at the level of 490-520 kg/mm2 (Khusainov M.A. Thermal strength of refractory materials produced by Chemical Vapour Deposition, Leningrad, Leningrad University Publishing, 1979, p. 160),, By way of rectification of the tungsten hexafluoride, the content of the impurities hi the tungsten can be reduced down to: 0.0012 wt% of oxygen, 0.0016 wt% of nitrogen, 0.0010 wt% of carbon and 0.0053 wt% of metal impurities, while the micro-hardness can be reduced to 450-490 kg/ mm2. The authors of the above references tried to reduce the content of impurities to obtain plastic tungsten both by powder metallurgy and by chemical vapour deposition methods.<br>
US 4,427,445 describes a hard, fine-grained, internally stressed material of tungsten and carbon or tungsten, carbon and oxygen, which is produced by thermochemical deposition. The material consists primarily of a two phase mixture of pure tungsten and an A15 structure, the tungsten phase comprising between about 20% and 90% of the material, which has a hardness of greater than 1200 VHN, and an average gram size of less than 0.1 um. A coating of this material is formed on graphite bars by heating these in a furnace and passing a gaseous mixture of tungsten hexafluoride, hydrogen and carbon- and oxygen-containing organic reagents (alcohols, ethers, ketones) over the bars. The 10-80% content of the A15 phase is easily detected by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, the XRD spectrum containing tines both for metallic tungsten and the A15 structure. A typical XRD spectrum of such a structure is shown on Figure 2 of the present application, hi which the A15 structure is WsC. The coating material has high compressive stresses (above lOOOMPa) and microhardness up to 2500 VHN.<br>
To reduce hardness and relax internal stresses, US 4,427,445 recommends additional heat treatment at temperatures between 600 and 700°C so as at least partially to decompose or transform the A15 phase, thereby reducing hardness of the material to at least half of its pre-heat treated hardness. However, due to the differences in thermal expansion coefficients of the coating and the substrate material, the heat<br>
treatment applies additional stresses. At temperatures above 600°C many materials lose their mechanical properties and the shapes and dimensions of work pieces can be distorted.<br>
Various comparative tests described in EP 1 158 070 Al (discussed below) show that a coating consisting of a mixture of metal tungsten and W3C shows worse wear-resistance as compared to olher tungsten carbides WC and W2C, as well as to a mixture of metal tungsten and W2C. The use of oxygen-containing organic reagents results in the formation of tungsten oxyfluorides which are difficult to reduce with hydrogen. The presence of tungsten oxyfluorides results in a deterioration of the mechanical properties of the coatings.<br>
EP 1158 070 Al describes new compositions based on tungsten carbide alloyed with fluorine m a process of crystallisation from the gas phase. It is shown mat the gas-phase chemical reactions between tungsten hexafluoride, propane and hydrogen at a substrate temperature of 400 - 900°C and pressure 2-150 kPa crystallise a layer of tungsten carbide with a thickness of 0.5 - 300 microns. The carbon-containing gas is activated by heating to 500 - 850°C before its introduction into the reactor. The ratio between the carbon-containing gas and hydrogen is varied from 0.2 to 1.7 and the ratio between tungsten hexafluoride and hydrogen is varied from 0.02 up to 0.12. By variation of these process parameters, it is possible to obtain the following tungsten carbide compositions: WC+C, WC, WC+W2C, W2C, W2C+W3C, W2C+W]2C, W2C+W3C+Wi2C, W3C, W3C+W]2C, W12C, WC+W, W2C-(-W, W3C+W, Wi2C+W, W3C+W,2C+W.<br>
This method allows production of all single-phase tungsten carbides, their mixtures, as well as mixtures with carbon and with metal tungsten. It should be emphasised that this disclosure relates to compositions based on tungsten carbide as the main phase, with tungsten being an admixture impurity. This has been proved by X-ray diffraction analysis.<br>
These tungsten carbide compositions have high hardness, up to 3500 kg/mm2. The content of carbon in these coating materials can be up to 15 wt% and the content of fluorine up to 0,5 wt%. However, these materials are quite brittle like most other carbides, and cannot resist intensive load or an impact.<br>
To reduce the brittleness of the carbide deposits, EP 1 158 070 proposes use of multilayer deposits, consisting of alternating layers of tungsten and any of the tungsten carbides described above or their mixtures. The ratio of the thicknesses of the individual alternating layers can range from 1:1 up to 1:5.<br>
Modern machine building requires materials which can resist harsh abrasive, erosive and corrosive environments and which have enhanced durability. Cemented or sintered carbide, also called hardmetal, is one of the most widely used types of wear-resistant materials.<br>
Cemented carbide is a composite material consisting of tungsten monocarbide with a cobalt or sometimes nickel or another metal, binder with a relatively low melting temperature. The binder content and composition can vary, as can the grain size of the tungsten carbide. This material can be produced by powder metallurgy sintering or alternatively by spraying, for example using plasma or high velocity oxy-fuel. The term "cemented carbide" will be used further in this text to describe this type of material. The particles of tungsten carbide give hardness, while cobalt gives toughness; as a result, this material shows excellent wear- and erosion-resistance. At the same time, however, cemented carbide has several drawbacks, in particular it is brittle, especially in thin-walled items or on sharp comers, and is expensive in manufacturing and machining, especially for items of complex shape. The cobalt binder can be attacked by corrosion.<br>
According to various aspects of the present invention, there are provided materials, coatings and processes as set forth in the appended claims.<br>
More specifically, according to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a wear-, erosion- and chemically-resistant material containing tungsten alloyed with carbon, the carbon being present in an amount of 0.01 wt% up to 0.97 wt% of the total weight.<br>
Preferably, the material comprises a matrix of metallic tungsten with dispersed tungsten carbide nanopariicles having a particle size not greater than 50 nanometres, preferably not greater than 10 nanometres.<br>
In some embodiments, it is important mat all tungsten carbide nano-paiticles have a particle size or particle diameter not greater than 5Qnm; in other embodiments, it is sufficient that a mean particle size or diameter of the tungsten carbide nanoparticles is not greater than 50mn.<br>
Preferably, the tungsten carbide nanoparticles may be either tungsten monocaibide WC, tungsten semicarbide WaC, or a mixture of both.<br>
The material is advantageously additionally alloyed with fluorine, the fluorine being present in an amount of 0.01 wt% up to 0.4 wt% of the total weight.<br>
The material may have a micro-hardness from 700 Hv up to 2000 Hv, in some embodiments up to 2200 Hv<br>
Embodiments of the present invention relate to a new wear-resistant material based on a tough and ductile metal matrix consisting of tungsten strengthened by alloying carbon, especially in the form of tungsten carbide precipitates, and optionally also with compounds of tungsten with carbon and fluoiine.<br>
The material of embodiments of the present invention has been analysed using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), which is widely used to analyse materials for both scientific and industrial applications. Different crystalline materials such as WC, tungsten and<br>
graphite have different XRD spectra defined by the inter-atomic distances in their ciystalline lattices, and the XRD spectra can. be used as a signature of the crystalline material. This technique enables the detection of crystalline materials present in amounts above 5% and having a particle size above 5 to 10 nm. Crystalline materials having a crystal size between 10 and 50 nm can be seen as broad humps at low diffraction angles, but if their content is below 5%, then their identification or even detection is not always possible and depends on the nature of the materials and their X-ray diffraction spectra.<br>
Figure 1 shows the XRD spectrum of a material of an embodiment of the present invention. It can he seen, that the spectrum contains only lines characteristic of metal tungsten.<br>
Figure 2 shows the XRD spectrum of sample 2 described in Example 4 below, which is similar to the material disclosed and claimed in US 4,427,445. This spectrum shows lines typical for metal tungsten, as well as lines characteristic for tungsten carbide W3C.<br>
The comparison of these spectra shows the difference in the phase composition of the claimed new material and the previously known materials.<br>
Further analytical methods such as hardness testing show that the material of embodiments of the present invention has a Vickers micro-hardness of 700 Hv to 2200 Hv, this being significantly higher than the hardness of metal tungsten at 430 Hv. This is thought to be due to the presence of nano-size precipitate particles of hard tungsten carbides with a particle size below 50nm, preferably in amounts below 5 atomic percent. In this case, the presence of the hardening tungsten carbide precipitates will not be detected by XRD analysis.<br>
These analytical results demonstrate that embodiments of the present invention comprise tungsten alloyed with tungsten carbide nanoparficles and optionally with<br><br>
fluorine in specific quantities and in a specific form. The alloying results hi the formation of nano-crystals of tungsten carbides, optionally stabilized by fluorine, and dispersed in the metal tungsten matrix. In accordance with the electron microscopy results shown in Figures 3 to 5, the size of the tungsten carbide nanocrystalline precipitates is below 50nm, and in most cases below lOnm.<br>
The fact that the tungsten carbide precipitates are typically either tungsten monocarbide WC and/or tungsten semicafbide W2C is favourable for the mechanical properties of the material and its thermal stability. The brittle and thermally unstable tungsten subcarbide WaC phase present in the material described in US 4,427,445 is not found in the material of preferred embodiments of the present invention.<br>
The material of preferred embodiments of the present invention is a new previously unknown material comprising a metal tungsten matrix in which is dispersed or alloyed tungsten carbide nanoparticles, optionally also alloyed with fluorine.<br>
The hardness and toughness of the alloyed tungsten can be controlled by varying the carbon content, for example the content of the tungsten carbide nanoparticles, which allows optimisation of the material properties to meet the requirements of a specific application.<br>
In accordance with embodiments of present invention, metallic tungsten is alloyed with carbon or interspersed with tungsten carbide nanoparticles in amounts ranging from 0.01 wt% up to 0.97 wt%. With the increase of the alloying carbon content, the hardness of the material increases from 430 kg/mm2 up to 2400 kg/mm2, the results of some of the Examples being given below in Table 1. The hardness of the material does not vary linearly with the carbon content - when the carbon content increases from 0.001 wt% up to 0.01 wt%, the micro-hardness increases from 430 up to 560 kg/mm2. When the carbon content reaches 1.3 wt%, the hardness increases sharply up to 2200 kg/mm2 and the tungsten carbide phase appears hi XRD spectra.<br>
Tungsten alloyed with carbon in an amount of 1.3 wt% up to 1.85 wt% has enhanced baidness, but has a brittleness typical for harder tungsten carbides.<br>
Table 1. Hardness of tungsten alloyed with carbon depending on carbon content<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
The additional alloying of the carbon-tungsten compositions with fluorine enables the carbide constituent of the composition to be stabilised, this being achieved due to the high energy of the carbon-fluorine bond. By extensive experimentation, the present applicant has found that the stabilization effect is best achieved in a range of fluorine concentrations fiora 0.01 wt% up to 0.4 wt%. The double alloying with both carbon and fluorine provides an excellent combination of high hardness and satisfactory toughness of the material.<br>
The material described above is produced by the method of Chemical Vapour Deposition on a heated substrate from a mixture of gases including tungsten hexafluoride, hydrogen, a carbon-containing gas and optionally an inert gas. The carbon-containing gas is thermally pre-activated by heating in a pre-heating chamber, advantageously to a temperature of 500 - 850°C, before introduction into a reaction chamber of a CVD reactor.<br>
The process may include the following stages:<br>
a)	placing a cleaned substrate into a CVD reactor;<br>
b)	evacuating the reactor;<br>
c)	heating the substrate to a temperature of 350 - 700°C and heating a<br>
carbon-containing gas pre-treatment chamber to 500 - 850°C;<br>
d)	supplying   gaseous   tungsten   hexafluoride,   hydrogen   and   the<br>
preliminary thermally activated carbon-containing gas into the reactor;<br>
e)	holding the substrate in the gaseous medium for a tune interval<br>
necessary for formation of a layer of tungsten alloyed with carbon and fluorine on the<br>
substrate.<br>
The micro-hardness and toughness of the material can be controlled and adjusted to meet predetermined requirements by controlling the process temperature, the carbon-containing gas pie-treatment temperature, the pressure in the reaction chamber (for example in a range from 0.1 up to 150 kPa), the ratio of the carbon-containing gas to hydrogen (for example in a range from 0.0001 up to 0.1, preferably from 0.001 to 0.7, but in some embodiments from 0.001 to 1.7), and the ratio of tungsten hexafluoride to hydrogen (for example in a range from 0.02 up to 0.5).<br>
According to a further aspect of the present invention, the material can be produced as a coating on items and construction material substrates, while the items made from materials belonging to the group that includes iron, carbon steels, tool steels, stainless steels, cast iron, titanium alloys, titanium-containing hard alloys and other materials which are not resistant to hydrogen fluoride may be coated prior to deposition with a sub-layer or primer layer made from materials that are chemically resistant to hydrogen fluoride, in particular nickel, cobalt, copper, silver, gold, platinum, iridium, tantalum, molybdenum, their alloys, compounds and mixtures, which may be deposited by methods of electrochemical or chemical deposition from aqueous solutions, electrolysis of molten salts, physical and chemical vapour deposition. Materials or items with an external layer containing more man 25% of nickel are preferred substrates for the carbon-alloyed tungsten coating, for example Invar®, Monel®, Nichrome® and Inconel®.<br>
The adhesion of the material to construction materials can be unproved by depositing another sub-layer of tungsten alloyed with fluorine only in an amount of 0.01 - 0.4 wt%. Tliis sub-layer may have a thickness of 0.1 — 300 microns, while the external<br>
layer of the material may have a thickness of 0.5 - 300 microns, with the ratio between the thickness of the inner sublayer and the external layer ranging from 1:1 up to 1:600.<br>
The proposed CVD process allows multi-layer compositions to be produces, which include hard yet brittle layers interspersed with relatively low hardness yet tough layers. The multi-layer coating can be produced as alternating layers of tungsten and tungsten alloyed with carbon (e.g. with tungsten carbide nanoparticles) in amounts from 0.01 - 0.97t% and optionally with fluorine in amounts 0.01 - 0.4 wt%.<br>
Another variant of the multi-layer coating consists of alternating layers of tungsten alloyed with carbon (e.g. tungsten carbide nanoparticles) in amounts from 0.01 -0.97wt% and optionally with fluorine in amounts from 0.01 - 0.4 wt% and layers of tungsten carbide alloyed with fluorine hi amounts from 0.005 — 0.5 wt%, the tungsten carbide/fluorine layers being described in more detail in accordance EP 1 158 070. Figure 5 shows a micro-photograph of the cross-section of such a multi-layer coating. By variation of the thicknesses and number of the layers, it is possible to adjust the hardness and toughness of the multi-layer composite coating as well as its thickness.<br>
All the hereinbefore described types of coating are proposed for improving wear- and corrosion-resistance of wear parts, units and tools for metal processing by pressing or cutting, and also to improve the erosion-resistance of machinery units operating with pressurised gases and fluid and other pneumatic and hydraulic systems.<br>
For a better understanding of the present invention and to show how it may be carried into effect, reference shall now be made by way of example to the following Examples and to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
FIGURE 1 shows an x-ray diffraction spectrum for a sample of a coating of a first embodiment of the present invention;<br>
FIGURE 2 shows an x-ray diffraction spectrum for a sample of a prior art coating;<br>
FIGURES 3 to 5 show high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR.TEM) images of materials of embodiments of the present invention;<br>
FIGURES 6a and 6b show electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA)/X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra for materials of embodiments of the present invention; and<br>
FIGURES 7a to 7c show electron diffraction Images of materials of embodiments of the present invention.<br>
To analyse the material of embodiments of the present invention further, HRTEM analysis was performed. An alloyed tungsten sample N1089 was deposited on a copper substrate, the sample preparation being performed using a focussed ion beam technique with an FEI FIB 200 workstation.<br>
An HRTEM micrograph taken with a JEOL 3000F instalment is shown in Figure 3. A dark spot in the upper-central part of the image is a precipitate with dimensions between 2 and 4nm. The inter-atomic distances (1.49 and 1.76A) directly measured from the precipitate region are different from those of metal tungsten and are matched best to the lattice constants of W2C ((110) plane - 1.49 A and (102) plane -1.74 A).<br>
Figure 4 is an HRTEM micrograph showing another tungsten carbide precipitate 1 with size approximately 2 run.<br>
Figure 5 is an FfRTEM image of a grain boundary 2 in an alloyed tungsten sample Nl 86. Only minimal contrast was observed on this grain boundary., this being typical for observations of other samples and indicating that the tungsten carbide precipitates are not concentrated on the grain boundaries but more regularly formed within a<br>
grain. This is favourable for the mechanical propeities of the material as the formation of a harder phase on the grain boundaries can increase brittleness.<br>
Similar observations were made by a Philips 400 T transmission electron microscope equipped with a Link 860 X-ray micro-probe. Precipitates of tungsten carbide with sizes varying from 8nm up to 50nm were found in various samples of the material,<br>
Figures 6a and 6b show the ESCA spectra of an alloyed tungsten sample 365. The sample was scribed in a vacuum to a depth of 2-3um to expose a fresh material volume free from contamination. An ESCA MkH spectrometer equipped with a CLAM 100 detector was used for analysis, the data collection and processing being performed using a VGX DATA 900 software package. The energy scale was calibrated on the basis of gold peak Au 4f7 made by flash-evaporation, the binding energy of this peak being measured at 83.8eV. The positions of the peaks were measured with an accuracy of +/-0.1eV. The main detected lines from the alloyed tungsten sample are due to tungsten and carbon. The tungsten peaks W 4f7 and W 4f5 were found to be in good accordance with the published data for metal tungsten, which additionally confirmed the instrument calibration. The carbon line C Is was detected at a binding energy of 283.5eV, which is significantly lower than the characteristic binding energy of the level C Is of carbon in typical surface contaminations like organics or free carbon (284.6 and 285eV respectively). This shift of the carbon peak towards a lower binding energy shows that the carbon present in the sample is in a chemically bonded form as tungsten carbide.<br>
Electron diffraction images produced by analysis of the sample under a transmission electron microscope are shown in Figures 7a to 7c. This method of analysis does enable the presence of tungsten carbides to be demonstrated:<br>
Figure 7a is the diffraction pattern corresponding to the crystalline lattice of (angle between the reflexes 100 (d = 4.49 A), 110 (d = 2.59 A) and 010 (d = 4.49 A) is 60°).<br>
Figure 7b is the diffraction pattern corresponding to WC(i-X) (angle between the reflexes 013 (d = 4.01 A), 026 and 103 is 44°);<br>
Figure 7c corresponds to the proliibited reflexes of tungsten 100 (d = 3.16 A) and d = 4.63A).<br>
Electron diffraction does identify the presence of tungsten carbides, and this can be explained by their fine crystalline structure which cannot be analysed using x-ray diffraction. The nano-crystalline tungsten carbide precipitates increase the material hardness.<br>
Examples<br>
Although the use of tungsten alloyed with tungsten carbide nanoparticles (obtained according to the proposed invention) as a bulk construction material is not excluded, it is currently preferred to deposit the novel tungsten material on conventional construction materials and items made thereof in the form of wear-resistant coatings. This is why the Examples presented below illustrate the invention specifically in the cases of deposition of alloyed tungsten on the substrates as coatings. However, these examples do not limit or restrict the invention because, for example, it is possible to obtain other combinations of tungsten alloyed with tungsten carbide(s) and/or carbon having desirable properties for a particular application by means of the processes of the present invention with an appropriate variation of the operating parameters. It is therefore intended to cover in the appended claims all such changes and modifications that are within the scope of flu's invention.<br>

The propane is thermally pre-activated to a temperature of 695°C and the pressure of the reaction mixture is kept at 0.1 kPa. As a result, a material is produced with a base made of tool steel D2 having a sub-layer of nickel and a composite coating consisting of an innermost layer of tungsten 3 microns thick, and an external layer of 36 microns thick tungsten alloyed with tungsten carbide nanoparticles in an amount 0.13 wt%.

Example 4<br>
A sample of copper is loaded into the CVD reactor and kept at a temperature of 520°C in WF6 and hydrogen in a ratio of 8:100 for 10 minutes and then in WF6, hydrogen and propane (CsHg) with a ratio between WFg and Kb of 8:100 and CaHg to Kb of 0.135 for 110 minutes. The propane is thermally pre-activated to a temperature of 713°C and the pressure of the reaction mixture is kept at 0.1 kPa. As a result, a material is produced with a base made of copper and a composite coating consisting of an innermost layer of tungsten 2 microns thick, and an external layer of 46 microns thick tungsten alloyed with tungsten carbide nanoparticles in an amount 0.64 wt%. The micro-hardness of the external layer is 1550 HV.<br>
This coating (Sample 1) has been analysed using x-ray diffraction analysis, the resulting spectrum being shown in Figure 1. The spectrum of this sample has only lines characteristic for metallic tungsten, but has no lines typical for tungsten carbide.<br>
For comparative illustration, Figure 2 shows an x-ray diffraction spectrum of another sample (Sample 2) which has both lines of tungsten and of tungsten carbide. This sample (Sample 2) was prepared in the following way: a plate of carbon steel 4140 pre-coated with 5 microns thick nickel by electrochemical process is loaded into the CVD reactor and kept at a temperature of 500°C hi WFe and hydrogen at a ratio of 75:1000 for 15 minutes and then in WF<j hydrogen and propane with a ratio between wf6 h2 of c3hg to for minutes. the is thermally pre-activated temperature pressure reaction mixture kept at kpa. as result material produced base made></j>
carbon steel 4140 having a sub-layer of nickel and a composite coating consisting of an innermost layer of tungsten 3 microns thick, and an external layer of 36 microns thick tungsten mixed with tungsten semicaibide, having a carbon content of 1.75 \vt%. The micro-hardness of the external layer is 2350 HV.<br>
Sample 1 has also been analysed using the electron beam diffraction method under a transmission electron microscope, the resulting images being shown in Figure 7. This method of analysis does enable the presence of tungsten carbides to be demonstrated.<br>
If the results of the various analyses of this sample are considered together, the x-ray diffraction shows only the presence of metal tungsten, although the micro-hardness of this sample at the level of 1550 Hv is much higher than the hardness of metal tungsten, which is typically at the level of 430 Hv. Electron diffraction does identify the presence of tungsten carbides, and this can be explained by their fine crystalline structure which cannot be analysed using x-ray diffraction. The presence of these nano-crystalline tungsten carbides explains the high hardness of this material.<br>
These measurements and analysis results are typical for this form of tungsten alloyed with carbon and fluorine which is the subject of this invention.<br>
