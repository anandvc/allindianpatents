				<td>DROPLET DEPOSITION APPARATUS<br>
The present invention relates to printers and in particular droplet<br>
deposition ink jet printers<br>
Ink Jet printers are no longer viewed simply as office printers, their<br>
versatility means that they are now used in digital presses and other industrial<br>
markets. It is not uncommon for print heads to contain in excess of 500 nozzles<br>
and it is anticipated that "page wide" print heads containing over 2000 nozzles<br>
will be commercially available in the near future.<br>
These print heads are typically "end shooters" i.e. the channel or ejection<br>
chamber has an ink inlet and a nozzle through which the ink is ejected. Ink flows<br>
into the chamber via the ink inlet and the only way for the ink to leave" the<br>
chamber is via the nozzle.<br>
It has been found that certain benefits are achieved where an ink outlet is<br>
added to the ejection channel in addition to the ink inlet and the ejection nozzle.<br>
Ink is caused to flow through the channel - even while printing - which helps to<br>
reduce the probability of particles or bubbles blocking the nozzle.<br>
Because of the size of these industrial printers, a large amount of ink is<br>
ejected from the heads when printing full black i.e. all the ejection chambers are<br>
printing at their maximum rate. It is proposed in print heads of the prior art that a<br>
flow rate through the print head of around ten times the maximum printing rate is<br>
used in order to help flush dirt out of the print head and maintain the head at a<br>
constant temperature.<br>
It is preferred that the nozzles are kept at just below atmospheric pressure<br>
since a pressure above atmospheric may result in weeping of ejection fluid and<br>
pressures significantly below atmospheric may cause the sucking of air into the<br>
ejection chamber. Neither of these effects provide stable operation and are<br>
therefore undesirable.<br>
Because of the ink circulation, there is provided an inlet manifold and an<br>
outlet manifold. There is a significant pressure drop in the print head between the<br>
inlet and outlet manifolds and to ensure the correct pressure at the nozzle the<br>
pressures in both the inlet and outlet manifolds may be specified. The inlet<br>
manifold pressure being positive and the outlet manifold pressure being negative<br>
and of a slightly greater magnitude than the inlet pressure.<br>
These pressures can be achieved using a gravity feed system utilising an<br>
upper and lower reservoirs, ink supplied to the print head from the upper<br>
reservoir and a pump being provided to return the un-ejected ink that collects in<br>
the lower reservoir back to the upper reservoir. In order to provide the necessary<br>
pressures.<br>
Whilst this arrangement is acceptable for static applications and where a<br>
large machine is not an issue, there is a need for an ink supply system that is<br>
more compact. It is an object of the present invention to address this and other<br>
problems.<br>
Accordingly, the present inventions consists in one aspect in droplet<br>
deposition apparatus comprising: at least one print head each haying atjeast one<br>
nozzle for ejecting fluid from that print head; fluid supply means for suppling fluid<br>
under pressure,to said at least one print head and pressure control means,<br>
located in said fluid supply means in parallel with the or each print head, for<br>
adjusting fluid pressure within said fluid supply means in order to control the fluid<br>
pressure at the or each nozzle.<br>
Preferably, pressurising means are located in said fluid supply means in<br>
parallel with the or each print head and said pressure control means.<br>
Advantageously, a junction is provided in said fluid supply means<br>
downstream of said pressurising means wherein, said junction divides, said fluid<br>
supply means into at least two arms, and where downstream of said junction said<br>
pressure control means are located in one arm and the or each print heads are<br>
located in a different arm.<br>
Suitably, a further junction is provided in said fluid supply means<br>
downstream of said pressure control means and wherein, said further junction<br>
combines fluid in the arm from said pressure control means and fluid in the arm<br>
from the or each print head into a combined conduit.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment a junction is provided downstream of<br>
the pump, and fluid is directed along one arm to the print head and along the<br>
other arm to a pressure reference point, said arms combining at a further point to<br>
form a single conduit that feeds the pump. Reference point A. is connected to<br>
means capable of adjusting the pressure at reference point A and consequently<br>
the pressure at the nozzle. In the preferred embodiment this is a small reservoir<br>
open to the atmosphere and which can be raised or lowered in order to affect the<br>
pressure at the nozzle. In alternative embodiments the means for adjusting the<br>
pressure is a pressurised container.<br>
Careful selection of the resistances in the pressure reference arm with<br>
reference to the resistance in the printhead allows for control of the pressure at<br>
the nozzle by manipulating the pressure at a remote point arranged in parallel to<br>
the printhead.<br>
Preferably, the flow resistance upstream of reference point A and<br>
upstream of the at least one nozzle are substantially identical and the flow<br>
resistance downstream of reference point C and downstream of the at least one<br>
nozzle are also substantially identical. The flow resistance of the upstream and<br>
downstream conduits either side of reference point A being substantially the<br>
same.<br>
The flow resistance in the conduit either side of reference point A can be<br>
specified through the use of restrictors. The restrictors can be simple hardware,<br>
such as pipes having a particular flow resistance, or more complex hardware<br>
such as valves and the like. If pipes are used it is preferable that substantial<br>
lengths of a moderate inner diameter are used rather than short lengths of a<br>
narrow inner diameter; erosion and accretion of dirt will then be unlikely to spoil.<br>
the symmetry of the system.<br>
Ink preferably flows at a higher rate round the pressure control arm than<br>
round the print head arm of the circuit which means that a dirt particle within the<br>
circuit less of a chance to flow through the print head simply because more ink<br>
flows through the pressure control arm.<br>
The symmetry of the system is not perfect however, as the pump and the<br>
filter cannot both be placed on the "plane of symmetry". However, pump<br>
degradation and filter loading, within reason, do not significantly affect matters.<br>
Even substantial pressure drop through the filter, or pump wear merely lowers<br>
the flowrate through the main restrictors and hence the pressure drop across<br>
them. This in turn reduces the flow rate through the print head, which is not<br>
critical.<br>
Another element of asymmetry is the fact that ink is ejected from the print<br>
head, so while a particular flow enters the head, a smaller amount remains in the<br>
conduit down stream of the print head. Typically a flow of 10 times maximum<br>
printing rate enters the head and correspondingly a flow of between 9 and 10<br>
times maximum printing rate leaves the head. An amount of ejection fluid<br>
between 0 and 1 times the maximum printing rate being ejected by the print<br>
head.<br>
Ink to make up amount of ink that is ejected by the print head is preferably<br>
added to the supply circuit at the point at which the two supply arms combine<br>
downstream of the nozzles and the pressure reference point A.<br>
In a further embodiment of the present invention, the print head is<br>
mounted onto a scanning carriage. The bulk supply reservoir and the pressure<br>
adjustment reservoir are mounted onto a static part of the printer, all the other<br>
equipment mounted onto the carriage. Accelerations at the ends of the carriage<br>
motion are controlled by buffering the resulting pressure fluctuations at A.<br>
Alternatively, the pressure adjustment reservoir can be mounted on the scanning<br>
carriage at a point below that of the nozzles in the print head. Beneficially this<br>
reduces the effects of the acceleration on the pressure within the supply circuit..<br>
In another aspect, the present invention consists in a method of providing<br>
a flow of ink through an ink chamber having an ink inlet port at which a positive<br>
ink pressure is established, an ink ejection orifice and an ink outlet port at which<br>
a negative ink pressure is established, characterised by the flow of ink external to<br>
the chamber through a series connection of a first flow restrictor, a reference<br>
pressure device and a second flow restrictor to define respective positive and<br>
negative ink pressures at the ends of the first and second flow restrictors remote<br>
from the reference pressure device and the application of said positive and<br>
negative ink pressures to the inlet and outlet ports respectively of the ink<br>
chamber.<br>
Advantageously, the reference pressure device operates through<br>
exposure of an ink surface to a defined air pressure which is preferably<br>
controllable and may be atmospheric pressure.<br>
Suitably, the first and second flow restrictors are balanced with the<br>
restriction to ink flow in the chamber between the ink inlet port and the ink<br>
ejection orifice and between the ink ejection orifice and the ink outlet port so that<br>
the ink pressure at the ink ejection orifice is defined by the reference pressure<br>
device.<br>
In yet another aspect, the present invention consists in a method of<br>
supplying ink to a print head where the pressure at the nozzle is controlled by a<br>
remote point, said remote point being positioned in parallel with said print head.<br>
In still a further aspect, the present invention consists in a method of<br>
supplying link to an ink chamber having a nozzle, wherein parallel flows are<br>
established in the ink chamber and in a pressure control path; the parallel flows<br>
being balanced such that the pressure at the nozzle is defined by the pressure<br>
applied at a reference point in the pressure control path.<br>
Advantageously, the pressure control path comprises a series connection<br>
of a first flow restrictor, a reference pressure device defining said reference point<br>
and a second flow restrictor.<br>
Preferably, the reference pressure device operates through exposure of<br>
an ink surface to a defined and preferably controllable air pressure, which may be<br>
atmospheric pressure.<br>
Suitably, the flow of ink through said pressure control path is greater than<br>
the flow of ink through the ink chamber.<br>
The present invention will now be described, by way of example only, with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings, in which :<br>

Figure 7 depicts a further circuit for a print head.<br>
Figure 1 depicts a gravity feed ink supply system according to the prior art.<br>
A print head 1 is capable of firing a liquid 2 from nozzles located on the underside<br>
of the head. The ink chambers that eject the nozzles are arranged in two parallel<br>
arrays and supplied with ink from a central manifold 3 and un-ejected ink is<br>
removed from the print head by two outlet manifolds 4.<br>
Ink is continually supplied to the print head from an upper reservoir 5, the<br>
level of liquid within the reservoir being controlled by a level sensor 6. The rate of<br>
ink flow is of the order ten times the maximum drop ejection rate. Because of the<br>
small size of the ejection chambers and the high pressure drop across them, a<br>
high pressure is required going into the print head in order to realise a slightly<br>
negative pressure at the nozzles. This pressure is achieved through the provision<br>
of a pressure head Hu which is the difference between the height of liquid in the<br>
reservoir and the nozzles. Typically the pressure at the inlet manifold must be of<br>
the order +2800 Pa.<br>
The nozzles in the chambers are located mid way between the inlet<br>
manifold 3 and the outlet manifold 4. The pressure drop in the printer either side<br>
of the nozzle is therefore substantially identical. Ink that is flowing through the<br>
chamber passes to a lower reservoir, in which the level of liquid is controlled by a<br>
level sensor 8. The height difference HL between the nozzles and the surface of<br>
the fluid in the lower reservoir defines the pressure at the nozzles, which must be<br>
at a substantial negative pressure of approximately -3200 Pa. This achieves a<br>
pressure at the nozzle that is just below atmospheric.<br>
Ink is returned to the upper reservoir via a filter 10 using a pump 9. In this<br>
arrangement, the print head and pressure reference points are arranged in<br>
series.<br>
Typically Hu is of the order 280mm and HL of the order 320mm. WO<br>
00/38928 (incorporated herein) describes this ink supply in greater detail and<br>
consequently it will not be described in any more detail here.<br>
Figure 2 is a perspective view of a continuous flow drop on demand inkjet print<br>
head. A block of piezoelectric material 24 has channels 32 formed by a sawing<br>
process. The piezoelectric block is polarised in its thickness direction and<br>
electrodes (not shown) are provided on either side of each wall bounding the<br>
channels. Upon activation of a field between the electrodes on opposing sides of<br>
the walls, the walls deflect in shear and hence pressurise the ink contained within<br>
the channels. This causes a drop to be ejected from the nozzles 30 formed in a<br>
cover plate 34. The mechanics of such drop ejection is well known and described<br>
in the prior art, see for example EP-A-0 277 703 or EP-A-0 278 590 and<br>
incorporated herein.<br>
This structure and other structures, single and double row actuators are<br>
also well known in the prior art ; see Indian patent applications Nos.<br>
IN/PCT/2001/310 (WO 00/24584) and IN/PCT/2001/451 (WO 00/29217) amongst<br>
others (both of these applications incorporated herein).<br>
In this single row actuator, ink is supplied to the actuator through ports 20<br>
formed in a base 26 and removed from the actuator through ports 22 also located<br>
in the base, but at the opposite end of the channel. A support 28, with the cover<br>
34 and the base 26 defines a manifold.<br>
The present invention will now be described with reference to Figures 3 to<br>
6.<br>
Figure 3 is an expanded view of the print head of Figure 2. The nozzles 30<br>
are located midway along the channels 32. The dimensions of each of the<br>
channels are relatively small; typically the width is of the order 75 microns, the<br>
depth of 300 microns and the length approximately 1mm. Since the head is<br>
capable of printing drops up to 50pl at a frequency around 6.2 kHz, the greatest<br>
flow rate through the nozzles is about 3.1x10"10 m3/s and thus at 10 times this<br>
flow rate, the velocity along the channel is 0.14m/s.<br>
Because some of the ink is ejected from the nozzles, the pressure drop<br>
along the first half of the channel is greater than that along the second half of the<br>
channel. In theory, these can be shown schematically as two restrictors, 56 and<br>
58 in Figure 4.<br>
The ink supply according to the preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention is depicted in Figure 4. A single row, through flow print head is<br>
positioned in parallel with a pressure reference point A. Reference point A and<br>
the nozzles 30 are in a fixed spatial relationship with one another and with a<br>
pump 52 positioned so as to be able to supply ink to both reference point A and<br>
the nozzles simultaneously.<br>
Unejected ink that flows from the print head is combined with ink flowing<br>
from the reference point A and used to feed the pump. Ink to replace that which<br>
is ejected from the nozzles is supplied to the ink downstream of either or both the<br>
reference point A and the nozzles from a bulk supply reservoir 54.<br>
Schematically, the channels and manifolds within the print head are<br>
depicted as restrictors 56 and 58. Because the nozzles are positioned centrally<br>
within the channels, each of the restrictors 56, 58 provide substantially the same<br>
resistance.<br>
Located either side of the reference point A are restrictors 60,62. These<br>
are balanced with one another so that when ink is flowing round the circuit a<br>
positive pressure of approximately +2800 Pa is established at the opposite side<br>
of restrictor 60 and a negative pressure of approximately -3200 Pa is established<br>
at the opposite side of restrictor 62.<br>
The circuits are balanced so that the pressure entering the printhead (i.e.<br>
upstream of restrictor 58) is similarly +2800 Pa and the pressure leaving the<br>
printhead (i.e. downstream of restrictor 56) is similarly -3200 Pa. Because of the<br>
pressure drops provided by the restrictors, this establishes a pressure at the<br>
nozzles 30 that is substantially the same as that at the pressure reference point<br>
A.<br>
The restrictors can simply be a length of pipe, either a short piece with a<br>
narrow bore or a longer piece with a larger bore. In this example, the bore is of a<br>
moderate inner diameter so that erosion or build up of dirt will not have a<br>
significant effect on the symmetry of the system. Alternatively, the use of a valve<br>
will provide a greater operating freedom.<br>
The pressure at the reference point A is controlled by the height of the<br>
liquid contained within the small control reservoir 64 with is open to the<br>
atmosphere. By raising the reservoir higher, the pressure at reference point A is<br>
increased and subsequently all the pressures within the supply circuit are also<br>
increased by a corresponding amount. By this simple movement, the pressure at<br>
the nozzles can be raised.<br>
Similarly, by lowering the control reservoir, the pressure at reference point<br>
A is decreased and subsequently all the pressures within the supply circuit are<br>
also decreased by a corresponding amount. By this simple movement, the<br>
pressure at the nozzles can be lowered.<br>
By altering the pressure within the small reservoir, it is possible to effect<br>
purging or sucking at the nozzles for maintenance purposes.<br>
Turning to the hydraulic flows within the supply circuit, the pump must be<br>
sized so as to be able to achieve a flow of at least 10 times the maximum<br>
ejection rate through the print head and a flow, preferably in excess of this,<br>
through the pressure reference point A. A higher flow through the pressure<br>
reference point A of around 20 times the maximum ejection rate being preferred.<br>
The pump must therefore be capable of pumping 30 times the maximum<br>
ejection rate i.e. 9.3x10"9 m3/s. Make up ink is supplied to the system at a rate of<br>
between 0 and 3.1x10"10 m3/s. Whilst this is typically not supplied in a smooth<br>
flow, because it is joining a flow around 30 times larger any pressure fluctuations<br>
are negligible. Indeed, it has been found that the system is tolerant to any flow<br>
surges caused by the pump. It is believed that the reason for this is that as the<br>
pump is located as a component in the circuit a fluctuation in flow at the pump<br>
outlet is matched by a corresponding fluctuation in flow at the pump inlet.<br>
As the flow rate past the pressure reference point A is twice that of the<br>
flow through the head, any dirt particle in the system which avoids being caught<br>
in the filter 66 has twice the chance of flowing round the pressure referance<br>
circuit than through the print head. As the particle must pass through the filter 66<br>
a second time before having a second opportunity to flow through the print head.<br>
Thus, the chance of any one particle causing a blockage in the print head is<br>
further reduced.<br>
Whilst a higher flow rate of ink past the pressure reference point A is<br>
desirable it is no means essential. The important rate of flow is that through the<br>
print head and since this flow volume is preferably ten times the maximum<br>
printing volume there are, at least, nine times the maximum printing volume<br>
leaving the print head outlet. The probability of blockages is therefore reduced<br>
without a large flow passing through the pressure reference point.<br>
The schematic for a double row print head is depicted in Figure 5. The ink<br>
is supplied to both rows from a single central manifold in parallel and non-ejected<br>
ink from both rows of ejection chambers is combined at an exit manifold.<br>
The dashed line B-B in Figures 4 and 5 denotes the placement of<br>
equipment in a scanning application according to a further embodiment of the<br>
present invention. The circuit to the right of the line is placed onto the scanning<br>
carriage, whilst the reservoirs to the left of the line B-B are fixed.<br>
Pressure fluctuations caused by acceleration of the carriage may be<br>
buffered using the small reservoir 64. As the pipe between the small reservoir<br>
and the pressure reference point A may be smaller that the pipes carrying the<br>
flow of ink around the circuit the pressure fluctuations may be controlled by<br>
relatively small changes in altitude of the small reservoir or, where the small<br>
reservoir is closed to atmosphere and the pressure actively controlled, relatively<br>
small changes to the pressure in the air space above the liquid.<br>
In an alternative embodiment for the scanning arrangement the small<br>
reservoir may be mounted on the carriage. Where this is positioned below the<br>
print head no static pressure reference reservoir is required. If, however, it is<br>
inconvenient to place the small reservoir below the print head, it may be placed<br>
above and an air pipe running from the small reservoir to a static pressure control<br>
device may be used to establish the correct pressure at point A. Beneficially the<br>
air pipe does not give rise to a pressure difference .under acceleration.<br>
Figure 6 depicts an ink supply for a page wide array. A main pump 100<br>
circulates ink around a circuit that contains both a pressure control reservoir 102<br>
and a print head 104.<br>
Downstream of the pump is a flow control valve 106 and a filter 108 for<br>
removing dirt particles. The flow control valve maintains a steady flow of<br>
between 1 and 7 litres per minute. The bore of the pipe is around 10mm in<br>
diameter.<br>
Downstream of the filter, the circuit splits into two separate circuits in<br>
parallel. The first, marked, 110,112,114 is formed of a narrow bore tubing and<br>
includes a connection to a pressure control reservoir 102 open to atmospheric<br>
pressure. The narrow bore tubing is of the order 2mm in diameter and its length<br>
is such that the pressure in the pressure control reservoir is reflected at the<br>
nozzles of the print head. The pressure control reservoir 102 contains around<br>
100ml of ink.<br>
The second circuit 110, 116, 114 contains the print head 104. A by-pass<br>
valve 118, which is usually closed, and flow meter 120 are provided to facilitate<br>
operation. The flow through the head is typically between 1 and 7 litres per<br>
minute. The bore of the pipe is of the order 10mm.<br>
The two circuits combine at point 114 and the ink is circulated back to the<br>
pump 100. Ink from a make-up circuit is added at this point. The make up circuit<br>
has a pump 122 providing a flow below 1 litre per minute. The ink is filtered and<br>
supplies the pressure control reservoir 102. The make up ink for supply to the<br>
main pump 100 is removed at this point.<br>
The level of ink in the pressure control reservoir is controlled by a weir,<br>
excess ink flowing out of an outlet to a lower bulk ink reservoir 124 used to<br>
supply the make-up pump 122<br>
A more elegant ink supply can be achieved by supplying the main filter<br>
108, the pressure control reservoir 102 and the narrow bore tubing 130,132 as a<br>
single unit as shown in Figure 7.<br>
In this embodiment the pressure control reservoir 102 is placed in the<br>
single unit in a position above the filter and the unit itself has a size of the order<br>
10cm x 10cm x 20cm. For ease of reference the portion of the single unit<br>
comprising the pressure control reservoir is called the header portion and the<br>
portion comprising the filter the filter portion. The header portion is 3cm in height<br>
and a weir 134 determines the level of liquid in the header portion which is open<br>
to atmosphere. A small bleed hole 136 allows air to pass from the filter portion to<br>
the header portion.<br>
Top-up fluid to replace that printed by the print head 104 is supplied from a<br>
reservoir via a pump 122. The top-up fluid is supplied directly to the header<br>
portion and any excess flows over the weir 134 and returns to the reservoir via a<br>
non-porous tube 138 in the filter portion. The top-up fluid may be filtered prior to<br>
entering the header portion. The flow of ink through this portion is relatively low<br>
and typically well below 1 litre / minute.<br>
Turning to the main ink circulation circuit, a pump, preferably a magnet<br>
pump supplies the fluid to a cooler to cool the ink before it reaches the filter<br>
portion. The outlet of this tube is located in the hollow of a filter. The filter 108 is<br>
preferably a tubular filter with a 5cm OD and a height of 13cm and a pore size of<br>
5um. The ink flows through the filter and an outlet positioned towards the base of<br>
the filter housing is used to take ink to the print head. Beneficially this structure<br>
makes the system tolerant to air as any air must pass through the filter, rather<br>
than the bleed portion 136 and then downwards through the ink in the filter<br>
housing before passing to the print head.<br>
The narrow bores 130 and 132 allow a flow of ink from the print head inlet<br>
to the print head outlet via the header portion and act as two arms of a bridge.<br>
The level of the fluid in the header tank portion is the pressure reference and sets<br>
the pressure at the nozzles.<br>
Ink flows at a reasonable velocity through the narrow bore tubes and the<br>
pressure control reservoir 102 should be of a size such that no air is sucked<br>
down the return bore 132.<br>
The resistances of these tubes are matched to the inlet and outlet tubes to<br>
the print head and the flow of fluid to the print head is of the order 1 litre / minute.<br>
The size of the tubes supplying ink to and from the print head must be of a size<br>
that allows for a sufficient velocity of ink to prevent air collecting; yet large<br>
enough to prevent an excessive pressure drop. |t practice it has been found that<br>
a 10mm bore with an inside diameter of 7mm will works well. Where the diameter<br>
is 12mm with an inside diameter of 10mm is used it has been found the flow of<br>
ink is low enough to allow some air to collect however this air can easily be<br>
dislodged back into the ink stream by gentle tapping.<br>
