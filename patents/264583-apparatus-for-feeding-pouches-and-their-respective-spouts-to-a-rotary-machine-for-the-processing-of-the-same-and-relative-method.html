APPARATUS FOR FEEDING POUCHES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE SPOUTS TO A ROTARY MACHINE FOR THE PROCESSING OF THE SAME AND RELATIVE METHOD.<br>
TFCHN1CAL FIELD AND BACKGROUND ART<br>
The present invcntior. relates to an apparatus for feeding pouches and their<br>
rcspcctivc spouts to a rotary machine for the processing of :he same and relative<br>
feeding method.<br>
As is well known, drinks, and in particular fruit juices and sports drinks, arc<br>
increasingly more frequently sold and preserved in flexible containers<br>
commonly known as "pouches".<br>
Generally, these flexible containers comprise a pouch, normally made of<br>
polyethylene (PE) and have a spout, to cnabic the product contained inside the<br>
container to be poured out<br>
Pouring of the product is particularly fecthtated by the possibility to exert<br>
pressure on the beverage by squeezing the pouch.<br>
The flexible containers, or pouches, arc made from. a pair of polycthylcuc sheets<br>
the edges of which are welded together leaving an opening.<br>
Into this opening a portion of the spout is inserted and secured by means of<br>
welding In particular, this welding concerns the edges of the opening and is<br>
performed by applying heat to partially melt said edges to that they adhere to<br>
the portion of the spout inserted in the pouch.<br>
Generally, the spout is inserted inside the opening before the container is filled.<br>
It is well known that systems already exist for the processing of pouches<br>
comprising rotary machines with starwheels for picking up and transferring the<br>
1<br><br>
wo 2006/030464 PCT/IT2004/000506<br>
pouches, That work together with one or more starwhecls for filling and scaling<br>
the pouches.<br>
An important feature of systems with rotary machines is that they can operate in<br>
continuous mode and thus guarantee high productivity.<br>
To tike full advantage of thiS feature, it is essential that a continuous flow of<br>
pouches be fed to the processing starwheel.<br>
In particular, since the pouches arc assembled directly on the welding starwheels<br>
by opening the said pouches, inserting the spout inside the opening and then<br>
welding :he edges of the pouch, both the pouches and the spouts must be fed to<br>
the processing starwheel.<br>
The problem of ensuring continuous feed of both pouches and spouts to the<br>
rotary machine has yet to be resolved<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION.<br>
It is an object of the present invention 10 resolve the above-mentioned problem<br>
by providing an apparatus that can feed the pouches and their respective spouts<br>
to a rotary machine for the processing of the same, having the capacity to ensure<br>
continuous feeding of both spouts and pouches.<br>
Further, it is an object of the present invention to create an apparatus to<br>
simultaneously feed both pouches and spouts to a rotary machine for the<br>
processing of the same.<br>
Further still, it is an object of the present invention to present an apparatus for<br>
feeding pcuches and their respective spouts which is able to guarantee high<br>
productivity.<br>
Further still, it is an object of the present invention to present an apparatus for<br>
feeding pouches and their respective spouts which is easy to construct and<br><br>
WO 2006/030464	PCT/1T20O4/00506<br>
reliable.<br>
Further still, it is an object of the present invention to present a method for<br>
feeding pouches and spouts to a rotary machine for the processing of the same<br>
that is easy to implement.<br>
The above objects are fully attained through the apparatus for feeding pouches<br>
and their respective spouts to a rotary machine for the processing of the same<br>
and by the relative method, object of the present invention, characterized by the<br>
contents of the chirrs reported below.<br>
BUST MODF. FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION.<br>
This and other objects shall become more readily apparent in the following<br>
description of a preferred embodiment illustrated, purely by way of non Limiting<br>
example, in the sccotnpanying drawing tables In which-<br>
-	figure 1 is a partially sectioned front view of an appararus for feeding pouches<br>
and their respective spouts to a rotary machine for the processing of the same;<br>
-	figure 2 is a diagram, viewed from above, showing the principle of operation<br>
of the apparatus shown, in figure :<br>
With reference to the figures, an apparatus for feeding pouches and their<br>
respective spouts to a rotary machine for the processing of the same is globally<br>
indicated by the number 1. In particular, the rotary machine can be, for example.<br>
a pouch-forming starwheel equipped with welding grippers to weld the spouts to<br>
[he pouches.<br>
The Apparatus '. comprises a first magazine 2 designed to contair. a stock of<br>
pouches 102 and a second magazine 3 designed to hold a set number of spouts<br>
103.<br>
In a totally new and original manner, the apparatus I composes a handling unit<br>
3<br><br>
UO2006/030464	PCT/2004/OOO5O6<br>
4 designed so as to be able to pick up a pouch 102 and a spout 103 from their<br>
respective magazines and feed then simultaneously, and in continuous mode, to<br>
a rotary machine.<br>
In the example illustrated, the handling unit 4 is secured to a routing platform 6<br>
keyed to a first support shaft 5.<br>
In particular, the handling unit 4 also comprises a second support shaft 7 which<br>
is mobile so as to be able to rotate around the first vertical axis A, between an<br>
operating position of picking up of a pouch 102 and of a spout 133 and an<br>
operating position for transferring the same to the rowxy machine. The means<br>
for picking up a pouch and the means for picking up a spout arc installed on the<br>
said second support shaft 7.<br>
In the example illustrated, said means for picking up a pouch consist of a pair cf<br>
suction cups 8, 9 vertically aligned and arranged on the same vertical paire P (tn<br>
figure 1, said vertical plane P is viewed from the side).<br>
In the embodiment illustrated, the means for picking up a spout is preferably a<br>
^ripper 10.<br>
With particular reference to figure 1, the second support shaft 7 is secured<br>
pcrimetrically to the routing platform 6, which rotates around a second axis B<br>
which is substantially vertical and which passes through the said first support<br>
shaft 3. More precisely, the second support shaft 7 revolves around the first<br>
vertical axis A at the same tune as the rotating platform 6 routes around OK<br>
second vertical axis B, so thai the suction cups 8, 9 and the grippcr 10 are<br>
activated by hypocycloid movement as they travel from magazines 2 and 3 to<br>
the rotary machine for the processing of pouches and spouts.<br>
With particular reference to the embodiment shown in figure I, the rotating<br><br>
WO 2006/030464	PCT/lT20O4/00O506<br>
plalfonn 6 is moved directly by ihc rotary machine for the processing, of<br>
pouches and spouts, for example through &amp; mechanics! coupling of toothed<br>
gears 30 integral 10 the rotary machine and corresponding toothed gears 31,<br>
integral to the relating platform 6.<br>
ln. the example illustraicd. the second rotating shaft 7 is preferably moved by an<br>
electric motor 11 secured to the rotating platform 6 and therefore integral to said<br>
platform<br>
In the embodiment shown, the apparatus '. for feeding pouches and their<br>
respective spouts ts preferably built of a single rotating platform and several<br>
second rotating shafts 7, each of which equipped with at least a pair of suction<br>
cups for picking up and holding a pouch and at least one grippcr fur picking up a<br>
spout<br>
The method for feeding the pouches and spouts to the rotary machine for the<br>
processing of the same comprises the following phases.<br>
arranging a magazine of pouches;<br>
arranging 3 magazine of spouts,<br>
picking up of a pouch (102) from the corresponding magazene (2) and<br>
picking up ofa spout (103) from :he corresponding magazine (3).<br>
Lit a new and original manner, the method of the present invention comprises a<br>
step of simultaneous, continuous feeding of the pouches and spouts to the rotary<br>
machine for the processing of the same.<br>
Preferably, the step of feeding poches and spouts to the rotary machine for the<br>
processing of the same takes place through hypocycloid movement of the<br>
pouches and spouts from the magazines to a discharge point on said rotary<br>
machine.<br>
i<br><br>
WO 20O6/013O464	PCT/IT2004/000506<br>
The principle of operation of the invention is as follows.<br>
The rotating platform 6 is powered directly by the rotary machine for the<br>
processing of pouches and spoils through the coupling of toothed gears 30<br>
integral to the rotary machine and toothed gears 11 integral to the rotating<br>
piaifcmi 6<br>
At (he same time, the support shift 7 which is put of the handling unit 4 is m*dc<br>
to rotate around the first axis A by the cUctnc motor 11, integrally secured to<br>
rotating platform 6.<br>
In this way, the suction cups 8, 9 and the grippcr 10 are moved by hypocycloid<br>
movement, "travelling from the area where the pouches 102 and spouts 103 are<br>
picked up from their magazines 2, 3 to the area where the pouches and spouts<br>
are transferred to the rotary machine for the processing of the same (iadicatcd<br>
with the letter R in figure 2).<br>
In particular, as shown in figure 2. the trajectory- followed by the suction cups 8,<br>
9 and the Rrippcr 10 is indicated by point Q. Specifically, this point describes a<br>
cusp at magazines 2, 3 containing the pouches and spouts (only the magazine<br>
containing the pouches 102 is shown in figure 2), so :hat the absolute speed of<br>
movement of the suction cups and of the gripper is cancelled out. In this way,<br>
the suction cups and the gripper can pick up the pouches 102 and the spouts 103<br>
(which are not moving) without "wrenching" them from the:r respective<br>
magazine*.<br>
Subsequently, point Q shown in figure 2, follows a trajectory which<br>
substantially describes a circumferential arch so tha: the relative speed of the<br>
suction cups 8, 9 and of the grippcr 10 vs. the rotary machine R is cancelled out.<br>
In this way. the suction cups and the grippcr are able to transfer the pouches 102<br>
«<br><br>
WO 20O6/030464	PCT/IT20O4/OOO506<br>
and spouts 103 to the rotary machine R in a ptecise manner.<br>
The principle of operation described above refers to an apparatus equipped with<br>
a single handling unit 4, but it is identical for apparatuses equipped with several<br>
of these handling uniis.<br>
This invention offers some important advantages<br>
First of all. an apparatus in accordance with the present invention is able to feed<br>
both spouts and pouches in continuous mode, 'thus guaranteeing high<br>
productivity.<br>
Another important advantage of the present invention is that it can feed both<br>
spouts and pouches simultaneously.<br>
Advantageously, an apparatus in accordance with the present invention is<br>
compact and extremely reliable.<br>
A further advantage of the present invention is that it can handle pouches and<br>
spouts safely and without damaging them while till ensuring high productivity.<br>
