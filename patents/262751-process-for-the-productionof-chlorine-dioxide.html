				<td>PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF CHLORINE DIOXIDE<br>
The present invention relates to a process and a production unit for the<br>
production of chlorine dioxide from alkali metal chlorate, acid and a reducing agent.<br>
Chlorine dioxide is used in various applications such as pulp bleaching, fat<br>
bleaching, water purification and removal of organic materials from industrial wastes.<br>
Since chlorine dioxide is not storage stable, it is generally produced on-site.<br>
In large scale processes chlorine dioxide is usually produced by reacting alkali<br>
metal chlorate with a reducing agent in an aqueous reaction medium. Chlorine dioxide<br>
may be withdrawn from the reaction medium as a gas, like in the processes described in<br>
e.g. US patents 5091166, 5091167 and EP patent 612686. Normally the chlorine dioxide<br>
gas is then absorbed into water to form an aqueous solution thereof. These large-scale<br>
processes are highly efficient but require extensive process equipment and<br>
instrumentation.<br>
For the production of chlorine dioxide from alkali metal chlorate in small-scale<br>
units, such as for water purification applications or small bleaching plants, the chlorine<br>
dioxide is usually not separated from the reaction medium. Instead, a product stream<br>
comprising chlorine dioxide, salt, excess acid and optionally un-reacted chlorate is<br>
withdrawn from the reactor and used directly, usually after dilution with water in an<br>
eductor. Such processes have in recent years become commercial and are described in<br>
e.g. US patents 2833624, 4534952, 5895638, 6387344, 6790427 and 7070710, and in<br>
US patent applications Publ. No. 2004/0175322, Publ. No. 2003/0031621, Publ. No<br>
2005/0186131 and Publ. No. 2006/0133983. The required process equipment and<br>
instrumentation are considerably less extensive than in the large-scale processes<br>
described above. However, for some applications where small-scale units would be<br>
suitable, it may be desirable to obtain the chlorine dioxide as a gas phase, or as an<br>
aqueous solution of high concentration and/or without the excess acid and salt by-<br>
product.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a simple process for the production of<br>
chlorine dioxide of high concentration and/or being substantially free from excess acid<br>
and salt by-product.<br>
It another object of the invention to provide a production unit for performing the<br>
process.<br>
It has been found possible to meet these objects in a process where a product<br>
stream from a reactor is diluted in an eductor fed with a gaseous motive stream. Thus,<br>
one aspect of the invention concerns a process for the production of chlorine dioxide,<br>
said process comprising the steps of continuously: feeding to a reactor an acid, alkali<br>
metal chlorate and a reducing agent; reacting the alkali metal chlorate with the acid and<br><br>
the reducing agent to form a product stream comprising chlorine dioxide, water and alkali<br>
metal salt of the acid; and, bringing the product stream from the reactor to an eductor and<br>
mixing it with a gaseous motive stream fed to the eductor and thereby forming a diluted<br>
product stream. This diluted product stream can be used as such, e.g. as a bleaching<br>
agent, for water purification or any other suitable application for chlorine dioxide, but can<br>
also be treated in one or more unit operations.<br>
An embodiment of the invention further comprises the steps of bringing the<br>
diluted product stream to a gas-liquid separator; separating gas from liquid in the diluted<br>
product stream to form a gas stream comprising chlorine dioxide; and, withdrawing the<br>
gas stream comprising chlorine dioxide from the gas-liquid separator. This gas stream<br>
can be used as such in any suitable application for chlorine dioxide in gas phase such as<br>
bleaching or water purification, or be treated in one or more unit operations, such as<br>
absorption into water. In the latter case, the process preferably further comprises the<br>
steps of bringing the gas stream comprising chlorine dioxide from the gas-liquid separator<br>
to an absorber; contacting said gas stream with a flow of water to form an aqueous<br>
solution containing chlorine dioxide; and, withdrawing the aqueous solution containing<br>
chlorine dioxide from the absorber. This aqueous solution may then be used for any<br>
suitable application such as bleaching or water purification<br>
Another embodiment of the invention comprises the steps of bringing the diluted<br>
product stream from the eductor to an absorber; contacting the diluted product stream<br>
with a flow of water to form an aqueous solution containing chlorine dioxide; and,<br>
withdrawing the aqueous solution containing chlorine dioxide from the absorber. Thus,<br>
the diluted product stream is brought to the absorber without any previous gas-liquid<br>
separation. The aqueous solution obtained may be used for any suitable application such<br>
as bleaching or water purification.<br>
Using a gaseous motive stream instead of a liquid for the eductor enables<br>
production of chlorine dioxide of high concentration and/or substantially free from excess<br>
salts and acid with comparatively low duty on following unit operations such as gas-liquid<br>
separation and/or absorption. Moreover, the need for adding inert gas at a later stage to<br>
further dilute the chlorine dioxide to minimize the risk for decomposition is reduced and in<br>
some cases eliminated.<br>
The reactor can be operated as described in the earlier mentioned US patents<br>
2833624, 4534952, 5895638, 6387344, 6790427 and 7070710, and US patent<br>
application Publ. No. 2004/0175322, Publ. No. 2003/0031621 and Publ No<br>
US2005/0186131, which hereby are incorporated as references.<br><br>
Any reducing agent commonly used in cnionne dioxide production such as<br>
sulphur dioxide, chloride, methanol and hydrogen peroxide can be used, of which<br>
hydrogen peroxide is particularly preferred.<br>
The alkali metal chlorate is suitably fed to the reactor as an aqueous solution.<br>
The alkali metal may, for example, be sodium, potassium or mixtures thereof, of which<br>
sodium is most preferred. The acid is preferably a mineral acid such as sulfuric acid,<br>
hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, perchloric acid or mixtures thereof, of which sulfuric acid is<br>
most preferred. If the reducing agent is hydrogen peroxide, the molar ratio H2O2 to CIO3<br>
fed to the reactor is suitably from about 0.2:1 to about 2:1, preferably from about 0.5:1 to<br>
about 1.5:1, most preferably from about 0.5:1 to about 1:1. Usually it is preferred that the<br>
molar ratio of reducing agent to chlorate is at least stochiometric. Alkali metal chlorate<br>
always contains some chloride as an impurity, but it is fully possible also to feed more<br>
chloride to the reactor, such as metal chloride or hydrochloric acid. However, in order to<br>
minimize the formation of chlorine it is preferred to keep the amount of chloride ions fed<br>
to the reactor low, suitably below about 1 mol%, preferably below about 0.1 mol%, more<br>
preferably less than about 0.05 moi%, most preferably less than about 0.02 mol% CI of<br>
the CIO3 (including chloride present in the chlorate as an impurity from the production<br>
thereof)<br>
In the case sulfuric acid is used as a feed to the reactor, it preferably has a<br>
concentration from about 60 to about 98 wt%, most preferably from about 70 to about 85<br>
wt% and preferably a temperature from about 0 to about 80°C, most preferably from<br>
about 20 to about 60°C. Preferably from about 2 to about 7 kg H2SO4, most preferably<br>
from about 3 to about 5 kg H2SO4 is fed per kg CI02 produced. In order to use sulphuric<br>
acid of high concentration, a dilution and cooling scheme as described in US patent<br>
application Publ. No. 2004/0175322 is preferably applied.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment alkali metal chlorate and hydrogen<br>
peroxide is fed to the reactor in the form of a premixed aqueous solution, for example a<br>
composition as described in US 7070710. Such a composition may be an aqueous<br>
solution comprising from about 1 to about 6.5 moles/litre, preferably from about 3 to about<br>
6 moles/litre of alkali metal chlorate, from about 1 to about 7 moles/litre, preferably from<br>
about 3 to about 5 moles/litre of hydrogen peroxide and at least one of a protective<br>
colloid, a radical scavenger or a phosphonic acid based complexing agent, wherein the<br>
pH of the aqueous solution suitably is from about 0.5 to about 4, preferably from about 1<br>
to about 3.5, most preferably from about 1.5 to about 3. Preferably, at least one<br>
phosphonic acid based complexing agent is present, preferably in an amount from about<br>
0.1 to about 5 mmoles/litre, most preferably from about 0.5 to about 3 mmoles/litre. If a<br>
protective colloid is present, its concentration is preferably from about 0.001 to about 0.5<br><br>
moles/litre, most preferably from about 0.02 to about 0.05 moles/litre. If a radical<br>
scavenger is present, its concentration is preferably from about 0.01 to about 1<br>
moles/litre, most preferably from about 0.02 to about 0.2 moles/litre. Particularly preferred<br>
compositions comprise at least one phosphonic acid based complexing agent selected<br>
from the group consisting of 1-hydroxyethylidene-1,1-diphosphonic acid, 1-aminoethane-<br>
1,1-diphosphonic acid, aminotri (methylenephosphonic acid), ethylene diamine tetra<br>
(methytenephosphonic acid), hexamethylene diamine tetra (methylenephosphonic acid),<br>
diethylenetriamine penta (methylenephosphonic acid), diethylenetriamine hexa<br>
(methylenephosphonic acid), 1-aminoalkane-1,1-diphosphonic acids (such as<br>
morpholinomethane diphosphonic acid, N,N-dimethyl aminodimethyl diphosphonic acid,<br>
aminomethyl diphosphonic acid), reaction products and salts thereof, preferably sodium<br>
salts. Useful protective colloids include tin compounds, such as alkali metal stannate,<br>
particularly sodium stannate (Na2(Sn(OH)e). Useful radical scavengers include pyridine<br>
carboxylic acids, such as 2,6-pyridine dicarboxytic acid. Suitably the amount of chloride<br>
ions is below about 300 mmoles/litre, preferably below about 50 mmoles/litre, more<br>
preferably below about 5 mmoles/litre, most preferably below about 0.5 mmoles/litre.<br>
The temperature in the reactor is suitably maintained below the boiling point of<br>
the reactants and the liquid part of the product stream at the prevailing pressure,<br>
preferably from about 20 to about 80°C, most preferably from about 30 to about 60°C<br>
The pressure maintained within the reactor is suitably slightly subatmospheric, preferably<br>
from about 30 to about 100 kPa absolute, most preferably from about 65 to about 95 kPa<br>
absolute.<br>
The reactor may comprise one or several vessels, for example arranged<br>
vertically, horizontally or inclined. The reactants may be fed directly to the reactor or via a<br>
separate mixing device. Suitably the reactor is a preferably substantially tubular through-<br>
flow vessel or pipe, most preferably comprising means for mixing the reactants in a<br>
substantially uniform manner. Such means for mixing are described in e.g. US 6790427<br>
and US patent application Publ. No. 2004/0175322.<br>
The feed chemicals, including acid, alkali metal chlorate and reducing agent, are<br>
preferably fed close to one end of the reactor and the product stream is preferably<br>
withdrawn at the other end of the reactor.<br>
The length (in the main flow direction) of the reactor used is preferably from<br>
about 150 to about 1500 mm, most preferably from about 300 to about 900 mm. It has<br>
been found favourable to use a substantially tubular reactor with an inner diameter from<br>
about 25 to about 300 mm, preferably from about 50 to about 150 mm. It is particularly<br>
favourable to use a substantially tubular reactor having a preferred ratio of the length to<br>
the inner diameter from about 12:1 to about 1:1, most preferably from about 8:1 to about<br><br>
4:1. A suitable average residence time in the reactor is in most cases from about 1 to<br>
about 60 seconds, preferably from about 3 to about 20 seconds.<br>
The reaction between alkali metal chlorate, acid and reducing agent results in<br>
the formation of a product stream comprising chlorine dioxide, alkali metal salt of the acid,<br>
water and, in most cases some remaining unreacted feed chemicals. If hydrogen<br>
peroxide is used as reducing agent, the product stream also comprises oxygen. If sulfuric<br>
acid is used as acid, the product stream comprises alkali metal sulfate. In most cases the<br>
product stream comprises both liquid and gas and may at least partly be in the form of<br>
foam. Chlorine dioxide and oxygen may be present both as dissolved in the liquid and as<br>
gas bubbles, while the alkali metal salt of the acid usually is dissolved in the liquid.<br>
It has been found possible to achieve a conversion degree of alkali metal<br>
chlorate to chlorine dioxide from about 75% to 100%, preferably from about 80 to 100%,<br>
most preferably from about 95 to 100%.<br>
The product stream withdrawn from the reactor, including any liquid and gas<br>
therein, is brought to the eductor, preferably by a suction force created by the eductor.<br>
The product stream is then mixed in the eductor with the gaseous motive stream fed<br>
thereto to form a diluted product stream, usually also comprising both liquid and gas. Any<br>
kind of eductor that can be operated with a gaseous motive stream may be used, and<br>
such eductors are also commercially available. The gaseous motive stream, also referred<br>
to as motive gas, is preferably a gas or mixture of gases that is inert in respect of chlorine<br>
dioxide. Examples of such gases include nitrogen, oxygen and noble gases. For practical<br>
and economical reasons air is preferred.<br>
In the embodiments in which the diluted product stream from the eductor is<br>
brought to a gas-liquid separator, at least part of the gas dissolved in the liquid therein is<br>
separated therefrom. To facilitate the separation inert gas may be added to the diluted<br>
product stream, either within the gas-liquid separator or prior to entering the separator.<br>
Depending on how much gas that has been mixed into the product stream in the eductor,<br>
inert gas added in connection with gas-liquid separation may also serve the purpose of<br>
further diluting the chlorine dioxide and thereby minimising the risk for decomposition. In<br>
some cases inert gas may be introduced into to the gas stream leaving the gas-liquid<br>
separator. Any inert gas suitable as motive gas for the eductor can be used also for the<br>
gas-liquid separator. The gas stream withdrawn preferably comprises from about 1 to<br>
about 15 wt%, most preferably from about 3 to about 12 wt% of chlorine dioxide. Low<br>
concentrations are desirable for some applications like treatment of flue gas, while high<br>
concentrations are preferable in embodiments where the gas stream are brought to an<br>
absorber to produce an aqueous solution containing chlorine dioxide.<br><br>
In order to facilitate the gas-liquid separation the temperature in the separator is<br>
preferably maintained from about 30 to about 90°C, most preferably from about 40 to<br>
about 80°C, particularly from about 50 to about 75°C.<br>
In some cases it may be favourable to separate only part of the chlorine dioxide<br>
and thus withdraw in the gas stream, for example, from about 20 to about 80% or from<br>
about 30 to about 70% of the chlorine dioxide from the diluted product stream. In order to<br>
utilise the chlorine dioxide remaining in the liquid phase, this may at least partly be<br>
recovered as a liquid product and used for bleaching or water treatment where the<br>
remaining acid, salt and other possible by-products do not make any significant harm.<br>
The term gas-liquid separator as used herein, refers to any kind of equipment<br>
suitable for separating gas and liquid. Examples of gas-liquid separators are stripper<br>
columns, cyclone separators, vented tanks, etc.<br>
Examples of stripper columns include plate columns, packed bed columns and<br>
wetted-wall (falling film) columns. In an embodiment the stripper column is a packed bed<br>
column that may comprise any kind of standard packing, examples of which include<br>
Raschig rings, Berl saddles, Intalox saddles etc. A stripper column is preferably operated<br>
by entering the diluted product stream into the upper part of the column and blowing inert<br>
gas into the lower part thereof. The liquid phase is then preferably collected at the bottom<br>
of the column and withdrawn while the gas stream comprising chlorine dioxide can be<br>
withdrawn at any position above the liquid level.<br>
Examples of cyclone separators include those comprising a substantially<br>
cylindrical or at least partially conical vessel where the diluted product stream from the<br>
eductor is introduced substantially tangentially into the vessel, preferably into the upper<br>
part thereof. The liquid phase is preferably leaving the vessel at the bottom white the gas<br>
stream comprising chlorine dioxide preferably is leaving at the upper part of the vessel.<br>
To further facilitate the gas-liquid separation the cyclone separator is preferably operated<br>
at subatmospheric pressure. In case inert gas is added, it is preferably introduced directly<br>
into the cyclone separator or to the diluted product stream prior to entering the cyclone<br>
separator or to the gas stream leaving the gas-liquid separator.<br>
In case a tank is used as a gas-liquid separator it is preferably supplied with a<br>
blower for inert gas close to the bottom.<br>
The gas stream comprising chlorine dioxide may be withdrawn from the gas-<br>
liquid separator by any suitable means e.g. a device creating a subatmospheric pressure,<br>
such as a fan. The device may, for example, be placed directly after the gas-liquid<br>
separator or after an optional absorber.<br>
In case the diluted product stream from the eductor is brought to an absorber,<br>
soluble species such as alkali metal salt of the acid and unreacted feed chemicals are<br><br>
also absorbed into the water, while gaseous components with limited solubility, like<br>
oxygen, are withdrawn in a gas phase. The flow rate of the water to the absorber, either<br>
chilled or not, is preferably adjustable so that the chlorine dioxide concentration can be<br>
kept constant independently of the production rate. The aqueous solution obtained in the<br>
absorber can have a chlorine dioxide concentration within a wide range, for example from<br>
about 0.1 g/liter to about 12 g/liter, preferably from about 3 g/liter to about 10 g/liter, most<br>
preferably from about 4 g/liter to about 8 g/liter. The concentration of unreacted chlorate<br>
in the aqueous solution, which is dependent on the conversion degree, is suitably below<br>
about 0.33 moles/mole CIO2, preferably below about 0.11 moles/mole CI02, most<br>
preferably below about 0.053 moles/mole CIO?. The alkali metal salt concentration is<br>
dependent on the chlorine dioxide concentration and is suitably from about 0.74<br>
mmotes/liter to about 59 mmoles/liter. The pH of the aqueous solution can vary within a<br>
wide range, partly dependent of the chlorine dioxide concentration, for example from<br>
about 0.1 to about 1, preferably from about 0.2 to about 0.8.<br>
If a gas stream comprising chlorine dioxide from a gas-liquid separator is brought<br>
to an absorber, this is also operated as described above with the exception that non-<br>
gaseous components are not included. Thus, it is then possible to obtain an aqueous<br>
solution of chlorine dioxide substantially free from unreacted acid fed to the reactor or<br>
salts thereof, as well as of unreacted chlorate. The chlorine dioxide concentration of such<br>
a solution may be as stated above, while the pH in most cases is from about 2 to about 4.<br>
By the term absorber as used herein is meant any column or tower or the like<br>
where gas is contacted with a liquid flow to absorb soluble compounds therein, preferably<br>
in a continuous counter-current flow. Inside the absorber are preferably placed devices<br>
such as plates or packing elements to provide interfacial surfaces where the mass<br>
transfer between the gas and the liquid can take place. Examples of useful packing<br>
elements include Raschig rings, Beri saddles, Intalox saddles etc. Examples of plates<br>
include sieve plates and bubble cap plates.<br>
The process of the invention is particularly suitable for the production of chlorine<br>
dioxide in small-scale, for example from about 0.5 to about 250 kg CICVhr, preferably<br>
from about 10 to about 150 kg CICVhr.<br>
A typical small-scale production unit of the invention normally includes only one<br>
reactor, although it is possible to arrange several, for example up to about 15 or more<br>
reactors in parallel, for example as a bundle of tubes.<br>
The invention further concerns a production unit for the production of chlorine<br>
dioxide, said unit comprising a reactor provided with one or more feed inlets for acid,<br>
reducing agent and alkali metal chlorate and an outlet for a product stream; an eductor<br>
connected to the reactor provided with an inlet for a gaseous motive stream, means for<br><br>
mixing a product stream comprising chlorine dioxide from the reactor with the gaseous<br>
motive stream to obtain a diluted product stream, and an outlet for said diluted product<br>
stream.<br>
In an embodiment the production unit further comprises a gas-liquid separator<br>
connected to the outlet of the eductor, means for withdrawing a gas stream comprising<br>
chlorine dioxide from the gas-liquid separator, and optionally an absorber and means for<br>
bringing the gas stream comprising chlorine dioxide to the absorber.<br>
In an another embodiment the production unit comprises an absorber and<br>
means for bringing the diluted product stream from the eductor to the absorber.<br>
The production unit of the invention is particularly suitable for use in the process<br>
of the invention and regarding further optional and preferred features the above<br>
description of the process is referred to.<br>
Embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference to the<br>
enclosed drawing. The scope of the invention is, however, not limited to these<br>
embodiments but only to the scope of the appended claims.<br>
Figures 1, 2 and 3 schematically show process schemes of different<br>
embodiments of the invention.<br>
Common to the embodiments of Fig. 1, 2 and 3 is that sulphuric acid and a pre-<br>
mixed aqueous solution of sodium chlorate and hydrogen peroxide are fed to a vertical<br>
through-flow tubular reactor 1 and are reacted therein to form a product stream 2 of liquid<br>
and gas, usually at least partly as foam. The product stream 2 comprises chlorine dioxide,<br>
oxygen, sodium sulfate and some remaining sulfuric acid and sodium chlorate. An<br>
eductor 3 is supplied with motive gas, usually air, to generate a slightly subatmospheric<br>
pressure bringing the product stream 2 out from the reactor 1 into the eductor 3. The<br>
eductor 3 can be of any standard type comprising a chamber or the like in which the<br>
product stream 2 is mixed with motive gas 4 to form a diluted product stream 5, usually<br>
also comprising both liquid and gas with chlorine dioxide present in both phases.<br>
In the embodiment of Fig. 1, the diluted product stream 5 from the eductor 3 is<br>
brought to a gas-liquid separator 6 such as a stripper column, vented tank or a cyclone<br>
separator. The gas-liquid separator 6 is supplied with inert gas 7 such as air mixing with<br>
the gas separated from the diluted product stream to form a gas stream 8 comprising<br>
chlorine dioxide that is withdrawn. The liquid phase separated from the gas, an aqueous<br>
solution comprising sodium sulfate, sulfuric acid and usually some chlorate and dissolved<br>
gas, is withdrawn as a stream 9, and may, for example, be used for pH control, sulfur<br>
recovery or in some cases simply be disposed of after neutralisation.<br>
In the embodiment of Fig. 2 the gas-liquid separator 6 works as in the<br>
embodiment of Fig. 1, but the gas stream 8 comprising chlorine dioxide is brought to an<br><br>
absorber 10 fed with chilled water 11 to dissolve chlorine dioxide and form an aqueous<br>
solution thereof that is withdrawn as stream 12 and constitutes the actual product of the<br>
process. Gaseous components not dissolved, such as motive gas fed to the eductor 3,<br>
oxygen generated in the reactor 1 and inert gas introduced to the gas-liquid separator 8<br>
are withdrawn as stream 13.<br>
In the embodiment of Fig. 3 the diluted product stream 5 from the eductor 3 is<br>
brought to an absorber 10 fed with chilled water 11 to dissolve chlorine dioxide and form<br>
an aqueous solution thereof that is withdrawn as stream 12 and constitutes the actual<br>
product of the process. As there has been no previous gas-liquid separation the product<br>
stream 12 comprises not only chlorine dioxide, but also other soluble components from<br>
stream 5 such as sodium sulfate, sulfuric acid and usually some chlorate. Gaseous<br>
components not dissolved such as motive gas fed to the eductor 3 and oxygen generated<br>
in the reactor 1 are withdrawn as stream 13.<br>
The process equipment, including the reactor 1, the eductor 3 and the optional<br>
gas-liquid separator 6 and absorber 10, are suitably made from materials resistant to the<br>
chemicals they are in contact with, such as one or more of hydrogen peroxide, sodium<br>
chlorate, sulfuric acid and chlorine dioxide. Such materials include, for example, glass,<br>
tantalum, titanium, fiberglass reinforced plastic, fluoro plastics like PVDF (polyvinylidene<br>
fluoride) CPVC (chlorinated polyvinyl chloride), PTFE (polytetrafluoro ethylene), PFA<br>
(perfluoro alkoxy polymer), ECTFE (ethylene chlorotrifluoro ethylene) or FEP (fluorinated<br>
ethylene propylene), or the use of these materials as a liner material to a structural<br>
material like steel or stainless steel. Suitable fluoro plastics are sold under the trademarks<br>
Kynar®, Teflon® or Halar®.<br><br>
