Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to novel synthesis methods, to the products of such novel methods, and to uses of these products. In particular, the present invention provides methods for the reactions of furanones, tn particular fimbralides, with amines. The invention has particular application in the synthesis of halogenated 1,5-dihydro-pynrol-2-one, 5-halomethylene substituted 1,5-dihydropyrrol-2-ones (lactam analogues of fimbrolides) 5-amino substituted furanones and 5-aminomethylene-2(5H)-furanones and their synthetic analogues. The invention also relates to novel compounds and uses thereof.<br>
Background<br>
Fimbrolides (halogenated 5-methylene-2(5H)-furanones) possess a wide range of important biological properties including antifungal and antimicrobial properties (see WO 96/29392 and WO 99/53916, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by cross-reference) These metabolites can be isolated from red marine algae Delisea fimbnata, Delisea elegans and Del/sea puichra.<br>
Despite their biological activity very few hetero atom containing analogues of these molecules have been reported in the literature. The majority of the published syntheses of fimbrolides focus on the preparation of naturally occurring fimbrolides themselves. Recently we have developed methods that yield both the natural and non-natural fimbrolides in good yields (see WO 99/54323 and WO 0200639 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by cross-reference).<br>
We have now found that, surprisingly, fimbrolides undergo reactions with amines under mild conditions. We have found this discovery to be particularly useful in the synthesis of 5-hydroxy-5-aIkyl substituted 1,5-dihydro-pyrro!-2-one, 5-amino-5-alkyI substituted 2(5H)-furanones and 5-aminomethyIene substituted 2(5H)-furanones. Furthermore 5-hydroxy-5-halomethyl substituted 1,5-dihydro-pyiTol-2-one generated under these conditions can be dehydrated to yield 5-halomethylene substituted 1,5-dihydropyrrol-2-ones (lactam analogues of fimbrolides), and the 5-amino-5-bromomethyl substituted 2(5H)-furanones can be dehydrobrommated to yield a range of 5-aminomethylene<br><br>

The formation of a covalent interfacial linkage is much preferable to an ionic bond since in biological media where the salt content is such that ionic bonds are interfered with and ironically attached molecules can be displaced from a surface.<br>
In the context of substrates that are medical devices, covalent anchoring of the compound(s) also serves to eliminate concerns regarding possible deleterious effects that compounds might cause at sites distant from the device, such as in the liver, brain, or kidney tissues of a living human organism. In medical applications it is important to anchorthe furanone compound (s) via an interfacial covalent bond that is not subject to cleavage in the host environment that the biomedical device is to be placed in.,<br>
Methods for the covalent immobilization of organic molecules onto solid surfaces are well known to those skilled in the art Interfacial reactions leading to the formation of covalent interfacial bonds are denved from well known organic-synthetic reactions. The choice of immobilization reaction depends on both the nature of the substrate material and the chemical composition of the furanone derivative (s) that are desired for a particular application<br>
For example, a compound that contains a hydroxyl group in a side chain distal to the ring system, can be linked covalently onto surfaces using epoxide chemistry analogous to the reaction pathway described forthe immobilization of polysaccharides onto epoxidated surfaces in Li et a/., Surface Modification of Polymeric Biomateriais (BD Ratner and DG Castner, Eds), Plenum Press, NY, 1996 pages 165-173 (the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety), through isocyanate groups attached to the surface to produce stable urethane linkages through thermal processes, or through carboxylic acid groups or their equivalents, such as acid chlorides, on the surface to produce ester linkages. A compound that contains an aldehyde group can be linked onto surface amine groups using a reductive animation reaction. A compound that contains a carboxylic acid group can be linked onto surface amine groups using carbodumide chemistry<br>
interfacial coupling reactions must of course be selected not only for their ability to achieve the desired covalent linkage but also for avoidance of adverse effects on the furanone compound (s) to be attached. Particularly, the furanone<br><br>
WO 2004/016588	PCT/AU20O3/001053<br>
17<br>
nng system tends to be labile to alkaline conditions. Such limitations are well known to those skilled in the art. Among the many possible interfacial coupling reactions known in the art, there is sufficient scope for selection of reactions that proceed in a suitable pH range and with furanones substituted with various functional groups in various positions<br>
Some solid substrate matenals possess reactive surface chemical groups that can undergo chemical reactions with a partner group on a compound and thereby form a covalent interfacial linkage directly.<br>
Alternatively, in situ covalent linkage can be made directly through the addition of a doubly functionaiised linker molecule to the active surface in the presence of an appropriate compound, or stepwise by sequential addition of doubly functionaiised linker molecules and then an appropriate compound It is not always possible to immobilize furanone compounds directly onto solid substrate materials; in these cases, surface activation or one or more interfaciaf bonding layer (s) is used to effect covalent immobilization of the compounds. Such surface activation is essential when immobilizing compounds onto polymeric materials such as fluoropolymers and polyolefins.<br>
Surface activation of solid substrate matenals can be achieved in a number of ways. Examples are corona discharge treatment or low pressure plasma treatment of polymers. These methods are well known to introduce a vanety of functional groups onto polymeric surfaces.<br>
An alternative approach is to provide an interfacial bonding layer interspersed between the solid substrate material or medical device and the compound layer. The application of a thin fnterfacial bonding layer can be done using methods such as dip coating, spin coating, or plasma polymerization. The chemistry of the bonding layer is selected such that appropriate reactive chemical groups are provided on the surface of this layer, groups that then are accessible for reaction with compound of the invention.<br>
Particularly versatile is the subsequent application of multiple thin interfacial bonding layers; this method can provide a very wide range of desired chemical groups on the surface for the immobilization of a wide range of functionalized furanones and enables usage of compounds optimized for their biological efficacy.<br>
By providing a thin, surface-coated layer of compounds, the optical quality of antibacterial devices of this invention is not reduced, which makes the<br><br>

The active antibacterial layer comprises one or a plurality of furanorie compounds selected for both their antibacterial activity and absence of cytotoxicity as well as any other adverse biomedical effect on the host environment that the coated device contacts.<br>
In an eleventh aspect, the present invention provides incorporation of compounds produced by the methods according to the first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, or tenth aspects either in surface coatings or polymers through any part of the molecule, for example, newly Introduced functionality on the alkyl chain or the alkyl chain or the halomethylene functionality itself via direct polymerisation or copolymerisation with suitable monomers.<br>

Biological activity of furanones<br>
Effect of furanones as inhibitor of AHL-mediated quorum sensing, Ai-2 pathway and growth of S. aureus Methods Gfp assay<br>
Briefly, the Gfp assay determines the relative effectiveness of a compound as an inhibitor of AHL mediated quorum sensing. The assay is dependent on a bacterial strain that carries a reporter plasmid. This plasmid expresses the green fluorescent protein (Gfp) in the presence of AHLs (2). The presence of a competitor will prevent AHL mediated Gfp expression of the reporter. The assay can be used to generate an index of inhibition for each compound. The results here, presented as good, moderate, or poor, are based on the index of each of the compounds as an inhibitor of AHL mediated quorum sensing using this bioassay.<br>
Attachrnent/Biofiim formation<br>
The ability of furanones to inhibit biofilm formation or attachment has been<br>
determined using a modification of the 96 well microtitre method described by<br>
Christensen et al. ((1)). The furanones are added to the wells of the microplate and the solvent is allowed to evaporate, leaving the furanones adsorbed onto the plate. Then a suspension of the monitor bacterium, Pseudomonas aerugmosa, is added to each well and incubated for 24h. Following incubation, the wells are nnsed to remove unattached or loosely adhered cells. The attached wells are fixed with formaldehyde and subsequently stained with cyrstal violet. Following extensive washing to remove the crystal violet, the wells are read at 600 nm.

Two-Component signal transaction Assays Taz-1 Assay<br>
The Taz-assay carried out according to the method of Jin and Inouye (1993) with the following alterations. E coli RU1012 (pYT0301) were grownovernight In M9 medium at 37°C supplemented with 100 ug/ml ampicillin and 50 ug/ml kanamycin This overnight culture was then used to inoculate 50 ml M9 medium in side-arm flasks which were then incubated at 37°C and shaken at 180 rpm The OD610 of the growing cultures was monitored regularly and when the OD610 = 0.2 the cultures were placed on ice. Aspartate was added to side-arm flasks to give a final concentration of 3 mM (aspartate stock solution made up in M9 salts).<br>
The test compound or mixtures of, compounds were dissolved in ethanol and added to cultures to give the required final concentrations. Negative controls were prepared with equal volumes of ethanol. Cultures were then placed in a 37°C incubator and shaken for 4 hours (OD6io approximately 0.7) before being removed and put on ice. Samples were then removed for eta-galactosidase assays carried out according to the method of Miller (1972).<br>
V. harveyl bioassay for the detection of AI-2 activity<br>
The V. harveyi bioassay was performed as described previously (Surette and Bassler, 1998). The V. harveyi reporter strain BB170 was grown for 16 hours at 30°C with shaking in AB medium. Ceils were diluted 1 ;5,000 into 30°C prewarmed AB medium and 90 ul of the diluted suspension was added to wells containing supernatant. Furanones were added to the wells to achieve the desired final concentrations and the final volume in each well was adjusted with stenle medium to 100 ul. Ten ul of V. BB152 (AM-, AI-2+) supernatant was used as a positive control and 10 ul of E. coli DH5a supernatant or sterile media was used as a negative control. This strain of E. coll has previously been shown to harbor a mutation in the AI-2 synthase gene, ygaG, which results in a truncated protein wfth no Al-2 activtty (Surette et al. 1998). The microtiter plates were incubated at 30°C with shaking at 175 rpm. Hourly determinations of the total luminescence were quantified using the cherniluminescent setting on a Wallac (Gaithersburg, MD) model 1450 Microbeta Plus liquid scintillation counter.   The V, harveyi cell density was<br><br>

monitored by the use of a microplate reader (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Activity is reported as the percentage of activity obtained from V. harveyi BB152 cell-free supernatant. While the absolute values of luminescence varied considerably between experiments, the pattern of results obtained was reproducible.<br>
Growth of Staphylococcus aureus<br>
Material and methods<br>
The growth of Staphylococcus aureus against furanones was tested in sidearm<br>
flasks. One percent of an overnight culture was added to the growth media,<br>
Nutnent Broth, containing furanones at the concentrations 1-50 ug/ml. The<br>
bacteria were incubated at 37C and growth was measured at 610 nm.<br>
The results of these experiments are summarised in the table 1.<br>
