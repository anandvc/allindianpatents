SPIROCYCLIC  PXPERIDINES AS MCH1 ANTAGONISTS  AND TTS8S<br>
THEREOF<br>
This application claims priority of U.S. Serial No. 10/189,146, filed July 3, 2002, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Throughout this application, various publications are<br>
referenced    in    parentheses    by    author    and    year.	Full<br>
citations for these references may be found at the end of the specification immediately preceding  the  claims.<br>
The disclosure of these publications in their entireties are hereby incorporated by reference into this application to describe more fully the state of the art to which this invention pertains.<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is a cyclic peptide originally isolated from salmonid (teleost fish) pituitaries (Kawauchi et al., 1983). In fish the 17 amino acid peptide causes aggregation of melanin within the melanophores and inhibits the release of ACTH, acting as a functional antagonist of -MSH. Mammalian MCH (19 amino acids) is highly conserved between rat, mouse, and human, exhibiting 100% amino acid identity, but its physiological roles are less clear. MCH has been reported to participate in a variety of processes including feeding, water balance, energy metabolism, general arousal/attention state, memory and cognitive functions, and psychiatric disorders (for reviews, see Baker, -1991; Baker, 1994; Nahon, 1994; Knigge et al., 1996). Its role in feeding or body weight regulation is supported by a recent Nature publication (Qu et al., 1996) demonstrating that MCH is over expressed in the hypothalamus of oh/oh<br>
mice compared with ob/+ mice, and that fasting further increased MCH mRNA in both obese and normal mice during fasting. MCH also stimulated feeding in normal rats when injected into the lateral ventricles (Rossi et al,, 1997) .<br>
MCH also has been reported to functionally antagonize the behavioral effects of -MSH (Miller et al., 1993; Gonzalez et alr 1996; Sanchez et al., 1997); in addition, stress has been shown to increase POMC mRNA levels while decreasing the MCH precursor preproMCH (ppMCH) mRNA levels (Presse et al., 1992). Thus MCH may serve as an integrative neuropeptide involved in the reaction to stress, as well as in the regulation of feeding and sexual activity (Baker, 1991; Knigge et al., 1996).<br><br>
The biological effects of MCH are believed to be mediated by specific receptors, A tritiated ligand ( [3H] -MCH) was reported to exhibit specific binding to brain membranes but was unusable for saturation analyses, so neither affinity nor B were determined (Drozdz and Eberle, 1995) . Radioiodination of the tyrosine at position thirteen resulted in a ligand with dramatically reduced biological activity (see Drozdz and Eberle, 1995) . in contrast,       the      radioiodination      of      the      MCH      analogue<br>
[The13,Tyr19] -MCH was successful (Drozdz et al. , 1995); the<br>
ligand retained biological activity and exhibited specific<br>
binding to a variety of cell lines including mouse<br>
melanoma (B16-F1, G4F, and G4F-7), PC12, and COS cells.<br>
In G4F-7 cells, the KD = 0.118nM and the Bmax -1100<br>
si.tes/cell. Importantly, the binding was not inhibited by<br>
-MSH but was weakly inhibited by rat ANF (Ki = 116 nM vs.<br>
12    nM     for     native    MCH)      (Drozdz    et    al.,     1995).	More<br>
recently specific MCH binding was reported in transformed keratinocytes    (Burgaud   et    al.,    1997)    and    melanoma    cells<br>
(Orozdz et al., 1998), where photo-crosslinking studies suggest that the receptor is a membrane protein with an apparent molecular weight of 45-50 kDaltons, compatible with the molecular weight range of the GPCR superfamily of receptors. ' No radioautoradiographic studies of MCH resceptor  localisation using  this   ligand have been  reported<br>
ass yet.<br>
The localization and biological activities of MCH peptide suggest that the modulation of MCH receptor activity may be useful in a number of therapeutic applications. The role of MCH in feeding is the best characterized of its potential clinical uses. MCH is expressed in the lateral hypothalamus, a brain area implicated in the regulation of thirst and hunger (Grillon et al. , 1997); recently orexins A and B, which are- potent orexigenic agents, have been shown to have very similar localization to MCH in -the lateral    hypothalamus     (Sakurai    et   al. ,    1998) .        MCH   mRNA<br><br>
levels in this brain region are increased in rats after 24 hours of food-deprivation (Herve and Fellman, 1997) / after insulin injection, a significant increase in the abundance and staining intensity of MCH immunoreactive perikarya a"-d fibres was observed concurrent with a significant increase in the level of MCH mRNA (Bahjaoui-Bouhaddi et al., 1994).<br>
Consistent with the ability of MCHv to stimulate feeding in rats (Rossi et al., 1997) is the observation that MCK mRNA levels are upregulated in the hypothalami of obese oh/oh mice (Qu et al. , 1996), and decreased in the hypothalami of rats treated with leptin, whose food intake and body weight gains are also decreased (Sahu, 1998) . MCH appears to act as a functional antagonist of the melanocortin system in its effects on food intake and on hormone secretion within the HPA (hypothalamopituitary/adrenal axis) (Ludwig et al. , 1998). Together these data suggest a role for endogenous MCH in the regulation of energy balance and response to stress, and provide a rationale for the development of specific compounds acting at MCH receptors for use in the treatment of obesity and stress-related disorders.<br>
In all species studied to date, a major portion of the neurons of the MCH cell group occupies a rather constant location in those areas of the lateral hypothalamus and subthalamus where they lie and may be a part of some of the so-called % * extrapyramidal' motor circuits. These involve substantial striate- and pallidofugal pathways involving the thalamus and cerebral cortex, hypothalamic areas, and reciprocal connections to subthalamic nucleus, substantia nigra, and mid-brain centers (Bittencourt et al., 1992) . In their location, the MCH cell group may offer a bridge or mechanism for expressing hypothalamic visceral activity with appropriate and coordinated motor activity.  Clinically it may be of some value to consider<br><br>
the involvement of this MCH system in movement disorders, such is Parkinson=s disease and Huntingdon's Chorea in which extrapyramidal circuits are known to be  involved.<br>
Human genetic linkage studies have located authentic hMCH<br>
loci on chromosome 12 (12q23-24) and the variant hMCH loci<br>
on chromosome 5 (5ql2-13) (Pedeutour et al. , 1994). Locus<br>
12q23-24 coincides with a locus to which autosomal<br>
dominant cerebellar ataxia type II (SCA2) has been mapped<br>
(Auburger     et     al. ,     1992/     Twells     et    al. ,     1992) .	This<br>
disease comprises neurodegenerative disorders, including an olivopontocerebellar  atrophy.<br>
Furtherxmore, the gene for Darier' s disease, has been mapped. to locus 12q23-24 (Craddock et al., 1993) . Darier-■' s disease is characterized by abnormalities I keratimocyte adhesion and mental illnesses in some families. In view of. the functional and neuroanatomical pat terms of the MCH neural system in the rat and human brains',, the MCH gene may represent a good candidate for SCA2 cor Darier's disease. Interestingly, diseases with high social impact have been mapped to this locus. Indeed:,, the gene responsible for chronic or acute forms of spinal, muscular atrophies has been assigned to chromosome 5ql2-13 using genetic linkage analysis (Melki et al. , 199 0; Westbrook et al., 1992) . Furthermore, independent lines of evidence support the assignment ■ of a major schizaiplirenia locus to chromosome 5qll. 2-13.3 (Sherrington et al-, 1988; Baesett et al., 19B8; Gilliam et al. , 1989). The ataove studies suggest that MCH may play a role in neurodegenerative diseases and disorders of  emotion.<br>
Additional therapeutic applications for MCH-related<br>
compounds are suggested by the observed effects- of MCH in<br>
other biological systems. For example, MCH may regulate<br>
reproductive    functions    in    male    and    female    rats.	MCH<br>
transcsripts   and   MCH   peptide   were   found   within   germ   cells<br><br>
in testes of adult rats, suggesting that MCH may participate in stem 'cell renewal and/or differentiation of early spermatocytes (Hervieu et al., 1996) . MCH injected directly into , the medial preoptic area (MPOA) or ventromedial nucleus (VMN) stimulated sexual activity in female rats (Gonzalez et al. , 1996). In ovariectcmized rats primed with estradiol, MCH stimulated luteinizing hormone (LH) release while anti-MCH antiserum inhibited LH release (Gonzalez, et al. , 1997). The zona incerta, which contains, a large population of MCH cell bodies, has previously been identified as a regulatory site fcr the pre-ovulatory  LH  surge   (MacKenzie  et  al. ,   1984).<br>
MCi has been reported to influence release of pituitary hov-nones -including ACTH and oxytocin. MCH analogues may also be useful in treating epilepsy. In the PTZ seizure model, injection of MCH prior to seizure induction pr evented seizure activity in both rats and guinea pigs, suggesting that MCH-containing neurons may participate in the neural circuitry underlying PTZ-induced s e i zure (Knigge and Wagner, 1997) . MCH has also been observed to af Ject behavioral correlates of cognitive functions. MCH treatment hastened extinction of the passive avoidance response in rats (McBride et al., 1994) , raising the possibility that MCH receptor antagonists may be beneficial for memory storage and/or retention, • A possible role for MCH in the modulation or perception of pain is supported by the dense innervation of the periaqueductal grey (PAG) by MCH-positive fibers. Finally, MCH may participate in the regulation of fluid intake. ICV infusion of MCH in conscious sheep produced diuretic, natriuretic, and kaliuretic changes in response to increased plasma volume (Parkes, 1996). Together with anatomical data reporting the presence of MCH in fluid regulatory areas of the brain, the results indicate that MCH may be an important peptide involved in the central contxol  of  fluid homeostasis   in mammals.<br><br>
The identification of a G-protein coupled, receptor for MCH<br>
has recently been published {Chambers et al. , 1999; Saito<br>
et    al.„     1999) .	These    groups    identified    MCH    as     the<br>
endogenous ligand for the human orphan .G-protein coupled receptor SLC-1 (Lakaye et al., 1998). The rat homologue of this receptor (now called MCH-1) was reported to be localized in regions of the rat brain associated with feeding behavior (e.g. dorsomedial and ventromedial hypothalamus) . The link between MCH-1 and the effects of MCH on .feeding has been strengthened by recent reports on the phenotype of MCH-1 knockout mice. ..Two groups have shown independently (Marsh et al, 2002; Chen et al, 2002) that the targeted disruption of the MCII-1 receptor gene (MCH-1 knockout) in mice results in animals that are hyperphaigic but are lean and have decreased body * mass relative to wild-type littermates. The . decrease in body mass is attributed to an increase in metabolism. Each group demonstrated that the MCH-1 knockout mice are resist arat to diet-induced obesity, and generally exhibit weights   similar  to littermates maintained, on regular  chow.<br>
f Finally,,     synthetic    antagonist    molecules     for    the     MCH-1<br>
receptor:    have    now    been    described    in .the     literature.<br>
Bednarefe   et   al.     (2002)    have   reported   on   the   synthesis   of<br>
high   affinity peptide   antagonists   of   MCH-1.       In   addition,<br>
a   small   molecule antagonist  of  MCH-1  has  been  described by<br>
Takekawa   et   al-    (Takekawa   et   al.,    2002)..      This   compound,<br>
T-226296,    exhibits    high   affinity   for   th,e    MCH-1   receptor<br>
(-5-9    nW    for    rat    and   human    MCH-1) ,    and    was    shown    to<br>
inhibit   food intake   induced by the  intracerebroventricular<br>
application   of   MCH.      These   data  validate,   the   strategy   of<br>
using an MCH-1  receptor antagonist  to treat   obesity.<br>
Furthermore, in our own studies, we have tested MCH1 antagonists in several animal models that are well known as    predictive    for    the    efficacy   of    compounds    in    humans<br><br>
(Borowsky, et al. , Nature Medicine 2003) . These experiments indicate that MCHl antagonists are useful to treat obesity, depression, anxiety, as well as urinary disorders.<br>
Herein, we report the synthesis of secondary amino anilinic piperidines that bind to the cloned human melanin-concentrating hormone-1 (MCHl) receptor. Additionally, these compounds selectively bind to the MCHl-receptor against other cloned G-protein coupled receptor.   The ability to inhibit the activation of the<br>
cloned receptor as measured in in vitro assays is disclosed.<br>
Furthermore, the compounds of the present invention may also be used to treat abnormal conditions mediated by inactivation  of  the  MCH-1  receptor  such  as  feeding disorders   (obesity,   bulimia  and  bulimia  nervosa), sexual/reproductive   disorders,   depression,   anxiety, depression and anxiety, epileptic seizure, hypertension, cerebral  hemorrhage,  congestive  heart  failure,  sleep disturbances, or any condition in which antagonism of an MCHl receptor may be beneficial.<br>
In addition, the compounds of the present invention may be used to reduce the body mass of a subject. Furthermore, the compounds of the present invention may be used to treat urinary disorders.<br><br>

In some cases, cell lines that grow as adherent monolayers can be converted to suspension culture to increase cell yield and provide' large batches of uniform assay material for routine receptor screening projects.<br>
Transient expression<br>
DNA encoding proteins no r?e studied can be transiently expressed in a variety of mammalian, insect, amphibian and other cell lines by several methods including but not restricted to; calcium phosphate-mediated, DEAE-dextran mediated, Liposomal-mediated, viral-mediated, electroporation-mediated and microinjection delivery. Each of these methods may require optimization of assorted experimental parameters depending on the DNA, cell line, and the type of assay to be subsequently employed.<br>
A typical protocol for the calcium phosphate method as applied to Peak rapid 293 cells is described as follows*.<br>
Adherent cells are harvested approximately twenty-four hours before transfection and replated at a density of 3,5 x 10* cells/dish in a 150 mm tissue culture dish and allowed to incubate over night at 37°C at 5% C03. 250 Fl of a mixture of CaCl2 and DNA (15 Fg DNA in 250 mM CaCl2) is added to a 5 ml plastic tube and 500 Fl of 2X HBS (280 mM<br><br>
NaCl, 10 m KC1, 1.5 mM Na^HP04/ 12 mM dextrose, 50 mM HEPES) is slowly added with gentle mixing. The mixture, is allowed to incubate for 20 minutes at room temperature to allow a DNA precipitate to form. The DNA' precipitate mixture is then added to the culture medium in each plate and incubated for 5 hours at 3 7°C, 5% C02. After the incubation, 5ml of culture medium (DMEM, 10% PBS, 10% L-glut and 50 g/ml gentamycin) is added to each plate. The cells are then incubated for 24 to 48 hours at 37°C, 5% C02.<br>
A typical protocol for the DEAE-dextran method as applied to Cos-7 cells is described as follows; Cells to be used for transfection are split 24 hours prior to the transfection to provide flasks which are 70-8 0% confluent at the time of transfection. Briefly, 8 Fg of receptor DNA plus 8 Fg of any additional DNA needed (e.g. G protein expression vector, reporter construct, antibiotic resistance marker, mock vector, etc.) are added to 9 ml of complete DMEM plus DEAE-dextran mixture (10 mg/ml in PBS) . Cos-7 cells plated into a T225 flask (sub-confluent) are washed once with PBS and the DNA mixture is added to each flask. The cells are allowed to incubate for 30 minutes at 37°C, 5% C02. Following the incubation, 36 ml of complete DMEM with 80 FM chloroquine is added to each flask and allowed to incubate an additional 3 hours. • The medium is then aspirated and 24 ml of complete medium containing 10% DMSO for exactly 2 minutes and then aspirated. The cells are then washed 2 times with PBS and 30 ml of complete DMEM added to each flask. The cells are then allowed to incubate over night. The next day the cells are harvested by trypsinization and reseeded as needed depending' upon the type of assay to be performed.<br>
A typical protocol for liposomal-mediated transfection as applied to CHO cells is described as follows/ Cells to be used for transfection are split 24 hours prior to the<br><br>
transfection to provide flasks which are 70-80% confluent at the time of transfection. A total of lOFg of DNA which may include varying ratios of receptor DNA plus any additional DNA needed (e.g. G protein expression vector, reporter construct, antibiotic resistance marker, mock vector, etc.) is used to transfect each 75 cm2 flask of cells. Liposomal mediated transfection is carried out according to the manufacturer's recommendations (LipofectAMINE, GibcoBRL, Bethesda, MD) . Transfected cells are harvested 24 hours post transfection and used or reseeded according the requirements of che assay to be employed.<br>
A typical protocol for the electroporation method as applied to Cos-7 cells is described as follows/ Cells to be used for transfection are split 24 hours prior to the transfection to provide flasks which are subconfluent at the time of transfection. The cells are harvested by trypsinization resuspended in their growth media and counted. 4 x 10* cells are suspended in 300 Fl of DMEM and placed into an electroporation cuvette. 8 Fg of receptor DNA plus 8 Fg of any additional DNA needed (e.g. G protein expression vector, reporter construct, antibiotic resistance marker, mock vector, etc.) is added to the cell suspension, the cuvette is placed into a BioRad Gene Pulser and subjected to an electrical pulse (Gene Pulser settings: 0.25 kV voltage, 950 FF capacitance). Following the pulse, 800 Fl of complete DMEM is added to each cuvette and the suspension transferred to a sterile tube. Complete medium is added to each tube to bring the final cell concentration to 1 x 10s cells/100 Fl. The cells are then plated as needed depending upon the type of assay to be performed.<br>
A typical protocol for viral mediated expression of heterologous proteins is described as follows for baculovirus infection of insect Sf9 cells.. The coding<br><br>
region of DNA encoding the receptor disclosed herein may be subcloned into pBlueBacIII into -existing restriction sites or sites engineered into sequences 5' and 3 ' to the coding  region  of  the  polypeptides.   To  generate baculovirus, 0.5 Fg of viral DNA (BaculoGold) and 3 Pg of DNA construct encoding a polypeptide may be co-transfected into 2 x 10s Spodoptera  frugiperda  insect Sf9 cells by the calcium phosphat/e co-precipitation method, as outlined in by Pharmingen (yi "Baculovirus Expression Vector System: Procedures  and Methods Manual") .  The  cells  then  are incubated for 5 days at 27°C. The supernatant of the co-transfection plate may be collected by centrifugation and the recombinant virus plaque purified. The procedure to infect cells with virus, to prepare stocks of virus and to titer the virus stocks are as described .in Pharmingen=s manual.  Similar principals would in general apply to mammalian  cell  expression  via  retro-viruses,  Simliki forest virus and double stranded DNA viruses  snrh • gP adeno-, herpes-, and vacinia-viruses, and the like.<br>
Stable expression<br>
Heterologous DNA can be stably incorporated into host cells, causing the cell to perpetually express a foreign protein. Methods for the delivery of the DNA into the cell are similar to those described above for transient expression-but require the co-transfection of an ancillary gene to confer drug resistance on the targeted host cell. The ensuing drug resistance can be exploited to select and maintain    cells    that    have    taken    up    the<br><br>
heterologous DNA, An assortment o£ resistance genes are available including but not restricted to Neomycin, Kanamvcin, and Hygromycin. For the purposes of receptor studies, stable expression of a heterologous receptor protein is carried out in, but not necessarily restricted to, mammalian cells including, CHO, HEK293, LM(tk-), etc.<br>
Cell membrane preparation<br>
For binding assays, pellets of transfected cells are suspended in ice-cold buffer (20 mM Tris.HCl, 5 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) and homogenized by sonication for 7 sec. The cell lysates are centrifuged at 200 x g for 5 min at 4°C. The supernatants are then centrifuged at 40,000 x g for 20 min at 4°C. The resulting pellets are washed once in the homogenization buffer and suspended in binding buffer (see methods for radioligand binding) . Protein concentrations are determined by the method of Bradford (1976) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Binding assays are usually performed immediately, however it is possible to prepare membranes in batch and store frozen in liquid nitrogen for future use.<br>
Radioligand binding assays<br>
Radioligand binding assays for the rat MCH1 receptor were carried out using plasmid pcDNA3.1-rMCHl-f (ATCC Patent Deposit Designation No. PTA-3505) . Plasmid pcDNA3 ,1-rMCHl-f comprises the •regulatory elements necessary for expression of DNA in a mammalian cell operatively \inked to DNA encoding the rat MCH1 receptor so as to permit expression thereof. Plasmid pcDNA3.1-rMCHl-£ was deposited on July 05, 2001, with the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) f 12301 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, Maryland 20852, U. S.A. under the provisions of the Budapest Treaty for the International Recognition of the Deposit of Microorganisms for the Purposes of Patent Procedure and was accorded ATCC Patent Deposit Designation No. PTA-3505,<br><br>
Binding assays can also be performed as described hereinafter using plasmid pEXJ.HR-TL231 (ATCC Accession No. 203197) Plasmid pEXJ.HR-TL231 encodes the human MCHl receptor and was deposited on September 17, 1998, with the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), 12301 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, Maryland 20852, U.S.A. under the provisions of the Budapest Treaty for the International Recognition of the Deposit: of Microorganisms for the Purposes of Patent Procedure and was accorded ATCC Accession No. 203197.<br>
Human embryonic kidney Peak rapid 2 93 cells (Peakr2 93 cells) were transiently transfected with DNA encoding the MCHl receptor utilizing the calcium phosphate method and cell membranes were prepared as described above. Binding experiments with membranes from Peakr2 93 cells transfected with the rat MCHl receptor were performed with 0.08 nM [3H] Compound A (custom labeled by Amersham) (the synthesis<br>
of Compound A is . described in detail below) using an incubation buffer consisting of 50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCla, 0.16 mM PMSF, 1 mM 1,10 phenantroline and 0.2% BSA. Binding was performed at 25°C for 90 minutes. Incubations were terminated by rapid vacuum filtration over GF/C glass fiber filters, presoaked in 5% PEI using 50 nM Tris pH 7.4 as wash buffer. In all experiments, nonspecific binding is defined using 10 FM-Compound A.<br>
Functional assays<br>
Cells may be screened for the presence of endogenous mammalian receptor using functional assays. Cells wi.th no or a low level of endogenous receptor present may be transfected with the exogenous receptor for use in functional assays.<br>
A wide spectrum of assays can be employed to screen for receptor  activation.   These  range  from  traditional<br><br>
measurements of phosphatidyl inositol, cAMP, Ca++, and K+ for example; to systems measuring these same second messengers .but which have been modified or adapted to be higher throughput, more generic, and more sensitive; to cell based platforms reporting more general cellular events resulting from receptor activation such as metabolic changes, differentiation, and cell division/proliferation, for example; to high level organism assays which monitor complex physiological or behavioral changes thought to be involved with receptor activation including cardiovascular, analgesic, orexigenic, anxiolytic, and sedation effects, for example.<br>

VI-  In-Vivo Methods<br>
The following in  vivo  methods are performed to predicrt the efficacy of MCHl antagonists for the treatment of obesity (3-day  body  weight  and  sweetened  condensed  milk) , depression (forced swim test), anxiety (social interaction test) , and urinary disorders (DIRC and CSTI) .<br>
Effects of MCHl Antagonists on Body Weight (3 Day)<br>
Male Long Evans rats (Charles River) weighing 180-200 grams are housed in groups of four on a 12 hour light/dark cycle with free access to food and water. Test compounds<br>
are administered twice daily via i.p. injection, 1 hour before the dark cycle and 2 hours after lights on, for three days. All rats are weighed daily after each morning injection.   Overall ■ results are expressed as body weight<br>
(grams) gained per day (mean ± SBM) and are analyzed by two-way ANOVA. Data for each time point are analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by post hoc Newman-Keuls test- The data  are  analyzed  using  the  GraphPad  Prism  (v2.01)<br>
(GraphPad Software, Inc. , San Diego, CA) . All data are presented as means +/ S.E.M.<br>
Effects of MCHl Antagonists on Consumption of Sweetened Condensed Milk<br>
Male C57BL/6 mice (Charles River) weighing 17-19 grams at the start of experiments are housed in groups of four or five on a 12 hour light/dark cycle with free access to food and water. For 7 days, mice are weighed, placed in individual cages and allowed to drink sweetened condensed milk (Nestle, diluted 1:3 with water) for 1 hour, 2-4 hours into the light cycle. The amount of milk consumed is determined by weighing the milk bottle before and after each drinking bout.  On the test day, mice received i.p.<br><br>
injections of Test Compound (3, 10 or 30 mg/kg in o .01 % lactic acid), vehicle (0.01 % lactic acid) of d-fenfluramine (10 mg/kg in 0.01 % lactic acid) 3 0 min. prior to exposure to milk.- The amount of milk consumed on the test day (in mis milk/ kg body weight) is compared to the baseline consumption for each mouse determined on the previous 2 days. Data for each time point are analyzed by one-way ANOVA.<br>
Forced Swim Test (FST) in the Rat<br>
Animals<br>
Male Sprague-Dawley .rats (Taconic Farms, NY) are used in all experiments. Rats are housed 5 per cage and maintained on a 12:12-h light-dark cycle. Rats are handled for 1 minutes each day for 4 days prior to behavioral testing.<br>
Drug Administration<br>
Animals are randomly assigned to receive a single i.p. administration of vehicle (2.5% EtOH / 2.5% Tween-80) , imipramine (positive control; 60 mg/kg), or Test Compound 60 minutes before the start of the 5 minute test period. All injections are given using 1 cc tuberculin syringe with 26 3/8 gauge needles . (Becton-Dickinson, VWR Scientific, Bridgeport, NJ) . The volume of. injection is l ml/kg.<br>
Experimental Design<br>
The procedure' used in this study is similar to that previously described (Porsolt, et al., 1978), except the water depth is 31 cm in this procedure. The greater depth in this test prevents the rats from supporting themselves by touching the bottom of the cylinder with their feet. Swim sessions are conducted by placing rats in individual plexiglass cylinders (46 cm tall x 20 cm in diameter) containing  23-25°C water 31 cm deep.  Swim tests are<br><br>
conducted always between 900 and 1700 hours and consisted of an initial 15-min conditioning test followed 24h later by a 5-minute test. Drug treatments are administered 60 minuses, before the 5-minute test -period. Following all swim sessions, rats are removed from the cylinders, dried with paper towels and placed in a heated cage for 15 minutes and returned to their home cages. All test sessions are videotaped using a color video camera and recorded for scoring later.<br>
Behavioral Scoring<br>
The rat's behavior is rated at 5 second intervals during the 5 minute test by a single individual, who is blind to the treatment condition.  Scored behaviors are:<br>
1.	Immobility- rat remains floating in the water without struggling and is only making those movements necessaxy to keep its head above water;<br>
2.	Climbing - rat is making active movements with its forepaws in and out of the water, usually directed against the walls;<br>
3.	Swimming -    rat is making active swimming motions, more than necessary to merely maintain its head above-water, e.g. moving around in the cylinder; and<br>
4.	Diving -  entire body of the rat is submerged.<br>
Data Analysis<br>
The forced swim test data (immobility, swimming, climbing, diving) are sub j ect ed to a randomi zed, one -way ANOVA and post hoc tests conducted using the Newman-Keuls test. The data are analyzed using the GprahPad Prism(v2.01) (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) . All data are presented as means _+ S.E.M. All data are presented as means _+ S.E.M.<br>
Forced Swim Test (FST) in the Mouse<br>
Animals<br><br>
DBA/2 mice (Taconic Farms, NY) are used in all experiments. Animals are housed 5 per cage in a controlled environment under a 12*12 hour light:dark cycle. Animals are handled 1 min each day for 4 days prior to the experiment. This procedure included a mock gavage with a 1.5 inch feeding tube.<br>
Drug Administration<br>
Animals are randomly assigned to receive a single administration of vehicle (5% EtOH/5% Tween-80) , Test Compound, or i'mipramine (60 mg/kg) by oral gavage 1 hour before the swim test.<br>
Experimental Design<br>
The procedure for the forced swim test in the mouse is similar to that described above for the rat, with some modifications. The cylinder used for the test is a 1 liter<br>
beaker  CIO. 5cm diameter—X—rs—cm lieiylit)	fill—to . 80 0ml<br>
(10cm depth) of 23-25°C water. Only one 5-minute swim test is conducted for each mouse, between 13 00 and 1700 hours. Drug treatments are administered 3 0-60 minutes before the 5-minute test period. Following all swim sessions, mice are removed from the cylinders, dried with paper towels and placed in a heated cage for 15 minutes. All test sessions are videotaped using a Sony -color video camera and recorder for scoring later.<br>
Behavorial Scoring<br>
The behavior during minutes 2-5 of. the test is played back on a TV monitor and scored by the investigator. The total time spent immobile (animal floating with only minimal 'movements to remain afloat) and mobile (swimming and movements beyond those required to remain afloat) are recorded.<br><br>
Data Analysis<br>
The forced swim test data (time exhibiting immobility, mobility; seconds) are subjected to a randomized, one-way ANOVA and post hoc tests conducted using the Newman-Keuls test. The data are analyzed using the GraphPad Prism (v2.01) (GraphPad Software, Inc. , San Diego, CA) . All data are presented as means + S.E.M.<br>
Social Interaction Test (SIT)<br>
Rats are allowed to acclimate to the animal care facility for 5 days and are housed singly for 5 days prior to testing. Animals are handled for 5 minutes per day. The design and procedure for the Social Interaction Test is carried out as previously described by Kennett,  et al.<br>
(199 7) . On the test day, weight matched pairs of rats (± 5%) , unfamiliar to each other, are given identical treatments and returned to their home cages. Animals are randomly divided into 5 treatment groups,—with 5 pairs per group, and are given one of the following i.p. treatments: Test Compound (10, 30 or 100 mg/kg), vehicle (1 ml/kg) or chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg) . Dosing is 1 hour prior to testing. Rats are subsequently placed in a white perspex test box or arena (54 x 37 x 26 cm) , whose floor is divided up into 24 equal squares, for 15 minutes. An air conditioner is used to generate background noise and to keep the room, at approximately 74°P. All sessions are videotaped using a JVC camcorder (model GR-SZ1, Elmwood Park, NJ) with either TDK (HG ultimate brand) or Sony 30 minute videocassettes. All sessions are conducted between 1300 - 1630 hours. Active social interaction, defined as grooming, sniffing, biting, boxing, wrestling, following and crawling over or under, is scored using a stopwatch (Sportsline model no. 226, 1/100 sec. discriminability). The number of episodes of rearing (animal completely raises up its body on its hind limbs) , grooming (lioking, biting, scratching of body), and face ishing (i.e. hands are moved repeatedly over face), and number of squares<br><br>
crossed are scored. Passive social interaction (animals are lying beside or on top of each other) is not scored. All behaviors are assessed later by an observer who is blind as to the treatment of each pair. At the end of each test, the box is thoroughly wiped with moistened paper towels.<br>
Animals<br>
Male albino Sprague-Dawley rats (Taconic Farms, NY) are housed in pairs under a 12 hr light dark cycle (lights on at 0700 hrs.) with free access to food and water.<br>
Drug Administration<br>
Test Compound is dissolved in 100% DMSO or 5% lactic acid, v/v (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO). Chlordiazepoxide (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) is dissolved in double distilled water. The vehicle consists of 5 0% DMSO (v/v) or 10 0% dimethylacetamide (DMA) . All drug solutions are made up 10 minutes prior to injection and the solutions are discarded at the end of the test day. The volume of drug solution administered is 1 ml/kg.<br>
Data Analysis<br>
The social interaction data (time interacting, rearing and squares crossed) are subjected to a randomized, one-way ANOVA and post hoc tests conducted using the Student-Newman-Keuls test. The data are subjected to a test of normality (Shapiro-Wilk test) . The data are analyzed using the GBSTAT program, version 6.5 (Dynamics Microsystems, Inc., Silver Spring, MD, 1997) .  All data<br>
are presented as means V S.E.M.<br>
Jn Vivo Models of the Micturition Reflex<br><br>
The    effects   of    compounds   on   the   micturition   reflex   are assessed in the   l'distension-induced rhythmic  contraction" (DIRC),   as   described   in  previous   publications    (e.g.   Maggi et    al,    1987;    Morikawa   et   al,    1992) ,    and   Continuous   Slow Transvesicular Infusion   (CSTI)   models   in rats.<br>
DIRC   Model<br>
Female Sprague Dawley rats weighing approximately 3 00 g are anesthetized with subcutaneous urethane (1.2 g/kg) . The trachea is cannulated with PE240 tubing to provide a clear airway throughout the experiment. A midline abdominal incision is made and the left and right ureters are isolated. The ureters are ligated distally (to prevent escape of fluids from the bladder) and cannulated proximally with PE10 tubing. The incision is closed using<br>
4-0—silk—outures,—leaving—the—PE10—1 ines	mnhpH t-.o t-he<br>
exterior for the elimination of urine. The bladder is canulated via the transurethral route using PE5 0 tubing inserted 2-5 cm beyond the urethral opening. This cannula is secured to the tail using tape and connected to a pressure transducer. To prevent leakage from the bladder, the cannula is tied tightly to the exterior urethral opening using 4-0 silk.<br>
To initiate the micturition reflex, the bladder is -first emptied by applying pressure to the lower abdomen, and then filled with normal saline in 100 increments (maximum » 2 ml) until spontaneous bladder contractions occurred (typically 20-40 mmHg at a rate of one contraction every 2 to 3 minutes. Once a regular rhythm is established, vehicle (saline) or Test Compounds are administered i .v. or i.p. to explore their effects on bladder activity. The 5-HT1A antagonist WAY-100635 is given as a positive control.  Data are expressed as contraction interval (in<br><br>
seconds) before drug application (basal),  or after the application of vehicle or test article.<br>
Continuous Slow Transvesicular Infusion (CSTI) rat Model<br>
Male Sprague Dawley rats weighing approximately 3 00 g are used for the study. Rats are anaesthetized with pentobarbitone sodium (50 mg/kg, i.p). Through a median abdominal incision, bladder is exposed and a polyethylene cannula (PE SO) is introduced into the bladder through a small cut on the dome of the bladder and the cannula is secured with a purse string suture. The other end of the cannula is exteriorized subcutaneously at the dorsal neck area. Similarly, another cannula (PE 50) is introduced into the stomach through a paramedian abdominal incision with the free end exteriorized subcutaneously to the neck region. The surgical wounds are closed with silk 4-0 suture and the animal is allowed to recover with appropriate post surgical care. On the following day, the animal is placed in a rat restrainer. The open end of the bladder- cannula is connected to a pressure transducer as well as infusion pump through a three-way stopcock. The bladder voiding cycles are initiated by continuous infusion of normal saline at the rate of 100 /il/min. The repetitive voiding contractions are recorded on a Power Lab on-line data acquisition software. After an recording the basal voiding- pattern for an hour, the test drug or vehicle is administered directly into stomach through the intragastric catheter and the voiding cycles are monitored for 5 hours. Micturition pressure and frequency are calculated before and after the treatment (at every 3*0 min interval) for each animal. Bladder capacity is calculated from the micturition frequency, based on the constant infusion of lOOul/min. The effect of the test drug is expressed as a percentage of basal, pre-drug bladder capacity. WAY 100635 is used as positive control for comparison.<br><br>
