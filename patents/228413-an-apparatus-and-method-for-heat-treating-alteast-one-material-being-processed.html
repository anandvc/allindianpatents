				<td>Description<br>
Apparatus and method for heat-treating at least one<br>
material being processed<br>
The invention relates to an apparatus for heat-treating<br>
at least one material being processed in a heat-<br>
treatment space of a heat-treatment container under a<br>
specific process-gas atmosphere of at least one process<br>
gas. An apparatus of this type is known for example<br>
from EP 0 662 247 Bl. In addition to the apparatus, a<br>
method for heat-treating a material being processed is<br>
presented.<br>
The material being processed known from EP 0 662 247 Bl<br>
is a multilayered element which is produced by applying<br>
a functional layer to a supporting layer (substrate).<br>
In order that the functional layer and/or the<br>
supporting layer have a desired physical (electrical,<br>
mechanical, etc.) and/or chemical property, processing<br>
of the material being processed or the layer and/or the<br>
supporting layer will be carried out. The processing<br>
comprises heat-treating the material being processed in<br>
the presence of a gas (process gas).<br>
For the heat treatment, the material being processed is<br>
arranged in a closed heat-treatment container made of<br>
graphite. During the heat treatment, the material<br>
being processed is exposed to a process gas with<br>
gaseous selenium. During the heat treatment, the<br>
material being processed takes up an amount of energy,<br>
with a partial amount of the amount of energy being<br>
supplied to each layer. The heat treatment takes<br>
place, for example, at a heating-up rate of 10°C/s. A<br>
halogen lamp is used as the energy source of the amount<br>
of energy. With the halogen lamp, the heat-treatment<br>
container made of graphite is irradiated with an<br>
electromagnetic radiation, and consequently the heat-<br><br>
treatment container is heated up. Graphite has a high<br>
absorptivity for the electromagnetic radiation in the<br>
spectral range of the halogen lamp. The amount of<br>
energy absorbed by the graphite is supplied to the<br>
material being processed by heat radiation and/or heat<br>
conduction. The heat-treatment container consequently<br>
acts as a secondary energy source or as an energy<br>
transmitter.<br>
Graphite has a high emissivity and a high thermal<br>
conductivity. When the material being processed lies<br>
on a base of the heat-treatment container, on an<br>
underside of the material being processed the amount of<br>
energy is supplied substantially by heat conduction.<br>
An upper side of the material being processed is<br>
supplied with an amount of energy by heat radiation,<br>
heat conduction and convection.<br>
The larger the material being processed (the larger the<br>
surface area thereof), the more varied the materials<br>
used in the material being processed (for example<br>
greatly differing coefficient of thermal expansion,<br>
different absorptivity for the amount of energy etc.)<br>
and the higher a heat-treatment rate (heating-up rate,<br>
cooling-down rate) , the more difficult it is to control<br>
a temperature homogeneity or temperature inhomogeneity<br>
in the material being processed. The temperature<br>
inhomogeneity may lead to mechanical stress in the<br>
material being processed, and consequently to<br>
destruction of the material being processed.<br>
A problem which arises from the cited prior art is use<br>
of, or occurrence of, toxic and/or corrosive gases in<br>
heat treatment (for example H2Se) .<br>
The object of the invention is to demonstrate how safe<br>
and reliable heat treatment can be carried out even in<br>
the presence of toxic and/or corrosive gases.<br><br>
To achieve the object, an apparatus is specified for<br>
heat-treating at least one material being processed in<br>
a heat-treatment space of a heat-treatment container<br>
under a specific process-gas atmosphere of at least one<br>
process gas. The apparatus is characterized in that<br>
the heat-treatment container in a heat-treatment<br>
chamber is arranged at a distance from the heat-<br>
treatment chamber, so that there is an intermediate<br>
space between the heat-treatment container and the<br>
heat-treatment chamber, and there is a means for<br>
producing in the intermediate space a further gas<br>
atmosphere of a further gas, different from the<br>
process-gas atmosphere.<br>
The	gas atmosphere (which can be set) is distinguished,<br>
for	example, by a defined partial pressure of a gas or<br>
gas	mixture (for example air) . It is also conceivable<br>
for	the gas atmosph-ere to be a vacuum.<br>
The intermediate space acts virtually as a buffer. The<br>
buffer helps to avoid process gas from being discharged<br>
into the surrounding area (atmosphere). For this<br>
purpose, in a special configuration, the intermediate<br>
space encloses the heat-treatment space.<br>
The means for producing the further gas atmosphere is,<br>
for example, a gas cylinder, which is in connection<br>
with the intermediate space via one or more openings.<br>
In a special configuration, the heat-treatment space<br>
and the intermediate space are connected to each other<br>
in such a way that a pressure gradient can be set<br>
between the heat-treatment space and the intermediate<br>
space.<br>
Purging gas history<br>
In a further configuration of the invention, there is<br>
at least one heat-treatment unit, with an energy source<br><br>
for making the material being processed take up an<br>
amount of energy.<br>
The energy source is, for example, a flat bank of<br>
heaters, which is formed by a heater array. The heater<br>
array comprises, for example, bar-shaped halogen lamps<br>
or heating bars arranged parallel to one another. Each<br>
halogen lamp may in this case be arranged in a shroud<br>
for protection from exposure to the (corrosive) process<br>
gas. An energy source of this type sends electro-<br>
magnetic radiation, in particular in the form of<br>
infrared radiation (thermal radiation, intensity<br>
maximum at a wavelength between 1 m and 2 |j.m) . An<br>
energy source in the form of a resistance heating<br>
element, which .emits thermal radiation, is also<br>
conceivable. An element of this type has, for example,<br>
graphite, silicon carbide and/or a metal alloy such as<br>
nickel chromium. Additionally conceivable is any<br>
electromagnetic radiation (microwaves, UV light) which<br>
can lead to a heating-up of the material being<br>
processed. In addition, heat conduction and convection<br>
are also conceivable for the heat treatment.<br>
In a further configuration of the invention, the heat-<br>
treatment unit has at least one means for cooling the<br>
material being processed. This is accompanied by the<br>
advantage that a process sequence comprising various<br>
method stages, with at least one heating-up phase and<br>
cooling-down phase, can be carried out with the aid of<br>
the same apparatus. The means for cooling is, in<br>
particular, a cooling gas and/or a cooling liquid. The<br>
cooling takes place with the aid of the cooling gas by<br>
convection, with, for example, a cooling gas that is<br>
cooler in comparison with the material being processed<br>
being directed past the material being processed. The<br>
cooling may also take place by heat conduction, with<br>
the material being processed being in contact with a<br>
cooling element with a corresponding coefficient of<br>
thermal conductivity. It is conceivable for the<br><br>
cooling element to be an enclosure of the heat-<br>
treatment unit with a hollow space through which the<br>
cooling gas or the cooling liquid can be directed.<br>
In a further configuration, at least one of the energy<br>
sources is arranged in a shroud which is at least<br>
partially transparent to the electromagnetic radiation<br>
of the energy source. For example, the shroud consists<br>
of quartz glass. The shroud is preferably vacuum-<br>
tight. With the aid of the shroud, the energy source<br>
can be protected from contact with a process gas. A<br>
further advantage of this configuration is that the<br>
energy source can be easily exchanged.<br>
In a special configuration, the shroud of the energy<br>
source has an optical filter for the electromagnetic<br>
radiation of the energy source. In this way, the<br>
optical property (absorptivity and transmissivity) of<br>
the shroud can be influenced in a specifically<br>
selective way.<br>
In a special configuration, at least one of the heat-<br>
treatment units has at least one transparent element,<br>
which has a specific absorption and a specific<br>
transmission for at least one of the electromagnetic<br>
radiations and which is arranged in the radiation field<br>
of the electromagnetic radiation between the energy<br>
source of the electromagnetic radiation and one of the<br>
materials being processed. The special advantage of<br>
the transparent element, in particular when heat-<br>
treating a multilayered element, is presented further<br>
below in connection with the configuration of the heat-<br>
treatment unit.<br>
In a special configuration, the shroud of the energy<br>
source, the heat-treatment container, the heat-<br>
treatment chamber, the transparent element and/or a<br>
reflective element have a material which is inert with<br>
respect to the gas. In particular, the material is<br><br>
selected from the group comprising glass, quartz glass,<br>
fused quartz, ceramic, glass ceramic and/or metal.<br>
These materials are inert, i.e. unreactive, with<br>
respect to a large number of process gases. Moreover,<br>
some materials, such as quartz glass or glass ceramic,<br>
have a low coefficient of thermal expansion. This is<br>
particularly important in the case of an apparatus<br>
which is made up of component parts of various<br>
materials. Within a permissible tolerance, one<br>
dimension of a component part can change. This ensures<br>
that the apparatus is not destroyed during the heat<br>
treatment on account of mechanical stress, i.e. is<br>
preserved. What is more, it makes it more easily<br>
possible to keep a check on a gas atmosphere. A<br>
possible gap of a component part or between the<br>
component parts of the apparatus scarcely changes<br>
during the heat treatment as a result of the low<br>
coefficient of thermal expansion of its component<br>
parts. An additional advantage results from use of a<br>
machinable material (for example machinable ceramic,<br>
glass ceramic or machinable fused quartz).<br>
It is described below how it is ensured by various<br>
configurations of the heat-treatment unit that<br>
materials being processed of a large surface area, in<br>
particular multilayer bodies with an unsymmetrical<br>
sequence of layers, can be heat-treated while<br>
controlling a temperature homogeneity of the material<br>
being processed.<br>
The material being processed of the heat-treatment unit<br>
is, for example, a multilayered element which has a<br>
first layer and at least one second layer. The heat<br>
treatment takes place by an amount of energy being<br>
taken up by the multilayered element, with a first<br>
partial amount of the amount of energy being taken up<br>
by the first layer and a second partial amount of the<br>
amount of energy being taken up by the second layer.<br>
The heat-treatment unit, which has at least one energy<br><br>
source of the amount of energy, is characterized in<br>
that the first layer is arranged between a first energy<br>
source and the second layer and the second layer is<br>
arranged between a second energy source and the first<br>
layer. At least one of the energy sources has an<br>
emission of a specific electromagnetic radiation with a<br>
radiation field, and at least one of the layers has a<br>
specific absorption for this electromagnetic radiation<br>
and is arranged in the radiation field. In addition,<br>
at least one transparent element, which has a specific<br>
transmission and a specific absorption for the<br>
electromagnetic radiation, is arranged in the radiation<br>
field between the energy source with the radiation<br>
field and the layer which has the absorption of the<br>
electromagnetic radiation and is arranged in the<br>
radiation field.<br>
The transparent element helps to heat up the layers of<br>
the multilayered element individually, i.e. to control,<br>
regulate and/or preset in a specifically selective way<br>
the partial amount of the amount of energy which the<br>
layer takes up. For example, an amount of energy is<br>
determined during the heat treatment with the aid of a<br>
control loop (see below). It is also conceivable for a<br>
presetting of the energy sources (for example energy<br>
density, type of energy, etc.) to be sufficient without<br>
an additional control loop. Individual heating-up of<br>
the layers of the multilayered element is possible even<br>
in the case of very high heating-up rates of from l°C/s<br>
to, for example, 100°C/s and more. The individual<br>
heating-up succeeds in keeping a mechanical stresses<br>
and a deformation of the multilayered element thereby<br>
caused under certain circumstances as small as possible<br>
during the heat treatment.<br>
The basis for this is the transparent element, which is<br>
optically partially transmitting (semitransparent).<br>
The transmission, which for a specific wavelength lies<br>
between 0.1 and 0.9, for example, allows the<br><br>
electromagnetic radiation described above to pass<br>
through the transparent element onto a layer. The<br>
layer can take up a corresponding amount of energy or<br>
partial amount of the amount of energy which is<br>
directly emitted by the energy source.<br>
The transparent element also has a certain absorption<br>
for the electromagnetic radiation. The energy which is<br>
thereby taken up may be emitted to a surrounding area<br>
in the form of heat radiation and/or heat conduction.<br>
In a special configuration, the apparatus for heat-<br>
treating a multilayered element has a transparent<br>
element which radiates and/or conducts heat in the<br>
direction of the multilayered element through the<br>
absorption of the electromagnetic radiation. In this<br>
way it is possible to heat-treat a layer by heat<br>
radiation and/or heat conduction.<br>
It is also conceivable for a first layer of the<br>
multilayered element, which transmits the heat<br>
radiation, to be heat-treated substantially only by<br>
heat conduction, while a second layer of the same<br>
multilayered element is heat-treated substantially by<br>
the heat radiation from the same transparent element.<br>
A first layer with a corresponding transmission is, for<br>
example, a layer of glass. If electromagnetic<br>
radiation of an energy source and/or a transparent<br>
element comes into contact with the glass element, a<br>
small proportion of the radiation (approximately 4%) is<br>
reflected. Most of the radiation (&gt; 90%) passes<br>
through the glass more or less unhindered and then<br>
impinges on a second layer of the multilayered element.<br>
This radiation can be absorbed there and leads to an<br>
amount of energy being taken up by the second layer.<br>
The glass layer cannot be heat-treated sufficiently<br>
quickly by radiation or heat radiation at a very high<br>
heating-up rate. By contrast, relatively quick heat<br>
treatment can be achieved by heat conduction if the<br>
transparent element is able to take up a partial amount<br><br>
of the amount of energy and transit it to the glass<br>
layer.<br><br>
The case in which the transparent element itself is a <br><br>
layer of the multilayered element is also conceivable. <br><br>
The transparent element can take up a partial amount of <br><br>
the amount of energy through absorption of part of the<br><br>
electromagnetic radiation and can pass on a further <br><br>
partial amount of the amount of energy by transmission,<br><br>
for take-up by a further layer.<br><br><br><br><br>
In a special configuration of the heat-treatment unit,<br>
one layer of the multilayered element is a supporting<br>
layer for at least one further layer of the<br>
multilayered element. The multilayered element has, in<br>
particular, an unsymmetrical sequence of layers. For<br>
example, the multilayered element comprises a<br>
supporting layer which is coated on one side.<br>
Individual layers of the multilayered element may also<br>
be arranged next to one another.<br>
In a special configuration, one layer of the<br>
multilayered element has a material which is selected<br>
from the group comprising glass, glass ceramic,<br>
ceramic, metal and/or plastic. Temperature-resistant<br>
plastic, such as Teflon, comes into consideration in<br>
particular as the plastic. One layer is, for example,<br>
a metal foil. The metal foil may also act as a<br>
supporting layer.<br>
The partial amount of the amount of energy which is<br>
taken up by a layer depends, for example, on the<br>
absorptivity, emissivity and/or reflectivity of the<br>
layer. It also depends, however, on the type of energy<br>
source and on the way in which the amount of energy is<br>
transmitted to the multilayered element or to a layer<br>
of the multilayered element.<br><br>
One of the energy sources of the heat-treatment unit<br>
is, for example, an energy source of thermal energy.<br>
The layer may be supplied with the thermal energy<br>
directly. Heat radiation, heat conduction and/or<br>
convection come into consideration here. In the case<br>
of heat radiation, the energy source may itself be a<br>
source of heat radiation. The heat radiation is, for<br>
example, electromagnetic radiation in the wavelength<br>
range between 0.7 and 4.5 µm. The corresponding layer<br>
is arranged in the radiation field of the energy<br>
source. The layer is impinged by the electromagnetic<br>
radiation of the energy source and at least partially<br>
absorbs the electromagnetic radiation.<br>
It is also possible, however, for a layer to be<br>
supplied with any desired energy, which is converted<br>
into thermal energy in the layer. For example, a layer<br>
is irradiated with high-energy UV light, which the<br>
layer absorbs. Absorption of a high-energy light<br>
quantum causes a molecule of the layer or the entire<br>
layer to become electronically excited. Energy which<br>
is thereby taken up can be converted into thermal<br>
energy.<br>
In addition to heat radiation and heat conduction, it<br>
is also possible for a layer or the entire element to<br>
be heat-treated by convection. In this case, a gas<br>
with a specific energy is directed past the layer, with<br>
the gas releasing the energy to the layer. Gas<br>
directed past may at the same time act as process gas.<br>
Moreover, a layer can also be cooled by heat conduction<br>
and/or convection. In this case, negative thermal<br>
energy is supplied to the layer. In this way, it is<br>
also possible to control the amounts of energy or the<br>
partial amounts of the amounts of energy and, for<br>
example, additionally influence the mechanical stresses<br>
in the multilayered element.<br><br>
In a special configuration, there is an energy<br>
transmitter for the transmission of the amount of<br>
energy to the multilayered element. The energy<br>
transmitter acts as a secondary energy source. The<br>
energy transmitter absorbs, for example,<br>
electromagnetic radiation of a primary energy source,<br>
for example a halogen lamp, from a higher energy band<br>
and converts this electromagnetic radiation into heat<br>
radiation, which is absorbed by the layer.<br>
The indirect and/or direct surronding area of the<br>
multilayered element may act as the energy transmitter<br>
during the heat treatment. It is conceivable for an<br>
energy transmitter to be arranged with the multilayered<br>
element for heat treatment in an interior space of a<br>
heat-treatment container. The energy transmitter may<br>
also be arranged outside the container, for example on<br>
a wall of the heat-treatment container or at a distance<br>
from the heat-treatment container. It is conceivable<br>
for the energy transmitter to be a coating of the heat-<br>
treatment container. The energy transmitter is, for<br>
example, a graphite film. It is even possible for the<br>
heat-treatment container itself to assume the function<br>
of an energy transmitter. A function of this type is<br>
provided, for example, in the case of a heat-treatment<br>
container made of graphite. Finally, the transparent<br>
element is nothing other than an energy transmitter.<br>
Similarly, in the case of energy transmission by<br>
convection, a gas acts as an energy transmitter.<br>
An amount of energy which is taken up by the<br>
multilayered element may differ not only from layer to<br>
layer but also within a layer. For example, during the<br>
heat treatment, an edge effect occurs in the<br>
multilayered element or in a layer of a multilayered<br>
element. An edge region of the layer is at a different<br>
temperature than an inner region of the layer. A<br>
lateral temperature gradient is established during the<br>
heat treatment. This takes place, for example,<br><br><br>
whenever a radiation field of the energy source is<br>
inhomogeneous. In this case, an energy density of the<br>
radiation field on a surface area to which the<br>
radiation is radiated is not identical everywhere. A<br>
lateral temperature; inhomogeneity may also be<br>
established when the radiation field is homogeneous, if<br>
a greater amount of jenergy per unit volume is absorbed<br>
on account of the j larger absorbing area per unit<br>
volume. To compensate for the temperature gradient, it<br>
is possible, for example, to use an energy source which<br>
comprises a multiplicity of subunits. Each subunit may<br>
be actuated separately, and in this way each amount of<br>
energy supplied from a subunit to a layer can be set<br>
separately. An example of an energy source of this<br>
type is an array or matrix of individual heating<br>
elements. An example of a heating element is a halogen<br>
lamp. The array or matrix can also be used to<br>
establish a lateral temperature gradient in the layer.<br>
In this way, it would be possible, for example, to<br>
produce permanent or transient deformation of the<br>
layered element in a specifically selective way. An<br>
array or matrix is of great advantage in particular for<br>
the heat treatment of a multilayered element in which<br>
layers lie next to one another.<br>
With respect to the energy source, it is advantageous<br>
if the energy source or the energy sources operate in a<br>
continuous mode. It is also conceivable, however, for<br>
the energy sources to make the amount of energy or the<br>
partial amounts of the amount of energy available to<br>
the layers in a cyclical and/or pulsed mode. An energy<br>
source of this type is, for example, an energy source<br>
with pulsed electromagnetic radiation. In this way, an<br>
amount of energy can be supplied to the layers at the<br>
same time or within a temporal sequence (for example<br>
alternately).<br><br>
The following properties of the energy source of<br>
electromagnetic radiation are particularly<br>
advantageous:<br>
•	The energy source has a homogeneous radiation field.<br>
•	A spectral intensity distribution of the energy<br>
source partially overlaps a spectral absorption of<br>
the layer, of the transparent element and/or of any<br>
heat-treatment container that may be present (see<br>
below).<br>
•	The energy source is corrosion-resistant and/or<br>
corrosion-protected in the presence of a process gas.<br>
•	The energy source has a high energy density, which is<br>
sufficient to allow a mass of the multilayered<br>
element (and, if appropriate, that of a heat-<br>
treatment container) to be heated up at a heating-up<br>
rate of over l°C/s.<br>
In a special configuration, the transparent element of<br>
the apparatus has at least one spacer, against which<br>
the multilayered element bears in order for a laterally<br>
homogeneous amount of energy to be taken up by the<br>
multilayered element. For example, the layer by means<br>
of which the multilayered element rests on the<br>
transparent element or the spacer is primarily heat-<br>
treated by homogeneous heat radiation. In this form,<br>
the spacer preferably has a material which has a low<br>
absorption for the electromagnetic radiation. A spacer<br>
projects, for example, beyond a surface of the<br>
transparent element by a few µm to mm.<br>
The layer resting on the spacers may also be primarily<br>
heat-treated by heat conduction. For this purpose, the<br>
spacers have, for example, a thermal conductivity which<br>
is necessary to achieve a corresponding heat-treatment<br>
rate. For energy transmission by heat conduction, it<br>
is also conceivable for the spacer to have a high<br>
absorption for an electromagnetic radiation of an<br><br>
energy source, with the electromagnetic radiation being<br>
additionally converted into thermal energy.<br>
In particular, the transparent element has a<br>
multiplicity of spacers. With a multiplicity of<br>
spacers which are arranged uniformly and in contact<br>
between the layer of the multilayered element and the<br>
transparent element, it is additionally possible to<br>
achieve homogenization of the lateral temperature<br>
distribution.<br>
In a special configuration, the transparent element<br>
and/or the spacer has a material which is selected from<br>
the group comprising glass and/or glass ceramic. Glass<br>
ceramic has various advantages:<br>
•	It can be used for heat treatment in a wide<br>
temperature range from, for example, 0°C to, for<br>
example, 700°C. Glass ceramic has, for example, a<br>
softening point which lies above the temperature<br>
range.<br>
•	It has a very low coefficient of thermal expansion.<br>
It is resistant to thermal shocks and is free of<br>
distortion in the abovementioned temperature range of<br>
heat treatment.<br>
•	It is chemically inert with respect to a large number<br>
of chemicals and has low permeability for these<br>
chemicals. A chemical of this type is, for example,<br>
the process gas to which a layer or the entire<br>
multilayered element is exposed during the heat<br>
treatment.<br>
•	It is optically partially transmissive in the<br>
spectral range of many energy sources for<br>
electromagnetic radiation, in particular in a<br>
wavelength range in which a radiation density of the<br>
energy sources is high. A radiation source of this<br>
type is, for example, a halogen lamp with a high<br>
radiation density of between 0.1 and 4.5 |µm.<br><br>
Glass, in particular quartz glass, are likewise<br>
conceivable as a material for the transparent element.<br>
The advantage of glass is that it can be used at high<br>
temperatures of up to 1200°C. These materials exhibit<br>
a high transmission and low absorption in the spectral<br>
range of an energy source in the form of a halogen<br>
lamp. The light passes through the transparent element<br>
substantially unhindered and reaches a layer with a<br>
corresponding absorption for the electromagnetic<br>
radiation, the layer taking up an amount of energy and<br>
being heated. The transparent element is scarcely<br>
heated by the radiation.<br>
In one process application it is possible for material<br>
of the heated layer to evaporate and be deposited on a<br>
relatively cold surface of the transparent element. To<br>
prevent this, it is possible to ensure that the<br>
transparent element is heated to a necessary<br>
temperature during the heat treatment. This is<br>
achieved by transmitting an amount of energy to the<br>
transparent element by heat conduction and/or<br>
convection. Electromagnetic radiation which the<br>
transparent element absorbs is also conceivable. It is<br>
conceivable for the transparent element to have a<br>
coating which absorbs a certain part of the<br>
electromagnetic radiation. The energy taken up as a<br>
result can be passed on to the transparent element made<br>
of glass or quartz glass. In this form, the<br>
transparent element, comprising the glass element with<br>
the coating, is optically partially transmissive and<br>
can be used to transmit energy to the multilayered<br>
element both by heat radiation and by heat conduction.<br>
In a special configuration, at least one layer of the<br>
multilayered element is in contact with a process gas.<br>
It is also conceivable for the entire multilayered<br>
element to be exposed to the process gas. An inert gas<br>
(molecular nitrogen or noble gas) comes into<br>
consideration for example as the process gas. The<br><br><br>
process gas does not react with a material of the<br>
layer. However, a process gas which does react with a<br>
material of the layer is also conceivable. Under the<br>
action of the process gases, the functional layer<br>
forms. For example, the process gas has an oxidizing<br>
or reducing effect on a material of the layer.<br>
Possible process gases for this are oxygen, chlorine,<br>
hydrogen, elemental selenium, sulfur or a hydride. It<br>
may also be an etching process gases such as HCL or the<br>
like. Further examples of the process gas are H2S and<br>
H2Se, which are used in the production of a thin-film<br>
solar cell (see below) . Finally, all gases or gas<br>
mixtures which react with a material of a layer in a<br>
corresponding way are conceivable.<br>
It is advantageous if the layer is exposed to a defined<br>
process-gas atmosphere. The defined process-gas<br>
atmosphere comprises, for example, a partial pressure<br>
of the process gas or gases during the heat treatment.<br>
It is also conceivable, for example, for a layer or the<br>
multilayered element to be in contact with a vacuum for<br>
heat treatment.<br>
A defined process-gas atmosphere can be achieved, for<br>
example, by directing the process gas past the layer at<br>
a specific velocity. In this case, a process gas with<br>
various partial pressures can act on the layer in the<br>
course of the heat treatment. It is also conceivable<br>
for various process gases to be successively in contact<br>
with the layer of the layered element.<br>
Preferably, at least the layer which is in contact with<br>
the process gas is enclosed. This is achieved, for<br>
example, by sheathing the layer, it being possible for<br>
the sheathing to be secured to the supporting layer.<br>
The sheathing is filled with the process gas before or<br>
during the heat treatment. The process gas is in this<br>
case concentrated on a surface of the layer of which<br>
the properties are to be influenced by the process gas.<br><br><br>
In this way it is possible to prevent a surrounding<br>
area from being contaminated by the process gas. This<br>
is important in particular when using a corrosive<br>
and/or toxic process gas. Furthermore, it is possible<br>
to operate with a stoichiometric amount of process gas<br>
necessary for conversion of the layer. There is no<br>
unnecessary consumption of process gas.<br>
In a special configuration of the invention, the<br>
multilayered element is arranged in a heat-treatment<br>
container. In this case, at least one container wall<br>
of the heat-treatment container has a transparent<br>
element. The heat-treatment container has the<br>
advantage that it automatically forms the sheathing of<br>
the layer or the entire multilayered element. The<br>
sheathing does not need to be secured to the<br>
multilayered element. In the case of a closable heat-<br>
treatment container, the process-gas atmosphere can be<br>
set in a specifically selective and easy way. For<br>
example, the heat-treatment container offers a<br>
sufficiently large volume for the process gas required<br>
during the heat treatment. If the heat treatment<br>
requires a homogeneous and reproducible distribution of<br>
the process gas over a layer, a gas discharge from the<br>
heat-treatment container can also be set in a<br>
specifically selective way. This may be necessary, for<br>
example, whenever the heat treatment is carried out at<br>
a very high heating-up rate. In this case, the process<br>
gas expands. If the heat-treatment container does not<br>
withstand the gas pressure thereby occurring, the heat-<br>
treatment container is deformed or even destroyed.<br>
However, deformation should be prevented, for example,<br>
if the multilayered element rests on the base of the<br>
heat-treatment container. Deformation of the heat-<br>
treatment container may lead to a lateral temperature<br>
inhomogeneity in the multilayered element.<br>
Moreover, the heat-treatment container may be a means<br>
for transporting the multilayered element during heat<br><br><br>
treatment. The heat-treatment container has the<br>
advantage that it is not possible, for example, to rule<br>
out the possibility of a layer (supporting layer or<br>
substrate) of glass breaking during the heat treatment.<br>
In the event of such a substrate breaking, the broken<br>
material can be easily removed from the heat-treatment<br>
units or from the apparatus for heat treatment. This<br>
contributes to stabilizing the heat-treatment process.<br>
In a particular configuration, the container wall of<br>
the heat-treatment container which has the transparent<br>
element is a cover and/or a base of the heat-treatment<br>
container. For example, one layer of the multilayered<br>
element rests directly on the transparent element of<br>
the base. As described above, the transparent element<br>
may have spacers. The cover likewise has the<br>
transparent element, which, for example, is not in<br>
contact with the multilayered element or a layer of the<br>
multilayered element. In this way, the layer of the<br>
multilayered element which rests on the base can be<br>
heated by heat conduction, the layer facing the cover<br>
can be heated by heat radiation. The layer facing the<br>
cover can easily be exposed to a process gas.<br>
In a further configuration, the base and/or the cover<br>
of the heat-treatment container is formed by in each<br>
case at least one multilayered element. In this case,<br>
the layer of the multilayered element which, for<br>
example, is intended to come into contact with a<br>
process gas is directed into the interior space of the<br>
heat-treatment container. This solution is possible if<br>
the multilayered element or the layers of the<br>
multilayered element have a low coefficient of thermal<br>
expansion and/or the heat-treatment rate is low. For a<br>
high heat-treatment rate, the multilayered element<br>
advantageously has a supporting layer with a high<br>
coefficient of thermal conductivity. The supporting<br>
layer is directed outward. For example, here the<br><br>
supporting layer is a transparent element as described<br>
above.<br>
In a special configuration, the heat-treatment<br>
container, the transparent element and/or the energy<br>
transmitter have a material which is inert with respect<br>
to a process gas. Moreover, it is advantageous for an<br>
entire heat-treatment process area to be inert with<br>
respect to the process gas used. The process area also<br>
includes, for example, the energy source (primary<br>
energy source).<br>
The material is selected according to the process gas.<br>
Glass, glass ceramic and ceramic are conceivable, for<br>
example. A fiber-reinforced material, such as carbon-<br>
fiber-reinforced graphite can similarly be used. A<br>
material such as SiC, which has a high coefficient of<br>
thermal conductivity, is also conceivable. The heat-<br>
treatment container may consist of a metal or an alloy.<br>
A plastic which is resistant up to a specific<br>
temperature is similarly possible.<br>
In addition to being chemically inert with respect to<br>
the process gas, the following properties are of<br>
advantage for the material of the heat-treatment<br>
container:<br>
•	The material of the heat-treatment container is free<br>
from distortion under the heat-treatment conditions.<br>
It is also resistant to temperature shocks. This is<br>
the case in particular whenever it has a low<br>
coefficient of thermal expansion.<br>
•	The thermal softening point of the material of the<br>
heat-treatment container lies above a maximum<br>
temperature of the heat treatment.<br>
•	The heat-treatment container exhibits a low or<br>
defined permeability with respect to a process gas.<br><br>
In a special configuration, there is a device for<br>
detecting a dimension of at least one physical<br>
parameter of the apparatus and/or a heat-treatment unit<br>
that is dependent on the heat treatment, for<br>
controlling the first and second partial amounts of the<br>
amount of energy.<br>
One conceivable parameter is an absorption,<br>
transmission and/or reflection property of a layer.<br>
The dimension of the parameter is the value of the<br>
parameter. For example, a wavelength of a maximum<br>
absorption may depend on the temperature. The dimension<br>
of the parameter would in this case be the<br>
corresponding wavelength.<br>
In particular, the parameter is a temperature of the<br>
multilayered element. In this case, the dimension is a<br>
value of the temperature. The detection of the<br>
temperature of a layer of the multilayered element, of<br>
the transparent element and/or of the heat-treatment<br>
container or a wall of the heat-treatment container is<br>
also conceivable. During the heat treatment, it is<br>
always possible for at least one parameter of the<br>
multilayered element and/or of a layer to be detected.<br>
For example, the partial amount of the amount of energy<br>
which is taken up by the layer is increased or<br>
decreased on the basis of the detected temperature of a<br>
layer. In this way, a temperature inhomogeneity or a<br>
temperature gradient in the direction of the thickness<br>
of the multilayered element can be avoided. This<br>
temperature inhomogeneity can, however, also be<br>
increased, should this be necessary.<br>
For example, the device for detecting the temperature<br>
is be a pyrometer, which is directed at the layer. The<br>
pyrometer detects, for example, the heat radiation<br>
which is emitted by the layer. The temperature of the<br>
layer can be concluded on the basis of the heat<br>
radiation. A temperature detector which is connected<br><br>
to the layer and the temperature of which is controlled<br>
by heat conduction is also conceivable.<br>
It is also conceivable for the temperature of the layer<br>
or of the multilayered element not to be measured<br>
directly but indirectly. For example, a pyrometer is<br>
directed at the heat-treatment container in which the<br>
multilayered element is heat-treated. The temperature<br>
of the heat-treatment container may be influenced by<br>
the temperature of the multilayered element. The<br>
temperature of the layer of the multilayered element is<br>
concluded on the basis of the temperature of the heat-<br>
treatment container. The amount of energy or the<br>
partial amount of the amount of energy is controlled on<br>
the basis of the measured temperature of the heat-<br>
treatment container. For this purpose, for example, a<br>
kind of "calibration measurement" is to be carried out<br>
prior to the heat treatment, representing a<br>
relationship between the measured temperature of the<br>
heat-treatment container and the actual temperature of<br>
the layer or of the layered element. The "calibration<br>
measurement" indicates a desired value of the<br>
temperature. The actual value is detected. A<br>
comparison between the desired value and the actual<br>
value supplies a controlled variable for controlling<br>
the amounts of energy.<br>
The detection (and also the control of the partial<br>
amounts of the amount of energy) takes place in<br>
particular with a local resolution in the direction of<br>
the thickness of the multilayered element and with a<br>
temporal resolution within the time frame of the heat<br>
treatment. For example, the multilayered element is<br>
heated up at a heat-treating rate of 25°C/s. In that<br>
case, both the detection and the control of the partial<br>
amounts of the amount of energy would take place so<br>
quickly that a temperature difference between the<br>
layers of the multilayered element during the heat<br><br>
treatment remains below a prescribed maximum, for<br>
example.<br>
The temperature inhomogeneity in the direction of the<br>
thickness may, in combination with a transient<br>
deformation of the multilayered element, also lead to a<br>
lateral temperature inhomogeneity in the multilayered<br>
element. Lateral means, for example, within a layer of<br>
the multilayered element perpendicular to the direction<br>
of the thickness. For example, the multilayered<br>
element rests on a base of graphite. The supply or<br>
take-up of the amount of energy by the layer of the<br>
multilayered element resting on the base takes place<br>
through heat conduction. A temperature inhomogeneity<br>
in the direction of the thickness may cause a transient<br>
deformation of the multilayered element in the form of<br>
bending of the multilayered element. In this case, the<br>
contact between the multilayered element and the base<br>
of the heat-treatment container that is necessary for<br>
the heat conduction is partially detached. As a<br>
consequence of this, there is a lateral temperature<br>
inhomogeneity of the resting layer or of the<br>
multilayered element. It is therefore particularly<br>
advantageous if, for the detection of the parameter<br>
(and control of the amounts of energy), there is a<br>
local resolution not only in the direction of the<br>
thickness but also laterally.<br>
In a special configuration, the parameter is a<br>
deformation of the multilayered element. The<br>
occurrence of a temperature inhomogeneity may cause<br>
deformation. For example, the multilayered element is<br>
concavely curved.<br>
The multilayered element rests on the base of, for<br>
example, a heat-treatment container. Concave<br>
deformation has the effect that a distance between the<br>
resting surface and the multilayered element forms in<br>
the edge region of the multilayered element. A laser<br><br>
interferometry or laser light reflection device can be<br>
used, for example, to detect a dimension of such a<br>
deformation. The control of the amounts of energy<br>
takes place on the basis of the dimension. It is<br>
advantageous if the dimension is detected in an early<br>
stage of the deformation and it is possible to react<br>
quickly to it.<br>
For an abovementioned device for detecting a dimension<br>
of a parameter which is dependent on the heat treatment<br>
with the aid of an optical device (for example a<br>
laser) , it is advantageous if the layer which is to be<br>
examined is accessible for light from the optical<br>
device and a detection signal can be unequivocally<br>
assigned to the parameter to be detected. The<br>
wavelength of a laser should, for example, differ<br>
sufficiently from the heat radiation of the<br>
multilayered element. If the apparatus is equipped<br>
with a heat-treatment container, it would be<br>
advantageous if the transparent element is sufficiently<br>
transparent to the light of the laser.<br>
With the aid of the apparatus, it is also possible to<br>
achieve a desired deformation of the multilayered<br>
element. For this purpose, it may also be appropriate<br>
to monitor the deformation during the heat treatment in<br>
the manner described above. For example, it is<br>
possible to produce a curved thin-film solar cell. To<br>
achieve specifically selective deformation, the<br>
multilayered element is, for example, laid on a<br>
corresponding mold or mask. The mold or mask may<br>
directly be an energy source. The multilayered element<br>
is heated to above a softening point of the supporting<br>
layer. As a consequence of this, the multilayered<br>
element adopts a shape which corresponds to that of the<br>
mask or mold. The mask is, for example, integrated in<br>
a base of the heat-treatment container. The mask could<br>
be, for example, the transparent element.<br><br>
To achieve the object, in addition to the apparatus<br>
there is specified a method for heat-treating a<br>
material being processed in a heat-treatment space of a<br>
heat-treatment container under a specific process-gas<br>
atmosphere of a process gas. The method comprises the<br>
following method steps: a) producing the intermediate<br>
space between the heat-treatment container having the<br>
heat-treatment space with the material being processed<br>
and the heat-treatment chamber, b) producing the<br>
process gas atmosphere in the heat-treatment space and<br>
a gas atmosphere of a further gas in the intermediate<br>
space and c) heat-treating the material being<br>
processed.<br>
The intermediate space with the further gas, for<br>
example a purging gas, acts as a buffer, so that the<br>
process gas which is located in the heat-treatment<br>
space cannot reach the heat-treatment chamber, or only<br>
in a rarefied form. Contamination or corrosion of the<br>
heat-treatment chamber can be prevented. The selection<br>
of the material of the heat-treatment chamber is<br>
virtually independent of the process gas. The<br>
intermediate space can be filled once with the purging<br>
gas. It is also conceivable for a continuous stream of<br>
purging gas to be passed through the intermediate<br>
space, removing from the intermediate space process gas<br>
possibly escaping from the stack body. A removal of<br>
escaping process gas is also achieved by a pressure<br>
gradient being established from the hollow space of the<br>
stack body to the intermediate space.<br>
In a special configuration, a specific temperature of<br>
the heat-treatment chamber, the gas pressure in the<br>
heat-treatment space and/or the gas pressure in the<br>
intermediate space are set. In this case, the gas<br>
pressure in the heat-treatment space is influenced in<br>
particular into the gas pressure in the intermediate<br>
space [sic].<br><br>
According to a special configuration, a pressure<br>
gradient is set between the heat-treatment space and<br>
the intermediate space. This is achieved in particular<br>
by the heat-treatment chamber being arranged in a<br>
 shroud.<br>
In a further configuration, the heat treatment<br>
comprises at least one heating-up and/or at least one<br>
cooling-down process. In this case, it is possible in<br>
I particular to run through a plurality of heating-up and<br>
cooling-down phases.<br>
According to a further material being processed, a<br>
multilayered element with a layer and at least one<br>
further layer is used.<br>
In this case, a multilayered element with a layer which<br>
has copper, indium, gallium and/or selenium is used in<br>
particular. A supporting layer of the multilayered<br>
element is made in particular of glass and/or metal.<br>
In a special configuration, a process gas which is<br>
selected from the group comprising H2S, H2Se, H2, He<br>
and/or N2 is selected.<br>
In particular, a further gas, which is selected from<br>
the group comprising N2 and/or noble gas, is used.<br>
The method is suitable in particular for producing a<br>
photovoltaic thin-film chalcopyrite absorber of a solar<br>
cell and/or of a solar module.<br>
The process-gas atmosphere and the further gas<br>
atmosphere may be produced before, during or after the<br>
heat treatment. The materials being processed can in<br>
this case be brought simultaneously into contact with a<br>
plurality of process gases (gas mixture) . It is also<br>
conceivable for the material being processed to be<br>
brought successively into contact with different<br><br>
process gases and/or purging gases. Consequently, a<br>
variable process gas profile (temporal sequence of<br>
different partial pressures of the process gas or<br>
gases) is possible. In this way, it is possible, for<br>
example, to use both oxidizing and reducing process<br>
gases, or to introduce a dopant into the material being<br>
processed in a specifically selective way.<br>
In a special configuration, there is a shroud of the<br>
heat-treatment container, so that there is a buffer<br>
space for gas between the intermediate space and the<br>
heat-treatment space.<br>
In the intermediate space between the heat-treatment<br>
chamber and the heat-treatment container, a gas<br>
pressure of a purging gas that is greater than the gas<br>
pressure in the buffer space is produced. For this<br>
purpose, gas outlet openings are preferably provided in<br>
the shroud, led to the outside for example via a<br>
manifold pipeline through the intermediate space and<br>
through the heat-treatment chamber, and directed there<br>
for example into a gas disposal unit. Consequently,<br>
the pressure prevailing in the buffer space of the<br>
shroud is approximately the same as that in the gas<br>
disposal unit (for example atmospheric pressure). The<br>
effect of this arrangement can be referred to as gap<br>
counterflow purging, which serves the purpose of<br>
opposing the stream of process gas diffusing out of the<br>
heat-treatment space with a counteracting stream of<br>
inert gas at a gap of a lead-through in the shroud, for<br>
example at an assembly gap of a component of the<br>
shroud, with the aim of preventing condensation of<br>
process gases on the walls of the heat-treatment<br>
chamber or corrosion of the walls of the heat-treatment<br>
chamber. The latter can also be achieved, moreover, by<br>
suitable coating of the walls of the heat-treatment<br>
chamber.<br><br>
The gap counterflow purging works on the following<br>
principle: the heat-treatment container filled with the<br>
process gas is arranged in the shroud. It is not<br>
possible to rule out the possibility of the process gas<br>
5 getting into the buffer space of the shroud.<br>
The buffer space of the shroud and the intermediate<br>
space between the heat-treatment container and the<br>
heat-treatment chamber are connected by gaps or<br>
10 openings. A pressure gradient from the intermediate<br>
space to the buffer space is built up as a result of<br>
the choice of the gas pressures. This is achieved, for<br>
example, by extracting the purging gas from the buffer<br>
space by suction and/or introducing the purging gas<br>
15 into the intermediate space and a resultant pressure<br>
build-up with respect to the pressure of the buffer<br>
space, which may, as described above, be in contact<br>
with the surrounding area of the heat-treatment<br>
apparatus. This produces a stream of purging gas from<br>
20 the intermediate space to the buffer space. The<br>
process gas does not reach the chamber wall of the<br>
heat-treatment chamber. In this way, a temperature of<br>
the heat-treatment chamber, the gas pressure of the<br>
buffer space and/or the gas pressure of the<br>
25 intermediate space are set in particular during the<br>
heat treatment.<br>
In a special configuration, a multilayered element with<br>
a layer and at least one further layer is used as the<br>
30 material being processed and/or further material being<br>
processed.<br>
In this case, the heat treatment takes place by an<br>
amount of energy being taken up by the multilayered<br>
35 element, with a first partial amount of the amount of<br>
energy being taken up by the first layer and a second<br>
partial amount of the amount of energy being taken up<br>
by the second layer, with at least one energy source<br>
being used for supplying the amount of energy to the<br><br>
multilayered element. In this case, an apparatus<br>
described above is used in particular. The method<br>
steps are: arranging the multilayered element between a<br>
first and at least one second energy source, so that<br>
the first layer is arranged between the first energy<br>
source and the second layer and the second layer is<br>
arranged between the second energy source and the first<br>
layer, with at least one energy source of a specific<br>
electromagnetic radiation with a radiation field being<br>
used as the energy source, and at least one of the<br>
layers absorbing the electromagnetic radiation and<br>
being arranged in the radiation field of the energy<br>
source, and arranging a transparent element in the<br>
radiation field of the energy source between the energy<br>
source and the layer which lies in the radiation field<br>
of the energy source and absorbs the specific<br>
electromagnetic radiation, and heat treatment of the<br>
multilayered element.<br>
In a special configuration, the transparent element<br>
absorbs a specific amount of energy and supplies the<br>
amount of energy to the layer. In a further<br>
configuration, detecting a dimension of a physical<br>
parameter of the multilayered element that is dependent<br>
on the heat treatment is carried out for controlling<br>
the take-up of the amount of energy during the heat<br>
treatment and controlling the first and second partial<br>
amounts of the amount of energy. In a special<br>
configuration, the transparent element supplies the<br>
layer with the amount of energy by heat conduction<br>
and/or heat radiation.<br>
In a special configuration, a multilayered element with<br>
a layer which has copper, indium, gallium and/or<br>
selenium is used. In particular, a multilayered<br>
element with a supporting layer made of glass and/or<br>
metal is used. The supporting layer may, for its part,<br>
have a coating (for example a metal layer on a glass<br>
plate). A gas which is selected from the group<br><br>
comprising H2S, H2Se, H2, He and N2 is used as the<br>
process gas. The method serves in particular for<br>
producing a photovoltaic thin-film chalcopyrite<br>
absorber of a solar cell and/or of a solar module. In<br>
the case of the solar module, there are a multiplicity<br>
of individual solar cells connected in series. The<br>
glass is preferably soda-lime glass. The corresponding<br>
layer acts as a supporting layer. On the supporting<br>
layer, a molybdenum layer is applied as an electrode<br>
and, over the molybdenum layer, a functional layer is<br>
applied, that is a copper-indium-gallium-sulfoselenide<br>
(CIGSSe) semiconductor layer. A thickness of the<br>
layered element, comprising the glass element and<br>
semiconductor layer, is typically 2 to 4 mm, with a<br>
molybdenum layer of approximately 0.5 µm and a<br>
semiconductor layer of approximately 3 µm.	The<br>
specified range for the thickness of the multilayered<br>
element is not to be used exclusively. A limiting<br>
factor is a capability for producing a large substrate<br>
which is as planar as possible, and consequently can be<br>
processed with the described apparatus or with the<br>
described method to form a multilayered element.<br>
To sum up, the following advantages are obtained with<br>
the invention:<br>
•	A material being processed can be heat-treated in any<br>
desired process-gas atmosphere. In particular, a<br>
toxic and/or corrosive process gas can be used.<br>
Condensations of a process substance on the chamber<br>
walls can be avoided.<br>
•	A heating-up and cooling-down profile can be variably<br>
set up.<br>
•	A material being processed in the	form of	a<br>
multilayered element of a large surface	area with	an<br>
unsymmetrical layer structure (for	example	a<br>
multilayered element with a single	layer on	a<br><br><br>
supporting layer) can be heat-treated at a high heat-<br>
treating rate of over l°C/s.<br>
•	The layers of the multilayered element may in this<br>
case have a greatly differing coefficient of thermal<br>
conductivity and/or greatly differing emissivity.<br>
•	A temporal and local resolution of the detection and<br>
the control of a dimension of a parameter dependent<br>
on the heat treatment allows heat treatment to be<br>
conducted particularly safely. For example, it is<br>
possible to react to a change in a property of the<br>
material being processed (for example emissivity or<br>
absorptivity) during the heat treatment and set the<br>
process parameters (pressure, temperature, energy<br>
density, etc.) to it.<br>
•	Heat treatment to near a softening point of a<br>
supporting layer of the material being processed is<br>
possible.<br>
•	In the case of heat treatment beyond the softening<br>
point of the supporting layer, a permanent<br>
deformation of the multilayered element is possible.<br>
•	A defined heat-treatment area with a defined process-<br>
gas atmosphere can be created. Various process gases<br>
with various partial pressure profiles can be set<br>
simultaneously or successively before, during and/or<br>
after the processing.<br>
•	All the method steps necessary for the processing can<br>
be carried out with a single apparatus.<br>
An apparatus for heat-treating a material being<br>
processed and a corresponding method for this are<br>
represented on the basis of several exemplary<br>
embodiments and the associated figures. The figures<br><br><br>
are schematic and do not represent illustrations that<br>
are true to scale.<br>
Figure 1 shows a cross section from the side of an<br>
apparatus for heat-treating at least one<br>
material being processed.<br>
Figure 2 shows a method of heat-treating a plurality<br>
of materials being processed.<br>
The starting point is an apparatus 1 for heat-treating<br>
a material being processed 33 (figure 1). The material<br>
being processed 33 is arranged in a heat-treatment<br>
space 16 of a heat-treatment container 11. The heat-<br>
treatment container 11 lies in a shroud 12, so that<br>
there is a buffer space 15 between the shroud 12 and<br>
the heat-treatment container 11. Together with the<br>
shroud 12, the heat-treatment container is arranged in<br>
an evacuable heat-treatment chamber, so that there is a<br>
distance 18 between the heat-treatment container 11 and<br>
the heat-treatment chamber 13. The material being<br>
processed is arranged in the container in the method<br>
step 21, after which an appropriate process gas<br>
atmosphere 17 and further gas atmosphere 191 are<br>
created in the heat-treatment space 16 and in the<br>
intermediate space 14 (and possibly in the buffer space<br>
11) (step 22) . For producing the further gas<br>
atmosphere, there is a closable opening 19 in the heat-<br>
treatment chamber. The heat treatment takes place in<br>
process step 23.<br><br>
