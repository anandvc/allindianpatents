The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR PROVIDING QUALITY OF SERVICE ASSURANCE IN<br>
WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to the field of wireless communication technologies, and more particularly to a method and a system for providing a Quality of Service (QoS) assurance in a wireless communication system.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0002] In an existing wireless communication system, such as Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) system and Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) system, it is often necessary to provide different quality of service assurances for different users or for individual service flows of the user so as to provide differentiated services to users.<br>
[0003] With the development of wireless communication technologies, the World Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMax) system is becoming a new wireless broadband access technology drawing great attention in wireless communication systems. The WiMax system primarily includes an Access Service Network (ASN), a Connectivity Service Network (CSN) and a Mobile Subscriber Station (MSS). The ASN is a set of network functions that provide radio access to a WiMax subscriber. The ASN includes network elements such as Base Station (BS) and ASN Gate Way (ASN GW). One ASN may be shared by multiple CSNs. The CSN is configured to provide Internet Protocol (IP) connectivity services to WiMax subscribers. The CSN may include an Authentication Authorization Accounting Server (AAA Server) function.<br>
[0004] The same as in the WCDMA system and the CDMA system, in the WiMax system, it is necessary to provide the users with respective QoS assurances. In the existing WiMax system, only part of air interface information is defined while end-to-end QoS parameters and processes over the whole WiMax access network have not yet been defined. In other words, there is no QoS parameter defined for WiMax and no corresponding processing procedure is provided.<br>
[0005] Therefore, it is impossible to provide different QoS assurances for different users in the existing WiMax system, i.e. it is impossible to provide different levels of QoS for users or for individual service flows of the user.<br><br>

complexity, cross-operator subscription, latency and packet loss rate, user class and the like, so as to provide more appropriate QoS parameters to the WiMax system.

Detailed Description of the Embodiments<br>
[0037] In the present invention, corresponding QoS parameters may be selectively defined for the properties of the WiMax system. End to end QoS negotiation may be implemented in the WiMax system according to the corresponding QoS parameters. The present invention sets forth QoS parameters and negotiation procedures for WiMax. The defined QoS parameters include some parameters that have not been used in the existing wireless networks. The<br><br>
implementation of the present invention enables an end to end QoS assurance in the WiMax system.<br>
[0038] The parameters proposed in the present invention may be used in end to end QoS negotiation for ASN GW, BS, MSS and CSN as well as AAA server.<br>
[0039] The WiMax QoS parameters proposed in the present invention are constituted by two parts, i.e. the QoS parameters defined on the basis of 802.16e (wireless access standard) and the QoS parameters specially defined for the present invention. Hereunder these two parts of QoS parameters will be described respectively.<br>
[0040]   The WiMax QoS parameters defined on the basis of 802.16e (wireless access standard) include Traffic handling priority having a value in a range of 0-7, Maximum Sustained Traffic Rate (kbps), Maximum Traffic Burst (Byte), Minimum Reserved Traffic Rate (kbps), Tolerated Jitter, Maximum Latency and Maximum Service Data Unit (SDU) size.<br>
[0041] The WiMax QoS parameters specially defined for the present invention include User priority, SDU error ratio, Residual bit error ratio, Delivery of erroneous SDUs, Lossless Relocation indicator and Traffic class. The Traffic class may be conversational, streaming, interactive and background, and may be extended as required. These specially defined WiMax QoS parameters may also be defined in other ways with the same conception.<br>
[0042] The WiMax QoS parameters proposed in the present invention will be described hereunder in detail to make the parameters specially defined for the present invention more easily to be understood.<br>
[0043]   (I) User Priority, i.e. user differentiated level<br>
[0044] This parameter is used to enable various sections on a WiMax end to end bearer to identify different users. Important users have a high priority. For instance, it is necessary for the logic entities such as, but not limited to, Admission Control entity, Source Distribution entity and QoS Executing (schedule, buffering, and the like) entity to take the user differentiated level into account. Moreover, the User Priority, as a QoS parameter, needs to be sent to ASN GW and especially BS.<br>
[0045] This parameter may be presented in 8 bits and have a value in a range of [0, 127]. In this embodiment, this parameter preferably has a value of 1, 2 or 3. This parameter is defined in a way similar to that for defining Allocation/Retention Priority in 3GPP 23.107.<br>
[0046]   A user may subscribe to multiple services and the QoS Profile of each subscribed<br><br>
service may have different user differentiated levels. For instance, a user A may subscribe to a video service as an important user while subscribe to a conversational service as an ordinary user. Therefore, although the user differentiated level is defined by a user, the User Priorities of the user may be identical or different for all his subscribed services.<br>
[0047] In the present invention, the BS is required to, as a QoS Enforcement Point (EP), be directly responsible for the QoS enforcement of air interface and exactly know the user differentiated level. The ASN GW, including Decision Point (DP) and Enforcement Point (EP), is also required to exactly know the user differentiated level when the QoS EP of the ASN GW is applied to the service flow.<br>
[0048] It is also set forth in the present invention that a user in WiMax may have the same User Priority or different User Priorities for all services that the user subscribes to.<br>
[0049]   (II) Lossless Relocation indicator<br>
[0050] The proposal of the lossless relocation indicator in the present invention means that lossless relocation is not necessary in every case, but an optional requirement depending on certain service demands, user levels and network conditions. The relocation or handover performance includes parameters such as whether is lossless under the various conditions, which service flow is lossless, how is lossless under the various conditions, what level of lossless under the various conditions and the like.<br>
[0051] Lossless relocation means that when a handover between BSs occurs, the Old BS (the original base station, i.e. the serving base station before the handover) forwards to a New BS downlink data packets that have not yet been delivered, so as to assure the continuity of the downlink data packets. As an example of the principle of lossless relocation applied to the SRNS Relocation procedure in 3GPP, an Old Radio Network Controller (Old RNC) forwards downlink data packets that have not yet been delivered to a Target RNC. In WiMax, lossless relocation means that when a handover between BSs occurs or a BS is changed due to a handover procedure, the Old BS forwards downlink data packets that have not yet been delivered to a New BS (the serving base station after the handover). The principle of lossless relocation may also be used in other procedures in WiMax with a similar conception.<br>
[0052] Referring to Figure 1, when a handover from a serving base station 111 and an access service network gateway 121 to a serving base station 112 and an access service network gateway 122 occurs, the serving base station 111 forwards downlink data packets that have not yet been delivered to the serving base station 112. In this embodiment, the access service<br><br>
network gateway 121 and the access service network gateway 122 connect to the same connectivity service network 130.<br>
[0053] For WiMax, the present invention takes whether to support lossless relocation as a QoS parameter, and the present invention proposes that lossless relocation may be used in differentiated services for users. The present invention proposes that the lossless relocation does not make sense or makes little sense relatively in some cases, and that it may be determined whether a user subscribes to lossless relocation through collectively considering network complexity, cross-operator subscription, latency and packet loss rate, user class and the like.<br>
[0054] In the implementation of the present invention, the following cases may be taken into account to configure an appropriate lossless relocation indicator.<br>
[0055] 1. Not all services need lossless relocation. Some services, for which packet loss to a certain level is permitted, may be configured to not need lossless relocation.<br>
[0056] 2. In some cases such as a real-time video stream, it is not necessary for downlink data packets to wait for data packets forwarded with lossless relocation, because there may be a higher requirement in real-time than that in packet loss rate.<br>
[0057] 3. In some network conditions, the data packets forwarded with lossless relocation may have a too long latency, resulting in that the data packets become useless when they are forwarded to the target entity.<br>
[0058] 4. When a cross-operator handover occurs, the operators need to design network security and interoperability on multiple layers so as to assure a lossless relocation, thus making the network designing harder and the networking more complicated.<br>
[0059] Thus, the operators need to pay expense, especially in networking and security to implement a lossless relocation. Therefore, in the present invention, lossless relocation is only taken as an approach for presenting user differentiated services and is only performed for important users or users who have a demand on lossless relocation.<br>
[0060] In this embodiment, this parameter is presented in 4 bits. In the 4 bits, bit 1 indicates whether to perform an Intra ASN lossless relocation, bit 2 indicates whether to perform an Inter ASN lossless relocation, bit 3 indicates whether to perform an Intra ASN cross-operator lossless relocation, and bit 4 indicates whether to perform an Inter ASN cross-operator lossless relocation. This parameter may also include the service flow to which the lossless relocation corresponds and the sequence number necessary to be transferred for the lossless relocation, or<br><br>
other parameters capable of indicating the assurance target or the assurance level of the lossless relocation.<br>
[0061] The present invention is not limited to the parameter define approach as described in this embodiment, and all approaches reflecting whether to perform lossless relocation may be employed.<br>
[0062] On the basis of this parameter, the operators may plan the physical connectivity distribution and performance requirement according to the move region and the number of the users subscribing to lossless relocation.<br>
[0063] The BS determines whether to start a lossless relocation procedure according to the lossless relocation indicator in the subscribed QoS.<br>
[0064]   (III) SDU error ratio, Residual bit error ratio, Delivery of erroneous SDUs<br>
[0065] In an embodiment of the present invention, reliability parameters are defined for WiMax as QoS parameters, and it is proposed that upper-layer services requires the physical layer and the data link layer to support reliability requirement.<br>
[0066] The above three reliability parameters may be defined with reference to that in 3GPP 23.107. In the QoS view, the upper-layer services may have reliability requirement on data packet delivery, so as to ensure the implementation of the services and the quality of service. The data link layer and the physical layer are required to meet this reliability requirement through corresponding mechanisms.<br>
[0067]   (IV) Traffic class<br>
[0068] In an embodiment of the present invention, the traffic classes are similar to that in 3GPP, which include conversational class, streaming class, interactive class and background class, and may be extended as required.<br>
[0069] The WiMax QoS processing procedure will be described hereunder on the basis of the above defined quality of service parameters. The present invention provides three processing procedures according to the entity for obtaining subscription data and the entity for controlling QoS negotiation. These processing procedures may be used separately, and will be described respectively as bellow.<br>
[0070] In one processing procedure, the ASN GW obtains subscription data and controls QoS negotiation. In this processing procedure, the BS performs QoS EP but does not perform<br><br>
negotiation controlling DP. As shown in Figure 2, a specific processing procedure includes the steps as follows.<br>
[0071]   In step 21, a network connection is set up between the mobile subscriber station (MSS) and the ASN GW.<br>
[0072] In step 22, the ASN GW obtains subscription data from an AAA server. The subscription data may be used in QoS negotiation for services.<br>
[0073] The subscription data includes a lossless relocation indicator and all the other QoS parameters.<br>
[0074] In step 23, the ASN GW returns an acknowledgement message to the mobile subscriber station.<br>
[0075] In step 24, the mobile subscriber station sends to the ASN GW a request for setting up a session, with QoS information required for a service carried in the request message.<br>
[0076] The QoS information consists of all the previously defined parameters, but it is allowable that a part of the parameters are optional.<br>
[0077] In step 25, the ASN GW checks the QoS information in the request message according to the subscription data, and determines QoS parameters that may be provided for the service, including contrasting each of the parameters in the request with the obtained subscription data to determine whether the parameter is permitted by the subscription data.<br>
[0078] In step 26, the ASN GW exchanges information with the serving base station (BS) using the determined QoS parameters and sets up a radio bearer for transferring the service.<br>
[0079] The information exchanging includes negotiating all the previously defined parameters except that the lossless relocation indicator and the differentiated level parameter are delivered to the serving base station without being negotiated.<br>
[0080] In step 27, the ASN GW sets up a tunnel for transferring the service through exchanging information with the CSN according to the determined QoS parameters.<br>
[0081] The information exchanging includes negotiating all the previously defined parameters, except that the lossless relocation indicator is useless to the CSN and may not be sent to the CSN and the differentiated level parameter needs to be delivered to the CSN.<br>
[0082] In step 28, when the tunnel for transferring the service is set up, the ASN GW returns an acknowledgement message to the mobile subscriber station, with QoS parameters that may<br><br>
be provided to the mobile subscriber station carried in the acknowledgement message.<br>
[0083] The QoS parameters consist of all the previously defined parameters, but it is allowable that a part of the parameters are optional.<br>
[0084] In step 29, the mobile subscriber station transfers the service with the set up tunnel and starts the service, and provides a corresponding QoS assurance for the service based on the tunnel.<br>
[0085] In the processing procedure as shown in Figure 2, even when a handover or relocation (including Intra ASN GW handover or relocation, and Inter ASN GW handover or relocation) of the mobile subscriber station occurs, the QoS may be created and negotiated by a normal ASN GW - BS service flow bearing procedure or a defined ASN GW - BS service flow bearing procedure similar to the normal bearing procedure.<br>
[0086] When executing the handover or relocation procedure, the old BS determines whether to forward to the new BS the downlink packets on the user plane which have not yet been delivered to the mobile subscriber station.<br>
[0087] In another processing procedure, the ASN GW obtains the subscription data and the serving base station (BS) of the mobile subscriber station controls the QoS negotiation. In this processing procedure, the BS performs not only the QoS EP but also the negotiation controlling DP. As shown in Figure 3, a specific processing procedure includes the steps as follows.<br>
[0088] In step 31, a network connection is set up between the mobile subscriber station and the ASN GW.<br>
[0089] In step 32, the ASN GW obtains subscription data from an AAA server. The subscription data may be used in QoS negotiation for services.<br>
[0090] The subscription data includes a lossless relocation indicator and all the other QoS parameters.<br>
[0091] In step 33, the ASN GW returns an acknowledgement message to the mobile subscriber station.<br>
[0092] In step 34, the ASN GW exchanges the obtained subscription data with the BS. The ASN GW sends the obtained subscription data to the BS so that the BS may perform QoS negotiation according to the subscription data.<br>
[0093]   In step 35, the mobile subscriber station sends to the 'BS a request for setting up a<br><br><br>
session, with QoS information required for a service carried in the request message.<br>
[0094] The QoS information consists of all the previously defined parameters, but it is allowable that a part of the parameters are optional.<br>
[0095] In step 36, the BS checks the QoS information according to the subscription data, and determines the QoS parameters that may be provided for the service, including contrasting each of the requested parameters with the subscription data obtained in step 32 to determine whether the parameter is permitted by the subscription data and checking the resources locally on BS.<br>
[0096] In step 37, the BS initiates negotiation with the ASN GW and the CSN on the basis of the determined QoS parameters, to set up a service transferring tunnel for transferring the service.<br>
[0097] The negotiation includes negotiating all the previously defined parameters, except that the lossless relocation indicator is useless to the ASN GW/CSN and may not be sent to the ASN GW/CSN and the differentiated level parameter needs to be delivered to the ASN GW/CSN. The ASN GW may also obtain the differentiated level directly from the subscribed QoS information.<br>
[0098] In step 38, when the service transferring tunnel is set up, the BS returns an acknowledgement message to the mobile subscriber station, with QoS parameters that may be provided to the mobile subscriber station carried in the acknowledgement message. The QoS parameters consist of all the previously defined parameters, but it is allowable that a part of the parameters are optional.<br>
[0099] In step 39, the mobile subscriber station transfers the service with the set up tunnel and starts the service, and provides a corresponding QoS assurance for the service based on the tunnel.<br>
[0100] In the processing procedure as shown in Figure 3, when a handover or relocation of the mobile subscriber station occurs, the ASN GW is required to send corresponding subscription data to the new serving base station (BS) after the handover or location update of the mobile subscriber station. The corresponding processing procedures are shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5 and will be described respectively as below.<br>
[0101] Figure 4 shows a specific processing procedure performed when the mobile subscriber station moves and results in an intra-ASN-GW or inter-ASN-GW location update. The processing procedure includes the steps as follows.<br><br>
[0102] In step 41, the mobile subscriber station notifies the ASN GW of the fact that its location is updated to another BS.<br>
[0103] In step 42, if the ASN GW maintains unchanged, the procedure proceeds to step 43; otherwise, the ASN GW re-obtains from an AAA server subscription data to be used in QoS negotiation for services.<br>
[0104] The subscription data includes a lossless relocation indicator and all the other QoS parameters.<br>
[0105] In step 43, the ASN GW returns an acknowledgement message to the mobile subscriber station.<br>
[0106] In step 44, the ASN GW exchanges the obtained subscription data with the BS currently serving the mobile subscriber station. The ASN GW sends the obtained subscription data to the BS so that the BS may perform QoS negotiation according to the subscription data.<br>
[0107] Figure 5 shows a processing procedure performed when an intra-ASN-GW or inter-ASN-GW handover occurs. The new ASN GW in Figure 5 exists only when an inter-ASN-GW relocation occurs, and the new ASN GW is the original ASN GW when the handover or relocation occurs in the same ASN. The procedure in Figure 5 includes the steps as follows.<br>
[0108] In step 51, the BS originally serving the mobile subscriber station notifies the original ASN GW, the new ASN GW and the new BS of the handover of the mobile subscriber station, i.e. of the fact that the mobile subscriber station is handed over to a new BS served by a new ASN GW. The new BS may get, through this process, the QoS parameters used by the mobile subscriber station before the relocation and then allocate its own resources. The QoS parameters consist of all the previously defined parameters.<br>
[0109] When executing the handover or relocation procedure, the old BS will determine whether to forward to the new BS the downlink packets on the user plane which have not yet been delivered to the mobile subscriber station.<br>
[0110] In step 52, the new ASN GW obtains from an AAA server subscription data to be used in QoS negotiation for services.<br>
[0111] The subscription data includes a lossless relocation indicator and all the other QoS parameters.<br><br>
[0112] In step 53, the new ASN GW exchanges the obtained subscription data with the BS currently serving the mobile subscriber station (i.e. the new BS). The new ASN GW sends the obtained subscription data to the new BS so that the new BS may perform subsequent QoS negotiation according to the subscription data.<br>
[0113] In subsequent processing by the new BS, if the relocation procedure is initiated, the new BS will determine whether to transfer downlink data packets on the user plane that have not yet been delivered, according to the lossless relocation indicator. If the new BS determines not to transfer the downlink data, it discards these downlink data.<br>
[0114] In another processing procedure, the serving base station (BS) of the mobile subscriber station obtains the subscription data and controls the QoS negotiation. In this processing procedure, the BS performs not only QoS EP but also negotiation controlling DP. As shown in Figure 6, a specific processing procedure includes the steps as follows.<br>
[0115]   In step 61, a network connection is set up between the mobile subscriber station (MSS) and the BS.<br>
[0116] In step 62, the BS obtains from an AAA server subscription data to be used in QoS negotiation for services.<br>
[0117] The subscription data includes a lossless relocation indicator and all the other QoS parameters.<br>
[0118] In step 63, the BS returns an acknowledgement message to the mobile subscriber station.<br>
[0119] In step 64, the mobile subscriber station sends to the BS a request for setting up a session, with QoS information required for a service carried in the request message. The QoS information consists of all the previously defined parameters, but it is allowable that a part of the parameters are optional.<br>
[0120] In step 65, the BS checks the QoS information in the request message according to the subscription data, and determines the QoS parameters that may be provided for the service, including contrasting each of the requested parameters with the subscription data obtained in step 62 to determine whether the parameter is permitted by the subscription data and checking the resources locally on the BS.<br>
[0121] In step 66, the BS exchanges information with the ASN GW and the CSN using the determined QoS parameters and sets up a tunnel for transferring the service.<br><br>
[0122] The information exchanging includes negotiating all the previously defined parameters except that the lossless relocation indicator is useless to the ASN GW/CSN and may not be sent to the ASN GW/ CSN and the differentiated level parameter needs to be delivered to<br>
the ASN GW/CSN.<br>
[0123] In step 67, when the tunnel for transferring the service is set up, the BS returns an acknowledgement message to the mobile subscriber station, with QoS parameters that may be provided to the mobile subscriber station carried in the acknowledgement message. The template of the QoS parameters consists of all the previously defined parameters, but it is allowable that a part of the parameters are optional.<br>
[0124] In step 68, the mobile subscriber station transfers the service with the set up tunnel and starts the service, and provides a corresponding QoS assurance for the service based on the tunnel.<br>
[0125] When a handover or relocation of the mobile subscriber station occurs, the parameters of the MSS negotiated on the old BS are transferred to the new BS. The new BS allocates resources according to the negotiated parameters and responds to a handover/relocation request from the old BS. Then, the new BS requests the AAA server for the whole subscription data (including QoS) for using the subscription data in subsequent QoS negotiation.<br>
[0126] When executing the handover or relocation procedure, the old BS will determine whether to forward to the new BS the downlink packets on the user plane which have not yet been delivered to the mobile subscriber station.<br>
[0127] The present invention defines end to end MSS-ANS-CSN QoS parameters for WiMax, so that the WiMax may determine whether a user subscribes to lossless relocation through collectively considering network complexity, cross-operator subscription, latency and packet loss rate, user class and the like. The present invention also defines three end to end MSS-ASN-CSN QoS negotiation procedures for WiMax, so that the WiMax system may assure the QoS over the whole end to end MSS-ASN-CSN bearer, thereby providing differentiated services for WiMax users.<br>
