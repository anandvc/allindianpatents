PREPARATION OF QUINONEDIIMINES FROM PHEKYLENEDtAMINES USING HYDROGEN PEROXIDE AMD A CATALYST<br>
This application claims priority to the filing date of U.S. Provisional Application 60/063,764, filed October 29, 1997.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a process for preparing quinonediimines from their corresponding phenyienediamines using hydrogen peroxide in the presence<br>
of a catalyst.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The class of cyclic enones is well known in organic chemistry. Best known examples of cyclic enones are quinones such as, for example, the benzoquinones, naphthoquinones, anthraquinones, phenanthraquinones, and the like. 1,4-Benzoquinone is commonly referred to as quinone. Quinor.es are generally brightly colored compounds and have versatile applications in chemical synthesis, biological uses, as redox materials, as well as in industry. There are several review articles on the chemistry and applications of quinones including, for example, Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Third ed., Vol. 19, pages 572-605, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1982.<br>
The synthesis of quinones is well documented. See, for example, J. Cascn, Synthesis of Benzoquinones by Oxidation, in Organic Synthesis, Vol. IV, page 305, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York (1948) . Quinones generally are prepared by oxidi2ing the appropriately disubstituted aromatic hydrocarbon derivatives, the substituer.ts being hydroxyl or amino groups in the ortho or para positions, 1,4-Benzoquinone, for example, can be made from the oxidation  of  hydroquinone,  p-aminophenol  or    p-<br><br>
phenylenediamine, or from quinic acid. The reagents generally used for the oxidation are dichromate/sulfuric acid mixture, ferric chloride, silver (II) oxide or eerie ammonium nitrate. In these cases, oxidation of the amlnoaroaatic compound is accompanied by hydrolysis to the corresponding quinone. Some processes may take several hours for completion of the reaction.<br>
Thus, some of the prior art processes utilize a catalytic agent to achieve an acceptable reaction rate while other processes proceed without catalysts. The process according to the present invention utilizes hydrogen peroxide in the presence of a catalytic agent which provides extremely high conversion, high selectivity, and fast reaction rates to prepare the quinonediimine.<br>
A prior art process which utilizes a catalyst in the preparation of a quinoneimine compound is disclosed by Desmurs, et al. in U.S. Patent No. 5,189,218. The process of Desmurs, et al., which converts N-(4-hydroxyphenyl) aniline into N-phenylbenzoquinone-imine, utilizes a manganese, copper, cobalt, and/or nickel compound as a catalyst in an oxidation type reaction.<br>
Other processes are known which use oxidizing agents to convert phenylenediamines into their corresponding quinonediimines. For example, EP 708,081 (Bernhardt et al), which describes the conversion of phenylenediamines to phenylenediimines by oxidation of the diamine In an alkali/alcoholic solution, gives a general description of such processes in its background. The EP *08i process suffers from various disadvantages including long reaction times and low yields. Additional oxidation conversion processes are described by Wheeler in U.S. Patent No. 5,118,807 and by Haas et al, in EP 708,080. However, the use of a hydrogen peroxide in the presence of<br><br>
a catalytic agent in the conversion of diamino compounds to give highly selective yields of diimino compounds has not heretofore been suggested.<br>
As such, the current invention is based on the problem of providing a simple and economic process for the preparation of N,N'-disubstituted quinonediimines in high yields and with high purity.<br>
Summary of the, invention<br>
It has been discovered that phenylenediamine compounds can be converted with extremely high selectivity into the corresponding quinonediimine by reaction of the diamine with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of a catalytic agent. Conditions are revealed in which nearly quantitative yields have been obtained.<br>
In contrast to prior art, an advantage of the present invention is that the conversion of phenylenediamine to the corresponding quinonediimine is nearly quantitative. Thus, very little waste material remains upon completion of the reaction.<br>
Another advantage is that the hydrogen peroxide/catalytic agent combination, as set forth herein, provides an extremely high conversion, high selectivity and faster more complete reaction compared to prior art processes.<br>
Still further advantages of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon reading and understanding the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments.<br>
Detailed Descriation of the Invention<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide   an   effective  process   for   converting<br><br>
phenylenediamines   into   their   corresponding quinonediimines.<br>
In accordance with the object of the invention, a phenylenediamine (ortho or para) according to Formula I:<br><br>
Formula I wherein Rlf R2 and R3 are the same or different radicals selected from hydrogen, hydroxyl, halogen, alkyl, alkoxy, aryl, aralkyl, alkaryl, cycloalkyl, heteroeycie, acyl, aroyl, carbamyl, carboxylic acids, esters, ethers, ketones, alcohols, thiols* allcyl thiols, and cyano, is reacted with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of a catalytic agent.<br>
The reaction produces a corresponding guinonediimine according to Formula Ila or lib;<br><br>
wherein R:/ R2 and Rs are the same as in the compound according to Formula I.<br><br>
-  ,<br><br>
Reaction Scheme 1<br>
Examples of satisfactory radicals for R1#. R2 and R3 are linear or branched alkyls such as methyl/ ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, dodecyl, and the like; aryls such as phenyl, naphthyl, anthracyl, tolyl, ethylphenyl, l-ethyl-3-methylpentyl, 1-methylheptyl, and the like; cycloalkyls such as cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cyclooctyl, and the like. Other examples include allyl and isobutenyl; 1,3,5-sym-triazinyl, 2-benzothiazolyl, 2-benzimidazolyl, 2-benzoxazolyl, 2-pyridyl, 2-pyrimidinyL, 2, 5-thiadiazolyl, 2-pyra2inyl, adipyl, glutaryl, succinyl, malonyl, acetyl, acrylyl, methacrylyl, caproyl, 3-mereaptopropionyl, benzoyl, phthaloyl, terephthaloyl, aminocarbonyl, carbethoxy, carbonyl, fonnyl, and the like. These are merely exemplary radicals and are in no way intended to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
The hydrogen peroxide used in the reaction according to the present invention is typically present in an amount ranging from 1.05 to 2.05 parts per equivalent of phenylenediaiaine. Use of less than one equivalent will tend to produce blends of quinonediijnine and unreacted phenylenediamine. The strength of the hydrogen peroxide can range from 5% to 851. The strength is preferably between 10% and 35%.<br>
Catalytic agents which are used along with the hydrogen peroxide include, but are not limited to, carbon<br><br>
supported catalysts such as Pt/C and Fd/C; modified activated carbon catalysts such as those produced by removing surface oxides therefrom as set forth in U.S. Patent No. 4,624,937, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference; water soluble ionic metal catalysts; activated carbon; metal oxides, such as iron oxide (FeOa), manganese oxide (MnOa), and copper (ID oxide (Cu02); and metals, such as silver (Ag) .<br>
The catalysts of the present invention cause the conversion reaction in the process according to the present invention. Even in systems where the oxidizing agent, aqueous hydrogen peroxide, is soluble in the solvent solution of phenylenediamine (i.e. acetronitrile in N/N-dimethylformamide) there is no reaction until the catalyst is added. It is advantageous to utilize solid catalysts in the reaction according to the present invention as there is ease in recovery of the solid catalysts, via filtration/ and the solid catalysts can be reused in the process. There are also advantages with respect to environmental containment, and there is less likelihood that there will be contamination by the catalyst in the final isolate of quinonediimine. Further, the catalysts give high conversion and excellent selectivity.<br>
The reaction, according to the present invention, takes place in either a homogeneous or two-phase solvent system. Water soluble organic solvents are used for the homogeneous reaction while water insoluble organic hydrocarbon solvents yield the two-phase system. The two-phase system also includes water. The two-phase oxidation system provides ease of separation of the organic components (both quinonediimine and solvent) from the spent aqueous peroxide layer. Organic aprotic solvents useable in the process of the present Invention<br><br>
include, but are not limited to, ketones such as acetone, cyclohexanone, 4-methyl-2-pentanone (methyl isobutyl ketone), 5-methyl-2-hexanone, methyl ethyl ketone; aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons as such as hexanes, heptanes, toluene, xylenes, nitrlles auch as acetonitrile; halogenated solvents such as chloroform, dichloromethane, carbon tetrachloride/ water soluble solvents such as diitiethyl sulphoxide, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, sulfolane, dimethylformanide; esters such as ethyl acetate; ethers auch as 1, 4-dioxan, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The Initial phenylenediamine concentration may range in amounts of from 1% to 100% w/v. Preferably, the initial phenylenediamine concentration ranges from 25% to 60% w/v.<br>
The present reaction may take place at temperatures from -200*C to 150*C, preferably from 25°C to 70°c, depending on the solvent.<br>
As mentioned above, water soluble ionic metal catalysts can also be used for the conversion reaction according to the present invention. Examples of such water soluble ionic metal catalysts include, but are not limited to, sodium tungstate (NasWO
A phase-transfer catalyst may be utilized to accelerate the rate of reaction with the above mentioned water  soluble  metal  catalysts.    The  addition  of<br><br>
tricaprylmethylammonium chloride (Aliquat® 336, Henkle Corp.) to the sodium tungstate/hydrogen peroxide system increases in the rate of conversion of the quinonediimine from the corresponding phenylenediamine.<br>
A phase transfer catalyst can be added directly to the reaction mixture or it can be dissolved in one of the reagents such as Santoflex® 6PPD. The phase transfer catalyst may also be dissolved in a solvent used in the process or in water before addition to the reaction mass.<br>
Another means by which the rate of reaction may be increased is by increasing the stirring or mixing rate in the reaction. By increasing the stirring or mixing, the reaction rate may be effectively adjusted to proceed at a faster pace when necessary.<br>
The present invention can be more clearly illustrated by the following examples.<br>

A water bath was used to maintain the temperature of the mixture at 35*C. Catalyst (l.SOg. of 3% Pt/C with 43.5% H20 (Johnson Matthey)) was added when the 6PPD dissolved in the heptane. Hydrogen peroxide (62.4g. 30-35% in 57.6g. H20) was metered into the stirred mixture over a 2 hour period. This mixture was filtered to remove the platinum catalyst and two 10.Og. rinses of heptane was used to wash the catalyst. The quinonediimine<br><br>

The quinonedlimines prepared by the process of the present invention exhibit multiple activities in vulcanized elastomers. These activities include long term antioxidant activity, along with antiozonant capacity. In fact, the antioxidant capacity of these antidegradants persists ever, after the vulcanizate has been extracted with solvents. In addition, quinonedlimines provide these benefits without the negative effect on scorch generally associated with para-phenylenediamine antidegradants common to the industry. A summary of the activities of these compounds in rubber can be found in the literature, (Cain, M. E. et al., Rubber Industry. 216-226, 1975).<br>
