				<td>Title of the invention<br>
A brazed assembly of a metal piece and a piece made of<br>
ceramic material<br>
Background of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to the general field<br>
of brazing together two materials that present different<br>
thermomechanical properties.<br>
More precisely, the invention applies to brazing<br>
together a metal piece and a piece made of ceramic<br>
material, e.g. based on silicon carbide (SiC) and/or<br>
carbon.<br>
The piece made of ceramic material may be<br>
constituted by solid silicon carbide.  It may also be<br>
constituted by a thermostructural composite, and in<br>
particular by a ceramic matrix composite (CMC) reinforced<br>
by silicon carbide or carbon fibers.<br>
Thermostructural composite materials are<br>
characterized by mechanical properties that make them<br>
suitable for constituting structural parts, while also<br>
conserving these mechanical properties at high<br>
temperatures.  They are constituted by fiber<br>
reinforcement densified by a matrix of refractory<br>
material that fills in the pores of the fiber<br>
reinforcement, at least in part.  The choice of materials<br>
for the fibers and for the ceramic is typically made<br>
amongst carbon and ceramics (i.e. materials that are<br>
neither metallic nor organic), and in particular silicon<br>
carbide (SiC).<br>
By way of example, the invention can be used for<br>
assembling together a piece made of ceramic material with<br>
a metal piece made of an alloy of titanium, aluminum, and<br>
vanadium (TA6V) or of Inconel 718 (registered trademark),<br>
an alloy based on nickel and having the composition<br>
NiCrl9Fel9Nb5Mo3.<br>
The mechanical properties of pieces made of ceramic<br>
material and the fact that these properties are conservedat high temperature make them materials that are<br>
particularly suitable for making pieces that are<br>
subjected to high levels of thermomechanical stress, in<br>
particular in aviation applications (engine parts,<br>
fairingr elements).  When ceramic materials are reinforced<br>
by silicon carbide or carbon fibers, they constitute an<br>
alternative to metallic materials, presenting numerous<br>
advantages, in particular in terms of weight savings and<br>
of operational lifetime.<br>
Conventionally, pieces made of ceramic material and<br>
metal pieces are assembled together by a mechanical<br>
connection of the riveting or bolting type, but such a<br>
connection can sometimes be unsuitable for reasons of<br>
size, difficulty of implementation, or weight.<br>
Furthermore, known homogeneous assembly methods for<br>
use with ceramic materials and involving organic<br>
precursors of ceramics are not suitable for heterogeneous<br>
assemblies between a ceramic material and a metal.<br>
Known brazing techniques used for making homogeneous<br>
connections between two ceramic materials can be<br>
difficult to use for heterogeneously brazing a ceramic<br>
material on a metal because of the very different<br>
thermomechanical and chemical behaviors of ceramic<br>
materials and metals.<br>
A metal alloy based on titanium, aluminum, and<br>
vanadium presents a coefficient of expansion that is<br>
about two to three times greater than that of ceramic<br>
materials.<br>
More precisely, the coefficient of expansion of such<br>
an alloy at 500°C is about lOxlO-6K-1 ± 15%, while the<br>
coefficient for a CMC is' about 2.5XlO-6K-1 to -l.OxlO^K"1 +<br>
15%.<br>
Thus, for a 30 millimeter (mm) assembly, an<br>
expansion offset of 0.2 mm is observed on cooling the<br>
assembly from the solidification temperature of the<br>
brazing composition to ambient temperature.<br><br>
Such an offset leads to high levels of stress<br>
appearing in the two pieces, and in particular to<br>
compression forces in zones of the brazed joint adjacent<br>
to the ceramic, and traction forces in zones adjacent to<br>
the metal piece.  These stresses can give rise to local<br>
deformations that might cause one of the pieces to break<br>
or lead to reduced strength of the brazed joint.<br>
Such deformations are irreversible in the metal<br>
piece.  In the ceramic piece, in particular when made of<br>
a CMC, these deformations can lead to brittle type<br>
breakage.  Such breakage can occur suddenly if the stress<br>
is too high.  Breakage can also occur by damage building<br>
up successively under cyclical stressing.<br>
Object and summary of the invention<br>
A main object of the present invention is thus to<br>
mitigate such drawbacks by proposing an assembly<br>
comprising a metal piece, a piece made of ceramic<br>
material, and at least one intermediate connection<br>
element assembled to each of said pieces by brazing, the<br>
intermediate connection element being constituted by a<br>
deformable sheet presenting brazed flat zones and<br>
deformable zones.<br>
By way of example, a brazing composition of the Ag-<br>
Mn or Ag-Cu-Ti type may be selected, thus making it<br>
possible to obtain an assembly that is strong at high<br>
temperatures of as much as 500°C.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the differential<br>
expansion between the piece made of ceramic material and<br>
the metal piece is absorbed by the deformable sheet.<br>
The assembly thus presents thermomechanical<br>
adaptation to differential expansion, while remaining as<br>
much as possible within the elastic domain. In order to<br>
be able to withstand cooling after brazing and thermal<br>
cycling in operation, it is necessary to accommodate the<br>
differential expansion between the piece made of ceramic<br>
material and the metal piece.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the piece made of ceramic<br>
material is based on silicon carbide,and/or carbon.<br>
For example, the ceramic material piece is made of<br>
solid silicon carbide.<br>
In another embodiment, the ceramic material piece<br>
comprises a ceramic matrix reinforced by silicon carbide<br>
or carbon fibers.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the deformable sheet<br>
includes at least two deformable undulations oriented in<br>
alternation towards the metal piece and towards the piece<br>
made of ceramic material.<br>
Preferably, at least one of the deformable<br>
undulations is free, such a free undulation guaranteeing<br>
increased flexibility for the brazed connection.<br>
The height of the free undulation may advantageously<br>
be used for modifying rigidity in the fold direction.<br>
In a first variant embodiment, the deformable<br>
undulations are concentric.<br>
In an embodiment of this first variant, the<br>
intermediate connection element comprises a first flat<br>
zone that is substantially circular about an axis, a<br>
second flat zone that is substantially annular, coaxial<br>
about the first flat zone, and having an inside diameter<br>
greater than the diameter of said first zone, and<br>
undulations presenting symmetry of revolution about the<br>
above-mentioned axis.<br>
Because of this symmetry, such a connection element<br>
presents behavior that is identical regardless of the<br>
direction of the line of greatest stress.<br>
In another variant embodiment the connection element<br>
is generally in the form of a concertina-folded tape.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the<br>
assembly comprises a plurality of intermediate connection<br>
elements that are disposed radially around a fixed point.<br>
With such a connection element, the stresses are low<br>
in the brazed joints and rigidity can be modulated.<br>
Placing the intermediate connection elements in a<br>
radial star disposition advantageously presents<br>
concentric undulations that are interrupted radially (the<br>
interruptions being constituted by empty gaps along a<br>
plurality of radial directions), thus making it possible<br>
to reduce or eliminate tangential stresses from such<br>
concentric circles.<br>
Preferably, the intermediate connection elements are<br>
arranged in a plurality of radial directions around the<br>
fixed point.<br>
Such an embodiment enables the stiffness of the<br>
assembly between the metal piece and the piece of ceramic<br>
material to be increased.<br>
Around the fixed point as defined above, the offset<br>
due to the expansion of the metal piece increases with<br>
distance from the fixed point.<br>
In a particular embodiment of this configuration,<br>
the intermediate connection elements are of increasing<br>
flexibility on going away from the fixed point.<br>
Such an embodiment serves to compensate for the<br>
above-mentioned increase in offset.<br>
The invention also provides a turbomachine nozzle<br>
including at least one assembly as mentioned above in<br>
which the metal piece is a casing of said nozzle (or a<br>
lever), and the piece made of ceramic material is a flap<br>
of the nozzle.<br>
The invention also seeks to provide a turbomachine<br>
combustion chamber including at least one assembly as<br>
mentioned above in which the metal piece is a casing of<br>
said chamber (or a component part thereof, or a joint -<br>
i.e. a connection element - therein), and the piece made<br>
of ceramic material is a component part of said chamber.<br>
The invention also provides post-combustion<br>
equipment for a turbomachine including at least one<br>
assembly as mentioned above in which the metal piece is a<br>
post-combustion casing (or a platform of post-combustionequipment), and the piece made of .ceramic material is a<br>
flame-holder arm.<br>
The invention also provides a turboinachine including<br>
at least one assembly as mentioned above.<br>

Detailed description of embodiments<br>
Figure 1 shows a connection element 10 suitable for<br>
use in a first assembly in accordance with the invention.<br>
By way of example it is constituted by a plane deformable<br>
material stamped as to form a first flat zone 11 that is<br>
circular about an axis A, and a second flat zone 12 that<br>
is annular about the axis A, these two zones being<br>
interconnected by a deformable zone 13 forming<br>
substantially a truncated cone.  The inside diameter of<br>
the annular zone 12 is greater than the diameter of the<br>
circular zone 11.  The substantially conical walls 13 may<br>
present inclination to a greater or lesser extent<br>
relative to the direction perpendicular to the flat zones<br>
11 and 12.<br>
Figure 2 shows a section II-II (see Figure 1)<br>
through an assembly 14 of the invention made using a<br>
connection element 10 as shown in Figure 1.<br>
In this assembly, a first brazed joint 15 is made<br>
between a metal piece 16 and the circular flat zone 11 of<br>
the connection element 10.  A second brazed joint 17,<br>
preferably using the same brazing composition, is made<br>
between a piece 18 of ceramic material, e.g. a CMC, and<br>
the annular flat zone 12 of the connection element 10.<br>
The connection element 10 shown and used in<br>
Figures 1 and 2, can be obtained from a plate of<br>
deformable material, by cutting out and stamping using a<br>
substantially cylindrical stamping element.<br>
A vertical height or size for the connection element<br>
of about 2 mm is appropriate for aviation applications,<br>
however it will be understood that this size can be<br>
modified as a function of requirements specific to<br>
different applications.  The proportions of the various<br>
portions of the connection element 10 may also be<br>
modified as a function the intended application.<br>
On this topic, it should be observed that modifying<br>
the geometrical parameters of the connection element 10  makes it possible to modify the magnitude of the stresses<br>
observed.<br>
The proposed size of 2 mm enables flexibility to be<br>
obtained in the tangential direction for pieces having a<br>
size of the order of about ten centimeters.  Under the<br>
effect of differential expansion, for example during a<br>
thermal cycle, the conical portion 13 of the connection<br>
element 10 can absorb this expansion differential<br>
completely, or in part, without endangering the strength<br>
of the assembly.  Since the material from, which the<br>
connection element is made is deformable, the deformation<br>
of the cylindrical portion is of no consequence for the<br>
assembly as a whole.<br>
Nevertheless, in the embodiment shown in Figure 2,<br>
high levels of stress can be observed in the brazed<br>
joints and in shear in the membrane in the connection<br>
element.<br>
The connection element 10' described below with<br>
reference to Figure 3 serves to mitigate this drawback.<br>
The connection element 10' has a deformable zone 13'<br>
that is axially symmetrical about an axis A, this zone<br>
13' being shaped so as to comprise at least two free<br>
undulations 19 and 2 0 oriented alternately upwards and<br>
downwards relative to the flat zones 11 and 12 that are<br>
respectively circular and annular about the axis A.  The<br>
structure is still advantageously made of stamped<br>
deformable material.  The presence of undulations that<br>
are free, i.e. not brazed, in the deformable zone 13'<br>
makes the structure more flexible.<br>
Figure 5 shows a section V-V (see Figure 3) of the<br>
connection element 10'.  The flat zones 11 and 12 are<br>
interconnected by the deformable zone 13' that presents<br>
two free undulations 19 and 20.<br>
It should be observed that in Figures 3 and 5, the<br>
undulations 19 and 20 are shown as being substantially<br>
flat, however they could equally well have other shapes,<br>
for example they could be sinusoidal.<br>
Considerations of size, bulk, and proportion similar<br>
to those mentioned for the connection element shown in<br>
Figure 1 apply likewise to the element of Figure 3.<br>
It should be observed that changes in the thickness<br>
of the stamped sheet, radii of curvature rl, r2, r3, r4,<br>
r5, and r6 of the undulations, dimensions £1,   £2   of the<br>
undulations, heights h1, h2, and h3 characterizing the<br>
undulations 19 and 20, angles alpl, alp2, and alp3<br>
between the undulations and the perpendicular to the flat<br>
zones, and sizes £0,   £2   of said flat zones are all to be<br>
envisaged and constitute as many parameters for refining<br>
the stresses and the stiffness properties of the element.<br>
In the embodiments of Figures 1 and 3, the rigidity<br>
of the resulting assembly in shear presents the advantage<br>
of being isotropic in the assembly plane.<br>
The shear stresses observed at the brazed joints in<br>
an assembly using a connection element having the<br>
characteristics shown in Figure 3 are smaller than those<br>
observed in an assembly using a connection element as<br>
shown in Figure 1.<br>
Figure 4 shows a connection element 10" that can be<br>
used in another assembly in accordance with the<br>
invention.  In this embodiment, the connection element<br>
10" is generally in the form of a concertina-folded tape.<br>
In the example shown in Figure 4, the section of the tape<br>
is the same as that shown in Figure 5.  Such a connection<br>
element could also be a stamped structure or could<br>
advantageously be obtained by folding, or by extrusion in<br>
a straight line along the direction Y.  If extruded, and<br>
as shown in Figure 6, an undulating surface 2 2 is<br>
obtained with corrugations that extend along the<br>
direction Y.<br>
The connection elements 10" are then cut once every<br>
L millimeters from said undulating surface 22.<br>
It is also possible to envisage machining a piece<br>
made of metal such as Inconel 718, e.g. by wire<br>
machining.<br>
The intermediate element 10" in this embodiment has<br>
a preferred direction for deformation constituted by the<br>
direction X (tangential rigidity) and a rigid direction<br>
constituted by the direction Y (transverse rigidity).<br>
The stresses observed in the brazed joints in this<br>
embodiment are low.  The resulting assembly then presents<br>
lower rigidity than that observed in the other<br>
embodiments based on an axially symmetrical connection<br>
element 10 or 10', as shown in Figures 1 and 3.<br>
The geometrical parameters of the tape can be<br>
modified in order to obtain the lowest maximum stress in<br>
the brazed joints and in the structure itself for the<br>
lowest tangential rigidity (i.e. in the direction X), and<br>
the highest normal rigidity (in the direction Z).<br>
Thus, it is possible to modify the thickness e_ of<br>
the tape, the radii of curvature rl, r2, r3, r4, r5, and<br>
r6 of the undulations, the dimensions £1,   £2   of the<br>
undulations, the heights h1, h.2, and b.3 of the<br>
undulations, the angles alpl, alp2, and alp3 made by the<br>
undulations relative to the perpendicular to the flat<br>
zones, and the dimensions £0,   £3   of the flat zones.<br>
The three heights h1, h2, h.3 characterize the two<br>
free undulations 19 and 20 of the deformable zone 13'.<br>
These first, second, and third heights h1, h2, h3<br>
correspond, as shown in Figure 5, to the heights of the<br>
portions of the tape that are substantially rectilinear<br>
in profile extending respectively between the first flat<br>
zone 11 and the bottom of the undulation 19, between the<br>
bottom of the undulation 19 and the top of the undulation<br>
20, and between the top of the undulation 2 0 and the<br>
second flat zone 12. '<br>
The person skilled in the art will understand that<br>
the height h2 is selected to be less than or equal to the<br>
height h1.<br>
Nevertheless, it is advantageous also to take<br>
account of the minimum radii of curvature for the free<br>
undulations.  The value of h2 is then advantageously<br>
selected to be greater than or equal to 1/3 of h1.<br>
In the example described herein, the values that<br>
have been selected and that are proposed are limited to a<br>
few tenths of a millimeter since it is required that the<br>
connection between the assembled pieces should not exceed<br>
2 mm.  That said, the greater h1 and h2, the more the<br>
deformations are spread and the lower the stresses.<br>
The table below shows an example of a set of<br>
geometrical parameters suitable for obtaining a good<br>
compromise between maximum stress and rigidity with an<br>
alloy tape made of Inconel 718 (trade name).<br><br>
To increase rigidity in shear parallel to the<br>
assembly plane, a plurality of intermediate connection<br>
elements 10' are disposed radially around a fixed point<br>
23, as shown in Figure 7.<br>
In this embodiment, the deformable sheets are<br>
directed towards the fixed point 23.  By placing the<br>
connection elements 10" in concentric manner, zero<br>
relative displacement is forced between the assembled<br>
pieces for the central point 2 3 of the concentric<br>
arrangement.  This stiffens the assembly in the assembly<br>
plane.  The intermediate elements 10" can be placed in<br>
such a manner that their own deformation directions point<br>
towards the fixed point 23.<br>
This disposition.mitigates the lack of rigidity in<br>
the tangential direction.  Relative deformation during<br>
cooling of the two pieces to be assembled together is<br>
then oriented towaards the center of the assembly, which<br>
is the fixed point 23, so there is no relative movement<br>
between the two pieces that are to be assembled.  The<br>
deformation due to differential expansion is then<br>
absorbed concentrically.  Overall rigidity is obtained<br>
because of the greater rigidity of the structures in the<br>
direction perpendicular to the preferred deformation<br>
direction.<br>
In addition, given that the relative displacement<br>
between the pieces for assembly is zero at the fixed<br>
point and that it increases out to the periphery, it is<br>
advantageous to make use of structures of increasingly<br>
flexibility on going away from the fixed point.  This<br>
serves to improve tangential rigidity in the region of<br>
the fixed point.<br>
Figure 8 shows a particular embodiment of an<br>
assembly piece 3 0 having openings or cavities 31 formed<br>
therein for the purpose of positioning intermediate<br>
connection elements 10" in a star configuration<br>
corresponding to that shown in Figure 7.  This<br>
arrangement enables the intermediate connection elements<br>
10" to be anchored in the piece 3 0 which is preferably<br>
the metal piece, or possibly the piece made of ceramic<br>
material.<br>
Implementing the invention requires the intermediate<br>
elements to be made of a material that is selected to<br>
remain within its elastic domain.  It is also important<br>
to fabricate the intermediate connection elements out of<br>
a material that is as strong as possible in order to have<br>
greater latitude in mechanical weakening, i.e. improved<br>
flexibility.<br>
Figures 9A and 9B show properties that need to be<br>
taken into account when selecting the material for the<br>
intermediate element.  In Figure 9A, curve IMD<br>
representing the mechanical properties of an intermediate<br>
connection element that is solid and ductile is given for<br>
comparison with the curve HX for the metal piece that is<br>
to be assembled.  A loss in mechanical properties PP<br>
(elastic limit, rupture strength) can be observed.<br>
The curve MP represents the potentially ideal<br>
mechanical properties of an intermediate connection element for brazing at a temperature Ts corresponding to<br>
the solidification temperature of the brazing compound.<br>
Below the solidification temperature Ts, the<br>
intermediate element should ideally have mechanical<br>
properties that are weaker than those of the metal piece<br>
for assembly (HX) so as to enable it to act as a ductile<br>
material.  It also needs to have mechanical strength<br>
properties that are at least sufficient at an operating<br>
temperature TF, where the operating temperature TF is<br>
empirically about 2/3 of the above-mentioned<br>
solidification temperature Ts, in degrees Celsius, which<br>
can be written as follows:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
where Ts and TF are expressed in degrees Celsius.<br>
However, the person skilled in the art knows that<br>
these requirements, represented by the curve MP cannot be<br>
achieved with an intermediate element that is solid and<br>
ductile.  To mitigate the loss of property PP observed<br>
with such a material, it is necessary for the assembly to<br>
be overdimensioned.<br>
Figure 9B shows a curve ISC for the mechanical<br>
properties of a material for a deformable intermediate<br>
connection element that is advantageously suitable for<br>
use in the invention.  This curve corresponds to a highly<br>
refractory material (e.g. alloys based on iron, nickel,<br>
chromium, aluminum, titanium) having mechanical<br>
properties that degrade little at high operating<br>
temperature.<br>
Instead of observing a loss of property PP as in<br>
Figure 9A, there can be seen a structural weakening<br>
margin MAS.  This margin is controllable and used for<br>
adjusting the flexibility of the structure at will.<br>
The deformable intermediate connection elements may<br>
also be in the form, of a one-dimensional (1D) undulating<br>
sheet, a stamped sheet, or indeed a sheet with<br>
corrugeitions crossing in two dimensions (2D) .<br>
By way of example, materials for making these<br>
structures can be selected from the following list: ID<br>
undulating sheet of alloy based on FeCrAlY; 2D corrugated<br>
sheet of Haynes 230 (stamped sheet); crossed 2D<br>
corrugated sheets of Nimonic 7 5 (one-dimensional<br>
corrugated tape inserted and brazed in the corrugation<br>
recesses of a one-dimensional corrugated sheet,<br>
embodiment not shown).<br>
Such structures can be used in particular for<br>
assembling parts made of ceramic material based on SiC<br>
with metal parts based on Inconel 718 or TA6V alloy, this<br>
list not being limiting.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
