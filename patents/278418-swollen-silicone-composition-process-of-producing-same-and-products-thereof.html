BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
(1)	Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to composition of swollen silicone polymer, process for making the same and personal care formulations using the same.<br>
(2)	Description of Related Art<br>
The personal care industry thrives on being able to deliver multiple performance products based on mixtures of several components, with each component having a performance and compatibility profile, which can lend that component to properties that are important to or desirable in certain final product formulations. One desirable property is the ability to provide a silky initial feel. This property can be derived from the use of cyclic siloxanes in the formulation. In addition to the silky initial feel, cyclic siloxanes used in silicone gels can simultaneously maintain a high viscosity product, which can also be desirable for various product formulations. Although cyclic siloxanes provide the desired feel characteristics, they are low viscosity, highly flowable liquids. Thus, they are not easily held in a formulation, preferring rather to separate and flow out of a given container or flow uncontrollably across the skin when used in a specific application. Further desirable properties include achieving an initial silky feel while providing a smooth, low-residue feel upon dry-down, as well as achieving a high transfer resistance in as short a period as possible.<br>
Cyclic siloxanes have limitations in terms of their performance and compatibility profile. A desired performance and/or compatibility profile possessing the various desirable properties described above is not always achievable by using a cyclic siloxane. Certain applications can require a different performance and/or compatibility profile that cannot be met by the use of cyclic siloxanes.<br>
In addition to providing a particular performance and/or compatibility profile, cyclic siloxanes provide effective swelling of silicone polymer networks. In addition to cyclic siloxanes, linear siloxane fluids have been used to swell silicone polymer networks and to provide a different performance and/or compatibility profile and different end application benefits from that of cyclic siloxanes. These linear siloxane fluids are made via an equilibrium process and comprise a distribution of molecular weights. Unfortunately, up to now, the use of linear siloxanes has required a much higher level of silicone polymer network (solids) to obtain the desired viscosities that are obtainable through cyclic siloxanes. Using higher amounts of solids has processing and cost disadvantages. In addition, using higher amounts of solids can cause "balling" of a product on the skin, which is a negative sensory attribute.<br>
 <br>

 <br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Applicants have discovered, in one embodiment, that first swollen cross-linked silicone polymer network composition (first silicone composition) with low solids content can be obtained by using alkyltrisiloxane to swell reaction product (a) or (a'), where reaction product (a) or (a') optionally comprises reaction with alkenyl resin, and where reaction product (a') is described below.<br>
As used herein the term trisiloxane is used both specifically as a trisiloxane also collectively includes generically higher molecular weight well defined linear siloxanes having a higher number of D repeat units such as tetrasiloxanes pentasiloxanes and the like or alternatively low molecular weight well defined linear siloxanes such as disiloxanes; such higher order or lower order linear siloxanes are subtended by the cumulative usage herein defined as long as the phenomenological properties and parameters or solid content at constant viscosity are met.<br>
As used herein the terms polyorganosiloxane and organopolysiloxane are interchangeable one with the other.<br>
It will be understood herein that all uses of the term centistokes were measured at 25 degrees celsius.<br>
It will be understood herein that all specific, more specific and most specific ranges recited herein comprise all sub-ranges therebetween.<br>
It will be understood herein that in one embodiment, the numerical range phrases of "from about" and "to about" can comprise the phrases "an integer of from about" and "to an integer of about" respectively<br>
It will be understood herein that all percent ranges are weight percent based upon total weight of first silicone composition unless stated otherwise.<br>
As used herein, the terminology "reaction product (a)" or "reaction product (a')" means a three dimensionally extending structure comprising interconnected polysiloxane chains. In one specific embodiment, reaction product (a) or (a') contains at least one fluid component within interstices of reaction product (a) or (a') that is present as a result of generating cross-linked reaction product (a) or (a'). The term "interstices" is used herein in reference to a reaction product (a) or (a') to denote spaces within reaction product (a) or (a'), that is, spaces between the polysiloxane chains of the reaction product (a) or (a').<br>
In one specific embodiment, reaction product (a) or (a') is cross-linked silicone polymer network that is insoluble in said fluid component, but that is capable of being swollen by said fluid component. The amount of crosslinking present in the reaction product (a) or (a') can be characterized with respect to the degree of swelling exhibited by reaction product (a) or (a') in the fluid component. In one specific embodiment, the cross-linked structure of the reaction product (a) or (a') is<br>
 <br>
effective to allow reaction product (a) or (a') to be swollen by a low molecular weight silicone fluid, from its original volume to a swollen volume that is a factor of specifically from about 1.01 to about 5000, more specifically, of from about 2 to about 1000, and most specifically of from about 5 to about 500, times its original volume. In another specific embodiment, the original volume of reaction product (a) or (a') can be determined, for example, by extracting or evaporating all fluid component present in the first silicone composition described herein, to leave the original volume, that is, the volume of the reaction product (a) or (a') in the absence of fluid component.<br>
In another specific embodiment, reaction product (a) or (a') is a swollen cross-linked silicone polymer network gel, more specifically a swollen cross-linked silicone polymer network gel that can be swollen to a volume as described above. It will be understood herein, that in one embodiment herein, gels described herein are formed following the polymerization of an epoxy-functional organosiloxane to form a polyether siloxane copolymer network, which is known to those skilled in the art and is described in U.S. Patent No. 6,531,540, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. In one embodiment the contents of U.S. Patent Application No. 11/274,450 filed on November 15, 2005 are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.<br>
In one embodiment solids can generally be defined as any particles that are swollen by fluid component in first silicone composition described herein, In one embodiment, particles that are swollen by fluid component in first silicone composition are particles of reaction product (a) or (a') as described herein. In another embodiment, as stated above, certain applications require first silicone composition with a lower level of solids than second silicone composition, while still mamtaining a desired viscosity. In one embodiment herein, solids content is measured by evaporation or extraction of all of the fluid component from first silicone composition and reported as weight percent of the total weight of first silicone composition. In one specific embodiment, solids content can be a lower solids content than that of second silicone composition comprising an equivalent reaction product (a) or (a') and a linear silicone fluid (and/or any other swelling solvent) other than alkyltrisiloxane. hi one specific embodiment, solids level can be measured by evaporation of the fluid component by heating in an oven at 150ยฐC<br>
A desired viscosity as used herein can vary greatly depending upon application of first silicone composition described herein. In one specific embodiment, first silicone composition can be used in personal care formulations as described herein. A personal care formulation can also have any viscosity that would be desirable for the particular personal care formulation.<br>
As used herein, cross-link density is used to define the extent of the cross-linking between polysiloxane chains. Thus, "low" cross-link density would be used to describe a loosely cross-linked network having more interstitial space between the polyorganosiloxane chains, whereas "high" cross-link density would be used to describe a more tightly cross-linked structure with smaller or fewer, interstitial<br>
 <br>
spaces between the polyorganosiloxane chains. As used herein, cross-link structure means a three dimensionally extending structure comprising interconnected siloxane copolymer chains. At high cross-link densities in a cross-linked polymer the polymer will not swell significantly in the presence of a compatible solvent and thus will not imbibe much solvent.<br>
In one specific embodiment herein, first silicone composition can have a lower solids content than that of second silicone composition (where second silicone composition comprises an equivalent reaction product'(a) or (a') as first silicone composition) but comprising other than alkyltrisiloxane such as the non-limiting example of cyclic siloxane.<br>
In one more specific embodiment, a lower solids content can entail, where first silicone composition has a given cross-linked structure and a given cross-link density and said lower solids content of first silicone composition is at least about 10 percent lower than the solids content for second silicone composition which has an equivalent cross-linked structure and an equivalent cross-link density to first silicone composition; and where first silicone composition has a viscosity of greater than about 10,000 centistokes.<br>
In one more specific embodiment, a lower solids content can entail, where first silicone composition has a given cross-linked structure and a given cross-link density and said lower solids content of first silicone composition is at least about 25 percent lower than the solids content for second silicone composition which has an equivalent cross-linked structure and an equivalent cross-link density to first silicone composition; and where first silicone composition has a viscosity of greater than about 100,000 centistokes.<br>
In one more specific embodiment, a lower solids content can entail, where first silicone composition has a given cross-linked structure and a given cross-link density and said lower solids content of first silicone composition is at least about 40 percent lower than the solids content for second silicone composition which has an eqluivlant cross linked structure a; id an eluivaleitt cross-iink density to first silicone composition; and where first about composition. has a viscosity of greater than about.200,000 qentistoW<br>
In one other embodiment, any of the above-described viscosities for swollen cross-linked silicone polymer network composition can be obtained at any of the above-described ranges of solids content.<br>
In. one specific embodiment, reaction product (a) or reaction product (a') described below, can be any known or commercially used reaction product (a) or reaction product (V) provided that reaction product (a) or (a') can be swollen to a.swollen volume,.as described above. In,anql)er. specific embodiment, reaction product (a) or () is an, ORGANOPOLYSILOXQNE. in vol a further specific embodiment, reaction, prod net (a) or (a').can be a three-dinieiisional or ga no-functional polyovganosiioxane, with copolymer cross-link.<br>
 <br>
In yet another more specific embodiment the organo group(s) of organopolysiloxane can be any organo group commonly associated with such polymers and can generally be selected from the non-limiting examples of alkyl radicals of 1 to about 60 carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl; cycloalkyl radicals such as cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl, cyclooctyl; mononuclear aryl radicals such as phenyl, methylphenyl, ethylphenyl; alkenyl radicals such as vinyl and allyl; alkylene oxide radicals, such as ethylene oxide, propylene oxide and mixtures thereof; and haloalkylradicals such as 3, 3, 3, trifluoropropyl. In a more specific embodiment, the organo groups are alkyl radicals of 1 to 8 carbon atoms, and are most specifically methyl. In one embodiment, polyorganosiloxane has some hydroxyl groups in the polymer. In one specific embodiment the organo group(s) of organopolysiloxane can be any of the organic functional gjoups described in U.S. Patent No. 6,531,540 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. It will be understood that the nomenclature used in U.S. Patent No. 6,531,540 regarding hydrocarbon radicals will deemed to be equivalent to organo groups as they are described herein, in that any hydrocarbon radical described in U.S. Patent No. 6,531,540 can be used as an organo group as is described herein so that the terms hydrocarbon radical as it is described in U.S. Patent No. 6,531,540 and organo group(s) as used herein is interchangeable. In one embodiment herein it will be understood that any organo groups described herein can be present on said organopolysiloxane or can be bonded to said organopolysiloxane through a reaction with an organic compound, such as the non-limiting example of an alpha-olefin.<br>
In one specific embodiment herein, there is provided a first swollen cross-linked silicone polymer network composition comprising: (a') the reaction product of :<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
The use of alkyltrisiloxanes as fluid component for first silicone composition(s) provides a means of obtaining high viscosity silicone gel at low solids concentrations.<br>
This result is unexpected when compared with other linear silicone fluids, which are typically much less effective silicone fluid components than corresponding cyclic silicone fluids and therefore require increasing amounts of cross-linked silicone network such as reaction product (a) or (a') to provide first silicone composition with desired properties. The addition of alkyltrisiloxane as fluid component also offers a number of formulation and sensory benefits when compared with silicone compositions swelled by other linear polydimethylsiloxane fluids, A number of silicone gels have been prepared using both octyltrisiloxane (OTS ) and ethyltrisiloxane (ETS) as the fluid component either alone or in combination with other silicone fluids. It is quite clear from these studies that OTS and ETS fluids function as more efficient gel fluid components than other linear polydimethylsiloxane fluids. Also, when these gels with trisiloxanes are formulated into personal care formulations, the personal care formulations show a number of functional or aesthetic performance benefits not seen with gels swelled by other fluid component(s); some non-limiting examples of such sensory benefits include decreased balling on the skin, general feel of the personal care formulation on the skin and improved thickening of personal care formulations.<br>
Comparative Example<br>
260 grams (g) of a silicone hydride fluid with the approximate composition MHD133DH2.5MH was mixed with 8.5 g of vinyl cyclohexene oxide, 21.7g of Alpha Olefin (Gulftene C30+ from Chevron), 630 g of decamethyl cylcopentasiloxane (D5) and 0,075 g of platinum catalyst solution, Karstedt's Catalyst. The mixture was heated to 90 degrees Celsius and then mixed for 45 minutes. Then 9.7 g of another silicone hydride fluid, MDH5oM in 80 g of Da was added to the hot reaction mixture. This was stirred at 90 degrees celsius for another 4 hours and then the reaction was quenched with the addition of a terminal olefin which was C16-16 alpha olefin from Innovene. The resulting material had a solids content of 29.8 weight percent and extractables of 20 weight percent based upon the total weight of reaction product (a'). Then 250 g of this material was diluted with 350 g of D5, and then passed through a Gaulin homogenizer one time at 9000 pounds per square inch (psi). The resulting gel (Sample 1) had a solids content of about 12.5 weight percent based upon the total weight of first silicone gel and a viscosity of 183,000 centipoise (cP) at 24 hours.<br>

Then 9.7 g of another silicone hydride, MDH5oM in 80 g of ethyltrisiloxane was added to the hot reaction mixture. This was stirred at 90 degrees Celsius for another 4 hours and then the reaction was quenched with the addition of a terminal olefin which was C16-18 alphaolefin from Innovene.

As the summary of results in Table 1 indicates, the decamethyl cylcopentasiloxane (D5) and etliyltrisiloxane have similar gel-swelling efficiencies when cross-linked polymer alkyl chain length and extractables measures are considered. Typically, higher extractables measures results in somewhat higher viscosity materials. Also noted from these experiments is that octyltrisiloxane is a less efficient swelling agent than ethyltrisiloxane as shown in Sample-2a and Sample-3a.<br>
Example 3<br>
Preparation of the reaction product (a1), and its swelling by a range of organosiloxane fluids. 260 g of a silicone hydride fluid with the approximate composition MHD133DH2.5MH was mixed with 8.5 g of vinyl cyclohexene oxide, 15.4g of C16-18 alpha olefin from Innovene, 630g of polydimethylsiloxane (5cP) and 0.075 g of platinum catalyst solution (Karstedt's Catalyst). The mixture was heated to 90ยฐC and then mixed for 45 minutes. Then 8.6g of another silicone hydride, MDH5oM, in 80g of polydimethylsiloxane (5cP) was added to the hot reaction mixture. This was stirred at 90ยฐC for another 4 hours and then the reaction was quenched with the addition of a terminal olefin (C16-18 alpha olefin from Innovene). The resulting material had a solids content of 30%, based on the total weight of reaction product (a'). The following swollen silicone gels were prepared by passing blends of reaction product (a') powder with mixtures of octyltrisiloxane and 5 cP polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) through the Gaulin homogenizer at 9,000 psi twice. The solids and viscosities of the resulting silicone gels (Samples 4-14) are listed in the following table; (Table 2).<br>

As the results in this example clearly illustrate, increasing the proportion of octyltrisiloxane to 5 cP PDMS increases the viscosity of the silicone gel at a given level of reaction product (a') solids in the silicone gel. Therefore alkyltrisiloxane is a more efficient fluid component for silicone gel than the linear 5 cP PDMS fluid.<br>
Also, the alkyltrisiloxane is able to effectively swell reaction product (a') in the presence of a linear higher molecular weight PDMS fluid. Therefore, combination of PDMS and alkyltrisiloxane in silicone gel provides unique end user benefits, said combination of PDMS and alkyltrisiloxane will also be a more efficient swelling fluid component for reaction product (a') than PDMS used alone.<br>
Example 4<br>
260 grams (g) of a silicone hydride fluid with the approximate composition MHD133DH2.5MH was nuxed with 8.5 g of vinyZ cyclohexene oxide, 21.7g of Alpha Olefin (Gulftene C30+ from Chevron), 630 g of decamethyl cylcopentasiloxane (D5) and 0,075 g of platinum catalyst solution, Karstedt's Catalyst. The mixture was heated to 90 degrees Celsius and then mixed for 45 minutes. Then 9.7 g of another silicone hydride fluid, MDH50M in 80 g of D5 was added to the hot reaction mixture. This was stirred at 90 degrees Celsius for another 4 hours and then the reaction was<br>
 <br>
quenched with the addition of a terminal olefin which was C16-18 alpha olefin from Innovene. The resulting material had a solids content of 30%, and extractables of 15 weight percent based on the total weight of reaction product (a'). The following silicone gels (Samples 15-20) were prepared by passing blends of reaction product (a') powder with mixtures of octyltrisiloxane and decamethyl cyclopentasiloxane through the Gaulin homogenizer at 9,000 psi. The solids and viscosities of the resulting gels are listed in the following table (Table 3).<br>

As the results in Table 3 indicate, blending octyltrisiloxane with decamethyl cyclopentasiloxane provides silicone gels with lower viscosity implying that D5 is a more effective fluid component than octyltrisiloxane.<br>
Upon analysis of Examples 1-5, the following trend is very easy to ascertain: decamethyl cyclopentasiloxane (D5) = ethyltrisiloxane &gt; octyltrisiloxane &gt; 5 cP PDMS fluid &gt; higher molecular weight PDMS fluids in ranking of ability to swell reaction product (a').<br>
Example 5<br>
Enhanced Thickening Performance of Silicone Gel in Cosmetic Formulations: When silicone gels were formulated into "cream to powder" foundations, gels containing allcyltrisiloxanes provided had much higher viscosity products than gel containing D5 alone (Sample 1); and were easy to spread with very pleasant sensory properties and exhibited enhanced product stability. The formulations (1-4) are shown in the table below (Table 4). It will be understood that weight percent as used in Table 4 for the formulations 1-4 is weight percent was based on the total weight of the formulation.<br>

These formulations were made by mixing all of the parts A, B and C for 5 to 10 minutes with an overhead stirrer at 3000 rotations per minute (rpm). As noted by the viscosity measurements of the final products, the use of ethyltrisiloxane or octyltrisiloxane in the silicone gels provided much Iiigher viscosity cream to powder foundations (Formulations 2-4) than silicone gels without the trisiloxane (Formulation 1). These foundation formulations were also easy to spread with a differentiating sensory property that provided a powdery after feel for the product.<br>

Furthermore, the MH2Q could be condensed with a hydroxyl-containing compound to form an alkoxy functional linear polyorganosiloxane or polyorganosiloxane resin that could then be reacted with linear alkenyl polyorganosiloxane.<br>
Example 10<br>
Hydrosilylation of a linear hydrogen polyorganosiloxane and a linear alkenyl polyorganosiloxane.<br>
 <br>
Gel E Synthesis: An organopolysiloxane with the average structure of<br>
Me3SiO(Me2SiO)24-5(MeHSiO)3.5SiMe3 (MD24-5oDH3.5M, 118.95 g, 0.05 mol), an<br>
organopolysiloxane	with	the	average	structure	of<br>
CH2=CHSi(CH3)20(Me2SiO)2oSi(CH3)2CH=CH2 (MviD2oMvi, 162.74g, 0.10 mol) and decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (718.36 g, 1.94 mol) were charged into a Ross mixer (Charles Ross &amp; Son Co. Hauppauge, NY model DPM-2). The low viscosity clear solution was agitated for 5 min under a nitrogen atmosphere at 50 rpm. The temperature of the kettle was 80 ยฐC. Karstedt's catalyst (0.2 mL, 10 wt% Pt) was added via a pipette and the reaction temperature was raised to 90 ยฐC. Within 30 min. a white powder was seen. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 1.5 hours, and then the agitation was increased to 100 rpm for an additional 30 min. A white powder varying in particle size from very small to over 1 cm was obtained in near quantitative yield.<br>
Gel E Homogenization: Gel E (241.9 g) and each of the solvents ETS, D5, and SF96- 5, separately, in amounts of (208.1 g) were premixed using a Waring commercial blender (Torrington, CT). The composition of each suspension is disclosed in Table 7. Each suspension was transferred to a Gaulin Homogenizer model 15MR- 8TA (APV Homogenizer Group, Chino, CA) and homogenized at 8000 psig. The viscosity of each resulting gel was taken using a Brookfield Model DV- IT+ Pro viscometer (Middleboro, Massachusetts). The viscocity of each gel also measured after a given length of time as indicated in Tables 5 and 6.<br>
Examplell<br>
Hydrosilylation of a linear alkenyl polyorganosiloxane with a organopolysiloxane containing at least one alkoxy group and at least two hydride functionalities, specifically, 2 or more DH functionalities, where DH is as described above.<br>
Partial Condensation of MD32DH9M with stearyl alcohol:<br>
Decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (183.26 g, 0.5 mol), stearyl alcohol (25.68 g, 0.09 mol), and a organopolysiloxane with the average structure of Me3SiO(Me2SiO)32(MeHSiO)9SiMe3 (MD32DH9M, 102.73 g, 0.03 mol) were charged into a 500 mL round bottom flask equipped with a condenser, an overhead stirrer, and a temperature controller with a heating mantle. The flask was heated to 130 ยฐC and 0.1 mL of a 1 wt% solution of chloroplatinic acid in ethanol was added. After the initial flash off of ethanol hydrogen proceeded to bubble out of the flask. The reaction was allowed to continue for 3.5 hrs at 130 ยฐC. The reaction was followed by FT-IR until no further reduction in the Si-H peak, at 910 cm-1, was observed.<br>
Gel F Synthesis: The stearyl alcohol modified silicone produced in the above reaction specifically, MD32D"DH6M silicone in Tables 5 and 6 was transferred to a Ross mixer (Charles Ross &amp; Son Co. Hauppauge, NY model DPM-2) set to 95ยฐC Decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (516.37 g, 0.5 mol) and an organopolysiloxane with the average structure of CH2=CHSi(CH3)20(Me2SiO)2oSi(CH3)2CH=CH2 (MviD2oMvi, 171.60g, 0.10 mol) were agitated at 100 rpm for 10 min. 0.2 mL of a 10 wt% platinum Karstedt's catalyst was added. A white powder started to form after 10 minutes. The<br>
 <br>
product was agitated in the Ross mixture for an additional 1.5 hours. A fine white powder was obtained in near quantitative yields.<br>
Gel F Homogenization: Gel F (226.51 g) and each solvent, ETS, D5 and SF96-5, separately, in amounts of (223.49 g) were premxxed in separate suspsensions using a Waring commercial blender (Torrington, CT), The composition of each suspension is disclosed in Table 7. Each suspension was transferred to a Gaulin Homogenizer model 15MR-8TA (APV Homogenizer Group, Chino, CA) and homogenized at 8000 psig. The viscosity of each resulting gel was taken using a Brookfield Model DV-IT+ Pro viscometer (Middleboro, Massachusetts). The viscocity of each gel was also measured after a given length of time as indicated in Tables 5 and 6.<br>
Example 12<br>
By analogy with Examples 7-11, it is expected that the reaction of a linear alkoxy hydride polyorganosiloxane with an a, ฯ, reactive organic diene molecule would yield a structure that could be effectively homogenized with trisiloxane to form a swollen gel.<br>
