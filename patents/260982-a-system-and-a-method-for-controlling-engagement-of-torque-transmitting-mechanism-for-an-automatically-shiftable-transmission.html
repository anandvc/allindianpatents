TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
	The present invention relates to a control system and method of torque<br>
transmitting mechanism engagement for an automatically shiftable transmission.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
	In general, automatically shiftable transmissions include a number of gear<br>
elements and selectively engageable friction elements (referred to herein as torque<br>
transmitting mechanisms) that are controlled to establish one of several forward speed<br>
ratios between an input shaft and an output shaft of the transmission. The input shaft is<br>
coupled to an engine through a fluid coupling such as a torque converter, and the output<br>
shaft is coupled to the drive wheels of the vehicle through a differential gearset.<br>
	Shifting from a currently established speed ratio to new speed ratio<br>
involves, in most cases, disengaging a torque transmitting mechanism (off-going torque<br>
transmitting mechanism) associated with the current speed ratio and engaging a torque<br>
transmitting mechanism (on-coming torque transmitting mechanism) associated with the<br>
new speed ratio. Each such shift includes a preparation or fill phase during which an<br>
apply chamber of the on-coming torque transmitting mechanism is filled with pressurized<br>
fluid in preparation for torque transmission. Once filled to a predetermined amount, the<br>
fluid pressure supplied to the torque transmitting mechanism is lowered to allow smooth<br>
torque transmitting mechanism engagement.<br>
	Typically, the fill phase is carried out by commanding a maximum on-<br>
coming torque transmitting mechanism pressure for an empirically determined fill time.<br>
See, for example, the U.S. Pat. No. 4,707,789 to Downs et al., issued on November 17,<br>
1987, and assigned to the assignee of the present invention and hereby incorporated by<br>
reference in its entirety. In Downs et al., the fill time for any given torque transmitting<br><br>
mechanism is obtained from a look-up table as a function of the commanded fill pressure,<br>
less the torque transmitting mechanism return spring pressure, and then adjusted as a<br>
function of fluid temperature to compensate for variations in fluid viscosity. In<br>
operation, the stored fill times are then adaptively adjusted based on the observed inertia<br>
phase delay, in order to compensate for sources of error that influence the fill time. A<br>
similar approach is found in the U.S. Pat. No. 5,216,606 to Lentz et al., issued on June 1,<br>
1993, and assigned to the assignee of the present invention and hereby incorporated by<br>
reference in its entirety. In Lentz et al., the fill time is determined by table look-up based<br>
on the pump speed, as compensated for efficiency and fluid viscosity, and further<br>
modified based on the time since the last shift and a hydraulic restriction factor.<br>
	Traditional torque transmitting mechanism engagement methods provide a<br>
trim phase subsequent to the fill phase to allow smooth engagement and enhance shift<br>
quality. The trim phase provides a steady increase in torque transmitting mechanism<br>
apply pressure to the on-coming torque transmitting mechanism. Pressure variations or<br>
control system instability during the trim phase may cause poor shift quality.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
	Provided is an electro-hydraulic control system for an automatically<br>
shiftable transmission comprising at least one variable bleed solenoid valve operable to<br>
selectively provide pressurized fluid to selectively engage at least one torque transmitting<br>
mechanism. Also provided is an electronic control unit operable to control the variable<br>
bleed solenoid valve. The electronic control unit is sufficiently programmed to control<br>
the variable bleed solenoid to provide the pressurized fluid at a high pressure level to the<br>
torque transmitting mechanism for a first predetermined time. Subsequently, the<br>
electronic control unit will command the variable bleed solenoid valve to substantially<br>
disallow the pressurized fluid to the torque transmitting mechanism for a second<br>
predetermined time subsequent to the first predetermined time.<br><br>
	The variable bleed solenoid may modulate at least one pressure regulator<br>
valve operable to selectively and variably provide the pressurized fluid to selectively<br>
engage the torque transmitting mechanism. The control unit may be sufficiently<br>
programmed to further control the variable bleed solenoid to provide the pressurized<br>
fluid, at a lower pressure level, to the torque transmitting mechanism for a third<br>
predetermined time subsequent to the second predetermined time.<br>
	Also provided is a method of controlling an automatically shiftable<br>
transmission having a hydrauhcally actuated Tillable torque transmitting mechanism. The<br>
method includes providing at least one variable bleed solenoid valve operable to<br>
selectively provide pressurized fluid to selectively engage the hydrauhcally actuated<br>
fillable torque transmitting mechanism. The variable bleed solenoid valve is commanded<br>
to deliver a maximum pressure value for a first predetermined time to substantially fill<br>
the hydrauhcally actuated fillable torque transmitting mechanism. Subsequently, the<br>
variable bleed solenoid valve is commanded to a minimum pressure value for a second<br>
predetermined time. Finally, the variable bleed solenoid valve is commanded to an<br>
intermediate pressure value for a third predetermined time to trim the hydrauhcally<br>
actuated fillable torque transmitting mechanism into engagement.<br>
	The method may further include commanding the variable bleed solenoid<br>
valve to a maximum pressure value subsequent to the third predetermined time to fully<br>
engage the hydrauhcally actuated fillable torque transmitting mechanism. Also, the<br>
method may include providing a main source of pressurized fluid and determining a time<br>
required to stabilize the main source of pressurized fluid after the first predetermined<br>
time. Thereafter, the time required to stabilize the main source of pressurized fluid is<br>
substantially equated to the second predetermined time.<br>
	The above features and advantages and other features and advantages of<br>
the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description of the<br>
best modes for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br><br><br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
	The present invention is described in the context of a multi-ratio<br>
automatically shiftable transmission having planetary gearsets of the type described in the<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,070,927 to Polak, and having an electro-hydraulic control system of the<br>
type described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,601,506 to Long et. al., both of which are hereby<br>
incorporated by reference in their entirety. Accordingly, the gearset and control elements<br>
shown in Figure 1 hereof have been greatly simplified and further information regarding<br>
structure and operation may be found in the aforementioned patents. Additionally, the<br>
transmission and electro-hydraulic control system is only exemplary in nature and those<br>
skilled in the art will recognize that the ideas embodied by the present invention may be<br>
applied to other such systems.<br>
	Referring to Figure 1, the reference numeral 10 generally designates a<br>
vehicular powertrain including engine 12, automatically shiftable transmission 14, and a<br>
torque converter 16. The torque converter 16 provides a fluid coupling between the<br>
engine 12 and an input shaft 18 of the transmission 14. A torque converter clutch 19 is<br>
selectively engageable thereby providing a mechanical coupling for substantially unitary<br>
rotation between the engine 12 and the input shaft 18. An output shaft 20, of the<br><br><br>
transmission 14, can transmit torque to the drive wheels of the vehicle in one of several<br>
ways. The illustrated embodiment depicts a rear wheel drive (RWD) application in<br>
which the output shaft 20 is connected to a final drive or differential gearset 22.<br>
	The transmission 14 has three inter-connected planetary gearsets,<br>
designated generally by the reference numerals 23, 24 and 25. The input shaft 18<br>
continuously drives a sun gear 28 of gearset 23, selectively drives the sun gears 30 and 32<br>
of gearsets 24 and 25 via torque transmitting mechanism C1, and selectively drives the<br>
carrier 34 of gearset 24 via torque transmitting mechanism C2. The ring gears 36, 38,<br>
and 40 of gearsets 23, 24, and 25 are selectively grounded to a transmission case or<br>
housing 42 via torque transmitting mechanisms C3, C4 and C5, respectively.<br>
	The state of the torque transmitting mechanisms C1, C2, C3, C4, and C5,<br>
or C1-C5, (i.e., engaged or disengaged) can be controlled to provide six forward speed<br>
ratios, a reverse speed ratio, and a neutral condition. The first forward speed ratio is<br>
achieved by engaging torque transmitting mechanisms C1 and C5. The second forward<br>
speed ratio is achieved by engaging torque transmitting mechanisms C1 and C4. The<br>
third forward speed ratio is achieved by engaging torque transmitting mechanisms CI and<br>
C3. The fourth forward speed ratio is achieved by engaging torque transmitting<br>
mechanisms C1 and C2. The fifth forward speed ratio is achieved by engaging torque<br>
transmitting mechanisms C2 and C3. The sixth forward speed ratio is achieved by<br>
engaging torque transmitting mechanisms C2 and C4. Additionally, the reverse speed<br>
ratio is achieved by engaging torque transmitting mechanisms C3 and C5, while the<br>
neutral condition is achieved by engaging only the C5 torque transmitting mechanism.<br>
Shifting from one forward speed ratio to another is generally achieved by disengaging<br>
one torque transmitting mechanism (referred to as the off-going torque transmitting<br>
mechanism) while engaging another torque transmitting mechanism (referred to as the<br>
on-coming torque transmitting mechanism). For example, the transmission 14 is shifted<br>
from the first forward speed ratio to the second forward speed ratio by disengaging the<br>
torque transmitting mechanism C5 while engaging the torque transmitting mechanism<br>
C4.<br><br><br>
	The selective engagement of the torque converter clutch 19 and the torque<br>
transmitting mechanisms C1-C5 is controlled by an electro-hydraulic control system,<br>
generally designated by the reference numeral 44. The hydraulic portion of the electro-<br>
hydraulic control system 44 includes a hydraulic positive displacement pump 46, which<br>
draws hydraulic fluid from a reservoir 48. Also provided is a pressure regulator valve 50,<br>
which returns a portion of the pressurized fluid exiting the pump 46 to the reservoir 48<br>
thereby establishing a regulated pressure or main pressure in passage 52 to provide a<br>
control pressure. A secondary pressure regulator valve 54 further regulates the main<br>
pressure within the passage 52. A manual valve 56 is manipulated by the operator of the<br>
vehicle when shifting or selecting transmission ranges. A solenoid valve 58 such as a<br>
variable bleed solenoid valve, or VBS valve, operates to modulate the flow of pressurized<br>
fluid to the torque converter clutch 19 thereby selectively engaging and disengaging the<br>
torque converter clutch 19.<br>
	A set of three relay valves selectively operated by on/off type solenoid<br>
valves, represented in Figure 1 as the consolidated block 60, are utilized in concert with<br>
the manual valve 56 to enable controlled engagement and disengagement of each of the<br>
torque transmitting mechanisms C1-C5 through the use of only two trim valve assemblies<br>
62 and 62'. For a selected ratio, a particular combination of relay valves within the<br>
consolidated block 60 is selectively coupled to one of the trim valve assemblies 62 and<br>
62' to effect the engagement of the on-coming torque transmitting mechanism, and the<br>
other of the trim valve assemblies 62 and 62' to effect the disengagement of the off-going<br>
torque transmitting mechanism.<br>
	The trim valve assemblies 62 and 62' each comprise a pressure regulator<br>
valve 63 and 63', respectively, which are biased by a variable pilot pressure that is<br>
developed by a respective variable bleed solenoid, or VBS, valve 65 and 65'. An<br>
electronic control unit, or ECU 66, determines pressure requirements for smoothly<br>
engaging the on-coming torque transmitting mechanism while smoothly disengaging the<br>
off-going torque transmitting mechanism to shift from one speed ratio to another. The<br>
ECU 66 subsequently develops the corresponding commanded pressure signals, and then<br>
supplies the signal to the respective VBS valves 65 and 65'.<br><br><br>
	The electronic portion of the control is primarily embodied by the ECU,<br>
66. The ECU 66 is microprocessor-based in architecture. The ECU 66 controls the<br>
electro-hydraulic control system 44 based on a number of inputs 68 to achieve a desired<br>
transmission speed ratio. The inputs 68 may include, for example, signals representing<br>
the transmission input speed TIS, a driver torque command TQ, the transmission output<br>
speed TOS, and the hydraulic fluid temperature Tsump. Sensors for developing such<br>
signals are known to those skilled in the art and have been omitted for simplicity. The<br>
ECU 66 can be programmed based on either or both experimental and modeling results,<br>
to perform the functions set forth in detail below.<br>
	The relay valves within the consolidated block 60 are provided with<br>
pressure switches 74, 76, 78 for supplying diagnostic signals to the ECU 66 over a<br>
plurality of conductors or leads 80 based on the respective relay valve positions. The<br>
ECU 66, in turn, monitors the various diagnostic signals for the purpose of electrically<br>
verifying proper operation of the controlled elements. A control lever 82 of the manual<br>
valve 56 is coupled to a sensor and display module 84 that produces a diagnostic signal<br>
on a conductor or lead 86 based on the position of the control lever 82. Such a diagnostic<br>
signal is typically referred to as a PRNDL signal, since it indicates which of the<br>
transmission ranges (P - Park, R - Reverse, N - Neutral, D - Drive, or L - Low) has been<br>
selected by the operator.<br>
	The VBS valves 65 and 65' are a closed end type, and operate to provide a<br>
variable pressure signal to the respective pressure regulator valve 63 and 63' by bleeding<br>
off the control pressure supplied by the secondary pressure regulator valve 54 to obtain<br>
the required output pressure. The VBS valves 65 and 65' provide precise pressure<br>
control, provided the control pressure from the secondary pressure regulator valve 54<br>
remains above a threshold level. If the control pressure from the secondary pressure<br>
regulator valve 54 drops too low, the VBS valve 65, 65' will not be able to maintain the<br>
output pressure or on-coming pressure as commanded by the ECU 66. The output<br>
pressure will vary depending on whether the VBS valve 65, 65' is outputting a high or a<br>
low level of output pressure. If the VBS valve 65, 65' is outputting a high level of output<br>
pressure, a decrease in the control pressure from the secondary pressure regulator valve<br><br><br>
54 will cause the output pressure to decrease. Alternately, if the VBS valve 65. 65' is<br>
outputting a low output pressure, the drop in control pressure will cause the output<br>
pressure to increase. This instability at low control pressures may cause poor shift<br>
quality. Because of the mechanical characteristics of the closed ended VBS valves 65<br>
and 65', the drop in the control pressure may cause the VBS valves 65 and 65' to leak<br>
fluid when commanded to a hydraulically off condition thereby further exacerbating the<br>
drop in control pressure.<br>
	As indicated above, each shift from one speed ratio to another includes a<br>
preparation or fill phase during which an apply chamber of the on-coming torque<br>
transmitting mechanism is filled to a predetermined value with fluid in preparation for<br>
torque transmission. Once the fill phase is complete, a trim phase initiates where the<br>
commanded pressure is lowered to an intermediate value to allow precise control of the<br>
pressurized fluid supplied to the apply chamber for engagement torque transmitting<br>
mechanism. The pressurized fluid compresses an internal return spring of the torque<br>
transmitting mechanism and strokes a piston to contact the torque transmitting<br>
mechanism plates, developing torque capacity beyond the initial return spring pressure.<br>
Thereafter, the apply phase begins wherein maximum commanded pressure is requested<br>
allowing full engagement of the torque transmitting mechanism.<br>
	A typical control strategy for engagement of the torque transmitting<br>
mechanism involves commanding a maximum on-coming torque transmitting mechanism<br>
pressure for an empirically determined fill time, and then proceeding with the subsequent<br>
phases of the shift. See, for example, the aforementioned U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,707,789 and<br>
5,216,606. These patents recognize that the fill time for a given shift can change<br>
depending on various factors.<br>
	The fill phase is the portion of the torque transmitting mechanism<br>
engagement strategy that requires the greatest amount of fluid. If fill phase occurs when<br>
the engine 12 is operating at a low rotational speed and the fluid within the transmission<br>
14 is warm, the fill phase may cause the line pressure or main pressure within passage 52<br>
and the control pressure supplied by the secondary pressure regulator valve 54 to<br>
decrease. Accordingly, the one VBS valve 65 and 65' that is commanded to be<br><br><br>
hydraulically off may begin leaking and cause the VBS valve 65 and 65' that is<br>
commanded hydraulically on to output a higher control pressure than commanded. Once<br>
the VBS valve 65 and 65' that is commanded hydraulically off begins to leak, the main<br>
pressure and control pressure will decrease even further, thereby causing the leakage of<br>
the hydraulically off VBS valve 65 and 65' to further increase. The control pressure<br>
circuit to the VBS valves 65 and 65' may also include an orifice, not shown, for system<br>
stability. Once the leakage of the hydraulically off VBS valve 65 and 65' becomes<br>
sufficiently large, the fluid flowing out of the control pressure circuit may be greater than<br>
the fluid flowing into the control pressure circuit.<br>
	Figure 2 is a graphical representation of a typical a torque transmitting<br>
mechanism engagement strategy. Figure 2 can best be understood with reference to<br>
Figure 1. The curve 90 represents the line pressure or main pressure within the passage<br>
52. The curve 92 represents the control pressure exiting the secondary pressure regulator<br>
valve 54 and supplied to the VBS valves 65 and 65'. The curve 94 represents the<br>
commanded pressure value signal provided by the ECU 66 for engagement of the torque<br>
transmitting mechanism. While the curve 96 represents the fluid pressure within the on-<br>
coming torque transmitting mechanism, commonly referred to as the output pressure or<br>
on-coming pressure. The curve 98 represents the leakage value of the VBS valves that<br>
are commanded "off within the control system 44. At a time equal to to, the fill phase<br>
initiates and the ECU 66 commands one of the VBS valves 65 or 65' to command full<br>
pressure as shown by the step increase in the commanded pressure value of curve 94. As<br>
noted hereinbefore, by commanding a maximum pressure value during the fill phase, the<br>
torque transmitting mechanism apply chamber may be quickly filled. However, as<br>
illustrated by the curve 90, the main pressure will drop as a result of the large fluid<br>
demands of the on-coming torque transmitting mechanism. The control pressure,<br>
represented by curve 92, will decrease in response to the drop in the main pressure value.<br>
The lowered main and control pressure values will cause the VBS valve 65 and 65' that is<br>
in the hydraulically off condition to leak as illustrated by curve 98.<br><br>
	At a time value equal to t1, the fill phase is ended and the trim phase<br>
begins. The commanded pressure signal from the ECU 66 drops to an intermediate<br>
pressure value as shown by the step change of the curve 94 at t1. As a result of the<br>
continued VBS valve leakage, demonstrated by curve 98, the main pressure and control<br>
pressure has a long "lag time", represented by L in Figure 2, to recover. This "lag time"<br>
is shown as the difference in time between t2 and t1. During this "lag time", the stability<br>
of the on-coming pressure signal to the on-coming torque transmitting mechanism is<br>
compromised, as demonstrated by the curve 96 between t1 and t2. When the main<br>
pressure value and the control pressure value reach a high enough value to stabilize the<br>
VBS valve 65 and 65' that is commanded hydraulically on, the leakage from the VBS<br>
valve 65 and 65' that is commanded hydraulically off will abate and the on-coming<br>
pressure will stabilize for the remainder of the trim phase, as shown by curve 96 between<br>
t2 and t3. At a time equal to t3 the ECU 66, requests full commanded pressure thereby<br>
providing full engagement of the torque transmitting mechanism. The instability of the<br>
on-coming pressure between t1 and t2 as a result of the "lag time" may result in poor<br>
engagement of the torque transmitting mechanism.<br>
gure 3 is a graphical representation of a torque transmitting mechanism<br>
engagement strategy consistent with the method of the present invention. Figure 3 can<br>
best be understood with reference to Figure 1. At a time equal to to, the fill phase initiates<br>
and the ECU 66 commands one of the VBS valves 65 or 65' to a maximum commanded<br>
pressure as shown by the step increase in the commanded pressure value of curve 94. As<br>
noted hereinbefore, by requesting a maximum commanded pressure value during the fill<br>
phase, the torque transmitting mechanism apply chamber may be quickly filled.<br>
However, as illustrated by the curve 90, the main pressure value will drop as a result of<br>
the large fluid demands of the on-coming torque transmitting mechanism. The control<br>
pressure, represented by curve 92, will decrease in response to the drop in the main<br>
pressure value. The lowered main and control pressure values will cause the VBS valves<br>
65 and 65' within the control system 44 that are in the hydraulically off condition to<br>
begin to leak as illustrated by curve 98.<br><br><br>
	At a time value equal to t1, the fill phase is ended and the trim phase<br>
begins. The commanded pressure signal from the ECU 66 drops to a minimum value of<br>
approximately zero for a predetermined time and is then increased to an intermediate<br>
pressure value, as shown by the curve 94 between t1 and t2'. By requesting approximately<br>
zero commanded pressure or substantially disallowing pressurized fluid flow to the<br>
torque transmitting mechanism for a predetermined amount of time, the main pressure<br>
and control pressure may recover with a reduced or shorter "lag time" over that "lag<br>
time" L which is shown in Figure 2. This "lag time" is shown in Figure 3 as the<br>
difference in time between t2' and t1. As a result of this reduced "lag time", the stability<br>
of the on-coming pressure signal communicated to the on-coming torque transmitting<br>
mechanism is stabilized, as demonstrated by the curve 96 between the t1 and t2'.<br>
Additionally, the reduced "lag time" allows the main pressure value and the control<br>
pressure value to reach a value sufficiently large enough to stabilize the VBS valve 65<br>
and 65' that is leaking, the leakage from the VBS 65 and 65' valve will abate shortly after<br>
t1. At approximately t2', an intermediate pressure is commanded to trim the torque<br>
transmitting mechanism into a controlled engagement. The on-coming pressure will<br>
remain stable throughout the trim phase, as shown by curve 96 substantially between t2'<br>
and t3. At a time equal to t3, the ECU 66 requests full commanded pressure thereby<br>
providing full engagement of the torque transmitting mechanism. The stability of the on-<br>
coming pressure between t1 and t3 as a result of the reduced "lag time" will result in<br>
smooth engagement of the torque transmitting mechanism.<br>
	Figure 4 depicts a method 100 of engaging an on-coming torque<br>
transmitting mechanism, such as C1, C2, C3, C4 or C5 of Figure 1. The method 100 can<br>
best be described with reference to Figure 1. The method is initiated at step 102.<br>
	At step 104, the ECU 66 commands one of the VBS valves 65 and 65' to<br>
control a respective trim valve 63 and 63' to provide maximum on-coming pressure to the<br>
on-coming torque transmitting mechanism. This step is referred to hereinabove as the fill<br>
phase. The maximum pressure value is commanded for a predetermined amount of time<br>
and will vary depending on the volume of the apply chamber of the on-coming torque<br>
transmitting mechanism, the main pressure value, the fluid temperature, etc. The fill time<br><br>
may be determined through modeling analysis or directly through experimentation. At<br>
the completion of the fill phase, the method 100 proceeds to step 106.<br>
	At step 106, the ECU 66 will request substantially zero commanded<br>
pressure, thereby allowing the main pressure value to increase and to stabilize any of the<br>
VBS valves within the control system 44 that may be leaking. The method 100 then<br>
proceeds to step 108.<br>
	At step 108 the ECU 66 determines whether the main pressure value has<br>
recovered by a predetermined amount. This may be done using pressure sensors within<br>
the passage 52 or by some other method known to those skilled in the art. If the main<br>
pressure value has not recovered by a predetermined amount, the method 100 will loop to<br>
step 106, alternately the method 100 will proceed to step 110.<br>
	At step 110, the ECU 66 requests an increased commanded pressure to<br>
trim the on-coming torque transmitting mechanism into engagement. By following this<br>
method of torque transmitting mechanism engagement, smooth engagements may be<br>
attained without the need to increase the capacity of the pump 46 to maintain the main<br>
pressure the efficiency of the powertrain 10.<br>
	While the best modes for carrying out the invention have been described<br>
in detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention relates will recognize various<br>
alternative designs and embodiments for practicing the invention within the scope of the<br>
