				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a process for providing lyophilised materials and to<br>
apparatus for use in such a process.<br>
Lyophilisation is a well known process in the pharmaceutical and vaccines<br>
industries in which a dispersion, e.g. a solution or suspension, of a material in a<br>
carrier liquid, normally aqueous, is frozen then exposed to reduced pressure to cause<br>
the liquid to evaporate, e.g. to perform a sublimation transition from the frozen to the<br>
vapour state. This process makes it possible to withdraw water contained in a material<br>
to make the material more stable at ambient temperature and thus to facilitate its<br>
conservation. A typical lyophilisation process is disclosed in EP-A-0 048 194.<br>
Normally the dispersion is contained in a container typically a vial, which is<br>
exposed to the reduced pressure so that the liquid can evaporate out through an<br>
opening of the container e.g. the open mouth of a vial. Vial closures are known which<br>
can be mated with a vial mouth in a first, upper, position leaving a vent for the escape<br>
of evaporating liquid, and which can be moved downward into a second position<br>
when the lyophilisation process is complete to seal the vial. Typically vials which<br>
such closures in their upper, vented, position are arranged in a two dimensional array<br>
on a shelf for freezing and then exposure to a reduced pressure. Plural shelves are<br>
stacked vertically above each other with the underside of an upper shelf above the<br>
closures of vials on the shelf below, and when the lyophilisation process is complete<br>
upper shelves are lowered onto the closures of vials on the shelf immediately below to<br>
push the closures into the lower closed position.<br>
Numerous types of apparatus are known for performing the lyophilisation<br>
process on such containers, generally comprising a chamber which can be<br>
hermetically closed with the containers inside and inside which suitable conditions of<br>
temperature and reduced pressure can be maintained.<br>
A specific type of vial with a closure is disclosed in WO-A-04/018317 but is<br>
not disclosed therein for use in a lyophilisation process.<br>
Some problems of known lyophilisation processes using the above described<br>
vials are that the mouth openings and vents of these known vials allow opportunity for<br>
ingress of contamination after a dispersion of the material has been introduced into<br>
the vial, e.g. during the subsequent stages of loading the vial containing the dispersion<br>
onto shelves suitable for the lyophilisation apparatus and of transporting such vials to<br>
the lyophilisation apparatus.<br><br>
It is an object of the present invention to address these problems, and to offer<br>
further advantages, as will be disclosed below.<br>
In a first aspect this invention provides a process for preparing a lyophilised<br>
material comprising:<br>
providing a container bounded by an envelope having a penetrable region and<br>
containing a dispersion of the material in a carrier liquid,<br>
with the penetrable region penetrated with a penetrator such that the penetrator<br>
provides a conduit through the envelope to provide communication between the inside<br>
and outside of the container when the penetrator has penetrated the penetrable region,<br>
evaporating the carrier liquid out of the container via the conduit,<br>
withdrawing the penetrator from the penetrable region.<br>
Such a process may be performed by providing a container bounded by an<br>
envelope having a penetrable region and containing a dispersion of the material in a<br>
carrier liquid, penetrating the penetrable region with the penetrator such that the<br>
penetrator provides a conduit through the envelope to provide communication<br>
between the inside and outside of the container when the penetrator has penetrated<br>
the penetrable region, evaporating the carrier liquid out of the container via the<br>
conduit, then withdrawing the penetrator from the penetrable region.<br>
The container may be a vial, e.g. a typical pharmaceutical vial, made of glass<br>
or plastics material, having a mouth opening closed by an elastomeric closure e.g.<br>
which plugs into the mouth opening, and the penetrable region may comprise a region<br>
of this elastomeric closure. In such a construction the combination of vial and closure<br>
comprise the said envelope.<br>
Evaporation of the carrier liquid out of the container via the conduit may be by<br>
generally conventional lyophilisation conditions, e.g. maintaining the dispersion at a<br>
temperature such that the carrier liquid is frozen, and application of reduced pressure<br>
so that the frozen liquid sublimates directly from the solid to the vapour state. Suitable<br>
conditions of temperature and reduced pressure are for example disclosed in the<br>
Example of EP-A-0 048 194.<br>
By "penetrates" and derived terms as used herein is included at least partially<br>
penetrates, and the term includes opening a communication passage through the<br>
penetrable region, for example actual passage of the penetrator from one surface of<br>
the envelope to another, e.g. puncturing and physically disrupting of the envelope,<br>
expansion of an already existing hole by means of the penetrator, disruption of a<br><br>
weakened area of the envelope by the penetrator to create an opening through the<br>
envelope.<br>
The penetrable region may comprise a previously-formed puncture hole. For<br>
example such a previously-formed formed puncture hole may have been formed by<br>
driving a puncturing means such as a needle through the penetrable region. Such a<br>
needle may be a hollow filling needle which has been passed through the envelope<br>
and via which the dispersion has been introduced into the vial, the needle then<br>
subsequently withdrawn, and the liquid so introduced may subsequently be cooled<br>
and frozen for lyophilisation. For example such a needle may be passed through the<br>
elastomer closure of a vial. Typically with a suitable thickness of the elastomer<br>
material of the closure the elastic nature of the closure causes the elastomer material<br>
to close when the needle has been withdrawn, to thereby close the residual needle<br>
hole sufficiently to reduce the possibility of contaminants entering the vial via the<br>
puncture hole before the hole can be sealed. This offers the advantage that after<br>
introducing the liquid into a vial using a filling needle there is much less opportunity<br>
for contamination to enter the vial than would be the case with the above-mentioned<br>
known vial in which, after a liquid has been introduced into the vial, the closure is<br>
inserted into the vial mouth but in a partly open vented state. Also, advantageously<br>
after filling using such a filling needle and leaving a closed puncture hole the vial may<br>
be inspected through its transparent wall for particles, with less threat of<br>
contamination than would be with the known vials.<br>
The process of the invention may therefore include the preceding step of<br>
providing the container bounded by an envelope having a penetrable region therein by<br>
passing a hollow filling needle through the envelope, introducing the dispersion into<br>
the container via this needle, then subsequently withdrawing the needle to leave a<br>
residual puncture hole in the closure. Preferably such a filling needle has a pyramidal<br>
point, as it is found that such a needle cuts a hole in controlled directions. Preferably<br>
such a pyramidal point has three faces to cut the hole in three controlled directions. A<br>
preferred construction of such a filling needle is for example disclosed in<br>
WO2004/096114.<br>
A suitable construction of such a vial and closure is that disclosed in WO-A-<br>
04/018317, specifically as disclosed in and with reference to Fig. 6 thereof. Such a<br>
vial has an upwardly-facing mouth opening bounded by a rim, and a closure system<br>
comprising an elastomer closure part shaped to sealingly engage with the mouth<br><br>
opening, having a lower surface facing the interior of the vial and an opposite upper<br>
surface facing away from the vial, and capable of being punctured by a needle, and a<br>
clamp part able to engage with the vial, particularly with the rim of the mouth<br>
opening, and able to bear upon the upper surface of the closure part to hold the<br>
closure part in a closing relationship with the mourn opening, the clamp part having<br>
an aperture therein through which a region of the upper surface of the closure part is<br>
exposed when the clamp part is engaged with the vial.<br>
In this embodiment the said exposed region of such an elastomeric closure,<br>
suitably when previously punctured by a needle as described above, may comprise the<br>
penetrable region. An advantage of such a vial is that it may be provided sealed by the<br>
closure and with a sterile interior, e.g. sterilised by radiation, or for example when<br>
made in a sterile state by the manufacturing process disclosed in WO2005/005128.<br>
The process preferably comprises the further step of sealing or otherwise<br>
covering the penetrable region after the penetrator has been withdrawn from the<br>
penetrable region.<br>
In another aspect the invention provides apparatus suitable for use in the<br>
process described herein comprising:<br>
a penetrator capable of penetrating a penetrable region of a container bounded<br>
by an envelope having a penetrable region therein and containing a dispersion of the<br>
material in a carrier liquid such that the penetrator when penetrating the penetrable<br>
region provides a conduit through the envelope to provide communication between<br>
the inside and outside of the container when the penetrator has penetrated the<br>
penetrable region,<br>
means to cause the penetrator to penetrate the penetrable region,<br>
means to evaporate the carrier liquid out of the container via the conduit,<br>
means to withdraw the penetrator from the penetrable region.<br>
Suitable embodiments of the process, containers suitable for use with the<br>
process, and the apparatus, and working relationships between them will now be<br>
described.<br>
The penetrator may be suitable to form a hole or enlarge a pre-existing hole<br>
through the penetrable region of the envelope, e.g. through the elastomer closure of a<br>
vial. The penetrator may be shaped, e.g. in cross section, to provide a conduit through<br>
the envelope when the penetrator has penetrated the envelope. In an embodiment the<br>
penetrator may comprise a generally tubular member having an end adapted to<br><br>
penetrate the penetrable region e.g. a pointed end. Alternatively the penetrator may<br>
have one or more concavity in its outer surface to provide such a conduit between the<br>
penetrator and the adjacent surface of the penetrable region. Typically such an end<br>
may be generally pointed. For example the penetrator may comprise a generally<br>
conical member, e.g. a hollow cone with an open base or an opening adjacent its base,<br>
and an opening adjacent its apex, with a conduit passing through the penetrator, e.g.,<br>
linking the opening at the apex and the open base, such that its apex may penetrate the<br>
penetrable region and vapour of the carrier liquid may enter the apex, pass through the<br>
hollow interior of the cone and exit via the conduit. Such a conduit should be of<br>
suitable dimensions to allow flow of the vapour of the evaporating liquid at a<br>
sufficient rate that lyophilisation can be achieved in an acceptable time, i.e. similar to<br>
known lyophilisation processes, which will be known to those in the art. To achieve<br>
this, typically at its narrowest the conduit should have a cross section of at least 1mm,<br>
preferably 2mm or more.<br>
The conduit may incorporate a barrier which is permeable to gases but<br>
obstructs the passage of particles and in particular of microorganisms to thereby<br>
reduce the likelihood of contamination entering the container. Such a barrier may<br>
comprise a thin permeable membrane, for example made of a sterile filtration media.<br>
In a first embodiment of the process and apparatus of the invention, the<br>
penetrator may be mountable on the container, e.g. on a vial, so that the penetrator can<br>
be moved, suitably reciprocally, from a first position in which the penetrator is<br>
outside the container and does not penetrate the penetrable region, to a second<br>
position in which the penetrator penetrates the penetrable region, and preferably then<br>
back towards a first position in which the penetrator is outside the container and does<br>
not penetrate the penetrable region.<br>
In one form of this first embodiment, the penetrator may be provided in<br>
combination with a guide whereby the penetrator may be mounted on the container.<br>
Such a combination comprises a further aspect of this invention, comprising:<br>
a penetrator adapted to penetrate a penetrable region of the envelope of a<br>
container to thereby provide a conduit through the envelope to provide<br>
communication between the inside and outside of the container when the penetrator<br>
has penetrated the penetrable region, and<br>
a guide which is mountable on the container to thereby support the penetrator<br>
so that the penetrator can be moved from a first position in which the penetrator does<br><br>
not penetrate the penetrable region to a second position in which the penetrator<br>
penetrates the penetrable region, and optionally back toward a first position in which<br>
the penetrator does not penetrate the penetrable region.<br>
For example a guide may be removably mounted on the container, capable of<br>
supporting and guiding the penetrator for such movement. In an embodiment,<br>
particularly suitable for the above-mentioned generally conical penetrator, and<br>
particularly when the container is a vial with an elastomeric closure, the guide may<br>
comprise a generally cylindrical sleeve or part sleeve within which the penetrator is<br>
movable, suitably reciprocally.<br>
In a preferred construction of this last-mentioned apparatus, the penetrator and<br>
the guide may be made integrally, e.g. of plastics material by means of injection<br>
moulding. In this construction the penetrator and guide may be so made initially<br>
linked by one or more thin frangible integral link and with the penetrator in the first<br>
position, so that so that as the penetrator is moved from the first position toward the<br>
second position severance of the link(s) occurs.<br>
When the vial is of the above-mentioned type disclosed in WO-A-04/018317<br>
such a guide may be mountable upon the vial by removable engagement with the<br>
clamp part. In a preferred type of vial disclosed in WO-A-04/018317 the clamp part is<br>
itself provided with means for engagement of a cover part, being the groove 37<br>
disclosed in Fig. 1 of WO-A-04/018317, and the guide may engage in a snap-fit with<br>
such a groove. It may be preferable to engage such a removable guide with the<br>
container such as a vial before any liquid content in the vial is frozen, as engagement<br>
features such as a snap-fit engagement may become brittle and lose their resilience at<br>
the low temperatures normally used for freezing liquids in lyophilisation processes.<br>
The penetrator may be caused to penetrate the penetrable region by relative<br>
movement of the penetrator and the container such that the end adapted to penetrate<br>
the penetrable region contacts the penetrable region and penetrates it. For example if<br>
the penetrator comprises a tubular member with a pointed end or apex of a cone this<br>
may be a movement parallel to the longitudinal axis of the tubular member or base-<br>
apex axis of the cone.<br>
This movement may be caused by application of a force to the penetrator to<br>
urge the penetrator in this direction. As mentioned above it is common practice in the<br>
art of lyophilisation to arrange vials for exposure to a reduced pressure in a two<br>
dimensional array on a shelf, and to stack plural shelves vertically above each other<br><br>
for exposure. Therefore in the process the application of force to the penetrator to<br>
urge the penetrator in the first position toward the second position direction may be<br>
achieved by arranging containers, e.g. vials, in a two dimensional array on a shelf,<br>
then causing a member to bear upon the penetrator to urge the penetrator in this<br>
direction. Such a member may comprise part of a vertically upper adjacent shelf<br>
caused to bear upon the penetrator to urge the penetrator in this direction. During the<br>
process of evaporation of the liquid this member e.g. upper shelf may bear upon the<br>
penetrator to maintain the penetrator in position.<br>
The penetrator, and/or guide may incorporate suitable vent means e.g.<br>
apertures so that contact of such a shelf with the penetrator does not impede outflow<br>
of vapour of the carrier liquid through the conduit.<br>
In another form of this first embodiment a penetrator is provided which is<br>
itself mountable on the container, such as a vial, in a position in which the penetrator<br>
is penetrating the penetrable region, e.g. the elastomeric closure of a vial.<br>
Such a penetrator may as above comprise a generally conical member, and<br>
may be made of plastics material by means of injection moulding. Such a penetrator<br>
may be mountable on the container such as a vial by means of a snap fit engagement.<br>
When the vial is of the above-mentioned type disclosed in "WO-A-04/018317 such a<br>
penetrator may be mountable upon the vial by removable engagement with the clamp<br>
part thereof, which as mentioned above is itself provided with means for engagement<br>
of a cover part, being the groove 37 disclosed in Fig. 1 of WO-A-04/018317, and the<br>
penetrator may engage in a snap-fit with such a groove. For example such a penetrator<br>
may comprise the conical member at least partly surrounded by a skirt extending in<br>
the cone base-apex direction, the skirt having snap-fit engagement means adjacent the<br>
rim furthest from the cone base. The conduit through the penetrator may be closed by<br>
a barrier membrane which allows gases to pass through but not particulate<br>
contaminants.<br>
It may be preferable to engage such a penetrator with the container such as a<br>
vial before any liquid content in the vial is frozen, as engagement features such as a<br>
snap-fit engagement may become brittle and lose their resilience at the low<br>
temperatures normally used for freezing liquids in lyophilisation processes.<br>
In use this form of penetrator may be mounted e.g. by the snap fitting onto a<br>
vial, penetrating the elastomeric closure so that the liquid may be evaporated from the<br>
vial, typically after being frozen solid. Thereafter the penetrator may be removed from<br><br>
its mounting on the vial. To facilitate the mounting of the penetrator on the container<br>
a mounting tool may be provided to bear upon the penetrator so that for example a<br>
snap-fit engagement engages. To facilitate the removal of the penetrator from the<br>
container a removal tool may be provided. In one construction snap fit means on the<br>
penetrator may be provided with a disengagement means, for example a pivot lever<br>
upon which the removal tool may bear to disengage the snap-fit engagement.<br>
In a second embodiment of the process and apparatus of the invention, plural<br>
containers, e.g. vials, may be situated on an upward facing surface of a lower shelf,<br>
and a vertically adjacent upper shelf may comprise plural penetrators, and the upper<br>
and lower shelves may be moved relatively toward each other, so that the penetrators<br>
thereof are thereby moved reciprocally from a first position in which the penetrator<br>
does not penetrate the penetrable region, to a second position in which the penetrator<br>
penetrates the penetrable region, and back into a first position in which the penetrator<br>
does not at least partly penetrate the penetrable region.<br>
An apparatus is therefore provided particularly suitable for this second<br>
embodiment of the process, comprising a lower shelf having an upwardly facing<br>
surface suitable for locating plural containers, e.g. vials, thereon, and a vertically<br>
adjacent upper shelf having a downward facing surface which comprises plural<br>
penetrators, the upper and lower shelves being movable relatively toward each other,<br>
so that the penetrators thereof are thereby moved from a first position in which the<br>
penetrator does not penetrate the penetrable region, to a second position in which the<br>
penetrator penetrates the penetrable region, and reciprocally back towards a first<br>
position in which the penetrator does not penetrate the penetrable region.<br>
Such upper and lower shelves and the penetrators of this apparatus of the<br>
second embodiment may be made of metals suitable for lyophilisation processes, e.g.<br>
stainless steel.<br>
In this second embodiment the upper shelf may be moveable downwardly<br>
toward the lower shelf, or the lower shelf may be moveable upwardly toward the<br>
lower shelf, or the upper shelf may be moveable downwardly and the lower shelf may<br>
be moveable upwardly.<br>
In this second embodiment each penetrator may comprise a generally conical<br>
member with its apex pointing downwardly from a lower surface of the upper shelf<br>
toward the lower shelf, e.g. a hollow cone with a opening adjacent its apex, and an<br>
open base, such that its apex may penetrate the penetrable region and vapour of the<br><br>
carrier liquid may enter the apex, pass through the hollow interior of the cone and exit<br>
via the open base, e.g. as described above. Such a penetrator may be made integrally<br>
with the upper shelf, or may be attached to the upper shelf.<br>
This second embodiment of the apparatus may comprise an upper shelf having<br>
an upward facing surface on which are situated plural containers such as vials, and<br>
vertically adjacent to this first upper shelf there may be a further upper shelf which<br>
comprises plural penetrators above this upward facing surface, and this further upper<br>
shelf may be moved analogously to the upper shelf described above. The further<br>
upper shelf may itself have an upward facing surface on which are situated plural<br>
vials, so that plural such shelves may be stacked vertically relative to each other.<br>
The weight of an upper shelf may be sufficient to maintain the penetrator, in<br>
both embodiments of the apparatus, in the second position penetrating the penetrable<br>
region, e.g. of an elastic closure against the elasticity of the closure, and/or upper and<br>
lower shelves may be held together during the evaporation procedure. Thereafter the<br>
upper and lower shelves may be moved relatively vertically apart so that the<br>
penetrator is moved toward the first position. The elasticity of an elastomeric closure<br>
can tend to urge the penetrator out of the second position.<br>
When the weight of an upper shelf is used to hold the penetrator in the second<br>
position, penetrating the penetrable region, the elasticity of e.g. an elastomeric closure<br>
may be insufficient to subsequently urge the penetrator from the closure back towards<br>
the first position. In such a situation means may be provided to move the upper and<br>
lower shelves relatively closer together and relatively further apart, and such means<br>
may be conventional means known for raising and/or lowering shelves. For example<br>
the vertically adjacent shelves may be resiliently biased toward the first position, for<br>
example by a spring means between them.<br>
Force applied to the penetrator and/or restraint of movement of the penetrator,<br>
e.g. the weight of an upper shelf bearing downwards upon the penetrator, may be<br>
necessary to maintain the penetrator in the second position penetrating an elastic<br>
closure against the elasticity of the closure. When such force or restraint is released<br>
e.g. by increasing the vertical separation between the lower and upper shelves until<br>
the upper shelf no longer bears on the penetrator, the elastic will tend to spring back<br>
to eject the penetrator from the closure. Increasing the vertical separation may be done<br>
whilst the elastomer closure is at the reduced temperature and then allowing the<br><br>
closure to warm toward ambient temperature, or alternatively the closure may be<br>
allowed to warm to ambient temperature before increasing the vertical separation.<br>
The penetrator may be withdrawn from the penetrable region toward the first<br>
position by a movement of the penetrator relative to the container such that the end<br>
adapted to penetrate the penetrable region is withdrawn from the penetrable region.<br>
Suitable means to withdraw the penetrator from the penetrable region may use the<br>
elasticity of the elastomer material of a vial closure.<br>
For example in processes and apparatus comprising a lower shelf upon which<br>
plural vials may be arranged in a two dimensional array, and a second shelf vertically<br>
above the first shelf and able to be moved downwardly, suitable means may comprise<br>
a means to move the upper and lower shelves apart. Such means may be generally<br>
conventional as used in lyophilisation processes.<br>
Alternatively the upper and lower shelves may be biased toward the above-<br>
mentioned first position.<br>
When the process of the invention is a lyophilisation process in which the<br>
dispersion is maintained at a temperature such that the carrier liquid is frozen, and<br>
sublimating the liquid directly from the solid to the vapour state under reduced<br>
pressure, at such reduced temperatures an elastomer as used for a vial closure is likely<br>
to become less elastic, hindering the ability of a penetrator to penetrate an elastomer<br>
closure. Therefore it is preferred that the penetrator penetrates such a closure before<br>
the liquid has been frozen by the reduced temperature. The elasticity of the elastomer<br>
material of a vial closure may be employed to move the penetrator back toward a first<br>
position in which the penetrator is outside the container and does not extend through<br>
the penetrable region. The elastic nature of such a closure will tend to close the<br>
penetration hole resulting from the penetration by the penetrator, and will tend to<br>
spring back to eject the penetrator from the closure. The elastomer material of a vial<br>
closure can become less elastic at lower temperatures. Therefore when the process of<br>
the invention is the above-mentioned lyophilisation process it is preferred to allow the<br>
temperature of the closure to rise toward, preferably to, ambient temperature before<br>
withdrawing the penetrator, so that the elasticity of the closure is more effective.<br>
When the evaporation operation is completed the pressure within the container<br>
may be returned to atmospheric by the ingress of a sterilised atmosphere e.g. air or an<br>
inert gas (herein the term "sterile" and derived terms means any reduction of the level<br>
of undesirable matter such as micro-organisms etc. to a level which is acceptable in<br><br>
the field of lyophilised materials such as drugs or vaccines). This is preferably done<br>
before the penetrator is withdrawn so that such an atmosphere may enter the container<br>
via the conduit, and before the elastic closure of a vial has sprung back to close the<br>
puncture hole.<br>
Suitably the apparatus also comprises means to reduce the temperature of the<br>
carrier liquid to a temperature at which it is frozen solid. Such means may comprise a<br>
hermetically sealable refrigerated enclosure in which the container and penetrator, and<br>
suitably the means to cause the penetrator to at least partly penetrate the penetrable<br>
region and the means to withdraw the penetrator from the penetrable region, may be<br>
enclosed.<br>
Suitably the apparatus also comprises means to evaporate the carrier liquid out<br>
of the container via the conduit. Such means may comprise a conventional vacuum<br>
chamber as used in conventional lyophilsation processes to apply reduced<br>
atmospheric pressure to the liquid in its frozen state.<br>
Suitably the apparatus also comprises means to returned the pressure to<br>
atmospheric by the ingress of a sterilised atmosphere when the evaporation operation<br>
is completed.<br>
Suitably the apparatus also comprises means for providing a penetrable region<br>
by forming a puncture hole in the envelope. For example such means may comprise a<br>
hollow filling needle which can be passed through the envelope, for example through<br>
the elastomer closure of a vial, and via which the dispersion may be filled into the<br>
vial, and which can be subsequently withdrawn. Such means may be as discussed<br>
above.<br>
Therefore a preferred sequence of operations for the process of this invention<br>
is firstly to introduce the liquid into the container, then to penetrate the penetrable<br>
region with the penetrator, then to reduce the temperature of the liquid in the<br>
container until it is frozen, then to evaporate the frozen liquid to thereby lyophilise the<br>
content, then to allow the temperature of the closure to rise toward ambient<br>
temperature, then to return the pressure toward atmospheric, then to withdraw the<br>
penetrator.<br>
Preferably in a subsequent step of the process the residual hole through the<br>
penetrable region left by the penetrator is sealed. This may be achieved in various<br>
ways. For example in one way the material of the envelope, e.g. the vial closure, may<br>
be melted e.g. by application of heat or other radiation and allowed to cool and set.<br><br>
Such a process is for example disclosed in US-A-2002/0023409 and WO-A-<br>
2004/026735. Additionally or alternatively a cover means may be attached to the<br>
container to close the site where the penetrator has penetrated the container. Alternate<br>
sealing means may be used, for example fixing a sealing means such as a patch or<br>
fluid substance which subsequently sets, to the penetration site. It may be<br>
advantageous to remove the above-mentioned removable guide, if used, from the<br>
container before this sealing operation. The containers may be transferred by suitable<br>
means such as a conveyor to a station where a sealing operation may be performed to<br>
seal the penetration site.<br>
After sealing the residual hole through the penetrable region left by the<br>
penetrator, if the container is a vial of the type disclosed in WO-A-2004/018317 a<br>
cover part as disclosed therein maybe engaged with the vial to cover the now-sealed<br>
penetrable region.<br>
Suitably the apparatus also comprises means for sealing the residual hole<br>
through the penetrable region left by the penetrator, which may be achieved in various<br>
ways, as discussed above. Such means may comprise a means to direct laser radiation<br>
at the site of the residual hole.<br>
Suitably, if the container is a vial of the type disclosed in WO-A-04/018317<br>
the apparatus may comprise means to engage a cover part with the vial to cover the<br>
sealed penetrable region.<br>
Therefore an overall process of the invention may comprise the steps of:<br>
introducing a dispersion of the material in a carrier liquid into a vial closed by<br>
an elastomer closure by passing a hollow filling needle through the elastomer closure<br>
and introducing the liquid through the needle, then withdrawing the needle to leave a<br>
residual puncture hole through the closure;<br>
penetrating the elastomer closure with a penetrator such that the penetrator<br>
provides a conduit through the envelope to provide communication between the inside<br>
and outside of the container when the penetrator has penetrated the penetrable region;<br>
reducing the temperature of the liquid so that the liquid freezes solid;<br>
evaporating the carrier liquid out of the container via the conduit by means of<br>
reduced atmospheric pressure;<br>
causing the temperature of the elastomer closure to rise toward, preferably to,<br>
ambient and preferably re-pressurising the inside of the vial with a sterile atmosphere;<br>
	withdrawing the penetrator from the penetrable region,<br><br>
then preferably sealing the residual puncture hole.<br>
In a further aspect the invention provides a container suitable for use in a<br>
process or apparatus of the first embodiment as described above, having apenetrator<br>
moveably mounted thereon, e.g. on a vial, the penetrator being moveable reciprocally .<br>
from a first position in which the penetrator is outside the container and does not<br>
penetrate the penetrable region, to a second position in which the penetrator<br>
penetrates the penetrable region such that the penetrator provides a conduit through<br>
the envelope to provide communication between the inside and outside of the<br>
container when the penetrator has penetrated the penetrable region, and preferably<br>
back toward a first position in which the penetrator is outside the container and does<br>
not penetrate the penetrable region.<br>
In this last-mentioned apparatus the penetrator may be as described for the<br>
preceding aspects of the invention, and may be mounted on a guide as described<br>
above. For example in an embodiment particularly suitable for container being a vial,<br>
and the above-mentioned tubular or conical penetrator, the guide may comprise a<br>
generally cylindrical sleeve or part sleeve within which the penetrator is reciprocally<br>
movable.<br>
Suitable and preferred features of such a container having a penetrator<br>
moveably mounted thereon are as discussed above.<br>
The invention also provides the use of such a container having a penetrator<br>
moveably mounted thereon in a process and apparatus of the first and second aspects<br>
of this invention.<br>
The invention will now be described by way of non-limiting example only<br>

Referring to Figs. 1 and 2, a pharmaceutical vial 10 is shown in longitudinal<br>
section, being a vial of the type disclosed in WO-A-04/018317. This vial 10<br><br>
comprises a generally cylindrical body 11 made of a clear plastics material having an<br>
upper mouth 12, which is closed by an elastomer plug closure 13 having an upper<br>
domed region 14. The closure 13 is held in place on the vial body 11 by a plastics<br>
material clamp part 15, which snap fits over the flange 16 of vial body 10. The<br>
combination of vial body 10 and plug closure 13 comprise an envelope as referred to<br>
herein.<br>
The vial 10 contains an aqueous solution 17 of a vaccine material to be<br>
lyophilised after subsequently being frozen into a solid plug by reducing its<br>
temperature. The closure 13 has a puncture hole 18 passing completely through it.<br>
The solution 17 has been previously introduced into vial 10 by a process of radiation<br>
sterilising the interior of the vial 10, passing a hollow filling needle (not shown)<br>
through the closure 13, introducing the solution 17 into the vial 10 via this needle,<br>
then subsequently withdrawing the needle to leave the puncture hole 18. The closure<br>
13 is sufficiently elastic that after the needle has been withdrawn the elastomer<br>
material of the closure springs together to physically close the puncture hole 18 by<br>
compressing the sides of the hole 18 together.<br>
A penetrator 20 is shown moveably mounted on the vial 10. Penetrator 20<br>
comprises a generally hollow conical member with its apex pointing downwardly<br>
toward the upper outer surface of the closure 13. The conical member 20 has an<br>
opening 21 at its apex with a narrowest cross section ca. 2mm, and has an open base<br>
and has a hollow interior. The conical member 20 is moveably mounted on the vial 10<br>
by means of the member 20 being reciprocally moveable within a cylindrical guide 30<br>
which is removeably mounted on the clamp part 15, by means of the guide 30 having<br>
a snap fit bead 31 adjacent its lower end which can snap-fit engage with a groove 19<br>
in the outer surface of the clamp part 15. To facilitate the reciprocal movement of the<br>
member 20 within the guide 30 the member 20 is integrally provided with an outer<br>
collar 22 which is a close conforming sliding fit inside guide 30.<br>
The penetrator 20 can be moved reciprocally from a first position seen in Fig.<br>
1 in which the penetrator 20 is outside the vial 10 and does not at least partly<br>
penetrate the penetrable region 14 of the closure 13. In this position the penetrator 20<br>
is resting on the upper surface of the part 14, adjacent to the puncture hole 18. The<br>
penetrator 20 is moveable from this first position to a second position seen in Fig. 2 in<br>
which the apex of the penetrator 20 at least partly penetrates the penetrable region 14<br>
of the closure 12.<br><br>
The penetrator 20 has been moved from the first position shown in Fig. 1 into<br>
the second position seen in Fig. 2 by means of the member 40 which is situated above<br>
the assembly of vial 10, penetrator 20 and guide 30. In practice plural vials 10 are<br>
arranged in a two dimensional array on a first shelf 50, and further shelves of vials 10<br>
(not shown) are stacked vertically shelf 50. The member 40 comprises part of a<br>
vertically adjacent shelf which bears upon the penetrator 20 to urge the penetrator 20<br>
into the second position shown in Fig. 2. This may be achieved by loading the shelves<br>
40,50 into a rack (not shown) which supports them with a vertical spacing to achieve<br>
this. The collar 22 of penetrator 20 has an upper part 23 with apertures 24 therein in<br>
communication with apertures (not shown) in guide 30. A barrier membrane 25 which<br>
is permeable to gases but obstructs the passage of particles is provided across the open<br>
base of the conical member 20. Additionally the upper rim of part 23 may be<br>
castellated.<br>
As is seen in Fig. 2 in this position the pointed apex of the penetrator 20 has<br>
partly penetrated the domed upper part 14 of the closure 13 by forcing open the<br>
puncture hole 18, and forcing apart the parts of the elastomer of the closure<br>
immediately adjacent to the puncture hole 18. These adjacent elastomer parts 110 are<br>
forced toward the interior of the vial 10. In the position shown in Fig. 2 the opening<br>
21 and the hollow interior of the conical member 20 and apertures 24 comprise a<br>
conduit between the interior of the vial 10 and the exterior.<br>
In the configuration shown in Fig. 2 the assembly of vial 10, penetrator 20 and<br>
guide 30 have been cooled to a temperature which maintains the solution 17 frozen<br>
solid and then exposed to a reduced atmospheric pressure. The carrier liquid of<br>
solution 17 has evaporated by sublimation, its vapour escaping through the conduit<br>
formed by the opening 21 and the hollow interior of the conical member 20 and<br>
apertures 24, until the vaccine dissolved therein is left as a lyophilised solid 111.<br>
When the lyophilisation process is completed the interior of the vial 10 can be<br>
re-pressurised by allowing a sterile gas such as air to enter the vial.<br>
The shelf 40 is then raised, i.e. to a position corresponding to Fig. 1. The<br>
elasticity of the elastomer material of the closure 13 is employed to move the<br>
penetrator 20 back toward a first position corresponding to Fig. 1. The elastic nature<br>
of the closure tends to close the penetration hole seen in Fig. 2 resulting from the<br>
penetration by the penetrator 20 and tends to force the penetrator 20 toward the<br>
position shown in Fig. 1. The force applied to the penetrator 20 and the restraint of<br><br>
movement of the penetrator 20 by the upper shelf 40 maintains the penetrator 20 in<br>
the position shown in Fig. 2 extending through the elastic closure 13. When the shelf<br>
40 is raised away from the penetrator 20 this force and restraint is released and the<br>
elasticity of the closure 13 springs the penetrator back into the first position as shown<br>
in Fig. 1. Also the elasticity of the closure 13 physically closes the puncture hole 18.<br>
Thereafter the guide 30 may be detached from the vial 10. The residual hole<br>
18 through the closure 13 may be sealed, which may for example be achieved by the<br>
known process of directing a beam of laser radiation at the puncture hole 18 to melt<br>
the adjacent elastomer material and subsequently allow the molten material to set and<br>
seal the puncture site. A cover part (not shown) may then be engaged with the clamp<br>
part 15 to cover the now-sealed penetrable region 18.<br>
An alternative construction (not shown) of penetrator 20 may have a conical<br>
member 20 with a pointed apex, but with one or more external concavity e.g. groove<br>
which when the member 20 is in a position corresponding to Fig. 2, form a conduit<br>
between the sides of the hole 18 and the penetrator 20 through which the carrier liquid<br>
of the solution 17 can escape.<br>
Figs. 3A to 3M schematically show an overall process.<br>
In Fig. 3 A an empty vial 10 with its closure 13 and clamp part 15 is shown, its<br>
interior being sterile as a result of radiation sterilisation or sterile manufacture.<br>
In Fig. 3B a filling needle 60 is passed through closure 13, creating a puncture<br>
hole 18, and the solution 17 of a material to be lyophilised is introduced into vial 10<br>
via needle 60.<br>
In Fig. 3C the filling needle 60 has been withdrawn from the closure 13,<br>
leaving the residual puncture hole 18, which is closed by the adjacent elastomer<br>
material of closure 13 springing back under its elasticity.<br>
In Fig. 3D the penetrator 20, the guide 30 and the membrane 25 are<br>
assembled. Fig. 3D shows a guide 30 which is a part cylindrical sleeve comprising an<br>
upper ring-shaped frame 32 and lower resilient snap-fit legs 33.<br>
In Figs. 3E and 3F a fitting tool 70 is used to engage the combination of<br>
penetrator 20 and guide 30 with the vial 10 containing the solution 17.<br>
In Fig. 3G the fitting tool 70 has been disengaged from the assembly 20,30,<br>
and the vial 10 plus the assembly 20,30 has been arranged on a lower tray 50, with an<br>
upper tray 40 spaced vertically above with a similar array of vials 10 (not shown)<br>
thereon. The penetrator 20 is resting on the top of the closure 13.<br><br>
In Fig. 3H the shelf 40 is lowered relative to he lower shelf 50, and bears on<br>
the penetrator 20, as in Fig. 2. The penetrator 20 at least partly penetrates closure 13,<br>
elastically forcing back the elastomer material of the closure adjacent the puncture<br>
hole 18.<br>
In Fig. 31 with shelves 40,50 in the same configuration as in Fig. 3H the<br>
temperature has been reduced so that the solution 17 is frozen solid.<br>
In Fig. 3J the frozen solution 17 has been exposed at the reduced temperature<br>
to a reduced atmospheric pressure so that the vapour of the frozen liquid of the<br>
solution 17 sublimates out through the penetrator 20 to leave the material as a dry<br>
lyophilised solid 111.<br>
In Fig. 3K the lyophilisation process is complete, all the liquid has sublimed<br>
from the frozen solution 17, the vial has been re-pressurised with a sterile atmosphere<br>
e.g. nitrogen, and the temperature of the vial 10 and its closure has been allowed to<br>
rise to ambient. Shelf 40 has been lifted from its position of bearing on penetrator 20<br>
so that the elasticity of the closure 13 springs the penetrator 20 upwards toward the<br>
first position.<br>
The steps shown in Figs 3G to 3K may take place inside a generally<br>
conventional lyophilisation freeze-drier, and the lowering and raising of shelves 40<br>
may be performed by generally conventional machinery.<br>
In Fig. 3L the assembly 20,30 has been disengaged from vial 10. A de-fitting<br>
tool (not shown) may be used for this purpose, and conveniently the vials 10 have a<br>
lower flange 112 allowing a holding means (not shown) to hold the vial down against<br>
the upward pulling force of such a de-fitting tool. The elasticity of closure 13 again<br>
causes the puncture hole 18 to close.<br>
In Fig. 3M a laser beam 80 has been directed at the elastomer material<br>
adjacent to puncture hole 18 to seal this hole, as described above.<br>
From Fig. 3 it can be seen that at no time after the vial 10 has been filled until<br>
the vial 10 is in the lyophilisation chamber is the vial 10 open to the environment<br>
where it might be contaminated. Also the vials as at Fig. 3C may be inspected for<br>
particulate contamination without fear of further contamination, as the elasticity of the<br>
closure 13 holds the puncture hole 18 closed.<br>
Suitable conveyors etc. may be used to transport the vials 10 through this<br>
process, and suitable automatic machinery may be used to assemble the parts 20,30<br>
and to engage this assembly with the vials 10. The stack of shelves 40,50 may be<br><br>
moved up and down vertically by known means, e.g. hydraulically. The parts 20, 30<br>
may be re-usable after suitable cleaning and sterilisation.<br>
Figs. 4 and 5 illustrate a process of the second embodiment and a suitable<br>
apparatus. Referring to Fig. 4 plural vials 10 of the type disclosed in WO-A-<br>
04/018317 are shown. The vials 10 are situated on an upward facing surface 40 of a<br>
lower shelf 41. The surface 40 is provided with centering plugs 42, typically cones,<br>
which fit into a corresponding socket in the base of vials 10 to securely locate the<br>
vials 10 in a predetermined position on shelf 40. There is a vertically adjacent upper<br>
shelf 43. Shelves 41,43 are made of metal, e.g. stainless steel. Extending from the<br>
lower surface 44 of upper shelf 43 are plural penetrators 45A, 45B, 45C, 45D, 45E.<br>
Each penetrator 45 A, 45B, 45C, 45D, 45E comprises a generally conical member with<br>
its apex pointing downwardly from the lower surface 44 of the upper shelf 43 toward<br>
the lower shelf 40. Penetrators 45A,45B,45C,45D and 45E are each a hollow cone<br>
with a hole 46 adjacent its apex, with an open base such that its apex may penetrate<br>
the penetrable region of closure 13 of a vial 10 and vapour of the carrier liquid may<br>
enter the apex, pass through the hollow interior of the cone and exit via the open base<br>
analogously as described above. Penetrators 45A,45B and 45E are shown in section to<br>
illustrate their construction. Penetrators 45A,45B,45C,45D and 45E are made<br>
integrally of metal with the upper shelf. Above and in contact with the upper surface<br>
47 of shelf 43 is a sterile filter sheet 48 which can allow gases to pass through but<br>
prevents passage of particles, and filter sheet 48 is itself held in place by an upper<br>
plate 49 with apertures passing through corresponding to the positions of the open<br>
bases of the penetrators 45A-E. In Fig. 4 A penetrators 4A-C are in a first position in<br>
which the penetrators 4A-C are outside vials 10 and do not penetrate the closures 13<br>
of vials 10. In Fig. 4A the penetrators 45B,45C are in a position analogous to the<br>
penetrators 20 in Fig.3 G.<br>
Fig. 4B shows how upper shelf 43 is moved downwardly relative to lower<br>
shelf 41 into a second position in which penetrator 45D penetrates the closure 13 of<br>
vial 10. In this position the hollow interior of the penetrator 45D allows vapour of<br>
frozen carrier liquid to escape from vial 10 via hole 46 and the open base of the cone.<br>
In Fig. 4B the penetrator 45D is in a position analogous to the penetrator 20 in Fig.<br>
3H-3J.<br>
Fig. 4C shows how the upper shelf 43 is then returned back into a first position<br>
in which the penetrator 45E is outside the vial 10 and does not penetrate the closure<br><br>
13. In Figs. 4B and 4C the filter 48 and plate 49 are omitted for clarity. In Fig. 4C the<br>
penetrator 45E is in a position analogous to penetrators 20 in Fig.3G.<br>
Referring to Fig. 5 an arrangement of a lower shelf 41 with vials 10 thereon<br>
i.e. as shown in Fig, 4 is shown. In Fig. 5A the upper shelf 43 is raised so that<br>
penetrators 45 are in their first position, i.e. as in Fig. 4A and 4C. In Fig. 5B the upper<br>
shelf 43 is in its lower position so that penetrators 45 are in their second position as<br>
shown in Fig. 4B. The upper and lower shelves 41,43 are biased into this second<br>
position as shown in Fig. 5 A by springs 50 positioned within telescoping tubular<br>
housings 51,52. In Fig 5B springs 50 are in their compressed state. In the arrangement<br>
shown in Figs. 4 and 5 vials 10 may be positioned on the lower shelf 41 with the<br>
upper shelf 43 absent, then the upper shelf 43 may be positioned over lower shelf 41.<br>
The telescoping spring housings 51,52 help to position the penetrators 45 over vials<br>
10 and guide the penetrators 45 toward vials 10 as the upper shelf 43 is lowered<br>
toward the lower shelf 41 against the bias of springs 50. The upper shelf 43 may be<br>
held in the position shown in Fig. 5B against the bias of springs 50 during the step of<br>
evaporating the frozen carrier liquid out of the vials 10 by a suitable means e.g. a stop.<br>
Referring to Fig. 6 the upper shelf 43 has an upward facing surface 60 on<br>
which are situated plural vials 10 in a manner analogous to that in Figs. 4 and 5.<br>
Vertically adjacent to this upper shelf 43 there is a further upper shelf 61 which<br>
comprises plural penetrators 451 above this upward facing surface. The shelves 43<br>
and 61 are biased apart by springs 62 positioned within telescoping tubular housings<br>
63,64 in a manner analogous to Fig. 5. This further upper shelf 61 may be moved<br>
downwardly toward shelf 43 analogously to the way shelf 43 may be moved<br>
downwardly toward lower shelf 41 as described above with reference to Fig. 5. The<br>
further upper shelf 61 may itself have an upward facing surface 65 on which are<br>
situated plural vials (not shown), so that plural such shelves may be stacked vertically<br>
relative to each other.<br>
The arrangement shown in Figs. 4-6 can be used in a process analogous to Fig.<br>
3. Vials 10 containing a solution of a material to be lyophilised may be positioned on<br>
lower shelf 41 and upper shelf 43 may be positioned as shown in Figs. 4A and 5 A.<br>
Upper shelf 43 may then be lowered, e.g. against the bias of springs 50, into the<br>
position as shown in Figs. 4B and 5B so that penetrators 45 penetrate the closures 13<br>
of vials 10. The carrier liquid in the vials 10 may then be frozen by exposure to<br>
reduced temperature. The frozen carrier liquid may then be evaporated out of vials 10<br><br>
via the penetrators 45. The vials 10 may then be re-pressurised with a sterile<br>
atmosphere such as nitrogen and their temperature allowed to rise toward ambient.<br>
Then the upper shelf 43 may be raised relative to the lower shelf 41 so that the shelves<br>
43,41 are in the position shown in Fig. AC and 5A.<br>
Thereafter the vials 10 may be removed from lower shelf 41 and the residual<br>
puncture hole 18 in the closure 13 sealed with a focused laser beam as in Fig. 3M<br>
The process and apparatus illustrated in Figs. 3,4, 5 and 6 is suitably<br>
respectively performed and located inside a sterile enclosure the temperature of which<br>
can be controlled between ambient and a temperature at which the carrier liquid is<br>
frozen, and the atmospheric pressure of which can be controlled between ambient and<br>
a reduced atmospheric pressure.<br>
Referring to Figs. 1, 8 and 9 a combination 70 of a penetrator 71 and a guide<br>
72 is shown, in Figs. 8 and 9 being shown mounted on a vial 10. The penetrator 71, as<br>
seen more clearly in Figs. 8 and 9 comprises a generally conical member 73, with a<br>
hollow interior 74 and an opening 75 at its apex. The apex of this conical shaped<br>
member is adapted to penetrate a penetrable region, being puncture hole 18 in an<br>
elastomeric closure 13 of vial 10. The penetrable region of the closure 80 comprises a<br>
residual puncture hole (not shown) which has been made by a filling needle (not<br>
shown) used to introduce a liquid content (not shown) for lyophilisation into the vial<br>
81.<br>
The guide 72 comprises a generally cylindrical sleeve within which the<br>
penetrator 71 is mounted. As shown in Fig. 8 the penetrator 71 is in its first position,<br>
with the apex 75 of the conical penetrator 73 pointed downwards as seen, the<br>
penetrator 71 not penetrating the closure 13, and with ca. 1mm space between the<br>
apex 75 of the penetrator 71 and the upper (as seen) surface of the closure 13.<br>
The penetrator 71 and guide 72 are made integrally of plastics material, and<br>
are so made initially linked by plural (six are shown there may be more or less) thin<br>
frangible integral links 76 with the penetrator in its first position as shown in Fig. 8.<br>
As shown in Fig. 9 the penetrator 71 has been moved analogously as shown in<br>
Figs. 1 and 2 towards a second position so that the penetrator 71 thereby penetrates<br>
the closure 13, opening the residual puncture hole 18. Severance of the links 76<br>
occurs. The liquid content of vial 10 is not shown in Figs. 8 and 9.<br>
The penetrator 71 has an upper rim with openings 77 corresponding to the<br>
vents 24 of Fig. 1. The guide 72 is removably mounted on vial 10 by a snap-fit<br><br>
connection analogous to that of Fig. 1, using the resilient fingers 78 which engage<br>
with the groove 19 of vial 10. A barrier membrane analogous to that 25 of Fig. 1<br>
which is permeable to gases but obstructs the passage of particles may be provided<br>
across the open base of the conical member 73.<br>
Referring to Figs. 10,11 and 12 a penetrator 100 is shown mounted on a vial<br>
10 of the type previously shown. Penetrator 100 comprises a generally conical<br>
member 101 analogous to the penetrators exemplified above, and made of plastics<br>
material by means of injection moulding. The penetrator 100 is mounted on the clamp<br>
part 15 of the vial 10 by means of a snap fit engagement. This snap-fit engagement is<br>
provided by a skirt 102 extending in the cone base-apex direction and surrounding the<br>
conical member 101, the skirt 102 having snap-fit engagement fingers 103 means<br>
adjacent the rim furthest from the cone base which engage, as above, with a groove on<br>
the clamp part 15. The conduit 104 through the conical member 101 of the penetrator<br>
is closed by a barrier membrane 108 e.g. as shown across the open base of the hollow<br>
conical interior which allows gases to pass through but not particulate contaminants.<br>
The barrier membrane prevents the ingress of contaminants into the interior of the vial<br>
10 through the conduit 104 of the penetrator 100.<br>
As shown in Figs. 10,11 and 12 the penetrator 100 is mounted on the vial 10<br>
in a position in which the penetrator is penetrating the residual puncture hole (not<br>
shown) in the elastomeric closure 13 of the vial 10 in a manner analogous to the<br>
above. The mounting is achieved by means of mounting tool 105 bearing downwards<br>
upon the penetrator 100 to operate the snap-fit engagement.<br>
With the penetrator 100 and vial 10 in the configuration shown in Fig. 11,<br>
frozen liquid content (not shown) in vial 10 can be evaporated out through the conduit<br>
104, as above.<br>
When the evaporation is complete the penetrator 100 is removed from the vial<br>
10. This is achieved as shown in Fig. 12 by means of a removal tool 106 which bears<br>
upon the upwardly extending part of pivot lever 107, the operation of which in<br>
relation to one of the fingers 103 is shown, to thereby disengage the snap-fit<br>
engagement. The elasticity of the closure 13 can then spring the penetrator out of its<br>
penetrating relationship with the closure 13.<br><br>
