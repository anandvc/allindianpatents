COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10) DRY CLEANING PROCESS<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The  following  specification   particularly  describes  the  nature  of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
WO 03/038179<br><br>
PCT/EP02/U723<br><br>
1                        Dry cleaning process<br>
The present invention relates to a dry cleaning process, in particular for cleaning articles like laundry articles and a S  dry cleaning composition for use in said process.<br>
In dry cleaning the laundry articles are usually immersed in or washed with solvent liquids. Applications involving one or more stages of immersion, rinsing and/or drying are known. Solvents 0  can be used at ambient temperature or at elevated temperatures up to the boiling point of the solvent.<br>
Traditionally, dry cleaning is predominantly performed by small private enterprises and the cleaning performance of the dry<br>
5  cleaning compositions per se is often poor. In practice, reasonable cleaning can only be achieved by extensively pretreating the garments which is rather time consuming and inefficient. For example, particulate soil is a common type of stain that is difficult to clean using dry cleaning only<br>
:0  without extensive manual pretreatment.<br>
The solvents used in traditional dry cleaning are chlorinated solvents such as chlorocarbons such as perchloroethylene and chlorofluorocarbons such as 1,1,2,-trichloro-1,2,2-<br>
&gt;5  trifluoroethane either alone or in admixture with one or more cosolvents such as aliphatic alcohols or other low molecular weight, polar compounds. The conventional dry cleaning process often employs perchloroethylene (perc) as the main dry cleaning solvent. One of the major advantages of perchloroethylene is<br>
30  that the solvent itself shows an effective cleaning performance on oily stains. Accordingly, the conventional dry cleaning compositions processes are adapted to this cleaning effect.<br><br>
WO 03/038179<br><br>
PCT/EP02/11723<br><br>
2                          However, since many of these organic solvents pose<br>
environmental problems such as ozone depletion their use is<br>
heavily debated. Liquid carbon dioxide has also been suggested<br>
as an alternative solvent. The most important drawback of this<br>
5  inorganic solvent however, is that expensive high pressure<br>
equipment is needed to perform dry cleaning in liquid carbon<br>
dioxide. A novel and more promising class of dry cleaning<br>
solvents are the so called non-flammable, non-chlorine<br>
containing organic solvents. Examples include siloxanes, and<br>
10  fluorinated solvents like hydrofluoroethers such as<br>
nonafluoromethoxybutane and nonafluoroethoxybutane or hydrofluorocarbons as decafluoropentane. These novel solvents have been claimed to be non-ozone depleting and to have far smaller coefficients of global warming.<br>
15<br>
WO 00/36206 discloses a dry cleaning composition comprising hydrofluoroether, 1-30 wt.% of a nonionic fluorosurfactant and less than 1 wt.% water. JP 11140499 discloses a dry cleaning composition comprising hydrofluoroether, 0 percent water and 10<br>
20  and up to 90 wt.% of salt of a fluoralkyl phosphate surfactant. US 6 127 430 discloses a composition comprising from 0.1 to 99 parts by weight of hydrofluoroether and from 99.9 to 1 parts by weight of "water  the sum of a and b equalling 100 parts and certain fluorinated surfactants. WO 97/22683 (3M) discloses a<br>
25  dry cleaning composition comprising hydrofluoroether and 0.1<br>
wt.% of a nonionic surfactant like fluoralkyl sulphon amide. US 5 610 128 discloses compositions with perfluoroalkylamine salts of octylphenyl acid phosphate.<br>
30  However, this new class of non-flammable, non-chlorine containing organic dry cleaning solvents has one major drawback. While having less environmental drawbacks dry cleaning with these new solvents still show an inadequate<br><br>

3                                   cleaning performance. These solvents are typically poor<br>
solvents and show little or no cleaning activity on stained and<br>
soiled laundry. For example, common stains are notoriously<br>
difficult to remove with fluorinated solvents. A desirable dry<br>
5  cleaning composition should not only clean all kinds of stains<br>
satisfactorily but also provide optimal garment care. For<br>
example, a reduction in wrinkles would decrease the need for<br>
ironing. With respect to garment care especially colour care is<br>
a notorious problem since many dyes are vulnerable to dry<br>
10  cleaning compositions. Dry cleaning is not suitable for many clothes simply because the dye is not compatible with the dry cleaning composition. On the other hand, certain compositions needed to clean tougher stains may have adverse effects on garment care such as colour care. Therefore, there is a need<br>
15  for novel dry cleaning processes and compositions that deliver effective cleaning and/or garment care even with this new class of dry cleaning solvents.<br>
According to a first aspect of the invention an improved 20  process for dry cleaning laundry is provided comprising at<br>
least one dry cleaning step followed by at least one<br>
regeneration step wherein said regeneration step comprises<br>
contacting the articles with, a raganeration composition,<br>
comprising 25  0 to 10 wt.% of a surfactant;<br>
0.001 to 10 wt. of water;<br>
0 to 50 wt.% of a cosolvent and<br>
the balance being organic dry cleaning solvent, preferably a<br>
non-flammable, non-chlorine containing organic dry cleaning 30  solvent,<br>
wherein the regeneration composition comprises an aqueous phase<br>
having a pH of at least 5.<br><br>

4                                          The inventive process according to this aspect of the invention<br>
shows surprisingly good garment care, colour care and/or<br>
effective cleaning for a variety of stains. One of the<br>
unexpected advantages is that now a wider variety of dry<br>
5  cleaning compositions can be used because the inventive process<br>
minimises adverse effects on garment care.<br>
These and other aspects, features and advantages will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art from a reading<br>

PCT/EP02/11723<br><br>
5                          Detailed description of the invention<br>
Definitions<br>
The term -"dry cleaning process" used herein is intended to mean<br>
any process wherein laundry articles are contacted with a dry<br>
5  cleaning composition within a closable vessel wherein the dry cleaning composition is substantially non-aqueous, i.e., it preferably comprises at least 50 wt.%, more preferably at least 80 wt.%, even more preferably at least 85 wt.% of a dry cleaning solvent. This term is used interchangeably with the LO  term "a process for dry cleaning laundry articles". However, as used herein this term does not include any process wherein the fabric articles are also immersed and rinsed in an aqueous cleaning composition of more than 80 wt% water. This would defy the purpose of the dry cleaning. .5  The term "dry cleaning composition" as used herein is intended to mean the composition used in the dry cleaning process including the dry cleaning solvent, any surfactant, cleaning and/or care agents but excluding the fabric articles that are to be cleaned. To avoid any doubt, this term encompasses the<br>
0  non-aqueous as well as the low aqueous dry cleaning composition.<br>
The term "organic dry cleaning solvent" as used herein is intended to mean any non-aqueous solvent, that preferably has.a liquid phase at 20°C and standard pressure. The term organic<br>
5  has its usual meaning, i.e., a compound with at least one carbon hydrogen bond. When the amount of the dry cleaning solvent is described as "the balance" it is not intended to exclude other (optional) ingredients that may be used. It is simply meant to describe that the main body of the dry cleaning<br>
0  composition is dry cleaning solvent, i.e., the dry cleaning solvent comprises more than 50 wt.% of the dry cleaning composition by weight of the dry cleaning composition.<br><br>
WO 03/038179<br><br>
PCT/EP02/11723<br><br>
6                                          The term "immerse" as used herein is intended to mean that the<br>
fabric article is contacted with a sufficient amount of dry<br>
cleaning composition to wet the whole fabric article.<br>
The water content refers to water purposefully added to the<br>
5  laundry articles, for example as part of the dry cleaning<br>
composition as such or a pretreatment composition including<br>
hydrated water as part of other (cleaning or care) ingredients<br>
making up these compositions. It is not intended to include the<br>
moisture of the untreated wash load e.g., a wet towel.<br>
10<br>
Process of dry cleaning<br>
Generally, articles such as clothing are cleaned by contacting a sufficient amount of the dry cleaning composition according to one aspect of the invention with the articles for a<br>
15  sufficient period of time to clean the articles or otherwise<br>
remove stains. The amount of dry cleaning composition used and the amount of time the composition contacts the article can vary based on equipment and the number of articles being cleaned. Normally, the process of dry cleaning will comprise at<br>
20  least the step of contacting the article with low aqueous dry cleaning composition according the second aspect of the invention and at least one step of rinsing the article with a fresh load of solvent. The rinse composition will usually comprise of mainly solvent but garment care or cleaning agents<br>
25  may be added as desired. The liquid to cloth ratio (w/w) is usually such that the laundry will normally be immersed at least partly and sometimes even totally in the dry cleaning composition during the dry cleaning process.<br>
30  According to the first aspect of the invention, it was found that effective garment care could be provided by including a regeneration step in the dry cleaning process. Thus, according this aspect of tne present invention, one preferred process of<br><br>

PCT/EP02/11723<br><br>
7                                          cleaning comprises at least one regeneration step wherein<br>
said regeneration step comprises contacting the articles with a<br>
regeneration composition comprising<br>
0 to 10 wt.% of a surfactant;<br>
5  0.001 to 10 wt. of water;<br>
0 to 50 wt.% of a cosolvent and<br>
the balance being organic dry cleaning solvent, preferably a<br>
non-flammable, non-chlorine containing organic dry cleaning<br>
solvent,<br>
10  wherein the regeneration composition comprises an aqueous phase<br>
having a pK of at least 5.<br>
The desired pH in the aqueous phase can be achieved in manners known in the art such as using a sufficient amount of an<br>
15  inorganic or organic base and/or acid. The amount of base<br>
and/or acid will usually depend on the ratio of aqueous phase to non-aqueous phase, the number and nature of the articles and the pH of the aqueous phase of the primary low aqueous dry cleaning composition, but can be determined by the skilled<br>
20  person. In general, the regeneration composition will comprise 0 to 80 wt.%, preferably 0.001 to 70 wt.% of an inorganic or organic base and/or acid, more preferably 0.01 to 50 wt.% or even more preferably 0.1 to, 40 wt.% by .weight, of..the.; .aq^ae©®^ ■'■ phase. The pH is preferably at least 7, more preferably at<br>
25  least 8, or most preferably at least 8.5. Preferably, a<br>
suitable organic or inorganic buffer is used to maintain the appropriate pH.<br>
Suitable bases and/or acids are selected from bases and/or 30  acids that are compatible with the organic dry cleaning<br>
composition and show no adverse effects to the articles to be cleaned. Organic and inorganic bases and/or acids are for example listed in the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics,<br><br>
WO 03/038179<br><br>
PCT/EP02/11723<br><br>
8                                                        81st ed, p 8-44 to 8-56. Preferred bases and/or acids include<br>
compounds comprising at least one hydroxide, amine,<br>
carboxylate, carbonate, citrate, borate, sulphate, phosphate<br>
group and mixtures thereof. Preferred compounds are for<br>
5  example, soda ash, KOH, NaOH, HC1.<br>
The water content of the regeneration composition will generally be from 0.01 to 5 wt.% or preferably from 0.05 to 3 wt.% or most preferably from 0.1 to 1 wt.% by weight of the 10  total dry cleaning composition.<br>
The amount of surfactant in the regeneration composition may be from at least 0.001 wt.% up to and including 10 wt.% by weight of the dry cleaning composition. More preferably, the 15  surfactant is present from 0.01 up to and including 3 wt.% or even more preferably from 0.05 up to and including 0.9 wt.% by weight of the dry cleaning composition. However, in some cases no surfactant may be present at all.<br>
20  Prior to the regeneration step the articles may be contacted one or more times with one or more dry cleaning compositions. This may be any dry cleaning composition known in the art. A preferably dry cleaning; composition comprises an effective amount of surfactant;<br>
25  0 to 50 wt.% of a cosolvent and<br>
the balance being an organic dry cleaning solvent, preferably a non-flammable, non-chlorine containing organic dry cleaning solvent. The dry cleaning compositions may be non-aqueous or low-aqueous.<br>
30		<br>
Thus, the dry cleaning process may comprise at least one non¬aqueous dry cleaning step prior to the regeneration step, wherein<br><br>

9                                                           said articles are contacted with a non-aqueous dry cleaning<br>
composition said<br>
non-aqueous dry cleaning composition comprising<br>
0..001 to.. 1Q wt.% of a surfactant;<br>
0 to 0.01 wt.% of water;<br>
0 to 50 wt.% of a cosolvent and<br>
the balance being an organic dry cleaning solvent, preferably a<br>
non-flammable, non-chlorine containing organic dry cleaning<br>
solvent;<br>
Alternatively, the dry cleaning process may comprise at least<br>
one low aqueous dry cleaning step prior to the regeneration<br>
step, wherein<br>
said articles are contacted with a low aqueous dry cleaning<br>
composition said low aqueous dry cleaning composition<br>
comprising<br>
0.001 to 70 wt.% of a surfactant;<br>
0.01 to 10 wt.% of water;<br>
0 to 50 wt.% of a cosolvent and<br>
the balance being an organic dry cleaning solvent, preferably a<br>
non-flammable, non-chlorine containing organic dry cleaning<br>
solvent.<br>
Usually at least one rinsing step will be included, wherein the<br>
articles are contacted with a rinse composition said<br>
rinse composition comprising<br>
0 to 0.0001 wt.% of a surfactant;<br>
0 to 10 wt.% of water;<br>
0 to 50 wt.% of a cosolvent and<br>
the -balance being an organic dry cleaning solvent, preferably a<br>
non-flammable, non-chlorine containing organic dry cleaning<br>
solvent.<br><br>

10<br>
The regeneration step may precede but will often follow or<br>
replace the rinsing step. Preferably, if the dry cleaning process involves any additional step after the regeneration step, these additional steps will have a pH of 5 or higher." 5<br>
Depending on the desired cleaning, the low aqueous and non¬aqueous compositions may be used in any order. However, in many cases it will be preferred to contact the articles with a non¬aqueous composition prior to a low aqueous dry cleaning 10  composition.<br>
An especially suitable process for dry cleaning laundry comprises contacting  articles with the non-aqueous  composition, then low aqueous composition and followed by the regeneration 15  composition. This process delivers excellent cleaning of a<br>
variety of stains while providing optimal garment and colour care.<br>
The dry cleaning process may comprise different steps in any 20  order depending on the desired outcome. The number and length of steps for e.g., cleaning, rinsing, conditioning steps may depend on the desired outcome. Each step may preferably last from at least0.1 min or preferably at' lea"st"0.5"min or more preferably at least 1 min or even 5 min, and at most 2 hrs, 25  preferably at most 30 min, even more preferably at most 20 min and in some instances at most 5 min. In some cases longer times may be desired for example overnight.<br>
Generally, the laundry articles in need of treatment will be 30  placed inside a closable vessel. It will be clear that the<br>
process is also suitable for cleaning one laundry article at the time although it will often be more efficient to clean more articles at the same time. Preferably, the vessel is a<br><br>
;   WO 03/038179<br><br>
PCT/EP02/11723<br><br>
11                                     rotatable drum as part of an automated dry cleaning machine<br>
that is closed or sealed in such a way that the dry cleaning<br>
solvent can be contained within the machine if needed. Inside<br>
the vessel, the laundry articles are then contacted with the<br>
5  dry cleaning composition. This may be done in any way known in<br>
the art such as spraying or even using mist.<br>
In some cases it may be useful to formulate the dry cleaning composition in situ in the drum by contacting the different<br>
10  ingredients of the dry cleaning composition separately with the laundry articles. For example - when the dry cleaning composition comprises dry cleaning solvent, water and surfactant - first water, then surfactant followed by the dry cleaning solvent. Or first the dry cleaning solvent, followed<br>
15  by the surfactant and then water. Or any other order.<br>
Alternatively, 2 or more of the ingredients may be premixed before they are contacted with the laundry articles. For example, water and surfactant may be premixed and this premix 20  is then contacted with the laundry followed by the dry cleaning solvent. In the alternate, dry cleaning solvent and surfactant may be premixed and this premix is then contacted with the laundry fallowed.,by. water.<br>
25  Thus, in one preferred aspect, in situ formulation of the dry cleaning composition may also be provided by incorporating one or more ingredients of the dry cleaning composition into a pretreatment composition, pretreating the laundry articles with the pretreatment composition, contacting the laundry articles<br>
30  with the remaining ingredients of the dry cleaning composition thereby formulating the dry cleaning composition in situ. This pretreatment may take place manually outside the drum or mechanically inside the drum as part of a pretreatment step.<br><br><br>

PCT/EP02/11723<br><br>
12                                             The pretreatment step per se need not be immersive, i.e., it<br>
may be limited to treating the stained areas only provided that<br>
when the-laundry articles are contacted all the ingredients<br>
making up the final dry cleaning composition, the laundry<br>
5  articles are immersed in said dry cleaning composition. For<br>
example - when the dry cleaning composition comprises of dry<br>
cleaning solvent, water and surfactant - stained areas of the<br>
laundry articles may be pre-treated with a premix of water and<br>
surfactant manually or by an automated process. After<br>
10  sufficient pretreatment time is allowed, the laundry articles may be contacted in the drum with the remaining ingredients such as in this case, the dry cleaning solvent (and optionally the remaining amounts of water, surfactant and cleaning agent) to result in situ in the dry cleaning composition according to<br>
15  this aspect of the invention. The pretreatment time will be at least 5 sec but could be less than 1 day, preferably less than 1 hr, more preferably less than 30 min. The pretreatment composition may be formulated to treat specific stains. For example sufficient amounts of protease and other enzymes may be<br>
20  included to treat proteinacious stains.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the complete dry cleaning composition is premixed" in a separate preircrx* compartment. For example, when the dry cleaning composition comprises dry<br>
25  cleaning solvent, surfactant and water, these may be premixed in a separate compartment before the dry cleaning composition is contacted with the laundry article. Preferably such a premix is in the form of an emulsion or microemulsion. Forming a premix of for example a water-in-oil emulsion can be<br>
30  brought about by any number of suitable procedures. For<br>
example, the aqueous phase containing an effective amount of surfactant package can be contacted with the solvent phase by metered injection just prior to a suitable mixing device.<br><br>

13                                Metering is preferably maintained such that the desired<br>
solvent/water ratio remains relatively constant. Mixing devices<br>
such as pump assemblies or in-line static mixers, a centrifugal<br>
pump or other type of pump, a colloid mill or other type of<br>
5  mill, a rotary mixer, an ultrasonic mixer and other means of<br>
dispersing one liquid in another, non-miscible liquid can be<br>
used to provide sufficient agitation to cause emulsification.<br>
These static mixers are devices through which the emulsion is 10  passed at high speed and in which said emulsion experiences sudden changes in direction and/or in the diameter of the channels which make up the interior of the mixers. This results in a pressure loss, which is a factor in obtaining a correct emulsion in terms of droplet size and stability. 15<br>
In one variant of the method of the invention, the mixing steps are for example sequential. The procedure consists of mixing the solvent and emulsifier in a first stage, the premix being mixed and emulsified with the water in a second stage. 20<br>
In another variant of the method of the invention, provision is made for carrying out the above steps in a continuous mode.<br>
The premix may take place at room temperature, which is also 25  the temperature of the fluids and raw materials used.<br>
A. batch process such as an overhead mixer or a continuous process such as a two fluid co-extrusion nozzle, an in-line injector, an in-line mixer or an in-line screen can be used to 30  make the emulsion. The size of the emulsion composition in the final composition can be manipulated by changing the mixing speed, mixing time, the mixing device and the viscosity of the aqueous solution. In general, by reducing the mixing speed,<br><br>

PCT/EP02/11723<br><br>
14                                decreasing the mixing time, lowering the viscosity of the<br>
aqueous solution or using a mixing device that produces less<br>
shear force during mixing, one can produce an emulsion of a<br>
larger droplet size. Especially preferred are ultrasonic<br>
5  mixers. Although the description above refers to the addition<br>
of surfactant it is understood it may also apply to the<br>
addition of cleaning agents.<br>
While the laundry articles are in contact with the dry cleaning 10  solvent, it is preferred to add mechanical energy for example by agitating or tumbling the laundry articles by rotating the drum or other means known in the art. Usually after one step, the dry cleaning solvent including any cleaning agents and/or loosened soil will be separated from the laundry articles. This 15  is preferably done by spinning the laundry articles and collecting the dry cleaning composition, although other separation methods known in the art may also be employed such as evaporation. The dry cleaning solvent is then preferably recycled by separating the soil and/or cleaning agents from the 20  solvent.<br>
In other instances it may be advantageous to recirculate at least part of the- dry cleaning comp'Os^tiorrduriTrg" one step. For' example by separating a portion of the dry cleaning composition 25  from the laundry articles, optionally filtering soil from the separated portion of dry cleaning composition and contacting the laundry articles with the filtered portion of the dry cleaning composition.<br>
30 - The dry cleaning is usually performed at atmospheric pressure<br>
and ambient temperature, between 10 and 30 °C in most countries. In some instances the process temperature may be elevated to just under the boiling point of the most volatile dry cleaning<br><br>

reduced or elevated pressure, typically achieved via a vacuum<br>
pump or by supplying a gas, such as nitrogen, to the apparatus<br>
thereby increasing the pressure the closable vessel. The<br>
5  process of dry cleaning may be carried out in any suitable<br>
apparatus. Preferably, the apparatus will comprise of a<br>
closable vessel and means to recycle the dry cleaning solvents<br>
used to minimise solvent losses into the environment. The dry<br>
cleaning composition may be in the form of a micro-emulsion but<br>
10  usually will be in the form of a macro-emulsion, which is<br>
generally accepted to be thermodynamically unstable. A suitable process and appliance for dry cleaning is described in US 6 045 588. The solvent will preferably be filtered and recycled in the same appliance. Generally, the laundry articles will be<br>
15  agitated in the dry cleaning process by tumbling, rotating,<br>
ultrasonics or any suitable type of mechanical energy (see US 6 045 588).<br>
Still other advantages and novel features of the present 20  invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description, which presents, by way of illustration, various exemplary modes contemplated for carrying out the invention. As will be realised, the. invention is capable of other different aspects and objects all without 25  departing from the invention. Accordingly, advantages, aspects, and descriptions are illustrative in nature and not restrictive.<br>
The surfactants, dry cleaning solvents, cosolvents and optional 30  cleaning agents used in present invention are described below and may be the same or different for each step of the inventive process.  Usually the primary dry cleaning solvent will be the same.<br><br>

Dry cleaning solvent<br>
The dry cleaning solvent can be any dry cleaning solvent known in the art but is usually a non-flammable, non-chlorine 5  containing organic dry cleaning solvent. Although the term dry cleaning solvent is used in the singular, it should be noted that a mixture of solvents may also be used. Thus, the singular should be taken to encompass the plural, and vice versa.   When mixtures of solvents are used, the solvent that is most<br>
10  abundant may be denoted as the primary or main solvent. Because of the typical environmental problems associated with chlorine containing solvents, the solvent preferably does not contain CI atoms. In addition, the solvent should not be flammable such as petroleum or mineral spirits having typical flash points as low<br>
15  as 20°C or even lower. The term non-flammable is intended to<br>
describe organic dry cleaning solvents with a flash point of at least 37.8°C, more preferably at least 45°C, most preferably at least 50°C. The limit of a flashpoint of at least 37.8°C for non-flammable liquids is defined in NFPA 30, the Flammable and<br>
20  Combustible Liquids Code as issued by National Fire Protection Association, 1996 edition, Massachusetts USA. Preferred test methods for 
25  including hydrofluorocarbon (HFC), hydrofluoroether (HFE) or mixtures thereof. However even more preferred are non-halogenated solvents. For example other classes of suitable highly preferred solvents are non-flammable siloxanes and hydrocarbons (see below). (see below).<br>
30<br>
The most desirable solvents are non-ozone depleting and a useful common definition for the ozone depleting potential is defined by the Environmental Protection Agency in the USA: the<br><br>
VO 03/038179<br><br>
PCT/EP02/11723<br><br>
17                                                   ozone depleting potential is the ratio of the impact on ozone<br>
of a chemical compared to the impact of a similar mass of CFC-<br>
11. Thus,-. the-ODP of CFC-11 is defined to be 1.0.<br>
5  Hydrofluorocarbons<br>
One preferred hydrofluorocarbon solvent is represented by the formula CxHyF(2x+2-y)/ wherein x is from 3 to 8, y is from 1 to 6, the mole ratio of F/H in the hydrofluorocarbon solvent is greater than 1.6. 10<br>
Preferably, x is from 4 to 6 and most preferred x is 5 and y is 2.<br>
Especially suitable are hydrofluorocarbon solvents are selected 15  from isomers of decafluoropentane and mixtures thereof. In<br>
particular useful is 1,1,1,2, 2,3, 4,5,5,5-decafluoropentane. The E.I. Du Pont De Nemours and Company markets this compound under the name Vertrel XF™.<br>
20  Hydrofiuoroethers<br>
Hydrofluoroethers (HFEs) suitable for use in the present invention are generally low polarity chemical compounds minimally containing carbon, fluorine, hydrogen, and catenary (that is, in-chain) oxygen atoms. HFEs can optionally contain<br>
25  additional catenary heteroatoms, such as nitrogen and sulphur. HFEs have molecular structures which can be linear, branched, or cyclic, or a combination thereof (such as alkylcycloaliphatic), and are preferably free of ethylenic unsaturation, having a total of about 4 to about 20 carbon<br>
30  atoms. Such HFEs are known and are readily available, either as essentially pure compounds or as  mixtures.<br><br>
WO 03/038179<br><br>
PCT/EP02/11723<br><br>
18                                           HFEs can be relatively low in toxicity, are claimed to have<br>
zero ozone depletion potential, can have short atmospheric<br>
lifetimes and law global warming potentials relative to<br>
chlorofluorocarbons and many chlorofluorocarbon substitutes.<br>
5  Furthermore, HFEs are listed as non volatile organic compounds<br>
by the EPA. Volatile organic compounds are considered to be<br>
smog precursors.<br>
Preferred hydrofluoroethers can have a boiling point in the 10  range from about 40 °C to about 275 °C, preferably from about 50 °C to about 200 °C, even more preferably from about 50 °C to about 121 °C. It is very desirable that the hydrofluoroether has no flashpoint. In general, when a HFE has a flash point, decreasing the F/H ratio or decreasing the number of carbon-15  carbon bonds each decreases the flash point of the HFE (see WO/00 26206).<br>
Useful hydrofluoroethers include two varieties: segregated hydrofluoroethers and omega-hydrofluoroalkylethers.<br>
20  Structurally, the segregated hydrofluoroethers comprise at<br>
least one mono-, di-, or trialkoxy-substituted perfluoroalkane, perfluorocycloalkane, perfluorocycloalkyl-containing perfluoroalkane, or perfluorocycloalkylene-containing perfluoroalkane compound.<br>
