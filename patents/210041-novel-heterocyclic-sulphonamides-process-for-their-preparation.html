The inhibitory activity of the compounds of formula (I) on endothelin receptors can be demonstrated using the test procedures described hereinafter:<br>
I.        Inhibition of endothelin binding to recombinant human ET’ receptors expressed in Baculovirus-infected insect cells<br>
A cDNA coding for human ET’ receptors of human placenta was cloned (M. Adachi, Y.-Y, Yang, Y. Furuichi and C. Miyamoto, BBRC 180,1265-1272) and expressed in the Baculovirus-insect cell system. Baculovirus-infected insect cells from a 23 1 fomenter are centrifuged off (3000 x g, 15 minutes, 4°C) 60 hours after the infection, re-suspended in Tris buffer (5 mM, pH 7.4,1 mM MgCy and again centrifuged. After a further re-suspension and centrifugation the cells are suspended in 800 ml of the same buffer and freeze-dried at -120°C. The cells disintegrate when the suspension in this h3rpotonic buffer mixture is thawed. After a repeated freeze-drying/thawing cycle the suspension is homogenised and centrifuged (25000 x g, 15 minutes, 4°C). After suspension in Tris buffer (75 mM, pH 7.4, 25 mM MgClg, 250 mM sucrose) 1 ml aliquots (protein content about 3.5 mg/ml) are stored at -85°C.<br>
For the binding assay, the freeze-dried membrane preparations are thawed and, after centrifugation at 20°C and 25000 g for 10 minutes, re-suspended in assay buffer (50 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.4, containing 25 mM MnCL, 1 mM EDTA and 0.5% bovine serum albumin). 100 \i\ of this<br><br>
membrane suspension containing 70   of protein are incubated with 50 ill of ‘‘‘I-endothelin (specific activity 2200 Ci/mmol) in assay buffer (25000 cpm, final concentration 20 pM) and 100 |il of assay buffer containing varying<br>
concentrations of test compound. The incubation is carried out at 20’’0 for 2 hours or at 4’’0 for 24 hours. The separation of free and membrane-bound radio- hands is carried out by filtration over a glass fibre filter. The inhibitory activity of compounds of formula (I) determined in this test procedure is given in Table 1 as the IC50, i.e. as the concentration [nM] which is required to inhibit 50% of the specific binding of ‘‘I-endothelin.<br><br>
II.       Inhibition of endothelin binding on recombinant human ET’ receptors, expressed in CHO cells<br>
Cell culture. CHO cells, expressing recombinant human ET’ receptor are grown in Minimal Essential Alpha Medium (Gibco Laboratories, Paisley, Scotland) supplemented with 0.1 /xM methotrexate, 5% dialyzed fetal calf serum, 100 U/ml of penicillin and 100 /xg/ml of streptomycin.<br>
Binding assays with whole attached cells are performed in 500 /xl Dulbecco's Eagle medium (DMEM) containing 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 25 mM Hepes. After incubation (2 h, 22’’0 in the presence of 35 pM [‘‘UET-l and increasing concentrations of various antagonists, the cells are extensively washed and finally solubiHzed in 1 % (w/v) SDS, 0.5 M NaOH and 100 mM EDTA. Each assay is performed three times in triplicates and non specific binding is assessed in the presence of 100 nM unlabelled ET-1. Specific binding is defined as the difference between total binding and non specific binding. IC’’ values are determined after logit/log transformation of the binding data.<br>

III.     Inhibition of endothelin-induced contractions in isolated rat aorta rings<br>
Rings with a length of 5 mm were cut out from the thorax aorta of adult Wistar-Kyoto rats. The endothelium was removed by lightly rubbing the internal surface. Each ring was immersed at 37°C in 10 ml of Krebs-Teensiest solution in an isolated bath while gassing with 95% 0’ and 5% Cog. The isometric stretching of the rings was measured. The rings were stretched to a pre-tension of 3 g. After incubation for 10 minutes with the test compound or vehicle cumulative dosages of endothelin-1 were added. The activity of the test compound was ascertained by the observed shift to the right of the dosage-activity curve of endothelin-1 in the presence of different concentrations of antagonist. This shift to the right (or "dose ratio", DR) corresponds to the quotient from the EC50 'Values of endothelin-1 in the presence and in the absence of antagonist, with the EC50 value denoting the endothelin concentration required for a half-maximum contraction.<br>
The corresponding pA’ value, which is a measure of the activity of the test compound, was calculated using a computer programme according to the following equation from the "dose ratio" DR for each individual dosage-activity curve.<br>
PA2 = log(DR-l)-log(antagonist-concentration)<br>
The EC5Q of endothelin in the absence of test compounds is 0.3 nM.<br>
The p\ values obtained with compounds of formula (I) are given in the following Table 3.<br><br><br>

IV&gt;      Pharmacokinetics of the endothelin receptor antagonists<br>
The pharmacokinetic of the newly synthesised endothelin receptor antagonists were assessed in Wistar rats. The test compounds were dissolved in DMSO at a concentration of 5 mg/mL and administered orally by gavage at a dose of 1 ml/kg body weight corresponding to 5 mg/kg body weight. Two rats were administered per test compound. Blood samples were collected from the retro-orbital sinus at 1 and 5 h post dose in one rat, and at 3 and 7 h post dose in the other rat. In addition a terminal 24 h blood sample was collected from both rats by heart puncture. Blood was collected on EDTA-NaF. Plasma was derived by centrifugation at 2000 g at +4°C for 15 min. Plasma samples were assayed for active drug related material with a bioassay, based on the binding competition of tested compounds and ‘‘‘IET-1 on recombinant ET’ receptors. Quantitation of plasma samples was by comparison to a calibration curve build up from control rat plasma spiked with known concentrations of the test compounds. Selected findings are summarised in the following table:<br><br><br>
