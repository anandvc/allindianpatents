				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
The present invention deals with an alternative interfacial polymerization process of microencapsulation,<br>
microcapsule's produced thereof, microencapsulated agrochemicals, Pharmaceuticals, catalysts and phase<br>
transfer materials, and formulations thereof, by means of microcapsules and starting materials with much lower<br>
toxicological profile than customary microencapsulation materials, and with the participation of acetylene<br>
carbamide derivatives in the final structure of the microcapsules' wall.<br>
Field of the invention<br>
This invention deals with polymer microencapsulation for controlled release of active ingredients and<br>
formulations containing microcapsules.<br>
State of the Art<br>
The problem addressed in the present invention is to provide a alternative microencapsulation process,<br>
and microcapsules thereof, for controlled delivery of agrochemicals (or other compounds with structures related<br>
with all the different types of agrochemicals' structures for any suitable process, also phase change materials -<br>
PCMs-, inks, thermosetting materials and catalysts) in such a way that the risks associated with the production<br>
and the product itself are decreased (by means of using wall forming materials with lower toxicity compared<br>
with present industrial processes) while the microcapsules produced thereof (and the formulated<br>
microcapsules) control the release rate in a suitable way for a proper functionality.<br>
Microencapsulation methods for the delivery of agrochemicals are known since late 40's. Physical<br>
methods, phase separation and interfacial reaction are the three main procedures for microencapsulation. The<br>
most successful interfacial polymerization for microencapsulation of agrochemicals was developed on earlier<br>
70's by Scher et al. (Stauffer Chemical Company), and many patents from Stauffer' group (later Zeneca, then<br>
ICI and nowadays Syngenta) have been granted based on modifications of the same initial concept, namely,<br>
the formation of a polyurea microcapsule's wall to enclose chemicals.<br>
The present invention comprises several aspects. In this case, the field requires the synergistic or<br>
combined effects of many parameters, starting with the reactants, the materials to be encapsulated up to the<br>
final modifications for definitive industrially applicable formulations, especially in agriculture, for final proper<br>
functionality.<br>
i)	we disclose an industrial process of microencapsulation that has never been taught before,<br>
that includes the use of at least an aromatic isocyanate, and at least an aliphatic isocyanate<br>
and at least an acetylene carbamide derivative (ACDs) of formula (I) as wall forming<br>
materials.<br><br>
ii)	The enclosed materials in our microcapsule's have a particular release rate, in some<br>
embodiments being more beneficial than current commercial products, and in some<br>
embodiments being an alternative (less toxic) to current processes, ranging from fast release<br>
(e.g., lambda-cyhalothrin), maintained release, (e.g., flurochloridone, clomazone) and<br>
practically no release, e.g. (phase change waxes).<br>
iii)	The agrochemical formulations described herein are novel and functionally acceptable,<br>
meaning that can be use in the field as current microencapsulated formulations are currently<br>
being used, with the same machinery, precautions and procedures that the farmer is used<br>
to, or the same use in fabrics and coatings for PCMs (phase change materials), or the same<br>
use in reactions for microencapsulated catalysts as the current microencapsulated catalysts.<br>
iv)	Dry formulations of the microcapsules can be used for microencapsulation of PCMs, by<br>
incorporating to the oil phase waxes or oils with melting points in the range of 0 to 50 Â°C<br>
(that may constitute the only oil solvent) or dispersing the solid materials in an appropriate oil<br>
phase, also for catalysts and thermosetting materials,<br>
Note that we will refer to Acetylene Carbamide Derivatives with the acronym ACDs.<br>
We will refer to formulations of microcapsules in agriculture to any kind of agrochemical formulations that<br>
contain microcapsules, and not only to the common "Capsule Suspension" (CS) formulations. Non-limiting<br>
examples are that under our term "microcapsule's formulation" are suspoemulsions, as well as water<br>
dispersable granules containing microcapsules, oil suspensions where in the oil there are mixtures of<br>
agrochemicals (at least one microencapsulated), etc. Also, it is evident that our invention allows the<br>
combination of microcapsules enclosing one or more active ingredients with other non-microencapsulated<br>
active ingredients in the same formulation.<br>
Our invention differs with regard to the prior art in that:<br>
There is an 'additional an essential cross-polymerization agent that gives unique characteristics to the<br>
microcapsules, namely, acetylene carbamide derivatives (ACDs).<br>
The ACDs provoke drastic changes in capsule's wall permeability at low concentrations (starting at 0.05 to 5 %<br>
of total formulation).<br>
The polymer wall is not a polyurea wall (already claimed in many different patents), rather a polyurea-acetylene<br>
carbamide derivative wall (not disclosed ever before).<br>
This wall presents an additional parameter -with respect to prior art- to control the permeability of the<br>
microcapsule's wall, namely, the ratio ACD/isocyanates, determined experimentally.<br>
There is the need (not the option) to add a first catalyst for the formation of the polyurea bonds, because the<br>
microcapsules are restricted to the use of aliphatic isocyanates and aromatic isocyanates (that are less<br>
reactive) preferably dialkyltin fatty acid ester.	â¢	.<br>
The avoidance of highly toxic isocyanates as those described in previous patents (as TDI) is allowed thanks to<br>
the novel combination of less toxic isocyanates able to form polyurea wall, ACDs' cross-linkers and catalysts<br>
adapted for our process, and the ability to terminate isocyanate functional groups unreacted.<br>
3<br><br>
The different materials to be encapsulated, reaction products, catalysts and chemistry involved, times and<br>
temperature reactions are in a whole unique features.<br>
We are able to encapsulate with our process any chemical that is not intrinsically reactive with the functional<br>
groups of the wall materials, being this belonging to any structural chemical type, as long they do not react with<br>
the wall forming materials and the molecular size, ability to be dissolved, dispersed or used pure is suitable.<br>
Customary and worldwide used microencapsulation materials for many agricultural formulations (sold<br>
worldwide in high amounts, e.g., KarateÂ® Zeon -Syngenta-) use as a part of the wall the highly human-toxicant<br>
and carcinogenic compound 2,4-toluenediisocyanate (TDI), CAS# [584-84-9]. In our preferred embodiments we<br>
make use of isocyanates with highly reduced toxicological profiles than the mentioned TDI, for example m-<br>
TMXDI, CAS# [2778-42-9], sold as TMXDIÂ® by Cytec. Worthy to note, TMXDI has not ever been reflected in a<br>
significant -if any at all- industrial use of it in the field of microencapsulation of liquids either agrochemicals,<br>
also not for other microencapsulations. As read in CYTEC webpage "TMXDI resins are commonly used in the<br>
tooling industry, and to encapsulate and protect electronics, coat printed circuit boards, and adhere seal filters".<br>
This render the combination of isocyanates with ACD absolutely novel and not obvious.<br>
Below a comparison table of toxicological differences in between TMXDI and TDI (according MSDS of<br>
Sigma-Aldrich and CYTEC).<br>
TOXIC EFFECTS	TDI	TMXDI<br>
carcinogenic (Ames test)<br>
IARC carrcinogen 2B<br>
cancer	CMR Cat. Carcinogen 3	not carcinogenic (Ames test)<br>
acute inhalation toxicity (LC50)	10 ppm for 4 h - mice	27 ppm for 4 h -mice<br>
pulmonary sensitization in guinea pigs	Yes	no<br>
affects respiratory system in humans at long term (3 y) Yes	no<br>
Flashpoint	&gt;132Â°C	&gt;153Â°C<br>
storage	need to store under nitrogen only required to be stored atT
Thus, apart form solving the problem to create microcapsules with allow a tailored release rate of<br>
chemicals, in this invention we improve the toxicological profile of the microcapsules (and formulations thereof).<br>
Important to mention, the prior art microencapsulation processes normally do not complete in full, then the rest<br>
of isocyanates unreacted are a health hazard for the end-users. Not only the use of ACD reduces the content of<br>
unreacted isocyanates. At the same time, any unreacted isocyanate present at the time of use of the<br>
microcapsules' formulation -either in the wall or dispersed/dissolved in the formulation itself- is of much lower<br>
toxicity (e.g., TMXDI vs. TDI).<br>
US 4,285,720 (originally filled in 1973 by Scher et al., Stauffer) -included here in full by reference-,<br>
shows the basic process of an interfacial microencapsulation. Other newer patents do not teach more than this<br>
4<br><br>
document in regard our new invention. In US 4,285,720 is claimed a process of microencapsulation with<br>
capsules of polyurea without addition of a second reactant, providing an organic phase -with a water<br>
immiscible material to be microencapsulated- and an organic polyisocyanate in an aqueous phase containing a<br>
solution of water a surfactant and a protective colloid and heating, whereupon said water-immiscible material is<br>
encapsulated within discrete polyurea capsular enclosures. No mention of ACDs is done. Moreover, a catalyst<br>
can be optionally added to speed up the reaction, said catalyst being alkyl tin acetate. In our invention a<br>
catalyst of the type of alkyl tin ester (preferably a dibutyl esther) is needed.<br>
US 4,874,832 describes microencapsulation process with aliphatic isocyanates, but combined with polyether<br>
polyols to form polyurethanes. Patents US 4,417,916 and US 4,874,832 explain in detail microencapsulation<br>
with aliphatic isocyanates, but not combined with acetylene carbamide derivatives. US 5,925,595 discloses the<br>
use of TMD and PAPI, and the influence of TMXDI in the release rate when the latter is included in the mixture<br>
of isocyanates. However US 5,952,595 in a substantial way because the wall forming materials need the use of<br>
a polyamine (indicated in the description and also in the embodiments, where always an amine is used): in our<br>
invention we do need at all the use of a polyamine to form the polyurea wall, a tremendous difference with the<br>
present invention both regarding the chemical process and the final structure and characteristics of the<br>
microcapsule. Moreover US 5,925,595 does not mention the use of ACDs.<br>
One essential novel and inventive aspect of our invention is the use for the synthesis of the microcapsule's wall<br>
of ACDs. The existence of the own brochures of ACDs (e.g., PowderlinkÂ® 1174, from CYTEC) teach away from<br>
using them in a microencapsulation process, based on their low reactivity and the need of special initiators and<br>
temperature requirements, and the need of additional hydroxyl groups for their reaction.<br>
In WO 92/13448 (equivalent of EP 571396 and US 5,332,584) is stated that aminoplast polymers for its use in<br>
microencapsulation can be done with different types of compounds, namely: urea formaldehyde, melamine<br>
formaldehyde, benzoguanamine formaldehyde and acetylene carbamide (glycoluril-) formaldehyde. However in<br>
that document is not mentioned either implicitly suggested the use of any isocyanate compound to for part of<br>
the microcapsule's wall in combination with any urea, melamine, benzoguanamine glycoluril formaldehyde, as<br>
we do in this invention (independent claim 1 and dependent claim 4 of EP 571396 B1 deals with the only use of<br>
aminoresin compounds, without isocyanates).	'	'<br>
In the course of our research we found out that well away with respect to what was disclosed in prior art and in<br>
a extremely surpressively way, that we could introduce ACDs in a polyurea wall and at the same time, using a<br>
combination of isocyanates (in the preferred embodiment, PAPI and TMXDI) less toxic than the conventional<br>
mixture PAPI and TDI.<br>
There are documents that teach away from the solution we have invented. Further prior art can be<br>
exemplarized by US 5,563,224. There it is disclosed the use of compounds (including ACDs) to anchor UV<br>
protectants for the production of plastics, needing the ACD (to be reactive to anchor these UV protectors) the<br>
use of sulphuric acid. In the same patent, it is clearly stated that the acetylene carbamide monomers, in order to<br>
be reactive must be in strong acid conditions and under heat. Probably, in our process, the needed chemical<br>
potential needed for the activation of the ACDs is provided by the self isocyanate excited state and/or the<br>
localized increase of temperature of the exotermic isocyanate reaction. Must be quoted that US 5,563,224 does<br>
not refer in any instance to polymers for its use in the particular and very specific field of microencapsulation. In<br><br>
our invention we do not use strong acids either strong heating (that could destroy the active ingredients to<br>
encapsulate).<br>
The following documents have been cited in the Extended European Search Report, and are discussed<br>
regarding the novelty and inventive step in front of our invention. DD 108760 (Makower et al., 1974) discloses<br>
ACDs that in a very restrictive way (ethoxylates) could represent some of our compounds (I) and moreover for<br>
fields well distant from microencapsulation, like big pieces of plastic materials. No mention of combination to<br>
form polyurea microcapsules is made. WO 92/13450 (ICI, 1992) discloses in claim 1 only-polyurea compounds<br>
that are formed by the process of reacting isocyanates to form polyurea walls without addition of a second<br>
reactant, thus teaching away from the inclusion of ACDs. US 4889719 (Ohtsubo et al., 1989) discloses a<br>
microencapsulated insecticidal composition comprising an organophosphorous insecticide encapsulated in a<br>
wall formed of a polyurea; however no hint as to form a combined polymer with ACDs is present. Further, US<br>
4889719 teaches away from the combination of an aromatic isocyanate and an aliphatic isocyanate as we do<br>
(col. 1, In. 38-40: blends of aromatic and aliphatic isocyanates are not preferred, because the reaction rate<br>
difference between them does not readily produce a homogeneous wall). The inventors have found that this is<br>
not at all the case according our invention, since we get a very homogeneous wall, and, moreover, a very<br>
homogeneous particle size of the microcapsules. US 4458036 (Fesman et al. 1984) deals, with polyurethanes<br>
with ACDs incorporated, in a distant field as flame retardants, in form of foams, and not in microscopic<br>
structures as microcapsules. In between the thousands of reactions possible to be performed to form plastics or<br>
foams (in US 4458036, mattresses, upholstery, cushion) that document does not provide any indication that the<br>
ACDs could be combined with polyureas to form microcapsules. The macroscopic structure of the polymers<br>
disclosed in US 4458036 do not lead to homogeneous spheres of polyurea-ACDs polymers, either is envisaged<br>
any application of the cited polymers in the field of microencapsulation. US 3766204 (MathewC.US et al., 1973)<br>
also deals with remote fields like polyesthers, alkyd resins and polyurethanes, lubricants and surface active<br>
agents. Moreover, the ACDs disclosed therein are absolutely different from those claimed in our invention.<br>
There is no hint why the ethoxylated chain should be disregarded from compounds disclosed in US 3766204 to<br>
arrive to the claimed ACDs, and much lesser to choose them as participants in a polyurea-ACD wall for<br>
microcapsules. It is noteworthy that in a field of increasing interest as microencapsulation, the ACDs have<br>
never been disclosed to be used (not even as a mere possibility) in microcapsules.<br>
Worthy to note is that the heating needed for microencapsulation processes (including ours) may be sometimes<br>
higher than the maximum limit of the stability of the chemical to encapsulate. This happens for example, in the<br>
particular of pyrethroids, where some undesired enantiomeric or diasteroisomeric or isomeric forms are<br>
increased due to the temperature. For those cases we have realized that the addition of antioxidants may<br>
prevent this isomerization. First of all, it is not obvious that an antioxidant may prevent isomerization (there are<br>
many chemical pathways in which a molecule might be isomerized) and second, the idea of incorporating<br>
antioxidants in an oil phase has never been disclosed for the case of isomerization of pyrethroids. By virtue of<br>
our process, we are able to add oil soluble antioxidants (for example, BHT -butylhydroxytoluene-, BHA -<br>
butylhydroxyanisol- or mixtures thereof) directly to our oil phase. In a particular example, a 0.05% of BHT and<br>
0.01% of BHA (with respect the total weight percent of the whole oil phase) may be added to Solvesso 200 that<br><br>
at the same time is the solvent in a preferred embodiment of microencapsulation of supercyhalothrin (quantities<br>
of BHT, BHA or other antioxidants shall be used according the recommendations of the respective producers).<br>
This prevents isomerization of supercyhalothrin that start"to occur already at 40 Â°C at dark.<br>
The idea of adding an additional cross-linking material of low reactivity as ACDs (when compared that reactivity<br>
with prior art microcapsule's wall constituents, e.g., only isocyanates or aminoplast resins) to the polyurea wall<br>
is not obvious. Neither is expected that small percentages of ACDs can modify the release rate characteristics<br>
of the microcapsules in between the ranges needed for agricultural uses, either being useful to<br>
microencapsulate catalysts, thermosetting materials or PCMs (the latter cases needing a higher content of wall<br>
forming materials until the release rate is suitable for each desired purpose). Morover, the fact that some ADCs<br>
(e.g., Powderlink 1174) are solid, would be disregarded at first chance, because is more convenient (and the<br>
prior art shows it) to use liquid materials as wall forming materials in the interfacial microencapsulation<br>
(incorporated in the oil phase). It is possible to incorporate solid ACDs in a dispersed form in the oil phase (e.g,<br>
by AtloxÂ® LP-1 or LP-5 or LP-6) but we have seen that sometimes this lead to an excessive amount of<br>
un reacted ACD.<br>
Even wanting to add a cross-linking agent to a polyurea wall to modify prior art walls, an expert would have<br>
chosen any cross-linking agent more reactive than ACDs. A few scientific papers have been written about<br>
chemistry and properties of ACDs as cross-linkers, but never referred to a microencapsulation method, rather in<br>
fields enough distant to be considered in a microencapsulation process (e.g., fabric processing, coatings for car<br>
paints, etc). The reader must not confuse the scarcely described properties of ACDs with their specific novel<br>
and inventive application in microencapsulation and must understand the complexity involved in a cross-linking<br>
reaction in the interphase of an oil and water phase, in situ, of two types of isocyanates and ACDs -far to be<br>
comparable with a plastic film forming or lacquers reaction-. Even in described polymerization processes in<br>
those far technical fields with the intervention of ACDs, the remaining non-polymerized monomers must be<br>
stripped off or removed from the final product, circumstance that does not occur in our invention. In particular,<br>
polymers having pores of relative big size (but not microcapsules as closed volumes) can be formed with<br>
acetylene carbamide-formaldehydes, but constantly these processes show that the acetylene carbamide<br>
formaldehyde must be initially emulsified in a water phase. The chemistry behind those processes is well<br>
different to that of our invention.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
The microencapsulation of active ingredient(s) in solution (organic phase) is done using interfacial<br>
polymerization processes based on the reaction of isocyanates with an acetylene carbamide derivatives of the<br>
formula (I).<br>
Since the polymer that constitutes our microcapsule's wall is novel, particularly in the field of<br>
microencapsulation, we direct a set of claims to the polymer itself.<br><br>
In particular, the polymer referred may be described as a polymer for microencapsulation of water-immiscible<br>
material,  as a "primary"  material to  microencapsulate  (or a  mixture of water-immiscible  materials).  A<br>
"secondary"  material  to   microencapsulate  might  be  solid   material  dispersed   in  the  oil  phase  to  be<br>
microencapsulated together with the water-immiscible material and/or coformulants for technological reasons<br>
(surfactant) or protective reasons (e.g., antioxidants). It is obvious that the materials to be microencapsulated<br>
must be compatible and do not react undesirably before final use of the microcapsules. The "primary" material<br>
to microencapsulate is water-immiscible, meaning this in this case with a solubility in water lower than 7.50.mg/L<br>
at 20Â°C. Said claimed polymer is formed by means of an interfacial polymerization reaction and enclosing the<br>
water-immiscible material(s), characterized in that:<br>
such polymer is formed by the reaction of:<br>
a monomeric aliphatic isocyanate<br>
a prepolymer aromatic isocyanate<br>
a N',  N",  N"',  N'" alkoxy-alkyl and/or hydroxy-alkyl acetylene carbamide derivative or mixtures of such<br>
compounds where alkoxy means: methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, isopropoxy, butoxy, isobutoxy, ter-butoxy, and<br>
alkyl means methy, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl, sec-butyl, independly from each other<br>
substituted nitrogen<br>
and<br>
the microcapsules have a mean diameter of 0.3 to 25 urn, preferably in between 0.8 to 15 and 90% of the<br>
microcapsules have a diameter lower than 100 urn, preferably lower than 30 urn, when measured with a<br>
conventional laser diffraction particle sizer analyzer, previous customary dilution upon water under agitation<br>
The more hydroxyl groups present in the ACD, the more the reactivity. We have realized that an excessive<br>
number of hydroxyl groups per molecule of substituted ACD results in a faster reaction -appropriate in some<br>
cases- but more difficult to be controlled. The only way to select the right ACD for a particular purpose is to<br>
check experimentally the outcome of the reaction and adapt the reaction time (for example, by<br>
increasing/diminishing the speed in which the emulsification of oil droplets is taking place and/or increasing<br>
diminishing the quantity of the catalyst responsible for the formation polyurea bonds and the catalyst for the<br>
incorporation of the cross-linking ACD). It is possible that the alkoxy or alkyl groups are higher than a chain of 4<br>
carbon atoms. In such case the capsule's wall is more permeable, due to the higher size of the cross-linking<br>
agent. The use of compounds up to 6 carbon atoms for the alkoxy and alkyl groups then needs to be reduced in<br>
the mixture of wall forming materials in order to avoid an excessive fast release. Also, more hydroxyl groups in<br>
the ACD causes an increase of reactivity, that may be appropriate for certain applications .where a more tight<br>
wall structure is desired, for example in the case of phase change materials (PMCs). Our invention is directed<br>
to all kinds of ACDs, in between the range of substituents proposed, with regard of the stereochemical<br>
configuration. Normally, the use of these compounds is limited to what is commercially available, but a possible<br>
purification of a certain stereochemical structure in a future ACD won't deprive the use of such compound to be<br>
used as in our invention. A more defined structure of such polymer-participating a ACD (I) is as follows (Figure<br>
13):<br>
8<br><br><br>
wherein<br>
a)	R1: R3, R5, R7, are, independently one to each other, methylen, ethylen, n-propylen, isopropylen, n-butylen,<br>
isobutylen, sec-butylen, tert-butylen<br>
and<br>
b)	R2, R4, R6, Rs, are, independently one to each other, hydrogen methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl,<br>
isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl<br>
and<br>
c)	R9, R10 being hydrogen or hydroxymethyl, more preferably both substituents being hydrogen,<br>
comprising compounds (I) all isomeric and stereoisomeric configurations that may be present depending on the<br>
radicals as cited, and been excluded from compounds (I) all the combinations of radicals that are not able to<br>
form polyurea-acetylene carbamide derivative (ACD) polymers when such ACDs are reacted as described in<br>
the present invention with a mixture of isocyanates.<br>
The ACDs are a fundamental part of the wall of the final microcapsules in our invention. In a typical process we<br>
have two phases, an oil phase and a water phase, the oil phase is emulsified into the water phase at 45-70 Â°C,<br>
the polyurea reactions start to take place, temperature is raised to 60-90 Â°C, and the catalyst to make reactive<br>
the ACDs is placed -after the polyurea reactions start to take place- in the continuous water phase. A curing<br>
time of about 1 to 4 hours is set at 50-90 Â°C.Then a unique polymer constituting the microcapsules' wall is<br>
formed in the water-oil interphase of the oil droplets.<br>
A typical oil phase according to our invention is composed of:<br>
Monomer aliphatic isocyanate (e.g., TMXDI)<br>
Prepolymer aromatic isocyanate (e.g., PAPI)<br><br>
Monomer acetylene carbamide (e.g. tetra-butoxymethyl acetylene carbamide) (referring to "monomer acetylene<br>
carbamide"  when the content in monomers is higher than 50% of the total commercial acetylene carbamide<br>
product: in industrial conditions is difficult to have a pure monomer acetylene carbamide product)<br>
Solvent (e.g., cyclohexanone to dissolve tetra-butoxymethyl acetylene carbamide)<br>
Active ingredient(s) (e.g., supercyhalothrin)<br>
Optionally, dispersed solid active ingredients (e.g., milled alpha cypermethrin at crystall sizes of 
AtloxÂ®LP-1)<br>
Optionally, dispersed and/or dissolved antioxidants and/or UV protectors<br>
Optionally (for achieving smaller microcapsules' sizes) a surfactant with low HLB (e.g. AtloxÂ® 4912)<br>
The ratio of the composition is typically the following:<br>
Monomer aliphatic isocyanate : Prepolymer aromatic isocyanate from 1:3 to 1:1<br>
Prepolymer aromatic isocyanates : Monomer acetylene carbamide from 9 : 1 to 4 : 1<br>
Monomer aliphatic isocyanates to : Monomer acetylene carbamide from 2 : 1 to 5 : 1<br>
, being the most preferred ration Monomer aliphatic isocyanate : Prepolymer aromatic isocyanates : Monomer<br>
acetylene carbamide of 3 : 6 : 1.<br>
Always, the oil phase is kept until emulsification in dehydrated atmosphere (by chemical or physical means, like<br>
desiccation or adsorption or isolation, and also possible to working under inert atmosphere, with gases<br>
preferably CO2, N2, He, or just controlling the relative humidity of the reaction site).<br>
The water phase typically contains:<br>
Water<br>
Primary surfactant (e.g., an alkyl ethoxylated/propoxylated copolymer of type SymperonicÂ®)<br>
Water soluble or dispersable polymer(s) (e.g., polivinilpyrrolidone PVP-30)<br>
Hydrocolloid(s) (e.g., Guargum)<br>
Lignosulfonate(s) (e.g., type of KraftsperseÂ®)<br>
At this stage, during the dispersion process, the organic phase is emulsified into the aqueous phase at a<br>
temperature of about 45-70 Â°C. The main particle size of the dispersed phase should be in the range of 1-25<br>
urn. Once the target particle size is reached the high shear agitator is stopped and the main agitator (anchor) is<br>
adjusted to its lowest setting to reduce shear stress during heating up as curing period.<br>
The catalyst present in the organic phase initiates the wall forming reaction that will be furthermore increased<br>
by heating up to about 60-90 Â°C. Then is added the catalyst for the ACD incorporation to the polyurea wall, (e.g.<br>
p-Toluenesulfonic acid dissolved in an alcohol with a chain with no longer than 8 carbon atoms; if a substituted<br>
sulfonimide is used, then, the reaction temperature must be higher). The microcapsules are left from one to<br>
about two hours at 50-90 Â°C to complete termination of isocyanate residues. Then the mixture is allowed to cool<br>
down, normally, to room temperature.<br>
The pH value of the cured microcapsule suspension is adjusted to the pH more appropriate for the stability and<br>
desired properties of the agrochemical, with a 50% aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide.<br><br>
Finally, viscosity modifiers of the type of clays (e.g., inert zeolites) and hydrocolloids (e.g., xanthan<br>
gum), aluminum sulfate and sodium tripolyphosphate are added to prevent the microcapsules from separating<br>
from the water on prolonged storage due to their density difference. As a buffer system (preferably for economy<br>
reasons based on sodium carbonate or in citric acid) is applied to maintain the formulation at the desired pH. It<br>
is also interesting, for solutions to be at alkaline conditions, to use sodium carbonate (or any other source of<br>
carbonate ions) because adsorbs carbon dioxide generated from the reaction of residual isocyanates with water<br>
on storage therefore preventing any pressure buildup in the final product containers, situation only expected on<br>
exceptional cases when a batch has not been correctly terminated.<br>
Any biocide is added to protect the formulation from biological attack during the shelf life of the product<br>
(preferably of the type of imidazolidinyl urea or other conventional bacteriostatics, bactericides or microbicides).<br>
The process, as explained, starts by dissolving aliphatic and aromatic isocyanates and the active ingredient -<br>
eventually a surfactant, or UV protector or antioxidant- in a water-immiscible solvent. The solvent is present to<br>
dissolve the active ingredient(s) -a.i.-, in the case that the a.i. is a solid, or just to provide an oil phase where<br>
the a.i. is present. In certain cases, if the amount of a.i. is high enough, and is able to dissolve all the wall<br>
forming materials, the "solvent" is materially replaced by the a.i. itself, that acts both as a.i. and a solvent (being<br>
this situation exceptional). The ACD is incorporated into the oil phase with the aid of a second solvent, when<br>
needed. Further the oil phase contains the catalyst that will initiate the wall forming reactions (when in the<br>
presence of water). Also, solid active ingredients might be dispersed in the oil phase. The aqueous phase<br>
serves as the carrier medium (continuous phase) for the microcapsules that containing active ingredient(s), but<br>
the water phase may also contain dispersed or dissolved active ingredients (e.g., glyphosate or diquat for<br>
agricultural applications). The water phase is prepared by addition of emulsifiers, protective colloids and other<br>
coformulants that have the function of emulsify the oil droplets that will be the core of the final microcapsules<br>
and optionally, also serve as final coformulants needed for the proper functionality of the finished formulation.<br>
Preferred wall forming materials<br>
Regarding ACDs we prefer the use of PqwderlinkÂ® 1174 and CymelÂ® type commercial products, more<br>
preferably CymelÂ® 1711 and CymelÂ® 1170. The use of prepolymers of Cymel type result in a more irregular<br>
reaction course when compared with the use of PowderlinkÂ® 1174 in the specific trials we have done. Therefore<br>
the most preferred ACD is PowderlinkÂ® 1174. Must be noted that the commercial products might have some<br>
other compounds than the monomers referred in the label (e.g., PowderlinkÂ® 1174 may contain oligomers)<br>
For the polyfunctional isocyanate system, we prefer one aliphatic isocyanate and one aromatic isocyanate<br>
(aliphatic refers to the fact that the -NCO group is not attached directly to the aromatic ring). The polymer<br>
density can be varied by changing the ratio of polyfunctional (e.g. prepolymer aliphatic PAPI) to polyfunctional<br>
aliphatic isocyanate (e.g. CythaneÂ® 3174, TMXDI, the latter the preferred aliphatic isocyanate according this<br>
invention). The higher the ratio, the more cross-linking and hence the lower the diffusion coefficient and hence<br>
the lower the permeability. When incorporating the ACD, the complexity of the cross-linking reactions makes<br>
difficult to predict the final release rate, that can be measured by experimental trials with the formed<br>
microcapsules.<br>
The preferred aromatic isocyanate according to our invention is PAPIÂ® and its series from DowÂ®. Below<br>
is depicted a type of preferred compounds:<br><br><br>
Wherein n=0 to n=6<br>
For n=1, PAPI, CAS# [009016-87-9], commercial name SpecflexÂ®NE 138.<br>
The preferred aliphatic isocyanates are TMXDI and CythaneÂ® 3174, represented by the formulas below:<br><br>
It is obvious that the benefit of incorporating acetylene carbamide derivatives into a wall formed of TDI and<br>
PAPI is possible, however, in that case, the production process and the capsules themselves have the problem<br>
of the intrinsic toxicity of TDI, in other words, the use of acetylene carbamide derivatives and TDI and PAPI is<br>
an obvious extension of the subject matter of this invention, as well as any customary combination of<br><br>
isocyanates to form polyurea walls. We have the experience that ACD can be incorporated into many types of<br>
polyurea walls, resulting polyurea-ACD polymers.<br>
Also, the inventors have realized that inclusion of other aromatic isocyanates other than corresponding to the<br>
formula above leads to fully functional microcapsules' walls.<br>
The use of aliphatic isocyanates (NCO groups are not directly bounded into the aromatic ring) implies the use<br>
of a catalyst to start the reaction due to their low reactivity. Due to this implicit lack of reactivity they are not<br>
used in industrial applications of commercially successful microencapsulated formulations.<br>
We use catalysts (for the oil phase) like Stannous octoate, Dibutyltin dilaurate, Potassium acetate, Potassium<br>
octoate, Dibutyltin mercaptide, Dibutyltin thiocarboxylates, Phenylmercuric propionate, Lead octoate, Alkaline<br>
metal salts, (K2CO3, NaHCO3 and Na2CO3), Ferric acetylacetonate.<br>
We have been using the combination of tertiary amine catalysts for long time but we have surprisingly<br>
found that with the use of ACDs, and in the absence of amines, the reaction not only takes place, but in a<br>
manner highly convenient. According to our experience, a more particularly of the type mono-(di-, tri-, tetra-)<br>
fatty acid ester of alkyl element of the group 4 or group 14 fatty acid ester, being preferred as alkyl groups:<br>
methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, n-butyl, n-pentyl, n-hexyl, n-heptyl, n-octyl (and all their chain-isomeric forms), being the<br>
preferred metals transition metals Sn, Ti, In, Sb, Pb, Ge, Pd, Pt, Au, Zn, Fe, Cu. The most preferred catalyst for<br>
the type of microencapsulations asked currently in the agrochemical market is, by the cost, specific process<br>
needs and ecotoxicological reasons, the dibutlytinlaurate. We have compared the use of triethylendiamine with<br>
dibutyltinlaurate with only the dibutyltinlaurate catalyst and we have a higher improved control of the reaction<br>
and modification of wall properties when using only the dibutyltinlaurate. However, the process can be adapted<br>
(specially reaction time and temperature) for other suitable catalysts mentioned above for particular uses,<br>
especially agrochemicals with certain tendency to react with the wall forming materials.<br>
For the incorporation of the ACDs to the wall, is used a second catalyst placed in the water phase,<br>
most preferably p-toluensulfonic acid or of the sulfonimide type (e.g. methyltolylsulfonimide) or of the type<br>
Cycatâ¢ 600 or Cycatâ¢ 500.<br>
Our preferred polymerization system is using aliphatic isocyanates (m-TMXDI as monomer) in<br>
combination with the aromatic isocyanate PAPI that are less reactive than applying two aromatic isocyanates<br>
as e.g. PAPI/TDI. Additionally, the aliphatic isocyanates are produced without phosgene and free of<br>
nitrosamines. These types of isocyanates are advantageous in the toxicogical profile that, makes it easier to<br>
work more safely than with other isocyanates have been established, for example the microcapsule's type of<br>
products of Syngenta, being this selection of type of isocyanate pair in a real industrial application completely<br>
new (in a higher degree of novelty, the combination with ACDs and the selection of only one organometallic<br>
catalyst).<br>
The most preferred functionality of the lignosulfonates (that may also be achieved by other equivalent<br>
commercial products that can replace Kraftsperse without being lignosulfonates, but not as a primary option) is<br>
achieved by our own treatment of a mixture of the compounds below cited, by thermal treatment at 70 Â°C for 10<br>
min, called LignoGATâ¢.<br><br><br>
Other lignosulphonates and modified sulfonates of choice are ReaxÂ®, PolyfonÂ®, KraftsperseÂ®, BorresperseÂ®,<br>
UltrazineÂ®, UfoxaneÂ®, MarasperseÂ®, DiwatexÂ®, MorwetÂ® in any of their variations.<br>
Other suitable hydrocolloids are agar, alginates, carrageens, gellan gum, pectins, cellulose, exudated gums<br>
(arabic gum, tragacanth, Ceratonia siliqua gum and/or karaya gum), tragacants, saponines, xanthan gum, and<br>
derivatives and or mixtures of the named compounds.<br>
Water soluble pr dispersable polymers of choice are, apart from the most preferred polyvinylpyrrolidone (up to<br>
100 mols of monomer) and polyvinylacetate, copolymers of PVP and methylmethacrylate, copolymers of PVP<br>
and vinylacetate (VA), poylvinyl alcohol (PVA), copolymers of PVA and crotonic acid, copolymers of PVA and<br>
maleic anhydride, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl guar gum, sodium polystyrene sulfonate,<br>
PVP/ethymethacrylate/methacrylic acid terpolymer, vinyl acetate/crotonic acid/vinyl neodecanoate copolymer,<br>
octylacrylamide/acrylates copolymer, monoethy ester of poly(methyl vinyl ether-maleic acid), and<br>
octylacrylamide / acrylate / butylaminoethyl methacrylate copolymers, acrylic acid/t-butyl acrylate copolymers,<br>
dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate/isobutyl methacrylate/2-ethylhexyl-methacrylate terpolymers, t-<br>
butylacrylate/acrylic acid copolymers, and silicone grafted terpolymers, e.g. t-butylacrylate/acrylic acid/PDMS<br>
and mixtures thereof.<br>
The surfactant to form the emulsion of oil in water can be chosen in between a wide range of customary<br>
surfactants with the condition that the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance is in between 12 to 18 (e.g., ethoxylated<br>
and/or propoxylated alcohols).<br>
Typical polyisocyanates suitable for this process are chosen from the first group and from the second group (for<br>
a two-isocyanate mixture as wall forming material -except the acetylene carbamide-, one isocyanate of each<br>
group must be taken, always must be at least one isocyanate of each group, due to confusing terminology in<br>
this area we point out other classification different that our simple division in between "aromatic and aliphatic"):<br>

An skilled in the art is able to identify which combination of isocyanate of the group 1 and isocyanate of group 2<br>
will be suitable a priory, and which reaction conditions (dialkyltin fatty ester catalyst, temperature, time) are<br>
needed to reproduce the invention. In a wide range of combinations, the ACDs will react without problems,<br>
except when both types of isocyanates are of very low reactivity and/or the sites for attaching the N-substituted<br>
acetylene carbamide moieties are not appropriate.<br>
The release rate of the microcapsules is mainly controlled by:<br>
Microcapsule size<br>
Degree of cross-linking<br>
Choice of polymer type	<br>
Wall thickness<br>
Mobility of the oil phase<br>
The average particle radius (hence surface area) is generally fixed within narrow limits to satisfy process and<br>
physical stability considerations. The preferred average particle size of the droplets of the water-immiscible<br>
liquid containing the active ingredient is 0.1-200 urn, preferably 0.3-50 urn and more preferably 0.5-20 urn<br><br>
depending on the target. The size of the particles can also be below 0.1 |jm. These particles are called<br>
nanoparticles, and this can be achieved by an appropriate emulsifier (specially incorporating it to the oil phase)<br>
and with an increased speed rate of the shearing-stress while the emulsification takes place. It must be<br>
understood that the use of the polymeric material of this invention in nanocapsules is an obvious application of<br>
this invention.<br>
Particle size can be adjusted according to the end use of the microcapsules by adjusting stirring speed and<br>
time, and by the choice of surfactants and the amount of surfactants employed.<br>
The concentration difference across the wall is generally considered to be a constant when the microcapsule is<br>
exposed to a foliar, water or soil environment. The foliage or soil acts as a sink for the pesticide and hence<br>
pesticide exists at a very low concentration at the outer surface of the microcapsule. Of particular interest is the<br>
use of microcapsules in lakes or water deposits to release insecticides against mosquitoes (e.g., pyriproxyfen,<br>
methoprene, hexaflumuron), where the water is the referred "sink".<br>
If the release rate from the microcapsule needs to be varied over orders of magnitude, the most practical way of<br>
accomplishing this task is to vary the microcapsule wall permeability. The permeability is defined as the product<br>
of the factor diffusion coefficient and the factor solubility coefficient.  For a given pesticide the diffusion<br>
coefficient can be varied by varying the wall thickness and by varying the cross-link density of the wall; varying<br>
the chemical composition of the wall can vary the solubility coefficient. Moreover the chemical structure of the<br>
solvent used for the active ingredient has an influence on the permeability/mobility and in the release rate.<br>
The amount of the organic polyisocyanate and ACD used in the process will determine the wall weight of the<br>
microcapsules formed. In general, the amount of wall forming material comprise usually from about 2 to about<br>
75 percent by weight of the microcapsule. Most preferably the wall will comprise from about 4 to about 15% by<br>
weight, of the microcapsule.	â¢	-<br>
In the case of our invention the amount of wall forming material is about 2-20 % of the oil phase. For a preferred<br>
amount of 6% of wall material, the wall thickness for a microparticle with a mean diameter of 10 urn can be<br>
calculated and is in the range of 100 nm.<br>
For applications where the microcapsules need a specially smaller size (e.g., from 0.5 urn to 10 urn of<br>
average particle size, most preferably from 1 urn to 5 urn, the inventors have found that a oil-soluble surfactant<br>
of the type AtloxÂ® 4912 added to the oil phase before emulsification step, decreases significantly the particle<br>
size. Other block copolymers can be used, preferably composed of polyglycol (e.g., polypropylenglycol) and<br>
poly fatty acids hydroxylated. A preferred concentration in the oil phase is about 5 to 25% of the weight percent<br>
of the sum of wall forming materials.<br>
It is impossible to describe in full in the limited space of a patent disclosure how any formulation could<br>
be achieved using our process. A skilled in the art would need some experimental work to carry out the<br>
invention. The disclosure of the description and the of the examples is in the line of the accepted granted patent<br>
documents, even more detailed in how to manage to obtain microcapsules in between the range of compounds<br>
claimed. With regard of formulations of microcapsules, note that this type of formulations (capsule suspension -<br>
CS- and suspoemulsions -SE-) are tremendously complex per se. Documents providing basic and advanced<br>
knowledge of formulation technology that will allow the skilled in the art to reproduce our invention with unduly<br>
burden are: The e-Pesticide Handbook, British Crop Protection Council; Asaji Kondo. Microcapsules. (1970)<br>

Nikkan Kogyo Shinbun Ltd.; and Kondo et al. Microcapsules (1977) Sankyo Publishing Co., Ltd; Asaji Kondo.<br>
Micrcapsule processing and technology (1979) Marcel Dekker Inc.; N. Cardarelli. Controlled release pesticide<br>
formulations. CRC Press (1976).<br>
It cannot be denied the complexity of the microencapsulation technology, complexity added in the field<br>
of formulation of microcapsules. Critical steps are the emulsification step, that may lead to a phase inversion if<br>
the equipment used (ultraturrax, anchor agitators, pumps) is not very well known to the user, is critical also, the<br>
managment of low relative humidity, reaction times and temperatures adapted to the vessels where the<br>
examples are reproduced, etc. For instance, in Example 1 it has been used a reactor of 2000 L, the repetition of<br>
the same example in a laboratory reactor needs the application of chemical engineering knowledge to<br>
reproduce in the same way the reaction in a small reactor (e.g., 500 mL) the heat transfer conditions and the<br>
turbulence and shear stress produced in such 2000 L reactor.<br>
Our invention is mainly devoted to agrochemical formulations, but by the virtue of the type of wall<br>
material (polyurea+acetylene carbamide), the microcapsules have a glass transition temperature within the<br>
range of room temperature to 200 Â°C, so the material for a capsule wall of a microcapsule obtained shows a<br>
heat response and they are suited to form thermosensitive recording materials, and all applications derived<br>
thereof (inks, fabrics, etc.). For the use of our microcapsules in the field of phase change materials, the process<br>
is similar to that already described. In this case, it is preferred a final product with dried microcapsules, that is<br>
easily achieved by conventional spray-drying of our microcapsules. In this case, it is not important the presence<br>
of the specific emulsifiers or hydrocolloids in order to get a wet formulation of microcapsules for its later use to<br>
dilute in water (as is the case in most agrochemical formulations). In the case of application of our invention to<br>
phase change materials, the main difference is in that the oil phase is mainly composed of a wax or oil -e.g.<br>
hydrogenated vegetable oil- that is able to store and release heat (normally with a melting point in between 0 to<br>
50Â°C), together with the wall forming materials, the catalyst (preferably dibutyltinlaurate) and eventually and<br>
additional solvent of high boiling point and low vapour pressure, to facilitate the microencapsulation of the wax.<br>
It is important to note, that in order to adapt our microcapsules to these applications (e.g., dry<br>
microcapsules for boots, gloves, foams for seats, overall equipment, clothes) the release of the active<br>
ingredient (e.g. a wax of melting point of 37 Â°C) must be avoided correspondently. The water phase, as<br>
explained in the description above, is then only the carrier medium that contains the necessary dispersants,<br>
protective colloids, etc. that are needed for obtaining a suitable dry formulation of microcapsules (and not a<br>
water phase that contains coformulants for final agricultural applications, rather coformulants directed for spray-<br>
drying or other means to remove water and obtain fluid compositions of microcapsules). Of course agricultural<br>
formulations containing our microcapsules in a dry state are very suitable with our microcapsules, but then, the<br>
water phase must be provided with the state in the art dispersants, wetting agents, etc., to be functional in the<br>
field, thing not needed when microencapsulating catalysts or PCMs.<br>
We won't extend in this aspect, because the technique of obtaining dry microcapsules is well-known for<br>
the expert in the field, and our invention does not involve any novelty in this regard. However, our invention<br>
provides the novelty of a new type of microcapsules containing such PCMs (or thermosensitive recording<br>
materials, or catalysts). For this application, then the wall forming materials must be present about 5 to 10<br>
times more (keeping the same ratios) in order to restrict the release of the compounds, and to extend the life of<br><br>
the micorcapsules. This is indeed a controlled release rate, but with the target of the slowest release rate<br>
possible. The "four-fingered" cross-linking provided by our invention of incorporation of the ACDs, (one "finger"<br>
for each substituted nitrogen) allows more flexibility to the microcapsules to resist the pressure stress in such<br>
applications with PCMs (that in turn is also beneficial in agricultural applications with respect stress during<br>
production, packaging of formulations and final use by the farmer in the field -e.g. pressure in the spray<br>
nozzles-).<br>
In the case of microencapsulation of catalysts, it is obvious that a dispersed catalyst in the oil phase<br>
(for example by using AtloxÂ® LP-5 or other oil dispersants) possible to be used as core liquid dispersion to<br>
encapsulate. Already state in the art catalysts (e.g., platinum or palladium catalysts or osmium tetroxyde) are<br>
obvious applications of our invention, namely, to use the advantages or differences of our wall made of ACD-<br>
polyurea compared with common polyurea microencapsulation of catalysts. All the differences mentioned in this<br>
document with regard ACD-polyurea vs. polyurea walls can be applied for such catalysts.      .	.    .<br>
The examples are thus directed to the more complex field of agrochemical formulations provided are a<br>
clear proof that given a target agrochemical formulation, regarding chemical and physicochemical<br>
characteristics, our invention leads (thanks to the uniqueness of the acetylene carbamide monomer<br>
characteristics and process characteristics) to accomplish the task, because we can chose appropriate<br>
quantities of isocyanates (here is disclosed for the first time the real use and good functionality of reactions<br>
using less toxic and reactive isocyanates like TMXDI) and the further parameter new in this invention, the<br>
acetylene carbamide monomer, for matching any demand in terms of particle size, release rate; being the rest<br>
of the coformulants chosen to match the desired density and viscosity and rest of chemical and<br>
physicochemical characteristics, chosen by routinary error and trial tests or by conventional microencapsulation<br>
technology techniques and methods.<br>
For the purpose of this invention, if the skilled in the art wants to reproduce it, it is almost irrelevant<br>
which material is wanted to be microencapsulated. In the case of agrochemicals, the only restrictive condition is<br>
that they do not react with the wall forming materials, thing that can be evaluated by a chemist by the sole view<br>
of the corresponding functional groups of the wall forming materials and the agrochemicals. With respect of<br>
which combinations are adequate, the skilled must be referred to a general book of incompatibility of<br>
agrochemicals, or the own brochures of the agrochemicals' manufacturers. Techniques of milling and<br>
dispersing materials in oil phases are well known, as well how to incorporate solid agrochemicals insoluble in<br>
water to the water phase (e.g., by fine milling). Once the agrochemical to microencapsulated is selected, it<br>
needs to be chosen the wall forming materials. As first choice we recommend the use the compounds and<br>
proportions referred in the description and examples, as well the indicated ratios. When wanting to incorporate<br>
wall forming materials not explicitly disclosed in the examples, then a first assumption on similar reactivity must<br>
be made with due care of comments to this respect done before. If the reaction of the isocyanates is not taking<br>
place, an increase of the temperature must be done and/or increase of the catalyst, as first choice dibutyltin<br>
laurate. If this still does not suffice, then must be considered the reactivity of each isocyanate and exclude the<br>
combinations of isocyanates that by virtue of their low reactivity (data available from the manufacturers) are not<br>
expected to react. In principle, all ACDs claimed are able to react with combination of aromatic and aliphatic<br>
isocyanates, but, again, if this does not happen, then must be increased the reaction temperature and/or the<br><br>
quantity and type of ACD's catalyst (for example change p/ethylsulfonimide by the more strong p-tolueiisulfonic<br>
acid), or modify by error and trial (there is no single theory in this regard in commonly available books) the<br>
ratios of the wall forming materials in the provided ranges. The emulsification is a critical step, and in case of<br>
phase inversions, must be adapted accordingly the shear stress to the volume and geometry of the vessels.<br>
Also, for microcapsules with low content of wall material, care must be taken with too much high shear stress<br>
during formation of oil droplets (may break already fast-formed prepolymeric polyurea walls before<br>
incorporation of ACDs).<br>
With regard release rates, normal knowledge for the chemist specialized in controlled release<br>
formulations is enough in order to select the appropriate isocyanates and ACDs. Obviously, ACDs with longer<br>
alkoxy- or hydroxyalkyl- groups will lead to faster release, because bigger pores. Accordingly, the smaller the<br>
particle size (obtained also by higher shear stress and use of surfactants in the oil phase) the faster the release<br>
rate. Also, the more quantity of wall material in weight % with respect weight of whole filled microcapsule, the<br>
slower will be the release.<br>
In the case of microencapsulation of PCMs, it is obvious that a tight wall is desired, following above<br>
instructions and using more wall material than for agricultural uses. For this purpose is interesting the use of<br>
middle-alkylated chains of ACDs (e.g., N, N'-diethoxymethyl, N", N"'-dimethylolacetylene carbamide), because<br>
although it may increase the pore size on one side with respect to customary state in the art polyurea walls, it<br>
increases, on the other side, the flexibility of the microcapsule and resistance against pressure, that is usual in<br>
the normal applications of PCMs (specialty fabrics or plastic-foams).<br>
In the case of encapsulation of catalysts, the ACDs provide unique release rates that must be adapted<br>
for the purpose of the use of the catalyst: for example, in hydrogenations with microencapsulated polyurea-ACD<br>
palladium, under pressure is convenient to reach higher percentages of ACDs in the wall. On the contrary, for<br>
applications in biotechnology of osmium tetroxide catalyzed reactions, bigger pores are needed, going to ACDs<br>
of relatively high alkyl chains (e.g., tetrabutoxyethyl acetylene carbamide).<br>
With regard specific details about the wall forming materials we disclose, the ACD can be, in some<br>
embodiments, characterized in that where the number of substituents R2, R4, Re, Rs is having the meaning of<br>
hydrogen in the same particular compound (I) is limited to one or two.<br>
The aromatic isocyanate can be a monomeric aromatic isocyanate or a prepolimer aromatic isocyanate, most<br>
preferably a prepolymer aromatic isocyanate.<br>
The aliphatic isocyanate can be a monomer aliphatic isocyanate or a prepolymer aliphatic isocyanate, more<br>
preferably a monomer aliphatic isocyanate.<br>
A preferred aromatic isocyanate has the formula (II), and structurally chemical related mono, di and tri<br>
isocyanatate substituted toluene oligomerized compounds.<br><br><br>
wherein n=0 to n=6, most preferably n=1.<br>
A preferred aromatic isocyanate is diphenylmethane-4-4'-diisocyanate, optionally, and blends of isomers and<br>
homologues.<br>
A preferred aliphatic isocyanate is m-tetramethylxylene diisocyanate and/or<br>
The aliphatic isocyanate (even in singular) must be interpreted as optionally a mixture different aliphatic<br>
isocyanates, accordingly the same for the aromatic isocyanates.<br>
We direct a claim to a polymer according claim 1 characterized in that the polymer is formed by the reaction of<br>
wall forming materials where the ACDs are mixture of different compounds with different substituents according<br>
claim formula (I).<br>
Regarding oligomerizated ADCs, we explicitly claim mixture of compounds (I) in the form of oligomers up to 10<br>
mols per molecule, being the sum of the quantity of monomers, dimers, trimers and tetramers at least 75% in<br>
weight-% of the total ACD mixture as defined in claim 3 in weight-%.<br>
The ACD used may be a single compound represented by the formula (I).<br>
The ACDs can be composed of substituted acetylene carbamide monomeric and/or low oligomerized (from 2<br>
to 10 monomers per molecule) and/or non-polymerized compounds (I), being the content high polymerized<br>
monomers -more than 100 monomers per molecule- lower than 10% in weight % with respect the content of<br>
monomers in weight percent, preferably less than 0.5% in weight %.<br>
It is also of interest where 100% of the solution of mixed ACDs is composed of monomeric substituted<br>
acetylene carbamide derivatives (I) where at least one substituent of Ri, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, Rs is different to<br>
the others.<br>
The polymer according any suitable preceding claim or combination of preceding claims characterized<br>
in that compound of claim 1 i) (c), is a acetylene carbamide derivative with low hydroxyalkyl content (up to 50%)<br>
in such a way the degree of polymerization trough the hydroxyalkyl groups is not too high, allowing a<br>
microcapsule's wall formed with the polymer of claim 1 to be conveniently porous for controlled release, being<br>
the term suitability of the control release understood as a expert in agrochemistry would interpret at the view of<br>
commercially suitable products.<br>
The polymer of claim 1 or 2 characterized in that compound (I), is chosen as a single ACD compound in<br>
monomeric and/or dimeric and/or trimeric form, and not as a mixture of different compounds comprised in the<br>
formula (I).<br>
A mixture of compound(s) (I) may have a hydroxymethyl content up to 40%, in particular, the sum of number<br>
the groups R2, R4, R6, Rs of a compound i) (c) or mixture of compounds i) (c) wherein the groups that take the<br>
value of hydrogen is not more than 40% of the total sum of all types of groups R2, R4, R6, Rs in the compound<br>
or mixture of compounds.<br>
It can be used any polymer abovementioned characterized in that the solution is mainly -as far as the industrial<br>
production of compounds (I) allows it- composed of monomeric compounds (I) where all the substituents R-i, R2,<br>
R3, R4 are equal among them, R5, R6, R7, Rs are equal among them and R9 and R10 are hydrogen atoms.<br><br>

Most preferred compounds (I) are N, N', N", N"'-tetramethoxymethyl acetylene carbamide and N, N', N", N1"-<br>
tetrabutoxymethyl acetylene carbamide, to be used alone or in combination.<br>
The compound (I) or mixture of compounds (I) may be used even being solid at 20 Â°C or more, by means of<br>
dissolution or dispersion in the oil phase. In that case, the compound (I) or mixture of compounds (I) is/are<br>
dissolved and/or dispersed in a suitable organic solvent to allow the incorporation of the solid into the liquid<br>
mixture of polymer forming materials, for example in gamma-butyrolactone or naphtha solvent (Solvesso 100,<br>
150NDor200ND).<br>
We direct a set of claims regarding the process as explained above, but for a more detailed clarification, we will<br>
refer to the following:<br>

The best way to understand the complexity invention is through the examples presented below, that complete<br>
the needs of a person skilled in the art to reproduce the invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Here is disclosed the way of preparation of a microencapsulated formulation of<br>
Flurochloridone at a concentration of 25 % (wt/wt).<br>
In kg    <br>
Organic Phase:<br>
Flurochloridone (50%) in Solvessoâ¢ 150	500<br>
Benzene, 1,3-Bis(1-isocyanate-1-methylethyl)-diisocyanate (TMXDI)	10<br>
Diphenylmethane-4,4'-diisocyanate (PMD!)	18<br>
Dibutyltin laurate	0.03<br>
Tetraethoxymetyl acetylene carbamide	4<br>
Gamma-butyrolactone	3<br>
Water Phase:<br>
Water (added independently from the other solutions)	232<br>
10 % water solution of xanthan gum	20<br>
20 % water solution of PVP-30	10<br>
35 % water solution of Arabic gum	50   <br>
LignoGATâ¢	40<br>
Antimussolâ¢ 4459	0.25<br>
Citric Acid	0.14<br>
Reaxâ¢ 85A	0.25<br><br>
LignoGATâ¢ is a proprietary solution here disclosed composed of water: Celvolâ¢ 205 : Kraftsperseâ¢<br>
25M in which the ratios vary according (respectively): 60-70% : 5-15% : 5-30%. In this particular case, the ratio<br>
is 65 : 5 : 30.<br>
When both phases are well-mixed in a separate reactors [important to note that some heating is needed to<br>
incorporate the solid crystals of cis-Flurochloridone, with a melting point of about 71 Â°C], they oil phase is<br>
incorporated at about 50 Â°C slowly to the water phase (at 35 Â°C and pH adjusted to 6.5 with citric acid),<br>
emulsifying the organic phase into small droplets in a continuous aqueous phase with a high shear agitator at<br>
about 2500 rpm (in a typical cylindrical 2,000 L reactor) for 15 minutes. Then, the high shear agitator isstopped<br>
and only an anchor stirrer is set to 50 rpm. The wall forming material present in the organic phase (isocyanates<br>
and acetylene carbamide monomer) reacts with water at the oil/water interface to form a pre-wall capsule<br>
around the oil droplet containing the active ingredient Flurochloridone. Temperature is increased to 50 Â°C at the<br>
beginning of reaction. Then 0.15% (w/w) of p-Toluenesulfonic acid (dissolved in isopropanol), is added to<br>
terminate polymerization in the water phase side and wall forming reactions. Further, the mixture is at about 48<br>
Â°C for five hours. This way, it is avoided any residue of isocyanates and/or free acetylene carbamide<br>
monomers. Then, the mixture is allowed to cool down. The pH is checked and is adjusted to pH = 9.5 to 10 with<br>
a 50% watery solution of NaOH. Finally, the following solution for stabilization purposes is added:<br>
In kg<br>
NaOH	3<br>
Water	64<br>
Keltrol	0.7<br>
Pangel S9	5.5<br>
Na2CO3	4.8<br>

Germalâ¢ II	0.5<br>
BHA + BHT (ratio 1:1)	0.5<br>
Cyasorbâ¢UV-1164L	1<br>
The finished formulation is let to homogenize with an anchor stirrer at 100 rpm, and then is filtered through a<br>
100 urn nylon sieve.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Resulting microcapsules according process of Example 1 and comparison with commercial Flurochloridone CS<br>
250 g/l (Racerâ¢).<br>
The microcapsules of Example 1 are shown in Fig. 1.<br><br><br>
Note that flurochloridone has two isomers (cis and trans) with different melting point, and our invention<br>
allows encapsulation of both solid and liquid materials (even adsorbed/absorbed/solubilized gas materials in a<br>
solid or liquid support) easily.<br>
IR analysis of Racerâ¢ CS show that the capsules' wall is composed of TDI and PAPI, while in our<br>
invention the TDI is replaced by the much less toxic and less reactive TMXDI. Our special conditions of<br>
encapsulation allow us to match perfectly the physiochemical and chemical (regarding agricultural use)<br>
characteristics of Racerâ¢, with a complety different capules' wall composition, protective colloid (by LC-MS<br>
identified as type of Daxadâ¢ 23 in Racerâ¢), primary emulsifier (by LC-MS and chemical sample preparation<br>
identified in Racerâ¢ as type of Pluronicâ¢ L64), and other coformulants.<br>
We have observed that the microcapsules according our process show an spherical three-dimensional<br>
structure, however, the spheres have sometimes a depression (DEP) in the surface -indicated in Figures 1 and<br>
2 by the arrow- (sometimes, the surface corresponding to the invaginated area is almost half of the total<br>
capsule's surface), that we have not found in other commercial microencapsulated agrochemicals either in<br>
microcapsules for other purposes. The specific reaction TMXDI + PAPI + acetylene carbamide monomer is<br>
believed to the reason of this effect.<br>
The determination of unencapsulated active ingredient is made as follows (for this and the rest of the<br>
examples):<br>
Filtration of the formulation sample suspended in water:<br>
-100mg of CS sample suspended in 15ml water-dipropylene glycol mix<br>
-Filter through glas fiber filter<br>
-Wash with 2 x 5ml water-dipropylene glycol mix<br>
-Determination of a.i. in the filtrate by HPLC-UV or GC-FID analysis<br><br>
The HPLC conditions we used normally wereL iChrospher 100 CN - 5|jm, 250 x 4 mm; Column thermostat:<br>
32Â°C; Injection volume: 10ul; Mobile phase: 97% (v/v) n-Hexane, 3% (v/v) Isopropanol; Flow: 1ml / min;<br>
Detector: at 240nm; Analysis time: 35.0 minutes.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
A formulation as described in Example 1 was made, in which the wall forming material was replaced by<br>
the prepolymerized etherified urea formaldehyde resin, Beetleâ¢ 80, being the prepolymerization based on the<br>
process suggested in US 6,485,736. Then the whole quantity of Tetramethoxymetyl acetylene carbamide and<br>
isocyanates were substituted accordingly from the wall forming materials, and the gamma-butyrolactone<br>
removed from the formula. A detail of the microcapsules present in the formulation of flurochloridone just after<br>
finishing the process exactly carried out as in example 1 (with the above modifications) (detail in Figure 3),<br>
being the particle size irregular, and that the microcapsules are bigger and release immediately the content into<br>
the water phase. The mean particle size is 29.3 urn, and the percentile 90 is 71.64 urn, making the<br>
microcapsules inadequately big and too fragile.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
In the laboratory, further formulations as in Example 3 were prepared, using the same wt% ratios as in<br>
example 1, but for 1 L of finished formulation. 14 reactors with cooling and heating system (water shirt) of<br>
volume 2L were set in series.<br>
After final emulsification, corresponding pH adjustments and final stability solution addition, stirring and<br>
allowing the final mixture to reach room temperature, the particle size was immediately measured, meaning<br>
Perc. 90 the statistic "Percentil 90" (10% of the microcapsules have a mean diameter than the value given). The<br>
active ingredient unencapsulated is measured by centrifugation the microcapsules and then analyzing the<br>
supranatant in a GC-FID, with a validated analytical method. The emulsion stability was tested according the<br>
FAO/WHO spefications for emulsion stability of lambda-cyhalothrin CS (a formulation of the same type<br>
(capsules suspension), this document incorporated herein by reference. Only values with "very good emulsion<br>
stability" score comply with the requirems of oil/cream separation and formation of crystals in the emulsified<br>
formulation in water. The crystallization has been subjectively (but consistant in between appreciations of<br>
different samples) ranked, according to observation of 5 samples of the undiluted formulation at the microscope<br>
at objectives x10 and x40. In Figure 4 we show the crystals in Ex. 4-1 after 240 hours of storage at 35 Â°C.<br>
Results are as follows:<br><br><br><br>
We can observe that the only acceptable formulations are those formulated with ACDs, and of these,<br>
those commercial compounds containing a significant amount of monomers (or dimers or timers) (Ex 4-11, 4-<br>
12, 4-13 and 1) give the best results. However those acetylene carbamide cross-linkers containing a lower<br>
amount of monomers result in higher particle sizes. Ex. 4-8, based on a benzoguanamin resin, is interesting in<br>
the sense of that the particle size of the microcapsules is very appropriate, presents a very good emulsification<br>
properties, but we realize that only with manipulation for observing the capsules in the microscope a significant<br>
part of them are broken. All the melamine and urea compounds showed a bad performance, with high amounts<br><br>
of unencapsulated Flurochloridone and subsequent formation of crystals. In examples 4-8, we could observe<br>
reversible agglomeration as shown in Figure 5.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
In the following example, we have used a different primary emulsifier and protective colloid system. As<br>
in previous examples, we refer to Example 1 as a model, and here we perform some modifications The solution<br>
LignoGATâ¢, based in a polymeric product of reaction containing lignosulfonates has been replaced (and in the<br>
same quantity) by Agrimerâ¢ AL10 and PVP 15 (ration in wt.% 1 : 1). In this process we have<br>
microencapsulated Quizalofop-pethyl dissolved in Solvesso 100 at 50% (warm).<br>
In order to reduce the particle size (that is expected to be bigger because the change of LignoGATâ¢ to<br>
this new mixture) the speed of the high shear stress stirrer has been increased to 3500 rpm for 5 minutes. The<br>
resulting microcapsules had a mean particle size of 5.1 urn and a percentile 90 of 8.3 urn. Emulsification<br>
properties (5% of the formulation in water in a 100 mL measuring cylinder) show no separation of phases after<br>
2 h, no crystal formation. The wet sieving residue -150 urn-, was 0.03% and dispersibility and suspensibility<br>
were, respectively, 81% and 89%.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
In this example we microencapsulate according Example 1 with same components and proportions (to<br>
make 1 L of formulation) except the following:<br>
Ex. 5-1: isocyanate mixture TMXDI and PAPI and Powderlinkâ¢ 1174 [exactly like in Ex. 1]<br>
Ex. 5-1: isocyanate mixture TDI and PAPI.<br>
In both trials we have encapsulated fenvalerate, also dissolved in an hydrocarbon-based solvent at 50%<br>
(Marcolâ¢) -with previous mild warming to 50 Â°C and mixing, then letting the mixture to cool down. The final<br>
formulation is then an Esfenvalerate 250 g/l Capsules Suspension (assuming density=1 g/cm3).<br>
Results are shown in the following table:<br><br>
As we can see, the reaction with TDA and PAPI resulted in a acceptable particle size of the capsules formed,<br>
however the amount of unencapsulated material was too high (32%) -analysis by centrifugation and HPLC-UV<br>
of supranatant-. We observed that the reaction proceeded with vigorous develop of CO2, and a sudden<br>
temperature increase was noticed (the 2 L reactor went up to 75 Â°C in Ex. 5-2, while the Ex. 5-1 the maximum<br>
temperature registered was 58 Â°C). Observation under the microscope showed that a number of microscopic<br><br>
pieces of wall material had reacted without forming a wall (thus no microencapsulated material). All these<br>
pointed out that the process with the more reactive TDI was uncontrolled (not enough time to allow a.good<br>
emulsification at the same time that the wall material is formed), namely, the process with TDI is less<br>
predictable and less able to be manipulated than the process with TMXDI + PAPI + ACD.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
A formulation of lambda-cyhalothrin was made according to the following formula (500 L). We have splitted the<br>
components according their functionality. The first Table Ex. 6.1 is referring for the water phase and the oil<br>
phase up to the emulsification / encapsulation needed materials. In Table Ex. 6.2 we have the compounds that<br>
account for the stability of the formulation. To achieve 100% of the formulation,<br><br><br><br><br>
invention, is a further objective to be able to accomplish the release rate, and the chemical equivalence of the<br>
inert ingredients to already registered products already in the market (for marketing permits purposes).<br>
Underlying our own invention, and surprisingly, we have found that with the correct choice of appropriate<br>
acetylene carbamide compounds, surfactant and stabilization system and reaction conditions, the<br>
physicochemical characteristics of the commercial formulations as a whole (namely, the parameters regarding<br>
laws like EEC 91/414, FAO/WHO Specifications, etc) may be accomplished by our invention, surpresively and<br>
in rather different way to the previous art. It is precisely the choice of low reactive glycolurils, the mild conditions<br>
of reaction (temperatures much lower than teached in prior art documents), the avoidance of further amines or<br>
sulfurated compounds as catalysts or wall forming materials, and the termination accomplished by organic<br>
acids, what allow us to make tailor-made formulations with a targeted release rate (wheter fast Oder prolonged)<br>
and biological efficacy.<br>
In order to demonstrate this, we have made a comparison of our microencapsulated process for<br>
obtaining a commercial formulation of lambda-cyhalothrin according EEC 91/414. The reference material is a<br>
sample of Karateâ¢ Zeon 10 CS.<br>
Encapsulation of GAT Lambda-cyhalothrin 10 CS (GAT-ICy) was done according to the process<br>
described in Ex 6 (with regard of an extensive explanation of the process, this has being disclosed in full in<br>
previous examples and/or in the description). The above given values are always a mean of 10 different<br>
samples, and statistical differences are evaluated by t-student's test, with appropriate transformation for<br>
normalization of data by arcsin(sqrt(x)) for percentage values.<br>
In Figure 7 we can see that the particle size of the formulation is very similarly distributed according to our<br>
invention, but differences are not significant, either in mean or percentile 90, and both products comply with<br>
FAO Specifications.<br>
Regarding suspensibility, FAO specifies a minimum of 80% Lambda-Cyhalothrin found in suspension<br>
after 30 minutes in CIPAC standard water D. Both products are well above of the minimum, GAT-ICy and KZ<br>
showed equally 99.2% of suspensibility, with no significant differences in t-Student's test.<br>
The spontaneity of dispersion in [%] was determined according to CIPAC MT 160. The FAO specifies a<br>
minimum of 90% Lambda-Cyhalothrin found in suspension after 5 minutes in CIPAC standard water D at 30 Â± 2<br>
Â°C. GAT-ICy shows 92% of dispersion, while KZ shows 94%, but with no significant differences in the t-<br>
Student's test.<br>
The pourability in [%] was determined according to CIPAC MT 148. Regularly, the viscosity is<br>
measured in the laboratory to predict how the pourability will be (it is faster, cheaper and easier to measure the<br>
viscosity), but the FAO specifications only point out to this test of pourability, because is the "real" effect on how<br>
the viscosity can influence the product: namely, make it difficult to handle or, in partiular, to take the content out<br>
of the agrochemical package or bottle, and to rinse the bottles for environmental reasons. The FAO specifies a<br>
maxiumum "residue" of 1.5%. The pourability of GAT-ICy is equivalent to the pourability of KZ and complies<br>
with the FAO Specification 463/CS (2003) for the "residue after rinsing". Values (having no significant statistical<br>
differences) were:<br>
Residue and residue after rinsing, respectively, for GAT-ICy: 2.6 % and 0.3 %<br>
Idem for KZ: 2.1 % and 0.3 %, with not statistical significant differences.<br><br>
The persistent foam in [mL] after 1 minute was determined according to CIPAC MT 47.2. and none of the<br>
samples presented any persistent foam after 1 minute.<br>
All together, both samples comply with FAO specifications and they not differ statistically in any value.<br>
EXAMPLE 8<br>
Release rate of GAT-ICy and KZ.<br>
For the release rate we have used the OECD guideline for the testing of chemicals No. 428. The<br>
formulations tested have been (pairwise) GAT-ICy 10 g/L and GAT-ICy 5 g/L (produced according example 6)<br>
compared with Syngenta products of same characteristics (KZ 10 g/L and KZ 5 g/L). One experimental trial was<br>
performed for each sample.<br>
The resuts are shown in Fig. 8 and 9. It can be appreciated that GAT-ICy has initially a faster release in<br>
both types of samples (due to the partially broader pores in the microcapsules originated by the four-fingered<br>
acetylene carbamide used). However, at the conditions of the analysis, the content of lambda cyhalothrin in the<br>
receptor cells in the case of KZ (both 5 CS and 10 CS) is lower.<br>
EXAMPLE 9<br>
A suspoemulsion was made containing 250 g/L of Metazachlor and 33.3 g/L of Clomazone. In a<br>
suspoemulsion, a solid finely milled or dispersed or emulsified active ingredient is in the continous water<br>
phase, while the discontinuous phase is constituted by microcapsules. We refer in this example how to prepare<br>
the microencapsulated part of the suspoemulsion, namely, microcapsules of clomazone. The suspension<br>
concentrate that forms part of the formulation, being that concentrate a milled and dispersed Metazachlor<br>
(technical was produced according the expired patent DE 2849442, more exactly according the example that<br>
discloses monoclinic metazachlor suspension. Metazachlor can also be produced according to EP 12216<br>
according examples 2 (a) or (b) or example 4 (a) or (b) or (c).<br>
The formula of the capsule suspension of clomazone consists in the following ingredients, being the process as<br>
the one used for microencapsulation of lambda-cyhalothrin:<br>
Ingredients<br>
Oil phase	parts<br>
Powder link 1174 (60% in gamma -   â Rf)<br>

This formulation has the characteristics shown in Figures 11 (particle size) and Figure 12 (viscosity). A<br>
picture of the microcapsules is shown in Figure 6.<br>
EXAMPLE 10<br>
A flame retardant material (antimony oxide) was microencapsulated according this invention together the phase<br>
change material (PCM) perfluorodecane, according the process disclosed in this invention. The water phase<br>
was later sprayed dried in order to obtain a fluid formulation of microcapsules.<br>
EXAMPLE 11<br>
The following microencapsulations of fluroxypyr were done, according the formula of clomazone-capsule<br>
suspension example 9,  and the water phase of example 6. As a comparative test we performed the<br>
microencapsulation according the state of the art using TDI and PAPI, that showed an average particle size of<br>
2.73 urn and a percentile 90 of 15.79 urn.<br>
The measurements of each example are represented in Figure 10, and were done accordingly to the<br>
microcapsules themselves.<br>
We tested the wall forming material when composed of:<br>
SpecflexNE138	2.25 parts<br>
TMXDI	   1.12 parts<br>
ACD as follows:<br>
Example 11-1 Trimetoxymethoxymethyl monometylol acetylene carbamide . 0.80 parts<br>
Example 11-2 Tetramethoxymethyl acetylene carbamide	 0.80 parts<br>
Example 11-3 Tetramethoxymethyl acetylene carbamide	 0.90 parts<br>
Example 11-4 Tetrabutoxymethyl acetylene carbamide	  0.50 parts<br>
Example 11 -5 Tetrapenthoxybutoxyl acetylene carbamide	 1.00 parts<br><br>
The results are shown in Fig 12, where differences are appreciated according the type and quantity of<br>
acetylene carbamide derivative.<br>
EXAMPLE 12<br>
Two formulations were made: the one according example 6 (Ex. 12-1) and the same formulation but replacing<br>
the wall forming material TMXDI by TXDI, and removing the presence of 3% of tetramethoxymethyl acetylene<br>
carbamide (ex. 12-2).<br>
The content of residual isocyanates was tested by derivatization of the sample with 1-(9-<br>
anthracenenylmethyl)pyperazine and detection at 254 nm on the HPLC-UV. Since the purpose of the analysis<br>
was comparative, it was not made a quantitation in weight percent. However, the AU units of the UV-absorption<br>
is a definite check (for equally injected 10 uL from solutions 50 mg/mL in acetonitrile of sample) to compare the<br>
amount of residual TDI, TMXDI and PAPI (as far as they coelute simultaneously). The results showed that Ex.<br>
12-1 had AU value of 641 mV (above limit of detection), while Ex. 12-2 had AU value of 11 mV (below limit of<br>
detection). Thus, the use of ACD prevented the presence of residual isocyanates in the agrochemical<br>
formulation.<br><br>
