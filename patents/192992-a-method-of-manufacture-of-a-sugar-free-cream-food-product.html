  a sugar<br>
free, cream food product.<br>
Consequent to increase in health consciousness, dietetic  foods<br>
have gained importance especially in recent tiaies.  Foods which<br>
are  rich in calories and are therefore detriaiental  to  health<br>
are sought to be avoided by a large section of the public.<br>
It is therefore an object of this invention to propose a sugar<br>
free  cream  food  product  to meet  the  requirements  of  the<br>
restricted sugar intake population.<br>
Conventionally,  a food product such as a biscuit, is  made  by<br>
mixing  vegetable fat, sugar, colour, flavour, butter,  skimmed<br>
milk   powder  and  water, among  other  ingredients  (creaming<br>
stage).  Next wheat flour is prepared into dough (dough  making<br>
stage).   The dough is mixed with the creaming stage  mass  and<br>
baked, to obtain the end product.<br>
On  the  other hand, artificial sweeteners, due to  their  high<br>
""^'  intensity  sweetness, can only be used in a miniscule quantity,<br>
-a*   when  compared  to  the quantity of sugar  used  for  the  same<br>
"^   product.   Consequently, in the conventional methods  employed,<br>
§^   straightaway mixing a low quantity of artificial sweeteners  in Co<br>
the  product  will not result in uniform  distribution  of  the<br>
former  in the latter.   In such a case the product  loses  its<br>
tf^	characteristic taste, colour, freshness.<br>
t^    Our  co-pending  Application   No.327/MAS/2001  relates  to   a<br>
O    process  for  the  manufacture  of a sugar   free,  nutritious,<br>
t»4    food product.  This   invention   proposes a  process  for  the<br>
manufacture    of   a   sugar   free   cream    food   product, which  despite  the  absence   of   sugar,   still  retains the<br><br>
desirable characteristics referred to above.<br>
It is well known that a "cream biscuit* comprises two biscuits disposed one on top of the other with a layer of cream in between, in sandwich formation. Such cream layer is generally of high sugar content.<br>
Among various uses to which the cream product proposed herein can be put, the said food product can be used as a cream layer between biscviits to obtain a "cream biscuit", with this difference, namely, that such layer Is sugar free. Thus, with the use of such a layer, while the real taste, colour and freshness of the conventional cream layer comes through, the sugar free aspect will meet the requirements of the restricted sugar Intake population.<br>
Alternatively, the cream product proposed herein can be substituted In the place of conventional cream products, to provide the benefits of sugar free cream intake.<br>
According  to this invention,  artificial  Bweetener(s) are  first mixed with at least one low  calorie  bulking agent, to ensure uniform distribution of the  sweetener<br><br>
in the cream.<br>
The method of manufacture of a sugar free cream food product, according to this invention, comprises the preparation of a premix of (I) at least one artificial sweetener selected from aspartame (0.23 - 0.33X by weight), acesulfame -K (0.2 - 0.3% by weight), sucralose (0.07 - 0.1% by weight) and (li&gt; at least one low calorie bulking agent such as inulin (40 - 50% by weight), o1igofructose (40-50% by weight); adding to the said premix skimmed milk powder (15 - 20% by weight), edible starch (5 - 7% by weight), fat (25 30% by weight), emulsifier lecithin (0.05 - 0.1% by weight), colouring and flavouring agents to provide colour and flavour at the desired level; and thoroughly mixing al1 the foregoing Ingredients to obtain the said product of a predetermined consistency.<br>
It  is  essential to first prepare a   pre-mix  of  the artificial  sweetener(s)  and the low  calorie  bulking agent   and  thereafter  mix  the  other   Ingredients therewith,   for   proper  distribution  of   the   said sweetener(s).<br>
Uhen a combination of two sweeteners are used In the mix, they will be used in the proportion range 20;80 to 90 :10<br><br>
EXAMPLE<br>
0.33 % by weight aspartame or 0.1% by weight of <bucraiose or by weight of acesulfame k are mixed with inulin. this is further fat such as vegetable oil edible starch tapioca maize skimmed milk powder emulsifier lecithin and colouring flavouring agents to obtain the final proposed cream product.></bucraiose>
