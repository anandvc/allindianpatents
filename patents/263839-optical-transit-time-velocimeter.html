"OPTICAL TRANSIT TIME VELOCIMETER".<br>

PHOTON CONTROL INC., a Corporation organized under the laws of Canada of 8540 Baxter Place, Burnaby, British Columbia V5A 4T8, Canada.<br>
3.	PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
COMPLETE<br>
The following Specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
l<br><br>
OPTICAL TRANSIT TIME VELOCIMETER<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]        The present invention relates generally to velocimeters for<br>
measuring the speed of flowing fluids. More specifically, the invention relates to optical velocimeters which determine the velocity of a fluid carrying particles by measuring the transit times of the particles through a test area between two focused light beams. <br><br>
Background<br>
[0002]       One optical method for measuring fluid velocity is known in<br>
the art as "laser-two-focus" (L2F) velocimetry. L2F velocimetry is based<br>
	on detection of light pulses caused by particles crossing two focused laser beams, and determining the average lapse time it takes for particles to move with the fluid from one focused beam to the other. The flow velocity is calculated by dividing the spacing between two laser beams by the lapse time. The flow velocity can be measured using L2F velocimetery to an accuracy of within 0.01% based on accurate beam focusing and fast digital signal processing. For this reason, L2F velocimetery is particularly suitable for study of complex flow of gases and transparent liquids. Other applications include measurement of gases in the pipes at very lo\v (slower than 0.lm/s) to very high (faster than 100m/s) speeds. Such high range is necessary for measurement of fluctuated gases such as flare gases in large pipes.<br>
[0003]          There exist L2F velocimeters for measuring complex fluid<br>
flow in small pipes and channels such as ones used in turbomachinery (e.g., U.S. Patents No. 3,941,477 to Schodl and No. 4,707,130 to Hofmann et al.). Such systems include a housing with an optical illumination system configured to direct two laser sheets through the flow, and an optical collection system to collect light which is back-scattered light by particles<br><br>
2 <br>
in the flowand to focus it into two photodetectors. The optical axis of the collection system is parallel to the sheets of light. The illumination system sends the light through a central area of the collection system, which collects the light back-scattered from the particles received in a peripheral area.<br>
    [0004]        Referring to Hoffmann et al, which discloses an example<br>
optical arrangement of this first type of prior art, the optical arrangement includes a laser and a splitter which create two parallel beams, and a lens<br>
and two mirrors configured to direct the beams through an optical cell having a convex lens and a concave lens which focus the beams on two test points. Light from the two beams is back scattered from the test points through the optical cell and another lens and directed onto photomultipliers through a shutter.<br><br>
     [0005]       One shortcoming of such systems is that the intensity of back-scattered light is much lower than of forward-scattered light This reduces the signal-to-noise ratio to such a degree mat such systems generally require particle seeding (adding particles to the flow) to operate.<br>
Particle seeding, however, is not allowed in many petrochemical applications such as natural gas pipelines, flare stacks and venting pipes.<br>
      [0006]	Such systems also do not allow for the cost effective design<br>
     of compact velocimeters to be used in large pipes, because if the testing<br>
	  area is placed far from the housing, there must be a proportional increase<br>
in the size of the aperture of the optical collection system. Large optical            systems increase the cost of the velocimeter.<br>
        [0007]	Another type of prior art optical gas flow meter which is<br>
	    based on a L2F velocimeter comprises a housing rigidly mounted to a plate<br>
       providing direct access to the fluid flow in a pipe (e.g., U.S. Patent No.<br><br>
3 <br>
6,128,072 to Kiel et al.). The optical collection system detects the forward-scattered light but it is displaced at a certain angle from the optical axis of the illumination system in order to avoid capturing the unscattered light. <br><br>
[0008]	Referring to Kiel et al., which discloses an example optical<br>
arrangement of this second type of prior art, the optical arrangement is based on a plate with a central hole that preferably matches the inside diameter of the pipe through which the fluid flows. An optical fiber<br>
 mounted on the plate terminates at a collimator to direct light from the fiber to a prism which splits the light into two beams. The beams are reflected by a mirror and focused by a cylindrical lens to create two parallel beams through a measurement volume. Light from the beams is scattered by particles passing through the measurement volume and a<br>
 portion of the scattered light is collected by a refractive doublet and<br>
focused to an image point. The light is preferably collected at an angle in the range of 5 to 25 degrees from the direction of the parallel beams.<br>
[0009]	One drawback of this second type of prior art velocimeter is<br>
that it is not suitable for pipes of various diameters, since the plate and<br>
optical system must be designed individually for each pipe size. Also, the off-axis location of the optical collection system reduces collection efficiency of the collection system because it only accepts the scattered light in a limited solid angle. Furthermore, it is not practical to insert this second type of prior art velocimeter into very large pipelines.<br>
[0010]	Another disadvantage of the second type of prior art systems<br>
is that optical meters installed in pipelines can be affected by window fouling. Accordingly, it is necessary to have a housing which will allow removing the optics for cleaning purpose without depressurizing the pipe. Removing the plate according to the above art requires a complex<br>
4<br><br>
mechanical setup which with combination of complex high-pressure fiber optic feed-through makes the meter expensive.<br>
[0011]	Prior art L2F velocimeters can be accurate. However, they<br>
tend to determine the fluid velocity in a limited testing area where laser beams are focused. This makes them vulnerable to differences in velocity across the flow profile. Kiel et al. discloses a multi-point L2F velocimeter wherein one testing area is located in the center of the pipe and a number of testing areas are located a quarter-radius distance from the wall. The quarter-radius location is less susceptible to flow profile, according to fluid dynamic calculations. Multi-point L2F velocimeters, however, require complex optical systems to create multiple testing zones across the flow profile.<br>
         [0012]	Therefore, there is a need for optical velocimeters which do<br>
not require particle seeding and which are suitable for fluid velocity measurement in pipes of various diameters. There is also a need for velocimeters having housings that are easily removable from fluid carrying pipes for cleaning purposes and maintenance.<br><br>
Summary of Invention<br>
[0013]	One embodiment of the invention provides a L2F velocimeter<br>
comprising a probe which may be inserted into a flowing fluid. The probe has an optical illumination system and an optical collection system which are coaxial. The illumination system directs light through the fluid, and the collection system collects forward scattered light which passes through the fluid.<br>

           Description<br>
[0016]	Throughout the following description, specific details are set<br>
forth in order to provide a more thorough understanding of the invention. However, the invention may be practiced without these particulars. In other instances, well known elements have not been shown or described in detail to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the invention. Accordingly, the<br>
6 <br>
specification and drawings are to be regarded in an illustrative, rather than a restrictive, sense.<br>
[0017]	One embodiment of the invention provides a L2F velocimeter<br>
        comprising a probe which may be inserted into a flowing fluid. The probe has an optical illumination system and an optical collection system which are coaxial. The illumination system directs a pair of light sheets through an open area of the probe through which the fluid flows. The light sheets are perpendicular to the flow direction, and separated by a predetermined<br>
          distance along a direction parallel to the flow direction. Particles in the flow which pass through the two sheets scatter the light, causing fluctuations in the scattered light. The collection system collects forward scattered light which passes through the fluid.  An electro-optical assembly receives the collected light and determines a lapse time between<br>
         the fluctuations caused by the particles by monitoring the fluctuations. The collection system may comprise a mirror, such that the length of the probe may be reduced, thereby reducing disturbance of the flow and allowing measurement of the flow velocity in pipes having a smaller diameter.<br><br>
[0018]	Figure 1 shows a L2F velocimeter according to one<br>
embodiment of the present invention. The velocimeter includes a probe 60 with a distal end 62 that is inserted into a fluid and a proximal end 64 to provide mechanical support of the probe and to mount a cable 66. The<br>
           cable 66 connects the probe 60 with an electro-optical assembly 68. The distal end of the probe 60 has an open area 70 through which fluid can pass. An optical illumination system (not shown in Figure 1) receives light from the electro-optical assembly 68 and creates two light sheets 72 and 74 in the middle of the open area 70 through which particles are carried by<br>
           the fluid. Light scattered by the particles is collected by an optical<br>
7 <br>
collection system which is coaxial with the optical illumination system and returned to the electro-optical assembly-68.<br>
[6019]	Figure 2 illustrates the optical illumination and collection<br>
       systems of the velocimeter of Figure 1. The optical Illumination system includes an illumination ferrule 80, a coupling lens 81 and a cylindrical lens 82. The illumination system is located in a central aperture 84 of a focusing assembly 86. The focusing assembly 86 comprises first and second lenses 109 and 110. The optical collection system comprises a<br>
           mirror 88 with an obscuration 90 in the center, and the focusing assembly 86. Hie mirror 88 is located coaxially with an optical axis 92 of the coupling lens 81. the cylindrical lens 82 and lenses 109 and 110 of the focusing assembly 86. A collection ferrule 94 is positioned along the optical axis 92 and behind the illumination ferrule 80 in the image plane<br>
         created by the focusing assembly 86. Two illumination fibers 96 and 98 are coupled to the illumination ferrule 80 and two collection fibers 100 and 102 are coupled to the collection ferrule 94. The fibers 96, 98, 100 and 102 are combined in the optical cable 66 shown in Figure 1. A window 104 is preferably located between the coupling lens 81 and the open area<br>
          70 to protect the lens system and fiber optics from the environment. The cylindrical lens 82 may be located in an aperture in the middle of the window 104. The mirror may be protected by another window (not shown).<br>
         [0020]        The. cylindrical lens 82 spreads the light from fibers 96 and 98 into bright light sheets 106 and 108 in the open area 70, which correspond to light sheet 72 and 74 of Figure 1. The size of the obscuration 90 is selected to absorb all direct light coming from the fibers 96 and 98. Light, scattered from particles crossing the light sheets with the fluid flow, is<br>
           collected by the mirror 88. The mirror 88 reflects and collimates the light to the focusing assembly 86. A peripheral zone of the first lens 109<br>
8<br><br>
receives light reflected from the mirror 88 and focuses it onto a peripheral zone of the second lens 110, which in turn focuses the collimated light into receiving apertures of the collection fibers 100, 102.<br>
      [0021]	Figure 3 shows the theoretical light distribution calculated<br>
based on Mie approximation for particles ranging from 0.5 to i.5 urn in diameter. Such particles are typical in natural gas pipelines and in the majority of llare stacks. The calculation was done for a monochromatic light, wavelength of 0.650m,m, which is typical for miniature lasers suitable<br>
         for L2F velocimetry. The relative intensities of the light scattered near 0 degrees (forward scattered light) and near 180 degrees (back scattered light) are Ff=512.9 and Fb=3.0, respectively. Therefore, optical collection systems which collect forward scattered light, such as those according to the invention, can be up to 170 times more efficient than optical collection<br>
          systems which collect back scattered light.<br>
[0022]	The difference in efficiency between collection of forward<br>
and back scattered light increases with the size of particles due to more directional light scattering. Figure 4 shows an angular distribution of the type shown in Figure 3 for light scattered by particles from 2 to 10 mm in diameter. The ratio between forward-scattered and back-scattered intensities is Ff/Fb=126251.0/152.5=827 for these larger particles.<br>
[0023]	This explains a major drawback of the first type of prior art<br>
           discussed above which provides detectivity reduced by the same<br>
proportion. Optical collection systems which collect back scattered light can effectively detect particles only if they are added to the flow (the back-scattered light flux Fb increases with particle diameter). However, particle seeding is generally not allowed in industrial flow measurements. <br>
9<br><br>
    [0024]      Likewise, the efficiency of the second type prior art is<br>
affected by the non-coaxial design of the optical systems. The acceptance angle of optical collection systems according to the second type of prior art is lower than that of the Figure 2 embodiment due to the angular disposition of the collection system from the direction of the beams".<br>
     [0025]      Figure 5 illustrates the shape of the light beams from the<br>
 illumination fibers 96 and 98 in the plane of light sheets 106 and 108 of          Figure 2. The elliptical spots 112 and 114 represent cross-sections of the<br>
  light sheets 106 and 108 in a plane perpendicular to optical axis The round spots 113 and 115 represent projections of the cores of the illumination fibers 96 and 98 in the same plane. The spots 112 and 114 are displaced at a di stance d which depends the spacing of fibers 96 and 9£ in the illumination ferrule 80 and magnification of the lenses 81 and 82. The<br>
  distance d is one of two parameters which are used for velocity<br>
   calculation: V=d/i, where ris the average time it takes for the particles to travel  between spots 112 and 114.<br>
[0026]       Figure 6 illustrates the shape of the light beams from the<br>
	illumination fibers 96 and 98 in the plane of the obscuration 90 on mirror 88 of Figure 2. The spots 120 and 122 are typically expanded in a direction perpendicular to the orientation of spots 112 and 114 of Figure 5 due to the effect of the cylindrical lens 82.<br>
[0027]        Preferably, the illumination fibers 96 and 98 are single-mode<br>
optical fibers having core diameters ranging from 4 to 9 \im depending on the wavelength of light used. Such fibers allow the production of light sheets less than 15 u-m wide, thus achieving high light concentration in the measuring area. The fiber core can be selected taking into account that<br>
	scattering efficiency increases with shorter wavelength and the total amount of the light coupled into the fiber is lower in thinner fibers.<br>
10<br><br>
Preferably, the collection fibers 100 and 102 are multi-mode optical fibers having core diameters ranging from 50 to 500 urn and high numerical apertures. Although generally thicker collection fibers are preferable, the optimum diameter of the collection fibers 100 and 102 depends on the    magnification of the collection optical system (the mirror $8 and the focusing assembly 86) and the distance d.<br>
  [0028]       The preferable value for the distance d depends on a number<br>
   of factors, from which the desired accuracy, the range of velocities to be<br>
   measured and the turbulence level are dominant. Larger values of d result in higher accuracy in the measurement of the time between two pulses caused by a particle crossing the spots 112 and 114. However, the probability that a single particle will cross both the spots 112 and 114 decreases as d increases, due to the effects of turbulence. A sheet spacing   d of approximately 1.0 mm is well suited for most industrial flow  applications with velocities ranging from 0.1 to 100 m/s and turbulence level of    less than 5%.<br>
[0029]       The optical system shown in Figure 2 has a high efficiency as<br>
it collects forward-scattered light. The portion of the scattered light which is absorbed by the obscuration 90 depends on the size of the obscuration 9( and the distance between location of the sheets 106 and 108 and the mirror 88. In an example embodiment, these dimensions define a typical obscuration angle of 3 degrees and a collecting angle of 12 degrees for a probe diameter of 3/4" (19.1mm). Prior art systems of the type disclosed in Hofmannet al. having roughly the same geometry will collect scattered light from about 168 to 177 degrees. The relative collection efficiency (Eff) of this example embodiment versus prior art systems of the type of Hofmann et al. may be calculated by integrating the light distribution shown in Figures 3 and 4 within solid angles from 3 to 12 degrees and from 168 to 177 degrees to get the intensities of the collected light {F3-12<br>
11<br><br>
and Fl68-177, respectively) and taking the ratio of the light intensities: Eff=          The collection efficiency increase as compared to the prior art can be found as 5.4x106 and 1.3x106 for small and large particles, respectively, for this example embodiment. <br><br>
[0030]        According to another embodiment of the invention, a<br>
reference optical fiber 130 is placed in the obscuration 90 as shown in Figure 7. The reference optical fiber 130 collects the portion of light which reaches the obscuration 90. This allows for control of the overall light intensity, which may vary over time due to the window fouling, degradation and thermal instability of the light sources, etc.<br>
[0031]         According to another embodiment of the invention, the<br>
proximal end of the probe may have a number of open areas for<br>
measurement of fluid velocity at different points in the flow.  Figure 8 shows three open areas 140,142 and 144. Each of open areas 140,142 and 144 is associated with coaxial optical illumination and collection systems as shown in Figure 2 or in Figure 7. This arrangement provides velocity measurement in multiple points which is desirable in many<br>
applications such as gas flow measurement in large stacks and pipes.<br>
[0032]         Velocity profile measurement can be achieved by moving the<br>
measuring zone across the fluid flow as illustrated in Figure 9. The insertion probe 60 is inserted into a large pipe 152 by an insertion device<br>
154. The insertion device 154 places the probe 60 at a certain depth in the pipe 152, thus the open area 70 with the measuring zone can meagre the velocity at different locations. The insertion device is connected to the electro-optical assembly 68 for the final calculation of velocity as a function of the probe location.<br><br>

Abstract: -<br>
An L2F velocimeter comprises a probe for insertion into a fluid, the probe having an open area therein to allow the fluid to pass through. The probe comprises an illumination system to direct a pair light beams, separated by a distance, through the open area, and a collection system to collect forward scattered light scattered from particles in the fluid. The collection system has an optical axis in common with the illumination system. The velocimeter further comprises an electro optical assembly connected to the probe to provide light to the illumination system, to receive light collected from the light collection system, to measure a lapse time in fluctuations of the forward scattered light created by particles passing through the pair of light beams and to calculate the velocity of the fluid based on the lapse time and the separation distance.<br></td>
