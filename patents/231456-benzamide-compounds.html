				<td>BENZAMIDE COMPOUNDS<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to novel compounds which are potent and highly<br>
selective inhibitors of isolated factor Xa or when assembled in the prothrombinase<br>
complex. These compounds show selectivity for factor Xa versus other proteases of<br>
the coagulation (e.g. thrombin, fVIIa, fIXa) or the fibrinolytic cascades (e.g.<br>
plasminogen activators, plasmin). In another aspect, the present invention relates to<br>
novel monoamidino-containing compounds, their pharmaceutically acceptable salts,<br>
and pharmaceutically acceptable compositions thereof which are useful as potent and<br>
specific inhibitors of blood coagulation in mammals. In yet another aspect, the<br>
invention relates to methods for using these inhibitors as therapeutic agents for disease<br>
states in mammals characterized by coagulation disorders.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Hemostasis, the control of bleeding, occurs by surgical means, or by the<br>
physiological properties of vasoconstriction and coagulation. This invention is<br>
particularly concerned with blood coagulation and ways in which it assists in<br>
maintaining the integrity of mammalian circulation after injury, inflammation,<br>
disease, congenital defect, dysfunction or other disruption. Although platelets and<br>
blood coagulation are both involved in thrombus formation, certain components of the<br>
coagulation cascade are primarily responsible for the amplification or acceleration of<br>
the processes involved in platelet aggregation and fibrin deposition.<br>
Thrombin is a key enzyme in the coagulation cascade as well as in hemostasis.<br>
Thrombin plays a central role in thrombosis through its ability to catalyze the<br>
conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin and through its potent platelet activation activity.<br>
Direct or indirect inhibition of thrombin activity has been the focus of a variety of<br>
recent anticoagulant strategies as reviewed by Claeson, G., "Synthetic Peptides and<br>
Peptidomimetics as Substrates and Inhibitors of Thrombin and Other Proteases in the<br><br>
Blood Coagulation System", Blood Coag. Fibrinol. 5, 411-436 (1994). Several<br>
classes of anticoagulants currently used in the clinic directly or indirectly affect<br>
thrombin (i.e. heparins, low-molecular weight heparins, heparin-like compounds and<br>
coumarins).<br>
A prothrombinase complex, including Factor Xa (a serine protease, the<br>
activated form of its Factor X precursor and a member of the calcium ion binding,<br>
gamma carboxyglutamyl (Gla)-containing, vitamin K dependent, blood coagulation<br>
glycoprotein family), converts the zymogen prothrombin into the active procoagulant<br>
thrombin. Unlike thrombin, which acts on a variety of protein substrates as well as at<br>
a specific receptor, factor Xa appears to have a single physiologic substrate, namely<br>
prothrombin. Since one molecule of factor Xa may be able to generate up to 138<br>
molecules of thrombin (Elodi et al., Thromb. Res. 15, 617-619 (1979)), direct<br>
inhibition of factor Xa as a way of indirectly inhibiting the formation of thrombin may<br>
be an efficient anticoagulant strategy. Therefore, it has been suggested that<br>
compounds which selectively inhibit factor Xa may be useful as in vitro diagnostic<br>
agents, or for therapeutic administration in certain thrombotic disorders, see e.g., WO<br>
94/13693.<br>
Polypeptides derived from hematophagous organisms have been reported<br>
which are highly potent and specific inhibitors of factor Xa. United States Patent<br>
4,588,587 describes anticoagulant activity in the saliva of the Mexican leech,<br>
Haementeria officinalis. A principal component of this saliva was shown to be the<br>
polypeptide factor Xa inhibitor, antistasin (ATS), by Nutt, E. et al., "The Amino Acid<br>
Sequence of Antistasin, a Potent Inhibitor of Factor Xa Reveals a Repeated Internal<br>
Structure", J. Biol. Chem., 263, 10162-10167 (1988). Another potent and highly<br>
specific inhibitor of Factor Xa, called tick anticoagulant peptide (TAP), has been<br>
isolated from the whole body extract of the soft tick Ornithidoros moubata, as<br>
reported by Waxman, L., et al, "Tick Anticoagulant Peptide (TAP) is a Novel<br>
Inhibitor of Blood Coagulation Factor Xa" Science, 248, 593-596 (1990).<br>
Factor Xa inhibitory compounds which are not large polypeptide-type<br>
inhibitors have also been reported including: Tidwell, R.R. et al., "Strategies for<br>
Anticoagulation With Synthetic Protease Inhibitors. Xa Inhibitors Versus Thrombin<br>
Inhibitors", Thromb. Res., 12, 339-349 (1980); Turner, A.D. et al., "p-Amidino Esters<br>
as Irreversible Inhibitors of Factor IXa and Xa and Thrombin", Biochemistry, 25.,<br>
4929-4935 (1986); Hitomi, Y. et al., "Inhibitory Effect of New Synthetic Protease<br>
Inhibitor (FUT-175) on the Coagulation System", Haemostasis, 11, 164-168 (1985);<br><br>
Sturzebecher, J. et al., "Synthetic Inhibitors of Bovine Factor Xa and Thrombin.<br>
Comparison of Their Anticoagulant Efficiency", Thromb. Res., 54,245-252 (1989);<br>
Kam, CM. et al., "Mechanism Based Isocoumarin Inhibitors for Trypsin and Blood<br>
Coagulation Serine Proteases: New Anticoagulants", Biochemistry, 22, 2547-2557<br>
(1988); Hauptmann, J. et al., "Comparison of the Anticoagulant and Antithrombotic<br>
Effects of Synthetic Thrombin and Factor Xa Inhibitors", Thromb. Haemost., 63, 220-<br>
223 (1990); and the like.<br>
Others have reported Factor Xa inhibitors which are small molecule organic<br>
compounds, such as nitrogen containing heterocyclic compounds which have amidino<br>
substituent groups, wherein two functional groups of the compounds can bind to<br>
Factor Xa at two of its active sites. For example, WO 98/28269 describes pyrazole<br>
compounds having a terminal C(=NH)-NH2 group; WO 97/21437 describes<br>
benzimidazole compounds substituted by a basic radical which are connected to a<br>
naththyl group via a straight or branched chain alkylene,-C(=O) or -S(=O)2 bridging<br>
group; WO 99/10316 describes compounds having a 4-phenyl-N-alkylamidino-<br>
piperidine and 4-phenoxy-N-alkylamidino-piperidine group connected to a 3-<br>
amidinophenyl group via a carboxamidealkyleneamino bridge; and EP 798295<br>
describes compounds having a 4-phenoxy-N-alkylamidino-piperidine group<br>
connected to an amidinonaphthyl group via a substituted or unsubstituted sulfonamide<br>
or carboxamide bridging group.<br>
There exists a need for effective therapeutic agents for the regulation of<br>
hemostasis, and for the prevention and treatment of thrombus formation and other<br>
pathological processes in the vasculature induced by thrombin such as restenosis and<br>
inflammation. In particular, there continues to be a need for compounds which<br>
selectively inhibit factor Xa or its precursors. Compounds that have different<br>
combinations of bridging groups and functional groups than compounds previously<br>
discovered are needed, particularly compounds which selectively or preferentially<br>
bind to Factor Xa. Compounds with a higher degree of binding to Factor Xa than to<br>
thrombin are desired, especially those compounds having good bioavailability and/or<br>
solubility.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel compounds which inhibit factor Xa,<br>
their pharmaceutically acceptable isomers, salts, hydrates, solvates and prodrug<br>
derivatives, and pharmaceutically acceptable compositions thereof which have<br><br>
particular biological properties and are useful as potent and specific inhibitors of<br>
blood coagulation in mammals. In another aspect, the invention relates to methods of<br>
using these inhibitors as diagnostic reagents or as therapeutic agents for disease states<br>
in mammals characterized by undesired thrombosis or which have coagulation<br>
disorders, such as in the treatment or prevention of any thrombotically mediated acute<br>
coronary or cerebrovascular syndrome, any thrombotic syndrome occurring in the<br>
venous system, any coagulopathy, and any thrombotic complications associated with<br>
extracorporeal circulation or instrumentation, and for the inhibition of coagulation in<br>
biological samples.<br>
In certain embodiments, this invention relates to novel compounds which are<br>
potent and highly selective inhibitors of isolated factor Xa when assembled in the<br>
prothrombinase complex. These compounds show selectivity for factor Xa versus<br>
other proteases of the coagulation cascade (e.g. thrombin, etc.) or the fibrinolytic<br>
cascade, and are useful as diagnostic reagents as well as antithrombotic agents.<br>

Definitions<br>
In accordance with the present invention and as used herein, the following<br>
terms are defined with the following meanings, unless explicitly stated otherwise.<br>
The term "alkenyl" refers to a trivalent straight chain or branched chain<br>
unsaturated aliphatic radical. The term "alkinyl" (or "alkynyl") refers to a straight or<br>

bond. If no number of carbons is specified alkenyl and alkinyl each refer to radicals<br>
having from 2-12 carbon atoms.<br>
The term "alkyl" refers to saturated aliphatic groups including straight-chain,<br>
branched-chain haying the number of carbon atoms specified, or if<br><br>
no number is specified, having up to 12 carbon atoms. The term "cycloalkyl" as used<br>
herein refers to a mono-, bi-, or tricyclic aliphatic ring having 3 to 14 carbon atoms<br>
and preferably 3 to 7 carbon atoms.<br>
As used herein, the terms "carbocyclic ring structure " and " C3-l6 carbocyclic<br>
mono, bicyclic or tricyclic ring structure" or the like are each intended to mean stable<br>
ring structures having only carbon atoms as ring atoms wherein the ring structure is a<br>
substituted or unsubstituted member selected from the group consisting of: a stable<br>
monocyclic ring which is aromatic ring ("aryl") having six ring atoms; a stable<br>
monocyclic non-aromatic ring having from 3 to 7 ring atoms in the ring; a stable<br>
bicyclic ring structure having a total of from 7 to 12 ring atoms in the two rings<br>
wherein the bicyclic ring structure is selected from the group consisting of ring<br>
structures in which both of the rings are aromatic, ring structures in which one of the<br>
rings is aromatic and ring structures in which both of the rings are non-aromatic; and a<br>
stable tricyclic ring structure having a total of from 10 to 16 atoms in the three rings<br>
wherein the tricyclic ring structure is selected from the group consisting of: ring<br>
structures in which three of the rings are aromatic, ring structures in which two of the<br>
rings are aromatic and ring structures in which three of the rings are non-aromatic. In<br>
each case, the non-aromatic rings when present in the monocyclic, bicyclic or tricyclic<br>
ring structure may independently be saturated, partially saturated or fully saturated.<br>
Examples of such carbocyclic ring structures include, but are not limited to,<br>
cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, adamantyl, cyclooctyl,<br>

indicated otherwise the terms "heterocyclic ring" or "heterocyclic ring system"<br>
include aromatic rings, as well as non-aromatic rings which can be saturated, partially<br>
saturated or fully saturated non-aromatic rings. Also, unless indicated otherwise the<br>
term "heterocyclic ring system" includes ring structures wherein all of the rings<br>
contain at least one hetero atom as well as structures having less than all of the rings<br>
in the ring structure containing at least one hetero atom, for example bicyclic ring<br>

hetero atoms are included within the term "heterocyclic ring systems" as well as<br>
bicyclic ring structures wherein each of the two rings has at least one hetero atom.<br>
Moreover, the ring structures described herein may be attached to one or more<br>
indicated pendant groups via any hetero atom or carbon atom which results in a stable<br>
structure. Further, the term "substituted" means that one or more of the hydrogen<br><br>
atoms on the ring carbon atom(s) or nitrogen atom(s) of the each of the rings in the<br>
ring structures described herein may be replaced by one or more of the indicated<br>
substituents if such replacement(s) would result in a stable compound. Nitrogen<br>
atoms in a ring structure may be quaternized, but such compounds are specifically<br>
indicated or are included within the term "a pharmaceutically acceptable salt" for a<br>
particular compound. When the total number of O and S atoms in a single<br>
heterocyclic ring is greater than 1, it is preferred that such atoms not be adjacent to<br>
one another. Preferably, there are no more that 1 O or S ring atoms in the same ring<br>

substituents for A-Q taken collectively when the remainder of the compound structur<br>
has the one of the following two formulae:<br><br>
and all pharmaceutically acceptable isomers, salts, hydrates, solvates and<br>
prodrug derivatives thereof.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
This invention also encompasses all pharmaceutically acceptable isomers,<br>
salts, hydrates, solvates, and prodrug derivatives of the preferred compounds. In<br>
addition, the preferred compounds can exist in various isomeric and tautomeric forms,<br>
and all such forms are meant to be included in the invention, along with<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts, hydrates, solvates, and prodrug derivatives of such<br>
isomers and tautomers.<br>
The compounds of this invention may be isolated as the free acid or base or<br>
converted to salts of various inorganic and organic acids and bases. Such salts are<br>
within the scope of this invention. Non-toxic and physiologically compatible salts are<br>
particularly useful although other less desirable salts may have use in the processes of<br>
isolation and purification.<br>
A number of methods are useful for the preparation of the salts described<br>
above and are known to those skilled in the art. For example, the free acid or free<br>
base form of a compound of one of the formulas above can be reacted with one or<br>
more molar equivalents of the desired acid or base in a solvent or solvent mixture in<br>
which the salt is insoluble, or in a solvent like water after which the solvent is<br>
removed by evaporation, distillation or freeze drying. Alternatively, the free acid or<br>
base form of the product may be passed over an ion exchange resin to form the<br>
desired salt or one salt form of the product may be converted to another using the<br>
same general process.<br>
Prodrug Derivatives of Compounds<br>
This invention also encompasses prodrug derivatives of the compounds<br>
contained herein. The term "prodrug" refers to a pharmacologically inactive<br>
derivative of a parent drug molecule that requires biotransformation, either<br>
spontaneous or enzymatic, within the organism to release the active drug. Prodrugs<br>
are variations or derivatives of the compounds of this invention which have groups<br>
cleavable under metabolic conditions. Prodrugs become the compounds of the<br>
invention which are pharmaceutically active in vivo, when they undergo solvolysis<br>
under physiological conditions or undergo enzymatic degradation. Prodrug<br>
compounds of this invention may be called single, double, triple etc., depending on<br>
the number of biotransformation steps required to release the active drug within the<br>
organism, and indicating the number of functionalities present in a precursor-type<br><br>
form. Prodrug forms often offer advantages of solubility, tissue compatibility, or<br>
delayed release in the mammalian organism (see, Bundgard, Design of Prodrugs, pp.<br>
7-9, 21-24, Elsevier, Amsterdam 1985 and Silverman, The Organic Chemistry of<br>
Drug Design and Drug Action, pp. 352-401, Academic Press, San Diego, CA, 1992).<br>
Prodrugs commonly known in the art include acid derivatives well known to<br>
practitioners of the art, such as, for example, esters prepared by reaction of the parent<br>
acids with a suitable alcohol, or amides prepared by reaction of the parent acid<br>
compound with an amine, or basic groups reacted to form an acylated base derivative.<br>
Moreover, the prodrug derivatives of this invention may be combined with other<br>
features herein taught to enhance bioavailability.<br>
As mentioned above, the compounds of this invention find utility as<br>
therapeutic agents for disease states in mammals which have disorders of coagulation<br>
such as in the treatment or prevention of unstable angina, refractory angina,<br>
myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attacks, thrombotic stroke, embolic stroke,<br>
disseminated intravascular coagulation including the treatment of septic shock, deep<br>
venous thrombosis in the prevention of pulmonary embolism or the treatment of<br>
reocclusion or restenosis of reperfused coronary arteries. Further, these compounds<br>
are useful for the treatment or prophylaxis of those diseases which involve the<br>
production and/or action of factor Xa/prothrombinase complex. This includes a<br>
number of thrombotic and prothrombotic states in which the coagulation cascade is<br>
activated which include but are not limited to, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary<br>
embolism, myocardial infarction, stroke, thromboembolic complications of surgery<br>
and peripheral arterial occlusion.<br>
Accordingly, a method for preventing or treating a condition in a mammal<br>
characterized by undesired thrombosis comprises administering to the mammal a<br>
therapeutically effective amount of a compound of this invention. In addition to the<br>
disease states noted above, other diseases treatable or preventable by the<br>
administration of compounds of this invention include, without limitation, occlusive<br>
coronary thrombus formation resulting from either thrombolytic therapy or<br>
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, thrombus formation in the venous<br>
vasculature, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, a condition wherein there is<br>
rapid consumption of coagulation factors and systemic coagulation which results in<br>
the formation of life-threatening thrombi occurring throughout the microvasculature<br><br>
leading to widespread organ failure, hemorrhagic stroke, renal dialysis, blood<br>
oxygenation, and cardiac catheterization.<br>
The compounds of the invention also find utility in a method for inhibiting the<br>
coagulation biological samples, which comprises the administration of a compound of<br>
the invention.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may also be used in combination with<br>
other therapeutic or diagnostic agents. In certain preferred embodiments, the<br>
compounds of this invention may be coadministered along with other compounds<br>
typically prescribed for these conditions according to generally accepted medical<br>
practice such as anticoagulant agents, thrombolytic agents, or other antithrombotics,<br>
including platelet aggregation inhibitors, tissue plasminogen activators, urokinase,<br>
prourokinase, streptokinase, heparin, aspirin, or warfarin. The compounds of the<br>
present invention may act in a synergistic fashion to prevent reocclusion following a<br>
successful thrombolytic therapy and/or reduce the time to reperfusion. These<br>
compounds may also allow for reduced doses of the thrombolytic agents to be used<br>
and therefore minimize potential hemorrhagic side-effects. The compounds of this<br>
invention can be utilized in vivo, ordinarily in mammals such as primates, (e.g.<br>
humans), sheep, horses, cattle, pigs, dogs, cats, rats and mice, or in vitro.<br>
The biological properties of the compounds of the present invention can be<br>
readily characterized by methods that are well known in the art, for example by the in<br>
vitro protease activity assays and in vivo studies to evaluate antithrombotic efficacy,<br>
and effects on hemostasis and hematological parameters, such as are illustrated in the<br>
examples.<br>
Diagnostic applications of the compounds of this invention will typically<br>
utilize formulations in the form of solutions or suspensions. In the management of<br>
thrombotic disorders the compounds of this invention may be utilized in compositions<br>
such as tablets, capsules or elixirs for oral administration, suppositories, sterile<br>
solutions or suspensions or injectable administration, and the like, or incorporated intc<br>
shaped articles. Subjects in need of treatment (typically mammalian) using the<br>
compounds of this invention can be administered dosages that will provide optimal<br>
efficacy. The dose and method of administration will vary from subject to subject and<br><br>
be dependent upon such factors as the type of mammal being treated, its sex, weight,<br>
diet, concurrent medication, overall clinical condition, the particular compounds<br>
employed, the specific use for which these compounds are employed, and other<br>
factors which those skilled in the medical arts will recognize.<br>
Formulations of the compounds of this invention are prepared for storage or<br>
administration by mixing the compound having a desired degree of purity with<br>
physiologically acceptable carriers, excipients, stabilizers etc., and may be provided in<br>
sustained release or timed release formulations. Acceptable carriers or diluents for<br>
therapeutic use are well known in the pharmaceutical field, and are described, for<br>
example, in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Co., (A.R.<br>
Gennaro edit. 1985). Such materials are nontoxic to the recipients at the dosages and<br>
concentrations employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate, acetate and<br>
other organic acid salts, antioxidants such as ascorbic acid, low molecular weight (less<br>
than about ten residues) peptides such as polyarginine, proteins, such as serum<br>
albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins, hydrophilic polymers such as<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidinone, amino acids such as glycine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, or<br>
arginine, monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including cellulose<br>
or its derivatives, glucose, mannose or dextrins, chelating agents such as EDTA, sugar<br>
alcohols such as mannitol or sorbitol, counterions such as sodium and/or nonionic<br>
surfactants such as Tween, Pluronics or polyethyleneglycol.<br>
Dosage formulations of the compounds of this invention to be used for<br>
therapeutic administration must be sterile. Sterility is readily accomplished by<br>
filtration through sterile membranes such as 0.2 micron membranes, or by other<br>
conventional methods. Formulations typically will be stored in lyophilized form or as<br>
an aqueous solution. The pH of the preparations of this invention typically will be 3-<br>
11, more preferably 5-9 and most preferably 7-8. It will be understood that use of<br>
certain of the foregoing excipients, carriers, or stabilizers will result in the formation<br>
of cyclic polypeptide salts. While the preferred route of administration is by injection,<br>
other methods of administration are also anticipated such as orally, intravenously<br>
(bolus and/or infusion), subcutaneously, intramuscularly, colonically, rectally, nasally,<br>
transdermally or intraperitoneally, employing a variety of dosage forms such as<br>
suppositories, implanted pellets or small cylinders, aerosols, oral dosage formulations<br>
and topical formulations such as ointments, drops and dermal patches. The<br><br>
compounds of this invention are desirably incorporated into shaped articles such as<br>
implants which may employ inert materials such as biodegradable polymers or<br>
synthetic silicones, for example, Silastic, silicone rubber or other polymers<br>
commercially available.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be administered in the form of<br>
liposome delivery systems, such as small uni lamellar vesicles, large unilamellar<br>
vesicles and multilamellar vesicles. Liposomes can be formed from a variety of<br>
lipids, such as cholesterol, stearylamine or phosphatidylcholines.<br>
The compounds of this invention may also be delivered by the use of<br>
antibodies, antibody fragments, growth factors, hormones, or other targeting moieties,<br>
to which the compound molecules are coupled. The compounds of this invention may<br>
also be coupled with suitable polymers as targetable drug carriers. Such polymers can<br>
include polyvinylpyrrolidinone, pyran copolymer, polyhydroxy-propyl-<br>
methacrylamide-phenol, polyhydroxyethyl-aspartamide-phenol, or polyethyleneoxide-<br>
polylysine substituted with palmitoyl residues. Furthermore, compounds of the<br>
invention may be coupled to a class of biodegradable polymers useful in achieving<br>
controlled release of a drug, for example polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid,<br>
copolymers of polylactic and polyglycolic acid, polyepsilon caprolactone,<br>
polyhydroxy butyric acid, polyorthoesters, polyacetals, polydihydropyrans,<br>
polycyanoacrylates and cross linked or amphipathic block copolymers of hydrogels.<br>
Polymers and semipermeable polymer matrices may be formed into shaped articles,<br>
such as valves, stents, tubing, prostheses and the like.<br>
Therapeutic compound liquid formulations generally are placed into a<br>
container having a sterile access port, for example, an intravenous solution bag or vial<br>
having a stopper pierceable by hypodermic injection needle.<br>
Therapeutically effective dosages may be determined by either in vitro or in<br>
vivo methods. For each particular compound of the present invention, individual<br>
determinations may be made to determine the optimal dosage required. The range of<br>
therapeutically effective dosages will be influenced by the route of administration, the<br>
therapeutic objectives and the condition of the patient. For injection by hypodermic<br>
needle, it may be assumed the dosage is delivered into the body's fluids. For other<br><br>
routes of administration, the absorption efficiency must be individually determined for<br>
each compound by methods well known in pharmacology. Accordingly, it may be<br>
necessary for the therapist to titer the dosage and modify the route of administration as<br>
required to obtain the optimal therapeutic effect. The determination of effective<br>
dosage levels, that is, the dosage levels necessary to achieve the desired result, will be<br>
readily determined by one skilled in the art. Typically, applications of compound are<br>
commenced at lower dosage levels, with dosage levels being increased until the<br>
desired effect is achieved.<br>
The compounds of the invention can be administered orally or parenterally in<br>
an effective amount within the dosage range of about 0.1 to 100 mg/kg, preferably<br>
about 0.5 to 50 mg/kg and more preferably about 1 to 20 mg/kg on a regimen in a<br>
single or 2 to 4 divided daily doses and/or continuous infusion.<br>
Typically, about 5 to 500 mg of a compound or mixture of compounds of this<br>
invention, as the free acid or base form or as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, is<br>
compounded with a physiologically acceptable vehicle, carrier, excipient, binder,<br>
preservative, stabilizer, dye, flavor etc., as called for by accepted pharmaceutical<br>
practice. The amount of active ingredient in these compositions is such that a suitable<br>
dosage in the range indicated is obtained.<br>
Typical adjuvants which may be incorporated into tablets, capsules and the<br>
like are binders such as acacia, com starch or gelatin, and excipients such as<br>
microcrystalline cellulose, disintegrating agents like com starch or alginic acid,<br>
lubricants such as magnesium stearate, sweetening agents such as sucrose or lactose,<br>
or flavoring agents. When a dosage form is a capsule, in addition to the above<br>
materials it may also contain liquid carriers such as water, saline, or a fatty oil. Other<br>
materials of various types may be used as coatings or as modifiers of the physical<br>
form of the dosage unit. Sterile compositions for injection can be formulated<br>
according to conventional pharmaceutical practice. For example, dissolution or<br>
suspension of the active compound in a vehicle such as an oil or a synthetic fatty<br>
vehicle like ethyl oleate, or into a liposome may be desired. Buffers, preservatives,<br>
antioxidants and the like can be incorporated according to accepted pharmaceutical<br>
practice.<br><br>
Preparation of Compounds<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be synthesized by either solid or<br>
liquid phase methods described and referenced in standard textbooks, or by a<br>
combination of both methods. These methods are well known in the art. See,<br>
Bodanszky, "The Principles of Peptide Synthesis", Hafner, et at., Eds., Springer-<br>
Verlag, Berlin, 1984.<br>
Starting materials used in any of these methods are commercially available<br>
from chemical vendors such as Aldrich, Sigma, Nova Biochemicals, Bachem<br>
Biosciences, and the like, or may be readily synthesized by known procedures.<br>
Reactions are carried out in standard laboratory glassware and reaction vessels<br>
under reaction conditions of standard temperature and pressure, except where<br>
otherwise indicated.<br>
During the synthesis of these compounds, the functional groups of the amino<br>
acid derivatives used in these methods are protected by blocking groups to prevent<br>
cross reaction during the coupling procedure. Examples of suitable blocking groups<br>
and their use are described in "The Peptides: Analysis, Synthesis, Biology", Academic<br>
Press, Vol. 3 (Gross, et al., Eds., 1981) and Vol. 9 (1987), the disclosures of which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Compounds according to the invention can be synthesized utilizing procedures<br>
well known in the art. The reaction products are isolated and purified by conventional<br>
methods, typically by solvent extraction into a compatible solvent. The products may<br>
be further purified by column chromatography or other appropriate methods.<br>
Compositions and Formulations<br>
The compounds of this invention may be isolated as the free acid or base or<br>
converted to salts of various inorganic and organic acids and bases. Such salts are<br>
within the scope of this invention. Non-toxic and physiologically compatible salts are<br>
particularly useful although other less desirable salts may have use in the processes of<br>
isolation and purification.<br><br>
A number of methods are useful for the preparation of the salts described<br>
above and are known to those skilled in the art. For example, reaction of the free acid<br>
or free base form of a compound of the structures recited above with one or more<br>
molar equivalents of the desired acid or base in a solvent or solvent mixture in which<br>
the salt is insoluble, or in a solvent like water after which the solvent is removed by<br>
evaporation, distillation or freeze drying. Alternatively, the free acid or base form of<br>
the product may be passed over an ion exchange resin to form the desired salt or one<br>
salt form of the product may be converted to another using the same general process.<br><br>
A typical dosage might range from about 0.001 mg/kg to about 1000 mg/kg,<br>
preferably from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg, and more preferably from<br>
about 0.10 mg/kg to about 20 mg/kg. Advantageously, the compounds of this<br>
invention may be administered several times daily, and other dosage regimens may<br>
also be useful.<br><br>
In practicing the methods of this invention, the compounds of this invention<br>
may be used alone or in combination, or in combination with other therapeutic or<br>
diagnostic agents. In certain preferred embodiments, the compounds of this<br>
inventions may be coadministered along with other compounds typically prescribed<br>
for these conditions according to generally accepted medical practice, such as<br>
anticoagulant agents, thrombolytic agents, or other antithrombotics, including platelet<br>
aggregation inhibitors, tissue plasminogen activators, urokinase, prourokinase,<br>
streptokinase, heparin, aspirin, or warfarin. The compounds of this invention can be<br>
utilized in vivo, ordinarily in mammals such as primates, such as humans, sheep,<br>
horses, cattle, pigs, dogs, cats, rats and mice, or in vitro.<br><br>
The preferred compounds of the present invention are characterized by their<br>
ability to inhibit thrombus formation with acceptable effects on classical measures of<br>
coagulation parameters, platelets and platelet function, and acceptable levels of<br>
bleeding complications associated with their use. Conditions characterized by<br>
undesired thrombosis would include those involving the arterial and venous<br>
vasculature.<br><br>
With respect to the coronary arterial vasculature, abnormal thrombus<br>
formation characterizes the rupture of an established atherosclerotic plaque which is<br>
the major cause of acute myocardial infarction and unstable angina, as well as also<br>
characterizing the occlusive coronary thrombus formation resulting from either<br>
thrombolytic therapy or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA).<br>
With respect to the venous vasculature, abnormal thrombus formation<br>
characterizes the condition observed in patients undergoing major surgery in the lower<br>
extremities or the abdominal area who often suffer from thrombus formation in the<br>
venous vasculature resulting in reduced blood flow to the affected extremity and a<br>
predisposition to pulmonary embolism. Abnormal thrombus formation further<br>
characterizes disseminated intravascular coagulopathy commonly occurs within both<br>
vascular systems during septic shock, certain viral infections and cancer, a condition<br>
wherein there is rapid consumption of coagulation factors and systemic coagulation<br>
which results in the formation of life-threatening thrombi occurring throughout the<br>
microvasculature leading to widespread organ failure.<br>
The compounds of this present invention, selected and used as disclosed<br>
herein, are believed to be useful for preventing or treating a condition characterized by<br>
undesired thrombosis, such as (a) the treatment or prevention of any thrombotically<br>
mediated acute coronary syndrome including myocardial infarction, unstable angina,<br>
refractory angina, occlusive coronary thrombus occurring post-thrombolytic therapy<br>
or post-coronary angioplasty, (b) the treatment or prevention of any thrombotically<br>
mediated cerebrovascular syndrome including embolic stroke, thrombotic stroke or<br>
transient ischemic attacks, (c) the treatment or prevention of any thrombotic syndrome<br>
occurring in the venous system including deep venous thrombosis jr pulmonary<br>
embolus occurring either spontaneously or in the setting of malignancy, surgery or<br>
trauma, (d) the treatment or prevention of any coagulopathy including disseminated<br>
intravascular coagulation (including the setting of septic shock or other infection,<br>
surgery, pregnancy, trauma or malignancy and whether associated with multi-organ<br>
failure or not), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, thromboangiitis obliterans, or<br>
thrombotic disease associated with heparin induced thrombocytopenia, (e) the<br>
treatment or prevention of thrombotic complications associated with extracorporeal<br>
circulation (e.g. renal dialysis, cardiopulmonary bypass or other oxygenation<br><br>
procedure, plasmapheresis), (f) the treatment or prevention of thrombotic<br>
complications associated with instrumentation (e.g. cardiac or other intravascular<br>
catheterization, intra-aortic balloon pump, coronary stent or cardiac valve), and (g)<br>
those involved with the fitting of prosthetic devices.<br>
Anticoagulant therapy is also useful to prevent coagulation of stored whole<br>
blood and to prevent coagulation in other biological samples for testing or storage.<br>
Thus the compounds of this invention can be added to or contacted with any medium<br>
containing or suspected to contain factor Xa and in which it is desired that blood<br>
coagulation be inhibited, e.g., when contacting the mammal's blood with material<br>
such as vascular grafts, stents, orthopedic prostheses, cardiac stents, valves and<br>
prostheses, extra corporeal circulation systems and the like.<br>
Without further description, it is believed that one of ordinary skill in the art<br>
can, using the preceding description and the following illustrative examples, make and<br>
utilize the compounds of the present invention and practice the claimed methods.<br>
