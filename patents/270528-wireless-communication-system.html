TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Wireless communication system<br>
APPLICANTS<br>
IPICO INNOVATION INC, 6-14845 Yonge Street, Box 105, Aurora, Ontario, Canada, a Canadian Company<br>
INVENTOR<br>
Name : Van Eeden Hendrik Lodewyk<br>
Address : 607 Sean Street, Moreletapark, 0181 Pretoria, Republic of South<br>
Africa<br>
Nationality : A South African national<br>
PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :<br><br><br>
THIS INVENTION relates to a wireless communication system, and in particular it relates to RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) tags.<br>
The Inventor is aware of RF (Radio Frequency) communication systems which include at least one reader, otherwise known as an interrogator, and a plurality of RFID tags, otherwise known as transponders. The RFID tags are typically passive, being energised by a broadcast signal from the reader, but can also be active, having an internal power source like a battery. The RFID tags typically communicate with the reader by reflecting a varying amount of energy back to the reader.<br>
The communication between readers and RFID tags is regulated by various protocols. There are various different UHF air protocols in use in the world today, for example iP-X, ISO-18000-6A and B, and EPC C1G2 and its Class 1 and Class 0 predecessors. Of these, EPC C1G2 is the most well-known and most widely used,, especially in the USA. While tags always execute just one of the available protocols, reader manufacturers produce multi-protocol readers that can handle more than one kind of tag.<br>
The EPC C1G2 protocol is a "Reader Talks First" (RTF) protocol, i.e. tags do not respond until commanded to do so by the reader using some form of wake up command. In the case of EPC C1G2, the SELECT or QUERY commands are used for this purpose. In order to identify moving tags, the reader can poll for tags by repeatedly issuing 'wake-up' commands, or the reader can trigger the tags by some other means, for example manually, by infra-red beams, or by trip switches. Once<br>
2<br><br>
communication has been initiated by the reader, a tag population is singled using a complex set of commands and replies between reader and tags.<br>
The iP-X protocol, on the other hand, is a "Tag Talks First" (TTF) or "Tag Talks Only" (TTO) protocol, i.e. tags announce themselves when they enter a reader beam by transmitting an ID to the reader. This ID transmission typically takes place repeatedly at pseudo-random intervals using a low duty cycle. The transmission of the ID can be followed by transmission of additional data. No additional means to trigger the reader is required.<br>
Although the EPC protocol is widely touted for supply chain and logistics applications, its main drawback is that complex reader to tag interaction requires a wide spectrum band in order to achieve high read rates. In addition, readers cannot share a communication channel with other readers in close proximity. While a wide enough spectrum allocation exists currently in the USA, this is not the case in all countries, notably Europe and China. EPC C1G2 has therefore not found wide application in Europe, China and other countries with limited spectrum allocations. Due to its RTF nature, the EPC C1G2 protocol is also not suitable for applications involving fast moving tags, or applications where tags can enter and leave a reader beam at indeterminate times.<br>
The iP-X protocol requires very little bandwidth. In the case of the TTO version of the protocol, readers never modulate, or transmit commands, thus requiring very little spectrum. Readers can share the same communication channel, allowing for the operation of large numbers of readers in close proximity.  The TTF<br>
3<br><br>
nature of the protocol also makes it suitable for the detection of fast moving tags or applications where tags can enter and leave a reader beam at indeterminate times.<br>
Due to the above-mentioned distinct advantages of the iP-X protocol over RTF protocols, it is likely to find acceptance over EPC C1G2 in regions such as Europe and China.<br>
According to one aspect of the invention, there is provided an electronic tag which is operable in both an RTF protocol mode and a TTF or TTO protocol mode.<br>
The electronic tag may be an RFID tag and may further include: a.receiver for receiving a signal; and a transmitter for transmitting a signal.<br>
The electronic tag may include an RTF protocol engine and a TTF or TTO protocol engine, respectively to operate the tag in RTF protocol mode and in TTF or TTO protocol mode.<br>
The electronic tag may further include a switch operable to switch the tag between an RTF protocol mode and a TTF or TTO protocol mode.<br>
The switch may be manually operable. In such a case, the switch may be operable to be manually toggled by an operator to change the mode of operation of the tag typically when the tag is moved to and from zones which have different<br>
4<br><br>
protocols operating therein.   The switch may include a manually operable toggle switch or a status flag writable by a reader or interrogator.<br>
Instead, or preferably in addition, the switch may automatically switch the tag between protocols. In such a case, the tag may include a detector to detect automatically whether the reader is broadcasting in an RTF protocol mode or a TTF or TTO protocol mode, the switch being operable to switch the tag automatically to the detected mode. The tag may include an RTF protocol preamble detector and a TTF or TTO protocol header detector, respectively to detect whether the reader is broadcasting in an RTF protocol or a TTF or TTO protocol.<br>
The electronic tag may be based on iP-X tag architecture. The tag may therefore include a memory component, for example in the form of an EEPROM (Electronically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory). The memory component may include thereon a set of electronically readable instructions which are operable to detect whether the received signal uses an RTF protocol or a TTF or TTO protocol, and in response thereto to switch between protocol modes accordingly, the switch and the detector thus being software-based.<br>
Instead, or in addition, the memory component may be operable to receive a command directing the tag to operate in either an RTF protocol mode or a TTF or TTO protocol mode.<br>
The electronic tag may include dedicated circuitry, for example in the form of a logic circuit, operable to detect which protocol the received signal is using<br>
5<br><br>
and in response thereto to switch the operation of the electronic tag between protocol modes, the switch and the detector thus being hardware-based.<br>
The electronic tag may be operable in at least one frequency range of LF, HF, UHF, or microwave frequency, and preferably in all these frequency ranges.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of operating an electronic tag, the method including selectively setting the tag to use either an RTF protocol mode or a TTF or TTO protocol mode.<br>
Thus, the method may include selectively switching the RFID tag between the RTF protocol mode and the TTF or TTO protocol mode.<br>
The RFID tag may be switched automatically between protocols. The method may therefore include detecting by means of the tag whether a reader is operating in an RTF protocol mode or in a TTF or TTO protocol mode, and automatically switching the RFID tag to that mode.<br>
Instead, or preferably in addition, the method may include manually switching the tag between protocol modes.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a set of electronically readable instructions as above defined. The invention extends to a memory component having stored thereon a set of electronically readable instructions as above defined.<br>
6<br><br>
The invention extends to an article having attached thereto an electronic tag as above defined.<br>
The invention extends further to a communication system which includes at least one electronic tag as above defined.<br>
The invention will now be further described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying diagrammatic drawings.<br>
In the drawings:<br>
Figure 1 shows a schematic view of an RFID tag, in accordance with the invention;<br>
Figure 2 shows a schematic view of a system using the RFID tag of Figure 1; and<br>
Figures 3 to 5 each show a schematic signal.<br>
Referring to Figures 1 and 2 of the drawings, reference numeral 10 generally indicates an electronic tag, particularly an RFID tag, in accordance with the invention. As shown in Figure 1, the RFID tag 10 includes an antenna 11 and a rectifier and detector 12, in conventional fashion. The RFID tag 10 further includes detectors in the form of an RTF protocol detector, specifically an EPC preamble detector 13, and a TTF or TTO protocol detector, specifically an iP-X header detector 14. The RFID tag 10 further includes a persistent status flag 15, respective EPC and iP-X protocol engines 16, 17, a memory component in the form of an EEPROM 18,<br>
7<br><br>
and a modulator 19. The EEPROM 18 has stored thereon a unique ID code associated with the RFID tag 10, and optionally additional data.<br>
It is to be appreciated that components 13 to 18 in Figure 1, although shown conceptually separately, may, depending on the embodiment, be integral with one another.<br>
Referring now also to Figure 2, in conventional fashion, a signal 24, 34 broadcast by a reader 22, 32 is received by the antenna 11, therefore acting as a receiver, and rectified by the rectifier and detector 12, to energise the RFID tag 10, the broadcast signal 24, 34 thereby acting as a power source.<br>
The rectifier and detector 12 also feeds data detected in the signal 24, 34 to the EPC preamble detector 13 and the iP-X header detector 14. Examples of formats of an EPC preamble and an iP-X header are shown in Figures 3 and 4 respectively.<br>
When an EPC preamble (Figure 3) is detected by the EPC preamble detector 13, the EPC preamble detector 13 enables the EPC protocol engine 16, and if necessary, the EEPROM 18 is accessed and a signal 36 is modulated by the modulator 19 and transmitted back via the antenna 11. The antenna 11 therefore acts as a transmitter.<br>
Similarly, when an iP-X header (Figure 4) is detected by the iP-X header detector 14, the iP-X header detector 14 enables the iP-X protocol engine 17,<br>
8<br><br>
and if necessary, the EEPROM 18 is accessed and a signal 26 is modulated by the modulator 19 and transmitted back via the antenna 11.<br>
In use, the RFID tag 10 is in a first zone, indicated by reference numeral 20, which includes a reader 22 operating in iP-X protocol mode (iP-X protocol being an example of a TTF or TTO protocol). iP-X protocol is widely used in China, and zone 20 could therefore be an area in China. Reader 22 broadcasts a signal 24 in iP-X protocol. The signal 24 is received via the antenna 11, the iP-X header detector 14 detects the use of iP-X protocol and enables the iP-X protocol engine 17.<br>
The RFID tag 10 sets the persistent status flag 15 to iP-X protocol mode. The persistent status flag 15 is a short term memory component having a memory life of five seconds or less. Because the signal 24 powers the RFID tag 10, if the RFID tag 10 moves out of a path of the signal 24, the RFID tag 10 loses its power source. However, if the RFID tag 10 moves out of the path of the signal 24 for a short time (i.e. less than five seconds), the persistent status flag 15 retains its memory, and when the RFID tag 10 moves back into the path of the signal 24 and is re-powered, the persistent status flag 15 is read, and the RFID tag 10 resumes communication in iP-X protocol mode.<br>
The RFID tag 10 is then moved, as represented by arrow 28, to a second zone 30. The second zone 30 includes a reader 32 operating in EPC protocol mode (EPC protocol being an example of an RTF protocol)- EPC protocol is widely used in the USA, and zone 30 could therefore be an area in the USA.   A practical<br>
9<br><br>
example of the move 28 would be shipping of an article containing the RFID tag 10 from China to the USA.<br>
The reader 32 in zone 30 transmits a signal 34 to the RFID tag 10. The signal 34 is received via the antenna 11 and the EPC preamble detector 13 detects that the received signal 26 is in EPC protocol, and enables the EPC protocol engine 16. Similarly, the persistent status flag 15 is set to EPC protocol mode.<br>
Alternatively, as the RFID tag 10 left zone 20, the reader 22 could have transmitted an instruction, for example a WRITE instruction, to the RFID tag 10 to set a default status flag, as stored in the EEPROM 18, to EPC protocol mode, thereby manually switching the RFID tag 10 to EPC protocol mode. The EEPROM 18 is a long term memory component, therefore retaining the default status flag even when the RFID tag 10 is un-powered for extended periods of time. When the RFID tag 10 is manufactured, the default status flag is preferably set to a protocol in which the RFID tag 10 is likely to be first used. The default status flag dictates in which protocol mode the RFID tag 10 is to operate if a particular protocol mode cannot be detected or if the RFID tag 10 is configured not to detect automatically the protocol mode of a received signal 24, 34.<br>
A typically transmit sequence of the RFID tag 10 is shown in Figure 5, the sequence including a boot portion 100, an iP-X portion 102, and an EPC portion 104. Upon entering the transmitted signal 24 of the reader 22, the RFID tag 10 powers-up and reads a state of the persistent status flag 15, for example, iP-X protocol mode, and the iP-X protocol engine 17 executes in iP-X protocol sequence 106.<br>
10<br><br>
When the RFID tag 10 moves into zone 30, the RFID tag receives an EPC Query command 108 from the reader 32. The RFID tag 10 activates the EPC protocol engine 16 upon detection of the EPC Query command 108, interprets a QueryRep command 110 which follows EPC Query command 108 and replies with an RN16 command 111 at the appropriate time. When receiving an Ack command 114 from the reader 32, the RFID tag 10 replies with its EPC code 116.<br>
The Inventor believes that the invention as illustrated provides an RFID tag which effectively communicates using different protocols, which is especially useful for RFID tags which are to be shipped or otherwise transported between areas using different protocols, for example China and the USA.<br>
