				<td>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[001] Pursuant to 35 U.S.C. ยง 119(a), this application claims the benefit of earlier filing<br>
date and right of priority to Korean Application No. 10-2004-68280, filed on August<br>
28, 2004, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein in its<br>
entirety.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[002] The present invention relates to a dial-up networking connection via a terminal, and<br>
particularly, to an authentication system and method thereof for a dial-up networking<br>
connection via a terminal.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[003] Figure 1 illustrates an authentication processing procedure for a dial-up networking<br>
connection via a terminal in accordance with the conventional art.<br>
[004] Conventionally, to use a dial-up networking connection service, an authentication<br>
module in computer 1 transmits an authentication request packet<br>
(PAP_Authenticate_Request) to a mobile communications terminal 2, which then<br>
retransmits the authentication request packet to an authentication authorization<br>
accounting (AAA) server on the network 3. The AAA server responds to the<br>
authentication request packet by transmitting an acknowledge packet<br>
(PAP_Authentication_ACK) back to the mobile communications terminal 2, which in<br>
turn forwards the acknowledge packet to the computer 1. After receiving the<br><br>
acknowledge packet, the computer 1 executes IP Control Protocol (IPCP) negotiation,<br>
and thereby begins communication with the network 3.<br>
[005] The mobile communications terminal 2 performs no processing regarding the<br>
authentication request packet other than to forward the request to the AAA server.<br>
Also, the mobile communications terminal 2 performs no processing on the<br>
acknowledge packet other than to forward the acknowledge packet to the computer 1.<br>
[006] However, the conventional authentication method for the dial-up networking<br>
connection via the terminal has the following problem. After requesting<br>
authentication from the AAA server via the terminal 2, the computer 1 must receive<br>
an acknowledge packet from the AAA server responsive to an authentication request<br>
packet before performing the next step. Thus, the computer 1 does not perform any<br>
operation from the time an authentication request is sent until an authentication<br>
acknowledgement is received. This time includes the Round Trip Time (RTT) over<br>
the unassured mode (UM) interface for the request and acknowledgement. Here, the<br>
RTT refers to the time period beginning from when authentication information (e.g.,<br>
authentication ID, authentication password, etc. for an authentication request of a<br>
computer) is transmitted to the network up to the time when a response packet with<br>
respect to the authentication request is received. A need therefore exists for a system<br>
and a method to reduce the total time required to authenticate a dial-up networking<br>
connection via a terminal.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[007] Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide an authentication system<br>
and method thereof for a dial-up networking connection via a terminal, whereby, the<br>
RRT duration over the UM interface is replaced with the RTT duration over the RM<br>
interface, such that the authentication time duration when the computer uses the dial-<br>
up network service can be reduced.<br>
[008] To achieve this and other advantages and in accordance with the purpose of the<br>
present invention, as embodied and broadly described herein, an authentication<br>
system and method for a dial-up networking connection via a communications<br>
terminal is provided comprising: a computer requesting authentication by transmitting<br><br>
an authentication request packet including an authentication ID and authentication<br>
password; a terminal monitoring and storing (hereinafter referred to as snooping) the<br>
transmitted authentication request packet, forwarding the authentication request<br>
packet, and generating an acknowledge packet responsive to the authentication<br>
request packet; and a network generating a response packet with respect to the<br>
forwarded authentication request packet.<br>
The foregoing and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present<br>
invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the<br>
present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an authentication system for a dial-<br>
up networking connection via a terminal, said system comprising a computer for<br>
providing an authentication request, wherein the authentication request<br>
comprises an authentication ID and a password, and for communication with a<br>
network, a terminal for receiving the authentication request, wherein the terminal<br>
generates a first acknowledgement responsive to the authentication request,<br>
wherein the terminal transits the first acknowledgement to the computer, and<br>
wherein the terminal retransmits the authentication request.<br>
The present invention also provides a terminal for authenticating a dial-up<br>
connection between a computer and a network wherein the computer provides<br>
an authentication request comprising an authentication ID and a password,<br>
wherein the terminal compares the authentication ID and a password with a list<br>
of previously stored authentication IDs and passwords; and wherein the terminal<br>
generates a first acknowledgement responsive to the authentication request<br>
when the authentication ID and the password are contained in the list of<br>
previously stored authentication IDs and passwords.<br><br>
The present invention further provides an authentication method for a dial-up<br>
networking connection via a terminal, said method comprising receiving by a<br>
terminal, an authentication request comprising an authentication ID and<br>
password from a computer that requests the authentication, generating by the<br>
terminal, a first acknowledgement responsive to the received authentication<br>
request, and transmitting by the terminal, the generated first acknowledgement<br>
to the computer.<br>
The present invention still further provides a terminal authentication method for a<br>
dial-up networking connection via a terminal, said method comprising the steps<br>
of receiving an authentication request comprising an authentication ID and<br>
password from a computer that requests the authentication, determining whether<br>
the authentication ID and password of the received authentication request exist<br>
in a list of previously authenticated IDs and passwords in a nonvolatile memory,<br>
generating a first acknowledgement with respect to the authentication request<br>
when the authentication ID and password of the received authentication request<br>
already exist in a list of previously authenticated IDs and passwords, and storing<br>
the authentication ID and password of the received authentication request<br>
packet in a nonvolatile memory when the authentication ID and the password are<br>
not contained in the list of previously stored authentication IDs and passwords,<br>
transmitting the generated first acknowledgement to the computer, forwarding<br>
the authentication request packet to a network, and receiving a second<br>
acknowledgement generated by the network, discarding the second<br>
acknowledgement when the received second acknowledgement is positive, and<br>
terminating a call request of the computer when the second acknowledgement is<br>
negative notifying the computer that the second acknowledgement is negative.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0014] Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
[0015] One embodiment of an authentication system and method thereof for a dial-up<br>
networking connection via a terminal will now be described in detail with reference to<br>
Figures 2 and 3, whereby the RTT duration over the UM interface is replaced with the<br>
RTT duration over the RM interface in an authentication processing procedure used<br>
by a computer for a dial-up networking connection service, such that the<br><br>
authentication time duration when the computer uses a dial-up networking connection<br>
service is reduced.<br>
[0016] Figure 2 illustrates an authentication processing procedure for a dial-up networking<br>
connection via a terminal in accordance with the present invention. As shown, an<br>
authentication system for a dial-up networking connection via a terminal in<br>
accordance with the present invention includes a computer l requesting<br>
authentication, a terminal 2 snooping an authentication request packet including an<br>
authentication ID and password for computer l, which requests the authentication<br>
from the network 3 and generates an acknowledge packet with respect to the<br>
authentication request packet, and a network receiving the authentication request<br>
packet from the terminal 2 and transmitting an acknowledge packet with respect to<br>
the received authentication request packet to the terminal 2.<br>
[0017] Figure 3 describes the operation of the authentication system for the dial-up<br>
networking connection via the terminal in accordance with the present invention in<br>
detail. The authentication method for the dial-up networking connection via the<br>
terminal in accordance with the present invention includes:<br>
inputting an authentication ID and authentication password through a computer<br>
(S31);<br>
transmitting by the computer, an authentication request packet having the inputted<br>
authentication ID and authentication password to a terminal (S32);<br>
if the authentication ID and password transmitted to the terminal already exist in<br>
the previously authenticated IDs and passwords that were previously stored within<br>
the terminal (S33),<br>
then generating by the terminal, an acknowledge packet with respect to the<br>
authentication request packet and forwarding by the terminal, the<br>
authentication request packet to a network (S34),<br>
else storing the authentication ID and password in the terminal (S40);<br><br>
transmitting by the terminal, the generated acknowledge packet to the computer<br>
(S35);<br>
receiving by the terminal, a response packet with respect to the forwarded<br>
authentication request packet from the network (S36);<br>
discarding the received response packet when the received response packet is an<br>
acknowledge packet (S38); and<br>
notifying the computer and terminating a call request of the computer when the<br>
received response packet is a negative acknowledge packet (S39).<br>
[0018] The authentication method for the dial-up networking connection via the terminal in<br>
accordance with the present invention will now be described in detail. The<br>
description will be made on the assumption that the terminal in accordance with the<br>
present invention is a mobile communication terminal (MCT).<br>
[0019] To connect with a network using a dial-up networking connection service, a user<br>
inputs an authentication ID and password to a computer 1 and initiates a transmission<br>
to a dial-up networking connection service (S31). The computer 1 transmits an AT<br>
command to the MCT 2 in order to send a call request. The MCT 2, having received<br>
the AT command, transits a Radio Link Protocol (RLP) from an initial NULL state to<br>
an Establish state, receives a traffic channel and reports to the computer 1. The<br>
computer 1 having received such report initiates a Point to Point Protocol (PPP) setup<br>
procedure, and an authentication module of the computer 1 transmits an<br>
authentication request packet having the authentication ID and password inputted by<br>
the user (S32) to the MCT 2.<br>
[0020] After receiving the authentication request packet, The MCT 2 determines whether the<br>
authentication ID and password already exist in authentication information previously<br>
authorized and stored in the MCT (S33). The stored authentication information is<br>
stored in a nonvolatile memory (e.g., ROM). If the authentication ID and password<br>
were previously authenticated and stored, the MCT 2 generates an acknowledge<br>
packet responsive to the authentication request packet and forwards the authentication<br>
request packet to the network 3 (S34). However, if the authentication ID and<br><br>
password were not previously authenticated, the MCT 2 stores the authentication ID<br>
and password by updating the nonvolatile memory with the authentication ID and<br>
password. As in the related art, the computer 1 performs the authentication step upon<br>
receiving a response packet transmitted from the network (S40).<br>
[0021] After generating the acknowledge packet, the MCT 2 transmits the acknowledge<br>
packet to the computer 1 (S35). Having received the acknowledge packet, the<br>
computer 1 initiates an IPCP negotiation step for the dial-up networking connection<br>
without waiting for an acknowledge packet transmitted from the network 3.<br>
[0022] The network 3 generates a response packet responsive to the authentication request<br>
packet and transmits the generated response packet to the MCT 2(S36). The MCT 2,<br>
having received the response packet, determines whether the response packet is an<br>
acknowledge packet (S37). If the received response packet is an acknowledge packet,<br>
the MCT 2 simply discards the received response packet because the authentication<br>
processing procedure of the computer 1 has already been completed. However, if the<br>
received response packet is a negative acknowledge packet<br>
(PAP_Authenticate_NACK), the MCT 2 notifies the computer 1 and terminates the<br>
call.<br>
[0023] Therefore, in accordance with the present invention, the RTT duration is reduced<br>
because the computer 1 receives an acknowledge packet directly from the MCT 2 on<br>
the RM interface rather than indirectly from the network 3 on the UM interface, and<br>
the time to complete the authentication process is thereby reduced by 90% or more.<br>
The RRT duration over the UM interface is replaced with the RRT duration over the<br>
RM interface, such that the authentication time duration when the computer uses the<br>
dial-up networking connection service can be reduced.<br>
[0024] As the present invention may be embodied in several forms without departing from<br>
the spirit or essential characteristics thereof, it should also be understood that the<br>
above-described embodiments are not limited by any of the details of the foregoing<br>
description, unless otherwise specified, but rather should be construed broadly within<br>
its spirit and scope as defined in the appended claims, and therefore all changes and<br>
modifications that fall within the metes and bounds of the claims, or equivalence of<br>
such metes and bounds are therefore intended to be embraced by the appended claims.<br><br>
