				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to an automatic horse training system providing training of horses for races without human intervention. More particularly the invention relates to components embodying the system such as stables, horse training devices, actuating means etc. and the working sequence thereof i.e. process of the system components.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Applications comprising horse training systems of state of the art are highly dependent upon labor of human being. Horse training program is carried out by horse trainers applying a formerly determined training practice.<br>
Since horses are very sensitive creatures in terms of their psychological sense, and the horse training patterns are dependent upon human being, the efficiency of such training models becomes inevitably dependent on the pedagogical formation of the horse trainers. However, experiences have dramatically shown that lacking of such trainers not having pedagogical formation and so the difficulties for acknowledging psychologies of horses result violence of the trainers against horses being trained. This is the main mistake causing the racehorses away from the racecourses or even worse causing the horses death.<br>
Despite horses are very sensitive in terms of psychological sense, they however can be trained conditionally. In the light of this concept, horses are begun trained in the early years of their ages i.e. in the period of colt. Consequently, showing great performances of racehorses are not only dependent on their origins but also dependent on the features gained later than birth.<br>
In order to provide the racehorses run the particular distances in a fastest way, training program, given thereof, should be started by the colt period of the horses.<br>
However the main subject determining a horse to start the said training program is the physical improvement of the horse for carrying the rider for the training. Due to this obstacle, the common practice is simply to wait the colt to improve physically for training purpose according to present approach. Consequently, this particular period of time is idle in terms of valuable training time and in addition to that potential racehorses start their race orientation late, accompanying with losing their potential efficiency.<br>
When considered the number of horses being trained throughout the world, the training pattern dependent on human intervention may possibly hamper the training program scheduled earlier, so resulting a decrease of racehorse potentials.<br>
On the other hand, physical factors of horses are of crucial importance in terms of performances thereof during a race. Said physical factors basically include heart and lung functions and muscles. Determination of physical capabilities of racehorses is normally carried out after the race run i.e. when the horse is not its top performance. Naturally, such kind of physical activity determination do not reflect the actual values that are important for a racehorse performance.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Object of the present invention is to provide a complete automation in the process of horse training course.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to eliminate the trainers lacking pedagogical formation and human intervention for horse training so that psychological stabilization of horses can be achieved.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to preclude disabling and so being away from racecourses of the racehorses.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to monitor and evaluate the performances of the racehorses during the training by locating electrodes and veterinarian means to different regions of the bodies of horses.<br>
Automatic horse training system embodied in the scope of the present invention comprises four main components. Stabies, being one of the components, are arranged next to each other and occupy space that only one horse can exist therein. The second main component is horse training device rear and lateral sides covered by a flexible material thereof. The third main component is an electronic signal supplier for controlling the other system components such as horse training device stable doors etc. The fourth main component is a reflector unit for reflecting signals supplied by the electronic supplier unit.<br>
In addition to the said main components, there are also monitoring means placed out of the racecourse for monitoring physical performances of the racehorses by electrodes and veterinarian means located different regions of the bodies of horses.<br>
In the stables occupying only one horse there are guiding means, for example pistons, actuated by control unit and moving through the width of the stable. In order to introduce the horses in the horse training device, there is corridor existing between the stable and the horse training device. Another guiding means leading from inside the guiding means, moving through the width of the stable, forces the horse to introduce into the horse training device through the corridor.<br>
Before starting the training program, rear doors of the horse training devices are aligned with the corridor door that the horse leaving therethrough. Therefore the racehorse is introduced into the horse training device the rear and lateral sides are covered by a flexible material thereof. Similarly, the front side of the horse training device is kept close by an embodied locking means thereof. This locking means functions to maintain the horse in the horse training device and during the training program, but has a feature in that it can be unlocked when the horse starts sprinting.<br>
When the training program is completed, front doors of the horse training devices are aligned with the corridor door so that the horse can introduce into the corridor and to the stable finally. At this stage, the horse is forced to front door of the horse<br>
training device by a pushing means located rear side of the horse training device so that the horse can leave the device and enter to the corridor first and then the stable.<br>
One of the crucial feature of the present invention is to provide a multiple automatic components that enable the training of several horses simultaneously .<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Figure 1 illustrates the main components of the multiple horse training racecourse (4). Before starting training, stable door (17) is closed and displacements of horse guiding means (5,9) which are one within the other are zero.<br>
Control of the mechanical components comprised in the racecourse (4) is achieved by automatically controlled equipment i.e. by microprocessors. In this particular example the distance between the horse training devices (1) is constant.<br>
In order to start the training program, rear doors (11) of the horse training devices (1) are aligned with the corridor doors (10). Distance between the corridor door (10) and rear door (11) is sufficiently short so that the horse will be trained cannot escape anywhere but introduce into the horse training device (1). At this stage stable door (17) and the corridor door (10) are automatically opened and by actuating a pump (7), lubrication is passed through the cylinder pipes (8) so the first and the second horse guiding means (5,9) are moved at the same time. Since<br>
the first guiding means (5) are embodied by the same size with the stable (3) width, when actuated the horse being inside the stable (3) is directed towards the corridor (2). Once the first horse guiding means (5) reaches the level of stable door (17) its movement is terminated by a cylinder sensor (19) located in the stable (3). In this case the second guiding means (9) is moved through the corridor (2) so as to direct the horse towards the corridor door (10). Afterwards, the horse goes through the corridor door (10) first, and then the rear door (11) , which are both automatically opened, of the horse training device (1). After that the horse is introduced into the horse training device (1) and the rear door (11) is closed. Once the horse leaves the corridor (2), the horse guiding means (5,9) are returned back their initial positions.<br>
On the condition that a horse not able to leave the stable, running of the pump is terminated by means of stable sensors (18) located inside the stable (3).<br>
Lateral and rear sides of the horse training devices (1) are covered by a flexible material in order to prevent the horse to hurt himself whiie the training program. The front side not covered by the said flexible material, is closed by a locking means, however the locking means is also embodied by flexible material.<br>
Considering the embodiment according to figure 2, the horse training devices (1) are characterized by a shaft (14) placed the lateral sides thereof, and a wheel (13) disposed one end of the said shaft (14), furthermore the rails (16) that the wheel (13) placed therein. Once the horse training device (1) is actuated, the wheeis (13) inside the rails (14) rotate and the training program of the horses in the training device (1) the speeds of which can be maintained at a desired level starts.<br>
Actuation mechanisms of the horse training devices (1) can be achieved several means: According to one preferred embodiment, tractor means located rear or front sides of the training devices (1) are used to move thereof.<br>
After the training program is completed, as similar to the starting of the program, front doors (12) of the training devices are aligned with the corridor doors (10) in order to direct the horse towards the stable (3). At this stage front door (12) of the<br>
training device (1) is opened first and then the rear side having a semi-circular shape is opened from its hinge (20) by separating the rear side contacted with interface surface (21) from the lateral sides of the device (1). Afterwards pushing means (22) introducing to the training device (1) through the opened rear side, forces the horse to leave the training device (1) from the front door (12). Once the horse leaves the device (1), it goes through the corridor (2) and enter to the stable (3) as seen in figure 3. Since the racing shoes get dirty during the training program, the legs and the racing shoes of the horses are cleaned by brushes (30) located under a grid (29) while they go through the corridor (2).<br>
Alternatively the pushing means (22) providing guidance of the horses to the corridor (2) can be embodied behind the training device (1).<br>
In figure 4, detailed view of the locking means (15) is provided. According to the figure, locking means consists of flexible arms (24) connected by its ends to the training device (1) and a female part (24) and male part (26) that link the said flexible arms (24). There exists springs (23) so as to decrease the stiffness of the flexible arms. Since the speed of the training devices (1) are maintained constant at predetermined level, when a horse starts sprinting the locking means (15) can unlock itself so that the horse can leave the training device (1) without an obstacle.<br>
Mechanical components in the scope of the present invention can be controlled alternatively by an electronic signal supplier (27) and a reflector (28) unit that receives such electronic signals and reflects thereof to the mechanical components. Said alternative embodiment is illustrated in figure 5.<br>
Similarly another alternative embodiment can be suggested for the rail structure that provides the training devices (1) aligned and guided around the racecourse. In this alternative embodiment, training devices (1) are guided by means of a line (31) constructed above the devices (1) that are connected thereof. This kind of alternative embodiment is shown in figure 6. According to the figure, the training devices (1) are displaced vertically through the device columns (34) i.e. upwards and downwards directions by means of motors (33) located at the line connection points (32). In this structure there is no rear and front doors of the training devices<br><br>
(1) the movement of which take place in vertical direction. Similarly in this alternative training device, there is a locking means (15) located rear side of the device (1) for closing thereof.<br>
Above-mentioned racecourse (4) having training devices (1), stables (3) etc. that can be as single or multiple components may be embodied several racecourses that one within the other. Such embodiment is illustrated in figure 7.<br>
One of the multiply embodied racecourses is provided for training program that serves a constant speed for the horses and the other one is for sprinting of the horses and the third one is just for walking of horses.<br>
Said multiple racecourse, particularly the parts for sprinting and walking of the horses are embodied with some differences with respect to the constant speed embodiment in that the horse sprinting or walking is put on a bridle (36) and said bridle is connected to rails (16) as seen in figure 7 by means of cords (35) the ends of which are disposed into the rails (16) via wheels (13).<br>
On the other hand, in order to determine the physical performances during the training program, several electrodes and veterinarian means that can be controlled remotely by electronic signal transmission or alternatively by remote sensing are placed to different regions of the body of the horses. Therefore monitoring of the heart, lung and muscles during the training program is achieved. In addition to that instantaneous performance determining methods, it is possible to evaluate physical performances of the horses by samples taken from the spittle and blood of the horses.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
