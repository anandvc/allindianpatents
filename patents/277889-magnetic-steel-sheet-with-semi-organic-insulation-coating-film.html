TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] This invention relates to a magnetic steel sheet with a semi-organic<br>
insulation coating which has no deterioration of corrosion resistance and water<br>
resistance without containing a chromium compound and is excellent in the powdering<br>
resistance, scratch resistance, sticking resistance, TIG weldability and punchability but<br>
also the uniformity of coating appearance after annealing.<br>
<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002] An insulation coating of a magnetic steel sheet used for motors,<br>
transformers and the like is required to have various properties such as not only<br>
interlaminar resistance but also convenience in working, storage, stability in use and so<br>
on. Since the magnetic steel sheet is used in a variety of applications, it is attempted to<br>
develop various insulation coatings depending upon the application. When the<br>
magnetic steel sheet is subjected to punching, shearing, bending or the like, magnetic<br>
properties are deteriorated due to residual strain, so that stress relief annealing at a<br>
temperature of about 700 to 800Â°C is frequently conducted for solving this problem.<br>
In this case, therefore, the insulation coating must be resistant to the stress relief<br>
annealing.<br>
[0003] The Insulation coatings are roughly classified into three types:<br>
(1) an inorganic coating placing great importance on weldability and heat<br>
resistance, and being resistant to stress relief annealing;<br>
(2) a resin-containing inorganic coating aiming at an establishment of<br>
punchability and weldability, and being resistant to stress relief annealing (i.e., semiorganic<br>
coating); and<br>
(3) an organic coating being unable to be subjected to stress relief<br>
annealing in a special application, but the coatings containing an inorganic component<br>
as shown in the above items (1) and (2) are resistant to the stress relief annealing as<br>
general-purpose product, and they contain a chromium compound.<br>
[0004] Particularly, chromate-based insulation coating of type (2) can dramatically<br>
improve the punchability in a 1-coat and 1-bake production as compared with the<br>
inorganic insulation coating and are widely used.<br>
For example, in Patent Document 1 is disclosed a magnetic steel sheet<br>
having an electrical insulation coating obtained by applying a treating solution, which is<br>
formed by compounding a dichromate-based aqueous solution containing at least one<br>
3<br>
divalent metal with 5-120 parts by weight as a solid content of a resin emulsion having<br>
a ratio of vinyl acetate/VeoVA as an organic resin of 90/10 to 40/60 and 10-60 parts by<br>
weight of an organic reducing agent based on 100 parts by weight of CrO3 in the<br>
aqueous solution, onto a surface of a base iron sheet and then subjecting to baking<br>
according to the usual manner.<br>
[0005] However, environmental awareness is rising in recent years, and hence<br>
products having an insulation coating free of chromium compound are demanded by<br>
consumers even in the field of magnetic steel sheets.<br>
[0006] There are developed magnetic steel sheets with an insulation coating<br>
containing no chromium compound. For example, as an insulation coating containing<br>
no chromium but having a good punchability are described ones containing a resin and<br>
colloidal silica (alumina-containing silica) in Patent Document 2. Also, an insulation<br>
coating comprising one or more of colloidal silica, alumina sol and zirconia sol and<br>
containing a water soluble or emulsion resin is described in Patent Document 3, and an<br>
insulation coating composed mainly of a phosphate containing no chromium and<br>
containing a resin is described in Patent Document 4.<br>
[0007] However, these magnetic steel sheets with the insulation coatings containing<br>
no chromium have problems that the bond between inorganic substances is relatively<br>
weak and the corrosion resistance is poor as compared with those containing a<br>
chromium compound. Also, when back tension is applied by rubbing the steel sheet<br>
surface with a felt in slit working (by using a tension pad), the occurrence of powdering<br>
comes into question. Furthermore, there is a problem that the coating becomes weaker<br>
after the stress relief annealing and is easily scratched.<br>
[0008] For instance, the above problems can not be solved by simply using one or<br>
more of colloidal silica, alumina sol and zirconia sol in the method of Patent Document<br>
3. Also, sufficient investigations are not made with respect to the case of mixing these<br>
components in combination and at a specific ratio. Furthermore, in the case of a<br>
phosphate coating with a composition containing no chromium as described in Patent<br>
Document 4, sticking occurs and the water resistance tends to be deteriorated.<br>
These problems are apt to be easily caused in the baking at a relatively low<br>
temperature of not higher than 300Â°C, and the occurrence becomes particularly<br>
remarkable at a temperature of not higher than 200Â°C. Meanwhile, the baking<br>
temperature should be as low as possible from a viewpoint of the reduction of energy<br>
consumption and production cost, and so on.<br>
[0009] In addition, when using the methods described in Patent Documents 5 and 6,<br>
i.e. when using a coating comprising a polysiloxane polymer obtained by<br>
4<br>
copolymerizing polysiloxane with various organic resins and an inorganic compound<br>
such as silica, silicate or the like , there are problems that blowholes occur in the TIG<br>
welding, and that a spotted pattern occurs after annealing depending on the kind of the<br>
steel.<br>

[0017] In other words, the invention is a magnetic steel sheet provided on its<br>
surface with a semi-organic insulation coating comprising an inorganic component and<br>
an organic resin, wherein as the inorganic component is included<br>
(1) a Zr compound and an Si compound containing a plate-like silica as a ratio in a<br>

EFFECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0018] According to the invention, there can be provided a magnetic steel sheet<br>
with a semi-organic insulation coating which is excellent in various properties such as<br>
powdering resistance, scratch resistance, sticking resistance, TIG weldability and<br>
punchability, and has no deterioration of water resistance and corrosion resistance<br>
without containing a chromium compound, but also is excellent in the uniformity of<br>
coating appearance after annealing.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING<br>
[0019] FIG.1 is photographs showing coating appearance after stress relief<br>
annealing in comparison.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
[0020] The invention will be specifically described below.<br>
First, the reasons why the compounding ratio of the Zr compound and Si<br>
compound containing plate-like silica, and further B compound as the inorganic<br>
6<br>
component of the semi-organic coating in the invention is limited to the above range<br>
will be described. Moreover, it should be noted that mass % of these components is<br>
the ratio in a dry coating.<br>
[0021] Zr compound: 20 to 70 mass% as converted to ZrO2<br>
The Zr compound has a strong bonding force to oxygen and can be strongly<br>
bonded to an oxide, a hydroxide and the like on the Fe surface. Also, since the Zr<br>
compound has three or more chemical bonds, a strong coating can be formed by<br>
forming a network between mutual Zrs or between Zr and other inorganic compound<br>
without using chromium. However, when the ratio of the Zr compound in the dry<br>
coating is less than 20 mass% as converted to ZrO2, not only the adhesion property,<br>
corrosion resistance and powdering resistance are deteriorated, but also the deterioration<br>
of appearance after annealing due to an Si compound occurs. On the other hand, when<br>
it exceeds 70 mass%, the corrosion resistance and powdering resistance are deteriorated,<br>
and also the scratch resistance on the surface of the sheet after the stress relief annealing<br>
is deteriorated. Therefore, the amount of the Zr compound is limited to a range of 20<br>
to 70 mass% as converted to ZrO2.<br>
[0022] As such a Zr compound are mentioned, for example, zirconium acetate,<br>
zirconium propionate, zirconium oxychloride, zirconium nitrate, zirconium ammonium<br>
carbonate, zirconium potassium carbonate, zirconium hydroxychloride, zirconium<br>
sulfate, zirconium phosphate, zirconium sodium phosphate, zirconium potassium<br>
hexafluoride, tetra-n-propoxy-zirconium, tetra-n-butoxy-zirconium, zirconium tetraacetylacetonate,<br>
zirconium tributoxy acetylacetonate, zirconium tributoxy stearate, and<br>
so on. They may be used alone or in a combination of two or more.<br>
[0023] Si compound containing plate-like silica: 10 to 50 mass% as converted to<br>
SiO2<br>
The plate-like silica according to the invention is also called as leaf-like<br>
silica or scale-like silica, and has a layered silicate structure formed by laminating many<br>
SiO2 thin layers, and is mostly non-crystalline or microcrystalline. Such a plate-like<br>
silica is excellent in the inhibitive performance of permeating corrosive substance due<br>
to the layered form, excellent in the adhesion property due to the presence of many<br>
hydroxyl groups, and excellent in the slidability due to the flexibility as compared with<br>
a commonly-used silica particle, for example, colloidal silica or the like. Therefore, it<br>
is more effective in the improvement of corrosion resistance and punchability.<br>
The plate-like silica can be obtained by preparing agglomerated particles of<br>
laminated primary particles of the thin layers, and pulverizing these agglomerated<br>
particles.<br>
7<br>
Here, the average particle size of the plate-like silica is preferably about 10<br>
to 600 nm. More preferably, it is within a range of 100 to 450 nm. In addition, the<br>
aspect ratio (length/thickness ratio) of the plate-like silica is preferably about 2 to 400.<br>
More preferably, it is within a range of 10 to 100.<br>
[0024] Moreover, since the plate-like silica tends to be laminated by orienting<br>
parallel to the surface of the steel sheet, the length (length in the longitudinal direction)<br>
of the plate-like silica can be determined by observing the surface of the coating with<br>
SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope). Also, the thickness of the plate-like silica can<br>
be determined by observing the cross section of frozen fracture, FIB (focused ion beam)<br>
or the like with SEM. Therefore, the length and the thickness of the plate-like silica<br>
are measured at several places by SEM observation, and the aspect ratio (average<br>
length/average thickness ratio) is determined from an average of these measured values.<br>
Moreover, when silica is oval or polygonal, the average particle size in the<br>
sheet plane and the average thickness in the cross section are similarly measured at<br>
several places by SEM observation, and the aspect ratio is determined by (average<br>
particle size) / (average thickness).<br>
[0025] As the Si compounds other than the plate-like silica may be mentioned<br>
colloidal silica, fumed silica, alkoxysilane, siloxane and the like. They contributes to<br>
the improvement of corrosion resistance, and adhesion property after stress relief<br>
annealing. Generally, colloidal silica and fumed silica are spherical or an ellipsoidal<br>
body with an aspect ratio of less than 2, while alkoxysilane and siloxane are amorphous.<br>
When the compounding ratio of the plate-like silica in the whole of the Si<br>
compound is less than 50 mass%, good corrosion resistance and punchability as aimed<br>
in the invention cannot be obtained, so that the compounding ratio of the plate-like<br>
silica is preferable to be not less than 50 mass%. Of course, all of the Si compounds<br>
may be plate-like silica. A particularly preferable range is 50 to 100 mass%.<br>
Moreover, the compounding ratio of the plate-like silica can be determined,<br>
for example, by measuring SiO2 amount (B) in the plate-like silica region and SiO2<br>
amount (A) in the other regions at the FIB cross section and calculating B / (A+B) Ã<br>
100. Furthermore, the SiO2 amount in each region can be determined from the average<br>
Si concentration and the area of the region measured by EDS (Energy Dispersion<br>
Spectroscopy) and the like.<br>
[0026] The aforementioned Si compound containing the plate-like silica is useful in<br>
solving the problems caused when the Zr compound is added alone. More specifically,<br>
although the use of the Zr compound alone tends to deteriorate the corrosion resistance<br>
and powdering resistance and considerably deteriorate the scratch resistance on a stress<br>
8<br>
relief annealed steel sheet, the powdering resistance and scratch resistance can be<br>
largely improved by compounding proper amount of the Si compound.<br>
Here, when the amount of the Si compound included in the dry coating is<br>
less than 10 mass% as converted to SiO2, sufficient corrosion resistance cannot be<br>
obtained, while when it exceeds 50 mass%, the powdering resistance is deteriorated,<br>
and also the scratch resistance on the stress relief annealed steel sheet is deteriorated, so<br>
that the amount of the Si compound is limited to a range of 10 to 50 mass%.<br>
[0027] In the invention, a B compound may be further included as the inorganic<br>
component in addition to the aforementioned Zr compound and the Si compound<br>
containing the plate-like silica.<br>
B compound: 0.1 to 5 mass% as converted to B2O3<br>
The B compound advantageously contributes to solve the problems caused<br>
when the Zr compound is added alone. That is, when the Zr compound is added alone,<br>
a tendency of deteriorating the corrosion resistance and powdering resistance and<br>
considerably deteriorating the scratch resistance on the stress relief annealed steel sheet<br>
is seen. The reason is assumed due to the fact that when the Zr compound is used<br>
alone, the volume constriction is large in the baking and hence coating cracking easily<br>
occurs, and a place of exposing the substrate is partially caused.<br>
In contrast, when a proper amount of the B compound is compounded to the<br>
Zr compound, the coating cracking caused in the case of using the Zr compound alone<br>
can be effectively mitigated to considerably improve the powdering resistance.<br>
When the ratio of the B compound in the dry coating is not less than 0.1<br>
mass% as converted to B2O3, the addition effect is exerted, while when it is not more<br>
than 5 mass%, unreacted substances do not remain in the coating, and adhesive between<br>
the coatings (i.e. a defect of fusing the coatings to each other) after stress relief<br>
annealing (sticking) does not occur, so that the amount of the B compound is preferable<br>
to be within a range of 0.1 to 5 mass% as converted to B2O3.<br>
[0028] As the B compounds are mentioned boric acid, orthoboric acid, metaboric<br>
acid, tetraboric acid, sodium metaborate, sodium tetraborate and the like. They may be<br>
used alone or in a combination of two or more. However, it is not limited to them, and<br>
may include, for example, a compound dissolving in water to generate a boric ion, and<br>
also the boric ion may be polymerized in a linear or a cyclic state.<br>
[0029] In the invention, in addition to the aforementioned inorganic components,<br>
one or more selected from a nitric acid compound, a silane coupling agent and a<br>
phosphorous compound described below can be further included in the dry coating at a<br>
ratio of not more than 30 mass% in total. Moreover, the ratios of the nitric acid<br>
9<br>
compound, silane coupling agent and phosphorous compound in the dry coating are<br>
represented by a value converted to NO3 (nitric acid compound), a value converted to a<br>
solid content (silane coupling agent) and a value converted to P2O5 (phosphorous<br>
compound), respectively.<br>
The nitric acid compound, silane coupling agent and phosphorous<br>
compound effectively contribute to the improvement of corrosion resistance. When<br>
the ratio in the dry coating is not more than 30 mass% in total, unreacted substances do<br>
not remain in the coating and the water resistance is not deteriorated, so that the content<br>
is preferable to be not more than 30 mass% in total. In order to sufficiently develop<br>
the effect of these components, it is preferable to include these components at a ratio of<br>
not less than 1 mass% in the dry coating.<br>

[0033] In the invention, Hf, HfO2, TiO2, Fe2O3 and so on may be incorporated into<br>
the inorganic component as an impurity. However, a problem does not particularly<br>
occurs when the total amount of these impurities is not more than 1 mass% in the dry<br>
coating.<br>
[0034] In the invention, it is preferable that the organic resin is compounded at a<br>
ratio of 5 to 40 mass% so as to render the content of the inorganic component as<br>
11<br>
mentioned above in the dry coating into 60 to 95 mass%.<br>
In the invention, the organic resin is not particularly limited and any of<br>
known ones conventionally used are advantageously suitable. The organic resin<br>
includes, for example, aqueous resins (emulsion, dispersion, water soluble) of acryl<br>
resin, alkyd resin, polyolefin resin, styrene resin, vinyl acetate resin, epoxy resin, phenol<br>
resin, polyester resin, urethane resin, melamine resin and so on. Emulsions of acryl<br>
resin and ethylene acrylate resin are particularly preferable.<br>
[0035] The organic resins effectively contribute to the improvement of the<br>
corrosion resistance, scratch resistance and punchability. When the compounding ratio<br>
in the dry coating is not less than 5 mass%, the addition effect is large, while when it is<br>
not more than 40 mass%, the scratch resistance after stress relief annealing and TIG<br>
weldability are not deteriorated, so that the compounding ratio of the organic resin is<br>
preferable to be about 5 to 40 mass% as converted to a solid content.<br>
[0036] It should be noted that the ratio in the dry coating refers to a ratio of each<br>
component in a coating formed on a surface of a steel sheet by applying a treating<br>
solution containing the aforementioned components onto the steel sheet, and drying by<br>
baking. It can also be determined from residual components (solid content) after<br>
drying the treating solution at 180Â°C for 30 minutes.<br>
[0037] Furthermore, the invention does not interrupt the inclusion of additives<br>
usually used and other inorganic or organic compounds in addition to the<br>
aforementioned components.<br>
The additive is added for further enhancing performances and uniformity of<br>
the insulation coating, and includes a surfactant, an antirust agent, a lubricant, an<br>
antioxidant and the like. Moreover, the amount of the additive compounded in the dry<br>
coating is preferable to be not more than about 10 mass% from a viewpoint of the<br>
maintaining of sufficient coating properties.<br>
[0038] In the invention, the magnetic steel sheet as a starting material is not<br>
particularly limited, and any known ones are suitable.<br>
That is, any of so-called soft (magnetic) iron sheets (electric iron sheets)<br>
having a high magnetic flux density, common cold-rolled steel sheets such as SPPC and<br>
the like, non-oriented magnetic steel sheets containing Si and/or Al for increasing<br>
specific electrical resistance and so on are advantageously suitable for reducing iron<br>
loss. Particularly, it is preferable to use a steel sheet containing about 0.1 to 10 mass%<br>
of Si or (Si + Al) and/or a steel sheet having an iron loss W15/50 of not more than about 7<br>
W/kg.<br>
[0039] Next, the method for forming the insulation coating will be described.<br>
12<br>
In the invention, a pretreatment of a magnetic steel sheet as a starting<br>
material is not particularly defined. More specifically, the steel sheet may be untreated,<br>
but it is advantageous to be subjected to a degreasing treatment with alkali or the like<br>
and a pickling treatment with hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid or the<br>
like.<br>
Then, to the surface of this magnetic steel sheet is applied a treating solution<br>
formed by compounding a Zr compound and an Si compound containing a plate-like<br>
silica, and optionally a B compound and optionally one or more selected from a nitric<br>
acid compound, a silane coupling agent and a phosphorous compound, and, if necessary,<br>
an additive and the like together with an organic resin at given ratios and then baked to<br>
form an insulation coating. As a method for coating the treating solution for insulation<br>
coatings are applicable various methods usually and industrially used such as roll coater,<br>
flow coater, spray, knife coater and so on. Also, as the baking method are possible a<br>
hot air type, an infrared type, an induction heating type and the like as generally<br>
conducted. The baking temperature may be a normal level, and may be about 150 to<br>
350Â°C as a maximum reaching temperature on the steel sheet.<br>
[0040] The magnetic steel sheet with an insulation coating according to the<br>
invention can remove strain due to punching, for example, by subjecting to stress relief<br>
annealing. As a preferable stress relief annealing atmosphere is applied an atmosphere<br>
hardly oxidizing iron such as N2 atmosphere, DX gas atmosphere or the like. Here, the<br>
corrosion resistance can be further improved by setting a dew point high, for example<br>
Dp: about 5 to 60Â°C to slightly oxidize the surface and cut end surface. Also, the<br>
stress relief annealing temperature is preferably 700 to 900Â°C, more preferably 700 to<br>
800Â°C. The holding time of the stress relief annealing temperature is preferably longer,<br>
and more preferably not shorter than 2 hours.<br>
[0041] The amount of the insulation coating adhered is not particularly limited, but<br>
is preferably about 0.05 to 5 g/m2 per side. The coating amount or the total solid<br>
content mass of the insulation coating according to the invention can be measured from<br>
weight reduction after the removal of the coating through dissolving with alkali. If the<br>
coating amount is small, it can be determined by using a standard sample having a<br>
known coating amount and measuring a relationship between a detection intensity of Zr<br>
or Si by a fluorescent X-ray analysis and the coating amount per coating composition<br>
and converting the fluorescent X-ray analyzed intensity of Zr or Si into a coating<br>
amount depending upon the coating composition based on this calibration curve.<br>
When the coating amount is not less than 0.05 g/m2, the insulation property can be<br>
satisfied with the corrosion resistance, while when it is not more than 5 g/m2, not only<br>
13<br>
the adhesion property is improved, but also blistering is not caused in the coat baking,<br>
and the deterioration of coatability is not incurred. More preferably, it is 0.1 to 3.0<br>
g/m2. Although it is preferable to form insulation coatings on the both sides of the<br>
steel sheet, the coating may be formed on only one side depending on the purpose. In<br>
addition, the coating is formed on only one side and another insulation coating may be<br>
formed on the other side depending on the purpose.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
[0042] Although the effect of the invention will be concretely described based on<br>
examples below, the invention is not limited to these examples.<br>
Example 1<br>
A treating solution is prepared by adding a Zr compound and an Si<br>
compound containing a plate-like silica and further a nitric acid compound, a silane<br>
coupling agent, a phosphorus compound and an additive to a deionized water together<br>
with an organic resin so that components of an insulation coating after drying are shown<br>
in Tables 1-1 and 1-2. Moreover, the addition concentration to the deionized water is<br>
50g/l.<br>
Each of these treating solutions is applied to a surface of a test piece with a<br>
size of 150 mm in width and 300 mm in length cut out from a magnetic steel sheet<br>
[A230 (JIS C 2552 (2000))] of 0.5 mm in thickness by means of a roll coater, baked in a<br>
hot air baking oven at a baking temperature (temperature arriving in steel sheet) shown<br>
in Tables 1-1 and 1-2, and then allowed to cool to room temperature to form insulation<br>
coatings on the both sides.<br>
[0043] The results examined on the corrosion resistance and powdering resistance<br>
of the thus obtained magnetic steel sheets with semi-insulation coatings are shown in<br>
Table 2.<br>
Further, the scratch resistance after the steel sheets are subjected to stress<br>
relief annealing in a nitrogen atmosphere at 750Â°C for 2 hours, the scratch resistance,<br>
sticking resistance, TIG weldability, punchability, water resistance, and appearance<br>
after stress relief annealing are examined to obtain results also shown in Table 2.<br>

compound are shown in Table 4, types of the phosphorous compound and nitric acid<br>

[0061] As shown in Table 2, all of the magnetic steel sheets with a semi-organic<br>
insulation coating obtained according to the invention are excellent in not only the<br>
corrosion resistance and powdering resistance but also the scratch resistance after stress<br>
relief annealing, sticking resistance, TIG weldability, punchability and water resistance,<br>
and further excellent in the appearance after stress relief annealing.<br>
On the other hand, Comparative Examples 1 and 2, wherein the amount of<br>
Zr compound is out of the adequate range, are particularly poor in the corrosion<br>
resistance, powdering resistance and scratch resistance after annealing. Comparative<br>
Example 1 is also poor in the TIG weldability and appearance after annealing.<br>
22<br>
Also, Comparative Example 3, wherein the amount of Si compound is less<br>
than the lower limit, is poor in the corrosion resistance, powdering resistance, scratch<br>
resistance after annealing and TIG weldability, while Comparative Example 4, wherein<br>
the amount of Si compound is more than the upper limit, is particularly poor in the<br>
powdering resistance and scratch resistance after annealing.<br>
Furthermore, all of Comparative Examples 5 to 11 containing an amount of<br>
nitric acid compound or silane coupling agent or phosphorous compound exceeding<br>
over the adequate range are poor in the corrosion resistance, powdering resistance,<br>
scratch resistance after annealing and water resistance.<br>
Moreover, Comparative Example 12 using only colloidal silica without<br>
plate-like silica as an Si compound is particularly poor in the corrosion resistance,<br>
punchability, water resistance and appearance after annealing, and is also not as good as<br>
Inventive Examples in the powdering resistance and scratch resistance after annealing.<br>
[0062] Example 2<br>
A treating solution is prepared by adding a Zr compound, a B compound<br>
and a Si compound containing a plate-like silica, and further a nitric acid compound, a<br>
silane coupling agent, a phosphorous compound or an additive to a deionized water<br>
together with an organic resin so that components of an insulation coating after drying<br>
are shown in Tables 8-1 and 8-2. Moreover, the addition concentration to the<br>
deionized water is 50g/l.<br>
Each of these treating solutions is applied onto surfaces of a test piece with<br>
a size of 150 mm in width and 300 mm in length, which is cut out from a magnetic steel<br>
sheet [A230 (JIS C 2552 (2000))] of 0.5 mm in thickness, by means of a roll coater,<br>
baked in a hot air baking oven at a baking temperature (maximum reaching temperature<br>
on steel sheet) shown in Tables 8-1 and 8-2, and then allowed to cool to room<br>
temperature to form insulation coatings on the both sides.<br>
[0063] The results examined on the corrosion resistance and powdering resistance<br>
of the thus obtained magnetic steel sheet with semi-insulation coatings are shown in<br>
Table 9.<br>
Further, the scratch resistance the steel sheets are subjected to stress relief<br>
annealing in a nitrogen atmosphere at 750Â°C for 2 hours, the scratch resistance, sticking<br>
resistance, TIG weldability, punchability, water resistance, and appearance after stress<br>
relief annealing are examined to obtain results also shown in Table 9.<br>
Moreover, the type of the B compound is shown in Table 10.<br>
Also, the evaluation method for each property is the same as Example 1.<br>

[0068] As shown in Table 9, all of the magnetic steel sheets with a semi-organic<br>
insulation coating obtained according to the invention are excellent in not only the<br>
corrosion resistance and powdering resistance but also the scratch resistance after stress<br>
relief annealing, sticking resistance, TIG weldability, punchability and water resistance,<br>
and further excellent in the appearance after stress relief annealing.<br>
On the other hand, Comparative Examples 1 and 2, wherein the amount of<br>
Zr compound is out of the adequate range, are particularly poor in the corrosion<br>
resistance, powdering resistance and scratch resistance after annealing. Comparative<br>
Example 1 is also poor in the TIG weldability and appearance after annealing.<br>
Also, Comparative Example 3, wherein the amount of B compound is more<br>
than the upper limit, is particularly poor in the sticking resistance.<br>
Comparative Example 4, wherein the amount of Si compound is less than<br>
the lower limit, is poor in the corrosion resistance and TIG weldability, while<br>
Comparative Example 5, wherein the amount of Si compound is more than the upper<br>
limit, is particularly poor in the powdering resistance and scratch resistance after<br>
annealing.<br>
Furthermore, all of Comparative Examples 6 to 12 containing an amount of<br>
nitric acid compound or silane coupling agent or phosphorous compound exceeding<br>
over the adequate range are poor in the corrosion resistance and water resistance.<br>
Moreover, Comparative Example 13 using only colloidal silica without<br>
plate-like silica as an Si compound is particularly poor in the corrosion resistance, water<br>
resistance and appearance after annealing, and is also not as good as Inventive<br>
Examples in the powdering resistance, scratch resistance after annealing, sticking<br>
resistance and punchability.<br>
