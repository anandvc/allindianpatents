A SUPPORT AND ROTATABLE HOLDER ASSEMBLY<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an orientatable holder/support assembly and components thereof as well as related methodologies and resultant assemblies and uses. More specifically apparatus that allows for the adjustable attachment of an item to an object and more specifically for the use of a light and holders thereof for safet}^ helmets.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
There is frequently a need where an item of headwear such as a safety helmet conveniently should be associated with an accessory such as a torch or other lighting device. It the case of a lighting device it is important that it is appropriately oriented to take into account the needs of the wearer of the item of headwear. For example, a fireman advancing down a corridor under a pall of smoke may be crouched and therefore the lighting might be better directed in a different direction than would be the case if the person was upright.<br>
European patent application No. 1627181 states that it discloses a lamp fixing device for use on a protection helmet having a support unit integrated on the helmet, and an attaching unit inserted into a guide unit along the engagement direction, and wherein the engagement direction is perpendicular to the sliding direction. However, the means for attaching the lamp fixing device, and the means for indexing the torch to a particular orientation are formed from two separate parts. This requires an increased sized support element. Furthermore, the insertion of the lamp fixing device into the support unit requires both vertical and horizontal movements, something which increases the time in which it takes to attach or replace a lamp into the support unit. When in an emergency situation it is desired that all manipulations are as simple as possible since such situations generally dictate haste.<br>
 <br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a holder and/or support assembly which overcomes or at least ameliorates some of the abovementioned disadvantages or which at least provides the public with a useful choice.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
With reference to Figures 1 to 3 said holder 1 is substantially tubular and able to be engaged via its rotational insert 2 with the coupling member 3 of the mounting component 4. It should be appreciated that the holder 1 can be of any shape or design that enables an item 6 (such as a torch or flashlight) to be engaged with the holder 1. Such alternate embodiment include those known in the art which includes clips, locking mechanisms, magnetic attachments etc.<br>
In addition it should be appreciated that the holder 1 can be formed separately or integrally with the rotational insert 2.<br>
It should be appreciated that any accessory could thus be attached to the helmet 7 via the coupling member 3 of the mounting component 4 so long as the accessory has a rotational insert 2 that is complementaty to the coupling member 3.<br>
It is also possible to use the rotational insert 2 coupling member 3 assembly to act as a retention mechanism for attachment of multiple shell helmets such as disclosed in PCT/GB2004/004290. For example, each shell (with the exception of the irmermost layer) can have on its interior surface one of the above members that is complementary to the member on the outer surface of the adjacent inner shell layer. For example, if the mounting component 4 is located on the outside surface of<br>
 <br>
the imier most shell then a torch could be attach to it by using the holder 1 having the complementary shaped rotation insert 2 that inserts into the coupling member 3. If an further level of helmet shell is required, then the holder 1 can be removed and the next shell placed over the inner shell. The outer shell can thus have on its inner surface a complementary shaped member similar to the rotational insert 2 that inserts into the coupling member 3 of the inner helmet shell. The outer surface of the outer helmet can also have on it the coupling member 3 such that a torch (or any accessory) can now be transferred to the outer surface of the outer helmet.<br>
Both the holder 1 and rotational insert 2 can be formed out of any appropriate material or combination thereof such as a plastics, fibreglass, plastic composite reinforced with fibreglass or Aramid materials, metal, wood etc.<br>
As seen in Figure 1 Figure 1. said rotational insert 2 is a substantially circular multi-sided disk integrally moulded with said holder 1. Said rotational insert 2 is engagable within the coupling member 3 as shown in Figure 4Figure 4. Once engaged the complementar&gt;' nature of the coupling member 3 holds said rotational insert 2 tlrmly in place.<br>
The mounting component may have on its inner surface a mechanism to keep the rotational insert in place, such as for example a projection.<br>
When in use, the interengagement of the rotational insert 2 and/or holder 1 with the mounting component 4 is performed by the user sliding the rotational insert 2 into the coupling member 3 such that the rotational insert 2 is held within the walls 5 of the coupling member 3.<br>
As seen in Figure 5Fi-ewe-§ the rotational insert 2 is held tlrmly in place in an indexing position owing to the complementary nature of the coupling member 3. The side walls 5 of the coupling member are in close proximity with the sides of the rotational insert 2 preventing passive rotation of the holder 1 relative to the mounting component 4.<br>
When desired, a user can easily cause rotation of the rotational insert 2. As seen in Figure 6Figure 6. when the holder 1 is rotated relative to the mounting<br>
 <br>
component 4, the rotational insert 2 passes through a transitional phase between two adjacent preferred ahgnments. Such movement causes distortion of the side wall 5 of the couphng member 3 hence encouraging rotation of the rotational insert 2 to a preferred alignment.<br>
Whilst a twelve sided rotational insert is shown in the attached figures it should be appreciated that a rotational insert 2 with any number of sides can be used, so long as they allow the rotational insert 2 to be held firmly in place when in a preferred alignment.<br>
The number of preferred alignments is related to the number of sides of which the rotational insert 2 is formed. For example, as shown in the attached tlgures, a twelve sided rotational insert 2 comprises 11 possible preferred alignments.<br>
Other embodiments could include a ball foot indexable with the coupling member.<br>
As seen in Figure 7 an assembly of the present invention can is attachable to an object such as a helmet and once attached can received an item 6 such as a torch (as seen in Figure SFi^ure 8).<br>
If desired the mounting component 4 can be separated from the helmet 7, and in such an embodiment the mounting component 4 is therefore able to be removed and attached from the helmet 7. Many different methods can be used form attaching the mounting component to the helmet such as clips, magnets, lock-and-key arrangement, Velcro etc. As shown in Figure 3Figure 3. projections 8 on the base of the mounting component 4 can be used such that they engage or peg into complementary holes on the helmet.<br>
It should be appreciated that the mounting component 4 can be permanently fixed to the helmet 7, or indeed, could be formed integrally with the helmet 7.<br>
