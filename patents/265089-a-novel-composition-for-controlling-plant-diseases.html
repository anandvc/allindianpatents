				<td>The present invention relates to a novel composition for controlling plant diseases.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION <br>
This invention relates to certain benzamides, their N-oxides, agriculturally suitable salts, certain advantageous compositions containing a mixture of benzamides and other fungicides and methods of their use as fungicides.<br>
The control of plant diseases caused by fungal plant pathogens is extremely important in achieving high crop efficiency. Plant disease damage to ornamental, vegetable, field, cereal, and fruit crops can cause significant reduction in productivity and thereby result in increased costs to the consumer. Many products are commercially available for these purposes, but the need continues for new products that are more effective, less costly, less toxic, or environmentally safer.<br>
WO 99/42447 discloses certain benzamides of formula i as fungicides<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein, among others,<br>
R1 is H, alkyl or acyl;<br>
R2 is H or alkyl;and<br>
L is (C=O)-, -SO2- or -(OS)-.<br>
WO 02/16322 discloses a novel process for preparing certain benzamides of formula ii that are useful as fungicides<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein, among others,<br>
X is halogen;<br>
Y is halogen, haloalkyl, alkoxycarbonyl or alkylsulfonyl;<br>
each R1 and R2 is idependeatly halogen;<br>
m is 0,1 or 2; and<br>
n is 0 to 3.<br>
Fungicides that effectively control plant fungi, particularly of me class Oomycetes, such as Phytophthora spp. and Plasmopara spp., are in constant demand by growers, Combinations of fungicides are often used to facilitate disease control and to retard resistance development. It is desirable to enhance the activity spectrum and the efficacy of disease control by using mixtures of active ingredients that provide a combination of<br>
curative, systemic and preventative control of plant pathogens. Also desirable are combinations that provide greater residual control to allow for extended spray intervals. It is also very desirable to combine fungicidal agents that inhibit different biochemical pathways in the fungal pathogens to retard development of resistance to any one particular plant disease control agent.<br>
It is in all cases particularly advantageous to be able to decrease the quantity of chemical agents released in the environment while ensuring effective protection of crops from diseases caused by plant pathogens. Mixtures of fungicides may provide significantly better disease control than could be predicted based on the activity of the individual components. This synergism has been described as "the cooperative action of two components of a mixture, such that the total effect is greater or more prolonged than the sum of the effects of the two (or more) taken independently" (see Tames, P. M. L., Neth. J. Plant Pathology, (1964), 70, 73-80).<br>
There is a desire to find fungicidal agents that are particularly advantageous in achieving one or more of the preceding objectives.<br>

"Aromatic" indicates that each of the ring atoms is essentially in the same plane and has a p-orbital perpendicular to the ring plane, and in which (4n + 2) % electrons, when n is 0 or a positive integer, are associated with the ring to comply with Huckel's rule. The term "aromatic carbocyclic ring" includes fully aromatic carbocycles (e.g. phenyl). The term "nonaromatic carbocyclic ring" denotes fully saturated carbocycles as well as partially or fully unsaturated carbocycles where the Hiickel rule is not satisfied. The term "hetero" in connection with rings refers to a ring in which at least one ring atom is not carbon and which can contain 1 to 4 heteroatoms independently selected from the group consisting of nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur, provided that each ring contains no more than 4 nitrogens, no more than 2 oxygens and no more than 2 sulfurs. The terms "heteroaromatic ring includes fully aromatic heterocycles. The term "nonaromatic heterocyclic ring" denotes fully saturated heterocycles as well as partially or fully unsaturated heterocycles where the Hiickel rule is not satisfied. The heterocyclic ring can be attached through any available carbon or nitrogen by replacement of a hydrogen on said carbon or nitrogen.<br>
One skilled in the art will appreciate that not all nitrogen containing heterocycles can form N-oxides since the nitrogen requires an available lone pair for oxidation to the oxide;. one skilled in the art will recognize those nitrogen containing heterocycles which can form iV-oxides. One skilled in the art will also recognize that tertiary amines can form iV-oxides. Synthetic methods for the preparation of N-oxides of heterocycles and tertiary amines are very well known by one skilled in the art including the oxidation of heterocycles and tertiary amines with peroxy acids such as peracetic and m-chloroperbenzoic acid (MCPB A), hydrogen peroxide, alkyl hydroperoxides such as ?-butyl hydroperoxide, sodium perborate, and dioxiranes such as dimethydioxirane. These methods for the preparation of iV-oxides have been extensively-described and reviewed in-the literature, see for example: T. L. Gilchrist in Comprehensive Organic Synthesis, vol. 7, pp 748-750, S. V. Ley, Ed., Pergamon Press; M. Tisler and B. Stanovnik in Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemist?y, vol. 3, pp 18-20, A. J. Boulton and A. McKillop, Eds., Pergamon Press; M. R. Grimmett and B. R. T. Keene in Advances in Heterocyclic Chemistiy, vol. 43, pp 149-161, A. R. Katritzky, Ed., Academic Press; M. Tisler andB. Stanovnik in Advances in Heterocyclic Chemistiy, vol. 9, pp 285-291, A. R. Katritzky and A. J. Boulton, Eds., Academic Press; and G. W. Ff. Cheeseman and E. S. G. Werstiuk in Advances in Heterocyclic Chemistry, vol. 22, pp 390-392, A. R. Katritzky and A. J. Boulton, Eds., Academic Press.<br><br>
The total number of carbon atoms in a substituent group is indicated by the "Ci-Cj" prefix where i and j are numbers from 1 to 8. For example, C1-C3 alkylsulfonyl designates methylsulfonyl through propyisulfonyl; C2 alkoxyalkyl designates CH3OCH2; C3 alkoxyalkyl designates, for example, CH3CH(OCH3), CH3OCH2CH2 or CH3CH2OCH2; and C4 alkoxyalkyl designates the various isomers of an alkyl group substituted with an alkoxy group containing a total of four carbon atoms, examples including CH3CH2CH2OCH2 and CH3CH2OCH2CH2.<br>
When a compound is substituted with a substituent bearing a subscript that indicates the number of said substituents can exceed 1, said substituents (when they exceed 1) are independently selected from the group of defined substituents. Further, when the subscript indicates a range, e.g. (R)i_j, then the number of substituents may be selected from the. integers between i and j inclusive.<br>
When a group contains a substituent which can be hydrogen, for example R1 or R2 then, when this substituent is taken as hydrogen, it is recognized that this is equivalent to said group being unsubstituted.<br>
Compounds of Formula I can exist as one or more stereoisomers. The various stereoisomers include enantiomers, diastereomers, atropisomers and geometric isomers. One skilled in the art will appreciate that one stereoisomer may be more active and/or may exhibit beneficial effects when enriched relative to the other stereoisomer(s) or when separated from the other stereoisomers). Additionally, the skilled artisan knows how to separate, enrich, and/or to selectively prepare said stereoisomers. Accordingly, the present invention comprises compounds selected from Formula I, iV-oxides and agriculturally suitable salts thereof. The compounds of Formula I may be present as a mixture of stereoisomers, individual stereoisomers, or as an optically active form. In particular, when R1 and R2 of Formula I are different, then said Formula possess es a chiral center at the carbon to which R1 and R2 are commonly bonded..<br>
This invention includes racemic mixtures of equal parts of Formula I' and Formula I".<br>
(Formula removed)<br><br>
wherein A, B W, R1, R2 and R3 are as defined above. ' In addition, this invention includes compositions that are enriched compared to the racemic mixture in an enantiomer of the Formula V or Formula F'. This invention also includes compositions wherein component (a) is enriched in a component (a) enantiomer of<br>
Formula I' compared to the racemic mixture of component (a). Included are compositions comprising the essentially pure enantiomers of Formula F. This invention also includes compositions wherein component (a) is enriched in a component (a) enantiomer of Formula F' compared to the racemic mixture of component (a). Included are compositions comprising the essentially pure enantiomers of Formula I".<br>
When enantiomerically enriched, one enantiomer is present in greater amounts that the other and the extent of enrichment can be defined by an expression of enantiomer excess("ee"), which is defined as 100(2x-l) where x is the mole fraction of the dominant enantiomer in the enantiomer mixture (e.g., an ee of 20% corresponds to a 60:40 ratio of enantiomers).<br>

Strobilurin fungicides such as azoxystrobin, kresoxim-methyL, metominostrobin/fehominostrobin (SSF-126), picoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin and trifloxystrobin are known to have a fungicidal mode of action which inhibits the bc1 complex in the mitochondrial respiration chain (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., 1999, 38, 1328-1349). Methyl (£)-2-[[6-(2-cyanophenoxy)-4-pyrimidinyl]oxy]-a-(memoxyimino)benzeneacetate (also known as azoxystrobin) is described as a bc1 complex inhibitor in Biochemical Society Transactions 1993, 22, 68S. Methyl (E)-a-(memoxyimino)-2-[(2-methylphenoxy)methyl]benzeneacetate (also known as kresoxim-methyl) is described as a bc1 complex inhibitor in Biochemical Society Transactions 1993, 22, 64S. (£)-2-[(2,5-Dimemylphenoxy)memyl]-a-(memoxyimino)-N-methylbenzeneacetamide is described as a bc1 complex inhibitor in Biochemistiy and Cell Biology 1995, 55(3), 306-311.

The class of sterol biosynthesis inhibitors includes DMI andnon-DMI compounds, that control fungi by inhibiting enzymes in the sterol biosynthesis pathway. DMI fungicides have a common site of action within the fungal sterol biosynthesis pathway; that is, an inhibition of demethylation at position 14 of lanosterol or 24-methylene dihydrolanosterol, which are precursors to sterols in fungi. Compounds acting at this site are often referred to as demethylase inhibitors, DM fungicides, orDMIs. The demethylase enzyme is sometimes referred to by other names in the biochemical literature, including cytochrome P-450 (14DM). The demethylase enzyme is described in, for example, /. Biol. Chem. 1992, 267, 13175-79 and references cited therein. DMI fungicides fall into several classes: azoles<br>
(including triazoles and imidazoles), pyrimidines, piperazines and pyridines. The triazoles includes bromuconazole, cyproconazole, difenoconazole, diniconazole, epoxiconazole. fenbuconazole, fiuquinconazole, flusilazole. flutriafol, hexaconazole, ipconazole, metconazole, penconazole, propiconazole, tebuconazole, tetraconazole, triadimefon, triadimenol, triticonazole and uniconazole. The imidazoles include clotrimazole, econazole, imazalil, isoconazole, miconazole and prochloraz. The pyrimidines include fenarimol, nuarimol and triarimol. The piperazines include triforine. The pyridines include buthiobate and pyrifenox. Biochemical investigations have shown that all of the above mentioned fungicides are DMI fungicides as described by K. H. Ruck, et al. in. Modem Selective Fungicides - Properties, Applications and Mechanisms of Action, Lyr, H., Ed; Gustav Fischer Verlag: New York, 1995, 205-258.<br>
The DMI fungicides have been grouped together to distinguish them from other sterol biosynthesis inhibitors, such as, the morpholine and piperidine fungicides. The morpholines and piperidines are also sterol biosynthesis inhibitors but have been shown to inhibit later steps in the sterol biosynthesis pathway. The morpholines include aldimorph, dodemorph, fenpropimorph, tridemorph and trimorphamide. The piperidines include fenpropidin. Biochemical investigations have shown that all of the above mentioned morpholine and piperidine fungicides are sterol biosynthesis inhibitor fungicides as described by K. H. Ruck, et al. in. Modem Selective Fungicides - Properties, Applications and Mechanisms of Action, Lyr, H., Ed.; Gustav Fischer Verlag: New York, 1995,185-204. Pyrimidinone Fungicides (component (bl))<br>

Formulation/Utility<br>
Compositions of this invention will generally be used as a formulation or composition comprising at least one carrier selected from agriculturally suitable liquid diluents, solid diluents and surfactants. The formulation or composition ingredients are selected to be consistent with the physical properties of the active ingredient, mode of application and environmental factors such as soil type, moisture and temperature. Useful formulations include liquids such as solutions (including emulsifiable concentrates), suspensions,<br><br>
emulsions (including microemulsions and/or suspoemulsions) and the like which optionally can be thickened into gels. Useful formulations further include solids such as dusts, powders, granules, pellets, tablets, films, and the like which can be water-dispersible ("wettable") or water-soluble. Active ingredient can be (micro)encapsulated and further formed into a suspension or solid formulation; alternatively the entire formulation of active ingredient can be encapsulated (or "overcoated"). Encapsulation can control or delay release of the active ingredient. Sprayable formulations can be extended in suitable media and used at spray volumes from about one to several hundred liters per hectare. High-strength compositions are primarily used as intermediates for further formulation.<br>
The formulations will typically contain effective amounts (e.g. from 0.01-99.99 weight percent) of active ingredients together with diluent and/or surfactant within the following approximate ranges which add up to 100 percent by weight.<br>

The weight ratios of these various mixing partners to compounds of Formula I of this invention typically are between 100:1 and 1:100, preferably between 30:1 and 1:30, more preferably between 10:1 and 1:10 and most preferably between 4:1 and 1:4.<br>
The compositions of this invention are useful as plant disease control agents. The present invention therefore further comprises a method for controlling plant diseases caused by fungal plant pathogens comprising applying to the plant or portion thereof to be protected, or to the plant seed or seedling to be protected, an effective amount of a compound of the invention or a fungicidal composition containing said compound. The compounds and compositions of this invention provide control of diseases caused by a broad spectrum of fungal plant pathogens in the Basidiomycete, Ascomycete, Oomycete and Deuteromycete classes. They are effective in controlling a broad spectrum of plant diseases, particularly foliar pathogens of ornamental, vegetable, field, cereal, and fruit crops. These pathogens include Plasmopara viticola, Phytophthora infestans, Peronospora tabacina,<br>
Pseudoperonospora cuhensis, Pythium aphanidermatum, Altemaria brassicae, Septoria nodoTum, Septoria tritici, Cercosporidium personation, Cercospora arachidicola, Pseudocercosporella heipotrichoides, Cercospora beticola, Botiytis cinerea, Monilinia fructicola, Pyricularia oiyzae, Podosphaera leucotficha, Venturia inaequalis, Eiysipke graminis, Uncinula necatur, Puccinia recondita, Puccinia graminis, Hemileia vastafrix, Puccinia striiformis, Puccinia aracludis, Rhizoctonia solani, Sphaerothecafuliginea, Fusarium oxysporum, Verticillium dahliae, Pythium aphanidermatwn, Phytophthora megasperma, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Sclerotium rolfsii, Erysiphepolygoni, Pyrenophora teres, Gaeumannomyces graminis, Rynchosporium secalis, Fusarium roseum, Bremia lactucae and other generea and species closely related to these pathogens. The compositions of the invention are especially effective in controlling Plasmopara viticola on grapes and Phytophthora infestans on potatoes and tomatoes.<br>
Plant disease control is ordinarily accomplished by applying an effective amount of a compound of this invention either pre- or post-infection, to the portion of the plant to be protected such as the roots, stems, foliage, fruit, seeds, tubers or bulbs, or to the media (soil or sand) in which the plants to be protected are growing. The compounds can also be applied to the seed to protect the seed and seedling.<br>
Rates of application for these compounds can be influenced by many factors of the environment and should be determined under actual use conditions. Foliage can normally be protected when treated at a rate of from less than 1 g/ha to 5,000 g/ha of active ingredient. Seed and seedlings can normally be protected when seed is treated at a rate of from 0.1 to 10 g per kilogram of seed.<br>
Synergism has been described as "the cooperative action of two components of a mixture, such that the total effect is greater or more prolonged than the sum of the effects of the two (or more) taken independently" (see Tames, P. M. L., Neth. J. Plant Pathology, 1964, 70, 73-80). It is found that compositions containing the compound of Formula I and fungicides with a different mode of action exhibit synergistic effects.<br>
The presence of a synergistic effect between two active ingredients (e.g. componet (a) and component (b)) is established with the aid of the Colby equation (see Colby, S. R. In Calculating Synergistic and Antagonistic Responses of Herbicide Combinatioiis, Weeds, 1967,15,20-22):<br>
(Formula removed)<br><br>
Using the methods of Colby, the presence of a synergistic interaction between two active ingredients is established by first calculating the predicted activity, p, of the mixture based on activities of the two components applied alone. If p is lower than the experimentally established effect, synergism has occurred. In the equation above, A is the<br>
fungicidal activity in percentage control of one component applied alone at rate x. The B term is the fungicidal activity in percentage control of the second component applied at rate y. The equation estimates p, the fungicidal activity of the mixture of A at rate x with B at rate y if their effects are strictly additive and no interaction has occurred.<br>
The following TESTS can be used to demonstrate the control efficacy of compositions of this invention on specific pathogens. The pathogen control protection afforded by the compositions is not limited, however, to these species. See Index Tables A for compound designations for component (a) compounds used in the TESTS.<br>
(Table removed)<br><br>
BIOLOGICAL EXAMPLES OF THE INVENTION The following TESTS demonstrate the control efficacy of compositions of this invention on specific pathogens. The pathogen control protection afforded by the compounds is not limited, however, to these species.<br>
Test suspensions comprising a single active ingredient are sprayed to demonstrate the control efficacy of the active ingredient individually. To demonstrate the control efficacy of a combination, (a) the active ingredients can be combined in the appropriate amounts in a single test suspension, (b) stock solutions of individual active ingredients can be prepared and then combined in the appropriate ratio, and diluted to the final desired concentration to form a test suspension or (c) test suspensions comprising single active ingredients can be sprayed sequentially in the desired ratio.<br>

Test compositions were first mixed with purified water containing 250 ppm of the surfactant Trem® 014 (polyhydric alcohol esters). The resulting test suspensions were then used in the following tests. Test suspensions were sprayed to the point of run-off on the test plants at the equivalent rates of 5, 10, 20, 25, 50 or 100 g/ha of active ingredient. Spraying a 40 ppm test suspension to the point of run-off on the test plants is the equivalent of a rate of<br>
100 g/ha. The tests were replicated three times and the results reported as the average of the three replicates.<br>
TEST A (Preventive Control) The test suspensions were sprayed to the point of run-off on Potato seedlings. The following day the seedlings were inoculated with a spore suspension of Phytophthora infestans (the causal agent of tomato and potato late blight) and incubated in a saturated atmosphere at 20 °C for 24 hours, and then moved to a growth chamber at 20 °C for 5 days, after which disease ratings were made.<br>
TEST B (Curative Control) Potato seedlings were inoculated with a spore suspension of Phytophthora infestans (the causal agent of tomato and potato late blight) 24 hours prior to application and incubated in a saturated atmosphere at 20 °C for 24 hours. The test suspensions were then sprayed to the point of run-off on the potato seedlings. The following day the seedlings were moved to a growth chamber at 20 °C for 5 days, after which disease ratings were made.<br>
TEST C (Extended Preventive Control)<br>
The test suspensions was sprayed to the point of run-off on potato seedlings. Six days later, the seedlings were inoculated with a spore suspension of Phytophthora infestans (the causal agent of tomato and potato late blight) and incubated in a saturated atmosphere at 20 °C for 24 h, and then moved to a growth chamber at 20 °C for 5 days, after which disease ratings were made.<br>
Results for Tests A-C are given in Table A. In the table, a rating of 100 indicates 100% disease control and a rating of 0 indicates no disease control (relative to the controls). Columns labeled Avg indicates the average of three replications. Columns labeled Exp indicate the expected value for each treatment mixture using the Colby equation. Tests demonstrating control greater than expected are indicated with *.<br>

Moreover, compositions comprising components (a) and (b) alone can be conveniently mixed with an optional diluent prior to applying to the crop to be protected. Accordingly, this invention provides an improved method of combating fungi, particularly fungi of the class Oomycetes such as Phytophthora spp. and Plasmopcwa spp., in crops, especially potatoes, grapes and tomatoes.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
