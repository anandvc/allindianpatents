				<td>BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A process and an arrangement for re-starting an interrupted spinning process<br>
The present invention relates to a process for re-starting an interrupted spinning<br>
process in a spinning arrangement comprising an air-jet aggregate and a drafting<br>
unit, whereby a prepared end of a thread already spun is positioned in the area of a<br>
delivery roller pair of the drafting unit, thereafter transported in spinning direction and<br>
joined by means of a piecing process to a staple fibre strand fed thereto by the<br>
drafting unit, whereby the piecing process is controlled in dependence on the position<br>
of the thread end.<br>
The present invention relates further to a spinning arrangement comprising an air-jet<br>
aggregate and a drafting unit for re-starting an interrupted spinning process by<br>
means of piecing a thread end to a drafted staple fibre strand, comprising a delivery<br>
roller pair bordering the drafting zone of a drafting unit, to which delivery roller pair a<br>
first drive motor is arranged, comprising further drafting unit roller pairs arranged<br>
upstream of the above mentioned delivery roller pair, to which further drafting roller<br>
pairs a joint second drive motor is arranged, also comprising means for opening and<br>
closing the delivery roller pair, also comprising a sensor for detecting a prepared end<br>
of an already spun thread which has been placed in the opened delivery roller pair<br>
and subsequently transported in spinning direction by the delivery roller pair which is<br>
now closed again, and also comprising controlling means connected with the sensor<br>
and the second drive motor.<br>
A process and an arrangement of this type are prior art in European published patent<br>
application 12 19 737. In this publication, an improvement at the piecing point by<br>
means of drafting control is primarily involved, whereby a monitoring of the thread<br>
end by a sensor and control of the feed take place in dependence thereon. One<br>
drive at least must hereby be accelerated in the piecing phase. The piecing process<br>
itself takes place either at operational speed or in the acceleration phase of both<br>
drive motors. Both are disadvantageous with regard to consistency. When the<br>
piecing process takes place at operational speed, the transport speeds of the thread<br>
and of the staple fibre strand are so high that little time remains for a delicate<br>
controlling of the process. When, on the other hand, the piecing process takes place<br>
during the acceleration process of both drive motors, there is dependency, with<br>
regard to the consistency, on the tolerances or on the slip of the transport rollers.<br><br>
It is an object of the present invention to make the piecing process more consistent<br>
while retaining the advantages of the known process and the known arrangement.<br>
This object has been achieved in accordance with the present invention in that during<br>
the piecing process, the staple fibre strand and the thread have, in relation to the<br>
operational speed, a reduced and constant transport speed.<br>
With regard to the arrangement the object is achieved in that in the moment of<br>
piecing of the thread end to the staple fibre strand, the first drive motor and the<br>
second drive motor both run at reduced and constant piecing speeds in comparison<br>
to their operational speeds.<br>
Because the piecing process now takes place at a reduced transport speed in<br>
relation to the operational speed, a longer period of time is now available for the<br>
actual piecing. Furthermore, because the piecing speed is constant, there is less<br>
dependency on tolerances or slip. The entire piecing process can now take place at a<br>
more controlled pace.<br>
During the piecing process, the staple fibre strand as well as the thread is<br>
transported by the delivery roller pair. The position of the thread end can hereby be<br>
detected by a sensor, which is, via a control means, connected to a drive for feeding<br>
the staple fibre strand. The sensor gives the starting signal for the delayed feed.<br>
In an embodiment and a variation of the invention it can be provided that the first part<br>
of the fed staple fibre strand can be removed as trash, before the staple fibre strand<br>
is connected to the thread end by the piecing process. The fibres of the staple fibre<br>
strand coming from the delivery roller pair are, for the purpose of the invention, first<br>
deflected by means of a type of fibre stream deflection, whereby this process can<br>
take place upstream of the air-jet aggregate or inside the air-jet aggregate. This<br>
deflection can be mechanical or pneumatic. The fibre stream of the staple fibre<br>
strand, after a certain delay in time, can be switched back to its original course and<br>
the air-jet aggregate put into operation again by means of a supply of spinning<br>
pressure when the end of the thread is recognized by the sensor, or when caused to<br>
do so by a time control device. In the case of such a fibre stream deflection, there is<br>
no dependency on the acceleration behaviour of the first and second drive motors<br>
and thus very short piecing places can be realized.<br><br>
In a further embodiment of the present invention it can be provided that directly after<br>
the piecing process the fed fibre amount is increased for a short time in order to<br>
compensate thin thread places. This can be easily controlled by the second drive<br>
motor.<br>
With regard to the arrangement it can be provided that the first drive motor is not only<br>
arranged to the delivery roller pair, but also at the same time to a withdrawal roller<br>
pair that withdraws the thread from the air-jet aggregate. The withdrawal roller pair<br>
hereby naturally maintains a transport speed which ensures a certain tension.<br>
It can be advantageous to arrange a thread reservoir downstream of the withdrawal<br>
roller pair, said thread reservoir taking up a thread loop and being effective during the<br>
run-up of the first drive motor to the piecing speed, which thread reservoir is<br>
evacuable during the constant piecing speed phase. This variation is based on the<br>
knowledge that the winding device arranged downstream of the withdrawal roller pair<br>
has, as a rule, a relatively large crosswound bobbin to move and that because of this,<br>
a certain degree of slip of the thread can occur in the area of the crosswound bobbin<br>
during the acceleration phase of the individual drive motors, which then leads<br>
temporarily to a thread loop between the withdrawal roller pair and the winding<br>
device. This thread loop can be monitored in the thread reservoir and reduced again<br>
during the constant transport speed in the piecing phase.<br>
When the variations with the fibre current deflection are chosen, it is possible that the<br>
first drive motor and the second drive motor start up at the same time and the<br>
deflecting device, dependent on the position of the end of the detected thread, is<br>
rendered ineffective again. It can hereby be provided that the first drive motor and<br>
the second drive motor maintain a constant speed ratio to one another from the<br>
starting point onwards, which already corresponds to the speed ratio during<br>
operation.<br>

according to Figure 5.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The spinning arrangement according to Figure 1 serves the spinning of a thread 1<br>
from a staple fibre strand 2. The spinning arrangement comprises as essential<br>
component parts an air-jet aggregate 3, which, for example, can be designed<br>
according to the above mentioned European published patent application 12 19 737,<br>
said spinning arrangement also comprising a drafting unit 4 designed preferably as a<br>
three-cylinder drafting unit, also comprising a withdrawal roller pair 5 as well as a<br>
winding device 6.<br>
The drafting unit 4 shown comprises a front roller pair 7, to which the staple fibre<br>
strand 2 is fed in feed direction A, furthermore an apron roller pair 8, which is looped<br>
in a known way by guiding aprons 9 and 10, and comprising a delivery roller pair 11,<br>
at which the drafting zone 29 of the drafting unit 4 ends. A staple fibre strand 2 is<br>
drafted in the known way in the drafting unit 4 to the desired degree of fineness.<br>
The delivery roller pair 11 comprises a driven bottom roller 32 as well as a pressure<br>
roller 12 and is connected to devices 13 for opening and closing the delivery roller<br>
pair 11. The open position of the pressure roller 12 is denoted by a broken line at 12'.<br>
The air-jet aggregate 3 comprises a feed channel 33, to which the drafted, but as yet<br>
twist-free staple fibre strand 2 is fed for receiving its spinning twist. The air-jet<br><br>
aggregate 3 comprises further a yarn withdrawal channel 14 for the spun yarn 1. In<br>
the inside of the air-jet aggregate 3, compressed air jets 15 are arranged, whose<br>
outlet openings lead into a vortex chamber 16, in which the actual twist application<br>
takes place, as, for example, is described in the above mentioned European<br>
published patent application 12 19 737. The yarn withdrawal channel 14 is hereby<br>
located in a stationary, spindle-like component 17. The spinning direction is denoted<br>
by the letter B.<br>
Between the air-jet aggregate 3 and the withdrawal roller pair 5, an end-break<br>
detector 18 is arranged, whose function is described below.<br>
Downstream of the withdrawal roller pair 5 the winding device 6 is arranged, which<br>
comprises a take-up roller 21, by means of which during operation a crosswound<br>
bobbin 22 is driven by friction, onto which the spun yarn 1 is wound. This is<br>
supported by a traversing device (not shown) for the yarn 1 which is located directly<br>
upstream of the take-up roller 21.<br>
When the spinning arrangement is started up and accelerated from a standstill, it can<br>
happen, when the crosswound bobbin 22 has reached a certain volume, that the<br>
momentary transport speed of the thread 1 is somewhat lower there than at the<br>
withdrawal roller pair 5 due to the slip at the take-up roller 21. In this case, a yarn<br>
loop 20 forms during the acceleration phase, which is then temporarily taken up in a<br>
yarn reservoir 19. As during operation the take-up roller 21 is driven at a very slightly<br>
higher speed than the yarn 1 withdrawn by the withdrawal roller pair 5 in withdrawal<br>
direction C, the loop 20 can straighten out again during operation or during a phase<br>
of constant transport of the yarn 1.<br>
A first drive motor 23 is provided for the drive of the delivery roller pair 11 as well as<br>
for the withdrawal roller pair 5, so that these roller pairs 11,5 are always jointly<br>
driven, however at very slightly differing speeds, which ensures a desired tension of<br>
the yarn 1.<br>
The front roller pair 7 and the apron roller pair 8 of the drafting unit 4 is driven by a<br>
joint second drive motor 24. That the apron roller pair 8 must rotate significantly<br>
faster than the front roller pair 7 should be taken into consideration here, as in this<br>
area the pre-draft of the staple fibre strand 2 takes place.<br><br>
A separate drive motor 25 for the take-up roller 21 is provided.<br>
For the following description of the two-stage start-up of the second drive motor 24, a<br>
control device 26 is provided, for the first drive motor 23 and the motor 25 a further<br>
control system 28 is provided. These will be described in more detail below.<br>
The control device 26 is connected to the second drive motor 24 and the end-break<br>
detector 18, while the other control system 28 is connected to the first drive motor 23,<br>
the drive motor 25 and the end-break detector 18. In addition there is in the area of<br>
the delivery roller pair 11 a sensor 27 (to be described below), which sensor 27 is<br>
also connected electrically to the control device 26. The control device 26 and the<br>
control system 28 control the drive motors 23,24 and 25 connected thereto in such a<br>
way that they start up in two stages, that is, initially to a constant intermediate speed<br>
and subsequently to their operational speed.<br>
Certain circumstances, for example an end break, cause the normal spinning<br>
process to be interrupted. In such a case, the interrupted spinning process must be<br>
re-started.<br>
In order that, in the case of an end break, no further staple fibre strand 2 is fed to the<br>
drafting unit 4 and the take-up roller 21 does not continue to turn unnecessarily,<br>
which would unnecessarily press in the thread layer on the crosswound bobbin 22, it<br>
is provided - controlled by the end break detector 18 - that via the control device 26<br>
and the control system 28 the first drive motor 23 as well as the second drive motor<br>
24 and the motor 25 for the take-up roller 21 are brought to a standstill. The<br>
sequence is such that the staple fibre strand 2 between the front roller pair 7 and the<br>
apron roller pair 8 does not tear, but rather remains threaded into the respective<br>
nipping points, and that the staple fibre strand 2, however, between the guiding<br>
aprons 9,10 and the delivery roller pair 11 does tear. In order to start up the spinning<br>
arrangement again, a piece of the already spun thread 1, denoted here by the<br>
reference number 31, must be manually or automatically moved a short distance<br>
through the air-jet aggregate 3 so that the end 30 of the thread 31 to be pieced can<br>
be reconnected to the staple fibre strand 2 still located in the drafting unit 4. The end<br>
30 is hereby prepared for the piecing process, that is cut off and opened to a kind of<br>
fibre brush, which facilitates the piecing process. In order to feed back this thread 31,<br>
the pressure roller 12 of the delivery roller pair 11 can be opened by means of the<br>
device 13 into the position 12'.<br><br>
The subsequent process for re-starting the spinning process is described in more detail below with the aid<br>
of Figures 6 and 7. It need only be said at this point that during the piecing process, the staple fibre strand<br>
2 and the thread 1 have, in relation to the operational speed, a reduced and constant transport speed.<br>
Firstly a description of the preparation of the end 30 of the thread 31 is given with the aid of Figures 2. 3<br>
and 4:<br>
According to Figure 2. first of all the pressure roller 12 (shown in Fig. 1) is raised from the bottom roller 32<br>
into the position 12'. At the same time, the feed channel 33 (shown in Fig.1) is swivelled into the position<br>
33'. After the area of the vortex chamber 16 and other components of the air-jet aggregate 3 have been<br>
cleaned, the thread 31 to be pieced is then transported back into the shown position and cut off to a suitable<br>
length L for the purposes of the piecing process. In addition, the end 30 of the thread 31 is opened to form a<br>
thread brush with means not shown. These advantageous measures for the piecing process are not part of<br>
the present invention. At this point in time, all rollers, that is the front roller pair 7, the apron roller pair 8<br>
and naturally also the delivery roller pair 11. the withdrawal roller pair 5 as well as the take-up roller 21 are<br>
at a standstill. The first piece 34 of the broken off staple fibre strand 2 projects out from the guiding aprons<br>
9, 10. where the end -break took place.<br>
According to Figure 3, the thread 31 prepared for the piecing process is now fed back through the sensor<br>
27,so that the sensor 27 is located between the end 30 of the thread 31 and the delivery roller pair 11 which<br>
is closed again. The first drive motor 23 and also the motor 25 for the take-up roller 21 (shown in Fig. 1)<br>
can now be started up via the control system 28 (shown in Fig. 1). The motors 23 and 25 are accelerated<br>
however only up to the above mentioned intermediary speed and then held constant for a pre-determincd<br>
length of time at this speed. The motor 24 for the front roller pair 7 and the apron roller pair 8 remains at<br>
this point at a standstill.<br>
When the end 30 of the thread 31 has passed the sensor 27 as shown in Figure 4. the second drive motor 24<br>
(shown in Fig. 1) is switched on via the control device 26 (shown in Fig. 1) after a short delay, so that the<br>
first piece 34 of the staple fibre strand 2 is again fed to the delivery roller pair 11. The second motor 24 is<br>
also held at a constant intermediary speed. The control system is so designed, that the end 30 of the thread<br>
31 touches the staple fibre strand 2 in the area of the nipping point of the delivery roller<br>
pair II and is pieced together therewith. Only then is the first drive motor 23. the second drive<br><br>
motor 24 as well as the motor 25 for the take-up roller 21 driven up to operational<br>
speed by means of the control device 26 and the control system 28.<br>
The piecing process is carried in such a way that during piecing, the staple fibre<br>
strand 2 and the thread 31 (corresponds to the thread 1 during operation) have, in<br>
relation to the operational speed, a reduced and constant transport speed.<br>
With the aid of the diagram in Figure 6, the piecing process is described in more<br>
detail below:<br>
On the ordinate the transport speed v is given ( it could also be the number of<br>
revolutions of the drive motor) and on the abscisse the time t in connection with the<br>
piecing process of an end 30 of the thread 31 to the staple fibre strand 2 is given.<br>
The reference number v1, refers to the transport speed of the delivery roller pair 11,<br>
the reference number v2 refers to the transport speed of the apron roller pair 8. The<br>
additional index A denotes the respective piecing speed, the additional index B the<br>
respective operational speed. v1A is thus the transport speed of the delivery roller pair<br>
11 during piecing, v1B is its operational speed. Accordingly, V2A is the piecing speed of<br>
the apron roller pair 8, V2B is its speed. It can be seen that the piecing speeds v1A and<br>
v2A are reduced but constant in comparison to the operational speeds v1B and v2B.<br>
The point at which the end 30 of the thread 31 passes the sensor 27 is denoted by ts.<br>
After a short delay, the second drive motor 24 of the drafting unit 4 is started at time<br>
t2, so that the first piece 34 of the staple fibre strand 2 can be fed to the thread 31.<br>
The length L has been accordingly measured. The point in time tA denotes the<br>
moment of the actual piecing. The reduced and constant transport speeds for the<br>
fibre strand 2 and the thread 1 or 31 must be reached exactly at the time tA.<br>
Below a modification of Figure 1 is shown with the aid of Figure 5:<br>
According to Figure 5, there is a particular form of piecing in which the fibre current of<br>
the re-fed staple fibre strand 2 coming from the delivery pair 11 is at first fed as trash<br>
36 in suction direction D as a fibre current deflection to suction tube 35, or is<br>
deflected by other means. This suction tube 35 can be located between the delivery<br>
roller pair 11 and the feed channel 33, or alternatively, as shown by a broken line and<br>
35' and D', inside the air-jet aggregate 3.<br><br>
When the end 30 of the thread 31 is recognized by the sensor 27, or is alternatively<br>
controlled by a time control device, the deflected fibre current is no longer deflected<br>
after a certain time delay and the air-jet aggregate 3 is made operational again by<br>
switching on the compressed air stream. Because of the fibre current deflection,<br>
there is no dependency on the acceleration pattern of the second drive motor 24 any<br>
more and thus very short piecing times can be realized.<br>
This modification according to Figure 5 is explained below with the aid of the diagram<br>
in Figure 7:<br>
Here the transport speed v is also given on the time t. As already explained in Figure<br>
6, the index 1 refers respectively to the delivery roller pair 11, while the index 2 refers<br>
respectively to the apron roller pair 8. The index A refers to the transport speed during<br>
piecing, the index B to the transport speed during normal operation. With the aid of<br>
Figure 7, it can be seen that in the case of the explained modification the first drive<br>
motor 23 and the second drive motor 24 could be started up at the same time.<br>
Controlled hereby, either by the sensor 27 or another control device, is the moment<br>
of the end of the fibre current deflection, namely that the fibre current is no longer<br>
removed as trash 36, but rather joined up with the end 30 of the thread 31.<br>
In Figure 7 a curve 37 is shown after the piecing time tA, which illustrates a thin place<br>
compensation. Thus it is possible, directly after the piecing process, to increase the<br>
speed of the second drive motor 24 for a short time before it is finally driven to its<br>
operational speed v2B.<br><br>

5.	A process according to claim 4, wherein the staple fibre strand is<br>
temporarily removed as trash between the delivery roller pair and the<br>
air-jet aggregate.<br>
6.	A process according to claim 4, wherein the staple fibre strand is<br>
temporarily drawn off as trash in the air-jet aggregate.<br>
7.	A process according to any one of the claims 4 to 6, wherein -<br>
preferably by means of detection of the position of the end of the<br>
thread by a sensor - the removal as trash ends, causing the<br>
operational spinning process to be re-started.<br>
8.	A process according to any one of the claims 1 to 7, wherein directly<br>
after the piecing process, the fed amount of fibres is increased for a<br>
short time to balance out thin thread places.<br><br>
9.	A spinning arrangement comprising an air-jet aggregate (3) and a<br>
drafting unit (4) for restarting an interrupted spinning process by<br>
means of piecing a thread end to a drafted staple fibre strand,<br>
comprising a delivery roller pair (11) bordering the drafting zone (29)<br>
of a drafting unit (4) to which delivery roller pair a first drive motor<br>
(23) is arranged, comprising further drafting unit roller pairs<br>
arranged upstream of the above mentioned delivery roller pair, to<br>
which further drafting roller pairs a joint second drive motor (24) is<br>
arranged, also comprising means (13) for opening and closing the<br>
delivery roller pair (11) also comprising a sensor for detecting a<br>
prepared end of an already spun thread which has been placed in the<br>
opened delivery roller pair and subsequently transported in spinning<br>
direction by the delivery roller pair which is now closed again, and also<br>
comprising controlling means (26) connected with the sensor (27) and<br>
the second drive motor, characterized in that, in the moment of<br>
piecing of the end (30) of the thread (31) to the staple fibre strand<br>
(2), the first drive motor (23) and the second drive motor (24) run at<br>
reduced and constant speeds in relation to their operational speeds.<br>
10.	An arrangement according to claim 9, wherein the first drive motor<br>
(23) additionally to the delivery roller pair (11) is at the same time<br>
arranged to a withdrawal roller pair (5) which removes the spun<br>
thread (1) from the air-jet aggregate (3).<br><br>
11.	An arrangement according to claim 10, wherein a yarn reservoir (19) is<br>
arranged downstream of the withdrawal roller pair (5) during the<br>
start-up of the first drive motor (23) to the piecing speed, which yarn<br>
reservoir (19) takes up a yarn loop (20), and which yarn reservoir (19)<br>
can be emptied during the phase of the constant piecing speed.<br>
12.	An arrangement according to any one of claims 9 to 11, wherein a<br>
deflecting device (35) for removing the transported staple fibre<br>
strand (2) temporarily as trash (36) is arranged to the delivery roller<br>
pair (11).<br>
13.	An arrangement according to any one of claims 9 to 12, wherein the<br>
start-up of the second drive motor (24), in dependence on the position<br>
of the end (30) of the detected thread (31), is delayed in relation to<br>
the start-up of the first drive motor (23).<br>
14.	An arrangement according to claim 12, wherein the first drive motor<br>
(23) and the second drive motor (24) start-up simultaneously and the<br>
deflecting device (35), in dependence on the position of the end (30)<br>
of the detected thread (31), becomes ineffective,<br><br>
15. An arrangement according to claim 14, wherein, from the first moment of the<br>
start-up, both the first drive motor (23) and the second drive motor (24) have a<br>
continuous and constant speed ratio.<br><br>
A process and an arrangement for re-starting an interrupted spinning process in a<br>
spinning arrangement comprising an air-jet aggregate and a drafting unit is<br>
described. In this process, a prepared end of a thread already spun is positioned in<br>
the area of a delivery roller pair of the drafting unit. This thread is subsequently<br>
transported in the spinning direction and joined by means of a piecing process<br>
during this transport to a staple fibre strand fed thereto by the drafting unit. The<br>
piecing process takes place dependent on the position of the thread end. During the<br>
piecing process, the staple fibre strand and the thread each have a constant<br>
transport speed which is lower than the operational speed.</td>
