Figure-2 shows the spool loading arrangement according to the invention.<br>
Figure-3 shows the spool indexing mechanism of the lap package production machine according to the invention.<br>
Figure-4 shows the spool lifter arrangement of the lap package production machine according to the invention.<br>
Figure-5 shows lap trolley according to the invention.<br>
Embodiments of the invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
Referring to Figure 1 and 2, the spool magazine (1) is housed in the spool lifter assembly. The spool loading arrangement comprising a pneumatically operated spool loading cylinder (2) rigidly fitted on the wall of the spool lifter assembly and a pushing plate assembly (3) is rigidly mounted on the piston of the spool loading cylinder (2)<br><br>
A lap trolley (TR) shown is figure 5 is employed to carry the spools as well as the laps produced by the lap package production machine. The said lap trolley (TR) carrying the spools is attached to the lap package production machine to supply the spools to the lap package production machine. Also the laps produced by the lap package production machine is deposited on the said lap trolley (TR) which is subsequently moved and attached to the Combing machine to supply the laps to the combing machine.<br>
Referring to figures 2 and 5, the spool loading arrangement is housed in the lap trolley (TR). The said lap trolley (TR) consisting of a rack (4) which slides smoothly inside a guide means provided in the rack housing (5). The rack is held under load by a compression spring (6). A pinion (7) which is rotateably mounted on a spool holder drive shaft (8). The pinion (7) is rigidly connected to a spool swivel tray (9). The above configuration is such that the spool swivel tray (9) can swing about the axis of the pinion (7) when the same is activated by the rack (4).<br>
During the doffing cycle, the spool loading cylinder (2) is actuated by electro pneumatic means and the piston along with the pushing plate assembly (3) moves forward, and pushes the rack (4). The pinion (7) rotates the swivel tray (9) in clock-wise direction to an angle sufficient to deposit empty spool (S), loaded on the swivel tray (9) on the spool magazine (1) through the opening provided. After that the piston of spool loading cylinder (2) moves backward to its home position. The pressure exerted by the spring (6) pushes the rack (4) and operates the pinion (7) such that the spool swivel tray retains its normal horizontal position and is ready to receive further empty spool.   The lap lifter assembly also provided with a<br><br>
spool indexing means for regulating the movement of the spool from the spool magazine. Spool index cylinder (10) is operated to effect backward movement of the piston attached to it. Rollers (14, 15) attached to an index arm (12) which is pivoted at pivot point (11) assumes a position such that a lap spool (S) held between the rollers (14, 15) is allowed to drop into spool changer assembly. During this process the roller (15) assumes a position to prevent further flow of empty spool present in the spool magazine (1).<br>
When spool index cylinder (10) is operated to effect the forward movement of the piston attached to it, the rollers (14, 15) attached to the index arm (12) assumes a position such that one lap spool present in the spool magazine is allowed to travel upto the gap between rollers (14, 15) for subsequent delivery on to the spool lifter assembly during the next doffing cycle. For the purpose of gentle positioning of the lap spools (S) between the lap discs, a spool changer mechanism is used. The empty spool form the spool magazine (1) regulated by the indexing mechanism is allowed to drop on the spool holder assembly. The spool lifter assembly also provided with spool holder assembly comprises a spool holder bottom (16) and a spool holder cylinder (17) rigidly connected to a spool changer lever (18). Spool holder top (19) is connected to the spool holder bottom (16) by a hinge. Spool holder top (19) is also provided with a connecting means and fitted to the hinge head (20) attached to the piston of the spool holder cylinder (17) such that the lap spool (S) can be gripped firmly between the spool holder halves, when the spool holder cylinder (17) is pneumatically actuated.<br><br>
The spool lifter assembly is held swingably through hinge pins (21). The spool lifter assembly is hinged in the frame of the machine. A lever (22) is rigidly connected to the hinge pin (21). Connecting means (22a) is provided on the other side of the lever (22) and is operably connected to the spool lifting cylinder. By actuating the spool lifting cylinder by electro pneumatic means, the spool lifter assembly is lifted about the hinge pin (21) and held at a position such that the axis of the lap spool present is parallel to the axis of the lap discs. Separate means is provided for subsequent holding of the lap spool in between the lap disc for lap build up. Soon after gripping of the lap spool by the lap discs, the spool holder cylinder is actuated by electro pneumatic means and spool holder halves opens apart. And also the spool lifting cylinder is actuated by electro pneumatic means and the spool changer assembly with the spool holder halves in open condition reaches its home position and is ready to receive the next empty spool from the magazine.<br>
The invention provides a simple and cost effective means for the transfer of the lap (L) from a lap trolley (TR) to the comber. The lap holding zone of the lap trolley (TR) comprises a fixed beam (23) rigidly connected to the side walls of the lap trolley (TR), and a front beam (23a). Supports (24,25) are rigidly fitted to the bottom of the front beam (23a). One end of the lap lock (26) is pivoted to the support (24) through beam pin (27). On the other end of lap lock (26), one end of the lever link pin (28) is rigidly fitted such that, the axes of the lever lock pin and beam pin (27) are parallel to each other. Other end of the lever link pin (28) passes through the radial slot provided on the side wall of the lap trolley (TR). The dimensions of the radial slot is selected to allow the smooth radial movement of the lever link<br><br>
pin (28) passing through it. A lap lock lever (29) is pivotally rigidly connected to the other end of the lever link pin (28). Other end of the lap lock lever (29) is hinged to the side wall of the lap trolley (TR). One end of a gas spring (30) is hinged to the support (25) and the other end of the gas spring is hinged to the side wall of the lap trolley (TR). Similar arrangement is provided on the other side of the front beam also. The lap (L) rest partially on the fixed beam (23) and partially on the front beam (23a). The load exerted by the lap (L) on the front beam (23a) acts on the lap lock (26) and the liver link pin (28) rigidly connected to the lap lock (26) which rests on the top most position of the radial slot. At this position, the lap package is held by the front beam (23a).<br>
To effect transfer of the lap package from the lap trolley (TR) to the comber, the lap lock levers (29) are lifted simultaneously in upward direction by an actuating mechanism provided in the comber. The lap lock (26) with liver lock pin (28) resting in the radial slot provided on the side wall of the lap trolley (TR), slides to the bottom most position of the radial slot resulting in the swinging of the front beam (23a). By this means the front beam (23a) is no more holding the lap and the lap (L) is deposited to the combing heads of the comber. After the release of lap, the front beam (23a) is lifted to its home position by the pressure exerted by the gas spring (30).<br><br><br>
