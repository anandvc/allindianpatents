3.   PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is  to be performed : -<br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to organofunctional silanes and mixtures of organorunctional silanes possessing mercaptan and blocked mercaptan functionality.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
Glycol derivatives of organosilanes are known in the art. However, these silane derivatives suffer from a tendency to yield bridged structures in favor of cyclic structures exclusively or primarily, leading to high viscosities and gellation, which limits their usefulness in elastomer manufacture.<br>
Polyether-based monol derivatives of sulfur silanes are also known. Their use suffers from the hazards associated with the use of ethers, which have a tendency to spontaneously form peroxides thus presenting a substantial flamrnability risk, as well as the possibility of interfering with the usefulness of the silanes as coupling agents in elastomers.<br>
Blocked mercaptosilanes, such as thiocarboxylate-functional silanes, are described, e.g., in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,127,468, 6,414,06 land 6,528,673. A presentation on the subject of blocked mercaptosilanes was also given at the 2002 International Tire Exposition and Conference (ITEC) in Akron, Ohio. The blocked mercaptosilanes of these patents possess hydrolyzable groups which are derived from simple monofunctional alcohols. When employed as coupling agents for rubber compositions used in the manufacture of tires, the thiocarboxalate-functional silanes of U.S. Patent Nos. 6,127,468, 6414,061 and 6,528,673 allow tires to be manufactured with fewer steps. However, during the rubber compounding operation, these blocked mercaptosilanes generate volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions.<br>
This concern regarding VOC emissions, which represents a growing environmental problem in the use of silane coupling agents is addressed, by the cyclic diol-derived blocked organofunctional dimeric and oligomeric silanes described in published U.S. Patent Application 2005/0245753 and U.S. patent application Serial Nos. 11/104,103, filed April 12, 2005, and 11/208,367, filed August 19, 2005. Another approach to the issue of VOC emissions is the use of high boiling monofunctional alcohol-derived silanes as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,849,754.<br>
In addition to the need to reduce VOC's during the preparation of inorganic filled elastomers, there is also a need to improve the coupling efficiency between the inorganic filler and organic polymer while maintaining processability of the elastomeric compositions. Better coupling improves the performance of cured articles, such as tires, by reducing rolling resistance, heat build-up and wear. U.S. Patent No. 6,635,700 describes the use of a mixture of free and blocked mercaptosilanes to achieve better coupling. However, these mixtures emit VOC's upon use. The level of mercaptosilane in these mixtures is limited because this<br>
2<br><br>
additive reduces the scorch time of the uncured filled elastomer, hi an attempt to lengthen the scorch time of uncured filled elastomers containing mercaptosilanes, published U.S. Patent Application 2004/0014840 discloses the use of thiuram disulfide accelerators in combination with functionalized organosilane.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The  present  invention  is  directed  to  an  organofunctional  silane  composition<br>
comprising at least one organofunctional silane selected from the group consisting<br>
of:<br>
(i) mercaptosilane possessing at least one hydroxyalkoxysilyl group and/or a cyclic dialkoxysilyl group,<br>
(ii) blocked mercaptosilane possessing at least one hydroxyalkoxysilyl group and/or a cyclic dialkoxysilyl group,<br>
(iii) mercaptosilane dimer in which the silicon atoms of the mercaptosilane units are bonded to each other through a bridging dialkoxy group, each silane unit optionally possessing at least one hydroxyalkoxysilyl group or a cyclic dialkoxysilyl group,<br>
(iv) blocked mercaptosilane dimer in which the silicon atoms of the blocked mercaptosilane units are bonded to each other through a bridging dialkoxy group, each silane unit optionally possessing at least one hydroxyalkoxysilyl group or a cyclic dialkoxysilyl group,<br>
(v) silane dimer possessing a mercaptosilane unit the silicon atom of which is bonded to the silicon atom of a blocked mercaptosilane unit through a bridging dialkoxy group, each silane unit optionally possessing at least one hydroxyalkoxysilyl group or a cyclic dialkoxysilyl group,<br>
(vi) mercaptosilane oligomer in which the silicon atoms of adjacent mercaptosilane units are bonded to each other through a bridging dialkoxy group, the terminal mercaptosilane units possessing at least one hydroxyalkoxysilyl group or a cyclic dialkoxysilyl group,<br>
(vii) blocked mercaptosilane oligomer in which the silicon atoms of adjacent blocked mercaptosilane units are bonded to each other through a bridging dialkoxy group, the terminal mercaptosilane units possessing at least one hydroxyalkoxysilyl group or a cyclic dialkoxysilyl group, and<br>
(viii) silane oligomer possessing at least one mercaptosilane unit and at least one blocked mercaptosilane unit, the silicon atoms of adjacent silane units being bonded to each other through a bridging dialkoxy group, the terminal silane units possessing at least one hydroxyalkoxysilyl group or a cyclic dialkoxysilyl group,<br>
with the provisio that,<br>
where the composition contains one or more of (i), (iii) and (vi), the composition additionally contains one or more of (ii), (iv), (v), (vii) and (viii), and where the composition contains one or more of (ii), (iv) and (vii), the composition additionally contains one or more of (i), (iii), (v), (vi) and (viii).<br>
3<br><br>
Organofunctional silanes (i)-(viii) and/or their mixtures, supra, can be prepared by the transesterification of at least one mercaptosilane, blocked mercaptosilane or mixture of mercaptosilane(s) and blocked mercaptosilane(s) with at least one polyhydroxy-containing compound, part or all of the transesterified reaction product(s) thereafter being optionally treated, e.g., in a deblocking operation to convert blocked mercaptan functionality if present to free mercaptan functionality or in an esterification operation to convert free mercaptan functionality if present to blocked mercaptan functionality.<br>
As will be appreciated from the foregoing, the composition of this invention can include one or more silane dimers and/or oligomers in which adjacent silane units are bonded to each other through bridged dialkoxysilane structures derived from poiyhydroxy-containing compounds,, e.g., diols (glycols), triols, tetrols, etc., all of which are low volatile organic compounds (VOCs) relative to simple monohydroxy-containing compounds such as methanol and ethanol which are released by known mercaptosilanes, blocked mercaptosilanes and/or polystflflde silanes.<br>
It will also be appreciated that all of the compositions within the scope of the invention contain both mercapto- and blocked mercapto- functionalities, either present in the same silane or in mixtures of individual silanes. While it is known that silanes possessing exclusively mercaptan functionality are prone to scorchiness, it has come as a surprise that the compositions of this invention which possess both mercaptan and blocked mercaptan functionalities possess long scorch times, e.g., approaching those of silanes possessing exclusively blocked mercaptan, but with significantly better performance than the latter.<br>

The organofunctional silane compositions of this invention that contain cyclic and/or bridging silyl groups and both free and blocked mercaptan groups normally have a random distribution of free and blocked mercapto groups within the individual silane. However, silanes in accordance with the invention can be prepared in which the free and -blocked mercaptan groups are segregated. This segregation will result in compositions where the nearest neighbors to a free mercaptan group are other free mercaptan groups or the nearest neighbors to a blocked mercaptan group are other blocked mercaptan groups. The segregation of the free and blocked mercaptan groups can occur when blocked mercaptofunctional cyclic and bridged silanes are physically mixed with free mercaptofunctional cyclic and bridged silanes.<br>
Moreover, it is understood that these novel silane compositions can also contain free and blocked mercaptofunctional silane components that contain only monofunctional alkoxy groups. These free and blocked mercaptofunctional silanes containing only monofunctional alkoxy groups maybe used as reagents in the preparation of the novel silanes of the present invention. However, it is understood that these monofunctional alkoxy groups may contribute to VOC emissions during use. Moreover, it is understood that the partial hydrolyzates and/or condensates of these cyclic and bridging dialkoxy blocked mercaptofunctional silanes (i.e., cyclic and bridging dialkoxy blocked mercaptofunctional siloxanes and/or silanols) may also be encompassed by the silanes herein, in that these partial hydrolyzates and/or condensates will be a side product of most methods of manufacture of the novel silanes of the present invention or can occur upon storage, especially in humid conditions, or under conditions in which residual water remaining from their preparation is not completely removed subsequent to their preparation.<br>
20<br><br>
Furthermore, partial to substantial hydrolysis of silanes (10) and (11) will form novel silanes that contain siloxane bonds, i.e., Zb = (-0-)o.5, and are encompassed by the silanes described herein. They can be deliberately prepared by incorporating the appropriate stoichiometry or an excess of water into the methods of preparation described herein for the silanes. Silane structures herein encompassing hydrolyzates and siioxanes are described in the structures represented by Formulae (10) and (11) wherein the subscripts, V, of Zb = (-O-)o.5 and/or u of X = OH are substantive (i.e., substantially larger than zero). In one embodiment of the present invention, the ratio of siloxane bridging group, (-0-)o.5, to dioxy bridging group, [-0(R0CR0)fO-]o.5, is within a range of from about 0 to about 1. In another embodiment, the ratio is within a range of from about 0 to about 0.2.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the organofunctional silanes herein, including their mixtures, can be loaded on a particulate carrier such as a porous polymer, carbon black, a siliceous material such as or silica, etc., so that they are in solid form for addition to rubber in a rubber compounding operation.<br>
Organofunctional silanes (10) and (11) herein and mixtures thereof can be prepared by the general preparative process described above of which there are numerous specific embodiments. Generally, the process embodiments for making one or a mixture of silanes (10) and (11) involve a transesterification reaction between one or more alkoxysilane formulae (1), (2) and (3) and one or more polyhydroxy-containing compounds of formula (6).<br>
In one embodiment, the process for preparing the organofunctional silanes (10)<br>
and/or (11) comprises:<br>
a.) transesterifying at least one blocked mercaptofunctional silane:<br>
.or <br>
wherein each occurrence of G1, G2, R, Y, X, a, b, c,j, k, p ,q, r, and s are defined supra, and with the proviso that at least one of X is a hydrolyzable group, with at least one diol having the structure HO(R0CR0)/DH, optionally in the presence of a transesterification catalyst; and,<br>
b) partially removing blocking groups, e.g., by the addition of a strong base, to provide free mercaptan groups.<br>
The first reaction can be carried out by reacting a mixture of blocked mercaptofunctional alkoxy silane and a diol at a molar ratio of about 0.1 mole to about 3.0 moles of diol per 1 mole of silyl group to be transesterified. In another embodiment, the ratio can range from about 1.0 to about 2.5 for a trialkoxysilyl<br>
21<br><br>
group. The reaction can be carried out at a temperature ranging from about 0 to about 150°C and all subranges therebetween while maintaining a pressure in the range of from about 0.1 to about 2000 mm Hg absolute. In one embodiment, the temperature can range from about 30°C to about 90°C and all subranges therebetween. In another embodiment, the pressure can range from about 1 to about 80 mm Hg absolute. As those skilled in the art will recognize, excess diol can be utilized to increase reaction rate, but it is not necessary under these conditions as it may increase the cost. The reaction can be carried out by slowly adding diol to the blocked.mercaptofunctional alkoxysilane at the desired reaction temperature and vacuum. As the lower boiling mono alcohol is formed, it can be removed from the reaction mixture by a distillation cycle. Removal of the mono alcohol helps drive the reaction to completion. The reactions optionally can be catalyzed using a transesterification catalyst. Suitable tranesterification catalysts are strong protic acids whose pKa are below 5.0, transition metal complexes such as complexes of tin, iron, titanium and. other metal catalysts. Catalysts suitable for these reaction are disclosed in, "The Siloxane Bond, Physical Properties and Chemical Transformations'1, M. G. Voronkov, V. P. Mileshkevich and Yu. A. Yuzhelevskii, Consultants Bureau, a division of Plenum Publishing Company, New York (1978), Chapter 5 and are included by reference herein. Strong bases are generally unsuitable as transesterification catalysts since they promote the reaction of the blocked mercaptofunctional group with the diol and result in removal of the blocking group. The acid or metal catalysts can be used at a range of about 10 ppm to about 2 weight percent.<br>
After the transesterification reaction has reached completion, a strong base may be added to partially remove blocking groups. In one embodiment, suitable bases are those with a pKb below 5.0 including, but not limited to, metal alkoxides, amides (-NR2), mercaptides and carbonates wherein the metal ion is lithium, sodium or potassium. The amount of blocking group that is removed is dependent upon the amount of base added. It is understood that the strong base will first neutralize any protic acids that were used in the transesterification reaction of the alkoxysilyl groups. Therefore, additional base in excess of that amount needed to remove the desired amount of blocking group will be required to first complete this neutralization and then remove the blocking group to the desired level. In one embodiment, the amount of additional base added is in a range of from about 0.0005 to about 0.05 molar equivalents to the blocked mercapto group. In another embodiment, about 0.001 to about 0.01 molar equivalents of base are added.<br>
After the blocking group has been partially removed, the final mixture can optionally be buffered. Buffering the mixture will inhibit further removal of blopking groups and will thus add to long-term product stability.<br>
The products of the transesterification of blocked mercaptofunctional silane can comprise a considerable fraction of monomelic material in addition to the formation of dimers and other cyclic and bridged oligomers as illustrated by low viscosity reaction products.<br>
22<br><br>
The process for making the organofunctional silane compositions of the invention can optionally employ an inert solvent. The solvent may serve as a diluent; carrier, stabilizer, refluxing aid or heating agent. Generally, any inert solvent that does not enter into the reaction or adversely affect the preparative process can be used. In one embodiment, the solvents are liquid under normal conditions and have a boiling point below about 150°C. Examples of suitable solvents include aromatic, hydrocarbon, ether, aprotic, or chlorinated hydrocarbon solvents such as toluene, xylene, hexane, butane, diethyl ether, dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, carbon tetrachloride, methylene chloride, and the like.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the process of transesterifying the alkoxysilane with diol can be conducted continuously. In the case of a continuous operation, the process comprises:<br>
a)	reacting, in a thin film reactor, a thin film reaction medium comprising at least one silane of Formula 5, at least one diol and, optionally, transesterification catalyst, to provide blocked mercaptosilane that contains a cyclic and/or bridged dialkoxy group, and by-product mono alcohol;<br>
b)	vaporizing by-product mono alcohol from the thin film to drive the reaction;<br>
c)	optionally, recovering by-product mono alcohol by condensation;<br>
d)	partially removing blocking groups by the addition of base;<br>
e)	optionally, removing by-products of the deblocking step;<br>
f)	recovering the organofunctional silane reaction product(s); and,<br>
g)	optionally, neutralizing the reaction medium to improve the storage stability of the organofunctional silane product(s) therein.<br>
The molar ratio of diol to blocked mercaptofunctional alkoxy silane used in the continuous thin film process will depend upon the number of alkoxy groups that are desired to be replaced with a diol group. Theoretically, a molar ratio of about 0.5 moles of diol is required per alkoxy-silyl group to be transesterified. For a trialkoxy silane" the stoichiometric equivalent molar ratio is about 1, wherein one diol replaces two alkoxy groups. However, in many cases, only one of the hydroxyl groups oi the diol reacts with the alkoxysilyl group. These diols are defined as.X in Formulae (10) and (11). The diols, referred to herein as "hydroxyalkoxy", reduce the viscosity and inhibit the gelation of the silane. As one skilled in the art will readily recognize, excess diol can be utilized to increase reaction rates.<br>
The method of forming the film can be any of those known in the art. Typical known devices include but are not limited to, falling film or wiped film evaporators. Minimum film thickness and flow rates will depend on the minimum wetting rate for the film forming surface. Maximum film thickness and flow rates will depend on the flooding point for the film and device. The alcohol is vaporized from the film by heating the film, by reducing pressure over the film, or by a combination of both. In one embodiment, mild heating and reduced pressure are utilized to form the structures of this invention. Optimal temperatures and pressures (partial vacuum) for running this process will depend upon the specific blocked mercapto functional<br>
23<br><br>
silane's alkoxy groups and the diol used in the process. Additionally if an optional inert solvent is used in the process, that choice will affect the optimal temperatures and pressures (partial vacuum) utilized. Examples of such solvents include those listed above.<br>
The by-product alcohol vaporized from the film is removed from the reactive distillation device by a standard partial vacuum-forming device and can be condensed, collected, and recycled as feed to other processes. The silane product is recovered by standard means from the reactive distillation device as a liquid phase. If an inert solvent has been used or if additional purification is necessary, the silane product may be fed to another similar distillation device or distillation column to effect that separation.<br>
The addition of the base should occur after the transesterification reaction between the diol and silane is complete. In one embodiment, this reaction can occur dn a separate reaction vessel, so that the base does not neutralize the transesterification catalyst or catalyze the removal of the blocking group. The transesterified intermediate product can be continuous by transferred to a second reaction vessel, e.g., by use of a transfer line and gravity, reduced or elevated pressure, or 8 mechanical pump, to facilitate the process. In the second vessel, the deblocking reaction can occur by the addition of base.<br>
Optionally the transesterified reaction products can be neutralized to improve product storage.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, a process for preparing the organofunctional silanes containing both free and blocked mercaptan groups comprises:<br>
a) mixing at least one blocked mercaptofunctiona! silane of chemical structure:<br><br>
with a merc^tofoncdorial-sUarie of chemical formula<br>
  '•-.   -       0)<br>
wherein each occurrence of G1, G2, R, Y, X,a, b, c,j, k, p, q, r, and s is as defined above and with the proviso that at least one of X is a hydrolyzable group;<br>
b)	reacting the silane mixture from step (a) with a diol HO(R0CR0)(OH wherein/and R° are as defined above; optionally in the presence of transesterii'ication catalyst;<br>
c)	removing by-product mono alcohol; and,<br>
d)	optionally, neutralizing protonic transesterification catalyst, if utilized, with a<br>
base.<br>
24<br><br>
The reaction conditions for transesterification of the mixture of free and blocked mercaptofunctional silanes are described above for the blocked mercaptofunctional silane. However, after the transesterification reaction is complete, the reaction mixture can be neutralized if a pro tic catalyst is used. Neutralization of the catalyst will improve the shelf-stability of the reaction products.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the amount of blocked mercaptofunctional silane of:<br><br>
wherein each occurrence of G1, G2, R, Y, X, a, b, c,j, k, p, q, r, and s is as defined above and with the proviso that at least one of the X is a hydrolyzable group, are mixed in a molar ratio of silanes (1) and/or (2) to silane (3) in a range of from about 100:1 to about 0.2:1.<br>
In another embodiment, the molar ratios of silane (1) and/or (2) to silane (3) are in a range of from about 10: 1 to about 1:1. If a protic catalyst is used to promote the transesterification of the alkoxysilane with diol, it may be useful to neutralize the catalyst with a base to inhibit the reaction of diol with blocked mercaptan groups.<br>
However, only a stoichiometric amount of base is required to neutralize the protic catalyst. Larger amounts of base will promote the removal of blocking group.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the' process for preparing the organofunctional silane containing both free and blocked mercaptan groups comprises:<br>
a) transesterfying at least one blocked mercaptofunctional silane of:<br><br>
wherein each occurrence of G1, G2, R, Y, X, a, b, c, j, k, p, q, r, and s is as defined above, and with the proviso that at least one of X is a hydrolyzable group, with at least one diol HO(R0CR0)fOH wherein/and R0 are as defined above, optionally, in the presence of transesterification catalyst;<br>
25<br><br>
b)	optionally, removing by-product mono alcohol from the reaction mixture<br>
resulting from step (a);<br>
c)	transesterifying at least one mercaptofunctional silane of:<br>
  (3)<br>
wherein each occurrence of G2, X, r, and s is as defined above, and with the proviso that at least one of X is a hydrolyzable group, with at least one diol of structure HO.(R0CR0)/3H wherein /and R0are as defined above, optionally, in the presence of transesterif ication catalyst;<br>
d)	optionally, removing by-product mono alcohol from the reaction mixture<br>
resulting from step (c);<br>
e)	mixing product silane(s) from step (a) with product silane(s) from step (c) to<br>
provide a mixture possessing a predetermined amount of mercaptan and blocked<br>
mercaptan groups;<br>
f)	optionally, neutralizing the product mixture from step (e) with a base if a protic<br>
catalyst was utilized.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the molar ratios of the silane prepared in step a and the silane prepared in step d to form silane fare in the range of about 100:1 to about 0.2:1. In another embodiment, the molar ratios of silane from step a and silane from step d to form silane fare in a range from about 10:1 to about 1:1. It is understood that the desired ratio of blocked to free mercapto groups is determine by the mix ratio. The structure of the silane prepared may be bimodal in distribution of the free and blocked mercapto groups. The oligomers and polymers formed may have segments where the nearest neighbors of the free mercapto group are other free mercapto groups and likewise the nearest neighbors of the blocked mercapto group are other blocked mercapto groups. The distribution of free and blocked mercapto groups is therefore not random. The reaction conditions and processes for transesterifying the free and blocked mercaptofunctional silanes are given above.<br>
Further in accordance with the invention, a filled elastomer composition is provided which comprises:<br>
a)	at least one elastomer containing carbon-carbon double bonds;<br>

Also within the scope of the invention are articles of manufacture, particularly tires, made from the foregoing filled elastomer compositions. The invention offers a means for significantly reducing volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions during rubber manufacture and improving the coupling between the organic polymers and inorganic fillers.<br>
The novel organofunctional silane-based compositions described herein are useful as coupling agents between elastomeric resins (i.e., rubbers) and inorganic fillers. The organofunctional silane compositions are unique in that the high efficiency of the mercaptan group can be utilized without the detrimental side effects typically associated with the use of mercaptosilanes, such as high processing viscosity, less than desirable filler dispersion, premature curing (scorch), and odor. These benefits are obtained because the mercaptan group is part of a high boiling compound that liberates diol or ' higher polyhydroxy-containing compound upon use. The combination of free and blocked mercapto groups in this silane-based composition allow for a controlled amount of coupling to the organic polymer during the compounding of the rubber. During this non-productive mixing step, the cyclic and/or bridged alkoxysilyl groups may react with the filler and essentially only the free mercaptan groups may react with the rubber. The blocked mercaptan groups remain essentially inactive and are available to help disperse the inorganic filler during the rubber compounding operation. Thus, a controlled amount of coupling of the filler to the polymer occurs during mixing thereby minimizing the undesirable premature curing (scorch) and the associated undesirable increase in viscosity, while promoting the end-use properties such as reinforcing index, which is an indicator of wear. Thus, one can achieve better cured filled rubber properties such as a balance of high modulus and abrasion resistance, resulting from the avoidance or lessening of premature curing.<br>
The organofunctional silane-based compositions herein provide significant advantages over traditional coupling agents that have found extensive use in the rubber and tire industries. These silanes usually contain in their molecular structures three alkoxy groups, e.g., ethoxy groups, on each silicon atom, which results in the release of up to three moles of simple monohydroxy alcohol, e.g., ethanol for each silane equivalent during the rubber manufacturing process in which the silane couples to the filler. The release of simple mono alcohols is a great disadvantage because they are flammable and therefore pose a threat of fire, and because they contribute so greatly to volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions and are therefore potentially harmful to the environment.<br>
The organofunctional silane-based compositions described herein eliminate or greatly mitigate the foregoing problems by reducing volatile mono alcohol emissions to only one, less than one, and even essentially zero, moles of mono alcohol per silane equivalent. They accomplish this because the silane alkoxy groups are replaced with polyhydroxy alcohols, e.g., diol derived bridging groups, and thus -such polyhydroxy alcohols are released during the rubber manufacture process in place of much, or nearly all, of the mono alcohol released. Describing the advantages<br>
29<br><br>
of the organofunctional silanes herein with specific reference to those silanes that are prepared with diols (such advantages being realizable with polyhydroxy-containing compounds of higher hydroxyl functionality), diols, e.g., having boiling points well in excess of rubber processing temperatures, are not vaporized out of the rubber during the rubber manufacture process, as is the case, e.g., with ethanol, but are retained by the rubber where they migrate to the silica surface due to their high polarity and become hydrogen bonded to the surfaces of siliceous fillers such as silicas. The presence of diols on silica surfaces leads to further advantages not obtainable with ethanol (due to its volatility and ejection during the rubber compounding process) in the subsequent cure process, in which such presence prevents the silica surface from binding the curatives and thereby interfering with the cure. Traditional silanes not based on diols require more curatives to counter losses due to silica binding.<br>
The addition of hydrocarbon-based diols to the rubber compounding formulation prior to and/or concurrent with the addition of curatives is of advantage for the efficient utilization of the curatives, in particular, and polar substances, such as, but not limited to, amines, amides, sulfenamides, thiurams, and guanidines. Whether diols are exclusively added in the form of diol-derived silanes or as free diols in combination with the silane coupling agents, the polarity of the diols is of advantage to the rubber compounding ; process. These polar substances tend to migrate to the filler surface due to dipole interactions with the filler. This tends to make them unavailable within the organic polymer matrix, where their functions include plasticization of the filled elastomer and acceleration, or retardation, of the curing reactions. The hydrocarbon-based diols enhance the function of the curatives by interfering with their tendency to bind to the silica surface thereby forcing them into the rubber matrix to perform their function. The hydrocarbon-based diols accomplish this by themselves being very polar, and thereby by themselves binding to the filler surface, leaving less room for the curatives to bind to filler. The hydrocarbon-based diols thus act as curative displacing agents from the filler.<br>
The short chain of the hydrocarbon-based diols further enhances their function by a chelate effect, hi one embodiment, the number of carbon atoms between the hydroxide groups of Zc and/or ZP herein are important and are defined by the divalent radical -O(R0CR0)fO)-, wherein each occurrence of/is 2 or 3. These chains of two or three carbon atoms between the two OH groups of the diol promote the formation of 5- or 6- rnembered rings when both oxygen atoms bind to a common silicon atom of the silanes of Formulae (10) and (11). This dual binding to a common center, known, and referred to herein as the chelate effect, increases the amount of cyclic dialkoxysilyl group and inhibits the formation of gel. After reactions with the silica in the rubber compounding step, the diols that have been released have a high affinity to the filler because they can chelate with the metal or silicon atom on the filler surface thereby enhancing their ability to prevent the binding of the curatives to the filler.<br>
30<br><br>
The hydrocarbon-based diols used herein are superior to ether- and/or polyether-based monofunctional alcohols or difunctional alcohols (diols) because the lack of the ether functionality of the hydrocarbon based diols avoids the problems typically encountered with ethers. These problems include high toxicity, their tendency for spontaneous peroxide formation, and high chain lengths between OH groups. Spontaneous peroxide formation is a problem because it is difficult to prevent and because the peroxides represent flammability hazards. Furthermore, peroxides will decompose when heated to provide free radicals which can initiate unwanted side reactions in the rubber polymers. These side reactions include peroxide-induced cure in which polymer chains are crosslinked. This can lead to premature, excess, and variable crosslinking during or prior to cure. The excess crosslinking can lead to inferior properties in the rubber, premature crosslinking can lead to scorch, and the variability makes it hard to fabricate a reproducible rubber composition and any articles of manufacture derived thereof.<br>
The excess chain lengths of the ether-containing diols forces chelation by the two OH groups to involve ring sizes of at least about 8 atoms, which is well beyond the optimum 5 or 6, accessible to hydrocarbon based diols. Chelation involving an OH group and an ether, which would give the optimum 5 or 6 membered rings, is not as strong as chelation with the two OH groups accessible to the hydrocarbon based diols because the OH groups are less sterically hindered and because the OH groups are more active at forming hydrogen bond interactions, which are keyto binding the diols to the filler surface.<br>
An important advantage of the silanes herein is that the by-products of the silane coupling process are themselves of utility in enhancing the rubber compounding process, the value of the resulting rubber compositions, and/or any articles of manufacture employing the rubber compositions. Thus, the blocked mercaptan groups of the silanes of the present invention not only retards coupling of silane to polymer during mixing but also assists in the dispersion of the filler into the polymer during mixing by reducing the ability of the surface hydroxyl or metal oxides to form hydrogen bonds between filler particles, thereby enhancing the ease and completeness of filler dispersion and retarding the reversal of this process, namely, filler reagglomeration. Ih addition, the diols released from the silane's silicon atoms during the process of coupling to the filler are not just shed as a waste product, but perform an important follow-up function, specifically, enhancing the efficiency of the curatives, as previously described.<br>
An unexpected result of the organofunctional silanes of the present invention is the long scorch times for uncured filled elastomers containing silanes (10) and (11). The high levels of mercapto-functional groups that are present in these silanes would normally produce very short scorch times. Long scorch times are desirable because they allow the uncured rubber to be mixed with the fillers and other ingredients in a. single pass and at higher temperatures, which facilitate filler dispersion and uniform composition, without generating high and variable viscosities or partially cured compounds. Uncured filled elastomers with high viscosities are undesirable because<br>
31<br><br>
they slow down the extrusion rates and fabrication of the articles. If the uncured rubber compound is partially cured before the molding process begins, then the gel particles resulting from premature crosslinking may generate defects and negatively affect one or more of the physical properties of the cured elastomer.<br>
In use, at least one of the organofunctional silane compositions that contain cyclic and/or bridging dialkoxysilyl groups and free and blocked mercapto groups is mixed with the organic polymer before, during, or after the compounding of the filler into the organic polymer. In one embodiment, the silanes are added before or during the compounding of the filler into the organic polymer because these silanes facilitate and improve the dispersion of the filler. The total amount of silane present in the resulting rubber composition should be about 0.05 to about 25 parts by weight per hundred parts by weight of organic polymer (phr). In another embodiment, the amount of silane present in the rubber is from about 1 to 10 phr. Fillers can be used in quantities ranging from about 5 to about 100 phr, more preferably from 25 to 80 phr.<br>
When reaction of the mixture to couple the filler to the polymer is desired, a deblocking agent is added to the mixture to deblock the organofunctional silane compositions that contain cyclic and/or bridging dialkoxysilyl groups and free and blocked mercapto groups. The deblocking agent may be added at quantities ranging from about 01 to about 5 phr; more preferably in the range of from about 0.5 to about 3 phr. If alcohol or water are present in the mixture (as is common), a catalyst (e.g., tertiary amines, or Lewis acids) may be used to initiate and promote the loss of the blocking group by hydrolysis or alcoholysis to liberate the corresponding mercaptosilane. Alternatively, the deblocking agent may be a nucleophile containing a hydrogen atom sufficiently labile such that hydrogen atom could be transferred to the site of the original blocking group to form the mercaptosilane. Thus, with a blocking group acceptor molecule, an exchange of hydrogen from the nucleophile would occur with the blocking group of the blocked mercaptosilane to form the mercaptosilane and the corresponding derivative of the nucleophile containing the original blocking group. This transfer of the blocking group from the silane to the nucleophile could be driven, for example, by a greater thermodynamic stability of the products (mercaptosilane and nucleophile containing the blocking group) relative to the initial reactants (organofunctional silane compositions that contain cyclic and/or bridging dialkoxysilyl groups and free and blocked mercapto groups and the nucleophile). For example, if the nucleophile were an amine containing an N-H bond, transfer of the blocking group from the organofunctional silane compositions that contain cyclic and/or bridging dialkoxysilyl groups and free and blocked mercapto groups would yield the mercaptosilane and one of several classes of amides corresponding to the type of blocking group used. For example, carboxyl blocking groups deblocked by amines would yield amides, sulfonyl blocking groups deblocked by amines would yield sulfonamides, sulfmyl blocking groups deblocked by amines would yield sulfinamides, phosphonyl blocking groups deblocked by amines would yield phosphonamides, and phosphinyl blocking groups deblocked by amines would yield phosphinarnides. What is important is that regardless of the<br>
32<br><br>
blocking group initially present on the cyclic and bridging dialkoxy blocked mercaptofunctional silane and regardless of the deblocking agent used, the initially substantially inactive (from the standpoint of coupling to the organic polymer) organofunctional silane compositions that contain cyclic and/or bridging dialkoxysilyl groups and free and blocked mercapto groups is substantially converted at the desired point in the rubber compounding procedure to the active mercaptosilane. It is noted that partial amounts of the nucleophile maybe used (i.e., a stoichiometric deficiency), if one were to only deblock part of the organofunctional silane compositions that contain cyclic and/or bridging dialkoxysilyl groups and free and blocked mercapto groups to control the degree of vulcanization of a specific formulation.<br>
Water typically is present on the inorganic filler as a hydrate or bound to the filler in<br>
the form of a hydroxyl group. The deblocking agent can be added in the curative<br>
package or, alternatively, at any other stage in the compounding process as a single<br>
component. Examples of nucleophiles would include any primary or secondary<br>
amines, or amines containing C=N double bonds , such as imines or guanidines;<br>
with the proviso that said amine contains at least one N-H (nitrogen-hydrogen)<br>
bond. Numerous specific examples of guanidines, amines, and imines well known in<br>
the art, which are useful as components in curatives for rubber, are cited in Rubber<br>
Chemicals; J. Van- Alphen; Plastics and Rubber Research Institute TNO, Delft,<br>
Holland; 1973. Some examples include: N,N'-diphenylguanidine, N,N',N"<br>
-triphenylguanidine,	N,N'-di-ortho-	tolylguanidine,	ortho-biguanide,<br>
hexamethylenetetramine, cyclohexylethylamine, dibutylamine, and 4,4'-diaminodiphenylmethane. Any general acid catalysts used to transesterify esters, such as Bronsted or Lewis acids, could be used as catalysts.<br>
The rubber composition need not be, but preferably is, substantially free of functional ized siloxanes, especially those of the type disclosed in Australian Patent AU-A- 10082/97, which is incorporated herein by reference. Most preferably, the rubber composition is free of functionalized siloxanes.<br>
In practice, sulfur vulcanized rubber products typically are prepared by thermomechanically mixing rubber and various ingredients in a sequentially step¬wise manner followed by shaping and curing the compounded rubber to form a vulcanized product. First, for the aforesaid mixing of the rubber and various ingredients, typically exclusive of sulfur and sulfur vulcanization accelerators (collectively "curing agents"), the rubber(s) and various rubber compounding ingredients are usually blended in at least one, and often (in the case of silica filled low rolling resistance tires) two, preparatory thermomechanical mixing stage(s) in suitable mixers. Such preparatory mixing is referred to as non-productive mixing or non-productive mixing steps or stages. Such preparatory mixing usually is conducted at temperatures in the range of from about 140°C to about 200°C and often in the range of from about 150°C to about 180°C.<br>
33<br><br>
Subsequent to such preparatory mix stages, in a final mixing stage, sometimes referred to as a productive mix stage, deblocking agent (in the case of this invention), curing agents, and possibly one or more additional ingredients, are mixed with the rubber compound or composition, typically at a temperature in a range of 50°C to 130°C, which is a lower temperature than those utilized in the preparatory mix stages to prevent or retard premature curing oi the sulfur curable rubber, which is sometimes referred to as scorching of the rubber composition.<br>
The rubber mixture, sometimes referred to as a rubber compound or composition, typically is allowed to cool, sometimes after or during a process intermediate mill mixing, between the aforesaid various mixing steps, for example, to a temperature of about 50°C or lower.<br>
When it is desired to mold and to cure the rubber, the rubber is placed into the appropriate mold at about at least 130°C and up to about 200°C, which will cause the vulcanization of the rubber by the mercapto groups on the mercaptosilane and any other free sulfiir sources in the rubber mixture.<br>
By thermomechanical mixing, it is meant that the rubber compound, or composition of rubber and rubber compounding ingredients, is mixed in a rubber mixture under high shear conditions where it autogenously heats up as a result of the mixing, primarily due to shear and associated friction within the rubber mixture in the rubber mixer. Several chemical reactions may occur at various steps in the mixing and curing processes.<br>
The first reaction is a relatively fast reaction and is considered herein to take place between the filler and the alkoxysilane group of the cyclic and/or bridging dialkoxy blocked mercaptofunctional silanes. Such reaction may occur at a relatively low temperature, such as, for example, about 120°C The second and third reactions are considered herein to be the deblocking of the cyclic and/or bridging dialkoxy blocked mercaptofunctional silanes and the reaction which takes place between the sulfur- containing portion of the silane (after deblocking), and the sulfur vulcanizable rubber at a higher temperature; for example, above about 140°C.<br>
Another sulfur source may be used, for example, in the form of elemental sulfur as Ss. A sulfur donor is considered herein as a sulfiir-containing compound that liberates free, or elemental sulfur, at a temperature in a range of about 140°C to about 190°C Such sulfur donors may be, for example, although are not limited to, polysulfide vulcanization accelerators and organosilane polysulfides with at least two connecting sulfur atoms in their polysulfide bridge. The amount of free sulfur source addition to the mixture can be controlled or manipulated as a matter of choice relatively independently from the addition of the aforesaid cyclic and bridging dialkoxy blocked mercaptofunctional silane composition.<br>
34<br><br>
Thus, for example, the independent addition of a sulfur source may be manipulated by the amount of addition thereof and by sequence of addition relative to addition of other ingredients to the rubber mixture.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, a rubber composition is prepared by a process comprising the sequential steps of:<br>
(a) thermomechanically mixing, in at least one preparatory mixing step, to a temperature of 140°C to 200°C, alternatively to 140°C to 190°C5 for a total mixing time of 2 to 20, alternatively 4 to 15, minutes for such mixing step(s):<br>
i)   100 parts by weight of at least one sulfur vulcanizable rubber selected from conjugated diene homopolymers and copolymers, and copolymers of at least one conjugated diene and aromatic vinyl compound, ii) 5 to 100, preferably 25 to 80, phr of particulate filler, wherein the filler<br>
preferably contains from 1 to 85 weight percent carbon black, and iii) 0.05 to 20 parts by weight filler of at least one cyclic and/or bridging dialkoxy silane of the present invention composition;<br>
b)	subsequently blending therewith, in a final thermomechanical mixing step at a temperature to 50°C to 130°C for a time sufficient to blend the rubber, preferably between 1 to 30 minutes, more preferably 1 to 3 minutes, at least one deblocking agent at about 0.05 to 20 parts by weight of the filler and a curing agent at 0 to 5 phr; and, optionally; and,<br>
c)	curing said mixture at a temperature in the range of from 130 to 200°C for about 5 to 60 minutes.<br>
The process may also comprise the additional steps of preparing an assembly of a tire or sulfur vulcanizable rubber with a tread comprised of the rubber composition prepared according to this invention and vulcanizing the assembly at a temperature in a range of 130°C to 200°C.<br>
Suitable organic polymers and fillers are well known in the art and are described in numerous texts, of which two examples include The Vanderbilt Rubber Handbook; R.F. Ohm, ed.; R.T. Vanderbilt Company, Inc., Norwalk, CT; 1990 and Manual For The Rubber Industry; T. Kempermann, S. Koch, J. Sumner, eds.; Bayer AG, Leverkusen, Germany; 1993. Representative examples of suitable polymers include solution styrene-butadiene rubber (SSBR), styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), natural rubber (NR), polybutadiene (BR), ethylene-propylene co- and ter- polymers (EP, EPDM), and acrylonitrile-butadierie rubber (NBR).<br>
The rubber composition is comprised of at least one diene-based elastomer, or rubber. Suitable conjugated dienes are isoprene and 1,3-butadiene and suitable vinyl aromatic compounds are styrene and alpha methyl styrene. Thus, the rubber is a sulfur -curable rubber. Such diene based elastomer, or rubber, may be selected, for example, from at least one of cis-l,4-polyisoprene rubber (natural and/or synthetic),<br>

and preferably natural rubber), emulsion polymerization prepared<br>
styrene/butadiene copolymer rubber, organic solution polymerization prepared<br>

styrene/isoprene/butadiene terpolymer rubber, cis-l,4-polybutadiene, medium<br>
vinyl polybutadiene rubber (35-50 percent vinyl), high vinyl polybutadiene rubber<br>
(50-75 percent vinyl), styrene/isoprene copolymers, emulsion polymerization<br>
prepared	styreneAtadiene/acrylonitrile	terpolymer	rabber	and<br>
butadiene/acrylonitrile copolymer rubber. An emulsion polymerization derived styrene/butadiene (ESBR) may be used having a relatively conventional styrene content of 20 to 28 percent bound styrene or, for some applications, an ESBR having a medium to relatively high bound styrene content, namely, a bound styrene content of 30 to 45 percent. Emulsion polymerization prepared styrene/butadiene/acrylonitrile terpolymer rubbers containing 2 to 40 weight percent bound acrylonitrile in the terpolymer are also contemplated as diene based rubbers for use in this invention.<br>
The solution polymerization prepared SBR (SSBR) typically has a bound styrene content in a range of 5 to 50, preferably 9 to 36, percent. Polybutadiene elastomer may he conveniently characterized, for example, by having at least a 90 weight percent cis-l,4-content.<br>
Representative examples of suitable filler materials include include metal oxides, such as silica (pyrogenic and precipitated), titanium dioxide, aluminosilicate, and alumina, siliceous materials, including clays and talc, and carbon black. Particulate, precipitated silica is also sometimes used for such purpose, particularly in connection with a silane. In some cases, a combination of silica and carbon black is utilized for reinforcing fillers for various rubber products, including treads for tires. Alumina can be used either alone or in combination with silica. The term "alumina" can be described herein as aluminum oxide, or A12O3. The fillers may be hydrated or in anhydrous form. Use of alumina in rabber compositions is known, see, for example, U.S. Patent No. 5,116,886 and EP 631 982.<br>
The organofunctional silane compositions that contain cyclic and/or bridging dialkoxysilyl groups and free and blocked mercapto groups may be premixed, or pre-reacted, with the filler particles or added to the rubber mix during the rubber and filler processing, or mixing stage. If the silane and filler are added separately to the rubber mix during the rubber and filler mixing, or processing stage, it is considered that the organofunctional silane compositions that contain cyclic and/or bridging dialkoxysilyl groups and free and blocked mercapto groups then couple in situ to the filler.<br>
The vulcanized rubber composition should contain a sufficient amount of filler to contribute a reasonably high modulus and high resistance to tear. The combined weight oi the filler may be as low as about 5 to 100 phr, but is more preferably from 25 to 85 phr.<br>
36<br><br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, precipitated silica is utilized as filler. The silica filler herein may as characterized by having a BET surface area, as measured using nitrogen gas, preferably in the range of from-about 40 to about 600m2/g, and more preferably in a range of from about 50 to about 300 m2/g. The BET method of measuring surface area is described in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, Volume 60, page 304 (1930). The silica typically may also be characterized by having a dibutylphthaiate (DBP) absorption value in a range of from about 100 to about 350, and more usually from about 150 to about 300. Further, useful silica fillers, as well as the aforesaid alumina and aluminosilicate fillers, may be expected to have a CTAB surface area in a range of from about 100 to about 220 m2/g. The CTAB surface area is the external surface area as evaluated by cetyl trimethylammonium bromide with a pH of 9. The method is described in ASTM D 3849.<br>
Mercury porosity surface area is the specific surface area determined by mercury porosimetry. For such technique, mercury is penetrated into the pores of the sample after a thermal treatment to remove volatiles. Set-up conditions may be suitably described as using a 100 mg sample; removing volatiles during 2 hours at 105°C and ambient atmospheric pressure; and ambient to 2000 bars pressure measuring range. Such evaluation may be performed according to the method described in Winslow, et al. in ASTM bulletin, p.39 (1959) or according to DIN 66133. For such an evaluation, a CARLO-ERBA Porosimeter 2000 may be used. The average mercury porosity specific surface area for the selected silica filler should be in a range of 100 to300m2/g.<br>
In one embodiment, a suitable pore size distribution for the silica, alumina and aluminosilicate according to such mercury porosity evaluation is considered herein to be: five percent or less of its pores having a diameter of less than about 10 nm; from about 60 to about 90 percent of its pores have a diameter of from about 0 to about 100 nm; from 10 to about 30 percent of its poxes having a diameter of from about 100 to about 1,000 nm, and from about 5 to about 20 percent of its pores have a diameter of greater than about 1,000 nm. In a second embodiment, the silica may be expected to have an average ultimate particle size, for example, in the range of from about 0.01 to about 0.05 um as determined by electron microscopy, although the silica particles may be even smaller, or possibly larger, in size. Various commercially available silicas may be considered for use herein such as, those available from PPG Industries under the HI-SIL trademark, in particular, HI-SIL 210, 243, etc.; silicas available from Rhone-Poulenc, e.g., ZEOSIL 1165MP; silicas available from Degussa, e.g., VN2 and VN3, etc. and silicas available from Huber, e.g., HUBERSEL 8745.<br>
Where it is desired for the rubber composition, which contains both a siliceous filler such as silica, alumina and/or aluminosilicates and also carbon black reinforcing . pigments, to be primarily reinforced with silica as the reinforcing pigment, it is often preferable that the weight ratio of such siliceous fillers to carbon black is at least 3/1 and preferably at least 10/1 and, thus, in a range of 3/1 to 30/1. The filler may comprise from about 15 to about 95 weight percent precipitated silica, alumina<br>
37<br><br>
and/or aiuminosilicate and, correspondingly from about 5 to about 85 weight percent carbon black, wherein the said carbon black has a CTAB value in a range of from about 80 to about 150. Alternatively, the filler may comprise from about 60 to about 95 weight percent of said silica, alumina and/or aiuminosilicate and, correspondingly, from about 40 to about 5 weight percent of carbon black. The siliceous filler and carbon black may be pre-blended or blended together in the manufacture of the vulcanized rubber.<br>
The rubber composition can be compounded by methods known in the rubber compounding art, such as mixing the various sulfur-vulcanizable constituent rubbers with various commonly used additive materials as, for example, curing aids such as sulfur, activators, retarders and accelerators, processing.additives such as oils, resins e.g., tackifying resins, silicas, plasticizers, fillers, pigments, fatty acid, zinc oxide, waxes, antioxidants and antiozonants, peptizing agents, and reinforcing materials such as, for example, carbon black, and the like. Depending on the intended use of the sulfur vulcanizable and sulfur vulcanized material (rubbers), the additives mentioned above are selected and commonly used in conventional amounts.<br>
The vulcanization can be conducted in the presence of an additional sulfur vulcanizing agent. Examples of suitable sulfur vulcanizing agents include, e.g., elemental sulfur (free sulfur) or sulfur donating vulcanizing agents, for example, an amino disulfide, polymeric'poly sulfide or sulfur olefin adducts, which are conventionally added in the final, productive, rubber composition mixing step. The sulfur vulcanizing agents (which are common in the art) are used, or added in the productive mixing stage, in an amount ranging from about 0.4 to about 3 phr/or even, in some circumstances, up to about 8 phr, with a range of from about 1.5 to about 2.5 phr, and in some cases from about 2 to about 2.5 phr, being preferred.<br>
Vulcanization accelerators, i.e., additional sulfur donors, may also be used. It will be appreciated that they may be, for example, of the type, such as, for example, benzothiazole, alkyl thiuram disulfide, guanidine derivatives, and thiocarbamates. Representative   of   such   accelerators   are,   e.g.,   but   not   limited   to,   mercapto benzothiazole,      tetramethyl      thiuram     disulfide,      benzothiazole      disulfide, diphenylguanidine, zinc dithiocarbamate, alkylphenoldisulftde, zinc butyl xanthate, N-dicyclohexyl-2-benzothiazolesulf enamide, N-cyclohexyl-1- ■ benzothiazolesulfenamide, N-oxydiethylenebenzothiazole-2-sulfenamide, N,N-diphenylthiourea, dithiocarbamylsulfenamide, N,N-diisopropyIbenzothiozole-2-sulfenamide3 zinc-2-mercaptotoluimidazole, dithiobis(N-methyl piperazine), dithiobis(N-beta-hydroxy ethyl piperazine) and dithiobis(dibenzyl amine). Other additional sulfur donors, include, e.g., thiuram and morpholme derivatives. Representative of such donors include, e.g., but are nof limited to, dimorpholine disulfide, dimorpholine tetrasulfide, tetramethyl thiuram tetrasulfide, benzothiazyl-2,N-dithiomoipholide, rhioplasts, dipentamethylenethiuram hexasulfide acid d isul f idecaprolactam.<br>
38<br><br>
Accelerators are used to control the time and/or temperature required for vulcanization and to improve the properties of the vulcanizate. In one embodiment, a single accelerator system can be used, i.e., a primary accelerator. Conventionally and preferably, a primary accelerators) is used in total amounts ranging from about 0.5 to about 4, preferably from about 0.8 to about 1.5, phr. Combinations of a primary and a secondary accelerator might be used with the secondary accelerator being used in smaller amounts (e.g., from about 0.05 to about 3 phr) in order to activate and to improve the properties of the vulcanizate. Delayed action accelerators may be used. Vulcanization retarders can also be used. Suitable types of accelerators are amines, disulfides, guanidines, thioureas, thiazoles, thiurams, sulfenamides, dithiocarbamates and xanthates Preferably, the primary accelerator is a sulfenamide. If a second accelerator is used, the secondary accelerator is preferably a guanidine/'dithiocarbamate or thiuram compound.<br>
Typical amounts of tackifier resins, if used, can be from about 0.5 to about 10 phr, usually from about 1 to about 5 phr. Typical amounts of.processing aids comprise from about 1 to about 50 phr. Such processing aids can include, e.g., aromatic, naphthenic and/ or paraffinic processing oils. Typical amounts of antioxidants are from about 1 to about 5 phr. Representative antioxidants include, e.g., diphenyl-p-phenylenediamine and others, e.g., those disclosed in the Vanderbilt Rubber Handbook (1978), pages 344-346. Typical amounts of antiozonants, are from about 1 to about 5 phr.<br>
Typical amounts of fatty acids, ii used, which can include stearic acid, are from about 0.5 to about 3 phr. Typical amounts of zinc oxide are from about 2 to about 5 phr. Typical amounts of waxes are from about 1 to about 5 phr. Often microcrystalline waxes are used. Typical amounts of peptizers are from about 0.1 to about 1 phr. Typical peptizers include, e.g., pentachlorothiophenol and dibenzatnidodiphenyl disulfide.<br>
The rubber compositions of this invention can be used for various purposes. For example, they can be used for various tire compounds, shoe soles and other industrial goods. Such articles can be built, shaped, molded and cured by various known and conventional methods as is readily apparent to those skilled in the art. One particularly useful application of the rubber compositions herein is for the manufacture oi tire treads. An advantage of tires, tire treads, or other articles oi manufacture derived from the rubber compositions herein is that they suffer from less VOC emissions during their lifetime and use as a result of having been manufactured from a rubber compound that contains less residual silane ethoxy groups than do rubber compounds of the known and currently practiced art. This is a direct result of having used dialkoxy-functional silane coupling agents in their manufacture, which contain fewer or essentially no ethoxy groups on silicon, relative to the silane coupling agents of the currently known and practiced art. The lack or reduction of ethoxysilane groups in the coupling agents used results in fewer residual ethoxy groups on silicon after the article of manufacture is produced, from<br>
39<br><br>
which less or no ethanol can be released by hydrolysis of the residual ethoxysilane groups by exposure of the article of manufacture to water during use.<br>
The rubber compositions herein and the articles of manufacture derivable therefrom as described herein are novel in that both contain non-silicon-containing ethoxy esters and esters of hydrocarbon-based diols, as well as the hydrocarbon based diols. Typical examples of such species contained in the rubber compositions and articles of manufacture described herein include octanoate, hexanoate, decanoate, and/or dodecanoate esters of diols such as propanediols, pentane diols, ethylene glycol, and propylene glycol. Additional species would include ethyl octanoate, ethyl hexanoate, ethyl decanoate, and/or ethyl dodecanoate. These species possess polarities intermediate between those of the rubber polymers and the filler, thereby helping to stabilize the compositions and articles of manufacture from filler reagglomeration and the resulting degradation of the properties and performance parameters thereof.<br>
