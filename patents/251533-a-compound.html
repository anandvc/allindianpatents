Thus, for example, a reaction step involving use of "a base", or for example, involving use of "a base selected from one of potassium hydroxide, potassium tert-butoxide, potassium te7?-pentoxide, sodium hydroxide, sodium tert-butoxide, hthium hydroxide," encompasses use of potassium hydroxide as a base, or, where appropriate, mixtures of<br>
potassium hydroxide plus one or more additional bases set forth in the group from which a selection may be made. One skilled in the field may make appropriate selections given the reactions steps and conditions and result to be achieved.<br>
Methods of Preparation<br>
The compound entecavir and novel intermediates therefor may be prepared by the exemplary processes described in the following reaction Schemes. Exemplary reagents and procedures for these reactions appear hereinafter or are described above. Starting materials are commercially available or can be readily prepared by one of ordinary skill in the art Solvents, temperatures, pressures, starting materials having the desired groups, and other reaction conditions, may be readily selected as appropriate by one of ordinary skiil in the art.<br>
PROCESS A SCHEME 1<br>
(Scheme Removed) <br>
Process A of the invention comprises preparation of the ester of formula 66, a preferred intermediate or starting material for preparing entecavir 21. In the ester of formula 66, R is a C1 to C4 alkyl or benzyl, preferably methyl; Ra is allyl, phenyl, C1 to C6 alkylphenyl or C1 to C6 alkoxyphenyl, more preferably Ra is selected from phenyl, d to C3 alkylphenyl, and C1 to C3 alkoxyphenyl; and Rb is C1 to C6 alkyl, preferably methyl. The ester can be prepared by any method that provides the ester in<br>
high diastereomeric and enantiomeric purity. A preferred procedure is shown in Scheme 1, wherein sodium cyclopentadienide 62 is treated with a silylating reagent, e.g., Ra(Rb)2SiY, wherein Y is a leaving group, e.g., phenyldimethylchlorosilane wherein Ra is phenyl, Rb is methyl, and Y is CI. The reaction may be carried out in a solvent such as MTBE and/or THF. The resulting silane moiety serves as a masked hydroxy group that can be unveiled later in the synthetic process. The product of the silylation reaction can then be elaborated using a 2+2 cycloaddition reaction with ketene, e.g., generated from dichloroacetyl chloride and an appropriate base (e.g., Et3N, NaOH, KOH, NaHCO3, KHCO3, Na2CO3, K2CO3, TBAH, etc.), to give the cyclobutanone of formula 63. The cyclobutanone can then be opened with a suitable base (e.g., Et3N, NaOH, KOH, NaHCO3, KHCO3, Na2CO3, K2CO3, TBAH, etc.), and the resulting intermediate reduced with a suitable reducing agent, e.g., NaBEU, to provide the carboxylic acid of formula 64.<br>
Resolution of the enantiomers of the carboxylic acid 64 can be accomplished by salt formation with chiral amines (CAs) and separation of the resulting diastereomeric salts. A diastereomeric mixture of ammonium salts of the carboxylic acid of formula 64 is preferably prepared using R,R-(-)-2-amino-l-(4-nitrophenyl)-1,3-propanediol. Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that other chiral amines can be used to achieve the resolution of the enantiomers of the carboxylic acid of formula 64. These amines include, for example, (lR,2R)-(+)-l,2-diphenylethylenediamine, (R)-(-)-l-cyclohexylethylamine, D-threo-2-amino-l-(4-nitrophenyl)-l ,3-propanediol, (1 S,2S)-(+)-1,2-diaminocyclohexane, dehydroabietylamine, (lR,2R)-l,2-diminomethylcyclohexane, cinchonidine and cinchonine.<br>
Separation of the resulting diastereomeric salts can be accomplished by any separation procedure known to those of ordinary skill in the art, such as chromatography or crystallization. Separation of the diastereomeric salts is preferably effected by crystallization. For example, the diastereomerically enriched ammonium salt of formula 65 A (where the chiral amine used is R,R-(-)-2-amino-l-(4-nitrophenyl)-l,3-propanediol) can be isolated by crystallization from EtOH. The ammonium salt of formula 65A isolated by this procedure can have a chemical purity<br>
of 98% and 98% de Conversion of the ammonium salt of formula 65A to the ester of formula 66 (R is alkyl) can be accomplished by heating in an acidic solution, e.g., MeOH and an appropriate acid, such as sulfuric acid or p-toluenesulfonic acid, or HC1 in methylene chloride. Alternatively, compound 65A can be converted into a free acid which is subjected to esterification with alcohol, e.g., MeOH, in the presence of PTSA, at refluxing conditions, to provide compound 66.<br>
PROCESS B SCHEME (Scheme Removed) <br><br>
Process B of the invention comprises preparing entecavir 21, via coupling an epoxide of formula 72, with a substituted guanine derivative to prepare a carbocyclic nucleoside, the compound of formula 73, which is then elaborated to the compound 21. One embodiment of Process B is depicted in Scheme 2. In this process, a preferred starting material for the epoxide of formula 72 is an ester of formula 66 (which can be prepared as described in Scheme 1). The compound of formula 66 can be epoxidized and the ester group can be reduced to furnish the cyclopentane epoxide<br>
of formula 72 in high diastereomeric purity. For example, the compound of formula 66 can serve as starting material for a diastereoselective epoxidation reaction. In one embodiment, the cyclopentane epoxide of formula 72 is formed after the epoxidation and reduction steps in at least 96% de The diastereoselective epoxidation is effected with a homochiral diester of tartaric acid, a hydroperoxide, and a metal catalyst, such as a transition metal catalyst. Preferably, the homochiral ester is DIPT, the hydroperoxide is TBHP or CHP, and the metal catalyst is titanium (IV) isopropoxide. Preferably, the reaction is carried but in an inert solvent such as dry DCM or toluene. Methods suitable for effecting the catalytic epoxidation reactions are described in United States Patent Nos. 4,471,130; 4,594,439; and 4,900,847, incorporated herein by reference. After workup, the crude product can be carried on in the synthesis without further purification.<br>
The crude product from the epoxidation reaction is treated with a reducing reagent that selectively reduces the ester group to an alcohol, such as, e.g., NaBHU, LAH, lithium borohydride, diisobutylaluminum hydride, sodium bis(2-methoxyethoxyalnminum) hydride, and the like. In one embodiment, the reducing - agent used in the reaction is NaBKU in PA. The reduction provides the cyclopentane epoxide having the formula 72.<br>
The cyclopentane epoxide of formula 72 can then be heated, for example, to about 80°C with an alkali metal salt, e.g, a lithium salt, of the purine compound of formula 28, wherein X is CI, I, or benzyloxy (BnO) in a dipolar aprotic solvent such as DMF to prepare the compound of formula 73. For example, the lithium salt of 2-amino-6-O-benzyloxypurine is prepared by treatment with base such as LiOH or LiH. This coupling reaction to prepare the carbocyclic nucleoside is advantageous in that it provides a high N-9 to N-7 ratio (e.g., N-9:N-7 &gt;20:1), allows convenient workup and purification procedures, and provides useful yields of the compound of formula 73. For example, after water workup, the crude product of the coupling reaction of the purine compound of formula 28 wherein X is BnO, and the cyclopentane epoxide of formula 72, can be purified by simple recrystallization from a solution of EtOAc-hexanes to provide the compound of formula 73 in 65% yield.<br>
The compound of formula 73, wherein X is BnO, can then be converted to the compound of formula 71 by converting the vicinal diol moiety to an alkene. Analogously, the compound of formula 73, wherein X is CI or I, can be converted to compound 92 by converting the vicinal diol moiety to an alkene. In one embodiment, the vicinal diol of the compound of formula 73 is converted to an alkene as in compounds 71 and 92, by a two-step procedure. In the first step, the compound of formula 73 is treated with an orthoformate derivative, such as DEMA, DiPMA, TiPOF, TEOF, or TMOF, in the presence of an acid such as PPTS or TFA. The reaction is preferably carried out in an inert solvent such as DCM, toluene, or tert-butyl methyl ether, at room temperature for a sufficient amount of time to form a product comprising a diastefeomeric mixture of dioxolanes. la the second step, the diastereomeric mixture of dioxolanes is heated with acetic anhydride, preferably in the presence of acetic acid and an antioxidant, e.g., BHT, to form the alkene. m embodiments wherein X is BnO, the crude product from the acetic anhydride treatment can then be heated with acid such as aqueous mineral acid or aqueous organic acid, e.g., HC1 or MSA, to hydrolyze the 6-benzyloxy group (as well as an 2-N-acetyl group formed in the acetic anhydride treatment) to provide the methylene compound of formula 71, or its salts (e.g., MSA or HC1 salts). The intermediates of formulas 71 and 92 can be isolated in the form of a salt by treatment with an acid such as HO, MSA, (lS)-(+)-10-camphorsulfonic acid, (R)-chloropropionic acid, N-[(R)-1-(1-naphthyl) ethyl] phthalamic acid, L-tartaric acid, dibenzyl-L-tartaric acid, L-lactic acid, (1R, 3S)-camphoric acid, L-aspartic acid, (S)-citronellic acid, etc.<br>
Preparation of the final compound 21 from compound 71 can then be accomplished by converting the silane moiety to a hydroxy moiety. This conversion can be achieved via protodesilylation of the silane moiety followed by oxidation with an oxidizing source, such as, for example, hydrogen peroxide. The protodesilylation step can be achieved via reaction with boron trifluoride-acetic acid complex, or a Bronsted acid such as TFA, MSA, FMSA, or tetrafluoroboric acid in an inert solvent, e.g., DCM. Alternatively, protodesilylation can be achieved with a base or acid as described below in Scheme 6. Upon debenzylation (which may, in some<br>
embodiments, be achieved in the protodesilyation step (e.g., when MSA or FMSA are used), there is provided the protodesilylated intermediate of formula 91<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
The protodesilylated intermediate 91 can then be oxidized. The oxidizing agent(s) can be selected in view of the reagent used to achieve protodesilyation. For example, when boron trifluoride-acetic acid complex is used, the compound can be oxidized with hydrogen peroxide and KHCO3, to provide the target compound of formula 21, and when a Bronsted acid is used, compound 91 may be oxidized with hydrogen peroxide, KHCO3, and KF. Other acids and oxidizing agents that may be useful may be recited above. Alternatively, conversion of the silyl moiety to a hydroxy group may be achieved as described in Scheme 6, below, and additional methods that may be useful for the transformation of the silyl group to the hydroxy group are described in Fleming, I. (Chemtracts-Orgcmic Chemistry 1996, 9,1-64) and Jones, G.R. et al. (Tetrahedron, 1996,52,7599-7662), both of which are herein incorporated by reference. The compound of formula 21 can be further purified, for example, by recrystallization from water, and/or via resin purification as described below in Process K.<br>
In alternate embodiments of Process B, the purine 28, coupled with cyclopentane epoxide 72 to give compound 73, is other than 2-amino-6-benzyloxypurine, such as 2-amino-6-chloropurine or 2-amino-6-iodopurine. In this embodiment, compound 73 is upon treatment with the orthoformate, acid, etc., converted to compound 92, which upon protodesilylation and oxidation is converted to compound 93. In this instance, wherein 2-amino-6-chloropurine or 2-amino-6-iodopurine is used, an additional treatment with aqueous base or acid (preferably aqueous base) may be utilized to convert the halo group of compound 93 into the 6-oxo moiety. For example, aqueous NaOH solution may be used to convert the compound of formula 93 to the compound of formula 21.<br>
PROCESS C SCHEME 3<br>
(Scheme Removed) <br>
The ester of formula 66 can also be converted to the compound of formula 21 by the methods of Process C. One embodiment of Process is depicted in Scheme 3. In contrast to Process B, the epoxidation reaction of the cyclopentane in Process C is performed after the ester moiety has been reduced. In Process C, the primary alcohol moiety of the ester of formula 66 (R= alkyl) is protected with a protecting group such as a MOP by treatment with 2-methoxypropene and a catalytic amount of an acid, such as PPTS, in an insert solvent such as toluene, to yield the compound of formula 74. The carboxylic ester moiety of 74 can be reduced with a hydride reagent, preferably Red-Al® or LAH. In one embodiment, the ester moiety of 74 is reduced, preferably after the addition of a suitable base, such as with a tertiary amine base, e.g., Et3N, in the same reaction vessel to give the compound of formula 75. In another embodiment, the ester moiety of 74 is reduced with a hydride reagent after workup, to give compound 75. The resultant alcohol moiety of the compound of formula 75 is first protected with a protecting group that is resistant to hydrolysis conditions that are<br>
then used to remove the MOP group. For example, the alcohol moiety of the compound of formula 74 can be treated with a base (e.g., KOtBu, KHMDS, NaH, phase-transfer catalyst conditions using 50% NaOH), and a benzyl halide, e.g., benzyl bromide or benzyl chloride, preferably in solvent such as toluene or THF, to protect the alcohol moiety as a benzyl ether. The MOP acetal can then be hydrolyzed by addition of aqueous acid, such as 1N HO, to give the allylic alcohol of formula 76. Other protecting groups known in the field may be found in the literature, such as Greene and Wuts, cited above in the general definitions herein.<br>
The allylic alcohol of formula 76 serves as starting material for a diastereoselective epoxidation reaction, wherein the product, the cyclopentane epoxide of formula 77, is formed in high diastereomeric purity. For example, the epoxidation can be effected using a homochiral diester of tartaric acid, a hydroperoxide, and a metal catalyst, such as a transition metal catalyst. Alternately, the diastereoselective epoxidation may be performed with a peracid, such as MPP A, as described in Scheme 14 and Example 12. Preferably, diastereoepoxidation is performed with the homochiral ester DIPT, the hydroperoxide TBHP or CHP, and the metal catalyst Ti(0-iPr)4. Preferably, the reaction is carried out in an inert solvent such as toluene, methylene chloride, etc. In one embodiment, the cyclopentane epoxide of formula 77 is formed in at least 96% de<br>
The cyclopentane epoxide of formula 77 can then be reacted (e.g., at elevated temperature, e.g., preferably at about 80°C) with an alkali metal salt of purine compound of formula 28, wherein X is CI, I or BnO, in a dipolar aprotic solvent such as DMF to prepare the compound of formula 78. Preferably, the purine compound of formula 28 is 2-amino-6-benzyloxypurine. The 2-amino-6-benzyloxypurine is commercially available or can be prepared from 6-chloroguanine and the sodium salt of benzyl alcohol (e.g., upon treatment with NaOH in benzyl alcohol, toluene, and MeOH, or upon treatment with the sodium salt of benzyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol, in EtOH/water.). The alkali metal salt can be generated in situ by reaction of 2-amino-6-O-benzyloxypurine with, for example, LiH or IiOH. The crude compound of formula 78, wherein X is benzyloxy, can be isolated and purified. For example, the crude<br>
compound 78 can be isolated upon addition of IP A and water, then purified by recrystallization with solvents or solvent mixtures known in the field<br>
The compound of formula 78 can then be converted to the compound of formula 21 using various reaction sequences analogous to those used to convert the compound of formula 73 to the compound of formula 21 in Process B, which are further described in Schemes 4, 5 and 6, below.<br>
PROCESS C(a) SCHEME 4<br>
(Scheme Removed) <br>
Scheme 4 describes a process for converting compound 78A (compound 78 wherein X is OBn), to the compound of formula 21. Compound 78A can be treated with an orthoformate derivative, such as DEMA, DiPMA, TMOF, TiPOF, TEOF, etc., preferably in an inert solvent such as toluene, DCM, MTBE etc., as described in Scheme 2, in the presence of a catalytic amount of an acid such as TFA or PTSA, or an acid catalyst such as PPTS, etc., to form a product comprising a diastereomeric<br>
mixture of dioxolanes, e.g., compounds 101 and 103. The diastereomeric mixture of dioxolanes 101 and 103 can be heated with acetic anhydride preferably in the presence of acetic acid and an anti-oxidant, such as BHT, to form alkene having the formula 105. The crude product 105 can then be heated with acid, such as with aqueous HC1 or MSA, in an appropriate solvent such as MeOH and water, to hydrolyze the 6-benzyloxy and N-acetyl groups and provide the methylene compound of formula 79. The intermediate 79 can be isolated in the form of a salt by treatment with an acid such as HC1, MSA, (lS)-(+)-10-camphorsulfonic acid, (R)-chloropropionic acid, N-[(R)-l-(l-naphthyl) ethyl] phthalamic acid, L-tartaric acid, dibenzyl-L-tartaric acid, L-lactic acid, (1R, 3S)-camphoric acid, L-aspartic acid, (S)-citronellic acid, etc. In one embodiument, intermediate 79 or salts thereof are further purified by recrystallization, e.g., intermediate 79 salts thereof are treated with NaOH in an organic solvent and crystallized before proceeding to the next step.<br>
Preparation of the final compound of formula 21 from compound 79, or salts thereof, can then be accomplished by converting the silane moiety to a hydroxy moiety. This conversion can be achieved via protodesilylation of the silane moiety with reagent(s) selected to provide the intermediate compound 91, followed by oxidation. Protodesilylation maybe achieved with boron trifluoride-acetic acid complex or a Bronsted acid in insert solvent, e.g., MSA in methylene chloride. Oxidation may be carried out as described in Scheme 2, using oxidizing agents and additives appropriately selected, i.e., depending on the reagent used for protodesilylation and the oxidizing agent, e.g., in the case of a Bronsted acid, hydrogen peroxide in the presence of KHCO3 and KF may be used, to provide compound 21.

Compound 19 is treated with a base such as a hydroxide, e.g., NaOH or KOH, or alkoxide such as KOtBu, in a polar aprotic solvent such«s DMF, DMSO, or NMP, or with a strong acid such as TFA, and heated at a time and temperature sufficient to achieve the conversion to intermediate 110. Compound 110 can then be oxidized with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of KHCO3 and KF in a solvent such as MeOH, to provide intermediate 114. Intermediate 114 can be debenzylated upon treatment with a Lewis acid such as BCI3, BBr3, etc., or a Bronsted acid such as MSA, TFMSA, etc., in solvent such as DCM, and the reaction mixture can be neutralized with base such as NaOH, to provide compound 21.

(Scheme Removed) <br>
In Process D of the invention, the ester of the formula 66 (Scheme 1) can be converted to the compound of formula 21 using different synthetic methods. In Process D, the ester of formula 66 is aminohydroxylated to provide a chiral oxazolidinone of the formula 67. After a series of synthetic steps, a pyrimidine carbocyclic nucleoside, the compound of formula 70 is prepared. The pyrimidine carbocyclic nucleoside can be elaborated to a purine containing compound, the methylene compound of formula 71 which is subsequently converted to the compound<br><br>
of formula 21 by, for example, the oxidation procedure described in the final steps of Processes B and C. One embodiment of Process D is depicted in Scheme 7.<br>
Aminohydroxylation conditions are used to convert the ester of formula 66 to the oxazolidinone of formula 67. Amino hydroxylation procedures are analogous to those described in Li, G.; Angert, H.; Sharpless, K.B. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., (1996), at 2813. Preferably, the aminohydroxylation conditions comprise treatment with: the reagent prepared from the treatment of methyl carbamate with tert-butyl hypochlorite and sodium hydroxide [i.e., MeOC(0)N(Cl)Na]; and potassium osmate in an inert solvent such as DCM. Alternative reagents include EtOC(0)N(Cl)Na and BnOC(0)N(Cl)Na. Preferably, the chiral oxazolidinone of formula 67 is formed in at least 96% de<br>
The primary alcohol moiety of the oxazolidinone of formula 67 can then be converted to an iodide. For instance, in one preferred procedure, the compound of formula 67 is treated with trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride (Tf20) in the presence a tertiary amine base such as pyridine, and subsequently treated with an iodide salt, e.g, hthium iodide. The resulting iodide of the formula 68 can then be converted to a methylene compound of formula 69 by a two step procedure. In the first step the iodide of formula 68 is treated with zinc powder and acetic acid. The ester moiety of the resulting intermediate can then be reduced to a primary alcohol in the second step by a hydride reagent such as sodium bis[2-memoxyemoxyaluminum] hydride to give the amine of the formula 69.<br>
The amine of the formula 69 is subsequently reacted with a substituted chloropyrirnidine. The amine can be condensed, for example, with 2-amino-6-chloro-5-nitro^-(3H)-pyrimidinone in the presence of a tertiary amine base, preferably triemylamine, in refiuxing n-butanol to give a pyrimidine compound of formula 70. The pyrimidine compound of formula 70 can then be converted to a purine derivative by a two step procedure. In the first step, the nitro moiety of the pyrimidine is reduced with, for example, sodium dithionite, to give a triammopyrimidine intermediate. Alternative reducing agents and conditions that can also successfully reduce the nitro group include NaBBLj/THF, NaBEU-BiCLj, Sn/HCl, SnCl2, Mg/(NH4)2SO4/MeOH, CuBr-SMe2, TiCl2(Cp)2/Sm, iron and nickel catalyzed<br>
procedures. In the second step, treatment of the Marrnnopyrimidine intermediate with formic acid, hydrochloric acid, and an orthoformate derivative, e.g., triethylorthoformate, effects cyclization and provides the methylene compound of formula 71. The methylene compound of formula 71 can be converted to the compound of formula 21 by the oxidation procedure described in the final steps of Processes B and C.<br>
PROCESS E<br>
SCHEME 8<br>
(Scheme Removed) <br>
Process E of the invention comprises using an alternative carbocyclic sugar precursor, an allylic alcohol of the formula 16, to prepare the compound of formula 21. Process E is similar to Processes B and C as all three processes use cyclopentane epoxide intermediates to accomplish a coupling reaction with a guanine precursor. In a first embodiment of Process E, the protecting group that serves to protect the<br>
secondary alcohol of the cyclopentane ring of 16 is a benzyl/substituted benzyl ether, while in a second embodiment a silyl ether protecting group (RcRd2Si) protects the same secondary alcohol. (In this instance, Rc is linear or branched Q to C4 alkyl, or phenyl, and Rd is linear or branched  C1 to C3 alkyl.) A preferred benzyl ether protecting group is benzyl ether, per se, while a preferred silyl ether is tert-butyldimethyl silyl ether. The difference in these protecting groups changes the identity of the intermediates for the different embodiments of Process E. Certain embodiments of Process E are depicted in Scheme 8.<br>
In one embodiment of Process E, the allylic alcohol of formula 16 is obtained through a reduction of the ester of the formula 7. The ester of the formula 7, wherein R and R' are as defined above, can be obtained by Processes E(a)-E(d) that are described below. The ester of formula 7 can be reduced with hydride reagents that selectively effect 1,2-reduction of the ester. For example, in one embodiment, diisobutylaluminum hydride reduces the ester group and provides the allylic alcohol of the formula 16.<br>
The allylic alcohol of formula 16 can then be diastereoselectively epoxidized. For example, the epoxidation can be accomplished using a homocbiral diester of tartaric acid, a hydroperoxide, and a metal catalyst, such as a transition metal catalyst to yield a cyclopentane epoxide of the formula 17. In one embodiment, the homochiral diester is (-)-diethyl tartrate [(-)-DETJ, the hydroperoxide is TBHP or CHP, and the metal catalyst is titanium (TV) isopropoxide. Preferably, the reaction is carried out in an inert solvent such as DCM.<br>
The epoxide of formula 17 can be subsequently coupled to an alkali metal salt (e.g., lithium) of a purine compound of formula 28, wherein X is CI, I or BnO, in a dipolar aprotic solvent such as DMF to afford the compound of formula 18. Preferably the coupling of the cyclopentane epoxide of the formula 17 is conducted with the lithium salt of 2-amino-6-benzyloxypurine. The compound of formula 18, wherein X is benzyloxy, can be purified by crystallization from solvents such as ethyl acetate and hexanes. Typically the yield of the coupling step after purification is at least 75%.<br>
The vicinal diol moiety of the compound of formula 18 can then be converted to an alkene moiety. For example, the diol moiety can be converted to an alkene by procedures that are analogous to those used in Processes B and C. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the compound of formula 18 can be treated with an orthoformate derivative, e.g, trimethyl orthoformate, in the presence of a catalytic amount of an acid such as TFA or PTSA, or acid catalyst such as PPTS. The resulting mixture of dioxolanes (preferably as a crude mixture) is heated with a mixture of acetic anhydride and optionally acetic acid to provide the methylene compound of formula 19. Alternatively, this reaction can be performed in the presence of antioxidant such as BHT as described previously. In the instance of the second embodiment of Process E (where the secondary alcohol of 18 is protected by a silyl ether group), the silyl ether protecting group is simultaneously hydrolyzed during the acetic anhydride/ acetic acid treatment step (i.e., R' is H in the methylene compound of formula 19).<br>
In embodiments of the Process E, wherein X is OBn, the 6-O-benzyloxy group can be hydrolyzed (as well as any pendant 2-acetamide group formed from the acetylation of the 2-amino group of the purine during the acetic anhydride treatment step) by heating the compound of formula 19 with aqueous mineral acid, such as 2 N HC1 to give the methylene compound of formula 20. In embodiments of Process E, wherein X is CI or I, the 6-halo group can be hydrolyzed by treatment with aqueous acid or base (e.g., aqueous hydroxide solution). Removal of the remaining benzyl ether protecting group(s) on the cyclopentane ring, such as by boron trichloride treatment in an inert solvent, e.g., DCM, provides the compound of formula 21.<br>

Preferably the enzyme used is a hydrolase such as Lipase PS-30 from Pseudomonas cepacia or Pancreatin. Preferably the enantiomeric excess of the product monoacetate of formula 3 is at least 96% ee, more preferably at least 98% ee.

The reaction is typically carried out in a mixture of a buffer and an organic solvent, preferably having a buffer/organic solvent ratio of about 3/1 to about 20/1, preferably about 9:1. The buffer" is selected to have a buffering range effective to maintain the pH of the reaction mixture in a range effective to support enzyme catalysis, such as at about pH=7. For example, 25 mM potassium phosphate buffer can be used. In one embodiment the organic solvent is toluene.<br>
The monoacetate of formula 3 can be coupled to phenylsulfonylnitromethane to provide a compound of formula 4. The coupling is preferably catalyzed by a palladium (0) catalyst such as tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium in THF with a tertiary amine base, such as triethylamine. The secondary hydroxy! group of the compound of formula 4 is protected using a benzyl halide and a non-nucleophilic strong base such as sodium hydride to give the dibenzyl compound of formula 5. The dibenzyl compound of formula 5 can be oxidized, such as with potassium peroxymonosulfate: tetrabutyl ammonium, preferably in a solvent mixture of DCM and MeOH. The intermediate carboxylic acid can be esterified, for example, by directly heating with an alcohol (ROH), preferably MeOH, and sulfuric acid in the same reaction vessel to afford the ester of formula 6.<br>
Isomerization of the double bond provides the desired ester of formula 7. The isomerization can be accomplished by heating the crude ester of formula 6 under basic conditions. Preferably the basic conditions comprise heating the ester with a sodium alkoxide/alcohol mixture. As will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art, the alkoxide and alcohol mixture are preferably selected so that transesterification of the ester moiety during the isomerization is minimizd or eliminated. By way of example, if a methyl ester is desired for the compound of formula 7 (i.e., R=methyl) then the basic conditions chosen for the isomerization are preferably sodium methoxide/MeOH. The ester of formula 7 can be purified by recrystallization from a mixture of solvents such as hexanes and tert-butyl methyl ether.<br>

(Scheme Removed) <br>
Process E(d) can also be used to prepare the ester of formula 7, wherein R' is benzyl or silyl. Embodiments of Process E(d) are depicted in Scheme 12. In the process, the allylic alcohol of formula 9 is oxidized with an oxidizing reagent such as pyridinium dichromate (PDC), pyridinium chlorochromate, manganese dioxide, and the like, in an inert solvent, preferably DCM, to afford the cyclopentenone of formula 80.

The intermediate from the reduction is trapped with an activated trifluoromethanesulfonic acid derivative such as N-phenyltriflimide to provide the triflate of the formula 81. An alkyloxycarbonyl group is then inserted onto the ring using, for example, a palladium catalyzed carbonyl insertion reaction to prepare the ester of formula 7. Preferably the insertion reaction is performed in a mixture of DMF and an alcohol, preferably MeOH, with an excess amount of a tertiary amine base, such as triemylamine. A preferred catalyst for the reaction is a palladium (0) catalyst, e.g., tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium.<br>

The methylene compound of formula 38 can then be elaborated to the compound of formula 21. One embodiment of Process F is depicted in Scheme 13.<br>
The cyclopentenone of formula 32 (also known as 4-(S)-hydroxy-2-cyclopenten-l-one) serves as starting material for Process F. The cyclopentenone can be obtained according to procedures described in Khanapure, S.; Najafi, N.;<br>
Manna, S.; Yang, J.; Rokash. J. J. Org. Chem., 1995, 60, 7448. The alcohol moiety of the cyclopentenone of formula 32 can be protected as a silyl ether using the silylating reagent of the formula RcRd2SiY (wherein Rc, Rd and Y are as defined in Process E and E(d)). For example, the alcohol moiety of the cyclopentenone of formula 32 can be protected as a tert-butyldimethylsilyl ether using tert-butyldimethylsiryl chloride (TBSC1), a tertiary amine base such as N,N-dimethylemylamine, and a catalytic amount of 4-N,N-dimethylaminopyridine in an inert solvent such as DCM to give the cyclopentenone of formula 33. The cyclopentenone of formula 33 can then be treated with a Grignard reagent prepared from a (halomethyl)dialkylphenylsilane of the formula RaRb2SiCH2X' (wherein Ra and Rb are as described above for Process A, and X' is CI, Br, or I) and magnesium, in the presence of copper (T) salt such as Cu (I) bromide dimethylsulfide complex. In one embodiment, (chloromethyl)-dimethylphenylsilane is used to prepare the Grignard reagent A trimethylsilylating reagent such as chlorotrimethylsilane (TMSC1) can be used to treat the intermediate enolate to form the silyl enol ether of formula 34. The resulting silyl enol ether is hydroxymethylated, for example by using aqueous formaldehyde in the presence of a Lewis acid, e.g., Yb(OTf)3, La(OTf)3, Pr(OTf)3, Nd(OTf)3, Sm(OTf)3, Eu(OTf)3, Eu(OTf)3, Gd(OTf)3, Dy(OTf)3, Ho(OTf)3, or Er(OTf}3 in THF to give the compound of formula 35.<br>
The compound of formula 35 can be dehydrated by reacting the compound with a sulfonylating agent of the formula R3SOaCl, wherein R3 is C1 to C6 alkyl, trifluoromethyl, phenyl, or substituted phenyl (substituted by C1 to C6 alkyl and/or C1 to C6 alkoxy) in the presence of a tertiary amine base, e.g., triethylamine, and then eliminating the intermediate sulfonate by addition of a strong base, preferably DBU, to give the methylene compound of formula 36. Preferably the sulfonylating agent used is methanesulfonyl chloride. The carbonyl moiety of the methylene compound of formula 36 can be reduced by hydride reagents that selectively effect 1,2 -reduction of the carbonyl group and provides the allylic alcohol with high diastereoselectivity. These hydride reagents include sodium borohydride, zinc borohydride, hthium durninum hydride, dusobutylaluminum hydride, sodium borohydride-cerium chloride, hthium triethylborohydride, hthium<br>

The carbonyl group can be reduced, for example, with lithium triethylborohydride in THF to give the crude allylic alcohol of formula 37 in 95% yield in an 8:1 diastereomeric ratio. The crude product is purified, for example, using silica gel chromatography to isolate the desired diastereomer of the allylic alcohol of the formula 37.<br>
The allylic alcohol of formula 37 is condensed with 2-amino-6-iodopurine (purine compound of formula 28, wherein X is I) under Mitsonobu conditions. Alternatively, other guanine precursors, such as 2-amino-6-chloropurine and 2-amino-6-O-benzyloxypurine can be used in the condensation. Preferred Mitsonobu conditions include treatment of the allylic alcohol with about 1.3 molar equivalents each of triphenylphosphine, DEAD, and 2-amino-6-iodopurine in THF. The product of the Mitsonobu reaction, the methylene compound of formula 38, can be further purified by, for example, silica gel chromatography.<br>
The methylene compound of formula 38 can be converted to the compound of formula 21. In one conversion method, the dialkylphenylsilane moiety of the methylene compound of formula 38 can be converted to a hydroxy moiety by oxidation procedures analogous to those used in Processes B and C. The silyl ether protecting group is simultaneously hydrolyzed during these procedures. For example, the methylene compound of formula 38 can be treated with tetrafluoroboric acid-dimethyl ether complex in DCM. After addition of potassium bicarbonate and potassium fluoride, the intermediate silanol from this reaction is oxidized with hydrogen peroxide to provide the compound of formula 39. The two reactions can be conveniently performed using a one-pot procedure. The 6-iodo group can be hydrolyzed by heating the compound of formula 39 with aqueous base such as a 2 N sodium hydroxide solution. After neutralization the aqueous solution can be heated with decolorizing carbon and allowed to crystallize to furnish the purified compound of formula 21.<br>

(Scheme Removed) <br>
Process G includes preparation of a cyclopentane epoxide of the formula 45, and coupling of the cyclopentane epoxide with a guanine precursor to give a carbocyclic nucleoside, the compound of formula 46. The compound of formula 46 can then be converted by a series of synthetic steps to the compound of formula 21. One embodiment of Process G is depicted in Scheme 14.<br>
In Process G, the cyclopentenone of formula 33 (prepared as described in Process F) can be iodinated, for example, by treatment with iodine solution. Preferably, the reaction solvent is a mixture of DCM and pyridine. The resulting iodo<br>
cyclopentenone intermediate is reduced, with a hydride reagent, for example, sodium borohydride in MeOH, to form the iodo compound of formula 40 in &gt;98% de The iodo compound of formula 40 can then be subjected to a carbonyl insertion reaction. For example, the allylic alcohol of formula 40 is reacted with carbon monoxide and an alcohol ROH wherein R is Cx to C4 alkyl or benzyl to form the ester of formula 41. Preferably, the insertion reaction is conducted with carbon monoxide and MeOH in the presence of a tertiary amine base, e.g., triemylamine, in a pressurized sealed reaction vessel. The reaction is preferably catalyzed by a palladium catalyst, e.g., dichloro bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium. The crude product from the insertion reaction can be purified by column chromatography to provide pure compound of formula 41.<br>
The secondary alcohol of the compound of formula 41 is acylated by treatment with an activated acid derivative of the formula R2C(0)-Y, and a base, preferably lithium hexamethyldisilazide. While other activated acid derivatives can be used (including alkyl and aryl acid derivatives) to form the acyl intermediate 42, adamantane carbonyl chloride is preferably used (i.e., R2=adamantane). With this preferred reagent, a more crystalline intermediate is obtained that is more easily purified and handled. The intermediate of formula 42 is subjected to allylic displacement by treatment with the Grignard reagent prepared from a (halomethyl)dialkylphenylsilane of the formula RaR  SiCH2X' (wherein Ra and Rb are as described above for Process A, and X' is CI, Br, or I) and magnesium, in the presence of copper (I) salt such as Cu (1) iodide. In one embodiment, (chloromethyl)-dimethylphenylsilane is used to prepare the Grignard reagent. The reaction product, the compound of formula 43, can be used in the next synthetic step without further purification.<br>
The compound of formula 43 can be reduced with a hydride reagent, such as diisobutylaluminum hydride in toluene, to provide the allylic alcohol of formula 44. Epoxidation of the crude allylic alcohol of the formula 44 provides the cyclopentane epoxide having the formula 45. For example, in one epoxidation method, the allylic alcohol is treated with aperacid, e.g., magnesium monoperoxyphthalate (MPPA) in MeOH, to prepare the cyclopentane epoxide. Using this method, the cyclopentane<br>
epoxide of formula 45 is of sufficient diastereomeric purity to be used in the next synthetic step without further purification.<br>
In the next step of Process G, the cyclopentane epoxide of formula 45 is converted to the compound of formula 46 by condensation with an alkali metal salt, e.g. lithium salt, of 2-amino-6-0-benzyloxypurine in a dipolar aprotic solvent, e.g., DMF. The lithium salt, for example, can be generated by reaction of 2-amino-6-benzyloxypurine with lithium hydride. The crude product from the condensation reaction can be purified by recrystallization from a suitable solvent, e.g., MeOH, to provide the pure compound of formula 46. Here again similar to Processes B and C, alkali metal salts of other guanine precursors, e.g., 2-amino-6-chloropurine, 2-arnino-6-iodopurine, can be used in place of 2-arnino-6-benzyloxypurine to couple with the cyclopentane epoxide of the formula 45.<br>
The diol moiety of the compound of formula 46 is then converted to an alkene. For example, the conversion to the methylene compound of formula 47 can be performed using a two step procedure. The compound of formula 46 is treated with an orthoformate derivative, preferably trimethylorthoformate, and a catalytic amount of an acid such as TFA or PTSA, or acid catalyst such as PPTS. The excess orthoformate reagent is evaporated, and the resulting mixture of dioxolanes is heated with acetic anhydride. The methylene compound of formula 47 is obtained after evaporation of the acetic anhydride and acid workup, which treatment also hydrolyzes the 6-0-benzyl-oxy group. In embodiments of Process G, wherein X is CI or I, the 6-halo group on the purine can be hydrolyzed using hydroxide solution, e.g., NaOH.<br>
The phenyldrmethylsilylmethyl group of the methylene compound of formula 47 can be converted to a hydroxymethyl moiety, for example, by the procedures described in Processes B, C, and F. For example, in one embodiment, the methylene compound of formula 47 can be treated with tetrafluoroboric acid-dimethyl ether complex in DCM to provide the silanol intermediate. Treatment of the silanol intermediate with potassium bicarbonate, potassium fluoride, and hydrogen peroxide provides the compound of formula 21.<br>
PROCESS H SCHEME 15  (Scheme Removed) <br><br>
In Process H of the invention, a bicyclic lactone, the compound of formula 52, is converted to a methylene compound of formula 56. The methylene compound of formula 56 is coupled with a guanine precursor such as 2-amino-6-chloropurine (purine compound of formula 28, X=C1) to give a carbocyclic nucleoside, the methylene compound of formula 57. The methylene compound of<br>
formula 57 is subsequently converted to the compound of formula 21 by deprotection and hydrolysis steps. Embodiments of Process H are depicted in Scheme 15.<br>

After quenching the reaction with, for example, MeOH, the compound of formula 53 can be directly reduced by treatment with a suitable hydride reagent such as sodium borohydride in MeOH, to reduce the lactone moiety and provide the compound of formula 53 A. The vicinal diol of the compound of formula 53A can be oxidatively cleaved by treatment with an oxidizing agent such as sodium periodate, potassium permanganate, or ruthenium oxide. The resulting aldehyde containing intermediate 53B can then be reduced with a suitable hydride reagent, e.g., sodium borohydride, to generate the diol of the formula 54.<br>
The primary alcohol moiety of the diol of formula 54 can be selectively converted to a suitable leaving group, preferably using a sulfonylating reagent having the formula R3SO2C1, wherein R3 is C1 to C6 alkyl, trifluoromethyl, phenyl, or substituted phenyl (substituted by C1 to C6 alkyl or C1 to C6 alkoxy). For example, the diol of formula 54 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl chloride (TsCl), a tertiary amine base such as pyridine, and a catalytic amount of 4-N,N-dimethylaminopyridine to convert the primary alcohol to a tosylate group. The secondary alcohol is protected as an ester by acylation with an acylating agent to provide the compound of formula 55. Preferably the secondary alcohol is protected by an acyl group of the formula R2C(=O)-, wherein R2 is alkyl, aryl, arylalkyl, any of which can be substituted. Most preferably, R~ is methyl so that the acyl protecting group in the compound of formula 55 is acetyl. A preferred acylating agent is an acylating agent of the formula R2C(0)Y, wherein Y is a leaving group. For example, the acylating agent can be an anhydride, acid chloride, and the like.<br>
The compound of formula 55 is treated with an iodide salt, e.g., hthiurn iodide, and a strong base such as DBU to effect elimination of the intermediate iodide. Hydrolysis of the acyl ester is carried out by direct addition of MeOH to the basic reaction mixture, providing the methylene compound of formula 56. The methylene<br>
compound of formula 56 can be further purified by, for example, silica gel chromatograpliy.<br>
The methylene compound of formula 56 serves as a suitable compound for coupling with a guanine precursor (purine compound of formula 28, wherein X is CI, Br or benzyloxy). For instance, the methylene compound of formula 56 is treated under Mitsonobu conditions with 2-amdno-6-chloropurine to give the methylene compound of formula 57. Preferably the Mitsonobu conditions comprise treatment with DEAD and triphenylphosphine. The methylene compound of formula 57 can be further purified by, for example, silica gel chromatography.<br>
The conversion of the methylene compound of formula 57 to the compound of formula 21 can be completed by deprotection of the silyl ether moieties and hydrolysis of the 6-X group on the purine moiety. The two silyl ether moieties are cleaved by treatment with fluoride ion (e.g., tetralkylammonium fluoride reagent such as tetrabutylammonium fluoride in THF) to give the compound of formula 39. In embodiments of the process wherein the purine moiety has a 6-chloro or iodo group, the 6-halo group is hydrolyzed by heating the compound of formula 39 with aqueous base or acid, preferably aqueous base, e.g., 2 N sodium hydroxide solution, to give the compound of formula 21. In embodiments of the process where X is a 6-0-ben2yloxy group, conversion to the 6-oxo group can be performed using acidic conditions, e.g. 2 N HC1. The compound of formula 21 can be further purified by, for example, silica gel chromatography.<br>

Med. Chem. 1993,36,243. The bicyclic lactone of formula 49 can be treated with paraformaldehyde in a mixture of glacial acetic acid and sulfuric acid to add formaldehyde across the double bond. This treatment yields a diacetate of formula 50. The diacetate of formula 50 is subsequently stirred with a base such as potassium carbonate in an alcohol solvent, e.g., MeOH, to hydrolyze the acetate moieties and provide the diol of the formula 51. The alcohol moieties of the diol of formula 51 can be protected as silyl ether groups by treating the diol with a silylating reagent of the formula RcRd2SiY (wherein Rc, Rd,<br>

Similar to Process H of the invention, Process I of the invention comprises preparation of a methylene compound of formula 56 from the homochiral bicyclic lactone intermediate, the compound of formula 52. The coupling of the methylene compound of formula 56 to a guanine precursor (purine compound of formula 28), and subsequent conversion of the resultant carbocyclic nucleoside to the compound of formula 21 are analogous to the methods used in Process H as well. The preparation of the methylene compound of formula 56 from the compound of formula 52,<br>
however, is achieved by different synthetic methods than those used in Process H. One embodiment of Process I is depicted in Scheme 16.<br>
In Process I, the lactone moiety of the compound of formula 52 is reduced under controlled reaction conditions to provide the lactol of formula 59. For instance, the compound of formula 52 can be treated with a hydride reagent, e.g., diisobutylaluminum hydride in toluene at 25°C to achieve reduction to the lactol oxidation state. The reduction product, the lactol of formula 59, is subsequently cleaved using an oxidizing agent, such as iodobenzene diacetate under UV irradiation (sun lamp) in DCM to give the iodide compound of formula 60. The iodide compound of formula 60 can be treated with a strong base such as DBU to effect elimination of the iodide moiety with removal of the formate ester upon water workup to yield the methylene compound of formula 56.<br>

The secondary alcohol moiety of 82 is protected as a silyl ether having the formula R'ft^SiO- wherein Rc and Rd are as described above in the description of Process E. In one embodiment, the secondary alcohol of 82 is protected as a tert-butyl dimethylsilyl ether. The primary alcohol is unmasked by catalytic reduction of the benzyl group of 83 with, for example, palladium on carbon to give the compound of formula 84. The compound of formula 86 is prepared by a base catalyzed elimination procedure. In the first step of the procedure, the primary alcohol of 84 is converted into a suitable leaving group, preferably using a sulfonating reagent having the formula R3SO2C1, wherein R3 is as described above in Process F, to give the compound having the formula 85. A strong base, e.g., potassium t-butoxide, in a suitable solvent, e.g. THF, is then used to effect the elimination of alkyl or (substituted) phenylsulfonic acid to provide the exocyclic methylene moiety in the compound of formula 86.<br>
A hydroxymethyl moiety is then installed on the cyclopentane ring adjacent to the exocyclic methylene moiety in the compound of formula 86 to give the compound of formula 87. To efficiently effect this transformation, a regioselective 1,2-addition of a carbon nucleophile to the epoxide of the compound of formula 86 is preferably conducted. Preferably, the carbon nucleophile is a carbanion of 1,3-dithiane, e.g., lithium salt of 1,3-dithiane, that adds to the allylic position to provide the compound of formula 87. The lithium salt of 1,3-dithiane can be generated with a strong non-nucleophilic base, e.g., n-butyl lithium, lithium diisopropylamide, lithium hexamethylsilazide, and the like in an ethereal solvent, e.g., THF. A chelating agent such as l,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) is preferably added to enhance the efficiency of the process. The reaction is preferably carried out below 25°C, more preferably below about -15°C to ensure high regioselectiviry. Preferably, the regioselectivity of the addition is &gt;10:1, more preferably &gt;15:1.<br>
The dithianylmethyl group of the compound of formula 87 is readily converted to an alcohol by a hydrolysis reaction followed by a reduction reaction. The hydrolysis to an intermediate aldehyde is carried out, for example, by stirring a<br>
mixture of compound of formula 87 with calcium carbonate and iodomethane in aqueous acetonitrile. Other methods for hydrolyzing dithioacetals are well known in the art and include methods recited in Greene, T.W.; Wuts, P.G.M. Protecting Groups in Organic Syitthesis 2nd Edition; Wiley and Sons: New York, 1991, pp. 199-201.

The compound of formula 88 is converted to a compound suitable for coupling with a protected guanine derivative, by acylation of the alcohol groups. Acyl groups of the formula R2C(=O)- wherein R2 is as described above for Process H can serve as protecting groups. Preferably, R2 is methyl so that the acyl group is acetyl. The silyl ether group is then cleaved using fluoride ion, eg., tetraburylammonium fluoride, to give the methylene compound of formula 89.<br>
The compound of formula 89 is coupled to a suitable guanine precursor, e.g., 2-amino-6-iodopurine, to provide a carbocyclic nucleoside intermediate, the methylene compound of formula 90. In alternative embodiments, 2-amino-6-chloropurine or 2-amino-6-benzyloxypurine can be used as the guanine precursor. The methylene compound of formula 90, can be converted to the compound of formula 21 by suitable hydrolysis methods. For example, the ester groups can be cleaved by treatment with an alkali metal alkoxide, e.g. sodium methoxide, and the 6-halo group can be hydrolyzed by heating in aqueous base. In embodiments of the process wherein 2-ammo-benzyloxypurine is used as a guanine precursor, the 6-ben2yloxy group is hydrolyzed using acid, e.g., HC1.<br>
PROCESS K RESIN PURIFICATION Another aspect of this invention is the use of a resin adsorption process for isolation and purification of the compound of formula 21 or intermediates therefor. This process employs a crude mixture comprising compound 21 or a mixture comprising entacavir intermediate(s) and other reagents, such as, for example, an oxidative mixture resulting from the treatment of an intermediate for compound 21 with hydrogen peroxide in an oxidative desilylation reaction in the presence of KF and KHC03. Compound 21 is soluble in water at 2.2 mg/mL and more preferably<br>
below 1.5 mg/mL. Compound 21 and related compounds are adsorbed on the resin specifically while inorganic salts pass through. The resin bed is then washed with water to remove any additional salts and compound 21 or a compound related thereto (e.g., such as an intermediate or precursor) is eluted from the resin via washing with an organic solvent. In one embodiment, the organic solvent comprises a mixture of MeOH and water, preferably 40-60% MeOH:40-60%water, more preferably 45-55% MeOH:45-55%water, even more preferably 50:50 MeOH and water, as 50% MeOH provides optimal separation of compound 21 or compound related thereto which is then concentrated and crystallized to obtain a pure compound. As use herein, by "pure" it is meant a compound having greater than or equal to 97%, or more preferably 99%, purity. Most preferred is a compound wherein all impurity peaks are less than 0.1 area percent as determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).<br>
Resins suitable for use in this adsorption process are hydrophobic resins with selectivity for non-polar molecules. In one embodiment, the resin is styrene-based. More preferably, the styrene-based resins are brominated to provide for greater strength and abrasion resistance. Exemplary resins with such properties include, but are not limited to, SP207 Sepabeads, SP700 Sepabeads, Diaion HP20, Diaion SP70, Diaion SP825, Diaion SP850, Diaion HP2MG methacrylate, AMBERLITE XAD4, AMBERIJTEXAD7HP,AMBERLITEXAD16,andAMBERLITEXAD1600. In a preferred embodiment, SP207 is used as the resin as this resin exhibits abrasion resistance, long-term recycling utilization, and the ability to withstand extremes of organic solvent conditions, temperatures, and pH, to be particularly useful in purification of compound 21 and compounds related thereto.<br>

A butyllithium solution (2.5 M in hexane, 4.8 mL, 12 mmol) was added to a solution of 1,3-dithiane (1.5 g, 12 mmol) in THF (22 mL) at 0°C under nitrogen. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 h and then cooled to 0°C. The above solution was slowly added to a solution of vinylepoxide 86 (2.3 g, 10 mmol) in THF (40 mL) at -30°C. The mixture was stirred at -30°C for 3 h and then warmed up to room temperature. The reaction was quenched by addition of hexane (80 mL) and 5% aqueous KH2PO4 solution (70 mL). The organic layer was separated, washed with brine (60 mL x 2), and dried (Na2SO4). Concentration of the solution followed by purification with silica gel chromatography gave 3.06 g (88%) of dithiane 87 as a white solid<br>
PREPARATION OF 4-(tert-Butyl-dimethyl-silanvloxy')-2-hydroxymethyl-3-methylene-cyclopentanol (88) (R=tert-butyl, RdCH3) A mixture of dithiane 87 (0.60 g, 1.7 mmol), calcium carbonate (1.3 g, 13 mmol), and iodomethane (2.4 g, 16.4 mmol) in acetonirrile-water (94:6, 8 mL) was stirred at room temperature for 16 h. Ethyl acetate (10 mL) and hexane (10 mL) were added to the reaction mixture which was then dried over sodium sulfate. The solid was removed by filtration. Concentration of the filtrate provided a crude aldehyde which was then dissolved in ethanol and cooled to 0°C. Sodium borohydride (120 mg, 3.2 mmol) was added at 0 0°C. The mixture was stirred at 0°C for 1 h. The reaction was quenched with a saturated aqueous KH2PO4 solution (5 mL) and water (5mL). Ethanol was removed by evaporation under vacuum. The aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate (15 mL x 2). The combined organic layers were dried (Na2SO4). Concentration of the solution followed by purification with silica gel chromatography gave 301 mg (67%) of the diol 88.<br>
PREPARATION OF Acetic acid 2-acetoxymethyl-4-hydroxy-3-methylene-cyclopentvl ester (89) (R2=CH3)<br>
Acetic anhydride (250 mg, 2.5 mmol) was added to a mixture of diol 88, DMAP (10 mg, 0.08 mmol), and triethylamine (360 mg, 3.6 mmol) in DCM (5 mL) under nitrogen at room temperature. After 3 h at room temperature, the reaction mixture was treated with hexane (10 mL), ethyl acetate (5 mL), and half saturated brine (10 mL). The organic layer was separated, washed with half saturated brine (10 mL), and dried (Na2SO4). Concentration of the solution gave a crude bis-acetate which was dissolved in THF (10 mL). Tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF.3H20, 400 mg, 1.3 mmol) was added to the solution at room temperature. After 1 h, the reaction mixture was treated with ethyl acetate (20 mL) and then washed with brine (15 mL x 2). The aqueous layers were back-extracted with ethyl acetate (15 mL). The combined organic layers were dried (Na2SO4). Concentration of the solution followed by purification with silica gel chromatography gave 255 mg (96%) of the desired alcohol 89 as an oil.<br>
PREPARATION OF Acetic acid 2-acetoxvmemyl-4-(2-amino-6-iodopurin-9-yl)-3-methvlene-cyclopentvl ester (90) (R2   =CH2  X=I) A mixture of alcohol 89 (100 mg, 0.44 mmol), triphenylphosphine (137 mg, 0.52 mmol), and 6-iodo-2-aminopurine (115 mg, 0.44 mmol) in THF was cooled to 0°C. DEAD (87 mg, 0.50 mmol) was slowly added to the mixture which was stirred at 0°C for 3 h and then warmed up to room temperature for 16 h. The mixture was treated with ethyl acetate (9 mL) and filtered on diatomaceous earth (Celite®). Concentration of the filtrate provided a residue which was treated with ethyl acetate (3 mL), 2 N HC1 (4 mL), and hexane (6 mL). The aqueous layer was separated. The organic layer was extracted with 2 N HC1 (4 mL x 3). The combined aqueous layers was neutralized with K2HPO4 to pH ~7 and extracted with ethyl acetate (25 mL, 10 mL). The combined organic layers were dried (Na2SO4) and concentrated to give a crude product which was purified by silica gel chromatography to provide 175 mg (85%) of 90 containing some triphenylphosphine oxide. Crystallization of the crude product from ethanol gave 132 mg (64%) of desired 90.<br>
The compound of formula 90 can be converted to the compound of formula 21 by hydrolysis of the ester group using, for example, by treatment with an alkali metal<br>
alkoxide. The 6-iodo group can be hydrolyzed to provide the compound of formula 21, according to the procedure described for the preparation of compound of formula 21 in Example 11.<br>
