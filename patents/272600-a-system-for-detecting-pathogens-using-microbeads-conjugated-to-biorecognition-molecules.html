				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to the field of detecting pathogens. In particular, it relates to a system and method for detecting, identifying, characterizing and surveilling pathogen and host markers, collecting and disseminating information concerning those pathogens and their hosts in real time to and from an instant location, providing instantaneous treatment recommendations and educational information.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0002] Detection and characterization of an infectious disease is a complex process that ideally begins with the identification of the causative agent (pathogen). This has traditionally been accomplished by direct examination and culture of an appropriate clinical specimen. However, direct examination is limited by the number of organisms present and by the observer's ability to successfully recognize the pathogen. Similarly, in vitro culture of the etiologic agent depends on selection of appropriate culture media as well as on the microbe's fastidiousness. The utility of pathogen culture is further restricted By lengthy incubation periods and limited sensitivity, accuracy and specificity.<br>
[0003]	When in vitro culture remains a feasible option, the identification and<br>
differentiation of microorganisms has principally relied on microbial morphology and growth variables which, in some cases, are sufficient for strain characterization (i.e. isoenzyme profiles, antibiotic susceptibility profiles, and chematographic analysis of fatty acids).<br>
[0004] If culture is difficult, or specimens are not collected at the appropriate time, the detection of infection is often made retrospectively, if at all, by demonstrating a serum antibody response in the infected host. Antigen and antibody detection methods have relied on developments in direct (DFA) and indirect (IFA) immunofluorescence analysis and enzyme immunoassay (EIA)-based techniques, but these methods can also possess limited sensitivity.<br>
[0005] These existing methods have several drawbacks. First, the process can take several days to return results. In the case of highly communicable and/or dangerous pathogens, confirmation of pathogen type may not be received until the host has already exposed others or has passed beyond treatment. Second, the transportation of samples to laboratories for culture growth increases the risk of errors, such as misidentifying the sample, or exposure of unprotected personnel to a sample containing a highly communicable pathogen. Thirdly, the pathogen tests are limited based on the suspected pathogen list provided by the observer (i.e. doctor), meaning that additional unsuspected pathogens are not tested for but may be present.<br>
[0006] Related to this method of diagnosis is the response to an outbreak of infectious disease. If an outbreak is suspected or detected, the existing response is the hundreds of years old method of quarantine. In cases of infectious disease outbreaks for which appropriate treatments and/or sensitive, specific, and rapid screening/diagnostic tests are lacking, quarantine remains the only means of preventing the uncontrolled spread of disease. When infection is suspected simply based on epidemiological grounds, or even based on comparable disease presentation, healthy or unexposed individuals may be quarantined along with infected individuals, elevating their likelihood of contracting the disease as a consequence of quarantine. Availability of a rapid confirmatory test for the pathogen in question would greatly reduce the time spent in quarantine, and would therefore reduce the likelihood of contacting the disease from truly infected persons.<br>
[0007]	Although quarantine remains a method of last resort for protecting public<br>
health, delays in providing a correct diagnosis, and subsequently appropriate treatment, occur on a daily basis in hospitals and physician's offices alike. The problem stems from the fact that many diseases have very similar clinical presentations in the early stages of infection, and in the absence of a thorough patient/travel history, malaria or SARS for example, can be misdiagnosed as the common flu (i.e. fever, chills), albeit with potentially fatal consequences. Had a multi-pathogen test which differentiates diseases with similar presentations been available, a tragedy may have been averted.<br>
[0008] In contrast to reliance on morphological characteristics, pathogen genotypic and proteomic traits generally provide reliable and quantifiable information for the detection and characterization of infectious agents. Moreover, microbial DNA/RNA can be extracted directly from clinical specimens without the need for purification or isolation of the agent.<br>
[0009] On a global scale, molecular techniques can be applied in a high throughput manner in screening and surveillance studies monitoring disease prevalence and distribution, evaluation of control measures, and identification of outbreaks.<br>
[0010] Point-of-care diagnostic devices (PDDs) have been developed for a number of individual infectious diseases. In most cases these assays are immunochromatographic single colorimetric strip tests designed to detect a single infectious agent (either a pathogen-specific antigen or an antibody response to one) in a small volume of blood or serum.<br>
[0011] None of these current assays has the capability to detect multiple pathogens or simultaneously detect genomic and proteomic markers of multiple pathogens. Similar limitations exist for other rapid diagnostic assays. Since almost all these tests rely on a single visual colorimetric change for their readout, the opportunities to detect multiple pathogens are severely impeded and the majority of current PDDs are restricted to the detection of a single pathogen. Consequently, evaluating patients for potential infectious agents or testing a unit of blood for common transmissible agents requires multiple consecutive poirit-of-care tests to be performed, complicating clinical management, slowing results and significantly escalating costs.<br>
[0012] Many PDDs do not meet what are considered essential requirements including: ease of performance, a requirement for minimal training, the generation of unambiguous results, high sensitivity and specificity, the generation of same day results (preferably within minutes), relative low cost, and no requirement for refrigeration or specialized additional equipment.<br>
[00131 In summary, despite current availability of excellent diagnostic reagents (e.g. antibody and nucleic acid probes) that recognize specific targets for many microbial pathogens, the current strategies have inadequate performance characteristics. Contributing to this is the fact that these reagents are conjugated to organic dyes, gold-labelled particles or enzymes that lack sufficient sensitivity to be detected at the single molecule level. Furthermore, the current PDD platforms and detection schemes typically rely on single macroscopic colorimetric changes and are not well suited to the simultaneous detection of multiple pathogens.<br>
[0014)	More recent advances in molecular diagnostics, including real-time PCR<br>
combined with automated specimen processing, have addressed a number of the limitations of earlier "in-house" and non-standardized gene amplification assays. These assays represent a significant advance in detecting, quantifying, and characterizing many microbes and currently represent the "gold" or reference standard for infectious disease diagnostics for a number of pathogens. However, these assays are stall complex, expensive, and require specialized equipment, creating a number of barriers to their potential application at point-of-care.<br>
[0015] Finally, current genomic or proteomic detection strategies require a sample processing and technical commitment to one strategy or the other. There is no current capacity to simultaneously detect both antigenic targets for some pathogens and genetic targets for others. This limits the simultaneous detection of preferred pathogen-specific targets and presents a barrier to fully exploiting the complementary power of both strategies.<br>
[0016] A system is needed which enables pathogen detection, identification and characterization, as well as host characterization in a much more timely manner than existing methods. Preferably, such a system would support a modular pathogen selection platform, based on the specific needs of the caring physician or clinic in the context in which the device is used (i.e. for screening or diagnosis). Further, the system would also enable simultaneous detection, identification and characterization of multiple pathogens<br>
in a single sample whereby the pathogens are differentiated by optical pathogen-specific profiles stored in a pre-existing database.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
[0017|	According to an aspect of the invention there is provided a method of<br>
performing one or more of: detecting, identifying and characterizing pathogens and characterizing pathogen hosts using markers for pathogens and hosts, comprising the steps of: a) preparing a marker-detection medium containing signatures of the identity and characteristics of pathogens and optionally of hosts; b) collecting a sample from a host; c) combining the sample with the marker-detection medium and d) analyzing the signatures to detect, identify and characterize the pathogens, and optionally, characterize the host.<br>
[0018|	Preferably, the sample collected is a blood sample, although plasma, serum,<br>

Also preferably, each of the microbeads contains a unique combination of quantum dots to provide a unique optical barcode associated with each microbead for detecting unique pathogen-specific and / or host-specific signatures.<br>
[0019| ' Preferably, the analysis step comprises illuminating the microbead-pathogen sample with a laser as it flows through a microfluidic channel and collecting the resulting spectra with a spectrophotometer/CCD camera, photomultiplier tube and/or a collection of avalanche photodetectors (APDs). Each spectrum correlates with a previously assigned pathogen.<br>

[0024]	The method further includes detection of pathogen-conjugated microbeads in<br>
a flow stream propelled by electrokinetic or hydrodynamic flow through a microfluidic channel. As the barcoded beads pass a laser beam at one end of the channel, the spectra emitted by the quantum dots within the beads, (as part of the barcode), or outside the beads (as part of a bead-pathogen complex detection mechanism, which may include fluorophores as described below) are collected by a spectrometer/CCD camera system, photomultiplier tube and/or a collection of APDs and analyzed by appropriate software.<br>

[0074]	Other and further advantages and features of the invention will be apparent to<br>
those skilled in the art from the following detailed description thereof, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
[0075]	The invention will now be described in more detail, by way of example only,<br>
with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which like numbers refer to like elements, wherein:<br>
Figure 1 is a flow chart detailing the series of steps in the inventive method disclosed herein;<br>

Figure 3 is a block diagram of multiple devices communicating with a central database.<br>
Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
[0076]	Referring now to Figure 1, the present inventive method is described by a<br>
series of steps set out in a flowchart.<br>
[0077]	The first step 12 is to collect a sample from a host (e.g. a human, animal or<br>
environmental sample), preferably a blood sample, although plasma samples, serum samples, CSF, BAL, NP aspirates, NP swabs, sputum and other types of physical samples can be used, as appropriate. This sample is then analyzed 14 and a list of pathogens identified in the sample is generated 16. A GPS receiver 22 determines the location of the sample reader and thus, the sample. The list of identified pathogens and the location information are both sent 20 to a central database for storage and processing. Meanwhile, a list of treatment options is displayed at 18, based on the identified pathogens, for the operator's consideration.<br>
[0078]	The analysis 14 is performed by a pathogen detection device 30 as shown in<br>
Figure 2. This device 30 is portable, preferably hand-held, and has an outlet 32 for receiving a sample and a display 36 to show the list of detected pathogens within the sample. An input device 38, such as a keyboard, is also provided to enable scrolling and viewing of the display and input of additional information (field notes, etc.). Pathogens in a sample are identified based on matching of spectra to previously stored data corresponding to each pathogen supported by the device. The spectra database may be an internal database on the device 30 (kept in flash memory or similar storage to allow for updating) or retrieved by communicating with an external database. A GPS receiver 35 is also preferably located in the device 30, along with a display showing the GPS co¬ordinates. Ideally, all communication is conducted wirelessly for maximum range and portability. The pathogen detection device 30 is ideally capable of detecting multiple pathogen, multiple BRMs from the same pathogen as well as host markers within a single sample, and preferably markers of different types, such as protein-based markers and gene-based markers.<br>
[0079]	The  method of detection used  can  be varied  among  suitable available<br>
methods, however, a preferred method is the use of biorecognition molecules (BRMs)<br>
conjugated to quantum dot-doped microbeads or nanobeads/nanoparticles. Alternatives include single quantum dots or fluorophores conjugated to BRMs. Quantum dots, also known as semiconductor nanocrystals, are electromagnetically active nanotechnology-based particles, ranging in size from 2 nanometers (nm) to 8 nm. A particularly useful property of quantum dots is that they are fluorescent, that is they emit light after brief illumination by a laser. In addition, quantum dots of different sizes will fluoresce in different colors and the fluorescing color can be modified by the particle's shape, size and composition. BRMs are biological molecules that bind only to a single other biological molecule and are pathogen specific. For example, "antibodies" are BRMs that bind to proteins and "oligonucleotide probes" are BRMs that bind to complementary gene sequences (e.g. DNA or RNA). Pathogens and hosts have both unique and shared genetic and protein markers, and each marker can be bonded to by a specific BRM.<br>
[0080]	A niicrobead, which is a polystyrene (or similar polymer) bead that can be 100<br>
nanometers-10 micrometers in diameter and doped with a collection of quantum dots, is physically conjugated to a BRM. By introducing unique combinations of quantum dots of different sizes (i.e., colors) and at different concentrations into the microbeads, microbeads with thousands of distinctive combinations of quantum dot colors and intensities can be created. When a laser illuminates the microbeads, the quantum dots fluoresce to produce a distinctive combination of colors. These color combinations are an example of a barcode, in this case an optical bar code, analogous to a UPC symbol, and similar known types of imprinted barcodes. Since each BRM recognizes a distinct pathogen or host marker and each microbead has a unique barcode, each BRM-conjugated microbead provides a barcode for the specific pathogen or host marker recognized by its BRM. These BRM-conjugated microbeads, as well as BRM-conjugated quantum dots, may be lyophilized into a powder and provided in the sample analysis kit.<br>
[0081]	To differentiate between BRM-conjugated beads bound to pathogens and<br>
those that are not, an additional confinnatory detection signal in the form of anti-human IgG, and/or an anti-human IgM molecule, or a pathogen-specific antibody (i.e. anti-X antibody),  or an oligonucleotide  (complementary to a pathogen gene  of interest)<br>
conjugated to a fluorophore, is included. The readout of a successful pathogen detection test comprises the bead barcode signal and a second signal generated by the fluorophore.<br>
[0082]	One example of pathogen detection is an antigen capture system. The antigen<br>
capture system includes a capture antibody (i.e. a BRM) which is bound to the barcoded microbead which is responsible for capturing the antigen from the sample. A second antibody (detection antibody) which recognizes the pathogen antigen/protein then binds to the complex. This detection antibody is conjugated to a fluorophore. When the sample is analyzed, if the signal for the detection antibody is not detected, the pathogen does not register as detected, either because it is not present in the sample or because of assay failure. The latter case is eliminated if the correct signals from the positive control sample, i.e. detection of the appropriate bar code of the BRM-quantum dot-containing microbead run in parallel with all clinical tests are detected.<br>
[0083]	Another example of pathogen detection is an antibody capture system.  In the<br>
antibody capture system the BRM which is bound to the barcoded microbead is a pathogen-specific antigen or protein (natural, recombinant, or synthetic). The complementary antibody to the antigen, if present in the clinical sample would bind the antigen attached to the bead. This complex is recognized by the addition of a secondary (detection) anti-human antibody (Anti-Human IgM or Anti-Human IgG). This detection antibody is conjugated to a fluorophore. Again, when the sample is analyzed, if the signal for the detection antibody is not detected alongside the signal from the bead barcode the pathogen does not register as detected, either because it is not present in the sample, or due to assay failure. The latter case is eliminated if the expected signals from positive control sample, as mentioned above, register correctly.<br>
[0084]	Still another example of pathogen detection is a genomic analysis system.  In<br>
the genomic analysis system the BRM which is bound to the barcoded microbead is a pathogen-specific oligonucleotide (RNA or DNA) (1-25 bases in length). Upon addition to the sample, the oligonucleotide will hybridize to its complementary sequence on the pathogen gene. A second oligonucleotide sequence complimentary to a downstream portion of the gene of interest is subsequently added and will hybridize to the gene, if<br>
present. This second sequence is conjugated to a fluorophore. Again, when the sample is analyzed, if the signal for the second sequence is not detected, the pathogen does not register as detected, either because it is not present in the sample or because of assay failure. A correctly detected positive control sample as referred to above eliminates the latter scenario.<br>
100851	The biological (e.g. blood) sample is added to a vial, and different pathogen<br>
markers bind the various microbeads carrying specific pathogen BRMs. The combined sample is then washed or otherwise treated to remove extraneous matter and unattached microbeads. The detection antibodies conjugated to the fluorophores are then added to produce a bead-sample-detector complex.<br>
[0086]	The    bead-sample-secondary    detector    complex    is    flowed    through    a<br>
microfluidic channel via hydrodynamically or electrokinetically-driven flow and passed through a laser beam located at one end of the channel. The laser beam illuminates the quantum dots in the complex and the emitted wavelengths are guided to either a spectrometer/CCD system, photomultiplier tube and/or a series of APDs. Signal deconvolution software translates the signal and the corresponding optical code is compared to pathogen-specific spectra stored in the database of pamogens or host characteristics supported by the detection device. Then, a list of detected pathogens and pathogen and host characteristics is produced. The response time from the taking of the original biological sample to the production of the pathogen list can be measured in minutes.<br>
[0087]	Ideally, the pathogen detection device 30 is a portable, hand-held device with<br>
an integrated laser and spectrophotometer, photomultiplier tube and/or series of APD units, specifically designed PDMS microfluidic channel chips, a supply of BRM conjugated barcoded beads for identification of various pathogens as well as appropriate bead-pathogen complex detection markers (quantum dot, fluorophore, small bead labeled IgG/IgM/anti-pathogen antibodies or oligonucleotides). The device 30 may store a pathogen identity database on board, or access a remote database, preferably via the Internet, preferably wirelessly, and identify the pathogen from a remote, central database.<br>
If an on-board database is used, a communications system 34 for contacting and receiving updates from a larger, central database is provided.<br>
[0088] The pathogen detection device 30 may include a GPS tracking device which transmits specific geographic information, preferably wirelessly to the same central database.<br>
[0089]	Once the pathogen list is produced, the pathogen detection device 30 may<br>
additionally provide further information of value to the diagnosing doctor. Ideally, a treatment protocol is provided (step 18), including any special measures necessary to avoid communication of the pathogen. Other information, such as pathophysiology, disease history and bibliographic references can be provided, enabling the pathogen detection device 30 also to be used as an educational tool in the appropriate scenarios.<br>
[0090]	An outbreak scenario for use of the device in a standard pathogen detection<br>
setting follows. An airport is a point of entry representing a major pathogen travel vector, as well as presenting problems with implementing traditional detection and quarantine methods. By equipping medical staff with a number of pathogen detection devices as described herein, and a supply of microbead sample vials able to detect pathogens typically transmitted by travelers, incoming passengers can be processed on-site by taking a blood sample and injecting it into a sample vial. The analysis is performed by the pathogen detection device within minutes and the sampled passenger can be quickly released or redirected for treatment and observation, as necessary. While a single device is limited in processing capability, the ability to provide multiples of identical devices can enable processing of passengers in a matter of hours, not days. Faster processing allows appropriate treatment and quarantine measures to be taken earlier, and be more effective, reducing the probability of the pathogen spreading unchecked.<br>
[0091]	As an example, a pathogen detection device may contain BRM-conjugated<br>
barcoded microbeads for detection of three different pathogens, say, HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C. The microbeads associated with each pathogen have a separately identifiable barcode, for example, HIV may have red beads (e.g. detecting the antibody<br>
gp41 as indicator of HIV infection), Hepatitis B yellow beads (e.g. detecting the antibody NSP4 as indicator of Hepatitis B infection), and Hepatitis C red-yellow beads (e.g. detecting the antibody anti-NSP4 as indicator of Hepatitis C infection), and preferably all using orange probes-pathogen complex detection markers or any color-probe that is spectrally different than the color of the barcodes. Thus, the detection system can readily identify any detected pathogen merely by the wavelength (which identifies color) or intensity of the bead spectra.<br>
[0092]	From this model, the system can readily be expanded, for example, to five<br>
pathogens, adding, for example, pathogen detection microbeads for malaria and dengue virus. From there, extrapolation to more pathogens (10, 20, 100) is mostly limited by the ability to create a sufficient number of barcodes, which is based primarily on the doping of the microbeads and limits of the detection mechanism. As the number increases, barcodes may be based on intensity levels, as well as wavelength.<br>
100931	Detecting and providing a treatment protocol for a pathogen represents merely<br>
the first step in a potentially much larger process for tracking and controlling the spread of pathogens as shown in Figure 3. Tailoring the device to be modular and be able to detect either an array of pathogens (i.e. BRMs for multiple pathogens) with similar clinical presentations, act as a screening tool (e.g. for identifying individuals vaccinated for selected diseases) or allowing physicians or clinics to select the pathogens of interest in their particular communities, allows for unprecedented diagnostic flexibility at the bedside. Incorporation of multiple BRMs for the same pathogen enhances detection accuracy and overcomes the limitations associated with use of single BRMs for pathogen detection (i.e. mutations and strain differences which may result in false negative or false positive results). The test results data along with the geographic location data (but no other information about the patient e.g. name, address and other privacy-protected data) provided by the GPS unit, are transmitted to a central database 40. The information is preferably sent wirelessly, and immediately upon generation of the pathogen list (step 20). The central database 40 is in contact with a substantial number of pathogen detection devices 30 at any given time.<br>
[0094] The central database 40 can be local, national or global, or a combination of different databases of these types. Ideally, one top-level central database 40 is provided which receives information constantly from all devices 30 worldwide. Over time, the database becomes a repository of information on every pathogen supported by the detection platform lending itself to mining for, among others, frequency and global patterns of detection of pathogens, long-term pathogen trends (i.e. colonization of new territories), and correlations between pathogens and host markers which may indicate enhanced susceptibility or resistance to the disease.<br><br><br><br><br>
