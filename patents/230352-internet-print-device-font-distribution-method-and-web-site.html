				<td>INTERNET PRINT DEVICE FONT<br>
DISTRIBUTION METHOD AND WEB SITE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention concerns print devices. Print device, as<br>
used herein, encompasses printers and other devices including a font based<br>
print function, e.g., multi-function peripherals. The invention is directed to a<br>
distribution method for print device fonts and a web site for print device font<br>
distribution.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Print device fonts are important to users because a font is a<br>
primary component which defines the look of a document. A likely market<br>
exists to distribute print device fonts, but users, to a large extent, continue to<br>
rely upon fonts bundled with a print device when purchased and software<br>
generated fonts which are temporarily downloaded to a print device during a<br>
print job. The former situation restricts font choice, while the latter is<br>
inefficient. Studies show that print device-installed fonts improve performance<br>
by up to twenty percent compared to temporarily downloaded print device<br>
fonts. Performance gains are especially prominent in complicated character<br>
sets, such as Asian character sets.<br>
Three conventional methods largely define the state of the art for<br>
print device-installed font distribution. Print device manufacturers include a<br>
set of fonts in the print device ROM. Once bundled, such fonts are fixed and<br>
may become obsolete as operating system fonts change. In addition, users ate -<br>
often compelled to accept a set of unwanted fonts as a package with a print<br>
device. Additional font packages come in the form of plug-in accessories, e.g.,<br>
font cards. The plug-in accessory method of font distribution shares the same<br><br>
drawbacks as fixed ROM print fonts. Plug-in accessories also raise hardware<br>
compatibility issues and the distribution issues connected with a hardware<br>
product including, for example, slow distribution, prediction of demand,<br>
maintenance of inventories and installation support.<br>
A third method of font distribution is generally referred to as a<br>
semi-permanent download. A user acquires fonts for the user's operating<br>
system. The user, using an external resource manager program, may then<br>
download selected fonts semi-pErmancmly to storage on the print device<br>
independent of a particular print job. Once downloaded in this manner, the<br>
font appears to be permanent in that it remains available to multiple print jobs,<br>
but may be erased using the external resource manager. HP Resource Manager<br>
is an example of Such a program. The fonts are loaded to a flash memory, a<br>
disk memory, RAM, or similar memory, and become available for use by<br>
subsequent print jobs. Installing the fonts is a complicated process, however,<br>
requiring an installer to convert the font from its native format into a print<br>
device specific format, download it to the print device, and configure the driver<br>
or other software on the operating system to use the newly installed font. The<br>
program which downloads to the print device may be incompatible with certain<br>
fonts and formats. The fonts may also be incompatible with certain print<br>
devices.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is directed to an Internet print device font<br>
distribution method and web site. Font users are visitors to a web site which<br>
allows browsing and obtaining of fonts, either individually or in groups.<br>
Visitors access the web site via conventional connections with a client<br>
computer and software. Preferably, purchases are made through the web site,<br>
but the method may allow installation of fonts through the web site as a result<br>
of other authorizations, e.g., an electronic coupon for visitors or a tie-in to other<br><br>
products, services, and web sites. Web site functions include operating system<br>
compatibility matching. The web site obtains configuration information to<br>
insure compatibility of a font to a visitor's configuration. Software on the web<br>
site downloads, installs and configures fonts on the visitor's print device.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, a web storefront is a web site<br>
advertising fonts for sale. The site permits viewing, selection and authorized<br>
installation of fonts from a set of print device-ready fonts. A preferred form of<br>
authorized installation includes a purchase through the web site. Fonts<br>
available on the web site are pre-tested and matched to print device models of<br>
common manufacturers and operating configurations to insure that each font<br>
has a defined set of workable installations. The site accesses, and may display,<br>
a database of configuration and performance information for multiple print<br>
device products. Visitors may be informed of potential estimated performance<br>
gains resulting from the installation of selected fonts. Information about the<br>
visitor's system configuration is obtained, e.g., operating system version, CPU<br>
type and speed, driver versions, print device models, and frequently used<br>
operating fonts. The site may obtain this information automatically by<br>
software which inspects the visitor system, it may obtain the information<br>
through having the visitor complete a form, or it may use a combination of<br>
manual and automatic information gathering. Automatic information gathering<br>
involves software that interacts with the client software/computer of a visitor to<br>
the web site. Purchased fonts are transferred to the visitor's system via<br>
interaction with the client software and computer. Software installs and<br>
configures the fonts onto the visitor's print device.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The invention provides a print device font distribution method in<br>
which fonts are distributed via the Internet. A novel business model for font<br>
distribution is thus provided, as well as a novel web site. The method and web<br>
site of the invention may be provided by or with the cooperation of a print<br>
device manufacturer or by an independent font provider. Fonts may be<br>
distributed by the invention as a replacement or a supplement to the<br>
conventional methods for print device font installations. Print device<br>
manufacturers might choose to provide fewer pre-installed fonts and rely upon<br>
custom distribution via distribution according to the invention. Distribution by<br>
the invention also may form a potential new e-commerce model for print<br>
device font sales, with fonts being selected, purchased, and installed via a web<br>
site.<br>
Aspects of conventional web site and e-commerce technology,<br>
ranging from the web site interface itself to database software relied upon by<br><br>
the web site, will be useful in practical embodiments of the invention.<br>
Additional conventional software useful to implementation of the invention<br>
might include, for example, web site financial transaction software and<br>
customer database software. The following description accordingly focuses on<br>
the novel functions of the print device font distribution method and web site of<br>
the invention. Many practical embodiments of the invention making use of<br>
conventional web site software will be apparent to artisans in light of the<br>
following description.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 1, an exemplary computer system for<br>
implementation of the invention is shown. A client computer 10 includes, at<br>
least, a print application, a web browser, and a print device driver that controls<br>
print jobs to a print device 12. The client 10 and print device 12 might be<br>
stand-alone machines or part of a network with other computers and devices.<br>
Memory in the print device 12 typically includes a set of installed fonts<br>
available to a print application in the client computer 10. The web browser in<br>
the client computer 10 provides Internet access to a universe of web server<br>
computers, including a web host 16 configured according to the invention to<br>
implement a print device font distribution of the invention via a web site of the<br>
invention hosted by the web host 16. Connections made by the client computer<br>
10 are generally represented in FIG. 1, and may include any form of networked<br>
or direct connection to the print device 12 and the web host 16.<br>
Access to the print device font distribution web site hosted by the<br>
web host 16 may be initiated directly by a user of the client computer 10,<br>
automatically or semi-automatically as part of an initial installation or upgrade<br>
to the print device 12, or by software program in the client computer 10. The<br>
web site will guide and assist font selection and installation with an appropriate<br>
set of menus and graphical user interfaces. Such a web site is maintained to<br>
facilitate selection from a set of print device-ready fonts through the client<br>
computer 10.<br><br>
Referring now to FIG. 2, a web site hosted by the web host 16 is<br>
visited 18 by a user of a client computer, and the user thereby becomes a visitor<br>
to the web site. This visit may be initiated by an number of actions which<br>
trigger a connection to access the web site via a web browser on the client<br>
computer 10 that addresses the web site on the web host 16. For example, but<br>
without being limited thereto, the web site might be accessed as part of a print<br>
device set-up program, in response to a link on another web site, in the How of<br>
a print application in the client computer 10, or directly by a user of the client<br>
computer 10. Access to the web site might also be triggered by the print device<br>
12 itself in response, for example, to a request for a print job using an<br>
unavailable font. Any such form of access to the web site is treated as a visit to<br>
the web site, with the possibility of a client computer or print device being<br>
treated as a visitor to the web site. Separate web sites, or a web site accessible<br>
through use of multiple URL addresses, might be maintained on the web host<br>
16 and help determine how the web applications on the web host 16 will<br>
interact with the client -of a particular visitor to the web site.<br>
Initial access to the web site might be responded to with none or<br>
any number of preliminary steps to confirm that a particular client computer or<br>
user of the same wishes to view, shop, install or purchase any number of fonts.<br>
Once the main web site on the client computer 10 is then entered, software on<br>
the web host 16 obtains information concerning the print device system<br>
configuration of the client 10 and print device 12 of a visitor. First, software<br>
determines 20 whether an automatic analysis of the system configuration is<br>
possible. If so, software automatically determines 22 the printing system<br>
configuration. The information obtained by the step of automatically<br>
determining the printing system information might include information such as<br>
the operating system type and version, print device driver type, print device<br>
brand, print device model, CPU type, CPU speed, print device driver versions,<br>
frequently used operating fonts and any other information useful in ensuring<br><br>
that a selected font may be properly installed and utilized by the printing<br>
system configuration of the particular client 10 and print device 12.<br>
The automatic determining of step 22 might be realized by<br>
launching software which obtains said information concerning a visitor's system<br>
automatically. The software could be software which inspects the system<br>
including client 10 and print device 12. Cookies may also be utilized for repeat<br>
visits by a particular client, and the cookie could include some or all of the<br>
necessary information for the step of automatically determining. In such case<br>
the automatic determining of step 22 would first obtain 23 information from a<br>
cookie stored on the client 10. Using the obtained print system configuration<br>
information, another application on the web host 16 can then analyze 24 font<br>
usage by the particular client 10 and print device 12 for performance. Such<br>
analysis can reveal whether currently used fonts are detrimental to performance<br>
and whether performance gains might be realized by installation of an available<br>
font or fonts. Where an automatic analysis is not possible, the web site can<br>
display forms to be filled in by a visitor. The visitor fills in a form 26 including<br>
print system configuration information of the type obtained by the step 22 of<br>
automatically determining the print system configuration information. Some<br>
combination of the step 22 of a visitor filling in a form and the step 22 of<br>
automatically determining can also be used with, for example, part of the form<br>
displayed to the visitor being automatically filled in allowing the user to accept<br>
or correct any information when filling in the form in step 26. The automatic<br>
system configuration step analysis 22 may therefore interact with the form of<br>
step 26.<br>
With information obtained by one or both of steps 22 and 26,<br>
software on the web host can then determine a set of fonts which may be<br>
selected to work based upon the print system configuration information.<br>
Preferably, software accesses a configuration database to determine an<br>
appropriate set of compatible fonts based upon the obtained information<br><br>
concerning a visitor's system configuration. Basic compatibility information<br>
can be used to recommend 28 fonts for transfer to the visitor. The<br>
recommended fonts are displayed in a suitable manner through the web<br>
browser on the client computer. Recommended fonts are chosen from an<br>
available set of print device ready fonts that are pre-tested and matched to print<br>
device models of common manufacturers and operating configurations. A<br>
more detailed recommendation might include potential performance gains that<br>
might be realized through the installation of available compatible fonts. To<br>
facilitate such a detailed recommendation, the configuration database may<br>
include configuration and performance data for multiple print device pro ducts<br>
and system configurations. Displayed recommendations can then include<br>
displaying potential estimated performance gains resulting from installation of<br>
a particular font.<br>
A visitor is allowed to select only compatible fonts. The visitor<br>
selects fonts 30 for transfer. The web site then authorizes transfer 31 of a<br>
selected one or multiple ones of visitor selected fonts. Both the authorization<br>
and visitor selection may be realized in different ways. With respect to the<br>
visitor selection, selection may comprise human involvement in the context of<br>
an authorization that involves a sale of a print device font and the selection of<br>
fonts from a displayed menu, for example. As one alternative, visitor selection<br>
might be part of program run as part of a print device installation, driver<br>
installation, or upgrade, where the authorization might be a code or other<br>
indicia. Various forms of authorization and font selection with varying levels<br>
of human involvement can thus be used to achieve different models of font<br>
distribution ranging from new print device installations to direct purchase. In<br>
the purchase model of font distribution through the web site on the web host<br>
16, the web site includes or links to a financial services interface and<br>
supporting software for handling electronic purchase transactions. In another<br>
model, an authorization code existing in an installed product, given as a<br><br>
promotion, or distributed in some other way produces an authorization for<br>
transfer. Yet another possible authorization scheme includes recognizing the<br>
visitor by some means, such as an examination of a cookie or recognition of a<br>
product serial number.<br>
Once a transfer is authorized, selected authorized fonts are then<br>
transferred 32 from the web site and web host 16 to the visitor, for example the<br>
user client 10 of FIG. 1. An installation process from the web site is then<br>
initiated to install the authorized selected font or fonts on the visitor's print<br>
device 12. A check is made from web site software to determine 34 whetheran<br>
automatic installation is possible. If such automatic installation is possible, the<br>
web site software then automatically installs 36 the font or fonts to the visitor's<br>
print device and automatically configures 38 the user's print system to use the<br>
newly installed fonts. Otherwise, the visitor will be prompted to run an install<br>
program 40 from the web site on the web host 16. Alternatively, the visitor can<br>
be prompted to run an install program from the visitor's client computer or the<br>
web host 16. Such interaction may be necessary, for example, if an automatic<br>
install is prevented by virus protection software. Another example involves<br>
display of a window requesting whether to trust content from the web host 16.<br>
A particularly preferred font purchase business method of the<br>
invention uses features of the web site font distribution method of FIG. 2 to<br>
permit purchase of fonts, with the authorization of step 32 taking the form of a<br>
financial transaction such as a web based credit card transaction. Referring to<br>
FIG. 3, the font purchase business method of the invention attracts user visits<br>
44 to a web site maintained for font purchase and distribution. The manner of<br>
attracting visitors could be varied. Common practices for advertising, linking,<br>
and otherwise directing visitors to the web site are acceptable. These practices<br>
might involve web-based techniques or might also utilize more traditional<br>
media, mailings, package inserts or other techniques to promote the web site.<br><br>
In FIG. 3, a preferred method for visitors to shop, view and<br>
obtain fonts is illustrated. Once a visitor visits a web site of the invention, the<br>
visitor is guided 46 through the selection of one or multiple fonts compatible<br>
with the particular visitor's print system configuration. At an appropriate time,<br>
an authorization check 48, as discussed with respect to FIG. 2, is conducted. A<br>
preferred form of authorization is purchase through a financial services<br>
interface presented by the web site. Once payment or other authorization is<br>
obtained, the web site installs 50 an authorized font or set of fonts.<br>
A web site used by the invention, as generally referenced in FIG.<br>
4, is realized by software preferably including a graphical interface 52 with the<br>
capability of generating relevant user interactive interfaces and menus. A set<br>
of system analysis tools 54 serves to facilitate analysis of a visitor's print system<br>
configuration to determine font compatibility and possibly performance. As<br>
discussed above, the analysis tools preferably operate automatically, when<br>
possible, and direct any necessary amount of web site visitor input through the<br>
graphical interface where complete automatic analysis is not possible.<br>
Database tools 56 include relational database structures containing information<br>
relevant to system and font analysis, including, for example, of confirmation<br>
information concerning font types, operating system type and version, print<br>
device driver type, print device brand, print device model, CPU type, CPU<br>
speed, print device driver versions, and print device models. Fonts for<br>
download and installation are stored in a font storage memory 58. The fonts in<br>
memory 58 should be pre-tested and matched to common models of print<br>
device manufacturers and operating configurations. Installation tools<br>
accomplish authorized downloads and installations of fonts from the font<br>
storage memory 58. Authorization, in a preferred embodiment, may come<br>
from financial services tools 62 which provides software to process secure<br>
payment for purchased fints. In other cases, the financial services tools 62<br>
might also provide software to process other forms of authorization, e.g.,<br><br>
authorization codes and product upgrades based upon model and brand.<br>
General utilities 64 are any necessary or desirable conventional web site tools<br>
such as security tools and tools for linking to other web sites or hosts. The site<br>
may reserve some of the utilities for use by a system administrator while<br>
presenting others to visitors.<br>
While various embodiments of the present invention have been<br>
shown and described, it should be understood that other modifications,<br>
substitutions and alternatives are apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
Such modifications, substitutions and alternatives can be made without<br>
departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, which should be<br>
determined from the appended claims.<br>

An Internet print device font distribution method and web site.<br>
Font users are visitors to a web site (52) that allows browsing and obtaining of<br>
fonts, either individually or in groups. Preferably, purchases are made through<br>
the web site, but the method may allow installation of fonts (34, 36, 40)<br>
through the web site as a result of other authorizations (31), e.g., an electronic<br>
coupon for visitors or a tie-in to other products, services, and web sites. Web<br>
site functions include operating system compatibility matching. The web site<br>
obtains configuration information to insure compatibility of a font to a visitor's<br>
configuration. Software on the web site downloads, installs and configures<br>
fonts on the visitor's print device.</td>
