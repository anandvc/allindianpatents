Complete Specification<br>
Float Weight System<br>
This Float Weight System or Float Weight Mechanized Automatic System is a very interesting device that can bring relief to the busy working people of today who tlnds very little time for themselves. On various occasions one happens to forget to switch on the motor to fill the overhead tank, which has gone empty resulting in a peak hour morning schedule of theirs getting upset. Sometimes to add to the misery at this critical time, there may be a power cut only to worsen situations. 1\) avoid such problems this Float Weight Mechanized Automatic System could be the best remedy.<br>
This Float Weight System or Float Weight Mechanized Automatic System is an interesting device where in which the tricky method in the set up turns it into an automatic system thereby can become man's best friend and so also for the busy housewife who can now rely on it, more than on her busy, preoccupied husband or some other member of the family who often may be forgetting to till the overhead tank promptly.<br>
The minimum requirements to set up this system working one needs, a plastic water bottle tilled with sufllcient water or a sufllcienlly heavy float, a certain length of nylon cord with sufllcient durability and strength, two bends, a thin L shaped metal plate of durability and strength with a hole in it, a piano type 15 or 16 amps 3 pin switch and socket combined, and an indicator of sufllcient weight.<br>
To put this float Weight System into function one needs a plastic water bottle tilled with sufllcient water as need be or a sufficiently heavy float. A length oi' nylon cord with sufficient durability and strength, one end of which is passed through a small hole made in the center of the cover of this bottle (if need be through a copper washer that sets easily on the inner side of the cover) where sufficiently a big knot is made at the end of this nylon cord so as not to be able to pass through the hole in the copper washer and cover. The plastic bottle with water in it is closed tightly and preferably sealed off and placed in the one fourth filled overhead tank, that keeps the plastic bottle floating. The two bends are to be fixed on either side of the over How pipe for excess water.<br>
Now the other end of the nylon cord is passed through the inner and outer bends of the over flow pipe (so as to help free movement of the nylon cord) and brought down beside the overhead tank to a suitable place where the piano type 15 or 16 amps 3 pin switch and socket combined has been fixed, where only the piano type ON and OFF switch is reversed and put in an upside down position and given its connection, onto which is firmly stuck the L shaped metal plate with a hole in it. The nylon cord is lightly pulled and marked just beside the hole in the metal plate.<br><br>
The motor is manually switched ON; the water starts filling the overhead tank lifting the float in the tank till it brings the float close to the bend. On reaching three to four inches away from the bend, the motor is switched OFF. The nylon cord is slightly pulled; another mark is made on it just beside the hole in the metal L shaped plate. At this mark a sufficiently big knot is made (big enough not to pass through the hole in the L shaped metal plate) then the nylon cord is passed through the hole in the L shaped metal plate and another knot is made on the previous mark of the nylon cord in the same manner, below which four to six inches away is fixed the indicator where ends the nylon cord. This indicator should be of Just sufficient weight that when the first knot rests on the L shaped metal plate to OFF the motor switch.<br>
Now the system is ready to function on its own, one will find as the water gets consumed the water level starts dropping till the lower knot reaches the L shaped metal plate, then due to the weight of the float in the overhead tank still descending, the L shaped plate with the hole in it unable to pass through the lower knot above the indicator, due to pressure from the weight of the tloat in the tank on the switch through the 1. shaped metal plate, finally ON's the switch. At this point opposite the indicator 'reserve' can be marked. So also when the tank starts to get full, the float in the overhead tank on ascending, and descending the higher knot which finally rests on the hole of the L shaped metal plate and through the assistance of the indicator OlTs the motor. At this point opposite the indicator full can be marked. Thus with highering and lowering of the float in the tank the system continues to work automatically. Thus the Mechanized System turns Automatic.<br>
Note: Since after this invention. Trip Switches started to be manufactured with the up position as ON and the down position as OFF. Hence if such switches are used, it's to be placed in its normal position.<br><br>
Brief Description of the Drawings:<br>
Figure I: shows (2) overhead tank being illled up, and position of (6) knot one<br>
almost getting ready to OFF the motor.<br>
Figure 2; shows (2) o\'crhead tank almost empty, and position of (10) knot two almost getting ready to ON the motor.<br>
Detailed Description of the Drawings:<br>
I'igure 1: shows (I) inflow pipe filling (2) overhead tank and (4) plastic water bottle or float reaching its lop most level. (5) nylon cord is seen passing through (3) overllow pipe with bends and descending showing (6) knot one almost reaching (9) 1. shaped metal plate with a hole in it; that is stuck llrmly onto (7) piano type switch, that has been filxed in an upside down position with the three pin plug of the motor fixed permanently into its socket of (8) 15 to 16 amps switch and socket combined. Further is seen (10) knot two at almost its lowest level, a few inches away from (II) indicator that is almost reaching (13) the I'DFL level marking. Whereas (6) knot one is almost reaching (9) L shaped metal plate with a hole in it where finally (6) knot one unable to pass through the hole in (9) L shaped metal plate with a hole in it finally resting on it with the weight of (II) indicator will Off the motor, showing (II) indicator opposite (13) FULL level marking.<br>
I'igure 2: shows (3) overllow pipe of (2) over head tank having (5) nylon cord descending from (3) overllow pipe with bends to (4) plastic water bottle or lloat whereas on the outer side of (2) overhead tank is seen (6) knot one almost opposite to (4) plastic water bottle or lloat, whereas (10) knot two has already reached (9) L shaped metal plate with a hole in it. As the water in (2) overhead tank is consumed (10) knot two unable to pass through the hole in (9) L shaped metal plate with a hole in it,will begin to pressurize (9) L shaped metal plate with a hole in it. Till finally (4) plastic water bottle or tloat due to further descending of water in (2) overhead tank due to the weight of (4) plastic water bottle or tloat through (5) nylon cord and (10) knot two exerting pressure more and more on (9) L shaped plate with a hole in it finally ON's the motor through (7) piano type switch in its upside down position with the three pin plug of the motor tlxed permanently into the socket of (8) 15 to 16 amps switch and socket combined. At this time it will be seen that (11) indicator is opposite (12) RESERVE level marking.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
I claim,<br>
1.	The float in this Float Weight System is the heart of the entire mechanism<br>
(most important) since the rest of the working of the system depends on its<br>
performance. The highering and lowering (up and down movement) of the<br>
float in the overhead tank results in other parts of the system fulfilling its<br>
functions.<br>
2.	The indicator is of importance since through its weight the motor is switched<br>
OFF by the higher knot when pressure is exercised on the L shaped metal<br>
plate.<br>
3.	The L shaped metal plate and hole is of much importance since it plays an<br>
important role in switching ON and switching OFF the motor on being<br>
pressurized.<br>
4.	The reversed position of the piano type switch or upside down position of the<br>
switch is a necessity for making the whole system practical.<br>
5.	The knots that are a must, takes the place of the human hand that normally ons<br>
and offs the motor. Here the lower knot on being pressurized by the weight of<br>
the float in the overhead tank finally ONs the motor with the help of the L<br>
shaped metal plate.<br>
6.	The nylon cord is the link, which convey the needs of the overhead tank's<br>
requirements by the highering and lowering of the float.<br><br></td>
