COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"A RADIATION SOURCE ASSEMBLY"<br>
HENRY KOZLOWSKI, of 39 Coach Liteway, Toronto, Ontario M2R 3J8, CANADA<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
The present invention relates to a radiation source assembly.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for ultraviolet treatment of fluids such as water. More particularly, the present invention relates to an apparatus that employs a particular arrangement of ballasts and ultraviolet lamps.<br>
Background to the Invention<br>
It is known to treat water with ultraviolet light in order to destroy undesirable bacteria and other microorganisms. For example, U.S. Patent 5 660 719 which issued August 26, 1997 to Kurtz et al. discloses an ultraviolet lamp rack assembly comprising an array of vertically disposed ultraviolet lamps for the treatment of fluids. The assembly has a separate enclosure for the housing at least one ballast and electronic components to power the lamps. Kurtz et al. indicate that substantial amounts of heat are generated during functioning of the ballast and that cooling is required. Cooling is provided by blowing air through the enclosure, or by means of air conditioning or the use of a heat exchanger.<br>
Another arrangement is disclosed in U.S. Patent 5 019 256 which issued May 28, 1991 to Ifill et al. This patent discloses an ultraviolet lamp rack assembly comprising a vertical array of horizontally disposed ultraviolet lamps for the treatment of waste water. A power control panel is provided at a location remote from the rack assembly for the inclusion of ballasts and various electronic components. Alternatively, the ballasts for the lamps may be located in a submerged vertical conduit which forms a part of the rack. One of the problems associated with such an arrangement is that the ballasts are difficult to remove from the rack, and if one ballast needs to be replaced then all of the ballasts must be removed. This is inefficient, as the ultraviolet treatment unit is out of service for a long period of time. Variations of the device of U.S. Patent 5 019 256 to Ifill et al. are disclosed in U.S. Patents 4 482 809, 4 872 980 and 5 006 244 to J.M. Maarschalkerweerd which issued November 13, 1984, October 10, 1989 and April<br><br>
9, 1991 respectively. The ballasts and power supply to the lamps are separate from the lamps and lamp racks.<br>
Most commercial treatment systems for water, in which the water is treated with ultraviolet radiation, use ultraviolet lamps which have electrodes therein and 5 are associated-with ballasts. The present invention is also suitable for lamps which are electrodeless and are associated with high frequency excitation couplers. A description of a typical electrodeless lamp and coupler may be found in United States Patent 5 070 277 to W.P. Lapatovich which issued December 3, 1991.<br>
The present invention attempts to overcome the deficiencies of the previous systems and provide a system which is easily maintained.<br>
The term "wire", as used herein in relation to the present invention, includes a plurality of wires, e.g. as in a cable.<br>
The terms "comprising/comprises" when used in this specification are taken to specify the presence of the stated features, integers, steps or components but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, components or groups thereof.<br>

20 Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiments<br>
Referring to Figure 1, there is an ultraviolet lamp rack 10 which has a vertical conduit 11, a vertical support member 12 and a bar 13. Located between vertical conduit 11 and vertical member 12 are a plurality of ultraviolet lamps 14 encased in transparent sleeves 15 (partially seen in Figure 2), with associated<br>
25 ballasts 16 and caps 18. The sleeves 15 are made from a material which permits passage of ultraviolet light. A preferred material is quartz glass. The ultraviolet lamps 14 and ballasts 16 are submerged in liquid 66, e.g waste water. The surface of the liquid is shown at 17 and in Figure 1 is beneath bar 13.<br>
Figure 2 shows the arrangement of one of the ballasts 16. Ballast 16 has<br>
30 internal components 22 encased in sleeve 21. At one end of ballast 16 there are female electrical connectors 20 for cooperation with electrical pins 19 on ultraviolet<br><br>
i<br>
lamp 14. At the other end of ballast 16 there is an electrical line pin 23 and an<br>
electrical neutral pin 24. Between line pin 23 and neutral pin 24 there is an<br>
electrical insulation barrier 25. Attached to sleeve 21 is a retaining ring 26, the<br>
purpose of which will be explained hereinafter.<br>
	Figure 2 also shows vertical conduit 11 in which there are female electrical<br>
connectors 34 and 35, which are electrically connected to electrical conduits, e.g<br>
wires, strips. There is an aperture 36 adjacent to connectors 34 and 35, through<br>
which pins 23 and 24 may be connected to connectors 34 and 35 respectively.<br>
Attached, e.g. welded, to vertical conduit 11 is a tubular stub 29, which has an<br>
 exterior screw thread, as shown in Figures 2 and 4. Ballast 16 is held in place by<br>
means of an internally screw threaded coupling 27. The joint between ballast 16<br>
and tubular stub 29 is made watertight by means of an O-ring 28 which is trapped<br>
between retaining ring 26 and tubular stub 29.<br>
As indicated above, the ultraviolet light lamp 14 is electrically connected to ballast 16 by means of pins 19 and female connectors 20. At the end of ballast 16 adjacent to the connectors 20, there is a tubular stub 31 which has an external screw thread 31a. Tubular stub 31 is connected to sleeve 21 by a weld or similar. It will be understood that tubular stub 31 may be an integral part of sleeve 21. Quartz sleeve 15 surrounds ultraviolet lamp 14. The connection between the quartz sleeve 15 and tubular stub 31, and thus between ultraviolet lamp 14 and ballast 16, is kept waterproof by means of an O-ring 33 which is trapped between tubular stub 31 and internally threaded retaining nut 32.<br>
It Will be understood that other arrangements for securing the ballast and<br>
lamps in place are possible without departing from the essence of the invention. For<br>
 example, sleeve 16 and tubular stub 29 may have the same diameter, and abutting<br>
ends may be externally threaded and held together with an internally threaded<br>
coupling which screws onto both the sleeve and the stub.<br>
Figure 3 shows an end of ballast 16, which has line and neutral pins 23 and 24 separated by an electrical insulation barrier 25. The ballast end may have auxiliary pins 38 for alarms and other features.<br>
Figures 5 and 6 illustrate different arrangements of a ballast and an ultraviolet lamp. In Figure 5, ballast 70 is electrically and mechanically connected to ultraviolet lamp 71. Ballast 70 and lamp 71 are enveloped in sleeve 72. Sleeve 72 has a closed end 73 and an open end 74. Open end 74 fits over and is supported by tubular stub 75 which is welded to a vertically arranged tubular conduit 76. There is an aperture in conduit 76 so that there may be electrical communication through conduit 76 to the ballast 70 inside sleeve 72. Electrical communication is accomplished through wires 77 which are appropriately connected to ballast 70. Sleeve 72 is sealed against ingress of fluid, e.g. liquid, outside the sleeve, by means of O-ring 78 or similar. Figure 5 also shows closed end 73 of sleeve 72 being supported in a cavity 79 in vertically arranged support member 80.<br>
In Figure 6, ballast 90 is physically separated from ultraviolet lamp 91,<br>
although ballast 90 and lamp 91 are electrically connected by wires 92. Lamp 91 is<br>
enveloped in sleeve 93. Sleeve 93 has a closed end 94 and an open end 95. Open<br>
 end 95 fits over and is supported by tubular stub 96 which is welded to vertically<br>
arranged tubular conduit 97. There is an aperture in conduit 97 so that there may be<br>
electrical communication through conduit 97 to the ballast 90. Ballast 90, which has<br>
a threaded end, is mechanically supported by externally threaded stub 98 and<br>
internally threaded coupling 99. There is an O-ring 100 trapped between ballast 90<br>
 and stub 98 to provided a seal to prevent ingress of fluid into the electrical<br>
connections for the ballast and lamp. Ballast 90 has power supply wires 101<br>
connected thereto. Sleeve 93 is sealed against ingress of fluid, e.g. liquid, outside<br>
the sleeve, by means of O-ring 102 or similar. Closed end 94 of sleeve 93 has a<br>
boot 103 surrounding closed end 94, and boot 103 is supported in a cavity 104 in<br>
 vertically arranged support member 105.<br>
Figures 7 and 8 illustrate a power and signal laminate 39 which comprises a plurality of strips 40 to 46. The centre strip 43 has a notch 53 therein for receiving electrical insulation barrier 25. If there are a plurality of ballasts to be connected to the power and signal laminate, it will be understood that there will be a notch for every ballast. Figure 7 shows three such notches. Centre strip 43 is sandwiched between strips 42 and 44. Strip 42 is sandwiched between strips 43 and 41 and strip<br>
44 is sandwiched between strips 43 and 45. Attached to strip 42, between strips 41 and 42 is an electrically conducting power strip 50 (see Figure 7) with a plurality of spring clips 49 attached thereto. Attached to strip 44, between strips 44 and 45 is a power strip 47 with a plurality of spring clips 48 attached thereto. Strips 41 and 45 have a plurality of notches 52 and 51 respectively, for reception of electrical pins 23 and 24 respectively. Spring clips 49 nest within notches 52 and spring clips 48 nest within notches 51. Spring clips 48 are for providing secure electrical connection between power strip 47 and electrical pins 24. Spring clips 49 are for providing secure electrical connection between power strip 50 and electrical pins 23. The laminate 39 has outer strips 40 and 46.<br>
The laminate shown in Figure 8 also has notches 54 and 56 in outer strips 46 and 40 respectively. In notches 54 and 56 there are power strips with spring connectors 55 and 57 respectively therein.<br>
Although not shown, microprocessor chips may be embedded between strips<br>
 so that the microprocessor chips are protected from the environment, e.g. are<br>
protected from water damage. The chips can be used for a variety of purposes, e.g.<br>
to monitor the lamps, ballasts, excitation couplers and other electrical or electronic<br>
components, and trigger alarms at alarm remote panels.<br>
It will be understood that electrical pins 23 and 24 form an electrical connection with power strips 47 and 50 when pushed into spring clips 48 and 49 respectively. Connectors 55 and 57 are preferably for auxiliary connections, e.g for detection of burnt-out lamps, defective ballasts, leaking joints and the like.<br>
Although the drawings show electrical power being fed to ballasts 16 by means of wires or laminates through conduit 11, electrical power may be fed to ballast 16 through means external to conduit 11. In such an instance, waterproof wires may be used, which enter a waterproof coupling to the ballast. As will be understood, in such an instance, conduit 11 could be replaced by a submersible tube or bar which merely supports ballast 16. Such support may be provided by a flexible or rigid boot attached to the submersible bar. Alternatively, the ballast may be physically separated from the lamp as shown in Figure 6.<br>
The present invention is useful for the treatment of a wide range of fluids,<br>
e.g. gases and liquids. It is preferable that the fluid is flowing around the radiation<br>
source and the excitation controlling means. For example, a rack with attached<br>
ballasts and ultraviolet lamps is immersed in a flowing gas so that a stream of gas<br>
 flows over the ultraviolet lamps.<br>
The present invention is particularly useful for the treatment of water, e.g.<br>
for waste water disinfection, drinking water disinfection, advanced oxidation<br>
treatment and other water treatment processes. The rack with attached ballasts and<br>
ultraviolet lamps preferably is immersed in the water so that a stream of water flows<br>
 over the ultraviolet lamps. Electric power is fed to the lamps via the ballasts,<br>
preferably by means of wires or laminates of the present invention though a tubular<br>
member of the rack. One of the advantages of this aspect of the present invention is<br>
that the water that is being treated can be used to cool the ballasts. This removes<br>
the necessity for external forced air cooling or for air conditioning equipment.<br>
 Furthermore, the ballasts can easily be serviced in situ, removed from service or<br>
replaced in the same way that ultraviolet lamps may be serviced or replaced. Any<br>
downtime for operation is thus kept to a minimum. In the Ifill et al. apparatus, if a<br>
ballast, which is present in vertical conduit 15 becomes defective, all of the ballasts<br>
and associated wiring must be removed from the conduit, repaired and then<br>
 reinserted. The present invention is a great improvement over Ifill's invention and<br>
other known systems.<br>
Another advantage of the present invention is that the life of ballasts or excitation couplers should be greater because they are kept cooler.<br>
It will be understood that the present invention is applicable to low pressure standard output lamps, low pressure high output lamps, low pressure triple output (amalgam) lamps, medium pressure lamps, electrodeless lamps and excimer lamps.<br>
Although the drawings have been limited to showing installation of a system<br>
with ballasts and ultraviolet lamps, the present invention is equally applicable to<br>
other radiation sources and other excitation controlling means. For example,<br>
 electrodeless ultraviolet lamps or video projection lamps or street lamps may be<br>
used with high frequency, e.g. radio frequency, excitation couplers.<br>
While several embodiments of this invention have been illustrated in the accompanying drawings and described hereinabove, it will be evident to those skilled in the art that changes and modifications may be made therein without departing from the essence of this invention, as set forth in the appended claims.<br>
