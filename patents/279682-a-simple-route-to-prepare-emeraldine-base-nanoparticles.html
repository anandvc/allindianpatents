				<td>The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
The present invention relates to a procedure of "a simple route to prepare emeraldine base nanoparticles"<br>
BACKGROUND:<br>
Polymers due to their low electrical conductivity were mainly used as insulating materials. A breakthrough came with the in 1977 when MacDiarmid, Heeger, and Shirakawa discovered that exposure of conjugated polymer polyacetylene to iodine vapor yielded an electrically conducting material. Although their polyacetylene exhibits good electrical properties, its application is limited because of its poor stability in air and complicated synthesis methods. They were later awarded Nobel Prize in 2000. Since then, research in the field of conducting polymers was intensified searching for newer cheaper and smarter conducting polymer. During the meantime many such polymers were discovered such as polyaniline (PAni), polypyrrole (PPy), polythiophene (PTh) etc. These polymers have gained significant prominence recently because of their stability in air and optical and electrical properties.<br>
Polyaniline is unique among the family of conjugated polymers and has attracted considerable attention due to its low cost, simple synthesis, good environmental stability, simple nonredox doping/dedoping chemistry based in acid/base reactions, and favorable optical and electrical properties. It has found potential applications in electronic and optical devices such as batteries, artificial muscles, electromagnetic shielding devices, corrosion protection coatings, sensors, capacitors, hydrogen storage, fuel cells etc.<br>
Polyaniline was originally known in 1835 as "aniline black", a term used for any product obtained by the oxidation of aniline. Conducting properties of polyaniline were rediscovered in the early 1980s and PAni was found to have wide ranging application in various fields.<br>
Polyaniline can be synthesized by both the electrochemical and chemical oxidative polymerization in acidic, mildly acidic and even neutral media. However, the results are very different in each situation. This may be well understood from the opinion of Prof. A.G. MacDiarmid that "there are as many different types polyaniline as there are people who synthesize it". The conducting form of polyaniline is termed as emeraldine salt whereas the nonconducting form as emeraldine base.<br>
In recent past, the research on polyaniline and its derivatives was mainly focused on making it more processible and commercially available. It has experienced a great leap with the advent of nanoscience and nanotechnology in recent years. Synthesizing nanostructures of this unique conducting polymer has attracted special attention these days. The hope is that nanostructured polyaniline will offer better performance or new properties compared with its conventional bulk counterpart. Various research groups have conducted works involving synthesis of polyaniline nanofibers and nanoparticles. Few of these reports may be summarized as follows:<br>

Majority of work reported till date is not as simple as we are presenting here. The complex chemistry of polyaniline formation once again proved that there are lots more to do. To the first concern, we are here with a very simple route to prepare emeraldine base nanoparticles. The procedure is simple and discussed below:<br>
1.	Prepare the solutions of aniline and oxidant in aqueous solution of an inorganic acid.<br>
2.	Cool these solutions at a predetermined temperature.<br>
3.	Pour the oxidant solution into the aniline solution and keep it undisturbed for overnight at the predetermined temperature.<br>
4.	Separate polyaniline by filtration with a Buckner funnel.<br>
5.	Convert green emeraldine salt into emeraldine base nanopowder by dedoping by a predetermined dedoping agent.<br>
The nanopowder was analyzed for FT1R (Figure-1) and TEM (Figure-2). Moreover, a flow diagram of complete procedure is given in Figure-3.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

1.	A technique for the production of polyaniline nanoparticles comprising following<br>
steps:<br>
a). Acidic aqueous solution of aniline of predetermined concentration is made.<br>
b). Acidic aqueous solution of potassium persulphate of predetermined concentration is also made.<br>
c). The two solutions were allowed to cool at a predetermined temperature.<br>
d). Predetermined volume of potassium persulphate solutions is gently poured into the equal volume of the aniline solution in glass beaker and kept at the predetermined temperature for overnight (normally more than 14-15 hours). The polymer so obtained was filtered, washed with distilled water, dedoped with excess of predetermined dedoping agent followed by washing with distilled water and dried in air oven.<br>
