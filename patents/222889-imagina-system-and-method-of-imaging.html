This application claims the benefit of U.S. Patent Application Serial No.<br>
09/900,218, which was filed July 6, 2001, and drilled IMAGING SYSTEM AND<br>
METHODOLOGY EMPLOYING RECIPROCAL SPACE OPTICAL DESIGN.<br>
TECHNICAL HELD<br>
The present invention relates generally to image and optical systems, and mote<br>
particularly to a system and method to facilitate imaging performance via an image<br>
transfer medium that projects characteristics of a sensor to an object field of view.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Microscopes facilitate creating a large image of a tiny object. Greater<br>
magnification can be achieved if the light from an object is made to pass through two<br>
lessons compared to a simple microscope with one lens. A compound microscope has two<br>
or more converging leness, placed in line with one another, so that both lenses refract the <br>
light in see. The result is to produce an image that is magnified more than either lens<br>
could magnify alons. Light illuminationg the object first passes through a short focal<br>
length lens or lens group, called the objective, and then travels on some distance before<br>
being passed through a longer focal length lens or lens group, called the cyepiece. A lens<br>
group is aften sin ply referred to singularly as a lens. Usually these two lenses are held in<br>
parsonal relationship to one another, so that the axis of one lens is arranged to be in the<br>
some erientation is the axis of the second lens. It is the nature of the lenses, their<br>
properties, their relationship, and the relationship of the objective lens to the object that<br>
determines how a highly magnified image is produced in the eye of the pbserver.<br>
The first lens or objective, is usually a small lens with a very small focal length. A<br>
specimen or object is placed in the path of a light source with sufficient intensity to<br><br>
illuminate as desired. The objective lens is then lowered until the specimen is very close<br>
to, but not quite at the focal point of the lens. Light leaving the specimen and passing<br>
through the objective lens produces a real, inverted and magnified image behind the lens,<br>
in the microscope at a point generally referred to as the intermediate image plane. The<br>
second lens or eyepiece, has a longer focal length and is placed in the microscope so that<br>
the image produced by the objective lens falls closer to the eyepiece than one focal length<br>
(that is, inside the focal point of the lens). The image from the objective lens now<br>
becomes the object for the eyepiece lens. As this object is inside one focal length, the<br>
second lens refrects the light in such a way as to produce a second image that is virtual,<br>
inverted and amplified. This is the final image seen by the eye of the observer.<br>
Alternatively, common infinity space or infinity corrected design microscopes<br>
employ obfective lenses with infinite conjugate properties such that the light leaving the<br>
objective is not focused, but is a flux of parallel rays which do not converge until after<br>
passing through a tube lens where the projected image is men located at the focal point of<br>
the eyepiece for magnification and observation. Many microscopes, such as the<br>
compound microscope described above, are designed to provide images of certain quality<br>
to the human eye through an eyepiece. Connecting a Machine Vision Sensor, such as a<br>
Charge Coupled Device (CCD) sensor, to the microscope so that an usage may be viewed<br>
on a monitor presents difficulties. This is because the image quality provided by the<br>
sensor and viewed by a human eye decreases, as compared so an image viewed by a<br>
human eye dierctly through an eyepiece. As a result, conventional optical systems for<br>
magnifying, observing, exanining, and analyzing small items often require the careful<br>
attention of a technician monitoring the process through an eyepiece. It is for this reason,<br>
as well as others, that Machine-Vision or computer-based image displays from the<br>
aforementioned image sensor displayed on a monitor or other output display device are<br>
not of quality perceived by the human observer through the eyepiece. <br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The following presents a simplified summary of the invention in order to provide a<br>
basic understanding of some aspects of the invention. This summary is not an extensive<br>
overview of the invention. It is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of the<br><br>
invention nor delineate the scope of the invention. Its sole purpose is to present some<br>
concepts of the invention in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed<br>
description that is presented later.<br>
The present invention relates to a system and methodology that facilitates imaging<br>
performance of optical imaging systems. In regard to several optical and/or imaging<br>
system parameters, many orders of performance enhancement can be realized over<br>
conventional systems (e.g., greater effective resolved magnification, larger working<br>
distances, increased absolute spatial resolution, increased spatial field of view, increased<br>
depth of field, Modulation Transfer Function of about 1, oil immension objectives and eye<br>
pieces not rcquired). This is achieved by adapting an image transfer medium (e.g., one or<br>
more lenses, fiber optical media, or other media) to a sensor having one or more receptors<br>
(e.g., pixels) such that the receptors of the sensor are effectively scaled (e.g., "mapped",<br>
"sized", "projected", "matched", "reduced") to occupy an object field of view at about the<br>
scale or size associated with a diffraction limited point or spot within the object field of<br>
view. Thus, a band-pass filtering of spatial frequencies in what is known as Fourier space<br>
or "k-space" is achieved such that the projected size (projection in a direction from the<br>
sensor toward object space) of the receptor is filled in k-space.<br>
In other words, the image transfer medium is adapted, configured and/or selected<br>
such that a transform into k-space is achieved, wherein an a priori design determination<br>
casses k-space or band-pass frequencies of interest to be substantially preserved<br>
throughout and frequencied above and below the k-space frequencies to be mitigated. It is<br>
noted that the frequencied above and below the k-space frequencies tend to cause blurring<br>
and contrast red action and are generally associated with conventional optical system<br>
designs which define intrinsic constraints on a Modulation Transfer Function and "optical<br>
aoiss". This further illustrates that the systems and methods of the present invention are<br>
in contravention or opposition to conventional geometric paraxial ray designs.<br>
Cindequently, many known optical design limitations associated with conventional<br>
systems are mitigated by the present invention.<br>
According to one aspect of Ihe present invention, a "k-space" design, system and<br>
methodology is provided which defines a "unit-mapping" of the Modulation Transfer<br>
Function (MTF) of an object plane to image plane relationship. The k-apace design<br><br>
projects image plane pixels or receptors forward to the object plane to promote an<br>
optimum theore ical relationship. This is defined by a substantially one-to-one<br>
correspondence between image sensor receptors and projected object plane units (e.g.,<br>
units defined by smallest resolvable points or spots in the object field of view) that are<br>
matched according to the receptor size. The k-Space design defines that "unit-mapping"<br>
or "unit-matchir g" acts as an effective "Intrinsic Spatial Filter" which implies that<br>
spectral components of both an object and an image in k-space (also referred to as<br>
"reciprocal-space") are substantially matched or quantized. Advantages provided by the<br>
k-space design result in a system and methodology capable of much higher effective<br>
resolved magnification with concomitantly related and much increased Field Of View,<br>
Depth Of Field, Absolute Spatial Resolution, and Working Distances utilizing dry<br>
objective lens imaging, for example, and without employing conventional oil immersion<br>
techniques having inherent intrinsic limitations to the aforementioned parameters.<br>
One aspect of the present invention relates to an optical system that includes an<br>
optical sensor having an array of light receptors having a pixel pitch. A lens optically<br>
associated with the optical sensor is configured with optical parameters functionally<br>
related to the pitch and a desired resolution of the optical system. As a result, the lens is<br>
operative to substantially map a portion of an object having the desired resolution along<br>
the optical path to an associated one of the light receptors.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention relates to a method of designing an optical<br>
system. The method inclides selecting a sensor with a plurality of light receptors having <br>
a pixel pitch. A desired minimum spot size resolution is selected for the system and a <br>
lens configered or an extant lens selected with optical parameters based on the pixel pitch<br>
and the desired minimum spot size is provided so as to map the plurality of light receptors<br>
to part of the image according to the desired resolution.<br>
The following description and the annexed drawings set forth in detail certain<br>
illusteative aspects of the invention. These aspects are indicative, however, of but a few<br>
of the various ways in which the principles of the invention may be employed and the<br>
present invention is intended to include all such aspects and their equivalents. Other<br>
advantages and rovel features of the invention will become apparent from die following<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an optical and/or imaging system and<br>
methedology. According to one aspect of the present invention, a k-space filter is<br>
provided that can be configured from an image transfer medium such as optical media<br><br>
that correlates image sensor receptors to an object field of view. A variety of illumination<br>
sources can also be employed to achieve one or more operational goals and for versatility<br>
of application. The k-space design of the imaging system of the present invention<br>
promotes capture and analysts (e.g., automated and/or manual) of images having a high<br>
Field Of View (FOV) at substantially high Effective Resolved Magnification as compared<br>
to conventional systems. This can include employing a small Numerical Aperture (NA)<br>
associated with lower magnification objective lenses to achieve very high Effective<br>
Resolved Magnification. As a consequence, images having a substantially large Depth Of<br>
Field (DOF) at very high Effective Resolved Magnification are also realized. The k-space<br>
design also facilitates employment of homogenous illumination sources that are<br>
substantially insensitive to changes in position, thereby improving methods of<br>
examination and analysis.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, an objective lens to object<br>
dntanee (e.g., Working Distance) can be maintaned in operation at low and high power<br>
effective resolved magnification imaging, wherein typical spacing can be achieved at<br>
about 0.1 mm or more and about 20 mm or less, as opposed to conventional microscopic<br>
systems which can raquire significantly smaller (as small as 0.01 mm) object to objective<br>
lens distances for comparable (e.g., similar order of magnitude) Effective Resolved<br>
Magnification values. In another aspect, the Working Distance is about 0.5 mm or more<br>
and about 10 mm or less. It is to be appreciated that the present invention is not limited<br>
opening at the above wording distances. In many instances the above working distances<br>
are employed, however, in aome instances, smaller or larger distances are employed. It is<br>
further noted that oil immersion or other index of Refraction matching medis or fluids for<br>
objective lenses are generally not required (e.g., substantially no improvement to be<br>
gained) at one or more effective image magnification levels of the present invention yet,<br>
still exceeding effective resolved magnification levels achievable in conventional<br>
microscopic optical design varitions including systems employing "infinity-corrected"<br>
objective lenses.<br>
The k-space design of the present invent on defines that a small "Blue Circle" or<br>
defraction limited point/spot at the object plane is determined by parametets of the design<br>
to match image sensor receptors or pixels with a substantially one-to-one correspondence<br><br>
by "unit-mapping" of object and image spaces for associated object and image fields.<br>
This enables the improved performance and capabilities of the present invention. One<br>
possible theory of the k-space design results from the mathematical concept that since the<br>
Fourier Transform of both an object and an image is formed in k-space (also called<br>
"reciprocal space"), the sensor should be mapped to the object plane in k-space via optical<br>
design techniques and component placement in accordance with the present invention. It<br>
is to be appreciated that a plurality of other transforms or models can be utilized to<br>
configure and/or select one or more components n accordance with the present invention.<br>
For example, wavelet transforms, LaPlacc (s-transforms), z-transforms as well as other<br>
transforms can be similarly employed.<br>
The k-space design methodology is unlike conventional optical systems designed<br>
according to geometric, paraxial ray-trace and optimization theory, since the k-space<br>
optimization fac litates that the spectral components of the object (e.g., tissue sample,<br>
particle, semicor ductor) and the image are the same in k-space, and thus quantized.<br>
Therefore, there are substantially no inherent limitations imposed on a Modulation<br>
Transfer Function (MTF) describing contrast versus resolution and absolute spatial<br>
resolution in the present invention. Quantization, for example, in k-space yields a<br>
substantially unitary Modulation Transfer Function not realised by conventional systems.<br>
It is noted that high MTF, Spatial Resolution, and effective resolved image magnification<br>
can be achieved with much lower magnification objective lenses with desirable lower<br>
Numerical Apertces (e.g., generally less than about 50x with a numerical aperture of<br>
generally less then about 0.7) although "unit-mapping" of projected pixels in an "Inrrinsic<br>
Spetial Filter" provided by the k-space design.<br>
If desired "infinity-connected" objectives can be employed with associated optical<br>
component and illumination, as well as spectrum varying components, polarization<br>
varying components, and/or contrast or phase varying components. These components<br>
can be included in an optical path-length betweem an onjective and the image lens within<br>
an "infinity space". Optical syatem accessories and varuations can thus be positioned as<br>
interchangable modules in this geometry. The k-space design, in contrast to<br>
conventional microscopic images that utilize "infinity-corrected" objectives, enables the<br>
miximum optimization of the infinity space geometry by the "unit-mapping" concept.<br><br>
This implies than there is generally no specific limit to the number of additional<br>
components that can be inserted in the "infinity space" geometry as in conventional<br>
microscopic systems that typically specify no more than 2 additional components without<br>
optical correction.<br>
The present invention also enables a "base-module" design that can be configured<br>
and reconfigured in operation for a plurality of different applications if necessary to<br>
employ either transmissive or reflected illumination, if desired, this includes<br>
substantially all typical machine vision illumination schemes (e.g., darkfield, brightfield<br>
phase-contrast), and other microscopic transmissive techniques (Kohler, Abbe), in<br>
substantially any offset and can include Epi-illumination - and variants thereof. The<br>
systems of the present invention can be employed in a plurality of opto-mechanicaI<br>
designs that are robust since the k-space design is substantially not sensitive to<br>
environmental and mechanical vibration and thus generally does not require heavy<br>
structural mechanical design and isolation from vibration associated with conventional<br>
microscopic imaging instruments. Other features can include digital image processing, if<br>
desired, along with storage (e.g., local database, image data transmissions to remote<br>
computers for storage/analysis and display of the images produced in accordance with the<br>
present invantion (e.g., computer display, printer, film, and other output media). Remote<br>
signal processing of image data can be provided, along with communication and display<br>
of the image data via associated data packets that are communicated over a netword or<br>
other medium, for example.<br>
Referring initially to Fig. 1, an imaging system 10 is illustrated in accoudance with<br>
an aspect of the present invention. The imaging system 10 includes a sensor 20 having<br>
noe or more receptors such as pixels or descrete light detectors (See e.g. illustrated below<br>
in Fig. 3) operably associated with an image transfer medium 30. The image transfer<br>
medium 30 is adapted or configured to scale the proportions of the sensor 20 at an image<br>
plane estabiahed by the position of the sensor 20 to an object field of view illustrated at<br>
reference 34. A planar feference 36 of X and Ycoordinates is provided to<br>
illustrate the scaling or reduction of the apparent or virtual size of the sensor 20 to the<br>
object field of view 34. Direction arrows 38 and 40 illustrate the direction of reduction of<br>
the apparent size of the sensor 30 toward the object field of view 34.<br><br>
The object field of view 34 established by the image transfer medium 30 is related<br>
to the position of an object plane 42 that includes one or more items under microscopic<br>
examination (not shown). It is noted that the senior 20 can be substantially any size,<br>
shape and/or technology (e.g., digital sensor, analog sensor, Charge Coupled Device<br>
(CCD) sensor, CMOS sensor, Charge injection Device (CID) sensor, an array sensor, a<br>
linear scan sensor) including one or more receptors of various sizes and shapes, the one or<br>
more receptors being similarly sized or proportioned on a respective sensor to be<br>
responsive to light (e.g., visible, non-visible) received from the items under examination<br>
in the object field of view 34. As light is received from the object field of view 34, the<br>
sensor 20 provides an output 44 that can be directed to a local or remote storage such as a<br>
memory (not shewn) and displayed from the memory via a computer and associated<br>
display, for example, without substantially any intervening digital processing (e.g.,<br>
straight bit map from sensor memory to display), if desired It is noted that local or<br>
remote signal processing of the image data received from the sensor 20 can also occur.<br>
For example, the output 44 can be converted to electronic data packets and transmitted to<br>
a remote system over a network and/or via wireless transmissions systems and protocols<br>
for further analysis and/or display. Similarly, the output 44 can be scored in a local<br>
computer memory before being transmitted to a subsequent computing system for further<br>
analysis and/or display.<br>
The scaling probided by the image transfer medium 30 is determined by a novel k-<br>
space configuration of design within the medium that promotes predetermined k-space<br>
frequencies of interest and mitigates frequencies outside the predetermined frequencies.<br>
This has the effect of a band-pass filter of teh spatial frequencies within the image transfer<br>
medium 30 and notably defines the imaging system 10 in terms of rosolution rather than<br>
magnification. As will be described in more detail below, the resolution of the imaging<br>
system 10 determined by the k-space design promotes a plurality of features in a displayed<br>
or stored image such as haying high effective resolved magnifcation, high absolute<br>
spetial resolution, large depth of field, larger working distances, and a military Modulation<br>
Transfer Function as well as other features.<br><br>
In order to determine the k-space frequencies, a "pitch" or spacing is determined<br>
between adjacent receptors on the sensor 20, the pitch related to the center-to-center<br>
distance of adjacent receptors and about the size or diameter of a single receptor. The<br>
pitch of the sensor 20 defines the Nyquist "cut-off" frequency band of the sensor. It is<br>
this frequency tend that is promoted by the k-space design, whereas other frequencies are<br>
mitigated. In order to illustrate how scaling is determined in the imaging system 10, a<br>
small or diffraction limited spot or point 50 is illustrated at the object plane 42. The<br>
diffraction limited point 50 represents the smallest resolvable object determined by optical<br>
characteristics within the image transfer medium 50 and is described in more detail<br>
below. A scaled receptor 54, depicted in front of the field of view 34 for exemplary<br>
purposes, and having a size determined according to the pitch of the sensor 20, is matched<br>
or scaled to be about the same size in the object field of view 34 as the diffraction limited<br>
point 50.<br>
In other words, the size of any given receptor at the sensor 20 is effectively<br>
reduced in size via the image transfer medium 30 to be about the same size (or matched in<br>
size) to the size of the diffraction limited point 50. This also has the effect of filling the<br>
object field of view 34 with substantially all of the receptors of the sensor 20, the<br>
respective receptors being suitably scaled to be similar in size to the diffraction limited<br>
point 50. As will bedescribed in more detail below, the matching/mapping of sensor<br>
characteristics to the smallest resolvable object or point within the object field of view 34<br>
defines the imaging system 10 in terms of absolute spatial resolution and thus, enhances<br>
the operating performance of the system.<br>
An illumination source 60 can be provided with the present invention in order that<br>
photons from that source can be transmitted through and/or reflected from objects in the<br>
field of view 34 to enable activation of teh receptors in the sensor 20. It is noted that the<br>
present invention can potentially be employed without an illumination source 60 if<br>
potential salf-harninous objects (e.g., finorescent or phosphorescent biological or organic<br>
material sample, metallurgical, mineral, and/or other inorganic material and so forth) emit<br>
enough radiation to activate the sensor 60. Light Emitting Diodes, however, provide an<br>
effective illumination source 60 in accordance with the present invention. Substantially<br><br>
any illumination source 60 can be applied including coherent and non-coherent sources<br>
visible and non-visible wavelengths. However, for non-visible wavelength sources, the<br>
sensor 20 would also be suitably adapted. For example, for an infrared or ultraviolet<br>
source, an infrared or ultraviolet sensor 20 would be employed, respectively Other<br>
illumination sources 60 can include wavelength-specific lighting, broad-band lighting,<br>
continuous lighting, strobed lighting. Kohler illumination, Abbe illumination, phase-<br>
contrast illumination, darkfield illumination, brightfield illumination, and Epi<br>
illumination. Transmissive or reflective lighting techniques (e.g., specular and diffuse)<br>
can also be applied.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 2, a system 100 illustrates an image transfer medium in<br>
accordance with an aspect of the present invention. The image transfer medium 30<br>
depicted in Fig. 1 can be provided according to the k-space design concepts described<br>
above and more particularly via a k-space filter 110 adapted, configured and/or selected to<br>
promote a band of predetermined k-space frequencies 114 and to mitigate frequencies<br>
outside of this land. This is achieved by determining a pitch "P" - which is the distance<br>
between adjacent receptors 116 in a sensor (not shown) and sizing optical media within<br>
the filter 110 such that the pitch "P" of the receptors 116 is matched in size with a<br>
diffraction-limited spot 120. The diffraction-limited spot 120 can be determined from the<br>
optical characteristics of the media in the fitter 110. For example, the Numerical Aperture<br>
of an optical medium such as a lens defines the smallest object or spot that can be<br>
resolved by the lens. The filter 110 performs a k-space transformation such that the size<br>
of the pitch is effectively matched, "unit-mapped", projected, correlated, and/or reduced<br>
to the size or scale of the diffraction limited spot 120.<br>
It is to be appreciated that a plurality of optical configurations can be provided to<br>
achieve the k-space filter 110. One such configuration can be provided by an asphecial<br>
lens 124 adapted such to perform the k-space transformation and reduction from sensor<br>
space to object space. Yet another configuration can be provided by a multiple lens<br>
arrangement 121, wherein the lens combination is selected to provide the filtering and<br>
scaling. Still yet another configuration can employ a fiber optic taper 132 or image<br>
condait, wherein multiple optical fibers or array of fibers are configured in a finall-shape<br><br>
to perform the mapping of the sensor to the object field of view. It is noted that the fiber<br>
optic taper 132 s generally in physical contact between the sensor and the object under<br>
examination (e.g., contact with microscope slide). Another possible k-space filter 110<br>
arrangement employs a holographic (or other diffractive or phase structure) optical<br>
element 136, wherein a substantially flat optical surface is configured via a hologram (or<br>
other diffractive or phase structure) (e.g., computer-generated, optically generated, and/or<br>
other method) to provide the mapping in accordence with the present invention.<br>
The k-space optical design as enabled by the k-space filter 110 is based upon the<br>
"effective projected pixel-pitch" of the sensor, which is a figure derived from following<br>
("projecting") the physical size of the sensor array elements back through the optical<br>
system to the object plane. In this manner, conjugate planes and optical transform spaces<br>
are matched to the Nyquist cut-off of the effective receptor or pixel size. This maximizes<br>
the effective resolved image magnification and the Field Of View as well as the Depth Of<br>
Field and the Absolute Spatial Resolution. Thus, a novel application of optical theory is<br>
provided that does not rely on conventional geometric optical design parameters of<br>
paraxial ray-traning which govern conventional optics and imaging combinations. This<br>
can further be described in the following manner.<br>
A Fourier transform of an object and an image is formed (by an optical system) in<br>
k-space (also referred to as "reciprocal-space"). It is this transform that is operated on for<br>
image optimization by the k-space design of the present invention. For example, the<br>
optical media employed in the present invention can be designed with standard, relatively<br>
non-expensive "off-the-shelf components having a configuration which defines that the<br>
object and image space are 'unit-mapped" or "unit-matched" for substantially all image<br>
and object fields. A small Blur-circle or diffraction-limited spot 120 at the object plane is<br>
defined by the design to match the pixels in the image plane (e.g., at the image sensor of<br>
choice) with substantially one-to-one correspondence and thus the Fourier transforms of<br>
pixelated arrays can be matched. This implies that, optically by design, the Blur-circle is<br>
scaled to be about the same size as the receptor or pixel pitch. The present invention is<br>
defined such that it construucts an Intrinsic Spatial Filter such as the k-space filter 110.<br>
Such a design definition and implementation enables the spectral components of both the<br>
object and tbe inage in k-space to be about the same or quantized. This also defines that<br><br>
the Modulation transfer Function (MTF) (the comparison of contrast to spatial<br>
resolution) of the sensor is matched to the MTF of the object Plane.<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates an optical system 200 in accordance with an aspect of the present<br>
invention. The system 200 includes a sensor 212 having a plurality of receptors or sensor<br>
pixels 214. For example, the sensor 2l2 is an M by Narray of sensor pixels 214, having<br>
M rows and N columns (e.g., 640 x 480, 512 x 512, 1280 x 1024, and so forth), M and the N<br>
being integers respectively. Although a rectangular sensor 212 having generally square<br>
pixels is depicted, it is to be understood and appreciated that the sensor can be<br>
substantially any shape (e.g., circular, elliptical, hexagonal, rectangular, and so forth). It<br>
is to be further appreciated that respective pixels 214 within the array can also be<br>
substantially any shape or size, the pixels in any given array 212 being similarly sued and<br>
shaped in accordance with an aspect of the present invention.<br>
The sensor 212 can be substantially any technology (e.g., digital sensor, analog<br>
sensor, Charge Coupled Device (CCD) sensor, CMOS sensor, Charge Injection Device<br>
(CID) sensor, an array sensor, a linear scan sensor) including one or more receptors (or<br>
pixels) 214. According to one aspect of the present invention, each of the pixels 214 is<br>
similarly sized or proportioned and responsive to light (e.g., visible, non-visible) received<br>
from the items under examination, as described herein.<br>
The sensor 212 is associated with a lens network 216, which is configured bassed<br>
on performance requirements of the optical system and the pitch size of sensor 212. The<br>
lens network 216 is operative to scale (or project) proportions (e.g., pixels 214) of the<br>
sensor 212 at an image plane established by the position of the sensor 212 to an object<br>
field of view 220 in accordance with an aspect of the present invention. The object field<br>
of view 220 is related to the position of an object plane 222 that includes one or more<br>
items (not shown) under examination.<br>
As the sensor 212 receives light from the object field of view 220, the sensor 212<br>
provides an output 226 that can be durected to a local or remote storage such as a memory<br>
(not shown) and displayed from the memory via a computer and associated display, for<br>
example, without substantially any interventing digital processing <br>
tVomtininrmfniotj) to displayX if desired. It is nosed that local or remote signal<br>
processing of the image data received from the sensor 212 can also occur. For example,<br><br>
the output 226 can be converted to electronic data packets and transmitted to a remote<br>
system over a network for further analysis and/or display. Similarly, the output 226 can be<br>
stored in a local computer memory before being transmitted to a subsequent computing<br>
system for further analysis and/or display.<br>
The scaling (or effective projecting) of pixels 214 provided by the lens network<br>
216 is determined by a novel k-space configuration or design in accordance with an aspect<br>
of the present invention. The k-space design of the lens network 216 promotes<br>
predetermined k-space frequencies of interest and mitigates frequencies outside the<br>
predetermined frequency band. This has the effect of a band pass filter of the spatial<br>
frequencies with in the lens network 216 and notably defines the imaging system 200 in<br>
terms of resolution rather than magnification. As will be described below, the resolution<br>
of the imaging system 200 determined by the k-space design promotes a plurality of<br>
features in a displayed or stored image, such as having high "Effective Resolved<br>
Magnification" (a figure of merit described in following), with related high absolute<br>
spatial resolution, large depth of field, larger working distances, and a unitary Modulation<br>
Transfer Function as well as other features.<br>
In order to determine the k-space frequencies, a "pitch' or spacing 228 is<br>
determined between adjacent receptors 214 on the sensor 212. The pitch (e.g., pixel<br>
pitch) corresponds is to the center-to-ccntcr distance of adjacent receptors, indicated at 228,<br>
which is about the size or diameter of a single receptor when the sensor includes all<br>
equally sized pixels. The pitch 228 defines the Nyquist "cut-off" frequency band of the<br>
sensor 212. It is this frequency band that is promoted by the k-space design, whereas<br>
other frequencies are mitigated. In order to illustrate how scaling is determined in the<br>
imaging system 200, a point 230 of a desired smallest resolvable spot size is illustrated at<br>
the object plane 222. The point 230, for example can represent the smallest resolvable<br>
object determined by optical characteristics of the lens network 216. That is, the lens<br>
network is confugured to have optical characteristics (e.g., magnification, numerical<br>
aperture) so that respective pixels 214 are matched or scaled to be about the same size in<br>
the object field of view 220 as the desired minimum resolvable spot size of the point 230.<br>
For purposes of illustration, a scaled receptor 232 is depicted in front of the field of view<br><br>
220 as having a size determined according to the pitch 228 of the sensor 212, which is<br>
about the same as the point 230.<br>
By way of illustration, the lens network 216 is designed to effectively reduce the<br>
size of each given receptor (e.g., pixel) 214 at the sensor 212 to be about the same size<br>
(e.g., matched in size) to the size of the point 230, which is typically the minimum spot<br>
size resolvable by the system 210. It is to be understood and appreciated that the point<br>
230 can be selected to a size representing the smallest resolvable object determined by<br>
optical characteristics within the lens network 216 as determined by diffraction rules (e.g.,<br>
diffraction limited spot size). The lens network 216 thus can be designed to effectively<br>
scale each pixel 214 of the sensor 212 to any size that is equal to or greater than the<br>
diffraction limited size. For example, the resolvable spot size can be selected to provide<br>
for any desired image resolution that meets such criteria.<br>
After the desired resolution (resolvable spot size) is selected, the lens network 216<br>
is designed to provide the magnification to scale the pixels 214 to the object field of view<br>
220 accordingly. This has the effect of filling the object field of view 220 with<br>
substantially all of the receptors of the sensor 212, the respective receptors being suitably<br>
scaled to be similar in size to the point 230, which corresponds to the desired resolvable<br>
spot size. The matching/mapping of sensor characteristics to the desired (e.g., smallest)<br>
resolvable object or point 230 within the object field of view 220 defines the imaging<br>
system 200 in terms of absolute spetial resolution and enhances the operating performance<br>
of the system in accordance with an aspect of teh present inventing.<br>
By way of farther illustration, in order to provide unit-mapping according to this<br>
example, assume that the sensor array 212 provides a pixel pitch 228 of about 10.0<br>
microns. The lens network 216 includes an objective lens 234 and a secondary lens 236.<br>
For example, the objective lens 234 can be set at infinite conjugate to the secondary lens<br>
236, with me spacing between the objective and secondary lenses being flexible. The<br>
lenses 234 and 236 are related to each other so as to achieve a reduction from sensor<br>
space defined at the sensor array 220 to object space defined at the object plane 222. It is<br>
noted that substantially all of the pixels 214 are projected into the object field of view<br>
220, which is defined by the objective lens 234. For example, the respective pixels 214<br>
are scaled through the objective lens 234 to about the dimensions of Ihe desired minimum<br><br>
resolvable spot size. In this example, the desired resolution at the image plane 222 is one<br>
micron. Thus, a magnification often times is operative to back project a ten micron pixel<br>
to the object plane 222 and reduce it to a size of one micron.<br>
The reduction in size of the array 212 and associated pixels 214 can bo achieved<br>
by selecting the transfer lens 236 to have a focal length "D2" (from the array 212 to the<br>
transfer lens 236) of about 150 millimeters and by selecting the objective lens to have a<br>
focal length "Dl" (from the objective lens 236 to the object plane 222) of about 15<br>
millimeters, for example. In this manner, the pixels 214 are effectively reduced in size to<br>
about 1.0 microscoper pixel, thus matching the size of the of the desired resolvable spot<br>
230 and filling the object field of view 220 with a "virtually-reduved" array of pixels. It is<br>
to be understood and appreciated that other arrangements of one or more lenses can be<br>
employed to provide me desired scaling..<br>
In view of the foregoing description, those skilled in the art will understand and<br>
appreciate that the optical media (e.g., lens network 216) can be designed, in accordance<br>
with an aspect of the present invention, with standard, relatively inexpensive "off-the-<br>
shelf" components having a configuration that defines that the object and image space are<br>
"unit-mapped" or "unit-matched" for substantially all image and object fields. The lens<br>
network 216 and, in particular the objective lens 234, performs a Fourier transform of an<br>
object and an image in k-space (also referred to as "reciprocal-space"). It is this transform<br>
that is operated on for image optimization by the k-space design of the present invention.<br>
A small Blue-curcle or Siry disk at the object plane is defined by the design to<br>
match the pixels in the image plane (e.g., at the image sensor of choice) with substantially<br>
one-to-one correspondence with the Airy disk and thus the Fourier transforms of pixilated<br>
arrays can be matched. This implies that, optically by design, the Airy disk is scaled<br>
through the lens network 216 to be about the same size as the receptor or pixel pitch. As<br>
mentioned above, the lens network 216 is defined so as to construct and Intrinsic Spatial<br>
Filter (e.g., a k-space filter). Such a desigh definition and implementation enables the<br>
spectral components of both the object and the image in k-space to be about the same or<br>
questized. This also defines that a Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) (the comparison<br>
of constrast to spatial resolition) of the sensor can be mached to the MTF of the object<br>
Plane in accordance with an aspect of the present invention.<br><br>
As illustrated in Fig. 3, k-space is defined as the region between the objective lens<br>
234 and the secondary lens 236. It is to be appreciated that substantially any optical<br>
media, lens type and/or lens combination that reduces, maps and/or projects the sensor<br>
array 212 to the object field of view 220 in accordance with unit or k-space mapping as<br>
described herein is within the scope of the present invention.<br>
To illustrate the noveity of the exemplary lens/sensor combination depicted in Fig.<br>
3, it is noted that conventional objective lenses, sized according to conventional geometric<br>
paraxial ray techniques, are generally sized according to the magnification, Numeric<br>
Aperture, focal length and other parameters provided by the objective. Thus, the<br>
objective lens would be sized with a greater focal length than subsequent lenses that<br>
approach or are closer to the sensor (or eyepiece inconventional microscope) in order to<br>
provide magnification of small objects. This can result in magnification of the small<br>
objects at the object plane being projected as a magnified image of the objects across<br>
"portions" of the sensor and results in knows detail blur (e.g., Rayleigh diffraction and<br>
other limitations in the optics), empty magnification problems, and Nyquist alissing<br>
among other problems at the sensor. The k-space design of the present invention operates<br><br>
in an alternative manner to conventional geometrical paraxial ray design principles. That<br>
is, the objective lens 234 and the secondary lens 236 operate to provide a reduction in size<br>
of the sensor array 212 to the object field of view 220, as demonstrated by the relationship<br>
of the lenses.<br>
An illimination sound 230 can be provided with the present invention in order<br>
that photons from that source can be transmitted through and/or reflected from objects in<br>
the field of view 234 to enable activation of the receptors in the sensor 212. It is noted<br>
if potential self-haninous objects (e.g., objects or specimens with emissive characteristics<br>
as previously described) omit enough radiation to activate the sensor 12. Substantially<br>
any illumination source 240 can be applied including coberent and non-coherent sources,<br>
visible and non-visible wavelengths. However, for non-visible wavelength sources, the<br>
sensor 212 work, also be suitable adepted. For example, for an infrared or ultraviolet<br>
source, an infraced of ultraviolet sensor 212 would be employed, respectively. Other<br><br>
lighting, continuous lighting, strobed lighting. Kohler illumination, Abbe illumination,<br>
phase-contrast illumination, darkfield illumination, brightfiefd illumination. Epi<br>
illumination, and the like. Transmissive or reflective (e.g., specular and diffuse) lighting<br>
techniques can also be applied.<br>
Fig. 4 illustrates a graph 300 of mapping characteristics and comparison between<br>
projected pixel size on the X-axis and diffraction-limited spot resolution size "R" on the<br>
Y-axis. An apex 310 of the graph 300 corresponds to unit mapping between projected<br>
pixel size and the diffraction limited spot size, which represents an optimum relationship<br>
between a lens network and a sensor in accordance with the present invention.<br>
It is to be appreciated that the objective lens 234 (Fig. 3) should generally not be<br>
selected such that the diffraction-limited size "R" of the smallest resolvable objects are<br>
smaller than a projected pixel size. If so. "economic waste" can occur wherein more<br>
precise informat on is lost (e.g., selecting an object lens more expensive than required,<br>
such as having a higher numerical aperture). This is illustrated to the night of a dividing<br>
line 320 at reference 330 depicting a projected pixel 340 larger that two smaller<br>
diffraction spots 350. In contrast, where an objective is selected with diffraction-limited<br>
performance larger than the projected pixel size, blurring and empty magnification can<br>
occur. This is illustrated to the left of line 320 at reference numeral 360, wherein a<br>
projected pixel 370 is smaller than a diffraction-limited object 380. It is to be<br>
appreciated, however, that even if substantially one-to-one correspondence is not achieved<br>
between projected pixel size and the diffraction-limited spot, a system can be configured<br>
with less than optimum matching (e.g., 0.1 %, 1%, 2%, 5%, 20%, 95% down from the<br>
apex 310 on the graph 300 to the left or right of the line 320) and still provide suitable<br>
performance in accordance with an aspect of the present invention. Thus, less than<br>
optimal matching is intended to fall within the spirit and the scope of prexent invention.<br>
It is further to be appreciated that the diameter of the lenses in the system as<br>
illustrated in Fig. 3, for example, should be sized such that when a Fourier Transform is<br>
performed from object space to sensor space, spatial frequencies of interest that are in the<br>
band pass region described above (e.g., frequencies utilized to defime tje size and shape of<br>
a pixel) are substantially not attentated. This generally implies that larger diameter lenses<br><br>
(e.g., about 10 to 100 millimeters) should be selected to mitigate attenuation of the spatial<br>
frequencies of interest.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 5, a Modulation Transfer function 400 is illustrated in<br>
accordance with the present invention. On a Y-axis, modulation percentage from 0 to<br>
100% is illustrated defining percentage of contrast between black and while. On an X-<br>
axis. Absolution Spatial Resolution is illustrated in terms of microns of separation. A line<br>
4 10 illustrates that modulation percentage remains substantially constant at about 100%<br>
over varying degrees of spatial resolution. Thus, the Modulation Transfer Function is<br>
about 1 for the present invention up to about a limit imposed by the signal to noise<br>
sensitivity of the sensor. For illustrative purposes, a conventional optics design<br>
Modulation Transfer Function is illustrated by line 420 which may be an exponential<br>
curve with generally asymptotic limits characterized by generally decreasing spatial<br>
resolution with decreasing modulation percentage (contrast).<br>
Fig. 6 illustrates a quantifiable Figure of Merit (FOM) for the present invention<br>
defined as dependent on two primary factors Absolute Spatial Resolution (RA, in<br>
microns), depiced on the Y axis and the Field Of View (F, in microns) depicted on the X<br>
axis of a graph 300. A reasonable FOM called "Spatial Field Number" (S), can be<br>
expressed as the ratio of these two previous quentities, with higher values of S being<br>
desirable for imaging as follows:<br>
S= F/RA<br>
A line 510 illustrates that the FOM remains substantially constant across the field<br>
of view and over different values of absolute spetial resolution which is an enhancement<br>
over conventional systems.<br>
Figs. 7, 8, 14, 15, and 16 illustrate methodologies to facilitate imaging<br>
performance in accordance with the present invention. While, for purposes of simplicity<br>
of explanation, the methodologies may be shown and described as a series of acts, it is to<br>
be understood and appreciated that the present invention is not limited by the order of<br>
acts, as some acts may, in accordance with the present invention, occur in different orders<br>
and/or correctly with other acts from that shown and described herein. For example,<br>
those skilled in the art will understand and appreciate that a methodology could<br>
alternatively be represented as a series of interrelated states or events, such as in a state<br><br>
diagram. Moreover, not all illustrated acts may be required to implement a methodology<br>
in accordance wi h the present invention.<br>
Turning row to Figure 7 and proceeding to 610, lenses are selected having<br>
diffraction-limited characteristics at about the same size of a pixel in order to provide<br>
unit-mapping awl optimization of the k-space design. At 614, lens characteristics are also<br>
selected to mitigate reduction of spatial frequencies within k-space. As described above,<br>
this generally unities that larger diameter optics are selected in order to mitigate<br>
attenuation of desired k-space frequencies of interest. At 618, a lens configuration is<br>
selected such that pixels, having a pitch "P", at the image plane defined by the position of<br>
a sensor are scaled according to the pitch to an object field of view at about the size of a<br>
diffraction-limited spot (e.g., unit-mapped) within the object field of view. At 622, an<br>
image is generated by outputting data from a sensor for real-time monitoring and/or<br>
storing the data is memory for direct display to a computer display and/or subsequent<br>
local or remote image processing and/or analysis within the memory.<br>
Fig. 8 illustrates a methodology that can be employed to design an optical/imaging<br>
system in accordance with an aspect of the present invention. The methodology begins at<br>
700 in which a suitable sensor array is chosen for the system. The sensor array includes a<br>
matrix of racepter pixels having a known pitch size, usually defined by the manufactrue.<br>
The sensor can be substantially any shape (e.g., rectangular, circular, square, triangular,<br>
and so forth). By way of illustration, assume that a sensor of 640x480 pixels having a <br>
pitch size of 10 um is chosen. It is to be understood and appreciated that an optical<br>
system can be designed for any type and/or size of sensor array in accoudance with an<br>
aspect of the present invention.<br>
Next at 710, an image resolution is defined. The image resolution corresponds to<br>
the smallest desired resolvable spot size at the image plane. The image resolution can be<br>
defined based on the application(s) for which the optical system is being designed, such as<br>
any resolution that is greater than or equal to a smallent diffraction limited size. Thus, it<br>
is to be apprisiated that resolution becomes a selectable design parameter that can be<br>
miloved to provide desired image resolution for virtually any type of application. In<br>
contrast, most conventional systems tend to limit resolution according to Rayleigh<br><br>
diffraction, which provides that intrinsic spatial resolution of the lenses cannot exceed<br>
limits of diffract on for a given wavelength.<br>
After selecting a desired resolution (710), a suitable amount of magnification is<br>
determined at 720 to achieve such resolution. For example, the magnification is<br>
functionally related to the pixel pitch of the sensor array and the smallest resolvable spot<br>
size. The magnification (M) can be expressed as follows:<br><br>
So, for the above example where the pixel pitch is 10 um and assuming a desired image<br>
resolution of um, Eq. 1 provides an optical system of power ten. That is, the lens<br>
system is configured to back-project each 10 um pixel to the object plane and reduce<br>
respective pixels to the resolvable spot size of 1 micron.<br>
The methodology of Fig. 8 also includes a determination of a Numerical Aperture<br>
at 730. The Numerical Aperture (NA) is determined according to well-established<br>
diffraction rules that relate NA of the objective lens to the minimum resolvable spot size <br>
determined at 710 for the optical system. By way of example, the calculation of NA can<br>
be based on the following equation:<br><br>
Continuing with the example in which the optical system has a resolved spot size of y = 1<br>
micron, and assuming a wavelength of about 500 nm (e.g., green light), a NA = 0.25 <br>
satisfies Eq. 2. It is noted that relatively inexpensive commercially available objective of<br>
power 10 provide numerical apertures of 0.25.<br>
It is to be understood and appreciated that the relationship between NA,<br>
wavelength aixl resolution represented by Eq. 2 can be expressed in fifferent ways<br>
according to various factors that account for the behavior of objectives and condensers.<br>
Thus, the determination at 730, in accordance with an aspect of the present invention, is<br><br>
not limited to and particular equation but instead amply obeys known general physical<br>
laws in which NA is functionally related to the wavelength and resolution. After the lens<br>
parameters have been designed according to the selected sensor (700), the corresponding<br>
optical components can be arranged to provide an optical system (740) in accordance with<br>
an aspect of the present invention.<br>
Assume, for purposes of illustration, that the example optical system created<br>
according to the methodology of Fig. 8 is to be employed for microscopic-digital imaging.<br>
By way of comparison, in classical microscopy, in order to image and resolve structures<br>
of a size approaching 1 micron (aad below), magnifications of many hundreds usually are<br>
required. The bosic reason for this is that such optics conventionally have been designed<br>
for the situation when the sensor of choice is the human eye. In contrast, the methodology<br>
of Fig. 8 designs the optical system in view of the sensor, which affords significant<br>
performance increases at reduced cost.<br>
In the k-space design methodology, according to an aspect of the present<br>
invention, the optical system is designed around a discrete sensor that has known fixed<br>
dimensions. As result, the methodology can provide a for more straight-forward, robust,<br>
and inexpensive optical system design approach to "back-project" the sensor site onto the<br>
object plane and calculate a magnification factor. A second part at the methodology<br>
facilitates that the optics that provide the magnification have a sufficient NA to optically<br>
resolve a spot of similar dimensions as the back-projected pixel. Advantageously, an<br>
optical system disigned in accordance with an aspect of the present invention can utilize<br>
custom and/or off-the-shelf components. Thus, for this example, inexpensive optics can<br>
be employed in accordance with an aspect of the present invention to obtain suitable<br>
results, but well-corrected microscope optics are relatively inexpensive. If custom-<br>
designed optics are utilized, in accordance with an aspect of the present invention, then<br>
the range of premissible magnifications and numerical apertures becomes substantial, and<br>
some performance gains can be realized over the use of off-the-shelf optical components.<br>
In view of the concepts described above in relation to Figs. 1-8, a plurality of<br>
related imaging applications can be enabled and enhanced by the present invention. For<br>
example, these applications can include but are not limited to imaging, control,<br>
inspection, microscopy and/or other automated analysis such as:<br><br>
(1) Bio-medical analysis (e.g., cell colony counting, histology, frozen sections,<br>
cellular cytology Haematology, pathology, oncology, fluorescence, interference, phase<br>
and many other clinical microscopy applications);<br>
(2) Particle Sizing Applications (e.g., Pharmaceutical manufacturers, paint<br>
manufacturers, cosmetics manufacturers, food process engineering, and others);<br>
(3) Air quality monitoring and airborne particulate measurement (e.g., clean room<br>
certification, environmental certification, and so forth);<br>
(4) Optical defect analysis, and other requirements for high resolution microscopic<br>
inspection of both transmissive and opaque materials (as in metallurgy, automated<br>
semiconductor inspection and analysis, automated vision systems, 3-D imaging and so<br>
forth); and<br>
(5) Imaging technologies such as cameras, copiers, FAX machines and medical<br>
systems.<br>
Figs. 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 illustrate possible example systems that can be<br>
constructed employing the concepts previously described above in relation to Figs. 1-8.<br>
Fig. 9 is a flow dagram of light paths in an imaging system 800 adapted in accordance<br>
with the present invention.<br>
The system 800 employs a light source 804emitting illuminating light that is<br>
received by a light condenser 808. Output from the light condenser 808 can be directed<br>
by a fold mirror 812 to a microscope condenser 816 that projects illuminating light onto a<br>
slide stage 820, wherein as object (not shown, positioned on top of, or within the slide<br>
stage) can be imaged in accordance with the present. The slide stage 820 can be<br>
automatically positioned (and/or manually) via a computer 824 and associated slide feed<br>
828 in order to image one or more objects in a field of view defined by an objective lens<br>
832. It is noted that the objective lens 832 and/or other components depicted in the<br>
system 800 may be adjusted manually and/or authmatically via the computer 824 and<br>
associated contros (not shown) (e.g., servo motors, tube slides, liner and/or rotary<br>
position encoders, optical, magnetic, electronic or other feedback mechanisms, control<br>
software, and so forth) to achieve different and/or desired image characteristics (e.g.,<br>
magnification, focus, which objects appear in field of view, depth of field and so forth).<br>
Light output from the objective lens 832 can be directed through an optional beam<br><br>
splitter 840, wherein the beam splitter 840 is operative with an alternative epi-<br>
illumination section in 842 (to light objects from above slide stage 820) including light<br>
shaping optics 844 and associated light source 843. Light passing through the beam<br>
splitter 840 is received by an image forming lens 350. Output from the image forming<br>
lens 850 can be directed to a CCD or other imaging sensor or device 854 via a fold mirror<br>
860. The CCD or other imaging sensor or device 854 converts the light received from the<br>
object to digital information for transmission to the computer 824, wherein the object<br>
image can be displayed to a user in real-time and/or stored in memory at 864. As noted<br>
above, the digital information defining the image captured by the CCD or other imaging<br>
sensor or device 354 can be routed as bit-map information to the display/memory 864 by<br>
the computer 824. If desired, image processing such as automatic comparisons with<br>
predetermined samples or images can be performed to determine an identity of and/or<br>
analyze the object under examination. This can also include employment of substantially<br>
any type of image processing technology or software that can be applied to the captured<br>
image data within the memory 864.<br>
Fig. 10 is a system 900 depicting an exemplary modular approach to imaging<br>
design in accordance with an aspect of the present invention. The system 900 can be<br>
based on a sensos array 910 (e.g., provided in off-the-shelf camera) with a pixel pitch of<br>
approximately 8 microscope (or other dimension), for example, wherein array sizes can vary<br>
from 640x480 to 1280x1024 (or other dimension as noted above). The system 900<br>
includes a modular desigh wherein a respective module is substantially isolated from<br>
another module, thus, mitigating alignment tolerances.<br>
The modules can include:<br>

• a sample holding and presentation module 924;<br>
• a light-shaping module 930 including a condenser 934; and<br>
• a sub-stage lighting module 940.<br>
It is noted that the system 900 can advantageously employ commercially-<br>
available components such as for example:<br>

the desired characteristic that for a given magnification, the projected pixel-<br>
pitch at the object plane is similar in dimensions to the diffraction-limited<br>
resolved spot of the optics<br>
• (e.g., Olympus I-UB222, I-UB223, I-UB225. I-UB227)<br>
The system 900 utilizes an infinity-space (k~space) between the objective lens 944<br>
and the image-forming lens 916 in order to facilitate the insertion of auxiliary and/or<br>
additional optical components, modules, filters, and so forth in the k-spacc region at 922<br>
such as for example, when the image-forming lens 916 is adapted as an f = 150mm<br>
achromatic triplet. Furthermore, an infinity-space (k-space) between the objective lens<br>
944 and the image-forming lens 916 can be provided in order to facilitate the injection of<br>
lighy (vie a light-forming path) into an optical path for api-ilumination. For example, the<br>
• a light source 950 such as an LED driven from a current -stabilized<br>
• (e.g., HP HLMP-CW30)<br>
• a trasmission hologram for source homogenisation and the impasitier.<br>
of a spatial virtual-source at 950;<br>

the imaging optics, thereby mitigating the effect of scattered light<br>

• a collection lens at 960 employed to maximize the light gathered from<br>
the virtual source 950. and to match the k-space characteristics of the<br>
source to that of the imaging optics; and<br>
(e.g., f= 50mm aspheric lens, f = 50mm achromatic doublet)<br>
• a partidy-reflcctive beam splitter 964 employed to form a coaxial light<br>
path ar d image path. For example, the optic 964 provides a 50%<br>
reflectivity on a first surface (at an inclination of 45 degrees), and is<br>
broadband antireftection coated on a second surface.<br>
The sub-stage lighting module 940 is provided by an arrangement that is<br>
substantially similar to that of the epi-illummation described above for example.<br>
- a light source 970 (an LED driven from a element-stabilised supply);<br>
• (eg.. HP HLMP-CW30)<br>
• a transmission hologram (associated with tight source 970) for the purposes of<br>
source honogenisation and the imposition of a spatial virtual-source;<br>

source 97(', and to natch, the k-space characterstics of the source to that of the<br>
imaging optics;<br>
• (e.g., f-50mm aspheric lens, f-50mm achmatic doublet)<br>

fine-adjustment in order to accurately aligia the optical modules; and<br>
• a relay lens (not shown) employed to accerately position the image of the <br>
variable aperture 980 into the object plane (at alide 990), thereby, along with<br><br>

illumination.<br>
• (eg. f = 100mm simple plano-convex lens).<br>
As described above, a computer 994 and associated display/memory 998 is<br>
provided to display in real-tune and/or store/process digital image data captured in<br>
accordance with the present invention.<br>
Fig. 11 illustrates a system 1000 in accordance with an aspect of the<br>
present invention In this aspect, a sub-stage lighting module 1010 (e g. Kohler.<br>
Abbe) can projec light through a traasmissive slide 1020 (object tinder<br>
examination not shown), wherein an achromatic objective lens 1030 receives light<br>
from the slide and directs the light to an image capture module at 1040. It is noted<br>
that the achromat c objective lens 1030 and/or slide 1020 can be manually and/or<br>
automatically controlled to position the objects) under examination and/or<br>
position the objective lens.<br>
Fig. 12 illustrates a system 1100 in accordance with an aspect of the<br>
present invention. In this aspect, a top-stage or epi-illumination lighting module<br>
1110 can project light to an opaque slide 1120 (object under examination not<br>
shown), wherein objective lens 1130 (can be compound lens device or other<br>
type) receives light from the slide and directs the light to an image capture module<br>
at 1040. As molec above, the objective lens 1130 and/or slide 1120 can be<br>
manually and/or automatically controlled t position the object(s) under <br>
examination and/or position the objective lins. Fig. 13 depicts a system 1200 that<br>
is similar to bthe system 1000 in Fig. 11 except that a compound objectine lens<br>
1210 is exployed in place of as achromatic objective lens.<br>
The imaging systems and processes described above conenction with Figs. 1-13<br>
may thus be exployed t capture/processan image of a sample wherein the imaging<br>
systems ate coupled t a processor or computer than reads the image generated by the<br>
imaging systema and compares the image to a variety of images in an on-board data store<br>
in any number of current memory technologies.<br><br>
For example, the computer can include an analysis component to perform the<br>
comparison. Sone of the many algorithms employed in image processing include, but are<br>
not limited to convolution (on which many others are LasedX FFT, DCT, thinning (or<br>
skeletonisation), edge detection and contrast enhancement. These are usually<br>
implemented in software but may also use special purpose hardware for speed. FFT (fast<br>
Fourier transform ) is an algorithm for computing the Fourier transform of a set of discrete<br>
data values. Given a finite set of data points, for example, a periodic sampling taken from<br>
a real-world signal, the FFT expresses the data in terms of its component frequencies It<br>
also addresses the essentially identical inverse concerns of reconstructing a signal from<br>
the frequency data. DCT (discrete cosine transform) is a technique for expressing a<br>
waveform as a weighted sum of cosines. There are a various extant programming<br>
languages design-id for image processing which include but are not limited to those such<br>
as IDL, image Pro, Matlab, and many others. There are also no specific limits to the<br>
special and custom image processing algorithms that may be written to perform functional<br>
image manipulations and analyses.<br>
The k-space design of the present invention also allows for direct optical<br>
correlation of the fourier Frequency informaton contained in the image with stored<br>
information t perform real-time optically correlated image processed analysed of a given <br>
sample object.<br>
Fig. 14 illustrates a particle sizing apllication 1300 that can be employed with<br>
systems and peocess previorsly described. Particle sizing can include real-time<br>
closed/open loop monitoring, manufacturing with and cootrol of particles in view of<br>
automatically determined particles sizes in accordance with the k-space design concepts<br>
previously described. This can include automated analysts and detection techniques for<br>
various particles loving simmilar or different sizes (ndifferent sizes, n being an integer)<br>
and particles identification of an shaped/dimensioned particles, in being an integer). In one<br>
aspect of the present inventi, desired particle size detection and analysis can be<br>
achieved via a direct measurement approach. This implies that the absolute spatial<br>
resolution per period relates directly (or substantially thereto) in units of linear measure to<br>
me imaged particles without substantial account of the parrticle medium and associated<br>
particle distribution. Direct announcement generally does not creste a model but rather<br><br>
provides a metro ogy and morphology of the imaged particles in any given sample. This<br>
mitigates processing of modelling algorithms, statistical algorithums, and other modelling<br>
limitations presorted by current technology. Thus;, an issue becomes one of sample<br>
handling and fonn that enhances the accuracy and precision of measurements since the<br>
particle data is directly imaged and measured rather than modelled, if desired.<br>
Proceedit g to 1310 of the particle sizing application 1300, particle size image<br>
parameters are determined. For example, basic device design can be configured for<br>
imaging at desired Absolute Spatial Resolution per pixel and Effective Resolved<br>
Magnification as previously described. These parameters determine field of view (FOV),<br>
depth of field (DOF), and working distance (WD), for example. Real-time measurement<br>
can be achieved by asynchronous imaging of a medium at selected timing intervals, in<br>
real-time at common video rates, and/or at image capture rates as desired. Real-time<br>
imaging can also be achieved by capturing images at selected tones for subsequent image<br>
processing. Asynchronous imaging can be achieved by capturing images at selected times<br>
by pulsing an instrument illumination at selected times and duty cycles for subsequent<br>
image processing.<br>
At 1320, a simple introduction process is selected for amount (or manual)<br>
analysis. Sample: can be introduced into an imaging device adapted in accordance with<br>
the present invention in any of the following (but not limited to) imaging processes:<br>
1) All proviously described methods and transmissive media as well as:<br>
2) Individual manual samples in cuvettes, slides, and/or transmissive medium.<br>
3) Contrious flow of particles in stream of gas or liquid, for example.<br>
4) With in imaging device configured for reflective imaging, samples may be<br>
opaque and presented on an opaque "carrier" (automasted and/or imaging) without<br>
substantial regard to the material analyzed.<br>
At 1530, a process control and/or monitoring system is configuard Real-time,<br>
closed loop and/or open loop monitoring, manufacturing with (e.g., closing loop around<br>
particle size), and control of processes by direct measurement of particle characteristics<br>
(e.g., size shape, morphology, cross section, distribution, density, packing fraction, and<br>
other parameters can be automatically determined). It is to be appearing that although<br><br>
direct measurment of techniques are performed on a given particle sample, that automated<br>
algorithms and/or processing can also be applied to the imaged sample if desired.<br>
Moreover, a direct measurement-based particle characterization device can be installed at<br>
substantially any given point in a manufacturing process to monitor and communicate<br>
particle characteristics for process control, quality control, and so forth by direct<br>
measurement.<br>
At 1340.2 plurality of different sample types can be selected for analysis. For<br>
example, particle samples in any of the aforementioned forms can be introduced in<br>
continuous flow, periodic, and/or asynchronous processes for direct measurement in a<br>
device as part ot a process closed-feedback-loop system lo control, record, and/or<br>
communicate particle characteristics of a given sample type (can also include open loop<br>
techniques if desired). Asynchronous and/or synchronous (the first defines imaging with<br>
a triggering signs sent by an event, or trigger signal initiated by an event or object<br>
generating a trigger signal to initiate imaging, the second defines imaging with a timing<br>
signal sent to trigger illumination. Asynchronous and/or synchronous imaging can be<br>
achieved by pulsing an illumination source to coincide with the desired image field with<br>
substantially any particle flow rate. This can be controlled by a computer, for example,<br>
and/or by a "trigger" mechanism, either mechanical, optical, and/or electronic, to "flash"<br>
solid state illustration on and off with a given duty cycle so that the image sensor<br>
captures, displays and records the image for precessing and analysis. This provides a<br>
straight-forward process of illuminating and imaging given that it effectively can be timed<br>
to "Stop the action" - or rather, "freeze" the motion of the flowing particles in the<br>
medium. In addition, this enables that a sample within the image field to capture particles<br>
within the field for subsequent image processing and analysis.<br>
Real-time (or substantially real time) closed loop and/or open loop monitoring,<br>
manufacturing with, and control of processes by k-space-based, direct measurement of<br>
particle characterization at 1340 is applicable to a broad range of processes including (but<br>
and limited to): Caramics, metal powders, pharmaceuticals, cement, minerals, ores,<br>
coatings, adhesives, pigments, dyes, carbon black, filter materials, explosives, food<br>
preparations, health &amp; cosmetic emulsions, polymers, plastics, micelles, beverages - and<br>
many more particle-based substances requiring process monitoring and control.<br><br>
Other applications include but are not limitcd to:<br>
• Instrument calibration and standards;<br>
• Industrial-hygiene research;<br>
• Material; research;<br>
• Energy and combustion studies,<br>
• Diesel- and gasoline-engine emissions measurements;<br>
• Industrial emissions sampling;<br>

• Bio-aerosol detection:<br>
• Pharmaceutical research;<br>
• Health and agricultural experiments;<br>
• Filter testing.<br>
At 1350, software and/or hardware based computerized image processing/analysis<br>
can occur. Images from a device adapted in accordance with the present invention can be<br>
processed in accordance with substantially any hardware and/or software process.<br>
Software-based mage processing can be achieved by custom software and/or<br>
commercialy available software since the image file formats are digital formats (e.g., but<br>
maps of capttured particles).<br>
Analysis, characterization and so forth can also be provided by the following: For<br>
example, analysis can be methologic (direct measurement based) and/or comprative<br>
(data-base) based.<br><br>
Comparative analyses can include comprisons to a database of image data for known<br>
particles and/or thereof. Advanced image processing can characterized and<br>
catalog images in t real-time and/or periodic sample-measurements. Data can be discarded<br>
and/or recorded; s desired, whereas data matching known sample characteristics can<br>
begin a suitable; elected response, for example. Furthermore, a device adapted in<br>
accordance with the present invention can be linked for communication in any date<br>
transmission process. This can included wireless, broadband, phone modem, standard<br>
telecom, Ethernet or other network protocols (e g. Internet, TCP/IP. Bluetooth, cable TV<br>
transmissions as well as others).<br>
Fig. 15 illustrates a fluorescence application 1400 in accordance with an aspect of<br>
the present invention that can be employed with the systems and processes previously<br>
described A k-space system is adapted in accordance with the present invention having a<br>
light system that includes a low intensity light source at 1410, such as a Light Emitting<br>
Diode (LED), emitting light having a wavelength of about 250 to about 400 nm (e.g.,<br>
ultraviolet light). The LED can be employed to provide for illumination, trans-<br>
illumination as described herein (or other type). The use of an LEO (or other low power<br>
UV light source) also enables waveguide illumination in which the UV excitation<br>
wavelength is introduced onto a planner surface supporting the object under test at 1420,<br>
such that evanescent-wave coupling of the UV light can excite fluorophores within the<br>
object. For example, the UV light can be provided at about a right angle to a substrate on<br>
which the object lica. At 1430, the LED (or other light source or combinations thereof)<br>
can emit light for a predetermined time period and/or be controlled in a stroke-like<br>
manner emitting pulses at a desired rate. At 1440 excitation is applied to the object for<br>
the period determined at 1430. At 1450, automated and/or manual analysis is performed<br>
on the object during (and/or thereabout) the excitation period.<br>
By way of illustration, the object which is sensitive to ultraviolet in that it<br>
fluoresoes in response to excitation of UV light from the light source. Fluorescence is a<br>
condition of a material (organic or inorganic) in which the material continues to emit light<br>
while absorbing excitation light. Fluiresceane can be inherent property of a material<br>
(e.g., auto-fluorescence) or it can be induced, such as by employing flurochrome stains or<br>
dyes. The dye can have an affimity to a particular protein or other receptiveness so as to<br><br>
facilitate discovering different conditions associated with the object. In one particular<br>
example, fluorescence microscopy and/or digital imaging provides a manner in which to<br>
study various materials that exhibit secondary fluorescence.<br>
By way of further example, the UV LED (or other source) can produce intense<br>
flashes of UV radiation for a short time period, with an image being constructed by a<br>
sensor (sensor adapted to the excitation wavelength) a short time later (e.g., milliseconds<br>
to seconds). This mode can be employed to investigate the time decay characteristics of<br>
the fluorescent components of the object (or sample) being tested. This may be<br>
important where two parts of the object (or different samples) may respond (e.g. ,<br>
fluoresce substantially the same under continuous illumination, but may have differing<br>
emission decay characteristics.<br>
As a result of using the low power UV light source, such as the LEO, the light<br>
from the light source can cause at least a portion of the object under test 10 emit light,<br>
generally not in the ultraviolet wavelength. Because at least a portion of the object<br>
fluoresces, preffered post-fluorescence images can be correlated relative to those obtained<br>
during fluorescence of the object to ascertain different characteristics of the object<br>
In contract, most conventional fluorecence systems are configured to imadiate a<br>
specimen and then to septate the much weaker re-radiating fluorescent light from the<br>
brighter excition light, typically through filters. In order to enable detectable<br>
fluorescence, such conventional systems usually require powerful light sources. For<br>
example, the light sources can be mercury or xenon are (burner) loops, which produce<br>
high-insensity illumination powerful enough to image fluorescence specimens. In<br>
addition to running hot (e.g., typically 100-250 Watt lamps), these types of light sources<br>
typically have short operating lives (e.g., 10-100 hours). In addition, a power supply for<br>
such conventional light sources often includes a timer to help track the number of use<br>
hours, as are lamps tend to become inefficient and are more likely to shorter, if utilized<br>
beyond their lifetime. Mostover, mercury burners generally do not provide even<br>
intensity across the spectrum from ultraviolet to infrared, as much of the intensity of the<br>
mercury burner is expended is tir near ultraviolet This often requires precision filtering<br>
to remove undersigned light wavelengths.<br><br>
Accordingly, it will be appreciated that using a UV LED, in accordance with an aspect of<br>
the present invention, provides a substantially even intensity at a desired UV wavelength<br>
to mitigate power consumption and beat generated through its use. Additionally, the<br>
replacement cost of a LED light source is significantly less than conventional lamps.<br>
Fig. 16 illustrates a thin films application 1500 in accordance with an aspect of the<br>
present invention. Films and thin films can be characterized in general terms as thin<br>
layers (varying from molecular thickness(es) to significant microscopic to macroscopic<br>
thickness(es) of some material, or multiple materials, deposited in a manner suitable to<br>
respective materials onto various substrates of choice and can include (but are not limited<br>
10) any of the fo lowing: metallic coating (e.g. reflective, including partial, opaque, and<br>
transmissivc), optical coatings (e.g., interference, transmission, anti-reflective, pass banel,<br>
blocking, protective. multi coat, and so forth), plating (eg. metallic, oxide, chemical.<br>
anti-oxidant, thermal, and so forth), electrically conductive (e.g. macro and micro-circuit<br>
deposited and constructed), optically conductive (e.g. deposited optical materials of<br>
varying index of refraction, micro- and macro-optical "circuits."). This can also include<br>
other coatings ar d layered film and film-like materials on any substrate which can be<br>
characterized by deposition in various manners so as to leave a desired layer of some<br>
material(s) on and substrate in a desired thickness, consisaency, continuity, uniformity,<br>
adhesion, and other parameters associated with any given deposited film. Associated thin<br>
film analysis can include detection of micro bubbles, voids, microscopic debris,<br>
depositing flaws, and so forth.<br>
Proceeding to 1510, a k-space system is configared for thin film analysis in<br>
accordance with an aspect of the present invention. The application of a k-space imaging<br>
device to the problem of thin-film inspection and characterization can be employed in<br>
identifying and characterizing flows in a thin film or films for example. Such a system<br>
can be adapted to facilitate:<br>
1) manual observation of a substrate with deposited thin film of all types;<br>
2) automatic observation/analysos and characterization of a substrate with<br>
deposited thin film of all types for pass-feel inspection;<br>
3) automatic obserwatio and characterization of a substrate with deposited thin<br>
film of all types for computer-controlled comparative disposition, this can<br><br>
include image data written to recording media of choice (e.g. CD-ROM,<br>
DVD-ROM) for verification, certification. and so forth<br>
A k-space device can be configured for imaging at desired Absolute Spatial<br>
Resolution (ASF ) per pixel and desired Effective Resolved Magnification (ERM) These<br>
parameters facilitate determining FOV, DOF, and WD, for example This can include<br>
objective-based design configurations and/or achromat- design configurations (e.g., for<br>
wide FOV and moderate ERM, and ASR) Illumination can be selected based on<br>
inspection paran eters as trans-illumination and/or epi-illumination, for example.<br>
At ! 520, a substrate is mounted in an imager in such a manner as to be scanned<br>
by.<br>
1) movement of an optical imaging path length by optical scanning method:<br>
and/or<br>
2) indexing an object being tested directly by a process of mechanical motion and<br>
control (e.g. automatic by computer o- manual by operator). This facilitates<br>
an inspection of an entire surface of portion of the surface as desired.<br>
As noted above in context of particle sizing, asynchronous imaging at selected timing<br>
intervals and/or in real-time for respective scanned areas (e.g. determined by FOV) of<br>
substrate at common video rates and/or ar image capture rates can be provided. Images of<br>
indexed and/or seamed areas can be captured with desired frequency for subsequent<br>
image processing. In addition, samples can be introduced into the device manually and/or<br>
in an automated manner from a "feed" such as from a conveyor system.<br>
At 1530, operational parameters for thin film applications ate detennined and<br>
applied. Typical operational parameters can include (but are not limited to:<br>
1) Imaging of various flaws and characteristics including, but not limited to,<br>
particles and holes on a surface(s) (or within) a thin film;<br>
2) Modular designs which can be varied as needed for both reflective and<br>
transparent surfaces;<br>
3) Automated counting and categorization of surface flaws by size, location,<br>
and/or number or successively indexed (and/or "scanned") image areas (with index<br>
identification and totals for respective sample surfaces);<br>
4) R4 gister location of defects for subsequent manual inspection;<br><br>
5) Provide images in standard format(s) for subsequent porting (e g. via<br>
Ethernet or othe - protocol) or manual and/or automated image processing for archive and<br>
documentation on a computer, server, and/or client; and/or<br>
6) Nominal scan time per surface of seconds to minutes dependent on total<br>
area. Scan and indexing speed generally understood to vary with sample area and<br>
subsequent processing.<br>
At 1540, software and/or hardware based computerized image processing/analysis<br>
can occur. Images from a device adapted in accordance with the present invention can be<br>
processed in accordance with substantially any hardware and/or software process.<br>
Software-based image processing can be achieved by custom software and/or<br>
commercially available software since the image file formats are digital formats (e. g. bit<br>
maps of captured films). Analysis, characterization and so forth can also be provided by<br>
the following: For example, analyses can be metrologic (direct measurement based)<br>
and/or compare ive (data-base) based. Comparative analyses can include comparisons to a<br>
database of image data for known films and/or variants thereof. Advanced image<br>
processing can characterize and catalog images in real-time and/or periodic sample-<br>
measurements. Data can be discarded and/or recorded as desired, whereas data matching<br>
known sample characteristics can begin a suitable selected response, for example.<br>
Furthermore, a device adapted in accordance with the present invention can be linked for<br>
communication in any data transmission process. This can included wireless, broadbond,<br>
phone moderm, modern telecom. Ethernet or other network protocols (e.g., Internet,<br>
TCP/IP. Bluetooth, cable TV transmissions as well as others).<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, an imaging system adapted as described<br>
above provides high effective resolved magnification and high spatial resolution among<br>
other features of biological material and methode that can be combined to provide<br>
improved biological material imaging systems and methods. The biological material<br>
imaging systems and methods of the present invention enable the production of improved<br>
images (higher affective magnification, improved resolution, improved depth of field, and<br>
the like) leading to the identification of biological materials as well as the classification of<br>

limiting examples as a limit of cells and other biological material can be listed.<br>
The identification or classification of biological material can in some instances<br>
lead to the diagrosis of disease. Thus, the present invention also provides improved<br>
system and methods of diagnosis. For example, the present invention also provides<br>
methods for detection and charaterization of medical pathologies such as cancer,<br>
pathologies of systems, digestive systems, improductive systems, and the<br>
alimantary canal, in addition to atherosclerisis, segiments, autoriosclerosis,<br>
inflamation, authoclerotic heart disease, mycocdial infenction, neuma to arterial or<br>
veinal walls, neurodegenerative disorders, and cardiopharmacy disorders. The present<br>
invention also provides memods for detection and characterization of vital and bacterial<br>
infections. The present invention also enables assessing the effects of various agents or<br><br>
physiological activities on biological materials, in both in vitro and in vivo systems, for<br>
example, the present invention enables assessment of the effect of a physiological agent,<br>
such as a drug, on a population of cells or tissue grown in culture.<br>
The biological material imaging system of the present invention enables computer<br>
driven control or automated process control to obtain data from biological material<br>
samples. In this connection, a computer or processor, coupled with the biological<br>
material imagins system, contains or is coupled to a memory or data base containing<br>
images of biological material, such as diseased cells of various types. In this context,<br>
automatic designation of normal and abnormal biological material may be made. The<br>
biological mater al imaging system secures images from a given biological material<br>
sample, and the mages are compared with images in the memory, such as images of<br>
diseased cells in the memory. In one sense, the computer/processor performs a<br>
comparison analysis of collected image data and stored image data, and based on the<br>
results of the anlysis, formulates a determination of the identity of a given biological<br>
material; of the classification of a given biological material (normal/abnormal,<br>
cancerous/non-incerous, benign/malignant, infected/not infected, and the like); and/or of<br>
a condition (diagnosis).<br>
If the computer/processor deternines that a sufficient degree of similarity is<br>
present between particular images from a biological material sample and saved images<br>
(such as of deseased cells or of the same biological meterial), then the image is saved and<br>
data associated with the image may be generated. If the computer/processor determines<br>
that a sufficient degree of similarity is not present between particular image of a<br>
biological material sample and saved images of diseased cells/particular biological<br>
material, then the biological material sample is repositioned and additional images are<br>
compared with images in the memory. It is to be appreciated that statistical methods can<br>
be applied by the computer/processor to assist in the determination that a sufficient degree<br>
of similarity is present between particular images from a biological material sample and<br>
saved images of biological material. Any suitable corretation means, memory, opearting<br>
system, analysies component, and software/hardware may be employed by the<br>
computer/processor.<br>
Referring to Figure 17, as examplary aspect of an automated biological material<br><br>
imaging system 1600 in accordance with one aspect of the present invention enabling<br>
computer driven control or automated process control to obtain data from biological<br>
material samples is shown. An imaging system 1602 described/configured m connection<br>
with Figs. 1 -16 above may be employed to capture an image of a biological maternal 1604.<br>
The imaging system 1602 is coupled to a processor 1606 and/or computer that reads the<br>
image generated by the imaging system 1602 and compares the image to a variety of<br>
images in the data store 1608.<br>
The processor 1606 contains an analysis component to make the comparison.<br>
Some of the mary algorithms used in image processing include convolution (on which<br>
many others are cased), FFT, OCT. thinning (ot skeletonisation), edge detection and<br>
contrast enhancement. These are usually implemented in software but may also use<br>
special purpose hardware for speed. FFT (fast Fourier transform) is an algorithm for<br>
computing the Fourier transform of a set of discrete data values. Given a finite set of data<br>
points, for example, a periodic sampling taken from a real-world signal, the FFT<br>
expresses the data in terms of its component frequencies. It also addresses the essentially<br>
identical inverse comcerns of reconstruction a signal from the frequency data DCT<br>
(discrete cosine transform) is technique for expressing a waveform as a weighted sum of<br>
cosines. There are several applications designed for image processing, e.g., CELIP<br>
(cellular languages for image processing) and VPL (visual programming language).<br>
The data store 1908 contains one or moresets of predetermined images. The<br>
images may include normal images of various biological materials and/or abnormal<br>
images of various biological materials (diseased, mutated, physically disrupted, and the <br>
like). The images stored in the data store 1608 provide a basis to determine whether or<br>
not a given captured image is similar or not similar or not simitar (or the degree of similarity) to the<br>
stored images. In one aspect, the automated biological material imaging system 1600 can<br>
be employed to determine if a biological material sample is normal or abnormal. For<br>
example, the automated biological material imaging system 1600 can identify the<br>
presence of diseased cells, such as cancerous cells, in a biological material sample,<br>
thereby facilitating diagnosis of a given disease or condition. In another aspect, the<br>
automated biological material imaging system 1600 can diagnose the illnesses/diseases<br>
listed above by identifying the presence of an illness causing biological material (such as<br><br>
an illness causing bacteria described above) and/or determining that a given biological<br>
material is infaced with an illness causing entity such as a bacteria or determining that a<br>
given biological material is abnormal (cancerous).<br>
In yet anoher aspect, the automated biological material imaging system 1600 can<br>
be employed to detetermine the identity of a biological material of unknown origin. For<br>
example, the automated biological material imaging system 1600 can identify a white<br>
powder as containing anthrax. The automated biological material imaging system 1600<br>
can also facilitate processing biological material, such as performing white blood cell or<br>
red blood cell counts on samples of blood, for example<br>
The computer/processor 1606 may be coupled to a controller which controls a<br>
servo motor or other means of moving the biological material sample within an object<br>
plane so that remote/hands free imaging is facilitated. That is, motors, adjusters, and/or<br>
other mechanical means can be employed to move the biological material sample slide<br>
within the object field of view.<br>
Moreover, since the images of the biological material examination process are<br>
optimized for viewing from a computer screen, television, and/or closed circuit monitor,<br>
remote and web based wiewing and control may be implemented. Real tone imaging<br>
facilitates at least one of repid diagnosis, data collection/generation, and the like.<br>
In another aspect, the biological material imaging system is directed to a portion of<br>
a human (such as lesion on an arm, here on the cornes, and the like) and images formed.<br>
The images can be sent to a computer/processor (or across network such as internet),<br>
which is instructed to identify the possible presence of a particular type of diseased cell<br>
(an image of which is stored in memory). When a diseased cell is identified, the<br>
computer/processor instructs the system to remove/destroy the diseased cell, for example,<br>
employing a laser, liquid nitrogen, cutting instrument, and/or the like.<br>
Fig. 18 depicts a high-level machine vision system 1800 in accordance with the<br>
subjact invention. The system 1800 includes an imaging system 10 (Fig. 1) in accordance<br>
with the subject invention. The imaging system 10 is discussed in substantial detail supra<br>
and thus further discussion regarding details related thereto is omitted for sake of brevity.<br>
The imaging system 10 can be employed to collect data relating to a product or process<br>
1810, and provide the image information to a controller 1820 that can regulate the product<br><br>
or process 1810 for example, with respect to production, process control, quality control,<br>
testing, inspection, etc. The imaging system 10 as noted above provides for collecting<br>
image data at a granularity not achievable by many conventional systems. Moreover, the<br>
robust image da a provided by the subject imaging system 10 can afford for highly<br>
effective machire vision inspection of the product or process 1810. For example, minute<br>
product defects typically not detectable by many conventional machine vision systems can<br>
be detected by the subject system 1800 as a result of the image data collected by the<br>
imaging system 10. The controller 1810 can be any suitable controller or control system<br>
employed in connection with a fabrication scheme, for example. The controller 1810 can<br>
employ the collected image data to reject a defective product or process, revise a product<br>
or process, accept a product or process, etc. as is common to machine vision based control<br>
systems. It is to be appreciated that the system 1800 can be employed in any suitable<br>
machine-vision based environment, and all such applications of the subject invention are<br>
intended to fall within the scope of the hereto appended claims.<br>
For example, the subject system 1800 could be employed in connection with<br>
semiconductor fabrication where device and/or process tolerances are critical to<br>
manufacturing consistent reliable semiconductor-based produce. Thus, the product 1810<br>
could represent a semiconductor wafer, for example, and the imaging system 1800 could<br>
be employed to callect data (e.g., critecal dimensions, thicknesses, prtential defects, other<br>
physical aspects.) relating to devices being formed on the water. The controller 1820<br>
can employ the collected data to reject the water because of various defects, modify a <br>
process in connection with fabricating devices on the wafer, accept the wafer, etc.<br>
What has been described above are preferred aspects of the present invention. It<br>
is, of course, not possible to describe every conceivable combination of components or<br>
methodologies for purposes of describing the present invention, but one of ordinary skill<br>
in the art will recognize that many further combinations and permutations of the present<br>
invention are posible. Accordingly, the present invention is intended to embrace all such<br>
