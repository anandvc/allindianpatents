				<td>Method of modulation of interaction between receptor and ligand Field of invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method for modulating the interaction between at least two proteins, wherein at least one of the two proteins is a functional cell-surface receptor and the other protein is the receptor ligand. The invention preferably concerns interaction of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) and FGFR ligands. The invention further relates to a series of amino acid sequences involved in forming a binding site for FGFR in a FGFR ligand. Moreover, the present invention features the methods for molecular design and screening of a candidate compound capable of modulating the interaction between FGFR and a protein having the above binding site, and provides a screening assay for identification of such a compound.<br>
Background of invention<br>
Neural cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) of the immunoglobulin superfamily nucleate and maintain groups of cells at key sites during early development and in the adult. In addition to their adhesive properties, CAMs homophylic and heterophylic interac­tions can affect intracellular signaling. Their ability to influence developmental events, including cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation may therefore result both from their adhesive as well as their signaling properties.<br>
' •-* \. -<br>
The neural cell adhesion molecule, NCAM, was the first discovered neural CAM. Since the discovery NCAM has been intensively studied and now it is well character­ised.<br>
NCAM belongs to the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily. Its extracellular part consists of five Ig-like and two fibronectin type III (F3) modules (Berezin et at., 2000). NCAM assists both the cell-cell and cell-substratum interactions. NCAM binds to various extracellular matrix components such as heparin/heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, and different types of collagen. Cell-cell interactions are mostly as­sisted by the NCAM homophilic interaction.<br>
The different modules of NCAM have been shown to perform distinct functions. Thus, NCAM homophilic binding is believed now to depend on the first three Ig modules. The heparin binding sequence is localized to the Ig2 module. NCAM also binds to the neural cell adhesion molecule L1. This interaction is believed to take place between the fourth Ig module of NCAM and an oligomannosidic moiety ex­pressed on L1. The two membrane-proximal F3 modules of NCAM has been sug­gested to be involved in FGFR binding. Among a number of ligands of NCAM the most intriguing remain to be ATP. NCAM has been demonstrated to hydrolyze ex-tracellularly adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (Dzhandzhugazyan and Bock, 1993 and 1997), and the proximal F3 modules have been suggested to be involved in this activity of NCAM. Recently, ATP has been demonstrated to be a modulator of NCAM induced neuritogenesis (Skladchikova et al., 1999). However, the role ex­tracellular ATP, which is one of the most abundant neurotransmitters in the brain, in relation to known biological functions of NCAM is not well understood.<br>
A number of research groups has now accumulated a large body of evidence indi­cating that intracellular signaling cascades underlying the NCAM-mediated axonal outgrowth are similar to signal transduction cascades which are activated due to stimulation of the fibtoblast growth factor receptor (FGFR).<br>
Fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) are a family of four closely related re­ceptor protein tyrosine kinases consisting extracellularly of three Ig-like modules and intracellularly of a split tyrosine-kinase module (Powers et al., 2000). The receptors are known as key regulators of morphogenesis, development, angiogenesis, and wound healing. FGFR activation and signaling are dependent on dimerization of the receptor which is induced by a high affinity binding of its ligand, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and it also requires participation of cell surface heparin or heparan sulphate proteoglycans.<br>
The major neural CAMs, NCAM, L1 and N-cadherin, all have been regarded as a new class of putative alternative ligands of FGFR, although there have not been so far obtained any evidence for a direct interaction between these CAMs and the re­ceptor so far. The identification of a common structural motif which might be a pre­requisite for the interaction with FGFR seems to be very advantageous in view of<br>
the development of new drugs for the treatment of a variety of pathologic disorders where the regulation of activity of FGFR may play the key role.<br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
Method for modulation of interaction between two proteins<br>
Cells of a multicellular organism communicate to each other and respond to a vari­ety of signals of the cellular environment using an elaborate system of communica­tion. This system enables a single cell to respond adequately to arrays of the signals by employing a finely tuned network of interactions between molecules of cell-surface receptors receiving the signals and the many cell-surface and intracellular proteins adapting and transmitting the signal into the cell. A minor intervention into a single interaction of this network may often lead to a major change in a specific cel­lular response to the extracellular signal.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates in one aspect to a method of modulating the interaction between at least two different proteins, wherein one of the at least two different proteins is represented by a functional cell-surface receptor, or a frag­ment, or a variant thereof, and the other of the at least two different proteins is rep­resented by a polypeptide having a binding site to said receptor, wherein at least a<br>
part of said binding site comprises at least one of the sequences set forth in SEQ ID NOS: 1-146, or fragments, or variants, or homologues of said sequences, or frag­ments or variants of said homologues, comprising<br>
i) providing a compound capable of interacting with the receptor and/or polypeptide thereby interfering with the interaction of said receptor and said poly-peptide,<br>
ii) presenting the compound of step (i) to the at least two different pro­teins.<br>
Thus, modulation of interaction between a functional cell-surface receptor and an­other protein is the first objective of the method of the invention.<br>
In the present context by the term "interaction" is meant that a functional cell-surface receptor has a transient or permanent direct or indirect contact with another protein.<br>
Functional cell surface receptor<br>
A cell-surface receptor is defined in the content of the present invention as any molecule comprising at least one polypeptide chain, said molecule being associated with the plasma membrane of a cell in such a way that enables said molecule to receive a signal at the outer side of the membrane, transduce the signal through the membrane, and convey said signal further by inducing a certain action on molecular level inside the cell, for example by inducing association or dissociation of molecular complexes, or initiating a biochemical reaction, for example auto-phosphorylation of the receptor, or proteolytic cleavage of the receptor leading to initiation of intracellu-lar signal transduction.<br>
The invention designates to a "functional cell-surface receptor". "Functional cell-surface receptor" is meant that the cell-surface receptor of the invention has an identifiable group of ligands, the binding of these ligands to the receptor induces intracellular signal transduction, which results in a physiological response of the cell. The physiological response, such as for example differentiation, proliferation, sur­vival, apoptosis or motility of a cell, depends on the ligand that is involved in the in­teraction with the receptor, and/or characteristics of said interaction, such as the affinity or duration, and/or a species of the cell which expresses the receptor. By the<br>
term "ligand" is defined a compound which is capable to bind to the receptor and thereby to activate said receptor. "Activation" of a receptor is meant that after ex­tracellular binding of a ligand the receptor became capable to transmit the effect of "ligand binding" into a cascade of biochemical reactions collectively termed "receptor signaling" or "signal transduction" inside the cell resulting in one of the above men­tioned physiological responses of the cell.<br>
A capability of a cell-surface receptor to induce and/or maintain a cellular process upon the ligand binding is herein termed "biological function" of the receptor.<br>
The functional cell-surface receptor of the invention, which recognises and interacts with another protein, is, in a preferred embodiment, a receptor of the family of fibre-blast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) comprising FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3 and FGFR4. In the most preferred embodiment a cell-surface receptor of the invention is FGFR1 or a functional homologue thereof.<br>
By the term "functional homologue of the receptor" is meant a molecule which is<br>
capable of<br>
i)         extracellular binding of a ligand of FGFR and thereby activating the receptor<br>
dependent signal transduction cascade in the cell, and/or if)        intracellular binding of an adaptor molecule of FGFR and thereby activating<br>
the receptor dependent signal transduction cascade in the cell.<br>
The term "binding" refers to a direct or indirect interaction between an FGFR homo­logue and a counter molecule having a binding site for FGFR. In the present context the counter molecule is an extracellular ligand of FGFR, or an intracellular adaptor molecule. An "adaptor molecule" is defined in the content of the invention as a molecule, which is capable to recognize an "active state" of the receptor, selectively bind to such receptor and convey the signal of "activatated receptor" in the cell by inducing a cascade of reactions of signal transduction. An intracellular adaptor molecule may be represented by for example STN, FRS, Grb, SHP2, PLCy, or PIPS.<br>
The invention relates to ligands having a relatively low affinity to FGFR. The affinity means the strength of attraction between molecules. The ligand of FGFR in the pre-<br>
sent context is determined as a molecule, which comprises at least one binding site to FGFR and is capable of low affinity binding to the receptor. Thus, according to the invention, the other protein, which is involved in interaction with the cell-surface re­ceptor is in one aspect a ligand of FGFR.<br>
Binding _site<br>
According to the invention a cell-surface receptor interacts with another protein through a receptor binding site, said binding site being located on said another pro­tein. The binding site of a molecule may be defined as a specific part of said mole­cule, which is involved in interaction with another molecule. In the present context "binding site" is defined as a fragment of a protein, specific features of which confer on the protein a capacity to interact directly and selectively with another molecule, for example a receptor molecule. Under" specific features" in the present context is understood a particular amino acid sequence or the three-dimensional structure of that fragment of a protein which is referred as the binding site. By the term "selec­tively" in the present context is meant that the binding site is involved in interaction with the certain molecule or certain group of molecules, said molecule(s) having a specific structure which makes said molecule(s) capable to recognise the binding site and interact with it.<br>
In one embodiment the present invention features a binding site to a cell-surface receptor, wherein at least a part of said binding site comprises at least one of the sequences set forth in SEQ ID NOS: 1-146, or fragments, or variants, or homo-logues of said sequences, or fragments or variants of said homologues, such as the fragments, variants and homologues defined below.<br>
In another embodiment the binding site comprises, or at least part of said binding site comprises at least one of the sequences set forth in SEQ ID NOS: 1-10, 100, 125, such as for example SEQ ID NOS: 2-10,100,125, or fragments or variants, or homologues said sequences, or fragments or variants of said homologues. The pre­sent invention relates to fragments having at least 40%, more preferably at least 50%, more preferably at least 60%, more preferably at least 70%, more preferably at least 80%, more preferably at least 90%, more preferably at least 95% of the length of a predetermined sequence set forth in SEQ ID NOS: 1-10, 100, 125, or SEQ ID<br>
NOS: 2-10, 100, 125, wherein an amino acid sequence homology between a frag­ment and the predetermined sequence is 100%. A variant in the present context is defined as an amino acid sequence having at least 60 %, more preferably at least 70%, more preferably at least 80%, more preferably at least 90%, more preferably 95% homology to a sequence selected from SEQ ID NOS: 1-10, 100, 125, or SEQ ID NOS: 2-10, 100, 125, or an amino acid sequence having at least 60 %, more preferably at least 70%, more preferably at least 80%, more preferably at least 90%, more preferably 95% positive amino acid matches compared to a sequence se­lected from SEQ ID NOS: 1-10, 100, 125, or SEQ ID NOS: 2-10, 100, 125. A posi­tive amino acid match is defined as an identity or similarity defined by physical and/or chemical properties of the amino acids having the same position in two com­pared sequences. Preferred positive amino acid matches of the present invention are K to R, E to D, L to M, Q to E, I to V, I to L, A to S, Y to W, K to Q, S to T, N to S and Q to R. The homology of one amino acid sequence with another amino acid is defined as a percentage of identical amino acids in the two collated sequences. A homologue in the present context is defined as an amino acid sequence which has less then 60% and more then 19 %, such as 50-59%, for example 55%, such as 40-49%, for example 45%, such as 30-39%, for example 35%, such as 20-29%, for example 25% homology to any of the sequences set forth in SEQ ID NOS: 1-10, 100, 125, or SEQ ID NOS: 2-10, 100, 125 having remained some of the physical properties of the predetermined sequences, such as for example the three-dimensional structure or some of the functional properties, such as for example a capability to interact with another molecule, in particular with a receptor molecule. A variant of a homologue in the present context is defined as an amino acid sequence having at least 60 %, more preferably at least 70%, more preferably at least 80%, more preferably at least 90%, more preferably 95% positive amino acid matches compared to a homologue of any of the sequences selected from SEQ ID NOS: 1-10, 100, 125, or SEQ ID NOS: 2-10, 100, 125. Preferred embodiments of the posi­tive amino acid matches is as the defined above. The invention concerns the frag­ments, variants and homologues, which remain a capability of the predetermined sequences to interact with the cell-surface receptor defined above.<br>
In still another embodiment the invention features a binding site comprising at least one variant, or fragment, or homologue of any of the sequences set forth in SEQ ID NOS: 1-10, 100, 125, or SEQ ID NOS: 2-10, 100, 125, said variant, or fragment, or<br>
homologue being preferably selected from the sequences identified in SEQ ID NOS: 11-99,101-124,126-146.<br>
The described above binding site is according to invention characterised by specific structural features. The invention preferably features a binding site, which essen­tially consists of one or more "strand-loop-strand" structural motifs.<br>
Side chains of the amino acids in a contiguous amino acid sequence interact to each other. The numerous interactions lead to folding the amino acid sequence into a specific structural pattern, such as a-helix and p-strand, which is usually deter­mined by the amino acids of the sequence. Interactions between amino acids of the individual patterns hold the long amino acid sequence of a polypeptide folded in a compact tertiary structure. In a tertiary structure the amino acid sequence of a poly­peptide tends to wind its way back and forth across the entire structure, either as an a-helix or p-strand, reversing its direction suddenly by making a turn and creating thus the loop regions. The loop regions, which may vary in length and have irregular shape, often form biding sites for other molecules. The present invention concerns a binding site, which comprises at least one loop region. It is preferred, if the at least one loop region in the binding site connects two interacting p-strands forming thereby a "strahd-loop-strand" structural motif. By the term "motif" in the present content is meant a unit of the polypeptide chain of a protein having the defined se­quence of amino acids of certain length and/or characterised by specific structural features and/or (optionally) having certain functional capabilities common for a group of proteins.<br>
Polvpeptide comprising a binding site<br>
As it has been mentioned above, certain combinations of a-helices and p-strands pack together and form a compactly folded tertiary structure of the protein. If the protein comprises a long amino acid sequence, such as for example more then 100 amino acids, its tertiary structure may consist of several modular units, each of which is called a protein domain. Domains are usually constructed from a section of polypeptide chain that contains between 50 and 350 amino acids. Because there is only a limited number of ways of combining a-helices and p-strands to make a globular structure, certain combinations of these elements may occur repeatedly in<br>
the core of related and also unrelated proteins bestowing some common structural features on these proteins. The present invention contemplates both the proteins having common structural characteristics, structurally related proteins, and structur­ally unrelated proteins. In a preferred embodiment the invention concerns at least two different proteins capable of interacting to each other, wherein at least one of the at least two proteins comprises at least two immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains and/or at least two fibronectin type 3 (F3) domains, or at least one Ig-like domain and at least one F3 domain.<br>
According to the invention a functional cell-surface receptor interacts with another protein. The invention preferably relates to the interaction between a cell-surface receptor and a heterologous protein. By the term "heterologous" in the present con­text Is meant a protein the amino acid sequence of which has at most 40% homol-ogy and/or at most 50% of positive amino acid matches with the amino acid se­quence of a polypeptide chain of the receptor. Preferably said heterologous protein itself is not capable to execute any biological function of the receptor. A heterolo­gous protein is preferably an extracellular protein or a protein, at least part of which is exposed to the extracellular space. However, any heterologous protein which has more then 40% homology and/or more then 50% of positive amino acid matches with the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide chain of the receptor Is in the scope of the invention, if said protein comprises a binding site to the receptor described above.<br>
The present invention relates to a heterologous protein comprising the above de­scribed binding site, which is preferably selected from the group comprising trans-membrane, cell-surface associated, extracellular matrix associated or soluble pro­teins.<br>
A protein is in the present context defined as "transmembrane" if at least one part of the polypeptide chain of said protein is positioned extracellularly, at least one part of the polypeptide chain of said protein is represented by the plasma membrane span­ning domain, and at least one part of the polypeptide chain of said protein is posi­tioned intracellularly, wherein the at least one extracellular part is connected with the at least one intracellular part via the at least one membrane spanning domain.<br>
In the present context "plasma membrane associated protein" is defined as a protein having a direct or indirect contact with the plasma membrane. The "direct" contact is meant that the protein has an immediate connection with the membrane assisted by a moiety covalently attached to said protein, such as for example a lipid moiety, for example glycosylphosphatidylinositol or a fatty acid moiety. The "indirect" contact is meant that the protein has a connection with the membrane through another mole­cule which said protein is associated with in a complex, for example another protein, lipopolysaccharide or proteoglycan molecule.<br>
The extracellular matrix associated protein in the present context is defined as a protein, or a molecule comprising a polypeptide chain, said protein or said molecule being attached to a component of the extracellular matrix through a chemical bond, or said protein or said molecule itself being an immediate component of the extracel­lular matrix.<br>
The soluble protein in the present context is meant a protein, which is present free in solution in the extracellular space, such as for example a secreted protein, or a shed protein produced due to extracellular proteolysis of the membrane associated pro­tein.<br>
Furthermore, the invention features particular polypeptides from the above groups, which are preferably selected from cell adhesion molecules, cell-surface receptors, proteoglycans, membrane-anchored cell-surface proteolytic enzymes, extracellular matrix molecules, or growth factors.<br>

By the wording " fragments, or variants" of the above polypeptides is meant (i) polypeptide(s) essentially consisting of the amino acid sequence of the pre­determined polypeptide, wherein the length of amino acid sequence of said polypeptide(s) being shorter or longer then the length of said predetermined polypeptide, said polypeptide(s) being capable to interact with the functional cell-surface receptor according to invention and/or<br>
(ii) polypeptide(s) comprising at least a fragment of the amino acid sequence of the predetermined polypeptide, or a fragment of a sequence having at least 60% homology to the sequence of said predetermined polypeptide, wherein the length of said fragment consists of at least 25% of the length of the pre-<br>
determined polypeptide, said polypeptides being capable of interacting with the functional cell-surface receptor according to invention, and/or<br>
(iii) polypeptides essentially having the features described in prior art for the predetermined polypeptide, said features being essential for the interaction of said polypeptides with the cell-surface receptor according to invention, and/or<br>
(iv) polypeptides lacking one or more features described in prior art for the pre­determined polypeptide, said polypeptides being capable of interacting with the functional cell-surface receptor according to invention.<br>
Such fragments or variants may be selected from, but not limited by examples of naturally occurring isoforms of the above polypeptides, pro-polypeptides, proteolytic fragments of the above polypeptides, corresponding recombinant polypeptides or fusion proteins containing amino acid sequences derived from the above polypep­tides.<br>
Affinity of interaction<br>
Any interaction between two molecules may be characterised by its affinity, which means the strength of attraction between two molecules. The affinity of interaction is commonly expressed by a value of Kd, a dissociation equilibrium constant. Kd re­flects a ratio between the rate of dissociation and the rate of binding between two molecules and thus represents a measure of the strength of binding between two molecules. The stronger the binding, the lower is the value of Kd. The invention relates to a low affinity interaction between a cell-surface receptor and another pro­tein, such as the defined above. The low affinity interaction of the invention is char­acterised by Kd having a value in the range of 10"3 to 10~10, such for example in the range of IffMoKV8.<br>
According to the invention affinity of the interaction is determined by surface plas-mon resonance analysis (SPR) or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (IMMR).<br>
Modulation of interaction<br>
By the term "modulation" in relation to interaction between two molecules is meant a change in the strength of interaction, such as either a decrease or increase in the strength of interaction. Modulation of interaction takes place when it is important to adjust the strength of interaction between molecules adequately to a change in the situation dependent on said interaction. For example, modulating the strength of interaction between a receptor and receptor ligand makes possible the modulating the receptor dependent signal transduction and thereby the physiological status of the cell.<br>
By "modulating receptor signalling" is meant activation or inhibition of the production of a cascade of messenger molecules, which normally takes place in the cell in re­sponse to activation of the receptor by an extracellular stimulus.<br>
The receptor signaling leads to a physiological response of the cell. Therefore, modulating the strength of interaction between a receptor and the receptor ligand, otherwise termed "strength of receptor stimulation", makes possible to modulate the receptor signaling, and thereby a physiological response of the cell. It has been shown that the cellular response to stimulation of a receptor depends on the strength of receptor stimulation, which may, for example, be characterised by the value of affinity of interaction of the receptor with a ligand, and/or by the duration of such interaction. The both affinity and duration of interaction may be affected if the interacting molecules are exposed to a compound capable of modulating the inter­action.<br>

Screening assay<br>
Modulation of a receptor-ligand interaction may be assessed by using a number of in vitro assays developed in the art. However, there are no any universal approach in selection of these assays for estimation of the capability of candidate compounds to modulate the interaction between different receptors and their ligands. The pre­sent invention provides an assay for sequential screening of a candidate compound capable of modulating the interaction between at least two different proteins, wherein one of the least two different proteins is represented by a functional cell-surface receptor, or a fragment, or a variant thereof, and another of the at least two<br>

ii)        presenting the at least one receptor molecule of step (i) to the at least one poiypeptide of step (i), or presenting the at least one poiypeptide of step (i) to the at least one receptor molecule of step (i) and permitting the interaction between said receptor and said poiypeptide, followed by the iii)       recording the interaction between the molecules of step (ii), iv)       presenting the candidate compound to the molecules of step (ii); v)       recording the interaction between the molecules of step (iv), followed by the vi)       assessment of at least one effect of the candidate compound on the interac­tion between the molecules of step (iv), followed by the<br>
vii) selection of a compound capable of modulating the interaction between the at least one functional cell-surface receptor molecule and the at least one poiypeptide of step (i).<br>
By the term "permitting the interaction" in the present content is meant that condi­tions of step (ii) include a suitable medium in which the interaction is favoured and long enough time interval to allow the molecules to interact.<br>
The steps (ii)-(v) of the above assay may optionally be performed as the following: (ii) presenting the compound to the at least one receptor molecule of step (i) or pre­senting the compound to the at least one poiypeptide of step (i), (iii) presenting at least one poiypeptide of step (i) to the compound and receptor of step (ii) or present­ing the at least one receptor molecule to the compound and poiypeptide of step (i), (iv) recording the interaction between the molecules of step (iii). If the latter option is used, a candidate compound is selected when no interaction between the molecules<br>
of step (iii) has been recorded or the recorded interaction has been modulated com­pared to the interaction between said molecules in the absence of said compound. It is presumed that parameters of interaction between the receptor and the polypep-tide in the absence of the compound have been assessed using any of the de­scribed below methods before performing the modified assay.<br>
The described above assay is preferably provided by the invention for the sequential screening of a candidate compound capable of modulation of interaction between FGFR1 and the FGFR1 ligand, said ligand being one of the polypeptides described above. In a preferred embodiment the ligand is NCAM.<br>
Assessment of the effect of a candidate compound on the interaction between the molecules fo the assay may be done by using a conventional method of the art, such as for example surface plasmon resonance analysis (SPR), nucleic magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), sedimentation analysis, immunoprecipitation, two-hybrid system, or resonance energy transfer (BRET or FRET). A candidate com­pound capable of modulating the interaction may be selected from compounds de­creasing the strength of interaction between the receptor and the receptor ligand or from compounds increasing the strength of the interaction.<br>
After the selection the candidate compound is according to the invention to be tested in an in vivo or in an in vitro cell system to evaluate significance of the re­corded modulation for cellular metabolism. In such a system it may in one embodi­ment be measured a cell-surface receptor associated downstream signaling event, for example activation of a downstream protein. If the protein involved in interaction with a cell-surface receptor is represented by a receptor-like molecule, it may in an­other embodiment be measured a downstream signaling event'associated with said protein. Therefore, the invention further provides a screening method for the com­pound selected on Step (vii) of the above assay, comprising viii)     presenting the selected compound to at least one cell presenting the at least one functional cell-surface receptor molecule, or a fragment, or a variant thereof, and the at least one polypeptide having a binding site to said recep­tor, wherein at least a part of said binding site comprises at least one of the sequences set forth in SEQ ID NOS: 1-146, or fragments, or variants, or<br>
homologues of said sequences, or a fragments or a variants of said homo-iogues with the compound of step (vii) of the above assay, ix)       assessing at least one effect of the compound on the cell of step (viii).<br>
The invention preferably concerns an FGFR1-associated downstream signaling event, which may be selected from estimation of i) the FGFR1 tyrosine phosphoryla-tion; ii) the activation of one or more intracellular proteins involved in any of the FGFR-associated signal transduction pathways, such as for example the STAT1, JNK, PLCy, ERK, STATS, PI3K, PKC, FRS2 and/or GRB2 proteins; and/or iii) a cell differentiation-related effect.<br>
When the FGFR signalling is measured as a level of phosphorylation of FGFR, the degree of phoshorylation is estimated as at least 20% above the control value, such as at least 20-200 %, for example at least 50-200%. The control value in the present content is meant the degree of phosphorylation of FGFR in the medium where a compound capable of activation of FGFR is absent.<br>
When estimating an efficient concentration of a compound with respect to modulat­ing of the FGFR signalling, said concentration may be between 0.1-1000 juM, 1-1000 |j,M, for example 1-200 piM, for example 10-200 yM, such as 20-180 jaM, for example 30-160 jiM, such as 40-140 jiM, for example 50-130 jiM, such as 60-120 liM, for example 70-110 pM, such as 80-100 pM.<br>
When estimating the downstream FGFR signaling effect such as a cell differentia­tion-related effect the invention preferably relates to cell aggregation, the formation of nodules, formation of cartilage, or two or more of said effects (Listrum, G. P. et al. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999, 47:1-6), such effect being detectable by light mi­croscopy, turbidimetry, or flow cytometry. The cell differentiation-related effect may also be measured as a change in expression at RNA or protein levels of bone sialo-protein (J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998, 13:1852-61; Genomics 1998, 53: 391-4), or type X collagen (Cell Tissue Res. 1998, 293: 357-64), the human ILA gene (Osteoarthri-tis Gartilage 1997, 5: 394-406), or type II collagen/or MGP (J Miner Res. 1997: 1815.23), and the like.<br>
The FGFR tyrosine phosphorylation or activation of any of the molecules of FGFR-associated downstream signaling, such as for example STST1, JNK, PLCy, ERK, STAT5, PI3K, PKC, FRS2 and/or GRB2 proteins, may be estimated by any conven­tional methods, such as for example immunocytochemistry, immunoblotting or im-munoprecipitation, using commercially available antibody against the activated pro­teins. The degree of activation is estimated as at least 20% above/below the control value, such as at least 20-200 %, for example at least 50-200%. The control value is estimated as a degree of phosphorylation of the protein of interest in the medium where a compound capable of activation of FGFR is absent.<br>
In another preferred embodiment the invention concerns the downstream signaling associated with a protein involved in interaction with FGFR, said protein being the FGFR1 ligand. Such downstream signaling is understood to be associated with a receptor-like ligand FGFR1. Preferred embodiments of such ligands of FGFR1 are disclosed above. It is understood that such ligands comprise the group of proteins, which have been associated with any downstream signal transduction cascade, or can potentially be associated with a downstream signal transduction cascade.<br>
The most preferred a receptor-like ligand of FGFR1 of the invention is NCAM.<br>
Therefore, the assay further concerns any in vitro or in vivo cellular systems com­prising at least one cell presenting at least one molecule of functional FGFR1 or a functional homologue thereof and at least one molecule of NCAM or a functional homologue thereof.<br>
NCAM-dependeht signal transduction involves the variety of downstream molecules, activation of which upon the signaling may be measured. The invention in particular concerns the assessment of activation of focal adhesion kinase FAK, tyrosine ki-nase Fyn and/or cyclic-AMP response-binding element protein CREB. The degree of phoshorylation is estimated as at least 20% above/below the control value, such as at least 20-200 %, for example at least 50-200%. The control value is estimated as above.<br>
Activation or inhibition of NCAM-dependent signal transduction may also be meas­ured by evaluating the cellular responses on morphological level, in particular cell<br>
differentiation-related effects. Accordingly, the assay concerns in another particular embodiment evaluation of the effect of a candidate compound on NCAM-dependent cellular aggregation, cell motility, neuritogenesis, proliferation or survival.<br>
A skilled artisan may select from a number of assays have developed in the art to evaluate the above cellular responses. Cellular aggregation and neuritogenesis may for example be evaluated as described by Skladchikova et al. J. Neurosci. Res 1999, 57: 207-18. Proliferation and apoptosis may be evaluated by using any com­mercially available assays and kits according to the manufacturer procedure.<br>
It is a preferred embodiment of the invention selecting a compound capable of modulating NCAM-FGFR1 interaction by evaluating the effect of the compound on neuritogenesis. Therefore, cells of neural origin, which are capable of neuronal dif­ferentiation, are preferred by the invention. Such cell may be selected from primary cells, which have been extracted from selected areas of the neural system of an organism! and maintained in culture according to standard methods, or the cells may be clonal cells, which have been transformed to immortality from different neural tumor or embryonic neural cells. Examples of such cells can be rat pheochromocy-toma PC 12, mouse neuroblastoma N2A, human teratocarcinoma NT-2 or mouse carcinoma F9.<br>
In the present invention a compound is considered promising when it is capable of doubling the neurite outgrowth of cultured cells when compared to control cells, such as improving neurite outgrowth three-fold, such as four-fold, for example five fold, such as six-fold.<br>
Further, the present assay in another preferred embodiment concerns the selection of a compound, which is capable of stimulating/promoting survival of cells by modu­lating the FGFR1-NCAM interaction. In the present context the wording "stimulat­ing/promoting survival" is used synonymously with the wording "preventing cell death" or "neuro-protection". By stimulating/promoting survival it is possible to pre­vent diseases or prevent further degeneration of the nervous system in individuals suffering from a neuro-degenerative disorder. "Survival" refers to the process, wherein a cell has been traumatised and would under normal circumstances, with a high probability die, if not the compound of the invention was used to prevent said cell from degenerating, and thus promoting or stimulating survival of said trauma-<br>
tised cell. In particular the invention concerns promoting or stimulating the survival of cell of neural origin.<br>
A cell culture of the assay may further comprise mammalian cells of non-neural ori­gin. Examples of such cells may for example include HEK293, COS7, CHO or TREX293. These cells may desirably be transformed to express different variants or homologues of FGFR or NCAM by using the methods well known in art, such as for example methods of stable or transient transfection of cells with DNA constructs encoding different variants or homologues of FGFR and/or NCAM and/or other pre­ferred ligands of FGFR of the invention. Such cells may be useful when using the evaluation of activation of the downstream molecules mentioned above for selection of a candidate compound.<br>

Antibodies<br>
It an objective of the present invention to provide an antibody capable of selectively binding to an epitope comprising the binding site of the invention. Therefore, the invention relates to any antibody capable of selectively binding to an epitope com­prising<br>
1) any of the sequences set forth in SEQ ID NOS: 1-10, 100, 125, or frag­ments or variants, or homologues said sequences, or fragments or variants of said homologues, wherein<br>
i) a fragment is defined as an amino acid sequence having at least 40%, more preferably at least 50%, more preferably at least 60%, more preferably at least 70%, more preferably at least 80%, more preferably at least 90%, more preferably at least 95% of the length of a predetermined sequence set forth in SEQ ID NOS: 1-10,100,125, wherein an amino acid sequence homology between a fragment and the predetermined sequence is 100%, ii) a variant is defined as an amino acid sequence having at least 60 %, more preferably at least 70%, more preferably at least 80%, more preferably at least 90%, more preferably 95% homology to a sequence selected from SEQ ID NOS: 1-10, 100, 125 or an amino acid sequence having at least 60 %, more preferably at least 70%, more preferably at least 80%, more preferably at least 90%, more preferably 95% positive amino acid matches compared to a sequence selected from SEQ ID NOS: 1-10, 100, 125, wherein a positive<br>
amino acid match is defined as an identity or similarity defined by physical and/or chemical properties of the amino acids having the same position in two compared sequences. Preferred positive amino acid matches of the pre­sent invention are K to R, E to D, L to M, Q to E, I to V, I to L, A to S, Y to W, K to Q, S to T, N to S and Q to R. The homology of one amino acid se­quence with another amino acid is defined as a percentage of identical amino acids in the two collated sequences,<br>
iii) a homologue is defined as an amino acid sequence which has less then 60% and more then 19 %, such as 50-59%, for example 55%, such as 40-49%, for example 45%, such as 30-39%, for example 35%, such as 20-29%, for example 25% homology to any of the sequences set forth in SEQ ID NOS: 1-10, 100, 125 having remained some of the physical properties of the prede­termined sequences, such as for example the three-dimensional structure or some of the functional properties, such as for example a capability to interact with another molecule, particularly with a receptor molecule,<br>
iv) a variant of a homologue is defined as an amino acid sequence having at least 60 %, more preferably at least 70%, more preferably at least 80%, more preferably at least 90%, more preferably 95% positive amino acid matches compared to a homologue of any of the sequences selected from SEQ ID NO: 1-10, 100, 125 wherein the positive amino acid matches being as the defined above;<br>
and/or<br>
any of the sequences identified as SEQ ID NOS: 11-99, 101-124,126-146<br>
or fragments or variants, or homologues said sequences, or fragments or variants of<br>
said homologues, wherein said fragments or variants, or homologues said se­<br>
quences, or fragments or variants of said homologues being defined as the above,<br>
and/or<br>
a peptide fragment having structural characteristics, such as for example<br>
strand-loop-strand fold, similar to the structural characteristics of a peptide fragment<br>
corresponding to SEQ ID NO: 1, wherein the sequences homology between the<br>
aligned peptide fragments is at least 40% and/or the positive amino acid match is at<br>
least 50%.<br>
In one embodiment the antibody is capable to modulate the cell-surface receptor 'unction by decreasing or increasing the capability of a ligand to activate the<br>
receptor by modulating the binding of said ligand to said receptor. By "modulating binding" in the present context is meant a capability of an antibody to inclrease/decrease the affinity and/or strength of ligand-receptor interaction. In a more preferred embodiment the antibody is capable to bind to the described above epitope in a FGFR ligand and thereby to modulate activating of FGFR. By "modulate" in the present context is meant to promote or inhibit the activating of the receptor. Preferred embodiments for these FGFR ligands are described above.<br>
In another embodiment the antibody is capable to modulate the biological function of a cell-surface receptor ligand by interfering with the binding of said ligand to said receptor. This embodiment relates to those FGFR ligands that (i)        may be the receptor molecules independent from FGFR, and/or (ii)       may use an alternative receptor when the FGFR signaling is inhibited, and/or (iii)      may have additional biological functions that are not associated with any downstream signaling.<br>
Preferred embodiments for such ligands comprising the epitope of the invention are described above.<br>
Fragments of the polypeptides comprising the binding site of the invention can be used to raise antibodies useful in the invention. It is preferred to use for raising the above described antibodies the peptide fragments having the sequences set forth in SEQ ID NOS: 1-146, or fragments or variants, or homologues said sequences, or fragments or variants of said homologues. In general, the peptides can be coupled to a carrier protein, such as KLH, as described in Ausubel et al., supra, mixed with an adjuvant, and injected into a host mammal. Such polypeptides or peptide frag­ments can be produced by recombinant techniques as described the above or syn­thesized (see, for example, "Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis," supra; Ausubel et al., supra). Also the carrier could be PPD. Antibodies can be purified by peptide antigen affinity chromatography.<br>
Thus, the invention concerns a method for the production of antibodies comprising administering to an animal a peptide fragment comprising at least one sequence selected from the sequences set forth in SEQ ID NOS: 1-146.<br>
In particular, various host animals can be immunized by injection with the above peptide fragments. Host animals include rabbits, mice, guinea pigs, rats, and chick­ens. Various adjuvants that can be used to increase the immunological response depend on the host species and include Freund's adjuvant (complete and incom­plete), mineral gels such as aluminum hydroxide, surface active substances such as lysolecithin, pluronic polyols, polyanions, peptides, oil emulsions, keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and dinitrophenol. Potentially useful human adjuvants include BCG (bacille Calmette-Guerin) and Corynebacterium parvum. Immunizations may also be carried out by the injection of DNA encoding an FGFR-ligand or fragments thereof corresponding to the binding site. Polyclonal antibodies are heterogeneous popula­tions of antibody molecules that are contained in the sera of the immunized animals.<br>
Antibodies within the invention therefore include polyclonal antibodies and, in addi­tion, monoclonal antibodies, humanized or chimeric antibodies, single chain antibod­ies, Fab' fragments, F(ab')2 fragments, and molecules produced using a Fab ex­pression library, and antibodies or fragments produced by phage display techniques.<br>
Monoclonal antibodies, which are homogeneous populations of antibodies to a par­ticular antigen, can be prepared using the peptide fragments comprising the above described binding site and standard hybridoma technology (see, for example, Kohler et al., Nature 256:495, 1975; Kohler et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 6:511, 1976; Kohler et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 6:292, 1976; Hammerling et al., "Monoclonal Antibodies and T Cell Hybridomas," Elsevier, NY, 1981; Ausubel et al., supra).<br>
In particular, monoclonal antibodies can be obtained by any technique that provides for the production of antibody molecules by continuous cell lines in culture such as described in Kohler et al., Nature 256:495,1975, and U.S. Patent No. 4,376,110; the human B-cell hybridoma technique (Kosbor et al., Immunology Today 4:72, 1983; Cole et al., Proc. A/a//. Acad. Sci. USA 80:2026, 1983), and the EBV-hybridoma technique (Cole et al., "Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy," Alan R. Liss, Inc., pp. 77-96, 1983). Such antibodies can be of any immunoglobulin class includ­ing IgG, IgM, IgE, IgA, IgD and any subclass thereof. (In the case of chckens, the immunoglobulin class can also be IgY.) The hybridoma producing the mAb of this invention may be cultivated in vitro or in vivo. The ability to produce high titers of mAbs in vivo makes this the presently preferred method of production, but in some<br>
cases, in vitro production will be preferred to avoid introducing cancer cells into live animals, for example, in cases where the presence of normal immunoglobulins com­ing from the acitis fluids are unwanted, or in cases involving ethical considerations.<br>
Once produced, polyclonal, monoclonal, or phage-derived antibodies are tested for specific recognition of the above described epitope by Western blot or irnmuno-precipitation in samples containing the polypeptides comprising the binding site or fragments thereof, e.g., as described in Ausubel et al., supra. Antibodies that spe­cifically recognise and bind to a FGFR ligand are useful in the invention. For exam­ple, such antibodies can be used in an immunoassay to monitor the level of expres­sion a FGFR ligand in a sample collected from an individual.<br>
In some cases it may be desirable to minimize the potential problems of low affinity or specificity of antisera. In such circumstances, two or three fusions can be gener­ated for each protein, and each fusion can be injected into at least two animals. Antisera can be raised by injections in a series, preferably including at least three booster injections. Spleen cells from the immunised animals may be used for gener­ating monoclonal antibodies.<br>
An antibody capable of binding to an epitope as defined above may be used for de­termining a substance comprising an epitope comprising at least one of the se­quences set forth in SEQ ID NOS: 1-146, or fragments, or variants, or homologues of said sequences, or fragments or variants of said homologues in a sample. The sample may be any sample comprising the substance, for example a solution of the substance or a biological sample. The substance comprising an epitope may be of natural or synthetic origin. The examples of such a substance include, but not lim­ited a cell comprising a compound comprising an epitope, a compound comprising an epitope, a compound consisting of an epitope. The cell comprising a compound comprising an epitope may be for example a cell expressing a ligand of a cell sur­face receptor of the invention. Examples of such ligands are described above. The compound comprising the epitope may be any compound described above.<br>
The above antibodies may for example be used in the detection of an FGFR ligand in a biological sample. The antibody may also be used in a screening assay for measuring the activity of FGFR, for example as a part of a diagnostic assay. De-<br>
pending on the detection technique the antibody may be coupled to a compound comprising a detectable marker. The markers or labels may be selected from any markers and labels known in the art. The antibody may also be used for determin­ing the concentration of a substance comprising an epitope or epitope in a solution of said substance or said epitope. A wide spectrum of detection and labelling tech­niques is available now in the art and the techniques may therefore be selected de­pending on skills of the artisan practising the antibodies or on the purpose of using thereof.<br>
In addition, techniques developed for the production of "chimeric antibodies" (Morri­son et al., Proc. Nail. Acad. Sci. USA, 81:6851, 1984; Neuberger et al., Nature, 312:604, 1984; Takeda et al., Nature, 314:452, 1984) by splicing the genes from a mouse antibody molecule of appropriate antigen specificity together with genes from a human antibody molecule of appropriate biological activity can be used. A chi­meric antibody is a molecule in which different portions are derived from different animal species, such as those having a variable region derived from a murine mAb and a human immunoglobulin constant region.<br>
Alternatively, techniques described for the production of single chain antibodies (U.S. Patent Nos. 4,946,778, 4,946,778, and 4,704,692) can be adapted to produce single chain antibodies against an FGFR-ligand or a fragment thereof. Single chain antibodies are formed by linking the heavy and light chain fragments of the Fv re­gion via an amino acid bridge, resulting in a single chain polypeptide.<br>
Antibody fragments that recognise and bind to specific epitopes can be generated by known techniques. For example, such fragments include but are not limited to F(ab')2 fragments that can be produced by pepsin digestion of the antibody mole­cule, and Fab' fragments that can be generated by reducing the disulfide bridges of F(ab')2 fragments. Alternatively, Fab1 expression libraries can be constructed (Huse et al., Science, 246:1275,1989) to allow rapid and easy identification of monoclonal Fab' fragments with the desired specificity.<br>
Antibodies can be humanized by methods known in the art. For example, monoclonal antibodies with a desired binding specificity can be commercially humanized (Scotgene, Scotland; Oxford Molecular, Palo Alto, CA). Fully human<br>
antibodies, such as those expressed in transgenic animals are also features of the invention (Green et al., Nature Genetics 7:13-21, 1994; see also U.S. Patents 5,545,806 and 5,569,825, both of which are hereby incorporated by reference).<br>
Production of polypeptides and peptide fragments<br>
Polypeptides and peptide fragments of the invention can be provided by any suitable conventional method known in the art. The peptide fragments and polypeptides of the invention can be for example chemically synthesized (for example, see Creigh-ton, "Proteins: Structures and Molecular Principles," W.H. Freeman &amp; Co., NY, 1983), or, perhaps more advantageously, produced by recombinant DNA technology as described herein. For additional guidance, skilled artisans may consult Ausubel et al. (supra), Sambrook et al. ("Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual," Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, 1989), and, particularly for examples of chemical synthesis Gait, M.J. Ed. ("Oligonucleotide Synthesis," IRL Press, Ox­ford, 1984).<br>
Recombinant molecules<br>
The methods and the assay described above all include a step of providing at least two interacting proteins.<br>
The two interacting proteins of the methods and the assay of the invention are pref­erably recombinant proteins. Therefore, the invention in additional embodiment en­compasses expression vectors that contain the coding DNA sequences for the in­teracting proteins and genetically engineered host cells that contain any of the fore­going expression vectors and thereby express the nucleic acid molecules of the in­vention in the host cell.<br>
Preferred embodiments for the expression vectors are: (a) expression vectors that contain any of the foregoing FGFRs, including FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3 and FGFR4, or FGFR-ligand related coding sequences, said FGFR-ligand being selected from the preferred polypeptides of the invention described above, and/or their comple­ments (that is, "antisense" sequence); (b) expression vectors that contain any of the foregoing FGFRs or FGFR-ligand related coding sequences comprising the above<br>
mutation operatively associated with a regulatory element (examples of which are given below) that directs the expression of the coding sequences; (c) expression vectors containing, in addition to sequences encoding mutated FGFRs or FGFR-ligands, nucleic acid sequences that are unrelated to nucleic acid sequences encod­ing the FGFRs or FGFR-ligands, such as molecules encoding a reporter or marker.<br>
Recombinant nucleic acid molecule may contain a sequence encoding mutated FGFRs or FGFR-ligands, soluble FGFRs or FGFR-ligands, truncated FGFRs or FGFR-ligands, or functional domains of FGFRs, such as for example Ig 2 or Ig 3 domain of FGFR1, or the domains of a FGFR ligand, such as for example the do­mains of NCAM, for example the Ig-like or F3 type domains. The full-length mutated polypeptides, domains of FGFRs or FGFR-ligands, or fragments thereof may be fused to additional polypeptides, as described below.<br>
The regulatory elements referred to above include, but are not limited to, inducible and non-inducible promoters, enhancers, operators and other elements, which are known to those skilled in the art, and which drive or otherwise regulate gene expres­sion. Such regulatory elements include but are not limited to the cytomegalovirus hCMV immediate early gene, the early or late promoters of SV40 adenovirus, the lac system, the trg system, the TAG system, the TRC system, the major operator and promoter regions of phage A, the control regions of fd coat protein, the promoter for 3-phosphoglycerate kinase, the promoters of acid phosphatase, and the promoters of the yeast - mating factors.<br>
Similarly, the nucleic acid can form part of a hybrid gene encoding additional poly-peptide sequences, for example, sequences that function as a marker or reporter. Examples of marker or reporter genes include -lactamase, chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase (CAT), adenosine deaminase (ADA), aminoglycoside phosphotrans-ferase (neor, G4181), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), hygromycin-B-phosphotrans-ferase (HPH), thymidine kinase (TK), lacZ (encoding -galactosidase), green fluores­cent protein (GFP), and xanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (XGPRT). As with many of the standard procedures associated with the practice of the invention, skilled artisans will be aware of additional useful reagents, for example, of additional sequences that can serve the function of a marker or reporter. Generally, the hybrid polypeptide will include a first portion and a second portion; the first portion being,<br>
for example, a portion of the FGFR1 or NCAM amino acid sequence and the second portion being, for example, the reporter described above or an immunoglobulin heavy chain.<br>
The expression systems that may be used for purposes of the invention include, but are not limited to, microorganisms such as bacteria (for example, E. coll and B. sub-tills) transformed with recombinant bacteriophage DNA, plasmid DNA, or cosmid DNA expression vectors containing the nucleic acid molecules of the invention; yeast (for example, Saccharomyces and Pichia) transformed with recombinant yeast expression vectors containing the nucleic acid molecules encoding FGFR1 or the nucleic acid sequence encoding NCAM ; insect cell systems infected with recombi­nant virus expression vectors (for example, baculovirus) containing the nucleic acid molecules of the invention; plant cell systems infected with recombinant virus ex­pression vectors (for example, cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) and tobacco mosaic virus (TMV)) or transformed with recombinant plasmid expression vectors (for ex­ample, Ti plasmid) containing FGFR nucleotide sequences; or mammalian cell sys­tems (for example, COS, CHO, BHK, 293, VERO, HeLa, MDCK, WI38, and NIH 3T3 cells) harbouring recombinant expression constructs containing promoters derived from the genome of mammalian cells (for example, the metallothionein promoter) or from mammalian viruses (for example, the adenovirus late promoter and the vac­cinia virus 7.5K promoter).<br>
In bacterial systems, a number of expression vectors may be advantageously se­lected depending upon the use intended for the gene product being expressed. Such vectors include, but are not limited to, the E. coli expression vector pUR278 (Ruther et al., EMBO J. 2:1791, 1983), in which the coding sequence of the insert may be ligated individually into the vector in frame with the lacZ coding region so that a fusion protein is produced; pIN vectors (Inouye and Inouye, Nucleic Acids Res. 13:3101-3109, 1985; Van Heeke and Schuster, J. Biol. Chem. 264:5503-5509, 1989); and the like. pGEX vectors may also be used to express foreign polypep-tides as fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase (GST). In general, such fu­sion proteins are soluble and can easily be purified from lysed cells by adsorption to glutathione-agarose beads followed by elution in the presence of free glutathione. The pGEX vectors are designed to include thrombin or factor Xa protease cleavage sites so that the cloned target gene product can be released from the GST moiety.<br>
In an insect system, Autographs califomica nuclear polyhidrosis virus (AcNPV) can be used as a vector to express foreign genes. The virus grows in Spodoptera fru-giperda cells. The coding sequence of the insert may be cloned individually into non-essential regions (for example the polyhedrin gene) of the virus and placed un­der control of an AcNPV promoter (for example the polyhedrin promoter). Success­ful insertion of the coding sequence will result in inactivation of the polyhedrin gene and production of non-occluded recombinant virus (i.e., virus lacking the proteina-ceous coat coded for by the polyhedrin gene). These recombinant viruses are then used to infect Spodoptera frugiperda cells in which the inserted gene is expressed, (for example, see Smith et al., J. Virol. 46:584, 1983; Smith, U.S. Patent No. 4,215,051).<br>
In mammalian host cells, a number of viral-based expression systems may be util­ized.   In cases where an adenovirus is used as an expression vector, the nucleic acid molecule of the invention may be ligated to an adenovirus transcrip­tion/translation control complex, for example, the late promoter and tripartite leader sequence. This chimeric gene may then be inserted in the adenovirus genome by in vitro or in vivo recombination.   Insertion in a non- essential region of the viral ge­nome (for example, region E1 or E3) will result in a recombinant virus that is viable and capable of expressing a FGFR gene product in infected hosts (for example, see Logan and Shenk, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:3655-3659, 1984). Specific initia­tion signals may also be required for efficient translation of inserted nucleic acid molecules. These signals include the ATG initiation codon and adjacent sequences. In cases where an entire gene or cDNA, including its own initiation codon and adja­cent sequences, is inserted into the appropriate expression vector, no additional translational control signals may be needed. However, in cases where only a por­tion of the coding sequence is inserted, exogenous translational control signals, in­cluding, perhaps, the ATG initiation codon, must be provided. .Furthermore, the ini­tiation codon must be in phase with the reading frame of the desired coding se­quence to ensure translation of the entire insert.   These exogenous translational control signals and initiation codons can be of a variety of origins, both natural and synthetic. The efficiency of expression may be enhanced by the inclusion of appro­priate transcription enhancer elements, transcription terminators, etc. (see Bittner et al., Methods in Enzymol. 153:516- 544,1987).<br>
In addition, a host cell strain may be chosen, which modulates the expression of the inserted sequences, or modifies and processes the gene product in the specific fashion desired. Such modifications (for example, glycosylation) and processing (for example, cleavage) of protein products may be important for the function of the pro­tein. Different host cells have characteristic and specific mechanisms for the post-translational processing and modification of proteins and gene products. Appropri­ate cell lines or host systems can be chosen to ensure the correct modification and processing of the foreign protein expressed. To this end, eukaryotic host cells which possess the cellular machinery for proper processing of the primary transcript, gly­cosylation, and phosphorylation of the gene product may be used. The mammalian cell types listed above are among those that could serve as suitable host cells.<br>
For long-term, high-yield production of recombinant proteins, stable expression is preferred. For example, cell lines, which stably express the FGFR sequences or any FGFR ligand sequences described above may be engineered. Rather than using expression vectors which contain viral origins of replication, host cells can be transformed with DNA controlled by appropriate expression control elements (for example, promoter, enhancer sequences, transcription terminators, polyadenylation sites, etc.), and a selectable marker. Following the introduction of the foreign DNA, engineered cells may be allowed to grow for 1-2 days in an enriched media, and then switched to a selective media. The selectable marker in the recombinant plasmid confers resistance to the selection and allows cells to stably integrate the plasmid into their chromosomes and grow to form foci which in turn can be cloned and expanded into cell lines. Such engineered cell lines may be particularly useful in the screening assay and evaluation of candidatecompounds that affect the interac­tion between FGFR and an FGFR ligand.<br>
A number of selection systems can be used. For example, the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (Wigler, et al., Cell 11:223, 1977), hypoxanthine- guanine phos-phoribosyltransferase (Szybalska and Szybalski, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 48:2026, 1962), and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (Lowy, et al., Cell 22:817, 1980) genes can be employed in tk", hgprf or aprf cells, respectively. Also, anti-metabolite resistance can be used as the basis of selection for the following genes: dhfr, which confers resistance to methotrexate (Wigler et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.<br>
USA 77:3567, 1980; O'Hare et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 78:1527, 1981); gpt, which confers resistance to mycophenolic acid (Mulligan and Berg, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 78:2072, 1981); neo, which confers resistance to the aminoglycoside G-418 (Colberre-Garapin et al., J. Mol. Biol. 150:1, 1981); and hygro, which confers resistance to hygromycin (Santerre et al., Gene 30:147, 1984).<br>
Alternatively, any fusion protein may be readily purified by utilizing an antibody specific for the fusion protein being expressed. For example, a system described by Janknecht et al. allows for the ready purification of non-denatured fusion proteins expressed in human cell lines (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88: 8972-8976, 1991). In this system, the gene of interest is subcloned into a vaccinia recombination plasmid such that the gene's open reading frame is translationally fused to an amino-terminal tag consisting of six histidine residues. Extracts from cells infected with recombinant vaccinia virus are loaded onto Ni2+.nitriloacetic acid-agarose columns and histidine-tagged proteins are selectively eluted with imidazole-containing buffers.<br>
ft is presumed that molecules of one group of the recombinant proteins of the inven­tion comprise the described above binding site, and molecules of another group of the recombinant proteins comprise a site for recognition of said binding site.<br>
Medicament<br>
Activation of cell-surface receptors upon the ligand binding is strictly regulated in a healthy organism. Mutations, abnormal expression or processing of a receptor or the receptor ligands lead to abnormalities in activity of the receptor and therefore lead to dysfunction of the receptor. The dysfunction of the receptor is in turn a reason for dysfunction of the cells which use the receptor for maintenance of various cellular processes. The latter is a manifestation of a disease. FGFRs are expressed by a wide variety of cell species during embryonic development and in the adult. Dys­function of these receptors has been associated with a number of diseases.<br>
Accordingly, it is an objective of the invention to provide a compound capable of modulation of the activity of FGFRs, said compound being concerned by the inven­tion as a medicament for the treatment of diseases, wherein modulation of the activ­ity of FGFRs may be considered as an essential condition for the curing.<br>
Thus, the medicament of the invention is in one embodiment for the treatment of<br>
normal, degenerated or damaged NCAM presenting cells, and/or<br>
diseases and conditions of the central and peripheral nervous system, or of the<br>
muscles or of various organs, and/or<br>

disorders affecting the circadian clock or neuro-muscular transmission, and<br>
schizophrenia, mood disorders, such as manic depression; for treatment of dis­<br>
eases or conditions of the muscles including conditions with impaired function of<br>
neuro-muscular connections, such as after organ transplantation, or such as ge­<br>

ditions of various organs, such as degenerative conditions of the gonads, of the<br>
pancreas such as diabetes mellitus type I and II, of the kidney such as nephrosis<br>
and of the heart, liver and bowel, and/or<br>

giogenesis.<br>
In another embodiment the medicament of the invention is for the manufacture of a medicament for<br>
promotion of wound-healing, and/or<br>
prevention of cell death of heart muscle cells, such as after acute myocardial<br>
infarction, or after angiogenesis, and/or<br>
revascularsation, and/or<br>
stimulation of the ability to learn and/or of the short and/or long-term memory.<br>
In one embodiment the medicament of the invention comprises at least one the amino acid sequences set forth in SEQ ID NOS: 2-146, or fragments or variants, or homologues said sequences, or fragments or variants of said homologues. In another embodiment the medicament of the invention comprises an antibody capable of binding to an epitope comprising the binding site of the invention, or a fragment, or a variant of said antibody.<br>
The medicament of the invention comprises an effective amount of one or more of the compounds as defined above, or a composition as defined above in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable additives. Such medicament may suitably be for­mulated for oral, percutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intracranial, intrathecal, intracerebroventricular, intranasal or pulmonal administration.<br>
Strategies in formulation development of medicaments and compositions based on the compounds of the present invention generally correspond to formulation strate­gies for any other protein-based drug product. Potential problems and the guidance required to overcome these problems are dealt with in several textbooks, e.g. "Therapeutic Peptides and Protein Formulation. Processing and Delivery Systems", Ed. A.K. Banga, Technomic Publishing AG, Basel, 1995.<br>
Injectables are usually prepared either as liquid solutions or suspensions, solid forms suitable for solution in, or suspension in, liquid prior to injection. The prepara­tion may also be emulsified. The active ingredient is often mixed with excipients which are pharmaceutically acceptable and compatible with the active ingredient. Suitable excipients are, for example, water, saline, dextrose, glycerol, ethanol or the like, and combinations thereof. In addition, if desired, the preparation may contain minor amounts of auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering agents, or which enhance the effectiveness or transportation of the prepa­ration.<br>
Formulations of the compounds of the invention can be prepared by techniques known to the person skilled in the art. The formulations may contain pharmaceuti­cally acceptable carriers and excipients including microspheres, liposomes, micro-capsules, nanoparticles or the like.<br>
The preparation may suitably be administered by injection, optionally at the site, where the active ingredient is to exert its effect. Additional formulations which are suitable for other modes of administration include suppositories, nasal, pulmonal and, in some cases, oral formulations. For suppositories, traditional binders and earners include polyalkylene glycols or triglycerides. Such suppositories may be formed from mixtures containing the active ingredient(s) in the range of from 0.5% to 10%, preferably 1-2%. Oral formulations include such normally employed excipients as, for example, pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharine, cellulose, magnesium carbonate, and the like. These compositions take the form of solutions, suspensions, tablets, pills, capsules, sus­tained release formulations or powders and generally contain 10-95% of the active ingredient(s), preferably 25-70%.<br>
Other formulations are such suitable for nasal and pulmonal administration, e.g. inhalators and aerosols.<br>
The active compound may be formulated as neutral or salt forms. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include acid addition salts (formed with the free amino groups of the peptide compound) and which are formed with inorganic acids such as, for ex­ample, hydrochloric or phosphoric acids, or such organic acids as acetic acid, oxalic acid, tartaric acid, rnandelic acid, and the like. Salts formed with the free carboxyl group may also be derived from inorganic bases such as, for example, sodium, po­tassium, ammonium, calcium, or ferric hydroxides, and such organic bases as iso-propylamine, trimethylamine, 2-ethylamino ethanol, histidine, procaine, and the like.<br>
The preparations are administered in a manner compatible with the dosage formula­tion, and in such amount as will be therapeutically effective. The quantity to be ad­ministered depends on the subject to be treated, including, e.g. the weight and age of the subject, the disease to be treated and the stage of disease. Suitable dosage ranges are per kilo body weight normally of the order of several hundred ug active ingredient per administration with a preferred range of from about 0.1 ug to 5000 ug per kilo body weight. Using monomeric forms of the compounds, the suitable dos­ages are often in the range of from 0.1 ug to 5000 ug per kilo body weight, such as in the range of from about 0.1 ug to 3000 ug per kilo body weight, and especially in the range of from about 0.1 ug to 1000 ug per kilo body weight. Using multimeric<br>
forms of the compounds, the suitable dosages are often in the range of from 0.1 ug to 1000 ug per kiio body weight, such as in the range of from about 0.1 ug to 750 ug per kilo body weight, and especially in the range of from about 0.1 ug to 500 ug per kilo body weight such as in the range of from about 0.1 ug to 250 ug per kilo body weight. In particular when administering nasally smaller dosages are used than when administering by other routes. Administration may be performed once or may be followed by subsequent administrations. The dosage will also depend on the route of administration and will vary with the age and weight of the subject to be treated. A preferred dosage of multimeric forms would be in the interval 1 mg to 70 mg per 70 kg body weight.<br>
For most indications a localised or substantially localised application is preferred.<br>
Some of the compounds of the present invention are sufficiently active, but for some of the others, the effect will be enhanced if the preparation further comprises phar-maceutically acceptable additives and/or carriers. Such additives and carriers will be known in the art. In some cases, it will be advantageous to include a compound, which promote delivery of the active substance to its target.<br>
In many instances, it will be necessary to administrate the'formulation multiple times. Administration may be a continuous infusion, such as intraventricular infusion or administration in more doses such as more times a day, daily, more times a week, weekly, etc. It is preferred that administration of the medicament is initiated before or shortly after the individual has been subjected to the factor(s) that may lead to cell death. Preferably the medicament is administered within 8 hours from the factor onset, such as within 5 hours from the factor onset. Many of the com­pounds exhibit a long term effect whereby administration of the compounds may be conducted with long intervals, such as 1 week or 2 weeks.<br>
n connection with the use in nerve guides, the administration may be continuous or n small portions based upon controlled release of the active compound(s). Further-nore, precursors may be used to control the rate of release and/or site of release. )ther kinds of implants and well as oral administration may similarly be based upon ontrolled release and/or the use of precursors.<br>

In relation to chemotherapy the FGFR binding compounds according to the invention are useful in cancer treatment of all cancer cells presenting FGFRs.<br>
Thus, the treatment comprises treatment and/or prophylaxis of cell death in relation to diseases or conditions of the central and peripheral nervous system, such as postoperative nerve damage, traumatic nerve damage, e.g. resulting from spinal cord injury, impaired myelination of nerve fibers, postischaemic damage, e.g. result­ing from a stroke, multiinfarct dementia, multiple sclerosis, nerve degeneration as­sociated with diabetes mellitus, neuro-muscular degeneration, schizophrenia, Alz­heimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, or Huntington's disease.<br>

The invention further discloses the use of the compound and/or pharmaceutical composition in the treatment of cancer. Regulation of activation of FGFR is important for tumor agiogenesis, proliferation and spreading.<br>
In yet a further embodiment the use of the compound and/or pharmaceutical com­position is for the stimulation of the ability to learn and/or of the short and/or long term memory, as FGFR activity is important for differentiation of neural cells.<br>

Examples<br>
Production of recombinant proteins<br>
The NCAM F3 modules 1, 2 (without expression of exons a, AAG), and FGFR1 Ig modules 2, 3 were produced using rat NCAM cDNA and mouse FGFR1 (IIIC iso-form) cDNA. The F3 module 1 and the combined F3 modules 1, 2 consist of AGHHHHHH and amino acids 507-611 and 507-705 of NCAM (swissprot p13596), respectively. The F3 module 2 consists of AG and amino acids 612-705 of NCAM (swissprot p13596), and is sequentially numbered from 1 to 96, A being numbered 1. The FGFR Ig module 2 consists of AGHHHHHH and amino acids 140-251 of FGFR (swissprot p16092). The FGFR Ig module 3 and the combined Ig modules 2, 3 consist of RSHHHHHH and amino acids 249-365 and 141-365 of FGFR (swissprot<br>
p16092), respectively. The F3 modules and the FGFR Ig module 2 were expressed in a KM71 strain of yeast P. pastoris (Invitrogen, USA) as described (Thomsen et al., 1996). The FGFR Ig module 3 and modules 2, 3 were expressed in Drosophila S2 cells (Invitrogen, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All the pro­teins were purified by affinity chromatography using Ni2+-NTA resin (Qiagen, USA) and/or ion exchange chromatography and gel filtration. 15N-labelled F3 module 2 was produced as described (Thomsen et al., 1996). The NCAM Ig modules 1, 2 and 3 (RV and amino acids 20-308 of rat NCAM, swissprot p13596) was produced as described (Soroka et. al., 2002).<br>
NMR analysis: the structure calculations of the NCAM F3 module 2 and Identi­fication of the residues involved in binding with FGFR and ATP<br>
The following samples were used for the structure determination of the NCAM F3 module 2: 2 mM module in H20 or D20 and 1 mM 15N-labelled module in H2O. The buffer was 30 mM NaCI, 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.27. The following NMR spectra were recorded and used for assignment: TOCSY in H2O or D20 (45 and 70 ms mixing time), NOESY in H2O or D2O (80 and 200 ms mixing time), DQFCOSY, 15N-HSQC, 15N-TOCSY-HSQC (70 ms mixing time), and 15N-NOESY-HSQC (125 ms mixing time) (Bodenhausen and Ruben, 1980; Braunsweiler and Ernst, 1983; Kumar et al., 1981; Piantini et al., 1982; Zhang et al., 1994). The NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker AMX-600 MHz and Varian Unity Inova 500, 750 and 800 MHz spectrometers. All spectra were recorded at 298 K. The as­signment of the 1H and 15N resonances were performed. using the program PRONTO (KJasretal., 1994).<br>
Structure calculation<br>
A distance geometry/simulated annealing protocol using the X-PLOR program was used for structure calculation. The NOE restraints were derived from 80/200 ms NOESY and 125ms 15N-NOESY-HSQC spectra with upper bounds of 2.7, 3.3 and 6.0 A increased by 0.5 A if the restraint included a methyl group. 40 <j> angles re­straints with bounds of-120±40° and -57±40° (derived from the 3JHNHo coupling con­stants) and 4 %1 angles were applied. After inspection of hydrogen bond energies, 80 hydrogen bond restraints were applied as NOE restraints with upper bounds of 2 A and 3 A for the NH-O and N-0 distances, respectively. Of 96 structures calcu­lated, 96 were accepted by X-PLOR, discriminating any structure with an NOE re-<br>
straint violation &gt;0.5A or an angle violation &gt;5°. The structures were examined with MOLMOL, PROCHECKJsIMR and WHATCHECK programs. 78 structures had the absolute values of the Z-scores for the 2nd generation packing quality, the Ramachandran plot, the xi/Xa plot and the backbone conformation less than 3.0. From these 78 structures, 30 structures with the absolute values of the Z-scores less than 2.4 were chosen to represent the structure of the F3 module 2.<br>
Determination of the structure of the NCAM F3 module 2 by NMR An overlay of 30 superimposed structures for the backbone atoms is shown in Fig. 1A (accession number 1LWR, Protein Data Bank). A ribbon representation of the structure labeling the 7 B-strands is shown in Fig. 1B. A summary of the structural statistics is given in Table 1.<br>
The structure consists of 7 antiparallel B-strands arranged in a sandwich of two 6 sheets, one containing three strands (ABE) and the other four strands (GFCD). Both of the B sheets have a right-handed twist. The triple-stranded B sheet consists of residues K7 - G13 (A), S18 -I24 (B), H59 - S63 (E), and the four-stranded B sheet con­sists of residues I33 - A42 (C), I51, A52 (D), E70 - N79 (F) and G82 - R92 (G). There are two wide type B-bulges (Chan et a/., 1993) involving residues K85, A86 and V76 (G and F B-stands), and residues A77 and H35, Y36 (F and C B-strands). The two B-bulges contribute to the right-handed twist conformation of the four-stranded B-sheet. Analysis of the characteristic p-sheet inter-strand NOEs shows unambigu­ously that this module has the fibronectin type III fold.<br>
Identification of the residues of the NCAM F3 module 2 interacting with FGFR and ATP<br>
In the 15N-HSQC spectrum of an 15N-labeled protein, a signal for each amino acid with both a nitrogen and proton can be observed. The changes in the chemical shifts of the signals provide a method for the identification of residues in a protein that are perturbed by the binding of another molecule. To a 50 uM 15N-labeled sample of the NCAM F3 module 2, 1 mM unlabeled FGFR Ig modules 2 or 3, or 5 mM AMP-PCP (a non-hydrolysable analogue of ATP) were added. No significant changes of the chemical shifts were found in the presence of the Ig module 2 (data not shown). The recorded changes of the chemical shifts in the presence of the Ig module 3 or AMP-PCP are shown in Fig. 1C,D. The residues of the F3 module that exhibited perturba-<br>
tion by the Ig module 3 were N79, Q81, G82 and K83 (Fig. 1C). The changes of the chemical shifts of these residues demonstrate that the presence of the Ig module 3 close to the F3 module 2 alters the chemical environment at the perturbed residues of the F3 module, indicating that the perturbed residues are either a part or in the vicinity of the binding site for the interaction between the two modules. These resi­dues are located in the turn region between the F and G J3-strands, and as can be seen from Fig. 2E, they are close to the N-terminus of the module and, thus, close to the C-terminus of the F3 module 1 in the NCAM molecule. Since the recombinant protein consisting of the combined F3 modules 1, 2 was found to bind to FGFR with a much higher affinity than any of the two individual F3 modules, it is possible that the perturbed residues at the N-terminus of the F3 module 2 together with residues at the C-terminus of the F3 module 1 form a single binding site which is destroyed when the F3 modules are separated, thus greatly reducing their affinity to FGFR compared to the double module protein.<br>
The residues of the F3 module perturbed by AMP-PCP were Y74 and V75. The side chain of Y74 is exposed on the surface of the module and located in the close vicinity of the nucleotide binding motif: A77ENQQGKS84 and K85 (Fig. 1E). Both K83 and K85 are exposed on the surface of the module, and presumably the positively charged side chains of K83 and K85 interact with the negatively charged triphosphate moiety of ATP, whereas the side chain of Y74 is involved in a hydrophobic interaction with the adehosine moiety of ATP. A possible arrangement of the complex of ATP and the F3 module 2 is depicted in Fig. 1G. The residues perturbed by the FGFR Ig module 3 (N78, Q81, G82 and K83) are also a part of the nucleotide binding motif, indi­cating that the ATP binding site and the FGFR binding site are overlapping.<br>
Thus, these data indicate that N78, Q81, G82 and K83 of the NCAM F3 module 2 are located in a site binding to FGFR, and that the FGFR binding site overlaps the ATP binding site.<br>
SPR Analysis of interaction between FGFR and NCAM<br>
Binding analysis was performed using a BIAcoreX instrument (Biosensor AB) at 25 °C using 10 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCI as running buffer. The flow-rate was 5 jjJ/min. Data were analysed by non-linear curve-fitting using the manufacture's software. The FGFR Ig modules 2, 3 were immobilized on a sensor<br>
chip CMS using amine coupling kit (Biosensor AB) as follows: 1) the two halves of the chip (designated Fc1 and Fc2) were activated by 20 pi activation solution; 2) the protein was immobilized on Fc1 using 12 pi 20 fig/ml protein in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 6.0; 3) Fc1 and Fc2 were blocked by 35 pi blocking solution. Binding of various compounds to the immobilized FGFR modules was studied as follows: A compound was injected simultaneously into Fc1 (with the immobilized FGFR modules) and Fc2 (with nothing immobilized). The curve representing unspe-cific binding of the compound to the surface of Fc2 was subtracted from the curve representing binding of the protein to the immobilized FGFR modules and the sur­face of Fcl The resulting curve was used for analysis. For ATP competition experi­ments, the specified compounds were preincubated for 10 min with ATP at a speci­fied concentration. The Ki of ATP for the interaction between the NCAM F3 modules 1, 2 and the FGFR modules 2, 3 was estimated as previously described (Kiselyov et al, 1997): The initial binding rates of 30 uM F3 modules, V0, and 30 uM F3 modules preincubated with ATP at a specified concentration, vatp, were determined. The % inhibition, l%, was calculated using the formula: lo/0=(1-VATpA/o)x100. l% was plotted against ATP concentration and Ki was calculated by non-linear fitting of the theoreti­cal curve to the experimental data.<br>
Demonstration of a direct interaction between NCAM and FGFR From Fig. 2 it appears that a protein consisting of the NCAM F3 modules 1, 2 binds to an immobilized protein comprising the FGFR modules 2, 3, whereas a control protein consisting of the NCAM Ig modules 1, 2 and 3 does not bind to the FGFR fragment. The dissociation constant (Kd) and the coefficients of association and dissociation were: 9.97±0,37 uM, 889+332 M'V1 and 5.56±0.07 x 10~3 s"1 (mean ± standard deviation), respectively.<br>
Thus, these data show that the NCAM F3 modules bind directly to FGFR<br>
Binding of NCAM to FGFR can be inhibited by ATP<br>
As the NCAM sites binding to FGFR and ATP overlap, then ATP might be expected to interfere with the NCAM-FGFR binding. To test this assumption, SPR analysis was used. As can be seen from Fig. 3A, adding 10 mM ATP to 30 uM NCAM F3 modules 1, 2 completely inhibited binding of the F3 modules to the FGFR Ig mod­ules 2, 3. To determine the inhibition constant (Ki), the inhibition effect was meas-<br>
ured at various ATP concentrations (Fig. 3B). The calculated Ki was 0.37 ± 0.05 mM. Since the NMR experiments indicate that the turn region between the F and G P-strands of the F3 module 2 is involved in binding to FGFR, it was of interest to test if a peptide fragment spanning these residues could bind to FGFR. Moreover, an­other peptide fragment located in the F3 module 1 was of interest to test, as the turn region between the E and F strands of this module may constitute an N-terminal part of the binding site in NCAM interacting with the Ig2-lg3 module of FGFR. For this purpose, a peptide corresponding to residues E72 - A86 of the F3 module 2 (SEQ ID NO: 1) (termed the FG loop peptide) and a peptide corresponding to residues T573-R586 of the F3 module 1   (SEQ ID NO: 9) (termed the EF loop peptide). However, binding of monomeric forms of these peptides cannot be detected by SPR. There­fore, there were synthesized dendrimeric versions of the peptides in which four pep­tide sequences of one type (such as SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 9) were con­nected to a three-lysine backbone through their C-termini. This made it possible for the peptide to bind to several molecules of FGFR simultaneously, thus greatly in­creasing the apparent affinity of the peptides, and, at the same time, increasing the sensitivity of the SPR analysis four fold (since the molecular weight of each peptide was increased four times).<br>
As appears from Fig. 3C, the dendrimeric FG loop peptide binds to FGFR with an apparent Kd of 2.58 ± 2,06 uM (the coefficients of association and dissociation be­ing 2.07 + 1.08 x 103 M"V1 and 3.97 ± 2.29 x 10~3 s"1, respectively). Since binding of the F3 modules 1, 2 to FGFR could be inhibited by ATP and since the peptide con­tains the entire nucleotide binding motif of NCAM, It was also tested if ATP could interfere with binding of the peptide to FGFR. Indeed, adding 10 mM ATP to 34 uM peptide inhibited the binding by approx. 70% (Fig. 3C). Fig.-4 demonstrates the real-time binding of the dendromeric form of the EF loop peptide to FGFR,<br>
These experiments demonstrate that NCAM binding to FGFR can be inhibited by ATP and support the notion that the turn regions between the F and G p-strands of the F3 module 2 and the E and F p-strands of the F3 module 1 are involved in bind­ing to FGFR, and that NCAM sites for FGFR and ATP overlap.<br>
Assays for determination of FGFR1 phosphorylation and NCAM Immunopre-cipitation<br>
Activation of FGFR by the NCAM F3 module 2 and the FG loop peptide<br>
Since the NCAM F3 module 2 and the dendrimeric FG loop peptide bind to FGFR, they may be also expected to induce FGFR activation in living cells. To test this as­sumption, two assays have been used.<br>
Assay 1: TREX-293 cells (Invitrogen) were stably transfected with  human FGFR1 having a C-terminal Strepll-tag (IBA biotech), using the Flp-ln system (Invitrogen). For the study of phosphorylation: -2x107 cells were starved overnight before stimu­lation for 20 min with the specified compounds. Cells were lysed in PBS with 1 % NP-40 and phosphatase inhibitors cocktail set II (Calbiochem). The cleared cell lys-ates were incubated with 50 ul agarose-coupled anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (4G10-AC, Upstate Biotechnologies) for 3 hrs at 4°C. Care was taken to calibrate the amount of cells employed, so that considerable increases in phosphorylated FGFR could be detected. The bound protein was washed, eluted using 150 mM phenyl phosphate (Sigma), precipitated by 12% trichloroacetic acid, washed in cold acetone and dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Immunoblotting was performed using antibodies against the recombinant Strepll-tag (IBA biotech). For immunopre-cipitatioh: ~1x107 cells were transiently transfected with the 180 kDa NCAM isoform or a control vector. Cells were incubated for 24 h and then starved overnight. After lysis, FGFR was purified on a StrepTactin Minicolumn (IBA Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and analyzed by immunoblotting with polyclonal anti­bodies against human NCAM.<br>
As appears from Fig. 5A, both 5 uM F3 module and 2.5 uM dendrimeric FG loop peptide substantially increase FGFR phosphorylation compared to the non-stimulated cells.<br>
Assay 2: The cDNA for the rat FGFR1 (IIIC isoform) was cloned by RT-PCR using RNA isolated from the rat PC12 cell line and inserted into a pcDNA3.1(+) plasmid (Invitrogen), which -allows expression of FGFR1 fused to the N-terminal of hexa-histidine. -8x105 HEK293 cells were cultured for 24h in 60 mm plates in full medium (DMEM 1965 supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 ug/ml strepto-<br>
mycin and 58.4 g/l Glutamax) and then transfected with 0.2 ug plasmid (with FGFR) using the LipofectAMIN PLUS1"1 reagent kit according to the manufacturer's instruc­tions (Gibco BRL). Cells were grown for another 24 hrs in full medium, and then shifted to starvation media (DMEM 1965) overnight. FGFR transfected cells were stimulated for 20 min with the specified compounds, lysed in 8M urea, 1 mM or-thovanadate (in PBS) and purified from the lysate via the His-tag as follows: The lysate was loaded on Ni2+/NTA-sepharose (Qiagen), washed with lysis buffer plus 10 mM imidazole, and the FGFR was eluted with lysis buffer plus 250 mM imidazole. The purified FGFR was analysed by immunoblotting using anti-pentahis (Qiagen) or anti-phosphotyrosine (PY20, Transduction Laboratories) antibodies. The bands were visualised by chemilumiscense and the band density was measured using a GeneGnome apparatus (SynGene).<br>
From Fig. 5B, it appears that addition of 5 p.M F3 module 2 or 25 uM monomeric FG loop peptide increase FGFR phosphorylation by approx. 150% and 100%, respec­tively, compared to control cells.<br>
Co-immunoprecipitation of NCAM and FGFR<br>
Since the binding between the NCAM and FGFR fragments could be demonstrated in vitro by SPR and NMR analyses it was of interest to confirm that native NCAM binds to FGFR in the living cells. Therefore, TREX-293 cells, stably transfected with FGFR containing a C-terminal Strepll-tag, were transiently transfected with the 180 kDa NCAM isoform. After lysing the cells, FGFR was affinity purified via the Strepll-tag and analyzed by immunoblotting using antibodies against NCAM. As appears from Fig. 5C, NCAM is indeed precipitated by FGFR, thus supporting our SPR and NMR experiments.<br>
Stimulation of neurite length of hippocampal neurons by the NCAM F3 module 2, FG loop (FGL-peptide, SEQ ID NO: 1), EF loop peptide (EFL-peptide, SEQ ID NO: 9) and a peptide derived from the axonal-associated cell adhesion mole­cule.<br>
Dissociated neurons from embryonic rat hippocampus (embryonic day 19), prepared as described (Skladchikqva et al., 1999), were grown on Permanox plastic (Nunc) for 24 h at a density of 6000 cells/cm2, at 37°C, 5% CO2 in Neurobasal medium con­taining 20 mM Hepes, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 jig/ml streptomycin, 0.4% BSA sup-<br>
plemented with B27 (Gibco BRL) and the below specified compounds. After 24 h, cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde, stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 and the length of neurites was measured as described (Skladchikova et al., 1999).<br>
As can be seen from Fig. 6A,B, 5 ^.M F3 module 2 substantially increased the length of neurites compared to the non-stimulated neurons. The effect was quantified in a dose-response study (Fig. 6C) demonstrating that the F3 module, the FG loop pep-tide and a truncated version of the peptide (A77 - K83) all induced neurite outgrowth with a bell-shaped curve typical of growth factor induced neuritogenesis (Hatten et al., 1988). The potency of the peptides was lower than that of the module, since a 10 times higher concentration was required for maximum effect, and the truncated form was less efficient than the extended form. The stimulatory effect of the F3 module and the FG loop peptide could be completely abrogated by an inhibitor of NCAM-stimulated neurite outgrowth, an antibody against FGFR (Williams et al., 1994) (Fig. 6D), further supporting the notion that the module and the FG loop pep­tide interact with FGFR. The EF loop peptide of the F3 module 2 was also capable to stimulate the neurite outgrowth significantly. As it appears from Fig. 7 the neurite outgrowth stimulation by the peptide was specifically blocked by an inhibitor of FGFR1.SU54402.<br>
To determine the functionally important amino acids of the FG loop peptide, it was analyzed by truncations .-and Ala substitutions of various amino acids. Two truncated versions (from the N- and C-terminal) of the FG loop peptide were produced: the nonamer V76 - S84 and the heptamer Ala77 - K83. Both of the truncated peptides re­tained approximately 50% of the stimulatory effect of the entire FG loop peptide (Fig. 6E), indicating that the turn region between the F and G p-strands is important for the NCAM-FGFR interaction. As can be seen from Fig. 6E, substitution of any amino acid in the heptameric peptide with Ala resulted in a decrease of the neuritogenic potency and a complete loss of function was achieved if E78, N79, Q80, G82, K83 were substituted, indicating that these residues are important for interaction with FGFR. Substitution of both Q80 and Q81 from the turn region of the FG loop with Ala in the entire FG loop peptide also completely inactivated the peptide (Fig. 6E). These find­ings corroborate the NMR experiments showing that N79, Q81, G82 and K83 were per­turbed in the F3 module 2 by binding to the FGFR Ig module 3, However, when the residues which seem to be important for interaction with ATP (Y74, K83 and K85) were<br>
substituted with Ala in the FG loop peptide, the peptide retained about 60% of the stimulatory effect of the non-mutated peptide (Fig. 6E).<br>
Furthermore, the structure of the heptameric peptide in the F3 module was com­pared to the known structure of a natural ligand of FGFR, FGF2 (PDB code: 4FGF, Eriksson et a/., 1993), and it was found that the peptide exhibited a striking structure and sequence similarity to a loop region in FGF2, A42 - R48 (Fig. 8A). The conforma­tions of the backbone atoms of the two peptides are virtually identical, with the side chains also having similar conformations. The only exception is R48 (in FGF2) whose side chain has a somewhat different conformation from that of K83. As can be seen from Fig. 8B, the peptide derived from FGF2 induced neurite outgrowth to the same extent as the similar NCAM peptide, and substitution of any amino acid with Ala re­sulted in a complete loss of function. The close sequence and structure similarity between the FG loop of the NCAM F3 module 2 and a part of FGF2 further corrobo­rate the present contention that the former is directly interacting-with FGFR.<br>
Since ATP can inhibit the NCAM-FGFR binding and interfere with the FGFR activa­tion by the F3 module 2 and, it may consequently affect the neuritogenic activity of the module. To test this assumption, neurons were stimulated with the below de­scribed compounds in the presence of ATP or AMP-PCP. As can be seen from Fig. 9, both ATP and AMP-RCP substantially reduced the neuritogenic effect induced by the F3 module 2 and the FG loop peptide. A complete inhibition of the effect of both the F3 module and the FG loop peptide was achieved when AMP-PCP was added, whereas only the effect of the FG loop peptide was completely inhibited when ATP was added, indicating that ATP is a less potent inhibitor than its non-hydrolysable analogue. Most significantly, when the amino acid residues of the FG loop peptide presumed to be of importance for ATP binding (Y74, K83 and K85) were substituted with Ala, the peptide retained its neuritogenic potency, but the stimulatory effect of the peptide could no longer be inhibited by ATP (Fig. 9), supporting the notion that ATP binding regulates the interaction between the F3 module and FGFR.<br>
These results shows that activation of FGFR in neurons by the NCAM F3 module 2, the FG loop and EF loop peptides induce neuritogenesis and that this effect can be inhibited by ATP or a ATP analogue.<br>
To investigate a neuritogenic potency of other FGL-like peptides, which according to invention constitute at least a part of the binding site of the FGFR in a FGFR ligand, a peptide consisting of the sequence derived from the axonal-associated cell adhe­sion molecule [NCBI: NP_031544.1] was used in the assay described above. The selected peptide was an 11-amino acid fragment of the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 5 having two amino acids truncated from the C-terminus. Fig. 11 demon­strates that likewise the FG-loop and EF-loop peptides the peptide was capable of stimulation of neurite outgrowth of hippocampal neurons. The maximal effect was observed at concentration of the peptide of about 0.3 ug/ml.<br>
Epitope specific antibodies<br>
Antibody specifically recognising an epitope comprising SEQ ID NO: 1 (FGL-peptide) were raised in rabbits according the standard procedure (Gill BM, Barbosa JA, Dinh TQ, Garrod S, O'Connor DT: Chromogranin B: isolation from pheochromo-cytoma, N-terminal sequence, tissue distribution and secretory vesicle processing. Regul Peptides 33:223-35, 1991). Synthetic FGL-peptide was coupled to a carrier protein, KLH (Keyhole Limpets Hemocyanin). The peptide was mixed with Freunds incomplete adjuvant and the mixture was injected into rabbits. 208 ug peptide was used per immunisation (per rabbit).<br>
Antibodies (serum) were tested for specificity by competitive ELISA using a series FGL-peptide truncated variants according to the protocol described in R.J. Jenny, T.L. Messier, L.A. Ouellette, and W.R. Church, Methods Enzymol. 222, 400 (1993). The results of the test are presented in Fig 10. 100% immunoreactivity was ob­served only with the intact FGL-peptide consisting of SEQ ID NO: 1. However, two truncated variants of the FGL peptide comprising the motif WAENQQGK did dem­onstrate a decreased, but distinct immunoreactivity: peptide t4 lacking the three C-terminal amino acids of full-length FGL-peptide (80% immunoreactivity), and peptide t1 lacking the three N-terminal amino acids of full-length FGL-peptide (40% immuno­reactivity).<br><br>
