Description<br>
Arylisoxazoline derivatives, processes for their preparation and their use as pesticides<br>
The invention relates to arylisoxazoline derivatives, to processes for their preparation, to compositions comprising them and to their use for controlling animal pests, in particular arthropods, such as insects and Acarina, and helminths.<br>
Owing to their biological activity, certain 1,3-oxazolines, 1,3-thiazolines, pyrrolines and imidazolines are suitable for controlling animal pests (see, for example, WO-A-93/24470, WO-A-95/04726 and WO-A-96/22283).<br>
However, owing to the multifarious requirements that modem pesticides have to meet, for example with respect to efficacy, persistency, activity spectrum, use spectrum, toxicity, combination with other active compounds, combination with formulating agents or synthesis, and owing to the possible occurrence of resistance, the development of such substances can never be considered to be concluded, and there is a constant great need for novel compounds which, at least in some aspects, offer advantages compared to the known compounds.<br>
It was an object of the present Invention to provide compounds which, under various aspects, widen the spectrum of pesticides.<br>
This object and other objects which have not been explicitly mentioned, which can be derived or deduced from the contexts discussed here, are achieved by arylisoxazoline derivatives of the formula (I),<br><br><br>

The present invention relates to the compounds of the formula (I) in the form of the free base or an acid addition salt. Acids which can be used for salt formation are, for example, inorganic acids, such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, nitric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, or organic acids, such as formic acid, acetic acid,<br><br>
propionic acid, malonic acid, oxalic acid, fumaric acid, adipic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, methanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid ortoluenesulfonic acid.<br>
In some cases, the compounds of the formula (I) contain one or more chiral carbon atoms or stereoisomers on double bonds. Enantiomers or diastereomers can therefore occur. The invention relates both to the pure isomers and to mixtures thereof. The mixtures of diastereomers can be separated into the components by customary methods, for example by selective crystallization from suitable solvents or by chromatography. Racemates can be separated into the enantiomers by customary methods, thus, for example, by salt formation with a chiral, enantiomerically pure acid, separation of the diastereomeric salts and liberation of the pure enantiomers by means of a base.<br>
The compounds according to the invention are prepared by methods which are known per se from the literature, as described in standard works on organic synthesis, for example Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie [Methods in Organic Chemistry], Georg-Thieme-Verlag, Stuttgart.<br>
The preparation is carried out under reaction conditions which are known and suitable for the abovementioned reactions. Other variants which are known per se, but not illustrated here in greater detail, may also be used.<br>
If desired, the starting materials may also be formed in situ, in such a way that they are not isolated from the reaction mixture but immediately reacted further to give the compounds of the formula (I).<br>
The general chemistry of 1,3-oxazolines is described, for example, in Tetrahedron, 1994, 50, 2297-2360 and in Nachr. Chem. Tech. Lab. 1996, 44, 744-750 . The invention also provides a process for preparing compounds of the formula (I, G = 3-isoxazinyl) by reacting 1,3-oxazormes, 1,3-thiazolines, pyrrolines and imidazolines of the formula (II) (see, for example, WO-A-96/22283) (suitably substituted by Xn and R1m) with a halogenating agent to give compounds of the<br><br>
formula (III), and reacting these compounds with an olefin (IV) (suitably substituted by R5), where initially an oxime of the formula (II),<br><br>
in which<br>
X and Z have the meanings given in formula (I)<br>
is reacted with a halogenating agent, preferably a chlorinating agent, to give a compound of the formula (III)<br><br>
in which<br>
Hal     is halogen, preferably CI,<br>
and then reacted further with an olefin of the formula (IV),<br><br>
in which R^ and t have the meanings given above.<br>
The invention also provides a process for preparing compounds of the formula (II) by reacting 1,3-oxazolines, 1,3-thiazolines, pyrrolines and imidazolines of the formula (V) (suitably substituted by X and R^) with hydroxylamine or its salts, if appropriate in the presence of a base,<br><br><br>

Methods A to D are illustrated using the synthesis of different subgroups of compounds of the formula (I), (G = 3-isoxazinyl) as an example:<br>
The isoxazole ring is advantageously generated in the presence of a base, for example selected from the group of the alkali metal hydroxides, alkali metal<br>
carbonates, alkoxides and amines.<br>
*<br><br><br><br>
Aldehydes of the formula (V) are generated by cleaving the olefins of the formula (VI) using an oxidizing agent. Suitable oxidizing agents are, for example, ruthenium or osmium compounds in combination with a periodate, or ozone:<br><br>
Some compounds of the fomnula (VI) have been described (WO-A-95/04726) or they can be prepared in a similar manner.<br>
The invention also provides a process for preparing compounds of the formula (I) (G = 5-isoxazinyl) by reacting 1,3-oxazolines, 1,3-thiazolines, pyrrolines and imidazolines of the formula (VII) (see, for example, WO-A 95/04726), suitably substituted by Xn and R1m, with a halooxime, where an olefin of the formula (VII)<br><br><br>

Method E is illustrated using the synthesis of compounds of the formula (I) (G = 3-isoxazinyl) as an example:<br>
The isoxazoie ring is generated in the presence of a base, selected, for example, from the group consisting of alkali metal hydroxides, alkali metal carbonates, alkoxides and amines.<br><br>
Various esters and amides as radicals R5 can be prepared, for example, from acid derivatives. These, for their part, are obtainable, for example, by ester hydrolysis, for example<br><br><br>
Suitable for use as hydrolyzing agents are, for example, aqueous alkali metal hydroxide solutions.<br>
During the preparation of the amides or esters, the acid can be activated using, for example, a carbodiimide, carbonyldiimidazole or an inorganic acid chloride, for example thionyl chloride.<br>
Various esters and amides as radical R5 can also be prepared, for example, from hydroxyl and amine derivatives. These, for their part, are obtainable, for example, by ester or amide hydrolysis, for example:<br><br><br>
Suitable for use as hydrolyzing agents are, for example, aqueous alkali metal hydroxide solutions.<br>
To prepare the amides or esters, the alcohol or the amine can be reacted, for example, with an activated acid, e.g. an acid chloride.<br>
Collections of compounds of the formula (I) which can be synthesized by the abovementioned scheme may also be prepared in a parallel manner and this may be effected manually or in a semiautomated or fully automated manner. In this case, it is possible, for example, to automate the procedure of the reaction, the work-up or the purification of the products or of the intermediates. In total, this is to be understood as meaning a procedure as is described, for example, by S.H. DeWitt in "Annual Reports in Combinatorial Chemistry and Molecular Diversity: Automated synthesis", Volume 1, Verlag Escom 1997, pages 69 to 77.<br><br>
A number of commercially available apparatuses as are offered by, for example, Stem Corporation, Woodrolfe Road, Tollesbury, Essex, CM9 8SE, England or H+P Labortechnik GmbH, Bruckmannring 28, 85764 OberschleiBheim, Germany, may be used for the parallel procedure of the reaction and work-up. For the parallel purification of compounds of the formula (I), or of intermediates obtained during the preparation, use may be made, inter alia, of chromatography apparatuses, for example those from ISCO, Inc., 4700 Superior Street, Lincoln, NE 68504. USA.<br>
The apparatuses mentioned lead to a modular procedure in which the individual process steps are automated, but manual operations have to be performed between the process steps. This can be avoided by employing semiintegrated or fully integrated automation systems where the automation modules in question are operated by, for example, robots. Such automation systems can be obtained, for example, from Zymark Corporation, Zymark Center, Hopkinton, MA 01748, USA.<br>
In addition to what has been described here, compounds of the formula (I) may be prepared in part or fully by solid-phase-supported methods. For this purpose, individual intermediate steps or all intermediate steps of the synthesis or of a synthesis adapted to suit the procedure in question are bound to a synthetic resin. Solid-phase-supported synthesis methods are described extensively in the specialist literature, for example Barry A. Bunin in The Combinatorial Index", Verlag Academic Press, 1998.<br>
The use of solid-phase-supported synthesis methods permits a series of protocols which are known from the literature and which, in turn, can be performed manually or in an automated manner. For example, the 'lea-bag method" (Houghten, US 4,631,211; Houghten et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, 1985, 82. 5131-5135), in which products from IRORI, 11149 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037. USA. are employed, may be semiautomated. The automation of solid-phase-supported parallel syntheses is performed successfully, for example, by apparatuses from Argonaut Technologies, Inc., 887 Industrial Road, San Carlos, CA 94070, USA or MultiSynTech GmbH, Wullener Feld 4. 58454 Witten, Germany.<br><br>

The invention also relates to compositions, for example crop protection compositions, preferably insecticidal, acaricidal, ixodicidal, nematicidal, molluscidal or fungicidal, particularly preferably insecticidal and acaricidal compositions, which comprise one or more compounds of the formula (I) in addition to suitable formulation auxiliaries.<br>
In general, the compositions according to the invention comprise from 1 to 95% by weight of the active compounds of the formula (I).<br>
For preparing the compositions according to the invention, the active compound and the other additives are combined and formulated as a suitable use form.<br>
They can be formulated in various ways, depending on how this is predetemriined by the biological and/or chemico-physical parameters. Suitable formulation possibilities are therefore:<br>
Wettable powders (WP), emulsifiable concentrates (EC), aqueous solutions (SL), emulsions, sprayable solutions, oil- or water-based dispersions (SC), suspoemulsions (SE), dusting powders (DP), seed dressings, granules in the form of microgranules, sprayed granules, absorption granules and adsorption granules, water-dispersible granules (WG), ULV formulations, microcapsules, waxes or baits.<br><br>
These individual types of formulation are known in principle and are described, for example, in: Winnacker-Kuchler, "Chemische Technologie" [Chemical Technology], Volume 7, C. Hanser Verlag Munich, 4th Edition 1986; van Falkenberg, "Pesticides Formulations", Marcel Dekker N.Y., 2nd Edition 1972-73; K. Martens, "Spray Drying Handbook", 3rd Edition 1979, G. Goodwin Ltd. London.<br>
The necessary formulation auxiliaries, such as inert materials, surfactants, solvents and further additives, are likewise known and are described, for example, in; Watkins, "Handbook of Insecticide Dust Diluents and Carriers", 2nd Edition, Darland Books, Caldwell N.J.; H. v. Olphen, "Introduction to Clay Colloid Chemistry", 2nd Edition, J. Wiley &amp; Sons, N.Y.; Marsden, "Solvents Guide", 2nd Edition, Interscience, N.Y, 1950; McCutcheon's, "Detergents and Emulsifiers Annual", MC Publ. Corp., Ridgewood NJ.; Sisley and Wood, "Encyclopedia of Surface Active Agents", Chem. Publ. Co, Inc., N.Y. 1964; Schonfeldt, "Grenzflachenaktive Athylenoxidaddukte" [Surface-active ethylene oxide adducts], Wiss. Verlagsgesell., Stuttgart 1967; Winnacker-Kuchler, "Chemische Technologie" [Chemical Technology], Volume 7, C. Hanser Verlag Munich, 4th Edition 1986.<br>
Combinations with other substances having a pesticidal action, fertilizers and/or growth regulators can be prepared on the basis of these fomriulations, for example in the form of a ready-to-use fonnulation or as a tank mix. Wettable powders are preparations which are uniformly dispersible in water and which, alongside the active compound, and in addition to a diluent or inert substance, also comprise wetting agents, for example polyethoxylated alkylphenols, polyethoxyiated fatty alcohols or alkyl- or alkylphenolsulfonates, and dispersing agents, for example sodium ligninsulfonate or sodium 2,2'-dinaphthylmethane-6,6'-disulfonate.<br>
Emulsifiable concentrates are prepared by dissolving the active compound in an organic solvent, for example butanol, cyclohexanone, dimethylformamide, xylene or also higher-boiling aromatics or hydrocarbons, with the addition of one or more emulsifiers. Emulsifiers which can be used are, for example: calcium alkylaryl-sulfonates, such as Ca dodecylbenzenesulfonate, or nonionic emulsifiers, such as fatty acid polyglycol esters, alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, fatty alcohol polyglycol ethers.<br><br>
propylene oxide/ethylene oxide condensation products, alky! polyethers, sorbitan fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters or polyoxyethylene sorbitol esters.<br>
Dusting powders are obtained by grinding the active compound with finely divided solid substances, for example talc, naturally occurring clays, such as kaolin, bentonite and pyrophyllite, or diatomaceous earth. Granules can be prepared either by spraying the active compound onto granular inert material capable of adsorption or by applying active compound concentrates to the surface of carrier substances, such as sand, kaolinites or granular inert material, by means of adhesives, for example polyvinyl alcohol, sodium polyacrylate or mineral oils. Suitable active compounds can also be granulated in the manner customary for the preparation of fertilizer granules - if desired as a mixture with fertilizers.<br>
In wettable powders, the active compound concentration is for example about 10 to 90% by weight, the remainder to make up 100% by weight comprising customary formulation constituents. In emulsifiable concentrates, the active compound concentration can be about 5 to 80% by weight. Dust-like formulations usually comprise 5 to 20% by weight of active compound, and sprayable solutions about 2 to 20% by weight. In granules, the content of active compound partly depends on whether the active compound is present in liquid or solid form and what granulating auxiliaries, fillers and the like are used.<br>
In addition, the active compound formulations mentioned comprise, if appropriate, the particular customary tackifiers, wetting agents, dispersing agents, emulsifiers, penetration agents, solvents, fillers or carrier substances.<br>
For use, the concentrates in the commercially available form are diluted in the customary manner, if appropriate, for example by means of water in the case of wettable powders, emulsifiable concentrates, dispersions and in some cases also microgranules. Dust-like and granular formulations as well as sprayable solutions are usually not diluted further with additional inert substances before use.<br><br>
The required amount applied varies with the external conditions, such as temperature or humidity. It can vary within wide limits, for example between 0.0005 and 10.0 kg/ha or more of active substance, but is preferably between 0.001 and 5 kg/ha.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention can be present in their commercially available formulations and in the use forms prepared from these formulations (see the above mentioned compositions) as mixtures with other active compounds, such as insecticides, attractants, sterilizing agents, acaricides, nematicides, fungicides, molluscides, growth-regulating substances or herbicides.<br>
The pesticides include, for example, phosphoric acid esters, carbamates, carboxylic acid esters, formamidines, tin compounds and substances produced by microorganisms.<br>

The active substances according to the invention are also suitable for the field of veterinary medicine, preferably for controlling endo- and ectoparasites, and for the field of animal husbandry.<br>
The active substances according to the invention can preferably be applied in a known manner, such as by oral application in the form of, for example, tablets, capsules, potions or granules, by dermal application in the form of, for example, dipping, spraying, pouring-on and spotting-on and dusting, and also by parenteral application in the fonm of, for example, injection.<br>
The compounds of the fomnula (I) according to the invention can accordingly also be employed particularly advantageously in livestock husbandry (for example cattle, sheep, pigs and poultry such as chickens, geese etc.). In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the novel compounds, if appropriate in suitable fonnulations (cf. above) and if appropriate with the drinking water or feed, are administered orally to the animals. Since excretion in the feces occurs in an effective fashion, the development of insects in the animal feces can be prevented very simply in this fashion. The dosages and fomiulations suitable in each case, in particular, depend on the type and developmental stage of the productive animals and also on the severity of infestation and can easily be detemnined and fixed by conventional methods. In the case of cattle, the compounds can be employed, for example, in dosages of 0.01 to 1 mg/kg of body weight.<br>
Accordingly, the invention also provides the use of a compound of the formula (I) or one of the abovementioned compositions for preparing a veterinary medicament.<br>

The invention also provides seed, comprising or coated with an effective amount of a compound according to the invention or of a composition according to the invention.<br>
The compounds of the formula (I) can also be employed for controlling harmful organisms in crops of known or genetically engineered plants yet to be developed. As a rule, the transgenic plants are distinguished by particular advantageous properties, for example by resistances to certain crop protection agents, resistances to plant diseases or pathogens of plant diseases such as certain insects or microorganisms such as fungi, bacteria or viruses. Other particular properties relate, for example, to the harvested material with regard to quantity, quality, storage properties, composition and specific constituents. Thus, transgenic plants with an elevated starch content or altered starch quality, or those with a different fatty acid spectrum of the harvested material, are known.<br>
The use in economically important transgenic crops of useful plants and ornamentals, for example, cereals such as wheat, barley, rye, oats, millet and sorghum, rice, cassava and maize or else crops of sugar beet, cotton, soya, oilseed rape, potatoes, tomatoes, peas and other vegetables is preferred.<br>
When being use in transgenic crops, in particular those in which the plants express an insecticide, effects are frequently found (in addition to the pesticidal effects which can be obsen/ed in other crops) which are specific to application in the transgenic crop in question, for example an altered or specifically widened spectrum of pests which can be controlled, or altered application rates which can be used for application.<br><br>
The invention therefore also provides the use of compounds of the formula (I) for controlling harmful organisms in transgenic crop plants.<br>
The use according to the invention of compounds of the fomiula (I) or compositions comprising them, for example an insecticide, acaricide, molluscide or nematicide, includes the case where the compound of the formula (I) or its salt is formed from a precursory substance only after application, for example in the insect, in a plant or in the soil.<br>
