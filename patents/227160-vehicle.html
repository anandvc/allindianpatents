The present invention relates to a vehicle that makes<br>
a motion such as turning with a body thereof slanted, and<br>
in particular to a vehicle including a fuel pipe that connects<br>
a fuel delivery section formed on a lower surface of a fuel<br>
tank and an injector.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Conventionally, in an intake structure of a vehicle<br>
disclosed in JP-A-2002-295344, a fuel injection valve of a<br>
fuel injection device is arranged so as to inject fuel upward<br>
into an intake passage to make it easy to remove the air contained<br>
in the fuel. In addition, an engine and the fuel injection<br>
device are arranged in parallel, a fuel tank is arranged to<br>
cover the engine and the fuel injection device, and a bottom<br>
of the fuel tank on the fuel injection device is set lower<br>
than a bottom of the fuel tank on the engine to increase a<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
However, in the conventional intake structure of the<br>
vehicle, a layout of a fuel pipe for sending fuel from a bottom<br>
of the fuel tank, which is set low, to the fuel injection<br><br>
valve is not, taken into account at all. Although the fuel<br>
pipe connects the bottom of the fuel tank, which is set low,<br>
and the fuel injection valve projecting to below a throttle<br>
body, a space for disposing the fuel pipe, interference with<br>
members around the fuel pipe, and the like are not taken into<br>
account.<br>
Thus, in order to solve such problems, it is an object<br>
of the invention to provide a vehicle in which a bent section,<br>
an angle of which is changeable, is formed in an intermediate<br>
part of a fuel pipe that connects a fuel delivery section<br>
for fuel formed on a lower surface of a fuel tank and an injector<br>
provided below the fuel tank, the bent section is provided<br>
to be close to a swing center position of the fuel tank, and<br>
the fuel pipe is arranged in a compact manner while securing<br>
a necessary length to improve maintainability for the members<br>
around the fuel tank.<br>
The vehicle of the invention adopts a constitution<br>
including a body frame; a fuel tank that is swingably supported<br>
on the body frame; an engine that is supported on the body<br>
frame; a fuel pump that is provided inside the fuel tank and<br>
supplies fuel to a fuel delivery section formed on a lower<br>
surface of the fuel tank; a fuel supply device that is provided<br>
below the fuel tank and supplies the fuel to the engine; and<br>
a fuel pipe that connects the fuel delivery section and the<br>
fuel supply device and has a bent section, an angle of which<br><br>
is changeable, in an intermediate part thereof, wherein the<br>
fuel pipe is provided such that the bent section is in a position<br>
closer to a swing center of the fuel tank than the fuel delivery<br>
section and the fuel supply device when viewed from a side<br>
of the vehicle.<br>
According to the invention, it is possible to arrange<br>
a fuel pipe in a compact manner while securing a necessary<br>
length of the fuel pipe to improve maintainability for members<br>
around the fuel tank.<br>

In the engine unit 7, a cylinder shaft of a cylinder block<br>
8 is inclined slightly to the front of the body and a transmission<br>
case 9, which is located under the cylinder block 8 and houses<br>
a crankshaft and the transmission, is suspended and supported<br>
by the main frame 4 and the down tube 5 toward the vehicle<br>
width direction. An upper end of the engine unit 7 is fixed<br>
to a bracket 10 that is fixed to the main frame 4 . By a not-shown<br>
drive sprocket locked to a drive shaft of the engine unit 7<br>
and a not-shown chain wound around this drive sprocket, engine<br>
power is transmitted to a rear wheel 11 through the chain.<br>
An injector 12 serving as a fuel supply device, an intake<br>
pipe 13, and an exhaust pipe 14 are connected to the cylinder<br>
block 8. The injector 12 has a fuel supply pipe 15 connected<br>
at an upper end thereof and inj ects fuel into a cylinder according<br>
to the control of a control unit 40. A throttle body 16 is<br>
connected to the intake pipe 13. The intake pipe 13 adjusts<br><br>
an amount of intake air, which is supplied from a not-shown<br>
air cleaner, with a throttle valve (not shown) in the throttle<br>
body 16 and supplies the air into the cylinder. An intake<br>
air pressure sensor 17 is connected to an intake port section<br>
(not shown) in the intake pipe 13. The intake air pressure<br>
sensor 17 has a function of detecting an intake air pressure<br>
in the intake port section and outputs a detection signal of<br>
the intake air pressure to the control unit 40.<br>
A not-shown steering shaft is inserted through the head<br>
pipe 2 so as to turn freely. A not-shown steering handle is<br>
attached to an upper end of the steering shaft. In addition,<br>
an upper end of a front fork 18 is attached to the steering<br>

front fork 18 so as to rotate freely.<br>
A fuel tank 20 is provided above the main frame 4 and<br>
the sub-frame 6. A tandem seat 30 is provided behind the fuel<br>
tank 20. As shown in an enlarged left side view of the fuel<br>
tank and the body frame in Fig. 2, a bottom surface front center<br>
section 21a is formed in a front center of a bottom surface<br>
section 21 of the fuel tank 20 when viewed from a side of the<br>
vehicle in the figure. A flat section 21b is formed behind<br>
the bottom surface front center section 21a so as to be parallel<br>
with a parallel section of the sub-frame 6. In addition, as<br>
shown in Fig. 3, a bottom surface front left side section 21c<br>
and a bottom surface front right side section 21d projecting<br><br>
downward from the bottom surface front center section 21a are<br>
formed on both left and right sides of the bottom front center<br>
section 21a. Note that, when the vehicle is viewed from a<br>
side of the vehicle, a left side of the vehicle viewed from<br>
the side is set as the front (or the rear) and a right side<br>
of the vehicle viewed from the side is set as the rear (or<br>
the front) . The same holds true for the following description.<br>
Guide brackets 22 of a lateral U shape opening to the<br>
front (the left in the figure) are protrudingly provided on<br>
respective sidewalls, which are opposed to the main frame 4,<br>
in the bottom surface front left side section 21c and the bottom<br>
surface front right side section 21d of the fuel tank 20.<br>
Positioning members 23 are protrudingly provided on respective<br>
sides of the main frame 4 opposed to the guide brackets 22.<br>
The front of the fuel tank 2 0 is supported on the main frame<br>
4 by inserting the guide brackets 22, which are protrudingly<br>
provided on the respective sidewalls of the bottom surface<br>
front left side section 21c and the bottom surface front right<br>
side section 21d, into the positioning members 23 protrudingly<br>
provided in opposed positions of the respective sides of the<br>
main frame 4.<br>
Respective protrudingly provided positions of the bottom<br>
surface front left side section 21c, the bottom surface front<br>
right side section 21d, and the respective positioning members<br>
23 of the main frame 4 are determined to form a space A between<br><br>
the bottom surface front center section 21a of the fuel tank<br>
20 and an upper surface of the main frame 4 when the front<br>
of the fuel tank 20 is positioned.<br>
A bracket 24 for fixing a rear end of the fuel tank 20<br>
to the sub-frame 6 is attached to a rear (right in the figure)<br>
end of the flat section 21b of the fuel tank 20. On the sub-frame<br>
6, a positioning member 25 is protrudingly provided in a position<br>
opposed to the bracket 24. The rear end of the fuel tank 20<br>
is supported on the sub-frame 6 by fixing the bracket 24 to<br>
the positioning member 25 of the sub-frame 6 with a bolt 31<br>
via a rubber damper 26.<br>
The rear end of the fuel tank 20 is supported on the sub-frame<br>
6 by the bracket 24 and the positioning member 25 of the sub-frame<br>
6, whereby a space B is formed between the flat section 21b<br>
of the fuel tank 20 and an upper surface of the sub-frame 6.<br>
The front of the fuel tank 20 is supported on the main<br>
frame 4 and the rear end of the fuel tank 20 is supported on<br>
the sub-frame 6 as described above, whereby the space A and<br>
the space B are made continuous. As a result, it is possible<br>
to store plural components in the spaces A and B continuously<br>
formed between the bottom surface section 21 of the fuel tank<br>
20 and the respective upper surfaces of the main frame 6 and<br>
the sub-frame 4.<br>
It is possible to perform maintenance for the fuel tank<br>
20 by removing the bracket 24 at the rear end thereof from<br><br>
the positioning member 25 to lift the rear end upward with<br>
the guide brackets 22 and the positioning members 23 in the<br>
front thereof as a swing center C.<br>
As shown in the enlarged left side view showing the structure<br>
inside and around the fuel tank in Fig. 2, a fuel pump 27 for<br>
delivering fuel in the fuel tank 2 0 to the fuel supply pipe<br>
15 is vertically provided in the flat section 21g so as to<br>
be housed in the fuel tank 20 except a fuel delivery section<br>
27a and a power supply section 27c attached to a lower end<br>
of the fuel pump 27. The fuel pump 27 is vertically provided<br>
such that a fuel intake section (not shown) is exposed above<br>
a surface of the flat section 21b in the fuel tank 20 and the<br>
fuel delivery section 27a and the power supply section 27c<br>
are exposed below a surface of the flat section 21b on an outer<br>
surface of the fuel tank 20.<br>
In the fuel pump 27, a liquid level meter 2 8 for measuring<br>
a quantity of fuel in the fuel tank 20 is integrally attached<br>
to a body side 27b thereof. The liquid level meter 28 includes<br>
an arm section 28b with a base end thereof attached to a swing<br>
shaft 28a so as to swing freely and a float 28c attached to<br>
a tip of the arm section 2 8b.<br>
The float 28c floats on a fuel surface in the fuel tank<br>
20 and the arm section 28b supporting the float 28c swings<br>
in response to a change of the fuel surface. The liquid level<br>
meter 28 converts a change of a swing position of the float<br><br>
2 8c into a change in an angle of the swing shaft 2 8a to measure<br>
a quantity of fuel. In Fig. 2, the float 28c is located in<br>
an upper part and a lower part in the fuel tank 20. A not-shown<br>
signal/power cable, which is attached from an attached position<br>
of the flat section 21b to a surface further on the outer side<br>
than the flat section 21b of the fuel tank 20 and connected<br>
to the power supply section 27c, is provided in the liquid<br>
level meter 28. This signal/power cable is connected to an<br>
internal connection terminal (not shown) of the power supply<br>
section 27c in the fuel tank 20 and is connected to a main<br>
harness 50 through a harness 51 connected to an external<br>
connection terminal (not shown) of the power supply section<br>
27c outside the fuel tank 20. The signal/power cable outputs<br>
a fuel measurement signal to the control unit 40 through the<br>
harness 51 and themainharness 50. In addition, the signal/power<br>
cable supplies electric power supplied from a relay 45 to the<br>
fuel pump 27 through the harness 51 and the main harness 50.<br>
As shown in Fig. 4 which is a sectional view taken along<br>
line B-B in Fig. 2, a fuel supply pipe 15 is attached to the<br>
fuel delivery section 27a of the fuel pump 27. The fuel supply<br>
pipe 15 passes through the bottom surface section 21 of the<br>
fuel tank 20 using the space B, extends upward on the left<br>
side in the front outside the fuel tank 2 0 from the bottom<br>
surface section 21, and forms a bent section 15a near the swing<br>
center C of the fuel tank 20 to be connected to the injector<br><br>
12. In addition, as shown in Fig. 5, in the fuel supply pipe<br>
15, a bent section 15b is also formed on a side where the fuel<br>
supply pipe 15 passes through the bottom surface section 21<br>
of the fuel tank 20 from the fuel delivery section 27a.<br>
In the fuel supply pipe 15, a part connected to the fuel<br>
delivery section 27a and a part connected to the injector 12<br>
are formed of a metal member. Intermediate parts forming the<br>
bent sections 15a and 15b are formed of a flexible member such<br>
as rubber. The bent section 15a of the fuel supply pipe 15<br>
is provided to be located closer to a swing center in the front<br>
side of the fuel tank 20 than the injector 12 and the fuel<br>
delivery section 27a when viewed from the side of the vehicle.<br>
The fuel supply pipe 15 has a length not interfering with<br>
the fuel tank 20 at the time when the fuel tank 2 0 is turned<br>
and opened.<br>
The fuel supply pipe 15 between the bent sections 15a<br>
and 15b and the fuel delivery section 27a is provided along<br>
a lower surface of the flat section 21b of the fuel tank 20<br>
using the space B formed between the flat section 21b of the<br>
fuel tank 20 and the upper surface of the sub-frame 6. The<br>
bent section 15a of the fuel supply pipe 15 is provided to<br>
be located above the main frame 4, the injector 12, and the<br>
fuel delivery section 27a when viewed from the side of the<br>
vehicle.<br>
In the space A formed between the bottom surface front<br><br>
center section 21a of the bottom surface section 21 of the<br>
fuel tank 20 and the upper surface of the main frame 6, the<br>
control unit 40 for controlling steering of the motorcycle<br>
1 is fixed to the upper surface of the main frame 6 by an attaching<br>
member 41. A harness 52 is connected between the control unit<br>
40 and the injector 12, the throttle body 16, the intake air<br>
pressure sensor 17, the liquid level meter 28, and the like<br>
via the main harness 50. The control unit 40 controls operations<br>
of various actuators related to the engine unit 7 on the basis<br>
of various detection signals from various sensors. In the<br>
space A, a relay 45 for controlling power supply to a control<br>
system of the motorcycle 1 is fixed to the upper surface of<br>
the main frame 4 by an attaching member 46. A harness 53 is<br>
connected to the relay 45 and is connected to the main harness<br>
50. The relay 45 supplies electric power to the injector 12,<br>
the throttle body 16, the intake air pressure sensor 17, the<br>
liquid level meter 28, the control unit 40, and the like through<br>
the harness 53 and the main harness 50. The main harness 50<br>
is disposed along sides of the main frame 4 and the sub-frame<br>
6 and the like.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a state in which the fuel tank 20 is turned<br>
and opened to the front of the vehicle with respect to the<br>
swing center C. As shown in the figure, in performing an<br>
operation for turning and opening the fuel tank 20, after the<br>
respective harnesses 51, 52, and 53 of the power supply section<br><br>
27c, the control unit 40, and the relay 45 are removed, the<br>
flat section 21b of the fuel tank 20 rises in a direction to<br>
the front of the vehicle, the bent section 15a of the fuel<br>
supply pipe 15 extends according to this rising operation,<br>
and the fuel supply pipe 15 between the fuel delivery section<br>
27a and the bent section 15a opens mainly upward. In this<br>
way, when the fuel tank 20 is turned and opened, since the<br>
bent section 15a of the fuel supply pipe 15 extends and the<br>
fuel supply pipe 15 between the fuel delivery section 27a and<br>
the bent section 15a opens mainly upward, the fuel supply pipe<br>
15 never interferes with the other members and never hinders<br>
maintenance.<br>
As described above, in the motorcycle 1 in this embodiment,<br>
the bent section 15a of the fuel supply pipe 15 is provided<br>
to be located closer to the swing center in the front of the<br>
fuel tank 20 than the injector 12 and the fuel delivery section<br>
27a when viewed from the side of the vehicle. The fuel supply<br>
pipe 15 has a length not interfering with the fuel tank 20<br>
when the fuel tank 2 0 is turned and opened. In addition, the<br>
fuel supply pipe 15 between the bent section 15a and the fuel<br>
delivery section 27a is provided along the lower surface of<br>
the flat section 21b of the fuel tank 20 using the space B<br>
formed between the flat section 21b of the fuel tank 20 and<br>
the upper surface of the sub-frame 6. The bent section 15a<br>
is provided to be located above the main frame 4, the injector<br><br>
12, and the fuel delivery section 27a when viewed from the<br>
side of the vehicle.<br>
Therefore, it is possible to arrange the fuel supply pipe<br>
in a compact manner while securing a necessary length thereof<br>
and improve maintainability. When the fuel tank is turned<br>
and opened, the fuel supply pipe between the bend section and<br>
the fuel delivery section moves mainly upward. Thus, it is<br>
possible to control interference between the fuel supply pipe<br>
and the other components and improve maintainability. In<br>
addition, when the fuel tank is turned and opened, the fuel<br>
supply pipe between the bent section and the fuel delivery<br>
section mainly moves and the part of the fuel supply pipe extends<br>
along the lower surface of the fuel tank. Thus, it is possible<br>
to control interference between the fuel supply pipe and the<br>
other components and improve maintainability.<br>
Note that, in the embodiment described above, the fuel<br>
supply pipe 15 has the two bent sections 15a and 15b. However,<br>
the invention is not limited to this. For example, as shown<br>
in Fig. 6, a fuel supply pipe 50 having plural bent sections<br>
may be used. Fig. 6 shows the fuel pump 27 and the fuel supply<br>
pipe 50 viewed from the bottom surface side of the vehicle.<br>
In this case, the injector 12 is arranged on the right side<br>
with respect to a vehicle center D in the figure and the fuel<br>
delivery section 27a is arranged downward to the left with<br>
respect to the vehicle center D in the figure. Note that the<br><br>
front of the vehicle is set in the upper part in the figure<br>
and the rear of the vehicle is set in the lower part in the<br>
figure.<br>
In this case, in the fuel supply pipe 50, a first bend<br>
section 50a, a second bent section 50b, and a third bent section<br>
50c are formed in order from a part close to the fuel delivery<br>
section 27a. Intermediate parts having these first to the<br>
third bent sections 50a to 50c are formed of a flexible member<br>
such as rubber. Note that the second bent section 50b is provided<br>
to be located above the main frame 4 when viewed from the side<br>
of the vehicle.<br>
In this fuel supply pipe 50, the respective intermediate<br>
parts including the first bent section 50a and the third bent<br>
section 50c are provided along the lower surface of the flat<br>
section 21b of the fuel tank 20 using the space A between the<br>
bottom surface front center section 21a of the fuel tank 20<br>
and the upper surface of the main frame 4 and the space B formed<br>
between the flat section 21b and the upper surface of the sub-frame<br>
6.<br>
When the fuel tank 20 is turned and opened, the fuel supply<br>
pipe 50 opens mainly upward in the part between the fuel delivery<br>
section 27a and the secondbent section 50b. Thus, it is possible<br>
to obtain the same advantages as the embodiment described above.<br>
Note that, in the examples of the fuel supply pipes 15<br>
and 50, the intermediate parts having the bent sections are<br><br>
formed of a flexible member. However, the invention is not<br>
limited to this. For example, it is also possible that the<br>
parts having the bent sections are formed of a flexible member<br>
and the bent sections are connected by metal pipes or the like.<br>
In short, a structure of a fuel supply pipe is not specifically<br>
limited as long as parts having bent sections are formed of<br>
a flexible member.<br>
In addition, in the examples of the fuel supply pipes<br>
15 and 50, the fuel supply pipes 15 and 50 have one bent section<br>
and three bent sections, respectively. However, the invention<br>
is not limited to this. A fuel supply pipe may have two or<br>
four or more bent sections. The number of bent sections is<br>
not specifically limited. In addition, respective bent<br>
sections of a fuel pipe may be formed of metal pipes having<br>
a universal joint function.<br>
