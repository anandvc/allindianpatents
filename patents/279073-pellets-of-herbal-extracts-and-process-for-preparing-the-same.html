PELLETS OF HERBAL EXTRACTS AND PROCESS FOR PREPARING THE SAME;<br>
UNIJULES LIFE SCIENCES LTD., A CORPORATION ORGANIZED AND EXISTING UNDER THE LAWS OF INDIA, WHOSE ADDRESS IS 1505/1, UNIVERSAL SQUARE, SHANTINAGAR, NAGPUR - 440 002, MAHARASHTRA, INDIA.<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED<br>
 <br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to a process and a product of coating herbal extracts on the surface of pellets or aggregates of inert particulate matter and optionally filling such pellets in capsules.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Herbal medicines are largely traditional. Solid dosage forms of products from medicinal plants and their extracts available in the market are restricted to the traditional dosage forms of powders, tablets and powders filled in capsules.<br>
Process of preparation of a powder, a tablet or a capsule comprises use of crude herbal materials and extracts prepared from crude herbs. The crude herbs are washed, dried, crushed, pulverized, and sifted through a suitable sieve and finally this powder is used as such, or converted into a tablet or filled up in capsule shells, usually made of hard gelatin or any other suitable material. The prior art dosage forms, thus, effectively delivered the plant material or its extract in a powder form, and its bioavailability and efficacy was limited by the efficacy with which the active principles of powder got released and absorbed in the digestive tract of the patient.<br>
Further, when two or more herbal extracts were aimed at being administered in a single dosage form, they will have to be invariably in a direct physical contact with each other in a tablet or a capsule form in a prior art process, exposing them to unknown interactions with complex components of each other right from stage of mixing together for processing purpose, through compressing together in a tablet or filling together in a capsule, and continuing the physical contact all through<br>
2<br>
 <br>
storage up to actual administration to the patient. Traditional systems of medicine based on herbal extracts, such as Ayurveda are regarded as authentic on account of practices followed for generations with known effects on pathological problems for which they are applied. The authenticity of these practices is considered to be maintained so long as they conform to the books of ancient scriptures in spirit. In Ayurvedic system, when more than one extracts are intended to be used for a treatment, they are either taken sequentially and separately or mixed immediately prior to oral administration.<br>
Thus, when it comes to administration of crude herbal extracts for any reason, because of their complex and substantially unknown composition, and because in intimate physical contact for a long time, interactions of two or more crude herbal extracts and their effect on their pharmaceutical efficacy and bioavailability will be largely unknown, there is a reason to state that such intimate physical mixing be avoided altogether.<br>
Thus, there is a need to evolve an appropriate method by which it would also be possible to formulate, store and administer a mixture of crude herbal extracts in a single dosage form without giving a scope for their coming in intimate contact or allowing least possible contact with each other before oral administration so that treatments involving more than one crude herbal extract can be made available in one and the same dosage form.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Jiang and Wang (2005) in a patent application no. CN1682966A have disclosed a product oral disintegrating tablet containing Yunnan Manyleaf pan's Rhizome extract and its preparing process. Said application discloses orally disintegrating Gongxuening tablet as a kind of medicine<br>
3<br>
 <br>
preparation for treating menorrhagia, metrorrhagia and chronic pelvic inflammation. The medicine preparation has the functions of cooling blood, arresting bleeding, clearing away heat, eliminating wetness, dispersing blood clots and relieving pain. The application also relates to the preparation process of orally disintegrated Gongxuening tablet, and the preparation process includes preparing pellet, coating powder and tablet pressing. The patent does not disclose a capsule containing the pellets.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention embodies a process of delivering the herbal extracts, including a herbal drug, in a form of a coat over pellets, optionally applying a finishing coat and an optional color over the coated pellets, and filling the said coated pellets of one or more of an extract in the same capsule optionally with color coated non-pareil seeds. The invention also describes a process of preparation of such pellets, a process of filling such pellets in capsule of hard gelatin or other material or pressing these pellets into tablets.<br>
The invention is also embodied in the benefits it imparts to a herbal extract in general and a crude herbal extract in particular, of increase in the surface area of the extract several-fold resulting from applying and coating on inert beads of a suitable size made of an inert material, to facilitate improvement in bioavailability of the active ingredients.<br>
This invention is also embodied in the products in the form of herbal pellets, herbal pellet filled capsules, the said capsules being transparent or otherwise. This invention also embodies a method of preparing a dosage form in which physical contact between individual particles in a crude herbal extract with each other or between particles of two or more crude<br>
4<br>
 <br>
herbal extracts with each other is substantially limited or practically prevented.<br>
DETAILS OF INVENTION<br>
The process essentially involves applying extract layer on a core of pellets of a suitable size consisting of an inert material available in the form of beads. Such inert beads are conventionally used in pharmaceutical science, and are readily available in market in all industrial countries. The advantages of a process of coating of an extract on pellets is that the coating usually gives a uniform and continuous product coating. Aqueous or organic coatings can be applied. Coating and drying take place in one machine. In terms of containment, the coating process and the filling and emptying of the machine can be carried out in complete isolation and without product spreading into the environment.<br>
The most preferred bead is one prepared from starch and sucrose, for use in confectionary as well as in pharmaceutical manufacturing. However, beads of any pharmaceutical^ acceptable excipient may be used, including, for example, microcrystalline cellulose, vegetable gums, waxes, and the like. The primary characteristic of the inert bead is to be inert, with regard both to extract and the other excipients in the pellet and with regard to the patient who will ultimately ingest the pellets.<br>
The size of the beads depends, of course, on the desired size of the pellets to be manufactured. In general, pellets can be as small as 0.1 mm, or as large as 2 mm. Preferred beads are from about 0.3 to about 0.8 mm, in order to provide finished pellets in the desired preferred size range of from about 0.5 to about 1.5 mm in diameter.<br>
5<br>
 <br>
It is always prudent to select beads with a reasonably narrow particle size distribution, in order to improve the uniformity of various coatings desired to be added and the homogeneity of the final product. For example, the beads may be specified as being of particle size ranges such as from 14 to 20 U.S. mesh, from 20 to 25 U.S. mesh or from 25 to 35 U.S. mesh to obtain acceptable size distributions of various sizes.<br>
The amount of beads to be used obviously depends on the weight and thickness of the added layers; in general, the beads comprise from about 15 to about 90 percent of the product. More preferably, the charge of beads should represent from about 20 to 65 percent of the product.<br>
When manufacture of the pellets begins with inert beads, the extract is coated on the beads to yield a final drug concentration of about 1 to about 50 percent of the product, in general. The amount of extract, of course, depends on the desired dose of the drug and the quantity of pellets, which it is desired to administer. The usual amount of pellets is that amount which is conveniently held in gelatin capsules.<br>
Historically, this process has been conducted in conventional coating pans similar to those employed in sugar coating processes. This process can be used to prepare pellets, but this equipment has less efficient air flow and drying capabilities which limits application rates and can result in longer processing times in order to minimize agglomerations.<br>
Alternately the present product could be made in fluidized bed equipment (using a rotary processor), or in rotating plate equipment. The rotating plate equipment typically consists of a cylinder, the bottom of which is a rotatable plate. Motion of the mass of particles to be coated is provided by friction of the mass between the stationary wall of the cylinder and the rotating bottom of it. Means can be provided to apply warm air to dry the<br>
6<br>
 <br>
mass, and liquids can be sprayed on the mass and balanced against the drying rate as in the fluidized bed case.<br>
Extract may be built up on the cores by spraying a slurry comprising extract suspended in a solution of the excipients, dissolved or suspended in sufficient water and Isopropyl alcohol (IPA) to make the slurry sprayable. Such slurry may be milled through a machine adapted for grinding suspension in order to reduce the particle size of extract. Grinding in suspension form is desirable because it avoids dust generation and containment problems, which arise in grinding dry powder drugs. A preferred method for applying this suspension is in the classic pharmaceutical fluidized bed coating device, which consists simply of a vertical cylinder with an air-permeable bottom and an upward spraying nozzle close above the bottom, or a downward-spraying nozzle mounted above the product mass. The cylinder is charged with particles to be coated, sufficient volume of air is drawn through the bottom of the cylinder to suspend the mass of particles, and the liquid to be applied is sprayed onto the mass. The temperature of the fluidizing air is balanced against the spray rate to maintain the mass of pellets at the desired level of moisture and stickiness while the coating is built up.<br>
A finishing layer over the extract layer is not necessary in every case, but frequently improves the elegance of the product and its handling, storage and machinability and may provide further benefits as well. The simplest finishing layer is simply a small amount, about less than 1% of an antistatic ingredient such as talc or silicon dioxide, simply dusted on the surface of the pellets. Another simple finishing layer is a small amount, about 1%, of a wax such as beeswax melted onto the circulating mass of pellets to further smooth the pellets, reduce static charge, prevent any<br>
7<br>
 <br>
tendency for pellets to stick together, and increase the hydrophobicity of the surface.<br>
More complex finishing layers may constitute a final sprayed-on layer of ingredients. For example, a thin layer of polymeric material such as hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone and the like, in an amount such as from about 2% up to about 10%, may be applied. The polymeric material may also carry a suspension of an opacifier, a bulking agent such as talc, or a coloring material, particularly an opaque finely divided color agent such as red or yellow iron oxide. Such a layer quickly dissolves away in the stomach, but provides an added measure of pharmaceutical elegance and protection from mechanical damage to the product.<br>
Finishing layers to be applied to the present product are of essentially the same types commonly used in pharmaceutical science to make the surface smooth and shining, and color the products, and may be formulated and applied in the manners commonly known to a person skilled in the art of manufacture of pharmaceutical dosage forms.<br>
The pellets coated with herbal extracts by process of this invention are dust free, round in shape, free flowing, with good dispersibility, decreased hygroscopicity, better uniformity in grain size distribution, with even distribution of drugs, and heavy metal content is also within recommended limits of W.H.O. and US F.D.A. i.e. for Lead, less than 10 ppm, for Cadmium less than 0.3 ppm, for Arsenic less than 10 ppm, and for Mercury 1 ppm. The tests for heavy metals are carried out as per US Pharmacopoea methods; for Lead - as per USP 23,for Arsenic as per USP 24 , Mercury as per USP 25 , and Cadmium is<br>

 <br>
estimated as per the method given in the book 'Quality control methods for medicinal plant material' WHO Geneva 1998 page 61<br>
This invention, in general, is applicable to all herbal extracts that can be palletized in the way described in this invention. This invention embodies capsules as an oral dosage form containing pellets coated with a herbal extract. The pellets may be coated with only one extract or, when the<br>
extracts have no incompatibility with each other either for chemical reasons or when the extracts pertains to a pharmaceutical system where mixing extracts from two or more plants is not barred during preparation and storage of the product, the pellets may also be coated with more than one extract on the same batch. The pellets may or may not be coated with a finishing layer. The pellets containing a finishing layer may or may not contain a color or they may or may not be additionally colored. The capsules may be filled with pellets of only one extract, or of more than one extract prepared in independent batches, with or without additional colored non-pareil seeds. Thus, it is possible to envisage several variations of embodiments covered by this invention.<br>
However, a special application lies in its application for improvement of Ayurvedic drug treatment on account of coating of an extract on herbal pellets, surface area available for action and absorption increases tremendously and further particle-to-particle contact within the same extract or two different extracts existing in a same packing / storage space such as a capsule, gets minimized. Such a contact can get further minimized when coated pellets are further applied a finishing coat, which practically eliminates such a possibility. This makes it possible to make mixtures of extracts for improving efficacy of Ayurvedic preparation without prejudicing the basic practices of Ayurveda   wherein interaction of two<br>
9<br>
 <br>
different extracts before they are inside stomach is required to be avoided. The increase in surface area leads to improvement in their bioefficacy and bioavailability without resorting to purification of an active ingredient, a method not complaint with Ayurveda, and without changing relative content of other ingredients in the crude extract prepared adhering to the recommended Ayurvedic practice.<br>
Ayurvedic drug treatment is a traditional system of medicine in India based predominantly on use of extracts of medicinal plants prepared by ways scrupulously recommended by Ayurveda and validated for their medicinal effect by observations over several generations. The medicinal plant extracts used in this system, although crude, are highly specific for their efficacy only when prepared in the recommended way.<br>
Multiple components present in crude plants behave like a polytherapy. The different components of the extract modulate the activity of each other and are relatively nontoxic as they are present in naturally well balanced ratios (Saxena, R.C., World Congress on Biotechnological Developments in Medicinal Substances of Plant and Marine Origin, Lucknow. (India), Feb. 19-22 (1995) For example, of the various components present in Glycyrrhiza glabra Linn., glycyrrhezinic acid in its pure isolated form has shorter life as compared to when it is a part of unpurified crude extract of the same plant. . Similarly reserpine from Rauwolfia serpentina Benth. is more toxic, morphine from Papaver somniferum Linn, is more addictive and bioavailability of curcumin from Curcuma longa Linn, is poor when purified<br>
Therefore it can be said that isolation of an active principle from among different components of natural substances alters its pharmacokinetic as well as pharmacodynamic profile. An attempt of improvement In Ayurvedic<br>
10<br>
 <br>
drug therapy, the age old traditional system of medicine in India based predominantly on use of crude extracts of medicinal plants, through isolation of chief active principle is not considered advisable. The Ayurvedic extracts are best when their composition in crude form is not altered by way of a purification step in anticipation that this will lead to improvement in efficacy. Thus, improvement in Aurvedic drug therapy has formidable constraints for further improvement and achievement of improvement without purifying a crude extract is a challenge.<br>
Invention described in this specification makes no change in crude forms of the extract, it only changes the surface area available for absorption and bio-activity. Relative content of individual components in the extract remains unaltered, which ensures the same medicinal properties but with more efficacious pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic action of its ingredients. Thus, the requirement that the crude extract should not be purified to an extent not recommended in Ayurveda is also complied and an improvement in efficacy inherent from improved surface area available for absorption and action is also achieved. Thus this invention provides a feasible route / tool to improve efficacy of Ayurvedic treatments by pelletizing Ayurvedic drugs. This is a very important achievement of this invention.<br>
The established practice of self manufacturing and dispensing by the Ayurved practitioner after formulation as per Ayurvedic methodology and dispensing small quantities at a time also have important merits. What they achieve is that the components of the Ayurvedic drug treatment remain separate from each other until administered orally, they are not exposed to interaction with each other during preparation or in storage. This invention helps to achieve the effect of this principle even for<br>
11<br>
 <br>
formulations which aim at administering two or more ayurvedic extracts in one and the same dosage form. Here too the individual plant extracts remain distinctly separate from each other even in storage in a single capsule and they come in contact with each other, within the same plant extract as well as between two or more different plant extracts, only after ingestion. This becomes clear from the manufacturing process in which crude extract ingredients are first deposited on inert spherical beads, which are further individually coated with a finishing coat, which helps in preventing the coat of the extract with coat of extract of other individual pellet particle, whether of the same extract or another extract. They are then dried, mixed and offered as attractive capsules. It has been noted that attractive and elegant capsules add to the acceptance and compliance to the products by patients, facilitating the success of the therapy. The coating as well as spherical shape of beads ensures that the individual ingredients come in minimal contact of each other during their storage until their actual use by the patient. When the spherical beads are not coated with a finishing coat, of course, some contact between medicinal coat of two beads shall inevitably occur, however, such contact shall be very minimal and hence, even in uncoated beads, this invention provides a way to minimize a contact between particles of a crude extract with another particle of same or different extract packed and stored in same dosage form.<br>
The coating is formulated with such ingredients which dissolve in the stomach, thus making available all the ingredients in original Ayurvedic intended form as it made fresh and delivered at the time of administration itself.<br>
12<br>
 <br>
Thus a herbal pellet formulation of this invention is in true spirit of Ayurveda with the following advantages:<br>
1.	Spherical shape of pellets enable them to flow freely and pack uniformly, thereby alleviating handling and packaging problems<br>
2.	The drug coated pellets can be given an outer coating of different colour that distinguish one drug from the other and these can be blended and filled into transparent hard gelatin capsules* This improved elegance facilitated better acceptability and compliance to the product by the patient.<br>
3.	It has better bioavailability due to larger area in comparison with conventional dosage form.<br>
4.	It is economical, feasible and viable.<br>

The following examples set out the preparation of a number of different pellets<br>
within the concept of the present invention. The examples are not to be<br>
construed as limiting the scope of invention but are to be construed as illustrative<br>
only in nature, intended further to enlighten the reader about the pellets and their<br>
methods of manufacture claimed in this specification; additional variations within<br>
the concept of the invention will be clear to the pharmaceutical scientist ordinarily<br>
skilled in the art and such a preparation shall also be embodiment of invention<br>
claimed in this specification.<br>
Further, mention of singular is also construed to include pleural, unless the<br>
context does not permit so. Thus,  "a method of pelletization" includes "one or<br>
more methods of pelletization". Mention of "an extract" includes one or more than<br>
one extract. Mention of a generic word is construed to include all members of its<br>
own kind, singly or in combination which can perform the claimed function in the<br>
alternative. Thus "a solventincludes mention of all solvents, individually as well<br>
a collectively which can be used in the alternative to serve the same function as<br>
described.<br>
"Non-pareil seeds" mentioned in the examples are inert beads as mentioned<br>
above, which are easily available in market and are commonly known in<br>
production of Pharmaceutical dosage forms based on pelletization.<br>
