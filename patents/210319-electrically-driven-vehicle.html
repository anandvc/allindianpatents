[Title of the Invention] ELECTRICALLY-DRIVEN VEHICLE<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
The present invention relates to an electrically-driven vehicle, and more particularly to an electrically-driven vehicle having the structure which is capable of accommodating a battery of large capacitance. [Background Art]<br>
Recently, an electrically-driven vehicle which is driven by an electrically-driven motor has been used. As a power source of the electrically-driven vehicle, a battery is mounted on the electrically-driven vehicle. For example, in JP-A-2003-127941, there is disclosed an electrically-driven two-wheeled vehicle which includes the battery mounting structure which can enhance the replacing manipulability of the battery with respect to a vehicle body and does not impede the getting on and off of occupants. In this electrically-driven two-wheeled vehicle, as shown in Fig. 3, frames 100 which are arranged on left and right sides of the vehicle body include raised portions 101 which extend vertically in the vicinity of the center in the vehicle-body longitudinal direction and horizontal portions 102 which extend substantially horizontally rearwardly from the raised<br>
portions, wherein a stay 103 is projected frontwardly from the vicinity of a portion between the raised portions 101 and the horizontal portions 102. Further, a front portion of a seat 104 is rotatably mounted on a front end of the stay 103 . Further, a battery casing 105 is mounted on the raised portions 101. In a state that the seat 104 is raised (the position shown in the drawing) , an upper portion of the battery case 105 is opened and hence, it is possible to put a battery 106 into or take out the battery 106 from the battery casing 105 in the longitudinal direction, that is, in the direction indicated by an arrow 107. In this manner, the battery 106 is held and accommodated in the battery casing 105 between the raised portions 101 of the frames 100 which are arranged on left and right sides of the battery 106.<br>
[Patent Document 1] JP-A-2003-127941 [Disclosure of the Invention] [Problems that the Invention is to Solve]<br>
For example, a vehicle having a large weight such as a large-sized scooter, for example, requires a large battery capacitance. However, when a single battery is used, the battery becomes large-sized and hence, the arrangement position of the battery on the vehicle body is limited. Accordingly, here considered is a case in which a plurality of small-sized batteries are provided so as to increase the<br>
degree of freedom of the layout while ensuring the large capacitance.<br>
[-0004]<br>
The application of the battery arrangement structure disclosed in the above-mentioned publication to the large-sized scooter is considered. However, the conventional battery mounting structure, that is, the structure which mounts the battery in a state that the longitudinal direction of the battery is directed in the vertical direction of the vehicle body is suitable for a two-wheeled vehicle having a relatively small and light-weighted vehicle body which can be driven with a single battery. Accordingly, with respect to the large-sized scooter or the like which requires a plurality of batteries, there exists a demand for the further improvement of the efficiency of layout of the battery arrangement structure.<br>
[-&amp;CU15-P<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide, with respect to a vehicle such as a large-sized scooter which requires a battery of large capacitance, an electrically-driven vehicle which can efficiently arrange a plurality of batteries by considering the structure of a vehicle body by taking the structure of the vehicle body into consideration. [Means for Solving the Problems]To achieve the above-mentioned object, according to the first feature of the invention, in an electrically-driven vehicle including a vehicle body frame which is constituted of a pair of left and right members which extend in the vehicle-body longitudinal direction, a motor which drives a vehicle body, and batteries which supply an electric power to the motor, a plurality of batteries are arranged in the vehicle-body longitudinal direction in a space defined between the left and right members of the vehicle body frame, and the batteries are replaceably mounted on the vehicle body frame in the direction which vertically traverses the extending direction of the members of the vehicle body frame.<br>
Further, the second feature of the invention lies in that the vehicle body frame is formed in an approximately U-shape in a state that the vehicle body frame is high at a front portion and a rear portion thereof and is low at an intermediate portion thereof, and the plurality of batteries are arranged like stairs along a shape of the vehicle body frame.<br>
Further, the third feature of the invention lies in that the electrically-driven vehicle includes a controller which performs an electric power supply control for the motor, and the controller is arranged along the shape of the vehicle body frame together with the plurality of batteries.<br>
Further, the fourth feature of the invention lies in that the electrically-driven vehicle includes a cover member which is arranged above the vehicle body frame and covers an upper portion of the space defined between the left and right members of the vehicle body frame in a state that the cover member is capable of opening and closing the upper portion of the space, the cover member is constituted of an occupant's seat which is constituted of a rider's seat and a pillion which is positioned behind the rider's seat and is positioned higher than the rider's seat, at least two batteries are provided as the batteries and the two batteries are respectively arranged below the rider's seat and the pillion.<br>
Further, the fifth feature of the invention lies in that at least one of the plurality of batteries has a width which differs from widths of other batteries to conform to an unfixed distance between the members of the vehicle body frame.<br>
Further, the sixth feature of the invention lies in that the vehicle body frame includes a narrowed portion where a distance between the members of the vehicle body frame is short at a front portion of a vehicle body, and at least one of the plurality of batteries has a width which differs from widths of other batteries to conform to the narrowed portion of the<br>
vehicle body frame. [Advantage of the Invention]<br>
According to the first to sixth features, it is possible to mount the plurality of batteries by efficiently making use of the space which is elongated in the vehicle-body longitudinal direction and is surrounded by the vehicle body frame and hence, it is possible to ensure a power source of large capacitance in a relatively large electrically-driven vehicle such as a large-sized scooter. Further, since the plurality of batteries can be arranged along and inside the vehicle body frame, it is possible to simplify the appearance of the electrically-driven vehicle. Particularly, according to the second feature, since the batteries are arranged along the shape of the vehicle body frame, even when the vehicle body frame is covered with a cowl, it is sufficient to provide the cowl whose profile substantially follows the vehicle body frame and hence, it is possible to prevent the appearance from being enlarged.<br>
According to the third feature, it is possible to arrange the controller along the vehicle body frame by making use of the space defined between the members of the vehicle body frame.<br>
According to the fourth feature, the arrangement of the<br>
occupant seat having the rider's seat and pillion which are mounted like stairs and the arrangement of the batteries are aligned with each other and hence, the batteries can be more efficiently accommodated.<br>
According to the fifth feature, by making the widths of<br>
respective batteries different from each other with respect<br>
to the narrow space formed by the vehicle body frame, it is<br>
possible to efficiently make use of the space.<br>
According to the sixth feature, in the vehicle adopting the structure which converges the vehicle body frame into a head pipe or the like which supports a steering shaft, it is possible to accommodate the batteries in a portion where the space which is formed by the vehicle body frame becomes narrow. [Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention]<br>
- Hereinafter, the invention is explained in detail in<br><br>
conjunction with drawings.<br>
The present invention relates of a electrically-driven vehicle including a vehicle body frame which is constituted of a pair of left and right members which extend in the vehicle-body longitudinal direction, a motor which drives a vehicle body, and batteries which supply an electric power to the motor, wherein a plurality of batteries are arranged in the vehicle-body longitudinal direction in a space defined between the left and right members of the vehicle body frame, and the batteries are replaceable mounted on the vehicle body frame in the direction which vertically traverses the extending direction of the members of the vehicle body frame.<br>
[Brief Description of the Drawings]<br>
[0030]<br>
[Fig. 1] Fig. 1 is a side view of a motorcycle which constitutes an electrically-driven vehicle according to one embodiment of the invention.<br>
[Fig. 2] Fig. 2 is a plan view showing a vehicle body frame of the motorcycle as the electrically-driven vehicle<br>
according to one embodiment of the invention.<br><br>
[Fig. 3] Fig. 3 is a view showing one embodiment of the battery mounting structure according to a prior art.<br>
Fif. 1 is a side vieu of an<br>
electrically-driven motorcycle which constitutes an electrically-driven vehicle according to one embodiment of the invention and Fig. 2 is a plan view of a vehicle body frame. The motorcycle 1 includes a vehicle body frame 2 and a cowl 3 which is supported on the vehicle body frame 2 and covers the vehicle body frame 2. In Fig. 1, to facilitate the<br>
understanding of the structure of the vehicle body frame 2 and the like, the cowl 3 is shown in a perspective manner and only a schematic profile of the cowl 3 is shown. The vehicle body frame 2 includes a head pipe 21 which is arranged at a front portion of the vehicle in a slightly rearwardly inclined manner, an upper frame 22 which has a front end thereof welded to the head pipe 21 and extends downwardly and rearwardly, a lower frame 23 which has a front end thereof welded to the head pipe<br>
21	below the upper frame 22 and extends rearwardly, and a rear<br>
frame 24 which has a front end thereof bonded to the upper frame<br>
22	and, at the same time, has a rear end of the lower frame<br>
23	bonded to an intermediate portion thereof, and extends<br>
upwardly and rearwardly.<br>
The upper frame 22 and the rear frame 24 which are bonded to each other form a V shape in a side view, while the lower frame 23 forms a U shape in a side view including a rear downward portion and a rear upward portion. That is, the vehicle body frame, as a whole, assumes a shape in which both vehicle-body longitudinal end portions are arranged at a high position and an approximately vehicle-body longitudinal center portion is arranged at a low posit ion (referred to as "an approximately U shape) .<br>
On the other hand, as can be understood from Fig. 2, the<br>
upper frames 22 and the lower frames 23 are bifurcated in the vehicle lateral direction from the head pipe 21 and extend rearwardly. That is, the above-mentioned respective frames 22, 23, 24 are provided in pairs laterally with respect to the vehicle. In a space which is surrounded by these respective lateral pairs of frames 22, 23, 24, batteries 4A, 4B, 4C which supply an electric power to a drive part and a control part of the motorcycle 1 are accommodated. The batteries 4A to 4C are arranged in the vehicle-body longitudinal direction and are arranged like stairs to follow the vehicle body frame 2 having the above-mentioned approximately U shape in a side view. That is, batteries 4A, 4B, 4C are arranged such that the battery 4 A is positioned in the vehicle frontmost portion and the positions of the other batteries are elevated rearwardly in order of the batteries 4B, 4C. That is, the batteries 4A to 4C are arranged along the rear portion (the rear frame 24) of the vehicle body frame 2 which is formed in an approximately U shape.<br>
The battery 4A has a width (a size in the vehicle widthwise direction) thereof set smaller compared to widths of the batteries 4B, 4C for allowing the battery 4A to be accommodated in the inside of the vehicle body frame 2 in conformity with the shape of the vehicle body frame 2 which is narrowed in the vicinity of the head pipe 21, that is, in the front portion of the vehicle body. Since the capacitance of the battery substantially corresponds to the size of the battery, it is possible to narrow the width of the battery 4A by reducing the capacitance of the battery 4A smaller than the capacitances of other batteries 4B, 4C<br>
The lower frames 23 and the rear frames 24 are provided with cross members or pans (not shown the drawings) which respectively hold the batteries 4A, 4B and 4C and the batteries 4A, 4B and 4C are mounted on these cross members or the pans.<br>
Above the rear frames 24, an occupant seat 5 which also functions as a cover member is provided in a state that the occupant seat 5 covers the batteries 4B, 4C. The occupant seat 5 is constituted of a rider's seat and a pillion which is arranged behind the rider's seat and is positioned higher than the rider's seat. Then, the occupant seat 5 has a front end portion thereof pivotally mounted on the vehicle body using the hinge structure such that the occupant seat 5 can be opened and closed in the direction indicated by an arrow 6 .<br>
A steering shaft 7 is inserted into the head pipe 21 , a handle 8 is connected to an upper end of the steering shaft 7, and a front fork 9 is connected to a lower end of the steering shaft 7. The front fork 9 supports a front wheel FW.<br>
A power unit 10 which constitutes a drive part of the motorcycle 1 is pivotally supported on the lower frames 23 by shaft 18a, 18b. The power unit 10 includes an electrically operated motor 11 on a front portion thereof and a reduction gear 12 on a rear portion thereof. An output shaft of the reduction gear 12 which is not shown in the drawing is connected with a rear wheel RW. The shaft 12 of the motor 11 and an input shaft of the reduction gear 12 are connected with each other by a belt 13 such that the power can be transmitted. Below the motor 11 which is arranged on a front portion of the power unit 10, a drive part which is constituted of a driver circuit 14 for driving the motor 11 and a capacitor 15 is accommodated. A rear suspension device 16 which has a buffer device is provided between a rear portion of the power unit 10 and the rear frame 24. The similar rear suspension device is provided also on the right side of the vehicle body.<br>
In front of the power unit 10, between the pair of left and right lower frames 23, a controller (control part) 17 of the drive part which supplies an electric power to the motor 11 is provided. The controller 17 has an appearance thereof configured in an elongated shape in a side view and the longitudinal direction of the controller 17 is arranged along rear portions of the lower frames 23, that is, along portions<br>
of the lower frames 23 which are arranged close to rear portion of the vehicle body and are raised obliquely and rearwardly toward the rear frames 24.<br>
In the above-mentioned constitution, when the batteries 4A, 4B and 4C are removed from the motorcycle 1 for charging or the like, portions above the batteries 4B, 4C are released by opening the occupant seat 5 and the batteries 4A to 4C are taken out through the released portion. First of all, either one of the batteries 4B, 4C is lifted upwardly and taken out. Another one of the batteries 4B, 4C is taken out in the same manner. Subsequently, since a space is defined by taking out the batteries 4B, 4C, it is possible to take out the battery 4A by lifting the battery 4A upwardly while pulling the battery 4A rearwardly through the space. Here, the battery 4A which is arranged in the foremost position may be removed through a door 19 which can be mounted between the occupant seat 5 and the head pipe 21 and above the cowl.<br>
In the above-mentioned manner, by arranging the batteries in parallel in the vehicle-body longitudinal direction along the vehicle body frame 2, it is no more necessary to project small support members such as stays from the vehicle body frame. That is, the plurality of batteries can be supported on the main members of the vehicle body frame<br><br>
and hence, the vehicle body frame can be simplified and 1 ight-weighted .<br>
Here, in this embodiment, among the plurality of batteries, only the battery 4A which is arranged in the front portion of the vehicle body has a width thereof made small. However, the invention is not limited to such a constitution. For example, the sizes of all batteries 4A, 4B and 4C may be made different from each other corresponding to a shape in the vehicle widthwise direction of the vehicle body frame 1.<br>
Further, the invention is not limited to the use of batteries 4A, 4B and 4C which differ in size and capacitance from each other. For example, by modifying the arrangement, it is possible to use the same batteries for the batteries 4A, 4B and 4C. For example, the battery 4A which is arranged in the front portion of the vehicle body may be arranged in the vertical direction and the batteries 4B, 4C may be arranged in the lateral direction thus substantially making the width of the battery 4A smaller than the width of the other batteries 4B, 4C. Due to such an arrangement, while using the same batteries for the batteries 4A, 4B and 4C, the batteries can conform to the shape of the vehicle body frame 2. By allowing the plurality of batteries to have the same size, a charger for charging these batteries can be used in common and<br><br>
cumbersome time and efforts for controlling the plurality of batteries which differ in size becomes unnecessary whereby it is possible to expect a cost reduction effect. [Description of the Reference Numerals and Signs] [0031]<br>
