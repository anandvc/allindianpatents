The present Invention relates to new compounds of formula (I) appearing<br>
hereinafter, their process of preparation, the pharmaceutical compositions<br>
containing them, and their use as nootropic, neuroprotective, analgesic and<br>
anti-hyperalgesic agents.<br>
State of the art<br>
Compounds that possess nootropic activity are already known in the literature.<br>
In   particular,   the   derivatives   substituted   in   position   4   of   2-oxo-1-<br>
pyrroiidineacetamide are valid psychotropic agents that re-establish damaged<br>
cognitive functions. These compounds are described, for example, In Pharm.<br>
Res. Commun. 16, 67, 1984 by Banfi et al. and In Drug Development Res. 2,<br>
447,1982byltiletal.<br>
Amongst the most widely known molecules belonging to the class mentioned<br>
above there may be cited: 2-oxo-1-pyrrolidineacetamide (piracetam), 4-hydroxy-<br>
2-oxo-1-pyrroIidineacetamide (oxiracetam), 2-(2-oxopyrrolidin-1-yl) butyramide<br>
(levetiracetam)      and      W-(2,5-dimethylphenyl)-2-oxo-1-pyrrolidineacetamide<br>
(nefiracetam).<br>
Another chemical class that possesses nootropic activity is represented by<br>
Imidazolic   condensed   derivatives,   in   particular   2,5-dIoxohexahydro-1H-<br>
pyn-olo[1,2-a]imida2ole (dimiracetam), described in EP 335483 and in WO-<br>
9309120, and in J. Med. Chem., 36,4214,1993 by Pinza M. et al.<br>
Recently,  it has  been demonstrated that nefiracetam  could  be  a good<br>
therapeutic agent in the treatment of neuropathic pain. The anti-hyperalgesic<br>
action induced by nefiracetam appears to be of non-oploid nature and is<br>
probably due to the stimulation of the nicotinic cholinergic system at a spinal<br>
and supersplnal level (Rashid Harunor M.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther, 303, 226,<br>
2002).<br>
EP 0174136 discloses compounds of the formula below.<br><br>
As evident, the imidazole ring has a completely different pattern of substituition, lacking inter alia the A substituent in position 1, typical of the present invention.<br>
EP 0335483, Mario pinza et. al. J. of Medicinal chemistry vol. 36 No.6, 1993 pages 4214 to 4220 and WO 9309120 disclose compounds of the formula below,<br><br>
wherein none of the meanings of Rl (= hydrogen, unsubstituted alkyl, alkylaminocarbonylalkyl, alkoxycarbonylalkyl) anticipates the substituent "A", typical of the present invention.<br>

the  pharmaceutical  compositions  containing  them  and  their  use  for the<br>
preparation of medicaments with nootropic and neuroprotective action, with<br>
analgesic and/or anti-hyperalgesic action, and anti-emetic action, constitute a<br>

It will be noted that some compounds of formula (I) can contain one or more<br>
stereogenic centres. The present invention extends to all Vne optical isomers of<br>
tliese compounds in their forms entirely or partially resolved and in the form of<br>
racemic mixtures.<br>
A further subject of the invention is a process for the preparation of the<br>
compounds of formula (I), or one of their salts, and/or one of their solvates,<br>
comprising the reaction of a compound of formula (11)<br><br><br>
with a compound of formula (ill) A-X<br>
(111) in which A, R1, R2, R3. R4 and n are defined as above for the compounds of formula (I), and X is a halogen atom, chosen preferably between bromine and iodine.<br>
When A is a aromatic carbocydic group or a heterocyclic aromatic group as above defined, the reaction between the compounds of fomrjula (II) and the compound of formula (III) can be conducted according to the appropriate conditions of the Goldberg reaction {Angew. Chem. Int. E., 39, 4492, 2000). In particular, the compounds of formula (II) are dissolved in a suitable solvent, such as A/-methylpyrrolldone, together with the compounds of formula (III) in the presence of a catalytic amount of copper salt such as copper iodide, and a base such as potassium carbonate, at any temperature that will yield an adequate percentage of fonmation of the product required, suitably at a high temperature, such as a temperature of between 60'C and 140C, for example at 120'C. The reaction mixture is heated using a system of conventional heating or a microwave reactor of adequate power, for example comprised between 25 and 250 W {Tetrahedron Letters, 43,1101,2002).<br>
When A is arylC1alkyl, the reaction can be carried out in a suitable solvent such as acetonitrile, methylene chloride, acetone, in the presence of a suitable base such as triethyiamine, potassium carbonate, 2-ferf-Butyllmino-2-diethylamino-1,3-dimethylperhydro-1,3,2-diazaphosphorine (also known as BEMP), N,N-OiisopropylethylamJne (also known as Hunig base), at a suitable temperature such as reflux temperature (60-140°C, preferably 100°C).<br><br>
The aforesaid compounds of formula (II) and the methods for their preparation are described in the European patent application EP-A-335483 and in the International patent application No. WO-A-93/09120 and in J.Med.Chem., 36, 4214,1993, by PInza et al.<br>
The compounds of formula (ill) are commercially available or can be prepared from i^nown compounds by known methods.<br>
Altematively, the compounds of formula (I) can be prepared with a process comprising the following stages: i) reaction of an aminoacid of formula (IV) or of one of its activated derivatives<br><br>
In which Ri, Rj and A are as defined above for the compound of formula (I), and P is H or a suitable protective group. The activation of aminoacids is a well-known synthetic procedure; examples of activated derivatives of the aminoacids are mixed anhydrides, acyl chlorides and activated esters, ii) reaction of the compound of formula (VI) obtained at stage i) with a compound of formula (VII)<br><br><br>
(VIII) in which A, Ri, R2, R3, R4 and n are as defined above for the compound of formula (I), P Is defined as above, and R' is an alkyl group; lit) possible removal of the protective group P by means of hydrogenolysis of the compound of formula (VIII), obtained in stage ii), to obtain the corresponding compound (VIII), in which P is H; and<br>
iv) cyciization of the compound of formula (VIII), in which P is H coming from stage Ii) or from stage ill), to obtain the desired compound of formula (I). According to a prefenred embodiment of the invention, the all(yl residue R' is chosen between methyl and tert-bulyl, and P Is chosen between hydrogen, a benzyl or a benzyloxycarbonyf group.<br>
The reaction in stage i) between the compound of formula (IV) and the compound of formula (V) can be performed:<br>
(a) by preparing, In the first place, an acidic chloride of the compound of formula (IV) and uniting to said acidic chloride the compound of formula (V) in th9 presence of an inorganic or organic base In an adequate aprotic solvent, such<br>
10<br><br>
as dimethylformamlde (DMF) at a temperature of between -70°C and 50°C, and preferably between -10'C and 20°C; or else:<br>
(b) by reacting together the connpound of formula (IV) with the compound of formula (V) in the presence of a suitable condensating agent, such as N.N'-carbonyl diimidazole (CD!) or a carbodiimmide such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimmlde (DCC) or W-dlmethylamlnopropyl-A/-ethylcarbodilmmide, preferably in the presence of A/-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBT) to maximize the yield and prevent the processes of racemization (cf. Synthesis, 453, 1972), or 0-benzotriazol-1-yl-N,A/,W,A/-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU), in an aprotic solvent, such as a mixture of acetonitrile (MeCN) and tetrahydrofuran (THF), for example, a mixture with volumetric ratio comprised between 1:9 and 7:3 (MeCNiTHF), at any temperature capable of yielding an adequate percentage of formation of the product required, such as a temperature of between -70°C and 50°C, and preferably between -10°C and 25°C.<br>
At stage ii) of the present process, the compounds of formula (VI) and (VII) are preferably refiux-heated in a protic solvent, such as water or methanol, and possibly in the presence of a base, such as NaOH, In the case where the compound of formula (VI) is used in the fomn of one of its salts obtained by addition of acid, for an adequate period of time, preferably comprised between 2 and 24 hours.<br>
Removal of the protective group P by means of hydrogenolysis at stage iii) is preferably conducted using ammonium fomntate as a source of hydrogen in a suitable protic solvent, such as methanol or a methanoi-water mixture. The cyclizatlon reaction in stage iv) is carried out directly on the compound of formula (VIII) coming from stage II) if P is H, or else, if in said compound (Vlli) P is a protective group, the first step is to remove It, as described above in stage iii).<br>
The cyclizatlon reaction is conducted in drastic conditions by conventionally heating the compound of formula (VIII) without solvent at 120'C and in vacuum conditions, or else by means of reflux-heating in xylene for a suitable period of time, for example between 4 hours and 3 days, or by microwave irradiation.<br>
11<br><br>
The compounds of formula (IV), (V) and (Vil) are commercially available compounds or can be prepared from known compounds using known methods. In particular, the compounds of formula (iV) can be conveniently selected from any naturally occurring aminoacids or derivatives thereof. Examples of aminoacids useful in the present Invention are shown in figure 1, where the part encircled corresponds to the substituent R1 of formula (IV): accordingly, all these meanings for R1 are also preferred in formula (I), being the object of the present invention.<br>
The present compounds of fomriula (I) are useful as therapeutic agents and in particular possess a nootropic and neuroprotective activity, i.e., they contribute to restoring the learning and memory functions deteriorated in the process of ageing or on account of ischaemic traumas, and are effective in various pathologies of the CNS, amongst which learning dysfunctions, dysfunctions of the cognitive sphere and of the memory, Alzheimer's disease, dementias, including senile dementia of the Alzheimer type, post stroke vascular type dementia, epilepsy, cerebral ischaemla, and mood disorders, including depression.<br>
The present compounds of formula (I) moreover possess analgesic and/or anti-hyperalgesic activity, i.e., they contribute to combat the sensations of pain, in particular those caused by conditions of neuropathic pain, chronic inflammatory pain and visceral pain, and have proven their efficacy also in the treatment of emesis.<br>
The subject of the present Invention is lience also the use of the present compounds of fomnula (I) or of their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and/or solvates for the preparation of medicaments for recovery of difficulties of learning and memory and for treatment of dementias, Alzheimer's disease, post stroke vascular type dementia, epilepsy, cerebral ischaemla, and mood disorders, including depression.<br>
Also provided is a method to treat the aforesaid diseases and disorders characterised by administering a pharmaceutically active anrKSunt of a compound of formula (I) to a patient in need thereof.<br>
It is widely known that cognitive disorders that occur in said pathologies are correlated to the deficit of the cerebral cholinergic system, as emerges from<br><br>
morphological findings (B.E. Tomilnson in "Biochemistry of Dementias"; P.J. Roberts Ed.; John Wiley &amp; Sons, New Yori

The subject of the present invention is, nwreover, the use of the present compounds of formula (I) or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts or solvates in the treatment of conditions of neuropathic pain, chronic inflammatory pain and visceral pain. Also provided Is a method to treat the aforesaid diseases characterised by administering a pharmaceutically active amount of a compound of formula (I) to a patient in need thereof.<br>
It is hypothesized that the process of learning and memory is Implicated in the mechanisms of chronic pain (Flor H., Prog. Brain Res., 129, 313, 2000), and recent evidence supports the hypothesis that chronic inflammatory pain is an acquired maladaptive phenomenon (Amstein P.M., J. Neurosci Nurs. 29, 179, 1997; Kumazava T., Neurosci. Res., 32, 9, 1998). Cognitive dysfunction has been described in various neuropathic conditions (Kuhajda M.C., Ann. Behav. Med., 20, 31. 1998), and it has recently been observed that nefiracetam, a nootropic agent, alleviates neuropathic pain thanks to its specific effects on neuropathies (Rashid HanjnorM.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 303, 226, 2002). It has been shown that the analgesic and/or antl-hyperaigesic effect of nefiracetam expresses itself through stimulation of the nicotinic cholinergic receptors at the spinal and supraspinal level, in so far as said effect is inhibited<br><br>
In a dose-dependent way by mecamylamine, a known antagonist of the nicotinic acetylC1line receptor.<br>
The activity of the compounds of formula (1) can be determined in mice by means of tl^ thermal-hyperalgesia test (paw-withdrawal test) and the mechanical-hyperaigesia test (paw-pressure test) induced by partial ligation of the sciatic nerve or by treatment with streptozotocine, following the protocols described in J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 303, 226, 2002 and in the bibliography cited therein.<br>
When used in the therapeutic treatment of humans and animals, the compounds of formula (I) are nomnaily formulated, in compliance with standard pharmaceutical practice, as a pharmaceutical composition, l-lence, a further subject of the invention is represented by a pharmaceutical composition comprising, as active principle, a compound of formula (i) or one of its pharmaceutically acceptable salts or solvates, together with vectors, diluents and pharmaceutically acceptable excipients suitable for the chosen form of administration.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) can be administered in a standard way in the treatment of the disorders Indicated above, for example via oral, parenteral, rectal, transdermal route or by administration through the mucosa (for example, the sublingual, buccal, or nasal mucosa).<br>
The compounds of formula (I) which are administered orally or via sublingual route or via buccal administration, can be formulated as syrups, tablets, capsules, and lozenges. A formulation In the form of syrup consists generally of a suspension or solution of the compound or of one of its salts in a liquid vector, for example ethanol, glycerine or water with a flavouring or colouring agent. When the composition is in the fomrt of tablets. It is possible to use any pharmaceutical vector used conventionally in the preparation of solid foonulations. Examples of said vectors comprise magnesium stereate, starch, lactose and sucrose. When the composition is in the form of capsules, any conventional method of encapsulation is suitable, for example using the vectors mentioned above in a capsule of hard gelatine. When the composition is in the form of capsules made of soft gelatine, it is possible to use any pharmaceutical vector used conventionally in the preparation of dispersions or suspensions, for<br><br>
example aqueous gums, cellulose, silicates or oils, to be incorporated into a shell made of soft gelatine.<br>
Typical parenteral compositions consist of a solution or suspension of the compound of fomnula (i) In a aqueous or non-aqueous sterile vector, possibly containing an oil acceptable for the parenteral route, for example polyethyiene-giycol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, lecithin, peanut oil, or sesame oil. The typical formulation in suppositories comprises a compound of formula (t), which is active if administered in this way, with a binding and/or lubricating agent, for example polymeric glycols, gelatine, cocoa butter, or other low-melting waxes or vegetable fats.<br>
Typical transdermal formulations comprise a conventional aqueous or non¬aqueous vector, for example cream, ointment; lotion or paste, or can be in the form of medicated plasters, patches or membranes.<br>
Preferably, the composition Is in a unit-dose forni, for example tablete or capsules, so that the patient can take a single dose.<br>
Oxyracetam Is a compound used in ^e treatment of senile dementia and of pathological conditions correlated thereto. The compounds of formula (I) can be administered with regimes similar to the ones established for oxyracetam with any appropriate adjustment of the levels of dosage or of the frequency of dosage in relation to the greater activity and to the better pharmacological profile of the compounds of formula (I).<br>

Pharmacological Methods<br>
Chronic constriction Injury model<br>
A peripheral mononeuropathy was produced in adult rats by placing loosely constrictive ligatures around the common sciatic nerve according to the method described by Bennett &amp; Xie (Pain 1988, 33, 87-107).<br>
Rats were anesthetized with chloral hydrate. The common sciatic nerve was exposed at the level of the middle of the thigh by blunt dissection through biceps femoris. Proxlnnal to sciatica's trifurcation, about 1 cm of the nerve was freed of adhering tissue and four ligatures (3/0 silk tread) were tied loosely around it with about 1 mm spacing. The length of the nerve thus affected was 1 cm long. Great care was taken to tie the ligatures such that the diameter of the nerve was seen to be just barely constricted when viewed with 40 x magnification. The left paw was untouched.<br>
Paw pressure test<br>
The nociceptive threshold in the rat was determined with an analgesimeter (Ugo Basile, Varese, Italy), according to the method described by Leighton ef at. {Br. J. Pharmacol. 1988, 93, 553-560). Rats scoring below 40 g or over 75 g during the test before drug administration (25%) were rejected. An arbitrary cut-off value of 250 g was adopted.<br>
All experiment were perfonmed on rats submitted to paw-pressure test 14 days after the operation since at this time a significantly reduction of the pain threshold of the injured paw (dx) was observed.<br>
Gabapentin (30µg i.c.v.), levetiracetam (300 µg i.c.v.), dimiracetam (100)µg i.c.v.), Example 1 (10 µg i.c.v.). Example 2 (10 µg I.e.v.), Example 5 (3 µg i.c.v.), Example 6 (3 µg i.c.v.), Example 13 (30 µg i.c.v.) and Example 22 (30 µ.g i.cv.) of the present invention showed an antihyperalgic effect when compared with saline or vehicle treated group. All componds did not modify pain threshold in controlateral, non operated, paw. It should be noted that all compounds elicited their antihyperalgic effect without changing animals' gross behavior and spontaneous<br><br>
motility in comparison with saline/vehicle treated rats. Furthermore no modification of motor coordination was revealed by the rat rota-rod test (Vaught J. et al. Neuropharmacology 188S, 24,211-216).<br><br><br>
