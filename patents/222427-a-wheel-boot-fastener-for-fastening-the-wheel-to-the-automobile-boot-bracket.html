				<td>This Invention relates to a Wheel Boot Fastener for fastening the Wheel to the Automobile Boot Bracket<br>
2.   FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
Car Wheel Fasteners are devices for fastening the wheel securely in the Car Boot. Here five of the best constructions out of several other possibilities are being described for the Complete Specification. These Car Wheel Fasteners have the advantage that the Air filling nozzle of the wheel is on the top and that air can be filled quite easily without opening and turning the wheel upside down. At the same time fastening the wheel more securely from the central hole (not from one of the radial holes) thereby holding the wheel fast and with much greater strength. Also several Wheel Fasteners have been combined into a single - One For All Wheel Fastener.<br>
3. BACKGROUND OF INVENTION WITH REGARD TO THE DRAWBACK ASSOCIATED WITH THE KNOWN ART<br>
People are acquainted with the drawbacks associated with the present Wheel Fasteners used for fastening the wheels in the Boot of some of the Cars. These Car Wheel Fasteners presently being used have their drawbacks. One of the main drawbacks is that the present wheel fastener fastens the wheel with the air nozzle being underneath the wheel making it impossible to fill air in the Wheel in that position. This invention and Patent application for a better and more etfective wheel fastener which overcomes these drawbacks, is described here later on in the Detailed Description. With regard to the drawbacks associated with the known art, i.e. the:-<br>
Prior Art.<br>
A.	See figure I. One of the prior Art as shown is that the Wheel 1 is fastened from one of the<br>
four (or more) radial holes by a Butterfly Screw a3 in which case the Air Nozzle 2 is on top<br>
and one can fill air without unscrewing the Butterfly Screw a3. This is possible by having a<br>
small hole cut in the board covering the wheel above the air nozzle. This is very convenient<br>
but has the disadvantage as the fastening not being from the Central Hole x (but from one of<br>
the radial holes) the wheel would swing from a to b about the vertical axis V A and hence is<br>
not so securely fastened.<br>
B.	See figure II.      Here the wheel has been turned upside down and fastened from the central<br>
hole x so the wheel can move from a to b about vertical axis V A which means the rotation<br>
can be   firmly clamped by the central fastening Screw Cap 3a. As   such  this   fastening<br>
arrangement is firmer and stronger than as in figure I and is therefore preferred. This<br>
arrangement has however its own disadvantage. Although the wheel is more firmly fastened,<br>
its Air Nozzle 2 goes underneath and thereby causes the inconvenience of filling air in the<br>
wheel. Filling of air is only possible by opening the Screw Cap 3a, turning the wheel upside<br>
up, filling the air and turning the wheel once again upside down where by the air nozzle goes<br>
underneath the wheel and then fastening the wheel. In order to over come these drawbacks as<br>
in figure I and II this invention and patent has become necessary.   The invention makes it<br>
possible to change over from the<br><br>
existing wheel fastening arrangement in the Esteem, Santro, Baleno, Accent, Honda and Uno and some other Cars to this newly invented system of the wheel fastener or the One For All Wheel Fastener.<br>
4   OBJECT OF INVENTiQN.<br>
The main object of the Invention is to provide a robust fastening device for the car wheel in the Boot which also permits easy filling of the air without having to unscrew and turn the wheel upside up and then after filling air in the tyre again turning it upside down and then once again re-screwing it back in the boot bracket. As shown in Figure III here the Wheel is upside up as in figure 1 with the Air Nozzle 2 on top. The difference is that the wheel is fastened from the Central Hole x (not from the radial holes). The wheel is prevented 10 swing from a to b about the vertical axis V A by the wheel fastener 3 which goes through the Central Hole x. As such the fastening is much firmer and strong because the radial distance "r" is shorter and therefore, the turning moment is also smaller then in the case of Figure I. There are 5 different constructions of the wheel fasteners described in the complete Specification as in the detailed Description of the wheel fasteners given below. Another object is to show how this device works and still another object is to show the construction of these wheel fasteners.<br>
Statement Of The Invention :<br>
A Wheel Boot Fastener 3 for fastening the Wheel to the Automobile Boot Bracket from the central hole X such that air is filled in the stepny wheel without opening and turning the wheel upside down, which comprises an Outer Steel Pipe 23 which has a slot at its top end and into this slot enters a Cross Plate 22 and is fastened to it by the help of the Screw Nut, Washer Assembly 24, the Cross Plate 22 is inside the Top Ring 20; and the top rim of the Top Ring 20, a large size Steel Washer 21 and the Cross Plate 22 all three are welded together, under Steel washer 21 there is a Rubber Damping Washer 2la and in the Outer Steel Pipe 23 there is another Inner Steel Pipe 31; the lower end of which has a Steel Nut 32 welded into it and this Steel Nut 32 receives a Steel Screw 33 the lower end of the Inner Steel Pipe 31 , Steel Nut 32 and the Steel Screw 33 are drilled and fastened together by Screw Nut Washer Assembly 34; and Rubber Damper 35 is fitted in the lower end of Inner Steel Pipe 31, Steel Washer 21 and Rubber Damping Washer 2la clamps the wheel firmly from its Central Hole x of the wheel when the Steel Screw 33 of the wheel Fastner is screwed into the boot bracket; the Cross Plate 22 projects a little below the Top Ring 20 for better handling and obtaining necessary play between the Outer Steel Pipe 23 and the Cross Plate 22 the Cross Plate 22 also projects sufficiently above the Top Ring 20 and Steel Washer 21 to provide for a good handle for screwing and unscrewing the Wheel Fastener; the Inner Steel Pipe 31 has adjustment holes 27, 28, 29 &amp; 30 in it and these holes are brought and aligned with the hole 26 in the Outer Steel Pipe 23 and then the Inside and the Outside Pipes can be screwed together by Screw Nut Washer Assembly 25, there by various length adjustments can be achieved by matching each of the 4 holes i.e. 27, 28 29 &amp; 30 in the Inner Steel Pipe 31 by aligning and screwing these holes respectively with the single hole 26 in the Outer<br>
Steel Pipe 23 thereby the length of the Wheel Fastner can be adjusted in to different wheel boot fastening sizes, the Top Ring 20 has an outside diameter which can fit in different sizes of the Central Hole X of the different Wheels.<br>
5. A SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:-<br>
The Wheel in the Boot of the Cars such as the Uno, Santro, Accent, Honda, Baleno, &amp; Esteem are fastened upside down with a caps screw i.e. their air nozzles are underneath the Wheels making it impossible to fill air in them without unscrewing the Wheel and then turning it upside up, filling air and then once again turning it upside down and then re-fastening them with the caps screw. This is very cumbersome and as such the drivers of these above mentioned cars get air filled in the four wheels on which the Car stands (runs / moves) and filling of the air in the Boot wheel is neglected. As such if there is a puncture in one of the running tyres which is to be replaced by the Boot tyre and the Boot tyre is not having sufficient air then the Boot tyre on fitment would get cracked and one looses an expensive tyre. As such this invention provides for a novel device (Wheel Fastener ) i.e. a Wheel fastening system where by the air can be filled in the four standing tyres and the fifth Boot tyre without any great inconvenience as the air nozzle of the Boot tyre is on top enabling air to be filled in it very easily without unscrewing the wheel and turning it upside up and then again upside down and at the same time maintaining the proper air pressure in the Boot tyre at all times. In short filling air in the Boot wheel tyre while it remains fitted in its normal position in the Boot which is very easy and convenient.<br>

7.         DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION WITH REFERENCE TO THE DRAWINGS:-<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides for Wheel Fastener which fastens a Wheel from its Central Hole x of the Wheel to the boot bracket such that the air nozzle of the tyre is on the upper side and pointing upwards enabling easy air filling in the Boot Wheel tyre, the said fasting means comprises of a mean for clamping the rim of the central hole of the Wheel through an extension which fastens the wheel to the wheel boot bracket, the fastening means may be by the arrangement of a screw screwed into a nut.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the extension means may be a solid rod or a hollow cylinder i.e. pipe.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the clamping means may be a channel clamp, a disc attached to a collared pipe, a deep drawn cup with a collar on top, a collared pipe with a cross plate and a pipe having a washer and a cross plate.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the length of the pipe can be<br>
adjusted.<br>
In a further embodiment of the present invention, the pipe length adjustment may comprise of a plurality of concentric pipes capable of sliding relative to one another and a means for<br>
fastening them at predetermined places.<br>
In one more embodiment of the present invention, cushioning effect and damping vibrations may be achieved by fitting of rubber washers.<br>
In one another embodiment of the present invention, the extension means may be connected to the clamping means by conventional mechanisms.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the extension means may be connected to the clamping means by screw - nut - washer and bolts, metal welding riveting, moulding together with synthetic plastic material adhesives etc.<br>
The present invention is described in more detail with respect to the preferred construction of the drawings which are given by way of figures to illustrate them and therefore, should not be construed to limit the scope of the invention in any manner.<br>
Figure I.<br>
Wheel 1 is fastened from one of the four (or more) radial holes by a Butterfly Screw a3 in which case the Air Nozzle 2 is on top and one can fill air without unscrewing the Butterfly Screw a3. This is possible by having a small hole cut in the board covering the wheel above the air nozzle. This is very convenient but has the disadvantage as the fastening not being from the Central Hole x (but from one of the radial holes) the wheel would swing from a to b about the vertical axis V A and hence is not so securely fastened as the turning moment would be greater due to greater radial distance r.<br>
Figure II.<br>
Here the wheel has been turned upside down and fastened from the Central Hole x so the wheel can move from a to b about vertical axis V A which means the rotation can be firmly clamped by the central fastening Screw Cap 3a because the radial distance r is shorter and therefore, the turning moment is also smaller then in the case of Figure I. As such this fastening arrangement is firmer and stronger than as in figure I and is therefore preferred. This arrangement has however its own disadvantage. Although the wheel is more firmly fastened, its Air Nozzle 2 goes underneath and thereby causes the inconvenience of filling air in the wheel. Filling of air is only possible by opening the Screw Cap 3a, turning the wheel upside up, filling the air, putting the wheel back and turning it upside down with the air nozzle going underneath and fastening it once again which is very cumbersome.<br>
Figure III<br>
In order to over come these drawbacks as in figure I and II this Wheel Fastener has been invented and for which this patent is being applied for. The invention permits changing over from the existing wheel fastening arrangement in the Uno, Santro, Accent, Baleno, Honda Esteem and other and to any other Cars which may lend itself to this newly invented Wheel fastening ( Wheel Fastener) system. Here the wheel 1 is upside up as in figure 1 with the Air Nozzle 2 is on top and pointing upwards enabling easy air filling in the tyre of the wheel in the Boot. The difference is that the wheel is fastened from the Central Hole x (not from a radial hole). The wheel is prevented to swing from a to b about the vertical axis V A by the Wheel Fastener 3 which goes through the Central Hole x. As such the fastening is much more secure and strong because the radial distance "r" is shorter and therefore, the turning moment is also smaller then in the case of Figure I. There are 5 different constructions of the wneel fasteners described in the complete Specification as given in the Detailed Description of the wheel fasteners given below.<br>
Figure IV<br>
In the Complete Specification we have the Wheel Fastener as in figure IV. Wheel Fastener according to figure IV is a One For All Wheel Fastener, whereas in the case of Wheel Fastener of figure V &amp; VI we have to have different Wheel Fasteners for the Uno, Santro, Accent, Honda, Esteem, Chevorlet, Baleno and may be, other cars not known to us at the present. Now Wheel Fastener according to figure IV is a One For All Wheel fastener that means it is an adjustable Wheel Fastener which can be adjusted to fasten the Wheels securely in the Boots of the above mentioned Cars except the Baleno. The One For All Wheel Fastener consists of an Outer Steel Pipe 23. The top end of which has a slot, into this slot enters Cross Plate 22 and is fastened to it by the help of the Screw Nut, Washer Assembly 24. The Cross Plate 22 is inside the Top Ring 20 and the top rim of the Top Ring 20, a large size Steel Washer 21 and the Cross Plate 22 are all three welded together. Under Steel washer 21 there is a Rubber Damping Washer 2la. In the Outer Steel Pipe 23 there is another Inner Steel Pipe 31 the lower end of which has a Steel Nut 32 welded into it. This Steel Nut 32 receives a Steel Screw 33. The lower end of the Inner Steel Pipe 31, Steel Nut 32 and the Steel Screw 33 are drilled and fastened together by Screw Nut Washer Assembly 34 and Rubber vibration Damper 35 is fitted in the lower end of Inner Steel Pipe 31. On Top Ring 20 entering the Central Hole x of the Wheel the Steel Washer 21 and Rubber Vibration Damper 21a clamp the top rim of the Central Hole x when the Steel Screw 33 of the wheel<br>
Fastner is screwed into the boot bracket by turning the Cross Plate 22 of the Wheel Fastner and thereby fastening the wheel securely in the Boot Bracket. The Cross Plate 22 projects a little below the Top Ring 20 for better handling and obtaining necessary play between the Outer Steel Pipe 23 and the Cross Plate 22. The Cross Plate 22 also projects sufficiently above the Top Ring 20 and Steel Washer 21 to provide for a good handle for screwing and unscrewing the Wheel Fastener. The Inner Steel Pipe 31 has some adjustment holes 27, 28, 29 &amp; 30 in it. These holes can be brought and aligned with the ole 26 in the Outer Steel Pipe 23 and then the Inside and the Outside Pipes can be screwed together by Screw Nut Washer Assembly 25 there by various length adjustments can be achieved by matching each of the 4 holes i.e. 27, 28 29 &amp; 30 in the Inner Steel Pipe 31 by aligning and screwing these holes respectively with the single hole 26 in the Outer Steel Pipe 23 thereby the length of the Wheel Fastner can be adjusted to be screwed in to different wheel boot fastening sizes as required in the Boots of different cars. The Top Ring 20 has an outside diameter which can fit the Central Hole x in all the Wheels of the above mentioned automobiles. As such, this One For All Wheel Fastener can be used for all these 7 different cars presently in the market. According to this construction other Wheel Fasteners could be developed for any new automobile which may come in the market in the future and is not already covered by the present Wheel Fastener adjustment Range of Figure IV. The possibility of having 3 instead of 2 telescopic tubes sliding into one another may be a solution for any future automobile Boot Wheel Fastener not covered under the present adjustment range of this One For All Wheel Fastener. Here again the large Steel Washer 21 combined with the upper Top Ring 20 and the Cross Plate 22 could be made of strong Plastic Synthetic material such as already in use in Wheel fasteners instead of Steel. However, Screw, Nut, Washer Assemblies 24, 25 and 34 and also Outer Steel Pipe 23, Inner Steel Pipe 31, Nut 32 and Steel Screw 33 &amp; 33a should be made out of Steel. In the case of the Uno, Santro, Accent, Honda the lower Steel Screw 33 screws into the bracket threaded hole. However, in the case of Baleno the lower Steel Screw 33 and the Screw Nut Washer Assembly 34 in the wheel fastener have to be removed as the Baleno car bracket does not have a threaded hole but a screw instead which screws in from underneath into a Nut welded inside the lower end of the wheel fastener Steel Pipe. Also in the case of the Esteem the threaded hole of the Boot bracket is smaller then that of other cars. As such Steel Screw 33 has to be replaced by another Steel Screw 33a which is thinner at its lower end but its top end has the same size and threading to suit Nut 32 and is fastened with Screw Nut Washer Assembly 34 as in the case of Steel Screw 33 except that here the lower end of this screw has been reduced and made into a thinner screw to match the hole and thread in the Esteem boot bracket.<br>
Figure V<br>
Here we have the best and most sophisticated single wheel fastener. Consisting of a Steel Pipe 23. The Top Collared Steel Ring 13 has a Cross Steel Plate 14 welded centrally inside it. The Steel Pipe 23 has a slot cut into it at its top end which fits into the center of the Cross Steel Plate 14. The Steel Pipe 23 and the Cross Steel Plate 14 are fastened together in position by a Steel Screw Washer and Nut Assembly 15. The lower end of the Steel Pipe 23 has a Steel Rod Piece 16 which is a slide fit in the Steel Pipe 23. This Steel Rod Piece 16 has a Steel Screw 17 fixed centrally at its.lower end and welded with it. In order to fix this Steel Rod Piece 16 with the Steel Pipe 23 there is a Steel Screw Washer and Nut Assembly 18. Some amount of play is allowed so that the lower end of the Steel Pipe 23 with the Steel Screw 17 and the Top Collared Steel Ring 13 can align themselves on fitment. This Steel Screw 17 screws into the Car boot bracket and thereby the Top Collared Steel Ring 13 clamps down on the rim of the wheel's Central Hole x holding the wheel firmly in the boot. In order to achieve proper tightening and the damping of vibrations a Rubber Bush 19 is fitted at the lower end of the Steel Rod 16 and which lies between the Steel Pipe 23 and the Steel Screw 17 protruding out a little below the Steel Pipe 23. There is one further advantage of this wheel fastener over the wheel fastener of figure VI when we insert this wheel fastener into the Central Hole x of the Wheel we can easily see the threaded hole below from either side of the Cross Steel Plate 14 and inside the Top Collared Steel Ring 13 and guide the Steel Screw 17 and screw it into the car boot bracket threaded hole quite easily which is not possible in the case of Wheel fastener according to figure VII. The Cross Steel Plate 14 in the collared pipe gives us a very good handle when turned in the clockwise direction the steel screw at the lower end of the Fastner tightens into the threaded hole in the Boot bracket holding the wheel firmly in the car boot. Once again in Figure V the Top Collared Steel Ring 13, Cross Steel Plate 14 and Steel Pipe 23 may be, of strong Plastic Synthetic material such as already in use in Wheel fasteners instead of Steel. However, Screw Nut Washer assemblies 15 &amp; 18 and Steel Rod Piece 16 and Screw 17 should be in Steel<br>
Figure VI<br>
The Wheel Fastner of the Baleno is an exception as instead of a screw at the lower end of its Steel Pipe it has a Nut welded in it. It consist of a Steel Pipe 23 having a Nut 16a welded inside it and at its lower end below the Nut 16a there is a Rubber Damping Bush 19 which is also inside the lower end of Steel Pipe 23. The Rubber Damping Bush 19 protrudes slightly below the lower end of the Steel Pipe 23. The Steel Pipe 23 has a slot at its upper end. A collared Steel Ring 13 having a Steel Plate 14 welded centrally inside it. The Steel Plate 14 enters the slot at the upper end of the Steel Pipe 23 and is fastened centrally together with it by Screw Nut Washer Assembly 15. On inserting the Wheel Fastner from the Top of the Central Hole x of the Wheel the Nut 16a of the Wheel Fastener matches and screws on to the screw which is fixed in the Baleno boot bracket thereby clamping the Wheel rim firmly by the Collar of the Top Collared Steel Ring 13 and thereby the wheel firmly in the boot.<br>
Figure VII<br>
See figure VII. Here again there is a Steel Rod 6, which at the lower end is threaded and can be screwed into the car boot bracket. The top end of this rod is machine turned to a smaller diameter which end enters a hole in a Steel Disc 8. This Steel Disc 8 is welded inside a Collared Steel Pipe 9 and instead of welding these two parts Steel Disc 8 inside the Collared Steel Pipe 9 this may consist of a single deep drawn Steel cup like part having a collar. Above this there is a large Rubber Washer 10 kept in place by another Steel Washer 11, which fits inside the Collared Steel Pipe 9 and is held down in place over the Rubber Washer 10 by the Wire Handle 7. The Wire Handle 7 is fitted into a horizontal hole at the top end of the Steel Rod 6. When this Wire Handle 7 is turned in the clockwise direction the screw at the lower end of the Fastner tightens into the thread of the Boot bracket and the collar of the upper pipe clamps down upon the top rim of the inner hole of the wheel thereby holding the wheel firmly in the car Boot. The Rubber Washer 10 helps in better tightening and damping of vibrations of the wheel. This construction is a little more intricate but is better than that as described in figure VIII. The construction shown in Figure VIII may also have a single and combined collared cup like part out of Steel Disk 8 and Collared Steel Pipe 9 and also the separate disk 11 made out of strong Plastic, Synthetic material such as already in use as in the Wheel Fasteners instead of Steel.<br>
Figure VIII<br>
This is the simplest of the wheel fastener consisting of a Steel Rod 6 with a threaded end at its lower end which screws into the Car Boot Bracket. The top end of the Steel Rod 6 is machine turned to a smaller diameter passes through a hole in a channel above it and is welded to it. When the wheel fastener is inserted into the Central Hole x of the wheel and the lower end of the Steel Rod 6 is screwed into the car Boot bracket the Steel Section 5 engages and grips rim of the Central Hole x of the wheel and fastens the wheel firmly in the Car Boot. This is the simplest and therefore also the cheapest wheel fastener. It may be, preferable to make the Steel Section 5 out of strong Plastic, Synthetic material such as already in use as in the Wheel Fasteners instead of Steel<br><br><br><br>
