				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a mounting structure of a connector for a fuel tank, which is mounted to a wall surface of a fuel tank in a vehicle such as an automotive vehicle, a motor cycle and the like, and electrically connects an electrical equipment arranged within the fuel tank to an external power source disposed outside the fuel tank. DESCRIPTION OF CONVENTIONAL ART<br>
A first example of a conventional mounting structure of a connector for a fuel tank (hereinafter, refer simply to a connector) is shown in Fig. 6.<br>
A sleeve 51 is adhered to a lid body 50 mounted to a wall surface of a fuel tank in accordance with a brazing, this sleeve 51 is arranged so as to protrude upward from an upper surface 5 0A of the lid body 50 by a funnel-like expansion portion 51A, a lower side of the sleeve 51 is protruded downward from a lower surface 50B of the lid body 50, and a tongue piece 51B is provided near a lower end thereof.  A connector 52<br>
1A<br><br>
is formed in an L shape, an outer portion connecting portion 53 and an inner portion connecting portion 54 are formed at both ends of the connector 52, and end portions of a male terminal pin 55 which is insert molded within the connector 52 are arranged so as to protrude into each of the connecting portions 5 3 and 54.<br>
Then, the side of the inner portion connecting portion 54 of the connector 52 is arranged so as to be inserted within the sleeve 51, and the tongue piece 51B of the sleeve 51 is inward caulked to an engagement step portion 52A of the connector 52.<br>
Further, a second example of the mounting structure of the connector is shown in Fig. 7.<br>
A sleeve 61 having an expansion portion 61A in an upper side is adhered to the lid body 50 in accordance with the brazing, the expansion portion 61A is arranged so as to protrude upward from the upper surface 50A of the lid body 50, and a cylindrical lower side is arranged so as to protrude downward from the lower surface 50B of the lid body 50.<br>
A connector 64 is formed by a first insulating body 62 and a second insulating body 63, the first insulating body 62 is provided with a fitly attaching recess portion 64A on an upper end side surface, and the second insulating body 63 is provided with a fitly attaching recess portion 65 downward.<br>
2<br><br>
Then, the first insulating body 62 and the second insulating body 63 are adhered by fitly inserting the first insulating body 62 and the second insulating body 63 into the sleeve 61 and thereafter welding the first insulating body 62 and the second insulating body 63 in accordance with an ultrasonic welding. Accordingly, the connector 64 can be attached to the sleeve 61 by a flange portion 62A of the first insulating body 62 and engagement step portions 63A and 63B of the second insulating body 63.<br>
Fig. 8 shows a third example of the conventional mounting structure of the connector.<br>
A sleeve 70 is adhered to the lid body 50 in accordance with a brazing, an upper expansion portion 7 0 thereof is arranged so as to protrude upward from the upper surface 50A of the lid body 50, and a stepped cylindrical body provided with a large diameter potion 7 OB and a small diameter portion 7 0C connectedly is arranged so as to protrude downward from the lower surface 50B of the lid body 50.<br>
A connector 71 is structured such that an upward expanded plug body portion 71A is provided, an inner portion connecting portion 71D constituted by a large diameter portion 71B and a small diameter portion 71C is formed below the plug body portion 71A, and an outer portion connecting portion 71E extending sideward is<br>
3<br><br>
formed above the plug body portion 71A.<br>
Further, an elastic engagement member 72 provided with a lock portion 7 2A is disposed in a stepped surface 71F of the inner portion connecting portion 71D of the connector 71.<br>
In this case, when the connector 71 is completely inserted into the sleeve 70, the elastic engagement member 72 is returned back outward, and the lock portion 7 2A is fitly inserted into an engagement window 7 0D which is pieced in the small diameter portion 71C of the sleeve 70, whereby the connector 71 can be attached to the sleeve 70.<br>
Paying attention to the conventional sleeves 51, 61 and 70 which are shown in Figs. 6 to 8, the upper portions of the sleeves are arranged so as to protrude upward from the upper surface 50A of the lid body 50 by the expansion portions 51A, 61A and 70A. Accordingly, the outer portion connecting portions 53 and 71E and the fitly attaching recess portion 64A which are open toward the outside are formed at the upper position than the expansion portions 51A, 61A and 70A.<br>
In accordance with the structures mentioned above, a height H of the connector which protrudes upward from the upper surface 50A of the lid body 50 has to be large. Therefore, the following problems are generated.<br>
That is, particularly in the motor cycle or the<br>
4<br><br>
like, since a frame and a collar ring are arranged near a wall surface of the fuel tank, there is a risk that the structures and the connector are interfered with each other, and it is hard to arrange the connector.<br>
On the other hand, in order to solve the problems mentioned above, it is considered that the frame and the collar ring are changed upward, or the wall surface of the fuel tank is changed downward.  However, both of such changes cause a change of a metal mold and an expensive   cost   is   required   for   the   change. Accordingly,  the above means  are not preferable. Among them, the change of the collar ring particularly causes the change in appearance of the motor cycle, and is not preferable in design.<br>
Further, the change of the fuel tank causes a reduction of a tank capacity, and is not preferable.<br>
Further, in order to reduce the height H of the connector, it is considered that the leading end of the male terminal pin 55 protruding out to the outer portion connecting portion 71E is once bent downward and is next bent rightward as shown by a one-dot chain line in Fig. 8, however, it is hard to insert mold the male terminal pin 55.<br>
Next, in view of the mounting of the connector to the sleeve, the following problems are generated.<br>
In the example shown in Fig. 6, it is necessary<br>
5<br><br>
to caulk the tongue piece 5 1B provided in the sleeve 51 toward the engagement step portion 52A of the connector. In accordance with this structure, a equipment for caulking, a space for receiving the equipment for caulking, and a caulking operation are required.<br>
Further, in the example shown in Fig. 7, since the sleeve is constituted by the first insulating body 62 and the second insulating body 63, the number of the parts is increased. Further, since both of the insulating bodies 62 and 63 are welded by the ultrasonic welding, the same problem as that of the example in Fig. 6 is generated.<br>
Further, in the example shown in Fig. 8, it is necessary to prepare a metal elongated pin as the elastic engagement member 72, and an increase of the number of the parts is caused. Accordingly, this structure is not preferable.<br>
Further, in the structures shown in Figs. 6 and 7, since the connector can not be singly taken out after the connector is attached to the sleeve, the sleeve and the lid body are cast away at a time of replacing the connector. Accordingly these structures are not preferable in view of a resource saving.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is made by taking the<br>
6<br><br>
problems mentioned above into consideration, and an object of the present invention is to provide a mounting structure of a connector for a fuel tank which is preferable for being used particularly for a motor cycle by making a protrusion of an outer portion connecting portion of the connector from an upper surface of a lid body as small as possible, to provide a mounting structure of a connector for a fuel tank in which parts are few and the number of man-hour for assembly is small, thereby a cost being inexpensive, and to make it possible to singly replace a connector for a fuel tank.<br>
In order to achieve the object mentioned above, in accordance with a first aspect, the present invention provides a mounting structure of a connector for a fuel tank, in which the connector for the fuel tank comprises:<br>
a tubular portion which is formed in a cylindrical shape and has a seal ring arranged in an outer periphery thereof;<br>
a flange portion which is disposed in an upper end of the tubular portion and has a diameter larger than a diameter of the tubular portion;<br>
a fuel tank side terminal pin receiving recess portion which is formed so as to protrude downward from the tubular portion;<br>
an external power source side terminal pin receiving recess portion which is disposed above the tubular portion and the flange portion and is formed so as to protrude sideward;<br>
an engagement piece portion which is formed in an outer periphery of the fuel tank side terminal pin receiving recess portion, has an engagement portion formed so   as  to  face to a lower end of the tubular-portion, and is elastically<br>
7<br><br>
deformable toward a center direction, there being a gap between said engagement portion and the lower end of said tubular portion;<br>
a male terminal pin in which one end is arranged so as to protrude into the fuel tank side terminal pin receiving recess portion, and another end is arranged so as to protrude into the external power source side terminal pin receiving recess portion,<br>
wherein a sleeve for inserting the tubular portion of said connector is formed in a lid body for closing an opening of the fuel tank in such a manner as to protrude downward from a lower surface of the lid body,<br>
a lower surface of the flange portion in the connector for the fuel tank is arranged so as to be brought into contact with an upper surface of the lid body by inserting the connector for the fuel tank into the sleeve, the tubular portion is supported to the sleeve via a seal ring in an airtight manner, and an engagement portion of the engagement   piece portion of the connector for the fuel tank is arranged so as to<br><br><br>
be brought into contact with the lower end of the sleeve.<br>
Further, in addition to the first aspect, in accordance with a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a mounting structure of a connector for a fuel tank, wherein a pair of regulating portions having a gap in a rotating direction of the connector for the fuel tank is formed on the upper surface of the lid body so as to protrude, and the outer periphery of the external power source side terminal pin receiving recess portion of the connector for the fuel tank is arranged between the regulating portions.<br>
Further, in addition to the first aspect, in accordance with a third aspect of the present invention, there is provided a mounting structure of a connector for a fuel tank, wherein the sleeve is integrally formed with the lid body by a drawing process.<br>
In accordance with the first aspect of the present invention, the external power source side terminal pin receiving portion of the connector for the fuel tank is formed so as to protrude sideward with including the flange port ion formed in the upper end of the tubular portion, and the sleeve protruding downward from the lower surface of the lid body is formed in the lid body.<br>
Accordingly, when inserting the tubular portion including the fuel tank side terminal pin receiving recess portion of the connector for the fuel tank into<br>
9<br><br>
the sleeve of the lid body, the insertion of the connector for the fuel tank into the sleeve is completed in a state in which the lower surface of the flange portion is brought into contact with the upper surface of the lid body, and the position of the connector for the fuel tank is determined. Therefore, it is possible to reduce a height of the external power source side terminal pin receiving recess portion with respect to the upper surface of the lid body (a height of the connector for the fuel tank protruding upward from the upper surface of the lid body).<br>
Further, in a state in which the insertion of the connector for the fuel tank into the sleeve is completed, the engagement portion of the engagement piece portion which is integrally formed with the connector for the fuel tank is elastically returned back and is arranged so as to be brought into contact with the lower end of the sleeve. Accordingly, it is possible to inhibit the connector for the fuel tank from coming off the sleeve.<br>
Further, in accordance with the second aspect of the present invention, even when the rotating force is applied to the connector for the fuel tank from the external, the outer periphery of the external power source side terminal receiving recess portion is brought into contact with the regulating portion in<br>
10<br><br>
the rotating direction. Accordingly, the rotation of the connector for the fuel tank is inhibited. Since the regulating portion is integrally formed with the lid body in this case, the number of the parts and the number of man-hour for assembly are not increased.<br>
In accordance with the third aspect of the present invention, since the sleeve is integrally formed by drawing process of the lid body, the number of the parts and the number of man-hour for assembly are not increased. This integrally forming can be achieved because of the protrusion of the sleeve being in only one direction (downward direction) of the lid body.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
A description will be given below of an embodiment of a connector C for a fuel tank in accordance with the present invention with reference to Figs. 1 and 2. Fig. 1 is a vertical cross sectional view of the connector, and Fig. 2 is a plan view of an upper portion in Fig. 1.<br>
Reference numeral 1 denotes a tubular portion formed in a cylindrical shape. A seal ring groove 1A in an annular shape is carved in an outer periphery of the tubular portion 1.<br>
A flange portion 2 in an annular shape is formed in an upper end 1B of the tubular portion 1, and a diameter<br>
12<br><br>
A of the flange portion 2 is larger than a diameter B of the tubular portion 1,<br>
Further, an external power source side terminal Pin receiving recess portion 3 is formed above the upper end 1B of the tubular portion 1 so as to be directed rightward with including the flange portion 2.  (The external power source side terminal pin receiving recess portion 3 is open rightward.)  In this case, a lower surface 3A of the external power source side terminal pin receiving portion 3 is formed at the same height as that of a lower surface 2A of the flange portion 2 or a little above the lower surface 2A.  This is for the purpose of arranging a whole of the lower surface 2A of the flange portion 2 so as to be brought into contact with an upper surface of a lid body to be mentioned below.<br>
Further, a fuel tank side terminal pin receiving recess portion 4 is formed below the tubular portion 1 so as to be directed downward, the fuel tank side terminal pin receiving recess portion 4 is open downward and an outer surface portion thereof is formed inside the diameter B of the tubular portion 1.<br>
This is for the purpose of inserting the fuel tank side terminal pin receiving recess portion 4 into a sleeve to be mentioned below.<br>
Then, an engagement piece portion 5 having an<br>
13<br><br>
engagement portion 5A is integrally formed in an outer peripheral portion 4A of the fuel tank side terminal pin receiving recess portion 4.<br>
That is, the engagement piece portion 5 is bent in an L shape upward from the outer peripheral portion 4A of the fuel tank side terminal pin receiving recess portion 4, and an engagement portion 5A facing to a lower end 1C of the tubular portion 1 is formed at an upper end thereof.<br>
The engagement portion has a gap S with respect to the lower end 1C of the tubular portion 1. Since the engagement piece portion 5 is supported to the outer peripheral portion 4A only in a base portion, the engagement piece portion 5 is deformed inward from an original position due to an external force application to the engagement portion 5A. On the contrary, when the external force is removed, the engagement piece portion 5 is elastically returned back outward to the original position. Further, the engagement portion 5A is formed so as to slightly protrude outward at a distance D from the tubular portion 1.<br>
It is preferable that a plurality of engagement piece portions 5 are provided in the outer peripheral portion 4A of the fuel tank side terminal pin receiving recess portion 4 uniformly in a circumferential di rect ion.<br>
14<br><br>
Reference numeral 6 denotes a male terminal pin formed in an L shape. One end 6A of the male terminal pin 6 is arranged so as to protrude out into a bottom portion of the external power source side terminal pin receiving recess portion 3, and another end 6B thereof is arranged so as to protrude out into a bottom portion of the fuel tank side terminal pin receiving recess portion 4. This male terminal pin 6 is insert molded at a time of injection molding of the connector C for the fuel tank with a synthetic resin material.<br>
Next, a description will be given of the lid body<br>
7	with reference to Fig. 3.<br>
The lid body 7 is structured such as to close an opening which is provided in the fuel tank (not shown) . A fuel pump, a pressure regulator, a filter, a liquid surface detector and the like which are arranged within the fuel tank are attached to the lid body 7.<br>
(The equipment such as the fuel pump and the like are not illustrated.}<br>
The lid body 7 is formed, for example, in a disc shape and made of a metal sheet material.  A sleeve<br>
8	is integrally formed with the lid body 7.<br>
The sleeve 8 in a circular shape in a horizontal cross section is formed so as to protrude downward from a lower surface 7A of the lid body 7, and a height E of the sleeve 8 is formed small.<br>
15<br><br>
That is, in Fig. 1, paying attention to the tubular portion 1 of the connector C for the fuel tank, a height F of the tubular portion 1 may be the total of a groove width F1 of the seal ring groove 1A, a height F2 of a lower tubular portion which is formed below the seal ring groove 1A, and a height F3 of an upper tubular portion which is formed above the seal ring groove 1A. Accordingly, it is not necessary to increase the height E of the sleeve 8.<br>
For example, the height E of the sleeve 8 may be about 2.5 times the groove width Fl of the seal ring groove 1A.<br>
The sleeve 8 constructed in the manner mentioned above can be easily formed by a drawing process at the same time of press molding of the lid body 7. This is because the height E of the sleeve 8 can be made small as mentioned above.<br>
Next, a description will be given of attaching of the connector C for the fuel tank to the lid body 7 with reference to Figs. 4 and 5.<br>
The lid body 7 is arranged in a state in which the sleeve 8 protrudes downward. In this state, the connector C for the fuel tank in which a seal ring 9 is arranged in the seal ring groove 1A is inserted into the sleeve 8 from the upper surface 7B of the lid body 7 .<br>
16<br><br>
In particular, the fuel tank side terminal pin receiving recess portion 4 is inserted into the sleeve 8 which is open to the upper surface 7B of the lid body 7.  At this time, the engagement portion 5A of the engagement piece portion 5 is compressed inward, and moves downward from the upper side within the sleeve 8 while being elastically deformed.   Further, in a state in which the engagement portion 5A comes out below the lower end 8A of the sleeve 8, the engagement portion 5A expands outward due to an elastic force of the engagement piece portion 5 so as to return back to the original state, and the upper end of the engagement portion 5A is engaged with the lower end 8A of the sleeve 8 .<br>
In such a state, the connector C for the fuel tank is completely inserted into the sleeve 8 . At this time, the tubular portion 1 is arranged within the sleeve 8, and an airtightness between the outer periphery of the tubular portion 1 and the inner periphery of the sleeve 8 is kept by the seal ring 9, and the lower surface 2A of the flange portion 2 is arranged so as to be brought into contact with the upper surface 7B of the lid body 7 .<br>
In accordance with the structure mentioned above, the connector C for the fuel tank is fixedly attached to the lid body 7 by the lower surface 2A of the flange<br>
17<br><br>
portion 2 and the engagement portion 5A. At this time, the fuel tank side terminal pin receiving recess portion 4 is arranged so as to protrude downward from the sleeve 8, and another end 6B of the male terminal pin 6 is also arranged so as to face downward. On the other hand, the external power source side terminal pin receiving recess portion 3 is arranged close to the upper surface 7B of the lid body 7 and is arranged so as to protrude rightward, and one end 6A of the male terminal pin 6 is also arranged so as to face rightward.<br>
Then, a connector provided in a leading end of an electric wire which extends from an electric equipment arranged within the fuel tank is put in another end 6B of the male terminal pin 6, and on the other hand, a connector provided in a leading end of an electric wire which extends from an external power source is put in one end 6A of the male terminal pin 6. Accordingly, the electric equipment within the fuel tank and the external power source are electrically connected via the connector C for the fuel tank.<br>
As mentioned above, in accordance with the connector C for the fuel tank of the present invention, it is possible to make the height H of the external power source side terminal pin receiving recess portion 3 (called as a connector height H) which is positioned on the upper surface 7B of the lid body 7 sufficiently<br>
18<br><br>
small.<br>
This is because the sleeve 8 formed in the lid body 7 is protruded only downward from the lower surface 7 A of the lid body 7 without being protruded upward from the upper surface 7B, and the external power source side terminal pin receiving recess portion 3 is formed so as to include the flange portion 2.<br>
Further, in accordance with the present invention, the connector C for the fuel tank can be easily attached to and detached from the lid body 7. That is, the attaching operation can be performed by inserting the engagement piece portion 5 of the connector C for the fuel tank into the sleeve 8 from the upper surface 7B of the lid body 7 while elastically deforming the engagement piece portion 5, and on the contrary, the detaching operation can be performed by pressing and moving the engagement piece portion 5 upward while pressing and deforming the engagement piece portion 5 inward.<br>
Further, in accordance with the present invention, since the fuel tank side terminal pin receiving recess portion 4 including the engagement piece portion 5, the tubular portion 1, the flange portion 2 and the external power source side terminal pin receiving recess portion 3 are integrally formed by a single material, it is possible to reduce the number of parts<br>
19<br><br>
and the number of man-hour for assembly, and it is possible to provide an inexpensive connector for a fuel tank .<br>
Further, in the lid body 7, the sleeve 8 can be formed by a drawing process at a time of working (for example, pressmolding) the lidbody 7 . This is because the height F of the tubular portion 1 in the fuel connector C can be made small as mentioned above, whereby the height E of the sleeve 8 can be made small.<br>
In accordance with the structure mentioned above, it is possible to reduce a manufacturing cost of the lid body 7 including the sleeve 8.<br>
Further, reference numerals 7C and 7D denote a pair of regulating portions which are formed so as to protrude upward from the upper surface 7B of the lid body 7. The regulating portions 7C and 7D have a gap Y in a rotating direction (denoted by reference symbol X in Fig. 5) of the connector C for the fuel tank.<br>
The outer peripheries 3A and 3B of the external power source side terminal pin receiving recess portion 3 are arranged in the gap Y between the regulating portions 7C and 7D. Accordingly, since the outer peripheries 3A and 3B of the power source side terminal pin receiving recess portion 3 are brought into contact with the regulating portions 7C and 7D even when the rotating force is applied to the connector C for the<br>
20<br><br>
fuel tank from the external, the rotation of the connector C for the fuel tank Is inhibited.<br>
Further, since the regulating portions 7C and 7D are also formed by an embossing process in accordance with a press molding at a time of working the lid body 7, it is possible to inhibit a working cost from being Increased.<br>
As mentioned above, in accordance with the mounting structure of the connector for the fuel tank of the present Invention, the connector for the fuel tank comprises the tubular portion which is formed in a cylindrical shape and has the seal ring arranged in the outer periphery thereof; the flange portion which is disposed in the upper end of the tubular portion and has the diameter larger than the diameter of the tubular portion; the fuel tank side terminal pin receiving recess portion which is formed so as to protrude downward from the tubular portion; the external power source side terminal pin receiving recess portion which is disposed above the tubular portion with including the flange portion and is formed so as to protrude sideward; the engagement piece portion which is formed in the outer periphery of the fuel tank side terminal pin receiving recess portion, has the engagement portion formed so as to face to the lower end  of  the  tubular  portion,  and  is  elastically<br>
21<br><br>
deformable toward the center direction; and the male<br>
terminal pin in which one end is arranged so as to<br>
protrude into the fuel tank side terminal pin receiving<br>
recess portion, and another end is arranged so as to<br>
protrude into the external power source side terminal<br>
pin receiving recess portion, the sleeve for inserting<br>
the tubular portion of the connector is formed in the<br>
lid body for closing the opening of the fuel tank in<br>
such a manner as to protrude downward from the lower<br>
surface of the lid body, the lower surface of the flange<br>
portion in the connector for the fuel tank is arranged<br>
so as to be brought into contact with the upper surface<br>
of the lid body by inserting the connector for the fuel<br>
tank into the sleeve, the tubular portion is supported<br>
to the sleeve via a seal ring in an airtight manner,<br>
and the engagement portion of the engagement piece<br>
portion of the connector for the fuel tank is arranged<br>
so as to be brought into contact with the lower end<br>
of the sleeve.  Accordingly, it is possible to make<br>
the height of the external power source side terminal<br>
pin receiving recess portion protruding out upward from<br>
the lid body as low as possible, whereby it is possible<br>
to prevent an interference with the frame, the collar<br>
ring and the like which are arranged at the upper<br>
position thereof, and the structure is particularly<br>
preferable for the motor cycle.<br>
22<br><br>
Further, in accordance with the engagement piece portion mentioned above, the engagement piece portion is integrally formed with the outer periphery of the fuel tank side terminal pin receiving recess portion constituting the connector for the fuel tank, whereby the number of the parts is not increased, and the connector for the fuel tank can be significantly easily attached to and detached from the sleeve in the lid body. Particularly, by making the connector for the fuel tank detachable from the lid body, a resource saving is achieved.<br>
Further, in accordance with the structure in which a pair of regulating portions having the gap in the rotating direction of the connector for the fuel tank is formed on the upper surface of the lid body so as to protrude, and the outer periphery of the external power source side terminal pin receiving recess portion of the connector for the fuel tank is arranged between the regulating portions, the connector for the fuel tank does not rotate even in the case that the rotating force is applied to the connector for the fuel tank from the external, and it is possible to maintain an improved electric connection state. In this case, the inexpensive rotation inhibiting mechanism can be obtained particularly by forming the regulating portion so as to protrude from the lid body,  and<br>
23<br><br>
arranging the outer periphery of the external power source side terminal pin receiving recess portion in the gap between the regulating portions.<br>
24<br>
Further, the sleeve can be integrally formed with the lid body by a drawing process. Accordingly, the number of the parts and the number of man-hour for assembly can be reduced and the manufacturing cost can be reduced, in comparison with the structure in which the sleeve is provided separately from the lid body, and then adhered to the lid body.<br><br><br>
