				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to compounds and methods for targeting an<br>
imaging agent to cells of an animal. More particularly, radionuclide-based imaging<br>
agents are targeted to cells having receptors for a vitamin by using such a vitamin, or<br>
a vitamin receptor binding derivative or an analog thereof, as the targeting ligand for<br>
the imaging agent.<br>
BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Transmembrane transport is a critical cellular function. Because<br>
practitioners have recognized the importance of transmembrane transport to many<br>
areas of medical and biological science, including drug therapy and gene transfer,<br>
there have been significant research efforts directed to the understanding and<br>
application of such processes. Thus, for example, transmembrane delivery of nucleic<br>
acids has been attempted through the use of protein carriers, antibody carriers,<br>
liposomal delivery systems, electroporation, direct injection, cell fusion, viral carriers,<br>
osmotic shock, and calcium-phosphate mediated transformation. However, many of<br>
those techniques are limited both by the types of cells in which transmembrane<br>
transport occurs and by the conditions required for successful transmembrane<br>
transport of exogenous molecules. Furthermore, many of these techniques are limited<br>
by the type and size of the exogenous molecule that can be transported across the cell<br>
membrane without loss of bioactivity.<br>
One mechanism for transmembrane transport of exogenous molecules<br>
having wide applicability is receptor-mediated endocytosis. Advantageously,<br>
receptor-mediated endocytosis occurs both in vivo and in vitro. Receptor-mediated<br>
endocytosis involves the movement of ligands bound to membrane receptors into the<br>
interior of an area bounded by the membrane through invagination of the membrane.<br>
The process is initiated or activated by the binding of a receptor-specific ligand to the<br>
receptor. Many receptor-mediated endocytotic systems have been characterized,<br>
including those resulting in internalization of galactose, mannose, mannose 6-<br>
phosphate, transferrin, asialoglycoprotein, folate, transcobalamin (vitamin B12), Î±-2<br><br>
macroglobulins, insulin, and other peptide growth factors such as epidermal growth<br>
factor (EGF).<br>
Receptor mediated endocytosis has been utilized for delivering<br>
exogenous molecules such as proteins and nucleic acids to cells. Generally, a specific<br>
ligand is chemically conjugated by covalent, ionic, or hydrogen bonding to an<br>
exogenous molecule of interest, forming a conjugate molecule having a moiety (the<br>
ligand portion) that is still recognized in the conjugate by a target receptor. Using this<br>
technique the phototoxic protein psoralen has been conjugated to insulin and<br>
internalized by the insulin receptor endocytotic pathway (Gasparro, Biochem.<br>
Biophys. Res. Comm. 141(2), pp. 502-509, Dec. 15, 1986); the hepatocyte specific<br>
receptor for galactose terminal asialoglycoproteins has been utilized for the<br>
hepatocyte-specific transmembrane delivery of asialoorosomucoid-poly-L-lysine non-<br>
covalently complexed to a plasmid (Wu, G. Y., J. Biol. Chem., 262(10), pp. 4429-<br>
4432, 1987); the cell receptor for EGF has been utilized to deliver polynucleotides<br>
covalently linked to EGF to the cell interior (Myers, European Patent Application<br>
86810614.7, published Jun. 6, 1988); the intestinally situated cellular receptor for the<br>
organometallic vitamin B12-intrinsic factor complex has been used to mediate delivery<br>
of a drug, a hormone, a bioactive peptide and an immunogen complexed with vitamin<br>
B12 to the circulatory system after oral administration (Russell-Jones et al., European<br>
patent Application 86307849.9, published Apr. 29, 1987); the mannose-6-phosphate<br>
receptor has been used to deliver low density lipoproteins to cells (Murray, G. J. and<br>
Neville, D. M., Jr., J.Biol.Chem, Vol. 255 (24), pp. 1194-11948, 1980); the cholera<br>
toxin binding subunit receptor has been used to deliver insulin to cells lacking insulin<br>
receptors (Roth and Maddox, J.Cell.Phys. Vol. 115, p. 151, 1983); and the human<br>
chorionic gonadotropin receptor has been employed to deliver a ricin a-chain coupled<br>
to HCG to cells with the appropriate HCG receptor (Oeltmann and Heath,<br>
J.Biol.Chem, vol. 254, p. 1028 (1979)).<br>
In one embodiment the present invention involves the transmembrane<br>
transport of a radionuclide-based imaging agent across a membrane having receptors<br>
for a vitamin, or a vitamin receptor binding derivative or analog thereof. A cell<br>
membrane bearing vitamin receptors, or receptors for vitamin derivatives or analogs,<br>
is contacted with a vitamin-imaging agent conjugate for a time sufficient to initiate<br><br>
and permit transmembrane transport of the conjugate, and the biodistribution of the<br>
vitamin-imaging agent conjugate in the animal is monitored. In another embodiment,<br>
the vitamin/vitamin derivative or analog targeting moiety simply binds to a cell<br>
surface vitamin receptor to concentrate the chelated radionuclide on the cell surface.<br>
The invention takes advantage of (1) the location of vitamin receptors<br>
and (2) the associated receptor-mediated endocytic processes. For example, the<br>
invention takes advantage of the unique expression, overexpression, or preferential<br>
expression of vitamin receptors, transporters, or other surface-presented proteins that<br>
specifically bind vitamins, or derivatives or analogs thereof, on tumor cells or other<br>
cell types which overexpress such receptors. Accordingly, the invention can be used<br>
to detect cells, such as tumor cells or other cell types, which overexpress vitamin<br>
receptors, or receptors for vitamin derivatives or analogs, by taking advantage of the<br>
receptor-mediated endocytic processes that occur when such cells are contacted with<br>
the vitamin-imaging agent conjugate.<br>
Vitamin receptors, such as the high-affinity folate receptor (FR) is<br>
expressed at high levels, for example, on cancer cells. Epithelial cancers of the ovary,<br>
mammary gland, colon, lung, nose, throat, and brain have all been reported to express<br>
elevated levels of the FR. In fact, greater than 90% of all human ovarian tumors are<br>
known to express large amounts of this receptor. Thus, the present invention can be<br>
used for the diagnostic imaging of a variety of tumor types, and of other cell types<br>
involved in disease states.<br>
Radionuclide chelators complexed to ligands have been used as non-<br>
invasive probes for diagnostic imaging purposes. For example, vasoactive intestinal<br>
peptide, somatostatin analogs, and monoclonal antibodies have been used as ligands<br>
to localize radionuclides to cells, such as tumor cells. Monoclonal antibodies, and<br>
various fragments thereof, initially received the most attention because it was believed<br>
that precise tumor-specific targeting might be achieved using monoclonal antibodies<br>
as targeting ligands. Unfortunately, this approach was problematic because<br>
i) antibodies have prolonged circulation times due to their large size which is<br>
unfavorable for imaging purposes, ii) antibodies are expensive to produce,<br>
iii) antibodies can be immunogenic, and, accordingly, must be humanized when<br>
multiple doses are used, and iv) tumor to non-target tissue ratios (T/NT) of antibody-<br><br>
linked radionuclides are sub-optimal. Thus, the focus has recently been directed to<br>
the use of smaller tumor-specific ligands that do not have such limitations.<br>
Vitamins, such as folic acid, have been used for the targeting of<br>
imaging agents to tumor cells, and are advantageous because of their small size. The<br>
first folic acid-based targeting complex described for in vivo tumor imaging was a<br>
histamine derivative containing Iodine. This complex was not considered a<br>
relevant clinical candidate because of the long-lived 125I radionuclide component.<br>
Subsequently, a deferoxamine-folate conjugate for tumor imaging was developed<br>
(deferoxamine chelates 67Ga, a gamma-emitting radionuclide that has a 78 hour half-<br>
life). Hepatobiliary clearance was noted with this conjugate and, thus, preclinical<br>
development was stopped due to anticipated problems in accurately imaging regio-<br>
abdominal locations. This obstacle was overcome, however, by replacing the<br>
deferoxamine chelator with diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA), an efficient<br>
chelator of111 In (68 hour half life). The primary route of elimination of111 In-DTPA-<br>
folate was confirmed to be through the kidneys.<br>
More recently, 99mTc has been adopted as the preferred radionuclide<br>
for diagnostic imaging, because i) the radionuclide is easily obtained from<br>
commercially available 99Mo-99mTc generators, ii) the cost of producing large<br>
amounts of 99mTc is insignificant compared to the cost of producing 111In, and iii)<br>
99mTc has a much shorter (6 hour) half life, which allows higher radionuclide doses to<br>
be administered, yielding higher resolution images without the risk of hazardous<br>
radiation exposure to vital organs.<br>
Several folate-based 99mTc conjugates have been developed. For<br>
example, folate conjugates of 99mTc-6-hydrazinonicotinamido-hydrazido (HYNIC;<br>
Guo, et al., J. Nucl. Med., 40(9): 1563-1569 (1999)), 99mTc~12-amino-3,3,9,9-<br>
tetramethyl-5-oxa-4,8 diaza-2,10-dodecanedinoe dioxime (OXA) (Linder, et al., Soc.<br>
Nucl. Med., Proc. 47th Annual Meeting, 2000,41(5): 119P), 99mTc-ethylenedicysteine<br>
(Ilgan, et al., Cancer Biother. &amp; Radiopharm., 13(6): 427-435 (1998)), and 99mTc-<br>
DTPA-folate (Mathias, et al., Bioconjug. Chem., 11(2): 253-257 (2000)) have shown<br>
promising in vivo tumor uptake qualities. However, there is a need for alternative<br>
vitamin-based 99mTc conjugates, or vitamin-based conjugates employing other<br>
radionuclides, that exhibit ortimal tumor to non-target tissue ratios (T/NT) and are<br><br>
eliminated through the kidneys. Such vitamin-based conjugates should be suitable for<br>
clinical development as tumor imaging agents, and for the diagnosis of other disease<br>
states.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the invention, compounds and methods are<br>
provided for targeting radionuclide-based imaging agents to cell pppulation that<br>
uniquely express, overexpress,or preferentially express vitamin recegtors.<br>
Accordingly, a vitamin, or a receptor binding derivative or analog thereof, is used as<br>
the targeting ligand for the imaging agent. The vitamin-imaging agent conjugate can<br>
be used to target radionuclides to cells and to concentrate the radionuclides in a cell<br>
population, such as a tumor cell population, for use in diagnostic imaging.<br>
The invention provides a composition for diagnostic imaging<br>
comprising a compound of the formula<br><br><br>
for use in such methods. In the compound, V is a vitamin, or a vitamin receptor<br>
binding derivative or analog thereof, L is a divalent linker, R is a side chain of an<br>
amino acid of the formula H2NCHRCOOH, M is a cation of a radionuclide, and n is<br>
or 0. The vitamin, or vitamin receptor binding derivative or analog thereof, is a<br>
substrate for receptor-mediated transmembrane transport in vivo.<br>
The invention also provides compounds of the formulas<br><br>
wherein V is a vitamin, or a vitamin receptor binding derivative or analog thereof, L<br>
is a divalent linker, R is a side chain of an amino acid of the formula H2NCHRCOOH,<br>
M is a cation of a radionuclide, n is 1 or 0, and k is 1 or 0. The vitamin is a substrate<br>
for receptor-mediated transmembrane transport in vivo.<br>
Exemplary of these compounds is a compound referred to as EC20<br>
depicted in Fig. 1. Exemplary of other compounds for use in accordance with this<br>
invention are compounds denominated as EC11, EC13, EC14, EC15, EC19, EC31,<br>
and EC53 (see Fig. 10). The vitamin moiety (e.g., the folic acid moiety in EC20)<br>
provides high affinity binding to cellular FRs. The compounds also contain a<br>
bifunctional peptide-based chelator, which provides the site for chelation of the<br>
radionuclide, for example, 99mTc (see Fig. 1), and the compounds can, optionally,<br>
contain a linker through which the vitamin moiety is covalently bonded to the<br>
chelating moiety.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the vitamin moiety of the compounds<br>
is a vitamin that is a substrate for receptor-mediated transmembrane transport in vivo,<br>
or a vitamin receptor binding derivative or analog thereof. The vitamin is linked,<br><br>
optionally, through a linker (L) to the chelator portion of the compounds. The<br>
chelator portion comprises an Î±, Î²-diaminopropionic acid moiety linked to a cysteine<br>
group through a third amino acid residue. The chelator portion of the compound is<br>
adapted to bind a radionuclide cation (M) (where k = 1).<br>
In accordance with the invention, the compounds with bound<br>
radionuclide are referred to as "vitamin-imaging agent conjugates."<br>
The structure of the linker, if present, is not critical to the invention.<br>
Thus, for example, it can be any biocompatible divalent linker. Typically, the linker<br>
comprises about 1 to about 30 carbon atoms, more typically about 2 to about 20<br>
carbon atoms. Lower molecular weight linkers (i.e., those having an approximate<br>
molecular weight of about 30 to about 300) are typically employed. Furthermore, the<br>
vitamin moiety may be a vitamin, or a derivative or analog thereof. For example,<br>
folate contains one glutamic acid in the L configuration linked to pteroic acid. As<br>
shown in Fig. 1, EC20 comprises a folic acid analog linked to the chelator moiety<br>
because EC20 has the glutamic acid in the D configuration. EC11 and EC 14 contain<br>
two glutamic acid residues and, thus, these compounds can also, for example, be<br>
considered derivatives of folic acid (Fig. 10).<br>
Among vitamins believed to trigger receptor-mediated endocytosis and<br>
having application in accordance with the presently disclosed method are niacin,<br>
pantothenic acid, folic acid, riboflavin, thiamine, biotin, vitamin B12, and the lipid<br>
soluble vitamins A, D, E and K. These vitamins, and their analogs and derivatives,<br>
constitute vitamins that can be coupled with imaging agents to form the vitamin-<br>
chelator conjugates for use in accordance with the invention. Preferred vitamin<br>
moieties include folic acid, biotin, riboflavin, thiamine, vitamin B12, and analogs and<br>
derivatives of these vitamin molecules, and other related vitamin receptor-binding<br>
molecules.<br>
Folic acid, folinic acid, pteroic acid, pteropolyglutamic acid, and folate<br>
receptor-binding pteridines such as tetrahydropterins, dihydrofolates,<br>
tetrahydrofolates, and their deaza and dideaza analogs can be used in accordance with<br>
the invention. The terms "deaza" and "dideaza" analogs refers to the art-recognized<br>
folate analogs having a carbon atom substituted for one or two nitrogen atoms in the<br>
naturally occurring folic acid structure. For example, the deaza analogs include the 1-<br><br>
deaza, 3-deaza, 5-deaza, 8-deaza, and 10-deaza analogs. The dideaza analogs include,<br>
for example, 1,5 dideaza, 5,10-dideaza, 8,10-dideaza, and 5,8-dideaza analogs. The<br>
foregoing are folate analogs or derivatives and can bind to folate receptors. Other<br>
folate analogs or derivatives useful in accordance with the invention are the folate<br>
receptor-binding analogs aminopterin, amethopterin (methotrexate), N10 -<br>
methylfolate, 2-deamino-hydroxyfolate, deaza analogs such as 1-deazamethopterin or<br>
3-deazamethopterin, and 3'5'-dichloro-4-amino-4-deoxy-N10 -methylpteroylglutamic<br>
acid (dichloromethotrexate).<br>
The vitamin, or derivative or analog thereof, can be capable of<br>
selectively binding to the population of cells to be visualized due to preferential<br>
expression on the targeted cells of a receptor for the vitamin, or derivative or analog,<br>
wherein the receptor is accessible for binding. The binding site for the vitamin can<br>
include receptors for any vitamin molecule capable of specifically binding to a<br>
receptor wherein the receptor or other protein is uniquely expressed, overexpressed,<br>
or preferentially expressed by the population of cells to be visualized. A surface-<br>
presented protein uniquely expressed, overexpressed, or preferentially expressed by<br>
the cells to be visualized is a receptor not present or present at lower amounts on other<br>
cells providing a means for selective, rapid, and sensitive visualization of the cells<br>
targeted for diagnostic imaging using the vitamin-imaging agent conjugates of the<br>
present invention.<br>
In accordance with the invention the vitamin-imaging agent conjugates<br>
are capable of high affinity binding to receptors on cancer cells or other cells to be<br>
visualized. The high affinity binding can be inherent to the vitamin moiety or the<br>
binding affinity can be enhanced by the use of a chemically modified vitamin (i.e., an<br>
analog or a derivative) or by the particular chemical linkage between the vitamin and<br>
the chelator moiety that is present in the conjugate.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the chelator can be conjugated with<br>
multiple, different vitamins, or vitamin receptor binding derivatives or analogs, to<br>
enhance the opportunity for binding to the respective cell membrane receptors.<br>
Alternatively, independent portions of the dose of a vitamin-imaging agent conjugate<br>
can constitute different vitamin-imaging agent conjugates to enhance the opportunity<br>
for binding to the respective cell membrane receptors.<br><br>
Generally, any manner of forming a complex between the chelator and<br>
the vitamin, or vitamin receptor binding derivative or analog, can be utilized in<br>
accordance with the present invention. The chelator can form a complex with the<br>
vitamin, or vitamin receptor binding derivative or analog, by direct conjugation of the<br>
chelator and the vitamin by using a divalent linker. Alternatively, the vitamin and the<br>
chelator may be conjugated without employing a linker. If a linker is used, the linker<br>
can directly conjugate the vitamin, or vitamin receptor binding derivative or analog,<br>
and the chelator through a hydrogen, ionic, or covalent bond. Also, in accordance<br>
with this invention the divalent linker can comprise an indirect means for associating<br>
the chelator with the vitamin, or vitamin receptor binding derivative or analog, such<br>
as by connection through intermediary linkers, spacer arms, or bridging molecules.<br>
Both direct and indirect means for association must not prevent the binding of the<br>
vitamin, or vitamin receptor binding derivative or analog, to the vitamin receptor on<br>
the cell membrane for operation of the method of the present invention.<br>
Covalent bonding of the vitamin, or vitamin receptor binding<br>
derivative or analog, and the chelator can occur, whether or not a linker is employed,<br>
through the formation of amide, ester or imino bonds between acid, aldehyde,<br>
hydroxy, amino, or hydrazo groups. For example, a carboxylic acid on the vitamin<br>
moiety or on the chelator can be activated using carbonyldiimidazole or standard<br>
carbodiimide coupling reagents such as l-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-<br>
carbodiimide (EDC) and thereafter reacted with the other component of the conjugate,<br>
or with a linker, having at least one nucleophilic group, viz hydroxy, amino, hydrazo,<br>
or thiol, to form the vitamin-chelator conjugate coupled, with or without a linker,<br>
through ester, amide, or thioester bonds.<br>
The radionuclides suitable for diagnostic imaging include<br>
radioisotopes of gallium, indium, copper, technetium and rhenium, including isotopes<br>
111In, 99mTc, 64Cu, 67Cu, 67Ga or 68Ga. These radionuclides are cationic and are<br>
complexed with the chelator through the chelating group of the conjugate to form the<br>
vitamin-imaging agent conjugate.<br>
The vitamin-imaging agent conjugates in accordance with the<br>
invention are utilized to selectively visualize, using scintigraphic imaging techniques,<br>
a population of cells in an animal wherein the population of cells uniquely expresses,<br><br>
overexpresses, or preferentially expresses receptors for a vitamin, or a vitamin<br>
receptor binding derivative or analog thereof. The vitamin-imaging agent conjugates<br>
can be used to visualize populations of pathogenic cells, as long as the cells uniquely<br>
or preferentially express or overexpress vitamin receptors or receptors that bind<br>
vitamin derivatives or analogs.<br>
The invention is applicable to populations of pathogenic cells that<br>
cause a variety of pathologies including cancer, and diseases mediated by any other<br>
type of pathogenic cells that overexpress vitamin receptors, or receptors capable of<br>
binding vitamin derivatives or analogs. Thus, the population of pathogenic cells can<br>
be tumorigenic, including benign tumors and malignant tumors, or it can be non-<br>
tumorigenic. If the cell population is a cancer cell population, the cancer cells can<br>
arise spontaneously or by such processes as mutations present in the germline of the<br>
host animal or somatic mutations, or the cancer can be chemically-, virally-, or<br>
radiation-induced. The invention can be utilized for diagnostic imaging of such<br>
cancers as carcinomas, sarcomas, lymphomas, Hodgekin's disease, melanomas,<br>
mesotheliomas, Burkitt's lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinomas, and myelomas.<br>
The cancer cell population can include, but is not limited to, oral, nasopharyngeal,.<br>
thyroid, endocrine, skin, gastric, esophageal, laryngeal, throat, pancreatic, colon,<br>
bladder, bone, ovarian, cervical, uterine, breast, testicular, prostate, rectal, kidney,<br>
liver, lung, and brain cancers. In embodiments where the cell population is a cancer<br>
cell population, tumor cells, including cells of the primary tumor or cells that have<br>
metastasized or are in the process of dissociating from the primary tumor, can be<br>
visualized using the vitamin-imaging agent conjugate.<br>
The vitamin-imaging agent conjugates of the present invention can be<br>
used to diagnose a disease state or to monitor the progression of disease. For<br>
example, the diagnostic imaging method in accordance with the invention can be used<br>
to monitor the progression of cancer in combination with prophylactic treatments to<br>
prevent return of a tumor after its removal by any therapeutic approach including<br>
surgical removal of the tumor, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or biological therapy.<br>
The compositions and methods of the present invention can be used for<br>
both human clinical medicine and veterinary applications. Thus, the animal harboring<br>
the population of cells that are visualized can be human or, in the case of veterinary<br><br>
applications, can be a laboratory, agricultural, domestic, or wild animal. The present<br>
invention can be applied to animals including, but not limited to, humans, laboratory<br>
animals such rodents (e.g., mice, rats, hamsters, etc.), rabbits, monkeys, chimpanzees,<br>
domestic animals such as dogs, cats, and rabbits, agricultural animals such as cows,<br>
horses, pigs, sheep, goats, and wild animals in captivity such as bears, pandas, lions,<br>
tigers, leopards, elephants, zebras, giraffes, gorillas, dolphins, and whales.<br>
The compositions for diagnostic imaging comprise an amount of the<br>
vitamin-imaging agent conjugate effective to visualize the cells targeted for diagnostic<br>
imaging in an animal when administered in one or more doses. The diagnostic<br>
imaging composition containing the vitamin-imaging agent conjugate is preferably<br>
administered to the animal parenterally, e.g., intradermally, subcutaneously,<br>
intramuscularly, intraperitoneally, intravenously, or intrathecally. Alternatively, the<br>
composition containing the vitamin-imaging agent conjugate can be administered to<br>
the animal by other medically useful processes, and any effective dose and suitable<br>
dosage form can be used, including oral and inhalation dosage forms.<br>
Examples of parenteral dosage forms include aqueous solutions of the<br>
vitamin-imaging agent conjugate, in isotonic saline, 5% glucose or other well-known<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable liquid carriers such as liquid alcohols, glycols, esters,<br>
and amides. The parenteral dosage form in accordance with this invention can be in<br>
the form of a reconstitutable lyophilizate comprising the dose of the vitamin-imaging<br>
agent conjugate.<br>
The dosage of the vitamin-imaging agent conjugate in the diagnostic<br>
imaging composition can vary significantly depending on the size of the animal, the<br>
cell population targeted for diagnostic imaging, the specific vitamin-imaging agent<br>
conjugate being used, and the route of administration of the conjugate. The effective<br>
amount to be administered to the animal is based on body surface area, weight, and<br>
physician assessment of the condition of the animal. An effective dose can range<br>
from about 1 ng/kg to about 1 mg/kg, more preferably from about 100 ng/kg to about<br>
500 Âµg/kg, and most preferably from about 100 ng/kg to about 25 0181Âµg/kg.<br>
Any effective regimen for administering the diagnostic imaging<br>
composition containing the vitamin-imaging agent conjugate can be used. For<br>
example, the diagnostic imaging composition can be administered as a single dose, or<br><br>
it can be administered in multiple doses, if necessary, to achieve visualization of the<br>
targeted cell population. Additional injections of the diagnostic imaging composition<br>
containing the vitamin-imaging agent conjugate can be administered to the animal at<br>
an interval of days or months after the initial injections(s), and the additional<br>
injections can be useful for monitoring the progress of the disease state. The<br>
diagnostic imaging composition containing the vitamin-imaging agent conjugate can<br>
also be administered in combination with unlabeled vitamin. "In combination with"<br>
means that the unlabeled vitamin can be either coadministered with the imaging agent<br>
or the unlabeled vitamin can be preinjected before administration of the imaging agent<br>
to improve image quality. For example, the imaging agent can be administered in<br>
combination with about 0.5 ng/kg to about 100 mg/kg, or about 1 Âµg/kg to about 100<br>
mg/kg, or about 100 Âµg/kg to about 100 mg/kg of the unlabeled vitamin.<br>
The diagnostic imaging composition is typically formulated for<br>
parenteral administration and is administered to the animal in an amount effective to<br>
enable imaging of the targeted cell population. Typically, the diagnostic imaging<br>
composition containing the vitamin-targeted imaging agent is administered to the<br>
animal, and following a period of time to allow delivery and concentration of the<br>
vitamin-imaging agent conjugate in the targeted cell population, the animal is<br>
subjected to the imaging procedure and imaging is enabled by the vitamin-imaging<br>
agent conjugate. When used for monitoring the progression of disease or diagnosis,<br>
imaging procedures are typically carried out about 1 to about 6 hours post<br>
administration of the diagnostic imaging composition containing the vitamin-imaging<br>
agent conjugate.<br>
The invention also provides a method of imaging a population of cells<br>
in an animal wherein the cells are characterized by a vitamin receptor on the surface<br>
of the cells. The method comprises the steps of administering to the animal an<br>
effective amount of a composition comprising a compound of the formula<br><br><br>
wherein V is the vitamin, or a receptor binding derivative or analog thereof, specific<br>
for the cell surface vitamin receptor, L is a divalent linker, R is a side chain of an<br>
amino acid of the formula H2NCHRCOOH, M is a cation of a radionuclide, n is 1 or<br>
0, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier therefor, and monitoring the<br>
biodistribution of the compound in the animal.<br>
The method can be used to image a cell population in vitro, e.g., in cell<br>
culture, or in vivo, where the cells form part of or otherwise exist in animal tissue.<br>
Thus, the target cells can include, for example, the cells lining the alimentary canal,<br>
such as the oral and pharyngeal mucosa, the cells forming the villi of the small<br>
intestine, or the cells lining the large intestine. Such cells of the alimentary canal can<br>
be targeted in accordance with this invention by oral administration of a diagnostic<br>
imaging composition comprising the vitamin-imaging agent conjugate. Similarly,<br>
cells lining the respiratory system (nasal passages/lungs) of an animal can be targeted<br>
by inhalation of the present complexes, and cells of internal organs, including cells of<br>
the ovaries and the brain can be targeted, particularly, by parenteral administration of<br>
the diagnostic imaging composition.<br>

N10-trifluoroacetylpteroic acid was purchased from Eprova AG,<br>
Schaffhausen, Switzerland. Peptide synthesis reagents were purchased from<br>
NovaBiochem and Bachem. 99mTc Sodium Pertechnetate was supplied by Syncor.<br>
[Re02(en)2]Cl was prepared according to Rouschias (Rouschias, G., Chem. Rev., 74:<br><br>
531 (1974)). Cellulose plates and DEAE ion exchange plates were purchased from<br>
J.T. Baker.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Synthesis, Purification, and Analytical Characterization of EC20<br>
EC20 was prepared by a polymer-supported sequential approach using<br>
the Fmoc-strategy (see Scheme 1 below; Fmoc = 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl; Boc<br>
= tert.butyloxycarbonyl; Dap = diaminopropionic acid; DMF = dimethylformamide;<br>
DIPEA = diisopropylethylamine). EC20 was synthesized on an acid-sensitive Wang<br>
resin loaded with Fmoc-L-Cys(Trt)-OH. Benzotriazole-1-yl-oxy-tris-pyrrolidino-<br>
phosphoniumhexafluorophosphate (PyBOP) was applied as the activating reagent to<br>
ensure efficient coupling using low equivalents of amino acids. Fmoc protecting<br>
groups were removed after every coupling step under standard conditions (20%<br>
piperidine in DMF). After the last assembly step the peptide was cleaved from the<br>
polymeric support by treatment with 92.5% trifluoroacetic acid containing 2.5%<br>
ethanedithiol, 2.5% triisopropylsilane and 2.5% deionized water. This reaction also<br>
resulted in simultaneous removal of the t-Bu, Boc and trityl protecting groups.<br>
Finally, the trifluoroacetyl moiety was removed in aqueous ammonium hydroxide to<br>
give EC20.<br>
The crude EC20 product was purified by HPLC using an Xterra RP18<br>
30 x 300 mm, 7 Âµm column (Waters); mobile phase 32 mM HC1 (A), MeOH (B);<br>
gradient conditions starting with 99% A and 1% B, and reaching 89% A and 11% B<br>
in 37 min by a flow rate of 20 mL/min. Under these conditions, EC20 monomer<br>
typically eluted at 14.38 min, whereas EC20 disulfide dimer (minor contaminant)<br>
eluted at 16.83 min. All other compounds shown in Fig. 10 can be prepared using a<br>
similar synthesis scheme except for EC 15 which is synthesized as shown in Scheme 2<br>
below.<br>
Two milligrams of HPLC-purified EC20 were dissolved in 0.62 mL of<br>
D20, and a 500 MHz 1H-NMR spectrum was collected. Table 1 (see below) lists the<br>
chemical shifts, signal shapes, and J values for all non-exchangeable protons in EC20<br>
molecule.<br><br>
EC20 was also analyzed by electrospray-mass spectrometry. Major<br>

EXAMPLE 3<br>
Preparation of the Non-Radioactive Reagent vial and of 99mTc-EC20<br>
EC20 kits were used for preparation of the 99mTc-EC20 radioactive<br>
drug substance. Each kit contained a sterile, non-pyrogenic lyophilized mixture of 0.1<br>
mg EC20, 80 mg sodium Î±-D-glucoheptonate, 80 mg tin (II) chloride dihydrate, and<br>
sufficient sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid to adjust the pH to 6.8 Â± 0.2 prior to<br>
lyophilization. The lyophilized powder was sealed in a 5 mL vial under an argon<br>
atmosphere. The kits were then stored frozen at -20Â°C until use or expiration (current<br>
shelf life is &gt; 2 years). Importantly, the tin (II) chloride component is required to<br>
reduce the added 99mTc-pertechnetate, while the sodium a-D-glucoheptonate<br>
component is necessary to stabilize the newly reduced 99mTc prior to its final chelation<br>
to the EC20 compound.<br>
99mTc-EC20 was prepared as follows (i.e., chelation of 99mTc to EC20).<br>
First, a boiling water bath containing a partially submerged lead vial shield was<br>
prepared. The top of an EC20 vial was swabbed with 70% ethanol to sanitize the<br>
surface and the vial was placed in a suitable shielding container. Using a shielded<br>
syringe with 27-gauge needle, 1 mL of sterile Sodium Pertechnetate 99mTc Injection<br><br>
(15 to 20 mCi) in 0.9% sodium chloride was injected into the shielded vial. Before<br>
removal of the syringe from the vial, a volume of gas from the vial equal to the<br>
volume of pertechnetate added was withdrawn in order to normalize the pressure<br>
inside the vial. The vial was gently swirled for 30 seconds to ensure complete<br>
dissolution of the lyophilized powder. The vial was then placed into the lead shield<br>
that was standing in the boiling water bath. The solution was heated for ~18 minutes<br>
and then cooled to room temperature for a minimum of 15 min. This solution can be<br>
stored at room temperature (15-25Â°C) protected from light, but it should be used<br>
within 6 hours of preparation.<br>
The radiochemical stability of the radioactive drug substance was<br>
determined by HPLC after storing at room temperature protected from light for up to<br>
24 hours. Samples of the 99mTc-EC20 solution (20 ÂµL) were analyzed using an HPLC<br>
system consisting of a Waters 600E Multisolvent Delivery System and 490 UV<br>
detector, a Bioscan EC-3200 radiodetector, Laura vl.5 radiochromatogram software,<br>
and a Waters Nova-Pak CI8 (3.9 x 150 mm) column. Injected samples were eluted<br>
isocratically using an aqueous mobile phase containing 20% methanol and 0.1%<br>
trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The HPLC analysis was monitored<br>
with both the UV detector (280 nm) and the gamma radiodetector. Notably, the<br>
radiochemical purity of 99mTc-EC20 remained greater than 90% for at least 24 hours<br>
in all cases.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Determination of Radiochemical purity of 99mTc-EC20 by TLC<br>
The major radiochemical impurities in the preparation of 99mTc-EC20<br>
will be 1) 99mTc pertechnetate, 2) 99mTc-glucoheptonate (ligand exchange precursor),<br>
3) non-specific binding 99mTc (99mTc bound at a site other than the expected Dap-Asp-<br>
Cys chelating moiety of the EC20 molecule), and 4) hydrolyzed 99mTc. Since 99mTc-<br>
EC20 was being tested for possible clinical use, a three-TLC-based method was<br>
developed to determine the amounts of each impurity and to estimate the overall<br>
radiochemical purity of 99mTc-EC20.<br>
In the first system a cellulose plate was developed with deionized<br>
water. 99mTc-EC20, 99mTc-glucoheptonate, non-specific binding 99mTc and 99mTc<br><br>
pertechnetate move to the solvent front (Rf = 1.0), while hydrolyzed 99mTc remains at<br>
the origin (Rf = 0.0). The cellulose plate was cut into two pieces at Rf = 0.3 (1.5 cm<br>
from origin) and each piece was counted using a dose calibrator. The percent of<br>
hydrolyzed 99mTc was calculated as follows: A = % Hydrolyzed; 99mTc = (ÂµCi in<br>
bottom piece/ÂµCi in both pieces) x 100.<br>
In the second system, a cellulose plate was developed with acetone and<br>
0.9% NaCl (7:3,v/v). 99mTc~pertechnetate moves with Rf = 0.9, while 99mTc-EC20,<br>
99mTc-glucoheptonate, non-specific binding 99mTc and hydrolyzed 99mTc remain at the<br>
origin (Rf = 0.0). The cellulose/acetone-saline plate was cut into two pieces at Rf =<br>
0.6 (3.0 cm from the origin) and each piece was counted using a dose calibrator. The<br>
percent of 99mTc-pertechnetate was calculated as follows: B = % 99mTc-pertechnetate<br>
= (uCi in top piece/ÂµCi in both pieces) x 100.<br>
Finally, in the third system a DEAE ion exchange plate was developed<br>
with 0.3 M Na2SO4. 99mTc-glucoheptonate moves to the solvent front (Rf = 1.0),<br>
nonspecific binding 99mTc moves with Rf = 0.6, and 99mTc~EC20, hydrolyzed 99mTc<br>
and 99mTc-pertechnetate remain near the origin (99mTc-EC20. Rf = 0.1; hydrolyzed<br>
99mTc: Rf = 0.0; 99mTc pertechnetate: Rf = 0.3). The cellulose/Na2S04 plate was cut<br>
into two pieces at 2.5 cm from the origin and each piece was counted using a dose<br>
calibrator. The percent of 99mTc-glucoheptonate and non-specific binding 99mTc were<br>
calculated as follows: C = % (99mTc-Glucoheptonate + non-specific binding 99mTc) =<br>
(ÂµCi in top piece/uCi in both pieces) x 100. The overall radiochemical purity of<br>
99mTc-EC20 was then calculated as follows: Radiochemical purity = 100 - (A+B+C).<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, HPLC analysis of the 99mTc-EC20 formulation<br>
shows four radiochemical components, designated as Peaks A through D. Peak A<br>
was confirmed to be free 99mTc and this by-product is reproducibly present at 
Peak B, which was different from that of 99mTc-glucoheptonate (data not shown)<br>
eluted with a retention time of 2.8 min. This component represented about 3% of the<br>
mixture and was thought to result from 99mTc chelating at some other site on the EC20<br>
molecule besides the expected Dap-Asp-Cys moiety. Peaks C and D (retention times<br>
of 4.8 minutes and 13.2 minutes, respectively), account for the majority of the<br>
formulated radiochemical activity.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
Synthesis of Re-EC20<br>
Fifty-two mg (0.010 mmol) of EC20 and [Re02(en)2]Cl (52 mg, 0.14<br>
mmol) were dissolved in 6 mL and 1 mL argon-purged phosphate buffer (0.05 M, pH<br>
5.8), respectively. The two solutions were combined and heated under an argon<br>
atmosphere in a boiling water bath for 2 hours. The reaction mixture was frozen and<br>
lyophilized overnight. The crude product was purified by HPLC (Xterra RPI8<br>
column, 19x150 mm, 10 mM NH4OAC/CH3CN, flow rate 10 mL/mm; gradient 1% to<br>
8%). The fractions were collected, lyophilized and stored at -20Â°C until use.<br>
Because no mass spectral facilities were available for analysis of<br>
radioactive materials, the non-radioactive rhenium analog, Re-EC20, was analyzed.<br>
Both rhenium and technetium are Group VIIA metals that have significant similarity<br>
in physical and chemical properties. They also form similar complexes with organic<br>
ligands. This analogous chemical behavior has been frequently used in structure<br>
elucidation of new classes of technetium radiopharmaceuticals based on non-<br>
radioactive rhenium analogues. Interestingly, HPLC analysis of Re-EC20 also<br>
showed two major peaks eluting at 5 and 14.2 minutes, respectively, similar to Peaks<br>
C and D for 99mTc-EC20 (chromatogram not shown). Mass spectral analysis<br>
confirmed that these two components were isomers corresponding to the Re-EC20<br>
complex (m/z = 945). In fact, these species were likely diastereomers possessing<br>
either a syn or anti configuration of the technetium-oxygen bond in the Dap-Asp-Cys<br>
chelating ring, as depicted in Fig. 3. Because i) the two peaks in the Re-EC20<br>
chromatogram represent isomeric complexes, and ii) reports of similar isomerism in<br>
technetium complexes exist, it is likely that components C and D in the 99mTc-EC20<br>
radiochromatogram are also isomers.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
Cell Culture<br>
Cells were grown continuously as a monolayer using folate-free RPMI<br>
medium (FFRPMI) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (HIFCS) at 37Â°C<br>
in a 5% C02/95% air-humidified atmosphere with no antibiotics. The HIFCS<br>
contained its normal complement of endogenous folates which enabled the cells to<br><br>
sustain growth in this more physiologically-relevant medium. All cell experiments<br>
were performed using FFRPMI containing 10% HIFCS (FFRPMI/HIFCS) as the<br>
growth medium, except where indicated.<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
Relative Affinity Assay<br>
The relative affinity of various folate derivatives was determined<br>
according to the method described by Westerhoff et al. (Mol. Pharm., 48: 459-471<br>
(1995)) with slight modification. Briefly, FR-positive KB cells were gently<br>
trypsinized in 0.25% trypsin/PBS at room temperature for 3 minutes and then diluted<br>
in FFRPMI/HIFCS. Following a 5 min 800 x g spin and one PBS wash, the final cell<br>
pellet was suspended in FFRPMI 1640 (no serum). Cells were incubated for 15 min<br>
on ice with 100 nM of 3H-folic acid in the absence and presence of increasing<br>
concentrations of folate-containing test articles. Samples were centrifuged at 10,000<br>
x g for 5 min, cell pellets were suspended in buffer, were transferred to individual<br>
vials containing 5 mL of scintillation cocktail, and were then counted for<br>
radioactivity. Negative control tubes contained only the 3H-folic acid in FFRPMI (no<br>
competitor). Positive control tubes contained a final concentration of 1 mM folic<br>
acid, and CPMs measured in these samples (representing non-specific binding of<br>
label) were subtracted from all samples. Notably, relative affinities were defined as<br>
the inverse molar ratio of compound required to displace 50% of 3H-folic acid bound<br>
to KB FR, and the relative affinity of folic acid for the FR was set to 1.<br>
The capacity of EC20 to directly compete with folic acid for binding to<br>
cell surface FRs was measured using this assay. Importantly, a relative affinity value<br>
of 1.0 implies that the test article ligand has an affinity for the FR equal to folic acid.<br>
Likewise, values lower than unity reflect weaker affinity, and values higher than unity<br>
reflect stronger affinity.<br>
Cultured KB cells were incubated with 100 nM 3H-folic acid in the<br>
presence of increasing concentrations of non-radioactive folic acid, EC20, Rhenium-<br>
EC20 (isomer A; Peak C), Rhenium-EC20 (isomer B; peak 0), or a related folate-<br>
based radiopharmaceutical, DTPA-folate. Following a 15-minute incubation at 4Â°C,<br>
cells were rinsed free of unbound material and counted for residual cell-associated<br><br>
radioactivity. The quantity of bound radioactivity was plotted against the<br>
concentration of unlabeled ligand, and IC50 values (concentration of ligand required to<br>
block 50% of 3H-folic acid binding) were estimated. As shown in Fig. 4 and Table 2<br>
(below), EC20 was determined to have an affinity of 0.92 relative to that of folic acid<br>
for human FRs. Both isomers of Rhenium-EC20 displayed relative affinity values<br>
that were very similar to, if not better than, the parent EC20 molecule (1.42 and 1.37<br>
for Re-EC20 isomer A and isomer B, respectively). DTPA-folate, an 111 In-chelating<br>
folate radiopharmaceutical agent, displayed a relative affinity of 0.87 for the folate<br>
receptor. Thus, chemical modification of folate with various metal chelating motifs<br>
did not disturb the vitamin's intrinsic affinity for the FR.<br><br>
Table 2. Relative Affinity Estimations. Relative affinities (RA) were defined as the<br>
inverse molar ratio of compound required to displace 50% of 3H-folic acid bound to<br>
FR-positive KB cells. The relative affinity of folic acid was set to 1. Each test article<br>
was evaluated in triplicate.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 8<br>
Time-Dependent Cell Uptake<br>
KB cells were seeded in 12-well Falcon plates and allowed to form<br>
sub-confluent monolayers overnight. Following one rinse with 1 mL of fresh<br>
FFRPMI/HIFCS, each well received 1 mL of FFRPMI/HIFCS containing 10 nM<br>
99mTc-EC20. Cells were incubated for predetermined times at 37Â°C and then rinsed<br>
four times with 1 mL of ice-cold PBS, pH 7.4. The cell monolayers were dissolved in<br>
0.5 mL of PBS, pH 7.4 containing 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate for 15 min at room<br>
temperature and then counted for radioactivity using a Packard gamma counter. The<br>
protein in each sample was quantitated using a BioRad DC Protein Assay kit, and<br>
cellular protein values were converted to cell number using the conversion factor of<br>
2.23 x 10-7 mg protein per cell. Final tabulated values were expressed in terms of<br>
molecules of EC20 per cell.<br>
The kinetics of 99mTc-EC20 uptake into FR-positive KB cells was<br>
quantitatively measured using this protocol. As shown in Fig. 5, steady-state uptake<br>
was reached within two hours at 37Â°C, where approximately 3.2 million molecules of<br>
EC20 were cell-associated, whereas half-maximal cell association occurred 9 minutes<br>
after mixing 10 nM of this radiopharmaceutical with the cells. Interestingly, the half-<br>
maximal saturation point was reached in only 37 seconds when cells were incubated<br>
with a 10-fold higher concentration of 99mTc-EC20 (100 nM; data not shown).<br><br>
EXAMPLE 9<br>
Concentration-Dependent Cell Uptake<br>
KB cells were seeded in 12-well Falcon plates and allowed to form<br>
sub-confluent monolayers overnight. Following one rinse with 1 mL of fresh<br>
FERPMI/HIFCS, each well received 1 mL of FFRPMI/HIFCS containing increasing<br>
concentrations of 99mTc-EC20. Cells were incubated for 2 hours at 37Â°C and then<br>
rinsed four times with 1 mL of ice-cold PBS, pH 7.4. The monolayers were dissolved<br>
in 0.5 mL of PBS, pH 7.4 containing 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate for 15 min at room<br>
temperature and then counted for radioactivity using a Packard gamma counter.<br>
Protein content was determined as described above, and final tabulated values were<br>
expressed in terms of molecules of EC20 per cell.<br>
As shown in Fig. 6, the cell uptake of 99mTc-EC20 was found to be<br>
dependent on the extracellular concentration. The particular KB cells used were<br>
determined to bind a maximum of four million molecules of the folate<br>
radiopharmaceutical per cell. Scatchard analysis of the data estimated the KD of<br>
binding to be 3.2 nM, a value comparable with the KD observed for the vitamin folate<br>
binding to these same cells.<br>
Although the full identity of the Peak B component was not<br>
established, UV absorption analysis indicated that it contained a folate moiety (i.e.,<br>
the absorption spectrum contained folate's signature secondary absorption peak at 363<br>
nm). This HPLC-purified radiolabeled material (Peak B material) was collected and<br>
then added to cultured KB cells. As shown in Fig. 7, the cell uptake of the 99mTc-<br>
labeled Peak B component was also found to be dependent on the extracellular<br>
concentration. Scatchard analysis of the data estimated the KD of binding to be 1.1<br>
nM. Interestingly, the cell association of Peak B was completely blocked in the<br>
presence of excess folic acid, indicating that this minor formulation by-product is also<br>
capable of targeting FR-positive cells for radiodiagnostic purposes.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 10<br>
Blood Clearance<br>
Animals used for this study were maintained on a folate-free diet<br>
(Harlan #TD-90261) for approximately three weeks prior to dose administration.<br>
Acclimation to this special diet is essential because regular rodent diets contain large<br>
amounts of folic acid (6 mg/kg chow) and promote high serum folate levels in mice.<br>
Furthermore, previous studies have shown that mice placed on a folate-free diet for 3<br>
weeks had maintained a safe serum folate level of 25 Â± 7 nM, which is slightly higher<br>
than the 9-14 nM concentration measurable in human serum.<br>
The 99mTc-EC20 solution was prepared on the day of use and had<br>
initially contained 100 Âµg of EC20 per milliliter. The solution was further diluted<br>
with sterile saline to prepare working stock solutions. The radiochemical purity of the<br>
product was estimated to be ~94% by TLC. Each animal received a dose of 50 ug/kg<br>
EC20 (67 nmol/kg) in approximately 0.1 mL volume i.v. via the tail vein during brief<br>
diethyl ether anesthesia. At the designated times (see Fig. 8) post-injection, each<br>
animal was euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation, and blood was immediately collected by<br>
cardiac puncture.<br>
As shown in Fig. 8,99mTc-EC20 was rapidly removed from circulation<br>
in the Balb/c mouse. The plasma half life of this radiopharmaceutical was estimated<br>
to be ~ 4 minutes, and less than 0.2% of the injected 99mTc-EC20 dose remained in<br>
circulation after four hours (assuming that blood represents 5.5% of the total body<br>
mass). This data indicates that folate conjugates are rapidly removed from circulation<br>
following intravenous administration, and that valuable tissue biodistribution data can<br>
be obtained after only a few hours post-injection without the concern for non-specific<br>
tissue uptake due to blood-borne radioactivity.<br>
EXAMPLE 11<br>
Tissue Distribution Studies<br>
The ability of 99mTc-EC20 to target tumors in vivo was assessed using<br>
a FR-positive Ml09 model. These tumor cells are syngeneic for the Balb/c mouse,<br>
and they reproducibly form subcutaneous solid tumors within two weeks post<br>
inoculation. 99mTc-EC14, which is structurally similar to 99mTc-EC20 except it<br><br>
contains one additional D-G1U residue (i.e., Pte-D-Glu-D-Glu-Î²Dpr-Asp-Cys), 99mTc-<br>
EC28 (a non-pteroate containing control consisting of benzoyl-D-Glu-n-Glu-(3Dpr-<br>
Asp-Cys), and the previously reported 111In-DTPA-folate radiopharmaceutical were<br>
also evaluated in this bioassay. Importantly, the 99mTc-EC28 control agent will not<br>
bind to cell surface FRs because it lacks an essential pteridine ring moiety.<br>
Four to five week-old mice (Balb/c strain) were purchased from Harlan<br>
Sprague Dawley, Inc. (Indianapolis, IN) and were maintained on a folate-free diet for<br>
a total of three weeks prior to the experiment. Syngeneic, FR-positive Ml09 tumor<br>
cells (1 x 106 per animal) were inoculated in the subcutis of the right axilla two weeks<br>
prior to the experiment. All mice were females, and the tumor weights were 54.2 Â±<br>
29.8 mg on the day of this experiment. A stock 99mTc-EC20 solution containing 100<br>
ug of agent per milliliter was prepared on the day of use, and its radiochemical purity<br>
was &gt; 96%. The two additional 99mTc~chelating agents, 99mTc-EC14 and 99mTc-EC28<br>
as well as 111In-DTPA-folate were also prepared to &gt; 90% radiochemical purity. All<br>
solutions were diluted with either saline alone or a saline solution containing 100<br>
equivalents of folic acid (for competition) such that the final radiopharmaceutical<br>
concentration was 10 Âµmol/mL.<br>
Animals received an approximate 40 umol/kg i.v. dose of test article in<br>
100 ÂµL volume via a lateral tail vein during brief diethyl ether anesthesia. Four hours<br>
post-injection, animals were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation, and dissected. Selected<br>
tissues were removed, weighed, and counted to determine 99mTc distribution. CPM<br>
values were decay-corrected, and results were tabulated as % injected dose per gram<br>
of wet weight tissue.<br>
As shown in Table 3 (below), the three "folate" containing<br>
radiopharmaceuticals, 99mTc-EC14,99mTc-EC20 and 111In-DTPA-Folate,<br>
predominantly accumulated in the FR-positive tumor and kidneys, however the<br>
kidneys concentrated a higher percent injected dose per gram of tissue (%ID/g) than<br>
did the tumor. Interestingly, the net tumor accumulation of 111In-DTPA-Folate and<br>
99mTc-EC20 was nearly the same (19 and 17% ID/g, respectively), whereas the tumor<br>
uptake of 99mTc-EC14 was somewhat less at ~ 10% ID/g. Nonetheless, all three<br>
agents displayed high tumor to blood ratios (&gt; 30 to 1).<br><br><br>
* Values shown represent the mean Â± s.d. of data from 3 animals.<br>
Folate-specific targeting was further demonstrated by two distinct<br>
methods. First, the accumulation of 99mTc-EC14, 99mTc-EC20 and 111In-DTPA-folate<br>
in the FR-positive tumor and kidneys was effectively blocked (&gt; 94%) when these<br>
agents were co-administered with a 100-fold excess of folic acid. Second, the 99mTc-<br>
EC28 control agent failed to appreciably accumulate in the kidneys and tumor. Both<br>
observations show that an intact "folate-like" (or pteroate) moiety is required to afford<br>
targeted uptake and retention of these radiopharmaceutical agents into FR-positive<br>
tissues.<br>
EXAMPLE 12<br>
Gamma Scintigraphy<br>
Ml09 tumor cells (1 x 106 per animal) were inoculated in the subcutis<br>
of the right axilla of Balb/c mice two weeks prior to the experiment. Animals<br>
received an approximate 50 Âµmol/kg i.v. dose of test article in 100 uL volume via a<br>
lateral tail vein during brief diethyl ether anesthesia. Four hours post-injection,<br>
animals were sacrificed by C02 asphyxiation and then placed on top of an image<br>
acquisition surface. Whole body image acquisition was performed for 1 minute at a<br>
count rate of 50-75,000 counts per minute using a Technicare Omega 500 Sigma 410<br>
Radioisotope Gamma Camera. All data were analyzed using a Medasys MS-DOS-<br>
based computer equipped with Medasys Pinnacle software.<br><br>
Uptake of 99mTc-EC20 by the FR-positive Ml09 tumors and kidneys<br>
was demonstrated using this gamma scintigraphy protocol. As shown in Fig. 9, a<br>
ventral image of a mouse injected with 99mTc-EC20 as described above localizes the<br>
gamma radiation to the two kidneys (K) and the Ml09 tumor mass (T; shoulder<br>
region). No appreciable radiotracer was observed in other body tissues. A similar<br>
image profile has been reported for the 111In-DTPA-Folate radiopharmaceutical.<br>
EXAMPLE 13<br>
Urinary Excretion and Metabolism<br>
The urinary HPLC speciation profile of 99mTc-EC20 was obtained<br>
using Balb/c mice. Mice (~20 g each) were injected with 1 mCi (6.7 nmol) of 99mTc-<br>
EC20 via a lateral tail vein. Following a 1,4, or 6 hour time period, groups of two<br>
mice were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation and urine was collected. After filtration<br>
through a GV13 Millex filter, the radiochemical speciation was assessed using an<br>
HPLC system equipped with aNova-Pak C183.9xl50 mm column and a<br>
radiochemical detector. The system was isocratically eluted with 20% methanol<br>
containing 0.1% TFA at a flow rate of 1 mL/minute.<br>
It was previously determined that the primary elimination route for<br>
111In-DTPA-Folate was via the urine. Similar to the HPLC profile shown in Fig. 2,<br>
both the 99mTc-EC20 standard and the urine samples exhibited four radioactive peaks.<br>
As shown in Table 4 (below), the radiochemical purity of the standard (sum of peaks<br>
C and D presumably corresponding to the syn and anti 99mTc-EC20) remained<br>
constant at ~ 93% over the 6 hr duration of this experiment. The amount of free 99mTc<br>
in the standard (peak A) was ~ 2%. Importantly, peak B within this radiochemical<br>
profile is believed to be EC20 chelated with 99mTc at an unconventional, less stable<br>
position, however the radioactivity measured in this fraction was not included in the<br>
overall radiochemical purity estimation for 99mTc-EC20. This data collectively<br>
indicates that the formulation remained stable in saline solution throughout this 6 hr<br>
investigation.<br>
After 1 and 4 hours post-injection into Balb/C mice, the radiochemical<br>
speciation profile of 99mTc-EC20 in the mouse urine did not change. The radioactivity<br>
present in the urine at 6 hours post-injection, however, was too low to accurately<br><br>
assay by HPLC. The proportion of parent drug among radioactive species recovered<br>
in urine remained relatively constant at approximately 90% throughout the four hours<br>
during which it could be quantitated. This value is very similar to the 93% purity of<br>
the standard indicating that 99mTc-EC20 is predominately excreted into the urine in an<br>
unmodified form.<br>
Table 4. Excretion and Metabolism of 99mTc-Ec20 from the Balb/c Mouse. Mice<br>
were injected with 1 mCi (6.7 nmol) of 99mTc-EC20 via a lateral tail vein. At the<br>
indicated times, groups of two mice were euthanized and urine was collected. The<br>
radiochemical speciation was then determined by HPLC. The area percent sum of<br>
peaks C and D (syn and anti isomers) is used to calculate the overall purity of intact<br>
99mTc-EC20.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 14<br>
Serum Protein Binding<br>
Fresh rat serum, and commercial male human serum (type AB donors,<br>
Sigma Chemical Co.) were used to evaluate in vitro binding of 99mTc~EC20 to serum<br>
proteins. One minute after 99mTc-EC20 was mixed with 1 mL of serum at room<br>
temperature, 0.3 mL of the serum solution was transferred to a clean Amicon<br>
CentrifreeÂ® ultrafiltration device (30,000 NMWL) in triplicate. Within one minute of<br>
loading the centrifuge with the serum solution, the device was spun at 1000 x g for 20<br>
minutes at 20Â°C. 50 ÂµL samples of the original solution, and of the filtrate from each<br>
device, was transferred to a clean tube and counted in an automatic gamma counter.<br>
A control solution of 99mTc~EC20 mixed with 1 mL of normal saline was ultrafiltered<br>
in an identical fashion. The percentage of free 99mTc was calculated for each of the<br>
three samples.<br>
While 99mTc-EC20 exhibited only a minor level of non-specific<br>
binding to the ultra-filtration device (~ 5%), approximately 70% of it was found to<br><br>
predominantly associate with the &gt; 30kDa serum protein fraction in solutions of rat or<br>
human serum (69% and 72%, respectively). Importantly, since 99mTc-EC20 does<br>
effectively and preferentially accumulate within FR-positive tissues (see Table 2 and<br>
Fig. 8), its apparent affinity for serum proteins does not appear to affect this<br>
radiotracer's ability to target FRs in vivo.<br>
EXAMPLE 15<br>
Tissue Distribution Studies<br>
The protocols used in this example are similar to those described in<br>
Example 11. The ability of 99mTc-EC20 to target tumors in vivo was further assessed<br>
using FR-positive Ml09 and FR-negative 4T1 tumor models. Six week-old female<br>
Balb/c mice (n = 3/dose group) were purchased from Harlan Sprague Dawley, Inc.<br>
(Indianapolis, IN) and were maintained on a folate-free diet (Harlan TEKLAD) for a<br>
total of seven days prior to tumor cell inoculation.<br>
Syngeneic, FR-positive Ml09 tumor cells (2 x 106 Po per animal) or<br>
FR-negative 4T1 cells (5 x 105 Po per animal) were inoculated subcutaneously in 100<br>
Âµl of folate-free RPMI-1640 containing 1% syngeneic mouse serum. A stock 99mTc-<br>
EC20 solution containing 100 Âµg of agent per milliliter was prepared on the day of<br>
use as described above.<br>
Sixteen days after tumor cell inoculation, the animals were injected<br>
intravenously with 500 or 1800 nmoles/kg of EC20 for Ml09 tumor-bearing animals<br>
and 500 nmoles/kg of EC20 for 4T1 tumor-bearing animals (3 mice per dose group).<br>
All injections were in 100 ul volumes. Four hours post-injection, animals were<br>
sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation, and blood was collected by cardiac puncture and the<br>
animals were dissected. Selected tissues (heart, lungs, liver, spleen, kidney,<br>
intestines, stomach, muscle, and tumor) were removed, weighed, and counted in an<br>
automatic gamma counter to determine 99mTc distribution. Uptake of the<br>
radiopharmaceutical in terms of percentage injected dose of wet weight tissue (%<br>
ID/g) was calculated by reference to standards prepared from dilutions of the injected<br>
preparation.<br>
As shown in Fig. 11, folate receptor-specific targeting was<br>
demonstrated because 99mTc-EC20 predominantly accumulated in the FR-positive<br><br>
Ml09 tumors and kidneys, and not in the FR-negative 4T1 tumors. Uptake in the FR-<br>
negative 4T1 tumors was 7.6-fold lower than in the FR-positive M109 tumors.<br>
Uptake of 99mTc-EC20 in normal tissues, except kidney as expected, was low. These<br>
results show that 99mTc-EC20 targeting is FR-specific.<br>
EXAMPLE 16<br>
Tissue Distribution Studies<br>
The protocols used in this example are similar to those described in<br>
Example 11. The ability of 99mTc-ECll (peptide-A1), 99mTc-EC13 (peptide-A3), and<br>
99mTc-EC14 (peptide-A2) to target tumors in vivo was assessed using the FR-positive<br>
KB tumor model. Four week-old male nude mice (n = 4/group) were maintained on a<br>
folate-free diet for a total of ten days prior to tumor cell inoculation.<br>
FR-positive KB tumor cells (0.25 x 106 per animal) were inoculated<br>
subcutaneously in the intracapsular region. Fourteen days after tumor cell<br>
inoculation, the animals (n = 4/group) were injected intravenously with 99mTc-ECl 1,<br>
99mTc-EC13, or 99mTc-EC14 at the doses (about 12 ug/kg) of the conjugates shown in<br>
Table 5 below. Stocks of 99mTc-ECl 1, 99mTc-EC13, and 99mTc-EC14 solutions were<br>
prepared on the day of use as described above. About a 20-fold excess of free folate<br>
(about 200 Âµg/kg) was co-administered to control animals (n = 4/group). Four hours<br>
post-injection, animals were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation, and blood was collected<br>
by cardiac puncture and the animals were dissected. Selected tissues were removed,<br>
weighed, and counted in an automatic gamma counter to determine 99mTc distribution.<br>
Uptake of the radiopharmaceutical in terms of percentage injected dose of wet weight<br>
tissue (% ID/g) was calculated by reference to standards prepared from dilutions of<br>
the injected preparation.<br>
As shown in Table 5, folate receptor-specific targeting was<br>
demonstrated because 99mTc-ECl 1,99mTc-EC13, and 99mTc-EC14 predominantly<br>
accumulated in the FR-positive KB tumors and kidneys. The accumulation was<br>
blocked by co-administration of free folate. These results show that 99mTc-ECl 1,<br>
99mTc-EC13, and 99mTc-EC14 can target tumors in vivo in a FR-specific manner.<br>
Similar results (see Table 6 below) were obtained with 99mTc-EC53<br>
(the all D-enantiomer of EC20) using similar protocols except that the dose of 99mTc-<br><br>
EC53 was about 50 Âµg/kg and about a 100-fold excess of free folate or cold EC53<br>
was used. As shown in Table 6, folate receptor-specific targeting was demonstrated<br>
because 99mTc-EC53 predominantly accumulated in the FR-positive KB tumors and<br>
kidneys. The accumulation was blocked by co-administration of free folate. These<br>
results show that 99mTc-EC53 can target tumors in vivo in a FR-specific manner.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
DISCUSSION<br>
The invention provides a conjugate of a vitamin and a radionuclide<br>
chelator for clinical development as an imaging agent. Exemplary of such an imaging<br>
agent is the newly designed, synthesized, and radiochemically characterized folate-<br>
based radionuclide chelator, 99mTc-EC20.<br>
99mTc-EC20, a small molecular weight peptide derivative of folate that<br>
contains a D-Î³-Glu peptide linkage (see Fig. 1), was synthesized using an efficient<br>
solid-phase synthetic procedure. In its natural form, folate (or pteroyl-glutamate) has<br>
a single glutamyl residue present in an L configuration. However, a D-G1U enantiomer<br>
residue was incorporated into the EC20 molecule. Importantly, similar to EC20,<br>
substitution of the L-Glu residu in not alter the<br>
ability of folic acid to bind to the high affinity FR.<br>
EC20 was found to efficiently chelate 99mTc when in the presence of Î±-<br>
D-glucoheptonate and tin (II) chloride. When analyzed by radiochemical HPLC, &gt;<br>
95% of the resulting 99mTc-EC20 formulation consisted of a mixture of syn and anti<br>
stereoisomers, each equally capable of binding to FR with high affinity (see Fig. 3).<br>
Approximately 3% of the 99mTc in the formulation was chelated to EC20 at some<br>
other site on the EC20 molecule than the expected Dap-Asp-Cys moiety. Although<br>
this component was not isolated in sufficient quantity for optimal characterization, it<br>
was shown to bind to FR with high affinity (see Fig. 6). Finally, the remaining 2% of<br>
the radioactivity in the 99mTc-EC20 formulation was attributed to free 99mTc.<br>
99mTc-EC20 demonstrated both time- and concentration-dependent<br>
association with FR-positive cells. 99mTc-EC20 was rapidly cleared from the blood<br>
(t1/2 ~ 4 min), which is important for diagnostic imaging agents, and 99mTc-EC20<br>
preferentially accumulated in large amounts within FR-positive tumors.<br>
The performance of 99mTc-EC20 was directly compared to that of a<br>
similar FR targeting agent, mIn-DTPA-Folate, using two different methods. First,<br>
both folate-based radiopharmaceuticals were found to equally compete with folic acid<br>
for binding to KB FRs (see Fig. 3 and Table 1). Second, the biodistribution of each<br>
agent in tumor-bearing mice was nearly identical (see Table 2). High tumor uptake<br>
and tumor-to-blood ratios were measured for 99mTc-EC20. Taken together these<br><br>
results suggest that like 111In-DTPA-folate, 99mTc-EC20 will effectively localize in<br>
FR-positive tumors when clinically administered to patients.<br>
Several folate-based 99mTc conjugates have previously been described.<br>
Limited biodistribution data is available on a 99mTc-12-amino-3,3,9,9-tetramethyl-5-<br>
oxa-4,8 diaza-2,10-dodecanedinoe dioxime (OXA) folate conjugate, however<br>
moderate levels (~ 7% ID/g) of tracer uptake in a KB tumor was reported. Studies<br>
involving the biodistribution of a 99mTc-ethylenedicysteine~folate conjugate in<br>
mammary tumor-bearing rats were also reported. The rats in that study were fed a<br>
folate-rich diet. Thus, low tumor uptake and low tumor-to-blood ratios were<br>
obtained. Lastly, a 99mTc-6-hydrazinonicotinamido-hydrazido (HYNIC) folate<br>
derivative (HYNIC-folate) was shown to accumulate in large amounts within 24JK-<br>
FBP tumors. Interestingly, 99mTc-EC20 accumulated within Ml09 tumors to nearly<br>
identical levels as that of HYNIC-folate in 241K-FBP tumors (~ 17% ID/g) (Table 2).<br>
These two agents also displayed roughly 50:1 tumor-to-blood ratios at 4 hours post<br>
intravenous injection.<br>
In summary, a new peptide derivative of folate was created to<br>
efficiently chelate 99mTc. This new compound, 99mTc-EC20, avidly binds to FR-<br>
positive tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. EC20, was found to bind cultured folate<br>
receptor (FR)-positive tumor cells in both a time- and concentration-dependent<br>
manner with very high affinity (KD ~ 3 nM). Using an in vitro relative affinity assay,<br>
EC20 was also found to effectively compete with 3H-folic acid for cell binding when<br>
presented either alone or as a formulated metal chelate. Following intravenous<br>
injection into Balb/c mice, 99mTc-EC20 was rapidly removed from circulation<br>
(plasma t1/2 ~ 4 min) and excreted into the urine in a non-metabolized form. Data<br>
from gamma scintigraphic and quantitative biodistribution studies performed in Ml09<br>
tumor-bearing Balb/c mice confirmed that 99mTc-EC20 predominantly accumulates in<br>
FR-positive tumor and kidney tissues. These results show that 99mTc-EC20 is an<br>
effective, non-invasive radiodiagnostic imaging agent for the detection of FR-positive<br>
tumors. Other EC20-related imaging agents were also shown to be effective,<br>
including EC11, EC13, EC14, and EC53.<br>
Each year ~ 26,000 women in the United States are diagnosed with<br>
ovarian cancer, and less than 50% of those women survive more than five years. One<br><br>
reason for the low survival rate is the difficulty in diagnosing this form of cancer.<br>
Because of the fear of rupturing an unidentified abdominal mass and the potential for<br>
spreading cancer throughout the abdominal cavity, fine needle biopsy is not often<br>
performed. Rather, the diagnosis and staging of suspicious ovarian masses is<br>
typically done through surgical laparotomy, which is an invasive and expensive<br>
procedure. Since 99mTc-EC20 binds tightly to FR present in large amounts on ovarian<br>
cancers (among others), this radiopharmaceutical provides an inexpensive, non-<br>
invasive but reliable method for the early diagnosis of malignant ovarian cancer.<br>
Importantly, 99mTc-EC20 may also help guide the clinical decision process by making<br>
possible more definitive and earlier diagnosis of recurrent or residual disease.<br><br>
