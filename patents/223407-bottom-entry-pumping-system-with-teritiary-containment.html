				<td>BOTTOM ENTRY PUMPING SYSTEM<br>
WITH TERTIARY CONTAINMENT<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to methods and structures for pumping liquids<br>
to and from a tank, and in a further embodiment relates to methods and structures<br>
for pumping liquids from a tank at cryogenic temperatures.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Conventionally, liquified natural gas (LNG) is pumped to and from a tank<br>
via a pump which has been positioned within the bottom of the tank up through a<br>
pipe to the top of the tank to a relatively expensive, complex and sizable piping<br>
and handling system that is built at considerable expense on top of the LNG tank.<br>
It is desirable to reduce the cost, complexity, size and construction time for<br>
a system used to pump LNG to and from its storage tank.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a simplified<br>
method and apparatus for pumping liquids to and from a storage tank.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a simplified method<br>
and apparatus for pumping cryogenic liquids such as LNG to and from a storage<br>
tank safely.<br>
Still another object of the invention is to provide an apparatus for pumping<br>
cryogenic liquids such as LNG to and from a storage tank safely, and more simply<br>
and less complexly than currently done, and which can be built relatively more<br>
quickly.<br>
In carrying out these and other objects of the invention, there is provided,<br>
in one form, a bottom entry pumping system for cryogenic liquids which includes<br>
a container which has an outer wall, which may be concrete and/or metal (e.g.<br>
stainless or carbon steel), and an optional inner metal liner, where the metal is<br>
rated for cryogenic temperatures. The system also has a line for transporting liquid<br>
from a liquid storage tank through the container, and a pump connected to the line<br>
for pumping liquid out of the liquid storage tank. Optionally, this line is vacuum-<br>
jacketed. The system also includes at least one cryogenic valve in the line which<br>
can be controlled from outside the container.<br>
In the case where an optional inner metal liner is not used, powdered perlite<br>
(eutectic between ferite and cementite) can be used to fill the voids between the<br>
outer wail and the equipment Another optional feature is to provide earthen dikes<br>
or berms in place around the bottom entry pumping system for further containment.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
FIG. 1 is a schematic representation of the bottom entry pumping system of<br>
this invention.<br>
It will be appreciated that the Figure is not to scale or proportion as it is<br>
simply a schematic for illustration purposes.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The invention herein employs a bottom entry pumping system for liquified<br>
natural gas (LNG) tanks in lieu of the traditional top entry pumping system, which<br>
typically requires complex piping on the tank roof. The fundamental principle of<br>
this invention is to reduce the cost associated with the traditional top entry pumping<br>
system, and also to reduce the construction schedule and delay costs associated<br>
with building a mammoth piping and handling system on top of the tanks.<br>
It will be appreciated that the bottom entry pumping system could be<br>
employed advantageously for any liquid, particularly any cryogenic liquid, LNG<br>
being simply one example. Cryogenic is defined in its normal meaning as<br>
concerning any liquid at a temperature below -100°F (-73°C). This definition of<br>
course includes, but is not limited to, other liquified gases including, but not<br>
necessarily limited to, oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, hydrocarbon gases (e.g.<br>
methane and the like) at temperatures of approximately -260°F (-162°C).<br>
The inventive bottom entry pumping system utilizes a simplified design<br>
concept for bottom entry piping to an LNG pump, for example. The piping system<br>
and the LNG pump will be contained in a concrete container or box with an optional<br>
stainless steel liner, e.g. to form a full containment design integral with the tank for<br>
the piping and the pump. If less than full containment is desired, the invention can<br>
be practiced in an embodiment without an inner liner. The container wall may thus<br>
be constructed of stainless steel, carbon steel, concrete, or a combination thereof.<br>
• The piping system may optionally utilize vacuum-jacketed pipe not<br>
used in prior LNG pumping service.<br>
• Cryogenic valves with extended bonnets and actuators or the like<br>
will be located outside the concrete container or box.<br>
• A cryogenic pump to handle the LNG, e.g., will have maintenance<br>
access outside the concrete box (on the top as shown in FIG. 1).<br>
• A stainless steel sleeve (or other suitable metal) will be seal welded<br>
to the tank inner liner and the concrete box liner and the outer jacket of the vacuum-<br>
jacketed pipe, if present, to form double containment for the LNG.<br>
• A separate box or container may be provided for each pump which<br>
will facilitate maintenance.<br>
• The concrete box or container may be provided with a nitrogen purge<br>
system to remove any hydrocarbon or other flammable vapor from the container.<br>
• The box or container will be provided with maintenance access to<br>
maintain equipment inside the box or container.<br>
More particularly referring to FIG. 1, the bottom entry pumping system<br>
generally referred to as 19 includes a container 12 optionally placed into the earth<br>
13, which container 12 has at least an outer concrete wall 14 and an optional inner<br>
metal liner 16. Where the bottom entry pumping system 10 is designed and built to<br>
pump cryogenic liquids, e.g. LNG, the inner metal liner 16, if present, should be<br>
rated for the cryogenic temperatures expected. In a non-limiting example, the inner<br>
metal liner 16 may be made of metals including, but not necessarily limited to,<br>
stainless steel, 9% nickel iron or any other material rated for cryogenic temperatures<br>
and combinations thereof.<br>
Also present in the bottom entry pumping system 10 is a line 18, optionally<br>
vacuum-jacketed, for transporting liquid from a liquid storage tank 20 through the<br>
container 12. A pomp 22 is connected to the vacuum-jacketed line 18 for pumping<br>
liquid out of the liquid storage tank 20 via pump line 24. There is also provided at<br>
least one first cryogenic valve 26 in the vacuum-jacketed line 18 which can be<br>
controlled from outside the container 12. In a non-limiting example, cryogenic<br>
valve 26 is a butterfly valve with extended bonnet 28 or other actuator.<br>
It is expected that the optionally vacuum-jacketed line 18 joins the liquid<br>
storage tank 20 near the bottom of the tank 20. By "near the bottom of the tank<br>
20", it is meant as close to the bottom as practical up to a distance or height where it<br>
would be impractical or unwise to have such a connection made.<br>
The bottom entry pumping system 10 may further include an equalizing<br>
vent line 30 in the vacuum-jacketed line 18 to the liquid storage tank 20 for venting<br>
LNG back to the tank 20 or equalizing pressures therein. In this case there is<br>
provided a second cryogenic valve 32 with extended control bonnet 33 (or other<br>
actuator) in the vacuum-jacketed line 18 between the equalizing vent line 30 and the<br>
pump 22. The equalizing vent line 30 will typically be provided with a valve 34.<br>
Container 12 may also be provided with an inert gas purge line 36 to permit<br>
the container to be purged with an inert gas such as nitrogen or the like in a non-<br>
limiting example.<br>
In most cases, it is expected to be desirable to provide a sleeve 38 around<br>
the vacuum-jacketed line 18 where the line enters the container 12 from the tank<br>
20. The sleeve 38 may also be made of a metal rated for cryogenic temperatures, as<br>
described above. The stainless steel sleeve 38 (or other suitable metal) will be seal<br>
welded to the tank metal inner liner 40 aad the inner metal liner 16 and the outer<br>
jacket of the vacuum-jacketed pipe 18 to form at least double containment for the<br>
LNG, or other cryogenic liquid, in one non-limiting embodiment.<br>
It is anticipated that in some embodiments a separate box or container 12<br>
may be provided for each pump 22 for the tank 20 which will facilitate<br>
maintenance and isolation of the equipment Alternatively, it may be desirable to<br>
place more than one pump 22 in a container 12 in some instances.<br>
It is believed that the inventive design will reduce cost and schedule time for<br>
installation of the pumping system. For example, it is estimated that the cost<br>
savings will range between two and five million dollars per tank, although, of<br>
course, this will depend on the size of the tank and the number and size of the<br>
pumps required and specified. It is also expected that this invention will provide a<br>
bottom entry pumping system which will meet National Fire Protection Agency<br>
(NFPA) 59A requirements in the full containment embodiment (which includes the<br>
inner metal liner 16). If full containment is not required, the design can be further<br>
optimized and reduced in complexity by elimination of the inner metal liner. Perlite<br>
may be optionally used to fill the space between the equipment and the outer wall<br>
14, in the event no inner metal liner 16 is employed. Perlite may also be used to fill<br>
the space between the equipment and inner metal liner 16, when present, if desired.<br>
In one preferred, optional embodiment, both a periite fill and an inert gas purge may<br>
be used together. In another, optional feature, earthen dikes or berms (not shown)<br>
may be put in place around the bottom entry pumping system 10 for further<br>
containment.<br>
In the full, tertiary containment embodiment, the liquid being pumped is<br>
contained by at least three barriers: (1) the optional vacuum-jacketed line 18, (2)<br>
the inner metal liner 16, and (3) the concrete walls 14 of the container 12. The<br>
method and apparatus of this invention are expected to reduce cost and schedule<br>
time for constructing LNG pumping systems, particularly with the advantage of<br>
permitting construction on grade level.<br>
In the foregoing specification, the invention has been described with<br>
reference to specific embodiments thereof, and has been demonstrated as effective<br>
in providing structures and procedures for pumping liquids, particularly cryogenic<br>
liquids, from storage tank. However, it will be evident that various modifications<br>
and changes can be made thereto without departing from the broader scope of<br>
the invention as set forth in the appended claims. Accordingly the specification is<br>
to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense. In an additional<br>
instance, a different valve control mechanism other than cryogenic butterfly<br>
valves with extended bonnets may be used.<br>
