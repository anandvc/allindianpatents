The invention relates to an apparatus having a component, which may mechanically vibrate, wherein the mechanical vibration is undesirable and is therefore to be damped.<br>
One example of such an apparatus is brakes.  Although the invention is described below with regard to brakes, the invention may also be used in other apparatuses. Mechanical vibrations occur particularly in apparatuses, in which moving parts rub against one another and set the system into undesired vibrational states.<br>
Said phenomenon has long been familiar in brakes. Mechanical vibrations in brakes, such as e.g. disk brakes or also drum brakes, frequently lead to highly undesirable sound radiation, so-called "brake squealing" .  For some time attempts have been made to theoretically elucidate the causes of brake squealing and combat them through practical measures.<br>
Thus, US patent 974549, for example, proposes the provision of drill holes in steel wheels, gears or also other wheels in order to interrupt a vibration transmission path.  In addition, it is proposed that a vibration-damping material, such as lead, be disposed in the bores.<br>
US patent 1572680 sets out to reduce noise generation in a drum brake by providing the anchor plate in a specific region with recesses or openings, which are filled with a specific material selected so as to inhibit vibrations of the anchor plate.<br>
GB-PS 1381589 sets out to prevent undesirable noise generation in a fixed-caliper disk brake by using a mass coupling to relocate centres of gravity.<br>
Prior art also includes the proposal from DE 195 05 000 Al,<br><br>
in the case of a floating frame brake, to dampen vibrations of the frame by providing a "vibration absorber" surrounded by silicone oil.<br>
US-PS 4445594 sets out to avoid vibrations by fastening and supporting the outer brake pad of a partially lined floating-caliper disk brake via rubber elements in the bridge fingers.<br>
JP-A 59-200819 also teaches that the bridge fingers of a disk brake be provided with vibration dampers.  The vibration dampers are made of rubber or a plastics material and steel masses are moreover purposefully attached.  By virtue of different natural frequencies of the bridge, on the one hand, and of the said masses, on the other hand, an attempt is made to combat vibration of the system and/or of its components.<br>
EP-A 0 592 290 sets out to dampen vibrations in disk brakes by bracing a clamping wedge, on the one hand, with a side wall of the housing of the disk brake and, on the other hand, with a flange of the axle, to which the disk brake is fastened.  In. addition, an elastomeric layer may be provided between the clamping wedge and the side wall.<br>
Further attempts of an extremely diverse nature at preventing undesirable mechanical vibrations in brakes are described e.g. in WO95/19508, EP 0 456 301 Bl, EP 0 455 299 Bl and DE-GM 7801919.<br>
For the suppression of vibrations in an internal combustion engine, EP 0 470 064 A2 discloses a device comprising a piezoelectric sensor element, which detects structure-borne sound vibrations, and an actor element, which generates structure-borne sound vibrations in phase opposition.  In said case, signals of the sensor elements are supplied to the actor element via an automatic electronic control<br><br>
device, which also comprises an amplifier module for the supply of external energy.<br>
Reference is also made to U.S. 5,032,753, U.S. 5, 687,813, EP 0 811 782 and U.S. 5,315,203. US '753 discloses to adjust the resonance frequency of an elastic member by measuring vibrations of the elastic member by means of a first piezoelectric transducer, supplying signals of the first piezoelectric transducer representing vibrations of the elastic member to a control circuit, generating by the control circuit control signals for driving a second piezoelectric transducer and supplying the control signals to the second piezoelectric transducer in order to generate by means of the second piezoelectric transducer vibrations acting on the elastic member that adjust its resonance frequency.<br>
US 753 does not disclose directly application of a voltage generated by the first piezoelectric transducer to the second piezoelectric transducer. It also does not disclose adjustment of the phase of the voltage generated by the first piezoelectric transducer by means of an inductor. It also does not disclose that signals generated by a piezoelectric element are applied to the same piezoelectric element.<br>
US '818 discloses a vibration damper for use in a disc brake. The vibration damper includes vibration detecting means providing signals representing detected vibrations, a control circuit receiving signals from the vibration detecting means and for adjusting the signals to produce vibrating signals, and vibration imparting means receiving the vibrating signals and generating vibrations canceling out the vibrations detected by the vibration detecting means.<br>
US'818 does not disclose direct application of signals from the vibration detecting means to the vibration imparting means. It also does not disclose adjustment of the phase of signals from the vibration detecting means by an inductor. It also does not disclose that signals generated by a piezoelectric element are applied to the same piezoelectric element.<br>
EP '782 discloses a vibration damper comprising a vibration detector for detecting vibrations and a vibrator for applying a vibration force damping the detected vibration. The vibration detector and the vibrator are operated separately from each other, wherein detected vibration representing signals of the vibration detector are supplied to a control circuit. The control circuit adjusts the received signal and controls, based on the adjusted signal, the vibrator to generate an appropriate vibration force.<br><br>
EP782 does not disclose to directly apply signals of the vibration detector to the vibrator. It also does not disclose to adjust the phase of signals of the vibration detector by means of an inductor. It also does not disclose that signals generated by a piezoelectric element are applied to the same piezoelectric element.<br>
US '203 discloses a passive damping system including two piezoelectric elements. One of the piezoelectric elements serves as vibration detecting means while the other piezoelectric element serves as vibrator. The piezoelectric elements are electrically coupled in an opposite phase relation such that the signals generated by the vibration detecting piezoelectric element drive the other piezoelectric element to generate vibrations compensating the detected vibrations.<br>
US'203 does not disclose to adjust the phase of signals of the detecting piezoelectric element. It also does not disclose that signals generated by a piezoelectric element are applied to the same piezoelectric element.<br>
As is known, piezoelectric elements may deform upon application of voltage and so, when a periodic voltage is applied, execute a mechanical vibration, i.e., for example, periodically deform. According to the invention, said mechanical vibration of said piezoelectric element is then used in such a way that it counteracts the vibration of the component of the apparatus which is to be damped. According to the fundamental rules of physics, this may occur, for example, by producing a suitable phase relationship between the mechanical vibration of the component to be damped and the deformation vibration of the piezoelectric element. In said case, the vibration of the component and the vibration of the piezoelectric element need not necessarily have the same frequency, rather a relationship between the frequencies according to whole-number multiples ("harmonic") is generally sufficient to achieve a damping effect.<br>
The refinement of the invention according a preferred embodiment offers a number of advantages. First of all, a piezoelectric element is used in order, by means of the mechanical vibration of the component to be damped, to generate the voltage which is applied to another piezoelectric element (or alternatively even the same piezoelectric element, see below) in order to produce the mechanical vibration of the<br><br>
piezoelectric element ("electrostriction") and hence dampen the undesired vibration of the component.  Such a system is self-regulating in the sense that the vibration-damping periodic vibration of the one piezoelectric element arises through voltage generation at the other piezoelectric element only when the vibration-endangered component of the apparatus actually vibrates (which need not necessarily always be the case).  In said variant of the invention, the periodic electrical excitation of the vibration-damping piezoelectric element diminishes (i.e. the applied voltage reduces) or is completely interrupted when the mechanical vibration of the component to be damped diminishes or stops.  The system does not even require external energy (voltage) to become effective, although the use of external additional sources of electrical energy for amplification purposes may be provided in more complex systems.<br>
The previously described embodiment of the invention does not necessarily require two different piezoelectric elements, the teaching alternatively being realizable e.g. according to claim 1 with a single piezoelectric element, which both generates a voltage piezoelectrically as a result of being acted upon by the mechanically vibrating component of the apparatus and is suitably excited by said generated voltage itself with such phase displacement that it continues to vibrate in a state, in which it damps the mechanical vibration of the component of the apparatus.  In said embodiment of the invention, therefore, the piezoelectric element vibrates in two states (modes) -. firstly, it is periodically deformed by the mechanical. vibration of the component to be damped and so, because of the piezoelectric effect, periodically generates a voltage and, secondly, said voltage itself, optionally after suitable phase displacement and/or modulation, is re¬applied for the purpose of electrical excitation to the same piezoelectric element in order to set the latter into a state of electrostrictive periodic mechanical vibration,<br><br>
as a result of which the mechanical vibration of the component of the apparatus is damped.  Here too, as described above, the damping is self-regulating: if no component of the apparatus is vibrating, there is also no piezoelectric voltage generated and, conversely, also no electrostrictive vibration generated for damping (with the result that an undesired vibration triggered by the piezoelectric crystal itself is avoided).  Said self-regulation of the system is proportional, i.e. the quantity of the damping vibration of the crystal depends upon the quantity of the undesired mechanical vibration of the component of the apparatus which is to be damped.<br>
According to a preferred refinement of the invention it is provided that by means of an inductor a phase relationship is adjusted between the generated periodic voltage and the voltage applied for damping purposes.<br>
A further preferred refinement of the invention provides that at least one piezoelectric element is inserted as a capacitive element in at least one resonant electric circuit, and that said resonant circuit has a resonant frequency, which is tuned to the mechanical vibration frequency which is to be damped.<br>
In said case, at least two piezoelectric elements are preferentially connected either in parallel or in series in a resonant circuit having an inductor in such a way that the resonant frequency of said resonant circuit is substantially tuned to the mechanical vibration frequency of the component to be damped.  In said case, in the previously described sense the one piezoelectric element may because of the piezoelectric effect generate a voltage, which is applied to the other piezoelectric element in order on the basis of electrostriction (i.e. the reverse piezoelectric effect) to effect mechanical vibration of said piezoelectric element and hence damping of the<br><br>
vibration of the component of the apparatus.  The piezoelectric elements therefore operate reciprocally (crosswise) and are identical in their functions.<br>
The invention relates not only to apparatuses of the type discussed here but also to methods of damping components in apparatuses, wherein the method realizes the previously described teachings.<br>
As has already been mentioned above, the particularly preferred field of application of the invention is brakes, in particular disk brakes, such as floating-caliper or floating-frame brakes, or alternatively drum brakes.<br>
In said case, it is preferentially provided that the brake is a floating-caliper or floating-frame brake and that the component, which may generate noises, is a pad carrier and/or a part of the caliper, such as a bridge finger.<br>
In said case, it is preferentially provided that at least one piezoelectric element acts between the pad carrier and a part of the caliper and/or frame of the brake.<br>
Preferentially, at least two piezoelectric elements are disposed in such a way that they are spaced apart from one another in peripheral direction of the brake (i.e. in the direction of rotation of the brake disk; i.e. tangentially).  In said case, in relation to a radial centre plane of the disk brake the preferred arrangement may be one piezoelectric element on the run-in side and another piezoelectric element on the run-out side of the brake.  Measurements have shown that with such an arrangement in a disk brake a particularly effective damping of the mechanical vibrations of the system is achievable.<br>
As explained above, preferred refinements of the invention<br><br>
provide that the piezoelectric element or the piezoelectric elements are inserted in an electric circuit in order to transmit voltages and give rise to the described feedback effect.  For phase-angle adjustment an inductor, i.e. a component with an inductive effect, may in said case be provided in the electric circuit.  According to a preferred refinement of the invention, the inductor may be integrated directly in a component of the brake, e.g. the component to be damped, or alternatively mounted on such a component of the brake, e.g. in the immediate vicinity of the piezoelectric element, so that it may be mounted together with the latter.<br>
Given the use of two or more piezoelectric elements in a resonant circuit, the latter is preferentially tuned in such a way that the damping effect of at least one of the piezoelectric elements is at its maximum in the region of a mechanical vibration frequency of the component of the apparatus which is mainly to be damped.<br>
In a brake, the at least one piezoelectric element is preferentially disposed in the force flux of a brake application force of the brake because the friction-induced vibrations arise in said force flux path and hence may also be effectively damped there.<br>
The invention may be realized not only generally in apparatuses and in particular brakes of the described type but also in individual parts of such apparatuses and/or brakes, such as the following.<br>
Thus, a brake pad for a disk brake may comprise a piezoelectric element for vibration damping purposes.  In said case, the piezoelectric element or elements may be fastened to, or integrated in, the carrier plate of the brake pad.  It is even possible to design the carrier plate of the brake pad as a whole as a piezoelectric element or<br><br>
to fashion a part of the carrier plate as a piezoelectric element.<br>
Analogous applications of the inventive idea described above for brake pads are possible in the case of brake shoes for drum brakes, actuating pistons for brakes, brake carriers for disk brakes and anchor plates for drum brakes, which may therefore be in each case entirely or partially of a piezoelectric design or may comprise one or more piezoelectric elements.<br>
To achieve effective damping of the mechanical vibration of the component of the apparatus or of the components of the apparatus, according to a further preferred refinement of the apparatus according to the invention it is provided that at least one piezoelectric element is disposed close to an antinode of the mechanically vibrating component.  An antinode in the present context is a point, at which the mechanically vibrating component vibrates at maximum amplitude.  An anti-periodically vibrating piezoelectric element acting at said point produces a particularly high damping effect.<br>

Figure 1 shows as an- embodiment an apparatus, in which the<br><br>
mechanical vibration of a component is damped, namely a partially lined floating-caliper disk brake 10 comprising a brake disk 12 and a caliper 14.  In a known manner, during braking the brake disk 12 is clamped in between two brake pads 14a, 16a.  The brake pads 14a, 16a are fastened to pad carrier plates 16, 18 made of metal.  During braking, an actuating piston (cf. Fig. 8, 20a) is moved axially in a cylinder 20.  The caliper 14 engages with two bridge fingers 22, 24 over or behind the indirectly actuated pad carrier 16 in a known manner.<br>
Disposed according to Figure 1 between the bridge fingers 22, 24 and the pad carrier plate 16 are two force sensors 26, 28 which measure, in each case, the forces acting in axial direction (in the usual parlance, axially in relation to the axis of the disk brake and/or the direction of the brake application force).  Disposed at the outside of the bridge fingers 22, 24 are acceleration sensors 30, 32.  The previously described arrangement is used for measurement purposes.  An embodiment of an apparatus fashioned according to the invention is obtained when in the previously described arrangement the two force sensors<br>
26, 28 are replaced by piezoelectric elements.  This is explained further below.  First of all, with regard to the measurements using the arrangement according to Figure 1:<br>
The measured values of the two acceleration sensors 30, 32 are input via (charge) amplifiers 34, 36 and a low-pass filter 42 into a computer 44 for evaluation.<br>
In a corresponding manner, measured values of the two force sensors 26, 28 are also input via the low-pass filter 42 into the computer 44 for evaluation.<br>
Figure 2 shows the results measured by the acceleration sensors 30, 32 during a braking operation.  In Figure 2, the time in milliseconds is plotted on the x-axis and the.<br><br>
measured acceleration a is plotted on the y-axis.  The system of pad carrier plate 16 and bridge fingers vibrates in said case at a frequency f = 2500 Hz.  Damping is not yet provided.  In Figure 2 a thick line A represents the acceleration at the run-out-side bridge finger and a thinner curve E represents acceleration at the run-in-side bridge finger.  If in Figure 1 the brake disk 12 moves from right to left, the bridge finger 22 would be at the run-in side and the bridge finger 24 at the run-out side.<br>
The acceleration a in Figure 2 shows a periodic vibration at 2500 Hz, i.e. clearly in the range audible to the human ear.  According to the measurements of Figure 2, the two bridge fingers present identical-frequency vibrations which are in phase opposition.<br>
Figure 3 shows over the same time scale the forces F, which are effective at the bridge fingers and measured by the force sensors 26, 28.  The curve A illustrated by a bold line again shows the measurement results at the run-out¬side bridge finger and the finer curve E the measurement results for the run-in-side bridge finger.<br>
Figures 2 and 3 therefore show the mechanical vibration of components of the system "brake" which is to be damped.<br>
For said purpose, in the arrangement according to Figure 1 the two force sensors 26, 2 8 are replaced by piezoelectric elements.  This is illustrated by way of example in Figures 8 to 10.  The piezoelectric elements 46, 52 shown there replace the force sensors 26, 28.  Further particulars of the disk brake according to Figure 8 are described further below.<br>
The two piezoelectric elements thus used instead of the force sensors 26, 2 8 in the arrangement according to<br>
Figure 1 are electrically connected via a switch 38.  The<br><br>
electric circuit of the two piezoelectric elements and the switch 38 moreover contains an inductor (L) 40.  Figure 6B shows the block diagram (wherein it is necessary to imagine the switch 38 added to the circuit) .<br>
Figure 4 shows measurement results given the use of the previously described piezoelectric elements.  The acceleration sensors 30, 32 once more measure the accelerations at the bridge fingers 22, 24.  At the time 0 on the y-axis according to Figure 4 the switch 38 is closed during a braking operation.  Figure 4 shows that before the time "0" the bridge fingers vibrate strongly at the illustrated amplitudes of the acceleration a.  The basis for said measurement is a frequency of the mechanical vibration of f = 4000 Hz.  The inductance L is 61 mH.<br>
As soon as the switch 38 is closed at the time "0", the piezoelectric elements 46, 52 come into damping effect, as Figure 4 reveals.  One piezoelectric element is periodically compressed by the mechanical vibration between the pad carrier plate 16 and the bridge fingers 22, 24 and hence piezoelectrically generates a periodic voltage of identical frequency.  Said periodic voltage is applied to the other piezoelectric element so that the latter, because of the reverse piezoelectric effect, starts to mechanically vibrate, i.e. periodically expands and contracts.  By said means the vibration of the system of pad carrier plate 16 and bridge fingers is damped.  As Figure 4 shows, the shrinkage falls almost completely away in less than 0 .1 sec.<br>
Figure 5 shows the measured piezoelectric voltage U.  As soon as the switch 38 is closed at the time "0", the voltage U across the two piezoelectric elements 46, 52 also falls to negligibly low values in much less than 0.1 sec, which indicates that the self-damping effect of the two cross-connected and reciprocally acting piezoelectric<br><br>
elements is highly effective.<br>
Figures 6A and 6B show block diagrams of possible electric circuits, according to which two piezoelectric elements having the capacitances Ci and C2 as well as the inductor<br>
L (40) may be connected; in each of said Figures the total capacitance and also the resonant frequency fo are indicated.  The capacitances and inductances are preferentially selected in such a way that the resonant frequency of the resonant circuit corresponds to the mechanical vibration to be damped or is at least in a whole-number ratio thereto.<br>
Figure 7 shows the advantage of such a tuning of the electrical resonant frequency of the resonant circuit comprising the piezoelectric elements to the frequency of the mechanical vibration of the system which is to be damped.  In Figure 7 a coupling factor k is plotted on the y-axis and the frequency is plotted on the x-axis.  The coupling factor k is a measure of how strong the coupling, and hence the damping effect, of the two piezoelectric elements is.  The bottom curve extending substantially at the value 0.3 illustrates the situation where the two piezoelectric elements 46, 52 are connected to one another directly without an intermediate inductor.  The top curve with a maximum at approximately 600 Hz illustrates the situation where an inductor of 900 mH is connected to the system and so a resonant circuit is formed, the resonant frequency of which is around 600 Hz.  In said case, the coupling factor in the resonant situation dramatically increases (to values of around 2).  Thus, by operating the resonant circuits according to Figures 6A and 6B in the resonant range and by tuning the resonant frequency fo of the resonant circuit to the mechanical vibration frequency which is to be substantially prevented, an intrusive vibrating of components of the brake may be effectively prevented.<br><br>
Figure 8 shows particulars of ct partially lined floating-caliper disk brake 10, a description of the conventional design of which has already been given above.  According to Figures 8, 9 and 10 two piezoelectric elements 46, 52 are disposed between the indirectly actuated pad carrier<br>
plate 16 and the bridge fingers 22, 24, and namely in such a way that the force flux is transmitted from the bridge fingers via the piezoelectric elements to the pad carrier plate.  The piezoelectric elements are clamped in between small metal plates 48, 50, which in each case are curved concavely at the outside and engage into corresponding convex troughs in the bridge finger and the pad carrier plate respectively.  Figure 10 shows by way of example two troughs 54, 56 in the pad carrier plate 16.<br>
According to Figure 8 the engagement between the piezoelectric element and the component, the vibration of which is to be damped, may also be effected indirectly, i.e. for example, via an intermediate component such as the small metal plates shown here.<br>
As Figures 8 to 10 reveal, the two piezoelectric elements 46, 52 are disposed approximately at the height of the effective centre of the brake application force (corresponding to the axis A according to Figure 8) in such a way that one piezoelectric element is disposed at the run-in side and the other piezoelectric element at the other side, i.e. at the run-out side.<br>
Figures 11 and 12 show modifications of the embodiment according to Figures 9 and 10.  The piezoelectric elements 46' and 52' are disposed in cylindrical recesses in the pad carrier plate 16'.  Inductors 58, 60 are likewise mounted directly on the pad carrier plate 16', namely with the aid of bearing disks 62, 64, which in the illustrated embodiment are made of plastics material, e.g.<br><br>
polyoxymethylene.  The inductors 58, 60 take the form of helical windings.<br>
The illustrated arrangements of piezoelectric elements according to Figures 8 to 12 may be connected in various ways.  Each of the piezoelectric elements may be connected separately as an individual subassembly to an inductor so as to form an independent resonant circuit, wherein the mechanical vibration of the brake acting upon the piezoelectric element generates a voltage, which by means of the inductor reacts in such a way upon the piezoelectric element that the reverse piezoelectric effect (i.e. the mechanical vibration of the piezoelectric element as a result of the applied voltage) effects damping in the sense described above.<br>
On the other hand, the two (or more) piezoelectric elements may alternatively form part of a common resonant circuit, as described above.<br>
In the illustrated embodiments, the resonant circuits comprising the piezoelectric elements do not require any external energy.  It is however alternatively possible to amplify the piezoelectric voltages using auxiliary electronic means.<br>
It is also possible to make the inductances and capacitances used in the electric circuits adjustable by way of adaptation to the system provided in each case.<br>
For a given apparatus, such as e.g. an actual disk brake, the performance data, in particular the capacitances, of the piezoelectric elements to be used and the inductances are optimized experimentally using an arrangement according to Figure 1 and are then correspondingly used for the given system.  For optimum tuning of the frequencies and optimization of the damping it may be necessary to provide<br><br>
dditional capacitors and/or inductors and/or resistors in the resonant circuits.<br>
Coupling losses between the piezoelectric elements may be compensated by external energy.<br>
It is also possible for a plurality of piezoelectric elements to be connected in each case in such a way that the piezoelectric voltages generated in them are coupled (superimposed) and that said coupled voltages are applied in each case to the same or further piezoelectric elements in order to achieve the damping by means of the reverse piezoelectric effect.<br><br><br>
