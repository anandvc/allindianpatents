				<td>A Connector, A Connector Assembly And An Assembling Method Therefor<br>
The present invention relates to a connector provided with a connection detecting function, to a respective connector assembly and to an assembling method therefor.<br>
A connector provided with a connection detecting function is known from Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. H10-41018. This connector is provided with a pair of connector housings connectable with each other, wherein one connector housing includes a lock arm that is resiliency deformable downward in the process of connecting the two connector housings and resiliently restored to engage the other connector housing when the two connector housings reach a properly connected state. Below the lock arm is provided a first detecting terminal that is resiliently deformed downward by being pressed by the lock arm upon connecting the two connector housings and is resiliently restored as the lock arm is resiliently restored to free the first detecting terminal from the pressed state.<br>
The other connector housing includes a second detecting terminal to be inserted into the one connector housing upon connecting the two connector housings. This second detecting terminal is set such that it cannot be brought into contact with a touching portion of the first detecting terminal in a partly connected state of the two connector housings where the lock arm presses and resiliently deforms the first detecting terminal and can be brought into contact<br>
with the touching portion in a properly connected state of the two connector housings where the first detecting terminal is resiliency restored by being freed from the pressed state by the lock arm.<br>
The partly connected state of the two connector housings can be detected by the second detecting terminal not touching the first detecting terminal and the properly connected state of the two connector housings can be detected by the second detecting terminal touching the first detecting terminal to establish an electrical connection.<br>
However, since foreign matters are likely to attach to the outer surface of the above first detecting terminal having oil during press working attached thereto, there is a likelihood that the two connector housings are connected with the foreign matters attached to the contact portion. Then, when the second detecting terminal is brought into contact with the touching portion, the foreign matters hinder the electrical connection. Thus, even if the two connector housings are already properly connected, it cannot be detected, thereby reducing the reliability of the connection detecting function. In order to avoid such a situation, foreign matters may be removed from the touching portion before the two connector housings are connected. However, such an operation of removing the foreign matters takes a very long time and is cumbersome and overall operability is poor,<br>
The present invention was developed in view of the above situation and object thereof is to provide a connector and connector assembly having an improved operability.<br>
This object is solved according to the invention by the features of the independent claims. Preferred embodiments of the invention are subject of the dependent claims.<br>
Accordingly, operability of the connector or connecting operation is improved by enabling foreign matters to be easily removed from a touching portion of a mating detecting terminal and ensuring the reliability of a connection detecting function.<br>
According to the invention, there is provided a connector, comprising:<br>
a connector housing connectable with a mating connector housing,<br>
a detecting terminal that is provided in the connector housing, cannot be brought into contact with a touching portion formed at a mating detecting terminal provided in the mating connector housing in a partly connected state of the connector housing with the mating connector housing, and can be brought into contact with the touching portion in the properly connected state of the connector housing with trie mating connector housing,<br>
wherein:<br>
it can be detected that the connector housing is partly connected to the mating connector housing by the detecting terminal being not electrically connected to the mating detecting terminal, and it can be detected that the connector housing is properly connected to the mating connector housing by the contact of the second detecting terminal with the mating detecting terminal to establish an electrical connection, and<br>
the connector housing includes at least one slide contact portion that is provided before a contact portion of the detecting terminal, which can be held in<br>

a detecting terminal that is provided in the connector housing, cannot be brought into contact with a touching portion formed at the mating detecting terminal in a partly connected state of the two connector housings, and can be brought into contact with the touching portion in the substantially properly connected state of the two connector housings,<br>
wherein:<br>
it can be detected that the two connector housings are partly connected by the detecting terminal and mating detecting terminal being not electrically connected, and it can be detected that the two connector housings are locked in the properly connected state by the contact of the detecting terminal and the mating detecting terminal to establish an electrical connection, and<br>
the connector housing includes at least one slide contact portion that is provided before the contact portion of the detecting terminal, which can be held in contact with the touching portion, with respect to forward and backward directions and can be brought into sliding contact with the touching portion during a connecting operation of the two connector housings.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, a lock arm is provided in the mating connector housing, resiliency deformed as the two connector housings are connected, and resiliently at least partly restored when the two connector housings reach a substantially properly connected state,<br>
thereby locking the two connector housings in the substantially properly connected state,<br>
wherein the mating detecting terminal is resiliently deformed by being pressed by the lock arm as the lock arm is resiliently deformed and resiliently at least partly restored by being freed from the pressed state as the lock arm is resiliently at least partly restored, and<br>
wherein the detecting terminal cannot be brought into contact with the touching portion formed at the mating detecting terminal in the partly connected state of the two connector housings where the lock arm Is resiliently deformed to press the mating detecting terminal, and can be brought into contact with the touching portion in the substantially properly connected state of the two connector housings where the lock arm is resiliently at least partly restored to reduce or free the mating detecting terminal from the pressed state.<br>
Preferably, the slide contact portion is arranged at such a position as to be brought into contact with the touching portion before the lock arm presses the first detecting terminal in the process of connecting the two connector housings.<br>
Most preferably, the slide contact portion projects more toward the touching portion than the contact portion of the detecting terminal.<br>
According to the invention, there is further provided a method of assembling a connector assembly, in particular according to the above invention or preferred embodiment thereof, comprising the following steps:<br>
connecting a connector housing and a mating connector housing with each other, wherein a mating detecting terminal is resiliently deformable and<br>
provided in the mating connector housing, and wherein a detecting terminal is provided in the connector housing, cannot be brought into contact with a touching portion formed at the mating detecting terminal in a partly connected state of the two connector housings, and can be brought into contact with the touching portion in the substantially properly connected state of the two connector housings,<br>
detecting that the two connector housings are partly connected by the detecting terminal and mating detecting terminal being not electrically connected, and detecting that the two connector housings are locked in the properly connected state by the contact of the detecting terminal and the mating detecting terminal to establish an electrical connection, and<br>
wherein during the connecting operation of the two connector housings at least one slide contact portion that fs provided before the contact portion of the detecting terminal, is held in contact with the touching portion, with respect to forward and backward directions and is brought into sliding contact with the touching portion.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, there is provided a connector assembly, comprising:<br>
a pair of connector housings connectable with each other,<br>
a lock arm that is provided in one of the pair of connector housings, resiliency deformed as the two connector housings are connected, and resiliency restored when the two connector housings reach a properly connected state, thereby locking the two connector housings in the properly connected state,<br>
a first detecting terminal that is resiliently deformed by being pressed by the lock arm as the lock arm is resiliently deformed and resiliently restored by being freed from the pressed state as the lock arm is resiliently restored, and<br>
a second detecting terminal that is provided in the other of the pair of connector housings, cannot be brought into contact with a touching portion formed at the first detecting terminal in a partly connected state of the two connector housings where the lock arm is resiliently deformed to press the first detecting terminal, and can be brought into contact with the touching portion in the properly connected state of the two connector housings where the lock arm is resiliently restored to free the first detecting terminal from the pressed state,<br>
wherein:<br>
it can be detected that the two connector housings are partly connected by the first and second detecting terminals being not electrically connected, and it can be detected that the two connector housings are locked in the properly connected state by the contact of the first and second detecting terminals to establish an electrical connection, and<br>
the other connector housing includes a slide contact portion that is provided before the contact portion of the second detecting terminal, which can be held in contact with the touching portion, with respect to forward and backward directions and can be brought into sliding contact with the touching portion during a connecting operation of the two connector housings.<br>
Since the other connector housing includes the slide contact portion that is provided before the contact portion of the second detecting terminal with respect to forward and backward directions and can be brought into contact<br>
with the touching portion of the first detecting terminal during the connecting operation of the two connector housings, foreign matters can be removed from the touching portion by the sliding contact of the slide contact portion during the connecting operation of the two connector housings. Thus, it is not necessary to remove foreign matters extra before the two connector housings are connected. Since the touching portion having the foreign matters removed therefrom and the contact portion of the second detecting terminal are held in contact, the reliability of a connection detecting function can be ensured. Therefore, foreign matters can be easily removed from the touching portion of the first detecting terminal and the reliability of the connection detecting function can be ensured.<br>
Preferably, the slide contact portion is arranged at such a position as to be brought into contact with the touching portion before the lock arm presses the first detecting terminal in the process of connecting the two connector housings.<br>
Since the slide contact portion is brought into contact with the touching portion before the lock arm presses and resiliently deforms the first detecting terminal, the slide contact portion can be securely brought into sliding contact. Therefore, foreign matters can be more securely removed and the reliability of the connection detecting function can be securely ensured.<br>
Most preferably, the slide contact portion projects more toward the touching portion than the contact portion of the second detecting terminal.<br>
Since the slide contact portion projects more toward the touching portion than the second detecting terminal, the contact of the touching portion with the<br>
second detecting terminal before coming into contact with the slide contact portion can be prevented.<br>

Hereinafter, one preferred embodiment of the present invention Is described with reference to FIGS. 1 to 8,<br>
A connector according to this embodiment is provided with a circuit board connector housing 10 (corresponding to a preferred other connector<br>
housing) to be connected with a circuit board or the like electric or electronic equipment (such as an electrical junction box, display device, panel instrument) and female connector housings 20 {corresponding to a preferred one connector housing) connectable with this circuit board connector housing 10. Hereinafter, in the respective constructional elements, sides of the two connector housings 10, 20 to be connected along forward and backward directions FBD are referred to as front sides, and upper and lower sides in FIG, 1 are referred to as upper and lower sides.<br>
The circuit board connector housing 10 includes a receptacle 11 having an open front surface, and the inside of the receptacle 11 preferably is divided into two or more (e.g. three) parts by providing one or more, preferably a pair of partition walls 12 preferably spaced apart in width direction WD as shown in FIG. 2. One or more preferably separate female connector housings 20 are at least partly fitted into the one or more (e.g. three) divided housings 13.<br>
An engaging portion 14 engageable with a lock arm 22 of the (preferably each) female connector housing 20 projects inwardly or downward from a lateral (preferably ceiling) wall 11A of the receptacle 11 for the (preferably each) divided housing 13. A front part (preferably a substantially front half) of the inner or lower surface of each engaging portion 14 is formed into a slanted or bent surface 14A gradually sloped down or inwardly toward the back and a rear part (preferably a substantially rear half) thereof is formed into a substantially horizontal surface 14B substantially in parallel to the ceiling wall 11A and/or to the forward and backward directions FBD, as shown in FIG, 1.<br>
One or more leading end portions of one or more, preferably a plurality of terminals 15 {preferably bent in L-shape) are mounted or mountable in the circuit board connector housing 10 while at least partly projecting into the receptacle 11. Out of these terminals 15, one or more (e.g. two) terminals 15 located at most distal or uppermost positions in each divided housing 13 serve as one or more detecting terminals 15A (corresponding to a preferred second detecting terminal) that can be brought into contact with at least one shorting terminal 27 (corresponding a preferred first detecting terminal) of the female connector housing 20 to be described later. It should be noted that the other one or more terminals 15 excluding the detecting terminals 15A preferably are male terminals 15B connectable with female terminal fittings 21 provided in the female connector housing 20.<br>
Two or more, preferably a pair of detecting terminals 15A provided in each divided housing 13 project up or forward to positions located more forward than intermediate positions (preferably substantially middle positions) in forward and backward directions FBD in the receptacle 11, so that the projecting ends thereof are located more forward or project to a greater degree than those of the male terminals 15B. Leading end portions (parts projecting more forward than the male terminals 15B) of the lower surfaces of the respective detecting terminals 15A serve as contact portions 16 that can be brought into contact with touching portions 30 of the shorting terminal 27 to be described later.<br>
At least one reinforcing rib 17 is provided above or outside of each pair of detecting terminals 15A, The reinforcing rib 17 projects more forward than the detecting terminals 15A and preferably includes a substantially flat plate<br>
portion 17A at least partly extending substantially along the upper surfaces of the both detecting terminals 15A, one or more, preferably three lower wall portions 17B hanging down or projecting inwardly from the lower or inner surface of the flat plate portion 17A, and one or more, preferably three upper wall portions 17C standing up or projecting outwardly from the upper or outer surface of the flat plate portion 17A as shown in FIG. 2. The upper wall portions 17C and lower wall portions 17B preferably extend over the substantially entire length of the flat plate portion 17A in forward and backward directions FBD.<br>
The one or more lower wall portions 178 are arranged at least partly between the two or more (preferably the pair of) detecting terminals 15A and/or at one or more of the outer sides of these detecting terminals 15A, and the lower or inner surfaces thereof are located more downward or inwardly than the lower or inner surfaces of the detecting terminals 15A. The lower wall portion 17B arranged between the pair of detecting terminals 15A at least partly partitions between the detecting terminals 15A, and/or the lower wall portions 17B arranged at the opposite outer sides at least partly cover the lateral sides of the two detecting terminals 15A.<br>
The upper wall portions 17C preferably are arranged at positions substantially corresponding to the three lower wall portions 17B, Front parts (preferably substantially front halves) of the upper surfaces of the respective upper wall portions 17C are gradually sloped down or inwardly toward the front and serve as escaping portions 18 for permitting sufficient resilient deformations of the lock arm 22 Rear portions (preferably substantially rear halves) of the upper wall portions 17C have a substantially equal height in<br>
forward and backward directions FBD. Thus, clearances between the ceiling wall 11A of the receptacle 11 and the upper wall portions 17C are gradually narrowed from the front ends toward the intermediate positions {preferably the substantially middle positions) thereof, and extend from the intermediate (middle) positions with a substantially constant height.<br>
Since the respective detecting terminals 15A are to be at least partly inserted into the circuit board connector housing 10 along the lower surface of the reinforcing rib 17, upward warping thereof can be prevented. Since the rigidity of the reinforcing rib 17 itself is improved by the one or more, preferably three upper wall portions 17C and/or one or more, preferably three lower wall portions 17B, there is no likelihood of resiliency deforming the reinforcing rib 17 upward by forces of the detecting terminals 15A trying to warp. Further, at least one slide contact portion 19 is held at a specified (predetermined or predeterminable) position without shaking upward and downward.<br>
The female connector housings 20 to be at least partly fitted into the respective divided housings 13 preferably are substantially identically constructed. It should be noted that the shown female connector housing 20 is the one to be at least partly fitted into the divided housing 13 in the intermediate position or middle.<br>
Each female connector housing 20 preferably is substantially in the form of a block at least partly fittable into the corresponding divided housing 13, and the one or more female terminal fittings 21 connectable with the male terminals 15B are at least partly insertable thereinto and withdrawable therefrom.<br>
Each female connector housing 20 includes the lock arm 22 that is resiliency deformed as the female connector housing 20 is connected with the circuit board connector housing 10 and is resiliently at least partly restored when the two connector housings 10, 20 reach a substantially properly connected state, thereby locking the two connector housings 10, 20 in the properly connected state. Each lock arm 22 preferably has a cantilever shape folded back or projecting from the lateral (preferably upper) edge of the front end surface of the female connector housing 20 as shown in FIG. 1.<br>
A widthwise intermediate part (preferably a substantially widthwise middle part) of the outer or upper surface of each lock arm 22 is recessed down or inwardly preferably over the substantially entire length in forward and backward directions FBD to form a recessed portion 23. This recessed portion 23 has such a width permitting the passage of the corresponding engaging portion 14 of the receptacle 11, and a projection 24 engageable with the engaging portion 14 of the receptacle 11 projects outwardly or upward at a position of the recessed portion 23 preferably near the rear end. The front surface of each projection 24 preferably is formed into a moderately sloped surface 24A,<br>
A rear end part (part behind the projection 24) of the lower surface of the lock arm 22 serves as a pressing or operating surface 22A for pressing or operating the shorting terminal 27 to be described later down or inwardly when the lock arm 22 is resiliency deformed downward or inwardly.<br>
An operable portion 25 is provided at the rear end of the lock arm 22. Upon separating the two connector housings 10, 20, this operable portion 25 is<br>
pressed or operable to resiliency deform the lock arm 22 preferably substantially downward or inwardly, whereby the projection 24 and the engaging portion 14 are disengaged for unlocking,<br>
A terminal accommodating portion 26 capable of at least partly accommodating the shorting terminal 27 is provided below each lock arm 22. The floor surface of each terminal accommodating portion 26 preferably is substantially flat.<br>
The shorting terminal 27 to be at least partly accommodated in each terminal accommodating portion 26 is formed preferably by bending, folding and/or embossing an electrically conductive (preferably metal) plate punched or cut out into a specified (predetermined or predetenminable) shape, and includes a base portion 28 (preferably in the form of a substantially flat plate) and two or more, preferably a pair of resilient contact pieces 29 extending substantially backward from the front end of the base portion 28 as shown in FIGS. 1 and 5, Each shorting terminal 27 is to be at least partly accommodated in a stable posture in the terminal accommodating portion 26 by the presence of the base portion 28.<br>
At the rear end of the base portion 28 preferably is provided at least one protection wall 28A standing up or projecting at an angle different from 0" or 180', preferably substantially at a n'ght angle to the base portion 28 from the left, right and/or rear edges of the base portion 28. The protection wall 28A is shaped to at least partly cover rear sides of resilient contact pieces 29 as a whole, making the entrance of foreign matters toward the resilient contact pieces 29 through the rear opening of the female connector housing 20 difficult.<br><br>
The pair of resilient contact pieces 29 preferably are in the form of cantilevers whose rear ends are free ends, wherein intermediate parts (preferably substantially middle parts) thereof in forward and backward directions FBD serve as inclined portions 29A gradually inclined upward or outward toward the back and parts behind the inclined portions 29A serve as substantially horizontal portions 29B substantially in parallel to the base portion 28 and/or to the forward and backward directions FBD. One or more pressable portions 29C (preferably bent substantially into triangular shapes) and standing or projecting outward or upward are formed at or near the respective free ends (rear ends of the respective horizontal portions 29B). The pressable portions 29C are disposed at such a height as to (preferably substantially entirely) project upward or outward from the protection wall 28A, and come to be hidden inside the protection wall 28A upon being pressed by the pressing surface 22A of the lock arm 22.<br>
The touching portion 30 is provided at or near a boundary between the inclined portion 29A and the horizontal portion 29B in each resilient contact piece 29. The respective touching portions 30 preferably are substantially dome-shaped projections formed in intermediate positions (preferably substantially in the widthwise centers) of the corresponding resilient contact pieces 29.<br>
The slide contact portion 19 that can come substantially into sliding contact with the touching portions 30 during the connecting operation of the two connector housings 10, 20 is provided at or near the leading end of each reinforcing rib 17 of the circuit board connector housing 10. Each slide contact<br>
portion 19 preferably is arranged at a position right before the projecting ends of the detecting terminals 15A (position right before the contact portions 16). The slide contact portion 19 projects downward or inwardly from the lower surface of the flat plate portion 17A to preferably have the substantially same projecting distance as the lower wall portions 17B, and project more downward or inward (toward the touching portions 30) than the contact portions 16 of the detecting terminals 15A. Each slide contact portion 19 is formed preferably over the substantially entire width of the front end edge of the corresponding flat plate portion 17A, and preferably connects the front ends of the lower wall portions 17B in width direction WD to at least partly cover the front sides of the contact portions 16.<br>
The lower surface of each slide contact portion 19 serves as a slide contact surface 19A that can be brought substantially into sliding contact with the corresponding touching portions 30, and this slide contact surface 19A is located more downward or inward than the lower or inner surfaces of the contact portions 16. The respective slide contact surfaces 19A preferably are substantially in parallel to an extending direction of the reinforcing ribs 17 (direction parallel to a connecting direction CD of the two connector housings 10, 20). Further, the front bottom edges of the respective slide contact portions 19 preferably are rounded to form rounded portions 19B.<br>
The height position of the slide contact surface 19A of each slide contact portion 19 preferably is so set as to substantially correspond to intermediate positions (preferably substantially middle positions) in forward and backward directions FBD of the inclined portions 29A of the resilient contact pieces 29 of<br>
each shorting terminal 27 at least partly accommodated in a natural state in the female connector housing 20, i.e. position slightly lower than the touching portions 30 when the two connector housings 10,20 are connected.<br>
Next, functions and effects of this embodiment constructed as above are described.<br>
The one or more respective female connector housings 20 are at least partly fitted into the one or more corresponding divided housings 13 of the circuit board connector housing 10. When the female connector housing 20 is gradually pushed into the corresponding divided housing 13 while being positioned therewith, the lock arm 22 is at least partly inserted along the lateral (ceiling) wall 11A of the receptacle 11 and the engaging portion 14 of the receptacle 11 passes along the recessed portion 23 of the lock arm 22. Then, the intermediate parts (preferably the substantially middle parts) in forward and backward directions FBD of the resilient contact pieces 29 (preferably the middle parts of the inclined portions 29A in forward and backward directions FBD) of the shorting terminal 27 come into contact with (preferably the rounded portion 19B of) the slide contact portion 19. As the female connector housing 20 is further pushed in, the resilient contact pieces 29 are resiliency deformed substantially inwardly or downward by being pressed by the slide contact portion 19.<br>
When the front end of the lock arm 22 moves beyond the escaping portions 18 of the upper wall portions 17C of the reinforcing rib 17 as shown in FIG. 6, the sloped surface 24A of the projection 24 gradually come into contact with the slanted surface 14A of the engaging portion 14, whereby the lock arm<br>
22 is resiliency deformed slightly downward or inward. Further, (preferably the round portion 19B of) the slide contact portion 19 is held in sliding contact with the outer surfaces of the respective resilient contact pieces 29 from the intermediate parts (preferably the substantially middle parts) of the respective resilient contact pieces 29 in forward and backward directions FBD (preferably substantially middle parts of the inclined portions 29A) to the touching portions 30. At this time, there is a clearance between the pressing surface 22A and the pressable portions 29C of the shorting terminal 27 although the lock arm 22 is slightly deformed. In other words, the resilient contact pieces 29 are pressed only by the slide contact portion 19 before being pressed by the lock arm 22.<br>
As the connecting operation further proceeds, the touching portions 30 having reached the slide contact portion 19 advance from the front end towards or to the rear edge of the slide contact surface 19A while holding the outer surfaces thereof substantially in sliding contact with the slide contact surface 19A. If foreign matters have entered, for example, through a small clearance between the rear opening of the female connector housing 20 and the protection wall 28A of the shorting terminal 27 to adhere to the touching portions 30 of the resilient contact pieces 29, the foreign matters are abraded off from the slide contact surface 19A at this time. In this way, the outer surfaces of the touching portions 30 are substantially cleaned preferably from the front side to the rear side by the slide contact surface 19A to substantially remove the foreign matters from the outer surfaces of the touching portions 30. Further, the lock arm 22 is resiliency deformed more and more and the<br>
projection 24 passes the slanted surface 14A to reach the horizontal surface 14B.<br>
When the touching portions 30 pass over the slide contact surface 19A, the resilient contact pieces 29 try to make resilient restoring movements by as much as a height difference between the slide contact surface 19A and the lower surfaces of the detecting terminals 15A (contact portions 16). Here, as shown in FIG, 7, the lock arm 22 is resiliently deformed by the projection 24 having moved onto the engaging portion 14, and the top ends of the one or more pressable portions 29C are substantially in contact with the pressing surface 22A after the resilient contact pieces 29 are slightly resiliently restored. Since the resilient contact pieces 29 are pressed by the lock arm 22 and cannot be restored any further, the touching portions 30 are kept distanced from the contact portions 16 without reaching the contact portions 16. In this way, the contact portions 16 of the detecting terminals 15A and the touching portions 30 are not in contact in a partly connected state of the two connector housings 10, 20 where the lock arm 22 is resiliently deformed.<br>
When the projection 24 moves beyond the engaging portion 14, the lock arm 22 is resiliently at least partly restored (or further resiliently restored) to engage the projection 24 with the engaging portion 14 as shown in FIG. 8, whereby the two connector housings 10, 20 are locked in a substantially properly connected state, Further, the resilient contact pieces 29 are resiliently restored by being freed from the pressed state by the lock arm 22, and the touching portions 30 having the foreign matters removed therefrom are held substantially in contact with the contact portions 16 of the detecting terminals<br>
15A. Thus, the contact portions 16 of the detecting terminals 15A and the touching portions 30 are held substantially in contact in the property connected state of the two connector housings 10, 20 where the lock arm 22 is resiliency at least partly restored.<br>
As described above, in the partly connected state of the two connector housings 10, 20, the detecting terminals 15A are not shorted with each other since the touching portions 30 of the shorting terminal 27 are not in contact with the contact portions 16 of the detecting terminals 15A, whereby the partly connected state of the two connector housings 10, 20 can be detected. Further, in the substantially properly connected state of the two connector housings 10, 20, the touching portions 30 are held in contact with the contact portions 16 to short the detecting terminals 15A, whereby the properly connected state of the two connector housings 10, 20 can be detected.<br>
As described above, according to this embodiment, the circuit board connector housing 10 includes the one or more slide contact portions 19 that are arranged before (with respect to the connecting direction CD) the contact portions 16 of the detecting terminals 15A and can be brought substantially into sliding contact with the touching portions 30 of the shorting terminals 27 during the connecting operation of the two connector housings 10, 20. Thus, foreign matters can be removed from the touching portions 30 during the connecting operation of the two connector housings 10, 20 by the sliding contact of the slide contact portions 19. Therefore, it is not necessary to remove foreign matters extra before the two connector housings 10, 20 are connected. Since the touching portions 30 having the foreign matters substantially removed<br>
therefrom come into contact with the contact portions 16 of the detecting terminals 15A, the reliability of the connection detecting function can be ensured. Accordingly, foreign matters can be easily removed from the touching portions 30 of the shorting terminals 27 to ensure the reliability of the connection detecting function.<br>
Since the one or more slide contact portions 19 are brought substantially into contact with the touching portions 30 before the lock arms 22 press the shorting terminals 27, they can be reliably brought into sliding contact.<br>
Further, since the slide contact portions 19 project more downward or inward (toward the touching portions 30) than the contact portions 16 of the detecting terminals 15A, the contact of the touching portions 30 with the contact portions 16 before coming into contact with the slide contact portions 19 can be prevented.<br>
Accordingly, to provide a connector enabling foreign matters to be easily removed from a touching portion of a first detecting terminal and ensuring the reliability of a connection detecting function, a circuit board connector housing 10 includes one or more slide contact portions 19 that are arranged before (with respect to forward and backward directions FBD) one or more contact portions 16 of detecting terminals 15A and can be brought into contact with touching portions 30 of shorting terminals 27 during a connecting operation of two connector housings 10, 20. Foreign matters are removed from the touching portions 30 during the connecting operation of the two connector housings 10, 20 by the sliding contact of the slide contact portions 19. Thus, it is not necessary to remove foreign matters extra before the two connector housings<br>
10, 20 are connected. Since the touching portions 30 having the foreign matters<br>
removed therefrom and the contact portions 16 of the detecting terminals 15A<br>
are held in contact, the reliability of a connection detecting function can be<br>
ensured.<br><other embodiments><br>
The present invention is not limited to the above described and illustrated embodiment. For example, the following embodiments are also embraced by the technical scope of the present invention as defined by the claims.<br>
(1)	Although the slide contact portions 19 are brought into sliding<br>
contact with the touching portions 30 before the lock arms 22 press the shorting<br>
terminals 27 in the foregoing embodiment, it is sufficient that slide contact<br>
portions can be brought into contact with touching portions before being<br>
brought into contact with contact portions of detecting terminals according to<br>
the present invention and the slide contact portions may be brought into contact<br>
with the touching portions when the detecting terminals are slightly displaced by<br>
being pressed by lock arms,<br>
(2)	Although the slide contact portions  19 are  provided  at the<br>
positions right before the contact portions 16 of the detecting terminals 15A in<br>
the foregoing embodiment, they may be provided at positions distanced forward<br>
from the contact portions according to the present invention.<br>
(3)	Although the slide contact portions 19 are provided at the leading<br>
ends of the reinforcing ribs 17 in the foregoing embodiment, members including<br>
slide contact portions may be provided in addition to the reinforcing ribs according to the present invention.<br>
(4)	Although the slide contact portions 19 project more toward the<br>
touching portions 30 (downward or inward) than the contact portions 16 of the<br>
detecting terminals 15A, they may not necessarily project from the contact<br>
portions, i.e. the slide contact surfaces and the contact portions may be<br>
substantially at the same height according to the present invention.<br>
(5)	Although the lock arms 22 preferably are substantially in the form<br>
of cantilevers in the foregoing embodiment, the present invention is also<br>
applicable to seesaw-shaped lock arms.<br>
(6)	The slide contact surfaces 19A are brought into sliding contact<br>
with the touching portions 30 in the foregoing embodiment. Metal plates or<br>
plates made by rigid or hard material may be stuck to the slide contact surfaces<br>
or the slide contact portions themselves may be made of, e.g. metal or abrasice<br>
blocks. Then, the metal surfaces are brought into contact with the outer<br>
surfaces of the touching portions to obtain a so-called wiping effect, whereby<br>
oxide films or the like can be removed and the touching portions can be held in<br>
contact in a satisfactory manner.<br>
