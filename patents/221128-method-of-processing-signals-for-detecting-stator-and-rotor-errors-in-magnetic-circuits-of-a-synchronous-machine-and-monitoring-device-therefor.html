				<td>Method and device for processing signals for detecting stator and rotor errors in magnetic circuits of a synchronous machine<br>
The content of Application No PCT/CH2004/000101, filed February 25, 2004 in Switzerland is incorporated here by reference.<br>
The present invention relates to a method for processing induced voltage signals supplied by measurement turns arranged on a synchronous machine, and also to the associated device, which make it possible to detect and measure the stator and rotor errors in the magnetic circuits of said synchronous machine.<br>
In a synchronous machine with salient poles which has a large number of poles, the air gap, that is to say the space between the rotor and the stator, is extremely small with respect to the outer diameter of the rotor of the machine. For this reason, it is virtually impossible to ensure perfect centering of the rotor in the stator.<br>
Moreover, the stator has the overall shape of a hollow cylinder with a wall of very small thickness compared to the diameter of the rotor, and is fixed to the carcass of the machine at a number of anchoring points.<br><br>
2<br>
Consequently, the stator represents the smallest mechanical structure of the machine; it is therefore susceptible to deformation.<br>
A rotor of very large diameter, despite dynamic balancing, may have a residual unbalance. Moreover, this rotor consists of a large number of poles which each have a field coil. After a certain period of use of the machine, there is a risk of a partial short-circuit of one or more of these field coils.<br>
The aforementioned stator and rotor errors in the magnetic circuits give rise to a non-uniform distribution of the induction below each pole, thus creating considerable magnetic forces which may be up to several hundred tons and can cause in some cases sticking of the rotor in the stator, leading to considerable damage to the machine.<br>
In order to control these errors, most existing monitoring devices use capacitive sensors to measure the air gap of the machine at several locations on the inner periphery of the stator. These devices have two major drawbacks:<br>
-	the capacitive sensors are relatively complex and expensive<br>
in order to ensure good reliability of the measurement of the air gap,<br>
-	just measuring the mechanical air gap does not provide any<br>
indication with regard to the actual unilateral attraction force, given that the<br>
latter also depends on the currents induced in the various windings of the<br>
machine.<br>
In the publication "Luftspaltuberwachung von Vollpol-synchrongeneratoren unter Berucksichtigung paralleler Wicklungszweige", published in "Electrical Engineering Vol. 78; No. 1; Dec. 1994; pp. 29-31; by M. W, Janssen", the author proposes the use of measurement turns placed at the stator of the machine to capture the flux in the air gap so as to study the damping factor due to the damping winding and to the parallel branches of the armature winding. This study is limited to determining this damping factor and does not propose any solution for determining the actual value of<br><br>
3<br>
the eccentricity, nor the non-compensated attraction effect which results therefrom.<br>
A first object of the invention is therefore to propose an improved method for processing signals measured on the machine, which makes it possible to determine the type and value of the stator and rotor errors in the magnetic circuits.<br>
Another object of the invention is to propose an improved device for continuously monitoring and processing signals measured on the machine, which makes it possible to determine the type and value of the stator and rotor errors in the magnetic circuits.<br>
These objects are achieved by a method as described in claim 1 and by a device as described in claim 11, particular embodiments being described in the dependent claims.<br>
One particular embodiment of the method according to the invention and of the associated device according to the invention are described below, this description being given with reference to the appended drawing which comprises the following figures, in which:<br>
Fig. 1 is a sectional view of a conventional synchronous machine with salient poles,<br>
Fig. 2 shows the distribution of the induction generated by the field winding in the air gap of an ideal machine without errors,<br>
Fig. 3 shows the relative position of the rotor with respect to the stator in the case of a static eccentricity,<br>
Fig. 4 shows the relative position of the rotor with respect to the stator in the case of a dynamic eccentricity,<br>
Fig. 5 shows a machine with a deformed stator,<br>
Fig. 6 shows an example of the positioning of a measurement turn,<br>
Fig. 7 shows the signals measured at the terminals of three measurement turns,<br><br>
4<br>
Fig. 8 shows the progress of the steps of the method according to the invention,<br>
Fig. 9 shows the output signals after filtering,<br>
Fig. 10 shows the output signals after envelope extraction,<br>
Fig. 11 shows the mean values eim of the envelopes as a function of the angular position aSj of the turns,<br>
Fig. 12 shows the temporal spectrum at the output of the harmonic analysis means,<br>
Fig. 13 shows the spatial spectrum at the output of the harmonic analysis means, and<br>
Fig. 14 shows the block diagram of a device for continuously measuring a synchronous machine according to the invention.<br>
Fig. 1 is a sectional view of a conventional synchronous machine with salient poles, consisting of a stator 10 comprising a plurality of teeth 100 separated by recesses 101 and a rotor 11 equipped with field windings 12. A stator winding (not shown in this figure) is housed in the recesses 101.<br>
It can be seen that, in addition to the \/h-order fundamental = p, p being the number of pairs of poles of the machine, the induction curve has<br>
When the machine does not have any errors and is perfectly centered, the induction in the air gap of the empty machine, as shown in Fig. 2, may be expressed by a Fourier series:<br><br><br>
5<br>
higher-order harmonics due to the recessing of the stator and to the salience of the poles of the rotor.<br>
When the rotor rotates at a constant angular speed Q, the induction in the air gap as a function of the angle as in a universal set related to the stator can be written:<br><br>
The aforementioned stator and rotor errors in the magnetic circuits, regardless of whether these are mechanical such as an eccentricity or deformations or electrical such as one or more insulation errors in the field coils, give rise to a non-uniform distribution of the induction below each pole, thus creating considerable magnetic forces which may be up to several hundred tons and can cause in some cases sticking of the rotor in the stator, leading to considerable damage to the machine.<br>
Figs. 3 and 4 show the effect of poor centering of the rotor with respect to the stator, the rotor and the stator being assumed not to be deformed.<br>
Fig. 3 shows the relative position of the rotor 11 with respect to the stator 10 in the case of a static eccentricity. In this case, the center of rotation, respectively the axis of rotation 110 of the rotor, is fixed relative to the geometric center, respectively to the longitudinal axis 102 of the stator.<br>
Fig. 4 shows the relative position of the rotor 11 with respect to the stator 10 in the case of a dynamic eccentricity. In this case, the center of rotation, respectively the axis of rotation 110 of the rotor, revolves around the geometric center, respectively around the longitudinal axis 102 of the stator.<br><br>
6<br>
It should be noted that there is generally a combined eccentricity resulting from the juxtaposition of a static eccentricity and a dynamic eccentricity.<br>
Fig. 5 shows an example of a deformed stator. In this example, the stator has an essentially triangular shape with rounded sides and corners. In general, a deformed stator may have an oval shape or the shape of a rounded polygon with n sides.<br>
It can be seen that, in the examples shown in Figs. 3 to 5, the air gap of the machine is not constant but rather varies as a function of the angle as and as a function of time. This variation gives rise to a modulation of the induction in the air gap, according to the laws which will be explained below.<br>
In the general case where the bore, respectively the stator, is deformed and where the center of rotation of the rotor can move with respect to the stator, the induction in the air gap satisfies the following equation:<br><br>
: induction in the air gap of an ideal machine (machine with no errors in the magnetic circuit and with a perfectly centered rotor),<br><br>
7<br><br>
: function expressing a stator-related error (for example deformation of the bore, static eccentricity)<br>
where:<br><br>
: function expressing a rotor-related error (for example dynamic eccentricity, partial short-circuit of the coils of the field winding)<br>
where:<br><br><br>
8<br>
The image of the induction in the air gap may be captured by installing a plurality of individual measurement turns or loops which are distributed along the periphery of the stator, these individual turns each surrounding a portion of the yoke of the stator by passing successively into the air gap of the machine and into the ventilation slots, as seen in Fig. 6.<br>
Said figure shows a portion of the stator 10 comprising a number of teeth 100 separated by the recesses 101. Over the length of the stator, there are a number of ventilation slots 102 which make it possible to discharge the heat produced during operation of the machine. A measurement loop 2, in this case comprising a single turn 20, has been installed as mentioned above on this portion of the stator. A number of measurement loops 2 as above are regularly arranged around the periphery of the stator. Given that it involves measuring an induced voltage u which is said to be an image of the induction B(ors) at the measurement location, other arrangements of the measurement loop 2 may also be envisaged, for example with said loop surrounding one or more teeth 100. In this case, the induced voltage which is measured will remain an image of the induction in the air gap at this location and will not differ from the following equations or relations other than by a constant coefficient.<br>
If an arrangement as shown in Fig. 6 is followed, with the loop 2 comprising a single measurement turn and being arranged as shown, the induced voltage u at the terminals of the turn is:<br>
u = B(as).V.L [7] in which<br>
B (as). :induction in the air gap at the location of the turn<br>
V	:tangential speed of the rotor at the air gap; this speed<br>
is constant in a synchronous machine operating under<br>
normal conditions<br>
L	:axial length of the turn<br><br>
9<br>
Under these conditions, the induced voltage u at the terminals of the turn is directly the image of the induction in the air gap.<br>
If aSi is the angular position of the turn i on the periphery of the stator, the induced voltage at the terminals of this turn i is given by:<br>
By replacing the expression [6] of B(as) in [7], the following is obtained:<br><br><br>
Fig. 7 shows an example of the induced voltages u1t u2 and U3 at the terminals of three measurement turns placed at three different locations on the periphery of a stator of a machine exhibiting the particular case of a hybrid eccentricity and of a non-deformed stator.<br>
Processing of the induced voltage signals at the terminals of the measurement turns makes it possible to deduce the variation in the air gap of the machine as a function of the angle as and as a function of time.<br>
In order to be able to be processed, the signals u,, respectively u1t u2 and U3, are firstly sent to filtering means 30 which form part of processing means 3 shown in Fig. 8. These filtering means 30 have the function of<br><br>
10<br>
eliminating the harmonic components whose frequencies are greater than that of the fundamental frequency fn defined by:<br><br>
Fig. 9 shows the signals un, un and UR at the output of the filtering means 30. Assuming perfect filtering, that is to say an elimination of the harmonic components having frequencies greater than fn, the signals at the output of the filtering means are given by:<br><br>
The filtered signals uf1, uf2 and u^ are sent to envelope extraction means 31 which are shown in Fig. 8.<br>
The signals e, at the output of the envelope extraction means 31 appear in the form:<br><br>
Fig. 10 shows the signals e, representing the envelopes of the signals un at the output of the envelope extraction means 31.<br>
From equation [12], it can be seen that, for a given value aSi, £/ depends only on time.<br><br>
11<br>
The temporal mean value eim of these signals, calculated over a period of rotation of the machine, is equal to:<br><br>
Let em5 be the spatial mean value of the temporal mean values eim of all the turns installed on the periphery of the machine<br><br>
The errors related to the stator magnetic circuit are consequently determined by<br><br>
Likewise, the errors related to the rotor can be deduced from [12] and [13]:<br><br>
12<br><br>
It will be noted that the function Arfas) is the same for any of the measurement turns. Consequently, a simplified measurement device, which is able to measure only this function, respectively only an error concerning the rotor, could comprise just a single measurement turn or loop arranged at a single location on the periphery of the stator.<br>
Fig. 11 shows the mean values eim of the envelopes as a function of the angular position of the measurement turns. In the example considered here, the machine has ten measurement turns distributed regularly along the periphery of the stator.<br>
Knowing the distribution of the induction in the air gap and also the design values such as the axial length La and the bore radius R, it is easy to then determine the magnetic force F between the stator and the rotor of the machine over a portion of or over the entire bore from the magnetic pressure per unit surface a:<br><br>
Referring to Fig. 8, there can be seen all the steps of the signal processing method according to the invention. The induced voltage signals ui, as shown by way of example in Fig. 7, coming from the various measurement turns or loops 2 are individually sent to the filtering means 30 which suppress the harmonics having frequencies greater than the<br><br>
13<br>
electrical frequency of the machine, so as to deliver at the output the filtered signals ufh as shown by way of example in Fig. 9. These filtered signals are then sent to envelope extraction means 31 which supply at their output signals e, corresponding to the envelopes of the filtered signals, as shown by way of example in Fig. 10. These signals are then sent to harmonic analysis means 32 which are able to determine the mean values of the envelopes and also the temporal and spatial harmonics according to expressions [15] and [16].<br>
Fig. 12 shows an example of the temporal spectrum at the output of the harmonic analysis means 32.<br>
Fig. 13 shows an example of the spatial spectrum at the output of the harmonic analysis means 32.<br>
These results make it possible for a computer 33 to calculate the types and values of the errors of the synchronous machine and also the non-compensated radial magnetic force which results therefrom according to relations [1] to [18] given above.<br>
Thus, harmonic analysis of the function eim/ems from [15] makes it possible to determine the errors coming from the stator, whereas that of the function e/eim from [16] makes it possible to determine the errors coming from the rotor. In general, the order of the harmonic determines the type of error whereas the amplitude of the harmonic determines the amplitude of the error.<br>
In the case of analyzing stator-related errors, the presence of a 1st-order harmonic indicates a static eccentricity between the rotor and the stator, as shown in Fig. 3. The amplitude of this harmonic makes it possible to calculate a value es corresponding to the relative value of this static eccentricity with respect to the mean air gap of the machine. The presence of a higher-order harmonic indicates a deformation of the stator, as shown by way of example in Fig. 5, with a 2nd-order harmonic indicating a<br><br>
14<br>
generally elliptical shape whereas a higher-order harmonic indicates a generally polygonal shape with rounded sides and corners, the order of the harmonic indicating the number of sides of the polygon; the amplitude of this harmonic indicates the relative value of this deformation with respect to the mean air gap of the machine.<br>
In the case of analyzing rotor-related errors, the presence of a 1st-order harmonic indicates a dynamic eccentricity between the rotor and the stator, as shown in Fig. 2. The amplitude of this harmonic makes it possible to calculate a value £d corresponding to the relative value of this dynamic eccentricity with respect to the mean air gap of the machine.<br>
The presence of a higher-order harmonic indicates an error related to the excitation circuit, the amplitude of this harmonic indicating the relative value of this error with respect to the mean induction in the air gap.<br>
An eccentricity of the rotor relative to the stator gives rise to the appearance of a considerable non-compensated magnetic force. Therefore, the presence of a 1st-order harmonic, when analyzing both stator-related errors and rotor-related errors, indicates that the rotor is subject to a non-compensated magnetic force. From relations [17] and [18], it is possible to determine the value of this force, knowing the dimensions of the rotor and also the induced voltages u-, which are the images of the induction at the measurement location.<br>
Usually, analysis of the stator-related errors and rotor-related errors reveals the presence of a number of harmonics, thereby indicating the simultaneous presence of several types of error on the machine.<br>
As mentioned above, the presence of an error of one or the other of these types gives rise to a non-uniform distribution of the induction below each pole, thus creating considerable magnetic forces which may be up to several hundred tons and can cause in some cases sticking of the rotor in the stator, leading to considerable damage to the machine. Consequently,<br><br>
15<br>
the detection of one or the other of these errors may give rise to an alarm which stops the machine automatically or upon intervention by the operator.<br>
Fig. 14 schematically shows a device for continuously monitoring and measuring stator and rotor errors in the magnetic circuits of a synchronous machine using the method for processing induced voltage signals according to the invention as described above.<br>
This device comprises measurement means 2 comprising a number of measurement turns or loops 20 distributed around the periphery of the stator, signal processing means 4 according to the invention and also communication means 5 which can transmit the measurement results to outside the machine. The three aforementioned means 2, 4 and 5 are supplied with power by power supply means 6 which are able to supply the necessary power to the device, this power possibly coming from outside the machine via power supply cables or being taken directly on the machine by capturing the magnetic flux that is produced.<br>
The signal processing means 4 of the device mounted on the machine and shown in Fig. 14 may comprise one or more of the modules 30, 31, 32 and 33 shown in Fig. 8, the module or modules which are not included in the device mounted on the machine then being arranged outside the machine, after the transmission means 5.<br>
This device may be supplemented by means (mentioned above and not shown in the figure) which can generate and transmit an alarm, this alarm possibly serving to stop the machine.<br>
The installation of two identical monitoring devices as described above at each axial end of a synchronous machine furthermore makes it possible to monitor the parallelism between the axes of the stator and rotor.<br><br>
