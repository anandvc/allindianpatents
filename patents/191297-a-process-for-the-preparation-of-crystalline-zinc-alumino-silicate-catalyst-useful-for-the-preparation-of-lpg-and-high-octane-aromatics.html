				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of crystalline zinc alumino silicate catalyst useful for the preparation of LPG and high octane aromatics. The catalyst material prepared by the process of the present invention is given the name zinc-aluminosilicate or Zn-ZSM-5 molecular sieve catalyst. Hence more specifically the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a catalyst consisting of Zn-ZSM-5 which is useful for the preparation of LPG and high octane aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene and xylenes(BTX) from   low  value,    low  octane  petroleum   feed     slocks.<br>
New gasoline specifications and changing markets have led to large and rapid variations of feed stocks and availablity. The key factor to boost the profitability is to take advantage of these variations and produce high demand, high value products such as LPG, hydrogen and aromatics. Hence, there is a need to develop a versatile process for the preparation of a novel catalyst which will be able to process cheaper, sometimes unwanted and variably available feed stocks to  produce  LPG  and  high  octane   aromatics.<br>
Therefore the present invention relates to<br>
process for the preparation of a novel catalyst con<br>
sisting of Zn-ZSM-5 molecular sieve useful for the<br>
conversion	of        petroleum	feed	stocks	into<br>
value	added	products   such  as   LPG  and  high  octane<br>
hydrocarbons.<br>
Because of its population, India is in peculiar situation with great demand for LPG, which can not be met by conventional resources such as cracking processes employing naphtha, gas oil and the like. The deficit between demand and production of LPG at the end of 8th plan (1996-97) is expected to be 2.8 million metric tones per annum which is likely to increase to 5.8 million metric tones per annum at the end of 9th plan (2001-02). Similarly, deficit between demand and production of motor gasoline at the end of 9th plan is expected to be 1.5 million metric tonnes per annum. Hence, good amount of foreign exchange has to be spent for meeting the demand of LPG as the demand can not be met by indigenous  resources.<br>
Natural gas condensate (NGC), aromatic extraction raffinate and light naphtha are considered as some of the few non economically viable feed stocks in the petroleum market today. As these feed stocks being non-reformable by conventional catalytic reforming process; they have been considered only as a fuel for long periods. These feed stocks can be converted in to valuable products like LPG and Benzene, Toluene and Xylenes (BTX aromatics), utilising the shape selective features of medium pore zeolite molecular sieve.<br>
The aromatic hydrocarbons can be used as high octane blending feed stocks for the production of high octane gasoline.      They     are     also     used     as     feed     stocks     for    thepreparation  of  chemical  and  petrochemical  products. Aromatic   chemicals    constitute   about   one   third   of   the   total organic   compounds   known  to   day.      They  are  important  chemical precursors    for    the    production    of    detergents    and   polymers among  others.<br>
An article published in the literature [ Ind. Eng. Chem.<br>
Process Design Dev. , 25, (1986), 151 3 describes a process<br>
proposed by Mobil Research and Development for the<br>
preparation of aromatics from variety of feed stocks such as<br>
pyrolysis gasoline, unsaturated gases from catalytic cracker,<br>
paraffinic naphtha and LPG. The process describes use of<br>
purely acidic H-ZSM-5 catalyst. Another report (Hydrocarbon<br>
processing, Sep 1989, p-72) descreibes of a process developed<br>
jointly by UOP INC and British Petroleum Company, based on<br>
gallium   doped   2eolite    catalyst.	In   this    process    LPG   was<br>
converted into BTX aromatics and the process has been demonstrated in a large scle pilot plant of the British Petroleum's Graigemouth Refinery in Scotland. U.S. Patent 5, 124, 417 dated June 1992 describes the use of Pt-Sn-ZSM-5 Catalyst for the production of mono alkyl aromatics from C8 n-paraffins containing feed stocks. U.S. Patent 5, 026, 938 dated 25 June 1991 describes a process for converting a gaseous feed stocks containing C3-C5 paraffins into aromatic hydrocarbons by contacting the feed with galliosilicate molecular  sieve  catalyst.<br>
Zeolite    ZSM-5    is    a    crystalline    alurainosilicate    whose preparation   was   first   claimed   in   1972   and   is   described  in  a<br>
U.S. patent 3, 702, 386. The frame work structure is well<br>
established and the catalyst is reported to have many<br>
catalytic     applications.	"Silicalite"     having     a     similar<br>
zeolite structure constituted by pure crystalline S102, has been descirbed by E,M, Flanigen [Nature 271 (1978), 512]. The highly ordered rigid structure with three dimensional rigid lattice can accomodate MeC-4 in addition to Si04 tetrahedra. Me  being  for  example  Al,   Fe,   Ga,   Ti  or  B.<br>
Conventionally, Bensene, Toluene and Xylenes (BTX) aromatics are obtained by catalytic reforming process of naphtha. The catalyst used for this process is Pt/Al2 0s monometallic or Pt-Re/Al2 03 bimetallic catalyst. Although these processes are used all over the world, there are number of limitations in the use of these catalyst for the above mentioned  process.<br>
These  limitations  are  :<br>
i)      These      catalysts      are      not      effective      in     promoting<br>
aromatlsation   of   Cs    hydrocarbons.    Hence,    it   can   not   be  used<br>
for     the     aromatisation     of     feed     stocks     like     natural     gas<br>
condensate      (NGC),      light     naphtha     or     aromatic     extraction<br>
raffinate,   which  contains   appreciable  amount  of  n-pentane  and<br>
iso  pentane.<br>
ii)   These   catalysts   are   also   not  very  effective  in  promotion<br>
of   the   aromatisation   of   straight   chain   paraffins   such  as  n-<br>
hexane   and   n-heptane.    Hence,    large   amount   of   straight   chain<br>
paraffins   such  as   n-hexane   and  n-heptane  present  in  the  feed<br>
remain  unconverted.<br>
iii) All catalytic reforming units employing these catalysts require an Organic Chloride additive to provide the proper balance between acid and metal function. The Organic Chloride is broken down during reforming process in to hydrochloric acid, a waste product   targeted   for   stricter  regulations.<br>
iv) These processes result in the formation of gasoline in the range of 75-95 research octane number and hence require use of tetra ethyl lead to boost the octane number. The use of tetra ethyl lead in gasoline has toxic effects of lead emitted from exhausts and is being  banned  all   over  the  world   including   India.<br>
The main objective of present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of crystalline zinc alumino silicate catalyst useful for the preparation of LPG and high octane aromatics. The catalyst prepared by the process of present invention can be used for the production of Benzene, Toluene, Xylenes (BTX) aromatics using feed stocks like naturl gas condensate (NGC) and light naphtha, production of LPG carries significance from the Indian point of view as demand for LPG in India is much higher. Zn-ZSM-5 catalyst prepared by the process of the present invention     contains   Zn,   in  addition  to  Al   and     Si,      and<br>
possesses  MFI   structure.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the preparation of crystalline zinc alumino silicate catalyst useful for the preparation of LPG and high  octane   aromatics  which  comprises:<br>
(a)	mixing water, a source selected from silica / an<br>
aluminium source selected from aluminium a salts, a<br>
zinc source selected from zinc salts and tetrahydral<br>
alkyl   ammonium  cation  by  conventional   methods,<br>
(b)	heating  the   said  reaction  mixture   to  a     temperature<br>
ranging     from  80o   C  to  230 o  C,   preferably  from     140o   C     to<br>
210   oC,   at   autogeneous  phase   and<br>
(c)	heating     the   solid  content   obtained     in     step      (b)<br>
to  a   temperature   atleast   4 00 o  C,   exchanging/impregnating<br>
the     above   solid  obtained   in  step   (c)   with  metals     such<br>
as     Na,      Ca,    Sn,   Pt   and  Fe  by  known  methods     to     obtain<br>
crystalline   zinc   alumino   silicates.<br>
Silica in the form of hydrogels, aerogels, Colloidal suspension or solution of soluble silicate such as sodium  silicate   can  be  used  as   sources   of   silica.<br>
The alumina sources which can be used include aluminium salts (Sulphates, nitrates, chlorides, fluorides   and  acetate   for   example),    aluminium  hydroxide   andoxide,      aluminates,   esters   such  as   tripropyl     ester     of mono-ortho   aluminic   acid    [Al    (OC3H7)3].<br>
As     zinc   source,    zinc   salts  which  are     capable     of being     converted     into     zinc     oxide     upon     calcination, especially  in  the  presence  of  oxygen  can  be  used.   As  an example   of   such   salt   zinc  nitrate   is  mentioned.<br>
Instead of starting with separate sources of aluminia and silica, sources in which the two oxides are combined can also be used; for example amorphous alumina, silica gel, crystalline alumino silicate, including  clays   and  zeolites.<br>
The source of structuring agent used to provide organic cations are preferably tetra alkyl ammonium cations, the alkyl advantageously being Propyl and the like.<br>
The   acids   or  acid  salts,   bases   or  basic   salts  possibly<br>
added in the reaction mixture in compliment to adjust the PH of the reaction medium to the desired value can be choosen from commonly used acids such as hydrochloric acid (HC1) , nitric acid (HN03), Sulphuric acid (H2SO4), acetic acid (CH3COOH) or acid salts such as sodium hydrogen sulphate (NaHSO4); commonly used bases are such as ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH), Soda (NaOH), Potash (KOH) or commonly used basic salts such as sodium hydrogen carbonate (NaHCO3), or neutral sodium carbonate (Na2C03) sodium acetate (CH3COONa), neutral sodium sulfide (Na2S) or sodium hydrogen sulphide (NaHS). Buffer mixtures such as acetic acid (CH3COOH) sodium acetate (CH3COONa), ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH), ammonium chloride can be used for the purpose. The catalyst prepared by the process of  the  present  invention  may  contain  by  weight<br>
(a)	0.01  to   10%  zinc.<br>
(b)	0.5 to 99.99% of a zeolites with an S102/A1203 molar ratio ranging from 15 to 1000; said zeolite molecular sieve having X-ray  diffraction  pattern  shown  in  Table  -  2.<br>
(c)	0.01 to 5.0% by weight of metals from the group Na, K, Ca,   Pt,   Sn  and  Re.<br>
(d)	0.1 to 99.49% of a matrix choosen from the group<br>
consisting of alumina, silica, clay, metal oxides and a<br>
combination  of  the  compounds  mentioned  here  in  above.<br>
The catalyst preferably containing 0.05 to 5.0 % by weight of Zinc, zeolites content varies between 40 to 90 % weight, the total metal content of metals from the group Na, K,   Ca,   Pt,   Sn  and  Re  varying  between  0.05  to   1.0%  by  weight,<br>
the   solid   matrix   may   be   alumina.    The   catalyst   retains  the<br>
catalytic  activity  even  after  multiple  regenerations.<br>
The      diffraction      pattern      of      the      catalyst      have<br>
characteristics     corresponding     to     the     sepcifications     as<br>
presented  in  Table  -  2.<br>

These  zeolites  molecular  sieves  of  MFI  structure  have  the following    appropriate    chemical    formula    after    calcination, expressed  in  the  form  of  oxides. M  2/n  0.x  AI2O3.   Y  Si02 ,   Z   ZnO  where   in, M  represent  a  proton  and/or  a  metallic  cation. n   is   the  valency  of  the  said  cation,   y/x   is   a  number  ranging from  5  to   1000   (Si02/Alz03   molar  ratio).<br>
Z/Y is a number ranging from 5 to 1000 (Zn0/Si02 molar ratio) The solid was three times exchanged with 3N NH4NO3 solution to get the ammonium form of the catalyst. To get the desired protonic form, decomposition was carried out at 450oC for four  hours.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the zinc<br>
alunino silicate molecular sieve in the protonated form thus<br>
obtained is incorporated in another material (matrix) more<br>
resistant to the temperature and other conditions employed in<br>
the process. Such matrix material includes synthetic or<br>
naturally occuring substances, as well as clays, silica,<br>
alumina    or    metal    oxides.	The    relative    portion    of    the<br>
molecular sieve and matrix material on anhydrous basis may vary with molecular sieve content ranging between 10 to 90% by  weight.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention metals like sodium, potassium, gallium, platinum, tin, iron, rhenium are advantageously incorporated in to Zinc-alumlnosilicate molecular sieve either during synthesis or subsequently by impregnation   and/or    ion   exchange.     Incorporation   of    one   or<br>
more of these metals in the molecular sieve is expected to enhance activity, selectivity and life of the catalyst. The total amount of such added metals may vary between 0.1 to 0.5%  by  weight.<br>
In    another    embodiment    of    the    present    invention,    the catalyst  obtained   by  the   process   of  the  present  invention  is used    for    the    aromatisation    reaction    of    non   economically viable   petroleum  feed   stocks   which  mainly  contain  paraffins. Such   feed   stocks   include   light   naphtha,   aromatic  extraction raffinate,   natural  gas  condensate   (NGC)   straight  run  naphtha, etc.    This   reaction   is   of   particular   interest   as   it  produces the   products   of   greater   value   e.g  benzene,   toluene,   xylenes and     LPG     from     Low     value     feed     stocks.      Detailed    process conditions   and   possible   application  of   the   catalyst  prepared by  the  process   of  the  present  invention  are  beyond  the  scope of  the  present  invention  and  has  been  made  the  subject  matter of  our  patent  application: &amp;JjLli&gt;E'-l34- ,<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the catalyst prepared by the process of the present invention shows similar catalytic activity even after seventeen regenerations.   As  reported  in  the  literature<br>
(Catalysis Today, vol. 6, 1989-90, p-35) Zinc exchanged zeolites are active for conversion of methanol Into aromatics. But the activity of the catalyst slowly decreases due to elution of zinc from the catalyst under the reducing atmosphere. This phenomenon is well known and is one of the major    hurdles     in    the    use    of    zinc    promoted    catalyst   for<br>
practical purposes. But the catalyst used in the present invention does not show such a phenomenon and can be advantageously  used  even  in  the  reducing  atmosphere.<br>
The    following    examples    will    serve    to    illustrate   the process   of   this   invention   which   should   not   be   construed   to limit  the  scope  of  the  present  invention. Example  1.<br>
This   example  describes   a  process   for  the  preparation  of zeolite   molecular   sieve   zinc   silicalite   entering   in   to  the composition    of    the    catalyst    according    to    the   invention. Silicagel   (200-300   mesh)   was   used   as   the  silica  source  while zinc  nitrate   (Zn   (NO3)2.   H2O)   was  used  as  the  zinc  source.<br>
In a typical procedure a mixture of NaOH (0.36 moles), N(CsH7) Br (0.06 moles), Zn(N03)2 (0.007 moles) and water (22.5 moles) were added to the silica gel under stirring. The PH of the reaction gel was controlled by adding 3.5 ml of 1:1 H2SO4 solution. The crystallisation of reaction mixture was carried out at 150oC for 3.5 days. The solid is filtered, washed with hot water and then dried at 80oC, crystallographic analysis shows that the product is a zeolite having a MFI structure where X ray diffraction pattern corresponds to the specification given in Table - 2. The chemical analysis of the product reveals that it contains 1.75  wt%  Zn  as   ZnO.<br>
The     solid     prepared     as     above     is     exchanged    and/or imprignated  with  metals  from  the  group  Na,   Fe,   Ca  and  Pt.   The<br>
total  amount  of  such  metals  added  is  0.5%  by  weight.<br>
The solid prepared as above is shaped by extrusion with a binder material or matrix, prefereably alumina in a proportion of 65% by weight of zeolite and 35% by weight of binding agent, A paste is obtained by adding water in these two components. This paste is passed through a die having a diameter of 1.4 mm, then dried under stream of air at 120*C and calcined at 550"C for one hour. The yield of the catalyst is 92%. Example  -  2.<br>
This example illustrates a process for the preparation of a zeolite molecular sieve, zinc alumino silicate entering into the composition of the catalyst according to the invention. In this example, aluminium sulphate [Al2(S04)3H20] is used as a source of alumina, silica gel (200-330 mesh) was used as the silica source while zinc nitrate [Zn(N03)2 H2O] was  used  as  the  zinc  source.<br>
In a typical procedure a mixture of N(C3H7) Br (0.06 moles), Zn (N03)2 (0.007 moles), Al2(S04)3. H2O (0.003 moles) and water (22.5 moles) were added to the silica gel (0.6 moles) under stirring. The PH of the reaction gel was controlled by adding 3.5 ml of H2SO4 (H2SO4; water, 1:1), The crystallisation of reaction mixture was carried out in autoclave  at   1500C  for  3.5  days.<br>
After crystallisation, the solid is filtered, washed with hot water and then dried at 800C. Crystallographic analysis  shows  that  these  zeolites  have  MFI  Structure  whose<br>
X-ray dlfferaction pattern corresponds to the specification given in Table-2, chemical analysis of the product after calcination in air at 5500C shows Al (as AI2O3), 0.8% and Zn (as   ZnO) ,   1.7%.<br>
Protonation of zeolites samples was caried out by submitting the sample to 3 cycles of ion exchange with 0,2 N NH4NO3 at 80*C for four hours, followed by filtration and washing  with  hot  water.<br>
The solid obtained as above was exchanged/or Impregnated with metals such as Na, Ca, Sn, Pt and Fe to obtain catalyst sample. The total amount of such metals added is 0.5% by weight. The yield of the catalyst is 95% . The solid prepared as above is shaped by extrusion with a binder material or matrix, preferably alumina in a proportion of 65% by weight of zeolite and 35% by weight of binding agent. A paste is obtained by adding water to the above mixture. This paste is passed through a die having a diameter of 1.4mm, then dried under a stream of air at 120*C and calcined at 550"C for one hour. Example  3.<br>
This example illustrates a process for the preparation of a zeolite molecular sieve zinc aluminosilicate entering into composition of the catalyst according to the invention. In this example, silica gel (200-300 mesh) was used as the silica source, aluminium sulfate [Al2(S04)s H2O] as a source of alumina while [Zn(N03)2.H2O] was used as the zinc source. In   a   typical   procedure,   a   mixture   of   N(C3H7)4   Br   (0.06<br>
moles), [Al2(S04)3. H2O] (0.003 moles), [Zn (N03)2 H2O] (.015 moles) and water (24 moles) were added to the silica gel (0.6 moles) under stirring. The PH of the reaction gel was controlled by adding 3.5 ml of H2SO4 (H2SO4 : water, 1:1). The crystallisation of reaction mixture was carried out  in  autoclave  at  1500C  for  3.5  days.<br>
After crystallisation, the solid is filtered, washed with hot water and then dired at 800C. Crystallographic analysis shows that the product is a zeolite having a MFI structure. The chemical analysis of the product after calcination in air at 550*C shows Al (as AI2O3), 0.8% and Zn (as   ZnO)   3.3%.<br>
Protonation of zeolite samples was carried out by submitting the sample to 3 cycles of ion exchange with 0.2N NH4NO3 at 800C for four hours, followed by filtration and washing  with  hot  water.<br>
The solid obtained as above was exchanged or impregnated with metals such as Na, Ca, Sn, Pt and Fe to obtain the catalyst Sample. The total amount of such metals added Is 0.5%  by  weight.   The  yield  of  the  catalyst  is  95%.<br>
The solid prepared as above is shaped by extrusion with a binder material or matrix, preferably alumina in a proportion of 65% by weight of zeolite and 35% by weight of binding agent. A paste is obtained by adding water to above mixture. This paste is passed through a die having a diameter of 1.4 mm, then dried under a stream of air at 120*C. Example-4.<br>
This     example    shows    the    catalytic    activity    of     Zinc alumino  silicate   molecular  sieve   [Al   as   (A1203),   0.8%  and  Zn (as   ZnO),    1.7%]   catalyst   (Zn   ZSM-5)   prepared   in   example  -2, in  fresh  form,   after  six  regenerations   (after  regeneration  of the    coked    catalyst    to    regain    its    catalytic    activity)   and after   17   regenerations  for  aromatisation  reaction.   Pure n-heptane   was   used   as   a   feed   for   the   study  and  reaction  was carried   out   in   a   pressure   micro   reactor   unit.    The   reaction conditions,      conversion     of     n-heptane     and     selectivity     to products  are  described  in  Table  -  3. table-3<br>

The    main   advantages    of    the    present    invention   are   as follows:<br>
i)   The   catalyst   prepared by   the   process   of  present  invention<br>
is      most     versatile     when     used     for     the     conversion     of<br>
economically   non   viable   petroleum   feed   stocks   in   to   value<br>
added  products.<br>
ii)    Metal,    zinc   which   is   quite   cheap   has   been   used   in  the<br>
catalyst    formulation     instead    of     the    costly    gallium,     or<br>
platinum  which  is  used  in  the  hitherto  known  catalysts.<br>
iii)     Irrespective    of    presence    of    zinc    in    the    catalyst<br>
formulation    (which   has   low   m. p   and   b. P) ,    the   catalyst   does<br>
not  show  any  loss  of  activity  even  after  multiple  for  example<br>
seventeen  regenerations.<br>
iv)    The    catalyst    prepared    by    the    process    of    the    present<br>
invention  is  not  very  sensitive  to  sulfur.<br>
v)    The    catalyst    prepared    by    the    process    of    the   present<br>
invention  does   not  require   use  of  corrosive  organic  chloride<br>
additive.<br><br><br><br><br>
