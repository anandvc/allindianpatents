				<td>IMIDAZOLE DERIVATIVE AND THEIR USE AS PERIPHERALLY-SELECTIVE INHIBITORS OF<br>
DOPA NINE-BETA-HYDROXYLASE<br>
This invention relates to peripherally-selective inhibitors of dopamine-ß-hydroxylase and method of their preparation.<br>
In recent years, interest in the development of inhibitors of dopamine-ß-hydroxylase (DßH) has centred on the hypothesis that inhibition of this enzyme may provide significant clinical improvements in patients suffering from cardiovascular disorders such as hypertension or chronic heart failure. The rationale for the use of DßH inhibitors is based on their capacity to inhibit the biosynthesis of noradrenaline, which is achieved via enzymatic hydroxylation of dopamine. Activation of neurohumoral systems, chiefly the sympathetic nervous system, is the principal clinical manifestation of congestive heart failure (Parmley, W.W., Clinical Cardiology, 18: 440-445, 1995). Congestive heart failure patients have elevated concentrations of plasma noradrenaline (Levine, T.B. et .al., Am. J. Cardiof., 49:1659-1666, 1982), increased central sympathetic outflow (Leimbach, W.N, et al., Circulation, 73: 913-919, 1986) and augmented cardiorenal noradrenaline spillover (Masking, G.J. et al., Circulation, 73:615-621, 1966). Prolonged and excessive exposure of myocardium to noradrenaline may lead to down-regulation of cardiac ß1-adrenoceptors, remodelling of the left ventricle, arrhytmias and necrosis, ail of which can diminish the functional integrity of the heart. Congestive heart failure patients who have high plasma concentrations of noradrenaline also have the most unfavourable long-term prognosis (Conn, J.N. et al., N. Engl. J. Med., 311:819-823, 1984).   Of   greater  significance   is   the   observation   that   plasma   noradrenaltne concentrations are already elevated in asymptomatic patients with no overt heart failure and can predict ensuing mortality and morbidity (Benedict, C.R. et al., Circulation, 94:690-697, 1996). This implies that the activated sympathetic drive is not merely a clinical marker of congestive heart failure, but may contribute to progressive worsening of the disease.<br>
Inhibition of sympathetic nerve function with adrenoceptor antagonists appeared a promising approach, however a significant proportion of patients do not tolerate the<br><br>
immediate haemodynamic deterioration that accompanies ß-blocker treatment (Pfeffer, M.A. et ai., N. Engl. J. Med., 334:1396-7, 1996). An alternative strategy for directly modulating sympathetic nerve function is to reduce the biosynthesis of noradrenalins via  inhibition  of DßH,  the  enzyme  responsible  for conversion  of dopamine  to noradrenaline in sympathetic nerves. This approach has several merits including gradual modulation as opposed to abrupt inhibition of the sympathetic system, and causing increased release of dopamine, which can improve renal function such as renal vasodilation, diuresis and natriuresis. Therefore inhibitors of DßH may provide significant advantages over conventional ß-blobkers.<br>
Several inhibitors of DßH have been thus far reported in the literature. Early first and second generation examples such as disulfiram (Goldstein, M.'et at., Life Sci., 3:763, 1964) and diethyldithiocarbamate (Lippmann, W. et ai., Biochem. Pharmacol., 18: 2507, 1969) or fusaric acid (Hidaka, H. Nature, 231, 1971) and aromatic or alkyl thioureas (Johnson, G.A. et al, J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 171: 80, 1970) were, found to be of low potency, exhibited poor selectivity for DßH and caused toxic side effects. The third generation of DßH inhibitors however, were found to have much greater potency, such as for example, nepicastat (RS-25560-197, IC50 9nM) (Stanley, W.C., et al., Br. J Pharmacol., 121: 1803-1809,  1997), which was developed to early clinical trials. Although devoid of some of the problems associated with first and second generation DßH inhibitors, a very important discovery was that hepicastat was found to cross the blood brain barrier (BBB), thereby able to cause central as well as peripheral effects, a situation which could lead to undesired and potentially serious CNS side-effects'of the drug. Therefore there yet remains an unfulfilled clinical requirement for a potent, non-toxic and peripherally selective inhibitor of DßH, which could be used for treatment of certain cardiovascular disorders, A DßH inhibitor with similar or even greater potency than nepicastat, but devoid of CNS effects (inability to cross the BBB) would provide a significant improvement over all DßH inhibitor compounds thusfar described in the prior art.<br>
We have surprisingly found that incorporation of certain heteroatoms to the carbocyclic ring and/or elongation of the amino alkyl side-chain of the nepicastat core-structure'<br><br>
gives rise to a series of compounds possessing significant and pronounced effects of potential usefulness for DßH inhibition. Many of these compounds are. endowed with greater potency and significantly reduced brain access, giving rise to potent and peripherally selective DpH inhibitors. Thus, the invention relates to compounds of general formula I;<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where RI, R2 and R3 are the same or different and signify hydrogens, halogens, alkyl,<br>
alkylaryl, alkyioxy, hydroxy, nitro, amino, alkylcarbonylamino, alkylamino or<br>
diaikylamino group; R* signifies hydrogen, alkyl or alkylaryl group; X signifies CHz,<br>
oxygen atom or sulphur atom; n is 1, 2 or 3, with the proviso that when n is 1, X is not<br>
CH2; and the individual (R)- and (S)-enantiomers or mixtures of enantiomers; and the<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.	<br>
Unless stated otherwise, in this specification the term alkyl (v/hether used on its own or used in combination with other moieties) means hydrocarbon chains, straight or branched, containing from one to six carbon atoms, optionally substituted by aryl, alkoxy, halogen, alkoxycarbonyl or hydroxycarbonyl groups; the term aryl (whether used on its own or used in combination with other moieties) means a phenyl or naphthyl group, optionally substituted by alkyioxy, halogen or nitro group; and the term halogen means fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention is a process for the preparation of compounds of formula 1. Some compounds according to formula II where X signifies methylene (CH2), oxygen or sulphur are known (Martinez, G.R. et al., US Patent 5,538,988, Jul. 23, 1996; Eriksson, M., PCT Int. Appl. WO 9959988A1, 25 Nov 1999; Napoletano, M., PCT Int. Appl. WO 96084B9A1, 21 March 1996; Sarda, N. et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 17:271-272, 1976; Neirabeyeh, M.AI et al., Eur. J, Med. Chem., 26:497-504, 1991) in<br><br>
. the literature and others can be prepared -by those skilled in the art. Compounds according to formula II are chiral, and formula II is therefore to be taken to represent both optically pure individual (R)- and (S)-enantiomers or mixtures of enantiomers;<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br><br>
Compounds of formula I are prepared by reacting a compound of formula II where X is CH2, oxygen or sulphur; R1,R2 and R3 are the same or different and signify hydrogens, halogens, alkyl, alkylaryl, alkyloxy, hydroxy, nitro, alkylcarbonylamino, alkylamino or dialkylamino group with a compound of formula III:<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
where n signifies 1, 2 or 3; when n is 1 or 2, R4 signifies hydrogen, alkyl or alkylaryl group; R5 signifies a hydroxyl protecting group and R6 signifies an amino protecting group; when n signifies 3, R5 is defined as above but R4 and R6 taken together represent a phthalimido group; and with a water soluble thiocyanate salt in an inert organic solvent and in the presence of an organic acid, wherein the water soluble thiocyanate salt is an alkali metal thiocyanate salt or a tetraalkylammonium thiocyanate salt.<br><br>
Suitable alkali metal thiocyanate salts include sodium, lithium and cesium thiocyanates, but potassium thiocyanate is preferred.<br><br>
The compound of formula III where n is 1 is known (Wolf, E. et al., Can. J. Chem., 75:942-948, 1997) and compounds of formula III where n is 2 or 3 are new compounds that can be prepared by those skilled in the art (see examples). The preferred hydroxyl protecting groups (R5) include organosilyl compounds such as chosen from trialkysilyl, triphenylsilyl, phenyldialkylsilyl or alkyldiphenylsilyf group. The tert-butyldimethylsNyl (TBDMS) group is especially preferred. The preferred amino protecting groups (R6)<br><br>
include carbamates such alkyl carbamates, in particular the t-butyl carbamate (Boc) group, and alkylaryl carbamates. The reaction ma/ be run with a small excess of the compound of formula lil and potassium thiocyanate (preferably 1.1-1.3 equivalents).<br>
The invention also provides compounds of formula II, where at (east one of R1, R2 and R3 is fluorine.<br>
The reaction can be run in a substantially inert solvent (preferably ethyl acetate) and at different temperatures (preferably at the solvent reflux temperature). Preferred organic acids include acetic acid. When compounds of formula 111 where n signifies 1 .are used, the intermediate of formula IV is then treated with a mineral acid in a suitable solvent to remove the Boc amino protecting group and provide the compounds of formula t (scheme 1). Preferred mineral acids include hydrochloric acid and preferred solvents include ethyl acetate.<br>
When compounds of formula III where n signifies 2 are used and R4 signifies hydrogen, the mixture of intermediate products of formula V and VI is reacted with hydrochloric acid in ethyl acetate to afford the corresponding single compounds of formula I (scheme 2); where R4 signifies alkyl (including alkyl substituted by aryl), the single intermediate product of formula V is reacted with hydrochloric acid in ethyl acetate .to afford the compounds of formula I.<br>
When compounds of formula III where n is 3 are used, the intermediate of formula VII is then treated with sodium borohydride in a suitable solvent system followed by acetic acid to remove the pthalimido amino protecting group as described in the literature . (Osby et'al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1984, 25(20), 2093-2096) to give the compounds of formula I (scheme 3). The compounds of formula I are obtained with good purity, but if preferred can be recrystaliised from a suitable solvent.<br><br>

For the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions of compourtds of formula I, inert pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are admixed with the active compounds.' The pharmaceutically acceptable carriers may be either solid or liquid. Solid form preparations include powders, tablets, dispersible granules and capsules. A solid carrier can be one or more substances which may also act as diluents, flavouring agents, solubilizers, lubricants, suspending agents, binders or tablet disintegrating agents; it may also be an encapsulating material.<br>
Preferably the pharmaceutical preparation is in unit dosage form, e.g. packaged preparation, the package containing discrete quantities of preparation such .as packeted tablets, capsules and powders in vials or ampoules.<br>
The dosages, may be varied depending on the requirement of the patient, the severity of the disease and the particular compound being employed. For convenience, the total daily dosage may be divided and administered in portions throughout the day. It is expected that once or twice per day administration will be most suitable. Determination of the proper dosage for a particular situation is within the skill of those in the medical . art.<br>
Materials and Methods<br>
In vitro studies<br>
DpH activity was evaluated by the ability to ß-hydroxylate dopamine to noradrenalihe as previously described (Kojima, K., Parvez, S. and Nagatsu T. 1993. Analysis of enzymes in catecholamine biosynthesis. In Methods in Neuretransmitter and Neuropeptide Research, pp. 349-380: Eisiever Science Publishers). SK-N-SH cells (ATCC HTB-11), a human neuroblastoma derived cell line, were used as a source of human DpH. SK-N-SH cells cultured in 24 well plates were preincubated for 20 min in a reaction medium containing 200 mM sodium acetate, 30 mM N-ethyJmaleimide, 5 µM copper sulphate, 0.5 mg/ml catalase aqueous solution, 1 mM pargyline, 10 mM sodium fumarate and 20 mM ascorbic acid. Thereafter, cells were incubated for further 45 min in the reaction medium with added increasing concentrations of dopamine (0.5 to 100 mM). During<br>
preincubation and incubation, the cells were continuously shaken and maintained at 37°C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.2 M perchloric acid. The acidified samples were stored at 4°C before injection into the high pressure li'quid chromatograph for the assay of noradrenaline. In experiments conducted with the. aim of studying the effects of new DpH inhibitors on enzyme activity, test compounds (0.3 to 10,000 nM) of interest were added to the preincubation and incubation solutiqns; the incubation was performed in the presence of a concentration (50 mM) of dopamine 2,5 times the corresponding Km value as determined in saturation experiments.<br>
In vivo studies<br>
Male NMRI mice or Wistar rats were obtained from Harlan-lnterfauna (Spain) and were kept 10 and 5 per cage respectively, under controlled environmental conditions (12 h light/dark cycle and room temperature 22 ± 1 °C). Food and tap water were allowed ad libitum and experimentation was performed during daylight hours.<br>
At time = 0 h, animals were administered with either test compounds at a given dose or vehicle (water) delivered orally via gavage. At 2, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 h post dose, the animals were sacrificed by decapitation and heart (left atrium and left ventricle) and brain (frontal and parietal cortex) were isolated, weighed and stored in a volume of 0.2 M perchloric acid for 12 h at 4 °C in the dark. Post incubation, the resulting supernatants were collected by centrifuge filtration of incubates (0.2 µM / 10 mm / -5000 rpm, 4 °C). Supernatants were stored frozen at -80 °C until analysis. Quantification of dopamine and noradrenaline in supernatants was performed by high pressure liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection.<br>
Results<br>
In vitro studies<br>
Incubation of SK-N-SH cells in the presence of increasing concentrations of dopamine resulted in a concentration-dependent formation of noradrenaline, yielding Km (in µM) and Vmax (in nmol mg protein-1 h-1) values of 20.6+6 and 153.8±4.4, respectively. From these kinetic parameters, a concentration of dopamine approaching saturation (50 mM) was chosen for use in inhibition studies. As listed in Table 1 compounds 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10,12,16,19,24,26,28 and 29 were found to markedly inhibit DpH activity. Compounds  2,  3,  4  and   nepicastat  1   (the  reference  compound)  produced  a concentration-dependent decrease in the (i-hydroxylation of dopamine with IC50 values in the low nM range against human DßH activity (see Table 2). Compound 4 was chosen for further in vivo studies, being the compound most closely related to nepicastat 1 in order to provide conclusive evidence that the structural modifications made to the molecule as part of the present invention are responsible for the surprisingly        markedly        improved         biological         properties         observed.<br><br>

In vivo studles Mouse<br>
The time course experiments for compound 4 and nepicastat (1) in the heart at 100 mg/kg .suggests that both compounds are long acting. Time of maximum effect (Tmax) for noradrenaline tissue reduction by both 4 and 1 appears to be at 9 h post-dose (Figure 1). Thereafter, noradrenaiine tissue levels recover, reaching 50% recovery of initial tissue levels at 24 h.<br>
At Tmax (9 h after administration), both 4 and 1 reduced noradrenaline levels in a dose-dependent manner in left ventricle. For both 4 and 1, the maximal inhibitory effect was attained at a dose of 100 mg/kg. In contrast to that found in the heart, 4 failed to affect noradrenaline tissue levels in the brain parietal cortex, whereas 1 produced a dose-dependent decrease in noradrenaline levels in this area of the brain (Figure 2).<br>
Rat<br>
As shown in the mouse, the effects of both 4 and 1 upon noradrenaline were dependent on the dose administered and reached its maximum at 9 h (data not shown). However, as depicted in Figure 3, the inhibitory effects of 4 (100 mg/kg) upon noradrenaline. levels in both the left atrium and the left ventricle were more pronounced than those elicited by 1 (100 mg/kg). Again, as observed in the mouse, 4 failed to affect noradrenaline tissue levels in the brain parietal cortex and the brain frontal cortex, whereas 1 produced a marked decrease in noradrenaline levels in these brain areas.<br>
It is concluded that 4, in stark contrast to nepicastat 1, exerts its inhibitory effects upon DßH exclusively in the periphery, being devoid of inhibitory effects in the brain.<br>
Reference is now made to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a graph showing the time-dependent decrease of noradrenaline levels in the left ventricle of mice treated orally with 100 mg/kg of 4 or nepicastat 1. Symbols are means of 5 determinations per group; vertical lines indicate S.E.M.<br>
Figure 2 is two graphs showing noradre.naline levels in the mouse left ventricle and brain parietal cortex 9 h after oral administration of 4 or nepicastat 1. Symbols are means of 5 determinations per group; vertical lines indicate S.E.M.<br>
Figure 3 is four graphs showing noradrenaline levels in the rat heart (left atrium and left ventricle) and brain (frontal and parietal cortex) 9 h after the oral administration of 4 or nepicastat 1.    Columns are means of 5 determinations per group; vertical lines indicated S.E.M.<br>
Conclusion<br>
Some compounds of general formula I are very potent dopamine-'ß-hydroxylase inhibitors and have potentially valuable pharmaceutical properties in the treatment of some cardiovascular disorders, where a reduction in the enzymatic hydroxylation of dopamine to noradrenaline may be of therapeutic benefit, such as hypertension and chronic heart failure. The possibility to use a long-acting DßH inhibitor with limited access to the brain (CNS), such as compound 4 opens new perspectives in the treatment of hypertension and chronic heart failure by improving potency and selectivity of DßH inhibition in the periphery.<br>
