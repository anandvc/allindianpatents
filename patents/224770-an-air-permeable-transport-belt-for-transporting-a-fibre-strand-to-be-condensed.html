				<td>BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A transpon belt for transporting a fibre strand to bo oondonsed<br>
The present invention relates to an air-permeable transport belt in the form of a woven belt<br>
for transporting a fibre strand to be condensed over a suction slit of a condensing zone of a<br>
spinning machine, the transport belt comprising longitudinal threads extending in the<br>
transport direction of the fibre strand, while also comprising cross threads extending<br>
transversely to the transport direction of the fibre strand.<br>
When a drafted fibre strand is imparted a spinning twist directly downstream of a front roller<br>
pair of a drafting unit, then a so-called spinning triangle occurs at the nipping line of the front<br>
roller pair. This arises because the drafted fibre strand leaves the drafting unit having a<br>
certain width and is then subsequently twisted to a thread having a relatively small diameter.<br>
The spinning triangle comprises lateral fibres, which are not properly bound into the twisted<br>
thread and thus contribute little or nothing to the tensile strength of the spun yarn. Recent<br>
times have seen a move towards arranging a so-called condensing zone downstream of the<br>
drafting zone of the drafting unit, which condensing zone is in turn bordered by a nipping line<br>
on its exit side. The thread is only then imparted its spinning twist subsequently. In the<br>
condensing zone, the fibres are bundles or condensed, whereby the fibre strand is so narrow<br>
when it leaves the last nipping line that the feared spinning triangle does not occur. The spun<br>
yarn is thus more even, stronger and less hairy.<br>
There are many varying embodiments of condensing zones which serve to condense the<br>
fibre strand, whereby embodiments in which a fibre strand to be condensed is transported<br>
over a suction slit of the condensing zone by means of an air-permeable transport belt have<br>
proved to be advantageous.<br>
A transport belt of the above mentioned type is prior art in German published patent<br>
application 198 37 182. The known transport belt is woven from thin synthetic threads, so<br>
that, as a result of its method of fabrication, it is by its very nature air-permeable. Both the<br>
longitudinal threads and the cross threads have each the same distance between them and<br>
have also the same diameter.<br>
Transport belts of this type in the form of woven belts must fulfill various requirements. For<br>
one, the openings formed by the longitudinal threads and the cross threads must be<br>
sufficiently large so that the necessary volume of air-flow is guaranteed for the condensing<br>
process. The weave openings must, however, on the other hand, be small enough to prevent<br>
the single fibres of the fibre strand to be transported and condensed from being sucked<br>
through the weave openings and thus ending up as fibre loss. The long-term aim has been to<br>
find a suitable compromise between the two contradictory requirements.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to create an air-permeable transport: belt designed as a<br>
woven belt of the above type, which on the one hand guarantees a large throughput of air<br>
and which on the other hand prevents the loss of fibres through suction removal.<br>
This object has been achieved in accordance with the present invention in that the clearance<br>
between two longitudinal threads is greater than the clearance between two cross threads.<br>
In this embodiment of the woven belt rectangular openings occur, whose smaller sides<br>
extend in transport direction and whose larger sides extend tranversely to the transport<br>
direction. Due to the relatively small clearance in transport direction, the fibre loss is<br>
significantly reduced, while the sufficiently high air throughput is still guaranteed due to the<br>
larger clearance in transverse direction, as the cross section of the rectangular openings of<br>
the transport belt according to the present invention can measure the same as that of the<br>
square cross section of the known transport belt. The clearance between two cross threads<br>
can be reduced with the resulting reduced loss of fibres, while, to balance this, the clearance<br>
between two longitudinal fibres can be increased. The cross threads are formed during<br>
weaving by a thick warp, while in the case of the longitudinal threads, there is a relatively<br>
reduced weft insert.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the clearance between two longitudinal threads is<br>
larger than their diameter. In this way, a free airflow cross section of the transport belt of<br>
more than 30% is achieved. These measures can be supported further in that the diameter<br>
of the longitudinal threads as well as the diameter of the cross threads is smaller than 0.08<br>
mm. This achieves a very homogenous airflow, which results in a good condensing effect<br>
and in good yarn quality.<br>
As the transport belt slides over a sliding surface, the transport belt is subjected to a certain<br>
amount of wear. Because, due to the suction removal, fibre fly, or parts adhering to the fibre<br>
material can settle over time on the transport belt, the transport belt should be washable. For<br>
this reason, it is advantageous when the longitudinal threads and the cross threads are both<br>
made from PEEK (polyetheretherketone). This produces a transport belt which has a high<br>
level of resistance to abrasion, and which barely shrinks when washed.<br>
In order to avoid points of impact for the circulating transport belt, the woven belt can be an<br>
endless belt. Even one point of impact, however small, which occurs due to overlapping,<br>
forms a miniature gap in which fibres can settle. This is avoided when the woven belt is<br>
endless.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE/DRAWINGS<br>
These and further obejcts, features and advantages of the present invention will become<br>
more readily apparent from the following detailed description thereof when taken in<br>
conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein:<br>
Figure 1 is a partly intersectional side view of the area of a condensing zone,<br>
Figure 2 is a view in the direction of the arrow II of Figure 1 of the condensing zone, whereby<br>
several components have been omitted,<br>
Figure 3 is, in greatly enlarged dimensions, a partial view of Figure II of a woven transport<br>
belt according to the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Figures 1 and 2 show in the area of the present invention a section of a spinning machine, in<br>
particular a ring spinning machine. The end area of a drafting unit 1 with its front roller pair 2<br>
and an apron pair comprising a bottom apron 3 and an upper apron 4, arranged upstream<br>
thereof, can be seen. The front roller pair 2 comprises a driven bottom cylinder 5 which is<br>
continuous in machine longitudinal direction, as well as a pressure roller 6&gt; arranged to each<br>
spinning station. The front roller pair 2 forms a front nipping line 7 of the drafting unit 1 and<br>
ends the drafting zone arranged upstream thereof.<br>
In the drafting unit 1 a sliver or a roving 8 is fed through in the known way in transport<br>
direction A and drafted to the desired degree of fineness. A drafted but still twist-free fibre<br>
strand 9 is then present directly downstream of the front nipping line 7.<br>
If the fibre strand 9 were to be imparted its spinning twist immediately, then the feared<br>
spinning triangle would occur at the front nipping line 7. For this reason, the drafted fibre<br>
strand 9 is bundled or condensed by means of lateral gathering in a condensing zone 10<br>
arranged downstream of the drafting zone, so that when the spinning twist is imparted at a<br>
later stage, the spinning triangle does not occur.<br>
A suction channel 11 is located in the condensing zone 10 in the form of a hollow profile,<br>
which suction channel 11 is subjected to low pressure and which extends over a plurality of<br>
spinning stations, as can be seen in Figure 2. The suction channel 11 extends preferably<br>
over a machine section and is provided at a suitable place with a low pressure connection<br>
12, which leads to a vacuum source (not shown).<br>
In the area of the condensing zone 10, the outer contour of the suction channel 11 is<br>
designed as a sliding surface 13, over which an air-permeable transport belt 14 is guided in a<br>
gliding manner. In the case of the transport belt 14, a thin and close-meshed woven belt is<br>
involved here, which is described in more detail below, and which transports the fibre strand<br>
9 to be condensed through the condensing zone 10. The fibre strand 9 is hereby sucked<br>
against the transport belt 14.<br>
On the side facing away from the condensing zone 10, the transport belt 14 is guided over a<br>
tensioning element 15, which at the same time aligns the transport belt 14 in lateral direction.<br>
In the sliding surface 13 a suction slit 16, covered by the transport belt 14, is located, which<br>
suction slit 16 extends slightly transversely to the transport direction A, so that during<br>
condensing, the fibre strand 9 is imparted an additional light false twist along an edge of the<br>
suction slit 16, which increases the overall condensing effect.<br>
The end of the condensing zone 10 is defined by a nipping roller 17, which drives the<br>
transport belt 14 by means of friction. The nipping roller 17 is pressed against the transport<br>
belt 14 and the suction channel 11 and forms a so-called delivery nipping line 18, which acts<br>
as a twist block against the spinning twist in such a way that the fibre strand 9 is, in the<br>
condensing zone 10, free from any spinning twist. The suction slit 16 reaches almost to the<br>
delivery nipping line 18.<br>
Directly downstream of the delivery nipping line 18 the produced thread 19 receives its<br>
spinning twist, whereby it is fed in delivery direction B to a twisting device (not shown), for<br>
example a ring spindle.<br>
As the transport belt 14 transports the fibre strand 9 on its upper side and travels over the<br>
suction slit 16 with its lower side, there is a risk that single fibres of the fibre strand 9 get<br>
through the openings in the weave and thus into the inside of the suction channel 11 and<br>
then on into the suction removal. Some of these lost fibres and the dust which adheres<br>
hereto can, however, get caught in the transport belt 14 and thus impair the condensing<br>
effect, which in time can lead to a change in the character of the spun yarn. For this reason,<br>
the transport belt 14, in the form of a woven belt, is designed as described below with the<br>
aid of the greatly enlarged Figure 3.<br>
The weave of the transport belt 14 comprises longitudinal threads 20 extending in transport<br>
direction A, as well as cross threads 21 extending transversely to transport direction A.<br>
These longitudinal threads 20 and the cross threads 21 often consist of a polyamide, but<br>
PEEK (polyetheretherketone) can be used advantageously in the present invention. The<br>
latter material is particularly resistant to abrasion.<br>
The longitudinal threads 20 and the cross threads 21 are so woven with each other that the<br>
clearance x between two adjacent longitudinal threads 20 is larger than the clearance y<br>
between two adjacent cross threads 21. The distance x can measure several times that of<br>
the distance y. This creates in the weave openings small rectangular openings 22, whose<br>
shorter side corresponds to the clearance y and extends in transport direction A, and whose<br>
longer side extends transversely to the transport direction A and corresponds to the distance<br>
x. In this design, rectangular openings 22 have a cross section, which in size corresponds to<br>
the square cross section of the previously known weave openings, which were more<br>
susceptible to fibre trash. By reducing the clearance y, the danger of trash fibres is<br>
significantly reduced, while at the same time the enlargement of the clearance x between two<br>
longitudinal threads 20 ensures a sufficiently large volume of air throughput through the<br>
transport belt 14.<br>
It has been shown to be advantageous when the clearance x between two longitudinal fibres<br>
20 is larger than their diameter dL. This diameter lies advantageously below 0.08 mm and<br>
corresponds to the diameter dQ of the cross threads 21.<br>
In Figure 3, four adjacent fibres 23 of the fibre strand 9 are shown, from which can be seen<br>
that in the case of the woven belt according to the present invention, the fibres 23 have a<br>
reduced tendency to be sucked through the weave openings as trash. The volume of air<br>
throughput necessary for condensing, however, does not have to be reduced.<br>
