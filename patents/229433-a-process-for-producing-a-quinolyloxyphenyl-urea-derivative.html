Technical Field<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to urea derivatives which are effective for prevention or treatment of various diseases associated with abnormal angiogenesis, and to processes for preparing the same. Background Art<br>
[0002] Urea derivatives represented by the general formula (C): [0003] [Chemical Formula 1]<br><br>
[0004] wherein R1 represents hydrogen, C1-6 alkyl or C3-8 cycloalkyl, and R represents hydrogen or methoxy, are known to exhibit excellent angiogenesis-inhibitory action (Patent document 1).

The preparing process described in Patent document 1 is useful as a process for preparing urea derivatives, but much room still remains for improvement in terms of total yield. It has therefore been desirable to develop an industrial process for preparing urea derivatives that gives a good total yield, as well as useful intermediates for such a preparing process.<br>
Patent document 1  never discloses an efficient process for preparing urea compounds represented by the general formula (C), nor the useful intermediates represented by the general formulas (A-l) and (A-2), as according to the present invention. Patent document 1: WO02/32872<br><br>
