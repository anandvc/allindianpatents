The compounds of the general formula (I) according to the invention have an unforeseeable, valuable spectrum of pharmacological action.<br>
The compounds of the general formula (1) according to the invention lead to a vasorelaxation, inhibition of platelet aggregation and to a fall in blood pressure and also to an increase in coronary blood flow. These actions are mediated via a direct stimulation of soluble guanylate cyclase and an intracellular cGMP increase. Additionally, the compounds of the general formula (I) according to the invention enhance the action of substances which raise the cGMP level, such as, for example, EDRF (endothelium-derived relaxing factor), NO donors, protoporphyrin IX, arachidonic acid or phenylhydrazine derivatives.<br>
They can therefore be employed in medicaments for the treatment of cardiovascular disorders, such as, for example, for the treatment of high blood pressure and cardiac insufficiency, stable and unstable angina pectoris, peripheral and cardiac vascular disorders, arrhythmias, for the treatment of thromboembolic disorders and ischaemias such as myocardial infarct, stroke, transitory and ischaemic attacks, peripheral circulatory disorders, prevention of restenoses such as after thrombolysis therapy, percutaneous translumino angioplastie (PTA), percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), bypass and also for the treatment of arterioscleroses, asthmatic disorders and disorders of the urogenital system such as, for example, prostate hypertrophy, erectile dysfunction, female sexual dysfunction and incontinence.<br>
The compounds of the general formula (I) described in the present invention are also active compounds for controlling disorders in the central nervous system which are characterized by disturbances of the NO/cGMP system. In particular, they are suitable for eliminating cognitive deficits, for improving learning and memory performance and for treating Alzeimer's disease. They are also suitable for the treatment of disorders of the central nervous system such as states of anxiety, tension and depression, sleeping disorders and sexual dysfunction caused by the central nervous system, and for<br><br>
regulating pathological eating disorders or disorders associated with the use of stimulants and drugs.<br>
Furthermore, the active compounds are also suitable for regulating cerebral circulation, and they are therefore effective agents for controlling migraines.<br>
They are also suitable for the prophylaxis and control of the sequelae of cerebral infarcts (Apoplexia cerebri) such as stroke, cerebral ischaemia and skull-brain trauma. The compounds of the general formula (1) according to the invention can also be employed for controlling pain.<br>
Additionally, the compounds according to the invention have antiinflammatory action and can therefore be employed as antiinflammatories.<br>
The invention moreover includes the combination of the compounds of the general formula (1) according to the invention with organic nitrates and NO donors.<br>
Organic nitrates and NO donors in the context of the invention are, in general, substances which display their therapeutic action by the release of NO or NO species. Sodium nitroprusside, glycerol trinitrate, isosorbide dinitrate, isosorbide mononitrate, molsidomine and SIN-1 are preferred.<br>
The invention additionally includes the combination with compounds which inhibit the degradation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). These are, in particular, inhibitors of phosphodiesterases 1, 2 and 5; nomenclature according to Beavo and Reifsnyder (1990) TiPS 11 p. 150 to 155. The action of the compound according to the invention is potentiated and the desired pharmacological effect is increased by these inhibitors.<br>
To determine the cardiovascular action, the following investigations were carried out: In in vitro investigations on the isolated enzyme and on cells of vascular origin, the<br><br>
effect on guanylate cyclase-dependent cGMP formation was tested with and without NO donor. The anti-aggregatory properties were shown on human platelets stimulated with collagen. The vasorelaxant action was determined in rabbit aortal rings preconcentrated with phenylephrine. The hypotensive action was investigated in anaesthetized and awake rats.<br>
Stimulation of recombinant soluble guanylate cyclase in vitro<br>
The investigations on the stimulation of recombinant soluble guanylate cyclase by the compounds according to the invention with and without NO donor were carried out using the method which is described in detail in the following literature reference. M. Hoenicka, E.M Becker, H. Apeler, T. Sirichoke, H. Schroeder, R. Gerzer and J.-P. Stasch: Purified soluble guanylate cyclase expressed in a baculovirus/Sf9 system: stimulation by YC-1, nitric oxide, and carbon oxide. J. Mol. Med. 77: 14-23 (1999). The results are shown in Fig. 1.<br>
Stimulation of soluble guanylate cyclase in primary endothelial cells<br>
Primary endothelial cells were isolated from pig aortas by treatment with collagenase soln. The cells were then cultured in culture medium at 37⁮C/5% C02 until confluence was reached. For the investigations, the cells were passaged, inoculated into 24-well cell culture plates and subcultured until reaching confluence (~2x 105 cells/well). For the stimulation of endothelial guanylate cyclase, the culture medium was aspirated and the cells were washed once with Ringer solution. After removing the Ringer solution, the cells were incubated for 10 minutes at 37°C/5% C02 in stimulation buffer with or without NO donor (sodium nitroprusside, SNP or DEA/NO 1 uM). Following this, the test substances (final concentration 1 uM) were added to the cells by pipette, and they were incubated for a further 10 minutes. After the incubation time had ended, the buffer solution was aspirated and cold buffer at 4°C was added to the cells. The cells were then lysed at -20°C for 16 hours. The supematants containing the intracellular cGMP were then removed and the cGMP concentration was determined by means ol the<br><br>
cGMP-SPA system (Amersham Buchler, Brunswick). The results are shown in Tables 1 and 2 below:<br>

Vasorelaxant action in vitro<br>
Rabbits are anaesthetized by a blow to the neck and exanguinated. The aorta is removed, freed from adhering tissue, divided into 1.5 mm wide rings and individually<br><br>
transferred under a pretension into 5 ml organ baths containing a warm, carbogen-aerated Krebs-Henseleit solution at 37°C of the following composition (mM): NaCl: 119; KC1: 4.8; CaCl2 x 2 H20: 1; MgSO4 x 7 H20; 1.4; KH2P04: 1.2; NaHC03:25; glucose: 10. The contractility is detected using Statham UC2 cells, amplified and digitalized by means of A/D converters (DAS-1802 HC, Keithley Instruments Munich), and recorded in parallel on linear recorders. To produce a contraction, phenylephrin is added to the bath cumulatively in increasing concentration. After several control cycles, the substance to be investigated is investigated in each further passage in increasing dosage in each case, and the height of the contraction is compared with the height of the contraction achieved in the last preliminary passage. From this, the concentration which is necessary in order to reduce the height of the control value by 50% (IC50) is calculated. The standard administration volume is 5 μl, and the proportion of DMSO in the bath solution corresponds to 0.1%. The, results are shown in Table 3 below.<br><br>

Blood pressure measurements in anaesthetized rats<br>
Male Wistar rats having a bodyweight of 300-350 g are anaesthetized with Thiopental (100 mg/kg i.p.). After tracheotomy, a catheter is inserted into the femoral artery for blood pressure measurement. The substances to be tested are administered orally in Transcutol, Cremophor EL, H20 (10%/20%/70%) in a volume of 1 ml/kg. The results are listed in Table 4 below.<br><br>
Table 4<br><br><br>
Effect on the average blood pressure of awake, spontaneously hypertensive rats<br>
Continuous measurements of blood pressure over 24 hours were carried out on spontaneously hypertensive female rats (MOL.SPRD) having a bodyweight of 200-250 g which were allowed to move around freely. To this end, pressure monitors (Data Sciences Inc., St. Paul, MN, USA) were chronically implanted into the descending abdominal aorta of the animals, below the kidney artery, and the attached transmitter was fixed in the abdominal cavity.<br>
The animals were kept individually in type 111 cages, which were positioned on the<br>
individual receiver stations, and adapted to a 12-hour day/night rhythm. Water and<br>
feed was available freely.	<br>
To collect the data, the blood pressure of each rat was registered every 5 minutes for 10 seconds. In each case, the data for a period of 15 minutes were collected and the average value was calculated from these values.<br>
The compounds to be tested were dissolved in a mixture of Transcutol (10%), Cremophor (20%). mlH20 (70%) and administered orally by means of a stomach tube in a volume of 2 /kg of bodyweight. The doses tested were between 0.3 and 30 mg/kg of bodyweight. The results are shown in Fig. 2 (attached).<br>
Inhibition of platelet aggregation in vitro<br>
To determine the platelet-aggregation, blood from healthy volunteers of both sexes was used. As an anticoagulant, 9 parts of blood were admixed to one part of 3.8% strength sodium citrate solution. The blood was centrifuged at 900 rpm for 20 min. The pH of the platelet-rich plasma obtained was adjusted to pH 6.5 using ACD solution  (sodium   citrate/citric   acid/glucose).   The   platelets  were   subsequently<br><br><br>
centrifuged off and resuspended in buffer and once more centrifuged off. The platelet pellet was suspended in buffer and mixed with an additional 2 mmol/1 of CaCl2.<br>
To measure the aggregation, aliquots of the platelet suspension were incubated with the substance to be tested at 37°C for 10 min. Aggregation was subsequently induced in an aggregometer by addition of collagen and determined at 37°C using the turbidometric method according to Born (Born, G.V.R., J.Physiol. (London), 168, 178-195, 1963). The results are shown in Table 5 below.<br>

Measurement of the erection-promoting action of guanylate cyclase stimulators<br>
For a complete and lasting erection to occur, the cavernous arteries and the entire cavernous body architecture, which is formed by a network of smooth muscle cells and collagen connective tissue, has to be at maximum dilation so that the corpus cavernosum can fill completely with blood (Anderson K.-E. and Wagner G., "Physiology of Penile Erection.". Physiological Reviews 75, 191-236 (1995); Meinhardt W. Kropmann RF, Vermeig P, Lycclama a Nigelholt and Zwartendijk J. "The Influence of Medication on Erectile dysfunction." Int. J. of Impotence Res 9, 17-26 (1997). Relaxation of smooth muscles is mediated by NO which, in the case of sexual stimulation, is released by non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic nerve Fibres in the endothelial cells of the blood vessels of the corpus cavernosum. NO activates guanylatc cyclase, and the resulting increase in cGMP leads to dilation of the smooth muscles of the corpus cavernosum and consequently to an erection. To test the efficacy of the substances according to the invention, awake rabbits were used. The species rabbit was chosen since neurophysiology, haemodynamic and the control of<br><br>
contraction and relaxation of the smooth muscles of the corpus cavemosum of rabbit and man are quite similar (Meyer MF, Taher H., Krah H., Staubesand J., Becker AJ, Kircher M, Mayer B., Jonas U., Forsmann WG., Stief Ch.G. "Intracarvenous Application of SIN-1 in Rabbit and Man: Functional and Toxcological Results." Annals Urol. 27, 179-182 (1993); Taub HC, Lerner SE, Melman A, Christ GJ Relationship between contraction and relaxation in human and rabbit corpus cavemosum." Urology 42, 698-671, (1993).<br>
Method:<br>
Adult male chinchilla rabbits having a weight of 3-5 kg are, after delivery, adapted for several days in isolation. They have free access to water and can feed for two hours per day. The animals are kept in a 10/14 hour day/night rhythm (light switched<br>
on from 8.00 hours onwards). The room temperature is 22 -24 °C.<br><br>
The animals are weighed directly before the start of the experiment. For intravenous administration, the substances according to the invention were dissolved in a mixture of Transcutol (GATTEFOSSE GmbH ) diluted with 20% Cremophor (BASF) and water in a ratio of 3/7. Sodium nitroprusside was dissolved in 0.9% NaCl. The substances were injected at the dosages stated in the table in a volume of 0.5 ml/kg into the auricular vein. For oral administration, the test substances were dissolved in a mixture of glycerol: water: polyethylene glycol 6:10:9.69 and administered at the dosages stated in the table in a volume of 1 ml/kg using the stomach tube.<br>
The effect of guanylate cyclase stimulators is increased by NO donors. This was demonstrated by additionally administering sodium nitroprusside.<br>
The sodium nitroprusside was injected into the auricular vein at a dosage of 0.2 mg/kg simultaneously with the substance according to the invention. If the substance according to the invention was administered orally, the sodium nitroprusside was injected into the auricular vein of these animals 30 min after the oral administration. Corresponding controls were carried out using the solvent and using sodium nitroprusside on its own.<br><br>
At rest, the penis of the rabbit is not visible in the pubic region and is covered completely by the sheath. The erection is assessed by measuring the length of the protruding penis with a calliper square. Measurements are carried out 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 120 and 180 min. after the administration of the substance. The effect is calculated as the product of the length of the penis which is not covered by fur in [mm] and the time for which the erection persists in [min].<br>
Intravenous injection of sodium nitroprusside causes an erection which lasts for approximately 10 min. (110 [mm x min.)).<br>
