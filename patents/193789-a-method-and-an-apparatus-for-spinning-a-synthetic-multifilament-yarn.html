Tne  presenr  invention  relates  to  a  method  and an  apparatus  for  spinning,   drawing,   and  winding  a synthetic  multi-filament  yarn.<br>
U.S.  Patent  No.   4,123,492  discloses  a  method and  apparatus  for  the  spinning,  drawing,  and  winding  of a  synthetic  multi-filament  yarn  in  a  single,   continuous process.     In  such  process,  the  yam  tends  to  shrink, i.e.,   to  shorten,   in  the  package,  thereby  subjecting the  wound  yam  to  a  very  high  tension  which  can. lead  to the  destruction  of  the  package.     The  problem  is especially  serious  in  the  winding  of  both  nylon  6  and nylon  6.6  (polyamide)  yams,   and  polypropylene  yarns. It  is  therefore  necessary  to  subject  the  yarn  to  a shrinkage  treatment  before  winding,   so  as  to  remove  its tendency  to  shrink.    However,  this  additional  procedure is  undesirable  for  textile  technological  reasons, including  the  fact  that  the  tendency  of  the  yarn  to shrink  from  heat  is  useful  in  many  subsequent processing  operations.<br>
It  is  an  object  of  the  present  invention  to provide  a  method  and  apparatus  for  spinning  a  synthetic multi-filament  yam  which  includes  a  shrinkage treatment  which removes  the  tendency  of the yarn  to  shrink  in  the  package,  yet  does  not  significantly effect  the  tendency  to  shrinkage  which  is caused  in particular  by  a  heat  treatment  or  by  boiling,   and  which<br><br>
is  desirable  and  favorable  in  subsequent  processing operations.<br>
It  is  a  more  particular  object  of  the  present invention  to provide  a  method  and  apparatus  of  the described  type  which  includes  a  treatment  which  reduces the  so-called  package  shrinkage,   i.e.,  the  tendency  to cold  shrinkage,  to  a    harmless  degree,  without significantly  effecting  the  hot  shrinkage  tendency which  is  useful  in  many  subsequent  processing operations.<br>
Summary  of  the  Invention<br>
The  above  and  other  objects  and  advantages  of the  present  invention  are  achieved  by  the  provision  of a  method  and  apparatus  which  includes  the  steps  of extruding  a  polymeric  melt  to  form  a  plurality  of advancing  filaments,  and  gathering  the  filaments  to form  an  advancing  yarn.    The  advancing  yarn  is  then subjected  to  a  drawing  operation,  and  thereafter  the advancing  yam  is  heated  by  guiding  the  advancing  yarn  . along  a  path  of  travel  which  is  adjacent  but  at  least essentially  spaced  from  an  elongate  heating  surface. The  heating  surface  is  heated  to  a  temperature  which  is above  the  melting  temperature  of  the  yarn,  and  during such  heating  the  advancing  yarn  is  subjected  to  a tension  which  is  insufficient  to  cause  a  plastic deformation  of  the  yarn.     Finally,  the  advancing  yarn is  wound  into  a  package.<br>
Preferably,  the  temperature  of  the  heating surface  is  more  than  about  100'C  above  the  melting temperature  of  the  yarn,   and  most  preferably,   the temperature  is  between  about  200  and  300C:  above  the melting  temperature  of  the  yarn.<br>
During  the  heating  step,  the  yarn  is subjected to tension which  is  not greter  than  about 0.3  cN/dtex  during  the  heating  step,  and  preferably.<br><br>
the  tension  is  between  about  0. 1  and  0.2  cN/'dtex  during the  heating  step.<br>
The  resulting  yarn  has  a  hot  shrinkage tendency  which  is  greater  than  about  3%,  and  the tendency  is  preferably  more  than  20%,  and most preferably  it  is  between  about  30%  and  about  40%.<br>
An  advantage  of  the  present  invention  is  that the  textile  technological  properties  of  the  yarn  are not  adversely  affected  by  the  shrinkage exeatment  of the  invention.    In  particular,  after  unwinding,  the yam  may  still  exhibit  a  high  hot  shrinkage  tendency, which  is  expressed,   for  example,  as  boiling  shrinkage. Also,   the  feed  rolls  or  feed  systems,  which  advance  the yarn  into  the  shrinkage  treatment  zone  or  withdraw  it therefrom,  need  not  be  heated.    This  is  not  only  a substantial  simplification  of  mechanical  engineering, but  also  permits  a  more  favorable  control  of  the process.     During  the  treatment,  the  yarn  is  subjected only  to  a  yarn  tension which  is  lower  than  the  tension required  for  drawing  the  already  oriented yarn.     In  the case  of  polyamide,  polyester  or polytrimethylene terephthalate  yams,  the  temperature  of  the  heating surface  is  preferably  higher  than  350C,   in  the  case  of polypropylene  yarns  the  surface  teniperature  is preferably  higher  than  200C.<br>
The  present  invention  permits  that  yarn  to advance  in  the  spin  zone  and/or  shrinkage  zone  and/or takeup  zone  under  very  little  tension,  without incurring  the  risk  of  an  unsteady  threadline  or  the formation  of  laps  on  the  godet  or  another  disturbance of  the  process.<br>
In  the  preferred  embodiment,   the  yarn  is guided  along  the  heating  surface  by  one  or  more  short guides  which  are  distributed  along  the  surface.    This<br>
serves the purpose of guiding  the  yarn  at a  precisely<br>
defined  distance  from  the  heated  surface.     A  distance<br>
from  0.5  to  3.5  mm  is  desirable.	<br><br>
AS  noted  above,   it  is  possible  to  advance  the yam  in  the  shrinkage treatment  zone  under  very  little tension.    This  permits  the process  to be  simplified,  in that  the  yarn  tension  is  adjusted  such  that it is simultaneously  suitable  for winding.<br>
In  one  embodiment,  the  heat,  treatment  occurs between  two  yam  feeding  godets.    This  provides  an advantage  in  that  it  is  possible  to  edjunt  the  yam tension  very  uniformly  and,  thus,  the  shrinkage  in  a very  controlled manner.<br>
In  the  short  spinning process,  the yams being  produced  are  very  susceptible  to  shi-inkage,  and they  present  great  problems  during  the  takeup.    In  this instance,   it will  be  advantageous  Co  utilize  an embodiment  of  the  invention wherein  the  yarn  is advanced  directly  from  the  spin  box  to  the  take-up winder  without  the  use  of  yam  feeding  godets,   and  at  a withdrawal  speed which  is  greater than  5000  m/min,  and preferably  between  6000  and  7500  m/min.<br>
The  method  of  the  present  invention  is suitable  for  all  polymers  in  use.     It  allows  to  produce a  high-quality  package  of  polyester  yarn  yh;.ch  has still  a  hot  or  boiling  shrinkage  ol!  rrore  them  20%  after unwinding.<br>
Especially  important  is  the  shrinkage-free treatment  for polyamides.    The  currtently conducted shrinkage-free  treatments,   in  particular  with  vapor, result  in  an  overall  reduction  of  the  snrinkage tendency-      While  the  method  of  the  present  invention permits  removal  only  of  the  shrinkage  in  the  package, the  shrinkage  tendency  remains  unslrif.ngei  when  heat  is supplied,   or  it  remains  adjustablt by  other  parameters of  the  process  control.<br>
This  applies  in  like  manner  to  polypropylene yams,  which  present  in  the  conventional process significant-problems daring  winding.<br><br>
An  especially  advantageous  method  of drawing  in  accordance  with  one  embodiment of.  the present  invention  includes  withdrawing  the  yarn  from the  spinneret  by  means  of  a  godet  at  a  high  speed  of more  than  3,500  m/min.  and  advancing  same  through  a narrow heating  tube,     in  the  heating  tube,   the  yam undergoes  drawing  as  a  result  of  tension  and  heating. Until  now,  this  method  has  been  impractical  for materials  with  a  strong  shrinkage  tendency,   in particular  nylon  and  polypropylene,  since  by  this  kind of  drawing  the  yams  are  imparted  a high  tendency  to shrinkage  in  the  package.    However,  the  combination with  the  method  of  the  present  invention  allows  this draw  method  to  be  applied  to  all  types  of  materials.<br>
Prior  to  the  heat  treatment,  the  yarn  may  be subjected  to  a  drawing  operation  wherein  the  yarn  is guided  closely  adjacent,  but  at  least  essentially spaced  from  an  elongate  heater which  is  neated  to  a temperature  higher  than  the melt point  of  the yarn, preferably  from  100'  to  300C  above  the  melt  point,  and the  yam  is  tensioned  to  an  extent  leading  to  a  plastic deformation  of  the  yarn.     Despite  the  low yjarn  tension in  the  draw  zone,  the  yam  forms  a  precisely  localized yield  point  and  can  be  totally  drawn.    For  the formation  of  a  precisely  established  yield  point,   the method  may be  further  improved by  grinding  the advancing  yarn  over  guides,  while  partially  looping  the same,   before  entering  into  the  draw  zone.<br>
A  further,  advantageous  variant  of  the  method for  the  spinning  includes  withdrawing  the  yarn  from  the spinneret  at  a  speed  of  more  than  500  m/min,  and  so  as to  result  in  the  simultaneous  drawing  of  the  yarn,  as is  known  from  EP  0  539  866  A2.<br>
The  apparatus  of  the  present  invention distinguishes  itself  in  that  despite  the  very  high  yarn speeds,   the  heating  surface  is  very  short, in; particular,   in  a  range  from  300  to  1000  mm.<br><br>
The  heater  of  the  present  invention  may  take the  form  of  a  generally  U-shaped  body  or  rail,  which defines  a  longitudinal  heating  surface  in a  groove thereof  and  with  the  yarn  being  guided  to  have essentially  no  contact with  the heating  surface.    This construction permits  a  simple  operation  and,   in particular,  a  simple  selection  of  the  distance  at  which the  yam  advances  from  the  heated  surface.     In  this embodiment,  this  distance  may  be  predetermined  by  yarn guides  as  a  function  of  the  yam  material,   the  denier, the  number  of  filaments,  the  yarn  speed,   and  the adjusted  temperature  of  the  heating  surface.<br>
The  body  or  rail  of  the  heater  may  comprise two  separate  body  segments  which  are  positioned  in  an end  to  end  relationship,   and  which  have  separate temperature  controls.    Besides  a  smooth  advance  of  the yarn,   this  embodiment  allows  in particular  a  stepped temperature  control  that  is  adapted  to  the  process. For  example,  a  first  step  is  controlled  in  a temperature  range  from  450  to  550C,   and  the  second step  in  a  temperature  range  from  400  to  500C.<br>
The  invention  applies  to  all  polyamides, polyester,  as  well  as  polytrimethylene  terephthalate (PTT).     In  the  case  of  polypropylene,  the  temperatures are  correspondingly  lower,  preferably  by  100C  to 200'C.<br>
A  combination  of  the  invention  which  is especially  favorable  in  terms  of  process  er.ginefering, utilizes  in  the  draw  zone  a  narrow  tube  surrounding  the threadline,   into  which  the  yarn  advancing  from  the spinneret  enters  without  passing  over  a  godet.     This simple  solution  of  mechanical  engineering  becomes possible  for  all  materials  only  as  a  result  of  this invention.     Where  the  yam  is  withdrawn  from  the spinning zone by means of  an  unheated  godet or  the like,   and  advanced  to  the  draw zone,  the   invention requires  no  special  measures  to  reduce  the  shrinkage<br><br>
tendency of the yarn already in the draw zone. Thus, additional possibilities of adjustment are obtained, so as to modify the other yam properties, in particular, tensile strength and elongation. It is possible to spin in particular highly oriented or fully oriented yams in a continuous process.<br>
Important advantages result from the shrinkage treatment. The invention allows the so-called "package shrinkage", i.e. the tendency to cold shrinkage, to be reduced to a harmless degree, or to be eliminated, without thereby adversely effecting the hot shrinkage tendency, i.e., boiling shrinkage or hot air shrinkage. From the viewpoint of textile or technology, it is not desirable to adjust the hot shrinkage tendency to the requirements of winding, but to the requirements of subsequent processing operations. Thus, for example, a certain shrinkage tendency is desired in a sewing yam, so that the seam can adjust itself to the shrinkage of the fabric. When employing the yam for hosiery, the leg shape is obtained, in that the untreated hose is pulled over a flat board and adjusts itself to same by heat treatment and shrinkage. In other fabrics, such as corduroy, shrinkage causes the density to increase. In all these cases, the requirement for shrinkage-free winding in accordance with the invention has no disturbing influence on the tendency to heat shrinkage that is to be achieved.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a method of spinning a synthetic multi-filament yam comprising the steps of extmding a polymeric melt to form a plurality of advancing filaments, and gathering the filaments to form an advancing yam, drawing the advancing yam, and thereafter<br><br>
heating the advancing yam by guiding the advancing yam along a path of travel which is adjacent but at least essentially spaced from an elongate heating surface, with the heating surface being heated to a temperature which is above the melting temperature of the yam, and while subjecting the advancing yam to a tension which is insufficient to cause a plastic deformation of the yam, and then winding the advancing yam into a package.<br>
Accordingly the present invention also provides an apparatus for spinning a synthetic multi-filament yam as herein-above described, said apparatus comprising means for extruding a polymeric melt to fomi a plurality of advancing filaments, and gathering the filaments to form an advancing multi-filament yam, means for drawing the advancing yam and so as to define a drawing zone, means defining a draw-free zone downstream of said drawing zone and wherein the advancing yam is subjected to a tension insufficient for drawing of the yam, a heater positioned within the draw-free zone and comprising an elongate heating surface, and means for heating the heating surface to a temperature which is above the melting temperature of the yarn, and a winder positioned downstream of said heater for winding the advancing yam into a package.<br>

Detailed  Description  of  the  Preferred  Embodiments Referring  more  particularly  to  the  drawings. Figure  1  illustrates  a  melt  spinning  apparatus  wherein a  yarn  1  is  spun  from  a  thermoplastic  material.     The thermoplastic  material  is  supplied  through  a  hopper  2 to  an  extruder  3,    The  extruder  3  is  driwen  by  a  motor 4,  which  is  controlled  by  a  control  unit  49.     in  the extruder  3,  the  thermoplastic  material  is  melted.     The work  of  deformation  (shearing  energy),  which is  applied by  the  extruder  3  to  the  material,  assists  in  the melting  process.     In  addition,  a  heater,   for  example  in the  form  of  a  resistance  heater  5,   is  provided,  which is  controlled  by  a  heating  control  unit  SO.     Through  a melt  line 6,  which  includes  a  pressure  sensor  7  for measuring  the  melt  pressure  so  as  to  control  the pressure  and  speed  of  extruder  3,  the  melt  reaches  a gear  pump  9,  which  is  driven  by  a  pump  motor  44.'    The pump  motor  44  is  controlled  by  a  control  unit  45,   so  as to  permit  a  very  fine  adjustment  of  the pump  speed. The  pump  9  transports  the  melt  to  a  heated  spin  box  10, the  underside  of  which  mounts  a  spinneret   lA.     From  the, spinneret  ll,  the  melt  emerges  in  the  form  of  fine<br><br>
strands  of  filaments  12.     The  filament  strands  advance through  a  cooling  shaft  15.    In  the  cooling  shaft  15, an  air  current  is  directed  crosswise  or  radially  to  the web  of  filaments  12,  thereby  cooling  the  filaments.<br>
At  the  outlet  end  of  cooling  shaft  15,  the web  of  filaments  is  combined  to  form  the  yarn  1.     The yarn  is  withdrawn  from  the  cooling  shaft  15 and  from spinneret  11  by  a  godet  54.     The  yarn  loops  several times  about  godet  54.     To  this  end  a  guide  roll  55  is used,  which  is  axially  inclined  relative  to  the  godet 54.    The  guide  roll  55  is  freely  rotatable.    The  godet 54  is  driven  by  a  motor  at  a  preadjustable  speed.     This withdrawal  speed  is  by  a  multiple  higher  than  the natural  exit  speed  of  the  filaments  12  from  the spinneret,  thereby  subjecting  the  yarn  to  a  very  high tension,   which  leads  to  its  drawing.    The  drawing  is assisted  by  a  heating  tube  20  which  defines  a  draw heating  zone  31.    The  heating  tube  20  measures,   for example,   1.150  m  long.     It  is  heated  to  a  temperature, which  is  for  polyester  and  PTT  from  140'  to  180'C,   for polypropylene  from  100  to  150C,  and  for  polyamide from  140'  to  220'C.    The  yield  point  of  the  yam  is located  in  an  inlet  region  of  this  heating  tube.     The temperature  control  in  the  further  extension  of  the heating  tube  permits  the  properties  of  the  yarn,   such as  its  strength,  boiling  shrinkage,  and  elongation,   to be  adjusted.     Such  a  heating  tube  is  described,   for example,   in  DE  38  08  854,   which  corresponds  to  U.S. Patent  No.   4,902,461,  and  also  in  DE  37  20  337.<br>
The  godet  54  is  followed  by  a  second  godet  16 with  a  guide  roll  17,   before  the  yarn  1  is  wound  in  a takeup  30  to  a  package  33.<br>
Arranged  between  godets  54  and  16  is  a  heater a  in  accordance  with  the  invention.     The  heater  8  is  an elongate body or rail a long which  the  yarn  advances slightly  spaced  apart  therefrom.    This  elongate  heater is  divided  into  several  segments,   namely  a  first<br><br>
heating  zone  27  and  a  second  heating  zone  38  as illustrated,  which  may  be  heated  independently  of  each other,   as  is  described  in  more  detail  below.<br>
From  godet  16  of  Figure 1  or   Figure  3, the  yam  1  advances  to  a  so-called  "apex  yarn  guide"  25 and  thence  to  a  traversing  triangle  26.    Not  shown  in Figure  1  is  the  traversing mechanism,  which  comprises two  oppositely  rotating  blades  that  reciprocate  the. yam  1  over  the  length  of  package  33.     In  so  doing,  the yam  loops  about  a  contact  roll   (not  shown)   downstream of  the  yam  traversing  mechanism.    The  contact  roll lies  against  the  surface  of  package  33.     It  serves  to measure  the  surface  speed  of  package  33,  which  is formed  on  a  tube  35.    The  tube  35  Is  clamped  on  a winding  spindle  34.    The  winding  spindle  34  is  driven by  a  motor  and  a  control  unit  such  that  the  surface speed  of  package  33  remains  constant.    To  this  end  and for  use  as  a  control  variable,  the  speed  of  the  freely rotatable  contact  roll  is  sensed.<br>
It  should  be  noted  that  the  yam traversing  mechanism  may  also  be  a  standard  cross-spiralled  roll  with  a  yam  guide  traversing  in  the cross-spiralled  groove.<br>
In  one  embodiment,  a  polypropylene  yam with  a  filament  denier  from  0.7  to  3  dtex  is  spun  and withdrawn  from  the  spinneret  11  by  godet  54  and  at  a speed  higher  than  3,500  and  4,500  m/min,,  the  yam being  subjected  to  a  sudden  heating  in  heater  8.     The godet  16  has  a  circumferential  speed,  which  is  not higher  than  that  of  godet  54.    Thus,  the  yarn  is  not drawn/  and  it  is  essentially  relaxed  as  it  passes through  the  heater,     in  this  embodiment,  the  heater  is operated  at  very  high  temperatures  above  the  melting point,   i.e.,   substantially  above  220'C.     The  first  zone 27  of  the  elongate  heater  is  heated  to  330'C  and  the second  zone 28 to 150C.This  allows as acequate relaxation  treatment  between  godets  16  and  54  to  be<br><br>
achieved,  which  continues  even  into  the  takeup  zone. Preferably,  the  temperatures  of  the  first  heating  zone 27  are  somewhat  higher  than  those  of  the  second  heating zone  28,  nanely  in  a  preferred  range  from  250*  to 550C.    The  temperature  of  the  second  heading  zone  29 is  preferably  from  150  to  450'C.    The  yarn  tension between  godets  54  and  16  can  be  adjusted  to  less  than 0.1  cN/dtex,  taking  into  account  the  speed  difference and  the  shrinkage  forces.     This  range  is  especially advantageous  for  activating  or  eliminating  the  tendency to  cold  shrinkage.    The  temperature  control,   in particular  in  the  second  heating  zone  28,  permits  the hot  shrinkage  tendency  to  also  be  influenced  in  a controlled  manner,  without  thereby  adversely  affecting the  cold  shrinkage  tendency  that  is  detrimental  to winding.<br>
A  further  godet  21  and  guide  zoll  22  may  be arranged  upstream  of  godet  54,  as  is  shown  in  Figure  3. In  this  instance,   a  subsequent  drawing  occurs  between these  godets  21  and  54.    To  this  end,   the  speed  of godet  54  is  adjusted  higher  than  the  speed  of  godet  21. A  tension  is  applied,   which  leads  to  a  further<br><br>
deformation  of  the  yarn  I.     Preferably, a  further  heat treatment  also  occurs  between  these  two  godets.    To this  end,  a  heater  24  is  shown  in  Figure  3.    The  heater has  a  heating  surface  29  that  faces  the  yarn  1.     The yarn  1  advances  therealong  without  contacting,   but closely  adjacent  this  heated  surface  29,   at:  a  distance from  0.5  to  5  mm.     The  surface  temperature  is  adjusted higher  than  the  melting  point  of  the  particular polymer.     This  subsequent  drawing  and  the  sudden heating  provided  therein  allow  to  achieve  an influencing  of  the  crystal  structure  in  the  meaning  of a  greater  long-term  stability  of  the  yam.       As  a result,   the  effectiveness  of  the  subsequent  treatment<br><br>
between  godets  54  and  16  is  amplified,  and  the  pacJcage shrinkage  and  the  tendency  to  shrink  on  the  package  are further  reduced.<br>
It  should  be  noted  that  otherwise  the  method shown  in  Figure  3  corresponds  to  that  described  above with  respect  to  Figure  1.     When  the  methods  of  Figures 1  and  3  are  employed,  it  is  possible  to  wind subsequently  both  soft  and  especially  shrinkage-sensitive,  hard  packages,  which will  not  exhibit  a detrimental  package  shrinkage  with  damage  or destruction  of  the  package,  even  in  their  long-term behavior.    Both  methods  are  carried  out  in  that  the yam  is  withdrawn  from  the  spinneret  H  at  a  very  high speed  of  more  than  3,500  m/min  by  means  of  godet  54  in the  instance  of  Figure  1,   and  by  means  of  godet  21  in the  instance  of  Figure  3.     In  the  case  of  Figure  3,  the subsequent  drawing  may  amount  to  another  10  to  30%.<br>
The  modification  of  the  crystalline  structure and  the  increase  of  the  length  stability,   as  provided by  the  process  of  Figure  3,  may  also  be  produced  in  a method  as  shown  in  Figure  l,   in  that  the  heating  tube 20  in  the  draw  heating  zone  31  is  replaced,   as  shown  in Figure  4,  with  an  elongate  surface,  along  which  the yam  advances  without  substantially  contacting  same, the  surface  temperature,   as  described  with  reference  to Figure  3,  being  above  the  melt  point  of  the  polymer. Unlike  in  the  case  of  heating  tube  20,   the  necessary draw  force  is  not  applied  by  air  friction,   but  by  the friction  of  the yam  on yam  guides  132.     shown  in Figure  4  is  as  a  further modification  that  upon  its entry  into  the  draw  zone,  the  yarn  partially  loops about  several   (shown  are  two)   successively  arranged yam  guides  132,   so  that  the  yield  point  of  the  yarn becomes  localized  as  a  result  of  its  heading.<br>
As anlternative  to  the  method  shown  in Figure  1,  a  variant  of  the  method  is  shown in  Figure  4, which  comprises  a  heat  treatment  between  godet  16  and<br><br>
takeup  winder  30.    The  fact  that  in  the  shrinkage treatment  zone  the  yam  may be  advanced  under very little  tension  permits  an  adjustment  that  makes  the yam  tension  simultaneously  suitable  as  takeup  tension. Since  otherwise  the  sequence  of  the  method  shown  in Figure  corresponds  to  that  of  Figures  1-3,   the description  thereof  is  herewith  incorporated  by reference.<br>
In  the  variant  of  the  method  as  shown  in Figure  5,  the  yam  1  is  withdrawn  from  the  spinneret  11 not  by  godets,  but  directly by means  of  takeup  winder 30.    In  this  instance,  the  withdrawal  speed  is  above 5,000  m/min.,  preferably  from  6,000  to  7,500  m/min.    In this  process,  the  yam  1  is  drawn  simultaneously  with the  spinning.    More particularly,  the  draying  occurs immediately  downstream  of  the  spinneret  11  and  while the  hot  filaments  and  yarn  are  being  cocled.     The drawing  ceases  at  a  point  wherein the  tension  supplied by  the  winder  30  is  too  low  to  deform  the  cooled  yam, and  the  heater  8  is  positioned  downstream  of  the  point where  drawing  ceases,  and  upstream  of  the  takeup  winder 30.     Thus  during  the  heating  operation  in  the  heater  8, the  yarn  is  subjected  to  substantially  the  same  tension under  which  the  yarn  is  withdrawn  from the  spinneret. This  process  is  particularly  suitable  for  producing without  difficulty  yarns  which  are  highly  susceptible to  shrinkage  as  a  result  of  the  spin  and  draw  method. As  regards  the  components  of  the  apparatus  not described  in  this  connection,  refensnce  may  be  made  to the  description  of  Figures  1  and  3.<br>
Shown  in  Figure  6  is  a  modification  of  the method,  which  does  not  differ  with  respect  to  the shrinkage  heat  treatment  from  the  method  of Figure  4 that  is  herewith  incorporated  by  reference.     Once  the bundle of filaments 12 is  combine to yarn 1  by  yarn<br>
guide  56,  the  yam  1  advances  to  godet  21.    The  godet 21 being  looped  by  yarn  1  several  times  withdraws<br><br>
yam  i  from  spinneret  H  and  advances  the  yarn  into  a draw  zone.     In  the  draw  zone,   a  heater  24  is  arranged between  godet  21  and  godet  54,     While  undergoing  a drawing,  the  yarn  1  advances  over  the  heating  surface 29  closely  adjacent  thereto  but  without  substantially contacting  sane.     The  heating  surface  29  is  heated  to  a temperature  higher  than  the  melt  point  bf  yarn  l.    The tension  required  for  the  drawing  is  adjusted  between godets  21  and  54.<br>
It  should  be  remarked  that  in  all  cases,   the godets  with  guide  rolls  may  be  replaced  with  two  or more  successively  arranged,  driven  rolls,  which  are looped  by the  yam  in  part  in  s-direction  and/or  Z-direction,   i.e.  successively  in  opposite  direction.<br>
This  method  has  proven  that,   in particular, the  sudden  heat  treatment  at  a  high  temperature  results simultaneously  in  a  recovery  of  the  molecular  structure of  the  highly  partially  oriented  polyprcpylene  yarn,   so that  the  residual  shrinkage  of  the  yarn  is  reduced very substantially.     In  normal  processes,  the  shrinkage free treatment,   i.e.  the  elimination  of  the  shrinkage tendency,  acts  to  reduce  simultaneously  both  the tendency  to  cold  shrinkage  and  the  tendency  to  heat shrinkage.    This  applies  in  particular  to  the  vapor treatment methods  of  the  prior  art.    The  invention, i.e.   a  relaxation  zone  with  a  sudden  heating  of  the yarn,  permits  the  tendency  to  cold  shrinkage  to  be selectively  eliminated  and,  preferably,   it  permits  the tendency  to  heat  shrinkage  to  be  influenced  in  a controlled manner.<br>
It  should  be  pointed  out  that,  contrary  to conventional  methods,   in  which  all  godets  for withdrawing,  drawing,  and  relaxing  the  polypropylene yarn  are  heated,  the  godet  54  is  unheated,   and  that  it is  likewise not necessary  to  heat  godet  16.<br><br>
It  should  be  added,  however,  that  one  of  the two  godets  S4  or  16  may  also  be  heated,   for example,  to about  100'C,   so  as  to  reduce  likewise  the  tendency  to heat  shrinkage  in  a  controlled manner.<br>
The  method  of  the  present  invention  can  be successfully  applied  to  standard  polymers,   such  as polyethylene  terephthalate,  polytrimethylene terephthalate,  polypropylene,   and  polyamide (preferably,  PA  6  and  PA 6.6,  but  also  PA  blends  of different  types  of  PA).    Very  good  results  are  obtained with  polypropylene  with  a  narrow  molecular  weight distribution  in  a  range  smaller  than  3,   i;i  particular with  types  produced  on  the  basis  of  metallccene, inasmuch  as  these  yams  permit  the  spin-draw  process, i.e.  spinning  and  drawing  in  one  operation  and  in  the same  zone,  as  is  shown  for  example  in  Figure  l,  to  be used with  a  heating  tube.<br>
It  should  be  emphasized  that  a  favorable effect  can  also  be  achieved  by  subjecting, the  yarn  to an  additional  vapor  treatment.       To  this  end  a  hot vapor  nozzle  23  is  provided  directly  at  the  inlet  end of  the  heater 8,  which  blows  hot  vapor  to  the  yam. This  hot  vapor  condenses  immediately  on  the  not-yet heated  yarn  and  evaporates  thereafter.     Duz'ing  the condensation,  the  yam  receives  the  corresponding amount  of  heat.    On  the  other hand,   the  subsequent evaporation  prevents  a  very  sudden  heating  of  the  yam.-This  protective  treatment  of  the  yarn  could  be advantageous,   and  will  lead  in  any  event,  to  a  rapid reduction  of  the  heat  shrinkage.    The  Le-tter  can  be adjusted  by  this  treatment.     Likewise,   t.he  following sudden  heat  treatment  at  a  high  temperature  results  in a  reduction  of  the  cold  shrinkage.     However,   the favorable  effects  of  the  present  invention  do  not appear  to require the  use  of  the  hot  vappor nozzle.<br><br>
The  heating  apparatus 9,  as  shown  in  Figures 2a-2c,  consists  of  an  elongate  body  or  rail  114   (Figure 2c)  that  is  provided with  two  longitudinal  grooves  112 and  is  composed  of  a  material  which  is  heat  resistant and  nonscaling,   and  which  withstands  temperatures  in  a range  above  450'C  over  long  peripds  of  time  without undergoing  noteworthy  changes.    The  body  114  is generally  U-shaped  in  cross  sectional  configuration  and includes  a  substantially  flat  base  portion  116  which constitutes  the heating  surface  117.    Connected  with the  base  portion  are  three  walls  118,   120,   122,  between which  the  longitudinal  grooves  112  are  locared. However,   it  is  also  possible  to  provide  base  portion 116  with  two  or more  than  three  upwardly  directed walls,  between  which  correspondingly  more  or  less grooves  extend.     The  outer  walls  118  and  122  may,   for example,  be  bolted  to  base  portion  116.    Arranged between  the walls  118  and  122  and the  base  pprtion  116 is  one  heating  element  124,   126  each,  preferably  in  the form  of  a  rod-shaped,  electrical  resistor,   which extends  over  the  entire  length  of  body  114,   or  which may  also  be  divided  over  the  length  into  several segments,   so  as  to  enable  controlled  heating  profiles. The  heating  elements  124,   126  are  provided  with  plug contacts   (not  shown)   for  their  connection  to  a  source of  current.<br>
Center  wall  120  which  is  located  between<br>
i<br>
outer  walls  118  and  122  and  extends  vertically  from base  portion  116,  either  is  integral  therewith,   or  it is  connected  with  bottom  116  in  like  manaer  as  outer walls  118  and  122.<br>
As  an  alternative,  the  body  114  may  have  a cross  section  similar  to  an  extruded  profile,   in which the  base  portion  116  and  walls  118,   120,   122;  are  made of  one  piece,,  and  which  is  provided  in known  manner with  recesses,  bores,  bendable  flaps,  or  the'like  for receiving  the  heating  elements.<br><br>
Inserted  in  walls  ll8,   120,   122 at  regular intervals  A  from  one  another  are  recesses or  bores  128 having  substantially  the  sane  depth,  the  recesses  128 arranged  in  center  wall  120  being  offset  by  the  spacing A  from  the  recesses  128  in  side  walls  118 and  122.    The recesses  have  a  circular-cylindrical  shape.    Each recess  128  is  intersected  by  longitudinal grooves  112 along  a  secant  line,  so  that  walls  118,   120,   122 exhibit  a  slot  133,   i.e.  a  rectangular  oppring,   facing the  axial  grooves  112.     in  the  illustrated  embodiment, the  recesses  extend  perpendicularly  to  the  groove bottom,  and  their  depth  corresponds  to  the  height  of walls  118,  120,   122,  in  which  they  are  accommodated. Under  certain  circvimstances,   it  may  be  advantageous  to incline  the  recesses.<br>
Each  recess  128  accommodates a  yarn  guide<br>
132,	the  cross  sectional  shape  of  which  corresponds  to the  cross  section  of  the  recess  both  in  size  and  shape, and  which,  for  purposes  of  maintaining  close tolerances,  rests  firmly,  but  with  a  play,   against  the wall  of  the  recess.    The  clearance  between  the  wall  of the  recesses  and  the  peripheral  surface  of  the  yam guides,   as  shown  in  the  drawing,   is  exaggerated  only for  reasons  of  clarity.     In  the  region of  each  slot<br>
133,	a  portion  of  each  yarn  guide  132  extends  into  the axial  grooves  112  such  that,   on  opposite sides  of grooves  112,   successively  arranged  yarn  guides  132 extend  by  a  certain  dimension,   for  example  0.1  to  1  mm, beyond  a  central  plane  extending  parallal  to  walls  118,; 120,   122.     Otherwise,   the  width  of  the  slots  133  is smaller  than  the  largest  cross  sectional dimension, i.e.,   than  the  diameter  of  yarn  guides   132,   so  that they  are  unable  to  slide  out  of  recesses  128.<br>
In  the  illustrated  embodiment,  both  recesses<br>
128  and yarn guides 132	a  circular-cylindrical<br>
cross  section.    Other  angular  as  well  as rounded shapes,   such  as  ellipses,   diamonds,   triangles,   etc.   are<br><br>
possible.     The  embodiment  has  a  fit  between  recesses 128  and  yarn  guides  132,  which  is  kept  witthin accordingly  close  tolerances.    As  a  result,   separate fastening  means  to  secure  yam  guides  132  against  axial and  radial  displacements  are  not  needed,  thereby eliminating  special  expcmses,  which  would  otherwise result  from  the  use  of  fastening  means.    The  embodiment of  Figure  2c  may  also  have  clearance  or  transition fits.     On  the  one  hand,  these  fits  are  narrow  enough, so  that  the  yam  guides  rest  immovably  in  their recesses.    On  the  other  hand,  however,  the  fits  are also  selected wide  enough,   so  as  to  make  it  easy  to pull  out  the  yam  guides  from  their  recesses  and replace  or  omit  same.<br>
For  purposes  of  securing  the  yarn  guides  in the  axial  direction,  sheet  metal  caps  152  ere  used.    To this  end,   side  walls  118,   120,   122  are  provided  on their  upper  edge  with  retaining  grooves  154  or  a  head 156,  which  is  wider  than  the  respective  wall.     In  cross sectional  view,  the  sheet  metal  caps  152  have  a  cup-shaped  profile,  so  that  in  the  case  of  center  wall  120 they  extend  into  retaining  grooves  154,  or  that  in  the case  of  side  walls  118,   122  they  embrace  wall  head  156. otherwise,  the  sheet metal  caps  are  constructed  as elongate  profiles,  the  length  of  which  corresponds  to that  of  the  yam  heater.     The  thickness  of  wall  heads 156  and  the  position  of  retaining  grooves 154, respectively,   as  well  as  the  corresponding  dimensioning of  the  sheet  metal  caps  are  such  that  the  sheet  metal caps  secure  the  yarn  guides  in  the  axial,  direction.<br>
The  yam  guides  132  consist  of  materials commonly  used  for  this  purpose,   such  as  silicon, titanium,   or  aluminum  oxides,   or  of  nit::ided  or chromium  plated  steel,   or  the  like.<br>
Preferably in  the region in  which  they<br>
project  from  recess  slot  133,   the  yarn  guides  132  are conically  beveled  on  their  ends  facing  away  from  the<br><br>
base  portion  116,  as  is  indicated  at  134.    As  a  result, the  yarn  guides  132  successively  arranged  in  opposite walls  lle  and  120,  or  122  and  120  form  in  the  cross sectional  direction  of  the  heating  apparatus  8 respectively  a  V-shaped  groove  136,  which  permits  to guide  a  yam  138  in  its  stretched condition  between yarn  guides  132,  without  any  special  auxiliary  measures or  arrangements  between  successive  yarn  guides  132,   in a  movement  substantially  perpendicular  with  respect  to heating  surface  112  and  base  portion  116.     There,  the yam  138  resting  against  the  contact  surfaces  forms then  a  zigzagged  yarn  path.<br>
Arranged  at  the  ends  or  at  several  other points  (see  Figures  2a  and  2c)  of  the  body  114,  and substantially  equally  spaced  apart,  are  spacers  140, which  bridge  the  groove  112.     These  yam  guide  elements have  an  upward  directed  yam  guide  surface,   which serves  to  maintain  a  spacing  between  the  yarn  and  the groove  bottom.     These  rod-shaped  spacers  140  are anchored  in  transverse  bores  provided  in  the  walls  116, 120,   122.<br>
As  shown  in  Figure  2a,   the  heater  8  may<br>
consist  of  two  body  segments  114a  and  114b   one<br>
following  the  other  in  direction  of  the  advancing  yam.<br>
While  these  segments  differ  in  length,   they  otherwise<br>
have  the  same  cross  sectional  shape.     The  purpose  of<br>
such  a  bipartite  arrangement  may  lie  in  the  different<br>
heating  of  heater  8  over  different  length  segments,   so<br>
as  to  treat  yam  138  in  a  heat  profile  which  satisfies<br>
its  properties.     It  is  also  possible  to  use  more  than<br>
the  two  illustrated  segments.     In  this  arrangement,   it<br>
is  especially  important  that  the  angle  which  the  two<br>
yam  heating  segments  form  with  one  another,   is	<br>
identically  adjusted  at  each  processing  station  of  the spin-draw  machine,   so  as  to  produce  yarns  of  the  same quality  in  all processing  stations.    To  mount  the  two yarn  heating  segments  a  mounting  support:  188  is  used,<br><br>
which  has  the  length  of  the  two  heater  segments.    The mounting  support has  a U-shaped  cross  section.    The yani  heating  segments  are  attached  to  the  bottom  of  the mounting  support  by  means  of  spacers  100.     The dimensioning  of  the  spacers  and  their  position  relative to  the  heating  segment  allow  to  define  the  inclination of  the  heating  segment  with  respect  to  the  straight mounting  support  158.    In  this  arrangement,  the  two heating  segments  are  inclined  oppositely,  and  form with each  other  an  obtuse  angle.    Thus,  mounting support  158 is  used  on  the  one  hand  for  a  specific  fastening  of  the two  heating  segments,     since  mounting  support  158  has  a U-shaped  profile,   it  embraces,  however,   also  the  two heating  segments.     Therefore,   the  mo\inting  support  158 also  serves  to  make  the  temperature  constiant  over  the length  and  width  of  the  heating  segment».    The  mounting support  is  preferably  surrotinded  by  an  insulation.<br>
As  already  indicated,  rod-shaped  spacers 140  may  be  provided,  which  bridge  over  axial  groove  112 on  its  bottom,   i.e.,  they  extend  over  hieating  surface 117  and  define  the  yarn  path  at  a  specific  distance spaced  from  the  groove  bottom.    Alternatively  or additionally,   it  is  possible  to  provide  a  few  or  all yam  guides  132  with  a  peripheral  guide edge,   for example,  a  circumferential  groove  142   (Figure  2a),  the height  of  which  as  measured  from  the  groove  bottom,   is brought  in  line  with  the  height  of  the.  yarn  path  that is  predetermined  by  spacers  140.     In  this  manner,  the yarn  advancing  in  the  groove  is  guided  by  the  lateral edges  of  the  groove.     The  circumferential  grooves  have the  same  depth  over  the  circumference,   i.e.,   they  are made  concentric  with  yarn  guides  132.     However,   it  is also  possible  to  construct  the  circumferential  grooves with  a  depth  varying  over  the  circumference,   for example.in that the groove  bottom is cut  circular-cylindrically,  but  eccentrically  with  respect  to  yam guides  132.     In  this  instance,  a  turning  of  the  yarn<br><br>
guides creates the possibility of finely adjusting the contact between yarn 138 and yarn guides 132, and of forming a zigzagged yarn path. This could be realized by turning the yam guides 132 jointly and to the sane extent, for example, by means of a linkage (hot shown) that  interconnects  the  yarn  guides.<br>
The  heater  8  is  accommodated  in  an  insulated box  (not  shown),   in which  it  is  embedded  in  a  thermally insulated  material,   for  example,   fiber  glass.     The insulated  box may  be  provided with  a  flap,  which permits  to  open  it,   so  as  to  provide  access  to  heater 8,   and  to  thread  the  yam.     Puz±hermore,  the  insulated box  serves  with  its  components  extending  over  the heater  to  axially  secure  yarn  guides  132  in  the  body 114.     To  this  end,  the  insulated  box  is  provided  with slots,  which  are  aligned  with  the  central  plane  and the bevels  134  of  yarn  guides  132,  and  which  permit  a  yarn 138  to  be  treated  to  be  inserted  or  threaded  between the  yarn  guides  132.    On  their  side  walls,   the  slots are  provided with wear-resistant  insulating  plates.<br>
Likewise, if need be, the electrical contacts required for heating elements 124, 126 are accommodated in  the  insulated  box.<br>
As  can  be  noted  from  all  embodiinents,  the peripheral  surfaces,  on  which  the  yarn  contacts  the yarn  guides,  have  a  relatively  large  diameter.  , Contrary  thereto,  the  zigzag  line,  along  which  the  yarn advances  as  a  result  of  the  overlap  U of.  sixccessive yarn  guides,  has  a  relatively  small  amplitude  with  a relatively  large  spacing  A between  two  neighboring  yarn guides.    This  allows  the  looping  angle,   at  which  the yam  loops  about  the  yam  guides  or  the  contact surfaces  formed  on  same,   to  be  small  whan  summed.<br>
In  the  embodiment  of  Figure  2b,   the  heating  rail  is provided on its  side  facing  away  from  axial groove  112  with  two  grooves,  which  extend  substantially below  respective  ones  of  the  yam  guide  grooves  112.<br><br>
Inserted  into  these  grooves  are  the  heating  elements 124  and  12C.    The  heating  elements  are  clamped  in  place by  mounting  plate  159,  which  extends  over  the  entire length  of  the  yam  heater.     To  this  end,  the  mounting plate  is  likewise  provided  with  grooves,  which  surround heating  elements  124,   12C.     By  detaching  the  mounting plate  159,  the  heating  elements  124,  126  can  easily  be exchanged.<br>
The  distance  of  the  yarn  from  heating, surface 117  is  very  small.    The  distance  is  in a  range  from  0.5 to  5  mm.     Preferably,  the  upper  value  is  no  more  than 3.5  mm,   so  as  to  realize  a  satisfactory  transfer  of heat  and  an  exact,  trouble-free  temperature  control. For  reasons  of  practicability,  the  lower  limit  value  is 0.5  mm.     As  a  result,   at  a  correspondingly  high temperature  of  the  heating  rail  of  more  than  350'C,  the yam  undergoes  a  sudden  heating.    The  yarn  guides  132 may  also  be  left  out  at  least  in  part,   or  they  may  be removed,   should  they  have  a  negative  effect.     On  the one  hand,  they  contribute  to  smoothing  the  yam,   but they  barely  serve  to  heat  the  yarn  as  it  advances  in contact  therewith.    On  the  other  hand,  the  yarn  guides exert  only  little  friction  on  the  yarn,   because  of  its small  looping.     Importantly,  however,   is  the noncontacting  advance  of  the  yarn  closely  adjacent  to the  highly  heated  heating  surface.<br>
As  an  alternative  to  the  heater  i  as illustrated  in  Figures  2a-2c,  the  heater  for  reducing the  shrinkage  tendency  may  take  the  form  of  an externally  heated  tube,   through  which  the  yarn  advances without  significant  contact  between  the  advancing  yarn and  the  tube.     The  tube  will  provide  a  satisfactory uniform  control  of  the  heat  and  it  may  b«  slotted  to facilitate  thread-up  of  the  yarn.<br>
In  the  drawings  and  the  specification,   there has  been set forth preferred  embodiments of  the invention,  and,   although  specific  terms  are  employed,<br><br>
the  terms  are  used  in  a  generic  and  descriptive  sense only  and  not  for  the  purpose  of  limitation,  the  scope of  the  invention  being  set  forth  in  the  following claims.<br><br><br><br><br>
Tne  presenr  invention  relates  to  a  method  and an  apparatus  for  spinning,   drawing,   and  winding  a synthetic  multi-filament  yarn.<br>
U.S.  Patent  No.   4,123,492  discloses  a  method and  apparatus  for  the  spinning,  drawing,  and  winding  of a  synthetic  multi-filament  yarn  in  a  single,   continuous process.     In  such  process,  the  yam  tends  to  shrink, i.e.,   to  shorten,   in  the  package,  thereby  subjecting the  wound  yam  to  a  very  high  tension  which  can. lead  to the  destruction  of  the  package.     The  problem  is especially  serious  in  the  winding  of  both  nylon  6  and nylon  6.6  (polyamide)  yams,   and  polypropylene  yarns. It  is  therefore  necessary  to  subject  the  yarn  to  a shrinkage  treatment  before  winding,   so  as  to  remove  its tendency  to  shrink.    However,  this  additional  procedure is  undesirable  for  textile  technological  reasons, including  the  fact  that  the  tendency  of  the  yarn  to shrink  from  heat  is  useful  in  many  subsequent processing  operations.<br>
It  is  an  object  of  the  present  invention  to provide  a  method  and  apparatus  for  spinning  a  synthetic multi-filament  yam  which  includes  a  shrinkage treatment  which removes  the  tendency  of the yarn  to  shrink  in  the  package,  yet  does  not  significantly effect  the  tendency  to  shrinkage  which  is caused  in particular  by  a  heat  treatment  or  by  boiling,   and  which<br><br>
is  desirable  and  favorable  in  subsequent  processing operations.<br>
It  is  a  more  particular  object  of  the  present invention  to provide  a  method  and  apparatus  of  the described  type  which  includes  a  treatment  which  reduces the  so-called  package  shrinkage,   i.e.,  the  tendency  to cold  shrinkage,  to  a    harmless  degree,  without significantly  effecting  the  hot  shrinkage  tendency which  is  useful  in  many  subsequent  processing operations.<br>
Summary  of  the  Invention<br>
The  above  and  other  objects  and  advantages  of the  present  invention  are  achieved  by  the  provision  of a  method  and  apparatus  which  includes  the  steps  of extruding  a  polymeric  melt  to  form  a  plurality  of advancing  filaments,  and  gathering  the  filaments  to form  an  advancing  yarn.    The  advancing  yarn  is  then subjected  to  a  drawing  operation,  and  thereafter  the advancing  yam  is  heated  by  guiding  the  advancing  yarn  . along  a  path  of  travel  which  is  adjacent  but  at  least essentially  spaced  from  an  elongate  heating  surface. The  heating  surface  is  heated  to  a  temperature  which  is above  the  melting  temperature  of  the  yarn,  and  during such  heating  the  advancing  yarn  is  subjected  to  a tension  which  is  insufficient  to  cause  a  plastic deformation  of  the  yarn.     Finally,  the  advancing  yarn is  wound  into  a  package.<br>
Preferably,  the  temperature  of  the  heating surface  is  more  than  about  100'C  above  the  melting temperature  of  the  yarn,   and  most  preferably,   the temperature  is  between  about  200  and  300C:  above  the melting  temperature  of  the  yarn.<br>
During  the  heating  step,  the  yarn  is subjected to tension which  is  not greter  than  about 0.3  cN/dtex  during  the  heating  step,  and  preferably.<br><br>
the  tension  is  between  about  0. 1  and  0.2  cN/'dtex  during the  heating  step.<br>
The  resulting  yarn  has  a  hot  shrinkage tendency  which  is  greater  than  about  3%,  and  the tendency  is  preferably  more  than  20%,  and most preferably  it  is  between  about  30%  and  about  40%.<br>
An  advantage  of  the  present  invention  is  that the  textile  technological  properties  of  the  yarn  are not  adversely  affected  by  the  shrinkage exeatment  of the  invention.    In  particular,  after  unwinding,  the yam  may  still  exhibit  a  high  hot  shrinkage  tendency, which  is  expressed,   for  example,  as  boiling  shrinkage. Also,   the  feed  rolls  or  feed  systems,  which  advance  the yarn  into  the  shrinkage  treatment  zone  or  withdraw  it therefrom,  need  not  be  heated.    This  is  not  only  a substantial  simplification  of  mechanical  engineering, but  also  permits  a  more  favorable  control  of  the process.     During  the  treatment,  the  yarn  is  subjected only  to  a  yarn  tension which  is  lower  than  the  tension required  for  drawing  the  already  oriented yarn.     In  the case  of  polyamide,  polyester  or polytrimethylene terephthalate  yams,  the  temperature  of  the  heating surface  is  preferably  higher  than  350C,   in  the  case  of polypropylene  yarns  the  surface  teniperature  is preferably  higher  than  200C.<br>
The  present  invention  permits  that  yarn  to advance  in  the  spin  zone  and/or  shrinkage  zone  and/or takeup  zone  under  very  little  tension,  without incurring  the  risk  of  an  unsteady  threadline  or  the formation  of  laps  on  the  godet  or  another  disturbance of  the  process.<br>
In  the  preferred  embodiment,   the  yarn  is guided  along  the  heating  surface  by  one  or  more  short guides  which  are  distributed  along  the  surface.    This<br>
serves the purpose of guiding  the  yarn  at a  precisely<br>
defined  distance  from  the  heated  surface.     A  distance<br>
from  0.5  to  3.5  mm  is  desirable.	<br><br>
AS  noted  above,   it  is  possible  to  advance  the yam  in  the  shrinkage treatment  zone  under  very  little tension.    This  permits  the process  to be  simplified,  in that  the  yarn  tension  is  adjusted  such  that it is simultaneously  suitable  for winding.<br>
In  one  embodiment,  the  heat,  treatment  occurs between  two  yam  feeding  godets.    This  provides  an advantage  in  that  it  is  possible  to  edjunt  the  yam tension  very  uniformly  and,  thus,  the  shrinkage  in  a very  controlled manner.<br>
In  the  short  spinning process,  the yams being  produced  are  very  susceptible  to  shi-inkage,  and they  present  great  problems  during  the  takeup.    In  this instance,   it will  be  advantageous  Co  utilize  an embodiment  of  the  invention wherein  the  yarn  is advanced  directly  from  the  spin  box  to  the  take-up winder  without  the  use  of  yam  feeding  godets,   and  at  a withdrawal  speed which  is  greater than  5000  m/min,  and preferably  between  6000  and  7500  m/min.<br>
The  method  of  the  present  invention  is suitable  for  all  polymers  in  use.     It  allows  to  produce a  high-quality  package  of  polyester  yarn  yh;.ch  has still  a  hot  or  boiling  shrinkage  ol!  rrore  them  20%  after unwinding.<br>
Especially  important  is  the  shrinkage-free treatment  for polyamides.    The  currtently conducted shrinkage-free  treatments,   in  particular  with  vapor, result  in  an  overall  reduction  of  the  snrinkage tendency-      While  the  method  of  the  present  invention permits  removal  only  of  the  shrinkage  in  the  package, the  shrinkage  tendency  remains  unslrif.ngei  when  heat  is supplied,   or  it  remains  adjustablt by  other  parameters of  the  process  control.<br>
This  applies  in  like  manner  to  polypropylene yams,  which  present  in  the  conventional process significant-problems daring  winding.<br><br>
An  especially  advantageous  method  of drawing  in  accordance  with  one  embodiment of.  the present  invention  includes  withdrawing  the  yarn  from the  spinneret  by  means  of  a  godet  at  a  high  speed  of more  than  3,500  m/min.  and  advancing  same  through  a narrow heating  tube,     in  the  heating  tube,   the  yam undergoes  drawing  as  a  result  of  tension  and  heating. Until  now,  this  method  has  been  impractical  for materials  with  a  strong  shrinkage  tendency,   in particular  nylon  and  polypropylene,  since  by  this  kind of  drawing  the  yams  are  imparted  a high  tendency  to shrinkage  in  the  package.    However,  the  combination with  the  method  of  the  present  invention  allows  this draw  method  to  be  applied  to  all  types  of  materials.<br>
Prior  to  the  heat  treatment,  the  yarn  may  be subjected  to  a  drawing  operation  wherein  the  yarn  is guided  closely  adjacent,  but  at  least  essentially spaced  from  an  elongate  heater which  is  neated  to  a temperature  higher  than  the melt point  of  the yarn, preferably  from  100'  to  300C  above  the  melt  point,  and the  yam  is  tensioned  to  an  extent  leading  to  a  plastic deformation  of  the  yarn.     Despite  the  low yjarn  tension in  the  draw  zone,  the  yam  forms  a  precisely  localized yield  point  and  can  be  totally  drawn.    For  the formation  of  a  precisely  established  yield  point,   the method  may be  further  improved by  grinding  the advancing  yarn  over  guides,  while  partially  looping  the same,   before  entering  into  the  draw  zone.<br>
A  further,  advantageous  variant  of  the  method for  the  spinning  includes  withdrawing  the  yarn  from  the spinneret  at  a  speed  of  more  than  500  m/min,  and  so  as to  result  in  the  simultaneous  drawing  of  the  yarn,  as is  known  from  EP  0  539  866  A2.<br>
The  apparatus  of  the  present  invention distinguishes  itself  in  that  despite  the  very  high  yarn speeds,   the  heating  surface  is  very  short, in; particular,   in  a  range  from  300  to  1000  mm.<br><br>
The  heater  of  the  present  invention  may  take the  form  of  a  generally  U-shaped  body  or  rail,  which defines  a  longitudinal  heating  surface  in a  groove thereof  and  with  the  yarn  being  guided  to  have essentially  no  contact with  the heating  surface.    This construction permits  a  simple  operation  and,   in particular,  a  simple  selection  of  the  distance  at  which the  yam  advances  from  the  heated  surface.     In  this embodiment,  this  distance  may  be  predetermined  by  yarn guides  as  a  function  of  the  yam  material,   the  denier, the  number  of  filaments,  the  yarn  speed,   and  the adjusted  temperature  of  the  heating  surface.<br>
The  body  or  rail  of  the  heater  may  comprise two  separate  body  segments  which  are  positioned  in  an end  to  end  relationship,   and  which  have  separate temperature  controls.    Besides  a  smooth  advance  of  the yarn,   this  embodiment  allows  in particular  a  stepped temperature  control  that  is  adapted  to  the  process. For  example,  a  first  step  is  controlled  in  a temperature  range  from  450  to  550C,   and  the  second step  in  a  temperature  range  from  400  to  500C.<br>
The  invention  applies  to  all  polyamides, polyester,  as  well  as  polytrimethylene  terephthalate (PTT).     In  the  case  of  polypropylene,  the  temperatures are  correspondingly  lower,  preferably  by  100C  to 200'C.<br>
A  combination  of  the  invention  which  is especially  favorable  in  terms  of  process  er.ginefering, utilizes  in  the  draw  zone  a  narrow  tube  surrounding  the threadline,   into  which  the  yarn  advancing  from  the spinneret  enters  without  passing  over  a  godet.     This simple  solution  of  mechanical  engineering  becomes possible  for  all  materials  only  as  a  result  of  this invention.     Where  the  yam  is  withdrawn  from  the spinning zone by means of  an  unheated  godet or  the like,   and  advanced  to  the  draw zone,  the   invention requires  no  special  measures  to  reduce  the  shrinkage<br><br>
tendency of the yarn already in the draw zone. Thus, additional possibilities of adjustment are obtained, so as to modify the other yam properties, in particular, tensile strength and elongation. It is possible to spin in particular highly oriented or fully oriented yams in a continuous process.<br>
Important advantages result from the shrinkage treatment. The invention allows the so-called "package shrinkage", i.e. the tendency to cold shrinkage, to be reduced to a harmless degree, or to be eliminated, without thereby adversely effecting the hot shrinkage tendency, i.e., boiling shrinkage or hot air shrinkage. From the viewpoint of textile or technology, it is not desirable to adjust the hot shrinkage tendency to the requirements of winding, but to the requirements of subsequent processing operations. Thus, for example, a certain shrinkage tendency is desired in a sewing yam, so that the seam can adjust itself to the shrinkage of the fabric. When employing the yam for hosiery, the leg shape is obtained, in that the untreated hose is pulled over a flat board and adjusts itself to same by heat treatment and shrinkage. In other fabrics, such as corduroy, shrinkage causes the density to increase. In all these cases, the requirement for shrinkage-free winding in accordance with the invention has no disturbing influence on the tendency to heat shrinkage that is to be achieved.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a method of spinning a synthetic multi-filament yam comprising the steps of extmding a polymeric melt to form a plurality of advancing filaments, and gathering the filaments to form an advancing yam, drawing the advancing yam, and thereafter<br><br>
heating the advancing yam by guiding the advancing yam along a path of travel which is adjacent but at least essentially spaced from an elongate heating surface, with the heating surface being heated to a temperature which is above the melting temperature of the yam, and while subjecting the advancing yam to a tension which is insufficient to cause a plastic deformation of the yam, and then winding the advancing yam into a package.<br>
Accordingly the present invention also provides an apparatus for spinning a synthetic multi-filament yam as herein-above described, said apparatus comprising means for extruding a polymeric melt to fomi a plurality of advancing filaments, and gathering the filaments to form an advancing multi-filament yam, means for drawing the advancing yam and so as to define a drawing zone, means defining a draw-free zone downstream of said drawing zone and wherein the advancing yam is subjected to a tension insufficient for drawing of the yam, a heater positioned within the draw-free zone and comprising an elongate heating surface, and means for heating the heating surface to a temperature which is above the melting temperature of the yarn, and a winder positioned downstream of said heater for winding the advancing yam into a package.<br>

Detailed  Description  of  the  Preferred  Embodiments Referring  more  particularly  to  the  drawings. Figure  1  illustrates  a  melt  spinning  apparatus  wherein a  yarn  1  is  spun  from  a  thermoplastic  material.     The thermoplastic  material  is  supplied  through  a  hopper  2 to  an  extruder  3,    The  extruder  3  is  driwen  by  a  motor 4,  which  is  controlled  by  a  control  unit  49.     in  the extruder  3,  the  thermoplastic  material  is  melted.     The work  of  deformation  (shearing  energy),  which is  applied by  the  extruder  3  to  the  material,  assists  in  the melting  process.     In  addition,  a  heater,   for  example  in the  form  of  a  resistance  heater  5,   is  provided,  which is  controlled  by  a  heating  control  unit  SO.     Through  a melt  line 6,  which  includes  a  pressure  sensor  7  for measuring  the  melt  pressure  so  as  to  control  the pressure  and  speed  of  extruder  3,  the  melt  reaches  a gear  pump  9,  which  is  driven  by  a  pump  motor  44.'    The pump  motor  44  is  controlled  by  a  control  unit  45,   so  as to  permit  a  very  fine  adjustment  of  the pump  speed. The  pump  9  transports  the  melt  to  a  heated  spin  box  10, the  underside  of  which  mounts  a  spinneret   lA.     From  the, spinneret  ll,  the  melt  emerges  in  the  form  of  fine<br><br>
strands  of  filaments  12.     The  filament  strands  advance through  a  cooling  shaft  15.    In  the  cooling  shaft  15, an  air  current  is  directed  crosswise  or  radially  to  the web  of  filaments  12,  thereby  cooling  the  filaments.<br>
At  the  outlet  end  of  cooling  shaft  15,  the web  of  filaments  is  combined  to  form  the  yarn  1.     The yarn  is  withdrawn  from  the  cooling  shaft  15 and  from spinneret  11  by  a  godet  54.     The  yarn  loops  several times  about  godet  54.     To  this  end  a  guide  roll  55  is used,  which  is  axially  inclined  relative  to  the  godet 54.    The  guide  roll  55  is  freely  rotatable.    The  godet 54  is  driven  by  a  motor  at  a  preadjustable  speed.     This withdrawal  speed  is  by  a  multiple  higher  than  the natural  exit  speed  of  the  filaments  12  from  the spinneret,  thereby  subjecting  the  yarn  to  a  very  high tension,   which  leads  to  its  drawing.    The  drawing  is assisted  by  a  heating  tube  20  which  defines  a  draw heating  zone  31.    The  heating  tube  20  measures,   for example,   1.150  m  long.     It  is  heated  to  a  temperature, which  is  for  polyester  and  PTT  from  140'  to  180'C,   for polypropylene  from  100  to  150C,  and  for  polyamide from  140'  to  220'C.    The  yield  point  of  the  yam  is located  in  an  inlet  region  of  this  heating  tube.     The temperature  control  in  the  further  extension  of  the heating  tube  permits  the  properties  of  the  yarn,   such as  its  strength,  boiling  shrinkage,  and  elongation,   to be  adjusted.     Such  a  heating  tube  is  described,   for example,   in  DE  38  08  854,   which  corresponds  to  U.S. Patent  No.   4,902,461,  and  also  in  DE  37  20  337.<br>
The  godet  54  is  followed  by  a  second  godet  16 with  a  guide  roll  17,   before  the  yarn  1  is  wound  in  a takeup  30  to  a  package  33.<br>
Arranged  between  godets  54  and  16  is  a  heater a  in  accordance  with  the  invention.     The  heater  8  is  an elongate body or rail a long which  the  yarn  advances slightly  spaced  apart  therefrom.    This  elongate  heater is  divided  into  several  segments,   namely  a  first<br><br>
heating  zone  27  and  a  second  heating  zone  38  as illustrated,  which  may  be  heated  independently  of  each other,   as  is  described  in  more  detail  below.<br>
From  godet  16  of  Figure 1  or   Figure  3, the  yam  1  advances  to  a  so-called  "apex  yarn  guide"  25 and  thence  to  a  traversing  triangle  26.    Not  shown  in Figure  1  is  the  traversing mechanism,  which  comprises two  oppositely  rotating  blades  that  reciprocate  the. yam  1  over  the  length  of  package  33.     In  so  doing,  the yam  loops  about  a  contact  roll   (not  shown)   downstream of  the  yam  traversing  mechanism.    The  contact  roll lies  against  the  surface  of  package  33.     It  serves  to measure  the  surface  speed  of  package  33,  which  is formed  on  a  tube  35.    The  tube  35  Is  clamped  on  a winding  spindle  34.    The  winding  spindle  34  is  driven by  a  motor  and  a  control  unit  such  that  the  surface speed  of  package  33  remains  constant.    To  this  end  and for  use  as  a  control  variable,  the  speed  of  the  freely rotatable  contact  roll  is  sensed.<br>
It  should  be  noted  that  the  yam traversing  mechanism  may  also  be  a  standard  cross-spiralled  roll  with  a  yam  guide  traversing  in  the cross-spiralled  groove.<br>
In  one  embodiment,  a  polypropylene  yam with  a  filament  denier  from  0.7  to  3  dtex  is  spun  and withdrawn  from  the  spinneret  11  by  godet  54  and  at  a speed  higher  than  3,500  and  4,500  m/min,,  the  yam being  subjected  to  a  sudden  heating  in  heater  8.     The godet  16  has  a  circumferential  speed,  which  is  not higher  than  that  of  godet  54.    Thus,  the  yarn  is  not drawn/  and  it  is  essentially  relaxed  as  it  passes through  the  heater,     in  this  embodiment,  the  heater  is operated  at  very  high  temperatures  above  the  melting point,   i.e.,   substantially  above  220'C.     The  first  zone 27  of  the  elongate  heater  is  heated  to  330'C  and  the second  zone 28 to 150C.This  allows as acequate relaxation  treatment  between  godets  16  and  54  to  be<br><br>
achieved,  which  continues  even  into  the  takeup  zone. Preferably,  the  temperatures  of  the  first  heating  zone 27  are  somewhat  higher  than  those  of  the  second  heating zone  28,  nanely  in  a  preferred  range  from  250*  to 550C.    The  temperature  of  the  second  heading  zone  29 is  preferably  from  150  to  450'C.    The  yarn  tension between  godets  54  and  16  can  be  adjusted  to  less  than 0.1  cN/dtex,  taking  into  account  the  speed  difference and  the  shrinkage  forces.     This  range  is  especially advantageous  for  activating  or  eliminating  the  tendency to  cold  shrinkage.    The  temperature  control,   in particular  in  the  second  heating  zone  28,  permits  the hot  shrinkage  tendency  to  also  be  influenced  in  a controlled  manner,  without  thereby  adversely  affecting the  cold  shrinkage  tendency  that  is  detrimental  to winding.<br>
A  further  godet  21  and  guide  zoll  22  may  be arranged  upstream  of  godet  54,  as  is  shown  in  Figure  3. In  this  instance,   a  subsequent  drawing  occurs  between these  godets  21  and  54.    To  this  end,   the  speed  of godet  54  is  adjusted  higher  than  the  speed  of  godet  21. A  tension  is  applied,   which  leads  to  a  further<br><br>
deformation  of  the  yarn  I.     Preferably, a  further  heat treatment  also  occurs  between  these  two  godets.    To this  end,  a  heater  24  is  shown  in  Figure  3.    The  heater has  a  heating  surface  29  that  faces  the  yarn  1.     The yarn  1  advances  therealong  without  contacting,   but closely  adjacent  this  heated  surface  29,   at:  a  distance from  0.5  to  5  mm.     The  surface  temperature  is  adjusted higher  than  the  melting  point  of  the  particular polymer.     This  subsequent  drawing  and  the  sudden heating  provided  therein  allow  to  achieve  an influencing  of  the  crystal  structure  in  the  meaning  of a  greater  long-term  stability  of  the  yam.       As  a result,   the  effectiveness  of  the  subsequent  treatment<br><br>
between  godets  54  and  16  is  amplified,  and  the  pacJcage shrinkage  and  the  tendency  to  shrink  on  the  package  are further  reduced.<br>
It  should  be  noted  that  otherwise  the  method shown  in  Figure  3  corresponds  to  that  described  above with  respect  to  Figure  1.     When  the  methods  of  Figures 1  and  3  are  employed,  it  is  possible  to  wind subsequently  both  soft  and  especially  shrinkage-sensitive,  hard  packages,  which will  not  exhibit  a detrimental  package  shrinkage  with  damage  or destruction  of  the  package,  even  in  their  long-term behavior.    Both  methods  are  carried  out  in  that  the yam  is  withdrawn  from  the  spinneret  H  at  a  very  high speed  of  more  than  3,500  m/min  by  means  of  godet  54  in the  instance  of  Figure  1,   and  by  means  of  godet  21  in the  instance  of  Figure  3.     In  the  case  of  Figure  3,  the subsequent  drawing  may  amount  to  another  10  to  30%.<br>
The  modification  of  the  crystalline  structure and  the  increase  of  the  length  stability,   as  provided by  the  process  of  Figure  3,  may  also  be  produced  in  a method  as  shown  in  Figure  l,   in  that  the  heating  tube 20  in  the  draw  heating  zone  31  is  replaced,   as  shown  in Figure  4,  with  an  elongate  surface,  along  which  the yam  advances  without  substantially  contacting  same, the  surface  temperature,   as  described  with  reference  to Figure  3,  being  above  the  melt  point  of  the  polymer. Unlike  in  the  case  of  heating  tube  20,   the  necessary draw  force  is  not  applied  by  air  friction,   but  by  the friction  of  the yam  on yam  guides  132.     shown  in Figure  4  is  as  a  further modification  that  upon  its entry  into  the  draw  zone,  the  yarn  partially  loops about  several   (shown  are  two)   successively  arranged yam  guides  132,   so  that  the  yield  point  of  the  yarn becomes  localized  as  a  result  of  its  heading.<br>
As anlternative  to  the  method  shown  in Figure  1,  a  variant  of  the  method  is  shown in  Figure  4, which  comprises  a  heat  treatment  between  godet  16  and<br><br>
takeup  winder  30.    The  fact  that  in  the  shrinkage treatment  zone  the  yam  may be  advanced  under very little  tension  permits  an  adjustment  that  makes  the yam  tension  simultaneously  suitable  as  takeup  tension. Since  otherwise  the  sequence  of  the  method  shown  in Figure  corresponds  to  that  of  Figures  1-3,   the description  thereof  is  herewith  incorporated  by reference.<br>
In  the  variant  of  the  method  as  shown  in Figure  5,  the  yam  1  is  withdrawn  from  the  spinneret  11 not  by  godets,  but  directly by means  of  takeup  winder 30.    In  this  instance,  the  withdrawal  speed  is  above 5,000  m/min.,  preferably  from  6,000  to  7,500  m/min.    In this  process,  the  yam  1  is  drawn  simultaneously  with the  spinning.    More particularly,  the  draying  occurs immediately  downstream  of  the  spinneret  11  and  while the  hot  filaments  and  yarn  are  being  cocled.     The drawing  ceases  at  a  point  wherein the  tension  supplied by  the  winder  30  is  too  low  to  deform  the  cooled  yam, and  the  heater  8  is  positioned  downstream  of  the  point where  drawing  ceases,  and  upstream  of  the  takeup  winder 30.     Thus  during  the  heating  operation  in  the  heater  8, the  yarn  is  subjected  to  substantially  the  same  tension under  which  the  yarn  is  withdrawn  from the  spinneret. This  process  is  particularly  suitable  for  producing without  difficulty  yarns  which  are  highly  susceptible to  shrinkage  as  a  result  of  the  spin  and  draw  method. As  regards  the  components  of  the  apparatus  not described  in  this  connection,  refensnce  may  be  made  to the  description  of  Figures  1  and  3.<br>
Shown  in  Figure  6  is  a  modification  of  the method,  which  does  not  differ  with  respect  to  the shrinkage  heat  treatment  from  the  method  of Figure  4 that  is  herewith  incorporated  by  reference.     Once  the bundle of filaments 12 is  combine to yarn 1  by  yarn<br>
guide  56,  the  yam  1  advances  to  godet  21.    The  godet 21 being  looped  by  yarn  1  several  times  withdraws<br><br>
yam  i  from  spinneret  H  and  advances  the  yarn  into  a draw  zone.     In  the  draw  zone,   a  heater  24  is  arranged between  godet  21  and  godet  54,     While  undergoing  a drawing,  the  yarn  1  advances  over  the  heating  surface 29  closely  adjacent  thereto  but  without  substantially contacting  sane.     The  heating  surface  29  is  heated  to  a temperature  higher  than  the  melt  point  bf  yarn  l.    The tension  required  for  the  drawing  is  adjusted  between godets  21  and  54.<br>
It  should  be  remarked  that  in  all  cases,   the godets  with  guide  rolls  may  be  replaced  with  two  or more  successively  arranged,  driven  rolls,  which  are looped  by the  yam  in  part  in  s-direction  and/or  Z-direction,   i.e.  successively  in  opposite  direction.<br>
This  method  has  proven  that,   in particular, the  sudden  heat  treatment  at  a  high  temperature  results simultaneously  in  a  recovery  of  the  molecular  structure of  the  highly  partially  oriented  polyprcpylene  yarn,   so that  the  residual  shrinkage  of  the  yarn  is  reduced very substantially.     In  normal  processes,  the  shrinkage free treatment,   i.e.  the  elimination  of  the  shrinkage tendency,  acts  to  reduce  simultaneously  both  the tendency  to  cold  shrinkage  and  the  tendency  to  heat shrinkage.    This  applies  in  particular  to  the  vapor treatment methods  of  the  prior  art.    The  invention, i.e.   a  relaxation  zone  with  a  sudden  heating  of  the yarn,  permits  the  tendency  to  cold  shrinkage  to  be selectively  eliminated  and,  preferably,   it  permits  the tendency  to  heat  shrinkage  to  be  influenced  in  a controlled manner.<br>
It  should  be  pointed  out  that,  contrary  to conventional  methods,   in  which  all  godets  for withdrawing,  drawing,  and  relaxing  the  polypropylene yarn  are  heated,  the  godet  54  is  unheated,   and  that  it is  likewise not necessary  to  heat  godet  16.<br><br>
It  should  be  added,  however,  that  one  of  the two  godets  S4  or  16  may  also  be  heated,   for example,  to about  100'C,   so  as  to  reduce  likewise  the  tendency  to heat  shrinkage  in  a  controlled manner.<br>
The  method  of  the  present  invention  can  be successfully  applied  to  standard  polymers,   such  as polyethylene  terephthalate,  polytrimethylene terephthalate,  polypropylene,   and  polyamide (preferably,  PA  6  and  PA 6.6,  but  also  PA  blends  of different  types  of  PA).    Very  good  results  are  obtained with  polypropylene  with  a  narrow  molecular  weight distribution  in  a  range  smaller  than  3,   i;i  particular with  types  produced  on  the  basis  of  metallccene, inasmuch  as  these  yams  permit  the  spin-draw  process, i.e.  spinning  and  drawing  in  one  operation  and  in  the same  zone,  as  is  shown  for  example  in  Figure  l,  to  be used with  a  heating  tube.<br>
It  should  be  emphasized  that  a  favorable effect  can  also  be  achieved  by  subjecting, the  yarn  to an  additional  vapor  treatment.       To  this  end  a  hot vapor  nozzle  23  is  provided  directly  at  the  inlet  end of  the  heater 8,  which  blows  hot  vapor  to  the  yam. This  hot  vapor  condenses  immediately  on  the  not-yet heated  yarn  and  evaporates  thereafter.     Duz'ing  the condensation,  the  yam  receives  the  corresponding amount  of  heat.    On  the  other hand,   the  subsequent evaporation  prevents  a  very  sudden  heating  of  the  yam.-This  protective  treatment  of  the  yarn  could  be advantageous,   and  will  lead  in  any  event,  to  a  rapid reduction  of  the  heat  shrinkage.    The  Le-tter  can  be adjusted  by  this  treatment.     Likewise,   t.he  following sudden  heat  treatment  at  a  high  temperature  results  in a  reduction  of  the  cold  shrinkage.     However,   the favorable  effects  of  the  present  invention  do  not appear  to require the  use  of  the  hot  vappor nozzle.<br><br>
The  heating  apparatus 9,  as  shown  in  Figures 2a-2c,  consists  of  an  elongate  body  or  rail  114   (Figure 2c)  that  is  provided with  two  longitudinal  grooves  112 and  is  composed  of  a  material  which  is  heat  resistant and  nonscaling,   and  which  withstands  temperatures  in  a range  above  450'C  over  long  peripds  of  time  without undergoing  noteworthy  changes.    The  body  114  is generally  U-shaped  in  cross  sectional  configuration  and includes  a  substantially  flat  base  portion  116  which constitutes  the heating  surface  117.    Connected  with the  base  portion  are  three  walls  118,   120,   122,  between which  the  longitudinal  grooves  112  are  locared. However,   it  is  also  possible  to  provide  base  portion 116  with  two  or more  than  three  upwardly  directed walls,  between  which  correspondingly  more  or  less grooves  extend.     The  outer  walls  118  and  122  may,   for example,  be  bolted  to  base  portion  116.    Arranged between  the walls  118  and  122  and the  base  pprtion  116 is  one  heating  element  124,   126  each,  preferably  in  the form  of  a  rod-shaped,  electrical  resistor,   which extends  over  the  entire  length  of  body  114,   or  which may  also  be  divided  over  the  length  into  several segments,   so  as  to  enable  controlled  heating  profiles. The  heating  elements  124,   126  are  provided  with  plug contacts   (not  shown)   for  their  connection  to  a  source of  current.<br>
Center  wall  120  which  is  located  between<br>
i<br>
outer  walls  118  and  122  and  extends  vertically  from base  portion  116,  either  is  integral  therewith,   or  it is  connected  with  bottom  116  in  like  manaer  as  outer walls  118  and  122.<br>
As  an  alternative,  the  body  114  may  have  a cross  section  similar  to  an  extruded  profile,   in which the  base  portion  116  and  walls  118,   120,   122;  are  made of  one  piece,,  and  which  is  provided  in known  manner with  recesses,  bores,  bendable  flaps,  or  the'like  for receiving  the  heating  elements.<br><br>
Inserted  in  walls  ll8,   120,   122 at  regular intervals  A  from  one  another  are  recesses or  bores  128 having  substantially  the  sane  depth,  the  recesses  128 arranged  in  center  wall  120  being  offset  by  the  spacing A  from  the  recesses  128  in  side  walls  118 and  122.    The recesses  have  a  circular-cylindrical  shape.    Each recess  128  is  intersected  by  longitudinal grooves  112 along  a  secant  line,  so  that  walls  118,   120,   122 exhibit  a  slot  133,   i.e.  a  rectangular  oppring,   facing the  axial  grooves  112.     in  the  illustrated  embodiment, the  recesses  extend  perpendicularly  to  the  groove bottom,  and  their  depth  corresponds  to  the  height  of walls  118,  120,   122,  in  which  they  are  accommodated. Under  certain  circvimstances,   it  may  be  advantageous  to incline  the  recesses.<br>
Each  recess  128  accommodates a  yarn  guide<br>
132,	the  cross  sectional  shape  of  which  corresponds  to the  cross  section  of  the  recess  both  in  size  and  shape, and  which,  for  purposes  of  maintaining  close tolerances,  rests  firmly,  but  with  a  play,   against  the wall  of  the  recess.    The  clearance  between  the  wall  of the  recesses  and  the  peripheral  surface  of  the  yam guides,   as  shown  in  the  drawing,   is  exaggerated  only for  reasons  of  clarity.     In  the  region of  each  slot<br>
133,	a  portion  of  each  yarn  guide  132  extends  into  the axial  grooves  112  such  that,   on  opposite sides  of grooves  112,   successively  arranged  yarn  guides  132 extend  by  a  certain  dimension,   for  example  0.1  to  1  mm, beyond  a  central  plane  extending  parallal  to  walls  118,; 120,   122.     Otherwise,   the  width  of  the  slots  133  is smaller  than  the  largest  cross  sectional dimension, i.e.,   than  the  diameter  of  yarn  guides   132,   so  that they  are  unable  to  slide  out  of  recesses  128.<br>
In  the  illustrated  embodiment,  both  recesses<br>
128  and yarn guides 132	a  circular-cylindrical<br>
cross  section.    Other  angular  as  well  as rounded shapes,   such  as  ellipses,   diamonds,   triangles,   etc.   are<br><br>
possible.     The  embodiment  has  a  fit  between  recesses 128  and  yarn  guides  132,  which  is  kept  witthin accordingly  close  tolerances.    As  a  result,   separate fastening  means  to  secure  yam  guides  132  against  axial and  radial  displacements  are  not  needed,  thereby eliminating  special  expcmses,  which  would  otherwise result  from  the  use  of  fastening  means.    The  embodiment of  Figure  2c  may  also  have  clearance  or  transition fits.     On  the  one  hand,  these  fits  are  narrow  enough, so  that  the  yam  guides  rest  immovably  in  their recesses.    On  the  other  hand,  however,  the  fits  are also  selected wide  enough,   so  as  to  make  it  easy  to pull  out  the  yam  guides  from  their  recesses  and replace  or  omit  same.<br>
For  purposes  of  securing  the  yarn  guides  in the  axial  direction,  sheet  metal  caps  152  ere  used.    To this  end,   side  walls  118,   120,   122  are  provided  on their  upper  edge  with  retaining  grooves  154  or  a  head 156,  which  is  wider  than  the  respective  wall.     In  cross sectional  view,  the  sheet  metal  caps  152  have  a  cup-shaped  profile,  so  that  in  the  case  of  center  wall  120 they  extend  into  retaining  grooves  154,  or  that  in  the case  of  side  walls  118,   122  they  embrace  wall  head  156. otherwise,  the  sheet metal  caps  are  constructed  as elongate  profiles,  the  length  of  which  corresponds  to that  of  the  yam  heater.     The  thickness  of  wall  heads 156  and  the  position  of  retaining  grooves 154, respectively,   as  well  as  the  corresponding  dimensioning of  the  sheet  metal  caps  are  such  that  the  sheet  metal caps  secure  the  yarn  guides  in  the  axial,  direction.<br>
The  yam  guides  132  consist  of  materials commonly  used  for  this  purpose,   such  as  silicon, titanium,   or  aluminum  oxides,   or  of  nit::ided  or chromium  plated  steel,   or  the  like.<br>
Preferably in  the region in  which  they<br>
project  from  recess  slot  133,   the  yarn  guides  132  are conically  beveled  on  their  ends  facing  away  from  the<br><br>
base  portion  116,  as  is  indicated  at  134.    As  a  result, the  yarn  guides  132  successively  arranged  in  opposite walls  lle  and  120,  or  122  and  120  form  in  the  cross sectional  direction  of  the  heating  apparatus  8 respectively  a  V-shaped  groove  136,  which  permits  to guide  a  yam  138  in  its  stretched condition  between yarn  guides  132,  without  any  special  auxiliary  measures or  arrangements  between  successive  yarn  guides  132,   in a  movement  substantially  perpendicular  with  respect  to heating  surface  112  and  base  portion  116.     There,  the yam  138  resting  against  the  contact  surfaces  forms then  a  zigzagged  yarn  path.<br>
Arranged  at  the  ends  or  at  several  other points  (see  Figures  2a  and  2c)  of  the  body  114,  and substantially  equally  spaced  apart,  are  spacers  140, which  bridge  the  groove  112.     These  yam  guide  elements have  an  upward  directed  yam  guide  surface,   which serves  to  maintain  a  spacing  between  the  yarn  and  the groove  bottom.     These  rod-shaped  spacers  140  are anchored  in  transverse  bores  provided  in  the  walls  116, 120,   122.<br>
As  shown  in  Figure  2a,   the  heater  8  may<br>
consist  of  two  body  segments  114a  and  114b   one<br>
following  the  other  in  direction  of  the  advancing  yam.<br>
While  these  segments  differ  in  length,   they  otherwise<br>
have  the  same  cross  sectional  shape.     The  purpose  of<br>
such  a  bipartite  arrangement  may  lie  in  the  different<br>
heating  of  heater  8  over  different  length  segments,   so<br>
as  to  treat  yam  138  in  a  heat  profile  which  satisfies<br>
its  properties.     It  is  also  possible  to  use  more  than<br>
the  two  illustrated  segments.     In  this  arrangement,   it<br>
is  especially  important  that  the  angle  which  the  two<br>
yam  heating  segments  form  with  one  another,   is	<br>
identically  adjusted  at  each  processing  station  of  the spin-draw  machine,   so  as  to  produce  yarns  of  the  same quality  in  all processing  stations.    To  mount  the  two yarn  heating  segments  a  mounting  support:  188  is  used,<br><br>
which  has  the  length  of  the  two  heater  segments.    The mounting  support has  a U-shaped  cross  section.    The yani  heating  segments  are  attached  to  the  bottom  of  the mounting  support  by  means  of  spacers  100.     The dimensioning  of  the  spacers  and  their  position  relative to  the  heating  segment  allow  to  define  the  inclination of  the  heating  segment  with  respect  to  the  straight mounting  support  158.    In  this  arrangement,  the  two heating  segments  are  inclined  oppositely,  and  form with each  other  an  obtuse  angle.    Thus,  mounting support  158 is  used  on  the  one  hand  for  a  specific  fastening  of  the two  heating  segments,     since  mounting  support  158  has  a U-shaped  profile,   it  embraces,  however,   also  the  two heating  segments.     Therefore,   the  mo\inting  support  158 also  serves  to  make  the  temperature  constiant  over  the length  and  width  of  the  heating  segment».    The  mounting support  is  preferably  surrotinded  by  an  insulation.<br>
As  already  indicated,  rod-shaped  spacers 140  may  be  provided,  which  bridge  over  axial  groove  112 on  its  bottom,   i.e.,  they  extend  over  hieating  surface 117  and  define  the  yarn  path  at  a  specific  distance spaced  from  the  groove  bottom.    Alternatively  or additionally,   it  is  possible  to  provide  a  few  or  all yam  guides  132  with  a  peripheral  guide edge,   for example,  a  circumferential  groove  142   (Figure  2a),  the height  of  which  as  measured  from  the  groove  bottom,   is brought  in  line  with  the  height  of  the.  yarn  path  that is  predetermined  by  spacers  140.     In  this  manner,  the yarn  advancing  in  the  groove  is  guided  by  the  lateral edges  of  the  groove.     The  circumferential  grooves  have the  same  depth  over  the  circumference,   i.e.,   they  are made  concentric  with  yarn  guides  132.     However,   it  is also  possible  to  construct  the  circumferential  grooves with  a  depth  varying  over  the  circumference,   for example.in that the groove  bottom is cut  circular-cylindrically,  but  eccentrically  with  respect  to  yam guides  132.     In  this  instance,  a  turning  of  the  yarn<br><br>
guides creates the possibility of finely adjusting the contact between yarn 138 and yarn guides 132, and of forming a zigzagged yarn path. This could be realized by turning the yam guides 132 jointly and to the sane extent, for example, by means of a linkage (hot shown) that  interconnects  the  yarn  guides.<br>
The  heater  8  is  accommodated  in  an  insulated box  (not  shown),   in which  it  is  embedded  in  a  thermally insulated  material,   for  example,   fiber  glass.     The insulated  box may  be  provided with  a  flap,  which permits  to  open  it,   so  as  to  provide  access  to  heater 8,   and  to  thread  the  yam.     Puz±hermore,  the  insulated box  serves  with  its  components  extending  over  the heater  to  axially  secure  yarn  guides  132  in  the  body 114.     To  this  end,  the  insulated  box  is  provided  with slots,  which  are  aligned  with  the  central  plane  and the bevels  134  of  yarn  guides  132,  and  which  permit  a  yarn 138  to  be  treated  to  be  inserted  or  threaded  between the  yarn  guides  132.    On  their  side  walls,   the  slots are  provided with wear-resistant  insulating  plates.<br>
Likewise, if need be, the electrical contacts required for heating elements 124, 126 are accommodated in  the  insulated  box.<br>
As  can  be  noted  from  all  embodiinents,  the peripheral  surfaces,  on  which  the  yarn  contacts  the yarn  guides,  have  a  relatively  large  diameter.  , Contrary  thereto,  the  zigzag  line,  along  which  the  yarn advances  as  a  result  of  the  overlap  U of.  sixccessive yarn  guides,  has  a  relatively  small  amplitude  with  a relatively  large  spacing  A between  two  neighboring  yarn guides.    This  allows  the  looping  angle,   at  which  the yam  loops  about  the  yam  guides  or  the  contact surfaces  formed  on  same,   to  be  small  whan  summed.<br>
In  the  embodiment  of  Figure  2b,   the  heating  rail  is provided on its  side  facing  away  from  axial groove  112  with  two  grooves,  which  extend  substantially below  respective  ones  of  the  yam  guide  grooves  112.<br><br>
Inserted  into  these  grooves  are  the  heating  elements 124  and  12C.    The  heating  elements  are  clamped  in  place by  mounting  plate  159,  which  extends  over  the  entire length  of  the  yam  heater.     To  this  end,  the  mounting plate  is  likewise  provided  with  grooves,  which  surround heating  elements  124,   12C.     By  detaching  the  mounting plate  159,  the  heating  elements  124,  126  can  easily  be exchanged.<br>
The  distance  of  the  yarn  from  heating, surface 117  is  very  small.    The  distance  is  in a  range  from  0.5 to  5  mm.     Preferably,  the  upper  value  is  no  more  than 3.5  mm,   so  as  to  realize  a  satisfactory  transfer  of heat  and  an  exact,  trouble-free  temperature  control. For  reasons  of  practicability,  the  lower  limit  value  is 0.5  mm.     As  a  result,   at  a  correspondingly  high temperature  of  the  heating  rail  of  more  than  350'C,  the yam  undergoes  a  sudden  heating.    The  yarn  guides  132 may  also  be  left  out  at  least  in  part,   or  they  may  be removed,   should  they  have  a  negative  effect.     On  the one  hand,  they  contribute  to  smoothing  the  yam,   but they  barely  serve  to  heat  the  yarn  as  it  advances  in contact  therewith.    On  the  other  hand,  the  yarn  guides exert  only  little  friction  on  the  yarn,   because  of  its small  looping.     Importantly,  however,   is  the noncontacting  advance  of  the  yarn  closely  adjacent  to the  highly  heated  heating  surface.<br>
As  an  alternative  to  the  heater  i  as illustrated  in  Figures  2a-2c,  the  heater  for  reducing the  shrinkage  tendency  may  take  the  form  of  an externally  heated  tube,   through  which  the  yarn  advances without  significant  contact  between  the  advancing  yarn and  the  tube.     The  tube  will  provide  a  satisfactory uniform  control  of  the  heat  and  it  may  b«  slotted  to facilitate  thread-up  of  the  yarn.<br>
In  the  drawings  and  the  specification,   there has  been set forth preferred  embodiments of  the invention,  and,   although  specific  terms  are  employed,<br><br>
the  terms  are  used  in  a  generic  and  descriptive  sense only  and  not  for  the  purpose  of  limitation,  the  scope of  the  invention  being  set  forth  in  the  following claims.<br></td>
