				<td>GLYPHOSATE COMPOSITION<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No.<br>
60/552,556, filed March 12,2004.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the field of agrochemical compositions and<br>
formulations. In particular, the present invention provides a composition comprising<br>
glyphosate and at least one taurate salt, The glyphosate and at least one taurate salt<br>
of the present invention can be advantageously mixed with the triazolinone herbicide<br>
and one or more aromatic solvent to produce compositions that are chemically and<br>
physically stable. The present invention is also directed to methods of making and<br>
using such compositions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
To enable the efficient elimination or controlling of unwanted plants in<br>
agriculture and related endeavors, it is desirable to use effective chemical herbicides<br>
on these unwanted plants. Compositions containing multiple herbicides are<br>
desirable in agricultural and related endeavors due to broadening the spectrum or<br>
range of unwanted plant species killed or controlled and varying the onset of visual<br>
symptomology.<br>
, Due to the desirability of having a composition with the above mentioned<br>
properties, the combination of a triazolinone herbicide and glyphosate salt has been<br>
disclosed in, for example, U.S. Patent 5,935,905, U.S. Patent 5,125,958, U.S. Patent<br>
6,127,318, PCT Publication WO 00/78139, PCT Publication WO 02/063955 and<br>
PCT Publication WO 01/70024. The combination of a triazolinone herbicide and<br>
glyphosate salt has been thought to exhibit a herbicidal effect against a very broad<br>
spectrum of unwanted plant species and a triazolinone herbicide is known to have<br>
fast onset of herbicidal activity as seen from visual symptomology, while glyphosate<br>
salt is considered to be slower with onset occurring just after typical triazolinone<br>
herbicides. This has the potential to be a very effective combination. However, a<br>
problem in the art of formulating the triazolinone herbicide and glyphosate salt<br>
mixture is in successfully achieving both chemical and physical stability in the<br>
composition over significant periods of time.<br>
In general, a relatively small amount of the triazolinone herbicide has been<br>
used in conjunction with glyphosate. Chemical stability is most important in this<br>
type of composition to ensure the small amount of the triazolinone herbicide is fully<br>
effective. Typically, less than one percent is used commercially to keep the cost of<br>
the composition low, while still yielding spectrum and onset of visual<br>
symptomology benefits. Examples of problematic chemical degradation include<br>
hydrolysis, oxidation, dehalogenation and bond cleavage. The chemical and<br>
physical stability of a glyphosate and triazolinone herbicide composition is a key<br>
objective in the art.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides new herbicide compositions that have superior<br>
chemical and physical stability, broad herbicidal spectrum effects and very good<br>
balance of onset of visual symptomology.<br>
Specifically, the present invention is directed to a composition comprising<br>
glyphosate and at least one taurate salt. This composition can further comprise: (i) a<br>
water-immiscible phase comprising a triazolinone herbicide and one or more<br>
aromatic solvents with (ii) an aqueous phase comprising the glyphosate and an<br>
emulsifier comprising the at least one taurate salt. The triazolinone herbicide and<br>
glyphosate can be present, at least collectively, in a herbicidally effective amount.<br>
The present invention is also directed to methods of making and using the<br>
compositions of the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
As used in this specification and unless otherwise indicated the term<br>
"herbicide" refers to a molecule or combination of molecules that retards or<br>
otherwise kills unwanted plants, such as, but not limited to, deleterious or annoying<br>
weeds, broadleaf plants, grasses, sedges, and can be used for crop protection, edifice<br>
protection, or turf protection. The term "herbicidally effective amount" means an<br>
amount necessary to produce an observable herbicidal effect on unwanted plant<br>
growth, including the effects of plant necrosis, plant death, growth inhibition,<br>
reproduction inhibition, inhibition of proliferation, and removal, destruction, or<br>
otherwise diminishing the occurrence and activity of unwanted plants.<br>
"Glyphosate" in its strict sense is a well known acid compound defined<br>
conventionally as N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine, CAS Registry Number 1071-83-6,<br>
but the word "glyphosate" is used herein in a less restrictive sense, except where the<br>
context dictates otherwise, to encompass not only glyphosate acid but also salts (e.g.<br>
N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine salt), adducts, zwitterions and esters thereof, and<br>
compounds which are converted to glyphosate in plant tissues or which otherwise<br>
provide glyphosate ions. The term "carfentrazone" means a,2-dichloro-5-(4-<br>
(difluoromethyl)-4,5-dihydro-3-methyl-5-oxo-lH-l,2 ,4-triazol-l-yl)-4-<br>
fluorobenzenepropionic acid, CAS Registry Number 128621-72-7, or salts thereof.<br>
The term "carfentrazone ethyl" means ethyl a,2-dichloro-5-(4-(difluoromethyl)-4,5-<br>
dihydro-3-methyl-5-oxo-lH-l,2 ,4-triazol-l-yl)-4-fluorobenzenepropionate, CAS<br>
Registry Number 128639-02-1. The term "sulfentrazone" means N-(2,4-dichloro-5-<br>
(4-(difluoromethyl)-4,5-dihydro-3-methyl-5-oxo-1H-1,2,4- triazol-1 -<br>
yl)phenyl)methanesulfonamide, CAS Registry Number 122836-35-5.<br>
"Pre-emergent" is defined as application of the herbicide during the period<br>
prior to emergence of the crop plant from the ground. "Post-emergent" is defined as<br>
application of the herbicide during the period after emergence of the crop plant from<br>
the ground where the foliage of the crop plant is contacted by the herbicide. "Postdirect"<br>
is defined as application of the herbicide during the period after emergence<br>
of the crop plant from the ground where the foliage of the crop plant is not contacted<br>
by the herbicide and the herbicide application is directed to the base of the crop<br>
plant. "Pre-planting" is defined as application of the herbicide to kill existing<br>
unwanted plants prior to planting a crop plant. "Termination" is defined as<br>
application of a herbicide to kill the crop plant at an optimal harvest time and<br>
eliminate unwanted plants to assist in harvesting of the crop plant.<br>
The term "ambient temperature" as utilized herein shall generally mean any<br>
suitable temperature found in a laboratory or other working quarter, and is generally<br>
not below about 15° C nor above about 30° C.<br>

with a Lightning mixer at 1,200 revolutions per minute at ambient temperature. The<br>
carfentrazone-ethyl in solvent was then added slowly to the aqueous solution as it<br>
was agitated. Upon completion of the addition, the agitation was maintained for 5<br>
minutes at ambient temperature. The resultant emulsion particle size was 1.6<br>
microns and the batch was complete.<br>
Example 3<br>
This example illustrates one protocol for the preparation of a 600 grams/liter<br>
glyphosate salt composition of the present invention (Composition C).<br>
A mixture of 2.75grams of carfentrazone-ethyl and 10.0 grams of alkylated<br>
naphthalene depleted aromatic solvent (Aromatic 200 ND) was heated to about 70<br>
°C. In a separate vessel, 19.85 grams of water, 1.85 grams of sodium chloride and<br>
10.0 grams of sodium-N-methyl-N-oleoyl taurate (Geropon T77 available from<br>

Lightning mixer at 600 revolutions per minute at ambient temperature. Agitation<br>
was increased to 1,200 revolutions per minute, and the carfentrazone-ethyl in solvent<br>
was then added slowly to the aqueous solution as it was agitated. Upon completion<br>
of the addition, the agitation was maintained for 5 minutes at ambient temperature.<br>
Due to foaming, 0.05 grams of Dow Antifoam was added to the emulsion. The<br>
resultant emulsion particle size was 0.8 microns and the batch was complete.<br>

Stability Studies<br>
This example sets forth stability studies that were accomplished on<br>
compositions prepared in accordance with the present invention.<br>
Laboratory tests that show the stability of the emulsion compositions were<br>
carried out in the following manner. Prior to commencing the stability tests, an<br>
initial percentage of carfentrazone-ethyl present in Compositions A, B, C, G, H and I<br>
prepared above was determined by chromatographic techniques. After this<br>
determination, the compositions were stored at 50° C for a period of one month to<br>
model extreme conditions. After this time, the percentage of active ingredient<br>
present in the composition was determined by the same chromatographic technique.<br>
The results of these tests are presented in Table 1 below.<br>
The results, shown in Table 1, indicate that the compositions of the present invention<br>
maintained chemical stability at elevated temperature.<br>
While this invention has been described with an emphasis upon preferred<br>
