				<td>The present invention relates to a process for preparing methyl dithiocarbazinate.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for preparing methyl dithiocarbazinate.  More specifically, the present invention relates to an improved process for preparing methyl dithiocarbazinate by reacting carbon disulfide, hydrazine and an adjunct base. Brief Description of the Prior Art:<br>
Illustrative of the prior art of preparing methyl dithiocarbazinate are the following: Audrieth et al., J. Organic Chem., Vol. 19, pp. 733-741 (1954) discloses a process for preparing methyl dithiocarbazinate and converting it to fhiocarbohydrazide.  The process comprises a dropwise addition of 1.04 moles of carbon disulfide to 1.18 moles of potassium hydroxide and 1.1 moles of 85% hydrazine in 200 ml. of ethanol, in an ice bath. A heavy yellow oil containing potassium dithiocarbazinate separates during the addition. The resulting mixture is stirred, chilled and two volumes of ether are added to cause separation of more of the desired product (potassium dithiocarbazinate).<br>
The oily layer is separated from the ether-alcohol layer and filtered to remove a small amount of an unidentified solid which is formed. The clear yellow solution is then dissolved in 300 ml. of water. The resulting solution is cooled in an ice bath and 1.05 moles of methyl iodide is added in approximately 10 batches.  The reaction vessel is shaken and cooled alternately after each such addition until the methyl iodide is consumed. The reaction mixture is allowed to stand for several hours, and shaken occasionally to permit complete reaction. The methyl dithiocarbazinate is collected and recrystallized from ethanol.<br><br>
Methyl dithiocarbazinate (24.4 gm, 0.2 mole) was dissolved in 200 ml. of absolute ethanol and 18 ml. (0.3 mole of hydrazine) of 85% hydrazine hydrate was added. The resulting solution was refluxed until no more solid thiocarbohydrazide precipitated (about 45 minutes). To remove a small amount of formed S-hydrazino-4-amino-5-mercapto-1,2,4-triazole, the reaction mixture was chilled, and the resulting solid product was collected and recrystallized from acidified water (with a few drops of hydrochloric acid).<br>
Le, U.S. Patent 4,696,938 discloses a process for preparing and using methyl hydrazinecarbodithioate as an intermediate in the preparation of 6-aryl-pyridine thiosemicarbazones.  Methyl dithiocarbazinate is prepared as follows: Hydrazine hydrate (150 g) is added to a cooled (O°C) solution of potassium hydroxide in water (240 ml.) and 2-propanol (200 ml.). Pre-cooled carbon disulfide (182 ml.) is then added dropwise to the stirred reaction mixture, while maintaining the internal temperature below 10°C. After the addition is complete, stirring is continued for a further one hour. Cooled methyl iodide (426 g) is added dropwise for 1 1/2 hour. The resulting white precipitate is collected via filtration and washed with cooled water. The crude product is recrystallized from methylene chloride.<br>
To form 6-aryl-pyridine thiosemicarbazone, methyl dithiocarbazinate is reacted in a suitable solvent such as alcohol with the product of 6-aryl-2-alkylpyridine treated with selenium dioxide in a suitable ethereal solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or 1,4-dioxane.<br>
S. Losanitch, J. Chem. Soc., Vol. 119, pp. 763-765 (1921) discloses a process for preparing methyl dithiocarbazinate by first obtaining ammonium dithiocarbazinate and reacting it with methyl iodide. The ammonium dithiocarbazinate is obtained when a solution of hydrazine hydrate in alcohol, containing a large excess of ammonia, is slowly treated with cooling with the corresponding quantity of carbon<br>
disulfide. The methyl dithiocarbazinate is formed by treating the ammonium salt in a dilute alcohol solution with methyl iodide.<br>
Sandstrom et al, Arkiv For Kemi. 4(1952) 297, discloses a process for preparing ethyl dithiocarbazinate by decomposing diethyltrithio-carbonate with hydrazine. The process involves the separation of hydrazinium dithiocarbazinate from an ethanol-water mixture and the reaction of the hydrazinium dithiocarbazinate with ethyl bromide in an ethanol-water mixture.<br>
U.S. Patent 3,284,482 discloses a process for preparing chlorobenzyl esters of dithiocarbazinic acid as follows: To a solution comprising 85% hydrazine, 25% sodium hydroxide and 300 ml. of water is added carbon disulfide, dropwise at 10 to 15°C over 20 minutes. External cooling is removed and the reaction mixture is stirred for an hour at 25 to 30°C. Then, trichlorobenzyl chloride is added in one portion to the reaction mixture which is stirred for 24 hours at 25 to 30°C to produce the corresponding trichlorobenzyl dithiocarbazinate. The product is then extracted with ethyl ether. The ether solution is washed with water until it becomes neutral, is dried over sodium sulfate, and the ether is removed in vacuo.<br>
British Patent Specification 1,274,521 discloses dithiocarbazinic ester derivatives by reacting dithiocarbazinic acid esters with an oxo compound. The dithiocarbazinic acid is prepared by reacting hydrazine hydrate with carbon disulfide in alcohol medium in the presence of potassium hydroxide, ammonia or excess hydrazine hydrate.<br>
After isolation, the dithiocarbazinic acid salt is converted into an ester by an alkylating or aralkylating step. This step is carried out in water, a mixture of water and alcohol or in alcohol. Alternately, the ester can be prepared by a method wherein the reaction is carried out in a single reactor. The alkylating or aralkylating agent is added to the dithiocarbazinic acid salt solution prepared by the above method. The<br>
alkylating or aralkylating agents disclosed by the patent are: dimethyl sulfate, diethyl sulfate, allyl chloride, n-butyl iodide, n-octyl ester, n-dodecyl bromide, cetyl bromide, benzyl chloride, p-chlorobenzyl chloride, p-isopropylbenzyl bromide, p-n-butylbenzyl bromide, and alphamethylbenzyl chloride.<br>
As would be realized from the foregoing, there is a need for an economical process, i.e., a more facile and cost efficient process for preparing methyl dithiocarbazinate.  In particular, there is a need for a more economic commercial process for preparing methyl dithiocarbazinate.  By the present invention, there is provided such an improved process for preparing methyl dithiocarbazinate.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Surprisingly, it has been found that methyl dithiocarbazinate can be prepared by a facile and cost effective process. This improved process comprises reacting hydrazine, carbon disulfide and a base in an aqueous reaction medium, in an effective ratio to form a dithiocarbazinate salt, followed by reacting (methylating) the dithiocarbazinate salt with methyl bromide.<br>
In the present embodiment of the invention, carbon disulfide, hydrazine, and an inorganic base are reacted in water as the reaction vehicle. The resulting reaction mixture comprising dithiocarbazinate salt is reacted with methyl bromide to produce high yields of methyl dithiocarbazinate. Preferably, the reaction medium comprises water as the reaction vehicle and, optionally, a hydrocarbon solvent such as toluene.<br>
In contrast, the prior art processes generally involved the reaction of carbon disulfide and hydrazine in a reaction medium containing alcohols; separation of the resulting dithiocarbazinate; the use of relatively more expensive or more intractable and sometimes commercially cost prohibitive alkylating agents such as methyl iodide; and<br>
catalysts such as sodium iodide and/or recrystallization of the resulting methyl dithiocarbazinate.<br>
It is a distinct feature of the invention that by using the process of the invention one can eliminate the use of undesirable methylating agents such as methyl iodide, undesirable solvents such as alcohols, and expensive catalysts such as sodium iodide.  It is a distinct feature of the invention that the process requires short reaction times, requires no isolation of intermediate dithiocarbazinate salts, and no recrystallization of the final methyl dithiocarbazinate. Consonantly, the process of the invention fills a long felt but unmet need of using a facile process for preparing methyl dithiocarbazinate by using readily available and relatively less expensive reactants and solvents, and processing techniques.<br>
In the practice of the invention, methyl dithiocarbazinate can be used as an intermediate compound in the preparation of other chemicals such as thiadiazoles.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
As afore-stated, the claimed invention relates to a process for preparing methyl dithiocarbazinate (MDTC) by: (I) reacting carbon disulfide with hydrazine and a base in an aqueous reaction medium and in an effective ratio to form a dithiocarbazinate salt followed by (II) methylating the dithiocarbazinate salt of (I) with methyl bromide. The process can be represented by reactions (I) and (II), as follows:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Illustratively, hydrazine (usually in the form of hydrazine hydrate), carbon disulfide and an inorganic base are reacted in a mole ratio of about 1:1.2:1 to 1.2:1:2 and, preferably, 1:1:1.  For example, carbon disulfide and the inorganic base are added to hydrazine simultaneously and, preferably, dropwise. A phase transfer catalyst can be employed herein. Alternately, half of the carbon disulfide and half of the inorganic base can be first charged to the hydrazine, and then the other halves of carbon disulfide and the inorganic base are added.<br>
The reaction can be conducted in a pH range that does not adversely affect the reaction. Typically, the reaction ran be conducted in a pH range of about 8 to 14 and preferably 9 to 14. The reaction temperature can be about 0 to 35°C and preferably 5 to 25°C. Time of the reaction can be about 1 to 4 hours and preferably 1 to 2 hours.<br>
As the base, one can employ inorganic and nitrogenous bases as described hereunder. The base, in contradistinction with hydrazine, is described herein as an adjunct base. The inorganic base is preferably potassium hydroxide and more preferably powdered potassium hydroxide. It is believed without being bound to any particular theory that, other than potassium hydroxide, one can use other inorganic bases that can affect sufficient ion exchange with the subject hydrazinium ion. Illustrative of these other inorganic bases would be sodium hydroxide and lithium hydroxide. As the nitrogenous base, one can employ a nitrogenous compound such as ammonia, ammonium hydroxide and certain amines. The amines can be ethanolamine (which is preferred),<br>
di-n-propylamine, diisopropylamine, di-n-butylamine, f-butylamine, dimethyl benzylamine and ethylmethyl pyridine.<br>
The aqueous reaction medium typically contains water and optionally a non-aqueous solvent. The mole ratio of water to carbon disulfide can be about 2 to 10 and preferably 2 to 5 moles. A non-limiting example of the solvent can be hydrocarbon solvent such as an aromatic solvent selected from the group consisting of: xylene, cumene, benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene and mesitylene or aliphatic solvent selected from the group consisting of: pentane, hexane, cyclohexane and heptane. Typically, the solvent is an aromatic solvent which is preferably toluene. The solvent can be employed in a mole ratio of 0.1 to 3 and preferably 0.15 to 2 moles per mole of carbon disulfide. Unlike many of the prior art processes, the reaction medium of this process need not contain aprotic solvents. The reaction medium of this process consists essentially of water, and optionally a non-alcoholic solvent.<br>
The resulting product comprising the dithiocarbazinate salt is reacted with methyl bromide. The mole ratio of methyl bromide to the dithiocarbazinate salt can be from 1.5 to 1.02:1, and preferably 1.05:1. The methylation reaction temperature can be from about 0 to 35°C, over a period of about 0.5 to 3 hours and preferably 1 to 2 hours. The water, and optionally the solvent, and the catalyst employed in reaction (II) are essentially the same as described in reaction (I). The mole ratio of the water to the dithiocarbazinate salt can be from about 1 to 3:1 and preferably 1:1. The mole ratio of the solvent to the dithiocarbazinate salt can be from about 1.3 to 0.17:1 and preferably 0.5:1. The catalyst can be used in amounts of about 0.5 mole % to 10% preferably 0.5% to 1% per mole of dithiocarbazinate salt.<br>
While the methylation reaction (II) ran be conducted in another vessel, it is typically conducted in the same reaction vessel as used in<br>
the preparation of the dithiocarbazinate salt.  It is a distinct feature of the invention that the methylation reaction can be conducted without isolating the dithiocarbazinate salts of reaction (I).  In this embodiment of the invention, the methylating reaction (II) consists essentially of reacting the reaction product of reaction (I) with methyl bromide. Alternately, the dithiocarbazinate salt can be isolated by filtration and subsequently reacted with methyl bromide.  Illustratively, the dithiocarbazinate salt can be filtered, slurried in a reaction medium such as described above, and then reacted with methyl bromide. The reaction conditions would be essentially the same as described above.<br>
It is also a distinct feature of the invention that the methylating reaction (II) can be conducted without the use of expensive reaction catalysts such as sodium iodide.  In this regard, the methylating step can be said to consist essentially of reacting the reaction product of (I) with methyl bromide.<br>
The resulting product containing methyl dithiocarbazinate can be isolated by any convenient means such as filtering or centrifuging. The methyl dithiocarbazinate can be collected on a vacuum filter and washed with water to remove impurities such as potassium bromide salt. The resulting wet cake can be used as such or dried by any means that is effective to provide the requisite drying without causing its decomposition. Illustratively, the product can be dried at temperatures that do not cause decomposition of the products. More specifically, the product can be dried in a vacuum oven, using a nitrogen sparge at a temperature of about 30° to 40°C. Generally, the methyl dithiocarbazinate purity can be up to about 95 percent with variation attributable to washing and/or drying steps. As would be realized from the above, methyl dithiocarbazinate can be obtained without recrystallization of the reaction product of reaction (II). Therefore, methyl dithiocarbazinate can be prepared by a process consisting essentially of reacting carbon disulfide, hydrazine and<br>
a base in an aqueous medium, in an effective ratio to form a dithiocarbazinate salt, followed by methylating the dithiocarbazinate salt with methyl bromide, and removing the bromide salt.<br>
A catalyst, such as a phase-transfer catalyst can be employed in the reaction(s). An example of the catalyst is tris-[2-(2-methylethoxy) ethyl] amine (TDA-1), A/-benzyltrimethylammonium hydroxide (available from Aldrich Chemical Co.), A/-methylimidazole, dimethylaminopyridine, 1,4-diazabicyclo-(2,2,2)-octane and diethylene glycol. The mole ratio of the catalyst can be 0 to 300 mmoles and preferably 0 to 2 mmoles per mole of carbon disulfide.<br>
The following is a convenient, but non-limiting, description of the process for preparing the methyl dithiocarbazinate in accordance with this invention. Carbon disulfide is slowly added (with cooling) to a mixture of toluene, water, TDA-1, and hydrazine monohydrate at a temperature below 25°C. When the pH of the resulting slurry is stabilized at 9 to 10, aqueous potassium hydroxide is added to the mixture and the reaction mixture is stirred until the pH drops back to about 9. Three more equal portions of carbon disulfide and potassium hydroxide are added using the same protocol as described above. After the completion of the addition of these portions, the reaction mixture is stirred for 90 minutes, then methyl bromide gas is bubbled into the mixture over one hour. Typically, a white slurry is produced, stirred for about 30 minutes at about 25°C, cooled to about 0 to 5°C, and filtered. The filtered product which is usually in the form of a white powder, analyses as methyl dithiocarbazinate with a yield in the range of about 60 to 80 percent. The active ingredient (Al) is in the range of 65 to 95 percent. The major impurities are water and potassium bromide.<br>
As would be seen from the foregoing, the process of the invention is well suited to commercial applications because it employs readily available reagents and processing techniques.  Illustratively, the process<br>
can be carried out under reaction conditions which do not produce environmentally unacceptable by-products, reduce yield, affect quality of the end products or adversely impact production operations.<br>
These and other aspects of the invention are further illustrated but are not intended to be limited by the following examples in which all parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise specified.<br>
Accordingly the present invention relates to a process for preparing methyl dithiocarbazinate by reacting carbon disulfide, hydrazine and an adjunct base of the kind such as herein described in an aqueous medium, in an effective ratio to form a dithiocarbazinate salt, followed by methylating the dithiocarbazinate salt with methyl bromide.<br><br>

mol) over a 10 minute period, while maintaining the temperature at 25°C. The incremental addition of carbon disulfide and KOH was repeated five or more times, including the cool periods.  Methyl bromide (104.5 g, 1.1 moles) was then added over a period of 2 hours at 25°C. The reaction mixture was cooled to 0 to 5°C, and filtered under vacuum. The resultant product was then washed with cold water and then dried in a vacuum oven (40°C/20 mm) to yield 92.8 g (76.1%) of MDTC. The mother liquor contained an additional 3 to 5% net yield of MDTC. Although the invention has been described in detail in the foregoing for the purpose of illustration, it is to be understood that such detail is solely for that purpose and that variations can be made therein by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention except as it may be limited by the claims.<br><br><br>
