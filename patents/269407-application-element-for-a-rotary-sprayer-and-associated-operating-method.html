Description<br>
Application element for a rotary atomizer and associated<br>
operating method<br>
The invention relates to an application element for a rotary atomizer, in particular in the form of a bell-shaped plate or a rotary disk, and an associated operating method according to the subsidiary claims.<br>
For the serial painting of components, for example, motor vehicle bodies, it is known to use high-speed ro*tary atomizers, which comprise a rapidly rotating bell-shaped plate as the application element. The paint to be applied is normally fed to the rotating bell-shaped plate by means of a central paint pipe and then flows to the bell-shaped plate via an overflow  surface to an outer-lying annular peripheral spraying edge, where the paint is flung off bv centrifugal force.<br>
EP 0 951 942 A2 discloses a bell-shaped plate of this type which is provided specifically for the application of effect<br>
effect pigments or 'flakes'.<br>
However, in the use of conventional bell-shaped plates for applying effect paints, unwanted deviations in the colour tones and in the colour tone effect often occur when compared with conventional compressed air spraying, which are caused by the different material treatment in the spraying processes. In particular, during film formation and paint film flow in the region of the overflow surfaces, large frictional and shear forces arise, and these can damage the light-reflecting effect particles of the paint mij<ture.></ture.><br>
Damage to the finished coated bodies can occur during the surface finishing process (e.g. dirt inclusions, surface defects), during shell construction (surface and substrate defects) and during the further production steps, for example, final assembly, or such damage may become apparent during production. Such damage must be rectified. These subsequent local corrections are usually carried cut with an air spraying device. Therefore, when using the coirbiination of automatic paint spraying by means of a high-speed rotary atomizer together with manual correction using an air spraying device, despite the different application techniques, the visual appearance must be equivalent for both application methods.<br>
The reasons for this mixed operation lie therein that existing paints (formulations) should not be altered. Manual painting jobs are also still carried out in the paint line (between the automated cells ■-zones) where, for example, interior painting is carried out with an air spraying device. In addition, retooling or automation of existing paint lines takes place in stages, also resulting in mixed operation.<br>
different application techniques, the recipes for the paint materials used are therefore adapted in preparation such that equivalent results are produced following their different applications. The pigment corrections that are required as a result represent a significant additional effort in terms of materials and organisation. In particular, the colour tone matching capability must be monitored on changes cf batch in the paint supply. Furthermore, the repair paints necessary for manual corrections involve small quantities with a limited shelf life and quantity requirements that are difficult to ccilculate, so that the costs per litre are<br><br>
significantly higher than the material costs for normal automatic paint application with a high speed rotary atomizer. In addition, the paint required for manual correction cannot be taken from the normal production distribution pipes, which means that suitable repair paints must be kept available for all production paints and, for mixing, must be kept in motion with stirrers.<br>
A disadvantage of the aforementioned bell-shaped plate disclosed in EP 0 951 942 A2 is that the required colour tone is achieved by a high rotary speed and this has a negative effect on efficiency. Additionally, this involves higher deflection air values.<br>
DE 101 12 854 Al discloses a conventional bell-shaped plate for a high speed rotary atomizer, wherein the overflow surface is coated with a surface layer in order tc improve the abrasion performance of the overflovj surface and thereby to improve the service life of the bell-shaped plate. However, this known bell-shaped plate with a coated overflow surface also has the aforementioned disadvantages when applying effect paints.<br>
JP 08155348 also discloses a bell-shaped plate, the overflow surface of which is coated with a surface layer of fluororesin which is intended to improve the spraying performance. This bell-shaped plate also suffers from the aforementioned disadvantages when applying effect paints.<br>
DE 93 15 890 Ul discloses rotary atomizers wherein the coating powder to be applied is charged by triboelectric means through friction against a plastics surface. For this purpose, the overflow surface of the bell-shaped plate has a surface layer of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) which, due to<br><br>
the friction between the coating powder flowing over the overflow surface and the surface layer made from PTFE, provides for good triboelectric charging of the ccating powder. However, this known bell-shaped plate is also suitable only to a limited extent for the application of effect paints, since therein the aforementioned disadvantages arise.<br>
DE 44 39 924 Al discloses covering paint bells with an abrasion-proof and low friction carbon-containing coating, which also improves the paint finish, since the wettability properties of the surface of the paint bell are iirproved. Paint bells coated in this manner also suffer frorr the aforementioned problems in the application of effect paints.<br>
Finally, EP 0 087 836 Al discloses the reduction of surface friction on solid surfaces by friction-reducing ccatings which, for example, hav^e a scale-shaped crystal structure or contain nitrides.<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a bell-shaped plate which is as well suited as possible to the<br>
particles.<br>
This problem is solved with an application element and a corresponding method of operation according to the subsidiary claims.<br>
The invention is based on the newly acquired technical knowledge that the aforementioned problems arising in the application of effect paint are caused by the boundary surface friction between the paint film on the overflow<br><br>
surface of the bell-shaped plate and the overflow surface itself.<br>
The inventors discovered that the boundary surface friction between the paint film and the overflow surface leads to large frictional and shear forces in the paint film, which deforms the thin, flat effect particles of the effect paint and damages their surface, and this leads to the aforementioned unwanted colour tone deviations.<br>
They also found that the boundary surface frictior between the paint film and the overflow surface leads to relatively thick paint films, so that the thin, flat effect particles (flakes) stand upright within the paint film. The boundary surface friction can also lead to movement of the effect particles, particularly where they have a length cf, for example, 100 )am and a thickness of approximately 1 iim. The effect particles can become damaged due to surface abrasion and fracture, which impairs the desired colour tore (i.e. the visual effect of the applied paint). Reducing the surface friction between the paint film and the overflow surface, according to the invention, however, enables the c.amage to<br>
prevented.<br>
In contrast to the aforementioned coated bell-shaped plates of the prior art, the surface coating according tc the invention therefore produces a targeted reduction of boundary surface friction, whereas the surface coating with known bell-shaped plates is only intended to increase akrasion resistance, or is required for triboelectric charging.<br>
In a variant of the invention, the boundary surface friction between the paint film and the overflow surface is reduced in<br><br>
that the surface roughness of the surface layer on the overflow surface is reduced. Preferably, the surface roughness of the surface layer of the overflow surface is less than the thickness of the coating agent film. For example, the surface roughness of the surface layer of the overflow surface may be less than 200 iim, 100 um, 50 ]im,   10 Vim or even 5 ijm.<br>
In another variant of the invention, the boundary surface friction between the paint film and the surface layer of the overflow surface is reduced in that the overflow surface has a friction-reducing texture, and this can be a so-called riblet structure or a so-called artificial shark skin, which is known per se and therefore does not need to be further described. A friction-reducing shark skin film of this type is obtainable, for example, from the 3M Company urder the name "Scotchcal Marine Drag Reduction Tape".<br>
As mentioned above, the coating material (the material to be sprayed) is an effect paint including flat, solid effect particles (flakes) with a defined particle length and forms a paint film on the surface layer of the overflow surface, the<br>
paint film has a thickness which is smaller than the particle length of the effect particles. This offers the advantage that the individual particles of the effect paint cannot stand upright v/ithin the paint film and they therefore flow with an ordered spatial orientation over the overflow surface. Therefore, the paint film on the overflow surface has a thickness in operation which is preferably less than 200 urn, 100 urn, 50 ]im,   10 urn or even 5 ]im.<br>
Preferably, the surface layer on the overflow surface at least partially consists of a nitride, wherein, for example,<br><br>
titanium nitride, chromium nitride, titanium carbcn nitride, zirconium nitride, tungsten carbon nitride, and aluminium titanium nitride are suitable as materials for the surface layer of the overflow surface. However, the possibility exists within the context of the invention that the surface layer on the overflow surface at least partially consists of glass, ceramic material, metal or nanoparticles. However, all chemically inert, mechanically stable and well adhering materials are essentially suitable for the friction-reducing surface layer.<br>
It is also noteworthy that the friction-reducing surface layer is preferably locally limited to applicatior onto the whole of the overflow surface and/or other paint flow surfaces. However, as an alternative, the possibility also exists that the friction-reducing surface layer is limited to regions of the overflow surface which are subjected to large centrifugal forces. The further possibility exists that the whole rotating application element is coated with a friction-reducing surface layer.<br>
Furthermore, the surface layer of the overflow- surface is<br>
^oncoated overflow surface, in order to improve uhe abrasion properties of the overflow surface and thereby to improve the service life of the application element. The surface layer of the overflow surface therefore preferably has a Vickers hardness of more than 500 HV, 1000 HV, 1500 HV, 2000 HV or even over 3 000 HV.<br>
It should also be mentioned that the surface layei of the overflow surface preferably consists of a different material than the overflow surface situated thereunder.<br><br>
As an alternative, however, the possibility also exists that the surface layer of the overflow surface is made from the same material as the overflow surface situated thereunder. In this variant, the border surface friction can be reduced, for example, with a suitable surface texture of the surface layer.<br>
For example, the surface layer of the overflow surface can comprise a film applied to the overflow surface, wherein this may be a shark skin film which is used in aircraft construction to reduce frictional resistance, and was mentioned above.<br>
It is clear from the above description that the application element according to the invention is preferably a bell-shaped plate for a high-speed rotary atomizer. Hov\-ever, the invention is not restricted, with regard to the type of application element,- to bell-shaped plates, but ircludes, for example, rotary disks for disk atomizers. Rotary c.isks of this type and the associated disk atomizers are also disclosed, for example, in Pavel Svejda: "Moderne Lackiertechnik, Prozesse ^and Applikationsverfahrer" , Vincentz<br>
^-^-&gt; _w<br>
The invention relates to the application element according to the invention described above not only as a single component, but also a rotary atomizer with an application element of this type and a paint application machine, in particular a multi-axis paint robot with a rotary atomizer of this type.<br>
Finally, the invention also relates to a corresponding method of operation for a rotary atomizer of this type wherein the boundary surface friction between the coating agert film on<br><br>
the overflow surface and the overflow surface itself is specifically reduced with a friction-reducing surface layer.<br>
The surface friction is preferably reduced with the operating method according to the invention to such an extent that the thickness of the paint film on the overflow surface decreases until the film thickness is less than the particle length of the effect particles (the flakes, to be distinguished from pigments), such that the effect particles are not able to stand upright v/ithin the paint layer.<br>
e oaint material<br>
The invention therefore offers the advantage that an effect paint can be automatically applied by a rotary atomizer without special paints being necessary, without their effectiveness being worsened, and without the air usage being increased by greater deflection air levels, so that the colour tone result can be matched to the cjuality cf a<br>
com^^^res^*-^'^ air £'*^i"=^v coati —o usinc* the sain and without correcting the paint recipe.<br>
Other advantageous embodiments of the invention are disclosed in the subclaims or are described in the following<br>
reference to the drawings, in which:<br>
Fig. 1 shows a cross-section through a bell-shaped plate according to the invention for applying an effect paint, and<br>
Fig. 2  shows a greatly enlarged cross-sectional view of the overflow surface of the bell-shaped plate of Fig. 1.<br>
The drawing in Fig. 1 shows a bell-shaped plate 1 for a high¬speed rotary atomizer for the application of effect paint.<br><br>
The construction and functioning of the bell-shaped plate 1 is largely in accordance with the prior art and is described in EP 0 951 942 A2, so that the content of that document in its entirety can be considered to be part of the present description concerning the construction and functioning of the bell-shaped plate 1.<br>
In order to fasten the bell-shaped plate 1 to a bell-shaped plate shaft of a high-speed rotary atomizer, the bell-shaped plate 1 has a fastening hub 2 which is provided with an external thread which is screwed into a corresponding internal thread of the bell-shaped plate shaft.<br>
Feeding of the effect paint to the bell-shaped plate 1 takes place through the fastening hub 2 and a central opening 3 in the bell-shaped plate 1.<br>
Situated at the outlet orifice of the central ooenincf 3 on the front face side is a deflection member 4 which has a centrally arranged and radially extending rear surface 5 and an outer, conically extending rear surface 6. The two rear surfaces 5, 6 of the deflection member comprise a border<br>
region 7 of an otherwise conically extending overflow surface 8. The overflovj surface 8 encloses, together with the front surface of the bell-shaped plate 1, an almost constant angle a and leads to an annular peripheral spraying edge 9.<br>
The effect paint is fed axially to the bell-shaped plate 1, that is, via the fastening hub 2 and then passes through the central opening 3 in the bell-shaped plate 1. The deflection member 4 then deflects the effect paint in a radial direction, so that the effect paint flows over the overflow surface 8 and is finally flung off at the spraying edge 9.<br><br>
The inventive special feature of the bell-shaped plate 1 is apparent from the cross-sectional view in Fig. 2, which shows the overflow surface 8 with a paint film 10 situated thereon and a friction-reducing surface layer 11 situated therebetween. It is also apparent from the cross-sectional representation that the paint film 10 includes numerous long, flat effect particles 12 with a defined particle length<br>
LpAl=lTICLE ■<br>
The friction-reducing surface layer 11 on the overflow surface 8 reduces the boundary surface friction between the paint film 10 and the surface layer 11 or the overflow surface 8 to such an extent that damage to the effect particles caused by abrasion and fractures is prevented, in order thereby to prevent consequential colour tone deviations compared to other spraying methods, and to avoid any adaptation coses arising tuere^rom.<br>
It is also apparent from the cross-sectional view that the friction-reducing surface layer 11 has a layer thickness dL.;,---, which is significantly less than the film, th-ickness<br>
For example, the particle size LPARTTCLE may lie in i:he range 10 ijm to 40 iim, whereas the film thickness dp^iNT may lie, for example, in the range of 5 \im  to 20 um. The layer thickness diAYEP, of the friction-reducing surface layer 11 may lie in the range of 1 ]jm to 4 urn. However, the invention is not restricted to the above values, but may also be realised with other values of the particle size LPARTTCLE/ film thickness dpAXNT and layer thickness dLAYER-<br><br>
It is also noteworthy that the friction-reducing surface layer 11 in this embodiment is made from titanium nitride and reduces the boundary surface friction between the paint layer 10 and the overflow surface 8 by a factor of 4.<br>
The invention is not restricted to the above described preferred embodiment. Rather, a number of variants and deviations is possible, which also make use of the inventive concept and therefore fall within the protective scope.<br><br>
