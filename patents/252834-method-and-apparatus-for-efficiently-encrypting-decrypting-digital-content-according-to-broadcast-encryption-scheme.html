SAMSUNG  ELECTRONICS   CO.   LTD.,   a  Korean  Corporation   of 416,   Maetan-dong, Yeongtong-gu, Suwon-si, Gyeonggi-do 442-742, Republic of Korea;<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and ascertains the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
Description<br>
METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR EFFICIENTLY<br>
ENCRYPTING/DECRYPTING DIGITAL CONTENT<br>
ACCORDING TO BROADCAST ENCRYPTION SCHEME<br>
Technical Field<br>
 	The present invention broadly relates to digital content protection and, more par-<br>
ticularly, to an apparatus for and a method of efficiently encrypting and/or decrypting digital content according to a broadcast encryption scheme.<br>
 	Recently, the transmission of digital contents using a variety of communication<br>
media including the Internet, ground wave, cable, and satellites and sales and rental of digital contents using high capacity recording media have rapidly increased. Accordingly, digital rights management (DRM) that is a solution to protect copyright of digital contents has been emerging as an important issue. Among technologies related to the DRM, research on a broadcast encryption scheme, (by which widely distributed digital contents are protected by encrypting the digital contents broadcast by using recording media, such as a CD, a DVD and the Internet), has been actively conducted.<br>
 	FIG. 1 illustrates the conventional broadcast encryption scheme.<br>
 	Referring to FIG. 1, the conventional broadcast encryption scheme uses a 2-stepped<br>
encryption process, in which digital content is encrypted by using a content key and the content key used for the encryption is encrypted by using a revocation key. Generally, digital content encrypted by using a content key CK is expressed as E(CK, Content), and the content key encrypted by using a revocation key (Ki) is expressed as (E(Ki, CK)}. Here, the curly brackets {} indicate that the revocation key (Ki) is a key set formed with a plurality of Ki's.<br>
 	Also, in order to decrypt the content encrypted according to the conventional<br>
broadcast encryption scheme, a 2-stepped decryption process should be performed in which the encrypted content key is decrypted by using a revocation key and the encrypted content is decrypted by using the obtained content key.<br>
 	The revocation key described above is allocated to each of devices to which the<br>
broadcast encryption scheme is applied, and among these devices, a device that cannot be protected any more by the broadcast encryption scheme due to exposure of the revocation key or to other reasons is revoked. Thus, revoked device cannot decrypt a digital content complying with the broadcast encryption scheme by using a revocation key that the revoked device has.<br>
 	FIG. 2 illustrates an example of a tree used in the conventional broadcast encryption<br><br><br><br>
scheme.<br>
 	Referring to FIG. 2, one parent node has two child nodes in the tree shown in FIG.<br>
2 and the tree is a binary 4-level tree formed with 4 levels. Also, one key is allocated to each of the nodes of the tree.<br>
 	The top node among the nodes of the tree is referred to as a root node, and a node at<br>
the bottom is referred to as a leaf node. According to the conventional broadcast encryption scheme, each of the devices corresponds to one of the leaf nodes and keys {Ki} of nodes, positioned on a path from a respective leaf node of the respective device to the root node, are allocated to the device.<br>
 	For example, in case of key set allocation of a device 1, keys of nodes positioned on<br>
The  pain form the mode  corresponding to the device to the root mode are K1, K2<br>
 K4, and K8 and these keys are allocated to the device 1.<br>
 	If all devices are not revoked, a content server performing broadcast encryption<br>
encrypts a content key by using only the key Kl of the root node, and a device performing decryption corresponding to the broadcast encryption decrypts the encrypted content key by using only the key Kl of (he root node. Also, if only devices 1 and 2 are revoked among the devices, the content server performing broadcast encryption encrypts a content key by using revocation keys K3 and K5, and a device performing decryption corresponding to the broadcast encryption decrypts the encrypted key by using the revocation keys K3 and K5, Disclosure of Invention<br>
Technical Problem<br>
  	However, according to the conventional broadcast encryption scheme, the content<br>
server performing broadcast encryption should encrypt a content key by always using a revocation key, and the device performing decryption corresponding to the broadcast encryption should decrypt the encrypted content by always using the revocation key. In other words, a revocation key is used whether a revoked device is present or not. Accordingly, this increases the computational load on the content server and the device to which the conventional broadcast encryption scheme is applied.<br>
Technical Solution<br>
 	The present invention provides an apparatus and method of protecting digital<br>
content by selectively encrypting and/or decrypting a content key according to whether there is a revoked device among devices to which a broadcast encryption scheme is applied.<br>
 	The present invention also provides a computer readable recording medium having<br>
embodied thereon a computer program for executing the method described above.<br>
Advantageous Effects<br><br><br><br><br>
 	According to the exemplary embodiments of the present invention, only when there<br>
is a revoked device among devices to which the broadcast encryption scheme is applied, a content key is encrypted by using a revocation key, and the encrypted content key is decrypted. By doing so, an unnecessary encryption process and decryption process that occurs when there is no revoked device arc not performed any more. As a result, contents can be more efficiently protected.<br>

Mode for Invention<br>
 	The present invention will now be described more fully by describing exemplary,<br>
non-limiting embodiments with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the drawings same reference characters denote analogous elements.<br>
 	Referring to FIG. 3, a home network according to an exemplary embodiment of the<br>
present invention is formed with a content server 10 and six devices 11 through 16.<br>
 	The content server 10 encrypts a content key by using a revocation key {Ki} only<br>
when there is a revoked device among the devices 11 through 16, and if there is no revoked device among the devices 11 through 16, the process of encrypting a content key by using the revocation key {Ki} is omitted.<br>
 	Accordingly, only when there is a revoked device among the devices 11 through 16,<br>
the devices 11 through 16 decrypt the content key {E(Ki, CK)} encrypted by using the revocation key {Ki}, and if there is no revoked device among the devices 11 through 16 (as depicted in FIG. 3), the devices 11 through 16 omit the process of decrypting the content key {E(Ki, CK)} encrypted by using the revocation key {Ki}.<br><br><br><br>
 	Thus, by encrypting a content key using the revocation key {Ki} only when there is<br>
a revoked device and decrypting the encrypted content key, unnecessary encryption process and decryption process that occurred when no revoked device is present can be eliminated.<br>
 	FIG. 4 is a diagram of the structure of a content encryption apparatus according to<br>
an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.<br>
 	Referring to FIG. 4, the content encryption apparatus according to the exemplary<br>
embodiment of the present invention is mounted on the content server 10 shown in FIG. 3, and is formed with a reception unit 101, a revocation determination unit 102, a first encryption unit 103, a second encryption unit 104, a third encryption unit 105, a packet generation unit 100, and transgressions unit 10/. <br>
 	The reception unit 101 receives a content and license information with respect to<br>
the content. The reception unit 101 may receive this content and the license information related to the content provided by the content producer through a network such as the Internet, or may receive them through a recording medium such as a DVD.<br>
 	By referring lo the license information received in the reception unit 101, the<br>
revocation determination unit 102 determines whether or not there is a revoked device among the devices 11 through 16 having licenses on the content received in the reception unit 101, and according to the determination result, the revocation determination unit 102 connects the first encryption unit 103 to the second encryption unit 104 or to the third encryption unit 105.<br>
 	More specifically, if the revocation key {Ki} in the license information received in<br>
the reception unit 101 is the root key KI, the revocation determination unit 102 determines that there is no revoked device among the devices 11 through 16 having licenses for the content received in the reception unit 101, and if the revocation key {Ki} in the license information received in the reception unit 101 is not the root key KI, the revocation determination unit 102 determines that there is a revoked device among the devices 11 through 16 having licenses for the content received in the reception unit 101.<br>
 	The first encryption unit 103 encrypts the content received in the reception unit 101<br>
	with a content key corresponding to this content. As the result of the encryption in the<br>
first encryption unit 103, the encrypted content E(CK, Content) is generated. When the<br>
content server 10 is manufactured, the content key is stored in a place where the key<br>
can be protected safely from an intrusion from the outside.<br>
 	According to the determination result of the revocation determination unit 102, the<br>
second encryption unit 104 selectively encrypts the content key used for the encryption in the first encryption unit 103 by using a revocation key {Ki} to prevent a revoked device from decrypting the content received in the reception unit 101. As the result of<br><br><br><br>
the encryption in the second encryption unit 104, an encrypted content key {E(Ki, CK)} is generated.<br>
 	More specifically, if it is determined by the revocation determination unit 102 that<br>
there is a revoked device, that is, if the revocation key {Ki} in the license information received in the reception unit 101 is not the root key Kl, the second encryption unit 104 is connected to the first encryption by the revocation determination unit 102 and as the result, the content key used for the encryption in the first encryption unit 102 is encrypted by using a revocation key {Ki}. Also, if it is determined by the revocation determination unit 102 that there is no revoked device, that is, if the revocation key {Ki} in the license information received in the reception uni! 101 is the root key Kl, the  second everyone unit  104  is not connection  to the first  encryption  me revocation determination unit 102, and as the result, the content key is not encrypted by using the revocation key Kl.<br>
 	According to the determination result of the revocation determination unit 102, the<br>
third encryption unit 105 generates an encrypted content key E(Kd, CK) by encrypting the content key used for the encryption in (he first encryption unit 103, or generates a double-encrypted content key E[Kd, {E(Ki, CK)}] by encrypting the content key encrypted by the second encryption unit 104.<br>
 	More specifically, if it is determined by the revocation determination unit 102 that<br>
there is a revoked device, the third encryption unit 105 generates the double-encrypted content key E[Kd, {E(Ki, CK)}] by encrypting the content key encrypted by the second encryption unit 104. Also, if it is determined by the revocation determination unit 102 that there is no revoked device, the third encryption unit 105 is connected to the first encryption unit 103 by the revocation determination unit 102 and generates the encrypted content key E(Kd, CK) by encrypting the content key used for the encryption in the first encryption unit 103.<br>
 	According to an encryption algorithm between the content server 10 and the devices<br>
11 through 16, the third encryption unit 105 encrypts the content key used for the encryption in the first encryption unit 103, or encrypts the content key encrypted by the second encryption unit 104. For example, if the encryption algorithm between the content server 10 and the devices 11 through 16 is a secret key encryption scheme, the content server 10 and each of the devices 11 through 16 share one secret key and by using this secret key, the third encryption unit 105 encrypts the content key used for the encryption in the first encryption unit 103, or encrypts the content key encrypted in the second encryption unit 104.<br>
 	Also, if the encryption algorithm between the content server 10 and the devices 11<br>
through 16 is a public key encryption scheme, the content server 10 has respective public keys of the devices 11 through 16 and each of the devices 11 through 16 has a<br><br><br><br>
private key paired with one public key. By using these public keys, the third encryption<br>
unit 105 encrypts the content used for the encryption in the first encryption unit 103, or<br>
encrypts the content key encrypted in the second encryption unit 104.<br>
 	These secret and public keys can be used with an identical value in a predetermined<br>
domain, such as for instance a home network shown in FIG. 3, or can be used with<br>
different values for devices 11 through 16 disposed in the home network shown in<br>
FIG. 3. In the former case, content can be freely distributed in a predetermined domain,<br>
such as a home network, and the secret key and the public key are also referred to as a<br>
domain key. Meanwhile, in the latter case, content can be distributed to only devices<br>
having secret kcvs anions devices disposed in a home network and the secret key and<br>
Uie public key are aiso reicrrcd 10 as a uevice Key.<br>
 The packet generation unit 106 generates a packet including license information<br>
received in the reception unit 101, the content encrypted by the first encryption unit<br>
103, and the content key encrypted by the third encryption unit 105.<br>
 	FIG. 5 is a diagram showing the format of a packet according to an exemplary<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
 Referring to FIG. 5, the packet according to the exemplary embodiment of the<br>
present invention is formed with a license information field 51, an encrypted content<br>
key field 52, and an encrypted content field 53.<br>
 	License information that is based on the license information received in the<br>
reception unit 101 is recorded in the license information field 51. The content key<br>
encrypted by the third encryption unit 105 is recorded in the encrypted content key<br>
field 52. The content key encrypted by the first encryption unit 103 is recorded in the<br>
encrypted content field 53.<br>
 	Referring again to FIG. 5, the license information field 51 is formed with a<br>
revocation presence subfield 511, a usage information subfield 512, a device in<br>
formation sub field 513, a key information subfield 514, and a content information<br>
subfield 515. Those skilled in the art of the exemplary embodiment will understand<br>
that the license information field 51 should include the revocation presence subfield<br>
511, and other fields can be included selectively.<br>
 	A value indicating the determination result of the revocation determination unit<br>
102, that is, a value indicating whether or not there is a revoked device, is recorded in the revocation presence subfield 511. More specifically, if it is determined by the revocation determination unit 102 that there is a revoked device, True (binary 1), a value indicating that there is a revoked device, is recorded in the revocation presence subfield 511. Also, if it is determined by the revocation determination unit 102 that there is no revoked device, False (binary 0), a value indicating that there is no revoked device, is recorded in the revocation presence subfield 511. That is, the revocation<br><br><br><br>
presence subfield 511 may be a flag indicating whether or not there is a revoked device.<br>
 	Information on the use of a content, such as copy control information (CCI), is<br>
recorded in the usage information subfield 512. The CCI is information indicating whether or not the content can be copied, the frequency of permitted copy, and so on.<br>
 	The identification (ID) of a device having a license for a content to be included in a<br>
packet to be generated in the packet generation unit 106 is recorded in the device information subfield 513.<br>
 	Key information on an encryption algorithm between the content server 10 and the<br>
devices 11 throueh 16 is recorded in thckev information subficid 514. For example, if uie encryption aigoiunm uawecn tne content server lu ana me uevices 11 througn to is a public key encryption method, a public key is recorded in the key information subfield 514.<br>
 	Information on a digital content to be included in the packet to be generated in the<br>
packet generation unit 106, for example, the content editor, the content owner, and the contents of the digital content, is recorded in the content information subfield 515.<br>
 	The transmission unit 107 transmits the packet generated in the packet generation<br>
unit 106 to the devices 11 through 16 through the home network.<br>
 	FIG. 6 is a diagram of the structure of a content decryption apparatus according to<br>
an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.<br>
 	Referring to FIG. 6, the content decryption apparatus according to the exemplary<br>
embodiment is mounted on one of the devices 11 through 16, shown in FIG. 3. By way of an example, the content decryption apparatus may be mounted onto a device 11 depicted in FIG. 6 and is formed with a reception unit 111, a packet interpretation unit 112, a revocation determination unit 113, a first decryption unit 114, a second decryption unit 115, a third decryption unit 116, and a content output unit 117.<br>
 	With reference to FIG. 6, a case where the content decryption apparatus according<br>
to the exemplary embodiment is mounted on the device 11 among the devices 11 through 16 shown in FIG. 3 will be explained. The following explanation analogously applies to the devices other than the device 11 when the content decryption apparatus according to the exemplary embodiment of the present invention is mounted.<br>
 	The reception unit 111 receives a packet from the content server 10 through a home<br>
network.<br>
 	The packet interpretation unit 112 interprets the packet received in the reception<br>
unit 111, and as the result, detects that the received packet is formed with a license information field 51, an encrypted content key field 52, and an encrypted content field 53, and detects, in particular, that the license information field 51 is formed with a revocation presence subfield 511, a usage information subfield 512, a device in-<br><br><br><br>
formation subfield 513, a key information subfield 514, and a content information subfield 515.<br>
 	By referring to the value of the revocation presence subfield 511 detected according<br>
to the interpretation result of the packet interpretation unit 112, the revocation determination unit 113 determines whether or not there is a revoked device among the devices 11 through 16 having licenses to obtain content included in an encrypted form in the packet received in the reception unit 111, and according to the determination result, the packet interpretation unit 112 connects the first decryption unit 114 to the second decryption unit 115 or to the third decryption unit 116.<br>
 	More specifically, if the value of the revocation presence subfield 511 detected<br>
according 10 tne interpretation result oi tne pacKci interpretation uuu i n inuicaic.-&gt; una there is a revoked device, that is, the value is True (binary 1), the revocation determination unit 113 determines that there is a revoked device among the devices 11 through 16 having licenses for content included in an encrypted form in the packet received in the reception unit 111. Also, if the value of the revocation presence subfield 511 rlclcclcd according to the interrelation result of (he packet interpretation unit 112 indicates that there is no revoked device, that is, the value is False (binary 0), the revocation determination unit 113 determines that there is no revoked device among the devices 11 through 16 having licenses for content included in an encrypted form in the packet received in the reception unit 111.<br>
 	The first decryption unit 114 decrypts an encrypted content key E[Kd, {{E(Ki,<br>

 	If there is a revoked device, there will be a double-encrypted content key [Kd,<br>
{E(Ki, CK)} ] recorded in the encrypted content key field 52, and if there is no revoked device, there will be an encrypted content key E(Kd, CK) recorded in the encrypted content key field 52. However, regardless of whether [Kd, {E(Ki, CK)}] or E(Kd, CK) is recorded in the encrypted content key field 52, the first decryption unit 114 only needs to decrypt data recorded in the encrypted content key field 52 mechanically by using a predetermined key Kd.<br>
 	The first decryption unit 114 decrypts the encrypted content key E[Kd, {E(Ki, CK)}<br>
] or E(Kd, CK) according to the encryption algorithm between the content server 10 and the devices 11 through 16.<br>
 	For example, if the encryption algorithm between the content server 10 and the<br>
devices 11 through 16 is a secret key encryption scheme, the content server 10 and each of the devices 11 through 16 share one secret key and by using this secret key the<br><br><br><br>
first decryption unit 114 decrypts the encrypted content key E[Kd, (E(Ki, CK))] or E(Kd, CK) by using this secret key.<br>
 	Also, if the encryption algorithm between the content server 10 and the devices 11<br>
through 16 is a public key encryption scheme, the content server 10 has respective public keys of the devices 11 through 16 and each of the devices 11 through 16 has a private key paired with one public key. The first decryption unit 114 decrypts the encrypted content key E[Kd, {E(Ki, CK)}] or E(Kd, CK) by using this private key.<br>
 	By using a revocation key {Ki) to prevent a revoked device from decrypting a<br>
content included in an encrypted form in the packet received in the reception unit 111, the second decryption unit 115 selectively decrypts the encrypted content key (E(Ki,<br>
As the result of the decryption in the second decryption unit 115, a content key CK is generated.<br>
 	More specifically, if it is determined by the revocation determination unit 113 that<br>
there is a revoked device, that is, if the value of the revocation presence subfield 511 is True (binary 1), the second decryption unit 115 is connected to the first decryption unit 114 by the revocation determination unit 113, and as the result, the second decryption unit 115 decrypts the encrypted content key (E(Ki, CK)}, that is, the decryption result of the first decryption unit 114, by using a revocation key {Ki}.<br>
 	Also, if it is determined by the revocation determination unit 113 that there is no<br>
revoked device, that is, if the value of the revocation presence subfield 511 is False (binary 0), the second decryption unit 115 is not connected to the first decryption unit 114 by the revocation determination unit 113, and as the result, the second decryption unit 115 docs not decrypt the encrypted content key (E(Ki, CK)} by using a revocation key {Ki}. In this case, the content key CK is already generated by the decryption in the first decryption unit 114 and the encrypted content key {E(Ki, CK)} does not exist.<br>
                        The third decryption unit 116 decrypts the encrypted content E(CK, Content)<br>
recorded in the encrypted content field 53 detected according to the interpretation result in the packet interpretation unit 112, by using the content key CK decrypted by the first decryption unit 114 or the content key CK decrypted by the second decryption unit 115 according to (he determination result of the revocation determination unit 113. As the result of the decryption in the third decryption unit 116, the content that the content server 10 desires to provide to the device 11 is generated.<br>
 	More specifically, if it is determined by the revocation determination unit 113 that<br>
there is a revoked device, the third decryption unit 116 decrypts the encrypted content E(CK, Content) recorded in the encrypted content field 53 detected according to the interpretation result in the packet interpretation unit 112, by using the content key CK decrypted by the second decryption unit 115. Also, if it is determined by the revocation<br><br><br>
determination unit 113 that there is no revoked device, the third decryption unit 116 is connected to the first decryption unit 114 by the revocation determination unit 113 and decrypts the encrypted content E(CK, Content) recorded in the encrypted content field 53 detected according to the interpretation result in the packet interpretation unit 112, by using the content key CK decrypted by the first decryption unit 114.<br>
 	The content output unit 117 outputs the content decrypted by the third decryption<br>
unit 116 to a user. The content output unit 117 processes the content in a method corresponding to the characteristic of the content and outputs the content to the user. For example, if the content is in a compressed form, the content output unit 117 decompresses the content and outputs the result to the user. However, this is provided by way oi a non-iiuuung example aim uiusc SKIUCU UI uie art ot uie present invention win understand that the content output unit 117 can process a variety of jobs in order to output the content decrypted by the third decryption unit 116 to the user.<br>
