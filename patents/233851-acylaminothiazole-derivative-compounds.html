The compounds of general formula (I) may<br>
contain one or more asymmetric carbons. They may<br>
therefore exist in the form of enantiomers or of<br>
diastereoisomers. These enantiomers or diastereo-<br>
isomers, and mixtures thereof, including the racemic<br>
mixtures, form part of the invention.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) may exist in the<br>
form of bases or of addition salts with acids. Such<br>
addition salts form part of the invention.<br>
These salts are advantageously prepared with<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable acids, but the salts of<br>
other useful acids, for example, for the purification<br>
or the isolation of the compounds of formula (I), also<br>
form part of the invention.<br>
The compounds of general formula (I) may<br>
exist in the form of hydrates or of solvates, namely in<br>
the form of associations or combinations with one or<br>
more molecules of water or with a solvent. Such<br>
hydrates and solvates also form part of the invention.<br>
In the text which follows, the expression<br>
leaving group is understood to mean a group which can<br>
be easily cleaved from a molecule, with departure of an<br>
electron pair, by the breaking of a heterolytic bond.<br>
This group may thus be easily replaced by another group<br>
during a substitution reaction for example. Such<br>
leaving groups are, for example, halogens, or an<br>
activated hydroxyl group such as a mesylate, tosylate,<br>
triflate, acetyl and the like. Examples of leaving<br>
groups and references for their preparation are given<br>
in "Advanced Organic Chemistry", J. March, 3rd Edition,<br>
Wiley Interscience, p. 310-316.<br>
The expression protecting group is understood<br>
to mean a group which makes it possible to prevent the<br>
reactivity of a functional group or a position, during<br>
a chemical reaction which may effect it, and which<br>
releases the molecule after cleavage according to<br>
methods known to persons skilled in the art. Examples<br>
of protecting groups and methods of protection and<br>
deprotection are given, inter alia, in Protective<br>
groups in Organic Synthesis, Greene et al., 2nd Ed.<br>
(John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York).<br>
The second subject of the invention is<br>
methods for preparing the compounds of formula (I).<br>
Thus, these compounds may be prepared by<br>
methods, illustrated in the schemes which follow, whose<br>
operating conditions are conventional for persons<br>
skilled in the art.<br>
According to Scheme 1, the compound of<br>
formula (I) may be obtained by peptide coupling of the<br>
amine of formula (XI) with the acid of formula (XII)<br>
according to conditions known to persons skilled in the<br>
art, for example in the presence of benzotriazol-1-<br>
yloxy-tris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluoro-<br>
phosphate (BOP) and N-ethylmorpholine or N-methyl-<br>
morpholine in an inert solvent such as dimethyl-<br>
formamide, acetonitrile or dichloromethane at a<br>
temperature which may range from 0°C to room<br>
temperature.<br>
The amine of formula (XI) is obtained by<br>
peptide coupling of the amine of formula (VIII) with<br>
the amino acid of formula (IX), in which Pg represents<br>
a protecting group, under conditions as described<br>
above, to give the compound of formula (X). The amino<br>
acid of formula (IX) is, for example, protected by<br>
means of an N-tert-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc). The compound<br>
(X) is then deprotected according to methods known to<br>
persons skilled in the art, to give the amine of<br>
formula (XI). For example, if the protecting group used<br>
is Boc, the latter may be deprotected by acid<br>
hydrolysis, in the presence of anhydrous gaseous<br>
hydrochloric acid.<br>
The compound of formula (VIII) may be<br>
prepared according to Scheme 2.<br>
According to this scheme, the aralkyl of formula (II),<br>
in which Y represents a leaving group, preferably a<br>
halogen atom such as bromine and Z represents a halogen<br>
atom such as bromine, is condensed with an alkali metal<br>
thiolate or alcoholatef for example of formula R2X" Na+<br>
in which X represents an oxygen or sulphur atom. The<br>
reaction is carried out in an inert solvent such as<br>
dimethylformamide at a temperature which may range from<br>
0°C to 50°C, to give the compound of formula (III). The<br>
aryl or formula (III) is converted to boronic acid of<br>
formula (IV) according to an adaptation of the method<br>
described by Schoevaars, J. Am. Chenu Soc, 1999, 121,<br>
9550-9561. The conversion may, for example, be carried<br>
out by prior formation of the anion of the compound of<br>
formula (III), for example by the action of a strong<br>
base such as butyllithium, in an ethereal solvent such<br>
as tetrahydrofuran, at temperatures which may range<br>
from -50°C to -80°C. This anion is then reacted with a<br>
borate such as trimethyl borate to give, after<br>
hydrolysis, the boronic acid of formula (IV).<br>
The coupling of the boronic acid (IV) with<br>
the 5-bromothiazole of formula (VI) in which Pg<br>
represents a protecting group, such as an imino, for<br>
example a diphenyl ketone imine, may be carried out<br>
according to the Suzuki reaction, by adaptation of the<br>
method described by Wolfe, J. Org. Chem., 1997, 62,<br>
4943-4948, to give the 5-phenylthiazole of formula<br>
(VII). The coupling is carried out, for example, in an<br>
ethereal solvent such as dioxane in the presence of<br>
tripotassium phosphate trihydrate and a catalyst such<br>
as tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium (0) at a<br>
temperature which may range from room temperature to<br>
the reflux temperature of the solvent. The 5-<br>
phenylthiazole of formula (VII) thus prepared is then<br>
deprotected according to methods known to persons<br>
skilled in the art to generate the 5-phenyl-2-amino-<br>
thiazole of formula (VIII).<br>
The 5-bromothiazole of formula (VI) is<br>
obtained by protecting the amino functional group of<br>
the corresponding compound of formula (V). Preferably,<br>
it is protected in the form of a diphenyl ketone imine<br>
under conditions known to persons skilled in the art.<br>
The starting compounds, in particular the<br>
compounds of formula (II), (V), (IX) and (XII) are<br>
commercially available or are described in the<br>
literature, or may be prepared by methods which are<br>
described therein or which are known to persons skilled<br>
in the art.<br>
For example, 5-bromo-2-aminothiazole (V) may be<br>
obtained by bromination of the corresponding 2-amino-<br>
thiazole according to an adaptation of the method<br>
described by Kaye, J. Chem. Soc. Perkin I, 1981,<br>
2335-2339.<br>
For example, the compound of formula (XII) may be<br>
obtained by adaptation of the methods described by<br>
Middleton et al., J. Org. Chem., 45, 14, 1980, 2883-<br>
2887 and by Miyamoto et al., J. Amer. Chem. Soc, 114,<br>
15, 1992, 6256-6257.<br>
The meanings of X, R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R5', R6<br>
and n in the compounds of formula (II) to (XII) are as<br>
defined for the compounds of formula (I).<br>

preparation of some compounds in accordance with the<br>

The following table illustrates the chemical<br>
structures and the physical properties of a few of the<br>
compounds of the invention.<br>
In this table:<br>
- m.p. (°C) represents the melting point of the<br>
compound in degrees Celsius;<br>
-  [aD] (c = 1, CH3OH) represents the optical rotation of<br>
the compound at the concentration of 1 g/l in methanol;<br>
-  (S) or (R) in columns "R3" and "R5, R5'" indicate the<br>
stereochemistry of the asymmetric carbons, carrying R3<br>
or R5 respectively, in formula (I). For the carbon<br>
carrying R5, the indication (S) or (R) does not relate<br>
to the case where R5 and R5' form together an oxo or<br>
amine group.<br>
The compounds described in this table were<br>
prepared according to the methods described above.<br>
The compounds of the invention have been the<br>
subject of pharmacological trials which have shown<br>
their value as active substances in therapy.<br>
They have in particular been tested for their<br>
ß-amyloid peptide (p-A4) production inhibiting effects.<br>
P-Amyloid peptide (ß-A4) is a fragment of a<br>
larger precursor protein called APP (amyloid precursor<br>
protein). The latter is produced and is present in<br>
various cells of animal or human tissue. At the<br>
cerebral level, its cleavage by protease-type enzymes<br>
leads to the formation of the ß-A4 peptide which<br>
accumulates in the form of an amyloid plaque. The two<br>
proteases responsible for the production of the amyloid<br>
peptide are known by the name of beta- and gamma-<br>
secretases;s (Wolfe MS, Secretase targets for Alzheimer' s<br>
disease: identification and therapeutic potential, J.<br>
Med. Chem., 2001 June 21; 44(13), 2039-60).<br>
However, it has been demonstrated that this<br>
gradual deposition of the ß-A4 peptide is neurotoxic<br>
and could play an important role in Alzheimer's<br>
disease.<br>
Thus, the compounds of the present invention,<br>
as inhibitor of the production of P-amyloid peptide<br>
(p-A4) by inhibition of gamma-protease, can be used in<br>
the treatment of pathologies such as senile dementia,<br>
Alzheimer's disease, Down's syndrome, Parkinson's<br>
disease, amyloid angiopathy, cerebrovascular disorders,<br>
frontotemporal dementia and Pick's disease, post-<br>
traumatic dementia, pathologies linked to<br>
neuroinflammatory processes, Huntington's disease and<br>
Korsakov's syndrome.<br>
The tests were carried out according to the<br>
protocol described below.<br>
For the p-amyloid cellular trial, the CHO-K1<br>
line coexpressing the CT100 of APP and PS1 M146L clone<br>
30-12 is used. The line targets the inhibition of<br>
gamma-secretase. Presenilin is linked to the gamma-<br>
secretase activity (Wolfe MS, Haass C, The Role of<br>
presenilins in gamma-secretase activity, J. Biol.<br>
Chem., 2001 Feb. 23, 276(8), 5413-6) and its<br>
coexpression with the amyloid protein or its N-terminal<br>
fragment causes an increase in the secretion of the<br>
Al-42 peptide (P~A4) thus generating a pharmacological<br>
tool which makes it possible to evaluate inhibition by<br>
the compounds of formula (I) of the production of the<br>
p-A4 peptide. The inoculation of the 96-well culture<br>
plates is carried out at the rate of 1 x 105 cells per<br>
well in 150 |il of incubation medium. The presence of a<br>
minimum percentage (1.3% final) of serum allows<br>
cellular adhesion to the plastic after 2-3 hours of<br>
incubation at 37°C, in the presence of 5% CO2. The<br>
products (15 µl) are tested at 10 µM DMSO 1% final and<br>
are incubated for 24-25 h at 37CC in the presence of 5%<br>
CO2 and of 100% humidity. After this incubation of<br>
24-25 h, the cellular supernatants (100 µl) are<br>
transferred to the ELISA plates, treated with the<br>
capture antibody 6E10 (6E10, epitope: aa1-17,<br>
INTERCHIM/SENETEK 320-10), to determine the amount of<br>
amyloid peptides secreted by the cells in the presence<br>
of compounds according to the invention. A series for a<br>
synthetic control peptide, "peptide 1-40", at 5 and<br>
10 ng/ml is treated in parallel. The ELISA plates are<br>
incubated overnight at 40C.<br>
The quantity of bound peptide is detected in<br>
an indirect manner in the presence of a competitor<br>
corresponding to the truncated peptide, peptide 1-28<br>
coupled to biotin which is then detected with<br>
streptavidin coupled to alkaline phosphatase. The<br>
substrate, p-Nitrophenyl Phosphate (pNPP FAST<br>
p-Nitrophenyl Phosphate, Sigma N2770), gives a yellow<br>
soluble reaction product which can be read at 405 nm.<br>
The reaction is stopped with a 0.1M EDTA solution. For<br>
that, after attachment of the amyloid peptide in the<br>
ELISA plate, 50 µl of biotinylated peptide 1-28 are<br>
added to 100 µl of cell supernatant and incubated for<br>
30 minutes at room temperature. The ELISA plates are<br>
then washed 3 times. After drying by inverting on<br>
absorbent paper, 100 µl of streptavidin-Alkaline<br>
Phosphatase (Interchim/Jackson ImmunoResearch<br>
Laboratories 016-050-084), are added per well and<br>
incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The plates<br>
are again washed and then alkaline phosphatase<br>
substrate (pNPP 1 mg/ml) is added in an amount of<br>
100 µl per well. After incubating for 30 minutes at<br>
room temperature, the reaction is stopped by the<br>
addition of 100 µl per well of 0. 1M EDTA and the<br>
reading is carried out at 405 nm.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) according to the<br>
invention showed an EC50 (50% effective concentration)<br>
of less than 500 nM. In particular, compound No. 50 in<br>
the Table showed an EC50 equal to 2 95 nM. The compounds<br>
for formula (I) according to the invention showed more<br>
&gt; particularly an EC50 of less than 100 nM.<br>
The results of the biological tests show that<br>
the compounds are inhibitors of the formation of the ß-<br>
amyloid peptide (ß-A4).<br>
Thus, these compounds may be used in the<br>
treatment of pathologies in which an inhibitor of the<br>
formation of the ß-amyloid peptide (ß-A4) provides a<br>
therapeutic benefit. In particular, such pathologies<br>
are senile dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Down's<br>
syndrome, Parkinson's disease, amyloid angiopathy,<br>
cerebrovascular disorders, frontotemporal dementia and<br>
Pick's disease, post-traumatic dementia, pathologies<br>
linked to neuroinflammatory processes, Huntington's<br>
disease and Korsakov's syndrome.<br>
The use of the compounds according to the<br>
invention,, in the form of base, salt, hydrate or<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable solvate, for the<br>
preparation of a medicament for treating the<br>
abovementioned pathologies forms an integral part of<br>
the invention.<br>

or an addition salt thereof with a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable acid or alternatively a hydrate or a solvate<br>
of the compound of formula (I). These medicaments find<br>
their use in therapy, in particular in the treatment of<br>
the abovementioned pathologies.<br>
