TITLE OF INVENTION<br>
"Device for Prevention of Fluid Overflow in Positive Displacement Pumps Having Provision for Gaseous Components<br>
                                           Separation" <br><br>
M IDCO Limited having office at<br>
(a)	Metro Estate, Vidyanagari Marg, Kalina, Mumbai 4000 98<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to fluid overflow prevention system capable of being integrated with positive displacement pump/s that has provision for separation of gaseous elements in the fluid. In particular the invention relates to a fuel pump integrated with the system to prevent fluid overflow along with a system to separate gaseous efement from a fuel.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Typically in the pumps that are provided with gaseous component / air separation provision, a secondary non-pressurized zone is provided. This zone is in connection with the pressurized zone for liquid / fuel / fuel gaseous element inlet for fuel outlet of the pump and suction port. If the rate of flow of fuel from the pressurized zone is more than that of the outflow to the pump suction, there is a danger of flooding of the non-pressurized zone wherein the fluid oozes out of the air vent creating a harmful atmosphere. As a matter of fact if the closed system like the pumping unit has any opening to the atmosphere then there is a chance of fluid oozing out. In the case of the positive displacement pump in question the air vent provides a similar opening.<br>
Various attempts to overcome this problem are reported in the literature, they are as follows:<br>
United States Patent 5884809 discloses air separating fuel dispensing system wherein the system includes an above-tank suction pump which draws fuel from the tank. The fuel is discharged from the suction pump into a vertically aligned air separator so as to produce a fuel stream that is substantially free of air. The fuel stream is discharged from the air separator to a flow meter and the nozzle through a fuel shutoff valve. The open/closed state of the fuel shutoff valve is controlled by a control actuator based on the differential processor across the air separator. Should this differential pressure drop below a given level, the fuel shutoff valve is closed to prevent the system from inadvertently supply a fuel stream with an unacceptably high air content. Gaseous fluid removed by the air separator is supplied to an air eliminator. The fuel components of this fluid stream are removed<br><br><br>
in the air eliminator and returned to the suction pump. However, an integrated system to prevent fluid overflow is not reported .<br>
Patent number: WO/1998/050303 discloses air separating fuel dispensing system. The system includes an above-tank suction pump which draws fuel from the tank. The fuel is discharged from the suction pump into a vertically aligned air separator so as to produce a fuel stream that is substantially free of air. The fuel stream is discharged from the air separator to a flow meter and the nozzle through a fuel shutoff valve. The open/closed state of the fuel shutoff valve is controlled by a control actuator based on the differential pressure across the fuel shutoff valve. Should this differential pressure drop below a given level, the fuel shutoff valve is closed to prevent the system from inadvertently supplying a fuel stream with unacceptably high air content. Gaseous fluid removed by the air separator is supplied to an air eliminator. The fuel components of this fluid stream are removed in the air eliminator and returned to the suction pump.<br>
European Patent EP0357513 discloses fuel dispenser with a device for controlling. It comprises of a pump for retail delivery wherein the fuel is degassed by means of a vortex device. A control valve shuts off delivery if the gas content in the degassed liquid being delivered via a main duct is too high. Unlike prior systems which sense gas content only in the liquid being delivered, the present invention senses the greater gas content in the recycled gas-enriched fraction from the vortex separator device. This is done by means of a venturi system controlling a servo-valve which in turn controls the control valve. By using a magnified image of the gas content, the system is made more sensitive and more reliable. However this system does not have fuel overflow prevention system that works in tandem with gas separator.<br>
United States Patent 6748982 discloses Integrated fuel delivery and vapor recovery system for a fuel dispenser. The apparatus includes a fuel dispenser having a  member constructed from extruded  material  connected to the fuel<br><br><br>
dispenser. The member has at least one fluid conduit located inside the member for transporting fluid. The member also has a vapor conduit located inside the member for transporting vapor.<br>
United States Patent 6290760 discloses air separator system An apparatus and method for separating dissolved gasses from a fluid to produce de-aerated fluid which includes a fluid pump, a gas separator, and a vacuum pump for removing liberated dissolved gasses from the gas separator, in one particular embodiment, a unified pump/meter unit is used to both pump fluid, as well as volumetrically measure the amount of de-aerated fluid pumped. However this system is installed at the inlet of the pump and is not integrated with the pump. The system is bulky.<br>
Patent Number GB967106 discloses improvements relating to liquid fuel dispensing apparatus in which two liquids are mixed in variable proportions or supplied separately by adjustment of variable gearing at connecting the outputs of two meters has one grade of liquid e.g. petrol from motor driven pump and air separator supplied to both meters, and a second liquid, e.g. oil, is pumped into the supply to one meter in a predetermined fixed proportion to the petrol supplied thereto. The fixed proportion of oil is produced by a meter driven by gearing from the output of meter.<br>
United States Patent 6290760 discloses air separator system for separating dissolved gasses from a fluid to produce de-aerated fluid which includes a fluid pump, a gas separator, and a vacuum pump for removing liberated dissolved gasses from the gas separator. In one particular embodiment, a unified pump/meter unit is used to both pump fluid, as well as volumetrically measure the amount of de-aerated fluid pumped.<br>
European Patent EP1189832 discloses system and method for deaerating and dispensing liquid fuel. As disclosed in publication number WO0076910 it discloses a system for monitoring the quantity of air in a liquid-state fuel stream discharged from a dispenser. The dispenser includes a pump that draws the fuel from a storage tank. The fuel stream discharged from the pump is applied to an air separator in which the air and vapor-state fluids are removed from the fuel stream.<br><br><br>
The gas-removed fuel stream is allowed to flow to nozzle for dispensing. The gas stream created by the air separator is flowed to an air elimination chamber. The fuel in the gas stream separates from the air in the air elimination chamber and is returned to an input side of the pump. The air in the air elimination chamber is vented through a fixed opening to the ambient environment. The monitoring system includes a transducer that monitors the rate ot air flow through the air elimination chamber. This monitoring may be performed by monitoring the air pressure in the chamber upstream of an orifice through which the air is vented to atmosphere. If the air flow rate is greater than a set level, the system closes a valve that regulates fuel flow to the nozzle. Thus, this system prevents fuel that contains an excessive quantity of gaseous-state fluids from being dispensed.<br>
Patent number KR20020070753 discloses pump unit integrated with flow meter wherein a pump and the flow meter are incorporated in a casing wherein a channel which connects the pump and the flow meter is formed on the casing. An air separator and a Strainer on the discharging side are provided on the channel.<br>
Thus the study of the related prior art reveals a major technological gaps such as lack of fluid overflow prevention system integrated with pump and gaseous element separation systems of the pumps.<br>
Necessity has constantly been felt to develop a fluid overflow prevention system that can be integrated with pump that has provision for separation of gaseous elements in the fluid and works in tandem with the gaseous element separation system to avoid fluid overflow through vent to atmosphere.<br>
