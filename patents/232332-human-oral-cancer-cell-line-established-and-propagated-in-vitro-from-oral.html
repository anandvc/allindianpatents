				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a stable human oral cancer cell carcinoma cell line suitable for understanding the differences in the tumorigenic pathways implicated in the development and progression of oral squamous cell carcinoma obtained from the floor mouth of a chronic tabacco consumer.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Oral cancer ranks as the sixth most common globally and is a major cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality. The aetiology of betel and tobacco related oral cancer is considerably different to that resulting from smoking of tobacco. Exposure of the oral mucosa of habitual betel quid chewers to a plethora of carcinogenic constituents of tobacco and areca nut causes multiple genotoxic insults at the site bolus application, often resulting in the development of clinically distinct premalignant lesions, leukoplakia or erythroplakia, which undergo malignant transformation. Established human oral cancer cell lines are widely used to study the mechanism implicated in oral tumorigenesis. The human oral cancer cell lines available in Cell Repositories and Culture Collections around the world have been established from the Western or Japanese population and resulting from smoking of tabacco. In this respect, reference is made to Table 1.<br><br>

Presently, there are no oral cancer cell lines resulting from chewing of tabacco.' Majority of the studies  on oral carcinogenesis has been carried out using tissue specimens (biopsy or surgically resected oral premalignant and malignant lesions)or cell lines resulting from smoking of tobacco. Majority of the studies on oral carcinogenesis has been carried out using tissue specimens (biopsy or surgically<br>
v<br>
resected oral premalignant and malignant lesions) or cell lines resulting from smoking<br>
     of tobaccoThe recent awareness of inherited nature of some cancers, ethnic groups,<br><br>
existence of cancer families and importance of surveillance  of high risk individuals using cancer susceptibility genes as markers   emphasizes the need to establish oral cancer cell lines resulting   from chewing of tabacco to provide a much needed model for oral tumorigenesis. The existing oral cancer cell lines are from smoking of tabacco and thus are not suitable for studies  pertaining to cancer susceptibility originating from chewing of tobacco. It may be  argued that these studies could be carried in human oral cancer tissue specimens. However, in-depth studies carried out by the applicants have shown that the availability of the tissue specimen poses a major constraint on the work.   Often the biopsy/FNAC specimens yield insufficient<br><br>
number of tumor cells for detailed molecular analysis. Furthermore, the yield of RNA from biopsy/surgically resected tissue specimens maybe low reducing the feasibility of conducting studies   aimed at identification of genes that are differentially expressed indifferent stages of oral tumorigenesis by Differential   Display Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Research (DDRT-PCR). Hence, the non-availability of an experimental model system for tobacco induced oral cancer is a major obstacle in understanding the mechanism underlying oral tumorigenesis. Establishment of human oral cancer cell lines from betel and tobacco consumers is of utmost importance to provide an in vitro experimental model system for oral tumorigenesis.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of this invention is to propose a human oral cancer line established and propogated in vitro from the oral squamous cell qSUJcinome obtained from the floor of mouth of a chronic tobacco consumer.<br><br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a human oral squamous cell carcinoma cell line from the floor of the mouth of a habitual tobacco consumer for the study of genetic/molecular alterations involved in development and progression of an environmental carcinogen induced malignancy.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to propose a human oral cancer line established and propogated in vitro from the oral squamous cell curcinome; obtained from the floor of mouth of a chronic tobacco consumer for indentifying novel targets for use as diagnostic/prognostic markers and designing new therapeutic strategies for more effective management of cancer patients.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to propose a human oral cancer line established and propogated invitro from the oral squamous cell curcinome obtained from the floor of mouth of a chronic tobacco consumer which may be advantageously used for various applications as described hereinbelow.<br><br>
DETA1LED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided human oral cancer cell line established and propagated in vitro from oral squamous cell carcinoma obtained from the mouth of a chronic tobacco consumer, wherein said cell line AMOS-III has the following marker profile:<br>
a.	positive for tumor suppressor gene product, p53; marker of invasion and<br>
metastasis, ets-1; ternary complex factors, elk; retinoic acid receptors, RXRoc;<br>
RARoc; anti-apoptotic protein and chaperone, HSP 70; epithelial specific antigen,<br>
ESA; human cytokeratin, CK 14, cell cycle regulatory protein, p21; Oncogene<br>
cyclin Dl, heat shock protein, HSP90; transcription factor, ets-2; proliferation<br>
marker; Ki67.<br>
b.	Negative for human papilloma virus, HPVE6; mesenchymal cells marker,<br>
Vimentin; Low level of expression of oncogene MDM2, the p53 suppressor<br>
protein.<br><br>
Further according to this invention there is provided a method  of producing  human oral cancer cell line which comprises:<br>
a.	subjecting oral squamous cell carcinoma from the floor of mouth to the step of<br>
biopsy in Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) as a buffer  supplemented<br>
with antibiotics ( penicillin and   streptomycin) and amphotericin B;<br>
b.	cutting the treated tissue of step (a) into smaller pieces;<br>
c.	washing the cut tissues with solution of antibiotics;<br>
d.	the washed tissues being introduced into tissue culture flasks having a medium<br>
comprising DMEM and Media 199 supplemented with fetal bovine serum<br>
(FBS) and growth supplements to allow the growth of cells comprising<br>
fibroblast cells which grow earlier than the epithelial cells.<br>
e.	Removing the fibroblasts cells from the culture to obtain a cell line<br>
comprising essentially of epithelial cells.<br><br>
In accordance with this invention, tissue specimen was collected in the medium, DMEM supplemented with antibiotics (penicillin for example lOOU/mland streptomycin for example 100 ug/ml). The specimens were washed several times with antibiotic solution before processing these for setting up the primary cultures. Tissue were minced into 1-2 cu.mm pieces using a cutting instrument, such as scalpel blade, and transferred into tissue culture flask containing DMEM supplemented with 10-20%FBS (fetal bovine serum), Glutamine for example 2mM and growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (5-15ng/ml)   Initially, only limited success was achieved due to several inherent problems in obtaining contamination free oral tissue samples. The most perpetual problem encountered during the establishment of primary cultures/cell lines for oral SCC and leukoplakia was frequent bacterial and fungal contamination. Chronic exposure  of the oral cavity to a variety of bacteria and viruses as well as to a plethora of known carcinogens viz., betel quid coated with lime, areca catechu, nut, alkaloids and tobacco often causes ulceration of the oral mucosa, thereby increasing the probability of contamination.  Some of the   other problems included, low yield of viable cells, poor adherence to the plastic substratum, slow growth, cell division and   outgrowth of fibroblasts. To circumvent these problems several<br><br>
strategies were tried: a) patients were given thorough antibacterial and antifungal mouth wash several times prior to removal/resection of the tissue; subsequently tissue specimens were washed several times in DMEM containing solution of antibiotics (streptomycin, lOOug/ml; pencillin 100U/ml)and fungizone (0.25ug/ml); b) tissue specimens were treated with different concentrations of collagenase or dispase to improve the yield of cells; c) Adherence of the cells was improved by testing several solid support  systems such as precoating the tissue culture flask with varying concentrations of polylysine or collagen; d)to combat the problem of slow cell division various strategies were tried such as high FBS concentration, supplementation of growth medium with different growth factors such as Insulin, transferrin-selenium alone or in combination and epidermal growth factor (EGF, lOng/ml). Using several different permutations/combinations and different concentrations of EGF, we could finally overcome these problems encountered during the process of establishment of primary cultures from oral SCCs.<br>
One of the major problems faced in cultivation of epithelial cells is the out growth of fibroblasts. Fibroblasts grow more rapidly than epithelial cells and hence made culturing  of epithelial cells quite difficult. Primary epithelial cultures that contained<br><br>
fibroblasts were treated with anti-fibroblast antibody, IB 10 that binds to the surface molecule of human. The cells were then treated with young rabbit serum (1:8 dilution in medium) as a source of complement   This lead to the complement mediated lysis of the fibroblast cells. Two to three such treatements gave a predominant population of epithelial cells, essentially free of fibroblasts. These cultures were allowed to grow to sub-confluency. Thereafter, the subconfluent cultures   were subcultured and passaged at periodic intervals.<br>
AMOS-HI       cultures were characterized including growth parameters, anchorage independent growth, morphological studies, immunological surface markers of epithelial lineage, karyotyping, DNA   content and analysis of status of oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes and  other cell cycle regulatory proteins and their expression.<br>
The cell line can be used to<br>
i) investigate the basic/molecular machanisms and pathobiology of tabacco induced cancer of prime importance in the Indian context. The biological relevance of alterations in cell cycle regulatory genes such as p53, bcl-2, p21/wafl, mdm2 and HSP70.<br><br>
ii)       identify genes which are differentially expressed in oral cancer, iii)       design novel gene therapy approaches for management or oral cancer, iv)      test the efficacy of novel synthetic retinoids for chemoprevention of oral cancer<br>
and indentify retinoid responsive genes, which are differentially expressed and<br>
provide insight into the mechanism of action of retinoids. v) study mechanisms implicated in invasion and metastasis, vi) understand the molecular mechanisms implicated in multidrug resistance,<br>
design novel multimodality therapeutic regimes for better management of the<br>
disease and design novel modulators for circumvention of drug resistance, vii)      The work assumes importance as supply of these cell lines to National and<br>
International Culture Collections would give an access of much needed in vitro<br>
experimental model system to several other laboratories/regional centers<br>
which, due to limited resources, are unable to develop this facility on their own.<br>
In view of the aetiological and ethnic differences between the Indian and<br>
Western popoulation these cells   lines are of considerable interest to the<br>
Western countries as well, viii)     Introduction of tumor suppressor genes eg. Transdominant (ligand inducible<br>
chimeric) tumor suppressor p53 constructs, or anti-sense approach against ix)       oncogenes as shown for HSP70 in these cells is of tremendous value for<br>
designing new gene therapy approaches for oral cancer, x)       These cell lines can be used to study chromosomal aberrations occurring due<br>
to tobacco consumption.<br><br>
