manufacturing the same<br>

3. Preamble to the description:<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner<br>
in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
This invention relates to biodegradable multi-layered composite packaging materials and to<br>
methods for manufacturing the same.	<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Various packaging products are known wherein biodegradable materials such as paper, jute or naturally corrosive and subsequently biodegradable metallic Toils are laminated with non biodegradable petro-plastics to achieve properties like high strength, heat sealing and/or to control unwanted fibres, foreign particles or surface impurities to come in contact with the packed goods, particularly edible goods. For example, extrusion coating of polyethylene is done on paper to enable heat sealing during the process of packaging or manufacture of pouches and<br>
polyethylene lamination is done to Hessian or Jute fabric to ensure that no fibres or foreign<br><br>
particles get mixed with the packed edible material. A disadvantage of these laminations is they<br>
turn the naturally biodegradable materials non degradable.<br>
One solution propagated through the industry is to laminate biodegradable substrates such as paper with biodegradable PLA (poly lactic acid) or PHA (polyhydroxy alkanoate) layers by processes such as coextrusion with an adhesive polymer to avoid delamination. But there are certain limitations to the PLA and PHA coatings i.e. the cost is very high, the sealing properties are not that good and also the lamination method with adhesive requires expensive processes which add to the final cost of the multi-layered biodegradable product.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a multi-layered biodegradable composite packaging material and method of manufacturing same that overcomes or at least mitigates some or all of the problems and disadvantages of existing packaging materials and methods of manufacture.<br>
Statement of invention<br>
According to a first aspect, the present invention provides a biodegradable multi-layered composite packaging material comprising of a biodegradable substrate layer and a biodegradable film uniformly well adhered at least on one side of the said substrate without using any adhesive)<br><br>
Combining two biodegradable materials as per the invention can give better properties in strength, smoothness and bioderadability without sacrificing inherent properties of heat sealing and down stream conversion. The end product will be a biodegradable multi-layered composite packaging material, which shall be beneficial to the society.<br>
The invention has application to various types of substrates while retaining stretchability of the substrate and elasticity of the biodegradable water soluble/non soluble hydrophilic film and simultaneously enhancing the physical characteristics like tensile, tear, puncture resistance, burst factor, and breaking strength of the resulting biodegradable packaging-material.<br>

The biodegradable substrate and biodegradable film may be combined by layering, coating, impregnating or laminating resulting into a biodegradable multi-layered composite packaging material with enhanced characteristics like strength and biodegradability.<br>

hydrophilic film with liner; (ii)  wetting the substrate by passing it through a wetting tray containing water with or without a<br>
wetting agent; (iii) removing excess water from the substrate;<br>
(iv) applying the preformed water soluble/non soluble hydrophilic film to the wet substrate; (v)   storing the laminate of biodegradable substrate with preformed water soluble/non soluble<br>

Examples:<br>
A water soluble/non soluble hydrophilic film was laminated with a biodegradable substrate such as crepe paper, the strength of the laminate increased as compared to the biodegradable substrate. In this example of a crepe paper (110 GSM with 40% crepe) laminated to a water soluble/non soluble hydrophilic film of 25 GSM. The data comparison of the tensile strength test between crepe paper and crepe paper + water soluble/non soluble hydrophilic film laminate, done on a Universal Testing Machine (UTM) (from International Equipments), is as below:<br><br><br>
This invention also creates a range of options to use combinations of lower GSM of paper by tailoring the percentage of creping for specified end use applications. The various embodiments of the invention therefore provides for the use of combining biodegradable materials taking advantage of the best characteristics of the combining materials resulting in novel "high-performance multi-layered biodegradable composite materials".<br>
In a non-limiting example as in case of crepe paper one can use a 50-gsm paper and with 40 % crepe stretch with layering/lamination/coating/impregnating of 25 GSM of water soluble/non soluble hydrophilic film to result in a "multi-layered biodegradable composite material" that is equivalent to a material of about 110 GSM of Kraft paper. Such new "multi-layered biodegradable composite materials" would result in the use of less weight of the packaging material saving in freight, give higher yield of packaging material per kilo of raw material used, etc.<br>
In another example, a laminate as shown in fig. 5 was produced consisting layers of paper (31), water soluble/non soluble hydrophilic film (32), aluminium foil (33) and another water soluble/non soluble hydrophilic film (34) laminated together as per the methods mentioned above. This laminate can be used for packaging various liquids such as milk, juices, etc, with non soluble biodegradable film in contact with the liquid.<br>
In yet another example, jute or hessian fabric is layered/laminated/coated/impregnated with a water soluble/non soluble hydrophilic film so that cement or other fine powdered material will<br><br>
not go waste due to seepage. This laminate can also be used for packing various food products such as sugar so that the fibres or unwanted particles will not get mixed with the edible material. The laminate will have an added advantage of better heat sealing, which was not possible if only jute or hessian fabric was used to make bags.<br>
The multi-layered biodegradable composite materials thus produced are most suited for a variety of applications including, but not limited to, a wide range of packaging materials like grocery sacks, box inter-liner, retail pouches, shopping bags etc.<br>
Biodegradability Test:<br>
Following laminated materials were placed in the mature compost for time scale of 6 months as specified under EN 13432 standard.<br>
1.	PE + crepe paper laminate<br>
2.	PE + Aluminium foil laminate<br>
3.	water soluble film + Crepe paper laminate<br>
4.	non soluble hydrophilic film + Aluminium foil laminate<br>
After 6 months it was observed that the water soluble film + Crepe paper laminate had almost disintegrated completely.
