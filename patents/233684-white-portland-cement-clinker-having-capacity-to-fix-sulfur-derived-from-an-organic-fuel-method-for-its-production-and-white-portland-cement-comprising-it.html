				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is related to a new<br>
family of clinker and white portland cements compositions,<br>
and more particularly, to a family of white clinkers<br>
compositions with a high content of sulfur coming from,<br>
namely, sulfur in fuel fixing, and the properties of<br>
cements thus obtained.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Portland cement clinker is basically composed of<br>
four crystalline stages: alite-. 3CaO.Si02 (C3S) , belite:<br>
2CaO.Si02 (C2S) , tricalcic aluminate: 3CaO.Al2O3 (C3A) and<br>
tetracalcic aluminate: 4CaO.Al2o3. Fe2O3 (C4AF) , the latter,<br>
is the only one colored and therefore, the only one<br>
responsible for the characteristic color of the ordinary<br>
gray Portland cement.<br>
The ordinary Portland cement is the product from<br>
the Portland cement clinker grinding and a setting<br>
regulator, which traditionally has been gypsum (CaS04.2H20).<br>
Processes and plants used for clinker of white<br>
Portland Cement (P.C.) manufacturing are widely known in<br>
the art. Generally, manufacturing process White P.C.<br>
clinker differs from Gray P.C. in the following basic<br>
aspects:<br>
(1) Chemical: Since for obtaining a White P.C.<br>
clinker (the total Fe203 content from raw materials), in<br>
White P.C. clinker is controlled and most be less than<br>
0.5%. This involves removing the main melting agent from<br>
the gray P.C. clinker and therefore, liquid stage will only<br>
be formed from calcium aluminates, that will crystallize<br>
after a cooling process as C3A, thus eliminating formation<br>
of the C4AF solid solution; responsible for the gray P.C.<br>
color.<br>
(2) Sintered: Removing main melting element from<br>
the gray Portland cement clinker, involves that the melting<br>
agent in the white P.C. clinker is in less amount and over<br>
all, that the temperature in the liquid stage increases,<br>
from 2440.4°F (in a gray P.C. clinker), to a temperature of<br>
2642 - 2678°F (in a white P.C. clinker), thus demanding a<br>
higher fuel consumption during sintering, compared to the<br>
gray P.C. clinker sintering process.<br>
(3) Cooling: In the obtaining process of white<br>
P.C. clinker, typically clinker cooling process is tougher<br>
than in the gray P.C. clinker manufacturing process, trying<br>
to stabilize the most of Iron on a reduced state, (Fe2 + ) ,<br>
that is less chromophore than (Fe3+).<br>
Despite the differences above mentioned between<br>
both Portland cement clinker manufacturing processes,<br>
basically the two Portland cement clinkers are generally<br>
constituted by the same main mineralogical stages: C3S, C2S,<br>
C3A and C4AF (exclusively for Portland cement gray clinker).<br>
Advantages of a white P.C. over a gray P.C., are<br>
basically their white color, for which it is widely used<br>
for exposed structures and texturized elements, which can<br>
be white or colored; it is also common that white Portland<br>
cement develops better strength to compression due to a<br>
high content on C3A, compared to a gray Portland cement. A<br>
disadvantage of a white Portland cement is its low<br>
resistance to sulfates attack, mainly due to the high<br>
content of C3A, that reacts to the environment sulfates and<br>
ettringite is produced when mortar or concrete is hardened,<br>
causing fissures or cracking.<br>
On the other hand, in the state of the art, it is<br>
known that sulfur coming from traditionally used fuels for<br>
the cement industry, such as gas (non sulfur containing)<br>
carbon (1-2% S) , fuel oil (2-4% S) and low sulfur content<br>
pet-coque (
anhydrite, CaOS03, and in the presence of alkali leaching<br>
it forms alkaline sulfates: Na2O.S03 and K2O.SO3. Said<br>
anhydrite and alkaline sulfates fixing on the clinker is a<br>
desirable factor since up to date it has represented, the<br>
only way of extracting sulfur from the interior of the<br>
furnace, avoiding blockings and obstructions of the kiln<br>
itself, as well as the emission of S0x to the atmosphere.<br>
In this way, sulfur, since it is a semi-volatile<br>
element, it forms within the furnace, a cycle which re-<br>
concentrates sulfur and once it reaches a critical SO3<br>
evaporating concentration, it is associated to the kiln<br>
clustering that makes kiln operation difficult and unstable<br>
reducing its production, and can even form serious<br>
blockings, that may involve a stoppage in the kiln itself.<br>
On the other hand, fuel-oil cost is inversely-<br>
proportional to its sulfur content. For this reason, the<br>
high sulfur content pet-coke (S &gt; 5%), represents an<br>
opportunity for the cement industry due to its availability<br>
at the lower cost.<br>
Unfortunately, the use of said fuel shows the<br>
inconvenient that it requires special care for the<br>
operation; and new methods that could ease use without<br>
detriment to the furnace operation continuity. This is, the<br>
use of the pet-coke as fuel, in one hand, generates the<br>
necessary heat to keep the process temperature, and on the<br>
other, produces a higher amount of SO2 this means an<br>
important amount that can produce blockings on the pre-<br>
heater and form rings on the rotating kiln, which generates<br>
troubles on the operation, reducing its efficiency and in<br>
more serious cases, it does not allow to continue its<br>
operation.<br>
On one hand, and particularly in relation to the<br>
Portland cement clinker, in the state of the art there are<br>
numerous efforts aimed to facilities, equipment and/or<br>
processes design, for the use of solid fuels with a high<br>
sulfur content, in order to solve the problem associated to<br>
SO2 forming and accumulation. However, most of processes<br>
and/or plants that manufacture Portland cement clinker and<br>
use a solid fuel with a high sulfur content, present<br>
certain disadvantages such as complexity of processes and<br>
equipments, as well as high operational costs. Examples of<br>
said efforts are disclosed in, for example, the United<br>
States application No. 4,465,460 entitled "Cement clinker<br>
production" issued to Paul Cosar on August 14, 1984; United<br>
States applications No. 4,662,945 and 4,715,811 both<br>
entitled "Process and apparatus for manufacturing poor<br>
cement clinker in sulfur" issued to Thomas R. Lawall on May<br>
5, 1987 and in December, 1987 respectively; the United<br>
States application No, 6,142,771 entitled "Cement clinker<br>
production control using high sulfur content fuel within a<br>
rotating kiln with a Lelep-Lepol displaceable grid through<br>
the sulfur final analysis in the final product", issued to<br>
Joseph Doumet on November 7, 2000; the Chinese Application<br>
No. 1,180,674 issued to Wang Xinchang et al on May 6, 1998<br>
entitled "Method for producing high quality cement using<br>
pet-coke with a high sulfur content".<br>
A recent effort to solve problems associated to<br>
the use of high sulfur content coke, is disclosed by<br>
Mexican Application No. PA/a/2001/007228 entitled "Method<br>
of producing cement clinker using high sulfur content pet-<br>
coke" filed on July 13, 2 0 01 by Trademarks Europa, S.A. de<br>
C.V., which is a subsidiary of CEMEX group. On this<br>
application, a method to produce cement clinker that allows<br>
a more economic and efficient use of fuels with a high<br>
sulfur content such as pet-coke and that minimizes problems<br>
associated to blocking and incrustations due to the high<br>
concentration of SO2 and/or SO3 on the system. It is<br>
described in this document, the relationship to a high<br>
quality cement clinker that does not require additives to<br>
improve its final physical properties.<br>
On the other hand, there is a current of<br>
scientists and technologists who have focused their efforts<br>
on the reduction of the Portland cement clinker sintering,<br>
through row mix or raw meal chemical modifications, and<br>
have frequently used non-traditional mineralizers and<br>
melting agents. Examples of this current are generally<br>
described in the United States application No. 5,698,027<br>
entitled "Method and Plant for manufacturing mineralized<br>
Portland cement clinker" granted to F.L. Smidth &amp; Co.,<br>
which is related to a mineralizer such as gypsum, fluorite,<br>
etc., as a control parameter for preventing or reducing<br>
problems associated to the rotating kiln operation; the<br>
Spain application No. 542,6 91 "Process for obtaining white<br>
clinker with a low fuel consumption using fluorite and<br>
sulphates as raw meal components", describes a process for<br>
producing a clinker composition which is formed under lower<br>
temperatures compared to traditional temperatures for the<br>
Portland clinker manufacturing", forming a new liquid phase<br>
called f luorelestadite: 3C2S. 3CaO4.CaF2. Besides, said<br><br>
cements, exhibit/show some problems with strength<br>
development, over all, at early ages (1 and 3 days) , even<br>
when strength increases at long ages (2 8 days and more) ,<br>
compared to strength developed by common Portland cement.<br>
There is a third group of researchers who have<br>
found non-Portland clinkers cementing compositions, based<br>
on the formation of a phase rich in sulfur, calcium<br>
sulphoaluminate: 4CaO.3Al2O3. SO3 (C4A3S) ; said calcium<br>
sulphoaluminate based cements, exhibit an accelerated<br>
development of initial strengths compared to Portland<br>
cement, due to C4A3S hydration to form ettingite. Examples<br>
of this current are United States application No. 6,149,724<br>
to Poo Ulibarri et al, granted to CEMEX in 2000, or the<br>
Canadian application No. 21933 9 and European application<br>
No. 0 812 811.<br>
In 1994, United States of America application No.<br>
5,356,472 "Portland cement clinker and Portland cement", to<br>
Ivan Odler, discloses a method for manufacturing gray-<br>
clinkers under low forming temperatures, for example<br>
between 2102°F- 2462°F, clinker was formed by C3S, C4A3S and<br>
C4AF phases and practically without C2S and C3A, if to the<br>
raw mix containing CaO, SiO2, A12O3, and Fe2O3 was added an<br>
inorganic additive containing SO3 and other inorganic<br>
additive containing fluorine and strengths of cement<br>
obtained were comparable to the conventional gray Portland<br>
cement, when cement was prepared with a clinker of a 8 0%<br>
C3S, 10% C4A3S and 10% C4AF composition.<br>
However, any document of the prior art is related<br>
to the main object of the present invention, which is to<br>
produce a family of mineralogical compositions of white<br>
clinkers, formed by C3S, C2S, C4A3S, C3A, C11A7.CaF2, CS<br>
phases, without the presence of C4AF, with a high capacity<br>
of fixing sulfur coming from pet-coke as a sulfur source<br>
and which enables the use of a high sulfur content fuels (&gt;<br>
5% S) , using the conventional infrastructure of cement<br>
plants, for the production of white portland cements with<br>
compression strength similar or even greater to the<br>
conventional white Portland cement strength.<br>
Therefore, it is an objective of the present<br>
invention to provide new clinker and white portland cement<br>
compositions with high capacity of fixing sulfur coming<br>
from pet-coke with a high sulfur content, used as fuel.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to<br>
provide new clinker and white Portland cement compositions<br>
exhibiting low fuel consumption on its manufacturing<br>
process and having fast setting developing increased<br>
compression initial strengths.<br>
It is further another object of the present<br>
invention to provide new clinker and white portland cement<br>
compositions using the conventional cement Plants<br>
infrastructure.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is related to a new<br>
family of white portland cement clinker<br>
compositions, with a high capacity of fixing sulfur<br>
coming from pet-coke with a high sulfur content,<br>
used as a fuel, and with white portland cement<br>
properties thus obtained. White portland cement<br>
clinker of the present invention comprises the<br>
amounts of clinker phases in percentage by weight,<br>
as follows: from 40 to 75% of C3S, from 10 to 35% of<br>
C2S, from 0 to 15% of C3A, without C4AF, from 0 to<br>
10% of Cs, from 2 to 15% of C4A3S, from 0 to 5 of<br>
C11A7.CaF2, %CaF2 total from 0.3 to 1.5 measured as<br>
CaF2, %Fe2O3 from 0 to 0.5%; and a content of SO3<br>
between 1.5 and 5% by weight obtained through a raw<br>
meal calcination mainly containing CaO, SiO2, Al2O3,<br>
y CaF2, using pet-coke as fuel with a sulfur content<br>
higher than 5%, at temperatures ranging between<br>
2192 and 2462°F, without the addition of any<br>
additive containing SO3 to the raw meal.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is related to a new<br>
family of white portland cement clinker<br>
compositions based on factors such as, alite (C3S)<br>
formation temperatures and calcium sulphoaluminate<br>
(C4A3s) decomposition; the use of high sulfur<br>
content organic fuels that provide cement clinker a<br>
SO3 content of 1.5 to 5% by weight; and sintering<br>
temperature reduction. It is widely known that<br>
alite formation temperature for a Portland cement<br>
clinker is approximately of 2516°F, while calcium<br>
sulphoaluminate decomposition temperature for a<br>
white portland cement clinker is approximately<br>
2462°F. Taking into account these criteria among<br>
others, inventors have discovered that a new family<br>
of white portland cement clinker compositions can<br>
be obtained through the use of adequate<br>
mineralogical phases (C3S, C2S, C3A, CS , C4A3S and<br>
C11A7.CaF2) of cement clinker and through the<br>
reduction of sintering temperature, using a high<br>
sulfur content organic source, without having<br>
problems associated to the use of said organic<br>
source as fuel (for example, high sulfur content<br>
pet-coke) which has a sulfur content higher than<br>
5% .<br>
White portland cement, prepared from the<br>
above described clinker by fixing sulfur supplied<br>
mainly by high sulfur content pet-coke (&gt;5% S) , in<br>
the form of calcium sulphoaluminate, C4A3s, exhibits<br>
an excellent increase in the compression strength,<br>
particularly it exhibits an accelerated development<br>
of initial strengths, specially curing the interval<br>
from 1 to 3 days. It is specifically referred to<br>
the illustrative embodiments as follows:<br>
Total content of SO3 in cement shall be<br>
between 3 an 10% by weight obtained through the raw<br>
meal calcination containing CaO, SiO2, Al2O3 and<br>
CaF2, using pet-coke as fuel, with a sulfur content<br>
higher than 5%, without the addition of any<br>
additive containing SO3 in the raw meal.<br>
A white Portland cement clinker can include<br>
the following amounts from the clinker phases in %<br>
by weight:<br>
3CaO.SiO2 (C3S): 4O to 75,<br>
2CaO.SiO2 (C3S): 10 to 35,<br>
3CaO.Al2O3 (C3A): 0 to 15,<br>
CaO.SO2 (Cs): 0 to 10,<br>
4CaO.3Al2O3 . SO3 (C4A3s): 2 to 15,<br>
HCaO. 7A12O3 . CaF2 (C11A7.CaF2) : 0 to 5,<br>
Total %CaF2: 0.3 to 1.5 measured as CaF2,<br>
%Fe2O3: 0 to 0.5,<br>
And a SO3 content between 1.5 and 5% by<br>
weight. Clinker is obtained through a raw meal<br>
calcination containing CaO, SiO2, A12O3 and CaF2,<br>
using pet-coke as fuel with a sulfur content higher<br>
than 5% at temperatures between 2192°F to 2462°F<br>
without the addition of any additive containing SO3<br>
to the raw meal.<br>
A cement clinker with percentages by weight<br>
of the following clinker phases is preferred.<br>
C3S: 40 to 75,<br>
 C2S: 10 to 35,<br>
Cs: 0 to 10,<br>
C4A3S: 5 to 15,<br>
CnA7.CaF2: 2 to 5,<br>
Total %CaF2: 0.3 to 1.5 measured as CaF2,<br>
%Fe2O3: 
In another embodiment of the present<br>
invention, a cement clinker with percentages by-<br>
weight of the following clinker phases is more<br>
preferred:<br>
C3S: 40 to 75,<br>
C2S: 10 to 35,<br>
CS: 0 to 10,<br>
C4A3S: 5 to 15,<br>
Total %CaF2: 0.3 to 1.5 measured as CaF2,<br>
%Fe2O3: 
Yet in another embodiment of the present<br>
invention, a cement clinker with percentages by-<br>
weight of the following clinker phases is more<br>
preferred:<br>
C3S: 40 to 75,<br>
C2S: 10 to 35,<br>
C3A: 5 to 15,<br>
CS: 0 to 10,<br>
C4A3S: 2 to 10,<br>
Total %CaF2: 0.3 to 1.5 measured as CaF2,<br>
%Fe2O3: 
Clinker calcination can be controlled to<br>
produce specific amounts of C2S and C3A phases, such<br>
as the addition of C2S and C3A clinker phases, and<br>
must be higher or equal to 10% by weight.<br>
Preferably C3A clinker phase is absent.<br>
Clinker phase forming is eased through CaF2<br>
percentage which is about 0.3 to 1.5 measured as<br>
CaF2 in the raw meal. The preferred range is between<br>
0.2 and 1.0% measured as CaF2 in the raw meal.<br>
A preferred SO3 content in the clinker can<br>
be indicated as 1.5 to 5% by weight, mainly<br>
supplied through the organic fuel such as pet-coke<br>
with a sulfur % higher than 5%. However, it is also<br>
possible to optionally complement the S03 content in<br>
the clinker with another inorganic sources selected<br>
from the group consisting of plaster, anhydrite or<br>
industrial debris containing sulfur.<br>
Corresponding calcium sulphate can be used<br>
to prepare finished white Portland cement.<br>
To optimize setting reaction, according to<br>
an embodiment, it is suggested that the clinker be<br>
grinded in a specific area of 465 to 775 in2/g<br>
measured according to the ASTM C-204 standard<br>
through Blaine.<br>
Forming a sulfur-rich phase, calcium<br>
sulphoaluminate: 4CaO. 3A12O3. SO3 (C4A3S), shows an<br>
accelerated development of initial strength<br>
compared to those of Portland cement, due to C4A3S<br>
hydration to form ettingite. Therefore, cements<br>
according to the present invention with C4A3s<br>
contents under 15% by weight, do not practically<br>
exhibit any expansion, for which, said cement has<br>
an initial strength exceeding that of a common<br>
Portland cement.<br>
On the other hand, during the clinker<br>
calcination of the present invention, less melted<br>
phase is formed (which is also due to the low<br>
temperature of calcination), which drives to a<br>
relatively porous clinker, in return, the clinker<br>
has a better grinding capacity, and grinding costs<br>
are reduced to the same specific area.<br>
Particularly, another relevant advantage of the<br>
clinker herein, is that alite and belite crystals<br>
sizes are less than 25 micrometers, which provides<br>
better grinding easiness than the conventional<br>
white Portland cement clinker.<br>
Clinker has a free lime percentage less<br>
than 1.5%, this is, it shows a free lime content<br>
similar to that of a white Portland cement clinker,<br>
but sintered at 392°F under the traditional white<br>
Portland clinker sintering temperature.<br>
The present invention will be better<br>
explained in detail based upon several examples.<br>
However, following examples are provided only for<br>
illustrative purposes, and it is not intended to<br>
limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Sample 1 describes a cement free of C3A,<br>
but comprises a 9% by weight of C4A3s and 4% by<br>
weight of CuA7.CaF2.<br>
Sample 2 describes a cement free of C3A and<br>
C11A7.CaF2, but comprising a 12% by weight of C4A3s.<br>
Sample 3 describes a cement free of<br>
C11A7.CaF2, but comprising a 7% by weight of C3A and<br>
3% by weight of C4A3S.<br>
Percentages from other clinker phases, SO3<br>
content in clinker, selected calcination<br>
temperature, as well as the total of SO3 in cement<br>
are shown in the table below, including compression<br>
strength values measured after 1,3,7 and 28 days.<br>
To illustrate the advantages that can be<br>
obtained with cement of the present invention, a<br>
conventional Portland cement, calcined at 2642°F,<br>
is also shown as sample 4.<br>
Data show that sample 2, according to the<br>
present invention, exhibits a significant increase<br>
on compression strength at all ages and samples 1<br>
and 3, show comparable strength to those developed<br>
by sample 4 which is the reference of white<br>
Portland cement and calcined at 2642°F. Besides,<br>
white portland cement of the present invention has<br>
initial setting time from 10 to 45 minutes,<br>
measured according to the ASTM C-191 standard<br>
through Vicat.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of<br>
the present invention, white portland cement<br>
comprising clinker, which can be mixed with other<br>
materials such as limestone, slag, fly ash and/or<br>
puzolanic materials.<br>
Even when certain embodiment of the present<br>
invention has been illustrated and described, it<br>
should be noted that numerous possible<br>
modifications can be made. The present invention,<br>
therefore, shall not be considered as limited<br>
