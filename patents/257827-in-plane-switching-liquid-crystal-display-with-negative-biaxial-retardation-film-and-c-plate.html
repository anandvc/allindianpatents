BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to liquid crystal displays (LCDs), and more particularly, to an in-plane switching liquid crystal display (IPS-LCD) filled with liquid crystals having positive dielectric anisotropy ( &gt; 0) or negative dielectric anisotropy ( 
Background Art<br>
IPS-LCDs are disclosed in US Patent No. 3,807, 831, but this patent does not disclose the use of viewing-angle compensation films. IPS-LCDs including no viewing-angle compensation films have a disadvantage in that they have a low contrast ratio due to a relatively large light leakage in the dark state at inclination angle.<br>
Details regarding Co-pending Application<br>
The Patent entitled "In-Plane Switching Liquid Crystal Display Comprising Compensation Film For Angular Field Of View Using Positive Biaxial Retardation Film" via Application No. 728/DEL/2005 filed on February 13,2005.<br>
This invention relates to a liquid crystal display (LCD), and more particularly to an in-plane switching liquid crystal display (IPS-LCD) including a compensation film, which uses a positive biaxial retardation film while adjusting an optical axis direction and a retardation value<br>
of the positive biaxial retardation film in order to improve a viewing angle characteristic of the in-plane switching liquid crystal display having a liquid crystal cell filled with liquid crystal of positive dielectric anisotropy negative dielectric anisotropy ( 
Electrodes of an IPS-LCD are aligned in such a manner that an electric field is applied in parallel to a liquid crystal plane of the IPS-LCD. Surfaces of a liquid crystal layer adjacent to two substrates have pretilt angles in a range of 0° to 5° as disclosed in U. S. Patent No. 6, 078, 375. An IPS panel (liquid crystal cell) has an active matrix drive electrode comprising a pair of electrodes aligned in the same plane. In addition, the active matrix drive electrode provides IPS (In-Plain Switching), S-IPS (Super-In-Plain Switching) and FFS (Fringe Field Switching) modes to a liquid crystal layer formed between two glass substrates. According to the S-IPS mode, a two-domain liquid crystal alignment can be obtained by forming a zig-zag type electrode pattern, so an IPS color shift in a white state (Bright State) may be minimized.<br>
The IPS-LCD is disclosed in U. S. Patent No. 3,807, 831. However, the IPS-LCD disclosed in U. S. Patent No. 3,807, 831 does not use a compensation film. Accordingly, the IPS-LCD represents a low contrast ratio at a predetermined inclination angle due to a relatively great amount of light leakage.<br>
U. S. Patent No. 5,189, 538 discloses an LCD including two kinds of retardation films, such as a +A-plate and a positive biaxial retardation film, but it does not disclose information or technologies about the IPS-LCD.<br>
U. S. Patent No. 5,440, 413 discloses a TN-LCD having two positive biaxial retardation films in order to improve the contrast characteristic and color characteristic of the TN- LCD at a predetermined inclination angle.<br>
An IPS-LCD compensation film using one positive biaxial retardation film is disclosed in U. S. Patent No. 6,285,430. Characteristics of the IPS-LCD are as follows:<br>
-	One positive biaxial retardation film is aligned between a polarizer plate and a liquid crystal layer.<br>
-	An in-plane retardation value of the biaxial retardation film is about 190nm to 390nm.<br>
-	An in-plane retardation value of the biaxial retardation film increases in proportional to an absolute value of a retardation in a direction of thickness of a polarizer plate protection film.<br>
A main object of using the biaxial retardation film is to improve a contrast characteristic of the IPS-LCD at an inclination angle in all azimuthal angles, especially 45°, 135°, 225° and 315°. Although the contrast characteristic of the IPS-LCD can be improved at the above azimuthal angles, the IPS-LCD in a black state represents a great amount of light leakage at other azimuthal angles. For this reason, a contrast ratio of the IPS-LCD is relatively reduced at other azimuthal angles. Therefore, the above IPS-LCD has a disadvantage in that the IPS-LCD represents a relatively low contrast ratio at specific azimuthal angles due to relatively great light leakage in the black state.<br>

Disclosure of the Invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide an IPS-LCD, which has high-contrast characteristics and low color shift at the front side and inclination angle by minimizing light leakage in the dark state at inclination angle.<br>
The causes of reducing the viewing-angle characteristics of IPS-LCDs are broadly classified into two classes: The first is the viewing-angle dependence of a perpendicularity between the absorption axes of two polarizers, and the second is the viewing-angle dependence of birefringent characteristics of an IPS-LCD panel.<br>
The present inventors have recognized that a negative biaxial retardation film and a positive C-plate are required to compensate for these two causes of reducing viewing angle, and designed viewing-angle compensation films with these two kinds of the retardation compensation films in order to realize wide-viewing-angle characteristics.<br>
Moreover, the present inventors have found that, for suitable compensation for viewing angle, the optical axis direction of the negative biaxial retardation film should be suitably determined depending on the arrangement order of the negative biaxial retardation film and the positive C-plate between polarizers and a liquid crystal cell (IPS-LCD panel). On the basis of this finding, the present invention has been completed.<br>
The present invention provides an IPS-LCD which overcame the viewing-angle problem using the negative biaxial retardation film and the positive C-plate.<br>
More specifically, the present invention provides an in-plane switching liquid crystal display (IPS-LCD) comprising a first polarizer, a horizontally aligned liquid crystal cell filled with liquid crystals having positive dielectric anisotropy (Ae &gt; 0) or negative dielectric anisotropy (Ae  ny &gt; nz) and at least one positive C-plate (nx = ny 
negative biaxial retardation film, or (b) the absorption axis of the polarizer adjacent to the liquid crystal cell when the negative biaxial retardation film is adjacent to the liquid crystal cell.<br>
Contrast ratio value is the index of image sharpness, and the higher the contrast ratio value, the more sharp images can be realized. IPS-LCDs have the most inferior contrast characteristic at an inclination angle of 70°, and an improvement in the contrast characteristic at an inclination angle of 70° means an improvement in the contrast characteristics at all viewing-angles. The minimum contrast ratio at an inclination angle of 70° is less than 10: 1 in the use of only polarizers, and can reach at least 20: 1 when the positive C-plate and the negative biaxial retardation film are used according to the present invention. The minimum contrast ratio at an inclination angle of 70° is preferably more than 20: 1.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in detail.<br>
FIG. 1 shows the fundamental structure of IPS-LCDs. As shown in FIG. 1, an IPS-LCD comprises the first polarizer 1, the second polarizer 2 and the liquid crystal cell 3. The absorption axis 4 of the first polarizer and the absorption axis 5 of the second polarizer are arranged perpendicularly to each other, and the absorption axis 4 of the first polarizer and the optical axis of the liquid crystal cell are arranged parallel to each other. FIG. 2 shows the absorption axes 4, 5 of the two polarizers and the optical axis 6 of the liquid crystal cell.<br>
The liquid crystal display including the compensation films according to the present invention comprises the first polarizer 1, a horizontally aligned liquid crystal cell 3 having liquid<br>
crystals with positive dielectric anisotropy ( &gt; 0) or negative dielectric anisotropy ( 
The retardation value of the liquid crystal cell (IPS- LCD panel) in the inventive IPS-LCD preferably ranges from 200 nm to 350 nm at a wavelength of 550 nm.<br>
This is because the retardation value of the IPS-LCD panel must be half of a wavelength of 589 nm (the brightest monochromatic light felt by people) such that the light linearly polarized to 90° through the first polarizer is linearly polarized to 0° through the liquid crystal layer upon the application of voltage to the IPS-LCD panel, thus becoming the bright state. Also, to make the light white, the retardation value of the IPS-LCD panel may be slightly longer or shorter than the half-wavelength, depending on the wavelength dispersion characteristics of the used liquid crystals. For this reason, the retardation value is preferably about 295 nm which is the half-wavelength of 598- nm monochromatic light.<br>
The inventive LCDs include one where liquid crystals are either aligned in multi-domains or divided into multi-domains by applied voltage.<br>
LCDs are classified according to the mode of active matrix derive electrodes into in-plane-switching (IPS), super-in-plane-switching (Super-IPS), and fringe-field- switching (FFS) LCDs.<br>
In the specification, if the term "IPS-LCD" is used, it will be construed to include super-IPS, FFS<br>
(fringe field switching), reverse TN IPS LCDs, etc.<br>
The present invention is characterized by using the positive C-plate and the negative biaxial<br>
retardation film in combination for the viewing-angle compensation of IPS-LCDs.<br>
If the positive C-plate and the negative biaxial retardation film are used in combination for the<br>
viewing-angle compensation of IPS-LCDs, it will be possible to realize wide-viewing-angle<br>
characteristics.<br>
The total sum of the thickness-direction retardation values of the positive C-plate and the adjacent negative biaxial retardation film is positive value, and the in-plane retardation value of the biaxial retardation film functions as an A-plate. Thus, light leakage generated in the polarizers and the IPS-LCD panel can be minimized.<br>
The refractive index of the retardation films used for the viewing-angle compensation of IPS-LCDs will now be described with reference to FIG. 3. As shown in FIG. 3, among in-plane refractive indexes, the refractive index in the x-axis direction may be referred to as nx 8, the refractive index in the y-axis direction as ny 9, and the refractive index in the thickness direction (i. e. , the z-axis direction) as nz 10. Depending on the magnitudes of the refractive indexes, the characteristics of the retardation films will be determined.<br>
A film where the refractive indexes in the two-axis directions among the refractive indexes in the three-axis directions are different from each other is referred to as an uniaxial film. The uniaxial film can be defined as follows.<br>
(1) A film with nx &gt; ny = nz is referred to as a positive A-plate, the in-plane retardation<br>
value of which is defined using the difference between two refractive indexes lying in a plane, and the thickness of the film as given in the following equation 1.<br>
(Equation 1)<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
wherein d represents the thickness of the film.<br>
(2) A film with nx = ny 
retardation value of which is defined using the difference between the in-plane refractive index<br>
and the thickness-direction refractive index, and the thickness of the film as given in the<br>
following equation.<br>
(Equation 2)<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
wherein d represents the thickness of the film.<br>
The positive C-plate is a film whose in-plane retardation value is almost zero and thickness-direction retardation is positive value.<br>
The thickness-direction retardation value of the positive C-plate which is used for the viewing-angle compensation of IPS-LCDs preferably ranges from 50nm to 500 nm at a wavelength of 550 nm.<br>
A positive thickness-direction retardation value is required to minimize the light transmitted in the dark state of the polarizers. However, if a negative biaxial retardation film is used, there will be no positive thickness-direction retardation value. Thus, the positive C- plate needs to be used either to reduce the negative thickness-direction retardation value or to make it positive. The range of thickness-direction retardation value allowing the viewing-angle compensation of the polarizers and the IPS- LCD panel is 50 nm to 500 nm, and this range is required either to reduce the negative thickness-direction retardation value or to make it positive.<br><br>
The wavelength dispersion characteristics of films may have normal wavelength dispersion, flat wavelength dispersion, or reverse wavelength dispersion.<br>
A film whose refractive indexes in the three-axis directions are different from each other is referred to as a biaxial retardation film which is defined as follows.<br>
Of in-plane refractive indexes, the refractive index in the x-axis direction is referred to as nx 8, the refractive index in the y-axis direction as ny 9, and the refractive index in the thickness direction as nz 10. A film with nx &gt; ny &gt; nz is referred to as a negative biaxial retardation film. The negative biaxial retardation film has both in-plane retardation value (Rin, biaxial) and thickness-direction retardation value (Rth, biaxial) which are defined as follows:<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
wherein d represents the thickness of the film.<br>
For the viewing-angle compensation of IPS-LCDs, the negative biaxial retardation film preferably has an in-plane retardation value ranging from 20 nm to 200 nm at a wavelength of 550 nm, and a negative thickness-direction retardation value ranging from -50 nm to -300 nm at a wavelength of 550 nm.<br>
The wavelength dispersion characteristics of the film may have normal wavelength dispersion, flat wavelength dispersion and reverse wavelength dispersion.<br>
The structures of the viewing-angle compensation films including the positive C-plate and the negative biaxial retardation film are shown in shown in FIGS. 4, 5,6 and 7.<br>
The optical axis of the liquid crystal molecules 7 in the liquid crystal cell 3 sandwiched between the two crossed polarizers is arranged parallel to the IPS-LCD panel substrate, and is aligned in the rubbing direction. An IPS- LCD where the absorption axis 4 of the first polarizer adjacent to a backlight is parallel to the rubbing direction 6 is referred to as an O-mode IPS-LCD, and an IPS-LCD where the absorption axis of the polarizer adjacent to the backlight is perpendicular to the rubbing direction 6 is referred to as an E-mode IPS-LCD. The first polarizer 1 adjacent to the backlight is referred to as a lower polarizer, and the second polarizer 2 arranged away from the backlight is referred to as an upper polarizer. Absorption axes of the two polarizers are so arranged as to be crossed with each other.<br>
In order to function to compensate for viewing angle, the two kinds of the retardation films need to be placed between the IPS-LCD panel 3 and the polarizers.<br>
The slow axis or optical axis 13 of the retardation films may be arranged perpendicularly or in parallel to the absorption axis 5 of the polarizer adjacent thereto. The direction of the optical axis of the retardation films is determined depending on the arrangement order of the retardation films.<br>
In order to use the A-plate for the viewing-angle compensation of the polarizers, the optical axis of the A- plate should be so arranged as to coincide with the transmission axis of the polarizer. If the positive C-plate is adjacent to the polarizer, the optical axis of the A-plate should be perpendicular with the absorption axis of the polarizer placed away from the A-plate, and if the A plate is adjacent to the polarizer, it should be perpendicular to the polarizer adjacent thereto.<br>
Meanwhile, among the two kinds of the retardation films which are used for the viewing-angle compensation of IPS-LCDs, the first retardation film is referred to as the negative biaxial retardation film 12, and the second retardation film is referred to as the positive C-plate 11. When the two kinds of the retardation films are stacked on each other, the absolute value of the thickness-direction retardation of the second retardation film is preferably larger than that of the first retardation film as given in the following relation:<br>
(Rth) positive C-plate &gt; ⌠ R-biaxial ⌠<br>
This is because it is preferred that the total sum of the thickness-direction retardation values of the compensation films is positive value in order to improve the viewing-angle characteristics of IPS-LCDs. The above condition means that the total sum of the thickness-direction retardation values of the compensation films should be positive value.<br>
A first embodiment of the present invention provides an IPS-LCD device, in which the negative biaxial retardation film 12 and the positive C-plate 11 are arranged between the liquid crystal cell 3 and the second polarizer 2, the positive C-plate is arranged between the negative biaxial retardation film 12 and the liquid crystal cell 3, and the optical axis 13 of the negative biaxial retardation film is perpendicular to the absorption axis 5 of the adjacent second polarizer 13.<br>
The minimization of light leakage by the crossed polarizers is possible only when the optical axis of the A- plate and the transmission axis of the adjacent polarizer coincide with each other. Since the absorption axis of the polarizers makes a right angle with the transmission axis,<br>
the optical axis of the negative biaxial retardation film and the absorption axis of the adjacent second polarizer should make a right angle with respect to each other.<br>
In this embodiment, the positive C-plate preferably has a thickness-direction retardation value ranging from 50 nm to 500 nm at a wavelength of 550 nm.<br>
The thickness-direction retardation value of negative biaxial retardation films which can be fabricated at the present time ranges from -50 nm to -300 nm. Thus, the positive C-plate is needed for the total sum of the thickness-direction retardation values to have positive value, because it is preferred for the viewing-angle compensation of IPS-LCDs that the total sum of the thickness-direction retardation values ranges from +50 nm to +300 nm.<br>
Moreover, the in-plane retardation value of the negative biaxial retardation film required for the viewing-angle compensation of IPS-LCDs is preferably less than 150 nm.<br>
The first structure of IPS-LCD shown in FIG. 4, which has the compensation films, will be described as follows.<br>
As shown in FIG. 4, the negative biaxial retardation film and the positive C-plate are arranged between the second polarizer 2 and the liquid crystal cell 3 in such a way that the negative biaxial retardation film is adjacent to the second polarizer 2. The optical axis 13 of the negative biaxial retardation film is so arranged as to be perpendicular to the absorption axis 5 of the second polarizer.<br>
A backlight should be arranged adjacent to the first polarizer, and if the backlight is arranged adjacent to the second polarizer, the viewing-angle compensation characteristics will vary.<br>
Simulations on this' arrangement were performed while applying the actual design values of retardation films, and the results are shown in Table 1 below.<br>
(Table 1)<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The viewing-angle characteristics of the IPS-LCD are determined depending on how the internal protective films for the polarizers, and the retardation values of the positive C- plate and the negative biaxial retardation film, are designed.<br><br>
Table 1 above summarizes the results of simulation for viewing-angle characteristics according to the internal protective film for the first polarizer, the retardation value of the positive C-plate, the retardation value of the negative biaxial retardation film, and the internal protective film for the second polarizer. Since IPS-LCDs show low-contrast characteristics at an inclination angle of 70°, the minimum contrast ratio at an inclination angle of 70° is an index indicating the extent of an improvement in contrast characteristics. IPS-LCDs including general polarizers, to which the viewing-angle compensation films have not been applied, have a minimum contrast ratio of less than 10: 1 at an inclination angle of 70°. Accordingly, it can be found that the structures given in Table 1 all have an improvement in contrast characteristics, and among these results, the structure showing the highest contrast ratio is a structure showing the most excellent contrast characteristic.<br>
A second embodiment of the present invention provides an IPS-LCD device, in which the negative biaxial retardation film 12 and the positive C-plate 11 are arranged between the liquid crystal cell 3 and the second polarizer 2, the negative biaxial retardation film is arranged between the positive C-plate and the liquid crystal cell, and the optical axis 13 of the negative biaxial retardation film is parallel to the absorption axis 5 of the second polarizer.<br>
For the viewing-angle compensation of IPS-LCDs, the optical axis of the negative biaxial retardation film should be perpendicular to the absorption axis of the adjacent polarizer. However, due to the positive C-plate next to the second polarizer, the negative biaxial retardation film is influenced by the first polarizer.<br>
Accordingly, the optical axis of the negative biaxial retardation film should be perpendicular to the absorption axis of the first polarizer and coincided with the absorption axis of the second polarizer.<br>
The second structure of the IPS-LCD as shown in FIG. 5, which has the compensation films, will be described as follows.<br>
As shown in FIG. 5, the negative biaxial retardation film and the positive C-plate are arranged between the second polarizer 2 and the IPS-liquid crystal cell 3 in such a manner that the positive C-plate is adjacent to the second polarizer 2. The optical axis 13 of the negative biaxial retardation film is arranged parallel to the absorption axis of the second polarizer. Simulations on this arrangement were performed while applying the actual design values of the retardation films, and the results are shown in Table 2 below.<br>
(Table 2)<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Table 2 above shows the results of simulation for contrast characteristics at an inclination angle of 70° according to the retardation values of the internal protective films for the polarizers,<br>
the retardation value of the positive C-plate, and the retardation value of the negative biaxial retardation film.<br>
IPS-LCDs show the minimum contrast ratio at an inclination angle of 70°, and IPS-LCDs having general polarizers, to which the compensation plates have not been applied, show a contrast ratio of less than 10: 1 at an inclination angle of 70°. Accordingly, an improvement in contrast characteristics at an inclination angle of 70°, as shown in Table 2, means an improvement in contrast characteristics in all the viewing-angle directions.<br>
A third embodiment of the present invention provides an IPS-LCD device, in which the negative biaxial retardation film 12 and the first positive C-plate 11 are arranged between the second polarizer 2 and the liquid crystal cell 3, the second positive C-plate 14 is arranged between the first polarizer 1 and the liquid crystal cell 3, the first positive C-plate 11 is arranged between the negative biaxial retardation film 12 and the liquid crystal cell 3, and the optical axis 13 of the negative biaxial retardation film is perpendicular to the absorption axis 5 of the adjacent second polarizer.<br>
For the viewing-angle compensation of IPS-LCDs, the optical axis of the negative biaxial retardation film should coincide with the transmission axis of the adjacent polarizer. Since the transmission axis of the polarizer is perpendicular to the absorption axis thereof, the optical axis of the negative biaxial retardation film should be perpendicular to the absorption axis of the polarizer.<br>
In this embodiment, the negative biaxial retardation film preferably has an in-plane retardation value ranging from 20 nm to 200 nm and a thickness-direction retardation value ranging from -50 nm to -300 nm. The total sum of the thickness-direction retardation values of the first and second positive C-plates preferably ranges from 50 nm to 500 nm.<br>
Furthermore, the total sum of the thickness-direction retardation values of the two positive C-plates should be larger than the thickness-direction retardation value of the negative biaxial retardation film.<br>
The third structure of the IPS-LCD as shown in FIG. 6, which has the compensation films, will be described as follows.<br>
As shown in FIG. 6, the negative biaxial retardation film and the first positive C-plate 11 are arranged between the second polarizer 2 and the IPS-liquid crystal cell 3, and the negative biaxial retardation film 12 is arranged adjacent to the second polarizer 2. The optical axis 13 of the negative biaxial retardation film is arranged perpendicularly to the absorption axis 5 of the second polarizer. The second positive C-plate is arranged between the first polarizer 1 and the IPS-LCD panel 3.<br>
Simulations on this arrangement were performed while applying the actual design values of the retardation films, and the results are shown in Table 3 below.<br>
(Table 3)<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Table 3 above summarizes the results of simulation for the minimum contrast ratio at an inclination angle of 70°according to the retardation value of the internal protective film for the first polarizer, the retardation value of the internal protective films for the second polarizer, the retardation value of the first positive C-plate, the retardation value of the second positive C-plate, and the retardation value of the negative biaxial retardation film.<br>
A fourth embodiment of the present invention provides an IPS-LCD device, in which the negative biaxial retardation film 12 and the first positive C-plate 11 are arranged between the second polarizer 2 and the liquid crystal cell 3, the second positive C-plate 14 is arranged between the first polarizer 1 and the liquid crystal cell 3, the first positive C-plate 11 is arranged between the negative biaxial retardation film 12 and the second polarizer 2, and the optical axis 13 of the negative biaxial retardation film is parallel to the absorption axis 5 of the second polarizer.<br>
In order to improve the viewing-angle characteristics of IPS-LCDs, the optical axis of the negative biaxial retardation film should be perpendicular to the absorption axis of the adjacent polarizer. As shown in FIG. 7, since the positive C-plate is arranged between the second polarizer and the negative biaxial retardation film, the negative biaxial retardation film acts with the first polarizer, and it is needed that the optical axis of the negative biaxial retardation film coincides with the transmission axis of the first polarizer. Also, since the transmission axis of the first polarizer coincides with the absorption axis of the second polarizer, the optical axis of the negative biaxial retardation film should coincide with the absorption axis of the second polarizer.<br>
The fourth structure of the IPS-LCD as shown in FIG. 7, which has the compensation films, will be described as follows.<br>
The negative biaxial retardation film and the first positive C-plate are arranged between the second polarizer 2 and the IPS-liquid crystal cell 3, and the first positive C- plate is arranged adjacent to the second polarizer 2. The optical axis 13 of the negative biaxial retardation film is arranged parallel to the absorption axis 5 of the second polarizer. The second positive C-plate is arranged between the first polarizer 1 and the IPS-liquid crystal cell 3.<br>
Simulations on this arrangement were performed while applying the actual design values of retardation films, and the results are shown in Table 4 below.<br>
(Table 4)<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The IPS-LCDs shown in FIGS. 4 to 7 comprise the two crossed polarizers 1, 2, the liquid cell 3, and at least one positive C-plate 11 and at least one negative biaxial retardation film 12 arranged between the second polarizer 2 and the liquid crystal cell 3.<br>
The diagonal direction refers to the 45° direction with respect to the absorption axes of the polarizers, and is a direction in which the viewing-angle characteristics of IPS- LCDs in the state of the crossed polarizers are most poor. When the two kinds of the retardation films are applied as viewing-angle compensation films for IPS-LCDs according to the present invention, the viewing-angle characteristics in the diagonal direction will be improved.<br>
In the present invention, the polarizers may have internal and external protective films.<br>
In order to protect a polarizing element made of stretched polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), the polarizers may comprise, as an internal protective film, triacetate cellulose (TAC) with thickness-direction retardation value, polynorbornene (PNB) or unstreched cyclo-olefin (COP) with no thickness-direction retardation value.<br>
The viewing-angle compensation characteristics of IPS- LCDS are influenced by the protective film which is used for the protection of the polarizing element. If a protective film having thickness-direction retardation value, such as a TAC film, there will be a problem in that the viewing-angle compensation characteristics are deteriorated. If an isotropic film, such as an unstreched cyclo-olefin (COP), is used as a protective film for the polarizers, excellent viewing-angle compensation characteristics can be secured.<br>
As the internal protective film for the first polarizer, the second polarizer or both the two polarizers, a film having a zero or negative thickness-direction retardation value is preferably used. This is because the positive C- plate adjacent to the polarizer offsets the retardation value generated by the internal protective film for the polarizer.<br>
Meanwhile, the internal protective films for the first polarizer 1 and the second polarizer 2 is preferably made of a material selected from the group consisting of unstretched COP, 40-µm TAC, 80 µm-TAC, and PNB.<br>
Examples of a film which can be used as the negative biaxial retardation film 12 include uniaxially stretched TAC, uniaxially stretched polynorborene (PNB), and biaxially stretched polycarbonate films. The positive C-plate 11 as the second retardation film may be made of a polymer material or an UV curable liquid crystal film, and examples thereof include a homeotropically aligned liquid crystal film, a biaxially stretched polycarbonate film, and the like.<br>
In the present invention, the negative biaxial retardation film 12 can serve as an internal protective film for the polarizers. Since the purpose of the internal protective film for the polarizers is to protect the polarizing element, any transparent material having a function to protect the polarizers may be used as the protective material. Since the negative biaxial retardation film is made of a transparent material having a function to protect the polarizers, it can serve as a retardation film having a function to protect the polarizers.<br>
Moreover, in the present invention, the positive C-plate 11 can serve as a protective film for the polarizers. Since the positive C-plate is made of a transparent material having a function to protect the polarizers, it can serve as a retardation film having a function to protect the polarizers.<br>
A material which is most widely used as a protective film for general polarizers is TAC. Since TAC has negative thickness-direction retardation value, the direct use of the negative biaxial retardation film as a protective film for the polarizers has the effect of reducing the negative thickness-direction retardation value. This allows viewing- angle compensation with a small thickness-direction retardation value of the positive C-plate (see Table 1).<br>
If the internal protective film for the polarizers has negative thickness-direction retardation value, a positive C- plate having a large retardation value should be used to make the total sum of thickness-direction retardation values larger than zero. If the thickness-direction retardation value of the internal protective film for the polarizers is zero or negative, a positive C-plate having a small retardation value may be used to improve viewing-angle characteristics.<br>
