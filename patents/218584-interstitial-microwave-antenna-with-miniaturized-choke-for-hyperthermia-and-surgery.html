INTERSTITIAL MICROWAVE ANTENNA WITH MINIATURIZED CHOKE FOR<br>
HYPERTHERMIA IN MEDICINE AND SURGERY<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to minimally invasive<br>
surgery techniques, for interstitial, percutaneous,<br>
laparoscopic, endoscopic and intrasurgery applications in<br>
medicine and surgery, especially in oncology.<br>
More precisely, it relates to a microwave antenna,<br>
for hyperthermia, operating from 37C up to over 100C, of<br>
the monopole or dipole co-axial type equipped with "trap",<br>
commonly called choke, for blocking the propagation of the<br>
reflecting wave that turns back towards the generator.<br>
Furthermore the invention relates to a method of<br>
construction of such an antenna.<br>
Description of the prior art<br>
Hyperthermia in oncology is method used for over 3 0<br>
years for treatment of cancer (Hahn GM, Hyperthermia and<br>
Cancer, Plenum Prtss, in the York, 1982). It consists in<br>
heating the cancer cells to obtain their necrosis directly<br>
or with additional use of other methods such as<br>
radiotherapy, chemotherapy or other surgery techniques.<br>
For heating tissues, in particular for treatment of<br>
surface lesions, firstly electromagnetic waves have been<br>
used produced by a source located out of the human body.<br>
More recently thin appliances have been used among<br>
which microwave antennas, operating between some hundreds<br>
cf MHz and some thousands of MHz, typically at 2450 MHz,<br>
executed in co-axial tube, for interstitial, percutaneous,<br>
laparoscopic, endoscopic and intrasurgery applications,<br>
suitable to the local treatment of deep lesicns (Iskander<br>
MF &amp; Tumeh AM, Design Optimization of Interstitial<br>
Antennas, IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,<br>
1989, 238-246) .<br>
Such antennas are usually inserted in the lesion to<br>
treat using catheters or metal needles, under echographic<br>
guide, TAG, NMR or other computerised imaging techniques.<br>
They are suitable to be used in association with drugs,<br>
ionizing waves and/or with surgery ablation.<br>
These microwave antennas, normally, are manufactured<br>
using a flexible or semi-rigid co-axial tube, suitably<br>
modified at one end, for conveying microwave power into<br>
the tissues to cause hyperthermia.<br>
In Figure 1 an axial cross section is shown of an<br>
antenna inserted in a biopsy needle 1. The antenna, in its<br>
active portion at the right of the drawing, is suitably<br>
configured as radiating dipole or monopole. More<br>
precisely, 2 is the external conductor of the co-axial<br>
tube, 3 is the dielectric layer that insulates the<br>
external conductor from the central conductor 4. The point<br>
indicated with 7 is the f eedj ng point, i.e. the active<br>
portion of the antenna, commonly called "feed", where the<br>
emitted power, normally, is maximum.<br>
The isothermal surfaces that can be obtained by<br>
heating a biological tissue (not crossed by large blood<br>
vessels) with a normal antenna, that for example is made<br>
by cutting at an end a portion of the external conductor 2<br>
of the co-axial tube and leaving dielectric layer 3<br>
uncovered, as described in Figure 1, have a rotationally<br>
symmetric configuration. Their projection on the plane of<br>
the figure is elliptical, with a central maximum of<br>
transmission, as above said, near feeding point 7 of the<br>
antenna, where the distal portion of the external<br>
conductor 2 of the co-axial tube is cut. The surface of<br>
dotted projection 8 indicates an isothermal surface of the<br>
tissue that is being radiated by this type of antenna in a<br>
purely theoretical case.<br>
Actually, the impedance of the antenna is never<br>
perfectly adapted with that of the medium in which it<br>
operates, owing to the variation of the dielectric<br>
characteristics of the medium same when heating, and for<br>
other reasons connected with the guided propagation of an<br>
electromagnetic wave. During the delivery of microwave<br>
power there is always an backward wave that returns along<br>
the external conductor of the antenna, from the active end<br>
towards the generator, causing an backward elongation of<br>
the heating figure. The dashed curve 9 indicates the<br>
projection of an backwardly elongated isothermal surface<br>
corresponding to this effect. This drawback prevents from<br>
suitably concentrating the heat production near the active<br>
portion of the antenna and is a big limit to the use of<br>
this technique.<br>
Per overcome this drawback normally the antenna is<br>
equipped with a device, called choke, or trap, often used<br>
in radio-broadcasting antennas (see for example Reintjes<br>
JF &amp; Coate GT, Principles of Radar, McGraw-Hill Book<br>
Company, in the York 1952, p 851) that blocks the<br>
backwards propagation of the reflected power.<br>
This device, indicated with 11 in figure 2, consists<br>
in a co-axial guiding portion, ?/4 long, being ? the<br>
wavelength of the emitted waves, obtained by arranging at<br>
an end the external conductor of the co-axial tube of the<br>
antenna, near the feed 7, a short circuit metal tube 12.<br>
In Figure 2, 1 is the needle guide of the antenna, 2 is<br>
the external conductor of the antenna, 3 is the insulating<br>
material and 4 is the central conductor.<br>
In this case the backwards reflecting wave,<br>
indicated with 13, runs the external surface of the<br>
antenna, enters choke 11, reflects itself at its end in a<br>
short circuit and, after a total path of ?/2 is again at<br>
the entrance of the choke but. in phases-opposition with<br>
respect to that that at inlet, with a result of a null<br>
intensity. The isothermal surface that is obtained when<br>
the antenna is equipped with choke 11 is indicated by the<br>
continuous curve 10 of Figure 2.<br>
Actually, as it can be seen, the introduction of the<br>
choke 11 causes a substantial increase of the diameter of<br>
the antenna, and then of needle 1, thus limiting its<br>
applications when a minimum invasive operation is<br>
required, such as for example in out-patient"s<br>
departments, in the repeated treatments, etc.<br>
For manufacturing reasons, and because of the<br>
resistance limits of the material, the radial dimension of<br>
the choke cannot be reduced under certain limits.<br>
Furthermore, in case of change of the dielectric<br>
characteristics of the medium caused by the variation of<br>
the temperature during the treatment, or in case of<br>
variation of the frequency of the antenna, as when a<br>
microwave generator with adjustable frequency, the choke<br>
cannot be lengthened or shortened, in order to be always<br>
about a fourth of the wavelength long. The impedance of<br>
the existing chokes is therefore fixed, whereby the<br>
elimination of the returning wave can not be totally<br>
effective when the operating temperature is changed.<br>
An application of hyperthermia is, furthermore<br>
normally associated to a measure of the local temperature.<br>
In fact, it is necessary for measure the heating<br>
temperature of the cancer lesions, or other lesions to<br>
treat, to preserve the adjacent healthy tissues and for<br>
controlling the actual heating power of the antenna.<br>
Usually, in the operation region a sensor of<br>
temperature is inserted (indicated with 20 in figure 2)<br>
For example, metal thermocouples are used. However, they<br>
cannot be introduced during the delivery of energy by the<br>
antenna, owing to eddy currents in the metal of<br>
thermocouple, that overheats thus affecting the measure.<br>
Furthermore the presence of a thermocouple changes the<br>
distribution of the microwave field, changing the heating<br>
cannot be introduced during the delivery of energy by the<br>
antenna, owing to eddy currents in the metal of<br>
thermocouple, that overheats thus affecting the measure.<br>
Furthermore the presence of a thermocouple changes the<br>
distribution of the microwave field, changing the heating<br>
pattern. Therefore, the temperature measure with a metal<br>
thermocouple must be done with the drawback of stopping<br>
often the delivery of energy. Alternatively, optical-fibre<br>
sensors are known to have no metal and are not affected by<br>
the field or do not perturbate it, but have the drawback<br>
of being expensive and fragile. In both cases of metal<br>
thermocouples or optical-fibre sensors, there is the<br>
further drawback of introducing a further catheter for<br>
guiding the sensor into the operation region.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
It is object of the present invention to provide an<br>
co-axial microwave antenna for applications in medicine<br>
and surgery that is provided with trap, or choke, for<br>
blocking the backwards propagation of the reflecting wave<br>
towards the generator, wherein a miniaturisation of this<br>
trap with respect to the prior art is possible, in order<br>
to allow the use for minimally invasive applications.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to<br>

medium wavelength, allows the choke to be lengthened or<br>
shortened for a more correct operation.<br>

provide an antenna that allows a measure of temperature<br>
operation region.<br>

end portion, the antenna has a plastics sheath that is a<br>
dielectric layer in the choke.<br>
The sheath can be of antiadhesive material and of<br>
length that protrudes from the needle, preventing the<br>
outer portion to adhere to tissues during the high<br>
temperature heating treatment.<br>

Brief description of the drawings<br>
Further characteristics and advantages of the<br>
interstitial microwave antenna and of the method for its<br>
production, according to the present invention, will be<br>
made clearer with the following description of an<br>
embodiment thereof, exemplifying but not limitative, with<br>
reference to the further attached drawings wherein:<br>
- figure 3 shows a sectional axial view of an antenna<br>
second invention;<br>
- figure 4 shows an exploded view of the antenna of<br>
figure 3;<br>
figure 5 shows the antenna of figure 3 to which a<br>
thermocouple is added that crosses the choke and protrudes<br>
into the zone of feed.<br>
Description of a preferred embodiment<br>
In Figure 3 an axial cross section is shown of an<br>
antenna according to the invention inserted in a metal<br>
tube that consists in an biopsy needle 1, for example a 14<br>
Gauge, outer diameter = mm 2.1 needle.<br>
The antenna, in its active portion at the right of<br>
the figure, is a radiating dipole or monopole. More<br>
precisely, the antenna is formed by a co-axial tube having<br>
an external conductor 2, by a dielectric layer 3 and by a<br>
centersl conductor 4 immersed in the dielectric layer 3<br>
that the insulates from the external conductor 2. The<br>
external conductor 2, as well known, end point indicated<br>
with 7, which is the feeding point the active portion of<br>
the antenna, said feed in gergo tecnico, where the emitted<br>
power, normally, is maximum.<br>
According to the invention, is provided a plastics<br>
sheath insulating 5 and a collar metal 6. More precisely,<br>
this result can be obtained:<br>
- saidando on the external conductor of the antenna 2 the<br>
metal collar 6 in a predetermined position,<br>
- by arranging the sheath 5 of plastics that coats the<br>
external conductor 2 in the portion that goes from feed 7<br>
up to collar 6,<br>
- using the wall inner of the same metal needle 1 wherein<br>
the antenna is inserted for containing and guiding the<br>
collar 6 and the sheath 5, in particular, the collar 6<br>
being in electrical contact with the wall inner of the<br>
metal needle 1.<br>
The invention allows to make in a easy and not<br>
expensive way a miniaturized microwave antenna equipped<br>
with choke, suitable for local treatment of deep lesions<br>
in medicine and surgery. In fact, in combination with the<br>
metal needle 1, the collar 6 and the sheath 5 allow to<br>
obtain a choke of variable length and made reducing to the<br>
minimum the increase of the outer diameter of the antenna.<br>
Like the choke of figure 2, in fact, in figure 3 the<br>
wave 13 is reflected back starting from the feed 7 and<br>
runs the external surface of the antenna, enters the choke<br>
formed between the needle 1 and the external conductor 4,<br>
reflects itself on the collar 6 in short circuit and,<br>
after a total X/2 path is again at -he inlet of the choke<br>
in phase opposition with respect to the wave at the inlet,<br>
obtaining a null intensity. The variation of wavelength in<br>
case of temperature rise, or other cause, can be corrected<br>
by varying the position of the collar 6 with respect to<br>
needle 1, so that the choke is always ?/4 long. Within a<br>
certain range the variation of impedance of the antenna<br>
during the operation can be compensated in the same way<br>
changing the length of the choke and then of the portion<br>
between the choke and the feed.<br>
The isothermal surface that is obtained when the<br>
antenna is equipped with the choke according to the<br>
invention is shown also in this case by the dashed curve<br>
axiaJ rube of the antenna, and the inner wall 1 of the<br>
needle guide through which the antenna is inserted.<br>
More precisely, the metal collar 6 keeps the<br>
electrical contact with the inner wall of the needle guide<br>
1 and is thus a mobile by-pass.<br>
Sheath 5 has, then, the following functions:<br>
- is a co-axial wave guide ?/4 long supplying an<br>
effective choke for the antenna,<br>
it is a centering element for the sliding in the<br>
antenna needle,<br>
- in the portion outer to the choke the adhesion of<br>
tissues is avoided during the high temperature heating<br>
treatment, and it does not allow their contact with metal<br>
surfaces different from the needle guide within which the<br>
antenna slides.<br>
With reference to figure 5, according to a different<br>
embodiment of the invention, a thermocouple is provided 21<br>
put through the collar 6 and the sheath 5 that forms the<br>
choke. Thermocouple 21 is in contact with the external<br>
conductor 2 of the co-axial tube that forms the antenna,<br>
and has its sensitive end 22 that comes out from the<br>
sheath 5 protruding into the zone 10 of feed of the<br>
antenna. The other end of thermocouple is connected to the<br>
a temperature measuring instrument not shown by means of a<br>
plug 23.<br>
According to the invention thermocouple 21 does not<br>
affects the operation of the antenna. In fact, the<br>
thermocouple is integral to the metal of the outer co-<br>
axial conductor 2. Therefore, thermocouple 22 is<br>
practically shielded.<br>
Thermocouple 21 can be a common metal thermocouple,<br>
f oirmed by a meta] sheath in which are metal d.i f f erent<br>
conductors are joined at the sensitive end 22. Such a<br>
metal thermocouple not much expensive, much less than in<br>
optical fibre sensors (for example fluoride-optical<br>
sensors) .<br>
A further advantage of thermocouple 21 is that of an<br>
external thermocouple has not to be inserted through an<br>
additional catheter to part and, especially, the measure<br>
can be made directly in the operation region during the<br>
feeding delivery that produces the hyperthermia.<br>
Thermocouple 21 can be put also in hyperthermia<br>
antennas different from that shown in figures from 3 to 5.<br>
The foregoing description of a specific embodiment<br>
will so fully reveal the invention according to the<br>
conceptual point of view, so that others, by applying<br>
current knowledge, will be able to modify and/or adapt for<br>
various applications such an embodiment without further<br>
research and without parting from the invention, and it is<br>
therefore to be understood that such adaptations and<br>
modifications will have to be considered as equivalent to<br>
the specific embodiment. The means and the materials to<br>
realise the different functions described herein could<br>

introduction of the antenna (2,3,4) in the target tissue.<br>
On the external conducter (4) of the antenna (2) a metal<br>
collar (6) is connected in a predetermined position; a<br>
plastics sheath (5) is applied in order to cover the<br>
external conductor (2) in the portion between the feed (7)<br>
and the collar (6); the inner wall of the metal needle (1)<br>
where the antenna is inserted is then used for containing<br>
and guiding the collar (6) and the sheath (5). The collar<br>
(6) is in electrical contact with the inner wall of the<br>
metal needle (1). An antenna is thus obtained with choke of<br>
variable length and with miniaturized diameter.</td>
