GOAL DETECTOR FOR DETECTION OF AN OBJECT PASSING A GOAL PLANE<br>
The present invention relates to a system for detection of whether a movable object,<br>
such as a sports object, e.g. a football or an ice hockey puck, has passed a flat plane<br>
in space, such as a goal plane defined e.g. as a vertical plane extending from a goal<br>
line or a horizontal plane defined by the upper rim of the basketball basket.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Traditionally, the referee or referees of a sports match decides from visual<br>
observation whether or not the ball has passed the goal plane. However, this may be<br>
very difficult to determine correctly in situations where the ball is returned quickly<br>
and has only just passed, or not passed, the goal plane, and it is particularly difficult<br>
if the referee is positioned unsuitably with respect to the goal plane or is engaged in<br>
other activity of the match. Video camera may also be used to monitor the goal<br>
planes, but the spatial and temporal resolution of video-cameras are often not<br>
sufficient to provide the necessary information in cases of doubt.<br>
A number of electronic systems are known in the art for determining the position of a<br>
ball on a sports field by means of position systems, as disclosed in e.g. WO<br>
01/66201, FR 2 753 633, FR 2 726 370, WO 99/34230, US 4 675 816, US 5 346 210<br>
and WO 98/37932. These positioning systems may be used e.g. for determining if the<br>
ball has passed the border of the playing field and the positions of the players as well<br>
and provides many useful information to the referee. However, the determination of<br>
the passage of the goal plane is a very delicate matter, both because it may be<br>
decisive for the outcome of the sports match and because the distances are small and<br>
the velocity of the object often very high, so that a position determining system to<br>
provide a reliable determination of whether the object has passed the goal plane must<br>
be very precise in the determination of the position and at the same time have a very<br>
high update rate of the position determination. The object may e.g. move with 72<br>
km/h or up to 130 km/h, which equals 20 m/s and 36 m/s, respectively, which means<br><br>
WO 2006/094508	PCT/DK2006/000136<br>
2<br>
that an update rate of 1/100 s will add an uncertainty of 20 cm or up to 36 cm,<br>
respectively, to the determined position, which is unacceptable with respect to<br>
determination of a goal in a sports match.<br>
Position systems with a sufficiently precise determination of the position of a sports<br>
object and a sufficiently high update rate to provide reliable indications of the<br>
crossing of a goal plane, are very expensive to install and maintain. It is therefore<br>
desirable to provide an alternative system with a sufficient spatial as well as temporal<br>
resolution to provide reliable indications.<br>
US 5,976,038 discloses an apparatus for providing an output indication when a<br>
playing object crosses the play determinative line. The apparatus comprises a<br>
directional receiving antenna, such as a disk-reflector antenna and in particular a<br>
cassegrain antenna provided with dual, horizontally adjacent feeds, which are<br>
combined to provide sum and difference signals. The antenna is arranged outside the<br>
playing field and is directed along the play determinative line. In order to provide a<br>
sufficiently high spatial resolution due to the distance between the antenna and the<br>
playing object, the reflector of the antenna must have considerable dimensions. A<br>
reflector of 30 inch width, 76 cm, will provide a detection zone of 4 inch width, 10<br>
cm, which together with other uncertainties of the system is acceptable for use with<br>
American football as the patent is directed at, but is unacceptable for many other<br>
sports games and a much larger reflector would be required.<br>
US 4,375,289 discloses two electrical conductors or emitter coils encircling or<br>
enclosing the goal plane in two vertical levels with a mutual distance in the direction<br>
perpendicular to the goal plane and emitting each an electromagnetic field by<br>
providing the two conductors with alternating current in counter-phase, so that the<br>
electromagnetic field perceivable at the object when passing the goal plane is zero at<br>
the mid-plane between the two levels due to destructive interference, and the passage<br>
of this mid-plane is determined from measurements of the field intensity at a sensor<br>
in the ball. The ball sensor employed is a passive unit that receives power from the<br><br>
WO 2006/094508	PCT/DK2006/000136<br>
3<br>
electromagnetic field by induction of current in a coil or antennae of the sensor, and<br>
emits a signal accordingly, which is detected by a detection coil situated between the<br>
two conductors, and the direction of the passage may be detected as well by means of<br>
a phase comparison between a signal received from the ball sensor and the phases of<br>
the currents in the conductors. The system may also be designed reversely with<br>
respect to emitter and detection coils, so that one emitter coil is situated in the goal<br>
plane between two detection coils with corresponding operation of the system, so<br>
that the ball is detected to pass the goal plane when the detected signals in the two<br>
detection coils are equal.<br>
However, this arrangement has the drawback that the spatial resolution is limited by<br>
the size of the ball as the coil of the sensor substantially encircles the ball diameter,<br>
which is of increasing importance with decreasing distance between the ball and the<br>
detection coil. This is not a major problem when detecting most scored goals when<br>
the ball clearly passes the goal plane, but in situations of doubt where the ball only<br>
just passes or do not pass the goal plane completely and the ball is close to the coils,<br>
the spatial resolution is not sufficient to decide with a satisfactory precision whether<br>
or not the goal has been scored.<br>
Furthermore, the present inventor has discovered that the electromagnetic fields<br>
emitted from the emitter coils encircling the goal plane is distorted in the area close<br>
to the coils and in particular near the area where the horizontal and vertical parts of<br>
the coils meet and the plane where the destructive interference is highest and the<br>
combined field is zero may deviate several centimetres from the goal plane in these<br>
areas.<br>
Thus, it is an object of the present invention to provide a system for detecting the<br>
passage of an object passing a goal plane with an improved precision.<br>
With the present invention several technical features are provided, which each or in<br>
combination presents such improvement.<br><br>
WO 2006/094508	PCT/DK2006/000136<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The stationary conductors disclosed in US 4,375,289 enclosing the goal plane and<br>
producing the electromagnetic field that are used in order to detect the passage of the<br>
goal plane, alternatively detect the signal emitted by the sensors in the ball, may in an<br>
advantageous embodiment of the present invention be sectioned into a plurality of<br>
separate circuits. The problems relating to the spatial resolution of the system when<br>
the ball is close to the detecting coil may thereby be remedied by the ability of such<br>
system to separate detection data relating to different parts of the perimeter of the<br>
goal plane, so that data relating to the section closest to the passing ball may be<br>
disregarded in deciding whether the ball has passed the goal plane. This may e.g. be<br>
carried out by providing a distinct electromagnetic field from each of the sections so<br>
that the response from the sensors in the ball may be separated in the signal<br>
processing means of the system into responses on fields from the separate sections.<br>
In the embodiment where the sections are used as detectors, each section may e.g.<br>
provide a separate output to the signal processing means of the system and thereby<br>
enable an analysis where the near-field problems may be remedied. Furthermore, the<br>
system may be established without having to provide a closed electric circuit<br>
encircling the goal plane completely as shown in US 4,375,289, i.e. that the<br>
sectioned system of conductors may be designed to operate without the presence of<br>
conductors in the ground under the goal line, which are inconvenient to establish and<br>
to connect to the conductors above the ground, in particular if the goal itself, to<br>
which the connectors above ground normally are fastened, needs to be moved. Also,<br>
the precise position of the moving object when passing the goal plane may be<br>
deduced from the output, which is very useful when animations of the scored (or not<br>
scored) goal are produced for direct television transmission of a sports game.<br>
Thus, the present invention relates to a system comprising<br>
a movable object, e.g. a handball, a football or an ice hockey puck,<br>
radio wave emitter means arranged in the movable object, preferably in the<br>
form of a number of tuned antenna circuits,<br><br>
WO 2006/094508	PCT/DK2006/000136<br>
5<br>
stationary exciter means arranged for exciting said radio wave emitter means,<br>
e.g. by emitting electromagnetic waves of a wavelength corresponding to the tuned<br>
circuits of the radio wave emitter means,<br>
stationary receiver means for receiving the radio waves from the radio wave<br>
emitter means and provide an output accordingly,<br>
a plurality of substantially closed first antenna circuits arranged along the<br>
periphery of a flat target plane, each first antenna circuit comprising two<br>
substantially parallel conductors extending substantially parallel to said periphery of<br>
the target plane, said parallel conductors being arranged with a mutual distance in the<br>
direction perpendicularly to the flat target plane, wherein said plurality of first<br>
antenna circuits constitutes one of said stationary exciter means and said stationary<br>
receiver means,<br>
the system further comprising processing means to receive and process said<br>
output together with a predetermined set of conditions and providing a resulting<br>
output if the set of conditions are fulfilled so as to determine whether the movable<br>
object passes the flat target plane.<br>
By the term first antenna circuit is understood a closed loop of one or more<br>
conductors arranged along a path, preferably defined in a flat plane, so that the loop<br>
encloses an area. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the first antenna circuits are<br>
arranged each on a separate rigid structure, such as a plate structure.<br>
When the term "along the periphery of the flat target plane" is used, it is understood<br>
that the antenna circuits are arranged close to or adjacent to the periphery, such as<br>
within 50 centimetres, preferably within 20 centimetres of the periphery as measured<br>
in the plane of the flat target plane and in the distance away from the target plane.<br>
The target plane is generally the plane the middle of the movable objects, or more<br>
particularly of the radio wave emitter means must pass for the being regarded as<br>
having passed the target plane, i.e. that a goal is scored.<br><br>
WO 2006/094508	PCT/DK2006/000136<br>
6<br>
The substantially parallel conductors of each first antenna circuit are preferably<br>
arranged on each side of the flat target plane in substantially the same distance<br>
perpendicularly to the target plane.<br>
The mutual distance in the direction perpendicularly to the flat target plane between<br>
the substantially parallel conductors of each first antenna circuit is preferably within<br>
the range of 15 to 50 centimetres, and the distance between the parallel conductors of<br>
each antenna circuit is preferably the same for all of the plurality of the antenna<br>
circuits of the system.<br>
The length of the substantially parallel conductors of each first antenna circuit along<br>
the periphery of said flat target plane is preferably within the range of 0.5 to 3<br>
meters, more preferably in the range of 1 to 2 meters.<br>
At least some of the first antenna circuits, such as in the range of 4 to 16, preferably<br>
in the range of 6 to 12 , are in a preferred embodiment of the present invention<br>
arranged in series along a substantially horizontal line of the fiat target plane, in<br>
particular along a horizontal crossbar of a goal delimiting the flat target plane. The<br>
first antenna circuits are preferably arranged substantially equidistantly along the<br>
horizontal line of the flat target plane.<br>
Likewise is it also preferred that at least some of the first antenna circuits are<br>
arranged in series along substantially vertical lines of the flat target plane, in<br>
particular vertical side posts of a goal delimiting the flat target plane. The number of<br>
first antenna circuits along each vertical line is preferably in the range of 2 to 8, most<br>
preferably in the range of 3 to 6. The first antenna circuits are preferably arranged<br>
substantially equidistantly along the vertical lines of the flat target plane.<br>
The system may further comprise a second antenna circuit extending substantially at<br>
the periphery of the flat target plane and constituting the other of said stationary<br>
exciter means and said stationary receiver means, i.e. situated where the signal from<br><br>
WO 2006/094508	PCT/DK2006/000136<br>
7<br>
the movable object is most crucial for determining the possible passage of the target<br>
plane. The second antenna circuit may extend somewhat outside the periphery in the<br>
direction parallel to the target plane as long as it extends substantially in the same<br>
plane as the target plane.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, the first antenna circuits constitute the<br>
stationary receiver means and the second antenna circuit constitutes the stationary<br>
exciter means. In this case, the output to the data processing means represents the<br>
voltage or current generated in each of the first antenna circuits. In a particularly<br>
preferred embodiment, the system comprises compensation means for each of the<br>
first antenna circuits for compensating of a possible misalignment of the first antenna<br>
circuit and the second antenna circuit during operation of the system. This<br>
misalignment would cause the second antenna circuit to generate a voltage or current<br>
in the first antenna circuit, a false signal, and the purpose of the compensation means<br>
is to reduce or eliminate such false signal in the first antenna circuit, whereby the<br>
signal-to-noise ratio of the first antenna circuit with respect to the radio wave emitter<br>
means in the moving object is improved. Furthermore, if this false signal is<br>
eliminated after calibration of the compensation means, a signal detected by a first<br>
antenna circuit and not originating from the radio wave emitter means in the moving<br>
object may be used to detect a possible error in the alignment of the plane of the first<br>
antenna circuit with a plane perpendicularly to the flat target plane in that such signal<br>
would origin either from the opposing part of the second antenna circuit extending<br>
parallel to the part of the second antenna circuit adjacent to the first antenna circuit or<br>
from a third calibration antenna extending in the same plane as the flat target plane<br>
but with a distance to the first antenna circuit away from the periphery of the flat<br>
target plane, so that the angular misalignment can be deduced. Such detected angular<br>
misalignment between the plane of the first antenna circuit with the plane<br>
perpendicularly to the flat target plane may be used to compensate the output from<br>
the first antenna circuit in question when determining whether or not the moving<br>
object is passing the target plane.<br><br>
WO 2006/094508	PCT/DK2006/000136<br>
8<br>
A signal detected by a first antenna circuit may upon analysis be determined to<br>
generated from electromagnetic waves from radio wave emitter means arranged in<br>
the movable object if those emitter means comprises a tuned circuit in that the phase<br>
angle of voltage or current generated by the waves from such circuit will be<br>
displaced about 90 degrees with respect to the alternating current of the exciter<br>
means.<br>
The compensation means may be implemented in the signal processing means of the<br>
system or be constituted by a circuit connected to the first antenna circuit in question<br>
and feeding a compensating counter current to it. However, in a preferred<br>
embodiment, the first compensation means comprises a compensation loop arranged<br>
substantially in the plane of the first antenna circuit and displaced from the periphery<br>
of the flat target plane towards one of the parallel conductors. A suitable actuating<br>
current fed to the compensation loop will result in a cancelling of part of the<br>
electromagnetic field generated by the second antenna circuit and thus provide a<br>
compensation for the first antenna circuit being non-perpendicular to the flat target<br>
plane.<br>
The detection of the crossing of the goal plane has to be made with a high degree of<br>
precision, which requires a high spatial resolution of the detection system which<br>
again requires a high temporal resolution as the ball often moves with a high velocity<br>
of the order of 20 m/s or even more such as 36 m/s<br>
According to another aspect, the ball applied in the present invention may be<br>
equipped with memory means, separate wireless transmission means and control<br>
means for controlling the memory means and the transmission means. The control<br>
means are arranged to sample the field intensity measured by the sensor with a given<br>
sample rate, e.g. 500 to 10,000 Hz, such as 4,000 Hz, and all sampled values are<br>
provided to the memory means operating as a FIFO (first in first out) memory, so<br>
that the latest sample replaces the oldest stored sample in the memory, whereby the<br>
newest samples of e.g. the last 0.5 seconds are stored in the memory means at any<br><br>
WO 2006/094508	PCT/DK2006/000136<br>
9<br>
time where the sensor is powered by a battery or by induction from the<br>
electromagnetic field of the conductors.<br>
Only when an indication of a passage of the goal plane is detected, the control means<br>
are arranged to perform a transmission of the entire set of samples stored in the<br>
memory means is performed. Such indication could be made from a preliminary<br>
analysis of the samples made by the individual sensor, from comparison of the<br>
detections made by a plurality of sensors arranged in the same ball, or a more coarse<br>
redundancy system, such as the one disclosed in US 4,375,289. The transmitted data<br>
are received by a stationary receiver and analysed to determine whether the ball has<br>
passed the goal plane. Optionally, the control means are furthermore arranged to<br>
transmit a fraction of the measured samples of the field intensities only, such as 1/10<br>
or 1/5 of the samples as a standard, constantly during sampling of the field<br>
intensities.<br>
In this manner, a more detailed set of data representing the field intensity detected by<br>
the sensor may be provided to the stationary control unit for analysis as the sample<br>
rate of the field intensity detected by the sensor at the time of a possible passage of<br>
the goal plane may be many times higher than the data transmission rate. The data<br>
transmission rate depends on the selected transmission frequency and the available<br>
power for transmitting the data, and for a passive sensor, the available power is<br>
proportional to the area enclosed by the conductor of the sensor in which the power<br>
is inducted by the electromagnetic field. With the present embodiment of the sensor,<br>
a reliable transmission intensity, resulting in a suitable signal-to-noise ratio at the<br>
receiver, is made possible for a suitably high data sample rate of e.g. a factor of 10<br>
times the reliable data transmission rate, and a small area enclosed by the conductor<br>
of the sensor, whereby the physical extend of the sensor allows for the provision of a<br>
plurality of sensors, such as four, six, eight or even more in a standard football or<br>
other standard balls for ball games.<br><br>
WO 2006/094508	PCT/DK2006/000136<br>
10<br>
In a particular embodiment, the control means of the sensor is arranged to transmit<br>
the data stored in the memory means in a sequence where the most relevant data is<br>
transmitted first, i.e. the data closest to a determined probable passing of the goal<br>
plane, e.g. the first sample after the passing, followed by the first sample before the<br>
passing, then the second sample after the passing etc. In a second embodiment, a<br>
sampling of lower frequency, e.g. every fifth or every tenth sample is transmitted<br>
first, after which the remaining data stored in the memory means are transmitted.<br>
Thereby, the chance of the most important data being received and processed by the<br>
stationary unit is improved.<br>
Preferably, the data are transmitted from the sensor in digital form to further improve<br>
the signal-to-noise ratio of the received data signals from the sensor, and an<br>
advantageous transmission frequency is 27-35 MHz but other suitable frequencies<br>
such as 433 MHz, 868 MHz or 2.4 GHz may also be applied. The preferred<br>
frequencies employed are within the ranges that do not require a public license for<br>
use.<br>
In most games, such as football (also known as "soccer") the whole ball must have<br>
passed the goal plane for a goal to be deemed scored, and a high spatial resolution of<br>
the detection of the ball passing the goal plane is thus desirable. With known sensors<br>
as shown in US 4,375,289, the ball is encircled by three conductors arranged in<br>
intersecting, perpendicular planes passing through the centre of the ball. In each<br>
conductor, a current is inducted in proportion to the total electromagnetic flux<br>
through the area encircled by the conductor. The total electromagnetic flux through<br>
the area depends on the flux density and the angle between the direction of the<br>
electromagnetic flux vector and the area, but the variations of the angle is generally<br>
compensated by combining the induced currents in the three, perpendicular<br>
conductors. However, the flux density is integrated over an area the size of the cross<br>
sectional area of the ball and the combined induced current is thus a measure of the<br>
total flux passing the ball. The spatial resolution of the sensor is consequently limited<br>
by the size of the ball.<br><br>
WO 2006/094508	PCT/DK2006/000136<br>
11<br>
In order to improve the spatial resolution a plurality of sensors may be provided in<br>
the ball, preferably between the inner latex balloon of the ball and the outer shell<br>
thereof, but could alternatively be situated on the inside of the latex balloon. In one<br>
embodiment, each of the sensors or at least a part of the sensors are passive sensors<br>
comprising an antenna circuit or coil connected to a capacitor or the like to constitute<br>
a tuned circuit corresponding to the wavelength of the emitted electromagnetic field.<br>
In a second embodiment, the data of the field intensity measured by the individual<br>
sensors are transmitted to a stationary data processing unit for determination of the<br>
passage of the goal plane of each individual sensor. The compensation for the angle<br>
between the induction antenna of the individual sensor and the electromagnetic flux<br>
vector may then be made at the stationary data processing unit from the complete set<br>
of data from the plurality of sensors by solving a system of equations regarding the<br>
spatial and angular position of the ball. The important feature to determine is whether<br>
all sensors have passed the goal plane, which is not necessarily physically coincident<br>
with the mid-plane between the conductors encircling the goal plane.<br>
It is advantageous for this data processing that the individual sensors in the ball are<br>
synchronised with respect to sampling of field intensity data by means of<br>
synchronisation means, which e.g. may be provided by interconnecting the sensors<br>
and providing a common synchronisation signal or alternatively by providing a<br>
synchronisation signal to the sensors by means of the current in the conductors<br>
providing the electromagnetic field. It would also be an advantage that the data<br>
transmission from the individual sensors are coordinated so that the data transmission<br>
does not interfere negatively, which may be provided by mutually connecting the<br>
sensors so that the individual data transmissions may be synchronised or by having<br>
one common data transmission means in the ball by which all data are transmitted to<br>
the stationary data processing unit. Alternatively, each sensor may have data<br>
transmission means arranged to transmit data to the stationary data processing unit at<br>
separate frequencies. Another advantageous feature would be for passive sensors to<br>
interconnect the power supplies of the individual sensors, so that each sensor will<br><br>
WO 2006/094508	PCT/DK2006/000136<br>
12<br>
have sufficient power to obtain and transmit measured data of the field intensity<br>
regardless of the angle between the area spanned by the induction antennae of the<br>
individual sensor and the direction of the electromagnetic flux vector.<br>
The ball may further comprise identification means for emitting a unique<br>
identification to the stationary data processing means for ensuring that the ball used<br>
in the game is certified to be used with the system according to the invention.<br>
Furthermore, calibration data and communication details for the individual ball may<br>
be transmitted.<br>
The electromagnetic field intensity from the two coils shown in US 4,375,289 with<br>
currents in counter-phase is lowest at the area where it is most crucial for the<br>
detection to have the most precise determination of the position of the ball sensor.<br>
Thus, the signal to be detected as well as the power provided for passive sensors by<br>
the electromagnetic field is lowest at this area and zero at the mid-plane which is<br>
situated at or close to the goal plane.<br>
One solution according to an aspect of the present invention is providing the current<br>
source of one of the conductors with a fast phase shifting arrangement, so that the<br>
phase of the conductor may be switched between being in counter-phase and in<br>
phase with the other conductor with a switching rate of the order of magnitude of the<br>
sampling rate of the signal intensity detected at the ball, i.e. between 200 and 10,000<br>
Hz, preferably in the range of 500 to 6,000 Hz, so that e.g. every second or third<br>
sample is made when the electromagnetic fields are in phase and the two fields at the<br>
mid-plane between the two conductors are in constructive interference and the field<br>
intensity has a maximum at that plane due to the configuration of the separate field<br>
intensities and the distance between the two conductors.<br>
Thus, the provision of a high field intensity at the position of the mid-plane is an<br>
advantage when using passive ball sensors, i.e. sensors that are powered by the<br>
electromagnetic field provided by the conductors, because the available power for<br><br>
WO 2006/094508	PCT/DK2006/000136<br>
13<br>
detection of the field intensity and transmitting data thereby is high, also for<br>
detection of the weak field intensities of the electromagnetic fields in counter-phase.<br>
Furthermore, the position of the ball sensor with respect to the mid-plane may be<br>
detected with two different methods, from a determination of the passage of the zero<br>
field intensity as in the known technique when the currents are in counter-phase as<br>
well as from a determination of the maximum intensity when the currents are in<br>
phase. The first method provides an excellent overall indication of the passage of the<br>
mid-plane and possibly the direction of the passage, but has a weakness with respect<br>
to the details near the actual passage as the detected field intensity is very low in that<br>
area, whereas the second method has highest field intensity around the passage of the<br>
mid-plane and thus the most details, but the second method, in which a peak value of<br>
the filed intensity is detected, applied by itself has a high risk of erroneous passage<br>
detections as peak values may occur at other positions of the ball sensors than the<br>
mid-plane due to e.g. interference from the bodies of the players and from external<br>
sources of electromagnetic fields. A threshold value for the peak intensity may be<br>
applied for filtering the detected intensities, but it has only a limited effect because of<br>
the field intensity variation over the goal plane with at least an order of magnitude<br>
(i.e. a factor of 10).<br>
However, by combining the second method with the first method, the risk of<br>
erroneous passage detections is in practice eliminated as an estimate of the correct<br>
passage position is provided by the first method and the combined method obtains<br>
the high spatial resolution of the second method.<br>
A second solution is to provide the emitting coils with overlapping currents of<br>
different frequencies, so that current at a first frequency for supplying power is in<br>
phase at the two coils, so that the electromagnetic fields of this frequency are in<br>
constructive interference and current of a second frequency for providing a signal is<br>
supplied in counter-phase. The electromagnetic field of the first frequency may be<br>
used to supply the sensor or sensors in the ball with power at all positions during the<br><br>
WO 2006/094508	PCT/DK2006/000136<br>
14<br>
passage of the goal plane. In this case, arrangements are to be made in the ball sensor<br>
to separate the effect of the two frequencies, such as employing separate resonance<br>
circuits for the frequencies.<br>
Yet another solution is to provide the emitting coils with currents of only slightly<br>
different frequencies, so that the interference will produce an intensity varying at the<br>
mid-plane between zero intensity and a maximum intensity with a frequency equal to<br>
the difference in frequency between the two currents. The difference in frequency is<br>
preferably equal to an unequal multiple of the sample frequency of the sensor, such<br>
one or three times the sample frequency, so that power is induced in the coil of the<br>
sensor at all positions of the sensor and the intensity frequency may be used to<br>
synchronise the sample frequency in order for the sensor or sensors in the ball to<br>
detect the presence of zero intensity correctly.<br>
Furthermore, it is within the present invention to address multiple sensors arranged in<br>
the same ball by means of emitting different overlapping frequencies for providing<br>
power and/signals to the individual sensor, so that the emitting coils e.g. may be used<br>
to select a subgroup of the sensors in the ball for measurement or that the individual<br>
sensors are addressed in sequence.<br>
The frequency of the electromagnetic field provided by the two conductors is<br>
preferably within the range of 10 to 1,000 kHz, such as 50 to 500 kHz and most<br>
preferred within the range of 100 to 200 kHz, because electromagnetic fields in this<br>
range has practically no interaction with water molecules and therefore has no<br>
significant effect on the human bodies subjected to the field, and the disturbances of<br>
the field caused by the human bodies within the field are correspondingly reduced.<br>

arranged along the perimeter of the goal plane, and<br>

The figures are illustrations of embodiments of the present invention and are not to<br>
be regarded as limiting to the scope of the invention as presented herein.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
In Fig. 1, three sections of the cross bar of a football goal are shown schematically as<br>
seen from above. Each section comprises a conductor 1 in a first plane and a parallel<br>
conductor 2 in a second plane and two intermediate conductors 3, 4 connecting the<br>
other conductors 1, 2 to form a circuit wherein a current may run as indicated by the<br>
arrowheads. Each section has a separate control unit 5 for feeding current into the<br>
circuit of the section and possibly obtain data relating to objects in which a power is<br>
inducted by the section. The distance D between the parallel conductors 1,2 in the<br>
horizontal direction normal to the goal plane is preferably chosen to be about the<br>
diameter of a standard football according to the regulations set by FIFA, more<br>
generally speaking from 15 to 50 centimetres. In a specific embodiment, the parallel<br>
conductors 1, 2 in the same plane of adjacent sections may be electrically connected,<br>
so that the front conductor 1 of one section is connected to the front conductor 1 of<br>
the adjacent section etc. In Fig. 2, the goal is shown as seen from above with seven<br>
sections 6 distributed along the cross bar 8 and 5 section 7 along each side post 9 of<br>
the goal.<br>
The number of sections may be e.g. 2 to 20 along the cross bar of the goal, such as 4<br>
to 16 and preferably 6 to 12, and 2 to 8 sections along each side post of the goal, such<br><br>
WO 2006/094508	PCT/DK2006/000136<br>
16<br>
as 3 to 6 sections, The length of each section is in a preferred embodiment within the<br>
range from 0.5 meters to 3 meters, such as 1 to 2 meters.<br>
Each section may be controlled easily and fast, e.g. for fast switching of the phase or<br>
overlaying currents of different frequency as discussed in the previous section.<br>
Furthermore, the individual section may be controlled separately by common or by<br>
separate control means, so that more detailed information about the position of a<br>
passing ball may be obtained, either from the control means of the sections, the<br>
electromagnetic fields of which are influenced by the passing ball, or by varying the<br>
emitted electromagnetic fields from the individual sections, so that the data obtained<br>
by the sensor or sensors in the ball may carry such positional information. The<br>
electromagnetic field of each section may have an individual identity, e.g. by<br>
overlaying the current with a current of a distinct frequency so that the data returned<br>
from the sensor or sensors of the ball may carry information about their position with<br>
respect to the sections, so that a position of the sensor may be determined by the<br>
stationary data processing means for determination of passage of the goal plane with<br>
correction for the possible distortion of the electromagnetic field as discussed<br>
previously. Also or as an alternative, the individual sections may be turned on and<br>
off rapidly to determine from which section or sections the electromagnetic field<br>
detected by the sensor or sensors origins. Furthermore, the sections may be used to<br>
test whether the system operates correctly by emitting an electromagnetic field<br>
outside the range detected by the sensor or sensors and record and evaluate the<br>
possible response from the system. The possible response may be employed to adjust<br>
a compensation algorithm in the data processing means of the system.<br>
The second embodiment of the section as shown in Fig. 3, the first antenna circuits<br>
constitute the stationary receiver means and the second antenna circuit 10 arranged at<br>
the circumference of the goal plane constitutes the stationary exciter means that<br>
provides an electromagnetic field with a frequency of about 125 kHz, which<br>
corresponds to the frequency to which the passive sensor and radio wave emitter<br>
means in the ball are tuned to. The parallel conductors 1, 2 of each section are<br><br>
WO 2006/094508	PCT/DK2006/000136<br>
17<br>
arranged with substantially the same distance D/2 in the direction perpendicularly to<br>
the goal plane from the second antenna circuit 10 so that the total current generated<br>
in the conductor 1, 2, 3, 4 circuit of the section ideally is zero when the ball is not<br>
near the section. However, the alignment of the parallel conductors 1, 2 and the<br>
second antenna circuit 10 is not necessarily perfect, so that a "false" current is<br>
generated in the section's conductors 1, 2, 3, 4. In order to compensate for this, each<br>
section is provided with a compensation circuit 11 arranged asymmetrically within<br>
the circuit of the section with respect to the second antenna circuit 10 and control<br>
means (not shown) of the compensation circuit 11 are adjusted to provide a current to<br>
the circuit 11 during operation of the system so that the current in the section's<br>
conductors is zero when not influenced by the ball. Each section has a pick-up unit<br>
12 arranged around the second antenna circuit in order to facilitate the calibration of<br>
the individual section independently of other features of the system.<br>
Each section has output means (not shown) for outputting a measure of the<br>
electromagnetic field from the ball as detected by the current generated in the<br>
section's circuit of conductors 1, 2, 3, 4 to control means (not shown) of the system.<br>
From the input from all of the sectors, the possible passage of the ball through the<br>
goal plane may be determined with a high precision as disturbed output from one<br>
section, e.g. due to the ball passing close to the section or due to malfunction of a<br>
section, may be neglected by the control means. Due to the fact that the possible<br>
misalignment between the conductors 1, 2, 3, 4 of the section and the second antenna<br>
circuit 10 are measured and compensated, the occurrence of a generated current in<br>
the section's conductors will be an indication of a angular error of the section, i.e.<br>
that the section is oriented non-perpendicular to the flat goal plane. Such generated<br>
current is easily separated from currents generated by the sensors in the ball as they<br>
are tuned and their phase is displaced 90 degrees with respect to the current in the<br>
second antenna circuit 10, whereas the current generated in the section's conductors<br>
directly by the second antenna circuit 10 arranged along the opposite side of the goal<br>
plane will be in phase with the current in the second antenna circuit 10. Thus, the<br>
detection provided by the section may be corrected for the angular error.<br><br>

The frequency of the electromagnetic field provided by the section is preferably<br>
within the range of 10 to 1,000 kHz, such as 50 to 500 kHz and most preferred within<br>
the range of 100 to 200 kHz, because electromagnetic fields in this range has<br>
practically no interaction with water molecules and therefore has no significant effect<br>
on the human bodies subjected to the field, and the disturbances of the field<br>
disturbances caused by the human bodies within the field are correspondingly<br>
reduced.<br><br>
