				<td>Carboxamide derivatives as muscarlntc receptor antagonists<br>
This Invention relates to compounds of general formula (I):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which R1, R2, R3, A, A1 and p have the meanings indicated below, and to processes and intermediates for the preparation of, compositions containing and the uses of such derivatives.<br>
Cholinerglc muscarinic receptors are members of the G-protein coupled receptor super-family and are further divided into 5 subtypes, M1 to M5. Muscarinic receptor sub-types are widely and differentially expressed In the body. Genes have been cloned for all 5 sub-types and of these, M1, M2 and M3 receptors have been extensively pharmacologically characterized in animal and human tissue. M1 receptors are expressed in the brain (cortex and hippocampus), glands and in the ganglia of sympathetic and parasympathetlc nerves. M2 receptors are expressed in the heart, hindbrain, smooth muscle and in the synapses of the autonomic nervous system. M3 receptors are expressed in the brain, glands and smooth muscle. In the airways, stimulation of M3 receptors evokes contraction of airway smooth muscle leading to bronchoconstriction, while in the salivary gland M3 receptor stimulation increases fluid and mucus secretion leading to increased salivation. M2 receptors expressed on smooth muscle are understood to be pro-contractile while pre-synaptic M2 receptors modulate acetylcholine release from parasympathetic nerves. Stimulation of M2 receptors expressed in the heart produces bradycardia.<br>
Short and long-acting muscarinic antagonists are used in the management of asthma and COPD; these include the short acting agents Atrovent® (ipratropium bromide) and Oxivent® (oxitropium bromide) and the long acting agent Spiriva® (tiotropium bromide). These compounds produce bronchodilation following inhaled administration. In addition to improvements in spirometric values, anti-muscarinic use in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with improvements in health status and quality of life scores. As a consequence of the wide distribution of muscarinic receptors in the body, significant systemic exposure to muscarinic antagonists is associated with effects such as dry mouth, constipation, mydriasis, urinary retention (all predominantly mediated via blockade of M3 receptors) and tachycardia (mediated by blockade of M2 receptors). A commonly reported side-effect following inhaled administration of therapeutic dose of the current, clinically used<br>
non-selective muscarinic antagonists is dry-mouth and while this is reported as only mild in-Intensity it does limit the dose of inhaled agent given.<br>
Accordingly, there is still a need for improved M3 receptor antagonists that would have an appropriate pharmacological profile, for example in term of potency, pharmacokinetics or duration of action. In this context, the present invention relates to novel M3 receptor antagonists. In particular, there is a need for M3 receptor antagonists that would have a pharmacological profile suitable for an administration by the inhalation route.<br>

For a review on suitable salts, see Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties. Selection and Use by Stahl and Wermuth (Wiley-VCH, 2002).<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of formula (I) may be prepared by one or<br>
more of three methods:<br>
(i)        by reacting the compound of formula (I) with the desired acid or base;<br>
(ii)        by removing an acid- or base-labile protecting group from a suitable precursor of the<br>
compound of formula (I) or by ring-opening a suitable cyclic precursor, for example, a<br>
lactone or lactam, using the desired acid or base; or (Hi)       by converting one salt of the compound of formula (I) to another by reaction with an<br>
appropriate acid or base or by means of a suitable ion exchange column. All three reactions are typically carried out in solution. The resulting salt may precipitate out and be collected by filtration or may be recovered by evaporation of the solvent. The degree of ionisatlon in the resulting salt may vary from completely ionised to almost non-ionised.<br>
The compounds of the invention may exist in a continuum of solid states ranging from fully amorphous to fully crystalline. The term 'amorphous' refers to a state in which the material lacks long range order at the molecular level and, depending upon temperature, may exhibit the physical properties of a solid or a liquid. Typically such materials do not give distinctive X-ray diffraction patterns and, while exhibiting the properties of a solid, are more formally described as a liquid. Upon heating, a change from solid to liquid properties occurs which is characterised by a change of state, typically second order ('glass transition'). The term 'crystalline1 refers to a solid phase in which the material has a regular ordered internal structure at the molecular level and gives a distinctive X-ray diffraction pattern with defined peaks. Such materials when heated sufficiently will also exhibit the properties of a liquid, but the change from solid to liquid is characterised by a phase change, typically first order ('melting .point').<br>
The compounds of the invention may also exist in unsolvated and solvated forms. The term 'solvate' is used herein to describe a molecular complex comprising the compound of the invention and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable solvent molecules, for example, ethanpl. The term 'hydrate' is employed when said solvent is water,<br>
A currently accepted classification system for organic hydrates is one that defines isolated site, channel, or metal-ion coordinated hydrates - see Polymorphism In Pharmaceutical Solids by K. R. Morris (Ed. H. G. Brittain, Marcel Dekker, 1995). Isolated site hydrates are ones in which the water molecules are isolated from direct contact with each other by intervening organic molecules. In channel hydrates, the water molecules lie in lattice channels where they are next to other water molecules. In metal-Ion coordinated hydrates, the water molecules are bonded to the metal ion.<br>
When the solvent or water is tightly bound, the complex will have a well-defined stoichlometry independent of humidity. When, however, the solvent or water is weakly bound, as in channel solvates and hygroscopic compounds, the water/solvent content will be dependent on humidity and drying conditions. In such cases, non-stoichiometry will be the norm.<br>
Also included within the scope of the Invention are multi-component complexes (other than salts and solvates) wherein the drug and at least one other component are present in stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts. Complexes of this type include clathrates (drug-host inclusion complexes) and co-crystals. The latter are typically defined as crystalline complexes of neutral molecular constituents which are bound together through non-covalent interactions, but could also be a complex of a neutral molecule with a salt. Co-crystals may be prepared by melt crystallisation, by recrystallisation from solvents, or by physically grinding the components together - see Chem Commun, 17., 1889-1896, by O. Almarsson and M. J. Zaworotko (2004). For a general review of multi-component complexes, see J Pharm Sci, 61 (8), 1269-1288, by Haleblian (August 1975).<br>
The compounds of the invention may also exist in a mesomorphic state (mesophase or liquid crystal) when subjected to suitable conditions. The mesomorphic state Is intermediate between the true crystalline state and the true liquid state (either melt or solution). Mesomorphism arising as the result of a change in temperature is described as 'thermotropic' and that resulting from the addition of a second component, such as water or another solvent, is described as 'lyotropic'. Compounds that have the potential to form lyotropic mesophases are described as 'amphiphilic' and consist of molecules which possess an ionic (such as -COO'Na*, -COO'K*. or -SO3'Na*) or non-ionic (such as -N'N+(CH3)3) polar head group. For more Information, see Crystals and the Polarizing Microscope by N. H. Hartshorne and A. Stuart, 4th Edition (Edward Arnold, 1970).<br>
Hereinafter all references to compounds of formula (I) include references to salts, solvates, multi-component complexes and liquid crystals thereof and to solvates, multi-component complexes and liquid crystals of salts thereof.<br>
The compounds of the invention include compounds of formula (I) as hereinbefore defined, including all polymorphs and crystal habits thereof, prodrugs and isomers thereof (including optical, geometric and tautomeric isomers) as hereinafter defined and isotopically-labeled compounds of formula (I).<br>
As indicated, so-called 'prodrugs' of the compounds of formula (1) are also within the scope of the invention. Thus certain derivatives of compounds of formula (I) which may have little or no pharmacological activity themselves can, when administered into or onto the body, be<br>
converted into compounds of formula (I) having the desired activity, for example, by hydrolytic cleavage. Such derivatives are referred to as 'prodrugs'. Further information on the use of prodrugs may be found in Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems. Vol. 14, ACS Symposium Series (T. Higuchl and W. Stella) and Bloreversible Carriers in Drug Design. Pergamon Press, 1987 (Ed. E. B. Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association).<br>
Prodrugs in accordance with the invention can, for example, be produced by replacing appropriate functionalities present In the compounds of formula (I) with certain moieties known to those skilled in the art as 'pro-moieties' as described, for example, in Design of Prodrugs by H. Bundgaard (Elsevier, 1985).<br>
Some examples of prodrugs in accordance with the invention include<br>
(i)        where the compound of formula (I) contains a carboxylic acid functionality<br>
(-COOH), an ester thereof, for example, a compound wherein the hydrogen of the carboxylic acid functionality of the compound of formula.(I) is replaced by (Cr C8)alkyl;<br>
(ii) where the compound of formula (I) contains an alcohol functionality (-OH), an ether thereof, for example, a compound wherein the hydrogen of the alcohol functionality of the compound of formula (I) is replaced by (CVCeJalkanoyloxymethyl; and<br>
(Hi) where the compound of formula (I) contains a primary or secondary amino functionality (-NH2or-NHR where R # H), an amide thereof, for example, a compound wherein, as the case may be, one or both hydrogens of the amino functionality of the compound of formula (I) is/are replaced by (CrC10)alkanoyl.<br>
Further examples of replacement groups in accordance with the foregoing examples and examples of other prodrug types may be found in the aforementioned references.<br>
Moreover, certain compounds of formula (I) may themselves act as prodrugs of other compounds of formula I.<br>
Also included within the scope of the invention are metabolites of compounds of formula I, that is, compounds formed in vivo upon administration of the drug. Some examples of metabolites in accordance with the invention include (i)        where the compound of formula (I) contains a methyl group, an hydroxymethyl<br>
derivative thereof {-CH3 -&gt; -CH2OH): .(ii)       where the compound of formula (I) contains an alkoxy group, an hydroxy derivative<br>
thereof (-OR-&gt;-OH); (iii)      where the compound of formula (I) contains a tertiary amino group, a secondary<br>
amino derivative thereof (-NR1R2 -&gt; -NHR1 or -NHR2);<br>
(iv&gt;      where the compound of formula (I) contains a secondary amino group, a primary<br>
derivative thereof (-NHR1 -&gt; -NH2); (v)       where the compound of formula (I) contains a phenyl moiety, a phenol derivative<br>
thereof (-Ph -&gt; -PhOH); and (vl)      where the compound of formula (I) contains an amide group, a carboxylic acid<br>
derivative thereof (-CONH2 -&gt; COOH).<br>
Compounds of formula (I) containing one or more asymmetric carbon atoms can exist as two or more stereoisomers. Where a compound of formula (I) contains an alkenyl or alkenylene group, geometric cisltrans (or Z/E) isomers are possible. Where structural isomers are interconvertible via a low energy barrier, tautomeric Isomerism ('tautomerism') can occur. This can take the form of proton tautomerism in compounds of formula (I) containing, for example, an imino, keto, or oxime group, or so-called valence tautomerism in compounds which contain an aromatic moiety. It follows that a single compound may exhibit more than one type of isomerism.<br>
Included within'the scope of the present invention are all stereoisomers, geometric isomers and tautomeric forms of the compounds of formula I, Including compounds exhibiting more than one type of isomerism, and mixtures of one or more thereof. Also included are acid addition or base salts wherein the counterlon is optically active, for example, of-lactate or /-lysine, or racemic, for example, rfMartrate or cf/-arginine.<br>
Cisltrans isomers may be separated by conventional techniques well known to those skilled in the art, for example, chromatography and fractional crystallisation.<br>
Conventional techniques for the preparation/isolation of individual enantiomers include chiral synthesis from a suitable optically pure precursor or resolution of the racemate (or the racemate of a salt or derivative) using, for example, chiral high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC).<br>
Alternatively, the racemate (or a racemic precursor) may be reacted with a suitable optically active compound, for example, an alcohol, or, in the case where the compound of formula (I) contains an acidic or basic moiety, a base or acid such as 1-phenylethylamine or tartarlc acid. The resulting diastereomeric mixture may be separated by chromatography and/or fractional crystallization and one or both of the diastereoisomers converted to the corresponding pure enantiomer(s) by means well known to a skilled person.<br>
Chiral compounds of the invention (and chiral precursors thereof) may be obtained in enantiomerically-enrlched form using chromatography, typically HPLC, on an asymmetric resin with a mobile phase consisting of a hydrocarbon, typically heptane or hexane, containing from 0 to 50% by volume of isopropanol, typically from 2% to 20%, and from 0 to<br>
5% by volume of an alkylamine, typically 0.1% diethylamine. Concentration of the eluate affords the enriched mixture.<br>
When any racemate crystallises, crystals of two different types are possible. The first type is the racemic compound (true racemate) referred to above wherein one homogeneous form of crystal is produced containing both enantiomers in equimolar amounts. The second type is the racemic mixture or conglomerate wherein two forms of crystal are produced In equimolar amounts each comprising a single enantiomer.<br>
While both of the crystal forms present in a racemic mixture have identical physical properties, they may have different physical properties compared to the true racemate. Racemic mixtures may be separated by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art - see, for example, Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds by E. L. Eliel and S. H. Wilen<br>
(Wiley, 1994).<br>
The present invention includes all pharmaceutically acceptable isotopically-labelled compounds of formula (I) wherein one or more atoms are replaced by atoms having the same atomic number, but an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number which predominates In nature.<br>
Examples of isotopes suitable for inclusion in the compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, such as 2H and 3H, carbon, such as 11C, 13C and 14C, chlorine, such as 36CI, fluorine, such as 18F, iodine, such as 123I and 125I, nitrogen, such as 13N and 16N, oxygen, such as 1SO, 17O and 18O, phosphorus, such as 32P, and sulphur, such as 35S.<br>
Certain isotopically-labelled compounds of formula I, for example, those incorporating a radioactive Isotope, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution studies. The radioactive isotopes tritium, i.e. 3H, and carbon-14, I.e. 14C, are particularly useful for this purpose in view of their ease of incorporation and ready means of detection.<br>
Substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e. 2H, may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example, increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements, and hence may be preferred in some circumstances.<br>
Substitution with positron emitting isotopes, such as "C, 18F, 16O and 13N, can be useful in Positron Emission Topography (PET) studies for examining substrate receptor occupancy.<br>
Isotopically-labeled compounds of formula (I) can' generally be prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled In the art or by processes analogous to those described in the accompanying Examples and Preparations using an appropriate isotopically-labeled reagent in place of the non-labeled reagent previously employed.<br>
Pharmaceutlcally acceptable solvates in accordance with the invention include those wherein the solvent of crystallization may be isotopically substituted, e.g. D2O, d6-acetone, d6-DMSO.<br>
Also within the scope of the invention are intermediate compounds of formula II as hereinbefore defined, .all salts, solvates and complexes thereof and all solvates and complexes of salts thereof as defined hereinbefore for compounds of formula I. The invention includes all polymorphs of the aforementioned species and crystal habits thereof.<br>
When preparing compounds of formula (I) in accordance with the invention, it is open to a person skilled In the art to routinely select the form of compound of formula II which provides the best combination of features for this purpose. Such features include the melting point, solubility, processability and yield of the intermediate form and the resulting ease with which the product may be purified on isolation.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) should be assessed for their biopharmaceutical properties, such as solubility and solution stability (across pH), permeability, etc., in order to select the most appropriate dosage form and route of administration for treatment of the proposed indication.<br>
Compounds of the invention intended for pharmaceutical use may be administered as crystalline or amorphous products. They may be obtained, for example, as solid plugs, powders, or films by methods such as precipitation, crystallization, freeze drying, spray drying, or evaporative drying. Microwave or radio frequency drying may be used for this purpose.<br>
They may be administered alone or in combination with one or more other compounds of the invention or in combination with one or more other drugs (or as any combination thereof). Generally, they will be administered as a formulation in association with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. The term 'excipient' Is used herein to describe any ingredient other than the compound(s) of the invention. The choice of excipient will to a large extent depend on factors such as the particular mode of administration, the effect of the excipient on solubility and stability, and the nature of the dosage form.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for the delivery of compounds of the present invention and methods for their preparation will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. Such compositions and methods for their preparation may be found, for example, in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences. 19th Edition (Mack Publishing Company, 1995).<br>
The compounds of the invention may be administered orally. Oral administration may involve swallowing, so that the compound enters the gastrointestinal tract, and/or buccal, lingual, or sublingual administration by which the compound enters the blood stream directly from the mouth.<br>

Liquid formulations include suspensions, solutions, syrups and elixirs. Such formulations may be employed as fillers in soft or hard capsules (made, for example, from gelatin or hydroxypropylmethylcellulose) and typically comprise a carrier, for example, water, ethanol, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, methylcellulose, or a suitable oil, and one or more emulsifying agents and/or suspending agents. Liquid formulations'may also be prepared by the reconstitution of a solid, for example, from a sachet.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be used in fast-dissolving, fast-disintegrating dosage forms such as those described In Expert Opinion in Therapeutic Patents, H (6), 981-986, by Liang and Chen (2001).<br>
For tablet dosage forms, depending on dose, the drug may make up from 1 weight % to 80 weight % of the dosage form, more typically from 5 weight % to 60 weight % of the dosage form. In addition to the drug, tablets generally contain a disintegrant. Examples of disintegrants include sodium starch glycolate, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, calcium carboxymethyl cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, crospovldone, polyvinylpyrrolidone, methyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, lower alkyl-substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose, starch, pregelatinised starch and sodium aiginate. Generally, the disintegrant will comprise from 1 weight % to 25 weight %, preferably from 5 weight % to 20 weight % of the dosage form.<br>
Binders are generally used to impart cohesive qualities to a tablet formulation. Suitable binders include microcrystalline cellulose, gelatin, sugars, polyethylene glycol, natural and synthetic gums, polyvinylpyrrolidone, pregelatinised starch, hydroxypropyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose. Tablets may also contain diluents, such as lactose (monohydrate, spray-dried monohydrate, anhydrous and the like), mannitol, xylitol, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol, microcrystalline cellulose, starch and dibasic calcium phosphate dihydrate.<br>
Tablets may also optionally comprise surface active agents, such as sodium lauryl sulfate and polysorbate 80, and glidants such as silicon dioxide and talc. When present, surface active<br>
agents may comprise from 0.2 weight % to 5 weight % of the tablet, and glidants may comprise from 0,2 weight % to 1 weight % of the tablet.<br>
Tablets also generally contain lubricants such as magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, zinc stearate, sodium stearyl fumarate, and mixtures of magnesium stearate with sodium lauryl sulphate. Lubricants generally comprise from 0.25 weight % to 10 weight %, preferably from 0.5 weight % to 3 weight % of the tablet.<br>
Other possible ingredients include anti-oxidants, colourants, flavouring agents, preservatives and taste-masking agents.<br>
Exemplary tablets contain up to about 80% drug, from about 10 weight % to about 90 weight % binder, from about 0 weight % to about 85 weight % diluent, from about 2 weight % to about 10 weight % disintegrant, and from about 0.25 weight % to about 10 weight % lubricant.<br>
Tablet blends may be compressed directly or by roller to form tablets. Tablet blends or portions of blends may alternatively be wet-, dry-, or melt-granulated, melt congealed, or extruded before tabletting. The final formulation may comprise one or more layers and may be coated or uncoated; it may even be encapsulated.<br>
The formulation of tablets is discussed in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Tablets. Vol. 1, by H. Lieberman and L Lachman'(Marcel Dekker, New York, 1980).<br>
Consumable oral films for human or veterinary use are typically pliable water-soluble or water-swellable thin film dosage forms which may be rapidly dissolving or mucoadhesive and typically comprise a compound of formula I, a film-forming polymer, a binder, a solvent, a humectant, a plasticiser, a stabiliser or emulsifier, a viscosity-modifying agent and a solvent. Some components of the formulation may perform more than one function.<br>
The compound of formula (I) may be water-soluble or insoluble. A water-soluble compound typically comprises from 1 weight % to 80 weight %, more typically from 20 weight % to 50 weight %, of the solutes. Less soluble compounds may comprise a greater proportion of the composition, typically up to 88 weight % of the solutes. Alternatively, the compound of formula (I) may be in the form of multiparticulate beads.<br>
The film-forming polymer may be selected from natural polysaccharides, proteins, or synthetic hydrocollolds and is typically present in the range 0.01 to 99 weight %, more typically in the range 30 to 80 weight %.<br>
Other possible ingredients include anti-oxldants, colorants, flavourings and flavour enhancers, preservatives, salivary stimulating agents, cooling agents, co-solvents (including oils), emollients, bulking agents, anti-foaming agents, surfactants and taste-masking agents.<br>
Films in accordance with the invention are typically prepared by evaporative drying of thin aqueous films coated onto a peelable backing support or paper. This may be done in a drying oven or tunnel, typically a combined coaler dryer, or by freeze-drying or vacuuming.<br>
Solid formulations for oral administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations Include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release.<br>
Suitable modified release formulations for the purposes of the invention are described in US Patent No. 6,106,864. Details of other suitable release technologies such as high energy dispersions and osmotic and coated particles are to be found in Pharmaceutical Technology. On-line. 25(2), 1-14, by Verma et al (2001). The use of chewing gum to achieve controlled release is described in WO 00/35298.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be administered directly into the blood stream, into muscle, or into an internal organ. Suitable means for parenteral administration include intravenous, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, intrathecal, intraventricular, intraurethral, intrasternal, intracranial, intramuscular, intrasynovial and subcutaneous. Suitable devices for parenteral administration include needle (including microneedle) injectors, needle-free injectors and infusion techniques.<br>
Parenteral formulations are typically aqueous solutions which may contain excipients such as salts, carbohydrates and buffering agents (preferably to a pH of from 3 to 9), but, for some applications, they may be more suitably formulated as a sterile non-aqueous solution or as a dried form to be used in conjunction with a suitable vehicle such as sterile, pyrogen-free water.<br>
The preparation of parenteral formulations under sterile conditions, for example, by lyophilisation, may readily be accomplished using standard pharmaceutical techniques well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The solubility of compounds of formula (I) used in the preparation of parenteral solutions may be increased by the use of appropriate formulation techniques, such as the incorporation of solubility-enhancing agents.<br>
Formulations for parenteral administration may be formulated to be Immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release. Thus compounds of the invention may be formulated as a suspension or as a solid, semi-solid, or thixotropio liquid for administration as an implanted depot providing modified release of the active compound. Examples of such formulations include drug-coated stents and semi-solids and suspensions comprising drug-loaded poly(o7-lactic-coglycolic)acid (PGLA) microspheres.<br>

Liposomes may also be used. Typical carriers include alcohol, water, mineral oil, liquid petrolatum, white petrolatum, glycerin, polyethylene glycol and propylene glycol. Penetration enhancers may be incorporated - see, for example, J Pharm Sci, §8 (10), 955-958, by Finnin and Morgan (October 1999).<br>
Other means of topical administration include delivery by electroporation, iontophoresis, phonophoresis, sonophoresis and microneedle or needle-free (e.g. Powderject™, Bibject™, etc.) injection.<br>
Formulations for topical administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed-,, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release.<br>
The compounds of the invention can also be administered intranasally or by inhalation, typically in the form of a dry powder (either alone, as a mixture, for example, in a dry blend with lactose, or as a mixed component particle, for example, mixed with phospholipids, such as phosphatidylcholine) from a dry powder inhaler, as an aerosol spray from a pressurised container, pump, spray, atomiser (preferably an atomiser using electrohydrodynamics to produce a fine mist), or nebuliser, with or without the use of a suitable propellant, such as 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane or 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane, or as nasal drops. For intranasal use, the powder may comprise a bioadhesive agent, for example, chitosan or cyclodextrin.<br>
The pressurised container, pump,, spray, atomizer, or nebuliser contains a solution or suspension of the compound(s) of the invention comprising, for example, ethanol, aqueous ethanol, or a suitable alternative agent for dispersing, solubilislng, or extending release of the active, a propellant(s) as solvent and an optional surfactant, such as sorbitan trioleate, oleic acid, or an ollgolactic acid.<br>
Prior to use in a dry powder or suspension formulation, the drug product is micronised to a size suitable for delivery by inhalation (typically less than 5 microns). This may be achieved by any appropriate comminuting method, such as spiral jet milling, fluid bed jet milling, supercritical fluid processing to form nanoparticles, high pressure homogenisatlon, or spray drying.<br>
Capsules (made, for example, from gelatin or hydroxypropylmethylcellulose), blisters and cartridges for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated to contain a powder mix of the compound of the invention, a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch and a performance modifier such as /-leucine, mannitol, or magnesium stearate. The lactose may be anhydrous or In the form of the monohydrate, preferably the latter. Other suitable excipients include dextran, glucose, maltose, sorbitol, xylltol, fructose, sucrose and trehalose.<br>
A suitable solution formulation for use in an atomiser using electrohydrodynamics to produce a fine mist may contain from 1(jg to 20mg of the compound of the Invention per actuation and the actuation volume may vary from 1ul to 100ul. A typical formulation may comprise a compound of formula I, propylene glycol, sterile water, ethanol and sodium chloride. Alternative solvents which may be used instead of propylene glycol Include glycerol and polyethylene glycol.<br>
Suitable flavours, such as menthol and levomenthol, or sweeteners, such as saccharin or saccharin sodium, may be added to those formulations of the invention intended for Inhaled/intranasal administration.<br>
Formulations for inhaled/intranasal administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release using, for example, PGLA. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release.<br>
In the case of dry powder inhalers and aerosols, the dosage unit is determined by means of a valve which delivers a metered amount. Units in accordance with the Invention are typically arranged to administer a metered dose or "puff1 containing from O.OOImg to 10mg of the compound of formula (I). The overall daily dose will typically be In the range O.OOImg to 40mg which may be administered In a single dose or, more usually, as divided doses throughout the day.The compounds of formula (I) are particularly suitable for an administration by inhalation<br><br>
The compounds of the invention may be administered rectally or vaginally, for example, in the form of a suppository, pessary, or enema. Cocoa butter is a traditional suppository base, but various alternatives may be used as appropriate.<br>
Formulations for rectal/vaginal administration may be formulated to be Immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations Include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release.<br>
The compounds of the indention may also be administered directly to the eye or ear, typically in the form of drops of a mlcronised suspension or solution in isotonic, pH-adjusted, sterile saline. Other formulations suitable for ocular and aural administration include ointments, gels, biodegradable (e.g. absorbable gel sponges, collagen) and non-biodegradable (e.g. silicone) Implants, wafers, lenses and particulate or vesicular systems, such as niosomes or liposomes. A polymer such as crossed-linked poiyacrylic acid, polyvinylalcohol, hyaluronic acid, a cellulosic polymer, for example, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, or methyl cellulose, or a heteropolysaccharide polymer, for<br>
example,  gelan  gum,  may be incorporated together with  a  preservative,  such  as benzalkonium chloride. Such formulations may also be delivered by iontophoresis. Formulations for ocular/aural administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release.  Modified release formulations Include delayed-,  sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted, or programmed release.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be combined with soluble macromolecular entities, such as cyclodextrin and suitable derivatives thereof or polyethylene glycol-containing polymers, in order to improve their solubility, dissolution rate, taste-masking, bioavailability and/or stability for use in any of the aforementioned modes of administration.<br>
Drug-cyclodextrln complexes, for example, are found to be generally useful for most dosage forms and administration routes. Both inclusion and non-inclusion complexes may be used. As an alternative to direct complexation with the drug, the cyclodextrin may be used as an auxiliary additive, I.e. as a carrier, diluent, or solubiliser. Most commonly used for these purposes are alpha-, beta- and gamma-cyclodextrins, examples of which may be found in International Patent Applications Nos. WO 91/11172, WO 94/02518 and WO 98/55148.<br>
Inasmuch as it may desirable to administer a combination of active compounds, for example, for the purpose of treating a particular disease or condition, it is within the scope of the present invention that two or more pharmaceutical compositions, at least one of which contains a compound in accordance with the invention, may conveniently be combined in the form of a Kit suitable for coadministration of the compositions.<br>
Thus the kit of the invention comprises two or more separate pharmaceutical compositions, at least one of which contains a compound of formula (I) in accordance with the invention, and means for separately retaining said compositions, such as a container, divided bottle, or divided foil packet. An example of such a kit is the familiar blister pack used for the packaging of tablets, capsules and the like.<br>
The kit of the invention is particularly suitable for administering different dosage forms, for example, oral and parenteral, for administering the separate compositions at different dosage intervals, or for titrating the separate compositions against one another. To assist compliance, the kit typically comprises directions for administration and may be provided with a so-called memory aid.<br>
For administration to human patients, the total daily dose of the compounds of the invention is typically in the range 0.001 mg to 5000mg depending, of course, on the mode of administration. For example, oral administration may require a total dally, dose of from 0.1 mg to 1000mg, while an intravenous dose may only require from 0.001 mg to 100mg. The total dally dose may be administered in single or divided doses and may, at the physician's discretion, fall outside of the typical range given herein.<br>
These dosages are based on an average human subject having a weight of about 60kg to 70kg. The physician will readily be able to determine doses for subjects whose weight falls outside this range, such as infants and the elderly:<br>
For the avoidance of doubt, references herein to "treatment" include references to curative,, palliative and prophylactic treatment.<br>

Potency assay<br>
M3 potency was determined in CHO-K1 cells transfected with the NFAT-Betalactamase gene.<br>
CHO (Chinese Hamster Ovary) cells recombinantly expressing the human muscarinic M3<br>
receptor were transfected with the NFATJJ-Lac_Zeo plasmid.  Cells were grown in DMEM<br>
with Glutamax-1, supplemented with 25mM HEPES(Life Technologies 32430-027), containing<br>
10% PCS (Foetal Calf Serum; Sigma F-7524), 1nM Sodium pyruvate (Sigma S-8636), NEAA<br>
(non-Essential Amino Acids; Invitrogen 11140-035) and 200ng/ml Zeocln (Invitrogen R250-<br>

hMa B-Lac Assay Protocol<br>
Cells were harvested for assay when they reached 80-90% confluency using enzyme free cell<br>
Dissociation Solution (Life technologies 13151-014) incubated with the cells for 5 min at 37°C<br>
in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2.   Detached cells were collected in warmed growth<br>
media and centrifuged at 2000rpm for 10min, washed in PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline; Life Technologies 14190-094) and centrifuged again as just described. The cells were re-suspended at 2x105 cells/ml in growth medium (composition as described above). 20jj,l of this cell suspension was added to each well of a 384 well black clear bottomed plate (Greiner Bio One 781091-PFI). The assay buffer used was PBS supplemented with 0.05% Pluronic F-127 (Sigma 9003-11-6) and 2.5% DMSO. Muscarinic M3 receptor signalling was stimulated using 80nM carbamyl choline (Aldrich N240-9) incubated with the ceils for 4h at 37°C /5% C02 and monitored at the end of the incubation period using a Tecan SpectraFluor* plate reader (X -excitation 405nm, emission 450nm and 503nm). Ma receptor antagonists under test were added to the assay at the beginning of the 4h Incubation period and compound activity measured as the concentration dependent inhibition of the carbamyl choline induced signal. Inhibition curves were plotted and IC50 values generated using a 4-parameter sigmoid fit and converted to Ki values using the Cheng-Prusoff correction and the KD value for carbamyl choline In the assay.<br>
It has thus been found that carboxamide derivatives of formula (I) according to the present invention that have been tested in the above assay show Ms receptor antagonist activity as listed in the table below:<br><br>

Guinea Pig Trachea assay<br>
Male, Dunkin-Hartley guinea-pigs weighing 350-450g are culled in a rising concentration of C02, followed by exsanguinations of the vena cava. Tracheas are dissected from the larynx to the entry point into the chest cavity and then placed in fresh, oxygenated, modified Krebs buffer solution (Krebs containing 10uM propranolol, 10uM guanethidine and 3uM indomethacin) at room temperature. The tracheas are opened by cutting through the cartilage opposite the trachealis muscle. Strips approximately 3-5 cartilage rings wide are cut. A cotton thread is attached to the cartilage at one end of the strip for attachment to the force transducer and a cotton loop made at the other end to anchor the tissue In the organ bath. The strips are mounted In 5ml organ baths filled with warm (37°C) aerated modified Krebs. The pump flow rate is set to 1.0 ml/ mln and the tissues washed continuously. Tissues are placed under an initial tension of 1000mg. Tissues are re-tensioned after 15 and 30 minutes, then allowed to equilibrate for a further 30-45 minutes.<br>
Tissues are subjected to electrical field stimulation (EPS) of the following parameters: 10s trains every 2 minutes, 0.1ms pulse width, 10Hz and 10-30V. The voltage is raised 5V every 10min within the stated range until a maximum contractile response for each tissue is observed. This just maximum voltage for each tissue is then used throughout the remainder of the experiment. Following equilibration to EPS for 20min, the pump is stopped, and after 15min control readings are taken over a 8-10 min period (4-5 responses). Compound-is then added to each tissue as a bolus dose at 30xKi (determined at the human M3 receptor expressed in CHO cells in a filtration binding assay), and left to incubate for 2h. Compound is then washed from tissues using a rapid wash with modified Krebs for 1min and flow Is restored to 1 ml/min for the remainder of the experiment. At the end of the experiment tissues are challenged with histamine (1nM) to determine viability. Readings taken during the<br>
experiment are automatically collected using Notocord ® software. The raw data are converted into percent response taking into account measurements of inhibition of the EPS response. After starting washout, the times taken for the tissue to recover by 25% from the inhibition induced are recorded and used as a measure of compound duration of action. Tissue viability limits the duration of the experiment'to 16h post-compound washout. Compounds are typically tested at n=2 to 5 to estimate duration of action.<br>
Alternatively the following Guinea Pig Trachea assay can also be used:<br>
Trachea were removed from male Dunkin-Hartley guinea-pigs (wt 350-450g) and following removal of adherent connective tissue, an incision was made through the cartilage opposite the trachealis muscle and trachea! strips 3-5 cartilage rings wide prepared. The tracheal strips were suspended between an isometric strain gauge and a fixed tissue hook with the muscle in the horizontal plane in 5ml tissue baths under an Initial tension of 1g and bathed in warmed (37°C) aerated (95%O2/5%CO2) Krebs solution containing 3uM indomethacin and 10nM guanethidine. The tissues were positioned between parallel platinum wire electrodes (~1cm gap). A constant 1ml/mln flow of fresh Krebs solution (of the above composition) was maintained through the tissue baths using peristaltic pumps. The tissues were allowed to equilibrate for an hour with re-tensioning to 1g at 15min and 30min from the start of the equilibration period. At the end of the equilibration, tissues were electrically, field stimulated (EPS) using the following parameters: 10V, 10Hz 0.1ms pulse width with 10sec trains every 2 min. In each tissue a voltage response curve was constructed over the range 10v - 30V (keeping all other stimulation parameters constant) to determine a just maximal stimulation. Using these stimulation parameters EPS responses were 100% nerve mediated and 100% cholinergic as confirmed by blockade by 1uM tetrodotoxin or \\M atropine. Tissues were then repeatedly stimulated at 2 min intervals until the responses were reproducible. The peristaltic pump was stopped 20 min prior to the addition of the study compound and the average twitch contraction over the last 10min recorded as the control response. The study compound was added to the tissue baths, with each tissue receiving a single concentration of compound and allowed to equilibrate for 2h. At 2h post addition the inhibition of the EPS response was recorded and IC50 curves generated using a range of compound concentrations over tracheal strips from the same animal. The tissues were then rapidly washed and the 1ml/min perfusion with Krebs solution re-established. Tissues were stimulated for a further 16h and recovery of the EPS response recorded. At the end of the 16h, 10jiM histamine was added to the baths to confirm tissue viability. The just max concentration (tested concentration giving a response &gt; 70% inhibition but less than 100%) of antagonist was identified from the 1C50 curve and the time to 25% recovery of the induced inhibition (T2e) calculated in tissues receiving this concentration. Compounds are typically tested at n=2 to 5 to estimate duration of action.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
