				<td>Communication Parameter Adjustment System in an Internet-Compatible<br>
Bi directional Communication System<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention concerns a system for use in interactive bi-directional<br>
communication in a device such as a cable modem, computer, TV, VCR, or an<br>
associated peripheral device.<br>
Home entertainment systems that combine Personal Computer and<br>
television functions (PC/TV functions) are increasingly becoming generic, User<br>
interactive, multiple source and multiple destination communication devices. Such<br>
systems are required to communicate in different data formats between multiple<br>
locations for a variety of applications in response to User requests. For example, a<br>
system may receive data from satellite or terrestrial sources comprising High<br>
Definition Television (HDTV) broadcasts, Multi-point Microwave Distribution<br>
System (MMDS) broadcasts and Digital Video Broadcasts (DVB). A system may also<br>
receive and transmit data via telephone (e.g. the Internet) and coaxial lines (e.g. cable<br>
TV lines via a cable modem) and from both remote and local sources such as Digital<br>
Video Disk (DVD), CDROM, VHS and Digital VHS (DVHSâ„¢) type players, PCs,<br>
and many other types of sources.<br>
It is desirable for Internet compatible bi-directional communication<br>
systems that are used in conjunction with home entertainment systems to<br>
accommodate the network cable length and associated transmission power level<br>
variation occurring in a cable distribution network. This requirement and associated<br>
problems are addressed by a system according to the present invention.<br>
A system adaptively varies upstream transmission power level to<br>
prevent communication interruption in a cable modem network. A method for<br>
i adaptively adjusting communication operation by varying a transmission parameter<br>
involves retrieving a communication parameter from memory and comparing the<br>
retrieved parameter with a predetermined threshold. A message is transmitted to a<br>
CATV head-end at a remote site representing that the parameter value indicates<br>
adjustment of the parameter is necessary.<br>
Brief Description of the/Drawings<br>
In the drawing:<br>
Figure 1 shows a block diagram of a cable modem incorporating<br>
adaptive upstream transmission power level adjustment, according to the invention.<br>
Figure 2 shows a cable modem start up sequence, according to the<br>
invention.<br>
Figure 3 presents a flowchart of a method for adaptively adjusting<br>
i upstream transmission power level, according to the invention.<br>
Figure 1 shows a block diagram of a cable modem (e.g. DOCSIS<br>
standard compliant modem) capable of adaptively varying transmission power level of<br>
signals transmitted by the modem to the CATV head-end. The cable modem provides<br>
a communication bridge between a cable TV system and a PC (or another device such<br>
as a TV), for example. The modem communicates with the cable system head end via<br>
SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol). The disclosed power level<br>
adjustment system reduces cable modem service interruption for subscribers. This is<br>
accomplished by providing the cable operator with an "early warning" that the<br>
transmission power level is operating too close to a performance threshold and that, as<br>
a result, a service interruption may occur soon.<br>
The particular threshold concerned is a settled upstream transmit power<br>
level from the modem to the CATV head-end. Cable operator upstream path problems<br>
are a common cause of service interruption to subscribers due to improper upstream<br>
path gain or loss between particular cable modems in the cable network and the cable<br>
operator head-end. This problem may be caused, for example, by technician mis-<br>
adjustment of cable plant amplifiers and RF splitting or combining networks. The<br>
described cable modem system advantageously automatically senses and reports<br>
problems to a central cable operator network management station. Thereby the<br>
disclosed system operates with fewer subscriber service interruptions, improves<br>
system up-time, and forestalls out-of-service conditions by detecting and correcting<br>
such conditions before they result in subscriber service interruption.<br>
The exemplary embodiment of Figure 1 supports cable modem<br>
communication and decoding of data in hierarchically arranged protocols including<br>
TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol), Ethernet and MPEG<br>
(Motion Picture Experts Group) protocols (e.g. per MPEG2 ISO/TEC 13818-1 of 10th<br>
June 1994, and ISO/IEC 13818-2, of 20th January 1995). In addition, the system of<br>
Figure 1 is compatible with the Multimedia Cable Networks Systems (MCNS)<br>
preliminary requirements and DOCSIS 1.0 (Data Over Cable Service Interface<br>
Specification 1.0) requirements ratified by the International Telecommunications<br>
Union (ITU) March 1998 and associated EuroDOCSIS requirements and other<br>
documents provided by the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) RFCs (Requests<br>
For Comment) such as RFC 2669. The RFC documents are available via the Internet<br>
and are prepared by Internet standards working groups.<br>
The principles of the invention may be applied to any bi-directional<br>
communication system and are not restricted to cable, ADSL, ISDN, conventional<br>
type modems or DOCSIS compatible modems. Further, the disclosed system<br>
processes Internet Protocol (IP) data from a variety of Internet sources including<br>
streamed video or audio data, telephone messages, computer programs, Emails or<br>
other packetized data and communications, for example.<br>
The cable modem (system 12) of Figure 1 communicates with a CATV<br>
head-end over a bi-directional broadband high speed RF link on line 10 which<br>
typically consists of coaxial cable or hybrid fiber/coax (HFC). The modem system 12<br>
bi-directionally communicates with devices located at a User site over local area<br>
networks (LANs). Typical User-side local area networks include Digital/Intel/Xerox<br>
Ethernet compatible networks attached via connector 72. Other User-side devices<br>
communicate via a Universal Serial Bus (USB) or HPNA (Home Phone Line Network<br>
Association) compatible networks attached via connectors 82 and 77 respectively.<br>
User devices attached on the Ethernet, HPNA and USB networks may include<br>
equipment such as personal computers (PCs), network printers, video receivers, audio<br>
receivers, VCRs, DVDs, scanners, copiers, telephones, fax machines and home<br>
appliances, for example.<br>
In operation, diplexer 20 of cable modem system 12 of Figure 1<br>
separates upstream communications (sent from modem 12 to a CATV head-end) from<br>
downstream communications (sent from a CATV head-end to modem 12) conveyed<br>
via cable line 10. Diplexer 20 separates upstream data from downstream data based on the different frequency ranges that the upstream data (typically 5-42 MHz) and<br>
downstream data (typically 88 - 860 MHz) respectively employ. Controller 60<br>
configures the elements of cable modem 12 of Figure 1 to receive DOCSIS/MPEG2<br>
transport data from the CATV head-end on cable line 10 and to convert the data to<br>
Ethernet, USB or HPNA compatible format for output via ports 72, 82 and 77<br>
respectively. Similarly, controller 60 configures the elements of cable modem 12 of<br>
Figure 1 to receive Ethernet, USB or HPNA compatible data from ports 72, 82 and 77<br>
and to convert and transmit DOCSIS transport protocol data to the CATV head-end<br>
on cable line 10. Controller 60 configures the elements of system 12 through the<br>
setting of control register values within these elements using a bi-directional data and<br>
control signal bus. Specifically, controller 60 configures tuner 15, saw filter 25,<br>
differential amplifier 30 and MCNS (Multimedia Cable Networks Systems) interface<br>
device 35 to receive a DOCSIS formatted signal on a previously identified RF channel<br>
frequency. The DOCSIS formatted signal comprises an MPEG2 transport protocol<br>
format conveying Ethernet compatible data frames including IP data content.<br>
Controller 60 employs the process shown in Figure 2 for initializing<br>
system 12 of Figure 1 and for selecting an initial power transmission level for<br>
transmitting of signals from system 12 to the CATV head end. Specifically, Figure 2<br>
shows a series of operational states through which the Figure 1 DOCSIS compliant<br>
cable modem system 12 progresses during startup to become fully operational. Upon<br>
application of power to modem system 12 in step 250 of Figure 2, controller 60<br>
executes bootloader software uploaded from flash memory within unit 60 to set all<br>
modem components to their initial power on condition. In step 255 of Figure 2,<br>
controller 60 (Figure 1) directs system 12 in determining the RF channel frequency<br>
that tuner 15 is to be configured to receive by iteratively tuning to successive<br>
candidate RF channel frequencies until a DOCSIS compliant signal is obtained.<br>
Controller 60 recognizes a DOCSIS compliant signal on a candidate channel through<br>
the successful decode by MCNS interface processor 35 of the received data and<br>
through a correspondingly acceptable error rate for the decoded data.<br>
In step 260 of Figure 2, controller 60 initiates Ranging by directing<br>
system 12 in transmitting data upstream to the CATV head-end using MCNS interface<br>
35, amplifier 85 and RF transformer 87. The Ranging function involves adaptively<br>
and iteratively adjusting upstream and downstream communication parameters<br>
including cable modem transmission power level and timing offset. Specifically,<br>
system 12 incrementally increases the power level of signals conveying status<br>
messages periodically transmitted to the CATV head end. This is done until system 12<br>
receives an acknowledgement from the CATV head end indicating that the messages<br>
are successfully received. The CATV head-end determines when Ranging is<br>
completed and communicates that Ranging is terminated to system 12. At completion<br>
of Ranging, communication between system 12 and the CATV head-end involving<br>
Media Access Control (MAC) layer protocol is established.<br>
In step 265 of Figure 2, controller 60 initiates Connecting by directing<br>
 system 12 in establishing bi-directional communication between modem system 12<br>
and the CATV head-end involving DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)<br>
communication with a remote DHCP server. Specifically, the system 12 IP (Internet<br>
Protocol) address and other configuration parameters are acquired from the DHCP<br>
server and stored in memory within unit 60. Upon successful completion of the<br>
Connecting process, the cable modem is operable as an Internet host, and has an<br>
assigned IP address.<br>
In step 270 of Figure 2, controller 60 initiates Configuring by acquiring<br>
the date and time from a remote internet TIME server using internet TIME protocol<br>
and by downloading a Configuration File for modem system 12 from a remote TFTP<br>
(Trivial File Transfer Protocol) server using TFTP. The configuration file includes<br>
SNMP compatible data conveying threshold values defining warning zones near the<br>
minimum and/or maximum operational limits for the power level to be used in<br>
transmitting signals from system 12 to the CATV head end. System 12 sends alert<br>
messages to the CATV head end if the transmission power level used by system 12<br>
exceeds these threshold values and the power level lies within a warning zone. SNMP<br>
messages may also be used to activate and deactivate the alert messages and threshold<br>
comparison mechanism and to adjust thresholds and message repetition rate after<br>
initialization or at other times of modem operation. The configuration file SNMP data<br>
may also determine the repetition frequency at which alert messages (including the<br>
actual power level value employed by system 12) are transmitted to the CATV head<br>
end. The DOCSIS standard allows parameters such as the transmission power level<br>
threshold values and alert message repetition frequency to be incorporated into the<br>
mandatory configuration file that a cable modem downloads during its startup.<br>
Thereby the threshold and repetition frequency values may be advantageously set<br>
automatically each time a cable modem is installed and performs its DOCSIS<br>
initialization routine. If no threshold values or alert message repetition data is<br>
provided in the configuration file then predetermined default settings contained in<br>
system 12 memory are used. Upon completion of the Configuring operation, modem<br>
system 12 has received and stored sufficient information to become operational and is<br>
in condition to receive a signal from the CATV head-end to initiate becoming fully<br>
on-line and operational.<br>
In step 275 of Figure 2, controller 60 initiates Registering by directing<br>
system 12 in communicating key configuration parameters applied by the modem<br>
system 12 to the CATV head-end for final acceptance. The CATV head-end compares<br>
the configuration parameters employed by system 12 with the configuration<br>
parameters previously supplied from the CATV head-end to system 12. Upon<br>
determining that they match, the CATV head-end notifies system 12 that registration<br>
is completed and that system 12 is on-line and operational. The process of Figure 2 is<br>
complete at step 280.<br>
Figure 3 shows a flowchart of a method for use by system 12 (Figure 1)<br>
for monitoring the upstream transmitter power level of a DOCSIS-compliant cable<br>
modem and for automatically sending a warning at predetermined intervals to a<br>
CATV listening network management station if a settled power level falls outside a<br>
range of acceptable values. The DOCSIS standard requires that a compliant cable<br>
modem supports Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) as well as related<br>
software procedures and virtual data stores of cable modem operating information<br>
termed Management Information Bases (MIBs). The MIBs allow remote management<br>
of cable modem operations by a management station, operated from the cable head-<br>
end, or by a network operations center controlled by an Internet service provider, for<br>
example. Further, some MIBs may be defined by a modem provider. The method of<br>
Figure 3 is implemented in the form of a collection of settable MIB objects executed<br>
by controller 60 (Figure 1).<br>
In step 205 of Figure 3, following the start at step 200, if no power<br>
threshold values or alert message repetition data is provided in the configuration file<br>
received during initialization, controller 60 configures system 12 with default values.<br>
The power threshold values determine alert thresholds for the power level used in<br>
communicating signals from system 12 to the CATV head end. Also the repetition<br>
data determines the frequency at which alert messages (including the actual power<br>
level value employed by system 12) are transmitted to the CATV head end. The<br>
default values may be predetermined by a modem provider and may be viewed (or<br>
may be set in non-DOCSIS compatible applications) by User operation of an attached<br>
PC (e.g. attached to port 72 - Figure 1) through a private MIB. In step 210, the power<br>
 threshold values or alert message repetition data, in use by system 12, may be<br>
accessed and viewed on a web page generated by system 12 for display on an attached<br>
PC in response to a User command via the PC. The displayed web page may be<br>
employed as the User interface supporting User viewing of these values and also, in<br>
non-DOCSIS compatible applications, the selection and update of these values.<br>
                        In step 215, controller 60 periodically reads the current upstream<br>
transmit power level and in step 220, compares this power level with the thresholds<br>
previously obtained in step 205. In another embodiment, the period at which this<br>
comparison is made may also be defined by a User via a configuration file or default<br>
setting or by User data entry via an attached PC. If the comparison indicates that the<br>
 power level is in a warning zone, i.e. is at or above a maximum threshold, or is at or<br>
below a minimum threshold, controller 60 initiates sending of an alert message to the<br><br>
CATV head end in step 225. The thresholds may be selected, for example, so that an<br>
alert message is generated if the settled operating cable modem upstream transmit<br>
power is 10 dBmV or below (compared to a DOCSIS specified minimum of 8 dBmV)<br>
or 54dBmV or above (compared to a DOCSIS specified maximum of 58 dBmV). The<br>
alert message is automatically sent to the CATV head end as a SNMP compatible<br>
message (termed a Trap) at a repetition frequency (e.g. every 3 minutes) defined by<br>
the configuration repetition data obtained in step 205. The message is repeated until<br>
cable system adjustments are made that result in clearance of the condition causing<br>
the alert message. Once this occurs controller 60 periodically executes steps 215 and<br>
220 and the alert message transmissions generated in step 225 cease. The frequency at<br>
which the power level is checked in steps 215 and 220 is determined by a<br>
configuration file parameter, or by a default value. Note, a Trap is an SNMP message<br>
type defined in the SNMP protocol that can be launched by a networking device (e.g.<br>
a cable modem) to a CATV head-end (e.g. a cable operator"s central monitoring<br>
station) at any time the network device deems necessary.<br>
In normal operation, the upstream transmission power level of system<br>
12 of Figure 1 is within defined thresholds and no alert message is generated. In<br>
normal operation, an RF carrier is modulated with MPEG2 transport protocol data<br>
using 64 or 256 QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation). The MPEG2 transport<br>
data includes Ethernet formatted data which in turn includes IP data representing a<br>
User requested HTML (HyperText Mark-Up Language) web page, for example. The<br>
MPEG transport data is provided by diplexer 20 to tuner 15. Tuner 15 down-converts<br>
the input signal from diplexer 20 to a lower frequency band which is filtered by saw<br>
filter 25 to enhance signal isolation from neighboring RF channels. The filtered signal<br>
from unit 25 is level shifted and buffered by differential amplifier 30 to provide a<br>
signal compatible with MCNS interface processor 35. The resultant down converted, level-shifted signal from amplifier 30 is demodulated by MCNS processor 35. This<br>
demodulated data is further trellis decoded, mapped into byte aligned data segments,<br>
deinterleaved and Reed-Solomon error corrected within processor 35.; Trellis<br>
decoding, deinterleaving and Reed-Solomon error correction are known functions<br>
described, for example, in the reference text Digital Communication, Lee and<br>
Messerschmidt (Kluwer Academic Press, Boston, MA, USA, 1988). Processor 35<br>
further converts the MPEG2 format data to Ethernet data frames that are provided to<br>
controller 60.<br>
Controller 60 parses and filters the Ethernet compatible data from unit<br>
35 using filters configured from the CATV head-end. The filters implemented by<br>
controller 60 match data identifiers in incoming Ethernet frame packets provided by<br><br>
unit 35 with identifier values pre-loaded from the CATV head-end. The identifier<br>
values are pre-loaded during the previously performed initialization operation. By this<br>
means controller 60 implements a data admission control function forwarding selected<br>
data to local LAN devices and discarding other selected data content. This<br>
configurable filter system may be advantageously used to filter data based on<br>
metadata items in the incoming data for a variety of purposes including based on, (a)<br>
content rating for parental or other blocking control, (b) predetermined User<br>
preferences for targeting advertisements and "push-content", (c) firewall filtering, (d)<br>
identity of source, and (e) a data search function. The filtered Ethernet compatible<br>
serial data is communicated to a PC via Ethernet interface 65, filter and isolation<br>
transformer 70 and port 72. Interface 65 buffers and conditions the data from<br>
controller 60 for filtering and transforming by unit 70 for output to a PC via port 72.<br>
In similar fashion, controller 60 converts and filters data (conveyed in<br>
Ethernet MAC frames) from processor 35 for output in USB format via port 82 or in<br>
HPNA format via port 77. The USB data is buffered by transceiver 75 and filtered by<br>
noise and interference suppression (EMI/ESD) filter 80 prior to output to USB<br>
compatible LAN devices connected to port 82. Similarly, the HPNA data is<br>
conditioned by interface 62 and buffered by transceiver amplifier 67 prior to output to<br>
HPNA compatible LAN devices connected to port 77.<br>
Modem system 12 communicates data upstream from an attached PC,<br>
for example, to a CATV head-end using a transmission power level selected during<br>
the initialization routine. For this purpose, controller 60 of system 12 receives<br>
Ethernet compatible data from the attached PC via port 72, interface 65 and<br>
filter/isolation transformer 70 and provides it to processor 35. Processor 35 modulates<br>
an RF carrier with the received Ethernet format data using 16 QAM or QPSK<br>
(Quadrature Phase Shift Keying Modulation). The resultant modulated data is time<br>
division multiplexed onto cable line 10 for upstream communication via amplifier 85,<br>
transformer 87 and diplexer 20. Amplifier 85 outputs the data to the CATV head-end<br>
with an appropriate power level selected in the previously described initialization<br>
process. Transformer 87 provides a degree of fault and noise isolation in the event of a<br>
failure in the modem 12 or upon the occurrence of locally generated noise in the<br>
modem or in attached devices.<br>
In similar fashion, modem system 12 also communicates data upstream<br>
from devices attached via USB port 82 or via HPNA port 77. In an exemplary<br>
implementation, controller 60 of system 12 receives Ethernet compatible data from<br>
transceiver 75 and provides it to processor 35 for upstream communication in the<br>
manner previously described. For this purpose, transceiver 75 receives Ethernet data<br>
encapsulated within USB frames from port 82 via filter 80 and removes the USB<br>
frame data to provide Ethernet format data to controller 60. Similarly, interface 62<br>
receives data encapsulated in HPNA format from port 77 via transceiver 67 and<br>
provides Ethernet format data to controller 60.<br>
Controller 60 is also responsive to on/off and reset switch 90 and<br>
performs a variety of functions in addition to those already described. Controller 60<br>
configures modem 12 parameters using configuration information provided from a<br>
CATV head-end. Controller 60 also directs system 12 in synchronizing and<br>
multiplexing upstream communication onto cable line 10 and implements a rate limit<br>
in controlling upstream data traffic. Further, controller 60 bi-directionally filters<br>
received data and provides selected data to either the CATV head-end or LAN devices<br>
attached to ports 72, 77 and 82. Controller 60 also supports data ranging<br>
communication with the CATV head-end. The ranging communication is initiated by<br>
the CATV head-end and comprises the continuous but intermittent polling of<br>
individual modems to determine status and to identify modem or line failures.<br>
The architecture of the system of Figure 1 is not exclusive. Other<br>
architectures may be derived in accordance with the principles of the invention to<br>
accomplish the same objectives. Further, the functions of the elements of the cable<br>
modem system 12 and the process steps of Figure 3 may be implemented in whole or<br>
in part within the programmed instructions of controller 60. In addition, the principles<br>
of the invention may be applied in monitoring and threshold comparison of any<br>
communication parameters subject to iterative adjustment in an Internet compatible<br>
bi-directional communication system not just upstream transmission power level. The<br>
principles also apply in launching warning messages related to such parameters.<br>

bi-directionally communicating with a remote site, the mean comprising<br>
the steps of:<br>
retrieving a communication parameter value from a memory;<br>
comparing said retrieved parameter with a predetermined threshold to<br>
identify an excessive communication parameter value indicative of a<br>
potential communication link impairment; and<br>
initiating substantially periodic transmission of a message to said remote<br>
site indicating a system adjustment is necessary, in response to said<br>
comparison.<br>
2.   A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein said message comprises said<br>
parameter value.<br>
3.   A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein said parameter represents<br>
transmission upstream power level for communicating from said device to<br>
said remote site.<br>
4.   A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein said device is a cable modem<br>
and said transmission uses simple network management (SNMP) and<br>
comprising the step of<br>
comparing said retrieved parameter with minimum and maximum<br>
predetermined threshold values.<br>
5.   A method as claimed In claim 1, comprising the step of receiving said<br>
predetermined threshold value from said remote site.<br>
6.   A method as claimed in claim 5, comprising the step or using a aeraunt<br>
predetermined threshold value prior to said receiving of said<br>
predetermined threshold value from said remote site.<br>
7.   A method as claimed in claim 5, comprising the step of configuring said<br>
device with said received predetermined threshold during an initialization<br>
operation.<br>
8.   A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein said step of initiating<br>
substantially periodic transmission of said message comprises initiating<br>
transmission on one of, (a) a schedule, and (b) a repetition frequency,<br>
received from said remote site.<br>
9.   A method as claimed in claim 1, comprising the step of using one of a<br>
default schedule and repetition frequency values prior to receiving said<br>
schedule and repetition frequency values from said remote site.<br>
10. A method as claimed in claim 1, comprising the step of terminating<br>
transmission of said message upon said comparison step indicating said<br>
retrieved parameter no longer exceeds said predetermined threshold.<br>
11. A method as claimed in claim 1, comprising the step of displaying at least<br>
one of, (a) said parameter, (b) said predetermined threshold and (c)<br>
repetition frequency of said periodic transmission, in response to User<br>
command.<br>
12. A method as claimed in claim 11, comprising fhe step of generation a web<br>
page for said displaying of said at least one of, (a) said parameter, (b)<br>
said predetermined threshold and (c) repetition frequency of said periodic<br>
transmission.<br>
13. A method for providing warning of impaired communication, in a modem<br>
device for bi-directionally communicating with a remote site, the method<br>
comprising the steps of:<br>
retrieving a transmission power level value from a memory;<br>
comparing said retrieved transmission power level value with a<br>
predetermined threshold to identify an excessive transmission power level<br>
value indicative of a potential communication link impairment; and<br>
initiating substantially periodic transmission of a message having including<br>
said transmission power level to said remote site indicating a system<br>
adjustment is necessary, in response to said comprison.<br>
14. A method as claimed in claim 13, comprising the   step   of terminating<br>
transmission of said message upon said comparison   step   indicating said<br>
transmission power level value no longer exceeds   said   predetermined<br>
threshold.<br>
This invention relates to a method for providing warning of impaired<br>
communication in a device for bi-directionally communicating with a remote site,<br>
the method comprising: retrieving a communication parameter value from a<br>
memory; comparing said retrieved parameter with a predetermined threshold to<br>
identify an excessive communication parameter value indicative of a potential<br>
communication link impairment; and initiating substantially periodic transmission<br>
of a message to said remote site indicating a system adjustment is necessary, in<br>
response to said comparison.</td>
