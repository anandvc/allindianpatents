				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a novel type of method of producing substituted 2-nitro-guanidine and nitroenamine derivatives-<br>
It is known that in order to produce substituted nitroguanidines, nitroenamines or cyano-enamines, a further substituent may be introduced (e.g. by alkylation) into those compounds that may already be substituted once to several times (see e.g. EP patent application 0.375.907), Owing to the presence of several hydrogen atoms in the educts used as the starting materia! in these reactions, the previously proposed substitution reactions of this kind are often non-selective and lead to undesired substitution products. The afore¬mentioned EP patent applications describe by way of example the production of 1,3-disubstituted 2-nitroguanidines by reacting monosubstituted nitroisothioureas with primary amines whilst cleaving mercaptan. However, these nitroisothiourea compounds, containing alkyithio leaving groups, which are proposed as starting compounds in the known processes, can only be obtained with difficulty. In EP-A-0-483.062, a process for the production of the compounds of formula (I) by hydrolysis of hexahydro-triazines is also described.<br>
It has now been shown that the above-described methods of producing compounds of formula (!) do not satisfy the requirements demanded of a chemical production process, such as availability, toxicity, stability in storage and purity of the starting materials and excipients, reaction time, energy consumption and volumes yielded by the process, quantity and recovery of the accruing by-products and waste products, as well as purity and yield of the end product. There is therefore a need to provide improved methods of producing these compounds.<br>
Accordingly, it is the aim of the present invention to provide an improved method of	^<br>
producing substituted 2-nitroguanidines, 2-nitroenamines, 2-cyanoenamines and 2-cyano-amines from readily obtainable starting compounds, which allows specific substitution without obtaining major amounts of undesired by-products.<br><br><br><br>
The compounds of formula (I) may be present partly in the form of tautomers. Accordingly, any reference to compounds of formula (I) hereinbefore and hereinafter is understood to include also their corresponding tautomers, even if the latter are not specifically mentioned in each case.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) and, where appropriate, the E/Z isomers and tautomers there¬of, may be present as salts. Compounds of formula (1) having at least one basic centre may form e.g. acid addition salts. These are formed for example with strong inorganic acids, such as mineral acids, e.g. sulphuric acid, a phosphoric acid or a hydrohalic acid, with strong organic carboxylic acids, such as Ci-Cialkanecarboxylic acids substituted where appropriate for example by halogen, e.g. acetic acid, such as optionally unsaturated dicarboxylic acids, e.g. oxalic, malonic, maleic, fumaric or phthaltc acid, such as hydroxycarboxylic acids, e.g. ascorbic, lactic, malic, tartaric or citric acid, or benzoic acid, or with organic sulphonic acids, such as Ci-C4alkanesulphonic or arylsulphonic acids substituted where appropriate for example by halogen, e.g. methanesulphonic or p-toluenesulphonic acid. Salts of compounds of formula (I) with acids of the said kind are preferably obtained when working up the reaction mixtures.<br>
In a broader sense, compounds of formula (1} with at least one acid group can form salts with bases: Suitable salts with bases are for example metal salts, such as alkali or alkaline earth metal salts, e.g. sodium, potassium or magnesium salts, or salts with ammonia or an organic amine, such as morpholine, piperidine, pyrrolidine, a mono-, di- or tri-lower alkylamine, e.g. ethyl-, diethyl-, triethyl- or dimethylpropyiamine, or a mono-, di- or trihydroxy-lower alkylamine, e.g. mono-, di- or triethanolamine. Corresponding internal salts where appropriate may also be formed. Preferred compounds within the scope of this invention are agrochemically advantageous salts. Hereinbefore and hereinafter, the free compounds of formula (I) are understood where appropriate to include also by analogy the corresponding<br><br>
salts, and the salts are understood to include also the free compounds of formula (I). The same applies to E/Z isomers and tautomers of compounds of formula (I) and salts thereof. The free form is preferred.<br>
In the definition of formulae (1) to (II!) given above and below, the individual generic terms are to be understood as follows-.<br>
Halogen signifies fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine, whereby fluorine, chlorine and bromine are preferred, especially chlorine- Halogen in this context is understood to be an independent substituent or part of a subsfituent, such as in halogenalkyi, halogenalkylthio, halogenalkoxy, halogencycloalkyi, halogenalkenyl, halogenalkinyl, halogenallyloxy or halogenallylthio- Alkyl, alkylthio. aikenyl, aikinyl and alkoxy radicals may be straight-chained or branched.

If the defined alkyl, alkoxy, aikenyl, aikinyl or cycloalkyl groups are substituted by other substituents, they may be substituted once or many times by identical or different<br><br>
substituents from those listed. In the substituted groups, it is preferable for one or two further substituents to be present. CydoalkyI is cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl or cyclohexyl.<br>
Aryl signifies phenyl, naphthyl, phenanthrenyl or anthracenyl, especially phenyl.<br>
In the context of the present invention, a heteroaryl radical preferably signifies a 5- to 7-membered, aromatic or non-aromatic ring with one to three hetero atoms selected from the group comprising N. O and S. Preference is given to aromatic 5- and 6-rings, which have   , a nitrogen atom as the hetero atom and optionally one further hetero atom, preferably nitrogen, oxygen or sulphur, especially nitrogen,<br>

184 g of 100% 3-methyl-4-nitroimino-perhydro-1,3,5-oxadiazine in 400 g of dimethyl carbonate are placed in a sulphonation flask, and 168 g of 100% 2-chloro-5-chloromethyl-thiazole (1.0 moles) are added as a melt- This mixture is heated to 65°C. A mixture consisting of 350 g of dimethyl carbonate, 4 g of tetramethylammonium hydroxide pentahydrate and 242 g of potassium carbonate powder is measured in whilst stirring over 60 minutes at 62 to 68°C.<br>
The reaction mixture is held for 5 to 6 hours whilst stirring vigorously, until more than 99% of the 2-chloro-5-chloromethylthiazole has reacted (LC control).<br>
The reaction mixture is subsequently cooled to 45-50°C and mixed with 600 g of water. The reaction mixture is adjusted to pH 6.5 with ca, 260 g of 32% hydrochloric acid and is then heated to 60 to 65°C until everything dissolves.
