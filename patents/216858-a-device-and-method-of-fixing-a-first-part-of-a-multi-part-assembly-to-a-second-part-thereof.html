A FIXATION DEVICE<br>
Related Application<br>
The present application claims priority from UK patent application<br>
No. 0301366.1 filed 21 January 2003, the entire content of which is hereby<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present Invention relates to a fixation device which is for fixing<br>
together two parts of a multi-part assembly and which has a ring-like body,<br>
hereinafter a "fixation device of the type defined"-<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
A fixation device of the type defined is disclosed in WO-A-0128887<br>
(Glaxo/Brand et al) for connecting a device housing to the business end of<br>
an aerosol canister, the entire content of which publication is hereby<br>
incorporated herein by reference. The device housing is for housing a<br>
mechanical or electrical device which is to be used with the canister, for<br>
instance an actuation Indicator, such as of the type disclosed in WO-A-<br>
9856444 (Glaxo/Rand et al) or a sensor.<br>
As shown in FIGURES Ja and Jb of the accompanying drawings,<br>
the fixation device I of WO-A-0128887 has a ring-like body 3 of generally<br>
C-shape due to the body 3 having an axial split 5. The fixation device I is<br>
integrally formed with the split 5 in the body 3. However, whan the fixation<br>
device   I  is mass produced the fixation devices  I  tend to become<br><br>
WO 2004/065224                                                                                                         PCT/EP2004/000663<br>
entangled with one another on the production line (e.g. in bowl feeders)<br>
due to them being integrally formed with the split 5 in the body 3.<br>
The aim of the present invention is to provide a fixation device of<br>
the type defined which alleviates the problem of entanglement.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
According to the present Invention there is provided a fixation<br>
device of the type defined in which the ring-like body is movable from a<br>
manufactured state, in which the body is manufactured with an endless<br>
angular extent and a weakened zone therein, and a use state, in which the<br>
ring-like body is split at the weakened zone.<br>
Thus, the problem of entanglement is overcome due to the body<br>
being manufactured with an endless angular extent. The split is formed at<br>
a later stage through provision of the weakened zone, for instance after a<br>
bowl feeder step in an automated production line process.<br>
To move the body from the manufactured state to the use state, the<br>
weakened zone may be such that the split is formed by applying a radial<br>
force on the body, e.g. a radially outward (tensile) force or a radially<br>
inward (compressive) force.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, such as hereinafter described,<br>
the fixation device is of a plastics material, for instance made by a<br>
moulding process, such as injection moulding or the like.<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2004/065224                                                                                                         PCT/EP2004/000663<br>
in an embodiment of the invention, such as hereinafter described,<br>
the fixation device is integrally formed with the weakened zone. For<br>
instance, the fixation device is moulded with the weakened zone formed<br>
therein.<br>
The fixation device may consist of the ring-like body.<br>
The weakened zone may be a structural discontinuity in the body,<br>
e.g. a notch, or a frangible seam, etc.<br>
Preferably, the body has a generally C-shape in the use state.<br>
Further preferably, the body is of curvilinear form, for instance<br>
generally circular. The body may instead have a polygonal shape, e.g.<br>
square, hexagonal etc. Typically, the cross-sectional shape of the body is<br>
complementary to the cross-sectional shape of the surfaces of the first<br>
and second parts of the assembly between which the fixation device is to<br>
be interposed.<br>
Preferably, the split allows the body to be radially expanded when<br>
in its use state. More preferably, the body is reversibly radially<br>
expandable when in its use state, e.g. the body is resilient so that it has a<br>
biasing force which biases the body to a radially contracted configuration.<br>
These features enable the fixation device to be custom fitted on one of the<br>
assembly parts.<br>
According to a second aspect of the invention there is provided a<br>
system comprising a first part of a multi-part assembly, a second part of<br>
the assembly and a fixation device according to the first aspect for fixing<br>
the first and second parts together.<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2004/065224                                                                                                         PCT/EP2004/000663<br>
According to a third aspect of the invention there is provided a<br>
system according to the second aspect in which the fixation device is in its<br>
use state interposed between the first and second parts to fix them<br>
together.<br>
The fixation device is preferably wedged between the first and<br>
second parts.<br>
The fixation device may be interposed between an outer surface of<br>
the first part and an inner surface of the second part.<br>
The outer surface of the first part is preferably a re-entrant surface.<br>
More preferably, the re-entrant surface is presented by a neck or waist of<br>
the first part, in other words the outer surface is a flaring or tapering<br>
surface.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the inner surface of the second part<br>
is a re-entrant surface, e.g. a flaring or tapering surface.<br>
Further preferably, the inner surface is presented by a skirt of the<br>
second part which extends about the outer surface of the first part.<br>
Preferably, the first part has a longitudinal axis and the fixation<br>
device prevents removal of the second part from the first part in a first<br>
axial direction. To this end, the outer surface of the first part may<br>
flare/taper laterally outvardly in the first direction. In the alternative<br>
embodiment, the inner surface of the second part may flare/taper laterally<br>
inwardly in the first direction.<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2004/065224                                                                                                         PCT/EP2004/000663<br>
The first and second parts may each have an abutment surface in<br>
abutting relation to prevent the second part being removed from the first<br>
part in a second axial direction. The abutment surface of the first part is<br>
thus axially spaced from the outer surface in the first direction, and may be<br>
an end surface of the first part. The inner surface of the second part may<br>
be a first inner surface with the abutment surface of the second part being<br>
a second inner surface which extends laterally to the first inner surface.<br>
Typically, the ring-like body has radially spaced-apart inner and<br>
outer circumferential surfaces. Preferably, the inner circumferential<br>
surface of the body bears against the outer surface of the first part and the<br>
outer circumferential surface bears against the inner surface of the second<br>
part. More preferably, the inner circumferential surface has a<br>
complementary profile to that of the outer surface of the first part.<br>
Preferably, the outer circumferential surface of the body is<br>
conjoined to the inner surface of the second part, e.g. through a joint<br>
formed, for instance, by adhesive a weld or the like. An ultrasonic weld is<br>
particularly preferred. Alternatively, or additionally, the inner<br>
circumferential surface may be conjoined to the outer surface of the first<br>
part. This is particularly preferred where the inner surface, not the outer<br>
surface, is a re-entrant surface.<br>
The multi-part assembly may be a product dispenser with the first<br>
part a product container. The second part may be an accessory of the<br>
dispenser, e.g. in the form of a cap. The second part may have at least a<br>
part of an actuator mechanism for actuating the dispenser, or may, as in<br>
the exemplary embodiment hereinafter described, be an actuation<br>
indicator which indicates actuation of the dispenser, preferably by<br>
indicating the number of doses of the product dispensed or left for<br>
5<br><br>
WO 2004/065224                                                                                                         PCT/EP2004/000663<br>
dispensing   (a  dose  counter). The dispenser  may  be  a   medicament<br>
dispenser with the container containing a medicament.<br>
According to a fourth aspect of the invention there is provided a<br>
method of fixing a first part of a multi-part assembly to a second part<br>
thereof which comprises the steps of providing a fixation device which has<br>
a ring-like body manufactured with an endless angular extent, forming an<br>
axial split in the body and interposing the fixation device between the first<br>
and second parts such that the first and second parts are fixed together<br>
through the fixation device. The fixation device may correspond to that of<br>
the first aspect of the invention.<br>
The fixation device may be moved to the use state prior to being<br>
interposed between the first and second parts.<br>
The fixation device may be radially expanded to the use state by<br>
inserting a tapered structure into the body or by inserting a radially<br>
expandable structure into the body and then causing the radially<br>
expandable structure to radially expand.<br>
The first part may have a longitudinal axis, a lateral end surface.<br>
and a longitudinal side surface which extends towards the end surface in a<br>
first axial direction and which has a profile which tapers laterally outwardly<br>
in the first axial direction, and the second part has a longitudinal axis, a<br>
lateral surface and a longitudinal skirt, wherein the first and second parts<br>
are assembled with the axes aligned, the respective lateral surfaces in<br>
bearing relation and the skirt spaced laterally from the tapered profile of<br>
the longitudinal surface of the first part, and wherein the body of the<br>
fixation device is wedged in a radially expanded condition in the space<br>
between the skirt and the tapered profile.  The body of the fixation device<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2004/065224                                                                                                         PCT/EP2004/000663<br>
may be conjoined to the skirt and/or the tapered profile, preferably to the<br>
skirt.<br>
The first part may have a longitudinal axis, a lateral end surface,<br>
and a longitudinal side surface which extends towards the end surface in a<br>
first axial direction and which has a re-entrant section, and the second part<br>
has a longitudinal axis, a lateral surface and a longitudinal skirt, wherein<br>
the first and second parts are assembled with the axes aligned, the<br>
respective lateral surfaces in bearing relation to prevent removal of the<br>
second part from the first part in a second axial direction opposite to the<br>
first axial direction, and the skirt disposed adjacent the re-entrant section<br>
of the longitudinal surface of the first part, and wherein the body of the<br>
fixation device is conjoined to the skirt and in bearing relation with the re-<br>
entrant section to prevent the second part being removed from the first<br>
part in the first axial direction.<br>
The second part may be a cap which is slidingly received on the<br>
first part.<br>
The first and/or second parts may be of generally cylindrical cross<br>
section.<br>
To make it easier to conjoin the body of the fixation device to the<br>
second part, the body of the fixation device is preferably made from the<br>
same material as the mating surface of the second part.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, features from the different<br>
aspects thereof can be incorporated into the other aspects.<br>

Detailed Description of the Exemplary Embodiment of the Invention<br>
In FIGURES 2a to 2d there is shown a fixation device 101 in<br>
accordance with the present invention in its manufactured state. The<br>
fixation device 101 consists of a resilient, polypropylene ring-like body 103<br>
defined by a circumferential wall 105 which is formed about a longitudinal<br>
axis A-A and which has an inner circumferential surface 107 and an outer<br>
circumferential surface 109 radially spaced from the inner circumferential<br>
surface 107.<br>
As shown in FIGURE 2d, the inner circumferential surface 107 is<br>
chamfered, whereas the outer circumferential surface 109 is planar over<br>
most of its extent in this instance, this gives the body 103 an axial cross<br>
section of generally trapezium shape. By providing the body 103 with a<br>
cross-sectional shape which is symmetrical about an axis which is<br>
transverse to the longitudinal axis, as in this instance, allows the fixation<br>
device 101 to be used either way up, thereby aiding the assembly<br>
process, as will be more fully appreciated after reading the full description<br>
of this exemplary embodiment.<br>
The body 103 has an outer diameter OD of about I6.5mm and an<br>
inner diameter ID of about 13.7mm. The body 103 thus has a wall<br>
thickness t of about 1.4mm. The wall 106 has a height h of about 5.2mm.<br>
The body 103 is integrally formed with a weakened zone 111 in the<br>
form of an axial notch in the circumferential wall 105.    This can be<br>
9<br><br>
WO 2004/065224                                                                                                         PCT/EP2004/000663<br>
achieved where the body 103 is, for example, made by a moulding<br>
process, for instance an injection moulding process. This gives the<br>
circumferential wall 105 a circumferential zone 113 of reduced axial<br>
dimension (i.e. height).<br>
The circumferential zone 113 can be broken by applying a radial<br>
force to the circumferential wall 105. As shown in FIGURE 2e, this results<br>
in an axial split 115 being irreversibly formed in the body 103 to give the<br>
body 103 a use state having a generally C-shape, as in the prior art<br>
fixation device 1 described previously with reference to FIGURES 1a and<br>
1b.<br>
However, in contrast to the prior art device 1, the device 101 of the<br>
invention does not suffer from the problem of entanglement with other<br>
devices on a production line since the body 103 has an endless angular<br>
extent on formation thereof.<br>
Recalling that the body 103 is resilient, the body 103 in its use state<br>
is  biased by a radially-inwardly directed biasing force to the radially<br>
contracted configuration shown in   FIGURE 2e.   However, the axial split<br>
115 enables the body 103 to be radially expanded from the contracted<br>
radial configuration on application of a radially outward force which is<br>
greater than the biasing force.   However, when the radially outward force<br>
is removed, or reduced to be less than the biasing force, the biasing force<br>
causes the body 103 to return to its contracted rest configuration.   As will<br>
be appreciated, this allows the fixation device 101, in its use state, to be<br>
clamped onto an article having an outer diameter which is greater than the<br>
inner diameter ID of the body 103. In other words, a custom fit is achieved.<br>

WO 2004/065224                                                                                                         PCT/EP2004/000663<br>
Referring now to FIGURE 3, the fixation device 101 is shown<br>
interposed between a generally cylindrical cap accessory 100 and a<br>
generally cylindrical aerosol canister 110 to fix the accessory 100 and the<br>
canister 110 together.<br>
The aerosol canister 110 comprises as component parts thereof a<br>
container 120 containing a pressurised fluid having a dosed base end<br>
130, an open end (not shown) and a neck region 121 beneath the open<br>
end, a ferrule 122 closing the open end of the container 120, and a valve<br>
mechanism (not shown) supported in the container 120 and including an<br>
outlet valve stem 140 which projects through the female 122. By displacing<br>
the valve stem 140 into the container 120 a dose of the fluid is dispensed<br>
from the aerosol canister 110 through the stem 140. The valve mechanism<br>
nay be a metering valve mechanism whereby a metered dose of the fluid<br>
is dispensed by the outlet 140 on depression thereof relative to the<br>
container 120.<br>
The ferrule 122 is secured over the open end of the container 120<br>
by crimping the ferrule 122 into the re-entrant or flaring surface 123<br>
presented by the neck region 121. Thus, the ferrule 122 has a crimped<br>
region 124 in the neck region 121 which is caused to adopt the profile of<br>
the neck region 121. In other words, the crimped region 124 flares radially<br>
outwardly in the direction of the business (outlet) end of the aerosol<br>
canister 110.<br>
The cap accessory 100 in this non-limting embodiment takes the<br>
form of an actuation indicator device which indicates the dispensing of the<br>
fluid from the aerosol canister 110. The actuation indicator device 100<br>
has a housing 105, of the same material as the fixation device 101, which<br>
defines an internal compartment 115 in which is housed an indexing<br>
11<br><br>
WO 2004/065224                                                                                                         PCT/EP2004/000663<br>
mechanism (not shown) which is indexed on each actuation of the aerosol<br>
canister 110 to advance a display, which has indicia to indicate the<br>
dispensing of the fluid, in a window 305 of the housing 108 (see FIGURE<br>
4a). The display may be a numeric display which is advanced on each<br>
actuation cycle to show the number of doses of the fluid which have been<br>
dispensed or still remain. Such an actuation indicator device is disclosed<br>
in WO-A-9856444 supra and International patent application No.<br>
PCT/EP03/06466, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated<br>
herein by reference.<br>
As shown in FIGURE 3, the housing 108 has a tubular sleeve or<br>
skirt 102 which, is sized to slidingty receive the business end of the aerosol<br>
canister 110 along a longitudinal axis B-B. The housing 108 further has a<br>
lateral wall 117 which bounds the inner ends of the compartment 115 and<br>
the skirt 102.   The lateral wall 117 delimits the sliding travel of the<br>
business end of the aerosol canister 110 into the skirt 102 by abutting with<br>
a transverse end surface 119 of the ferrule 122 at the business end. It will<br>
be seen that the length of the skirt 102 is sized so as to be co-extensive<br>
with the flaring surface 123 of the neck region 121 of the aerosol canister<br>
110, and hence with the flared crimp region 124 of the ferrule 122, when<br>
the lateral wall 117 abuts the ferrule end surface 119.<br>
The body 103 of the fixation device 101 is secured around the<br>
crimped region 124 of the ferrule 122. In this regard, the body 103 of the<br>
fixation device 101 has an inner diameter ID in the rest condition of its use<br>
state which is smaller than the outer diameter of the crimped region 124 of<br>
the ferrule 122. The body 103 is thus redially expanded on the crimped<br>
region 124 of the ferrule 122 so that the inner surface 107 of the body 103<br>
is affixed to the crimped region 124. The skirt 102 of the housing 103, on<br>
the other hand, has an inner longitudinal surface 106 which engages the<br>
12<br><br>
WO 2004/065224                                                                                                         PCT/EP2004/000663<br>
outer circumferential surface 109 of the body 103 of the fixation device<br>
101. Thus the fixation device 101 is wedged between the inner<br>
longitudinal surface 106 of the skirt 102 and the flaring outer surface of the<br>
crimped region 124 of the ferrule 122.<br>
The fixation device 101 is welded to the skirt 102 by application of<br>
ultrasound energy, e.g. by a series of spot welds. Two sonitrodes (not<br>
shown) are generally employed in the welding process, each sonitrode<br>
having three pins which are pushed into contact with the skirt 102. Energy<br>
is transferred through the sonitrode pins, causing them to vibrate and fuse<br>
the skirt 102 to the outer circumferential surface 109 of the body 103 of<br>
the fixation device 101. Alternatively, one continuous weld may be<br>
employed  by  moving  the  sonitrode  head   relative  to  the  skirt   102.<br>
It can therefore be seen that the fixation device 101 acts to fix the<br>
actuation indicator device 100 to the business end of the aerosol canister<br>
110. Movement of the actuation indicator device 100 along the<br>
longitudinal axis B-B towards the base 130 of the aerosol container 120 is<br>
prevented by the abutment of the lateral wall 117 of the housing 108 and<br>
the ferrule end surface 119, while axial movement in the opposite direction<br>
is prevented by the fixation device 101 as the fixation device 101 is<br>
welded to the skirt 102 and wedged against the crimped region 124 of the<br>
ferrule 122 which flares radially outwardly in that direction.<br>
FIGURES 4a-c illustrate the process whereby the fixation device<br>
101 is fitted around the neck 121 of the aerosol container 120 and welded<br>
10 tubular skirt 102 of the housing 105.<br>
FIGURE 43 is an exploded view showing the fixation device 101 in<br>
its use state positioned between the canister 110 and the actuation<br>

WO 2004/065224                                                                                                         PCT/EP2004/000663<br>
indicator device 100, FIGURE 4b shows the fixation device 101 slipped<br>
around the neck 121 of the canister 110. This is done by opening the<br>
fixation device 101, sliding it over the business end of the container 120<br>
and then allowing the return force of the body 103 to close the fixation<br>
device 101 onto the neck 121.   As shown In FIGURE 4c, the fixation<br>
device 101 is slid over the canister 110 in the direction of arrow A thereby<br>
causing the body 103 to radially expand due to the interaction of the<br>
chambered inner circumferential surface 107 of the body 103 with the<br>
flaring surface of the neck region 121 and the crimped ferrule region 124.<br>
Meanwhile, the housing 108 is positioned over the business end of the<br>
canister 110 by being pressed down in the direction of arrow B. In this<br>
way, the lateral wall 117 of the housing 108 abuts the ferrule end surface<br>
119 and the fixation device 101 is wedged between the skirt 102 and the<br>
crimped ferrule region 124.<br>
The fixation device 101 is then joined 10 the skirt 102 by ultrasonic<br>
welding at the points indicated by arrows C, thereby securing the housing<br>
108 to the canister 110.<br>
The aerosol canister 110 may be for dispensing metered doses of a<br>
medicament in which case the container contains a pressurised<br>
medicament fluid, for instance a medicament in a liquified gas propellant,<br>
e.g. a hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) propellant such as HFA-I34a or HFA-227.<br>
The aerosol canister may be for use in an inhalation device, in which case<br>
the medicament may be for the treatment of respiratory disorders such as<br>
XXX and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Appropriate<br>
medicaments way thus be setected from, for example, analgesics, e.g.,<br>
codeine, dihydromorphine, ergotamine, fentanyl or morphine; anginal<br>
preparation, e.g., dilliazern ; antiallergics, e.g., cromoglycate (e.g. s the<br>
sodium   salt),   Ketotilen   or   nedocromil   (e.g.   as  the  sodium   salt) ;<br>
