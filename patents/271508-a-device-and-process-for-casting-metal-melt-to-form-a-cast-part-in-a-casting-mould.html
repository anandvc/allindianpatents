Casting mould, device and process for casting metal melt<br>
The present invention relates to a casting mould for<br>
manufacturing a cast part from a metal melt which is, for<br>
example, a light metal melt, especially an aluminium melt.In<br>
addition, the invention relates to a device and a process for<br>
casting metal melts of this type to form a cast part using a<br>
casting mould of this type.<br>
One possibility for producing cast parts using casting moulds<br>
of the above-mentioned type is what is known as 'contact<br>
casting' ' . In this casting process, the casting moulds, each<br>
of which is to be filled with melt, are gradually moved below<br>
a melt container containing the metal melt. Formed in the base<br>
of the melt container is an outlet which merges with a supply<br>
channcl , to the free end of which the inlet in each casting<br>
mould is docked. The outflow of melt out of the melt container<br>
is in this case conventionally regulated via a stopper which<br>
can be moved from a completely lowered position, in which it<br>
seals the outlet, into a raised position, in which the outlet<br>
is released and melt is able to flow into the casting mould<br>
via the supply channel.<br>
Another casting process which has enjoyed practical success is<br>
what is known as '1ow-pressure casting'. In this process,<br>
the melt is conveyed counter to gravity from a melt container<br>
docked to the bottom of the casting mould into the mould<br>
cavity in the casting mould via an inlet arranged on the<br>
bottom of the casting mould. For this purpose, there is a<br>
pressure applied to the melt contained in the melt container,<br>
which forces the melt to flow into the mould cavity in the<br>
casting mould via a riser pipe which acts in this case as the<br>
supply channel.<br><br>
3<br>
Regardless of the manner in which the mould is filled, there<br>
is the problem that what is known as 'jamming' occurs once<br>
the mould has been completely filled. This jamming is<br>
manifested in a sudden rise in static pressure acting on the<br>
walls of the casting mould. It is a result of the kinetic<br>
energy with which the melt flows into the casting mould<br>
suddenly being converted, once the mould has been completely<br>
filled, into static energy and, at the same time, the amount<br>
of melt which has accumulated in each supply channel exerts a<br>
pressure on the melt which is already present in the casting<br>
mould. This pressure surge not only presses the melt into the<br>
gaps which are inevitably present between the individual<br>
moulded parts of the casting mould; the casting mould walls<br>
surrounding the mould cavity are also penetrated to a greater<br>
extent. This has proven especially problematic in the case of<br>
casting moulds which are made of a porous moulding material<br>
and are destroyed for demoulding the cast part once the melt<br>
has solidified. In the case of 'expendable' casting moulds<br>
of this type, in particular, jamming causes the cast parts<br>
obtained to have a rough surface and necessitates increased<br>
effort for releasing the cast parts, once they have<br>
solidified, from the moulding material of the casting mould.<br>
To minimise the extent to which the metal melt penetrates a<br>
casting mould made of sandy moulding material, the filling<br>
level in the mould cavity in the casting mould is, in the case<br>
of a device known from DE 196 23 720 A1 for contact casting,<br>
monitored while the melt is being poured out and, on reaching<br>
a provided filling height, the filling process is terminated<br>
prematurely to the extent that the superfluous amount of melt<br>
which still burdens the melt once the mould has been<br>
completely filled is minimised and the risk of jamming is thus<br>
reduced. For this purpose, the casting moulds used in the<br>
known device have in their lid an inspection opening which<br><br>
4<br>
leads rectilinearly into the mould cavity and through which a<br>
laser beam is directed onto the surface of the melt introduced<br>
into the casting mould. The beam reflected by the melt is<br>
intercepted by a sensor which forwards its measurement signal<br>
to a control and evaluation means which, based on the laser<br>
beam transmitted and received, determines the respective<br>
filling level of the casting mould and, on reaching a critical<br>
filling height, issues a control signal to seal the outlet in<br>
the melt container. The critical filling height is in this<br>
case adjusted in such a way as to avoid any undesirable<br>
jamming even if any melt; continues to flow in the supply<br>
channel.<br>
In practice, it has been found that, under the rough<br>
conditions provided in practical casting operation, monitoring<br>
the height of the filling level and prematurely terminating<br>
the flow of melt on the model of the procedure described in DE<br>
196 23 720 A1 still do not rule out the undesirable<br>
penetration of the inner walls of the casting mould with the<br>
requisite degree of certainty.<br>
The object of the present invention was therefore to provide a<br>
casting mould in which further optimised casting results are<br>
ensured even under hard practical operating conditions. In<br>
addition, there are to be disclosed a device and a process,<br>
the use or application of which minimises the risk of jamming<br>
during casting.<br>
With regard to a casting mould for manufacturing a cast part<br>
by casting a metal melt, which mould has a mould cavity for<br>
reproducing a cast part and an inlet for pouring metal melt<br>
into the mould cavity, this object has, in accordance with the<br>
invention, been achieved in that a casting mould of this type<br>
was provided with at least one compensation cavity which is<br><br>
5<br>
linked to the mould cavity via a channel and comprises at<br>
least one portion which is arranged above the maximum filling<br>
level, of: the casting mould during solidification of the metal<br>
melt.<br>
With regard to a device for casting metal melt to form a cast<br>
part in a casting mould configured in accordance with any one<br>
of the preceding claims and is equipped with a melt container,<br>
comprising an outlet, for the metal melt, with a supply<br>
channel connected to the outlet, with a means for docking the<br>
casting mould to the melt container in such a way that the<br>
inlet in the casting mould is connected to the supply channel<br>
when docked, with a measuring means for detecting the amount<br>
of melt introduced into the casting mould, with a regulating<br>
means for regulating the flow of melt from the melt container<br>
into the casting mould and with a control and evaluation means<br>
which evaluates the amount of melt detected by the measuring<br>
means and issues a control signal for sealing the outlet in<br>
the container once a specific filling level in the casting<br>
mould has been reached, the above-mentioned object has, in<br>
accordance with the invention, been achieved in that the<br>
control and evaluation means issues the control signal once<br>
the amount of melt poured into the casting mould has reached a<br>
limit value at which the amount of metal melt which is then<br>
still present in the supply channel is sufficient to fill the<br>
mould cavity completely and at most a portion of the<br>
compensation cavity.<br>
With regard to a process for casting metal melt to form a cast<br>
part in a casting mould, wherein the metal melt is guided in a<br>
regulated manner from a container into the casting mould via a<br>
supply channel and the inflow of metal melt into the supply<br>
channel is interrupted once a specific amount of metal melt<br>
has been introduced into the mould cavity, the above-mentioned<br><br>
6<br>
object was finally achieved by the invention in that use is<br>
made of a casting mould configured in accordance with the<br>
invention and the inflow of melt into the supply channel is<br>
interrupted once the metal melt in the mould cavity has<br>
reached a filling level at which the amount of metal melt<br>
which is still present in the supply channel is sufficient to<br>
fill the mould cavity completely and at most a portion of the<br>
compensation cavity.<br>
To avoid as far as possible penetration of a casting mould as<br>
a result of jamming, the invention proposes the formation in<br>
the casting mould of a compensation cavity which is designed<br>
to absorb, as a buffer, the amount of excess melt which is no<br>
longer required for complete filling of the casting mould and,<br>
as a result of this process, inevitably remains, oven after<br>
the melt container has been sealed, in the supply channel via<br>
which the melt flows into the casting mould. The racta 1 "I ostatic<br>
pressure, which would otherwise prevail, of the amount of melt<br>
present in the supply channel is thus prevented from acting on<br>
the melt present in the casting mould.<br>
At the same time, in the event of pressure peaks in the<br>
casting mould, the compensation cavity acts as a damper by<br>
which, for example, jamming, which is especially critical in<br>
the prior art with regard to the surface quality and<br>
subsequent processability of the cast part obtained, is<br>
effectively buffered. The melt infiltrating the mould cavity<br>
in the casting mould is able to escape into the compensation<br>
cavi ty, thus preventing, in particular, the sudden r i se in<br>
pressure which occurs in conventional casting moulds, once the<br>
mould has been completely filled, as a result of the<br>
conversion of the kinetic energy, inherent to the melt during<br>
filling, into static energy.<br><br>
7<br>
In terms of the process and device, the embodiment according<br>
to the invention of a casting mould allows the inflow of melt<br>
into the supply channel to be interrupted as soon as the<br>
casting mould is filled, the tolerance range within which this<br>
interruption is carried out being widened by the buffering<br>
effect of the compensation cavity. It is thus ensured, even<br>
under crude practical operating conditions, that the flow of<br>
melt is in each case terminated in good time in such a way as<br>
reliably to rule out, with incorporation of the effect of the<br>
compensation cavity, the production of pressure peaks in the<br>
casting mould.<br>
The linking of the compensation cavity via a channel firstly<br>
serves, in this case, the purpose of allowing the casting<br>
compound remaining in the region of the compensation cavity to<br>
be easily separated from the cast part after solidification.<br>
The channel is therefore preferably formed in such a way that<br>
the webs remaining in the region of the channels after<br>
solidification are thin and easily separable. The surface area<br>
of the passage of the melt to the chambers is in this case<br>
preferably selected so as to be as large as possible in that<br>
the linking of the channel is as broad as possible at a given<br>
low linking height.<br>
A particular advantage of the embodiment according to the<br>
invention of a casting mould is that the compensation chamber<br>
is formed in the casting mould itself, so the casting mould as<br>
a whole remains closed. This allows the casting mould easily<br>
to be turned in order, for example, to cause purposefully,<br>
oriented solidification of the cast part.<br>
The amount of melt which remains unused in the compensation<br>
chambers is negligible compared to the overall volume of melt<br>
required for the cast part. A suitably sophisticated<br><br>
8<br>
configuration of each connecting channel between the mould<br>
cavity and compensation chamber allows the casting material<br>
which collects in the chamber easily to be broken off from the<br>
finished cast part. It has been found to be especially<br>
beneficial for the practical application of the invention that<br>
casting moulds configured in accordance with the invention may<br>
easily be inserted into existing casting devices and that<br>
these existing casting devices may easily be retrofitted to<br>
devices according to the invention or be operated in the<br>
manner according to the invention.<br>
The cast parts obtained using the invention have a much<br>
smoother surface than those manufactured in the known manner.<br>
Especially in the field of sophisticated moulded elements of<br>
the cast part, such as, for example, the oil channels of<br>
engine units, the levels of surface roughness are much lower,<br>
as is accordingly the flow resistance as liquids flow through.<br>
The cast parts obtained in accordance with the invention are<br>
especially simple to clean, as little moulding material clings<br>
to them after demoulding. The effort required for cleaning the<br>
finished cast part is therefore greatly reduced. Finally, the<br>
reduced penetration of pressure of the inner surfaces by the<br>
melt lowers the requirements placed on the quality of the<br>
moulding material used for manufacturing the casting mould.<br>
More economical coarse-grain moulding materials may thus be<br>
used without detracting from the surface quality.<br>
The invention therefore provides a casting mould, a casting<br>
device and a casting process which provide, even under hard<br>
practical operating conditions, casting results which not only<br>
ensure optimised surfaces but also allow simplified removal<br>
from the casting mould once the cast part has solidified.<br><br>
9<br>
The options for use of casting moulds according to the<br>
invention may be extended in that the cross section of the<br>
channel is delimited in such a way as to be sealed, as soon as<br>
the mould has been filled with metal melt which has already<br>
solidified. This can be achieved in that the cross-sectional<br>
course of the channel is adapted to the heat dissipatod via<br>
the casting mould in the region of the channel in such a way<br>
that the solidification of the melt contained in the channel<br>
is completed very rapidly. It is thus very easy to prevent<br>
cast metal from flowing out of the compensation chamber into<br>
the mould cavity and back once the mould has been filled. This<br>
has been found to be especially beneficial for casting<br>
processes of the type in which the casting mould, once filled<br>
with melt, is rotated about a longitudinal or transverse axis<br>
to bring about purposefully oriented solidification of the<br>
cast part.<br>
In principle, the advantages of the invention may be utilised<br>
in all casting moulds and casting processes, regardless of the<br>
material from which the casting mould is made. However, the<br>
good demouldability makes the invention especially suitable<br>
for expendable casting moulds which are usually made of a<br>
moulding sand and a moulding material comprising a binder.<br>
An especially uniform effect of the configuration according to<br>
the invention of a casting mould may be achieved in that there<br>
are provided a plurality of compensation chambers which are<br>
connected to mould cavity regions which are, in each case,<br>
critical with regard to the effect of pressure peaks. However,<br>
it is also conceivable to provide a larger chamber which is<br>
connected to the mould cavity via a suitably configured<br>
connecting channel or via a plurality of channels leading into<br>
the eritica1 regions .<br><br>
10<br>
The casting mould may, in principle, be provided for all known<br>
casting processes. Examples include contact casting or else<br>
rising casting. The casting mould according to the invention<br>
may be provided for the manufacture of cast parts for the<br>
automotive industry, especially of engine components such as,<br>
for example, cylinder blocks.<br>
A constructionally simple embodiment of a casting mould<br>
according to the invention is obtained if the compensation<br>
chamber is linked to a portion of the mould cavity that is<br>
located on top while the metal melt is being poured in. In the<br>
case of casting moulds composed of a plurality of moulded<br>
parts, the compensation chamber may for this purpose be<br>
incorporated, for example, into the casting mould lid which is<br>
arranged on top during filling.<br>
The amount of melt guided into the casting mould can, in<br>
principle, be detected by a weight measurement or other known<br>
processes. The amount of melt may in this case be detected, in<br>
a particularly reliable manner adapted to the actual<br>
conditions, in that the measuring means monitors the filling<br>
level in the casting mould and the evaluation means issues the<br>
control signal once the metal melt in the mould cavity has<br>
reached a filling height at which the volume of metal melt<br>
which is still present in the supply channel is sufficient to<br>
fill the mould cavity completely and at most a portion of the<br>
compensation cavity. In order, for this purpose, to be able to<br>
utilise the possibility, known from DE 196 23 720 A1, of an<br>
especially precise and practical measurement of the filling<br>
level of a casting mould, the casting mould is advantageously<br>
provided with an inspection opening leading to the mould<br>
cavity for inspecting the filling level of the metal melt in<br>
the mould cavity. The compensation chamber and the inspection<br>
opening are in this case preferably oriented in such a way<br><br>
11<br>
that the inspection opening to the mould cavity and the<br>
compensation cavity intersect a common horizontal plane. The<br>
filling level of the chambers may thus be gauged, in each<br>
case, via the inspection opening.<br>
If the casting mould has an inspection opening of the type<br>
described hereinbefore, the measuring means of the device<br>
according to the invention may comprise, in a manner known<br>
from DE 196 23 720 A1, a laser, which directs a laser beam<br>
through the inspection opening onto the surface of the melt<br>
introduced into the casting mould, and a sensor which detects<br>
the laser beam reflected by the surface of the melt.<br>
The risk of the occurrence of a pressure surge may be further<br>
reduced in that the filling speed is reduced toward the end of<br>
the mould-filling process by reducing the flow through the<br>
outlet in the melt container. For this purpose, in the case of<br>
a device according to the invention, the regulating means may,<br>
in a manner known per se, comprise a stopper for sealing the<br>
outlet in the container and an adjustment means for raising<br>
the stopper out of and lowering it into its sealed position,<br>
the adjustment movement of the stopper preferably being<br>
regulated by the regulating means stopper, especially when the<br>
approaches the outlet.<br>
The invention will be described hereinafter in greater detail<br>
with reference to drawings which illustrate an embodiment and<br>
in which:<br>
Fig. 1 i s a schematic cross section of a casting mould for<br>
casting a cast part of an internal-combustion engine<br>
Fig. 2 is a schematic cross section of a device for casting an<br>
A1/Si melt in a first operating position; and<br><br>
12<br>
Fig. 3 shows the device) according to Fig. 2 in a second<br>
operati.ng position.<br>
The casting mould 1 is composed, as a core packet, from a<br>
plurality of lateral moulded parts 2, 3, a base part and a lid<br>
moulded part 4 which is arranged at the top, in the casting<br>
mould filling position shown in the figures, and covers the<br>
top of the mould cavity 5 surrounded by the moulded parts 2,<br>
3, 4. The moulded parts 2, 3, 4 are made from a moulding<br>
material mixed from a moulding sand and a binder and are<br>
destroyed on demoulding of the cast part G formed in the mould<br>
cavity. The cast part G may, for example, be a cylinder block<br>
for an internal-combustion engine.<br>
Incorporated into the cover moulded part 4 of the casting<br>
mould 1 are an inlet 6, which runs toward the mould cavity 5<br>
in the manner of a funnel and merges therewith, and a<br>
cylindrical inspection opening 7 which also leads<br>
rectilinearly from the top of the cover moulded part 4 into<br>
the mould cavity 5.<br>
The cover moulded part 4 comprises a peripheral edge portion<br>
4a which is thicker toward the bottom of the cover moulded<br>
part 4 than the inner portion 4b, surrounded by the edge<br>
portion 4a, of the cover moulded part 4. The edge portion 4a<br>
of the cover moulded part 4 rests on the lateral parts 2, 3,<br>
whereas the bottom of its inner portion 4b defines the top of<br>
the cast part and thus the height at which the casting mould 1<br>
is completely filled with melt.<br>
Incorporated into the edge portion 4a of the cover moulded<br>
part 4 are a large number of small-volume compensation<br>
chambers 8, 9 which are arranged in rows along the lateral<br><br>
13<br>
parts 2, 3. One row of compensation chambers 8 are in this<br>
case associated with one lateral part 2, whereas the other row<br>
of compensation chambers 9 are positioned above the other<br>
lateral part 3 of the casting mould 1. Within their rows, the<br>
compensation chambers 8 or 9 are set apart from one another in<br>
such a way that each compensation chamber 8, 9 is associated<br>
with a region which is especially critical with regard to the<br>
effect of pressure peaks. Alternatively, the compensation<br>
chambers 8, 9 may also be arranged in their rows at uniform<br>
intervals so as to ensure a distribution of their effect that<br>
is as uniform as possible over the length of the casting<br>
mould.<br>
The compensation chambers 8, 9 take up little space compared<br>
to the mould cavity 5. The total volume of all of the<br>
compensation chambers 8, 9 is thus approximately 2 % to 3 % of<br>
the volume of the mould cavity 5.<br>
The base 8a of the compensation chambers 8, 9 is arranged, in<br>
each case, below the maximum filling level Fmax of the casting<br>
mould 1 defined by the bottom of the inner portion 4b of the<br>
cover moulded part 4, whereas the roof 8b of the compensation<br>
chambers 8, 9 is positioned, in the direction of the top of<br>
the cover moulded part 4, in each case well above the bottom<br>
of the inner portion 4b. The upper portion 8c, 9c of the<br>
compensation chambers 8, 9 is thus located in each case above<br>
the maximum filling level Fmax of the casting mould 1.<br>
The portion 8d, arranged below the maximum filling level Fmax<br>
of the casting mould 1, of the compensation chambers 8, 9 is<br>
connected to the mould cavity 5 in the casting mould 1 in each<br>
case via a horizontally extending channel 10, 11 incorporated<br>
into the lid core 4. The opening, associated with the mould<br>
cavity 5, of the channels 10, 11 is in each case arranged on<br><br>
14<br>
the inside, facing the mould cavity 5, of the edge portion.<br>
The channels 10, 11 have a low height and width which is<br>
designed in such a way that the opening cross section of the<br>
channels 10, 11 is sufficiently large to allow melt to enter<br>
the compensation chambers 8, 9 unimpeded but at the same time<br>
sufficiently small for the volume of melt contained in the<br>
channels 8, 9 to solidify, as a result of the dissipation of<br>
heat into the volume of the cover moulded part 4 that<br>
surrounds the channels 10, 11, as soon as the mould cavity 5<br>
has been filled.<br>
For casting of the cast part G, the casting mould 1 i s<br>
positioned by a conveying and lifting device 12 below the<br>
opening of a supply channel 13 in such a way that the inlet 6<br>
in the casting mould 1 is docked tightly at the opening of the<br>
supply channel 13. In this position, the inspection opening 7<br>
in the casting mould 1 is arranged below a laser 14 which<br>
directs its laser beam through the inspection opening 7 into<br>
the mould cavity 5 in the casting mould 1.<br>
The supply channel 13 is configured in a connector 15 which is<br>
configured on the bottom of a melt container 16 and connected<br>
to the outlet 17 in the melt container 16, which outlet may be<br>
sealed and opened using a stopper 18. For this purpose, the<br>
stopper 18 can be raised by an adjustment means 19 from a<br>
closed position, in which its thickened end seals the outlet<br>
17, into an open position, in which it releases the outlet .17,<br>
thus allowing the A1/Si melt S contained in the melt container<br>
16 to flow into the supply channel 13. In the same way, the<br>
stopper 18 may be lowered by the adjustment means 19 to seal<br>
the outlet 17. Both the raising process and the lowering<br>
process are carried out in this case in a regulated manner in<br>
that the adjustment means 19 is able to stop the stopper 18 in<br><br>
15<br>
any position in order to regulate the volume flow of melt S<br>
passing through the outlet 17.<br>
The adjustment means 19 receives the control signals for<br>
raising and lowering the stopper 18 from a regulating and<br>
control, means 20. The regulating and control means 20 is<br>
coupled to a measuring and evaluation means 21 with which<br>
there are associated, in turn, the laser 14 and a sensor 22<br>
which detects the laser beam L reflected at the surface of the<br>
melt S passing into the mould cavity 5.<br>
During filling of the casting mould 1 with melt S (stopper 18<br>
raised to the maximum degree), the measuring and evaluation<br>
means 21 continuously calculates, from the laser beam I issued<br>
by the laser 14 and detected by the sensor 22, the filling<br>
level F in the mould cavity 5 and delivers the corresponding<br>
measured results to the regulating and control means 20. If<br>
the filling level F reaches a filling height Fkritl, the<br>
regulating and control means 20 issues to the adjustment means<br>
19	a first control signal in response to which the adjustment<br>
means lowers the stopper 18 into a position in which, although<br>
the outlet 17 in the melt container 12 is still open, the flow<br>
of melt S is nevertheless slowed down. The filling height Fkritl<br>
is sufficiently remote from the maximum filling level Fmax of<br>
the casting mould 1 that the filling of the casting mould is<br>
slowed down toward the end of the filling process.<br>
As soon as the filling level F has thus reached a second<br>
critical filling height Fkrit2, the regulating and control means<br>
20	issues to the adjustment means 19 a second control signal<br>
in response to which the adjustment means presses the stopper<br>
18 fully into the outlet 17, thus preventing any further melt<br>
S from entering the supply channel 13. The position of the<br>
filling height Fkrit2 is in this case designed in such a way<br><br>
16<br>
that the amount of melt Sz still present in the supply channel<br>
13 is sufficient to fill with melt S the mould cavity 5<br>
completely and the compensation cavities 8, 9 at most in their<br>
lower region 8b, 9b. Depending on the configuration of the<br>
casting mould 1, the filling height Fkrit2 may correspond to the<br>
maximum filling level Fmax<br>
Alternatively, the regulating and control moans may issue<br>
merely one control signal to the adjustment means 19, i.e.<br>
when the critical filling height is reached, so the stopper 18<br>
is completely closed. If the times required for filling the<br>
mould are substantially constant, the stopper may be partially<br>
lowered in advance in a time-controlled manner, thus also<br>
slowing down the filling of the casting mould toward the end<br>
of the filling process.<br>
On account of its low volume, the amount of melt which passes<br>
into the channels 10, 11 when the casting mould 1 is filled<br>
with melt S solidifies almost immediately after the end of the<br>
filling process, thus sealing the connection between the<br>
compensation chambers 8, 9 and the mould cavity 5 in the<br>
casting mould 1. The casting mould 1 may then easily be<br>
forwarded for subsequent processing by being rotated, for<br>
example, through 180° about its longitudinal axis in order to<br>
allow the cast part G purposefully to solidify with<br>
solidification oriented counter to the direction of<br>
introducti on.<br><br>
