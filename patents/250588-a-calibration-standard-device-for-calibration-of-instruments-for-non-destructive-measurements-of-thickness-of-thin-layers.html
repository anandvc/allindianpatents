				<td>Calibration Standard<br>
This invention relates to a calibration standard,<br>
especially for the calibration of devices for the non-<br>
destructive measurement of the thickness of thin layers<br>
with a carrier plate of a basic material and a standard<br>
applied on the carrier plate, said standard having the<br>
thickness of the layers to be measured at which the<br>
device is to be calibrated.<br>
For the non-destructive measurement of the thickness of<br>
thin layers by a magnetic induction method or an eddy<br>
current method depending on the basic material and/or<br>
the coating, it is necessary that - after a<br>
standardization - the devices are calibrated for the<br>
corresponding measurement. By means of the calibration,<br>
a difference between the nominal value and the measured<br>
actual value is established. This difference will be<br>
corrected, with the device being calibrated to the<br>
measuring task.<br>
Calibration is provided such that, to start with, a<br>
first value is registered on a basic material by means<br>
of a measuring probe of the measuring device. Following<br>
that, another value is registered on a standard which<br>
is applied on the carrier plate measured before. The<br>
difference will be the measured layer thickness. Due to<br>
the standard, the nominal value to be measured is<br>
determined. After several measurements, the averaged<br>
deviation between nominal and actual values will be<br>
registered and calibrated. The calibration standards<br>
known so far consist of a carrier plate of the basic<br>
material - of steel and iron for the magnetic induction<br><br>
method for measuring the layer thickness, and of a non-<br>
ferromagnetic basic material, for example non-magnetic<br>
steel, aluminum and their alloy, for the layer<br>
thickness measurement by means of the eddy current<br>
method. The surfaces of the carrier plate are<br>
preferably polished. On this carrier plate, a standard<br>
is applied or glued, for example as a plastic film.<br>
These calibration standards are problematic in so far<br>
as build-ups can result already due to the application<br>
or the gluing. To avoid these disadvantages, DE 10 2005<br>
028 652.6 proposed to apply the standard by means of<br>
plating by rubbing on the carrier plate to avoid the<br>
build-ups. In this case, the standard is produced in a<br>
preferred embodiment as an insulation layer, especially<br>
as a semiconductor material. This calibration standard<br>
has already proven successful in application.<br>
On the basis of this calibration standard, the<br>
invention is based on the objective of increasing the<br>
precision of calibration to obtain a better measuring<br>
precision of the calibrated measuring devices.<br>
This problem is solved by a calibration standard for<br>
the calibration of devices for the non-destructive<br>
measurement of the thickness of thin layers with a<br>
carrier plate of a basic material and a standard<br>
applied on the carrier plate, said standard having the<br>
thickness of the layer at which the device is to be<br>
calibrated, wherein that a holding device arranged on<br>
the basic body of the calibration standard receives at<br>
least the standard to the basic body such that upon<br>
setting a measuring probe of the device for the non-<br>
destructive measurement of thin layers onto the<br>
standard, its position will be changeable by at least<br><br>
one degree of freedom. Further advantageous embodiments<br>
and developments are indicated in the other claims.<br>
When setting a measuring probe of the device for the<br>
measurement of thin layers, the standard changeable in<br>
its position by at least one degree of freedom will<br>
enable that a tilt-free setting is provided of the<br>
measuring probe or, respectively, of a contact<br>
spherical cap with a sensor element of the measuring<br>
probe assigned to it. Due to this standard changeable<br>
from its rest position during the registration of a<br>
plurality of actual values for the calibration of the<br>
device, it is rendered possible that the measuring<br>
probe is always set on in the same position, even if<br>
the measuring probe is entirely lifted up from the<br>
calibration standard and subseguently set on again. Due<br>
to the standard changeable in its position, a kind of<br>
wobble arrangement of the standard to the basic body of<br>
the calibrating standard is given, thereby enabling the<br>
tilt-free arrangement to the measuring probe and thus<br>
considerably minimizing the occurrence of errors.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment of the<br>
invention, it is provided that the standard is<br>
positioned twist-proof - about an axis perpendicular to<br>
the surface of the standard - from the holding device<br>
to the basic body. This will enable that - upon setting<br>
the measuring probe outside of a center axis of the<br>
standard - a defined, especially wobbling deflection<br>
movement without twisting is provided. The alignment of<br>
the standard to the basic body will be maintained which<br>
enables identical measuring conditions for every<br>
measurement and thus for registering the actual values.<br>
Due to the twist-proof reception, an additional<br>
rotation of the standard - for tilting or deflecting<br><br>
the standard from the rest position - will be prevented<br>
so that unique conditions are provided upon<br>
calibration.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the holding device<br>
features at least one spring-loaded resilient holding<br>
element which provides, especially in its center axis,<br>
a bearing surface for the central reception of the<br>
standard or the carrier plate with a standard provided<br>
thereon. Due to this holding element, an at least minor<br>
deflection from the rest position can be provided<br>
immediately upon setting a measuring probe onto the<br>
standard so that a tilt-free measurement will be<br>
rendered possible. Especially in the calibration of a<br>
manual measuring device by the user, different forces<br>
applied can thereby be balanced so as to avoid minutest<br>
damages of the surface of the standard and/or of the<br>
contact spherical cap.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the holding<br>
element of the holding device is designed as a disk<br>
shaped diaphragm. Such a disk shaped diaphragm is<br>
designed with a very thin wall thickness so that this<br>
diaphragm is spring-loaded resilient in design. For<br>
example, the diaphragm can be made spring hard of a<br>
copper/beryllium alloy, of nickel, aluminum or the<br>
like. The diaphragm can preferably feature elevations<br>
or depressions radially arranged to the center axis<br>
which determine the bending, as well as the bending<br>
force or the reset force, respectively.<br>
According to an alternative embodiment of the holding<br>
device, it is provided that the holding element is<br>
designed as a spring disk with circular segment shaped<br>
punchings . Such a spring disk has the same properties<br>
as a disk shaped diaphragm.<br><br>
The holding element is preferably fastened in a<br>
depression on the basic body. This depression is used<br>
quasi as a clearance for a deflection movement of the<br>
holding element. The depression is preferably designed<br>
with a circumferential shoulder in which the holding<br>
element rests for simple alignment and positioning.<br>
According to another advantageous embodiment of the<br>
invention, it is provided that the holding device<br>
comprises at least one damping or spring element which<br>
is propped on the bottom of the depression and engages<br>
on an underside of the holding element. Such a damping<br>
or spring element can additionally provide a power of<br>
resistance while a measuring probe is set onto the<br>
standard. When using such a damping or spring element,<br>
the holding element designed as a disk shaped diaphragm<br>
or spring disk can be soft in design. This will have<br>
the advantage that a soft deflection of the standard<br>
will be enabled whereby the measurement of the actual<br>
values will be increased and, accordingly, the<br>
calibration can be performed more precisely.<br>
A preferred embodiment provides for the carrier plate<br>
being provided in a reception of the basic body and the<br>
surface of the carrier plate lying in a rest position<br>
on the level of the surface of the basic body. The<br>
surface of the basic body thereby forms a bearing<br>
surface on which an auxiliary pole of a manual<br>
measuring device can be set to initially make a first<br>
measurement on the carrier plate on the same level. In<br>
the reception of the basic body, the depression for the<br>
arrangement of the holding element of the holding<br>
device will also be preferably provided.<br>
Furthermore, a narrow circumferential gap is preferably<br>
designed between the reception of the basic body and<br><br>
the carrier plate. Due to the narrow circumferential<br>
air gap, the surface of the carrier plate - changeable<br>
from the rest position by at least one degree of<br>
freedom - and thus also the measuring surface of the<br>
standard to the adjacent basic body will have the<br>
effect of a continuous material so that the radial<br>
field of force lines can be designed quasi continuously<br>
without any impairment had in comparison with an<br>
uninterrupted surface.<br>
Preferably, the calibration standard is designed with a<br>
plurality of standards of different layer thicknesses<br>
which are applied on the carrier plates. Here, the<br>
carrier plates are preferably arranged in a row next to<br>
each other, separated by a narrow gap. This gap width<br>
is preferably also provided between the carrier plate<br>
and the basic body so that identical conditions exist.<br>
Thus, a calibration standard can be designed for a<br>
plurality of layer thicknesses by means of a basic<br>
body, with all layer thicknesses having the same<br>
conditions.<br>
Preferably, a calibration standard with a plurality of<br>
normal, different layer thicknesses will be structured<br>
such that the carrier plate which accepts the standard<br>
with the largest thickness will be arranged in the<br>
center of the basic body, and the other carrier plates<br>
each accepting a standard being arranged with<br>
descending thickness of the standard, at an increasing<br>
distance from the standard with the largest thickness.<br>
Thus can be ensured that - for registering the maximum<br>
thickness of the standard - a large radial field of<br>
force will be available to enable exact registering of<br>
the actual value.<br><br>
The calibrating standard according to the invention can<br>
be designed as a so-called precision standard which<br>
enables a tilt-free setting of the measuring probe of a<br>
device for the non-destructive measurement of the<br>
thickness of thin layers onto the standard, with always<br>
the same conditions being provided upon setting a<br>
measuring probe onto the standard.<br>
In the following, the invention as well as additional<br>
advantageous embodiments and developments of the same<br>
will be explained and described in detail on the basis<br>
of the examples presented in the drawings. The features<br>
which can be gathered from the description and the<br>
drawings can be used individually by themselves or in a<br>
plurality in any combination according to the<br>
invention. In the Figures:<br>
Figure 1 shows a diagrammatic top view of a<br>
calibration standard according to the invention;<br>

the invention;<br>

of thin layers; and<br>
Figure 4 an enlarged partial view of the sectional<br>
view in Figure 2 .<br>
Figure 1 shows a diagrammatic top view of the<br>
calibration standard 11 according to the invention.<br>
Figure 2 shows a diagrammatic sectional view along line<br>
I-I in Figure 1. The calibration standard 11 comprises<br>
a basic body 12 which comprises a reception 14 for at<br>
least one carrier plate 16 on which a standard 17 is<br>
applied with a defined thickness.<br><br>
The standard 17 comprises an upper side and an<br>
underside which are polished plane-parallel, especially<br>
polished brightly. The standard 17 is fastened by means<br>
of plating by rubbing on a measuring surface 18 of the<br>
carrier plate 16 which is polished in the same manner<br>
as the standard 17. Due to the effect of the Coulomb<br>
forces, cold welding will thus develop between the<br>
standard 17 and the carrier plate 16. Additionally, in<br>
the transition area or, respectively, the marginal area<br>
of the standard 17 to the measuring surface 18 of the<br>
carrier plate 16, a groove will be formed to protect<br>
this marginal area against corrosion. Accordingly, this<br>
groove only has a sealing effect. The standard 17 can<br>
be provided in layer thicknesses of up to 1,000 m.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the standard 17 is<br>
manufactured as an insulation layer, especially of a<br>
semiconductor material, such as silicon or germanium<br>
for example.<br>
Depressions 21 are provided in the reception 14 of the<br>
basic body 12. Allocated to these depressions 21,<br>
holding devices 22 are provided which each carry the<br>
carrier plate 16. The holding device 22 consists of a<br>
spring-loaded resilient holding element 24 which<br>
extends over the depression 21 and rests on a shoulder<br>
26 limiting the depression 21. This shoulder 26 is used<br>
for the positionally true positioning of the holding<br>
element 24. For example, the holding element 24 is<br>
provided as a disk shaped diaphragm. This disk shaped<br>
diaphragm has, in its center axis, a bearing surface 28<br>
which is intended to receive a connecting piece 29<br>
which carries the carrier plate 16. Opposite the<br>
connecting piece 29, on the underside of the holding<br>
element 24, a damping or spring element 34 is<br>
preferably provided which is propped on the bottom 32<br><br>
of the depression 21. This damping or spring element 34<br>
can be designed as a spiral spring, as a rubber elastic<br>
element or the like. The holding element 2 4 designed as<br>
a disk shaped diaphragm comprises elevations and/or<br>
depressions 33 between a bearing section on shoulder 26<br>
and a bearing surface 28. Depending on the thickness of<br>
the diaphragm, the material of the diaphragm as well as<br>
the developments of the elevations or depressions 33,<br>
the spring force of the diaphragm as well as the spring<br>
excursion can be determined. The holding element 24 is<br>
preferably held on the shoulder 26 by means of gluing<br>
or soldering.<br>
The above described arrangement of a standard 17 on the<br>
carrier plate 16 which is taken up to the basic body 12<br>
by means of the holding device 22 can form a<br>
calibration standard 11 which accordingly only consists<br>
of a standard 17. Alternatively, a plurality of<br>
standards 17 can be arranged lying side by side as is<br>
evident from the exemplary embodiment according to<br>
Figures 1 and 2. The carrier plate 16 is designed, for<br>
example, with a square base area. This has the<br>
advantage that a uniform gap 36 is made possible<br>
between the carrier plate 16 and the basic body 12, as<br>
well as between the carrier plates 16 adjacent to each<br>
other.<br>
Due to the arrangement according to the invention of<br>
the standard 17 or, respectively, of the carrier plate<br>
16 with the standard 17 provided thereon towards the<br>
basic body 12, it will be enabled that the standard 17<br>
is arranged twist-proof towards the basic body, yet<br>
being resiliently movable in its longitudinal center<br>
axis or respectively, along the surface standard versus<br>
the standard 17, and also being held, by the disk<br><br>
shaped diaphragm, in a wobble deflection twist-proof to<br>
the reception 14. This ensures at the same time that,<br>
upon tilting from a rest position, any canting with an<br>
adjacent wall section of the basic body 12 or the<br>
carrier plate 16 will be prevented. At the same time,<br>
the effect will be achieved that the air gap 36 does<br>
not cause any interruption of the radial lines of force<br>
of a sensor element of the measuring probe, thus<br>
achieving a high measuring precision.<br>
Adjacent to the carrier plate 16, a bearing surface 37<br>
is provided on the basic body 12, said surface<br>
preferably lying on the same level to the bearing<br>
surface or, respectively, measuring surface 18 of the<br>
carrier plate 16. Such a bearing surface 37 is designed<br>
as an auxiliary pole to set manual measuring devices<br>
thereon and subsequently set, via a tilting movement of<br>
the manual measuring device, a measuring probe on the<br>
standard 17.<br>
Figure 3 shows such an example of use. A manual<br>
measuring device 41 is set, with a setting foot 42,<br>
onto a bearing surface 37. Following that, a swivel<br>
movement is made whereby a measuring probe 43 is moved<br>
towards the standard 17. In the example of use, a<br>
contact spherical cap 44 of the measuring probe 43 is<br>
set outside of a center axis of the standard 17. A<br>
change of position of the standard 17 from the rest<br>
position is effected thereby. Due to the wobble<br>
reception of the standard 17 via the holding device 22<br>
to the basic body 12, it will be made possible that an<br>
off-center setting can be balanced out by a deflection<br>
movement of the standard 17 so that the standard 17 is<br>
aligned in a tilt-free position to the measuring probe<br>
43. The measuring error resulting due to the tilting<br><br>
can thus be eliminated by means of the wobble<br>
arrangement of the standard 17. A defined deflection of<br>
the standard 17 will be ensured due to the twist-proof<br>
reception of the standard 17 via the holding device 22<br>
to the basic body.<br>
Figure 4 is an enlarged view of a calibration standard<br>
11 according to Figure 2. The left illustration shows<br>
the carrier plate 16 in a rest position. The right<br>
illustration shows the carrier plate 16 in a maximum<br>
deflected position which is limited by the reception 14<br>
or, respectively, by the gap 36 between the carrier<br>
plate 16 and the reception 14. Alternatively, the<br>
holding device 22 can also be designed for a limitation<br>
of the deflection movement.<br>
Such calibration standards 11 can also be used for<br>
hand-held measuring probes which are connected via a<br>
signal line with a device for the non-destructive<br>
measurement of the thickness of thin layers. Also, the<br>
calibration standards 11 are provided for measuring<br>
devices which are held, for example, movably up and<br>
down on a tripod.<br>
An alternative embodiment of a calibration standard 11<br>
shown in Figure 1 can consist in one of the carrier<br>
plates 16 - without a standard 17 applied thereon -<br>
being inserted into the reception 14 of the basic body<br>
12. This carrier plate 16 comprises a measuring surface<br>
18 which is used as a reference surface and is<br>
identically aligned to the additional measuring<br>
surfaces 18 of the additional carrier plate 16. Such a<br>
carrier plate 16 without standard 17 is preferably<br>
arranged in the marginal area of the reception 14. The<br>
carrier plate 16 without standard 17 is preferably<br>
eguivalent to the size of the other carrier plates 16<br><br>
provided in the reception 14. Alternatively, a carrier<br>
plate 16 can also be provided which is smaller with<br>
regard to the surface but is received in a wobbling<br>
manner like the other carrier plates 16.<br>
All of the above mentioned features are, each<br>
separately, essential for the invention and can be<br>
randomly combined with each other.<br><br>
