				<td> NON-LATHERING PERSONAL CARE COMPOSITION  IN THE FORM OF AN ARTICLE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to non-lathering personal care compositions, especially those personal care compositions in the form of an article that is a porous, dissolvable solid structure.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The majority of personal care products in the market today are sold as liquid products. While widely used, liquid products have disadvantages in terms of packaging, storage, transportation, and convenience of use.<br>
Liquid personal care products typically are sold in bottles which add significant cost as well as packaging waste, much of which ends up in land-fills. Liquid personal care products also usually comprise a substantial amount of water in the formula which adds significant weight and size translating into greater shipping and storage costs. Liquid personal care products can also be difficult to use in terms of controlling dosage and the delivery of the product.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a non-lathering dissolvable solid personal care product that can be conveniently and quickly dissolved in the palm of the consumer to reconstitute a liquid product for ease of application to hair and/or skin while providing sufficient topical delivery of active agents for topical hair and/or skin applications. It is a further object of the present invention to provide such a product that can be produced in an economical manner via physical aeration followed by drying.<br>
Existing dissolvable personal care films comprise a water-soluble polymeric structurant and active ingredients. However, in order to achieve the requisite rapid dissolution rates needed for consumer convenience, these films are generally on the order of less man 100 microns thickness (typically 50 microns) and, thereby, are generally of too low a basis weight (typically 50-100 grams of solid per square meter) to enable consumer application of a sufficient dosage of active ingredients for entire body or whole head hair application and performance, i.e., beyond lower dosage applications such as hand cleansing and/or the facial applications.<br>
 In order to achieve sufficient dosage of raw materials within the palm of the consumer for whole head hair and whole body skin applications, relatively high basis weights are needed which requires  objects  with  a substantial  third  dimension  (thickness)  relative  to  thin<br>
films. Moreover, it has also been found that in order for these objects with a substantial third dimension to quickly dissolve in the palm of the consumer to reconstitute a liquid product for ease of application to hair/skin, they not only comprise a water-soluble polymeric structurant in combination with the active ingredients, but also are in the form of a highly porous and predominantly open-celled (vs. closed-celled) solid structure. It is believed that such water-soluble porous solids comprising predominantly open-cells enable rapid water flux inside the structure exposing a multiplicity of additional solid surface area for vastly increased dissolution rates. This is in contrast to water-soluble porous solids comprised of predominantly closed cells whereby the vast majority of the interior cellular surfaces are not rapidly exposed to the water upon wetting with dissolution progressing predominantly via surface erosion and resulting in slower dissolution.<br>
The production of such rapidly dissolvable open-celled porous solid structures via physical aeration typically requires significant surfactancy as a production means to generate the initial wet foam that can then be dried to the porous solid. For cleansing applications, i.e., personal cleansing and hair shampoos, this is not a problem as this surfactancy is also congruent with the desired cleansing product performance (i.e., lathering). However, for non-cleansing applications, i.e., hair conditioning, styling, in-shower body lotions etc., this surfactancy may be problematic as it can adversely affect the deposition of the intended hydrophobic actives to the hair and skin as well as giving un-desirable in-usage signals of lathering/foaming/squeakiness to the consumer that is not congruent with the intended care functions of these products (conditioning, coating, depositing, moisturizing, styling etc.).<br>
It is thus an object of the present invention to discover a means of production of the porous solids via physical aeration (foaming), and also enabling the formation of a predominantly open-celled foam for rapid dissolution, with minimal surfactancy such that the resulting rapidly dissolving porous solid is substantially non-lathering.<br>
Freeze-drying aqueous solutions of water soluble polymeric structurants with other actives is a known method of producing rapidly dispersing or dissolving porous solids with predominantly open cells via sublimation of water from the aqueous mixture leaving behind a skeleton of the dried polymeric structurant. However, freeze-dried porous solids are typically void of plasticizing agents making them rigid and less desirable. Moreover, freeze-drying is an expensive process and less feasible for economical large scale production for personal care applications. Other traditional dissolvable personal care products include porous solids produced by an anhydrous extrusion process and employing volatile blowing agents to produce<br>
the cellular structure via high pressure drop induced expansion of the solid. However, this process is limited to anhydrous solid-sourced surfactants and ingredients which are limited in number and make it more difficult to formulate a personal care product with desired characteristics and performance. It would be highly desirable to produce substantially non-lathering and rapid dissolving porous solids with predominantly open-cells via physical aeration (high shear mechanical stirring or gas injection) and subsequent drying as a more commercially viable production method relative to freeze-drying. However, physical aeration essentially results in an air-in-water high internal phase emulsion (a closed cell wet foam) which upon drying can lead to dried closed cell foam morphology wherein the air bubbles are trapped/encased within the dried polymeric film lamellae or generally collapses into a film in the instances where the foam is unstable.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a substantially non-lathering dissolvable open-celled porous solid personal care product that can be conveniently and quickly dissolved in the palm of the consumer to reconstitute a liquid product for ease of application to hair/skin while providing sufficient topical delivery of active agents for whole head hair and whole body skin applications (with similar performance as today's liquid products). It is a further object of the present invention to provide such a product that can be produced by physical aeration followed by subsequent drying. It is an even further object of the present invention to provide such a product with desirable softness and flexibility.<br>

The present inventors have found mat dissolvable solid personal care products can be prepared that can be conveniently and quickly dissolved in the palm of the consumer to reconstitute a liquid product for ease of application to hair and/or skin while providing sufficient topical delivery of active agents for whole head hair and whole body skin applications (with similar performance as conventional liquid products). It has also been found mat such products can be produced in an economical manner by physical aeration followed by subsequent drying. Additionally, it has been found mat such products can now be produced with desirable softness and flexibility and to be substantially non-lathering.<br>
To meet the above mentioned objects of the present invention, it has been found that a flexible personal care article in the form of a porous dissolvable solid structure can be made comprising ionic surfactant (from about 0% to about 10% anionic surfactant, in one embodiment from about 0% to about 6%, and in another embodiment from about 0% to about 3%); a non-surfactant cosmetic active (from about 1% to about 60% cosmetic active, in one embodiment from about 5% to about 50%, and in another embodiment from about 10% to about 40%); a polymer structurant comprising one or more water-soluble polymers (from about 15% to about<br>
70 wt% polymer structurant, in one embodiment from about 22.5% to about 60%, and in a another embodiment from about 30% to about 50%); and a plasticizer (from about 1% to about 30% plasticizer, in one embodiment from about 3% to about 24%, and in another embodiment from about 5% to about 20%); and wherein the porous dissolvable solid structure has a density of from about 0.03 g/cm3 to about 0.15 g/cm3, in one embodiment from about 0.04 g/cm3 to about 0.12 g/cm3, and in an alternate embodiment from about 0.06 g/cm3 to about 0.10 g/cm3.<br>
In another embodiment, the personal care article has a basis weight of from about 125 grams/m2 to about 1,000 grams/m2, in another embodiment from about 150 grams/m2 to about 800 grams/m2,  in an alternate embodiment from about 200 grams/m2 to about 700 grams/m2, and in still another embodiment from about 300 grams/m2 to about 650 grams/m2; and a thickness as defined herein of from about 0.5 mm to about 10 mm, in one embodiment from about 1 mm to about 7 mm, and in an alternate embodiment from about 2 mm to about 6 mm. In a further embodiment, the personal care article is produced by the process comprising the steps of preparing a pre-mix comprising surfactant, dissolved polymer structurant, and optionally plasticizer, wherein said pre-mix has:from about 15% to 40% total solids; anda viscosity of from about 2,500 cps to 30,000cps; andaerating said pre-mix by introducing a gas into the pre-mix to form a wet aerated pre-mix; and thenforming the wet aerated pre-mix into a desired one or more shapes to form shaped wet pre-mix; and thendrying the shaped wet pre-mix to a desired final moisture content, wherein the moisture content is from about 0.1% to about 15% moisture, to form the personal care article.<br>
According to yet another embodiment of the present invention, the polymer structurant comprises one or more water-soluble polymers wherein at least one of the polymers has a weighted average molecular weight of from about 40,000 to about 500,000, in another embodiment from about 50,000 to about 400,000, in an alternate embodiment from about 60,000 to about 300,000, and in still another embodiment from about 70,000 to about 200,000.<br>
In a particular embodiment, at least one of the one or more water-soluble polymers is chosen such that a 2% by weight aqueous solution of the water-soluble polymer gives a viscosity at 20°C of from about 4 centipoise to about 80 centipoise; in an alternate embodiment from about 5 centipoise to about 70 centipoise; and in another embodiment from about 6 centipoise to about 60 centipoise.<br>
In a another embodiment, the flexible personal care article in the form of a porous dissolvable solid structure, comprises in one embodiment from about 1% to about 50% of a<br>
nonionic surfactant, and in another embodiment from about 5% to about 45% nonionic surfactant, and in another embodiment from about 10% to about 40% nonionic surfactant.<br>
In another embodiment, the flexible personal care article in the form of a porous dissolvable solid structure, comprises from about 1 % to about 50% of a polymeric surfactant, in another embodiment from about 5% to about 45% polymeric surfactant, and in yet another embodiment from about 10% to about 40% polymeric surfactant surfactant.<br>
In the present invention the substantially non-lathering rapidly dissolving porous solids with a predominantly inter-connected, open-celled structure can be produced via physical aeration followed by subsequent drying (as an alternative to conventional freeze drying). This can be accomplished by generating a physically aerated wet foam with a controlled degree of foam instability during the drying process such that the thin film bubble facings drain into the plateau borders concurrent to drying/solidification resulting in a plurality of open channels ("holes" and "struts") and, particularly, without collapse of the foam structure during the drying process thereby maintaining the physical strength and cohesiveness of the solid. Furthermore, it has been found that this instability and coalescence could be controllably manipulated such that the original closed-cell wet foam transforms within the multi-hour drying process into a true open-celled porous structure wherein the plurality of open channels extends to the solid's surface. Historically, when attempting to generate such products, the results were stable wet foams drying to conventional closed-cell solid foams or unstable wet foams drying to collapsed films. It was also surprising and non-intuitive to discover that the aeration to the initial wet foam prior to drying (a lathering process) can surprisingly be achieved in such a manner to produce the requisite open-celled porous structure, but with the resulting rapidly dissolving article being substantially non-lathering during consumer usage. This phenomenon has been achieved by employing special surfactants and surfactant combinations that enable lathering (foam generation) under the high energy processing conditions employed during aeration to produce the structure, but which are substantially non-lathering (little to no foam generation) under the lower energy consumer usage conditions when the solids undergo dissolution. It has been discovered that these two competing performance requirements can be achieved by (i) minimizing the presence of ionic surfactants, (ii) maximizing the presence of non-ionic surfactants and/or polymeric surfactants, (iii) minimizing the overall surfactant levels required for the aeration process, and (iv) combinations thereof.<br>
It has been discovered that such substantially non-lathering open-celled dissolvable porous solids prepared by physical aeration followed by drying can only be achieved within a<br>
narrowly defined theological range as defined above. Achieving the relatively low viscosity range required is problematic due to the typically high polymeric structurant levels required for solid integrity and cohesiveness as well as me desire for minimal water content (to minimize drying times and energy required for production). To achieve the required relatively low viscosity range of the present invention while producing integral and cohesive solid structures, it has been discovered that several compositional strategies can be employed, either alone or in combination, including but not limited to: (i) employing water-soluble polymers within the requisite molecular weight range but with relatively low viscosity build as defined herein; (ii) dilution of the processing mixture with water; (iii) adding electrolyte or hydrotrope to manipulate the viscosity; (iv) adding non-ionic surfactants which achieve a rheology thinning effect, or (v) adding low molecular weight solvents to manipulate the viscosity. Importantly, aerating processing mixtures below the required viscosity range results in less desirable, non-cohesive porous solids.<br>
It has also been found that the above described characteristics of the present invention can be delivered by the production of open-celled porous structures employing either semi-continuous or continuous aeration equipment from the food industry that are used in the manufacture of marshmallows and dehydrated marshmallows.

In one embodiment, both the Tg and the Tm, if any, are within the ranges recited hereinabove.<br>
The organic styling polymers are carbon chains derived from polymerization of hydrophobic monomers such as ethylenically unsaturated monomers, cellulosic chains or other carbohydrate-derived polymeric chains. The backbone may comprise ether groups, ester groups, amide groups, urethanes, combinations thereof, and the like.<br>

The particular selection and combination of monomers for incorporation into the styling polymer will help determine its formulational properties. By appropriate selection and combination of, for example, hydrophilic and hydrophobic monomers, the styling polymer can be optimized for physical and chemical compatibility with the selected styling polymer solvent described hereinafter and other components of the shampoo composition. The selected monomer composition of the organic styling polymer must, however, render the styling polymer water-insoluble but soluble in the selected styling polymer solvent described hereinafter. In this context, the organic styling polymer is soluble in the styling polymer solvent if the organic polymer is solubilized in the solvent at 25° C. at the polymer and solvent concentrations of the shampoo formulation selected.

C. Anti-dandruff Agents<br>
(i). Pvrithione or a Polyvalent metal salt of Pvrithione<br>
 The present may comprise pyrithione or a polyvalent metal salt of pyrithione. Any form of polyvalent metal pyrithione salts may be used, including platelet and needle structures. Salts for use herein include those formed from the polyvalent metals magnesium, barium, bismuth, strontium, copper, zinc, cadmium, zirconium and mixtures thereof, and in one embodiment the salt is formed with zinc. In one embodiment the salt is zinc salt of l-hydroxy-2-pyridinethione (known as "zinc pyrithione" or "ZPT"); ZPT in platelet particle form, wherein the particles have an average size of up to about 20µm, in one embodiment up to about 5µm, in another embodiment up to about 2.5µm.<br>
 Pyridinethione anti-microbial and anti-dandruff agents are described, for example, in U.S.  Pat. No. 2,809,971; U.S. Pat. No. 3,236,733; U.S. Pat. No. 3,753,196; U.S. Pat. No. 3,761,418;<br>
 U.S. Pat. No. 4,345,080; U.S. Pat. No. 4,323,683; U.S. Pat. No. 4,379,753; and U.S. Pat No. 4,470,982.<br>

yet another embodiment from 1:2 to 3:1.<br>
(ii). Furametpyr<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention may comprise furametpyr. Furametpyr is a<br>
fungicide, and more specifically, furametpyr is in the carboxamide class of anti-fungals. While<br>
not being bound by theory, it is generally thought that the furametpyr mechanism is the<br>
inhibition of mitochondrial succinate oxidation.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention can include from about 0.01% to about 3% of a<br>
furametpyr; in another embodiment from about 0.1% to about 2%; in yet another embodiment<br>
from about 0.2% to about 1.5%.<br>
 In the present invention, the combination of furametpyr with pyrithione or the polyvalent metal salts of pyrithione may result in an increase in efficacy of a composition. In an embodiment of the present invention, such an increase may be an increase in efficacy for anti-dandruff.<br>
In a further embodiment of the present invention, furametpyr may also be used in combination with other anti-microbial agents.  Non-limiting examples of other anit-microbial agents are ketoconazole, climbazole, octopirox, salicylic acid, coal tar, selenium sulfide and mixtures thereof. Such combinations of furametpyr with other anti-microbial agents, may result in an increase in efficacy of a composition, and even more particularly, may increase anti-dandruff efficacy.<br>

CAS/Registiy Number:    123572-88-3<br>
 CA Index Name:	lH-Pyrazole-4-carboxamide, 5-chloro-N-(l,3-dihydro-l,l,3-<br>
 trimemyl-4-isobenzofuranyl)-l,3-dimethyl- (9CI)<br>
Trade Names:	Limber®<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
(iii). Particulate Zinc Material<br>
In a further embodiment of the present invention, the composition of the present invention may include an effective amount of a particulate zinc material. Embodiments of the present invention can include from about 0.001% to about 10% of a particulate zinc layered material; in another embodiment from about 0.01% to about 7%; in yet another embodiment from about 0.1% to about 5%.<br>
Particulate zinc materials (PZM's) are zinc-containing materials which remain mostly insoluble within formulated compositions. Many benefits of PZM's require the zinc ion to be chemically available without being soluble, this is termed zinc lability. Physical properties of the particulate material have the potential to impact lability. We have discovered several factors which impact zinc lability and therefore have led to development of more effective formulas based on PZM's.<br>
Particle physical properties which have been found to be important to optimize zinc lability of PZM's are morphology of die particle, surface area, crystallinity, bulk density, surface charge, refractive index, and purity level and mixtures thereof. Control of mese physical properties has been shown to increase product performance.<br>
Examples of particulate zinc materials useful in certain embodiments of the present invention include the following:<br>
Inorganic Materials: Zinc aluminate, Zinc carbonate, Zinc oxide and materials containing zinc oxide (i.e., calamine), Zinc phosphates (i.e., orthophosphate and pyrophosphate), Zinc selenide, Zinc sulfide, Zinc silicates (i.e„ ortho- and meta-zinc silicates), Zinc silicofluoride, Zinc Borate, Zinc hydroxide and hydroxy sulfate, zinc-containing layered materials and combinations thereof.<br>
 Further, layered structures are those with crystal growth primarily occurring in two dimensions. It is conventional to describe layer structures as not only those in which all the atoms are incorporated in well-defined layers, but also those in which there are ions or molecules between the layers, called gallery ions (A.F. Wells "Structural Inorganic Chemistry" Clarendon Press, 1975). Zinc-containing layered materials (ZLM's) may have zinc incorporated in the layers and/or as more labile components of the gallery ions.<br>
 Many ZLM's occur naturally as minerals. Common examples include hydrozincite (zinc carbonate hydroxide), basic zinc carbonate, aurichalcite (zinc copper carbonate hydroxide), rosasite (copper zinc carbonate hydroxide) and many related minerals that are zinc-containing. Natural ZLM's can also occur wherein anionic layer species such as clay-type minerals (e.g., phyllosilicates) contain ion-exchanged zinc gallery ions. All of these natural materials can also be obtained synthetically or formed in situ in a composition or during a production process.<br>
 Another common class of ZLM's, which are often, but not always, synthetic, is layered  doubly hydroxides, which are generally represented by the formula [M2+1_xM3+x(OH)2]x+ Am-x/nrnH20 and some or all of the divalent ions (M2+) would be represented as zinc ions (Crepaldi, EL, Pava, PC, Tronto, J, Valim, JB J. Colloid Interfac Sci. 2002, 248, 429-42).<br>
Yet another class of ZLM's can be prepared called hydroxy double salts (Morioka, H., Tagaya, H., Karasu, M, Kadokawa, J, Chiba, K Inorg. Chem. 1999, 38, 4211-6). Hydroxy double salts can be represented by the general formula [M +i.xM2+1+x(OH)3(1-y)]+ An-(1=3y)/•nH2O where the two metal ion may be different; if they are the same and represented by zinc, the formula simplifies to [Zn1+x(OH)2]2x+ 2x A•nH2O. This latter formula represents (where x=0.4) common materials such as zinc hydroxychloride and zinc hydroxynitrate. These are related to hydrozincite as well wherein the divalent anion is replaced by a monovalent anion. These materials can also be formed in situ in a composition or in or during a production process.<br>
 These classes of ZLM's represent relatively common examples of the general category  and are not intended to be limiting as to the broader scope of materials which fit this definition, including: Natural Zinc containing materials / Ores and Minerals: Sphalerite (zinc blende), Wurtzite, Smithsonite, Franklinite, Zincite, Willemite, Troostite, Hemimorphite and<br>
 combinations thereof. Organic Salts: Zinc fatty acid salts (i.e., caproate, laurate, oleate, stearate, etc.), Zinc salts of alkyl sulfonic acids, Zinc naphthenate, Zinc tartrate, Zinc tannate, Zinc phytate, Zinc monoglycerolate, Zinc allantoinate, Zinc urate, Zinc amino acid salts (i.e., methionate, phenylalinate, tryptophanate, cysteinate, etc) and combinations thereof. Polymeric Salts: Zinc polycarboxylates (i.e., polyacrylate), Zinc polysulfate and combinations thereof. Physically Adsorbed Forms: Zinc-loaded ion exchange resins, Zinc adsorbed on particle surfaces, Composite particles in which zinc salts are incorporated, (i.e., as core/shell or aggregate morphologies) and combinations thereof. Zinc Salts: zinc oxalate, zinc tannate, zinc tartrate, zinc citrate, zinc oxide, zinc carbonate, zinc hydroxide, zinc oleate, zinc phosphate, zinc silicate, zinc stearate, zinc sulfide, zinc undecylate, and the like, and mixtures thereof; in one embodiment the zinc salt is zinc oxide or zinc carbonate basic.<br>
 Commercially available sources of zinc oxide include Z-Cote and Z-Cote HPI (BASF), and USPI and USP H (Zinc Corporation of America).<br>
Commercially available sources of zinc carbonate include Zinc Carbonate Basic (Cater Chemicals: Bensenville, IL, USA), Zinc Carbonate (Shepherd Chemicals: Norwood, OH, USA), Zinc Carbonate (CPS Union Corp.: New York, NY, USA), Zinc Carbonate (Elementis Pigments: Durham, UK), and Zinc Carbonate AC (Bruggemann Chemical: Newtown Square, PA, USA).<br>
 Basic zinc carbonate, which also may be referred to commercially as "Zinc Carbonate" or "Zinc Carbonate Basic" or "Zinc Hydroxy Carbonate", is a synthetic version consisting of materials similar to naturally occurring hydrozincite. The idealized stoichiometry is represented by Zn5(OH)6(CO3)2 but the actual stoichiometric ratios can vary slightly and other impurities may be incorporated in the crystal lattice.<br>
Surfactants<br>
 The surfactant component of the dissolvable porous solid is essential as a processing aide in preparing a stable solid porous structure for the dissolvable porous solids described herein, although it is understood that the surfactant component should not generate substantial lather during consumer usage for the non-lathering porous solids of the present invention. Accordingly, the surfactant component is employed primarily as a process aid in making a stable foam, wherein the surfactant includes conventional surfactants or emulsifiers that need not provide any lathering performance. Examples of emulsifiers for use as a surfactant component herein include mono- and di-glycerides, fatty alcohols, polyglycerol esters, propylene glycol esters, sorbitan esters and other emulsifiers known or otherwise commonly used to stabilized air interfaces, as for example those used during preparation of aerated foodstuffs such as cakes and<br>

personal care components. The dissolvable porous solids can be continuous or discontinuous when used in the personal care compositions. Regardless of the product form, the key to all of the product form embodiments contemplated within the scope of the method of the present invention is the selected and defined dissolvable porous solid that comprises a combination of a solid polymeric structurant and a surfactant-containing active ingredient, all as defined herein.<br>
 The dissolvable porous solids of the present invention are in the form of one or more flat sheets or pads of an adequate size to be able to be handled easily by the user. It may have a square, rectangle or disc shape or any other shape. The pads can also be in the form of a continuous strip including delivered on a tape-like roll dispenser with individual portions dispensed via perforations and or a cutting mechanism. Alternatively, the dissolvable porous solids of the present invention are in the form of one or more cylindrical objects, spherical objects, tubular objects or any other shaped object. The dissolvable porous solids of the present invention can have a thickness (caliper) of from about 0.5 mm to about 10 mm, in one embodiment from about 1 mm to about 7 mm, and in still another embodiment from about 2 mm to about 6 mm. In the case of cylindrical, spherical, or other objects with more of a third dimension versus a pad or strip, the thickness is taken as the maximum distance of the shortest dimension, i.e., the diameter of a sphere or cylinder for instance.<br>
The dissolvable porous solids of the present invention may comprise one or more textured, dimpled or otherwise topographically patterned surfaces including letters, logos or figures. The textured substrate can result from the shape of the substrate, in that the outermost surface of the substrate contains portions that are raised with respect to other areas of the surface. The raised portions can result from the formed shape of the article, for example the article can be formed originally in a dimpled or waffle pattern. The raised portions can also be the result of creping processes, imprinted coatings, embossing patterns, laminating to other layers having raised portions, or the result of the physical form of the dissolvable porous solid substrate itself. The texturing can also be me result of laminating the substrate to a second substrate that is textured.<br>
In a particular embodiment, the dissolvable porous solids of the present invention can be perforated with holes or channels penetrating into or through the porous solid. These perforations can be formed during the drying process via spikes extended from the surface of the underlying mold, belt or other non-stick surface. Alternatively, these perforations can be formed after the drying process via poking or sticking the porous solids with pins, needles or other sharp objects. In one embodiment, these perforations are great in number per surface area, but not so<br>
great in number so as to sacrifice the integrity or physical appearance of the porous solid. It has been found that such perforations increase the dissolution rate of the porous solids into water relative to un-perforated porous solids.<br>

Dissolution Rate<br>
The dissolvable porous solid of present invention has a Dissolution Rate that allows the porous solid to rapidly disintegrate during use with the application with water. The Dissolution Rate of the dissolvable porous solid component is determined in accordance with the methodology described below.<br>
Hand Dissolution Method: Approximately 0.5g of the dissolvable porous solid is placed in the palm of the hand while wearing nitrile gloves. 7.5 cm3 of luke warm tap water (from about 30°C to about 35°C) is quickly applied to the product via syringe. Using a circular motion, palms of hands are rubbed together 2 strokes at a time until dissolution occurs (up to 30 strokes). The hand dissolution value is reported as the number of strokes it takes for complete dissolution or as 30 strokes as the maximum (in the case for where the solid is considered non-dissolving).<br>
The dissolvable porous solids of the present invention have a hand dissolution value of from about 1 to about 30 strokes, in one embodiment from about 2 to about 25 strokes, in another embodiment from about 3 to about 20 strokes, and in still another embodiment from about 4 to about 15 strokes.<br>
Thickness<br>
In one embodiment the dissolvable porous solid of present invention is a flat, flexible substrate in the form of a pad, a strip or tape and having a thickness of from about 0.5 mm to about 10 mm, in one embodiment from about 1 mm to about 7 mm, and in another embodiment from about 2 mm to about 6 mm, as measured by the below methodology. In the case of cylindrical, spherical, or other objects with more of a third dimension versus a pad or strip, the thickness is taken as the maximum distance of the shortest dimension, i.e., the diameter of a sphere or cylinder for instance, and the thickness ranges are the same as described above.<br>
The thickness of the dissolvable porous solid (i.e., substrate or sample substrate) is obtained using a micrometer or thickness gage, such as the Mitutoyo Corporation Digital Disk Stand Micrometer Model Number IDS-1012E (Mitutoyo Corporation, 965 Corporate Blvd, Aurora, IL, USA 60504). The micrometer has a 1 inch diameter platen weighing about 32 grams, which measures thickness at an application pressure of about 40.7 phi (6.32 gm/cm ).<br>
The thickness of the dissolvable porous solid is measured by raising the platen, placing a section of the sample substrate on the stand beneath the platen, carefully lowering the platen to contact the sample substrate, releasing the platen, and measuring the thickness of the sample substrate in millimeters on the digital readout. The sample substrate should be fully extended to all edges of the platen to make sure thickness is measured at the lowest possible surface pressure, except for the case of more rigid substrates which are not flat. For more rigid substrates which are not completely flat, a flat edge of the substrate is measured using only one portion of the platen impinging on the flat portion of the substrate.<br>
Basis Weight<br>
The dissolvable porous solid component of the personal care composition of the present invention has a basis weight of from about 125 grams/m2 to about 3,000 grams/m2, in one embodiment from about 150 grams/m2 to about 1,200 grams/m2, in another embodiment from about 200 grams/m2 to about 1,000 grams/m2, and in still another embodiment from about 300 grams/m2 to about 800 grams/m2.<br>
The Basis Weight of the dissolvable porous solid component of the personal care composition herein is calculated as the weight of the dissolvable porous solid component per area of the selected dissolvable porous solid (grams/m2). The area is calculated as the projected area onto a flat surface perpendicular to the outer edges of the porous solid. For a flat object, the area is thus computed based on the area enclosed within the outer perimeter of the sample. For a spherical object, the area is thus computed based on the average diameter as 3.14 x (diameter/2)2. For a cylindrical object, the area is thus computed based on the average diameter and average length as diameter x length. For an irregularly shaped three dimensional object, the area is computed based on the side with the largest outer dimensions projected onto a flat surface oriented perpendicularly to this side. This can be accomplished by carefully tracing the outer dimensions of the object onto a piece of graph paper with a pencil and then computing the area by approximate counting of the squares and multiplying by the known area of the squares or by taking a picture of the traced area (which can beshaded-in for contrast) including a scale and using image analysis techniques.<br>
Density<br>
The dissolvable porous solid of the personal care compositions described herein can be characterized in terms of a density determination.<br>
The density of the dissolvable porous solid is determined by the equation: Calculated Density = Basis Weight of porous solid / (Porous Solid Thickness x 1,000), wherein the porous solid has a density of from about 0.03 g/cm3 to about 0.4 g/cm3, in one embodiment from about 0.05 g/cm3 to about 0.3 g/cm3, and in another embodiment from about 0.075 g/cm3 to about 0.2 g/cm3. The Basis Weight and Thickness of the dissolvable porous solid are determined in accordance with the methodologies described herein.<br>
Cell Inter-connectivity<br>
The dissolvable porous solid personal care products of the present invention with the above mentioned characteristics have a high degree of cell inter-connectivity, i.e., are predominantly open-celled solid foams as opposed to being predominantly closed-cell solid<br>
foams. The cell inter-connectivity can be assessed by cutting a 2-3 mm wide sliver of the solid in the z-direction using scissors or a sharp blade, measured across the normal x-y largest surface of the solid, and turning the resulting sliver by 90 degrees to reveal the internal cellular structure of the freshly cut cross-sectional area. This cross-sectional area can be assessed by close visual inspection or, more accurately, by employing magnification under a stereo microscope such as the SZX12 Stereo microscope available from Olympus Olympus America Inc., Center Valley, PA. The open-celled dissolvable porous solids of the present invention can easily be identified by examining the inner portion of the cross-sectional area which will comprise a predominantly three dimensional network of struts with open void spaces surrounding the struts that are inter­connected to one another including in the third dimension through the depth of the cross-section. In contrast, the inner cross-section of a closed-cell foam will appear as discrete bubbles that are cut across and then only being inter-connected at the cross-sectional surface in two dimensions by virtue of the cutting process employed to generate the exposed cross-sectional area.<br>
Solid Flexibility and Cohesiveness The physical integrity of the dissolvable porous solids of the present invention (or solid cohesiveness) is assessed via a qualitative rating system by two separate qualitative ratings (1 to 4 scale) on brittleness/flexibility (brittle is breakable) and cohesiveness (ease in removing from molds):<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
 These ratings are assessed on three dimensional molds and resulting flat solids with z-dimension thicknesses between 3 mm and 10 mm and extending in the x-y dimensions encompassing surface areas of between 10 cm and 60 cm (with any x-y shape including circles, ovals, squares, rectangles etc.). The examples herein were evaluated employing circular Teflon molds and resulting removed solids with 4.15 cm diameters and depths of 0.7 cm. The brittleness/flexibility rating is judged by bending the pad in half and assessing each pad on its propensity for breakage/creasing versus the pads resiliency and ability to return to the original shape. The cohesiveness rating is judged by peeling a freshly dried (after at least 20 hours at 40 degrees Celsius) solid from the mold and noting the difficulty of removal.   Solids with low<br>
cohesiveness ratings are difficult to remove from the molds in one piece with significant adhesion to the mold surface and with significant solid remaining adhered to the mold after the solid removal process. Solids with high cohesiveness ratings are easy to peel from the molds in one piece and without significant solid remaining adhered to the mold after the solid removal process.<br>
Lather Volume Method<br>
The dissolvable porous solid personal care compositions of the present invention can be considered substantially non-lathering with very low lather volumes, which in one embodiment is from about 0 ml to about 20 ml, in another embodiment is from about 0 ml to about 15 ml, and in yet another embodiment is from about 0 ml to about 10 ml. For perspective, lathering personal care compositions (i.e., shampoos) typically generate lather volumes from about 70 ml to about 110 ml.<br>
The lather volume assessment is performed on 15g/10" flat Oriental virgin hair switches that have been treated with 0.098g of artificial liquid sebum [10-22% olive oil, 18-20% coconut oil, 18-20% oleic acid, 5-9% lanolin,, 5-9% squalene, 3-6% palmitic acid, 3-6% paraffin oil, 3-6% dodecane, 1-4% stearic acid, 1-4% cholesterol, 1-4% coconut fatty acid, 18-20% choleth-24]. The hair switch is rinsed with 9-11 grain, lOOoF water at 1.5 gallons/min for 20 seconds with a shower nozzle. For testing the liquid control products, 0.75 cm3 of liquid product are applied to the center of the switch, the lower portion of hair on the switch is then rubbed over the product on the hair 10 times in a circular motion, followed by 40 strokes back and forth (a total of 80 strokes). Lather speed is recorded as the number of strokes when the first lather is obviously generated during the 80 strokes. Lather from operator's gloves is transferred to a graduated cylinder with a 3.5 cm inside diameter and with total capacities of either 70 ml, 110 ml, or 140 ml depending on the total amount of lather generated (height modification of standard sized graduated cylinders via a glass shop). Lather from hair is gathered using one downward stroke on the switch with a tight grip and is also placed into the cylinder. Total lather volume is recorded in milliliters. Three runs per test sample are performed and the mean of the three values is calculated. When testing the dissolvable porous solids of the present invention, 0.20 +/- 0.01 grams of product are weighed with the aid of scissors if required and applied to the switch and men 2 cm3 of additional water are added to the product via syringe. The lathering technique is then performed as described for liquid products after a 10 second waiting time. If undissolved material remains in hair, it is removed and the weight is determined when dry.<br>

Discussion of Examples<br>
The above representative examples are intended to demonstrate the key aspects of the present invention. Example 4 is in accordance with the present invention and produced from a processing mixture comprising polyvinyl alcohol, a retail conditioner (Pantene Pro-V), a non-ionic surfactant, and a viscosity of between 7,000 to 9,000 cps at 1 s-1. Accordingly, Example 4 results in predominantly open-celled porous solids with fast dissolution, good flexibility, good cohesiveness and while being substantially non-lathering. Comparative Example 5 is not in accordance with the present invention and produced from a processing mixture comprising polyvinyl alcohol, a retail conditioner (Pantene Pro-V), but with a significantly higher viscosity of between 95,000 to 140,000 cps at 1 s-1. Accordingly, Comparative Example 5 results in predominantly closed-celled porous solids that are non-dissolving as well as having poor flexibility and poor cohesiveness. Example 6 is in accordance with the present invention and produced from the identical starting processing mixture of Example 5, but the processing mixture is diluted widh water to enable a significantly lower viscosity of between 8,000 to 15,000 cps at 1 s-1. Accordingly, Example 6 results in predominantly open-celled porous solids with fast dissolution as well as acceptable flexibility, acceptable cohesiveness and while being<br>
substantially non-lathering. Comparative Example 7 is not in accordance with the present invention and produced from a processing mixture comprising polyvinyl alcohol, a retail conditioner (Pantene Pro-V), but with a viscosity in-between that of Comparative Example 5 and Example 6 of between 30,000 to 35,000 cps at 1 s-1. Accordingly, Comparative Example 7 results in predominantly closed-celled porous solids that are non-dissolving as well as having poor flexibility and poor cohesiveness. Example 8 is in accordance with the present invention and produced from a processing mixture comprising polyvinyl alcohol, a retail conditioner (Matrix Biolage), a non-ionic surfactant, and a viscosity of between 9,500 to 10,500 cps at 1 s-1. Accordingly, Example 8 results in predominantly open-celled porous solids with fast dissolution, good flexibility, good cohesiveness and while being substantially non-lathering.<br>
Collectively, the above examples demonstrate the discovery that non-lathering rapidly dissolving open-celled porous solids according to the present invention can be produced provided that the processing mixture viscosity is within the desired range (or adjusted otherwise). Importantly, this discovery has surprisingly been found to hold true independent of the polymer mixture components (See Comparative Example 5 relative to Example 6 which have the same composition and only differ via dilution of the original processing mixture) which goes against the conventionally accepted wisdom that it is the polymer type, and specifically the molecular weight, that is the primary driver of porous solid dissolution.Moreover, the above examples demonstrate the beneficial effect of an added non-ionic surfactant on the structural properties of the fast dissolving open-celled porous solids (flexibility and cohesiveness) while also not sacrificing the intended consumer perception of the solids being non-lathering during usage.<br>
