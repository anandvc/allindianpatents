				<td>BICYCLIC OXOPYRIDINE AND OXOPYRIMIDINE DERIVATIVES<br>
This invention relates to a series of 5-6 fused ring bicyclic heteroaromatic derivatives, to compositions containing them, to processes for their preparation and to their use in medicine.<br>
Immune and inflammatory responses involve a variety of cell types with control and co-ordination of the various interactions occurring via both cell-cell contacts (e.g integrin interactions with their receptors) and by way of intercellular signalling molecules. A large number of different signalling molecules are involved including cytokines, lymphocytes, chemokines and growth factors.<br>
Cells respond to such intercellular signalling molecules by means of intracellular signalling mechanisms that include protein kinases, phosphatases and phospholipases. There are five classes of protein kinase of which the major ones are the tyrosine kinases and the serine/threonine kinases [Hunter, T., Methods in Enzymology (Protein Kinase Classification) p. 3, Hunter, T. and Sefton, B.M.; eds. Vol. 200, Academic Press; San Diego, 1991],<br>
One sub-class of serine/threonine kinases is the mitogen activating protein (MAP) kinases of which there are at least three families which differ in the sequence and size of the activation loop [Adams, J. L et al, Progress in Medicinal Chemistry p. 1-60, King, F. D. and Oxford, A. W.; eds. vol 38, Elsevier Science, 2001]: the extracellular regulated kinases (ERKs), the c-Jun NH2 terminal kinases or stress activated kinases (JNKs or SAP kinases) and the p38 kinases which have a threonine-glycine-tyrosine (TGY) activation motif. Both the JNKs and p38 MAP kinases are primarily activated by stress stimuli including, but not limited to, proinflammatory cytokines e.g.<br><br>
tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1 (IL-1), ultraviolet light, endotoxin and chemical or osmotic shock,<br>
Four isoforms of p38 have been described (p38o/P/Y/6). The human p38a enzyme was initially identified as a target of cytokine-suppressive anti-inflammatory drugs (CSAIDs) and the two isoenzymes found were initially termed CSAID binding protein-1 (CSBP-1) and CSBP-2 [Lee, J. C. et al, Nature (London) 1994, 372. 739-46], CSBP-2 is. now widely referred to as p38a and differs from CSBP-1 in an internal sequence of 25 amino acids as a result of differential splicing of two exons that are conserved in both mouse and human [McDonnell, P. C. et al, Genomics 1995, 29, 301-2]. CSBP-1 and p38cx are expressed ubiquitously and there is no difference between the two isoforms with respect to tissue distribution, activation profile, substrate preference or CSAID binding. A second isoform is p38p which has 70% identity with p38cc. A second form of p38p termed p38|J2 is also known and of the two this is believed to be the major form. p38a and p38(32 are expressed in many different tissues. However in monocytes and macrophages p38oc is the predominant kinase activity [Lee, J. C., ibid; Jing, Y. et al, J. Biol. Chem. 1996, 271, 10531-34; Hale, K. K. et al, J. Immun. 1999, 162. 4246-52]. p38y and p388 (also termed SAP kinase-3 and SAP kinase-4 respectively) have 63% and -61% homology to p38a respectively. p38y is predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle whilst p388 is found in testes, pancreas, prostate, small intestine and in certain endocrine tissues.<br>
All p38 homologues and splice variants contain a 12 amino acid activation loop that includes a Thr-Gly-Tyr motif. Dual phosphorylation of both Thr-180 and Tyr-182 in the TGY motif by a dual specificity upstream kinase is essential for the activation of p38 and results in a &gt;1000-fold increase in specific activity of these enzymes [Doza, Y. N. et al FEBS Lett., 1995, 364,<br><br>
7095-8012]. This dual phosphorylation is effected by MKK6 and under certain conditions the related enzyme MKK3 (see Figure 1) [Enslen, H. et al J. Biol. Chem., 1998, 273, 1741-48]. MKK3 and MKK6 belong to a family of enzymes termed MAPKK (mitogen activating protein kinase kinase) which are in turn activated by MAPKKK (mitogen activating kinase kinase kinase) otherwise known as MAP3K,<br>
Several MAPSKs have been identified that are activated by a wide variety of stimuli including environmental stress, inflammatory cytokines and other factors. MEKK4/MTK1 (MAP or ERK kinase kinase/MAP three kinase-1), ASK1 (apoptosis stimulated kinase) and TAK1 (TGF-p-activated kinase) are some of the enzymes identified as upstream activators of for MAPKKs. MEKK4/MTK1 is thought to be activated by several GADD-45-like genes that are induced in response to environmental stimuli and which eventually lead to p38 activation [Takekawa, M. and Saito, H. Cell, 1998, 95, 521-30]. TAK1 i ias been shown to activate MKK6 in response to transforming growth factor-(â€¢$ (TGF-fi). TNF-stimulated activation of p38 is believed to be mediated by the recruitment of TRAF2 [TNF receptor associated factor] and the Fas adaptor protein, Daxx, which results in the activation of ASK1 and subsequently p38.<br>
Several substrates of p38 have been identified including other kinases [e.g. MAPK activated protein kinase 2/3/5 (MAPKAP 2/3/5), p38 regulated/activated protein kinase (PRAK), MAP kinase-interacting kinase 1/2 (MNK1/2), mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 1 (MSK1/RLPK) and ribosomal S6 kinase-B (RSK-B)], transcription factors [e.g. activating transcription factor 2/6 (ATF2/6), monocyte-enhancer factor-2A/C (MEF2A/C), C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), Elk1 and Sap-1a1] and others substrates [e.g. cPLA2, p47phox].<br><br>
MAPKAP K2 is activated by p38 in response to environmental stress. Mice engineered to lack MAPKAP K2 do not produce TNF in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Production of several other cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, IFN-g and IL-10 is also partially inhibited [Kotlyarov, A. et al Nature Cell Biol. 1999, 1, 94-7]. Further, MAPKAP K2 from embryonic stem cells from p38a null mice was not activated in response to stress and these cells did not produce IL-6 in response to IL-1 [Allen, M. et al, J. Exp. Med. 2000, 191. 859-69], These results indicate that MAPKAP K2 is not only essential for TNF and IL-1 production but also for signalling induced by cytokines. In addition MAPKAP K2/3 phosphorylate and thus regulate heat shock proteins HSP 25 and HSP 27 which are involved in cytoskeletal reorganization.<br>
Several small molecule inhibitors of p38 have been reported which inhibit IL-1 and TNF synthesis in human monocytes at concentrations in the low \M range [Lee, J. C. et al, Int. J. Immunopharm. 1988, 10, 835] and exhibit activity in animal models which are refractory to cyclooxygenase inhibitors [Lee, J. C. et ai, Annals N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993, 696. 149]. In addition these small molecule inhibitors are known to also decrease the synthesis of a wide variety of pro-inflammatory proteins including IL-6, IL-8, granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). TNF-induced phosphorylation and activation of cytosolic PLA2, TNF-induced expression of VCAM-1 on endothelial cells and IL-1 stimulated synthesis of collagenase and stromelysin are also inhibited by such small molecule inhibitors of p38 [Cohen, P. Trends Cell Biol. 1997, 7, 353-61].<br>
A variety of cells including monocytes and macrophages produce TNF and IL-1. Excessive or unregulated TNF production is implicated in a number of disease states including Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, pyresis, rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatoid spondylitis, osteoarthritis, gouty arthritis and<br><br>
other arthritic conditions, toxic shock syndrome, endotoxic shock, sepsis, septic shock, gram negative sepsis, bone resporption diseases, reperfusion injury, graft vs. host reaction, allograft rejection, adult respiratory distress syndrome, chronic pulmonary inflammatory disease, silicosis, pulmonary sarcoisosis, cerebral malaria, scar tissue formation, keloid formation, fever and myalgias due to infection, such as influenza, cachexia secondary to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), cachexia secondary to infection or malignancy, AIDS or AIDS related complex.<br>
Excessive or unregulated IL-1 production has been implicated in rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, traumatic arthritis, rubella arthritis, acute synovitis, psoriatic arthritis, cachexia, Reiter's syndrome, endotoxemia, toxic shock syndrome, tuberculosis, atherosclerosis, muscle degeneration, and other acute or chronic inflammatory diseases such as-the inflammatory reaction induced by endotoxin or inflammatory bowel disease. In addition IL-1 has been linked to diabetes and pancreatic |3 cells [Dinarello, C. A. J. Clinical Immunology, 1985, 5, 287-97].<br>
IL~8 is a chemotactic factor produced by various cell types including endothelial cells, mononuclear cells, fibroblasts and keratinocytes. IL-1, TNF and LPS all induce the production of IL-8 by endothelial cells. In vitro IL-8 has been shown to have a number of functions including being a chemoattractant ior neutrophils, T-lymphocytes and basophils. IL-8 has also been shown to increase the surface expression of Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18) on neutrophils without de novo protein synthesis which may contribute to increased adhesion of neutrophils to vascular endothelial cells. Many diseases are characterised by massive neutrophil infiltration. Histamine release from basophils (in both atopic and normal individuals) is induced by IL-8 as is lysozomal enzyme release and respiratory burst from neutrophils.<br><br>
The central role of IL-1 and TNF together with other leukocyte derived cytokines as important and critical inflammatory mediators is well documented. The inhibition of these cytokines has been shown or would be expected to be of benefit in controlling, alleviating or reducing many of these disease states.<br>
The central position that p38 occupies within the cascade of signalling molecules mediating extracellular to intracellular signalling and its influence over not only IL-1, TNF and IL-8 production but also the synthesis and/or action of other pro-inflammatory proteins (e.g. IL-6, GM-CSF, COX-2, collagenase and stromelysin) make it an attractive target for inhibition by small molecule inhibitors with the expectation that such inhibition would be a highly effective mechanism for regulating the excessive and destructive activation of the immune system. Such an expectation is supported by the potent and diverse anti-inflammatory activities described for p38 kinase inhibitors [Adarns, ibid; Badger, et al, J. Pharm. Exp. Ther. 1996, 279. 1453-61; Griswold, etal, Pharmacol. Comm., 1996, 7, 323-29].<br>
Japanese patent application No. JP09059276 describes a series of pyrazalopyridinones and analogs with utility as herbicides.<br>
We have now found a group of compounds which are potent and selective inhibitors of p38 kinase (p38a, p, 6 arid y)and the isoforms and splice variants thereof, especially p38a, p38p and p38|32. The compounds are thus of use in medicine, for example in the prophylaxis and treatment of immune or inflammatory disorders as described herein.<br><br>

This invention more specifically relates to a method of inhibiting the production of IL-8 in a mammal in need thereof.<br>
This invention more specifically relates to a method of inhibiting the production of TNF in a mammal in need thereof.<br>
This invention more specifically relates to the administration to a mammal of an effective amount of a p38 kinase or cytokine, specifically IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 or INF, inhibitor of formula (1 a) or (1 b).<br>
Compounds according to the invention are potent and selective inhibitors of p38 kinases, including all isoforms and splice variants thereof. More specifically the compounds of the invention are inhibitors of p38ce, p38p and p38(i2. The ability of the compounds to act in this way may be simply determined by employing tests such as those described in the Examples hereinafter.<br>
The compounds of formula (1) are of use in modulating the activity of p38 kinases and in particular are of use in the prophylaxis and treatment of any p38 kinase mediated diseases or disorders in a human, or other mammal. The invention extends to such a use and to the use of the compounds for the manufacture of a medicament for treating such diseases or disorders. Further the invention extends to the administration to a human an effective amount of<br>
â€¢,;<br>
a p38 inhibitor for treating any such disease or disorder.<br>
The invention also extends to the prophylaxis or treatment of any disease or disorder in which p38 kinase plays a role including conditions caused by excessive or unregulated pro-inflammatory cytokine production including for example excessive or unregulated TNF, IL-1, IL-6 and IL-8 production in a human, or other mammal. The invention extends to such a use and to the use of the compounds for the manufacture of a medicament for treating such cytokine-mediated diseases or disorders. Further the invention extends to the administration to a human an effective amount of a p38 inhibitor for treating any such disease or disorder.<br>
Diseases or disorders in which p38 kinase plays a role either directly or via pro-inflammatory cytokines including the cytokines TNF, IL-1, IL-6 and IL-8 include without limitation autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, destructive-bone disorders, proliferative disorders, neurodegenerative disorders, viral diseases, allergies, infectious diseases, heart attacks, angiogenic disorders, reperfusion/ischemia in stroke, vascular hyperplasia, organ hypoxia, cardiac hypertrophy, thrombin-induced platelet aggregation and conditions associated with prostaglandin endoperoxidase synthetase-2 (COX-2).<br>
Autoimmune diseases which may be prevented or treated include but are not limited to rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, glomerulonephritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, chronic thyroiditis, Grave's disease, s hemolytic anemia, autoimmune gastritis, autoimmune neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, chronic active hepatitis, myasthenia gravis, atopic dermatitis, graft vs, host disease or psoriasis.<br>
The   invention   further   extends   to  the   particular   autoimmune   disease     rheumatoid arthritis.<br>
Inflammatory diseases which may be prevented or treated include but are not limited to asthma, allergies, respiratory distress syndrome or acute or chronic<br>
pancreatitis.<br><br>
Destructive bone disorders which may be prevented or treated include but are not limited to osteoporosis, osteoarthritis and multiple myeloma-related bone disorder.<br>
Proliferative diseases which may be prevented or treated include but are not limited to acute or chronic myelogenous leukemia, Kaposi's sarcoma, metastic melanoma and multiple myeloma,<br>
Neurodegenerative diseases which may be prevented or treated include but   are   not   limited   to  Parkinson's  disease,  Alzheimer's  disease,   cerebral ischemias or neurodegenerative disease caused by traumatic injury.<br>
Viral diseases which may be prevented or treated include but are not limited to acute hepatitis infection (including hepatitis A, hepatitis B and hepatitis C),<br>
    HIV infection and CMV retinitis.<br>
infectious diseases which may be prevented or treated include but are not limited to septic shock, sepsis and Shigellosis,<br>
In addition, p38 inhibitors of this invention also exhibit inhibition of expression ot inducible pro-inflammatory proteins such as prostaglandin endoperoxidase synthetase-2, otherwise known as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and are therefore of use in therapy. Pro-inflammatory mediators of the oyclooxygenase pathway derived from arachidonic acid are produced by inducible COX-2 enzyme. Regulation of COX-2 would regulate these pro-inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins, which affect a wide variety of cells and are important and critical inflammatory mediators of a wide variety of disease states and conditions. In particular these inflammatory mediators have been implicated in pain, such as in the serisitization of pain receptors, or edema. Accordingly additional p38 mediated conditions which may be prevented or treated include edema, analgesia, fever and pain such as neuromuscular pain, headache, dental pain, arthritis pain and pain caused by cancer.<br>
As a result of their p38 inhibitory activity, compounds of the invention have utility in the prevention and treatment of diseases associated with cytokine production including but not limited to those diseases associated with TNF, IL-1, IL-6 and IL-8 production.<br>
Thus TNF mediated diseases or conditions include for example rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatoid spondylitis, osteoarthritis, gouty arthritis and other arthritic conditions, sepsis, septic shock syndrome, adult respiratory distress syndrome, cerebral malaria, chronic pulmonary inflammatory disease, silicosis, pulmonary sarcoiosis, bone resportion disease, reperfusion injury, graft vs. host reaction, allograft rejections, fever and myalgias due to<br>
infection, cachexia secondary to infection, AIDS, ARC or malignancy, keloid formation, scar tissue formation, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, pyresis, viral infections such as HIV, CMV, influenza and herpes; and vetinary viral infections, such as lentivirus infections, including but not limited to equine infectious anemia virus, caprine arthritis virus, visna virus or maedi virus; or retrovirus infections, including feline immunodeficiency virus, bovine immunodeficiency virus or canine immunodeficiency virus.<br>
Compounds of the invention may also be used in the treatment of viral infections, where such viruses elicit TNF production in vivo or are sensitive to upregulation by TNF. Such viruses include those that produce TNF as a result of infection and those that are sensitive to inhibition, for instance as a result of decreased replication, directly or indirectly by the TNF inhibiting compounds of the invention. Such viruses include, but are not limited to, HIV-1, HIV-2 and HIV-3, Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Influenza, adenovirus and the Herpes group of viruses such as Herpes Zoster and Herpes Simplex.<br>
IL-1 mediated diseases or conditions include for example rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, traumatic arthritis, rubella arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, stroke, endotoxemia and/or toxic shock syndrome, inflammatory reaction induced by endotoxin, diabetes, pancreatic \\-ce\\ disease, Alzheimer's disease, tuberculosis, atherosclerosis, muscle ciegeneration and cachexia.<br>
IL-8 mediated diseases and conditions include for example those characterized by massive neutrophil infiltration such as psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, asthma, cardiac, brain and renal reperfusion injury, adult respiratory distress syndrome, thrombosis and glomerulonephritis. The increased IL-8 production associated with each of these diseases is responsible for the chemotaxis of neutrophils into<br>
inflammatory sites. This is due to the unique property of IL-8 (in comparison to TNF, IL-1 and IL-6) of promoting neutrophil chemotaxis and activation. Therefore, inhibition of IL-8 production would lead to a direct reduction in neutrophil infiltration.<br>
It is also known that both IL-6 and IL-8 are produced during rhinovirus (HRV) infections and contribute to the pathogenesis of the common cold and exacerbation of asthma associated with HRV infection [Turner et al, Clin. Infec. Dis., 1997, 26, 840; Grunberg et al, Am. J. Grit. Care Med. 1997, 155. 1362; Zhu etal, J. Clin. Invest. 1996, 97, 421]. It has also been demonstrated in vitro that infection of pulmonary epithelial cells (which represent the primary site of infection by HRV) with HRV results in production of IL-6 and IL-8 [Sabauste ef al, J. Clin. Invest. 1995, 96, 549]. Therefore, p38 inhibitors ot the invention may be used for the treatment or prophylaxis of the common cold or respiratory viral infection caused by human rhinovirus infection (HRV), other enteroviruses, coronavirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus or adenovirus infection.<br>
For the prophylaxis or treatment of a p38 or pro-inflammatory cytokine mediated disease the compounds according to the invention may be administered to a human or mammal as pharmaceutical compositions, and according to a further aspect of the invention we provide a pharmaceutical composition which comprises a compound of formula (1a) or (1b) together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients or diluents.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention may take a form suitable for oral, buccal, parenteral, nasal, topical, ophthalmic or rectal administration, or a form suitable for administration by inhalation or insufflation.<br>
For oral administration, the pharmaceutical compositions may take the form of, for example, tablets, lozenges or capsules prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as binding agents (e.g. pregelatinised maize starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose); fillers (e.g. lactose, microcrystalline cellulose or calcium hydrogen phosphate); lubricants (e.g. magnesium stearate, talc or silica); disintegrants (e.g. potato starch or sodium glycollate); or wetting agents (e.g. sodium lauryl sulphate). The tablets may be coated by methods well known in the art. Liquid preparations for oral administration may take the form of, for example, solutions, syrups or suspensions, or they may be presented as a dry product for constitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may be prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable additives such as suspending agents, emulsifying agents, non-aqueous vehicles and preservatives. The preparations may also contain buffer salts, flavouring, colouring and sweetening agents as appropriate.<br>
Preparations for oral administration may be suitably formulated to give controlled release of the active compound.<br>
For buccal administration the compositions may take the form of tablets or lozenges formulated in conventional manner.<br>
The compounds of formula (1a) or (1b) may be formulated for parenteral administration by injection e.g. by bolus injection or infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form, e.g. in glass ampoule or multi dose containers, e.g. glass vials. The compositions for injection may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilising, preserving and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active<br>
ingredient may be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g. sterile pyrogen-free water, before use.<br>
in addition to the formulations described above, the compounds of formula (1a) or (1b) may also be formulated as a depot preparation. Such long acting formulations may be administered by implantation or by intramuscular<br>

It will be appreciated that when two Rr or R12 groups are present in one of the above substituents the R11 and R12 groups may be the same or different.<br>
When in the group -L6Alk5(R10a)r r is an integer 1, 2 or 3, it is to be understood that the substituent or substituents R10a may be present on any suitable carbon atom in -Alk5. Where more than one R10a substituent is present these may be<br><br>
the same or different and may be present on the same or different atom in -Alk5. Clearly, when r is zero and no substituent R10a is present the alkylene, alkenylene or alkynylene chain represented by Alk5 becomes an alkyl, alkenyl<br>
or alkynyl group.<br>
When R10a is a substituted amino group it may be for example a group -NHR11 Iwhere R11 is as defined above] or a group -N(R11)2 wherein each R11 group is the same or different.<br>
When R10n is a halogen atom it may be for example a fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine atom.<br>
When R10a is a substituted hydroxyl or substituted thiol group it may be for example a group -OR11 or a -SR12 group respectively.<br>
Esterified carboxyl groups represented by the group R10a include groups of formula -CO2Alk6 wherein Alk6 is a straight or branched, optionally substituted C,.8alkyl group such as a methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, i-propyl, n-butyl, i-butyl, s-butyl or t-butyl group; a Ce-iaarylCi-salkyI group such as an optionally substituted benzyl phenylethyl, phenylpropyl, 1-naphthylmethyl or 2-naphthylmethyl group; a C6.12aryi group such as an optionally substituted phenyl, 1-naphthyl or 2-naphthyl group; a C6-i2aryloxyCi.8alkyl group such as an optionally substituted phenyloxymethyl, phenyloxyethyl, 1 -naphthyloxymethyl, or 2-naphthyloxymethyl group; an optionally substituted Ci-salkanoyloxyCvaalkyl group, such as a pivaloyloxymethyl, propionyloxyethyl or propionyloxypropyl group; or a C6. loaroyloxyd-aalkyl group such as an optionally substituted benzoyloxyethyl or benzoyloxypropyl group. Optional substituents present on the Alk6 group include R10a atoms and groups as described above.<br><br>
When Allo1 is present in or as a substituent it may be for example a -CH2-, -CH(CH3)-, -C(CH3)sr, -CH2CH2-, -CH2CH2CH2-, -CH(CH3)CH2-, -CH2CH2CH2CH2-, -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-, -CH(CH3)CH2CH2-, -C(CH3)2CH2-, -CH=CH-, -CH=CCH2-, -CH2C=CH-, -CH=CHCH2CH2-, -CH2CH=CHCH2-, -CH2CH2CH=CH2-, -CC-, -CCCH2-, -CH2CC-, -CCÂ£H2CH2-, -CH2CCCH2- or -CHpCHgCC- chain, optionally interrupted by one, two, or three -O- or -S-, atoms or -S(O)-, -S(O)r or -N(R12)-, e.g. -N(CH3)- groups. The aliphatic chains represented by Alk6 may be optionally substituted by one, two or three halogen atoms in addition to any R10a groups that may be present.<br>
Aryl or heteroaryl groups represented by the groups R10a or R11 include mono-or bicyclic optionally substituted C6-12 aromatic or C^g heteroaromatic groups as described above for the group Cy1. The aromatic and heteroarornatic groups may be attached to the group Cy1 in compounds of formula (1) by any carbon or hetero e.g. nitrogen atom as appropriate.<br>
It will be appreciated that when -NHet1 or -Met forms part of a substituent R10 the heteroatoms or heteroatom containing groups that may be present within the ring -NHet1 or -Met take the place of carbon atoms within the parent carbocyclic<br>
ring.<br>
Thus when -NHet1 or -Het forms part of a substituent R10 each may be for example an optionally substituted pyrrolidinyl, imidazolidinyl, pyrazolidinyl, piperazinyl, morpholinyl, thiomorpholinyl, piperidinyl or thiazolidinyl group. Additionally Het may represent for example, an optionally substituted cyclopentyl or cyclohexyl group. Optional substituents which may be present on -NHet1 include those substituents described above when Cy1 is a heterocycloaliphatic group.<br><br>

The compounds of the invention may be prepared by a number of processes as generally described below and more specifically in the Examples hereinafter. In the following process description, the symbols Ar, Cy1, Alk1, n, I 1 Ra Rb R'; A, X and Y when used in the formulae depicted are to be understood to represent those groups described above in relation to formulae (1a) and (1b) unless otherwise indicated. In the reactions described below, it may be necessary to protect reactive functional groups, for example hydroxy, amino, thio or carboxy groups, where these are desired in the final product, to avoid their unwanted participation in the reactions. Conventional protecting groups may be used in accordance with standard practice [see, for example, Green, T. W. in "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", John Wiley and Sons, 1999]. In some instances, deprotection may be the final step in the synthesis of a compound of formula (1) and the processes according to the invention described hereinafter are to be understood to extend to such removal of protecting groups. For convenience the processes described below all refer to a preparation of a compound of formula (1a) or (1b) but clearly the description applies equally to the preparation of compounds of formula (2a).<br><br>
Thus according to a further aspect of the invention a compound of formula 11 a) in which Y is a substituted e.g. -CO2CH2CH3 substituted C atom may be prepared according to the reactions set out in Scheme 1:<br>
 (Figure Remove)<br>
Thus a compound of formula (1a) in which Y is a substituted C atom may be prepared by reaction of a compound of formula (7) with an alkylating agent of formula Cy1L1(Alk1)nZ, where Z is a leaving group such as a halogen atom, (j.g. a chlorine, bromine or iodine atom or a sulphonyloxy group such as an alkylsulphonyloxy e.g. trifluoromethylsulphonyloxy or arylsulphonyloxy e.g. phenylsulphonyloxy group.<br>
The reaction may be performed in the presence of a solvent, for example a<br>
substituted amide such as dimethylformamide, optionally in the presence of a<br>
base, for example an inorganic base such as sodium hydride, or an organic<br>
base such as an organic amine, e.g. a cyclic amine such as 1,5-<br>
diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-5-ene or a resin bound organic amine such as resin<br>
bound	2-ter?-butylimino-2-diethylamino-1,3-dimethyl-perhydro-1,3,2-<br>
diazaphosphorine (PS-BEMP), at an elevated temperature, for example 80 to 100SC.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention a compound of formula (1a) in which, for example, L1 is a covalent bond and n is zero may be prepared by the reaction of a compound of formula (7) with a boronic acid of formula Cy'B(OH)2. The reaction may be performed in an organic solvent, for example a halogenated hydrocarbon such as dichloromethane or dichloroethane in the presence of a copper reagent, for example a copper (II) reagent such as copper (II) acetate, optionally in the presence of an oxidant, for example 2,2,6,6-tetramethyM-piperidinyloxy or pyridine-N-oxide, optionally in the presence of a base, for example an organic amine such as an alkylamine, e.g. triethylamine or an aromatic amine, e.g. pyridine at a temperature from around ambient to the reflux temperature [see for example Chan, D.T, et al Tetrahedron Letters, 1998, 2933; Lam, P.Y.S. et al, Tetrahedron Letters, 2001, 3415]<br>
Clearly the reactions just described may be used to prepare other compounds of the invention starting from intermediates of formula (7a) or (7b):<br>
(Figure Remove)  <br>

Intermediates of formula (25) may be prepared from intermediates of formula (24) by cleavage of an ether group. Thus when R31 is a benzyl group it may be cleaved by such well known methods as catalytic reduction with hydrogen 
 <br>
acetonitrile [according to the methods of Kundu, N. G. et al, J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I, 1990, 1822].<br>
Intermediates of formula (25) may also be prepared from intermediates of formula (23) sequential by base hydrolysis, for example soudium or potassium hydroxide hydrolysis in a solvent such as an alcohol, e.g. tnethanol or ethanol at an elevated temperature, e.g. the reflux temperture, followed by re-esterification by reaction with .an acidified alcohol, e.g hydrogen chloride saturated ethanol at an elevated temperature, e.g. the reflux temperature.<br>
Intermediates of formula (24) may be prepared from intermediates of formula (23) by reaction with an alkoxide, e.g. sodium methoxide or sodium benzyloxide in a solvent such as an alcohol, e.g. methanol or ethanol at a temperture between about OeC and the reflux temperature. Alternatively the reaction may be performed with an alcohol, e.g. methanol or benzyl alcohol in the presence of a strong base, e.g. a hydride such as sodium hydride in an inert solvent such as an amide, e.g. dimethylformamide at a temperature between about OaC and 809C<br>
Intermediates of formula (23) may be formed from intermediates of formula (22) in a similar manner to that described for the preparation of intermediates of formula (5) form intermediates of formula (4).<br>
intermediates of formula (22) may be formed from intermediates of formula (21) by reaction with a strong base, e.g. lithium tetramethylpiperidine (LiTMP) in a solvent or mixture of solvents, for example an ether such as diethyl ether of tetrahydrofuran or a mixture thereof at a low temperature, e.g. around -100SC to form a lithium anion [according to the methods of Queguiner et al, J. Met. Chem. 1990, 27, 1377 and Mattson era/, J. Org. Chem. 1990, 55, 3410]<br><br>

Compounds of the invention and intermediates thereto where A represents a -N(Rb)- or -C(Rb)(Rc)- group may be generated from compounds of the invention or intermediates thereto where A represents a -N= or -C(Rb)= group by reduction, for instance by catalytic hydrogenation using a metal catalyst such as palladium on charcoal in the presence of hydrogen gas at an elevated pressure in a solvent such as an alcohol, e.g. ethanol optionally at an elevated temperaure e.g. between 40 and 60e.<br>
Where in the general processes described above intermediates such as alkylating agents of formula Cy1L1(Alk1)nZ, amides of formula ArC(O)N(OMe)Me, reagents of formula HXCH2CO2Et and nitroaromatics of formula (18) and any other intermediates required in the synthesis of compounds of the invention are not available commercially or known in the literature, they may be readily obtained from simpler known compounds by one or more standard synthetic methods employing substitution, oxidation, reduction or cleavage reactions. Particular substitution approaches include conventional alkylation, arylation, heteroarylation, acylation, thioacylation, halogenation, sulphonylation, nitration, formylation and coupling procedures. It will be appreciated that these methods may also be used to obtain or modify other intermediates and in particular compounds of formulae (1a) and<br><br>
(1b) where appropriate functional groups exist in these compounds. Particular examples of such methods are given in the Examples hereinafter.<br>
Thus for example aromatic halogen substituents in the compounds may be subjected to halogen-metal exchange with a base, for example a lithium base such as n-tautyl or t-butyl lithium, optionally at a low temperature, e.g. around<br>
78Â°C, in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran and then quenched with an electrophile to introduce a desired substituent. Thus, for example, a formyl group may be introduced by using dimethylformamide as the electrophile, a thiomethyl group may be introduced by using dimethyldisulphide as the olectrophile, an alcohol group may be introduced by using an aldehyde as electrophile and an acid may be introduced by using carbon dioxide as eiectrophile. Aromatic acids of formula ArCOaH may also be generated by quenching Grignard reagents of formula ArMgHal with carbon dioxide.<br>
Aromatic acids of formula ArCO2H generated by this method and acid containing compounds in general may be converted to activated derivatives, e.g. acid halides by reaction with a halogenating agent such as a thionyl halide e.g. thionyl chloride, a phosphorous trihalide such as phosphorous trichloride or a phosphorous pentahalide such as phosphorous pentachloride optionally in an inert solvent such as an aromatic hydrocarbon e.g. toluene or .1 chlorinated hydrocarbon e.g. dichloromethane at a temperature from about 0Â°C to the reflux temperature, or may be converted into Weinreb amides of formula ArC(O)N(OMe)Me by conversion to the acid halide as just described and subsequent reaction with an arnine of formula HN(OMe)Me or a salt thereof, optionally in the presence of a base such as an organic amine, e.g. triethylamine in an inert solvent such as an aromatic hydrocarbon e.g. toluene or a chlorinated hydrocarbon e.g. dichloromethane at a temperature from about 0Â°C to ambient temperature.<br><br>
Compounds of the invention and intermediates thereto such as compounds of formulae (5), (6), (7), (13) and (14) may be prepared by alkylation, arylation or heteroarylation. For example, compounds containing a -L1H group (where L1 is a linker atom or group) may be treated with an alkylating agent Cy1!2 in which Z2 is a leaving atom or group such as a halogen atom, e.g. a fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine atom or a sulphonyloxy group such as an alkylsulphonyloxy, e.g. trifluoromethylsulphonyloxy or arylsulphonyloxy, e.g. p-toluenesulphonyloxy group.<br>
The reaction may be carried out in the presence of a base such as a carbonate, e.g. caesium or potassium carbonate, an alkoxide, e.g. potassium i-butoxide, or a hydride, e.g. sodium hydride, in a dipolar aprotic solvent such as an amide, e.g. a substituted amide such as dimethylformamide or an ether, e.g. a cyclic ether such as tetrahydrofuran.'<br>
In another example, compounds containing a -L2H group as defined above may be functionalised by acylation or thioacylation, for example by reaction with the alkylating agents just described but in which Z2 is replaced by a -C(O)Z3, C(S)Z3, -N(R2)COZ3or -N(R2)C(S)Z3 group in which Z3 is a leaving atom or group as described for Z2. The reaction may be performed in the presence of a base, such as a hydride, e.g. sodium hydride or an amine, e.g. triethylamine or N-methylmorpholine, in a solvent such as a halogenated hydrocarbon, e.g. dichloromethane or carbon tetrachloride or an amide, e.g. dimethylformamide, at for example ambient temperature. Alternatively, the acylation may be carried out under the same conditions with an acid (for example one of the alkylating agents described above in which Z2 is replaced by a -COjH group) in the presence of a condensing agent, for example a diimide such as 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide or N,N'-ciicyclohexylcarbodiimide, or a benzotriazole such as [O-(7-azabenzo-triazol-i-yl)-1/1,3,3-tetramethyluronium]hexafluorophosphate advantageously in the<br><br>
presence of a catalyst such as a N-hydroxy compound e.g. a N-hydroxytriazole such as 1-hydroxybenzotriazole. Alternatively the acid may he reacted with a chloroformate, for example ethylchloroformate, prior to the desired acylation reaction<br>
In a further example compounds may be obtained by sulphonylation of a compound containing an -OH group by reaction with one of the above alkylating agents but in which Z2 is replaced by a -S(O)Hal or -SO2Hal group I'in which Hal is a halogen atom such as chlorine atom] in the presence of a base, for example an inorganic base such as sodium hydride in a solvent such as an amide, e.g. a substituted amide such as dimethylformamide at for example ambient temperature.<br>
In another example, compounds containing a -L2H group as defined above may be coupled with one of the alkylation agents just described but in which Z? is replaced by an -OH group in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran in the presence of a phosphine, e.g. triphenylphosphine and an activator such as diethyl, diisopropyl- or dimethylazodicarboxylate. .<br>
Ester groups such as -CO2Alk6 and -COaR4 in the compound of formula (1) and intermediates thereto may be converted to the corresponding acid [-CO?H] by acid- or base-catalysed hydrolysis depending on the nature of the qroup Alkb or R4. Acid- or base-catalysed hydrolysis may be achieved for example by treatment with an organic or inorganic acid, e.g. trifluoroacetic acid in an organic solvent e.g. dichloromethane or a mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid in a solvent such as dioxan or an alkali metal hydroxide, e.g. lithium hydroxide in an aqueous alcohol, e.g. aqueous methanol.<br>
In a further example, -OR6 [where R6 represents an alkyl group such as methyl group] in compounds of formula (1) and intermediates thereto may be<br><br>
cleaved to the corresponding alcohol -OH by reaction with boron tribromide in a solvent such as a halogenated hydrocarbon, e.g. dichloromethane at a low temperature, e.g. around -78Â°C.<br>
Alcohol [-OH] groups may also be obtained by hydrogenation of a corresponding -OCH2R31 group (where R31 is an aryl group) using a metal catalyst, for example palladium on a support such as carbon in a solvent such as ethanol in the presence of ammonium formate, cyclohexadiene or hydrogen, from around ambient to the reflux temperature. In another example, -OH groups may be generated from the corresponding ester [e.g. -cOf.Alk6] or aldehyde [-CHO] by reduction, using for example a complex metal hydride such as lithium aluminium hydride or sodium borohydride in a solvent such as methanol.<br>
In another example, alcohol -OH groups in the compounds may be converted to a corresponding -OR6 group by coupling with a reagent R6OH in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran in the presence of a phosphine, e.g. triphenylphosphine and an activator such as diethyl-, diisopropyl-, or dimethylazodicarboxylate.<br>
Aminosulphonylamino [-NHSO2NH2] groups in the compounds may be obtained, in another example, by reaction of a corresponding amine [-NH2] with sulphamide in the presence of an organic base such as pyridine at an elevated temperature, e.g. the reflux temperature.<br>
In another example compounds containing a -NHCSR7 or -CSNHR7 group may he prepared by treating a corresponding compound containing a -NHCOR7 or -CONHR7 group with a thiation reagent, such as Lawesson's Reagent or P2S5, in an anhydrous solvent, for example a cyclic ether such as tetrahydrofuran, at an elevated temperature such as the reflux temperature.<br><br>
In a further example amine (-NH2) groups may be alkylated using a reductive alkylation process employing an aldehyde and a reducing agent. Suitable reducing agents include borohydrides for example sodium triacetoxyborohyride or sodium cyanoborohydride. The reduction may be carried out in a solvent such as a halogenated hydrocarbon, e.g. dichloromethane, a ketone such as acetone, or an alcohol, e.g. ethanol, where necessary in the presence of an acid such as acetic acid at around ambient temperature. Alternatively, the amine and aldehyde may be initially reacted in a solvent such as an aromatic hydrocarbon e.g. toluene and then subjected to hydrogenation in the presence of a metal catalyst, for example palladium on a support such as carbon, in a solvent such as an alcohol, e.g. ethanol.<br>
In a further example, amine [-NH2] groups in compounds of formula (1) and intermediates thereto may be obtained by hydrolysis from a corresponding imide by reaction with hydrazine in a solvent such as an alcohol, e.g. ethanol at ambient temperature.<br>
In another example, a nitro [-NO2] group may be reduced to an amine [-NH2], for example by catalytic hydrogenation using for example hydrogen in the presence of a metal catalyst, for example palladium on a support such as carbon in a solvent such as an ether, e.g. tetrahydrofuran or an alcohol e.g. methanol, or by chemical reduction using for example a metal, e.g. tin or iron, in the presence of an acid such as hydrochloric acid.<br>
In a further example amine (-CH2NH2) groups in compounds of formula (1) and intermediates thereto may be obtained by reduction of nitriles (-CN), for example by catalytic hydrogenation using for example hydrogen in the presence of a rnetal catalyst, for example palladium on a support such as<br><br>
carbon, or RaneyÂ® nickel, in a solvent such as an ether e.g. a cyclic ether such as tetrahydrofuran or an alcohol e.g. methanol or ethanol, optionally in ihe presence of ammonia solution at a temperature from ambient to the reflux temperature, or by chemical reduction using for example a metal hydride e.g. lithium aluminium hydride, in a solvent such as an ether e.g. a cyclic ether such as tetrahydrofuran, at a temperature from 0Â°C to the reflux temperature.<br>
In another example, sulphur atoms in the compounds, for example when present in a group L1 or L2 may be oxidised to the corresponding sulphoxide or sulphone using an oxidising agent such as a peroxy acid, e.g. 3-chloroperoxybenzoic acid, in an inert solvent such as a halogenated hydrocarbon, e.g. dichloromethane, at around ambient temperature.<br>
fri a further example N-oxides of compounds of formula (1) may in general be prepared for example by oxidation of the corresponding nitrogen base using an oxidising agent such as hydrogen peroxide in the presence of an acid such as acetic acid, at an elevated temperature, for example around 70QC to BOQC, or alternatively by reaction with a peracid such as peracetic acid or m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid in a solvent.such as a halogenated hydrocarbon e.g. dichloromethane or an alcohol e.g. tert-butanol at a temperature from the ambient temperature to the reflux temperature.<br>
In another example compounds of formula (12) may be converted to further compounds as formula (13) in which Ar is an optionally substituted aromatic or heteroaromatic group for use in the synthesis of for example compounds of formula (1), using such well know and commonly used palladium mediated reaction conditions as are to be found in the general reference texts Rodd's Chemistry of Carbon Compounds, Volumes 1-15 and Supplemental (Elsevier Science Publishers, 1989), Fieser and Fieser's Reagents for Organic Synthesis, Volumes 1-19 (John Wiley and Sons, 1999),<br><br>

enantiomers.<br>
hus for example diastereomeric derivatives, e.g. salts, may be produced by reaction of a mixture of enantiomers of formula (1a) or (1b) e.g. a racemate, and an appropriate chiral compound, e.g. a chiral base. The diastereomers may then be separated by any convenient means, for example by crystallisation and the desired enantiomer recovered, e.g. by treatment with an acid in the instance where the diastereomer is a salt.<br>
In another resolution process a racemate of formula (1a) or (1b) may be separated using chiral High Performance Liquid Chromatography. Alternatively, if desired a particular enantiomer may be obtained by using an appropriate chiral intermediate in one of the processes described above.<br><br>

To a freshly prepared solution of lithium diisopropylamide (22mmol) in dry THF (20ml_) under nitrogen and cooled to -78Â° was added a solution of 2-fluoropyridine (1.94g, 20mmol) in dry THF (10mL). The reaction was stirred for 2.5h at -78Â° before adding a solution of N-methoxy-N-methyl benzamide (3.47g, 21mmol) in THF (8mL). The reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature over 1.5h and stir at room temperature for 1h. The reaction was quenched with water (50mL), extracted with EtOAc (2x50mL), the extracts dried (MgSCU) and concentrated in vacua. The crude product was purified by chromatography on silica (5-20% EtOAc in isohexane) to give the title compound as a colourless oil (1.05g, 26%). 5H (CDCI3) 8.44 (1H, ddd, J 4.9, 2.0, 1.1 Hz), 8.06 (1H, ddd, J 9.3, 7.4, 2.0Hz), 7.84 (2H, dm, J 8.4Hz), 7.66 (1H, tt, J 7.4, 1.3 Hz), 7.52 (2H, tm, J 7.8Hz), 7.38 (1H, ddd, J 6.8, 4.9, 1.9Hz).

After hydrogen evolution had ceased the cooling bath was removed and the reaction stirred at room temperature for 30 mins. A solution of Intermediate 1 (920mg, 4.6mmol) in DMF (5mL) was added and the reaction stirred at room temperature for 3h. The reaction was quenched with water (50ml_) and extracted with EtOAc (3x50mL). The combined EtOAc layers were washed with brine (50mL), dried (MgSO4) and concentrated in vacuo to give a mixture of the title compound and uncyclised ethyl 2-(3-benzoylpyridin-2-ylsulfanyl)acetate. This crude mixture was dissolved in EtOH (10mL) and sodium ethoxide (10ml_ of 0.5M solution in EtOH, 5.0mmol) added.

The following assays and animal models can be used to demonstrate the potency and selectivity of the compounds according to the invention. In each assay an IC50 value was determined for each test compound and represents the concentration of compound necessary to achieve 50% inhibition.<br>
Preparation of activated human p38q for inhibitor assays. Purification of human p38a<br>
Human p38a, incorporating an N-terminal (His)6 tag, was expressed in baculovirus-infected High-Fiveâ„¢ cells (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturers instructions. The cells were harvested 72h post-infection and lysed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 1% (w/v) (3-octyiglucoside and Complete, EDTA-freeâ„¢ protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The lysate was centrifuged at 35000xg for SOmin at 4oC and the supernatant applied to a NiNTAâ„¢ column (Qiagen). Bound protein was eluted by 150mM irnidazole in PBS (after a wash with 15mM imidazole in PBS) and directly applied to a HiTrap Qâ„¢ column (AP Biotech). Bound protein was eluted using a 20 column volume, 0 to 1M NaCI gradient. Fractions containing (His)6-p38 were aliquotted and stored at -70s prior to their activation.<br>
Preparation of GST-MKK6EE-containina Ivsates<br>
E. coli (BL21 pLysS) expressing the constituitively activated form of human MKK6 fused with an N-terminal glutathione^-S-transferase tag (GST-MKK6EE) were harvested by centrifugation and frozen at -709. Cells were lysed by resuspension in 1/1 Oth the culture volume of PBS containing Complete, EDTA-freeâ„¢ protease inhibitors followed by sonication on ice for 4x15 sec. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 35,000xg and the resultant supernatant stored in aliquots at -70s.<br>
Activation of (His)6-p38<br>
0.45mL of purified (His)6-p38 was incubated with 50uL of the GST-MKK6EE-containing lysate for SOmin at 23B in the presence of 1mM (3-glycerophosphate, 10mM MgCI2 and 9mM ATP. The extent of activation was monitored by mass spectrometric detection of the doubly-phosphorylated form of (His)6-p38, which routinely comprised greater than 90% of the final (His)6-p38 preparation. The activated (His)6-p38 was then diluted x10 in PBS and repurified using the method described above. The concentration of<br><br>
purified, activated (His)6-p38 was measured by UV absorbance at 280nm using A280,0.1%=1.2 and the preparation stored in aliquots at -70e prior to its use in inhibitor assays.<br>
p38 Inhibition Assays<br>
Inhibition of phosphorvlation of biotinvlated mvelin basic protein (MBP)<br>
The inhibition of p38 catalysed phosphorylation of biotinylated MBP is measured using a DELFIA based format. The assay was performed in a buffer comprising, 20mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 5mM MgCI2 and 3mM DTT. For a typical IC50 determination, biotinylated MBP (2.5u.M) was incubated at room temperature in a streptavidin-coated microtitre plate together with activated gst-p38 (10nM) and ATP (1(iM) in the presence of a range of inhibitor concentrations (final concentration of DMSO is 2 percent). After fifteen minutes the reaction was terminated by the addition of EDTA (75mM). The microtitre plate was then washed with Tris buffered saline (TBS), prior to the addition of 100uJ of anti-phospho MBP antibody (mouse) together with europium-labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody. After one hour at room temperature the plate was again washed in TBS followed by the addition of Enhancement solution (PerkinElmer Wallac). Fluorescence measurements were performed after a further fifteen minutes at room temperature. IC50 values are determined from the plot of Logâ„¢ inhibitor concentration (x-axis) versus percentage inhibition of the fluorescence generated by a control sample in the absence of inhibitor (y-axis).<br>
Purification of human Peripheral Bood Mononuclear Cells<br>
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from normal healthy volunteers. Whole blood was taken by venous puncture using heparinised vacutainers (Becton Dickinson), diluted 1 in 4 in RPMI 1640 (Gibco. UK) and centrifuged at 400g for 35 min over a Ficoll-paque gradient<br><br>
(Amersham-Pharmacia Biotech, UK). Cells at the interface were removed and washed once followed by a low speed spin (250g) to remove platelets. Cells were then resuspended in DMEM containing 10% PCS, penicillin 100 units ml"1, streptomycin SOjig ml"1 and glutamine 2mM (Gibco, UK).<br>
Inhibitor dilutions<br>
Inhibitor stocks (20mM) were kept as a frozen solution (-20Â°C) in DMSO. Serial dilutions of inhibitors were performed in DMSO as 250-times concentrated stocks. Inhibitors were diluted 1 in 250 into tissue culture media, prewarmed to 37Â°C and transferred to plates containing PBMC. PBMC and inhibitors were incubated together for 30 mins prior to addition of LPS. Inhibitors used in whole blood assays were prepared according to a different regime. Using the same stock solution serial dilutions of inhibitors were performed in DMSO. Inhibitors were then diluted 1 in 500 straight into whole blood in a volume of 1)j,L. Inhibitor was incubated with whole blood for 30 mins prior to the addition of LPS.<br>
LPS stimulation of PBMC<br>
PBMC were resuspended at a density of 2x105 cells/well in flat bottomed 96 well tissue culture treated plates. After the addition of inhibitor cells were stimulated with an optimal dose of LPS (Eco//strain B5:055, Sigma, at a final concentration of 1^g ml"1) and incubated at 37Â°C in 5%CO2/95% air for 18 hours. TNF-cc levels were measured from cell free supernatants by sandwich ELISA (BioSource #CHC1751).<br>
LPS stimulation of whole blood<br>
Whole blood was taken by venous puncture using heparinised vacutainers (Becton Dickinson), and 500^,1 of blood aliquoted into each well of a 24 well tissue culture treated plate. After the addition of inhibitor cells were<br><br>
stimulated with an optimal dose of LPS (Econstrain 65:055, Sigma, at a final concentration of 1|Lig ml"1) and incubated at 37Â°C without CO2for 18 hours. TNF-a levels were measured from cell free supernatants by sandwich ELISA (BioSource#CHC1751).<br>
Rat LPS induced TNF release<br>
Male Lewis rats (180-200g) are anaesthetised with Isofluor and injected i.v. with LPS* in a volume of 0.5ml sterile saline. After 90minutes blood is collected into EDTA tubes for preparation of plasma samples. Plasma is stored at -70Â°C prior to assay for TNFcx by commercial ELISA.<br>
Rat CIA<br>
Female Lewis rats (180-200g) are anaesthetised with Isofluor and immunised i.cl. at the base of the tail with 2x100|u,l of emulsion containing 4mg/ml bovine collagen II in 0.01M acetic acid and Freund's Incomplete Adjuvant at a ratio<br>
i &gt;t 1:1,<br>
A polyarthritis develops with onset from about 13 days post sensitisation. The   disease  is  mainly  confined  to  the  ankles  and  is  quantified  by plethysmometry. Results are expressed as change in paw volume over time.<br>
In the p38 inhibitor assay compounds of the invention have IC5o values of around SOp-M and below. The more active compounds have IC50 values of around 500nM and below. The compounds of the invention are clearly potent inhibitors of p38 kinase, especially p38a kinase.<br><br><br>
