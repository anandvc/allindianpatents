				<td>The present invention relates to a pyridinylpyrazole compound.<br>
This non-provisional application claims benefit of priority of U.S. provisional application 60/408,811, filed September 6, 2002.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
TGFß (Transforming Growth Factor ß) is a member of a large family of dimeric polypeptide growth factors that includes activins, inhibins, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), growth and differentiation factors (GDFs) and mullerian inhibiting substance (MIS).   TGFß exists in three isoforms (TGFßl, TGFß2, and TGFß3) and is present in most cells, along with its receptors. Each isoform is expressed in both a tissue-specific and developmentally regulated fashion. Each TGFß isoform is synthesized as a precursor protein that is cleaved intracellularly into a C-terminal region (latency associated peptide (LAP)) and an N-terminal region known as mature or active TGFß. LAP is typically non-covalently associated with mature TGFß prior to secretion from the cell. The LAP- TGFß complex cannot bind to the TGFß receptors and is not biologically active. TGFß is generally released (and activated) from the complex by a variety of mechanisms including interaction with thrombospondin-1 or plasmin.<br>
Following activation, TGFß binds at high affinity to the type II receptor (TGFßRII), a. constitutively active serine/threonine kinase. The ligand-bound type II receptor phosphorylates the TGFß type I receptor (Alk 5) in a glycine/serine rich domain, which allows the type I receptor to recruit and phosphorylate downstream signaling molecules, Smad2 or Smad3. See, e.g., Huse, M. et al., Mol. Cell. 8: 671-682 (2001). Phosphorylated Smad2 or Smad3 can then complex with Smad4, and the entire hetero-Smad complex translocates to the nucleus and regulates transcription of various TGFß-responsive genes.   See, e.g., Massague, J. Arm. Rev .Biochem. Med. 67: 773 (1998).<br>
Activins are also members of the TGFß superfamily which are distinct from TGFß in that they are homo- or heterodimers of activin ßa or ßb. Activins signal in a<br><br><br>
similar manner to TGFfJ, that is, by binding to a constitutive serine-threonine receptor kinase, acttvin type II receptor (ActRIIB), and activating a type I serine=-threonine receptor, Allc 4, to phosphorylate Smad2 or Smad3. The consequent formation of a hetero-Smad complex with Smad4 also results in the activin-induced regulation of gene transcription.<br>
Indeed, TGFp and related factors such as activin regulate a large array of cellular processes, e.g., cell cycle arrest in epithelial and hematopoietic cells., control of mesenchymal cell proliferation and differentiation, inflammatory cell recruitment, immunosuppression, wound healing, and extracellular matrix production.  See, e.g., Massague, J. Ann. Rev .Cell. Biol, 6; 594-641 (1990); Roberts, A. B. and Sporn M. B. Peptide Growth Factors and Their Receptors, 95: 419-472 Berlin: Springer-Verlag (1990); Roberts, A. B. and Sporn M. B. Growth Factors 8:1-9 (1993); and Alexandrow, M. G., Moses, H. L. Cancer Res. 55: 1452-1457 (1995). Hyperactivity of TGFp signaling pathway underlies many human disorders (e.g., excess deposition of extracellular matrix, an abnormally high level of inflammatory responses, fibrotic disorders, and progressive cancers). Similarly, activin signaling and overexpression of activin is linked to pathological disorders that involve extracellular matrix accumulation and librosis (see, e.g., Matsuse, T. et at., Am. J. Respir. C&amp;llMol. Biol. 13: 17-24 (1995); Inoue, S. et al, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 205: 441-448 (1994); Matsuse, T. et al, Am../. Patliol. 148: 707-713 (1996); D.e Bleser et at., Hepatology 26: 905-912 (1997); Pawlowski, I.E., et al., J. dm. Invest. 100: 639-648 (1997), Sugiyama, M, et al., Gasfroenterology 114: 550-558 (1998); Munz, B. et al., EkfBOJ. 18: 5205-5215 (1999)) and inflammatory responses (see, e.g., Rosendahl, A. et al., Am. J. Repir. CellMol. Biol. 25: 60-68 (2001)). Studies have shown that TGFp and activin can act synergistically to induce extracellular matrix (see, e.g., Sugiyama, M. et al., Gastroenterology 114: 550-558, (1998)). It is therefore desirable to develop modulators (e.g., antagonists) to signaling pathway components of the TGF(3 family to prevent/treat disorders related to the malfunctioning of this signaling pathway.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Compounds of formula (I) are unexpectedly potent antagonists of the TGFp family type I receptors, Alk5 and/or Alk 4. Thus, compounds of formula (I) can be employed in the prevention and/or treatment of diseases such as fibrosis (e.g., renal fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis, and hepatic fibrosis), progressive cancers, or other diseases for which reduction of TGFp family signaling activity is desirable.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In general, the invention features compounds of formula (I), which exhibit surprisingly high affinity for the TGFp family type I receptors, AJk 5 and/or AJk 4.<br><br>
Synthesis of Compounds of formulalll<br>
Compounds of formula (I) may be prepared by a number of known methods from commercially available or known starting materials. In one method, compounds of formula (I) are prepared according to Scheme 1 below.  Specifically, a compound of formula (II) (where Xi, Xj, Xa, and X^ have each been defined before) can undergo dipolar cycloadditiorrwith an acetylene of formula (III) in an inert solvent (e.g., CHiClj) with an appropriate base (e.g., KOH) to form an intermediate, a compound of formula (IV) as shown below.  This intermediate can then react with an amine of formula (V) where RA is a lower alkyl (e.g., d-4 alkyl such as methyl) and RB is an appropriate leaving group (e.g., Ci-4 alkoxy such as ethoxy) to form a further intermediate, a compound of formula (VI). Further reaction of this intermediate with reagents such as an optionally substituted guanidine (wherein R shown below in Scheme 1 can be hydrogen, alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, heterocycloalkyl., or heteroaryl) or thiourea leads to compounds of formula (I).<br>
Alternatively, the intermediate compound of formula (IV) can be alkylated by reacting with diethoxy ketone in a polar solvent (e.g., dioxane) at an elevated temperature (e.g., 90°C) to result in a further intermediate, a compound of formula (VII). This intermediate can then react with a reagent such as guanidine carbonate at an elevated temperature (e.g., IOO°C) to form a compound of formula (I) with an aminopyrimidinone substituent. This compound of formula (I) can be further derivatized to other compounds of formula (I) (e.g., by converting the aminopyrimidinone substituent to a diaminopyrimidine substituent as shown in Scheme 1).<br>

(Figure Removed)Some other methods for derivatizing compounds of formula (I) are shown in Scheme 2 below.<br><br>
(Figure Removed)Scheme 3 shows a yet another method for preparing compounds of formula (I).  Specifically, a compound of formula (II) can cyclize with an acetylene of formula (YRI) to form an intermediate compound of formula (IX). Reaction of this intermediate with NaOH, followed by a brominating agent (N-bromosuccinimide) yields a compound of formula (X). Further reaction of a compound of formula (X) with either reagent of formula (XI) or formula (XII) produces compounds of formula (I). For references, see Stille, Ahgew. Chem. In. Ed. Engl. 25, 508 (1996) and Suzuki et al., Synth. Comrmm. 11, 513 (1981).<br>
Scheme 3<br><br>
(Figure Removed)cetylenes of formula (111) and formula (VTl'I), starting compound of the synthetic procedures illustrated in Schemes 1 and 3, respectively, can be prepared according to Scheme 4 below.  Specifically, 2-halopyridine (XIII) can first react with trimethylsilylacetylene to form a trimethylsilanylethynyl substituted pyridine (XIV), which is then deprotected with a base (e.g., NaOH, K^COs, or tetrabutylammonium fluoride.) to yield 2-ethynylpyridine of formula (XV). Further reaction of this compound with acetic anhydride and methyl chloroformate produces a compound of formula (111) and formula (VIII), respectively.<br><br>
Still further, compounds of formula (I) can be prepared according to Scheme 5 below. Specifically, a diary 1 acetylene of formula (5CVI) or a ketone of formula (XVII) can cyclize with an aminating agent (e.g., O-(mesitylsulfonyl)-hydroxylamine) to yield a compound of formula (XVIII), which can be brominated (e.g., by using N-bromosuccmimide) to form a compound of formula (X). Further reaction of a compound of formula (X) with either reagent of formula (XI) or formula (XII) produces compounds of formula (I).<br><br><br>
Starting compounds of formula (XVI1) can be prepared according to methods analogous to that illustrated in Scheme 4 above, e.g., by coupling an appropriate pyridyl acetylene with 2-halopyridine. For reference, see Yamanake et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1890 (1988), Compounds of formula (XVII) can also be prepared according to known methods, e.g., see Cassity et al., J. Org. Chem. 2286 (1978).<br>
In addition to Scheme 2, a compound of formula (I) can be modified to other compounds of formula (I) according to Schemes 6 and 7 below. Note that R° represents alkyl, cycloalkyl, (cycloalkyl)alkyl, aryl, aralkyl, heterocycloalkyl, (heterocycloalkyl)alkyl, heteroaryl, or heteroaralkyl.<br>

As will be obvious to a skilled person in the art, some intermediates may need to be protected before undergoing synthetic steps as described above. For suitable protecting groups, see, e.g., T. W. Greene, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York (1981).<br>
Uses of Compounds of formula (I)<br>
As discussed above, hyperactivity of the TGFp family signaling pathways can result in excess deposition of extracellular matrix and increased inflammatory responses, which can then lead to fibrosis in tissues and organs (e.g., lung, kidney, and liver) and ultimately result in organ failure.  See, e.g., Border, VV.A. and Ruoslahti E../ Clin. Invest. 90: 1-7 (1992) and Border, W.A. and Noble, N.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 331: 1286-1292 (1994).  Studies have been shown that the expression of TGFp and/or activin niRNA. and the level of TGFp and/or activin are increased in patients suffering from various fibrotic disorders, e.g., fibrotic kidney diseases, alcohol-induced and autoimmune hepatic fibrosis, myelofibrosis, bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.<br>
Compounds of formula (I), which are antagonists of the TGFP family type I receptors, Alk 5 and/or Alk 4, and inhibit TGFP and/or activin signaling pathway, are therefore useful for treating and/or preventing fibrotic disorders or diseases mediated by an increased level of TGFJ3 and/or activin activity. As used herein, a compound inhibits the TGFp family signaling pathway when it binds (e.g., with an ICjo value of less than 10 uM; preferably, less than 1 uM; more preferably, less than 0.1 u.M) to a receptor of the pathway (e.g., Alk 5 and/or Alk 4), thereby competing with the endogenous ligand(s) or substrate(s) for binding site(s) on the receptor and reducing the ability of the receptor to transduce an intracellular signal in response to the endogenous ligand or substrate binding. The aforementioned disorders or diseases include any conditions (a) marked by the presence of an abnormally high level of TGFp and/or activin, and/or (b) an excess accumulation of extracellular matrix; and/or (c) an increased number and synthetic activity of myofibroblasts. These disorders or diseases include, but are not limited to, fibrotic conditions such as scleroderma, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, glomerulonephritis, diabetic nephropathy, lupus nephritis, hypertension-induced nephropathy, ocular or corneal scarring, hepatic or biliary fibrosis, acute lung injury, pulmonary fibrosis, post-infarction cardiac fibrosis, fibrosclerosis, fibrotic cancers, fibroids, fibroma, fibroadenomas, and fibrosarcomas.  Other fibrotic conditions for which preventive treatment with compounds of formula (I) can have therapeutic utility include radiation therapy-<br>
induced fibrosis, chemotherapy-induced fibrosis, surgically induced scarring including surgical adhesions, laminectoray, and coronary restenosis.<br>
increased TGFp activity is also found to manifest in patients with progressive cancers. Studies have shown that in late stages of various cancers, both the tumor cells and the stromal cells within the tumors generally overexpress TGF(3.  This leads to stimulation of angiogenesis and cell motility, suppression of the immune system, , and increased interaction of tumor cells with the extracellular matrix.  See, e.g., Hojo, M. et al,, Nature 397: 530-534 (1999). As a result, the tumors cells become more invasive and metastasize to distant organs.  See, e.g., Maehara, Y. et al.; J. Clin. Oncol. 17: 607-614 (1999) and Picon., A. et al., Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev. 7: 497-504 (1998), Thus, compounds of formula (I), which are antagonists of the TGFji type I receptor and inhibit TGFJ3 signaling pathway, are also useful for treating and/or preventing various late stage cancers which overexpress TGF(3.  Such late stage cancers include carcinomas of the lung, breast, liver; biliary tract, gastrointestinal tract, head and neck, pancreas, prostate, cervix as well as multiple myeloma, melanoma, gliorna, and glioblastomas.<br>
Importantly, it should be pointed out that because of the chronic and in some cases localized nature of disorders or diseases mediated by overexpression of TGFp and/or activin (e.g., fibrosis or cancers), small molecule treatments (such as treatment disclosed in the present invention) are favored for long-term treatment.<br>
Not only are compounds of formula (I) useful in treating disorders or diseases mediated by high levels of TGFJ3 and/or activin activity, these compounds can also be used to prevent the same disorders or diseases. It is known that polymorphisms leading to increased TGF|3 and/or activin production have been associated with fibrosis and hypertension. Indeed, high serum TGFfi levels are correlated with the development of fibrosis in patients with breast cancer who have received radiation therapy, chronic graft-versus-host-disease, idiopathic interstitial pneumonitis, veno-occlusive disease in transplant recipients, and peritoneal fibrosis in patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Thus, the levels of TGFJ3 and/or activin in serum and of TGFjJ and/or activin mRNA in tissue can be measured and used as diagnostic or prognostic markers for disorders or diseases mediated by<br>
rexpression of TGFP and/or activin, and polymorphisms in the gene for TGF|3 that determine the production of TGFP and/or activin can also be used in predicting susceptibility to disorders or diseases.

Administration of Compounds of formula (I)<br>
As defined above, an effective amount is the amount which is required to confer a therapeutic effect on the treated patient. For a compound of formula (I), an effective amount can range from about 1 mg/kg to about 150 mg/kg (e.g., from about 1 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg). Effective doses will also vary, as recognized by those skilled in the art, dependant on route of administration, excipient usage, and the possibility of co-usage with other therapeutic treatments including use of other therapeutic agents and/or radiation therapy.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) can be administered in any manner suitable for the administration of pharmaceutical compounds, including, but not limited to, pills, tablets, capsules, aerosols, suppositories, liquid formulations for ingestion or injection or for use as eye or ear drops, dietary supplements, and topical preparations. The pharmaceutically acceptable compositions include aqueous solutions of the active agent, in a isotonic saline, 5% glucose or other well-known pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. Solubilizing agents such as cyclodextrins, or other solubilizing agents well-known to those familiar with the art, can be utilized as pharmaceutical excipients for delivery of the therapeutic compounds. As to route of administration, the compositions can be administered orally, intranasally, transdermally, intradermally, vaginally, intraaurally, intraocularly, buccally, rectally, transmucosally, or via inhalation, implantation (e.g., surgically), or intravenous administration.  The compositions can be administered to an animal (e.g., a mammal such as a human,<br><br>
non-human primate, horse, dog, cow, pig, sheep, goat, cat, mouse, rat, guinea pig, rabbit, hamster, gerbil, ferret, lizard, reptile, or bird).<br>
Optionally, compounds of formula (I) can be administered in conjunction with one or more other agents that inhibit the TGFp signaling pathway or treat the coiTesponding pathological disorders (e.g., fibrosis or progressive cancers) by way of a different mechanism of action. Examples of these agents include arigiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, nonsteroid, steroid anti-inflammatory agents, and chemotherapeutics or radiation, as well as agents that antagonize ligand binding or activation of the TGFJ3 receptors, e.g., anti-TGFp, anti-TGFp receptor antibodies, or antagonists of the TGFp type II receptors.<br>

The TGFp or activin inhibitory activity of compounds of formula (I) can be assessed by methods described in the following examples'.<br>
Example 2<br>
Cell-Free Assay for Evaluating Inhibition of<br>
Autophosphorylation of TGFp Type 1 Receptor<br>
The serine-threonine kinase activity of TGFp type I receptor was measured as the aulophovsphorylation activity of the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor containing an N-termina! poly histidine, TEV cleavage site-tag, e.g., His-TGFpRI. The His-tagged receptor cytoplasmic kinase domains were purified from infected insect cell cultures using the Gibco-BRL FastBac HTb baculoviais expression system.<br>
To a 96-well Nickel FlashPlate (NEN Life Science, Perkin Elmer) was added 20 ul of 1.25 u€i 33P-ATP/25 joM ATP in assay buffer (50 mM Hepes, 60 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT, 5 mM MnCl2, 2% glycerol, and 0.015%Brij 35).  10 ul of test compounds of formula (I) prepared in 5% DMSO solution were added to the FlashPlate. The assay was then initated with the addition of 20 ul of assay buffer containing 12.5 pmol of His-TGFpRI to each well. Plates were incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature and the reactions were then terminated by a single rinse with TBS. Radiation from each well of the plates was read on a TopCount (Packard).<br><br>
Total binding (no inhibition) was defined as counts measured in the presence of DMSO solution containing with no test compound and non-specific binding was defined as counts measured in the presence of EDTA or no-kinase control.<br>
Alternatively, the reaction performed using the above reagents and incubation conditions but in a microcentrifuge tube was analyzed by separation on a 4-20% SDS-PAGE gel and the incorporation of radiolabel into the 40 kDa His-tGFpRI SDS-PAGE band was quantitated on a Storm Phosphoimager (Molecular Dynamics).<br>
Compounds of formula (I) typically exhibited ICso values of less than 10 uM; some exhibited ICso values of less than 0.1 uJVI.<br>

Inhibition of the Activin type I receptor (Alk 4) kinase autophosphorylation activity by test compounds of formula (I) can be determined in a similar manner as described above in Example 2 except that a similarly His-tagged form of Alk 4 (His-Alk 4) was used in place of the His-TGFpRI.<br>
Example 4<br>
Assay for Evaluating Cellular Inhibition of TGFp Signaling and Cytotoxkity<br>
Biological activity of compounds of formula (I) were determined by measuring their ability to inhibit TGF{3-induced PAI-Luciferase reporter activity in HepG2 cells.<br>
HepG2 cells were stably transfected with thePAI-luciferase reporter grown in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS, penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100 ug/ml), L-glutamine (2 mM), sodium pyruvate (1 mM), and non essential amino acids (Ix). The transfected cells were then plated at a concentration of 2.5 x 104 cells/welt in 96 well plates and starved for 3-6 hours in media with 0.5% FBS at 37°C in a 5% CC&gt;2 incubator. The cells were then stimulated with ligand either 2.5 ng/ml TGFJ3 in the starvation media containing 1% DMSO and the presence or absence of test compounds of of formula (I) and incubated as described above for 24 hours. The<br><br>
media was washed out in the following day and the luciferase reporter activity was detected using the LucLite Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay kit (Packard, cat. no. 601691 1) as recommended. The plates were read on a Wallac Microbeta plate reader, the reading of which was used to determine the ICjo values of compounds of formula (I) for inhibiting TGFp-induced PAI-Luciferase reporter activity in HepG2 cells. Compounds of formula (I) typically exhibited ICso values of less 10 uM.<br>
Cytotoxicity was determined using the same cell culture conditions as described above. Specifically, cell viability was determined after overnight incubation with the CytoLite cell viability kit (Packard, cat. no. 6016901). Compounds of formula (1) typically exhibited LD25 values greater than 10<br>
Example 5<br>
Assay for Evaluating Cellular Inhibition of TGFp Signaling<br>
The cellular inhibition of activin signaling activity by test compounds of formula (I) were determined in a similar manner as described above in Example 4 except that lOOng/ml of activin is added to serum starved cells in place of the 2.5ng/mlTGFp.<br>
Example 6<br>
Assay for TGFp-induced Collagen Expression<br>
Preparation of Immortalized Collagen Promolor-Green Fluorescent Protein Cells Fibroblasts were derived from the skin of adult transgenic mice expressing Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) under the control of the collagen 1 Al promoter (see Krempen, K. et al., Gene Exp. 8: 151-163 (1999)). Cells were immortalised with a temperature sensitive large T antigen that is active at 33°C. Cells are expanded at 33°C then transferred to 37°C so that the large T becomes inactive (see Xu, S. et al., Exp. Cell Res. 220: 407-414 (1995)).  Over the course of about 4 days and one split, the cells cease proliferating.  Cells are then frozen in aliquots sufficient for a single 96 well plate. Assay ofTGFfi-indi/ced Collageu-GFP Expression<br><br>
Cells are thawed, plated in complete DMEM (contains nonessential amino acids, ImM sodium pyruvate and 2mM L-glutamine) with 10 % fetal calf serum and incubated overnight at 37°C, 5% COx The following day, the cells are trypsinized and transferred into 96 well format with 30,000 cells per well in 50 u.1 complete DMEM containing 2 % fetal calf serum, but without phenol red. The cells are incubated at 37°C for 3 to 4 hours to allow them to adhere to the plate, solutions containing test compounds of formula (I) are then added to triplicate wells with no TGF|3, as well as triplicate wells with 1 ng/ml TGFp. DMSO was also added to all of the wells at a final concentration of 0.1%. GFP fluorescence emission at 530 nm following excitation at 485 nm was measured at 48 hours after the addition of solution containing test compounds on a CytoFluor microplate reader (PerSeptive Biosystems). The data are then expressed as the ratio of TGFp-induced to non-induced for each test sample.<br>
