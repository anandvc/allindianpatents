A. Carenzi et al. in Arzneimittel-Forschung(1989), 39(6), 642-646, discloses isoxazole derivatives that are useful as antihypertensives. The compounds described in that publication are not part of the invention, in particular the compound for which the CAS number is: [124953-56-6], which corresponds to<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
A is N or C;<br>
11 and L-G-R1 is chosen frorr    are preferred.<br>
Products for which:<br>
E is NR4 with R4 is H are preferred.<br>
A preferred R1 substituent can be chosen from phenyl, phenyl substituted by at least one radical chosen from halogen, CF3) CN, N02, (Ci-C3)alkyl, O-R10, S-R10, N(R10)(R11), CO-O-R10, CO-N(R10)(R11), NH-CO-R10 in which R10 and R11 are chosen independently from H, (d-C3)alkyl, halogenated (Ci-C3)alkyl, (Ci-C3)alkyl-OHf (CrC3)alkyl-NH2, (Ci-C3)alkyl-COOH, (CrC3)alkyl-OCH3, (Ci-C3)alkyl-NHCH3) pyridyl, pyridyl substituted by at least one radical chosen from halogen, (Ci-C3)alkyl, 0-R12, S-R12 or N(R12)(R13) in which R12 and R13 are chosen independently from H or (d-C3)alkyl.<br>
More preferably, R1 will be phenyl substituted in the 3-position by halogen or (d-C3)alkyl, (d-C3)alkoxy, (CrC3)alkylamino, CONH2, CO-NH-(CH2)2-OH or NH-CO-CH3; or 3-pyridyl; 2- or 3-pyridyl substituted by halogen, (d-C3)alkyl or(Ci-C3)alkoxy.<br>
When R1 is substituted phenyl, preferred substitution combinations can be<br>
chosen from 2,3-disubstituted phenyl, 2,5-disubstituted phenyl, 3-substituted<br>
phenyl, 3,5-disubstituted phenyl and 3,4-disubstituted phenyl, more preferably<br>
from  3-substituted  phenyl,  3,5-disubstituted  phenyl  and  3,4-disubstituted<br>
phenyl.<br>
When  R1   is  2-pyridyl,  preferred  substitutions  are  chosen  from  4-  or<br>
6-substituted 2-pyridyl or4,6-disubstituted 2-pyridyl.<br>

The aryi(heteroaryl)ation reaction of piperazines, generally of Hartwig-Buchwald type, can be carried out according to the conditions described in Biorg. Med Chem. Lett., 11, 1375 (2001) or in Biorg. Med, Chern., 10, 3817 (2002).<br>
Another method for the synthesis of aryl(heteroaryl)piperazines, particularly advantageous in the context of the invention, when R5 and R6 represent hydrogen atoms, consists of the reaction of an aryl(heteroaryl)amine with a bis(2-hydroxy- or 2-haloethyl)amine, at a temperature of greater than 100-120°C according to scheme 3:<br>
R1-NH2    H<br>
Scheme 3 <br>
It is particularly advantageous to carry out the reaction in the presence of microwaves under the conditions described in Synth. Comm. , 28, 1175 (1998) or in Tetrahedron Lett, 38, 6875 (1997).<br>
The 1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine derivatives (lllb) in which R1, R5 and R6 are defined as above are either commercially available or are prepared according to conventional methods known to a person skilled in the art. Among these methods, the action, according to scheme 4, of an organometallic aryl(heteroaryl)derivative, such as an organomagnesium derivative, an organolithium derivative or an organocerium derivative, on a piperidin-4-one derivative, the nitrogen atom of which is substituted by a protective group, is particularly advantageous.<br><br>
PG = Boc, Ac, Cbz, Bn and the like M = MgCI(Br), CeCI2 and the tike<br>
Scheme 4<br><br><br><br>
It is particularly advantageous in the context of the invention to carry out the thionation using Lawesson's reagent, the reaction being carried out according to Bull. Soc. Chim. Belg., 87 , 293 (1978).<br>
Generally, products of general formula (la) or (lb) in accordance with the invention in which L is C(NH) can be prepared from the nitriles derived from the products of general formula (II), using the various methods known to a person skilled in the art, according to the reaction sequences of scheme 7:<br><br>
It is generally necessary to activate the not very reactive nitrile, either with aluminum chloride, the reaction being carried out according to J. Chem. Soc. 1947, 1110; or with cuprous iodide, the reaction being carried out according to Tetrahedron Lett., 34, 6395 (1993); or by converting nitrile to iminoether prior to the reaction with the piperazine or 1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine derivative, the reaction being carried out according to Eur J. Med Chem., 24,427(1989).<br>
Generally, products of general formula (la) in accordance with the invention in which L is C(NR7), with R7 the same as or different from the hydrogen atom, can be prepared from the products of general formula (la) in which L is C(O)<br><br><br><br>
The examples below illustrate, without implied limitation, the products of the invention. The various products are purified either as described in the examples or by LC/MS under the general conditions described below: Purification by LC/MS:<br>
The products were purified by LC/MS using a Waters FractionsLynx system composed of a Waters model 600 gradient pump, a Waters model 515 regeneration pump, a Waters Reagent Manager dilution pump, a Waters model 2700 auto-injector, two Rheodyne model LabPro valves, a Waters model 996 diode array detector, a Waters model ZMD mass spectrometer and a Gilson model 204 fraction collector. The system was controlled by the Waters FractionLynx software. Separation was carried out alternately on two Waters Symmetry columns (Ci8, 5 pm, 19x50 mm, catalog reference 186000210), one column undergoing regeneration with a 95/5 (v/v) water/acetonitrile mixture comprising 0.07% (v/v) of trifluoroacetic acid, while the other column was being used for separation. The columns were eluted using a linear gradient of from 5% to 95% of acetonitrile comprising 0.07% (v/v) of trifluoroacetic acid in water comprising 0.07% (v/v) of trifluoroacetic acid, at a flow rate of 10 ml/min. At the outlet of the separation column, one-thousandth of the effluent is separated by means of an LC Packing Accurate, diluted with methyl alcohol at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min and sent to the detectors, in a proportion of 75% to the diode array detector and the remaining 25% to the mass spectrometer. The rest of the effluent (999/1000) is sent to the fraction collector, where the flow is discarded for as long as the mass of the expected product is not detected by the FractionLynx software. The molecular formulae of the expected products are supplied to the FractionLynx software, which actuates the collection of the product when the mass signal detected corresponds to the ion [M+H]+ and/or to [M+Na]+. In certain cases, depending on the analytical LC/MS results, when an intense ion corresponding to [M+2H]++ was detected, the value corresponding to half the calculated molecular mass (MW/2) is also supplied to the FractionLynx software. Under these conditions, the collection is also actuated when the mass signal for the ion [M+2Hf* and/or [M+Na+H]++ is detected. The<br><br>
products were collected in tared glass tubes. After collection, the solvents were evaporated in a Savant AES 2000 or Genevac HT8 centrifugal evaporator and the masses of the products were determined by weighing the tubes after evaporation of the solvents.<br>
The LC/MS analyses were carried out on a Micromass model LCT device connected to an HP 1100 device. The abundance of the products was measured using an HP G1315A diode array detector over a wavelength range of 200-600 nm and a Sedex 65 light scattering detector. The mass spectra were acquired over a range of 180 to 800. The data were analyzed using the Micromass MassLynx software. Separation was carried out on a Hypersil BDS C18, 3 pm (50 * 4.6 mm) column, eluting with a linear gradient of from 5% to 90% of acetonitrile comprising 0.05% (v/v) of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in water comprising 0.05% (v/v) TFA, over 3.5 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The total analysis time, including the period for re-equilibrating the column, is 7 min.<br>
Example 1:<br>

(2000) 41, 5453-56, are dissolved in 50 ml of ethanol in a 100 ml three-necked flask, then 25 ml of water and 16.2 ml of an 85% aqueous potassium hydroxide solution are added and then the mixture is stirred for 20 hours at ambient temperature. After concentrating under reduced pressure, the reaction medium is taken up in 100 ml of water and then washed 3 times with 75 ml of diethyl ether. The aqueous phase is brought to pH = 3-4 by addition of hydrochloric acid and washed 3 times with 100 ml of dichloromethane. The aqueous phase is concentrated under vacuum and the residue is taken up in 10 ml of methanol and then filtered. Finally, the filtrate is taken up in 25 ml of isopropyl ether and the product is filtered off and washed with 2 times 2 ml of isopropyl ether. 2.5 g of 1-phenyl-1 H-imidazol-5-ylcarboxylic acid are thus obtained in the form of a brown solid, used as is in the following stage.<br><br>
Stage 2: 342 y\ of oxalyl chloride and a few drops of dimethylformamide are added successively to a solution of 0.5 g of 1-phenyl-1H-imidazol-5-yl-carboxylic acid in 25 ml of dichloromethane in a 100 ml three-necked flask under an argon atmosphere, and stirring is carried out for 2 hours at ambient temperature. The solution thus obtained is transferred into a dropping funnel and is added dropwise to a solution, cooled to 0°C under an argon atmosphere, of 575 mg of 1-(3-chlorophenyl)piperazine in 25 ml of dichloromethane comprising 560 pi of triethylamine and 132 pi of 4-dimethyl-aminopyridine.

Assessment of the inhibition of tubulin polymerization<br>
Tubulin is purified from pig brains according to published methods (Shelanski et al., 1973, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.USA, 70, 765-768. Weingarten et al., 1975, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.USA, 72, 1858-1862). Briefly, the brains are ground and centrifuged in an extraction buffer. The tubulin, present in the extract supernatant is subjected to two successive cycles of polymerization at 37°C and depolymerization at 4°C, before being separated from the MAPs (Microtubule Associated Proteins) by chromatography on a phosphocellulose P11 column (Whatman). The tubulin thus isolated is more than 95% pure. It is stored in a buffer known as RB/2 30% glycerol, the composition of which is 50 mM MES-NaOH [2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid], pH 6.8; 0.25 mM MgCI2; 0.5 mM EGTA; 30 % (v/v) glycerol, 0.2 mM GTP (guanosine 5'-tri-phosphate).<br>
The polymerization of the tubulin into microtubules is monitored by turbidimetry as follows: the tubulin is adjusted to a concentration of 10 pm (1 mg/ml) in the RB/2 30% glycerol buffer, to which are added 1 mM GTP and 6 mM MgCb- The polymerization is initiated by increasing the temperature from 6°C to 37°C in a cuvette with a 1 cm optical pathlength, placed in a UVIKON 931 spectrophotometer (Kontron) equipped with a thermostatically-regulated cuvette holder. The increase in turbidity of the solution is monitored at 350 nm.<br>
The products are dissolved at 10 mM in DMSO and added at variable concentrations (0.5 to 10 pm) to the tubulin solution before polymerization.<br><br>
The IC50 is defined as the concentration of the product which inhibits the rate of polymerization by 50%. A product with an IC50 of less than or equal to 25 pm is regarded as very active.<br>
A product in accordance with the invention may be of use in inhibiting the proliferation of tumor cells in vitro.<br>
Test for determining the inhibition of proliferation of the HCT116 human colon tumor line<br>
The proliferation of HCT116 cells is evaluated by mesuring the incorporation of [14C]-thymidine in the following way. The HCT166 cells (from the ATCC) are cultured in a DMEM medium (Gibco) which contains 10% of fetal calf serum and antibiotics (1% penicillin, 1% streptomycin). To perform the proliferation test, the cells are seeded into 96-well cytostar microplates (Amersham) at the rate of 5000 cells per well. The [14C]-thymidine (0.1 pCi/well) and the products to be evaluated are subsequently added. Variable concentrations of products up to 10 pM are used; the DMSO (solvent used to dissolve the products) should not exceed 0.5% in the medium. 48 hours after incubation at 37°C, the radioactivity incorporated into the cells is measured by counting the plate in a Tri-Lux counter (Wallac). The IC50 is defined as the concentration of product which reduces the radioactivity by 50% compared with an untreated control. A product with an IC50 of less than 10 pm is regarded as cytotoxic.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
