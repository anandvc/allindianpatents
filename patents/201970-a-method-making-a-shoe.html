METHOD OF MAKING A SHOE HAVING A FOAMED INSOLE<br>
This invention relates to a method of making a shoe, more particularly, to a method of making a shoe in which a foamed insole blank is formed into a finished and patterned insole during the course of assembly of the insole blank and other shoe components, such as an upper and an outsole.<br>
It is known to produce shoes having insoles made of resilient foamed materials, such as EVA foams, which possesses good softness to provide comfortable feeling and which has good resiliency to absorb shock. Such insoles may be fabricated by forming a foamable EVA composition introduced into a mold, or by forming in a mold an insole blank cut from a preformed EVA casting. The insoles as formed are usually bonded to uppers and outsoles by gluing processes . In the manufacture of many sport shoes, foamed insoles are provided with relief-like patterns at the peripheries thereof before they are glued to uppers and outsoles.<br>
Conventional processes available for making shoes having insoles with patterned or embossed peripheries generally comprises separate steps of forming an insole blank and embossing or ornamenting the insole blank to form a finished insole structure, and subsequent steps of bonding the so-formed insole to an upper and an outsole. It is desirable that bonding and patterning of shoe components, such as insoles, outsoles and uppers, can be performed simultaneously in order to facilitate and speed up the production of shoes.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide an<br><br>
2<br>
improved and simplified method of making a shoe having a foamed insole formed with ornamented peripheral patterns around the bottom of an upper.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an improved method of making a shoe wherein ornamentation of an insole blank is carried out simultaneously with the bonding of the insole blank to an upper and/or an outsole.<br>
According to one aspect of the invention, a method for making a shoe, which includes preparing an insole blank having top and bottom surfaces and a peripheral portion extending around the top and bottom surfaces, and applying an adhesive to the top of an outsole, is characterized by: positioning the adhesive-applied outsole in a mold assembly which includes at least two opposite side forming patterns for forming the peripheral portion of the insole blank; placing the insole blank in the mold assembly with the bottom surface being disposed adjacent the top of the outsole while the insole blank is being softened by heat to a plastic state; and pressing the insole blank in the plastic state against the outsole to bond the insole blank to the outsole, and pressing and patterning the peripheral portion of the insole blank via the side mold parts, wherein the bonding of the insole blank and the outsole and the patterning of the peripheral portion of the insole blank are carried out simultaneously by closing the mold assembly.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, a method of making a shoe, which includes preparing an insole blank having top and bottom surfaces and a peripheral portion<br><br>
3<br>
extending around the top and bottom surfaces, and applying an adhesive to the bottom of an upper, is characterized by: positioning the adhesive-applied upper in a mold assembly which includes at least two opposite side mold parts having forming patterns for forming the peripheral portion of the insole blank; placing the insole blank in the mold assembly with the top surface being disposed adjacent the bottom of the upper while the insole blank is being softened by heat to a plastic state; and pressing the insole blank in the plastic state against the upper to bond the insole blank to the upper, and pressing and patterning the peripheral portion of the insole blank, wherein the bonding of the insole blank and the upper and the patterning of the peripheral portion of the insole blank are carried out simultaneously by closing the mold assembly.<br>

Figure 12 is a schematic cross-sectional view illustrating assembly of an outsole and an insole blank enclosing an air cushion pocket in accordance with a fifth embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to Figures 1, 2 and 3, a first preferred embodiment of the method of making a shoe according to the present invention is directed to the assembly of a foamed insole blank 11 and an outsole 12.  The foamed insole blank<br><br>
5<br>
11 is prepared from an EVA polymer in a conventional manner, such as by forming a foamable EVA composition into the shape of an insole in a suitable mold, or by tailoring a preformed EVA foam. The foamed insole blank 11 is substantially flat and has top and bottom surfaces surrounded by a peripheral portion 110. The dimensions of the top and bottom surfaces of the foamed insole blank 11 are slightly greater than the dimensions of the top surface of the outsole 12. A mold assembly 1 used in this embodiment includes a bottom mold part 101 for positioning the outsole 12, two opposite side mold parts 102 and 103, and a top mold part 104 having a last. The side mold parts 102, 103 are provided with forming patterns 102', 103' for forming the peripheral portion of the insole blank 11.<br>
In operation, an adhesive, such as a heat-fusible adhesive, is applied to the top surface of the outsole 12, and the outsole 12 coated with the adhesive is positioned on the bottom mold part 101. The insole blank 11 is softened by heat to a plastic state and is placed in the mold assembly 1, while in the plastic state, with the bottom surface of the insole blank 11 in contact with the top surface of the outsole 12. The peripheral portion of the insole blank 11 projects outwardly of the periphery of the outsole 12. Ornamental pieces 111 having different colors are placed in the side mold parts 102, 103. The ornamental pieces 111 may be made of the same material as the insole blank 11 or a different material. In this embodiment, the ornamental pieces 111 are of the same material as the insole blank 11<br><br>
6<br>
and are preferably heated to a plastic state prior to placement in the side mold parts 102, 103. When the mold assembly 1 is closed at the plastic state of the insole blank 11, the insole blank 11 is pressed against and bonded to the outsole 12. At the same time, the peripheral portion of the insole blank 11 is pressed to project upward and patterned by the side mold parts 102' , 103' , and the ornamental pieces 111 positioned on the side mold parts 102, 103 are bonded to the peripheral portion of the insole blank 11, as shown in Figure 3. Due to the forming patterns 102', 103' of the side mold parts 102, 103, a relief-like pattern is produced on the peripheral portion of the insole blank 11.<br>
Alternatively, the two side mold parts 102, 103 of the mold 1 may be replaced with a single one-piece mold part which has a mold cavity opening at both of the top and bottom sides thereof. In this case, the bottom mold part 101 is fitted in the bottom side of the single one-piece mold part.<br>
Referring to Figure 4, in a second embodiment of the method of making a shoe according to the present invention, a foamed insole blank 21 and an upper 22 are assembled by using a mold assembly 2. The foamed insole blank 21 differs from the insole blank 11 in that the peripheral portion of the insole blank 21 has a peripheral upward flange 211. The mold assembly 2 includes a top mold part 201, a pair of clamp parts 202, 203, two opposite side mold parts 204, 205, and a bottom mold part 206. The inner surfaces of the side mold parts 204, 205 are provided with forming patterns for patterning the peripheral upward flange 211 of the insole<br><br>
7<br>
blank 21. The upper 22 is positioned to the top mold part 201 after an adhesive is applied to the bottom of the upper 22. The insole blank 21 is heated to a plastic state and is placed in the mold assembly 2 with the top surface thereof in contact with the bottom of the upper 22. The peripheral upward flange 211 of the insole blank 21 extends around the bottom of the upper 22. Referring to Figures 5 and 6 in combination with Figure 4, an ornamental strip 23 is positioned around the peripheral upward flange 211 of the insole blank 21 by means of fastening elements or strings 231 which tie the ornamental strip 23 and the insole blank 21 together. The ornamental strip 23 is of the same material as the insole blank 21 and is heated to a plastic state prior to placement in the mold assembly 2.<br>
When the mold assembly 2 is closed, the insole blank 21 and the ornamental strip 23, which are in the plastic state, are pressed and embossed and are bonded to the bottom of the upper 22. The peripheral upward flange 211 of the insole blank 21 is therefore patterned and ornamented by the ornamental strip 23.<br>
Referring to Figure 7, a third embodiment of the method of making a shoe according to the present invention is purposed to assemble an upper 32, an insole blank 31, and an outsole 33. In this embodiment, the insole blank 31 in the plastic state is placed in a mold assembly 3 together with the upper 32 and the outsole 33 coated with an adhesive. The mold assembly 3 includes a bottom mold part 301, a top mold part 302, left and right clamping parts 303, 304, and<br><br>
8<br>
a pair of side mold parts 305, 306 with inner surfaces provided with forming patterns 305", 306". When the mold 3 is closed, the upper 32, the insole blank 31 and the outsole 33 are assembled integrally together. At the same time, the insole blank 31 is formed into a final desired shape with the peripheral upward flange 311 thereof being embossed and patterned.<br>
Note that the mold assembly 3 is provided with fence plates 3 07, 3 08 adjacent, the top end of the side mold parts 305, 306. The fence plates 307, 308 are configured as elongated strips which are curved to conform to the contour of the upper 32. When the mold 3 is closed, the bottom ends of the fence plates 3 07, 308 abut against the top of the peripheral upward flange 311 of the insole blank 31, as shown in Figure 8, so that the flash produced from the insole blank 31 is blocked from flowing upward and is diverted to flow outwardly of the fence plates 307, 308. As such, no brow formation will occur around the insole blank 31 after assembly. The flash formed outwardly of the fence plates 307, 308 can be removed easily.<br>
Referring again to Figure 7, during the forming operation in the mold assembly 3, front and rear stop plates 331, 332 are disposed at the front and rear ends of the outsole 33 at locations corresponding to the front and rear seams of the two side mold parts 305, 306. The stop plates 331, 332 can be bonded to the front and rear ends of the upper 32 and the insole 31. The seams formed on the stop plates 331, 332 due to the front and rear seams of the side mold parts 305,<br><br>
9<br>
306 may be removed, if desired, by pressing and embossing the seams with a heated embossing tool.<br>
Figures 9 and 10 illustrate a fourth embodiment of the method of making a sandal.  In this embodiment, an insole blank 31' is provided with through-holes 311' at the margin thereof .  The upper 32' includes a plurality of sandal straps 321' attached with fastening elements 322'.  After the straps 321' pass through the through-holes 311' in the insole blank 31' which has been heated, the fastening elements 322' are connected to each other, thus bringing together the upper 32' and the insole 31'.  The upper 32' and the insole 31' are then placed within a top mold part or last 302' and left and right clamping parts 303', 304', as shown in Figure 10. When the mold assembly 3' is closed by bringing together the top mold part 302, the left and right clamping parts 303', ¦ 304' , side mold parts, 305', 306', and a bottom mold part 310' , the upper 32' and the insole 31' are united integrally together with an outsole 33' .<br>
Referring to Figure 11, in place of the aforesaid mold assembly 3' , another mold which has mother and daughter mold members may be used for making a sandal. A mold part 4 is provided with a cavity 401 opening at one side of the mold part 4. After a daughter mold member 402 is inserted into an upper 32" , the daughter mold member 402 together with the upper 32" is placed in the cavity 401. An insole 31" and an outsole 33" are then placed on the upper 32" . The mold part 4 is closed by a mold cover 403 to assemble the insole 31", the outsole 33" and the upper 32".<br><br>
10<br>
Referring to Figure 12, in a fifth embodiment of the present invention, an air cushion pocket 54 is attached to an insole blank 51 during assembly of the insole blank 51 and an outsole 53 in a mold assembly 5. The outsole 53 is first positioned in a top mold 504, and the insole blank 51, which is heated to a plastic state, is placed onto the outsole<br>
53	.  The air cushion pocket 54 is further placed on the insole<br>
blank 51 and covered by a cover plate 52 which is made of<br>
the same material as the insole blank 51.  When the mold<br>
assembly 5 is closed by moving side mold parts 502, 503 and<br>
a bottom mold part 501 toward the top mold part 504, the cover<br>
plate 52 is bonded to the insole blank 51, enclosing the air<br>
cushion pocket 54 therebetween, and the insole 51 and the<br>
outsole 53 are united together. As the air cushion pocket<br>
54	is inflated by injecting air through an air passage 56<br>
after the mold assembly 5 is closed, the insole blank 51 and<br>
the cover plate 52 are pressurized to abut against the inner<br>
surface of the side mold parts 502, 503. As a result, a clear<br>
embossed pattern is formed on the peripheral portion of the<br>
insole blank 51.  The product as formed possesses good shock<br>
absorbing characteristics due to the presence of the air<br>
cushion pocket 54.<br>
Shoes having shock absorbing properties may be fabricated by incorporating a PU foam into an insole in place of the air cushion pocket 54. In manufacturing, a liquid PU foam material is introduced into a mold between an outsole and an insole. Prior to introduction of the PU foam material into the mold, air is blown into the mold between the outsole<br><br>
11<br>
and the insole to create a space therebetween. At the same time, the peripheral portion of the insole blank in the plastic state is pressurized to abut against the inner surface of the mold. The PU foam material is introduced into the space as soon as the blowing of the air is stopped . A clear embossed pattern can be formed on the peripheral portion of the insole blank.<br><br>
