The present invention relates to a catalyst composition for the polymerization of olefins, in particular propylene, comprising a Mg dihalide based support on which are deposited a Ti compound having at least one Ti-halogen bond and at least two electron donor compounds selected from specific classes. The present invention further relates to the catalysts obtained from said components and to their use in processes for the polymerization of olefins. The catalysts of the present invention are able to give, with high yields, polymers characterized by high xylene insolubility, a broad range of isotacticity and are further characterized by a good balance between hydrogen response and isotacticity.<br>
Catalyst components for the stereospecific polymerization of olefins are widely known in the art. Basically two types of catalyst systems are used in the normal processes for the (co)polymerization of olefins. The first one, in its broadest definition, comprises TiCl3 based catalysts components, obtained for example by reduction of TiCl4 with Al-alkyls, used in combination with Al-compounds such as diethylaluminum chloride (DEAC). Despite the good properties of the polymers in terms of isotacticity said catalysts are characterized by a very low activity which causes the presence of large amounts of catalytic residues in the polymers. As a consequence, a further step of deashing is necessary to obtain a polymer having a content of catalytic residue that makes it acceptable for wide use. The second type of catalyst system comprises a solid catalyst component, constituted by a magnesium dihalide on which are supported a titanium compound and an internal electron donor compound, used in combination with an Al-alkyl compound. Conventionally however, when a higher crystallinity of the polymer is required, also an external donor (for example an alkoxysilane) is needed in order to obtain higher isotacticity. One of the<br><br>
preferred classes of internal donors is constituted by the esters of phthalic acid, diisobutylphthalate being the most used. This catalyst system is capable to give very good performances in terms of activity, isotacticity and xylene insolubility provided that an external electron donor compound is used. In its absence, low yields, low xylene insolubility and poor isotacticity are obtained. On the other hand, when the external donor is used, high xylene insolubility is obtained only together with a high isotacticity. This is not desirable in certain applications, such as production of bi-oriented polypropylene films (BOPP), where polypropylenes are required to have a lower flexural modulus (obtainable by lowering crystallinity of the polymer) while at the same time retaining a high xylene insolubility. As a consequence, it would be desirable to have a catalyst component with still improved characteristics, particularly in terms of activity and isotacticity, as well a catalyst component capable to give polymers coupling high xylene insolubility with a slight lower crystallinity suitable for making the polymers usable in the BOPP sector. Some improvements are obtained when, in the above mentioned catalyst system, the phthalates are substituted by the electron donor compounds disclosed for example in USP 4,971,937. In this case, the catalyst components obtained are capable to give better results when used in the absence of an external donor. In particular, the stereoregularity becomes acceptable, while however the xylene insolubility is still to be improved. Also in this case, when the catalyst component is used together with an external donor, high xylene insolubility is obtained only together with a high isotacticity.<br>
It is therefore felt the need of a versatile catalyst component which, for high values of xylene insolubility, is capable to give polymers with a broader range of isotacticity.<br><br>
Moreover, it would be also advantageous to have a catalyst component with still improved<br>
features in terms of activity and isotacticity.<br>
It has now unexpectedly been found a catalyst component having the above advantages<br>
which comprises Mg, Ti, halogen and two electron donor compounds selected from<br>
specific classes.<br>
It  is  therefore   an  object  of the  present  invention  a  catalyst  component  for  the<br>
polymerization of olefins CH2=CHR, in which R is hydrogen or a hydrocarbyl radical with<br>
1-12  carbon  atoms,  comprising Mg,  Ti,  halogen  and  at  least  two  electron  donor<br>
compounds, said catalyst component being characterized by the fact that at least one of the<br>
electron donor compounds is selected from ethers containing two or more ether groups<br>
which are further characterized by the formation of complexes with anhydrous magnesium<br>
dichloride in an amount less than 60 mmoles per 100 g of MgCl2 and by the failure of<br>
entering into substitution reactions with TiCl4 or by reacting in that way for less than 50%<br>
by moles, and at least another electron donor compound is selected from esters of mono or<br>
polycarboxylic acids.<br>
The  conditions  under  which,  the  reactivity  toward  titanium  tetrachloride   and  the<br>
complexing activity of the di or polyethers are tested, are reported below.<br>
Very surprisingly it has been found that the performances of the above-disclosed catalysts<br>
are not merely intermediate between those of the catalyst components containing the single<br>
donors. While we do not intend being bound to any theoretical interpretation, it can be said<br>
that a synergic interaction between the elements of the catalyst component, and maybe in<br>
particular between the above mentioned donors, is the basis for explaining the unexpected<br>
properties of the catalyst component of the invention.<br><br>
Among the di or polyethers mentioned above, particularly preferred are the compounds belonging to the class of the 1,3-diethers. In particular, preferred 1,3-diethers are those of formula (I)<br><br>

As explained above, the catalyst components of the invention comprise, in addition to the above electron donors, Ti, Mg and halogen. In particular, the catalyst components comprise a titanium compound, having at least a Ti-halogen bond and the above mentioned electron donor compounds supported on a Mg halide. The magnesium halide is preferably MgCl2 in active form which is widely known from the patent literature as a support for Ziegler-Natta catalysts. Patents USP 4,298,718 and USP 4,495,338 were the first to describe the use of these compounds in Ziegler-Natta catalysis.. It is known from these patents that the magnesium dihalides in active form used as support or co-support in components of catalysts for the polymerization of olefins are characterized by X-ray spectra in which the most intense diffraction line that appears in the spectrum of the non-active halide is diminished in intensity and is replaced by a halo whose maximum intensity is displaced towards lower angles relative to that of the more intense line.<br>
The preferred titanium compounds used in the catalyst component of the present invention are TiCl4 and TiCl3; furthermore, also Ti-haloalcoholates of formula Ti(OR)n.yXy can be<br><br>
used, where n is the valence of titanium, y is a number between 1 and n-1 X is halogen and R is a hydrocarbon radical having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms.<br>
The preparation of the solid catalyst component can be carried out according to several methods. According to one of these methods, the magnesium dichloride in an anhydrous state, the titanium compound and the electron donor compounds are milled together under conditions in which activation of the magnesium dichloride occurs. The so obtained product can be treated one or more times with an excess of TiCl4 at a temperature between 80 and 135°C. This treatment is followed by washings with hydrocarbon solvents until chloride ions disappeared. According to a further method, the product obtained by co-milling the magnesium chloride in an anhydrous state, the titanium compound and the electron donor compounds are treated with halogenated hydrocarbons such as 1,2-dichloroethane, chlorobenzene, dichloromethane etc. The treatment is carried out for a time between 1 and 4 hours and at temperature of from 40°C to the boiling point of the halogenated hydrocarbon. The product obtained is then generally washed with inert hydrocarbon solvents such as hexane.<br>
According to another method, magnesium dichloride is preactivated according to well known methods and then treated with an excess of TiCl4 at a temperature of about 80 to 135°C in the presence of the electron donor compounds. The treatment with TiCl4 is repeated and the solid is washed with hexane in order to eliminate any non-reacted TiCl4. A further method comprises the reaction between magnesium alcoholates or chloroalcoholates (in particular chloroalcoholates prepared according to USP 4,220,554) and an excess of TiCl4 in the presence of the electron donor compounds at a temperature of about80tol20°C.<br><br>
According to a preferred method, the solid catalyst component can be prepared by reacting a titanium compound of formula Ti(OR)„.yXy, where n is the valence of titanium and y is a number between 1 and n, preferably TiCl4, with a magnesium chloride deriving from an adduct of formula MgCl2pROH, where p is a number between 0.1 and 6, preferably from 2 to 3.5, and R is a hydrocarbon radical having 1-18 carbon atoms. The adduct can be suitably prepared in spherical form by mixing alcohol and magnesium chloride in the presence of an inert hydrocarbon immiscible with the adduct, operating under stirring conditions at the melting temperature of the adduct (100-130°C). Then, the emulsion is quickly quenched, thereby causing the solidification of the adduct in form of spherical particles. Examples of spherical adducts prepared according to this procedure are described in USP 4,399,054 and USP 4,469,648. The so obtained adduct can be directly reacted with Ti compound or it can be previously subjected to thermal controlled dealcoholation (80-130°C) so as to obtain an adduct in which the number of moles of alcohol is generally lower than 3 preferably between 0.1 and 2.5. The reaction with the Ti compound can be carried out by suspending the adduct (dealcoholated or as such) in cold TiCl4 (generally 0°C); the mixture is heated up to 80-130°C and kept at this temperature for 0.5-2 hours. The treatment with TiCl4 can be carried out one or more times. The electron donor compounds can be added during the treatment with TiCl4. They can be added together in the same treatment with TiCl4 or separately in two or more treatments . The preparation of catalyst components in spherical form are described for example in European Patent Applications EP-A-395083, EP-A-553805, EP-A-553806, EPA601525 andWO98/44001.<br><br>
The solid catalyst components obtained according to the above method show a surface area (by B.E.T. method) generally between 20 and 500 nr/g and preferably between 50 and 400 m2/g, and a total porosity (by B.E.T. method) higher than 0.2 cmVg preferably between 0.2 and 0.6 cmVg. The porosity (Hg method) due to pores with radius up to 10.000A generally ranges from 0.3 to 1.5 cm3/g, preferably from 0.45 to 1 cmVg.<br>
A further method to prepare the solid catalyst component of the invention comprises halogenating magnesium dihydrocarbyloxide compounds, such as magnesium dialkoxide or diaryloxide, with solution of TiCl4 in aromatic hydrocarbon (such as toluene, xylene etc.) at temperatures between 80 and 130°C. The treatment with TiCl4 in aromatic hydrocarbon solution can be repeated one or more times, and the electron donor compounds are added during one or more of these treatments.<br>
In any of these preparation methods the desired electron donor compounds and in particular those selected from esters of carboxylic acids, can be added as such or, in an alternative way, it can be obtained in situ by using an appropriate precursor capable to be transformed in the desired electron donor compound by means, for example, of known chemical reactions such as esterification, transesterification, etc.<br>
Regardless to the preparation method used, the final amount of the two or more electron donor compounds is such that the molar ratio with respect to the MgCl2 is from 0.01 to 1, preferably from 0.05 to 0.5, while the molar ratio between the di or polyether donor and the ester donor is comprised in the range of from 50 to 0.02 preferably from 30 to 0.1 and more preferably from 20 to 0.2.<br><br>
The solid catalyst components according to the present invention are converted into<br>
catalysts  for the  polymerization of olefins by reacting them  with organoaluminum<br>
compounds according to known methods.<br>
In particular, it is an object of the present invention a catalyst for the polymerization of<br>
olefins CH2=CHR, in which R is hydrogen or a hydrocarbyl radical with 1-12 carbon<br>
atoms, comprising the product of the reaction between:<br>
(i)       the solid catalyst component as disclosed above and<br>
(ii)      an alkylaluminum compound.<br>
The alkyl-Al compound (ii) is preferably chosen among the trialkyl aluminum compounds<br>
such as for example triethylaluminum, triisobutylaluminum, tri-n-butylaluminum, tri-n-<br>
hexylaluminum, tri-n-octylaluminum. It is also possible to use alkylaluminum halides,<br>
alkylaluminum hydrides or alkylaluminum sesquichlorides, such as AlEt2Cl and Al2Et3Cl3,<br>
possibly in mixture with the above cited trialkylaluminums.<br>
As  explained  above,  the  catalyst  component  of the   invention  when  used  in  the<br>
polymerization of propylene in the absence of external donors are able to give polymers<br>
with a controlled wide range of isotacticity (expressed in term of percentage of rnmmrn<br>
pentads) while maintaining high xylene insolubility levels.<br>
Furthermore, the catalyst components of the invention can also be used in combination with<br>
an external donor (iii) thereby obtaining very high values of both xylene insolubility and<br>
isotacticity. In particular, said values, individually or as a balance, are higher than the<br>
values obtainable with the catalyst containing the single donors.<br><br>
Suitable external electron-donor compounds include silicon compounds, ethers, esters, amines, heterocyclic compounds and particularly 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl piperidine, ketones and the 1,3-diethers of the general formula (V):<br><br>
wherein R1, R", Rni, RIV, Rv and RVI equal or different to each other, are hydrogen or<br>
hydrocarbon radicals having from 1 to 18 carbon atoms, and Rvu and RVIU, equal or<br>
different from each other, have the same meaning of R'-RVI except that they cannot be<br>
hydrogen; one or more of the R'-RV1!I groups can be linked to form a cycle. Particularly<br>
preferred are the 1,3-diethers in which Rvu and Rvm are selected from C,-C4 alkyl radicals.<br>
Another class of preferred external donor compounds is that of silicon compounds of formula<br>
Ra5Rb6Si(OR7)c, where a and b are integers from 0 to 2, c is an integer from 1 to 3 and the sum<br>
(a+b+c) is 4; R\ R6, and R7, are alkyl, cycloalkyl or aryl radicals with 1-18 carbon atoms<br>
optionally containing heteroatoms. Particularly preferred are the silicon compounds in which<br>
a is 1, b is 1, c is 2, at least one of R5 and R6 is selected from branched alkyl, cycloalkyl or<br>
aryl groups with 3-10 carbon atoms optionally containing heteroatoms and R7 is a C,-C10<br>
alkyl group, in particular methyl. Examples of such preferred silicon compounds are<br>
methylcyclohexyldimethoxysilane, diphenyldimethoxysilane, methyl-t-butyldimethoxysilane,<br>
dicyclopentyldimethoxysilane,	(2-ethylpiperidinyl)t-butyldimethoxysilane,	(2-<br>
ethylpiperidinyl)thexyldimethoxysilane,	(3,3,3-trifluoro-n-propyl)(2-<br>
ethylpiperidinyl)dimethoxysilane,	methyl(3,3,3-trifluoro-n-propyl)dimethoxysilane.<br><br>
Moreover, are also preferred the silicon compounds in which a is 0, c is 3, R6 is a branched alkyl or cycloalkyl group, optionally containing heteroatoms. and R7 is methyl. Examples of such preferred silicon compounds are cyclohexyltrimethoxysilane, t-butyltrimethoxysilane and thexyltrimethoxysilane.<br>
The electron donor compound (iii) is used in such an amount to give a molar ratio between the organoaluminum compound and said electron donor compound (iii) of from 0.1 to 500, preferably from 1 to 300 and more preferably from 3 to 100.<br>
Therefore, it constitutes a further object of the present invention a process for the (co)polymerization of olefins CH2=CHR, in which R is hydrogen or a hydrocarbyl radical with 1-12 carbon atoms, carried out in the presence of a catalyst comprising the product of the reaction between:<br>
(i)       a solid catalyst component comprising a titanium compound, having at least a Ti-halogen bond, and at least two electron donor compounds supported on a Mg halide said catalyst being characterized by the fact that at least one of the electron donors compounds is selected from ethers containing two or more ether groups which are further characterized by the formation of complexes with anhydrous magnesium dichloride in an amount less than 60 mmoles per 100 g of MgCl2 and by the failure of entering into substitution reactions with TiCl4 or by reacting in that way for less than 50% by moles, and at least another electron donor compound is selected from esters of mono or polycarboxylie acids; (ii)      an alkylaluminum compound and, (iii)     optionally an electron-donor compound (external donor).<br><br>
The polymerization process can be carried out according to known techniques for example<br>
slurry polymerization using as diluent an inert hydrocarbon solvent, or bulk polymerization<br>
using the liquid monomer (for example propylene) as a reaction medium. Moreover, it is<br>
possible to carry out the polymerization process in gas-phase operating in one or more<br>
fluidized or mechanically agitated bed reactors.<br>
The polymerization is generally carried out at temperature of from 20 to 120°C, preferably<br>
of from 40 to 80°C. When the polymerization is carried out in gas-phase the operating<br>
pressure is generally between 0.5 and 5 MPa, preferably between 1 and 4 MPa. In the bulk<br>
polymerization the operating pressure is generally between  1  and 8  MPa preferably<br>
between 1.5 and 5 MPa.<br>
The following examples are given in order to better illustrate the invention without limiting<br>
it.<br>
