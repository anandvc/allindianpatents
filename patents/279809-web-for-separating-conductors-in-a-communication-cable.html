TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
WEB FOR SEPARATING CONDUCTORS IN A COMMUNICATION CABLE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[001] The present invention relates to a web for separating conductors in a communications cable. In particular, the present invention relates to a cross talk reducing separator web, or spline, which ensures predetermined positioning of twisted pairs of conductors relative to one another.<br>
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION<br>
[002] One problem which must be surmounted when implementing high speed data communications such as the 10 Gigabit Ethernet is the reduction in cross talk between adjacent cables, typically referred to as Power Sum Alien Near End Cross (PSANEXT) and Power Sum Alien Equal Level Far End Cross Talk (PSAELFEXT). One technique which has been proposed and been shown effective in lower speed networks is the use of separator web or spline running along the length of the cable and positioned between the four (4) twisted pairs of conductors which are used for transferring data along the cable. One drawback of these prior art designs is that when such prior art cables are placed adjacent to one another (as is typically the case in cable runs and conduit and the like), the twisted pairs having the longest twist in a given cable are the same distance from the geometric centre of the cable as the other twisted pairs. As an increase in proximity of twisted pairs of conductors located in adjacent cables and having longer twist lays increases PSANEXT and PSAELFEXT (due to an increased coupling between twisted pairs having longer lays relative to those having shorter lays). In addition, each individual pair exhibits relatively high levels of unbalance known to cause common mode<br>
<br>
-2A-<br>
signal noise. This can lead to a degradation in the performance of (and therefore the signals being transmitted by) each of the cables which cannot be compensated for due to the large number of noise signals originating from like pairs of a typically a large number of adjacent cables (up to 6 adjacent cables and 48 disturbing twisted pairs of conductors in a worst case).<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[003] The present invention addresses the above and other drawbacks by providing a telecommunications cable comprising a cable jacket defining an elongate cable core, four twisted pairs of conductors disposed along the core, each of the conductors comprising a conductive core surrounded by an insulation, and a spline separating the four twisted pairs of conductors from one another. The spline and the insulation are fabricated from a material having a matching dielectric constant.<br>
[004] There is also disclosed a telecommunications cable comprising a cable jacket defining an elongate cable core, four twisted pairs of conductors disposed along the core and a plurality of parallel displacing ridges in an outer surface of the cable jacket, the ridges substantially evenly spaced about an outer circumference of the cable jacket and winding helicoidally along the cable about the core.<br>
[005] Furthermore, there is described a telecommunications cable comprising a cable jacket defining an elongate cable core, a conductor assembly comprising four twisted pairs of conductors disposed along the core, and a plurality of parallel elongate localised and like distensions in an inner surface of the cable jacket, the distensions substantially evenly spaced about an inner surface of the cable jacket. The distensions prevent the conductor assembly from coming into contact with the inner surface.<br>

[006] Additionally, there is disclosed a separator spline for use in a telecommunications cable. The spline comprises first and second elongate dividing strips having a substantially H shaped cross section and arranged side by side. The spline twists helicoidally along its length.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS<br>
[014] Referring now to Figure 1, a telecommunications cable, generally referred to using the reference numeral 10, will now be described. The cable 10, is comprised of four (4) twisted pairs of conductors 12 separated by a separator web 14 and encased in a cable jacket 16. In a particular embodiment one or more filler elements as in 18 can be included positioned between the cable jacket 16 and the conductors 12. Additionally, a shielding foil or the like (not shown) may also be included between positioned between cable jacket 16 and the filler elements 18.<br>
[015] Still referring to Figure 1, as known in the art, the twisted pairs of conductors 12 are typically twisted with different twist lays (i.e. number of twists per unit length). These twist lays can be regular and predetermined or can vary along the length of the cable 10, for example between a maximum and a minimum value. In the latter case, the twist lays can vary either randomly or in accordance with a predetermined pattern (for example steadily increasing or decreasing over a predetermined distance). Of note is that the direction of lay is often reversed at points along a given twisted pair of conductors as in 12 in order to simplify manufacturing.<br>
[016] Still referring to Figure 1, the separator web 14 separating the twisted<br>
<br>
-5-<br>
pairs of conductors 12 from one another also typically twists helically along a length of the cable 10 such that the individual twisted pairs of conductors as in 12 follow substantially parallel helical paths along the length of the cable. Similar to the twist lay of the individual twisted pairs of conductors as in 12, the lay of the individual twisted pairs of conductors as in 12 (typically referred to as the strand lay) as the travel along the length of the cable 12 can be either constant or can vary between a minimum and maximum stand lay. In the latter case, the rate of variance can be either or random or predetermined (again, for example, a steady increase or decrease between a minimum and maximum stand lay along a length of the cable 10).<br>
[017] Referring now to Figure 2A, in an illustrative embodiment of the present invention, a separator web 14 comprising two (2) separating parts 20, 22 having an L shaped transverse cross section and touching along a heel 24 thereof is provided. The separating parts having the L shaped transverse cross-section 20, 22 separate the core of the cable 10, as defined by the cable jacket 16 into four quadrants. One of each of the twisted pairs as in 12 rests in each of the quadrants. A second pair of substantially flat, parallel and opposed spacing elements as in 26, 28 are attached along an outer edge as in 30 of each of the separating parts having the L shaped transverse cross-section 20, 22.<br>
[018] In a particular embodiment each of the separating parts having the L shaped transverse cross-section 20, 22 is fabricated together with its spacing element as in 26, 28 thereby forming an "h" shaped web portion. During cable manufacture the two (2) "h" shaped web portions (each comprised of a separating part having an L shaped transverse cross-section 20, 22 and a spacing element as in 26, 28) in parallel and subsequently stranded together with the four (4) twisted pairs of conductors as in 12 to form the core of the cable 20 and in particular the finished separator web 14. In this regard the separating parts having the L shaped transverse cross-section 20, 22 of each<br>
<br>
-6-<br>
"h" shaped web portion touch along a heel thereof (which incidentally coincides with the geometric centre A of the cable 10).<br>
[019] The position of the two (2) "h" shaped web portions can be offset or staggered relative to one another which in turn staggers the positioning of the four (4) twisted pairs of conductors as in 12 relative to one another. In particular, the twisted pairs of conductors as in 12 having the longest twist lays (illustratively twisted pairs 12i and 123) can be positioned closer to one another and the twisted pairs having the shorter twist lays (illustratively twisted pairs 122 and 124) can be positioned farther from one another. In this regard, a radius r\ of a double helix formed by the twisted pairs 12i and 123 having the longer twist lays is less than a radius r2 of a double helix formed by the twisted pairs 122 and 124 having the shorter twist lays. As a result, the twisted pairs 12i and 123 having the longer twist lays are located closer to the geometric centre (designated by the point A) of the cable 10 than the twisted pairs 122 and 124 having the shorter twist lays.<br>
[020] Still referring to Figure 2A, locating the twisted pairs having longer twist lays closer to the centre A of the cable 10 has a number of effects. For example, and now as will be apparent to a person of skill in the art, the twisted pairs having the longer twist lays of adjacent cables will now be farther apart. As discussed above, the coupling between twisted pairs having longer lays is greater than those having shorter lays and therefore an increase in distance between those twisted pairs having longer twist lays in this manners leads to a reduction in PSANEXT and PSAELFEXT. Additionally, the increased distance is filled primarily with dry air which is a better dielectric than plastics, which also leads to a reduction in coupling and a resultant twisted pairs having the longer twist lays. Furthermore, the twisted pairs having shorter lays generally incorporate more conductive material per unit length than twisted pairs having longer twist lays, and therefore a shielding effect arises.<br>
<br>
-7-<br>
[021] Still referring to Figure 2A, the "h" shaped web portions of the separator web 14 also serve to prevent the twisted pairs of conductors 12 from touching the inside surface 32 of the cable jacket 16. As known in the art, such cable jackets are typically manufactured from PVC or the like which has relatively high dielectric constant with a resultant increased loss factor. By separating the twisted pairs of conductors 12 from the inside surface 24 of the cable jacket 16 using air space and the separator web 14, the composite dielectric constant and loss factor can be lowered. As a result, less copper conductor and insulation must be used to meet, for example, the attenuation requirements of the Category 6 augmented standard.<br>
[022] Of note is that the individual "h" shaped web portions of the separator web 14, although illustrated as being reverse mirrored images of one another, do not have to be of the same dimension. Indeed, in a particular embodiment the dimensions of each of the "h" shaped web portions can be different in order to achieve a desired positioning of the twisted pairs of conductors 12 relative to one another, relative to the centre A of the cable 12 and relative to the inside surface 24 of the cable jacket 16.<br>
[023] Referring to Figure 2B, in an alternative illustrative embodiment, the two (2) "h" shaped web portions are co-joined, either during manufacture of the separator web 14 or subsequently using a bonding technique such as a suitable adhesive, welding, etc..<br>
[024] Referring now to Figure 2C, in a second alternative illustrative embodiment of the cable 10 of the present invention, the separator web 14 is comprised of two (2) "H" shaped web portions 34, 36. Each of said "H" shaped web portions 34, 36 is comprised of a central strip 38, an inner strip 40 attached towards a centre 42 thereof at right angles to an inner edge 44 of said<br>
<br>
-8-<br>
central strip 38 and an outer strip 46 attached towards a centre 48 thereof at right angles to an outer edge 50 of said central strip 38. Similar to the "h" shaped web portions as discussed hereinabove the position of the two (2) "H" shaped web portions 34, 36 can be offset or staggered relative to one another which in turn staggers the positioning of the four (4) twisted pairs of conductors as in 12 relative to one another. In particular, the twisted pairs of conductors as in 12 having the longest twist lays (illustratively twisted pairs 122 and 124) can be positioned closer to one another and the twisted pairs having the shorter twist lays (illustratively twisted pairs 121 and 123) can be positioned farther from one another. As a result, the twisted pairs 122 and 124 having the longer twist lays are located closer to the geometric centre (again designated by the point A) of the cable 10 than the twisted pairs 121 and 123 having the shorter twist lays.<br>
[025] The H shaped web portions 34, 36 also illustratively include a pair of filler elements as in 52. The filler elements as in 52 are positioned between the inner surface 32 of the cable jacket 16 and the H shaped web portions 34, 36. The filler elements illustratively serve to introduce more air space as in 54 between the inner surface 32 of the jacket 16 and the twisted pairs of conductors as in 12. Additionally, the filler elements as in 52 ensure that the inner surface 32 of the jacket 16 is smooth in those regions where the jacket 16 is proximate to the H shaped web portions 34, 36.<br>
[026] Additionally, and in a particular variant of the second alternative illustrative embodiment, the two (2) "H" shaped web portions 34, 36 are co-joined, either during manufacture of the separator web 14 or subsequently using a bonding technique such as a suitable adhesive, welding, etc.<br>
[027] Referring now to Figure 2D, in a third alternative illustrative embodiment of the present invention, the separator web 14 comprises a first strip 56 onto a<br>
<br>
-9-<br>
first side of which is attached a second strip 58 and onto a second side of which is attached a third strip 60. The second strip 58 and third strip 60 are attached to the first strip 54 such that the second strip 58 is nearer one end of the first strip 54 than the third strip 60, thereby giving the separator web 14 a staggered X transverse cross section. Additionally, one or more filler elements as in 62 is provided. The filler elements as in 62 can be either individually wound about the twisted pairs of conductors as in 12 and the separator web 14 during manufacture or alternatively can form part of or otherwise be attached to a sheath as in 64 which surrounds the twisted pairs of conductors as in 12 and the separator web 14. The filler elements as in 62 introduce air spaces as in 66 between the twisted pairs of conductors as in 12 and the inner surface 32 of the cable jacket 16.<br>
[028] Referring now to Figure 2E, in practice when the (typically PVC) cable jacket 16 is extruded over the twisted pair 12/separator web 14 the filler elements 48 introduce a series of elongate depressions in the inner surface of the cable jacket 16 which results in corresponding series of four (4) ridges as in 68 being formed in the outside of the cable jacket 16 in the region of the filler elements 38. As the separator web is twisted helicoidally along the length L of the cable 10, the ridges as in 68 also twist along the length L of the cable 10. One advantage of such a construction is that the provision of a plurality of ridges as in 68, in this case four (4), ensures that adjacent cables as in 10 are unable to nest, which increases the distance between adjacent cables, thereby reducing PSANEXT and PSAELFEXT with a corresponding improvement in high frequency performance. Additionally, the cable jacket 16 may also slightly deform the ends as in 70 of the two (2) "H" shaped web portions 34, 36 where the filler elements 52 are located, thereby ensuring the twisted pairs as in 12 remain displaced from the inner surface 32 of the cable jacket 16.<br>
[029] Additionally, the balance of the pairs may be further improved by<br>
<br>
-10-<br>
ensuring that the materials used to manufacture the separator web 14, the filler elements 52 and the insulation surrounding the twisted pairs of conductors 12 all have the same or similar dielectric properties.<br>
[030] Referring now to Figure 2F, in a fourth illustrative embodiment of the present invention the inner surface 32 of the cable jacket 16 may be fluted during the extruded process to include a series of small raised undulations or distensions as in 72, illustratively of partially-spherical cross section. The distensions as in 72 typically run straight along the length of the cable 10, or alternatively twist helicoidally opposite to the direction of helicoidal twist of the twisted pair 12/separator web 14 assembly, and therefore do not nest between the filler elements as in 52 of the separator web 14. As a result, a smaller number (illustratively four or five distensions as in 72) of smaller diameter can be used, thereby reducing the amount of material which must be added in order to form the distensions as in 72, while still achieving an improved separation between the twisted pairs of conductors as in 12 and inside of the cable jacket 32. In an illustrative embodiment the height of the distensions as in 72 is at least about 25% of the thickness of the jacket.<br>
[031] Although the present invention has been described hereinabove by way of an illustrative embodiment thereof, this embodiment can be modified at will without departing from the spirit and nature of the subject invention.<br>
