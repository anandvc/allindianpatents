METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CONTROLLING AN ELECTRO-MECHANICAL<br>
TRANSMISSION DURING A SHIFT EXECUTION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] This invention pertains generally to powertrain control systems for<br>
fuel/electric hybrid powertrain systems, and more specifically to powertrain<br>
control during transmission shifts.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Fuel/electric hybrid powertrain architectures comprise torque-<br>
generative devices, including internal combustion engines and electric<br>
machines, which transmit torque through a transmission device to a vehicle<br>
driveline. One such transmission includes a two-mode, compound-split,<br>
electro-mechanical transmission which utilizes an input member for receiving<br>
motive torque from an internal combustion engine, and an output member for<br>
delivering motive torque from the transmission to the vehicle driveline<br>
Exemplary electro-mechanical transmissions are selectively operative in fixed<br>
gear modes and continuously variable modes through actuation of torque-<br>
transfer clutches. A fixed gear mode occurs when rotational speed of the<br>
transmission output member is a fixed ratio of rotational speed of the input<br>
member from the engine, typically due to actuation of one or more torque-<br>
transfer clutches. A continuously variable mode occurs when rotational speed<br>
of the transmission output member is variable based upon operating speeds of<br>
one or more electrical machines. The electrical machines can be connected to<br>
the output shaft via actuation of a clutch, or by direct connection. Clutch<br>
actuation and deactivation is typically effected through a hydraulic circuit,<br>
including electrically-actuated hydraulic flow management valves, pressure<br>
control solenoids, and pressure monitoring devices controlled by a control<br>
module.<br><br>
GP-307817-PTH-CD<br>

operatively connected to the electrically variable transmission device until the<br>
slippage of the off-going torque-transfer clutch exceeds a threshold. Limiting<br>
a change in operation of the electrical machine comprises limiting an output<br>
torque of the electrical machine, comprising limiting a time-rate change in the<br>
output torque and limiting a magnitude of the output torque. The limit of the<br>
change in operation of the electrical machine is discontinued when the<br>
 slippage of the off-going torque-transfer clutch exceeds the threshold.<br>

those skilled.in the art upon reading and understanding the following detailed<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF AN EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0014| Referring now to the drawings, wherein the depictions are for the<br>
purpose of illustrating the invention only and not for the purpose of limiting<br>
the same. Figs. 1 and 2 depict a system comprising an engine 14, transmission<br>
10, control system, and driveline which has been constructed in accordance<br>
with an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[0015] Mechanical aspects of exemplary transmission 10 are disclosed in<br>
detail in commonly assigned U.S. Patent No. 6.953.409, entitled "Two-Mode,<br>
Compound-Split, Hybrid Electro-Mechanical Transmission having Four Fixed<br>
Ratios", which is incorporated herein by reference The exemplary two-mode.<br>
compound-split, electro-mechanical hybrid transmission embodying ihe<br>
concepts of the present invention is depicted in Fig 1, and is designated<br>
generally by the numeral 10. The transmission 10 has an input shaft 12 that is<br>
preferably directly driven by an internal combustion engine 14. The<br>
transmission 10 utilizes three planetary-gear sets 24, 26 and 28, and four<br>
torque-transmitting devices, i.e., clutches Cl 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75. An<br>
electro-hydraulic control system 42, preferably controlled by transmission<br>
control module 17, is operative to control actuation and deactivation of the<br>
clutches. Clutches C2 and C4 preferably comprise hydraulically-actuated<br>
rotating friction clutches. Clutches Cl and C3 preferably comprise<br>
comprising hydraulically-actuated stationary devices grounded to the<br>
transmission case 68.<br>
[0016] The three planetary gear sets 24, 26 and 28 each comprise simple<br>
planetary gear sets. Furthermore, the first and second planetary' gear sets 24<br>
and 26 are compounded in that the inner gear member of the first planetary<br>
gear set 24 is conjoined to an outer gear member of the second planetary gear<br>
set 26, and connected to a first electrical machine comprising a<br>
motor/generator 56, also referred to as "MG-A".<br><br>
GP-307817-PTH-CD<br>
5<br>
[0017] The planetary gear sets 24 and 26 are further compounded in that<br>
carrier 36 of the first planetary gear set 24 is conjoined through a shaft 60, to<br>
the carrier 44 of the second planetary gear set 26. As such, carriers 36 and 44<br>
of the first and second planetary gear sets 24 and 26, respectively, are<br>
conjoined. The shaft 60 is also selectively connected to the carrier 52 of the<br>
third planetary gear set 28, through clutch C2 62. The carrier 52 of the third<br>
planetary gear set 28 is connected directly to the transmission output member<br>
64. An inner gear member of the second planetary gear set 26 is connected to<br>
an inner gear member of the third planetary gear set 28 through a sleeve shaft<br>
66 that circumscribes shaft 60. and is connected to a second electrical machine<br>
comprising a motor/generator 72, referred to as MG-B.<br>
[0018] All the planetary gear sets 24, 26 and 28 as well as MG-A and MG-B<br>
56 and 72 are preferably coaxially oriented, as about the axially disposed shaft<br>
60. MG-A and MG-B 56 and 72 are both of an annular configuration which<br>
permits them to circumscribe the three planetary gear sets 24, 26 and 28 such<br>
that the planetary gear sets 24, 26 and 28 are disposed radially inwardly of the<br>
MG-A and MG-B 56 and 72. Transmission output member 64 is operably<br>
connected to a vehicle driveline 90 to provide motive torque. Each dutch is<br>
preferably hydraulic-ally actuated, receiving pressurized hydraulic fluid from a<br>
pump, described below, via an electro-hydraulic control circuit 42 described<br>
hereinbelow with reference to Fig. 4.<br>
[0019] The transmission 10 receives input motive torque from the torque-<br>
generative devices, including the engine 14 and the VIG-A 56 and MG-B 72,<br>
as a result of energy conversion from fuel or electrical potential stored in an<br>
electrical energy storage device (ESD) 74. The ESD 74 typically comprises<br>
one or more electrochemical energy storage batteries. Other electrical energy<br>
and electrochemical energy storage devices that have the ability to store<br>
electric power and dispense electric power may be used in place of the<br>
batteries without altering the concepts of the present invention. The PSD 74 is<br>
preferably  sized  based upon factors including regenerative  requirements.<br><br>
GP-307817-PTH-CD<br>
6<br>
application issues related to typical road grade and temperature, and<br>
propulsion requirements such as emissions, power assist and electric range<br>
The ESD 74 is, high voltage DC-coupled to transmission power inverter<br>
module ('TPIM') 19 via DC transfer conductors 27. The TP1M 19 is an<br>
element of the control system described hereinafter with regard to Fig. 2. The<br>
TPIM 19 transmits electrical energy to and from MG-A 56 by transfer<br>
conductors 29, and the TPIM 19 similarly transmits electrical energy to and<br>
from MG-B 72 by transfer conductors 31 Electrical current is transmitted to<br>
and from the.ESD 74 in accordance with whether the ESD 74 is being charged<br>
or discharged. TPIM 19 includes the pair of power inverters and respective<br>
motor control modules configured to receive motor control commands and<br>
control inverter states therefrom for providing motor drive or regeneration<br>
functionality.<br>
[0020] In motoring control, the respective inverter receives current from the<br>
DC transmission lines and provides AC current to the respective electrical<br>
machine, i.e., MG-A and MG-B, over transfer conductors 29 and 31 In<br>
regeneration control, the respective inverter receives AC current from the<br>
electrical machine over transfer conductors 29 and 3 I and transmits current to<br>
the DC lines 27. The net DC current provided to or from the inverters<br>
determines the charge or discharge operating mode of the electrical energy<br>
storage device 74 Preferably, MG-A 56 and MG-B 72 are three-phase AC<br>
machines each having a rotor operable to rotate within a stator that is mounted<br>
on a case of the transmission. The inverters comprise known complementary<br>
three-phase power electronics devices.<br>
[0021] Referring again to Fig. 1, a drive gear SO may be presented from the<br>
input member 12, As depicted, the drive gear 80 fixedly connects the input<br>
member 12 to the outer gear member 30 of the first planetary gear set 24. and<br>
the drive gear 80, therefore, receives power from the engine 14 and/or the<br>
electrical machines 56 and/or 72 through planetary gear sets 24 and/or 26. The<br>
drive gear 80 meshingly engages an idler gear 82 which, in turn, meshing!v<br><br>
GP-307817-PTH-CD<br>
7<br>
engages a transfer gear 84 that is secured to one end of a shaft 86. The other<br>
end of the shaft 86 may be secured to a hydraulic/transmission fluid pump 88<br>
Hydraulic pump 88 is a known device preferably sized to supply hydraulic<br>
fluid to the hydraulic circuit of the transmission at pressure/flow rates<br>
sufficient to meet system requirements, including pressure levels for clutch<br>
actuation, and flow rates sufficient to meet needs for system cooling and<br>
lubrication. Further details of the exemplary hydraulic circuit are depicted<br>
with reference to Fig 4, described hereinbelow.<br>
[0022] Referring now to Fig. 2, a schematic block diagram of the control<br>
system, comprising a distributed control module architecture, is depicted. The<br>
elements described hereinafter comprise a subset of an overall vehicle control<br>
architecture, and are operable to provide coordinated system control of the<br>
powertrain system described herein. The control system is operable to<br>
synthesize pertinent information and inputs, and execute algorithms to control<br>
various actuators to achieve control targets, including such parameters as fuel<br>
economy, emissions, performance, driveability, and protection of hardware,<br>
including batteries of ESD 74 and MG-A and MG-B 56, 72. The distributed<br>
control module architecture includes engine control module ("ECM") 23.<br>
transmission control module (TCM') 17, battery pack control module<br>
('BPCM') 21, and TPIM 19. A hybrid control module ('HCP') 5 provides<br>
overarching control and coordination of the aforementioned control modules.<br>
There is a User Interface ('UF) 13 operably connected to a plurality of devices<br>
through which a vehicle operator typically controls or directs operation of the<br>
powertrain through a request for torque, T,,, including the transmission 10.<br>
Exemplary vehicle operator inputs to the UI 13 include an accelerator pedal., a<br>
brake pedal, transmission gear selector, and, vehicle speed cruise control.<br>
Each of the aforementioned control modules communicates with other control<br>
modules, sensors, and actuators via a local area network ("LAN') bus 6. The<br>
FAN bus 6 allows for structured communication of control parameters and<br>
commands between the various control modules. The specific communication<br><br>
GP-307817-PTH-CD<br>
8<br>
protocol utilized is application-specific. The LAN bus and appropriate<br>
protocols provide for robust messaging and multi-control module interfacing<br>
between the aforementioned control modules, and other control modules<br>
providing functionality such as antilock brakes, traction control, and vehicle<br>
stability.<br>
[0023] The HCP 5 provides overarching control of the hybrid powertrain<br>
system, serving to coordinate operation of the ECM 23, TCM 17. TPIM 19,<br>
and BPO1Y1 21 Based upon various input signals from the 1,1 13 and the<br>
powertrain, including the battery pack, the HCP 5 generates various<br>
commands, including: an operator torque T,,, an engine torque command.<br>
clulch torque commands foi the various clutches Cl, C2, C3, C4 of the<br>
transmission 10; and motor torque commands for MG-A and MG-B. The<br>
TCM is operatively connected to the electro-hydraulic control circuit 42 of<br>
Fig. 4. including monitoring various pressure sensing devices, depicted<br>
generally as sensing device 78, and generating and executing control signals<br>
for various solenoids to control pressure switches and control valves contained<br>
therein<br>
[0024] The ECM 23 is operably connected to the engine 14, and functions to<br>
acquire data from a variety of sensors and control a variety of actuators,<br>
respectively, of the engine 14 over a plurality of discrete lines collectively<br>
depicted as aggregate line 35. The ECM 23 receives the engine torque<br>
command from the HCP 5, and generates a desired axle torque, and an<br>
indication of actual input torque, T1 from the engine to the transmission, which<br>
is communicated to the HCP 5. For simplicity, ECM 23 is depicted generally<br>
having bi-directional interface with engine 14 via aggregate line 35. Various<br>
other parameters that may be sensed by ECM 23 include engine coolant<br>
temperature, input speed, N1. from the engine to shaft 12 leading to the<br>
transmission, manifold pressure, ambient air temperature, and ambient<br>
pressure Various actuators that may be controlled by the ECM 23 include fuel<br>
injectors, ignition modules, and throttle control modules.<br><br>
GP-307817-PTH-CD<br>
9<br>
[0025] The TCM 17 is operably connected to the transmission 10 and<br>
functions to acquire data from a variety of sensors and provide command<br>
signals to the transmission. Inputs from the TCM 17 to the HCP 5 include<br>
estimated clutch torques for each of the clutches Cl, C2, C3, and, C4 and<br>
rotational speed, N,,, of the output shaft 64. Other actuators and sensors may<br>
be used to provide additional information from the TCM to the HCP for<br>
control purposes.<br>
[0026] The BPCM 21 is signally connected one or more sensors operable to<br>
monitor electrical current or voltage parameters of the ESD 74 to provide<br>
information about the state of the batteries to the HCP 5. Such information<br>
includes batteiy state-of-eharge, battery voltage and available battery power.<br>
[0027] The TPI.M 19 includes previously referenced power inverters and<br>
motor control modules configured to receive motor control commands and<br>
control inverter states therefrom to provide motor drive or regeneration<br>
functionality. The TPIM 19 is operable to generate torque commands for MG-<br>
A 56 and MG-B 72, based upon input from the HCP 5, which is driven by<br>
operator input through UI 13 and system operating parameters. The motor<br>
torque commands for MG-A and MG-B are implemented by the control<br>
system, including the TPIM 19, to control MG-A and MG-B. Individual<br>
motor speed signals for MG-A and MG-B are derived by the TPIM 19 from<br>
the motor phase information or conventional rotation sensors. The TPIM 19<br>
determines and communicates motor speeds to the HCP 5. The electrical<br>
energy storage device 74 is high-voltage DC-coupled to the TPIM 19 via DC<br>
lines 27. Electrical current is transferable to or from the TPIM 19 in<br>
accordance with whether the ESD 74 is being charged or discharged.<br>
[0028] Each of the aforementioned control modules is preferably a general -<br>
purpose digital computer generally comprising a microprocessor or central<br>
processing unit, storage mediums comprising read-only-memory (ROM),<br>
random access memory (RAM), electrically programmable read-only-memory<br>
(EPROM), high speed clock, analog to digital (A/D) and digital to analog<br><br>
GP-307817-PTH-CD<br>
10<br>
(D/A) conversion circuitry, and input/output circuitry and devices (I/O) and<br>
appropriate signal conditioning and buffer circuitry. Each control module has<br>
a set of control algorithms, comprising machine-readable code consisting of<br>
resident program instructions and calibrations stored in ROM and executed to<br>
provide the respective functions of each computer. Information transfer<br>
between the various computers is preferably accomplished using the<br>
aforementioned LAN 6.<br>
[0029] Algorithms for control and state estimation in each of the control<br>
modules are. typically executed during preset loop cycles such that each<br>
algorithm is executed at least once each loop cycle. Algorithms stored in the<br>
non-volatile memory devices are executed by one of the central processing<br>
units and are operable to monitor inputs from the sensing devices and execute<br>
control and diagnostic routines to control operation of the respective device.<br>
using preset calibrations. Loop cycles are typically executed at regular<br>
intervals, for example each 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 100 milliseconds during<br>
ongoing engine and vehicle operation. Alternatively, algorithms may be<br>
executed in response to occurrence of an event.<br>
[0030] In response to an operator's action, as captured by the U1 13. the<br>
supervisory HCP control module 5 and one or more of the other control<br>
modules determine requested output torque, T1, at shaft 64, also referred to as<br>
an operator torque request. Selectively operated components of the<br>
transmission 10 are appropriately controlled and manipulated to respond to the<br>
operator demand. For example, in the exemplary embodiment depicted in<br>
Fig 1 and 2. when the operator has selected a forward drive range and<br>
manipulates either the accelerator pedal or the brake pedal, the HCP 5<br>
determines output torque, TV,, which affects how and when the vehicle<br>
accelerates or decelerates. Final vehicle acceleration is affected by other<br>
factors, including, e.g., road load, road grade, and vehicle mass. The HCP 5<br>
monitors the parametric states of the torque-generative devices, and<br>
determines the output of the transmission required to arrive at the desired<br><br>
GP-307817-PTH-CD<br>
11<br>
torque output. Under the direction of the HCP 5, the transmission 10 operates<br>
over a range of output speeds from slow to fast in order to meet the operator<br>
demand.<br>
[0031]    The  two-mode,   compound-split,  electro-mechanical   transmission,<br>
includes output member 64 which receives output torque through two distinct<br>
gear trains within the transmission 10, and operates in several transmission<br>
operating modes, described with reference now to Fig. 1, and Table 1, below.<br>
Table 1<br><br>
Transmission Operating Mode	Actuated	Clutches	<br>
Mode I		Cl   70		<br>
Fixed Ratio	1  (GR1)	Cl  70	C4	75<br>
Fixed Ratio	2 (GR2)	Cl   70	C2	62<br>
Mode 11		C2 62		<br>
Fixed Ratio	3 (GR3)	C2 62	C4	75<br>
Fixed Ratio	4(GR4)	C2 62	C3	73<br>
[0032] The various transmission operating modes described in the table<br>
indicate which of the specific clutches Cl, C2, C3 and C4 are engaged or<br>
actuated for each of the operating modes. Additionally, in various<br>
transmission operating modes. MG-A and MG-B may each operate as<br>
electrical motors to generate motive torque, or as a generator to generate<br>
electrical energy.<br>
[0033] The control system, depicted primarily in Fig. 2, is operable to<br>
provide a range of transmission output speeds. N,,. of shaft 64 from relatively<br>
slow to relatively fast within each mode of operation. The combination of two<br>
continuously variable modes with a slow-to-fast output speed range in each<br>
mode allows the transmission 10 to propel a vehicle from a stationary<br>
condition to highway speeds, and meet various other requirements as<br>
previously described. Additionally, the control system coordinates operation<br>
of the transmission 10 so as to allow synchronized shifts between the modes<br><br>
GP-307817-PTH-CD<br>
12<br>
[0034] The first and second modes of operation refer to circumstances in<br>
which the transmission functions are controlled by one clutch, i.e., either<br>
clulch Cl 62 or C2 70, and by the controlled speed and torque of the electrical<br>
machines 56 and 72, referred to as a continuously variable transmission mode.<br>
Certain ranges of operation are described below in which fixed ratios are<br>
achieved by applying an additional clutch. This additional clutch may be<br>
clutch C3 73 or C4 75, as depicted in Table 1, above.<br>
[0035] When the additional clutch is applied, fixed ratio operation of input-<br>
to-output speed of the transmission, i.e., N1,N1,-,, is achieved. The rotations of<br>
machines MG-A and MG-B 56, 72 are dependent on internal rotation of the<br>
mechanism as defined by the clutching and proportional to the input speed, N:,<br>
determined or measured at shaft 12. The machines MG-A and MG-B function<br>
as motors or generators. They are completely independent of engine to output<br>
power flow, thereby enabling both to be motors, both to function as<br>
generators, or any combination thereof This allows, for instance, during<br>
operation in Fixed Ratio I that motive power output from the transmission at<br>
shaft 64 is provided by power from the engine and power from MG-A and<br>
MG-B, through planetary gear set 28 by accepting power from the energy<br>
storage device 74.<br>
[0036] Referring now to Fig. 3, various transmission operating modes are<br>
plotted as a function of transmission output speed, N,, and transmission input<br>
speed, N1 for the exemplary transmission and control system depicted in Fig. 1<br>
and 2 The Fixed Ratio operating operation is depicted as individual lines for<br>
each of the specific gear ratios. GR1, GR2, GR3, and GR4. as described with<br>
reference to Table 1, above. The continuously variable Mode operation is<br>
depicted as ranges of operation for each of Mode I and Mode 11. The<br>
transmission operating mode is switched between Fixed Ratio operation and<br>
continuously variable Mode operation by activating or deactivating specific<br>
clutches   The control system is operative to determine a specific transmission<br><br>

13<br>
operating mode based upon various criteria, using algorithms and calibrations<br>
executed by the control system, and is outside the scope of this invention<br>
[00371 Selection of the transmission operating mode depends primarily on<br>
operator input and the ability of the powertrain to meet that input The first<br>
fixed gear ratio, GR1, is available during continuously variable mode i. when<br>
clutches Cl and C4 are engaged. The second fixed gear ratio, GR2, is<br>
available during mode I, when clutches Cl and C2 are engaged. The third<br>
fixed ratio range, GR3 is available during continuously variable mode I, and<br>
during continuously variable mode 11 when clutches C2 62 and C4 75 are<br>
engaged, and the fourth fixed ratio range, GR4, is available during mode II<br>
when clutches C2 62 and C3 73 are engaged. It should be recognized that<br>
ranges of continuously variable operation for Mode 1 and Mode 11 may<br>
overlap.<br>
[0038] Output of the exemplary powertrain system described hereinabove is<br>
constrained due to mechanical and system limitations The output speed, N'o.<br>
of the transmission measured at shaft 64 is limited due to limitations of engine<br>
output speed measured at shaft 18, and transmission input speed, N , measured<br>
at shaft 12, and speed limitations of machines MG-A and MG-B. Output<br>
torque, T0,,, of the transmission 64 is similarly limited due to limitations of the<br>
input torque, T1,, measured at shaft 12 after a transient torque damper and<br>
torque limitations of MG-A and MG-B 56, 72.<br>
[0039] Referring again to Fig. 4, a schematic diagram is depicted which<br>
provides a more detailed description of the exemplary electro-hydraulic<br>
system for controlling flow of hydraulic fluid in the exemplar}' transmission.<br>
As previously described with reference to Fig. I, the main hydraulic pump 88<br>
is driven by gears 82 and 84 that are operatively driven off the input shaft<br>
from the engine 10, The main hydraulic pump 88 receives input torque from<br>
the engine and pumps hydraulic fluid drawn from a sump into a hvdraulic<br>
circuit of the transmission, initially passing through control valve 140 The<br>
auxiliary' pump 1 10 is operatively controlled by an auxiliary operating pump<br><br>
GP-307817-PTH-CD<br>
14<br>
control module ('TAOP') (not shown), which is operatively controlled by the<br>
TP1M 19. The auxiliary pump 110 preferably comprises an electrically-<br>
powered pump of an appropriate size and capacity to provide sufficient flow<br>
of pressurized hydraulic fluid into the hydraulic system when operational. The<br>
TPIM preferably generates a pulse-width-modulated signal of fixed frequency<br>
and a duty cycle which varies from a low value to high value to drive the<br>
pump 1 10, the duty cycle depending upon the desired output from the pump<br>
The pump 1 10 receives the signal and pumps hydraulic fluid drawn from the<br>
sump into the hydraulic circuit which flows to fluid control valve 140.<br>
[0040] Pressurized hydraulic fluid flows into electro-hydraulic control circuit<br>
42, which is operable to selectively distribute hydraulic pressure to a series of<br>
devices, including the torque-transfer clutches Cl 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4<br>
75, active cooling circuits for machines MG-A and MG-B, and a base cooling<br>
circuit for cooling and lubricating the transmission 10 via passages 142, 144<br>
(not depicted in detail). As previously stated, the TCM 17 is preferably<br>
operable to actuate the various clutches to achieve various transmission<br>
operating modes through selective actuation of hydraulic circuit flow control<br>
devices comprising pressure control solenoids ("PCS") PCS] 108, PCS2 112.<br>
PC S3 114, PCS4 116 and solenoid-controlled flow management valves X-<br>
valve 118 and Y-valve 120. The circuit is fluidly connected to pressure<br>
switches PS1, PS2. PS3, and PS4 via passages 124, 122, 126, and 128,<br>
respectively. The pressure control solenoid PCS I 108 has a control position<br>
of normally high and is operative to provide modulation of fluidic pressure in<br>
the hydraulic circuit through fluidic interaction with pressure regulator 109<br>
Pressure control solenoid PCS2 112 has a control position of normally low.<br>
and is fluidly connected to spool valve 113 and operative to effect flow<br>
therethrough when actuated. Spool valve 1 13 is fluidly connected to pressure<br>
switch PS3 via passage 126. Pressure control solenoid PCS3 114 has a control<br>
position of normally low, and is fluidly connected to spool valve 115 and<br>
operative to effect flow therethrough when actuated.    Spool valve  115 is<br><br>

fluidly connected to pressure switch PS1 via passage 124. Pressure control<br>
solenoid PCS4 116 has a control position of normally low, and is fluidly<br>
connected to spool valve 117 and operative to effect How therethrough when<br>
actuated. Spool valve 117 is fluidly connected to pressure switch PS4 via<br>
passage 128.<br>
[0041] The X-Valve 119 and Y-Valve 121 comprise flow management<br>
valves controlled by shift solenoids 1 18, 120, respectively, in the exemplary<br>
system, and have control states of High (' 1') and Low ('0'). The control states<br>
reference positions of each valve effecting flow control to different devices in<br>
the hydraulic circuit 42 and the transmission 10. The X-valve 1 19 is operative<br>
to direct pressurized fluid to clutches C3 and C4 and cooling systems for<br>
stators of MG-A and MG-B via fluidic passages 136, 138, 144, 142<br>
respectively, depending upon the source of the fluidic input, as is described<br>
hereinafter. The Y-valve 121 is operative to direct pressurized fluid to<br>
clutches Cl and C2 via tluidic passages 132 and 134 respectively, depending<br>
upon the source of the fluidic input, as is described hereinafter The Y-valve<br>
121 is fluidly connected to pressure switch PS2 via passage 122. Selective<br>
control of the X- and Y-valves and actuation of the solenoids PCS2, PCS3.<br>
and PCS4 facilitate flow of hydraulic fluid to actuate clutches C 1, C2, C3, and<br>
C4, and provide cooling for the stators of MG-A and MG-B.<br>
[0042] The TCM 17 is preferably operable to actuate various clutches to<br>
achieve various transmission operating states through selective actuation of<br>
the pressure control solenoids and shift solenoids. An exemplary logic table to<br>
accomplish such control using the electro-hydraulic control circuit 42 is<br>

|0044[ In operation, a shift occurs in the exemplary transmission due to a<br>
variety of operating characteristics of the powertrain. There may be a change<br>
in demand for an operator demand for torque. Such demands are typically<br>
communicated through inputs to the UI 13 as previously described.<br>
Additionally, a change in demand for output torque may be predicated on a<br>
change in external conditions, including, e.g., changes in road grade, road<br>
surface conditions, or wind load. A shift change may be predicated on a<br>
change in powertrain torque demand caused by a control module command to<br>
change one of the electrical machines between electrical energy generating<br>
mode and torque generating mode. A shift change may be predicated on a<br>
change in an optimization algorithm or routine operable to determine optimum<br>
system efficiency based upon operator demand for power, batter)-' state of<br>
charge, and energy efficiencies of the engine 14 and MG-A and MG-B 56, 72.<br>
The control system manages torque inputs from the engine 14 and MG-A and<br>
MG-B 56, 72 based upon an outcome of the executed optimization routine,<br>
and there can be changes in system optimization that compel a shift change in<br>
order to optimize system efficiencies to improve fuel economy and manage<br>
battery charging. Furthermore, a shift change may be predicated upon a fault<br>
in a component or system. The distributed control module architecture acts in<br>
concert to determine a need for a change in the transmission operating mode,<br>
and executes the forgoing to effect the change. A shift change in the<br>
exemplary system comprises one of at least four possible situations There<br>
can be a shift from one fixed gear to a second fixed gear There can be a shift<br>
from a fixed gear to one of the continuously variable modes. There can be a<br>
shift from one of the continuously variable modes to a fixed gear. There can<br>
be a shift from one of the continuously variable modes to the other<br>
continuously variable mode.<br><br>

|0045) Referring now to Fig. 5, a logic flow chart provides a description of<br>
operation of the invention, executed in the exemplary system described with<br>
reference to Figs 1 - 4. The invention generally comprises an algorithm<br>
resident in one of the control modules and executed therein, which acts to<br>
implement a method to effect a shift from a first operating mode to a second<br>
operating mode, based upon criteria previously described. As an introduction,<br>
when a shift is executed from one fixed gear to a second fixed gear, the shift<br>
process includes deactivating an off-going ('(XV) clutch, and actuating an<br>
oncoming clutch. By way of example, in shifting from GR1 to GR2, off-going<br>
clutch C4 75 is deactivated, and oncoming clutch C2 62 is actuated, permitting<br>
it to transmit torque. Clutch Cl 70 remains actuated throughout the shift<br>
process. Actuating the oncoming clutch preferably includes synchronizing the<br>
speeds of the elements of the oncoming clutch by controlling operation of the<br>
torque-generative devices and, if necessary, controlling slippage of the<br>
oncoming clutch, A shift change out of any of the fixed gear operating modes<br>
preferably comprises a process wherein torque transmitted across the off-<br>
going clutch is offloaded prior to its deactivation. Offloading torque across<br>
the off-going clutch includes adjusting torque-carrying capacity across other<br>
torque-transmission paths, e.g., using MG-A, MG-B, and the oncoming clutch.<br>
Deactivating an off-going clutch preferably comprises decreasing the torque-<br>
carrying capacity of the off-going clutch by reducing hydraulic pressure<br>
through control of one of the solenoids, as previously described.<br>
[0046] Referring again to Fig. 5, a command to execute a shift out a fixed<br>
gear is issued (Block 200). Torque is off-loaded from the off-going COG1)<br>
clutch. The OG clutch is deactivated (Block 202) by selectively controlling<br>
elements in the electro-hydraulic control circuit 42, including reducing flow of<br>
pressurized hydraulic fluid to the OG clutch. The control system imposes<br>
limits on change in torque outputs (TA, T,A) and absolute torque outputs (TA<br>
TH) from the electric machines MG-A and MG-B (Block 204).   Input speed.<br><br>
GP-307817-PTH-CD<br>
19<br>
K, and output speed, K, are monitored, preferably using known sensing<br>
devices (Block 206).<br>
[0047] Clutch slip is characterized in terms of speed and elapsed time,<br>
wherein the parametric value for input speed. N,, is compared to the<br>
parametric value for the output speed, N,-. multiplied by the gear ratio of the<br>
off-going gear (' GR_OG__Gear'), represented as N1 - [N1, * GR OG_Gear ]<br>
Clutch slip is monitored (Block 208), and compared to a threshold difference,<br>
Slip Thr. When the clutch slip exceeds the threshold difference. Slip Thr<br>
and does so for an elapsed time greater than a first threshold time<br>
(TimeThr 1') (Block 210), the imposed limits on change in torque output<br>
and absolute torque output from the electric machines MG-A and MG-B are<br>
discontinued (Block 212), and shift execution continues (Block 214). When<br>
clutch slip does not exceed the slip threshold, Slip_Thr, and does not exceed<br>
the slip threshold for an elapsed time greater than a second threshold time<br>
(Time_Thrjn (Block 220), a fault is detected (Block 222). and the control<br>
system undertakes remedial action (Block 224).<br>
[0048] The control system-imposed limits on the change in torque outputs<br>
(AT.,, T13) and absolute torque outputs (TA, T,,) from the electric machines<br>
MG-A and MG-B (depicted in Block 204) preferably comprise torque values<br>
dynamically determined in the control system based upon the operating<br>
conditions of the powertrain at the time of the shift execution. The intent in<br>
programming the control system to dynamically determine imposed limits is to<br>
have limits which minimize effect on torque output to the driveline, including<br>
occurrence of jerks and other unanticipated changes in vehicle torque. The<br>
elapsed time threshold. Time Thr 2, is calibrated at a magnitude which<br>
minimizes risk of unintended torque, and is preferably in the range of 50<br>
milliseconds for the exemplary embodiment.<br><br>
GP-307817-PTH-CD<br>
20<br>
[0049] When, during shift execution, the clutch slip of the OG clutch does<br>
not exceed the slip threshold after the elapsed time period, the control system<br>
executes remedial actions (Block 224). The remedial actions preferably<br>
include actions comprising controlling clutch actuation and managing torque<br>
outputs of the engine 14 and the electrical machines MG-A and MG-B. 56. 72.<br>
The intent of the control scheme is to continue to meet the operator demand<br>
for torque while preventing harm to the powertrain hardware. The remedial<br>
action can comprise executing a revised shift operation, e.g., into a third<br>
operating mode, to substantially meet the operator request for output torque.<br>
The third operating mode comprises, for example, shifting into a permissible<br>
transmission operating mode and adjusting torque inputs from the engine and<br>
the electrical machines. Other remedial actions can include informing the<br>
operator of the presence of a fault through illuminating a lamp on the vehicle<br>
dashboard, and executing some form of 'limp-home1 operation, each which is<br>
outside the scope of the invention.<br>
[0050] The invention has been described with specific reference to the<br>
embodiments and modifications thereto. Further modifications and alterations<br>
may occur to others upon reading and understanding the specification. It is<br>
intended to include all such modifications and alterations insofar as they come<br>
within the scope of the invention.<br><br>
