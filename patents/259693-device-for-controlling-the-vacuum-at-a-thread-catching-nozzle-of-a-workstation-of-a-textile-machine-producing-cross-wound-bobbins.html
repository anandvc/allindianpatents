PATENTS ACT 1977<br>
I, ASTRID TERRY, translator of 11, Bounds Oak Way, Tunbridge Wells, Kent. TN4 OUB, England, confirm that I am conversant with the English and German languages and I am a competent translator from one to the other. I declare that to the best of my knowledge and belief that the attached English translation is a true and correct translation of the Patent No. DE 10 2005 001 093.8 in the name of Saurer GmbH &amp; Co. KG<br><br><br>
Dated this     13th	day of   October	2005.<br><br>
Description<br>
The invention relates to a device according to the preamble of claim 1.<br>
The workstations of textile machines producing cross-wound bobbins, for example automatic cross-winding machines, have various thread treating or thread handling mechanisms.<br>
With the aid of these mechanisms, a plurality of feed bobbins, which are generally present in the form of relatively small-volume spinning cops, can be rewound into a cross-wound bobbin having substantially more yarn material. During the rewinding process, the thread is simultaneously monitored for possible thread faults, which are optionally cut out and replaced by thread splices of virtually identical yarn.<br>
For this purpose, the individual workstations of these textile machines have, for example, a winding device, which comprises a creel for the rotatable holding of a wind-on bobbin, a bobbin drive roller and a thread cross-winding mechanism. Moreover, workstations of this type generally have a respective under-thread sensor, a thread tightener, a thread cleaner with a thread cutting mechanism, a thread tensile force sensor, a thread catching nozzle and a waxing mechanism.<br>
To splice broken threads or threads severed in a controlled manner by a cleaner cut, workstations of this type are also equipped with a thread connecting mechanism, a suction tube and a gripper tube. The suction tube and the gripper tube are connected in this case to a vacuum cross beam specific to the machine and if necessary transport, as known, the thread ends<br>
2<br><br>
retrieved from the cross-wound bobbin or the feed bobbin to the thread connecting mechanism.<br>
Furthermore, a thread catching nozzle connected to a vacuum cross beam and directed toward the running thread is arranged in the region of the waxing mechanism. This thread catching nozzle improves the quality of the cross-wound bobbin in that it constantly sucks dust and particles of dirt from the thread during the winding process. Moreover, the thread catching nozzle has the object of immediately sucking in the thread end in the event that a thread breaks and therefore preventing the occurrence of a so-called drum wind lap.<br>
During the splicing process following a thread breakage or a thread cut, the thread catching nozzle should not be subjected to a vacuum, however, as otherwise there is the risk of one of the threads retrieved by the suction tube or the gripper tube and brought into the region of the thread connecting mechanism and still under relatively little tension being sucked inadvertently into the thread catching nozzle.<br>
It is already known in this connection and described, for example, in DE 195 28 462 B4, to arrange, in the region of the mouth of the thread catching nozzle, a pivotally mounted flap which is moved in front of the mouth of the thread catching nozzle during the splicing process.<br>
However, in this known device it is advantageous that, to actuate the flap, a relatively complex actuating mechanism is required.<br>
Starting from the above-mentioned prior art, the invention is based on  the  object  of developing  a  device  which makes<br>
3<br><br>
possible economical and maintenance-free activation of a thread catching nozzle.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention by a device, as described in claim 1.<br>
Advantageous configurations of the invention are the subject of the sub-claims.<br>
The device according to the invention is distinguished by a simple, uncomplicated structure and does not only operate reliably, but also very largely maintenance-free. The thread catching nozzle is connected to a vacuum cross beam subjected to a vacuum and specific to the machine, via an air guide, which has a connection piece for the thread catching nozzle and a closable relief connection. It is thus ensured, on the one hand, with the air guide according to the invention, that there is always a vacuum during the winding process at the mouth of the thread catching nozzle and therefore the thread catching nozzle is constantly in operation, and in that, on the other hand, when the suction tube of the winding head is pivoted into the region of the cross-wound bobbins during a winding interruption to retrieve the upper thread, the thread catching nozzle is automatically taken out of operation by release of the relief connection.<br>
As described in claim 2, the relief connection of the air guide has a considerably greater clear cross-section for this purpose than the connection piece for the thread catching nozzle. A configuration of this type results in the fact that during the regular winding process, a relatively large vacuum is effective in the connection piece and therefore also at the mouth of the thread catching nozzle and this has a positive<br>
4<br><br>
effect on the cleaning of the running thread. Nevertheless, as soon as the relief connection is released, the vacuum in the connection piece immediately drops sharply or the vacuum in the connection piece breaks down virtually completely. The thread catching nozzle is therefore practically taken out of operation.<br>
As described in claims 3 and 4, the relief connection is closed during the regular winding process by the pivotally mounted suction tube of the workstation. The mouth of the relief connection is adapted for this purpose to the shape of the suction tube in such a way that the suction tube closes the relief connection in a virtually air-tight manner in its standby position.<br>
The invention will be described in more detail hereinafter with the aid of the embodiment shown in the drawings. In the drawings:<br>
Fig. 1 shows a lateral view of a workstation of a textile machine producing cross-wound bobbins, comprising a thread catching nozzle connected to a vacuum cross beam via an air guide, during the winding operation,<br>
Fig. 2 shows the state of the workstation according to Fig. 1, in particular the thread catching nozzle, during a winding interruption,<br>
Fig. 3 shows a lateral view of the air guide according to the invention, on an enlarged scale,<br>
Fig. 4 shows the air guide according to Fig. 3 in a front view,<br>
5<br><br>
Fig. 5 shows a section of the air guide according to Fig. 3.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a schematic lateral view of a textile machine producing cross-wound bobbins, a so-called automatic cross-winding machine 1 in the embodiment. Automatic cross-winding machines 1 of this type have a plurality of similar workstations 2 between their end frames (not shown). As known and therefore not described in more detail, the spinning cops 9 having only relatively little yarn material and produced on a ring spinning machine (not shown) are rewound to form large-volume cross-wound bobbins 11 at these workstations 2. The finished cross-wound bobbins 11 are then transferred by means of an automatically operating service unit, for example a cross-wound bobbin changer, to a machine-length cross-wound bobbin transporting mechanism 1 and transported to a bobbin loading station or the like arranged at the end of the machine.<br>
Generally, such automatic cross-winding machines 1 also have a logistics mechanism in the form of a bobbin and tube transporting system 3.<br>
In this bobbin and tube transporting system 3, spinning cops 9 or empty tubes 34 circulate on transporting plates 8. Of this tube transporting system 3, Figs. 1 and 2 only show the cop feed section 4, the storage section 5, which can be driven in a reciprocating manner, one of the transverse transporting sections 6 leading to the winding heads 2 and the tube return section 7. As indicated, the spinning cops 9 supplied are initially positioned and rewound in an unwinding station 10, which is located in the region of the transverse transporting sections 6 at the winding heads 2.  For this purpose,  the<br>
6<br><br>
individual workstations 2, as known and therefore only indicated, have various thread treating and thread handling mechanisms, which not only ensure that the spinning cops 9 can be rewound to form large-volume cross-wound bobbins 11, but also ensure that the thread 30 is monitored during the rewinding process and thread faults detected are cleaned out.<br>
One of these mechanisms, known per se, is the winding device, which is characterised as a whole by the reference numeral 24, and which has, in each case, a creel 18, which is movably mounted about a pivot axis 19, a bobbin drive mechanism 26 and a thread cross-winding mechanism 28.<br>
In the embodiment shown in Fig. 1, the cross-wound bobbin 11 is located during the winding process, for example, with its surface on a drive drum 26 and is entrained thereby by friction locking. The drive drum 26 is driven here, as is known per se, via a speed-controllable, reciprocating drive mechanism (not shown).<br>
The cross-winding of the thread 30 when winding onto the cross-wound bobbin 11 takes place by means of a thread cross-winding mechanism 28, which has a finger thread guide 2 9 in the present embodiment. Thread cross-winding devices of this type are known and described in detail, for example in DE 198 58 548 Al.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the thread cross-winding mechanism 28 can obviously also be configured as a thread guide drum. As known, such thread guide drums traverse' the thread 30 between the end faces of the cross-wound bobbin 11 and simultaneously drive the cross-wound bobbin 11 in a frictionally engaged manner via its surface.<br>
7<br><br>
As already indicated at the outset in the introduction to the description, workstations 2 of this type also have a thread connecting mechanism 13, preferably a splicing mechanism operating pneumatically, a suction tube 12 which can be subjected to a vacuum and a gripper tube 25 which can also be subjected to a vacuum. The suction tube 12 and the gripper tube 25 are connected in this case to a vacuum cross beam 32 specific to the machine, which is in turn connected to a vacuum source 33.<br>
The workstations 2 generally also have an under-thread sensor 22, a thread tightening mechanism 14, a thread cleaner 15 with a thread cutting mechanism 17, a thread tensile force sensor 20 and a waxing mechanism 16.<br>
A thread catching device 23, which is also connected to the vacuum cross beam 32 via an air guide 27 is also positioned in the region of the waxing mechanism 16. The air guide 27 in this case has a connection piece 35 for the thread catching nozzle 23 and a relief connection 36, which is closed during the regular winding operation by the suction tube 12.<br>
As can be seen from Fig. 3 to 5, the air guide 27 has two lateral flanges 37, via which it can be fixed by means of screw bolts 38 or the like to the vacuum cross beam 32 and thus covers a connection opening 39 in the vacuum cross beam 32. The air guide 27 also has a connection piece 35, which is connected, for example, via a hose to the thread catching nozzle 23, and a relief connection 3 6 which can be closed by the suction tube 12. As indicated in Fig. 4, the clear cross-section A2 of the relief connection 36 is significantly larger than the clear cross-section Ai of the connection piece 35.<br>
8<br><br>
Functioning of the device according to the invention:<br>
As indicated in Fig. 1, during the winding process, a spinning cop 9 arranged on a transporting plate 8 is positioned in the region of one of. the transverse transporting sections 6 in an unwinding position 10. The thread 30 running off the spinning cop 9 crosses, on its way to the cross-wound bobbin 11, inter alia an under-thread sensor 22, a thread tightener 14, a thread cleaner 15 with a thread cutting mechanism 17 and a waxing mechanism 16.<br>
The tensile force of the thread of the thread 30 running onto the cross-wound bobbin 11 by means of a thread cross-winding mechanism 28 in crossing layers is monitored in this case by a thread tensile force sensor 20. Furthermore, a thread catching nozzle 23 subjected to a vacuum and arranged in the region of the waxing mechanism 16 with a small spacing from the thread running path constantly subjects the running thread 30 to suction and thus removes dirt and dust particles.<br>
When a winding interruption occurs at one of the workstations 2, for example as a result of a thread break or a controlled cleaner cut, the so-called upper thread connected to the cross-wound bobbin 11 initially runs onto the cross-wound bobbin which is braked by a corresponding bobbin brake to a standstill. The so-called under-thread connected to the spinning cop 9 generally remains fixed in the thread tightener 14 and/or the thread catching nozzle 23 and can then be retrieved via the gripper tube 25 which is subjected to a vacuum and transported in the direction of the thread connecting mechanism 13. At virtually the same time, the suction tube 12 also retrieves the upper thread from the<br>
9<br><br>
cross-wound bobbin 11 and inserts it, as known, into the splicing channel of the thread connecting mechanism 13.<br>
This means that in the case of a winding interruption, the suction tube 12 pivots upwardly out of its rest position shown in Fig. 1, in which it closes the relief connection 36 of the air guide 27 in an air-tight manner, in the direction of the cross-wound bobbin 11 and thus releases the relief connection 36. This release of the relief connection 36 immediately leads, inside the air guide 27, to a clear change in the pressure and flow conditions.<br>
In other words, the vacuum previously at the connection piece 35 and therefore at the mouth of the thread catching nozzle 23 virtually breaks down completely. The thread catching nozzle 23 is therefore practically out of operation.<br>
The still slightly tightened upper or under threads, grasped by the suction tube 12 or gripper tube 25 can now be handled without problems, without the risk of a thread being sucked into the thread catching nozzle 23.<br>
As soon as the threads are reliably fixed in the splicing device, the suction tube 12 returns to its rest position and thus closes the relief connection 36 again. In other words, the vacuum in the vacuum cross beam 32 is fully effective again via the connection piece 35 and cleans, as desired, the running thread 30.<br>
