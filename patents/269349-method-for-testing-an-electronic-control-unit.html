				<td>Method for Testing an Electronic Control Unit<br>
The invention concerns a method for testing at least one electronic control system, in which the<br>
control system is connected via a data channel to a test device, at least one environment model is<br>
calculated on the test device, and the environment model interacts with the control system by<br>
output of environment model data via the test device to the control system and by receiving<br>
control system data from the control system via the data channel. Moreover, the invention<br>
concerns a scheduling method for execution of at least one test model on a simulation computer,<br>
in which a first scheduler is activated based on an external activation signal. Finally, the<br>
invention also concerns a test device for testing of at least one electronic control system, in<br>
which the test device can be connected via a data channel to the control system, at least one<br>
environment model is calculated with the test device and the environment model can interact<br>
with the control system by output of environment model data to the control system and by<br>
receiving control system data from the control system via the data channel.<br>
Methods and devices for testing electronic control systems are known in different forms from<br>
practice and are mostly used in applied research and industrial development in the broad field of<br>
development and use of electronic control systems, namely, anywhere process control tasks in<br>
the broadest sense must be solved. The term "control system" is used below as an encompassing<br>
designation for a technical device that is essentially used for the tasks of measurement, control,<br>
regulation, calibration. In the broadest sense, an electronic, program-controllable system is<br>
involved, which is usually called a control device in automotive applications. The term "control<br>
system" is not restricted to that which is narrowly defined in systems theory as control, in which<br>
controls are ordinarily implemented on control systems.<br>
The development of a control system that is ultimately usable in series production is generally<br>
accomplished in the following steps: during function development, by means of mathematical<br>
modeling tools, an abstract controller prototype is initially made from the later target hardware<br><br>
--2--<br>
and environment, during which the controller so developed is only tested in a simulation with the<br>
process image, which also only exists as a mathematical model.<br>
In the next step, in the so-called rapid control prototyping (RCP), the abstract controller<br>
prototype is converted by means of code generators to an executable program, which is operated<br>
on a usually very high-performance, real-time-capable control system, not comparable to the<br>
series control system ultimately to be used. This RCP control system then interacts via<br>
corresponding I/O interfaces with the real process being influenced. If these results are<br>
satisfactory, executable code for the series control system is again generated via correspondingly<br>
equipped code generators from the mathematical model of the controller, so that the control<br>
system actually to be used in series application can be equipped with the functionality, with<br>
which it must also be equipped in series application.<br>
However, before the series control system is tested in conjunction with the real process, it is<br>
subjected to thorough tests, so-called hardware-in-the-loop-tests (HIL tests). During HIL tests,<br>
the (series) control system is connected to a test device, in which the functional environment of<br>
the control system being tested is simulated by means of an environment model; the control<br>
system therefore interacts with a virtual environment, in which the environment model is<br>
connected to the test device by output of environment data via the test device to the control<br>
system and by receiving control system data from the control system via a data channel.<br>
The present invention is explained on the example of such an HIL test, but is not restricted<br>
conceptually to such a test situation, but instead is applicable to testing of any control system that<br>
is connected to a test device and is tested by means of an environment model that is operated on<br>
the test device.<br>
The control system, for example, can be an engine device in the area of automotive applications,<br>
in which the environment model of this engine control device is then an engine model, operated<br>
in real time on the test device. However, it can also be a running and engine dynamic model of<br>
an entire vehicle moved in a virtual environment. The environment model, in principle, need not<br>
cover all the interfaces of the control system being tested, but instead any parts of the<br><br>
--3--<br>
environment can also be implemented by real components. In the preceding example, this could<br>
mean that the control system being tested is actually connected to a real internal combustion<br>
engine in which the environment of the engine (for example, transmission, drive train, chassis<br>
and road) is simulated by means of an environment model operated on the test device. The<br>
environment model therefore need not be a complete environment model, and it can be directly<br>
and/or indirectly connected to the control system being tested.<br>
The actual test of the control system consists of deliberately influencing the environment model<br>
of the control system, namely, by a test model to influence the environment model. Such<br>
deliberate influencing, for example, during testing of a control system for brake systems, can lie<br>
in the fact that the parameters that describe the ground are varied over broad limits and the brake<br>
control system is brought to complete braking. To evaluate the control system, the behavior of<br>
the environment mode] is generally used, which, in the preceding example, could lie in<br>
determination of the delay of the entire system (i.e., the vehicle). It is also quite possible to also<br>
read out direct variables of state from the control system and use them to evaluate the control<br>
system.<br>
Different methods and devices are known from the prior art that permit testing of control systems<br>
in the aforementioned sense. For example, it is known, for influencing the test device on which<br>
the environment model is operated, to provide an additional experimentation device next to the<br>
test device, which is connected to the test device. A test model is run on the experimentation<br>
device (generally a standard PC), which influences the environment model on the test device in<br>
the desired manner via a data connection between the experimentation device and the test device.<br>
The experimentation device then permits the test model to be designed with a graphic modeling<br>
environment, in which, depending on time and depending on the model quantities of the<br>
environment model, a specific test functionality can be stipulated (dSPACE GmbH: "Automation<br>
Desk: Test and Experiment Software"; Product description, February 2006). The drawback in<br>
this procedure is that strict synchronization between the environment model on the test device<br>
and the test model on the experimentation device cannot be guaranteed, since coupling between<br>
the two devices is connected with the dead times related to communication. In addition, during<br>
use of a standard operating system without real-time capability on the experimentation device,<br><br>
--4--<br>
under some circumstances, strict real-time capability is not guaranteed. This means that an<br>
influence on the environment model planned in a certain calculation interval of the environment<br>
model cannot always occur in this calculation interval, which could load to incorrect<br>
performance and incorrect interpretation of the test.<br>
Real-time capability, in the sense of the present invention, means that processes, whose<br>
execution is prescribed and stipulated at a specified time, must be executed and accomplished<br>
strictly at this time. The question of real-time capability is therefore not connected to an absolute<br>
speed dimension for a calculation, but is only bound to fulfillment of the condition that actions<br>
planned within a time interval can also be executed within this time interval; real-time capability<br>
is consequently not necessarily the fastest possible execution of required actions, but reliable<br>
execution of these actions within the time prescribed for them.<br>
In time-discrete systems that are operated with a certain (generally fixed) calculation and<br>
scanning frequency, the shortest time unit corresponds to the length of the (fixed) scanning<br>
interval with the control system. If a control system, for example, is scanned and calculated with<br>
a millisecond, the environment model is ordinarily also operated at least with this scanning rate.<br>
This means that the model quantities of the environment model (i.e., the quantities of state of the<br>
environment model in terms of systems theory) are calculated with a frequency of 1 kHz, and the<br>
output quantities of the environment model are also calculated with a frequency of 1 kHz and are<br>
output to influence the control system.<br>
All actions that are executed within a scanning or calculation interval (in the present example,<br>
within a millisecond) take place simultaneously for the time-discrete scanning system; these<br>
actions cannot be distinguished from each other in time. Starting from this definition of real-time<br>
capability and simultaneity, it is therefore possible to carry out several actions simultaneously,<br>
even if an electronic control system or test device that can process instructions only strictly<br>
sequentially is used, if they are executed in the same scanning or calculation interval.<br>
The advantage of the test method just described consists of the fact that, for execution of the tests,<br>
the environment model need not be stopped or changed, in which real-time conditions, however,<br><br>
--5--<br>
cannot be reliably maintained at small scanning rates, since the usual experimentation devices,<br>
based on an operating system without real-time capability, cannot guarantee predictable<br>
executions in terms of time.<br>
In another method for testing an electronic control system known from the prior art the<br>
environment model is instrumented by call-up of test functions. The environment model is<br>
consequently no longer independent of the test being performed and must therefore always be<br>
adapted when the test is changed. A shortcoming in this method is that the test model and the<br>
environment model are functionally dependent on each other, since the environment model must<br>
be instrumented with special function call-ups concerning the test model (OPAL-RT<br>
TECHNOLOGIES INC.: "RT-LAB, Product Description, Feature Details, Typical<br>
Applications"; 2005). This creates a significant overhead within the environment model and<br>
therefore leads to significant running time drawbacks under some circumstances, even if the<br>
functionality of the test model is a "null functionality."<br>
The underlying task of the invention is therefore to provide a method and device for testing of an<br>
electronic control system, in which the aforementioned drawbacks are at least partially avoided.<br>
The aforementioned task is solved according to the invention according to a first teaching of the<br>
invention in a method for testing at least one electronic control system with a test device and an<br>
environment model calculated on the test device, in which the control system is connected via a<br>
data channel to the test device and the environment model interacts with the control system by<br>
output of environment model data via the test device to the control system and by receiving<br>
control system data from the control system via the data channel, in that at least one test model to<br>
influence the environment model and/or calculate the environment model and/or electronic<br>
control system is executed on the test device, in which the test model or the test models is or are<br>
executed functionally independently of the environment model and synchronously with the<br>
environment model during test operation.<br>
The method according to the invention is advantageous in a number of respects relative to the<br>
methods known from the prior art. Owing to the fact that the test model is executed functionally<br><br>
--6--<br>
independently of the environment model, the environment model no longer need be instrumented<br>
with deliberately positioned function call-ups, with reference to the test model. On the one hand,<br>
this has the advantage that the environment model is universally applicable, independently of the<br>
test being performed, and, on the other hand, this procedure entails the advantage that unutilized<br>
function call-ups in the test model no longer burden the running time of the environment model.<br>
In addition, dead times and asynchronism between execution of the environment model and the<br>
test model are avoided in the method according to the invention relative to those methods, in<br>
which the environment model of the test device is influenced by a configuration device separate<br>
from it in terms of hardware, or by a test model operated on the configuration devices.<br>
In the first advantageous embodiment of the invention, the test model influences the environment<br>
model, in which, with knowledge of the memory locations of the environment quantities of the<br>
environment model, it describes and/or reads out these memory locations. By direct access of the<br>
test model to the model quantities of the environment model, a software interface between the<br>
two models can be dispensed with, which entails significant running time advantages.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the method according to the invention, a configuration<br>
device is connected to the test device via an additional data channel and the test model and/or<br>
environment model are then transferred via the additional data channel from the configuration<br>
device to the test device. By this embodiment of the method, it is also possible, with particular<br>
advantage, to create, modify or merely record the test model and/or environment model via the<br>
configuration device, which consists of a commercial PC with corresponding modeling software,<br>
in order to then transfer it deliberately to the test device. The configuration device in this<br>
embodiment of the invention is used as a user interface, via which the user has access to the<br>
target hardware, i.e., the test device.<br>
In another embodiment, the method according to the invention is characterized by the fact that<br>
the simultaneous execution of at least one of the performed test models is stopped in the running<br>
time of the environment model, so that an overall test, consisting of several test models, can be<br>
varied over a wide range. It is also prescribed in the method according to the invention that at<br>
least one test model (as a substitute or in addition) is also loaded during test operation on the test<br><br>
--7--<br>
device and executed there. Naturally, a test model already situated on the test device can likewise<br>
be executed at any time on the test device, regardless of whether the test model was loaded<br>
immediately beforehand on the test device, or whether the test model being started had already<br>
been present for a longer time on the test device.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of the method, the test model, if necessary, is executed in<br>
an operating mode asynchronous with the environment model, in order to then be executed<br>
synchronously with the environment model. This is particularly advantageous when the test<br>
model is started and extensive initializations must be conducted in the context of starting. Such<br>
initialization procedures can be so extensive, that they cannot be conducted within a scanning<br>
interval, so that a violation of the real-time requirements or the requirement for synchronism<br>
between the test model and environment model would be produced. In such a case, the method<br>
according to the invention proposes that the real-time and synchronism requirements be<br>
temporarily reset, until the calculation overhang is dealt with, to the extent that the test model<br>
can again be executed with the environment model synchronously and therefore guarantee the<br>
real-time requirements. Such a situation will occur, above all, when a test model is newly loaded<br>
onto the test device and is to be integrated in an already running test of the electronic control<br>
system.<br>
In another preferred practical example, the method according to the invention is configured, so<br>
that the test model is converted to an execution format that is executed on the test device by an<br>
interpreter. In a particularly preferred embodiment, this execution format exists in byte code,<br>
which is executed on the test device by a real-time interpreter. Execution of the machine-<br>
independent byte code by the interpreter is connected, in principle, with a time drawback, since<br>
the interpreter, which is often referred to as a virtual machine, cannot directly execute the byte<br>
code, but must translate it beforehand. For this reason, the real-time interpreter is preferably used<br>
in conjunction with an adjusted time compiler, which, at the beginning of the running time of the<br>
test model, translates the byte code once into a machine-dependent machine code. In particular, it<br>
is useful in this case to run the test model during the translation phase in an asynchronous mode<br>
relative to the environment model, as was already described on the example of initialization of a<br>
test model.<br><br>
--8--<br>
In another advantageous embodiment of the invention, for synchronization of the test model with<br>
the environment model, an activation signal to activate the test model is generated by the<br>
environment model. Generation of the activation signal by the environment model is consisted<br>
with the requirement of functional independence between the environment model and the test<br>
model, since no junction call-up directly concerning the test model occurs from the environment<br>
model, as is known from the prior art. The activation signal serves merely as a timer for<br>
execution of the test model, which, however, can be executed fully independently of the<br>
environment model.<br>
It is particularly prescribed that the activation signal is to be generated in each or each whole-<br>
number multiple of the calculation interval of the environment modal, so that the test model can<br>
also be calculated as a time-discrete scanning system. The activation signal is then generated by<br>
the environment model in a preferred embodiment, if it is ensured that the characteristic phases<br>
of the model calculation or handling are concluded. Such phases include, for example, recording<br>
of all input quantities of the environment model, calculation of the quantities of state of the<br>
environment model from the actual input quantities and from previous quantities of state of the<br>
environment model, or also output of output quantities from the environment model. By this<br>
handling of the method according to the invention, it is guaranteed that the environment model is<br>
situated in a time-consistent state and the test model, as a result of this, can access a consistent<br>
set of model quantities of the environment model.<br>
According to another advantageous embodiment of the method according to the invention, a<br>
scheduling method is activated by the activation signal, which coordinates execution of the test<br>
model. It is also apparent from this property that by activation, a functional decoupling between<br>
the environment model and the test model is guaranteed, since the test model is subsequently<br>
coordinated independently of the environment model by a higher-order coordination unit - the<br>
so-called scheduling method.<br>
A second teaching of the invention is geared toward the embodiment of the scheduling method,<br>
in which, based on an external activation signal, a scheduler is activated. The scheduling method<br><br>
--9--<br>
solves the aforementioned task according to the invention in that the first scheduler brings the<br>
test model to execution or part of the test model to execution, which corresponds to a stipulated<br>
calculation interval, and the first schedule after completion of execution of the test model or the<br>
stipulated part of the test model indicates termination of the calculation by a termination signal.<br>
In order for the first schedule to enter into action, an activation signal is required, which is<br>
formed, for example, by an interrupt. The first scheduler activated In this way can make<br>
execution of the test model or a stipulated part of the test model independent of other parameters.<br>
Thus, values can be transferred to the first scheduler by transfer parameters on call-up, or the<br>
scheduler on activation can read out corresponding parameters from the memory cells prescribed<br>
for this, which inform the first scheduler about which test model or parts of test models are to be<br>
calculated, and for which calculation interval these test models or parts of the test models are to<br>
be executed. Owing to the fact that the first scheduler, after complete execution of the test model<br>
or the stipulated part of the test model, indicates termination of calculation by termination signal,<br>
it is possible to react close in time with higher order or coordinated systems, like the<br>
environment model, in order to continue their course, for example.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the scheduling method according to the invention, the<br>
first scheduler, in a situation in which the test model has several test strings to be processed<br>
simultaneously, calls up a second scheduler, indicating the test strings to be simultaneously<br>
processed, whereupon the second scheduler causes successive execution of the test strings to be<br>
processed simultaneously and, after completion of all test strings to be processed simultaneously,<br>
indicates termination of execution to the first scheduler, whereupon the first scheduler indicates<br>
termination of calculation by a termination signal.<br>
The term simultaneity is to be interpreted precisely here as explained previously in conjunction<br>
with real-time simulations. All those processes that are processed within the stipulated smallest<br>
time resolution of the test device are considered simultaneous in the sense of the second<br>
teaching; consequently, the calculations, actually conducted one after the other in physical time,<br>
can also be interpreted as simultaneous according to the stated definition. There is no<br>
contradiction, to the extent that the second scheduler, responsible for processing the test strings<br><br>
--10--<br>
of a test model being processed simultaneously, causes the test strings being processed<br>
simultaneously to be executed in succession. The test strings being processed simultaneously<br>
within a test model can be simply the generation of two different test signals, with which a<br>
control system is to be acted upon.<br>
The scheduling method according to the invention experiences a particularly advantageous<br>
embodiment, in that the first scheduler, in a case, in which several test models or parts of several<br>
test models are to be calculated simultaneously, calls up a second scheduler assigned to each test<br>
model, so that only a second scheduler is always active, the corresponding active second<br>
scheduler indicates to the first scheduler termination of execution of the test model assigned to it,<br>
whereupon the first scheduler activates another (previously unactivated) second scheduler, until<br>
all test models or parts of test models have been calculated, whereupon the first scheduler<br>
indicates termination of calculation by a termination signal. The described method according to<br>
the invention is particularly clear and very simple to implement and permits checking of<br>
complete processing of several test models in particularly simple fashion. The different<br>
embodiments of the scheduling method according to the invention, with reference to treatment of<br>
several test strings to be processed simultaneously within a test model and with respect to<br>
simultaneous processing of several test models, can naturally be easily combined with each other.<br>
According to a last teaching of the invention, the task just mentioned, according to the invention,<br>
is solved in a test device for testing of at least one electronic control system, in that at least one<br>
test model is executed on the test device to influence the environment model and/or to calculate<br>
the environment model and/or the electronic control system, in which the test model can be<br>
executed functionally independently from the environment model and (during test operation)<br>
synchronously with the environment model.<br>
The test device according to the invention, in another preferred practical example, is configured,<br>
so that process steps can be executed with it that have been described within the context of this<br>
invention with respect to the test of at least one electronic control system.<br><br>

Fig. 1 shows the typical design of a test environment for testing of electron control system 1,<br>
which is suitable for execution of the method according to the invention. The electronic control<br>
system 1 to be tested is connected here via a data channel 2 to a test device 3. An environment<br>
model 4 is calculated on test device 3, in which the environment model 4 interacts with the<br>
control system 1 by output of environment model data via the test device 3 to the control system<br>
1 and by receiving control system data from the control system 1 via data channel 2.<br>
In principle, testing of the control system 1 via the test device 3 occurs by influencing the<br>
environment model 4, which is executed on test device 3. For this purpose, a test model 5 to<br>
influence the environment model 4 and/or to calculate the environment model 4 and/or the<br>
electronic control system 1 is executed on the test device 3, in which the test model 5 or the test<br>
models 5, 5a, 5b are executed functionally independently of the environment model 4 and,<br>
during test operation, synchronously with the environment model 4. The environment model 4<br>
itself and calculation of the environment model 4 can be influenced, for example, by changing<br>
the parameters of the environment model 4. However, it is equally possible, with the method<br>
implemented on test device 3, to influence the control system 1 being tested directly via the data<br>
channel 2 via test model 5, i.e., by applying test signals.<br>
It is advantageous in the practical example depicted in Fig. 1 of the tent device 3, or the test<br>
method executed on test device 3, that the test model 5 is executed functionally independently<br>
from the environment model 4, so that the environment model 4 is not changed or need not be<br>
adapted even during changes of test model 5.<br>
In the test device 3 according to Fig. 1 to 4, the functional independence of environment model 4<br>
from the test model 5 is achieved by describing and/or reading-out memory locations by test<br>
model 5 with knowledge of the memory locations of the model quantities of the environment<br>
model 4. Test model 5 can be arbitrarily altered (even during the running time of the<br><br>
--13--<br>
environment model 4), without having to adapt the environment model 4 in any way. Because of<br>
the direct access of the test model 5 to the model quantities of the environment model 4 achieved<br>
in this way, an interface can be dispensed with, with which the model quantities of the<br>
environment model 4 must be made accessible, for which reason the depicted method entails<br>
significant running time advantages.<br>
Fig. 1 also shows that a device 3 was connected to a configuration device 6 via another data<br>
channel 7, so that the test model 5 and the environment model 4 can subsequently be transferred<br>
via the additional data channel 7 from configuration device 6 to test device 3. The configuration<br>
device in the practical example depicted in Fig. 1 serves as a user interface, which enables the<br>
user to influence the test device 3 as desired.<br>
Because of the functional independence between the environment model 4 and the test model 5,<br>
it is readily possible, during the running time of environment model 4, to atop execution of test<br>
model 5 or one of the executed test models 5a, 5b (Fig. 4) on test device 3, just as it is also<br>
possible to load a test model 5 on test device 3 and execute it. Activation of a test model 5, 5a, 5b<br>
in the depicted practical examples, independently of the loading process of a test model 5, 5a, 5b,<br>
is encountered, for example, when all test models 5, 5a, 5b, already at the beginning of the test of<br>
control system 1, were present on test device 3, but are to be executed not simultaneously, but<br>
with a time offset.<br>
In the practical examples depicted in Fig. 1 to 6, each test model 5, 5a, 5b, at the beginning of its<br>
running time, is executed in an asynchronous operating mode relative to environment model 4,<br>
until all the initialization processes of the test models 5, 5a, 5b are concluded, which would<br>
prevent execution of test operation in real time. Because of this configuration of the test method,<br>
the real-time and synchronism requirements can be reset temporarily, so that there is no hazard<br>
that the test process is interrupted, because of violation of these requirements, although the<br>
already initialized test models 5,5a, 5b can be executed easily with fulfillment of these<br>
requirements on the test device 3.<br><br>
--14--<br>
The test device or the depicted test model, as shown in Fig. 1 to 6, is configured, so that each test<br>
model 5, 5a, 5b is present on the test device 3 in an execution format or is converted to an<br>
execution format that is executed by an interpreter implemented on the test device 3, In the<br>
practical examples, a real-time interpreter is involved, which translates the test models 5, 5a, 5b,<br>
present in the form of byte code, and executes them.<br>
In the depicted practical examples for synchronization of the test models 5, 5a, 5b with the<br>
environment model 4, an activation signal 8 is generated by the environment model 4 to activate<br>
test models 5, 5a, 5b. Activation signal 8 fills the function of a timer for execution of test models<br>
5, 5a, 5b, In which the required functional independence between the environment model 4 and<br>
the test models 5, 5a, 5b is also ensured. Generation of the activation gignal 8 is shown, in<br>
particular, in Fig, 2 to 4 and 6. In the practical examples, the activation signal 8 is generated in<br>
each calculation interval 9 of the environment model 4, so that the test models 5, 5a, 5b can be<br>
executed with precise time synchronization with environment model 4.<br>
In the practical examples, the activation signal 8 is issued after all input quantities of the<br>
environment model 4 have been entered and all model quantities of the environment model 4<br>
(optionally using these input quantities) have been calculated. This ensures that influencing of<br>
the environment model 4 by test models 5, 5a, 5b occurs when the environment model has a<br>
consistent dataset.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2 to 4 and 6, a scheduling method is activated by the activation signal 8, which<br>
coordinates executions of the test model 5, so that the functional independence between<br>
environment model 4 and test model 5 also remains ensured.<br>
The scheduling method is configured in the practical examples according to Fig. 1 to 6 in a<br>
specific manner, in order to be able to meet the real-time and synchronism requirements in<br>
particularly advantageous fashion. For this purpose, based on the activation signal 8, a first<br>
scheduler 10 is initially activated, in which the first scheduler 10 executes test model 5 (Fig. 2).<br>
Execution can be directed in the practical examples only to part of the test models 5, 5a, 5b,<br>
which corresponds to a stipulated calculation interval 9. After completed execution of test<br><br>
--15--<br>
models 5, 5a, 5b or the stipulated part of test models 5, 5a, 5b, the first, scheduler 10 indicates<br>
termination of the calculation by a termination signal (not shown). It follows from this that the<br>
first scheduler 10 can make execution of test models 5, 5a, 5b independent of other parameters,<br>
for example, the system time or actual calculation interval 9. These parameters are transferred to<br>
the first scheduler 10 as call-up parameters in the depicted practical examples.<br>
In other practical examples (not shown here), the first scheduler 10 receives these and other<br>
parameters by read-out of a parameter memory area prescribed for this. These parameters can<br>
generally also contain information as to which of the test models 5, 5a, 5b are to be executed or<br>
stopped.<br>
A test model 5, 5a, 5b can include several test strings 11a, 11b and 11c, 11d, in which the test<br>
strings 11a, 11b, 11c, 11d are to be understood to mean those parts of a test model 5, 5a, 5b that<br>
are to be executed simultaneously, i.e., within a calculation interval 9. In a case, in which the test<br>
model 5, 5a, 5b has several test strings 11a, 11b, 11c, 11d to be processed simultaneously, the<br>
first scheduler 10 calls up a second scheduler 12, 12a, 12b, optionally with indication of the test<br>
strings to be processed simultaneously, whereupon the second scheduler 12,12a, 12b causes<br>
execution of the test strings 11a, 11b, 11 c, 11d to be processed simultaneously in succession and,<br>
after completion of all test strings 11a, 11b, 11c, 11d to be processed simultaneously, indicates<br>
termination of execution to the first scheduler 10. The first scheduler-10 indicates termination of<br>
calculation by a termination signal. Fig. 3 shows that a single test model 5 includes several test<br>
strings 11a, 11b that are processed systematically by means of the indicated method.<br>
In a case in which several test models 5, 5a, 5b or parts of several test models 5, 5a, 5b are to be<br>
calculated simultaneously, it is prescribed in the practical example according to Fig. 4 that the<br>
first scheduler 10 assigns to each test model 5, 5a, 5b a second scheduler 12a, 12b and calls up<br>
the second scheduler 12a, 12b assigned to each test model 5, 5a, 5b, so that only one second<br>
scheduler 12a, 12b is always active, the corresponding active second scheduler 12a, 12b<br>
indicates to the first scheduler 10 termination of execution of the test model 5, 5a, 5b assigned to<br>
it, whereupon the first scheduler 10 activates an additionally (previously unactivated) second<br>
scheduler 12a, 12b, until all test models 5, 5a, 5b or parts of test models 5, 5a, 5b have been<br><br>
--16--<br>
calculated, whereupon the first scheduler 10 indicates termination of calculation by a termination<br>
signal. This method is particularly clear and simple to implement and permits checking complete<br>
processing of several test models 5, 5a, 5b in simple fashion.<br>
The practical example according to Fig. 4 also shows that the described properties of the<br>
scheduling method can also be used combined, i.e., in a case in which several of the test models<br>
5, 5a, 5b have parallel test strings 11a, 11b, 11c, 11d.<br>
The practical example depicted in Fig. 5 and 6 explains the method of function of the test method,<br>
scheduling method and the test device by means of a practical example, in which a sinusoidal<br>
signal is to be output as test signal by the test device 3. Fig. 5 shows a continuous sinusoidal<br>
signal 14, as well as a time-discrete signal 15 to be generated by the test device 3 or the test<br>
mode) 5, with consideration of the calculation interval 9 of the environment model 4, which<br>
corresponds to the time-discretized continuous signal 14.<br>
Successful calculation of the discrete signal value 15a at the beginning of the calculation interval<br>
designated with time unit "3" is the starting point of the consideration in Fig. 6; for<br>
simplification, it is assumed that the test models are always executed at the beginning of each<br>
calculation interval 9. Calculation occurred by execution of the test model 5 close to time "3."<br>
After completed calculation of the signal value 15a, the first scheduler 10 refers back to the<br>
environment model 4 by output of a termination signal (dashed line, vertically downward arrows<br>
in Fig. 6).<br>
On reaching the next calculation interval 9 at a time of "4" time units, the environment model 4<br>
generates the first scheduler 10 by the activation signal 8, which then calculates the test model 5<br>
for the now current calculation interval 9, which ends in calculation of the signal value 15b<br>
(dashed line, vertically downward-pointing arrows in Fig. 6). The described process is continued<br>
for the next calculation intervals 9.<br><br>
