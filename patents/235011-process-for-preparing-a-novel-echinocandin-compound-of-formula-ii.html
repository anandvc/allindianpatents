A - Inhibition of the glucane synthesis of Candida albicans.<br>
The membranes of Candida albicans are purified according to the process described by Tang and al Antimicrob. Agents Chemother 35, 99-103, 1991. 22.5µg of membrane proteins are incubated in a mixture of 2Mm of 14C-UDP glucose (specific activity = 0.34mCi./mmol, 50µg of a-amylase, 1Mm of dithiotreitol (DTT), 1Mm EDTA, 100Mm NaF, 7µM of GTP-y-S, 1M of sucrose and 5oMm OF T tris-HCL (pH 7.8) in a volume of 100pl. The medium is incubated at 25°C for 1 hour and the reaction terminated by addition of TCA<br>
to' a final concentration of 5%. The reaction medium is transferred onto a pre-<br>
humidified glass fibre filter. The filter is washed, dried and its radioactivity is<br>
counted.<br>
Mulundocandin is used as positive control.<br>
The control of the medium is carried out with the same quantity of DMSO 1 %.<br>
