Owing to the basic character of its nitrogen atoms, the compound<br>
I	is capable of forming salts or adducts with inorganic or<br>
organic acids or with metal ions.<br>
Examples of inorganic acids are hydrohalic acids, such as hydrogen fluoride, hydrogen chloride, hydrogen bromide and hydrogen iodide, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid and nitric acid.<br>
Suitable organic acids are, for example, formic acid, carbonic acid and alkanoic acids, such as acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, trichloroacetic acid and propionic acid, and also glycolic acid, thiocyanic acid, lactic acid, succinic acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, oxalic acid, alkylsulfonic acids (sulfonic acids having straight-chain or branched alkyl radicals of 1 to 20 carbon atoms), arylsulfonic acids or -disulfonic acids (aromatic radicals, such as phenyl and naphthyl, which carry one or two sulfonic acid groups), alkylphosphonic acids (phosphonic acids having straight-chain or branched alkyl radicals of 1 to 20 carbon atoms), arylphosphonic acids or -diphosphonic acids (aromatic radicals, such as phenyl and naphthyl, which carry one or two phosphonic acid radicals), where the alkyl or aryl radicals may carry further substituents, for example p-toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid, p-aminosalicylic acid, 2-phenoxybenzoic acid, 2-acetoxybenzoic acid, etc.<br>
Suitable metal ions are in particular the ions of the elements of the second main group, in particular calcium and magnesium, of the third and fourth main group, in particular aluminum, tin and lead, and also of the first to eighth transition group, in particular chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc and others. Particular preference is given to the metal ions of the elements of the transition groups of the fourth period. The metals can be present in the various valencies that they can assume.<br>
When preparing the mixtures, it is preferred to employ the pure active compounds I to XXI, to which may be added further active compounds against harmful fungi or against other pests, such as insects, arachnids or nematodes, or else herbicidal or growth-regulating active compounds or fertilizers.<br>
The mixtures of the compound I with at least one of the compounds<br>
II	to XXI, or the compound I and at least one of the compounds II<br>
to XXI applied simultaneously, together or separately, exhibit<br><br>
outstanding activity against a wide range of phytopathogenic fungi, in particular from the classes Ascomycetes, Basidiomycetes, Phycomycetes and Deutercmycetes. Some of them act systemically and can therefore also be employed as foliar- and soil-acting fungicides.<br>
They are especially important for controlling a large number of fungi in a variety of crop plants, such as cotton, vegetable species {for example cucumbers, beans, tomatoes, potatoes and cucurbits), barley, grass, oats, bananas, coffee, corn, fruit species, rice, rye, soya, grapevine, wheat, ornamentals, sugar cane, and a large number of seeds.<br>
They are particularly suitable for controlling the following phytopathogenic fungi: Blumeria grautiinis (powdery mildew) in cereals, Erysiphe cichoracearum and Sphaerotheca fuliginea in cucurbits, Podosphaera leucotricha in apples, Uncinula necator in grapevines, Puccinia species in cereals, Rhizoctonia species in cotton, rice and lawns, Ustilago species in cereals and sugar cane, Venturia inaequalis (scab) in apples, Helminthosporium species in cereals, Septoria nodorum in wheat, Botrytis cinera (gray mold) in strawberries, vegetables, ornamentals and grapevines, Cercospora arachidicola in groundnuts, Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides in wheat and barley, Pyricularia oryzae in rice, Phytophthora infestans in potatoes and tomatoes, Plasmopara viticola in grapevines, Pseudoperonospora species in hops and cucumbers, Alternaria species in vegetables and fruit, Mycosphaerella species in bananas and also Fusarium and Verticillium species.<br>
The compound I and at least one of the compounds II to Xlii can be applied simultaneously, that is together or separately, or in succession, the sequence, in the case of separate application, generally not having any effect on the result of the control<br>
measures.<br>

Powders, materials fot broadcasting and dusts can be prepared by mixing or jointly grinding the compound l and at least one of the compounds II to XXI ot the mixture of the compound I with at least one of the compounds II to XXI with a solid carrier.<br>
Granules (for example coated granules, impregnated granules or homogeneous granules) are usually prepared by binding the active compound or active compounds to a solid carrier.<br>
Fillers or solid carriers are, for example, mineral earths, such as silicas, silica gels, silicates, talc, kaolin, limestone, lime, chalk, bole, loess, clay, dolomite, diatomaceous earth, calcium sulfate, magnesium sulfate, magnesium oxide, ground synthetic minerals, and also fertilizers, such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium phosphate, ammonium nitrate, ureas, and products of vegetable origin, such as cereal meal, tree bark meal, wood meal and nutshell meal, cellulose powders or other solid carriers.<br><br>
The formulations generally comprise from 0.1 to 95% by weight, preferably from 0.5 to 90% by weight, of the compound I and at least one of the compounds II to XXI or of the mixture of the compound I with at least one of the compounds II to XXI. The active compounds are employed in a purity of from 90i to 100%, preferably from 95% to 100% (according to NMR spectrum or HPLC).<br>
The compound I and at least one of the compounds II to XXI, the mixtures, or the corresponding formulations, are applied by treating the harmful fungi, their habitat, or the plants, seeds, soils, areas, materials or spaces to be kept free from them with a fungicidally effective amount of the mixture, or of the compound I and at least one of the compounds II to XXI in the case of separate application.<br>
Application can be effected before or after infection by the harmful fungi.<br>
Use example<br>
The synergistic activity of the mixtures according to the invention was demonstrated by the following experiments:<br>
The active compounds, separately or together, were formulated as a 10% emulsion in a mixture of 85% by weight of cyclohexanone and 5% by weight of emulsifier, and diluted with water to the desired concentration.<br>
Evaluation was carried out by determining the infected leaf areas in percent. These percentages were converted into efficacies. The efficacy (g) was calculated as follows using Abbot's formula:<br><br>
a  corresponds to the fungal infection of the treated plants in<br>
% and p   corresponds to the fungal infection of the untreated<br>
(control) plants in %<br>
An efficacy of 0 means that the infection level of the treated plants corresponds to that of the untreated control plants; an efficacy of 100 means that the treated plants were not infected.<br><br>
The expected efficacies of the mixtures of the active compounds were determined using Colby's formula [R.S. Colby, Weeds 11, 20-22 (1967)] and compared with the observed efficacies.<br><br>
E  expected efficacy, expressed in % of the untreated control,<br>
when using the mixture	of the active compounds A and B at the<br>
concentrations a and b<br>
X   efficacy, expressed in	% of the untreated control, when using<br>
active compound A at a	concentration of a<br>
y  efficacy, expressed in	% of the untreated control, when using<br>
active compound B at a	concentration of b<br>
Use example 1: Activity against mildew of wheat caused by Erysiphe  [ayn.  Blumeria]  graminis  forma specialis. trltici<br>
Leaves of wheat seedlings of the cultivar "Kanzler", grown in pots, were sprayed to runoff point with an aqueous preparation of active compound which had been prepared from a stock solution comprising 10% of active compound, 85% of cyclohexanone and 5% of emulsifier, and 24 hours after the spray coating had dried on, the leaves were dusted with spores of mildew of wheat [Erysiphe [syn.  Blumeria]  graminis  forma specialis. tritici).  The test plants were then placed in a greenhouse at 20 - 24°C and 60 - 90% relative atmospheric humidity. After 7 days, the extent of the mildew development was determined visually in % infection of the entire leaf area.<br>
The visually determined values for the percentage of diseased leaf areas were converted into efficacies in % of the untreated control. An efficacy of 0 means the same disease level as in the untreated control, an efficacy of 100 means a disease level of 0%. The expected efficacies for the combinations of active compounds were determined using Colby's formula, mentioned above, and compared with the observed efficacies.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The test results show that in all mixing ratios the observed efficacy is higher than the efficacy calculated beforehand using Colby's formula (from Synerg 176. SLX)<br>
Use exAmple 2: Protective activity against mildew of cucumber caused by Sphaerotheca fuliginea<br>
Leaves of cucumber seedlings of the cultivar "Chinese snake", grown in pots, were, at the cotyledon stage, sprayed to runoff point with an aqueous preparation of active compound which had been prepared from a stock solution comprising 10% of active compound, 85% of cyclohexanone and 5% of emulsifier. 20 hours after the spray coating had dried on, the plants were inoculated with an aqueous spore suspension of mildew of cucumber (Sphaerotheca fuliginea).  The plants were then cultivated in a greenhouse at 20 - 24°C and 60 - 80% relative atmospheric humidity for 7 days. The extent of the mildew development was then determined visually in % infection of the cotyledon area. The visually determined values for the percentage of diseased leaf areas were converted into efficacies in % of the untreated control, an efficacy of 0 means the same disease level as in the untreated control, an efficacy of 100 means a disease level of 0%. The expected efficacies for the combinations of active compounds were determined using Colby's formula, mentioned above, and compared with the observed efficacies.<br><br><br>
