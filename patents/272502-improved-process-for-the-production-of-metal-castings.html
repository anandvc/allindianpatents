				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention provides an improved process for<br>
production of metal castings such as intake manifold<br>
castings.<br>
The present practice in foundries is to use a shell sand<br>
core for casting. Sand core is a poor conductor of heat. As<br>
a result, when molten metal is introduced into the sand core,<br>
heat dissipation through the walls of the sand core is very<br>
slow. Therefore, molten metal in heavy and isolated casting<br>
areas remains hotter for a longer time than in other areas of<br>
the casting. This results in shrinkage/porosity problem. In<br>
order to solve this problem, the casting area in which<br>
shrinkage occurs has to be fed with molten metal from<br>
additional feeders, or this area has to be cooled faster. In<br>
many cases, it is not possible to use additional feeders or<br>
risers. So, in prior art faster cooling, called 'chilling'<br>
was adopted. It is also known in the prior art to provide an<br>
aluminium paint coating on sand cores where porosity is<br>
likely to appear. But this has not been found to be<br>
satisfactory. Further, in the case of heavy castings where<br>
the section is very heavy, such a method does not solve the<br>
problem of porosity.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
process for production of metal castings which eliminates the<br>
occurrence of shrinkage/porosity, especially in heavy-<br>
castings. The present invention envisages to eliminate, or<br>
at least minimize shrinkage problems in complicate castings<br>
in permanent gravity/tilting gravity molds using shell sand<br>
cores.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved<br>
process for production of metal castings, said process<br>
comprising:<br>
(a) placing in a casting mold a shell sand core having the<br>
pattern of the metal casting to be produced;<br>
(b) introducing molten metal into the casting mold;<br>
(c) allowing the molten metal to cool to form the metal<br>
casting; and<br>
(d) removing the metal casting from the casting mold;<br>
characterized by:<br>
(i) cutting out portions of the shell sand core<br>
corresponding to the portions of the casting having<br>
defects, to form shell sand core portions;<br>
(ii) dressing each shell sand core portion to the shape of a<br>
chill to be produced;<br>
(iii) positioning a said shell sand core portion in a casting<br>
mold and pouring molten metal into the mold to produce<br>
a chill mold;<br>
(iv) pouring molten metal into the chill mold to produce a<br>
chill;<br>
(v) repeating steps (iii) and (iv) for each shell sand core<br>
portion to produce chills;<br>
(vi) shot blasting the chills by methods known per se to make<br>
the surfaces thereof rough;<br>
(vii) preheating the chills to about 100 to 150°C;<br>
(viii) positioning the chills ofstep (vii) at appropriate<br>
positions in a shell core mold mounted in a shell core<br>
shooting machine;<br>
(ix) injecting resin-sand mixture into the shellsand core<br>
mold and curing the mixtureto produce a chill core<br>
comprising a shell sand core embodying said chills;<br>
(x)placing thechillcore insaid casting mold and<br>
thereafter pouring molten metal into the casting mold to<br>
produce said metal casting.<br>
It is preferableto makethechillsofaluminium,<br>
instead of cast iron or steel for the following reasons:<br>
(a) Molten aluminium is readily available in the foundry and<br>
hence economical;<br>
(b) Latent heat of aluminium is 93 cal/g, as compared to<br>
latent heat of 63.7 cal/g of iron; so, aluminium chills<br>
formed can absorb more heat than iron;<br>
(c) Thermal conductivity of Al is 0.5 cal/cm /cm2/S/cc),<br>
which is 3 times more than that of iron; so, chilling<br>
effect of aluminium chill is three times faster than<br>
that of iron chill;<br>
(d) The chills can be produced by mass production, with the<br>
help of simple molds which are prepared using the<br>
casting portion itself as the pattern;<br>
The invention will now be described by way of<br>
illustration with reference to the accompanying drawings,<br>
wherein:<br>

process;<br>

and air leak in the casting of Fig. 1;<br>

present invention;<br>

first embodiment of the present invention;<br>

and a casting with chills according to the present invention;<br>
Fig. 8 shows an intake manifold casting produced by a second<br>
embodiment of the method of the present invention;<br>
Figs. 9 and 10 show a close-up view of a casting of prior art<br>
surrounded by sand core on three sides;<br>
Figs. 11 and 12 show close-up views of a casting produced by<br>
the second embodiment of Fig. 8;<br>
Fig. 13 shows graph ofairleak withoutchills and with<br>
chills.<br>
Fig. 1 shows an intake manifold produced by known<br>
processes. In this case, molten metal is fed from a main<br>
riser 1 into a casting mould 2 filled with sand core 3. When<br>
the casting is removed from the mould 2, it is observed that<br>
there is shrinkage 4.Fig. 2 shows the shrinkage 4 in a<br>
greater detail.<br>
It is known to apply aluminium paint 5 (Fig. 3) on the<br>
sand core at places where the casting is likely to have<br>
shrinkage. Even when such aluminium paint is used, in the<br>
case of heavy castings or castings of complicated shapes, the<br>
shrinkage cannot be eliminated. It is seen from Fig. 4 that<br>
when drilling is carried out, air leak (6) is observed.<br>
In order to overcome this problem, the present invention<br>
proposes use of chills embodied in the shell sand core.<br>
First of all a casting is produced by the known<br>
processes. Then, the areas of shrinkage porosity in the<br>
casting are identified. Thereafter, the shell core portion<br>
corresponding to these areas are cut from the shell sand<br>
core. Thus, the shell sand core 3 itself is used as the<br>
pattern. Each shell core portion is dressed and shaped to<br>
the desired shape of the chill to be produced. Each shell<br>
core portion should preferably be of a size at least twice<br>
the size of the defective area, (preferably two to three<br>
times the size of the defective area), so that the chill does<br>
not get melted by the molten metal during casting. A shell<br>
core portion is placed in a casting mold and metal is poured<br>
into the mold. After cooling, the metal solidifies to form a<br>
chill mold. The cavity in the chill mold is preferably<br>
coated with dycote. Metal is poured into the chill mold and<br>
allowed to cool and solidify to form a chill. During<br>
pouring, the temperature of the molten metal is preferably<br>
kept below 700°C. The chill is removed from the casting<br>
mold. Burrs and fleshes on the chill are removed by methods<br>
well known in the art. Thereafter, the chill is shotblast by-<br>
methods known per se. These steps are repeated for each<br>
shell core portion.<br>
The chills are then preheated to about 100 to 150°C and<br>
placed at appropriate positions in a shell sand core mold of<br>
a shell core shooting machine. Resin-sand mixture is<br>
injected into the shell core mold and cured to form a chill<br>
core comprising shell sand core embodying the chills. The<br>
chill core is positioned in the casting mold. Thereafter the<br>
molten metal is introduced into the casting mold. After<br>
cooling the metal casting is taken out. When the sand is<br>
knocked out of the casting mold, the chills also drop out and<br>
can be re-used.<br>
Figs. 5 and 6, it can be seen that chill core comprises<br>
shell sand core 3 with sand core portions 7 corresponding to<br>
the identified defective area encast therewith. From Fig.<br>
6, it can be seen that the casting 8 produced does not have<br>
any porosity even after drilling operation is carried out.<br>
For checking air leak, tapped holes were drilled in the<br>
castings produced by known process and the process according<br>
to the present invention. From the graph shown in Fig. 7, in<br>
the case of a casting made without the use of chill core, it<br>
can be seen that the air leak was quite high. But when chill<br>
core was used according to the present invention, there was a<br>
dramatic elimination of air leak, indicating that the casting<br>
had no shrinkage porosity.<br>
Fig. 8 shows an intake manifold casting produced with<br>
shell sand core 3 on three sides. When no chill core was<br>
used, an area 4 having shrinkage porosity was identified.<br>
The shrinkage was observed in the casting area formed by sand<br>
cores from three sides. This was due to poor conductivity of<br>
the sand cores. This caused shrinkage / porosity in the<br>
identified area.<br>
In Fig. 9, the aluminium casting portion 9 has a central<br>
sand core 31 and also sand cores 32, 33 and 34. From Fig.<br>
10, it can be seen that a portion 91 of the casting is<br>
surrounded by sand cores 32, 33, 34. Due to poor<br>
conductivity of the sand cores, area 4 of shrinkage porosity<br>
is formed. This cannot be eliminated even by application of<br>
aluminium paint, especially in the case of heavy castings.<br>
In order to overcome this problem, chills 7 made as<br>
earlier described are encast with the sand cores at the<br>
places where porosity is observed. This is shown in Fig. 11.<br>
From Fig. 12 is can be seen that porosity is almost<br>
eliminated.<br>
Air leak tests were carried out on castings produced by<br>
known method and castings produced by the method of the<br>
present invention. As can be seen from Fig. 13, air leak was<br>
high in castings produced by known methods, whereas there was<br>
very little air leak in castings produced with chill cores<br>
according to the present invention.<br>
The present invention is very usefulin producing<br>
aluminium castings having complicatedshapeswithno<br>
shrinkage or the least shrinkage.<br>
In the prior art, shrinkage was a problem. Although use<br>
of aluminium paint can be adopted, it cannot fully eliminate<br>
the problem of shrinkage porosity. Further use of aluminium<br>
paint with alcohol entails higher cost of production. Also,<br>
when air-cleaning the mould, aluminium paint particles fly<br>
around and form a pollution hazard around the foundry.<br>
Further, use of aluminium paint does not solve the problem of<br>
shrinkage in heavier castings and castings having complicated<br>
shapes.<br>
In the present invention, chill cores are used. These<br>
have high heat conduction property. As a result, fine grain<br>
size is obtained in the castings. In heavier castings,<br>
shrinkage can be minimized to a great extent. Also, this<br>
eliminates the use of additional feeders or risers and thus<br>
greatly reduces the cost of production. Further in certain<br>
cases, it may not be possible to provide such additional<br>
feeders or risers. In addition, chill cores can be made in<br>
the same foundry where the castings are made. Thus the<br>
process according to the invention is very economical. In<br>
addition, the chills can be taken out of the shell sand core<br>
after casting and re-used.<br>
Although the chills can be made of any metal having a<br>
good thermal conductivity, aluminium chills are preferred.<br>
The present invention is very economical for production of<br>
aluminium castings of heavy sections or complicated shapes.<br>
