FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention generally relates to electric motors, and more particularly<br>
relates to motor control processors for multiple motors and their operation.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Utilizing multiple microprocessors for multiple motor control processors<br>
controlling multiple motors is problematic in that coordination and<br>
communication between the motor control processors adds additional levels of<br>
complexity and utilizes additional resources and computation time, as well as<br>
requiring the establishment of some hierarchy mechanisms for the processors.<br>
Yet utilizing a single motor control processor for multiple motor control presents<br>
difficulty in that each motor may use a different switching frequency.<br>
While motor control circuits have been disclosed which use variable switching<br>
frequencies with a single motor controller to increase available execution time for<br>
additional low speed motor control algorithms or to reduce switching losses, a<br>
multiple motor system presents additional difficulties. For example, implementing<br>
a method to control two variable frequency motor drives within a single<br>
processor requires providing continuously variable switching frequencies for both<br>
controllers. Unwanted delays, however, may be introduced when the required<br>
sampling times overlap.<br><br>
US 7425806 to Harold Robert Schnetzka et al describes a variable speed drive<br>
having a converter to convert an AC voltage, a DC voltage, a DC link to filter and<br>
store energy from the converter, and a plurality of inverters. Each inverter is<br>
configured to convert a DC voltage to an AC voltage and is electrically connected<br>
in parallel to the DC link. An interleaved pulse width modulation control<br>
technique is used to control the operation of the plurality of inverters and<br>
possibly the converter to lower the RMS ripple current in the DC link.<br>
US 7629756 to Terry Murrell et al discloses method and apparatus for controlling<br>
first and second motors. According to the cited invention a controller includes a<br>
processor supplying a control signal for driving the motors and a logic circuit<br>
coupled to the processor. The processor produces a first trigger coordinated with<br>
the rate of the first motor and a second trigger coordinated with the rate of the<br>
second motor. The logic circuit produces a third trigger from a combination of<br>
the first and second triggers. The processor includes a converter for sampling the<br>
currents of the motors in response to the third trigger. The processor further<br>
produces a modified pulse width in the first trigger if a period between the first<br>
and second triggers is less than a predetermined limit and directs the converter<br>
to consecutively sample the currents in response to the modified pulse width.<br><br>
 Accordingly, it is desirable to provide a method for utilization of a<br>
single motor control processor for controlling two or more motor controllers in<br>
a multiple motor system. In addition, it is desirable to provide a variable<br>
frequency control method for two motor controllers in one motor control<br>
processor which avoids unwanted delays in current sampling. Furthermore,<br>
other desirable features and characteristics of the present invention will<br>
become apparent from the subsequent detailed description and the appended<br>
claims, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and the<br>
foregoing technical field and background.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
 A motor control processor is provided for motor phase current<br>
sampling of multiple variable frequency controlled electric motors. The motor<br>
control processor comprises an analog-to-digital (A/D) converter and a<br>
controller. The A/D converter has multiple analog inputs and generates a<br>
digital output signal in response to the multiple analog inputs. The controller<br>
is coupled to the A/D converter and determines a maximum desired switching<br>
frequency for a first one of the multiple variable frequency controlled electric<br>
motors. The controller further selects a base period in response to the<br>
maximum desired switching frequency and defines a phase shift time delay as<br>
a fraction of the base period so that the controller may control the multiple<br>
analog inputs of the A/D converter to sample motor phase currents of each of<br>
the multiple variable frequency controlled electric motors at sample times<br>
determined by the controller in response to the base period and the phase shift<br>
time delay.<br>
 A method is provided for motor phase current sampling of multiple<br>
variable frequency controlled electric motors. The method includes<br>
determining a maximum desired switching frequency for a first one of the<br>
multiple variable frequency controlled electric motors, selecting a base period<br><br>
in response to the maximum desired switching frequency, defining a phase<br>
shift time delay as a fraction of the base period, and sampling motor phase<br>
currents of each of the multiple variable frequency controlled electric motors<br>
at sample times determined in response to the base period and the phase shift<br>

DESCRIPTION OF AN EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT<br>
 The following detailed description is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and is not intended to limit the invention or the application and uses of the<br>
invention. Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any expressed or<br>
implied theory presented in the preceding technical field, background, brief<br>
summary or the following detailed description.<br>
 Referring to FIG. 1, a multiple electric motor system 100 in<br>
accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, such as a dual<br>
electric motor system for a hybrid vehicle propulsion system, includes a first<br>
variable speed electric motor 105 and a second variable speed electric motor<br><br>
107. A direct current (DC) power source 110, such as a battery or a fuel cell,<br>
utilizes a high voltage node 112 and a low voltage node 114 to provide DC<br>
current to a first inverter 115 for driving the first motor 105. In addition, the<br>
power source 110 also provides DC current to a second inverter 117 for<br>
driving the second motor 107. A capacitor 119 is connected between the high<br>
voltage node 112 and the low voltage node 114 for providing a low impedance<br>
path for alternating current (AC) to flow.<br>
 The electric motors 105, 107 are variable frequency controlled<br>
electric motors, wherein the individual motor speeds may be independent and<br>
the switching frequency of the inverters 115, 117 may also be independently<br>
variable. A maximum desired switching frequency is associated with either<br>
one or both of the inverters 115, 117.<br>
 In order to reduce cost and component count, it is desirable to<br>
utilize a single motor control processor to control the two separate inverters<br>
115, 117. In accordance with the embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
multiple electric motor system 100 includes a single motor control processor<br>
120, such as a microprocessor. The motor control processor 120 includes a<br>
controller 122 which generates pulse width modulated (PWM) control signals<br>
in a manner well-known to those skilled in the art to regulate the fundamental<br>
component of the motor phase voltage to a desired amplitude, phase, and<br>
frequency. The controller 122 is coupled to the inverters 115, 117 to provide<br>
the PWM control signals to switching elements thereof. The motor control processor 120 also includes an internal analog-<br>
to-digital (A/D) converter 124. To minimize costs of the electric motor<br>
system 100 by not including additional components or circuitry, the internal<br>
A/D converter 124 is utilized for sampling phase currents at the input to the<br>
inverters 115, 117 and generating therefrom a digital signal as a phase current<br>
sense signal, the phase current sense signal being provided to the controller<br>
122.<br><br>
 While each of the two inverters 115, 117 requires two of its phase<br>
currents to be sampled simultaneously (i.e., a total of four signals to be<br>
sampled, two signals 130, 132 from the two phase currents to the motor 105<br>
and two signals 134, 136 from the two phase currents to the motor 107), the<br>
A/D converter 124 has only two channels which can be simultaneously<br>
sampled. Therefore, in accordance with the present invention, the motor<br>
control processor 120 also includes a switching element 126 for receiving the<br>
four phase currents to be sampled and, operating under the control of the<br>
controller 122, providing two input signals at any one time to the two channel<br>
inputs of the A/D converter 124.<br>
 The controller 122 provides variable frequency control of the two<br>
inverters 115, 117 in one motor control processor 120, while avoiding any<br>
unwanted delays in the current sampling by the single A/D converter 124<br>
internal to the motor control processor 120. In addition to providing two of<br>
the four signals 130, 132, 134, 136 to the input of the A/D converter 124 at<br>
any one time to sample the phase currents (i.e., the two sets of the four signals<br>
130, 132, 134, 136) associated with each motor 105, 107 simultaneously, the<br>
phase currents are sampled with a fixed phase relation to the PWM signals<br>
provided from the controller 122 to the inverters 115, 117. The fixed phase relation to the PWM control signals is determined<br>
by the controller 122 in response to the cycle of the PWM signals. Since the<br>
PWM signals induce an AC harmonic ripple on the phase currents, it is<br>
preferable to sample the fundamental component of each phase current while<br>
ignoring the AC ripple component. As the AC ripple component passes<br>
through zero at the start and center points of each cycle of the PWM signal, it<br>
is preferable to sample the PWM signal at either the start or the midpoint of<br>
each cycle. In accordance with the embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
phase currents are sampled at the start of a cycle of the PWM signal thereby<br>
effectively providing the average value of the phase current for that PWM<br><br>
cycle. The phase current sense signal values generated in response to the<br>
sampled phase current values and provided to the controller 122 from the A/D<br>
converter 124 are utilized by the controller 122 for motor control calculations<br>
to be performed during upcoming computational periods. While the cycle of the PWM signals can provide a basis for<br>
determining the sample times of the phase currents, any advance or delay in<br>
the phase current sample times with respect to the cycle of the PWM signal<br>
can introduce aliasing or errors into the phase current sense signal provided to<br>
the controller 122. Since the PWM signal also induces an AC harmonic ripple<br>
on the input current of each inverter, the switch element 126 must be operated<br>
under the control of the controller 122 to phase shift the PWM signals<br>
provided to the inverters 115, 117 to initiate current ripple cancellation. The<br>
sum of the input currents is the current flowing in the high voltage branch 112.<br>
This current has a DC component (i.e., an average current value) and an AC<br>
component. A large portion of the AC component flows through the capacitor<br>
119 to the low voltage node 114. Phase shifting the input currents flowing<br>
into the two inverters 115, 117 produces a cancellation effect on the AC<br>
components of the phase currents, thereby reducing the AC current flowing in<br>
the branch 112 and reducing the AC current flowing through the capacitor 119<br>
and the stress therein.<br>
 The controller 122 must also accommodate the switching<br>
frequencies of the inverters 115, 117 when determining the phase current<br>
sample times. The switching frequency of the inverters 115, 117 is often<br>
reduced at low motor speeds to minimize switching losses and/or allow<br>
additional controller 122 execution time. Conversely, at high motor speeds<br>
the switching frequency is often increased to provide adequate pulse ratio to<br>
maintain controllability, where pulse ratio is defined as the ratio of the<br>
switching frequency to the motor fundamental electrical frequency.<br>
Accordingly, the switch element 126 must be operated under the control of the<br><br>
controller 122 to sample the phase-shifted phase currents at sample times<br>
having a fixed phase relation to the PWM signals provided from the controller<br>
122 to the inverters 115, 117 in order to sample the phase currents in a fixed<br>
phase relation with speed of the variable speed motors 105, 107 wherein the<br>
sample times are calculated to fall within ideal sample time portions of the<br>
cycle of each of the phase-shifted phase current.<br>
 If the controller 122 signals the switch element 126 to shift in time<br>
the two sample times, there will not be any conflict between the sample times.<br>
However, with two totally independent switching frequencies, it is possible<br>
that sample instants calculated by the controller 122 line up at approximately<br>
the same time instant. In such a case, it is impossible for the A/D converter<br>
124 to sample all four phase currents simultaneously. While priority could be<br>
given to one set of inverter phase currents, thereby delaying the other set of<br>
inverter phase currents' sample point from its ideal sample instant, current<br>
sampling error would result and feedback signals would be corrupted and the<br>
motor control performance of the inverters 115, 117 would be degraded.<br>
Though the current sampling error induced in the non-ideal sample instant<br>
might be compensated for, such compensation would require significant<br>
processor computational power. Accordingly, in accordance with the<br>
embodiment of the present invention, the controller 122 advantageously<br>
guarantees that sample instants of signals 130, 132 will never overlap with<br>
sample instants of signals 134, 136 despite the independent variable frequency<br>
operation of the motors 105, 107 of the multiple electric motor system 100. Since the A/D converter 124 has a finite conversion time during<br>
which additional samples may not be taken, the controller 122 also utilizes a<br>
clock signal generated by a clock 128 for calculation of the phase current<br>
sample times in order to accommodate the known finite conversion time<br>
associated with the A/D converter 124 after each phase current set sample time<br>
that additional phase current set samples may not be taken.<br><br>
 Therefore, in accordance with the embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the controller 122 calculates the sample times of the phase currents<br>
and provides appropriate sample time signals to the switch element 126 for<br>
controlling the provision of the phase currents to the A/D converter 124 for<br>
sampling thereof. Referring to FIG. 2, a flowchart 200 of the operation of the<br>
controller 122 in accordance with the embodiment of the present invention<br>
initially determines whether the multiple electric motor system 100 has been<br>
powered on 202.<br>
 When the controller 122 determines that the electric motor system<br>
100 has been powered on 202, a maximum desired switching frequency (fmax)<br>
is selected 204 from a maximum one of the switching frequencies for one of<br>
the motor control inverters 115, 117. Next, a base period (Tbase) is defined 206<br>
as the period at the maximum switching frequency (1/ fmax). For example, for<br>
a maximum switching frequency of 12 kHz, the base period would be 83.33<br>
usee.<br>
 Then, a phase shift time delay (tShift) is defined 208 as a fractional<br>
amount of the base period (i.e., tshift = kShift x Tbase, where 0<kshift the></kshift>
value of kShift must provide sufficient separation between the two sample<br>
instants to allow the A/D converter 124 to sample and complete the conversion<br>
for one inverter 115 prior to starting the sampling for the second inverter 117.<br>
A value of one-half (kshift=½) provides maximum separation while maximizing<br>
the cancellation quality when both inverters 115, 117 are operating at the<br>
maximum desired frequency and is introduced as a time delay between the<br>
start time of the two motor control sample times.<br>
 Typically, both inverters 115, 117 will be operating at the<br>
maximum desired switching frequency (fmax) a majority of the time and when<br>
operating at fmax, the phase shift of the cycles of the PWM signals can help<br>
reduce the AC current stress placed upon the capacitor 119 because<br>
cancellation occurs due to the one hundred eighty degree (180°) phase shift in<br><br>
AC ripple currents feeding the capacitor 119 when both inverters 115, 117 run<br>
at the same switching frequency.<br>
 Next, the controller 122 defines 210 the first sample time for the<br>
first phase current (T1) (i.e., the phase current of the signals 130, 132 of the<br>
first inverter 115). Next, the controller 122 determines 211 the first sample<br>
time for the second phase current (T2) (i.e., the phase current of the signals<br>
134, 136 of the second inverter 117) in response to the first sample time and<br>
the phase shift time delay (T2= T1 + tShifi) 211.<br>
 Processing of the controller 122 then determines whether it is time<br>
for the first phase current sample time 212, time for the second phase current<br>
sample time 214, or time to power down 216. The time to power down is<br>
determined 216 in response to operational conditions (e.g., turning the power<br>
off to the electric motor system 100) well known to those skilled in the art. When it is time for the first phase current sample time 212, the<br>
controller 122 provides 218 a signal to the switch 126 to couple signals 130,<br>
132 from the first inverter phase currents to the inputs of the A/D converter<br>
124. The controller 122 then calculates the next sample time for the first<br>
inverter phase currents 220 in response to a switching frequency between<br>
switching times that is an integer multiple (N) of the base period (e.g., Ti = Ti<br>
+ Tsw, where Tsw = N x TbaSe)- Table 1 below provides a list of possible<br>
switching frequencies when a maximum switching frequency of 12 kHz is<br>
employed. The table stops at 2 kHz, but the frequency can be made arbitrarily<br>
low by extending the sample period with additional integer increments of<br>
Tbase- The proposed technique allows a wide range of selectable switching<br>
frequencies, while guaranteeing the synchronous sampling of signals without<br><br>
unwanted delay times. An additional benefit includes reduced capacitor 119<br>
stresses due to ripple current cancellation.<br><br>
After calculating the next sample time for the first phase current 220,<br>
processing returns to determine whether it is time for the next first phase<br>
current sample time 212, time for the next second phase current sample time<br>
214, or time to power down 216.<br>
 When it is time for the second phase current sample time 214, the<br>
controller 122 provides 222 a signal to the switch 126 to couple signals 134,<br>
136 from the second inverter phase currents to the inputs of the A/D converter<br>
124. The controller 122 then calculates the next sample time for the second<br>
phase current 224. The next sample time for the second phase current is also<br>
calculated 224 in response to a switching frequency between switching times<br>
that is an integer multiple of the base period (i.e., T2 = T2 + Tsw, where Tsw = N<br>
x Tbase)- After calculating the next sample time for the second phase current<br>
224, processing returns to determine whether it is time for the next first phase<br>
current sample time 212, time for the next second phase current sample time<br>
214, or time to power down 216.<br><br>
 Utilizing the switching times (Tsw) for calculation of both sample<br>
times and the phase shift time delay (tShm) for the second phase current sample<br>
times in accordance with the embodiment of the present invention provides for<br>
variable frequency operation while guaranteeing constant separation of the<br>
A/D converter 124 sample instants of the two independent inverters 115, 117<br>
so that the individual sample instants will never overlap. Referring to FIG. 3, a timing diagram 300 illustrates sampling<br>
times and switching frequencies defined by the operation of the controller 122<br>
in accordance with the embodiment of the present invention. The first phase<br>
current sampling times of the signals 130, 132 is shown on line 302 with a<br>
fixed switching frequency of 12 kHz, where 12 kHz is also the base period<br>
(Tbase) 304. While first phase current sampling times are shown in the timing<br>
diagram 300 as having a fixed switching frequency of 12kHz, it is well-known<br>
to those skilled in the art that the switching frequency could be varied to any<br>
integer multiple of the base period (i.e., N x Tbase) in accordance with the<br>
embodiment of the present invention without violating the separation of the<br>
A/D converter 124 sampling instants.<br>
 The second phase current sampling times of the signals 134, 136 is<br>
shown on line 306 with a phase shift time delay (tShift) 308 before the initial<br>
second inverter phase current sampling times and switching frequencies<br>
between subsequent sampling times of integer multiples of the base period<br>
(Tsw = N x Tbase)- It can be seen from the timing diagram 300 that if the<br>
switching frequencies for both the first phase current sampling times 302 and<br>
the second phase current sampling times 306 switch at the period of the<br>
maximum switching frequency (i.e., 12kHz) continuously, the sample instants<br>
will maintain constant time separation due to the phase shift time delay (tshift)<br>
308. Even when the switching period of the second phase current sampling<br>
times 306 are varied in accordance with integer multiples of the base period<br>
(Tbase), the sample instants retain at least the minimum amount of separation.<br><br>
 Thus it can be seen that the embodiment of the present invention<br>
enables two variable frequency motor controls, such as the inverters 115, 117,<br>
to be operated under the control of a single motor control processor 120 using<br>
its internal limited input A/D converter 124 while guaranteeing synchronous<br>
