DESCRIPTION<br>
'I<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a copper-based sintered alloy. More particularly, the<br>
present invention relates to a copper-based sintered alloy, which is free of Pb but<br>
exhibits improved sliding properties. I<br>
Background Technique |<br>
[0002]<br>
Pb, which is ordinarily added to the copper-alloy for sliding use, expands and is<br>
elongated on the sliding surface upon temperature rise during the shding. As a result,<br>
because Pb cools the sliding surface and simultaneously realizes its excellent selflubricating<br>
properties, seizure is, consequently, prevented. In addition, since Pb forms<br>
a soft dispersing phase, Pb has conformability and such property that foreign matters<br>
are embedded in Pb.<br>
However, Pb is liable to be corroded by acids otherj^han sjudferi^^acad. When<br>
Pb is present in the form of coarse particles in the Cu aUoy, the load ability of a bearing<br>
is lowered. Therefore, Patent Document 1 (Japanese Examined Patent Publication<br>
(kokoku) Hei 8-19945) proposes to disperse Pb in the form of fine particles expressed by<br>
a particular calculation equation. The equation can be interpreted to mean the<br>
following. The total Pb particles in the visual field of O.lmm^ (lO^Ura^ are observed.<br>
The average area ratio of these particles is converted to one particle, which is 0.1% or<br>
less. According to an example of this publication, a Cu-Pb-Sn pre-aUoy powder is used.<br>
In addition, it is described that a finer Pb structure is obtained at lower sintering<br>
temperature. It is, therefore, understood that the technique employed in this<br>
pubhcation is to suppress the precipitation and growth of Pb by low-temperature<br>
sintering.<br>
[0003]<br>
It is known from Patent Document 2 (Japanese Examined Patent Publication<br>
(kokoku) No. Hei 7-9046 that, in order to enhance the wear resistance of the sintered<br>
copper alloy, such carbides as Cr2C3, M02C, WC, VC and NbC are added in the sintered<br>
copper alloy as hard matters. According to this publication, the copper-alloy powder<br>
having from 10 to 100 M m of average particle-diameter and the hard-matter powder<br>
&gt;<br>
2<br>
having 5 to 150Mm of the average particle-diameter are mixed by a V type blender,<br>
followed by compacting and sintering. The description that Pb is present in the grain t<br>
boundaries of the copper particles (column 4, lines 21 through 22) is not inconsistent<br>
with knowledge derived from an equilibrium phase diagram, that is, Pb is hardly not<br>
dissolved in the solid Cu.<br>
[0004]<br>
A Pb-free alloy, which attains the sliding properties equivalent to the Cu-Pb<br>
based sintered aUoy, is known from Patent Document 3 (Japanese Unexamined Patent<br>
Publication (kokai) No. Hei 10-330868. It is apparent from the drawings of this<br>
publication that the location of the Bi (alloy) phase is the grain-boundary triple points<br>
and the grain boundaries in the vicinity to the triple points.<br>
[0005]<br>
It is proposed in Patent Document 4 (Japanese Patent No. 3421724) that the<br>
hard matters incorporated into the Pb or Bi phase prevent Pb and Bi from flowing out of<br>
the sintered copper alloy; the Pb or Bi phase behaves as a cushion of the hard matters,<br>
the attacking property of which against the opposite shaft is mitigated; the separated<br>
hard matters are again captured by the Pb or Bi phase, thereby mitigating abrasive<br>
wear. In this patent, the presence of the hard matters is such that they are enveloped<br>
in the Bi phase. The dimension of the Bi phase is, therefore, larger than that of the<br>
hard matters.<br>
[0006]<br>
It is disclosed in Patent Document 5 (Japanese Unexamined Patent<br>
Publication (kokai) No. 2001-220630) that an intermetalUc compound is added to<br>
enhance the wear resistance of the Cu-Bi(Pb) based sintered alloy; its micro-structure is<br>
such that the intermetallic compound is present around the Bi or Pb phase. During<br>
sliding, the intermetaUic compound is convex and the Bi or Pb phase as well as the Cu<br>
matrix are concave on the surface of copper alloy to form oil reserving portions. As a<br>
result, seizure resistance and fatigue resistance of the sliding material are improved.<br>
An example of the sintering condition proposed is from 800 to 920'C for approximately<br>
15 minutes.<br>

Disclosure of Invention<br>
Problems to be Solved by Invention<br>
[0007]<br>
Pb and Bi are hardly not dissolved in the Cu matrix of the solid Cu alloy. In<br>
addition, neither Pb nor Bi forms an intermetallic compound. Pb and Bi form,<br>
therefore, a phase different from the Cu matrix. Such micro-structure and properties<br>
are utilized as the conformability of the copper alloy for shding use. On the other hand,<br>
the Pb and Bi phases are a low-strength portion and hence incur reduction of fatigue<br>
resistance. Consequently, the low-temperature sintering proposed in Patent Document<br>
1 refines the Pb phase and is hence effective for lessening the drawbacks mentioned<br>
above. However, the low temperature required for suppressing the growth of Pb<br>
disadvantageously lowers the bonding strength of the copper alloy particles.<br>
[0008]<br>
The Bi phase in the Cu-Bi based alloys proposed in Patent Documents 3, 4 and<br>
5 results in exudation or corrosion when the alloys are used at high temperature or in<br>
the degraded oil. As a result, the Bi content is decreased to a level lower than the<br>
added amount, thereby lowering the sliding performance. In addition, Bi may be<br>
dissolved out into the lubricating oil. However, when Bi is finely dispersed, the volume<br>
of each Bi phase is so small that exudation, corrosion and decrease in the Bi amount can<br>
be suppressed. Fine dispersion of Bi and the sintering property of the copper aUoy<br>
have an opposite relationship with one another.<br>
[0009]<br>
During sintering of the Bi-containing Cu-based alloys proposed in Patent<br>
Document 4 and Patent Document 5, the Bi phase is rendered a liquid phase, into which<br>
the components of the Cu matrix are liable to diffuse and form an intermetallic<br>
compound there. The intermetallic compound is, therefore, always present at the<br>
boundaries of the Bi phase and the Cu matrix. The holding effect of the intermetallic<br>
compound by the Cu matrix is, accordingly, low. Since the desired micro-structure is<br>
not obtained by ordinary sintering, the sintering is carried out for a long period of time<br>
to obtain the desired structure in Patent Document 5. It is understood that: as a result<br>
4<br>
of the sintering for a long period of time, the size of the Bi phase becomes larger than<br>
that of hard particles as shown in Fig. 2 of Patent Document 4; and, the presence ratio<br>
of hard particles described below is almost 100%. In addition. Figure 1 of Patent<br>
Document 5 shows a high "hard matter contact ratio" described herein below. Such Bi<br>
phase is the reason that fatigue resistance and corrosion resistance of the Cu-Bi based<br>
sintered alloy are reduced.<br>
Means for Solving Problem<br>
[0010]<br>
As is described hereinabove, the conformability, fatigue resistance and<br>
corrosion resistance could not be compatible at a high level in the conventional Cu-Bi<br>
based alloy. The first invention provided taking into consideration of the above points<br>
resides in the Pb-free copper-based sintered alloy, characterized in that it has a<br>
composition containing firom 1 to 30 % by mass of Bi and from 0.1 to 10 % by mass of<br>
hard matter particles having from 10 to 50 /zm of average particle diameter, the<br>
balance consisting of Cu and unavoidable impurities, and, further, the Bi phase having<br>
smaller average particle diameter than that of the hard matter particles is dispersed in<br>
the Cu matrix. The second invention provided taking into consideration of the above<br>
points resides in the Pb-fi-ee copper-based sintered alloy, characterized in that it has a<br>
composition containing from 1 to 30 % by mass of Bi and from 0.1 to 10 % by mass of<br>
hard matter particles having from 10 to 50 Ilia of average particle diameter, the<br>
balance consisting of Cu and unavoidable impurities, and, further, the hard particles<br>
having 50% or less of a contact length ratio with the Bi phase based on the total<br>
circumferential length of the hard particle, which is in contact with said Bi phase, are<br>
present in the ratio of 70% or more based on the entire number of the hard matter<br>
particles.<br>
The present invention is described in detail hereinafter.<br>
[0011]<br>
(1) Alloy Composition<br>
When the Bi content of the Cu-Bi based sintered alloy according to the present<br>
invention is less than 1 % by mass, seizure resistance is poor. On the other hand, when<br>
the Bi content is more than 30% by mass, the strength is low and fatigue resistance is<br>
poor. The Bi content is, therefore, firom 1 to 30% by mass, and preferably from 1 to 15%<br>
by mass.<br>
In the present invention, the hard matter particles may be those proposed in<br>
Patent Document 2, but is preferably such Fe-based compound as FogP, FegP, FeB, Fe^B<br>
5<br>
and FeaB, which is well sintered with the copper alloy. Since the Fe-based compound<br>
has low wettability with Bi and on the contrary high wettability with Cu, the contact<br>
ratio of the Bi phase with the hard particles is so low that the hard particles are liable to<br>
be held by the Cu matrix. This leads to the effect that the hard particles are difficult to<br>
be separated, and, further the hard particles are difficult to fracture. Reduction of<br>
wear resistance and seizure resistance due to the separation and fracture of the hard<br>
particles mentioned above can, therefore, be suppressed. When the content of the hard<br>
matters is less than 0.1 % by mass, the seizure resistance and the wear resistance are<br>
poor. On the other hand, when the content of the hard matters exceeds 10% by mass,<br>
the strength is low, and, not only is fatigue resistance poor, but also the opposite<br>
material is abraded by the hard matters and the sintering property is lowered.<br>
Preferable content of the hard matters is from 1 to 5% by mass.<br>
The balance of the composition described herein above is unavoidable<br>
impurities and Cu. The impurities are ordinary ones. Among them, Pb is also at an<br>
impurity level.<br>
If necessary, an additive element(s) may be added to the copper alloy. For<br>
example, 0.5 % by mass or less of P may be added to lower the melting point of Cu and<br>
enhance the sintering property. When the P content exceeds 0.5% by mass, the copper<br>
alloy embrittles. From 1 to 15% by mass of Sn may be added to enhance the strength<br>
and fatigue resistance. When the Sn content is less than 1% by mass, it is only slightly<br>
effective for strengthening. On the other hand, when the Sn content exceeds 15% by<br>
mass, an intermetalUc compound is liable to form and the alloy embrittles. In addition,<br>
from 0.1 to 5% by mass of Ni may be added to enhance the strength and fatigue<br>
resistance. When the Ni content is less than 0.1% by mass, Ni is only slightly effective<br>
for strengthening. On the other hand, when the Ni content exceeds 5% by mass, an<br>
intermetaUic compound is hable to form and the alloy embrittles. These elements are<br>
alloyed in Cu and constitute the matrix of the copper alloy.<br>
In addition, such solid lubricant as M0S2 and graphite may be added in an<br>
amount of 5% by weight or less as a complex component of the copper alloy.<br>
[0012]<br>
(2) Micro-structure of Alloy<br>
In the present first and second inventions, the average particle diameter of the<br>
hard matter particles is fi-om 10 to 50;Ci m. When the average particle diameter is less<br>
than 10 Um, the hard matters are only sUghtly effective for wear resistance. On the<br>
other hand, when the average particle diameter exceeds 50 U m, the strength of the<br>
sintered copper alloy is lowered. Preferable average particle diameter of the hard<br>
6<br>
matter particles is from 15 to 30 U m.<br>
The micro-structure of the alloy according to the present invention is such that<br>
the flow of the Bi phase is suppressed to as low as possible during sintering of the<br>
copper alloy, which flow causes the contact between the hard matter particles and the Bi<br>
phase.<br>
[0013]<br>
The conclusion mentioned above is specified in the present first invention as<br>
Dsi 
circle of the Bi phase, and, further, DH is the average particle diameter of the hard<br>
matters added.<br>
[0014] ^^<br>
/TrTtiie present second inventio^the Bi phase in contact with the hard matter<br>
particles is speci5ed-as-feHows: The contact length ratio of the hard matter particles<br>
with the Bi phase based on the total circumferential length of the hard matter particle,<br>
which is in contact with said Bi phase is, 70% or less. The presence ratio of the hard<br>
matter particles having 50% or less of the contact length is 70% or more of total hard<br>
matter particles. The "contact length ratio of the hard matter particles with the Bi<br>
phase based on the total circumferential length of the hard matter particle, which is in<br>
contact with said Bi phase is referred to as "the hard matter contact ratio". When the<br>
hard matter contact ratio is 100%, one or more hard matter particles are in contact with<br>
a particular one Bi phase at the entire periphery of the hard particle(s). This readily<br>
indicates the hard matter particles are enveloped in the Bi phase. On the other hand,<br>
when the hard matter contact ratio is less than 100% but not 0, the hard matter<br>
particle(s) has necessarily a portion protruding out of the Bi phase, and this portion is in<br>
contact with the Cu alloy. In the present invention, the hard matter contact ratio is<br>
50% or less so as to decrease the contact between the hard particles and the Bi phase to<br>
as small as possible, thereby thoroughly demonstrating the respective properties of the<br>
hard particles and the Bi phase.<br>
Next, the number ratio of the hard particles having 50% or less of the hard<br>
matter contact ratio relative to the entire hard particles is referred to as "the presence<br>
ratio of hard matters". When the presence ratio of hard matters is 100%, all of the<br>
hard matter particles have 50% or less of the hard matter contact ratio. On the other<br>
hand, when the presence ratio of hard matters is 0%, all of the hard particles have more<br>
than 50% of the hard matter contact ratio. In the present invention, the presence ratio<br>
of hard matters is limited to 70% or more, because the hard particles and the Bi phase<br>
slightly in contact with one another are relatively increased, thereby thoroughly<br>
7<br>
^B<br>
demonstrating their respective properties.<br>
[0015]<br>
In order to realize the sintering process as described hereinabove, the Cu-Bi<br>
pre-alloy atomized powder or mixture of the Cu (alloy) atomized powder and the Cu-Bi<br>
alloy powder are preferably sintered for a short period by holding time of 2 minutes or<br>
less at the sintering temperature. Such short-time sintering can be carried out by<br>
means of the high-frequency sintering proposed by the present applicant in Patent<br>
Document 6 (Japanese Unexamined Patent Pubhcation (kokai) No. 2002-12902).<br>
[0016]<br>
(3) Properties of Alloy<br>
Generally speaking, in the copper-based sintered alloy according to the<br>
present invention, the Bi phase exhibits conformability. The hard matter particles are<br>
firmly held by the Cu matrix and are difficult to separate fi-om the Cu matrix. As a<br>
result, wear resistance and seizure resistance are enhanced, and strength and fatigue<br>
resistance are improved.<br>
(a) Since the Bi phase is finely dispersed in the entire sintered alloy, the<br>
properties of the material body are improved in the points of fatigue resistance,<br>
corrosion resistance and strength.<br>
(b) Since most of the hard matter particles are held by the Cu or copperalloy<br>
matrix, the material at the sliding surface exhibits improved wear resistance.<br>
(c) Improved conformabihty is attained due to the Bi phase present on the<br>
sliding surface notwithstanding the absence of Pb. ;<br>
(d) Finely dispersed Bi phase brings about improved non-adhesiveness<br>
and seizure resistance.<br>
The present invention is hereinafter described with reference to the<br>
examples.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out Invention |<br>
[0017] :<br>
s<br>
The Cu-Bi pre-alloy powder having a composition shown in Table 1 (the<br>
particle diameter - 150 /z m or less, the atomized powder) and the hard-particle powder<br>
(the average particle-diameter shown in Table 1) were mixed and sprayed on a steel ^<br>
sheet to a thickness of approximately 1 mm. The preliminary sintering was carried out<br>
in hydrogen reducing protective atmosphere at 750 - lOOO'C for 20 - 1800 seconds of<br>
the sintering time. Subsequently, the rolling and then the secondary sintering under<br>
the same conditions as the primary sintering were carried out, thereby obtaining the<br>
8<br>
sintered products. These products were used as the test samples. The sintering<br>
condition for a long period of time within the sintering-time range was intended to<br>
promote the diffusion of the Bi phase and hence to prepare the comparative samples<br>
outside the present invention.<br>
[0018]<br>
Testing Method of Seizure Resistance<br>
The surface of the copper alloy prepared by the above described method<br>
was lapped by paper to provide 1.0 p. m or less of the surface roughness (ten-point<br>
average roughness). A steel ball abutted on the so prepared sample material, and the<br>
steel ball under load was caused to slide in one direction. The steel ball after shding<br>
was observed and the area of Cu alloy adhered on the steel ball was measured. Since<br>
the material liable to adhere has poor seizure resistance, are small adhered surface<br>
indicates improved seizure resistance.<br>
Testing Machine: Stick-Slip Tester<br>
Load: 500g<br>
Material of Shaft: SUJ2<br>
Lubricating Oil: None<br>
Temperature: gradual increase from room temperature to 200'C<br>
[0019]<br>
Corrosion Resistance<br>
The surface of the test materials was finished to 1.0 A^ m of roughness, and<br>
the test materials were immersed in oil. Weight change before and after the<br>
immersion was measured. As the weight change a smaller, the corrosion resistance is<br>
better.<br>
Kind of Oil: Degraded ATF<br>
Oil Temperature: 1801:<br>
Time: 24h<br>
[0020]<br>
Fatigue Resistance<br>
The fatigue strength and the tensile strength have good co-relationship.<br>
As the tensile strength is higher, fatigue resistance is more improved. The material<br>
strength (tensile strength) was measure by a tensile test stipulated by JIS and used as<br>
an alternative property of the fatigue strength.<br>

improved, seizure resistance, fatigue resistance and corrosion resistance.<br>
Brief Explanation of Drawings<br>
[0024]<br>
[Figure 1] a photograph (200 times) showing a microscopic structure of the<br>
sintered copper alloy according to an example of the present invention.<br>
[Figure 2] a photograph (500 times) showing a microscopic structure of the<br>
sintered copper alloy according to the example of the present invention.<br>
[Figure 3] a photograph (200 times) showing a microscopic structure of the<br>
sintered copper alloy according to a comparative example.<br>
[Figure 4] a photograph (500 times) showing a microscopic structure of the [<br>
r<br>
sintered copper alloy according to the comparative example.<br>
[0025]<br>
In Figs. 1 and 2 are shown the microscopic photographs of the inventive<br>
f<br>
example No.4 at magnification of 200 times and 500 times, respectively. Similarly, in<br>
Figs. 3 and 4 are shown the microscopic photographs of the comparative example No. 3 f<br>
at the magnification of 200 times and 500 times, respectively. It is apparent that in the former Figs. 1 and 2, the contact ratio of the hard matters and the Bi phase is small, f<br>
while in the latter Figs. 3 and 4 the contact ratio of the hard matters and the Bi phase is<br>
large.<br>
Industrial Applicabihty<br>
[0026]<br>
The sintered copper alloy according to the present invention can be used for<br>
various bearings, for example AT (automatic transmission) bush and piston-pin bush. I<br>
The high levels of conformability, wear resistance, seizure resistance and fatigue f<br>
resistance achieved by the present invention are effectively utihzed for these<br>
applications. '<br>
