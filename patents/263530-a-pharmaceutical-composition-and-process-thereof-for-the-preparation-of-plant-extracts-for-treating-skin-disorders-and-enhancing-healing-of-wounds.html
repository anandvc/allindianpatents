				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of Chinese herbal medicine extracts.<br>
Specifically, the invention relates to the use of a solid-liquid separation in combination<br>
with a specific treatment for mass production of a plant extract for treating skin disorders,<br>
including enhancing the healing of wounds, especially in diabetic patients.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Plectranthus amboinicus (Lour.) Spreng, growing in Malaysia and India, is a decorative<br>
medicinal herb commonly cultivated by ordinary families. The medicinal part of<br>
Plectranthus amboinicus is the epigeal portion. Plectranthus amboinicus is also known as<br>
Cuban oregano, Indian borage, Indian mint, Mexican mint, Mexican oregano or Spanish<br>
thyme. East Indians use Plectranthus amboinicus as a fabric aromatic, and the English<br>
discovered its attractive fragrance when importing shawl fabrics from India in the 1820's.<br>
When the Plectranthus amboinicus leaves are put directly with clothing, it not only has an<br>
aromatic effect, but also prevents the clothing from being eaten by moths. It is thought to<br>
be useful for disinfection, enhancing sexual excitement and preventing insect bites. In<br>
addition, Plectranthus amboinicus may be used for treating poisonous snake bites and<br>
relieving symptoms such as headache, flatulence, vomiting, diarrhea and fever. Moreover,<br>
Plectranthus amboinicus oil is a popular perfume in Asia, and it is used in aromatherapy<br>
for improving epithelia regeneration, treating acne, and relieving the symptoms of eczema,<br>
Athlete's foot and dry cracked skin. Furthermore, Plectranthus amboinicus is a good<br>
tranquilizer and aphrodisiac that can relieve anxiety and enhance sexual desire.<br>
Various uses of Plectranthus amboinicus are reported in general magazines, but scientific<br>
studies on Plectranthus amboinicus are rarely seen in literature. US 2006/0099283 Al<br>
discloses leaf juice of Plectranthus amboinicus for treating cancer and/or tumor. USSN<br>
11/605,178, a patent application relating to the present invention, provides a<br>
pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of Plectranthus<br>
amboinicus crude extracts/extracts and a therapeutically effective amount of Centella<br>
asiatica Urban extracts.<br>
Centella asiatica Urban (pennywort) is a plant naturally growing in the coastal areas of<br>
Madagascar and the Indian Ocean.   The medicinal part of Centella asiatica Urban of the<br>
2<br><br>
Apiaceae family is its dried whole plant. Centella asiatica Urban is also known as<br>
European water-marvel, Gotu kola, Kola, Indian pennywort, Indian ginseng, Horse-hoof<br>
grass, Pegaga, Mandookaparni, Tiger herbal, Spadeleaf, or Tono. For hundreds of years,<br>
Centella asiatica Urban has been thought to be useful in the traditional medicine of Asia<br>
for improving wound healing. The extracts of Centella asiatica Urban comprise two<br>
major compounds: asiaticoside and madecassic acid. Centella asiatica Urban extracts are<br>
used to treat burns and trauma and prevent postoperative adhesion, and the preparation<br>
methods of Centella asiatica Urban extracts have been described in some patent<br>
applications. For example, US 4,318,906 and CN 1353972A disclose the medical uses of<br>
Centella asiatica Urban as the single active ingredient; US 6,475,536, US 6,267,996, CN<br>
1313124A, CN 93110425.4 and CN 1089497A disclose the use of Centella asiatica Urban<br>
in combination with other substances for cosmetic formulation, treating burns or making<br>
ointment for trauma; and US 5,834,437, US 6,417,349 and CN 1194154A disclose the<br>
methods for preparing Centella asiatica Urban extracts.<br>
Conventional separation processes for separating the components from the mixture include<br>
contacting the mixture with a nonionic absorbing resin such as DIAION® HP20, DIAION®<br>
HP20SS, Sepabeads® SP207 (Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation), Amberlite™ XAD-2<br>
(Rohm and Hass company), Amberlite™ XAD-4, and the like. The steps comprise<br>
packing the nonionic absorbing resin into a separation column, adding the mixture to the<br>
column, and eluting the column with a solvent. When such process is taken to treat a<br>
massive amount of a mixture, it is time-consuming and the elution conditions are not easily<br>
controlled.<br>
The leaf juice of US 2006/0099283 Al was obtained by grinding and removing tissue<br>
fragments and/or residues, and the different fractions of the leaf juice were separated with<br>
centrifugal filter devices.<br>
The Plectranthus amboinicus extracts of USSN 11/605,178 were prepared by utilizing a<br>
series of solvents with different polarities to elute the extracts from a chromatographic<br>
column. This method is complicated and time-consuming. There is still a need to<br>
provide a method for obtaining in large quantities the active ingredients of Plectranthus<br>
amboinicus.<br>
3<br><br>
Surprisingly, we found that a stirring method can replace the traditional column separation<br>
method and be used for mass production of Plectranthus amboinicus extracts. The<br>
stirring method is fast and the elution conditions can be easily controlled. Moreover,<br>
Plectranthus amboinicus extracts obtained by stirring separation are more effective than<br>
extracts prepared by column chromatographic separation.<br>

The Preparation Processes<br>
The invention is characterized by using solid-liquid separation (stirring separation) in<br>
combination with a specific treatment for mass production of Plectranthus amboinicus<br>
extracts in a faster manner with a higher yield. The stirring separation comprises stirring<br>
an absorbing resin, such as DIAION, into the Plectranthus amboinicus extract and<br>
separating the different fractions from the Plectranthus amboinicus extracts by differential<br>
separation steps with the utilization of different solvents. In addition to higher throughput,<br>
the Plectranthus amboinicus extract obtained by the process of the invention is more<br>
effective than that prepared by the column chromatographic separation method.<br>
The process of the invention for preparing Plectranthus amboinicus extracts comprises the<br>
steps of:<br>
-	contacting the dried Plectranthus amboinicus leaves with a leaf extracting<br>
solvent to obtain a Plectranthus amboinicus crude extract;<br>
concentrating the Plectranthus amboinicus crude extract; and<br>
-	treating the concentrated Plectranthus amboinicus crude extract using a<br>
stirring separation method to obtain a Plectranthus amboinicus extract.<br>
According to the invention, the stirring separation method comprises the following steps:<br>
(a) diluting the concentrated Plectranthus amboinicus crude extract with a<br>
high-polarity solvent, mixing the diluted Plectranthus amboinicus crude<br>
extract with an absorbing resin, and stirring the absorbing resin and the<br>
diluted Plectranthus amboinicus crude extract;<br>
7<br><br>
(b)	removing the liquid portion, extracting the resin with distilled water, and<br>
collecting the first extract;<br>
(c)	extracting the resin with a sub-high-polarity solvent and collecting the second<br>
extract;<br>

extract; and<br>
(e)	extracting the resin with a low-polarity solvent and collecting the fourth<br>
extract.<br>
In one embodiment, the process for preparing Plectranthus amboinicus extracts comprises<br>
the steps of:<br>
1.	contacting dried Plectranthus amboinicus leaves with a leaf extracting solvent<br>
for about 30 to about 100 hours to obtain a Plectranthus amboinicus crude<br>
extract;<br>
2.	concentrating the Plectranthus amboinicus crude extract;<br>
3.	diluting  the   concentrated  Plectranthus  amboinicus  crude  extract  with  a<br>
high-polarity solvent and mixing the diluted Plectranthus amboinicus crude<br>
extract with an absorbing resin by stirring for about 10 to about 30 hours;<br>
4.	removing the liquid portion;<br>
5.	dipping the resin in distilled water for about 1 to about 7 hours to obtain a first<br>
extract (PA-W1);<br>
6.	mixing and stirring the resin with a sub-high-polarity solvent for about 1 to about<br>
7 hours to obtain a second extract (PA-W2);<br>
7.	mixing and stirring the resin with a medium-polarity solvent for about 1 to about<br>
7 hours to obtain a third extract (PA-W3);<br>
8.	mixing and stirring the resin with a low-polarity solvent for about 1 to about 7<br>
hours to obtain a fourth extract (PA-W4).<br>
According to the process of the invention, the leaf extracting solvent is selected from, but<br>
not limited to, water and alcohols. In one embodiment, the alcohol is ethanol. The ratio<br>
of the volume of the leaf extracting solvent to the weight of the dried Plectranthus<br>
amboinicus leaves is about 6:1 to about 15:1, or about 10:1.<br>
8<br><br>
According to the process of the invention, the leaf extract obtained in step 1 may be<br>
concentrated by any conventional concentration methods for solutions, such as using a<br>
pressure-reducing rotary evaporator.<br>
According to the process of the invention, the absorbing resin is selected from, but not<br>
limited to, DIAION® HP20, DIAION® HP20SS, Sepabeads® SP207, Amberlite™ XAD-2,<br>
Amberlite™ XAD-4, and the like, or the DIAION® series. In one embodiment, the<br>
absorbing resin is DIAION® HP20. In addition, the DIAION®HP20 resin can be<br>
pre-treated with methanol.<br>
According to the process of the invention, the ratio of the volume of the high-polarity<br>
solvent to the weight of the dried Plectranthus amboinicus leaves is about 8:1 to about 4:1,<br>
or about 5:1; the ratio of the volume of the sub-high-polarity solvent to the weight of the<br>
dried Plectranthus amboinicus leaves is about 8:1 to about 4:1, or about 5:1; the ratio of the<br>
volume of the medium-polarity solvent to the weight of the dried Plectranthus amboinicus<br>
leaves is about 8:1 to about 4:1, or about 5:1; and the ratio of the volume of the<br>
low-polarity solvent to the weight of the dried Plectranthus amboinicus leaves is about 8:1<br>
to about 4:1, or about 5:1.<br>
According to the process of the invention, the extraction period of step 1 is about 30 to<br>
about 100 hours, or about 50 to about 80 hours, or more than about 72 hours. The<br>
absorption period of step 3 is about 10 to about 30 hours, or about 17 to about 25 hours, or<br>
more than about 20 hours. The extraction period of step 5 is about 1 to about 7 hours, or<br>
about 1 to about 4 hours, or about 1 hour. The extraction period of step 6 is about 1 to<br>
about 7 hours, or about 1 to about 4 hours, or about 1 hour. The extraction period of step 7<br>
is about 1 to about 7 hours, or about 1 to about 4 hours, or about 1 hour. The extraction<br>
period of step 8 is about 1 to about 7 hours, or about 1 to about 4 hours, or about 1 hour.<br>
Furthermore, according to the process of the invention, stirring is conducted at the speed of<br>
about 3 to about 15 rpm, or about 5 to about 10 rpm, or 7 rpm.<br>
The process of the invention is a high-throughput method for mass production of<br>
Plectranthus amboinicus extracts. The process is about five times faster than the column<br>
chromatographic separation method to extract the active fractions from Plectranthus<br>
amboinicus.<br>

efficacy in enhancing healing of wounds than the ointment comprising the Centella<br>
asiatica Urban extract alone, the ointment comprising the Plectranthus amboinicus extracts<br>
prepared by the traditional column chromatographic separation method in combination<br>
with the Centella asiatica Urban extract, or other conventional drugs for enhancing wound<br>
healing (shown in the examples below). The amounts of the fourth Plectranthus<br>
amboinicus extract and the Centella asiatica Urban extract in the ointment are about at<br>
least 0.01% and about at least 0.1% by weight, respectively. In an embodiment, the<br>
amount of the fourth Plectranthus amboinicus extract is about 0.01% to about 5%, or about<br>
0.1 % to about 1 %, or about 0.25% to about 1 %, by weight of the ointment. The amount of<br>
the Centella asiatica Urban extract is about 0.1% to about 20%, or about 0.5% to about 9%,<br>
or about 1% to about 3%, by weight of the ointment. In an embodiment, the weight ratio<br>
between the fourth Plectranthus amboinicus extract and the Centella asiatica extract is<br>
about 1:60 to about 1:4.<br>

E.	The Plectranthus amboinicus extracts<br>
The Plectranthus amboinicus extracts used in the biological assays were prepared by the<br>
preparation process of the invention (the stirring separation method) and a column<br>
chromatographic separation method. The details of the preparation are described in the<br>
following preparation examples.<br>
Example 1. Preparation of Plectranthus amboinicus Extracts by Stirring Separation<br>
Method<br>
800g of dried Plectranthus amboinicus leaves was dipped in a 95% alcohol having a<br>
volume ten-fold to the total weight of the dried leaves for 72 hours, and then the leaf extract<br>
was filtrated. The extraction procedure was repeated. The two leaf extracts were mixed<br>
to obtain a Plectranthus amboinicus crude extract and the crude extract was concentrated<br>
by a pressure-reducing rotary evaporator (Heidolph LABOROTA 4000, Eleya N-N series)<br>
to reduce the volume of the crude extract to about 5% of the original volume (i.e., to about<br>
one-half of the original weight of dried leaves).<br>
The Plectranthus amboinicus crude extract was diluted with a high-polarity solvent to a<br>
volume ten-fold to the original one. The diluted Plectranthus amboinicus crude extract<br>
was added into a bucket-like container containing DIAION® HP20 resin which was<br>
pre-treated by using methanol. The resin and the extract in the container were stirred at a<br>
speed of 3 to 10 rpm overnight. The fluid was then poured from the container. Double<br>
distilled water having a volume five-fold to the total weight of the dry leaves was added to<br>
the container. The resin was dipped in the water by stirring once in a while for one hour<br>
and the fluid was collected. The collected fluid (PA-W1) was concentrated and dried to<br>
obtain 2.4g of dried product with a yield of 0.3%.<br>
A sub-high-polarity solvent having a volume five-fold to the total weight of the dry leaves<br>
was further added to the container with the resin. The resin was dipped in the solvent by<br>
stirring once in a while for one hour and the fluid was collected. The process was repeated<br>
twice. The extracted fluids were mixed (PA-W2) and then concentrated and dried to<br>
obtain 4g of dried product with a yield of 0.5%.<br>
15<br><br>
A medium-polarity solvent having a volume five-fold to the total weight of the dry leaves<br>
was further added to the container with the resin. The resin was dipped in the solvent by<br>
stirring once in a while for one hour and the fluid was collected. The process was repeated<br>
twice. The extracted fluids were mixed (PA-W3) and then concentrated and dried to<br>
obtain 6g of dried product with a yield of 0.75%.<br>
A low-polarity solvent having a volume five-fold to the total weight of the dry leaves was<br>
further added to the container with the resin. The resin was dipped in the solvent by<br>
stirring once in a while for one hour and the fluid was collected. The process was repeated<br>
three times. The extracted fluids were mixed (PA-W4) and then concentrated and dried to<br>
obtain 7.52g of dried product with a yield of 0.94%.<br>
Example 2. Preparation of Plectranthus amboinicus Extracts by Column<br>
Chromatographic Separation Method<br>
DIAION resin having a weight identical to that of the dried Plectranthus amboinicus leaves<br>
was dipped in methanol and packed into a chromatographic column. The packed DIAION<br>
resin was then washed with methanol having a volume one- to two-fold to the total weight<br>
of the DIAION resin, and subsequently washed with double distilled water having a<br>
volume five- to six-fold to the total weight of the DIAION resin.<br>
800g of dried Plectranthus amboinicus leaves was dipped in 95% alcohol having a volume<br>
ten-fold to the total weight of the dried leaves for 24 hours. After filtration, the leaves<br>
were further dipped in 95% alcohol having a volume ten-fold to the total weight of the<br>
dried leaves for 24 hours. The Plectranthus amboinicus extract fluids were mixed and<br>
concentrated by a pressure-reducing rotary evaporator to reduce the volume to about 2-3%<br>
of the original volume.<br>
The extract obtained from the preceding steps was diluted with distilled water and loaded<br>
into the DIAION resin column. The column was eluted with a high-polarity solvent<br>
having a volume ten-fold to the total weight of the dried leaves. An eluted fraction<br>
(PA-C1) was collected and the yield was 0.38%.<br>
16<br><br>
The column was then eluted with a sub-high-polarity solvent having a volume five- to<br>
ten-fold to the total weight of the dried leaves. An eluted fraction (PA-C2) was collected<br>
and the yield was 0.5%.<br>
The column was eluted again with a medium-polarity solvent having a volume five- to<br>
ten-fold to the total weight of the dried leaves. An eluted fraction (PA-C3) was collected<br>
and the yield was 0.78%.<br>
Finally, the column was eluted with a low-polarity solvent having a volume five- to<br>
ten-fold to the total weight of the dried leaves. An eluted fraction (PA-C4) was collected<br>
and the yield was 0.67%.<br>

Ointments Comprising Centella asiatica Urban Extract (SI) and Plectranthus amboinicus<br>
Extracts.<br>
Suitable amounts of ointment base, PA-W4 extract and PA-C4 extract were measured.<br>
The ointment base was preheated in a water bath at about 50C until softened and added<br>
into beakers containing the PA-W4 extract and the PA-C4 extract to obtain a 0.25%<br>
PA-W4 ointments and a 0.25% PA-C4 ointment. The weight ratio of the ointment base to<br>
the Plectranthus amboinicus extracts was 99.75:0.25. The obtained ointments were then<br>
mixed with Centella asiatica Urban extract (SI) in a weight ratio of 99:1 to obtain a<br>
DCR-WH1-W ointment (1% SI + 0.25% PA-W4) and a DCR-WH1-C ointment (1% SI +<br>
0.25% PA-C4).<br>

Biological Assays<br>
Example 5.     Animal Experiments for Wound Closures in Diabetic Rats<br>
[Animal experiments]<br>
Induction of high blood sugar in the animals<br>
Rats with a body weight of over 300g were administered with Streptozotocin (STZ, 65<br>
mg/kg, i.p.) to induce high blood sugar.   Rats with successfully induced high blood sugar<br>
(over 300mg/DL) were selected to conduct the wound closure tests two months after<br>
high-blood-sugar syndromes appeared.<br>
Trauma surgeries for the diabetic animals<br>
i.	The high-blood-sugar animals with a body weight of lower than 300g were<br>
eliminated and the rest were randomized into 6 groups,<br>
ii.        The animals were anesthetized with pentobarbital and the hair on the surgical<br>
area (dorsal area) was removed.    The surgical areas and instruments were then<br>
sterilized with 75% alcohol before operation.<br>
iii.       The skins on the dorsal medium areas (4, 6 and 8 cm from the midpoint of two<br>
scapula) were excised (full thickness) using a round cutting blade with a diameter of 1<br>
cm.<br>
Measuring the wounds, applying testing materials, and preventing the wounds from<br>
being scratched<br>
i.	A standard ruler was placed beside the wounds and pictures were taken,<br>
ii.	A thin layer of the test materials formulated as ointments and 0.05 ml of<br>
CGS21680 solution were applied to each wound,<br>
iii.	The wounds were covered with gauze and hoods were worn on the rats' necks.<br>
Test materials were applied to the rats twice a day (morning and evening) and the wounds<br>
were measured at each time point.<br>
19<br><br>
After the experiments were finished, the regenerated skins were taken for biochemistry and<br>
histology analysis.<br>
[Wound area analysis]<br>
A standard ruler was placed beside the wounds when pictures were taken. The length of<br>
the wounds was standardized according to the scale of the standard ruler in the pictures<br>
before the wounds were analyzed with the image processing software Image-Pro (Media<br>
Cybernetics, Inc.) to avoid the errors caused by different picturing distances.<br>
[Data analysis and statistics]<br>
The areas of the three wounds on the rats' backs were analyzed by Image-Pro. The wound<br>
areas of day zero were the original wound areas. The original wound areas minus the<br>
wound areas at different time points were divided by the original wound areas to get the<br>
wound closure percentages. The mean of the three wound closure percentages of each rat<br>
represents the wound closure of each rat. Four to seven rats per group were used for each<br>
test materials. The data was shown as mean ± standard error (SEM). The p-values of the<br>
test results were calculated by t-test in statistics software sigma statis (Systat software Inc.).<br>
