				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The object of the invention is a hair care product consisting of transparent, pressure-resistant aerosol packaging, a device for foaming a composition contained in the aerosol packaging, and a foaming composition of at least two clear liquid phases separated from each other. The composition contains water; water-soluble liquid alcohols; hair-conditioning, hair-setting, or film-forming polymers; hair-conditioning cationic surfactants; foam-forming or foam-stabilizing, nonionic or non-cationic ionogenic surfactants; as well as water-insoluble, liquified aerosol propellants.<br>
Hair treatment agents that are released as a foam from pressurized gas packaging are known and are also characterized as aerosol foams, foam aerosols, styling foams, conditioning foams, or mousse. The products primarily consist of pressurized packaging, a foam head, a liquid, aqueous active ingredient phase, and a liquified propellant phase. Normally, these products require opaque packaging, for example, made of metal or opaque plastic because, at the interface between the liquified propellant phase and the active ingredient phase, a non-homogenous, non-cosmetic-like, and unattractive-looking, turbid, smear-forming substance forms due to interactions from the propellant, active ingredients, and the additives, and/or there can be turbidity from one or both phases due to the synergy of the commonly used ingredients. Transparent packaging is desirable, however, due to the simple visual recognition of the fill level, the simple visual recognition of sufficient phase mixing after shaking before use, the recognition of a color design in the ingredients if applicable, as well as the fact that transparent products are generally more attractive.<br>
Clear, two-phase, foam-forming aerosol hair-care products are known from EP 1 169 998 A2. The products have two clear liquid phases that are distinctly separate from one another. A particularly distinct phase separation, which can even be reestablished after shaking, is obtained by adding a water-soluble salt to the hydrophilic phase and by adding a water-insoluble hydrophobic substance, which is soluble in the liquified propellant, with said substance being oil and fat in particular. The addition of salts as well as oils and fats that is necessary for the phase separation can cause undesirable influences. Thus, the additives can have a "heavying" effect,<br>
particularly when applied to fine hair, which also makes the manufacture of volume products for fine hair difficult. The additives can also sometimes be softeners for the hair setting polymers, which impedes the manufacture of styling products with strong holds. Omitting the additives, however, reduces the quality of phase separation to an undesirable level.<br>
Thus, the task arose of how to provide a transparent hair product that could exist under pressure to form foam; the product would also need to have phase separation between the liquified propellant phase and the water-containing active ingredient phase that is reversible after shaking and recognizable from the outside; the product would also need to enable the production of volume and styling products with satisfactory volume and setting effects and also be producible with absolutely no or a very small amount of salts and hydrophobic fats or oils.<br>
The object of the present invention is a hair care product consisting of transparent, pressure-resistant aerosol packaging, a device for foaming a composition contained in the aerosol packaging and a foamable composition of at least two clear liquid phases separated from each other, wherein the composition contains<br>
(A)	water;<br>
(B)	at least 15 wt%, based on the composition without propellant, of a water-soluble<br>
liquid alcohol;<br>
(C)	at least one polymer selected from the hair-conditioning polymers, the hair-setting<br>
polymers, and the film-forming polymers;<br>
(D)	at least one hair-conditioning cationic surfactant;<br>
(E)	at least one foam-forming or foam-stabilizing surfactant, selected from the group<br>
consisting of nonionic surfactants, with an HLB value of at least 10 and<br>
zwitterionic surfactants;<br>
(F)	at least one water-insoluble propellant that is liquified under the pressure<br>
conditions in the aerosol packaging.<br>
The compositions according to the present invention distinguish themselves by an increased alcohol content of at least 15 wt%. Although the quality of the phase separation can be improved with increasing alcohol content, the foam quality normally is worsened because the alcohols act as foam inhibitors. Good phase separation as well as good foam quality can be obtained by the simultaneous choice of the alcohol quantity and suitable selection of the<br>
surfactants (E) according to the present invention without influencing the volume or styling effects of the product to any significant extent.<br>
Both liquid phases are clear in the sense of the invention if no turbidity or smearing can be seen with the naked eye. The phases are liquid in the sense of the-invention if they are flowable. This applies both to liquids when viewed from a more physical perspective as well as fluid gels that automatically flow downwards when placed at an angle (45°) at 20 °C (68 °F). Both phases are separated from each other in the sense of the invention if they only form one single, horizontal interface. After shaking, this interface completely reestablishes itself preferably within 24 hours or less. It is preferred if the phases are distinctly separate from each other, i.e. no border layer but instead only a separating line can be seen between the phases or the separating line between the phase is less than 1 mm (0.039 in) and preferably less than 0.1 mm (0.0039 in). Foamable compositions are those that form stable foam for at least a short period (e.g. 30 seconds at a minimum) using suitable devices for foaming such as aerosol packaging with a foam head.<br>
Hydrophilic  phase  solvent<br>
Water and water-soluble alcohols are the primary solvents. The water content is preferably from 50 to 75 wt%, with 55 to 75 wt% being especially preferred, based on the composition without aerosol propellant. The alcohols are liquid and water-soluble at room temperature (25 °C (77 °F)), i.e. it is preferable if at least 20 g (0.71 oz) or at least 50 g (1.76 oz) are soluble in 100 ml (3,38 oz); unlimited solubility is particularly preferred. The alcohols used can be those lower monovalent alcohols with 1 to 4 C atoms that are customarily used for cosmetic purposes such as ethanol and isopropanol or polyvalent alcohols with 2 to 5 C atoms such as ethylene glycol, glycerin, propylene glycol, butylene glycol, or pentanediol. Ethanol, either as the sole alcohol or in a mixture with ethylene glycol, glycerin, or propylene glycol, is particularly preferred. The alcohol content is at least 15 wt%, with 20 to 35 wt% being preferred, and 20 to 30 wt% being particularly preferred, each instance based on the composition without aerosol propellant. The hydrophilic phase is preferably in a pH range of from 2 to 8, with a pH of from 4 to 7 being particularly preferred. In the event that a zwitterionic surfactant is used as the foam-forming or foam-stabilizing surfactant, then the pH value is preferably greater than 3.5, and particularly greater than 4.0. The foam quality can be impaired with a low pH value of about 3 due to the cationic character of the zwitterionic surfactant, which can then be too strong. An acid range can be set with a cosmetically compatible organic or inorganic acid such as formic acid, tartaric acid, malic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, pyrrolidone carboxylic acid, citric acid, lactic<br>
acid, sulfuric acid, acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and phosphoric acid among others. A basic pH range can be set with suitable organic or inorganic bases, e.g. amino alcohols such as aminomethylpropanol (AMP), triethanolamine, monoethanolamine, or tetrahydroxypropyl ethylenediamine as well as ammonia, NaOH, KOH, and others.<br>
The composition of the product according to the invention contains at least one hair-setting and/or hair-conditioning and/or film-forming polymer. The polymers are preferably present in a quantity of from 0.01 to 20 wt% or from 0.5 to 10 wt%, with a wt% of from 1 to 8 being particularly preferred. These polymers can be anionic polymers, in other words, polymers with anionic or anionizable groups, or cationic polymers, in other words, polymers with cationic or cationizable groups, or zwitterionic polymers, in other words, polymers with cationic and anionic groups, or amphoteric polymers, in other words, polymers with acidic and basic groups, or nonionic polymers. Anionizable groups are understood to be acid groups such as, for example, carboxylic acid, sulfonic acid, or phosphoric acid groups, which can be deprotonated by means of conventional bases such as, for example, organic amines or alkaline or alkaline earth hydroxides. Groups that can be cationized are basic groups such as primary, secondary, or tertiary amine groups that can be protonated using typical acids. Those polymers that are sufficiently soluble in water/alcohol mixtures are preferred in order to provide the completely dissolved form in the hydrophilic phase according to the present invention.<br>
Film-forming polymers are, in particular, those polymers listed in the International Cosmetic Ingredient Dictionary and Handbook, 9th edition, with the function of "Film Formers" and/or polymers that are capable of leaving a polymer film on the hair when used in a 0.01 to 5% aqueous, alcohol, or aqueous alcohol solution. Hair-setting polymers are, in particular, those polymers listed in the International Cosmetic Ingredient Dictionary and Handbook, 9lh edition, with the function of "Hair Fixatives." Hair-conditioning polymers are, in particular, those materials listed in the International Cosmetic Ingredient Dictionary and Handbook, 9th edition, with the function of "Hair Conditioning Agents," provided that polymers are meant. Examples of polymers in the sense of the invention are listed below.<br>
Anionic polymers can be partially or completely neutralized with a basic neutralizing agent. A preferred degree of neutralization is from 50 to 100 %, and 70-100% is especially preferred. An organic or inorganic base can be used as the neutralizing agent. Particular examples<br>
of bases are amino alkanols such as, for example, aminomethylpropanol (AMP), triethanolamine or monoethanolamine, and also ammonia, NaOH, and KOH among others.<br>

The cationic surfactants (D) are contained in the composition of the product according to the present invention preferably in a quantity of from 0.01 to 10 or from 0.05 to 5, with 0.1 to 2.5<br>
wt% being especially preferred, based on the composition without aerosol propellant. Suitable cationic surfactants are, in particular, surfactants that have a substantivity to human hair based on cationic groups or those that can be cationized, particularly protonated amine groups or quaternary ammonium groups.<br>
Suitable cationic surfactants are, particularly, those of the general formula<br>
wherein Rl to R4, independently from one another, represent aliphatic groups, aromatic groups, alkoxy groups, polyoxyalkylene groups, alkylamido groups, hydroxyalkyl groups, aryl groups, or alkaryl groups with 1 to 22 C atoms, and wherein at least one of the residues Rl to R4 possesses at least 8 C atoms and Xw represents an anion, e.g. a halogen, acetate, phosphate, nitrate, or alkylsulfate, but preferably a chloride. The aliphatic groups can also contain cross linkages or other groups such as additional amino groups in addition to the carbon and hydrogen atoms.<br>
Examples of suitable cationic surfactants are the chlorides or bromides of alkyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium salts, alkyl trimethyl ammonium salts, for example, cetyltrimethylammonium chloride or bromide, tetradecyltrimethyl ammonium chloride or bromide, alkyldimethyl hydroxyethyl ammonium chlorides or bromides, the dialkyldimethyl ammonium chlorides or bromides, alkylpyridinium salt, for example, lauryl or cetylpyridinium chloride, alkylamido ethyl trimethyl ammonium ether sulfates, as well as compounds with cationic character such as amine oxides, for example, alkyl methyl amine oxides or alkyl amino ethyl dimethyl amine oxides. Especially preferred is cetyltrimethylammonium chloride.<br>
Foam-forming   and  f o a m - s t a b i 1 i z i n g   surfactants<br>
The foam-forming and foam-stabilizing surfactants strengthen the foam capacity of the composition of the present invention, i.e. they increase the volume and/or the stability of the foam created when the product is released from the aerosol packaging, despite the high alcohol content. They are present in a quantity of preferably 0.1 to 5 wt%, with 0.5 to 3 wt% being preferred, based on the composition without aerosol propellant.<br>
The surfactants (E) are selected from nonionic surfactants with an HLB value as classified by Griffin that is greater than or equal to 10, but is preferably in a range of from 11 to<br>
15, as well as from zwirterionic surfactants. Preferred nonionic surfactants are alkylpolyglucosides (APG). These are acetal-linked glucosides that can be present as mono-, di-, or oligoglucosides or a mixture thereof. They can be manufactured as a homogenous mixture via an acidic catalyzed reaction (Fischer reaction) from glucose, starch, or n-butyl glucosides with fatty alcohols. This results in complex mixtures of alkyl monoglucoside, alkyl diglucosides, and alkyl oligoglucosides (particularly triosides and tetraosides) with e.g. 8 to 22, 8 to 20, or preferably 10 to 16 C atoms in the alkyl group. The average degree of polymerisation is normally between 1 and 3, e.g. between 1.2 and 1.5. The HLB values are normally above 10 and can vary between 11 and 15 due to variation in the hydrophobic group and/or the degree of polymerisation. APGs are known under the EsTCI designations Coco-Glucoside, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Cetearyl Glucoside, Decyl Glucoside, Lauryl Glucoside, and Myristyl Glucoside.<br>
Zwitterionic surfactants are surfactants with at least one quaternary ammonium group and at least one anionic group, selected from carboxylate, sulfate, sulfonate, phosphate, and phosphonate groups, e.g. compounds of the general formula<br>
wherein Rl represents a linear or branched alkyl, alkenyl, or hydroxyalkyl group with from 8 to 22 C atoms and from 0 to 10 ethylene oxide units and from 0 to 1 glycerol units or a fatty acid amidoalkylene group with 8 to 22 C atoms in the fatty acid group and from 1 to 4, preferably 2 or 3, C atoms in the alkylene group; R2 is an alkyl, hydroxyalkyl, or carboxyalkyl group with from 1 to 4 C atoms; A is an alkylene or hydroxyalkylene group with from 1 to 4 C atoms and 0 or 1 hydroxy groups, and Z represents a carboxylate, sulfate, phosphonate, or phosphate group. Zwitterionic phosphate surfactants are, e.g. known under the INCI designation Sodium Lauroampho PG-Acetate Phosphate.<br>
Zwitterionic surfactants with abetaine structure are preferred, e.g. those of the formula<br>
wherein R means a fatty alkyl residue with from 8 to 22 C atoms or a fatty alkyl amido alkylene residue with from 8 to 22 C atoms in the fatty alkyl group and from 1 to 3 C atoms in the alkylene group, and wherein x means the numbers 1, 2, or 3. These types of surfactants are known under<br>
the INCI designations Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Cocamidoethyl Betaine, Lauramidopropyl Betaine, Stearamidopropyl Betaine, Cetyl Betaine, Lauryl Betaine, Oleyl Betaine, Stearyl Betaine, or Coco-Betaine.<br>
Zwitterionic surfactants with a sultaine structure are .also preferred, e.g. those of the formula<br>
wherein R means a fatty alkyl residue with from 8 to 22 C atoms or a fatty alkyl amido alkylene residue with from 8 to 22 C atoms in the fatty alkyl group and from 1 to 3 C atoms in the alkylene group, and wherein A means an alkylene or hydroxyalkylene group with 1, 2, or 3 C atoms. These types of surfactants are known under the INCI designations Cocamidoproyl Hydroxysultaine, Lauramidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Coco-Sultaine, Lauryl Sultaine, and Lauryl Hydroxysultaine.<br>
Aerosol   propellants<br>
The aerosol propellants according to the present invention are hydrophobia materials that are gaseous under normal conditions, i.e. at normal pressure (1,013 mbar) and ambient temperature (20 °C (68 °F)), are present in liquified form when filled under pressure, and are at least partially insoluble in the hydrophilic phase and therefore form a second, hydrophobia liquid phase. Considered suitable are, particularly, C3 and C4 hydrocarbons such as propane, isobutane, n-butane, or mixtures thereof, as well as fluorohydrocarbons such as F 152 (1,1-difluoroethane) or F 134 (tetrafluoroethane). Mixtures with hydrophilic, partially water-soluble aerosol propellants, such as dimethylether, are also possible provided they are not used as the sole aerosol propellant because otherwise the second phase would not form. Pure dimethylether also has the disadvantage that it is not compatible with the especially preferred packaging materials made from transparent plastic, particularly polyethylene terephthalate. The container wall can become soft and unstable due to the dimethylether; materials can be extracted from the container wall, or the diffusion of ingredients from the active ingredient solution can go into or through the container wall. Especially preferred are mixtures of propane and butane, as well as mixtures of propane, butane, and dimethylether.<br>
The quantity of aerosol propellants used is preferably selected so that, after filling, the pressure in the aerosol packaging is a maximum of 3 bar, with a maximum of 2.7 bar at 20 °C (68<br>
°F) being especially preferred, and/or the fill ratio of propellant-free composition to aerosol propellant is in the range of from 80:20 to 97:3, with 85:15 to 95:5 being preferred.<br>
The product according to the present invention is packaged in suitable, pressure-resistant aerosol packaging and has, as an additional component, a device for foaming the composition contained in the packaging, wherein said device enables the foaming of the composition when propellant is used. As a suitable foaming device, for example, a commercially available aerosol foaming head can be used. The packaging is made of transparent material, through which the consistency, the fill level, the color of the composition, and the degree of mixing or the separation of the two liquid phases are recognizable. Possible materials for the packaging are, for example, glass and transparent, pressure-resistant plastics, wherein plastics are preferred for reasons of cost and weight. Especially preferred is polyethylene terephthalate.<br>
Coloring   of  the   phases<br>
Fortunately, both of the liquid phases can be colored with one or two different colorants of different types. The resulting compound color that is present during the shaking before use is a visual indicator of a mixture that is sufficient for use. In this process, water-insoluble, oil-soluble colorants are used in the hydrophobic phase, and oil-insoluble, water-soluble, or colorants soluble in water/alcohol mixtures are used in the hydrophilic phase.<br>
Additional   additives<br>
The composition according to the present invention can further contain any additive components that are conventional for hair treatment agents, for example, preservatives, solubilizing agents, perfume oils, scents, thickeners, pH buffering agents, conditioning agents such as, for example, plant and herb extracts, protein and silk hydrolysates, photo-protective agents, antioxidants, radical scavengers, anti-dandruff ingredients, shine enhancers, vitamins, softeners, agents to improve combing, etc.<br>
To reduce the heavying effect, particularly with fine hair, the composition according to the present invention is preferably free of salts and oil or fatty type substances, particularly nonvolatile substances, or it contains these substances in very small quantities, e.g. less than 0.5 or less than 0.05 wt%.<br>
An especially preferred embodiment is a product for which the material of the aerosol packaging is made of polyethylene terephthalate, and the composition contains<br>
(A)	50 to 75 wt% water;<br>
(B)	20 to 30 wt% ethanol;<br>
(C)	0.5 to 10 wt% of at least one cationic, nonionic, amphoteric, or zwitterionic<br>
polymer, selected from hair-conditioning polymers, hair-setting polymers, and<br>
film-forming polymers;<br>
(D)	0.05 to 5 wt% of at least one hair-conditioning cationic surfactant;<br>
(E)	0.1 to 5 wt% of at least one foam-forming or foam-stabilizing surfactant, selected<br>
from alkylpolyglucosides with an HLB value of at least 10 and zwitterionic<br>
surfactants of the general formula<br>
wherein Rl represents a linear or branched alkyl, alkenyl, or hydroxyalkyl group<br>
with from 8 to 22 C atoms and from 0 to 10 ethylene oxide units and from 0 to 1<br>
glycerol units or a fatty acid amidoalkylene group with from 8 to 22 C atoms in the<br>
fatty acid group and from 1 to 4, preferably 2 or 3, C atoms in the alkylene group;<br>
R2 is an alkyl, hydroxyalkyl, or carboxyalkyl group with from 1 to 4 C atoms; A is<br>
an alkylene or hydroxyalkylene group with from 1 to 4 C atoms and 0 or 1 hydroxy<br>
groups, and Z represents a carboxylate, sulfate, phosphonate, or phosphate group;<br>
wherein the quantities are based on the composition without aerosol propellant, and the composition<br>
is filled with aerosol propellants, selected from propane, butane, and mixtures thereof, and wherein<br>
the quantity ratio of propellant-free composition to aerosol propellant is in the range of 80:20 to<br>
97:3, and the pressure in the aerosol packaging is a maximum of 3 bar at 20 °C (68 °F).<br>
The product according to the present invention is manufactured by firstly dissolving the components soluble in the hydrophilic phase in the hydrophilic solvent. Before the aerosol propellant is filled, the components that are soluble in the hydrophobic phase are added. Finally, the aerosol propellant is filled, and the aerosol packaging is pressure sealed.<br>
The product can be used as a rinse or as a leave-in. The cosmetic agent according to the present invention is used in that it is applied to the washed hair as a foam and distributed in a quantity sufficient to achieve the desired hair styling effect depending on the amount of hair and<br><br>
the condition of the hair (typically about 3 -10 g (0.11 - 0.35 oz)). After an action period (e.g. 3 -6 minutes), it can be rinsed out. The agent can also stay in the hair and the hair is then dried. The object of the invention is thus also a method for hair treatment, wherein<br>
-	a foam is created using an aforementioned product according to the present<br>
invention;<br>
-	this foam is either applied to freshly washed, damp hair, or to dry hair and<br>
distributed throughout the hair;<br>
-	the composition applied to the hair is left in the hair or rinsed out with water after<br>
an action time and<br>
-	then the desired hairstyle is produced.<br>
The product according to the present invention can particularly be used to create volume and/or hold for the human hairstyle.<br>
The following examples should serve to illustrate further the object of the present invention.<br>
Examples<br>
The compositions named below are filled into pressure-resistant containers made of transparent polyethylene terephthalate and then filled with propellent (propane/butane 2,7 bar) in a ratio of 9:1. The containers have foaming heads and are sealed.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
With all the examples, a soft, microporous foam forms with each release that remains compact for at least about 2 minutes. Both in a non-shaken condition as well as 24 hours after shaking, a clear phase separation of two liquid phases forms.<br>
Example   5<br><br>
