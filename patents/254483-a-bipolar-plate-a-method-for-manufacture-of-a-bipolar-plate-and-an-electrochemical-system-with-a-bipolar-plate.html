				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a bipolar plate, to a method for its manufacture<br>
as well as to an electrochemical system containing the bipolar plate, as for<br>
example a fuel cell system or an electro-chemical compressor system.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Electrochemical compressor systems may e.g. be electrolysers which by way of<br>
applying a potential, apart from producing e.g. hydrogen and oxygen from water<br>
also simultaneously compress these under pressure.<br><br>
Apart from these, electrochemical compressor<br>
systems are also known such as e.g. electrochemical<br>
hydrogen compressors to which gaseous molecular<br>
hydrogen is supplied, and this is electrochemically<br>
compressed by way of applying a potential. This<br>
electrochemical compressing particularly lends itself<br>
for low quantities of hydrogen to be compressed since<br>
a mechanical compression of the hydrogen here would be<br>
significantly more complex.<br>
Electrochemical systems are known with which an<br>
electrochemical cell stack is constructed with a<br>
layering of several electrochemical cells which in<br>
each case are separated from one another by way of<br>
bipolar plates. At the same time, the bipolar plates<br>
have several tasks:<br>
to electrically contact the electrodes of the<br>
individual electrochemical cells, e.g. fuel<br>
cells, and to lead the current further to the<br>
adjacent cell (series connection of the cells),<br>
to supply the cells with media, e.g. reaction<br>
gases, and to lead away reaction products via a<br>
gas distribution structure (flowfield),<br>
to lead away the waste heat which arises on<br>
production in the electrochemical cells, as well<br>
as<br>
to mutually seal the various media channels and<br>
cooling channels, mutually and to the outside.<br><br>
For the supply and removal of media from the<br>
bipolar plates to the actual electrochemical cells,<br>
wherein these e.g. are MEAs (membrane electrode<br>
assemblies, i.e. membrane electrode units) with a gas<br>
diffusion layer (e.g. of a metal or carbon nonwoven)<br>
which in each case is orientated towards the bipolar<br>
plates, the bipolar plates may have openings for<br>
cooling or for the supply and removal of media.<br>
In known fuel cells systems, the gas distribution<br>
is effected along the MEA by way of channel and<br>
meander structures on both sides of the bipolar plate.<br>
The design of the channel structures at the same time<br>
is chiefly directed to an optimisation of the gas<br>
distribution on the side facing the MEA. Above all<br>
with metallic bipolar plates, from this arises the<br>
problem that the distribution and leading of the<br>
cooling water between the individual plates results<br>
only in the cavities arising there by way of<br>
connection, as a consequence of the embossed channel<br>
structures of the gas distribution regions. A targeted<br>
distribution/leading of the cooling water by way of<br>
this is not ensured in very case. Furthermore the<br>
operational safety of fuel cell systems may also be<br>
compromised due to the fact that fine channel<br>
structures, e.g. by way of forming water, become<br>
blocked and thus the leading e.g. of gaseous media is<br>
prevented so that the efficiency e.g. of the fuel cell<br>
system is reduced.<br><br>
Furthermore, on account of the channel structures<br>
of known bipolar plates, which in part are quite<br>
complex, one requires extensive embossing tools for<br>
their manufacture.<br>
The prior-published US 2003/0162078A1 shows a<br>
fuel cell arrangement with a bipolar plate of the<br>
generic type for electrochemical systems which<br>
contains a first plate with a first flowfield for<br>
distribution of media as well as a second plate with a<br>
second flowfield for the distribution of media,<br>
wherein the first plate in the region of the first<br>
flow field at least in regions comprises a plane<br>
surface section from which discrete projections which<br>
are distanced from one another and which are arranged<br>
in a distributed manner project.<br>
It is therefore the object of the present<br>
invention to provide an electrochemical system<br>
containing a bipolar plate, or a method for its<br>
manufacture, wherein in comparison to the state of the<br>
art, advantages with regard to inexpensive<br>
manufacturing ability and operational safety are to be<br>
accomplished, and in particular, a simple and safe<br>
supply of coolant is to be achieved.<br>
This object is achieved by way of the subject-<br>
matter of the independent claims, specifically a<br>
bipolar plate according to the invention, its use<br>
according to the invention, and a method for its<br>
manufacture according to the invention or an<br>
electrochemical system according to the invention.<br><br>
The bipolar plate according to the invention for<br>
electrochemical systems comprises a first plate with a<br>
first flowfield for the distribution of media and a<br>
second plate with a second flowfield for the<br>
distribution of media. With this, the first plate in<br>
the region of the first flowfield at least in regions<br>
has a plane surface section from which linear or<br>
discrete projections which are distanced from one<br>
another and which are arranged in a distributed manner<br>
project.<br>
This applies at least to the first plate, but of<br>
course these projections according to the invention<br>
are also simultaneously possible for the first and<br>
second plate. It is advantageous for such a bipolar<br>
plate to be manufactured in that firstly the first as<br>
well as the second plate which preferably consist of a<br>
sheet metal are provided with projections and/or<br>
channel structures by way of inexpensive manufacturing<br>
methods such as roller embossing, punching,<br>
hydroforming, eddy current embossing etc., and<br>
subsequently the first and the second plate on the<br>
sides which are opposite to the channel structures<br>
and/or projections are connected to one another or<br>
joined by way of the methods of soldering, bonding or<br>
laser beam welding.<br>
This permits an inexpensive manufacturing<br>
ability, in particular for high-volume operation, and<br>
discrete projections which are distanced to one<br>
another, project from a plane surface section and are<br><br>
distributed over the surface or in a uniform manner<br>
may be manufactured in a particularly simple manner.<br>
Thus with simple embossing methods these as a rule may<br>
be manufactured in a single cycle (run) since no<br>
shaping procedures which are complicated and are<br>
expensive with regard to material need to be<br>
accomplished, as for example is the case with the<br>
manufacture of U-shaped channel structures or with the<br>
manufacture of complicated meandering structures.<br>
The subject-matter of the invention is thus a<br>
metallic bipolar plate for fuel cells of two embossed<br>
plates of which at least one plate may have a punched<br>
structure; the other on the other hand e.g. may also<br>
have a straight-line channel structure. By way of<br>
connecting the two plates into a bipolar plate, a<br>
channel system for a cooling medium arises between the<br>
plates, and on the outer surfaces in each case a<br>
structure for distributing the reaction gases, which<br>
is adapted to the gas flows in the fuel cell. This<br>
arrangement is particularly suitable for fuel cell<br>
systems with a low operating pressure as well as for<br>
fuel cell stacks with which the air supply of the<br>
cells is effected outside the actual stack (so-called<br>
external air supply or so-called "self-breathers").<br>
The embossing of the plates is simplified by way of<br>
the application of simple, repetitive structures. The<br>
adaptation of the distributor structure to different<br>
sizes and shapes of plate is simple and possible<br>
within large ranges.<br><br>
A particularly advantageous aspect of the<br>
invention lies in the fact that by way of the<br>
combination of projections on the first plate or<br>
channel structures on the second plate (or also<br>
combinations of projections on the first and second<br>
plate) a cavity may be designed between the first and<br>
the second plate, so that here a targeted leading of<br>
the coolant is possible without having to negatively<br>
influence the channel characteristics of the<br>
flowfield.<br>
For this, the invention envisages the second<br>
plate comprising the channel structures and the<br>
projections on the first plate as well as the channel<br>
structures on the second plate being arranged in a<br>
manner such that a cavity for introducing coolant is<br>
formed between the first and the second plate, said<br>
cavity e.g. being arranged at a through-opening of a<br>
fuel cell stack which for example runs perpendicular<br>
to the plate planes of the fuel cell stack.<br>
With this, it is particularly advantageous for<br>
the projections on the first plate and the<br>
corresponding channel structures on the second plate<br>
to be designed such that the projections form a cross-<br>
over (connecting passage) of cooling fluid from a<br>
first channel of the channel structure to a second<br>
channel of the channel structure. This for example is<br>
the case if regions which are unconnected to one<br>
another, e.g. grooves lying next to one another, are<br>
formed on the second plate, which are not connected to<br>
one another in a fluid-conducting manner. Here, by way<br><br>
of the joining of the first plate to the second, it<br>
occurs that the projections form quasi "bridges" or a<br>
cross-over (connection) from e.g. one groove to an<br>
adjacent groove. I.e., that the cooling fluid crosses<br>
[over] the middle of the plane of the plate when it,<br>
by way of the projections, changes from a first cavity<br>
of a first groove into the cavity of the second<br>
groove, crossing this middle of the plate plane.<br>
As such quasi infinite coolant flow paths may be<br>
predetermined without this having to result in a<br>
complicated media distributor structure prone to fail,<br>
on the flowfield on the fuel cell side.<br>
By way of the suggested simplification of the<br>
distributor structures to repetitive, simple geometric<br>
shapes, the manufacture of metallic bipolar plates is<br>
to be simplified (e.g. by way of roller embossing) . It<br>
is also conceivable for the flowfield to be produced<br>
by several embossing steps with which the tool is<br>
offset and multiple identical structures are<br>
reproduced on the plate. Furthermore a possibility it<br>
to be found by way of which the coolant flow within<br>
the plate may be designed in a more homogeneous and<br>
variable manner.<br>
The system is preferably designed as a low<br>
pressure system, i.e. for the supply of gas flows one<br>
does not require a gas compressing (compacting) which<br>
is energy-intensive, since the reaction gases close to<br>
atmospheric pressure are led through the stack with<br>
fans or pumps having a low power. Due to the low power<br><br>
requirements for the periphery of the stack, such a<br>
system is of particular interest for mobile<br>
applications since here a high net output of the whole<br>
system is decisive. By way of the skilful combination<br>
of e.g. H-punch designs and channel structure on the<br>
respective sides of the bipolar plate, one may carry<br>
out a defined distribution of the coolant by way of<br>
which a homogeneous removal of heat is rendered<br>
possible. It has been shown that a uniform cooling is<br>
decisive for a reliable and high output of the fuel<br>
cell. The combination of punch and channel structure<br>
suggested here permits a large scope for play in the<br>
design of the leading of the coolant. The cooling<br>
water which is distributed in the straight-lined<br>
channels (rear side of the cathode plate) in the<br>
transverse direction is led further to the next<br>
straight-lined channel in the longitudinal direction<br>
via the connection webs of the e.g. H-punch (rear side<br>
of the anode plate). By way of the targeted<br>
arrangement of the H-punch on the anode plate<br>
therefore one may optimally guide the coolant flow<br>
along the bipolar plate, adapted to the requirements<br>
of the fuel cell.<br>
A multitude of advantages result by way of the<br>
use of simple geometric shapes as gas distribution<br>
structures, and these advantages simplify the<br>
manufacturability of the bipolar plates or help in<br>
increasing the output capability of the fuel cell.<br>
The flowfield in large regions may be adapted to<br>
the size and shape of the bipolar plate by way of the<br><br>
simple, repetitive distribution structures. The most<br>
various of punch shapes are conceivable. At the same<br>
time the punches apart from their shape may also be<br>
adapted to the requirements in the cell with regard to<br>
their height structure.<br>
The recurring structures are well suitable for<br>
continuous embossing methods (e.g. roller embossing)<br>
since the material indent on embossing is low and at<br>
the same time is effected uniformly. Furthermore the<br>
structures may be easily [re-] shaped since tight<br>
windings may be avoided (U-turns) .<br>
In particular the punch structures create an<br>
increased stiffness of the gas distribution<br>
structures, by which means a pressing-together of the<br>
gas distributors given a high stack pressing is<br>
avoided. Furthermore the uniformly and variably<br>
distributable structures permit an adaptation to the<br>
required pressing of the active regions (MEA) of the<br>
fuel cell, by which means the transition resistances<br>
between the components may be minimised. Furthermore<br>
by way of the variability of the punch structures, the<br>
contact points between the two individual plates may<br>
be adapted with respect to the position and<br>
distribution, by which means the joining of the two<br>
plates into a bipolar plate is significantly<br>
simplified, and finally the bipolar plate may be<br>
optimised with respect to stability and contact<br>
resistance between the plates.<br><br>
By way of incorporating orthogonally arranged<br>
transverse channels of a small height between the<br>
longitudinal channels of the cathode side, one may<br>
incorporated "flow interrupters" into the air<br>
channels, by which means the output of the air<br>
electrode is increased. Thus however further<br>
possibilities of leading the coolant in the inside of<br>
the bipolar plate result.<br>
The combination of punch and channel structure<br>
suggested here is above all suitable for systems which<br>
are to operate with low fuel gas pressures. The gas<br>
channels or possible gas paths which are present in<br>
multiple on the anode as well as the cathode lead to a<br>
low susceptibility with respect to an accumulation of<br>
condensed water on the electrode. In particular the<br>
punch flowfield is suitable for fuel cells which are<br>
operated without continuous hydrogen flow-through<br>
(systems with a very high H2 conversion, e.g.&gt; 90-<br>
95%) . The simple linear channel system on the cathode<br>
permits the supply of the stack from the outside (so-<br>
called external air supply or manifold) by way of fans<br>
or blowers. By way of the replacement of the pumps and<br>
compressors which are otherwise required with internal<br>
air supply, the consumption of the stack periphery may<br>
be significantly reduced and the total of efficiency<br>
of the system may be increased.<br>
Advantageous further formations are specified in<br>
the dependent claims.<br><br>
One advantageous embodiment of the bipolar plate-<br>
according to the invention envisages the first plate<br>
to comprise projections for distributing a fuel medium<br>
such as for example molecular hydrogen on the anode<br>
side of a fuel cell, and the second plate of the<br>
bipolar plate to comprise channels for distributing<br>
media such as for example air or oxygen on the cathode<br>
side of the bipolar plate. On the anode side it is<br>
particularly the formation of discrete structures<br>
which offers the advantage that e.g. more than 90-95%<br>
of the introduced hydrogen is actually consumed.<br>
Firstly by way of the discrete structures which permit<br>
several flow directions and thus a large-surfaced<br>
distribution, a clogging of the structure e.g. by way<br>
of fluid accumulation may be avoided. Furthermore by<br>
way of the fact that the hydrogen is practically<br>
completely consumed and no unconsumed hydrogen needs<br>
to be led away, a so-called "dead-end" arrangement may<br>
be constructed which merely prepares a.supply for the<br>
hydrogen but which does not require a return etc. for<br>
the hydrogen.<br>
One further advantageous embodiment of the<br>
bipolar plate envisages the second plate likewise<br>
comprising channel structures, wherein these at least<br>
in regions are formed linearly or in a channel-like<br>
manner. Thus e.g. it becomes possible to design a<br>
multitude of grooves lying parallel and individually<br>
next to one another, which do not create a complex,<br>
e.g. meandering structure, but individual channels<br>
lying next to one another and separate from one<br>
another. The channel structures at the same time may<br><br>
also have height differences, i.e. that the depth of<br>
the channel structures is different or the extent of<br>
the projection of the channel structures perpendicular<br>
to the smooth plane is different. Thus preferably<br>
standard heights in the range of constant 0.3 to 0.7<br>
mm beyond the plane of the plate may arise (this<br>
measure relates to the largest height of the channel<br>
structures with respect to the non-deformed plane<br>
plate). Here however variations in height may be<br>
possible in order e.g. to create "flow interrupters"<br>
and as a whole a supply of the fuel cells with<br>
operating media which is over an as large as possible<br>
surface and which is uniform becomes possible.<br>
The projections according to the invention, which<br>
project from a plane surface section of a plate of the<br>
bipolar plate, may have different shapes. Thus it is<br>
possible for these projections in a plan view of the<br>
plane of the plate to have the shape of a C, of an I,<br>
of a U, of an L, of an H, of an X, of a V or e.g. of<br>
an O. Here it is the case of structures which may be<br>
easily represented, are composed of simple strokes and<br>
which with regard to manufacturing technology may be<br>
easily manufactured. It is preferably such that<br>
projections of the same type which discretely project<br>
from the surface section are essentially distributed<br>
uniformly over the plane surface section. Thus e.g. on<br>
a previously pure plane surface of 100 cm2, after the<br>
embossing of the projections which are distanced<br>
discretely from one another, for example 150 to 220<br>
projections are incorporated, wherein of the original<br>
100 cm , 18 to 25 cm2 are covered by projections and<br><br>
the remaining area exhibits a pure plane surface<br>
section.<br>
Here it is favourable that the projections with<br>
regard to their highest extension, i.e. perpendicular<br>
to the plate planes, the furthest distanced surfaces<br>
with respect to the surface of the plane surface<br>
section, have a height of 0.3 to 0.7 mm, preferably<br>
0.4 to 0.6 mm. At the same time it is of course also<br>
possible for the projections in turn to have height<br>
differences. By way of this and by way of the slightly<br>
reduced projections it is possible here that the<br>
effective contact surface here e.g. towards the<br>
polymer electrolyte membrane of the fuel cell is<br>
increased or for a flow interruption in the flowfield<br>
to take place which likewise serves for an improved<br>
exploitation of the media.<br>
It is advantageously possible for the projections<br>
on the first plate and the corresponding channel<br>
structures on the second plate to be designed such<br>
that one or more cooling circuits are formed in the<br>
hollow space for introducing cooling fluid. Thus e.g.<br>
it is possible to connect parts of the channel<br>
structure or the entirety of the channel structures<br>
into a large cooling circuit by way of a suitable<br>
connecting passage by way of projections on the first<br>
plates. It is moreover possible to provide individual<br>
different coolant regions or to design meandering<br>
cooling circuits interlaced within them.<br><br>
It is particularly advantageous for the bipolar<br>
plate according to the invention for the bipolar plate<br>
to be of a metallic material such as steel, stainless<br>
steel, nickel, aluminium or titanium, wherein for<br>
reasons of costs for example corrosion-free sheet<br>
steel lends itself. In the condition of the bipolar<br>
plate being ready installed, here the first or the<br>
second plate in each case has a thickness of 0.1 to<br>
0.6 mm, preferably 0.075 to 0.3 mm.<br>
It is simply possible to provide this first and<br>
second plate with projections or channel structures by<br>
way of embossing, punching, hydroforming or eddy<br>
current embossing, and subsequently to connect the<br>
first and second plate to one another.<br>
The possible uses of the plate according to the<br>
invention are specified by way of example in the use<br>
claim. Thus the plate as a "media distribution plate"<br>
lends itself for the most varied of electrochemical<br>
systems such as electrochemical compressors, but also<br>
for fuel cell systems, even for high temperature fuel<br>
cell systems. The specific use of the term "bipolar<br>
plate" is not absolutely compelling. Thus it is not<br>
absolutely necessary for all uses indeed for different<br>
electrical poles to be given at the two large surfaces<br>
of the bipolar plate which point away from one<br>
another. Thus it may so to speak be the case of a<br>
monopolar plate. A particularly useful and far-<br>
reaching application however would always be the field<br>
of low-pressure polymer electrolyte membrane fuel<br>
cells.<br><br>
Thus for example the system according to the<br>
invention envisages this to be a polymer electrolyte<br>
membrane system with at least one fuel cell, wherein<br>
this at least one fuel cell consists of an electrolyte<br>
membrane which preferably has gas diffusion layers on<br>
both sides, on whose side distant to the polymer<br>
electrolyte membrane, flowfields of bipolar plates are<br>
arranged.<br>
This fuel cell may for example be designed in a<br>
self-breathing manner with surrounding air, for<br>
example on the cathode side. Additional ventilation<br>
such as by way of a blower may also be effected. On<br>
the anode side of the fuel cell on which preferably<br>
the projections according to the invention are<br>
arranged, it is likewise the question of an<br>
inexpensive and "self-regulating" manner for the<br>
consumption of molecular hydrogen, since this is led<br>
via one or more supply conduits into the<br>
electrochemically active region of the fuel cell, but<br>
on account of the relatively favourable exploitation<br>
of this combustion gas it is not necessary to lead<br>
away uncombusted H2. Thus it is also possible to<br>
provide the above described "dead-end" design. The<br>
advantage of a correspondingly constructed fuel cell<br>
is the relatively low operating pressure, the absence<br>
of complicated control electronics and a higher H2<br>
conversion. At the same time the efficiency of the<br>
fuel cell system is further increased by way of the<br>
inventive leading of the coolant.<br><br>
The invention is now explained by way of several accompanying figures. There<br>
are shown in<br>
Figure 1 an electrochemical system according to the invention,<br>
Figure 2 a series of various possible shapes for the projections according to the<br>
invention,<br>
Figures 3a and 3b plan views of the first and second plate of a bipolar plate,<br>
Figures 4a and 4b possible flow paths of coolant in a bipolar plate according to<br>
the invention.<br>
Figure 1 shows an electrochemical system according to the invention with the<br>
example of a fuel cell system. This comprises a first fuel cell 6.1 as well as a<br>
second fuel cell 6.2 which is separated from this by way of a bipolar plat e 1. The<br>
fuel cells 6.1 and 6.2 here consist of a centrally arranged polymer electrolyte<br>
membrane (e.g. obtainable under the trade name NAFION of the company<br>
DuPont) which mostly is covered on both sides with a gas diffusion layer. In each<br>
case an anode side of the fuel cell is shown on left side of the membrane, (e.g.<br>
6.1a for the fuel cell 6.1), and one cathode side is shown on the right side (e.g.<br>
6.2b for the fuel cell 6.2).<br><br>
A bipolar plate 1 according to the invention is<br>
provided between the fuel cells 6.1 and 6.2. This<br>
consists of a first plate 2 as well as of a second<br>
plate 3. The first plate 2 has a first flow field 2a<br>
and the second plate 3 has a second flowfield 3a.<br>
These flowfields are suitable for distribution of<br>
media, particularly for distributing gaseous media on<br>
the anode or cathode side. The first flowfield 2a here<br>
ensures that an as uniform as possible distribution of<br>
molecular hydrogen to the adjacent fuel cell 6.1 is<br>
effected on the anode side 6.1a, wherein this fuel<br>
cell-is designed as a so-called "dead-end" system<br>
which on the anode side 6.1a only contains supply<br>
conduits but no return conduits for unused gaseous<br>
hydrogen.<br>
Here the flowfield extends over the<br>
electrochemically active surface of the fuel cell 6.1<br>
so that here a uniform distribution of media of the<br>
medium applied here (molecular hydrogen) is effected.<br>
The cathode side 6.2b of the fuel cell 6.2 is<br>
shown on the oppositely lying side of the fuel cell of<br>
the bipolar plate 1. Here too the flowfield extends<br>
over the electrochemically active region of the fuel<br>
cell 6.2. On the cathode side however the space is not<br>
closed to the surroundings in a gas-tight manner. Here<br>
it is the case of a "self-breathing" fuel cell which<br>
obtains its oxygen itself from the surrounding air. It<br>
is of course possible to achieve an increase of the<br>
air throughput additionally by way of a blower. As a<br><br>
whole it may be ascertained that the system shown<br>
here, which operates with low pressure, on the one<br>
hand has a high efficiency and on the other hand is to<br>
be operated with a low expense with regard to control<br>
technology, and in an operationally secure manner. The<br>
efficiency of the fuel cell system may here be<br>
increased even further in that the introduction of<br>
cooling fluid is effected in a cavity 8 which is<br>
incorporated between the first plate 2 and the second<br>
plate 3, said cooling fluid reducing the operating<br>
temperature of the fuel cells and thus increasing the<br>
energy efficiency.<br>
The bipolar plate 1 is once again explained in<br>
more detail. Here it is the case of a bipolar plate 1<br>
for electrochemical systems, which contains a first<br>
plate 2 with a first flowfield 2a for media<br>
distribution as well as a second 3 with a flowfield 3a<br>
for media distribution, wherein the first in the<br>
region of the first flowfield at least in regions has<br>
a plane surface section 4 from which discrete<br>
projections 5 distanced to one another project<br>
arranged in a distributed manner.<br>
Here it is the case of a polymer electrolyte<br>
membrane system with at least one fuel cell (6.1),<br>
wherein this at least one fuel cell consists of an<br>
electrolyte membrane which preferably has gas<br>
diffusion layers on both sides, on whose side distant<br>
to the polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) the<br>
flowfields of at least one bipolar plate are arranged.<br><br>
Fig. 2 shows various embodiments of possible<br>
projections which extend distributed in a surfaced<br>
manner surface on the flowfield 2a discretely and<br>
distanced to one another. These have the shape for<br>
example of a "U" which may be open towards various<br>
directions (see the four first example profiles from<br>
the left). An "0"-shaped structure is subsequent to<br>
this fifth from the left, finally and "X"-shaped one<br>
and completely to the right a "V"-shaped' one.<br>
These projections here may each be easily<br>
manufactured since here it is the case of structures<br>
constructed from "rod shapes". The rods shown in Fig.<br>
2 may also each have different heights. By way of this<br>
the gas flow to the electrode arranged on the anode<br>
side is simplified. Of course the examples for the<br>
projections shown in Fig. 2 are not conclusive. The<br>
projections may be designed e.g. C-shaped, I-shaped or<br>
L-shaped or comprise other simple geometric<br>
structures.<br>
Figs. 3a and 3b in each case show plan views of a<br>
bipolar plate 1 according to the invention.<br>
With this (Fig. 3a), the outer side (i.e. the<br>
side facing the anode side) of the first plate 2 is<br>
shown in the plan view. This plate 2 in the edge<br>
region comprises a seal which is not shown in more<br>
detail as well as, at the corners, in each case with<br>
an elongate hole shape, interface channels for passage<br>
of media. Centrally, a flowfield 2a is shown, which<br>
extends over the surface of the electrochemically<br><br>
active region of the fuel cell 6.1 in an essentially<br>
rectangular manner. The supply conduit of a fuel gas<br>
such as e.g. molecular hydrogen is effected via gas<br>
supply openings which are shown at the top left or at<br>
the bottom right. The flowfield 2a is designed<br>
essentially as a plane surface section 4 from which<br>
discrete projections 5 distanced to one another<br>
project arranged distributed over a large surface.<br>
These discrete projections are arranged at a regular<br>
distance to one another and have essentially the shape<br>
of the letter "H". Approx. 200 projections are given<br>
on 100 cm2 of surface of the flowfield. The minimum<br>
distance of these projections is preferably between<br>
0.5 mm and 3 mm. The surface of the flowfield covered<br>
by projections ( this is to be understood as surface<br>
at which already the smallest of projections exist,<br>
thus everything which does not belong to the plane<br>
surface section) here is 20% to 40% preferably 20 to<br>
25% of the total area of the flowfield.<br>
The projections projecting out of the plane of<br>
the sheet, proceeding from the plane surface section 4<br>
have a maximal height at their uppermost location of<br>
0.3 to 0.7 mm, preferably 0.4 to 0.6 mm.<br>
Fig. 3b shows a second plate 3 which comprises<br>
channel structures 7. These channel structures 7 are<br>
designed as straight-lined channels lying next to one<br>
another and which are unconnected to one another. Here<br>
it is the case of quasi groove-like formations lying<br>
next to one another. These channel structures which<br>
normally project 0.3 to 0.7 mm with respect to the<br><br>
plane base (i.e. the flat surface of the second plate,<br>
0.3 to 0.7 is preferably the normal height here) may<br>
also have different heights.<br>
The first and second plates shown in Figs. 3a and<br>
3b are rigidly connected to one another at their sides<br>
distant to the projections or channel structures. The<br>
first and second plate at the same time are each<br>
designed of sheet steel. The thickness of the first or<br>
second plate in the flat unshaped section is 0.1 to<br>
0.2 mm. The first and second plate here have been<br>
manufactured by roller embossing or punching from a<br>
flat sheet steel, and subsequently a joining of the<br>
first and second plate on the sides opposite to the<br>
channel structures or projections was effected<br>
preferably by way of soldering, bonding or laser beam<br>
welding etc.<br>
Figs. 4a and 4b show details of the cavity 8<br>
which is formed between the first plate 2 and the<br>
second plate 3 and which represents a closed cavity<br>
for leading a cooling fluid for cooling the bipolar<br>
plate 1. Here thus the second plate 3 comprises<br>
channel structures 7, and the projections 5 on the<br>
first plate as well as the channel structures 7 on the<br>
second plate are arranged in a manner such that a<br>
cavity is formed between the first 2 and the second 3<br>
plate for introducing cooling fluid.<br>
Here Figs. 4a and 4b show a "through-view"<br>
through the bipolar plate 1, somewhat in the context<br>
of an X-ray picture, wherein the possible flow paths<br><br>
in the indicated cavities are in each case indicted<br>
with arrows.<br>
Here Fig. 4a shows the flow paths with a bipolar<br>
plate 1 which comprise plates according to Figs. 3a<br>
and 3b. Here the first plate comprises "H"-shaped<br>
sections shown in Fig. 3a, wherein the second plate<br>
(see Fig. 3b) comprises groove-like sections lying<br>
next to one another, thus e.g. a first groove-like<br>
channel 7.1 and a second groove-like channel 7.2. Here<br>
the perpendicular members of the "H" are distanced to<br>
one another by the same distance as the first channel<br>
7.1 or the second channel 7.2, so that the position<br>
shown in Fig. 4a partly overlap. By way of this it<br>
becomes possible for fluid led in the first channel<br>
7.1 to be led via the transverse member of the "H" in<br>
the first channel 7.1 into the second 7.2 without<br>
exiting from the cavity 8. With the arrangement shown<br>
in Fig. 4a, it is thus possible to distribute the<br>
fluid in the cavity 8 of the bipolar plate 1 over<br>
quite a large space and in a uniform manner. By way of<br>
the targeted arrangement of the H-punches on the anode<br>
plate thus in a sample manner the coolant flow may,<br>
adapted to the requirements of the fuel cell, be led<br>
along the bipolar^ gl^e in an optimised manner in the<br>
X or Y-direction.	1<br>
fi<br>
* ^#»' Here therefore it is the'case of a bipolar plate,<br>
wherein the projections 5 on the first plate 2 and<br>
corresponding channel structures 7 on the second plate<br>
3 are designed such that the projections 5 form a<br>
connecting passage of cooling fluid from a first<br><br>
Finally Fig. 4b shows a further embodiment of the<br>
shaping of the cavity of a bipolar plate according to<br>
the invention. Here a meandering leading of the<br>
coolant is shown in Fig. 4b on the left side. For<br>
this, again groove-like channels lying next to one<br>
another are shown (which also have height variations<br>
for interrupting the flow), which are connected to one<br>
another at sporadic locations by way of connection<br>
webs 10 (the connection webs 10 here are formed by<br>
"I"-shaped projections 5 on the first plate 2) . On the<br>
left side in Fig. 4b, here a meandering leading of<br>
coolant is shown, wherein a single meander structure<br>
is given which forms a cavity 8 which in its entirely<br>
is closed.<br>
A further possibility is shown in Fig. 4b on the<br>
right side. Here by way of another arrangement of the<br>
projections 5 which e.g. are designed as "I" shaped<br>
projections 10, another manner of leading the coolant<br>
is rendered possible. Here, two meander structures are<br>
formed which show separate cooling circuits. Thus 8.1<br>
shows a cooling circuit which is separate from 8.2,<br>
wherein these in turn may be interlaced in one<br>
another.<br>
Thus here a bipolar plate is shown, wherein the<br>
projections on the first plate 2 and the corresponding<br>
channel structures 7 on the second plate 3 are<br>
designed such that one or more cooling circuits 8.1,<br><br>
8.2 are formed in the cavity for introducing cooling<br>
fluid.<br>
A further considerable advantage of the bipolar<br>
plate according to the invention for electrochemical<br>
systems which contains a first plate with a first<br>
flowfield for media distribution as well as a second<br>
plate with a second flowfield for media distribution,<br>
wherein the first plate in the region of the first<br>
flowfield at least in regions comprises a plane<br>
surface section, from which discrete projections which<br>
are distanced to one another project arranged in a<br>
distributed manner, is the fact that these projections<br>
may be designed projecting purely from one side. By<br>
way of this it is possible to use particularly simple<br>
and inexpensively manufacturing embossing dies for the<br>
individual plates, which are also simple in handling,<br>
since as is not the case with plates embossed on both<br>
sides - with a flat mounting of the plate in any case<br>
one projection needs to be loaded, but the plates may<br>
be deposited on the "stable" flat side.<br>
By way of embossing in each case in one<br>
direction, the thinnest possible bipolar plate is<br>
achieved with an equal functionality. Furthermore by<br>
way of the embossing in only one direction one thus<br>
creates a bipolar plate which is as thin as possible<br>
and thus a saving in volume without influencing the<br>
functional safety.<br><br>
