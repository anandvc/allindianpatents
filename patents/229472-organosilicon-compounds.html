				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Organosilicon Compounds<br>
The present invention relates to organosilicon compounds, a<br>
process for their production, as well as their use.<br>
Polysulfane-alkyltrialkoxysilanes, such as for example<br>
bis [3-triethoxysilylpropyl]tetrasulfane or bis [3-<br>
triethoxysilylpropylldisulfane, and mercaptoalkyltrialkoxy-<br>
silanes, such as for example 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxy-<br>
silane or 3-mercaptopropyltriethoxysilane, are used as<br>
coupling agents between inorganic materials, for example<br>
glass fibres, metals or oxidic fillers, and organic<br>
polymers, for example thermosetting materials,<br>
thermoplastic materials and elastomers (Angew. Chem. 98,<br>
(1986) 237-253).<br>
These coupling agents/bonding agents form stable, chemical<br>
bonds with the filler as well as with the polymer and<br>
thereby produce a good interaction between the filler<br>
surface and the polymer. They reduce the mixture viscosity<br>
and facilitate the dispersion of the filler during the<br>
mixing procedure.<br>
Furthermore it is known that the use of commercially<br>
available silane coupling agents (DE 22 55 577) with three<br>
alkoxy substituents on the silicon atom leads to the<br>
release of considerable amounts of alcohol during and after<br>
the binding to the filler. Since as a rule trimethoxy-<br>
substituted and triethoxy-substituted silanes are used, the<br>
corresponding alcohols methanol and ethanol are released<br>
during the application (Berkemeier, D.; Hader, W.; Rinker,<br>
M.; Heiss, G. 'Mixing of silica compounds from the<br><br>
viewpoint of a manufacturer of internal mixers', Gummi,<br>
Fasern, Kunststoffe (2001), 54(1), 17-22).<br>
It is also known that methoxy-substituted and ethoxy-<br>
substituted silanes are more hydrolsis-active the<br>
corresponding long-chain alkoxy-substituted silanes (E.R.<br>
Pohl, F.D. osterholtz J.:Adhesion Sci. Technology 6(1)<br>
1992, 127-149) and accordingly can bind more rapidly to the<br>
filler, which means that from the economic aspect it has<br>
not been possible up to now to dispense with the use of<br>
methoxy-substituted and ethoxy-substituted silanes.<br>
Organosilicon compounds of the general formula [RO(R'O)2Si-<br>
R"]nXm and [R`O (RO)2Si-R``]nXm are known from DE 10163941.<br>
A serious disadvantage in the use of known coupling agents<br>
based on alkoxysilanes is the release of stoichiometric<br>
amounts of volatile alcohols, such as for example methanol<br>
and ethanol, into the environment during and after the<br>
binding of the alkoxysilane to the filler.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide<br>
organosilicon compounds that are not able to release<br>
volatile alcohols during the binding to the filler and that<br>
at the same time retain the high reactivity with respect to<br>
the filler.<br>
The present invention accordingly provides organosilicon<br>
compounds of the general formula I<br><br><br>
in which R are identical or different and denote an R'O<br>
group or C1-C12-alkyl group, preferably a methyl or ethyl<br>
group,<br>
R`are identical or different and denote a C12-C24 branched<br>
or unbranched single-bond alkyl or alkenyl group, aryl<br>
group, aralkyl group or R`3Si, where R``` denotes a C1-C30<br>
branched or unbranched alkyl or alkenyl group, aralkyl<br>
group or aryl group, preferably C1-C8,<br>
R`` is a branched or unbranched, saturated or unsaturated,<br>
aliphatic, aromatic or mixed aliphatic/aromatic double-bond<br>
C1-C30 hydrocarbon group,<br>
X denotes SH where n=l and m=l, SCN where n=l and m=l, or S<br>
where n=2 and m=l-14, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The organosilicon compounds according to the invention of<br>
the general formula I may for R preferably contain one or<br>
two alkyl groups.<br><br>
Organosilicon compounds according to the invention of the<br>
formula I may be<br>
R`` may denote CH2, CH2CH2, CH2CH2CH2, CH2CH2CH2CH2, CH2(CH3),<br>
CH2CH (CH3) , CH (CH3) CH2, C (CH3) 2, CH2 (C3H5) , CH2CH2CH (CH3 ) ,<br>
CH2CH(CH3)CH2<br><br><br>
where y is identical or different and denotes a number from<br>
12 to 24, or mixtures of the individual silanes mentioned<br>
above.<br>
Organosilicon compounds according to the invention of the<br>
formula I may be<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Condensation products, in other words oligosiloxanes and<br>
polysiloxanes, may readily be formed from the silanes<br>
according to the invention of the formula I. The<br>
oligosiloxanes and polysiloxanes may be obtained by<br>
oligomerisation or co-oligomerisation of the corresponding<br>
alkoxysilane compounds of the general formula I by addition<br>
of water, and addition of additives and adoption of the<br>
preparation procedure known to the person skilled in the<br>
art in this field.<br>
These oligomeric or polymeric siloxanes of the compounds of<br>
the formula I may be used as coupling reagents for the same<br>
applications as the monomeric compounds of the formula I.<br>
The organosilicon compounds according to the invention may<br>
also be used as a mixture of organosilicon compounds, for<br>
example as mixtures of the organosilicon compounds of the<br>
general formula I or as mixtures of the oligomeric or<br>
polymeric siloxanes of organosilicon compounds of the<br>
general formula I or as mixtures of organosilicon compounds<br>
of the general formula I with mixtures of the oligomeric or<br>
polymeric siloxanes of organosilicon compounds of the<br>
general formula I.<br>
The present invention also provides a process for the<br>
production of the organosilicon compounds according to the<br>
invention, which is characterised in that silanes of the<br>
general formula II<br><br><br>
wherein R`` has the meaning given above, Rv are identical or<br>
different and denote an RIVO-, C1-C12-alkyl group, preferably<br>
a methyl or ethyl group, RIV are identical or different and<br>
denote a methyl or ethyl group, are catalytically reacted<br>
with alcohols of the general formula R`-OH in which R` has<br>
the meaning given above, with elimination of RIVOH, wherein<br>
the molar ratio of R	`-OH to RIVO- groups is at least 1,<br>
preferably at least 1.2, and RIVOH is removed continuously<br>
or discontinuously from the reaction mixture.<br>
In the alkoxysilanes that are formed the exact composition<br>
of the substance mixtures that are produced with respect to<br>
the relative distribution of the alkoxy substituents to one<br>
another can be determined by means of high-resolution 29-Si<br>
NMR or GPC.<br>
The mixture of homologous alkoxysilane compounds that is<br>
formed can be used as such or after separation into<br>
individual compounds or isolated fractions.<br>
The alcohols R'OH used for the transesterification may be<br>
employed as mixtures of different alcohols or also as pure<br>
substances. For example dodecanol, tetradecanol,<br>
hexadecanol, octadecanol, 1-eicosanol or natural substances<br>
functionalised with hydroxy groups may be used as alcohols<br>
R`OH.<br><br>
The compounds used as catalysts for the transesterification<br>
may contain metals or be metal-free.<br>
As metal-free compounds there may be used organic acids<br>
such as for example trifluoroacetic acid,<br>
trifluoromethanesulfonic acid or p-toluenesulfonic acid,<br>
trialkylammonium compounds R3NH+X- or bases, such as for<br>
example trialkylamines NR3.<br>
The metal compounds used as catalysts for the<br>
transesterification may be transition metal compounds.<br>
As metal compounds for the catalysts there may be used<br>
metal chlorides, metal oxides, metal oxychlorides, metal<br>
sulfides, metal sulfochlorides, metal alcoholates, metal<br>
thiolates, metal oxyalcoholates, metal amides, metal imides<br>
or transition metal compounds with multiple bound ligands.<br>
The following may for example be used as metal compounds:<br>

halides, oxides, sulfides, imides, alcoholates, amides,<br>
thiolates and combinations of the aforementioned classes of<br>
substituents with multiple bound ligands to compounds of<br>

M5+(OC3H7)5, M5+(OC4H9)5; M3+O(OMe)3, M3+O(OEt)3, M3+O (OC3H7) 3,<br>

The metal compounds and transition metal compounds may have<br>
a free co-ordination site on the metal.<br>
As catalysts there may also be used metal compounds or<br>
transition metal compounds that are formed by addition of<br>
water to hydrolysable metal compounds or transition metal<br>
compounds.<br>
In a particular embodiment titanates, such as for example<br>
tetra-n-butyl orthotitanate or tetra-iso-propyl<br>
orthotitanate, may be used as catalysts.<br>
The reaction may be carried out at temperatures between 20°<br>
and 200°C, preferably between 50° and 150°C, particularly<br>
preferably between 70° and 130°C. In order to avoid<br>
condensation reactions it may be advantageous to carry out<br>
the reaction in an anhydrous environment, ideally in an<br>
inert gas atmosphere.<br>
The reaction may be carried out at normal pressure or<br>
reduced pressure. The reaction may be carried out<br>
continuously or batchwise.<br>
The organosilicon compounds according to the invention may<br>
be used as coupling agents between inorganic materials (for<br>
example glass fibres, metals, oxidic fillers, silicas) and<br>
organic polymers (for example thermosetting materials,<br>
thermoplastic materials, elastomers) or as crosslinking<br>
agents and surface modification agents. The organosilicon<br><br>
compounds according to the invention may be used as<br>
coupling reagents in filled rubber mixtures, for example<br>
tyre treads.<br>
The invention also provides rubber mixtures and rubber<br>
vulcanisates that are characterised in that they contain<br>
rubber, filler, such as for example precipitated silica,<br>
optionally further rubber auxiliary substances, as well as<br>
at least one of the organosilicon compounds according to<br>
the invention.<br>
The organosilicon compounds according to the invention may<br>
be used in amounts of 0.1 to 50 wt.%, preferably 0.1 to<br>
25 wt.%, particularly preferably 1 to 2 0 wt.%, referred to<br>
the amount of the rubber that is used.<br>
The addition of the organosilicon compounds according to<br>
the invention as well as the addition of the fillers may<br>
take place at stock temperatures of 100° to 200°C. The<br>
addition may however also take place at lower temperatures<br>
of 40° to 100°C, for example together with further rubber<br>
auxiliary substances.<br>
The organosilicon compounds according to the invention may<br>
be added to the mixing process in pure form as well as<br>
supported on an inert organic or inorganic carrier, and may<br>
also be reacted beforehand with an organic or inorganic<br>
carrier. Preferred carrier materials may be precipitated<br>
or pyrogenic silicas, waxes, thermoplastic materials,<br>
natural or synthetic silicates, natural or synthetic<br>
oxides, special aluminium oxide or carbon blacks.<br><br>
Furthermore the organosilicon compounds according to the<br>
invention may also be reacted beforehand with the filler to<br>
be used and then added to the mixing process.<br>
The following substances may be used as fillers for the<br>
rubber mixtures according to the invention:<br>
Carbon blacks: the carbon blacks to be used in this<br>
connection are produced by the flame black, furnace,<br>
gas black or thermal process and have BET surfaces of<br>
20 to 200 m2/g. The carbon blacks may optionally also<br>
contain heteroatoms, such as for example Si.<br>
Amorphous silicas, produced for example by<br>
precipitation of solutions of silicates or flame<br>
hydrolysis of silicon halides with specific surfaces<br>
of 5 to 1000 m2/g, preferably 20 to 400 m2/g (BET<br>
surface) and with primary particle sizes of 10 to<br>
400 nm. The silicas may optionally also be present as<br>
mixed oxides with other metal oxides, such as Al, Mg,<br>
Ca, Ba, Zn and titanium oxides.<br>
Synthetic silicates, such as aluminium silicate,<br>
alkaline earth metal silicates, such as magnesium<br>
silicate or calcium silicate, with BET surfaces of 20<br>
to 400 m2/g and primary particle diameters of 10 to<br>
400 nm.<br>
Synthetic or natural aluminium oxides and hydroxides.<br>
Natural silicates such as kaolin and other naturally<br>
occurring silicas.<br><br>
Glass fibres and glass fibre products (mats, strands)<br>
or glass microspheres.<br>
There may preferably be used amorphous silicas, produced by<br>
precipitation of solutions of silicates, with BET surfaces<br>
of 20 to 400 m2/g, in amounts of 5 to 150 parts by weight,<br>
in each case referred to 100 parts of rubber.<br>
The aforementioned fillers may be used alone or in the form<br>
of mixtures. In a particularly preferred realisation of<br>
the process 10 to 150 parts by weight of light-coloured<br>
fillers, optionally together with 0 to 100 parts by weight<br>
of carbon black, as well as 1 to 20 parts by weight of a<br>
compound of the organosilicon compounds according to the<br>
invention, in each case referred to 100 parts by weight of<br>
rubber, may be used for the production of the mixtures.<br>
Apart from natural rubber, synthetic rubbers are also<br>
suitable for the production of the rubber mixtures<br>
according to the invention. Preferred synthetic rubbers<br>
are described for example in W. Hofmann,<br>
Kautschuktechnologie, Genter Verlag, Stuttgart 1980. These<br>
comprise inter alia<br>
polybutadiene (BR)<br>
polyisoprene (IR)<br>
styrene/butadiene copolymers with styrene contents of<br>
1 to 60 wt.%, preferably 2 to 50 wt.% (SBR)<br><br>
chloroprene (CR)<br>
isobutylene/isoprene copolymers (IIR)<br>
butadiene/acrylonitrile copolymers with acrylonitrile<br>
contents of 5 to 60 wt.%, preferably 10 to 50 wt.%<br>
(NBR)<br>
partially hydrogenated or completely hydrogenated NBR<br>
rubber (HNBR)<br>
ethylene/propylene/diene copolymers (EPDM)<br>
as well as mixtures of these rubbers. In particular<br>
anionically polymerised L-SBR rubbers (solution SBR) with a<br>
glass transition temperature above -50°C as well as their<br>
mixtures with diene rubbers are of interest for the<br>
production of vehicle tyre treads.<br>
The rubber vulcanisates according to the invention may<br>
contain further rubber auxiliary substances, such as<br>
reaction accelerators, anti-ageing agents, heat ageing<br>
inhibitors, light-stability agents, ozone-stability agents,<br>
processing auxiliaries, plasticisers, tackifiers, blowing<br>
agents, dyes, pigments, waxes, extenders, organic acids,<br>
retarding agents, metal oxides as well as activators such<br>
as triethanolamine, polyethylene glycol and hexanetriol,<br>
which are known to the rubber industry.<br>
The rubber auxiliaries may be used in known amounts, which<br>
are governed inter alia by the intended use. Conventional<br>
amounts are for example 0.1 to 50 wt.% referred to the<br><br>
rubber. Sulfur or sulfur-donating substances may be used<br>
as crosslinking agents. The rubber mixture according to<br>
the invention may furthermore contain vulcanisation<br>
accelerators. Examples of suitable vulcanisation<br>
accelerators are mercaptobenzothiazoles, sulfenamides,<br>
guanidines, thiurams, dithiocarbamates, thioureas and<br>
thiocarbonates. The vulcanisation accelerators and sulfur<br>
are used in amounts of 0.1 to 10 wt.%, preferably 0.1 to<br>
5 wt.% referred to the rubber.<br>
The vulcanisation of the rubber mixtures according to the<br>
invention may take place at temperatures of 100° to 200°C,<br>
preferably 13 0° to 180°C, optionally under a pressure of 10<br>
to 200 bar. The mixing of the rubbers with the filler,<br>
optionally rubber auxiliaries and the organosilicon<br>
compound according to the invention may be carried out in<br>
known mixing devices such as rollers, internal mixers and<br>
mixer-extruders.<br>
The rubber mixtures according to the invention may be used<br>
for the production of moulded articles, for example for the<br>
production of pneumatic tyres, tyre treads, cable<br>
sheathing, hoses, drive belts, conveyor belts, roller<br>
coverings, tyres, shoes soles, sealing rings and damping<br>
elements.<br>
The organosilicon compounds according to the invention have<br>
the advantage that no readily volatile alcohol, normally<br>
methanol or ethanol, is released and, at the same time, the<br>
reactivity with respect to the inorganic filler is<br>
furthermore high. The binding of the alkoxysilane to the<br>
filler takes place within an economically acceptable time.<br><br>
In contrast to the volatile, short-chain alcohols of the<br>
prior art, the non-volatile, long-chain alcohols are<br>
hydrolysed sufficiently rapidly and split off from the<br>
silane skeleton, with the result that a sufficient binding<br>
of the organosilicon compounds according to the invention<br>

an ozone-stability wax from Paramelt B.V. Vulkacit D (DPG)<br>
and Vulkacit CZ (CBS) are commercially available products<br>
from Bayer AG, Perkacit TBzTD (tetrabenzylthiuram<br>
disulfide) is a product from Flexsys N.V.<br>
The coupling reagent Si 266, a bis-)triethoxysilyl-<br>
propyl)disulfide is a product from Degussa AG. Ultrasil<br>
7000 GR is a granulated, readily dispersible precipitated<br>
silica from Degussa AG with a BET surface of 170 m2/g.<br>
The rubber mixtures are prepared in an internal mixer<br>
according to the mixing protocol given in Table 2.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The methods used to test the rubber are summarised in<br>
Table 3.<br><br><br>
Table 4 shows the results of the rubber technology tests.<br>
The mixtures are vulcanised for 20 minutes at 165°C.<br><br><br><br>
As can be seen on the basis of the data in Table 4, the<br>
Mooney viscosities of the mixtures 2 and 3 with the silanes<br>
according to the invention lie below the level of the<br>
reference mixture 1. From this it follows that the<br>
mixtures exhibit an easier processability (e.g. on<br>
extrusion). Higher t10% values compared to the reference<br>
should furthermore be noted. This results in an improved<br>
processing reliability since a premature vulcanisation is<br>
delayed. The reinforcement factor (tensile modulus value<br>
300%/100%) and the tensile strength are at a high value for<br>
the mixtures 2, 3 with significantly higher elongations at<br>
break compared to the reference mixture 1. Compared to<br>
their reference mixture 1, the mixtures with the silanes<br>
according to the invention are characterised in particular<br>
by a lower dynamic rigidity (E*) at 0°C. Significantly<br>
better winter and wet skidding properties should therefore<br>
be expected when these mixtures are used as tyre treads.<br>
In addition these mixtures have a reduced tan δ 60°C and<br>
thus a reduced rolling resistance, resulting in a reduced<br>
fuel consumption when the mixtures are used as tyre treads.<br>
Thus, a significant improvement in the rubber technology<br>
properties compared to the commercially available silanes<br>
is found for mixtures containing the silanes according to<br>
the invention. This means that, despite the presence of<br>
the considerably longer-chain alkoxy groups compared to the<br>
conventional methoxy and ethoxy groups, surprisingly there<br>
is a very good binding to the silica and to the polymer.<br><br>
By using these silanes the emission of volatile<br>
hydrocarbons is significantly reduced compared to the<br>
reference mixture, since instead of ethoxy groups long-<br>
chain alkoxy groups with a high boiling point are present<br>
as starting groups. The boiling points of the long-chain<br>
alcohols formed by hydrolysis of the silane lie above the<br>
processing and vulcanisation temperatures. Accordingly<br>
these remain in the raw mixture and in the vulcanisate and<br>
are not discharged into the environment.<br>
Example 24:<br>
Rubber technology investigations of the organosilicon<br>
compound from Example 3<br>
The formulation used for the rubber mixtures is given in<br>
the following Table 5. In this, the unit phr denotes<br>
proportions by weight, referred to 100 parts of the raw<br>
rubber used. The silane according to the invention was<br>
metered in the same weight as the reference substances<br>
Si 69 and Si 266. The sulfur matching that was carried out<br>
is necessary inter alia to compensate for the lower sulfur<br>
content of the experimental silane. The general procedure<br>
for the production of rubber mixtures and their<br>
vulcanisates is described in the book: "Rubber Technology<br>
Handbook", W. Hofmann, Hanser Verlag 1994.<br><br><br>
The coupling reagent Si 69, a bis-(triethoxysilyl-<br>
propyl) tetrasulf ide, and Si 266, a bis-(triethoxysilyl-<br>
propyl) disulfide, are products from Degussa AG.<br>
The rubber mixtures are produced in an internal mixer<br>
corresponding to the mixing protocol in Table 6.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The methods used for the rubber testing are summarised in<br>
Table 7.<br><br><br><br>
Table 8 shows the results of the rubber technology tests.<br>
The mixtures are vulcanised for 25 minutes at 165°C.<br><br><br>
As can be seen from the data in Table 8, the Mooney<br>
viscosity of mixture 6 containing the silane according to<br>
the invention is significantly lower than the value of the<br>
reference mixtures 4 and 5. This results, analogously to<br>
Example 23, in a better processability of the raw mixture.<br><br>
As regards the static vulcanisate data, the tensile<br>
strengths and elongations at break have comparable values,<br>
while the mixture 6 containing the silane according to the<br>
invention exhibits a significantly higher reinforcement.<br>
This is recognised in the higher tensile modulus value at<br>
300% extension and in the much higher reinforcement factor<br>
(tensile modulus value 300%/100%). The very high silica-<br>
silane-rubber binding can be seen in this connection.<br>
Compared to the results of the Goodrich Flexometer tests,<br>
the mixture 6 containing the silane according to the<br>
invention scores better than the reference substances,<br>
since it has a lower heat build-up under dynamic stress and<br>
a lower permanent deformation. A lower heat build-up is<br>
advantageous for a long service life of a dynamically<br>
stressed tyre tread.<br>
In the same way as in the previous example, the mixture<br>
containing the silane according to the invention has a<br>
lower dynamic rigidity E* at 0°C than the reference<br>
substances. This denotes a better wet skid behaviour and<br>
winter properties. Likewise, the tan 5 at 60°C is also<br>
significantly lower compared to the two reference<br>
substances, whereby the rolling resistance is also reduced.<br>
In addition to these positive properties, the DIN abrasion<br>
of the mixture containing the silane according to the<br>
invention is also considerably reduced. It is thereby<br>
demonstrated that by using the silane according to the<br>
invention in a tread mixture, the most important properties<br>
of a tyre, namely abrasion, wet skidding and rolling<br>
resistance are significantly improved.<br><br>
Overall it is found that when using the silanes according<br>
to the invention not only is the emission of volatile<br>
hydrocarbons reduced in the processing of the mixtures, but<br>
surprisingly the rubber technology properties are also<br>
improved.<br>

and 357.1 g of octadecanol (45 wt.%) as well as with 1 g of<br>

alcohol mixture has melted. Ethanol formed in the<br>
transesterification is distilled off in vacuo at 20-<br>
800 mbar within 285 minutes. After cooling, 901.9 g of a<br>
waxy solid are obtained. More than 77 mole % of the<br>
ethanol-free compounds [ (C14H29O/C16H33O/ C18H37O)3Si-C3H6-]2S2<br>
are formed during the reaction, as can be shown by 1H-NMR<br>

silane compounds is random. 94% of the ethanol is removed<br>
from bis[triethoxysilylpropyl]disulfane by the reaction.<br>

mixture 79.5 g of tetradecanol (10 wt.%), 355.7 g of<br>
hexadecanol (45 wt.%) and 355.7 g of octadecanol (45 wt.%)<br>
as well as with 1 g of tetrabutyl orthotitanate at 130-140°C<br>
in a 1-litre flask on a rotary evaporator. The silane is<br>
added at 105°C after the alcohol mixture has melted. Ethanol<br><br>
formed in the transesterification is distilled off in vacuo<br>
at 20-800 mbar within 270 minutes. After cooling, 897.9 g<br>
of a colourless, waxy solid are obtained. More than<br>
88 mole % of the ethanol-free compounds<br>
[ (C14H29O/C16H33O/C18H37O)3Si-C3H6-SH are formed during the<br>

Rubber technology investigations of the organosilicon<br>
compounds from Examples 25, 26 and 27<br>
The formulation used for the rubber mixtures is given in<br>
the following Table 9. In this, the unit phr denotes<br>
proportion by weight, referred to 100 parts of the crude<br>
rubber used. The silanes according to the invention are<br>
metered in equimolar amounts with respect to 6.4 phr Si 69<br>
referred to silicon. The sulfur metering is adapted so<br>
that the free sulfur proportion present in the mixture is<br><br>
the same. The general process for the production of rubber<br>
mixtures and their vulcanisates is described in the book:<br>
"Rubber Technology Handbook", w. Hofmann, Hanser Verlag<br>
1994.<br><br>
The rubber mixtures are produced in an internal mixer<br>
corresponding to the mixing protocol in Table 10.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The methods used for the rubber testing are summarised in<br>
Table 11.<br><br><br>
Table 12 shows the results of the rubber technology tests.<br>
The mixtures are vulcanised for 25 minutes at 165°C.<br><br><br><br>
As can be seen from the date in Table 12, the advantages of<br>
the mixtures 8, 9 and 10 containing the silanes according<br>
to the invention lie in the processing behaviour of the<br>
mixtures. This is recognised particularly clearly in the<br>
significantly lower Mooney viscosities of the mixing stages<br>
2 and 3 compared to the reference compound (mixture 7).<br>
The result is an easier processability (for example on<br>
extrusion) of the mixtures. In addition to this, the<br>
prevulcanisation behaviour of the mixtures 8, 9 and 10 is<br>
significantly improved, which can be recognised by the<br>
higher t5 and t35 values compared to the reference compound.<br>
Furthermore, significantly higher tl0% values compared to<br>
the reference compound should be noted. The result is an<br>
improved processing reliability since the danger of an<br>
otherwise possible premature vulcanisation is significantly<br>
reduced. The reinforcement factor (tensile modulus value<br>
300%/100%) and the tensile strength for the mixtures 8, 9<br>
and 10 are high, combined with significantly higher<br>
elongations at break compared to the reference mixture 7.<br>
The mixtures containing the silanes according to the<br>
invention are characterised in particular by a lower<br>
dynamic rigidity (E*) at 0°C compared to their reference<br>
mixture 7. These mixtures are therefore expected to have<br>
significantly better winter, ice and wet skid properties<br>
when used as tyre treads. At low temperatures the mixtures<br>
harden considerably less than the reference mixture, and<br>
accordingly a significantly improved grip on the road can<br>
be assumed. In addition these mixtures have a slightly<br>
lower tan 8 at 60°C and thus a reduced rolling resistance,<br>
resulting in a reduced fuel consumption of the vehicle<br>
where they are used as tyre treads.<br><br>
Thus, mixtures containing the silanes according to the<br>
invention exhibit a significant improvement in rubber<br>
technology properties compared to silanes of the prior art.<br>
By using the silanes according to the invention of the<br>
mixtures 8, 9 and 10, the emission of volatile hydrocarbons<br>
can be significantly reduced compared to the reference<br>
substance. The boiling points of the long-chain alcohols<br>
formed by hydrolysis of the silane lie above the processing<br>
and vulcanisation temperatures. Accordingly these remain<br>
in the raw mixture and in the vulcanisate and are not<br>
discharged into the environment.<br>
Example 35:<br>
Rubber technology investigations of the organosilicon<br>
compound from Example 28<br>
The formulation used for the rubber mixtures is given in<br>
the following Table 13. In this, the unit phr denotes<br>
proportions by weight, referred to 100 parts of the raw<br>
rubber used. The silane according to the invention is<br>
metered in the same weight amount as Si 69 and Si 266. The<br>
sulfur matching that is carried out is necessary inter alia<br>
to compensate for the lower sulfur content of the<br>
experimental silane.<br><br><br>
The rubber mixtures are produced in an internal mixer<br>
corresponding to the mixing protocol in Table 10.<br>
The methods used to test the rubbers are summarised in<br>
Table 11.<br>
Table 14 shows the results of the rubber technology tests.<br>
The mixtures are vulcanised for 25 minutes at 165°C.<br><br><br><br>
As can be seen from the data in Table 14, the Mooney<br>
viscosity of mixture 13 containing the silane according to<br>
the invention is significantly lower than the value of the<br>
reference mixtures 11 and 12. This results, analogously to<br>
Examples 23, 24 and 34, in a better processability of the<br>
raw mixture. As regards the static vulcanisate data, the<br>
tensile strengths and elongations at break have comparable<br>
values, while the mixture 13 containing the silane<br>
according to the invention exhibits a significantly higher<br>
reinforcement. This is recognised in the higher tensile<br>
modulus value at 3 00% extension and in the much higher<br>
reinforcement factor (tensile modulus value 300%/100%).<br>
The very high silica-silane-rubber binding can be seen in<br>
this connection. Compared to the results of the Goodrich<br>
Flexometer test, there is less thermal build-up under<br>
dynamic stress and a lower permanent deformation in the<br>
case of mixture 13 compared to the reference substances.<br>
The service life of a dynamically stressed tyre tread is<br>
increased thereby when using the silane of Example 28.<br>
Similarly, as shown in the previous example, the mixture<br>
containing the silane according to the invention has a<br>
lower dynamic rigidity E* at 0°C than the reference<br>
substances. This means a better wet skid behaviour and ice<br>
and winter properties. As in Example 24, the tan 8 value<br>
at 60°C is also significantly lower than in the case of the<br>
two reference substances, whereby the rolling resistance is<br>
also reduced. Tyres with a tread containing the silane<br>
according to the invention from Example 28 would lead to a<br>
significantly lower fuel consumption of a vehicle compared<br>
to standard tyres containing Si 69. In addition to these<br><br>
positive properties, the DIN abrasion of the mixture<br>
containing the silane according to the invention is also<br>
considerably reduced. It is thus also shown here, as in<br>
Example 24, that by using the silane according to the<br>
invention in a tyre tread mixture, the most important<br>
properties of a tyre, namely abrasion, wet skid and rolling<br>
resistance are significantly improved.<br>
Example 36:<br>
Rubber technology investigations of the organosilicon<br>
compound from Examples 29 and 25<br>
The formulation used for the rubber mixtures is given in<br>
the following Table 15. In this, the unit phr denotes<br>
proportions by weight, referred to 100 parts of the raw<br>
rubber used. The silanes according to the invention are<br>
metered in equimolar amounts with respect to 6.4 phr Si 69<br>
referred to silicon.<br><br><br>
The rubber mixtures are prepared in an internal mixer<br>
according to the mixing protocol given in Table 10.<br>
The methods used to test the rubber are summarised in<br>
Table 11.<br>
Table 16 shows the results of the rubber technology tests.<br>
The mixtures are vulcanised for 25 minutes at 165°C.<br><br><br>
As can be seen on the basis of the data in Table 16, the<br>
completely transesterified silane from mixture 15 exhibits<br>
a more rapid and higher drop in Mooney viscosity than the<br>
silane from mixture 14. In addition the prevulcanisation<br>
behaviour is better. It is thus evident that the more<br><br>
highly transesterified product according to the invention<br>
has at least the same, if not an even higher, binding rate<br>
than the silica. This is particularly surprising since it<br>
is known that long-chain alkoxy groups are more unreactive<br>
as regards hydrolysis than short-chain alkoxy groups, like<br>
the almost exclusively used ethoxy group. The opposite<br>
property picture would have been expected. The tensile<br>
elongation data are of the same order, the silane according<br>
to the invention from Example 25 having a significantly<br>
higher elongation at break.<br>
Example 37:<br>
Rubber technology investigations of the organosilicon<br>
compounds from Examples 30 and 17<br>
The formulation used for the rubber mixtures is given in<br>
the following Table 17. In this, the unit phr denotes<br>
proportions by weight, referred to 100 parts of the crude<br>
rubber used. The silanes according to the invention are<br>
metered in equimolar amounts with respect to to 6.4 phr<br>
Si 69 referred to silicon.<br><br><br>
The rubber mixtures are prepared in an internal mixer<br>
according to the mixing protocol given in Table 10.<br>
The methods used to test the rubber are summarised in<br>
Table 11.<br>
Table 18 shows the results of the rubber technology tests.<br>
The mixtures are vulcanised for 20 minutes at 165°C.<br><br><br><br>
In this example too the silane according to the invention<br>
from Example 17 shows, contrary to expectation, advantages<br>
in viscosity compared to the less transesterified product<br>
from Example 30. In addition there are also advantages in<br>
the tensile elongation behaviour on account of the higher<br>
elongation at break with the same reinforcement factor.<br>
The somewhat higher ball rebound at 60°C indicates<br>
advantages in rolling resistance, while the low E* at 0°C is<br>
advantageous as regards the wet skid behaviour.<br>
Example 38:<br>
Rubber technology investigations of the organosilicon<br>
compounds from Examples 31, 32 and 33<br>
The formulation used for the rubber mixtures is given in<br>
the following Table 19. In this, the unit phr denotes<br>
proportions by weight, referred to 100 parts of the crude<br>
rubber used. The silanes according to the invention are<br>
metered in equimolar amounts referred to silicon.<br><br><br>
The rubber mixtures are prepared in an internal mixer<br>
according to the mixing protocol given in Table 10.<br>
The methods used to test the rubber are summarised in<br>
Table 11.<br>
Table 20 shows the results of the rubber technology tests.<br>
The mixtures are vulcanised for 25 minutes at 165°C.<br><br><br>
In this example too the silanes according to the invention<br>
from Examples 32 and 33 exhibit the similarly already<br><br>
described advantages as regards viscosity and processing<br>
behaviour compared to the less transesterified product from<br>
Example 31. The prevulcanisation behaviour is also<br>
improved. This leads to a higher processing reliability,<br>
for example on extrusion. It would also be expected that<br>
the chain length of the long-chain alkoxy groups has<br>
significantly less influence on the overall rubber<br>
technology values than does the degree of<br>
transesterification. This is recognised by the fact that<br>
the differences in the rubber values of the mixtures 19 and<br>
20 are less compared to the reference mixture 18.<br><br>
