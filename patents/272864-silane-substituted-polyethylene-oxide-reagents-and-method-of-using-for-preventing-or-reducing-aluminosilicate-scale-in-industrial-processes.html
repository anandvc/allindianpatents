				<td>SILANE SUBSTITUTED POLYETHYLENE OXIDE REAGENTS AND<br>
METHOD OF USING FOR PREVENTING OR REDUCING ALUMINOSILICATE<br>
SCALE IN INDUSTRIAL PROCESSES<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The invention describes	materials	and methods for<br>
preventing or inhibiting the	formation	of scale on or in<br>
equipment used in industrial	processes	having alkaline process<br>
streams.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The problem of scaling in and on process equipment used in industrial processes and particularly in those processe having an alkaline process stream is very well known. The scales present a significant problem when they build up on the surface of process equipment and cause a loss in the heat transfer coefficient. Thus, additional heat may be required to be provided to the evaporator equipment in these processes resulting in added cost.<br>
A an example of such an industrial process having an alkaline process stream is the Kraft recovery process for manufacturing paper which has been known for over 100 years and is eloquently described in many texts on the subject (see G.A. Smook "Handbook for Pulp and paper technologists, 3rd Edition). More recently the development of closed loop cycles in kraft paper mills has resulted in an increase in scaling problems in process equipment due to the build up of aluminum and silicon in the system as is described by P.N. Wannamaker and W.J. Frederick in "Application of solubility data to predicting the accumulation of aluminum and silicon in alkaline pulp mills", Minimum Effluent Mills Symposium, 1996, p303. It has, therefore, been a well recognized need to provide a method and compositions for inhibiting the formation of aluminosilicate scales in kraft pulp mills. US 5409571 describes the use of terpolymers of maleic acid, acrylic acid and hypophosphorous acid as scale inhibitor for kraft pulp mills. This type of polymer is shown to be effective against<br>
 <br>
calcium carbonate scales but has not been shown to be effective for aluminosilicate scales.<br>
High Level Nuclear Waste (HLNW) facilities process radioactive-rich solid and liquid wastes in order to minimize waste volume and immobilize the hazardous material for long term storage. HLNW treatment is currently performed via two processes; one process is performed under acidic conditions and one under alkaline conditions. Under alkaline processing conditions, sodium aluminosilicate scale growth is a significant problem during the pretreatment stage, prior to waste vitrification.<br>
Within the pretreatment facility, the waste is evaporated, filtered, ion exchanged and further evaporated. During evaporation, aluminosilicate scales can form on the surfaces of the evaporator walls and heating surfaces. Furthermore, transfer pipes can also become blocked due to the buildup of these scales and precipitates necessitating closure for maintenance.<br>
The pretreated HLNW wastes go to vitrification facilities. HLNW waste goes into a melter preparation vessel where silica and other glass-forming materials are added. The mixture is then heated and the molten mixture is then poured into large stainless steel containers, cooled and moved into temporary storage until a permanent storage location is selected.<br>
From the vitrification unit operation, a portion of the Si-containing glass-forming materials are recycled back into the evaporator unit (during pretreatment). The dissolved aluminum, in the form of sodium aluminate, and sodium silicate species react slowly in solution to form complex hydrated sodium aluminosilicate species. Among these species are families of amorphous aluminosilicates (aluminosilicate hydrogel), zeolites, sodalites, and cancrinites collectively known as "sodium aluminosilicate". These nuclear waste streams<br>
 <br>
also contain high concentrations {up to 2M for each ion) of nitrate and nitrite ions, and very high concentrations (up to 16M in some sections of the tank) of 0H- ions. These factors greatly enhance the rate of formation of aluminosilicate scale. As a result, sodium aluminosilicate scale formed has a low solubility in the alkaline HLNW liquor.<br>
Also, sodium aluminosilicate scale is considered to be an undesirable HLNW product due to the incorporation of radioactive lanthanides and actinides into the aluminosilicate scale cage structures and coprecipitation of sodium diuranate. (Peterson, R. A. and Pierce, R. A., (2000), Sodium diuranate and sodium aluminosilicate precipitation testing results, WSRC-TR-2000-00156, Westinghouse Savannah River Company, Aiken, SC.) . It is therefore, desirable for HLNW facilities to minimize the volume of HLNW's including those resulting from aluminosilicate scales. Thus, it can be seen that, sodium aluminosilicate scale growth has a significant negative economic and operational impact on the treatment of nuclear wastes.<br>
Therefore, it would be desirable to provide a solution to the sodium aluminosilicate scaling problem in the nuclear waste evaporators.<br>
Attempts to solve the aforementioned problems have lead to limited success see Wilmarth and coworkers (Wilmarth, W. R., Mills, J. T. and Dukes, V. H., (2005), Removal of silicon from high-level waste streams via ferric flocculation, Separation Sci. Technol., 40, 1-11. These authors have examined the use of ferric nitrate to remove Si from solution in the form of a ferric precipitate, in order to reduce or eliminate the formation of aluminosilicate scale. Although this approach has some merit, there is still the disposal of the high-level ferric precipitate to deal with and an additional filtration unit operation is required. Also, W. R.Wilmarth and J. T. Mills "Results of Aluminosilicate Inhibitor Testing", WSRC-TR-2001-00230 have proposed using low<br>
 <br>
molecular weight compounds as scale inhibitors for HLNW's but have found none to be satisfactory.<br>
Thus there is a need for an economical and effective method for reducing aluminosilicate scale buildup on equipment used in industrial processes where such buildup is a problem as for example, the Kraft pulp paper process and in nuclear waste treatment streams.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention solves the aforementioned problems and others by providing materials and a method whereby polymers having at least 0.5 mole % of the group —Si(OR")3 (where R" is H, an alkyl group, Na, K, or NH4) as an end group or pendant thereto are used to reduce or eliminate aluminosilicate scaling in a process having an alkaline process stream such as a kraft pulping mill or a high level nuclear waste evaporation process treatment stream. When materials of the present invention are added to these industrial process streams, they reduce and even completely prevent formation of aluminosilicate scale on the equipment surfaces. Moreover, the present materials are effective at treatment concentrations that make them economically practical.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to a method and<br>
materials for the reduction of aluminosilicate containing<br>
scale in an industrial process having an alkaline process<br>
stream such as in the kraft pulp mill process streams or a<br>
high level nuclear waste treatment stream. The process stream<br>
to be treated can be any process stream having an alkaline<br>
condition and in which scaling occurs, e.g. black, green and<br>
white liquors of the kraft process or a high level nuclear<br>
waste evaporation process stream.<br>
The method comprises the step of adding to the process<br>
stream an aluminosilicate containing scale inhibiting amount<br>
of a polymer having at least 5 mole % pendant thereto a group<br>
 <br>

The amount of —Si (OR")3 functionality present in the polymer will be an amount sufficient enough to achieve the desired results and can range from a little as 0.5 mole % of the total monomer groups present in the polymer to as much as 100 mole%. However it will be most economical to use the least amount necessary to yield the desired results. The polymers are preferably prepared initially as the silylether derivatives Polymer--Si(OR") 3 where R" = C1-C3 alkyl, aryl, eg Polymer —Si(OCH2CH3)3 or Polymer—Si(OCH3)3 • The silylether derivatives may be added directly to the industrial process stream or they may be hydrolyzed to the silanol derivatives to form polymers of the following generic structures, Polymer—Si(OH)3 , Polymer—Si(ONa)3, Polymer— Si(OK)3, and Polymer—Si(ONH4)3 before addition to the process stream. It is a convenient feature of this invention that any of these forms may be added to the process stream. The molecular weight of the polymer should be at least about 500, most preferably at least about 1000.<br>

Particularly preferred are starch and cellulose derivatives wherein the reaction product of hydroxyethylcellulose with 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane is a specific example.<br>
 <br>
The polymers used in the invention can be made in a variety of ways. For example, they can be made by polymerizing a monomer containing the group —Si(OR")3/ where R" = H, C1-C3 alkyl, aryl, Na, K or NH4, such as for example a silane monomer, or copolymerizing such a monomer with one or more co-monomers . Suitable silane monomers for use in the present invention include, but are not limited to vinyltriethoxysilane, vinyltrimethoxysilane, allyltriethoxysilane, butenyltriethoxysilane, gamma-N-acrylamidopropyltriethoxysilane, p-triethoxysilylstyrene, 2-(methyltrimethoxysilyl) acrylic acid, 2-(methyltrimethoxysilyl)-1,4 butadiene, N-<br>
triethoxysilylpropyl-maleimide and other reaction products of maleic anhydride and other unsaturated anhydrides with amino compounds containing the —Si(OR") 3 group. These monomers can be hydrolyzed by aqueous base, either before or after polymerization. Suitable co-monomers for use in the present invention include, but are not limited to, vinyl acetate, acrylonitrile, styrene, (meth)acrylic acid and its esters or salts, (meth)acrylamide and substituted acrylamides such as acrylamidomethylpropanesulfonic acid, N-methylacrylamide, N,N-dimethylacrylamide, N-ethylacrylamide N-propylacrylamide, N-butylacrylamide, N-amylacrylamide, N-hexylacrylamide, N-phenylacrylamide, N-octylacrylamide. The copolymers can also be graft copolymers such as polyacrylic acid-g-poly(vinyltriethoxysilane) and poly(vinyl acetate-co-crotonic acid) -g- poly(vinyltriethoxysilane). These polymers can be made in a variety of solvents. Solvents suitable for such use include, but are not limited to, acetone, tetrahydrofuran, toluene, xylene, etc. In some cases the polymer is soluble in the reaction solvent and is recovered by stripping off the solvent. Alternatively, if the polymer is not soluble in the reaction solvent, the product is recovered by filtration. Suitable initiators for use in the present invention include, but are not limited to, 2,2'azobis(2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile)<br>
 <br>
and 2, 2-azobisisobutyronitrile, benzoyl peroxide, and curaene hydroperoxide.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, polymers useful in the invention can be made by reacting a compound containing a —Si(OR")3 group as well as a reactive group that reacts with either a pendant group or backbone atom of an existing polymer. For example, polyamines and polysaccharides can be reacted with a variety of compounds containing — Si(OR")3 groups to give polymers which can be used for the invention. Suitable reactive groups include, but are not limited to an alkyl halide group, such as for example, chloropropyl, bromoethyl, chloromethyl, and bromoundecyl. The compound containing --Si(OR")3, can contain an epoxy functionality such as glycidoxypropyl, 1,2-epoxyamyl, 1,2-epoxydecyl or 3,4-epoxycyclohexylethyl. 3-<br>
glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane is a particularly preferred compound.<br>
The reactive group can also be a combination of a hydroxyl group and a halide, such as 3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl. The reactive moiety can also contain an isocyanate group, such as isocyanatopropyl, or isocyanatomethyl that react to form a urea linkage. In addition, silanes containing anhydride groups, such as triethoxysilylpropylsuccinic anhydride are suitable for use in making the polymers for the present invention. The reactions can be carried out either neat or in a suitable solvent. In addition, other functional groups such as alkyl groups can be added by reacting other amino groups or nitrogen atoms on the polymer with alkyl halides, epoxides or isocyanates. The polyamines can be made by a variety of methods. They can be made by a ring opening polymerization of aziridine or similar compounds. They also can be made by condensation reactions of amines such as ammonia, methylamine, dimethylamine, ethylenediamine etc. with reactive compounds such as 1,2-dichloroethane, epichlorohydrin, epibromohydrin and similar compounds.<br>
Polymers containing anhydride groups can be reacted with a variety of compounds containing -Si(OR")3 to make polymers<br>
 <br>
suitable for use in the present invention. Suitable anhydride containing polymers include copolymers of maleic anhydride with ethylenically unsaturated monomers such as styrene, ethylene, alpha olefins such as octadecene, meth (aery laird de), (meth)acrylic acid, acrylate esters such as methyl (meth)acrylate, ethyl (meth)acrylate, butyl acrylate and methylvinylether. The polymer can also be a graft copolymer such as poly(1,4-butadiene)-g-maleic anhydride or polyethylene-g-maleic anhydride and the like. Other suitable anhydride monomers include, but are not limited to, itaconic and citraconic anhydrides. Suitable reactive silane compounds include, but are not limited to Y~aminoPropyltriethoxysilane, bis(gamma-triethoxysilylpropyl)amine, N-phenyl-gamma aminopropyltriethoxysilane, p-aminophenyltriethoxysilane, 3-(m-aminophenoxypropyl)-trimethoxysilane, and garnma-aminobutyltriethoxylsilane. Other functional groups can be added to the polymer by reacting it with amines, alcohols and other compounds. In a preferred polymer for use in the present invention, maleic anhydride is the anhydride and the co-monomer is styrene. A preferred silane is gamma-aminopropyltriethoxysilane. It is also advantageous to react some of the anhydride groups with another amine such as diethylamine.<br>
The same type of amino compound containing an —Si(OR")3 group can be reacted with polymers containing a pendant isocyanate group, such as copolymers of for example, isopropenyldimethylbenzylisocyanate and vinyl isocyanate, with co-monomers including, but not limited to, vinyl acetate, styrene, acrylic acid, and acrylamide. These polymers can also be reacted with other compounds such as amines to enhance performance.<br>
Isocyanate functional compounds with an —Si(OR")3 group such as gamma-isocyanatopropyltrimethoxysilane can also be reacted with polymers containing hydroxyl groups such as hydrolyzed poly(vinyl acetate) and copolymers of vinyl acetate with other monomers. Other hydroxyl containing polymers<br>
 <br>
suitable for use include, but are not limited to, polysaccharides and polymers containing N-methylolacrylamide.<br>
In the present process, the amount of polymer added to the process stream can depend on the composition of the industrial process stream {e.g. a Kraft pulping mill process or high level nuclear waste streams liquor involved and generally all that is required is an aluminosilicate containing scale inhibiting amount thereof. In general the polymer is preferably added to the process stream in economically and practically favorable concentrations. A preferred concentration is one that is greater than about 0 ppm to about 300 ppm, more preferably in a concentration that is greater than about 0 ppm to about 50 ppm and most preferably the polymer is added to the process stream in a concentration that is greater than about 0 ppm to about 10 ppm.<br>
The polymer can be added directly to any industrial process stream where scaling can occur, e.g. in the black liquor evaporators of the kraft pulp milling process, and in green and white liquor process streams of that process. It is preferred, however to add the polymer to a charge stream or recycle stream or liquor leading to the black liquor evaporator. While the polymer can be added to the industrial process stream at any time during the process, it is preferable to add it at any convenient point in the process before or during application of heat. Usually, the polymer is added immediately before the evaporator.<br>

 <br>
All of the polymer samples are dissolved in 2% aqueous NaOH prior to addition to the nuclear waste liquor, hydrolyzing any anhydride and trialkoxylsilane groups that have not previously been reacted, transforming the trialkoxylsilane groups into silanol groups or the sodium salts. Into a 125 ml polyethylene bottle, are placed the scale reducing additive (if used) as a 0.5% solution in 2% aqueous NaOH for the lower doses and for the higher doses a 3% solution is used. 120 ml of the above stock synthetic high level nuclear waste solution is then added to the bottle with mixing. The sealed bottle is heated with agitation at 102° C for 18+2 hours. Up to 24 such tests (bottles) are done at one time.

The solution is prepared by adding the sodium carbonate, sodium sulfate, sodium thiosulfate, sodium hydrosulfide, and sodium acetate to the water with rapid stirring. After 30 min stirring, the solution is filtered through a coarse glass frit to remove minor amounts of insoluble material. The sodium hydroxide solution, silica solution, and finally basic aluminate solution is added, with stirring after each addition. The solution is used immediately as described below.<br>
For each of Examples 2 6 to 33, respective polymer solutions of polymers iii (Example 3), v (Example 5), viii (Example 8), ix (Example 9), xi (Example 11), xii(Example 12), xvii (Example 17) and xviii (Example 18) are pre-diluted to 1% (w/w) active concentration in 2% NaOH solution prior to use.<br>
The amount of 1.45 g of a polymer solution, (or 1.45 g of water for the control test), is added to a labeled 4-oz HDPE wide-mouth jar. Then 145 g (120 ml) of simulated kraft black liquor solution is added to each jar before capping and shaking. Each jar then contained a "'test solution". The polymer dose is 100 ppm.<br>
The caps on the jars are then loosened so as to be able to relieve pressure, and the jars placed on the floor of a 102 °C oven to simulate heating in a kraft process liquor. After 1.5 hr the caps are tightened and the jars placed on a rotisserie placed inside the oven. After turning on the rotisserie in the oven overnight (16.5 hr), each sample is filtered using a pre-weighed 3-um filter membrane (Pall Versapor-3000 T w/wa, 47 mm). Each membrane plus any collected solid is washed with about 5-ml water and placed on a 2.5-inch diameter watch glass. A steel tray containing all the watch glasses and membranes is placed in a 102 °C oven for 30 min to dry the filtered solids. Each membrane plus solid is weighed and the weight of the solid calculated by difference. % Scale inhibition is then calculated in the following manner:<br>
% Scale inhibition =<br>
100 x Weight of scale formed with polymer present<br>
