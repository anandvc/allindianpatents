DESCRIPTION<br>
PROCESS FOE PRODUCING GUANIDINE DERIVATIVES,INTERMEDIATES THEREFOR AND THEIR<br>
PRODUCTION<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a process for producing guanidine derivatives which are useful as insecticides, novel intermediates therefor, and a<br>
EP-A 376279 corresponding to JP-A H3(1991)-157308, for instance, describes guanidine derivatives having pesticidal activity and a process for producing the derivatives.  Moreover, as an improved production process for the guanidine derivatives, EP-A 452782 corresponding to JP-A H5(1993)-9173 discloses a production process via an isothiourea derivative having a cyclic diacyl group as shown in the following schema,  1,<br><br>
wherein R1 RZ, R4a, and R5a are the same or different, H or a hydrocarbon group which may optionally be substituted; A' is a divalent hydrocarbon group which<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
may optionally be substituted; Q' is a heterocyclic group which may optionally be substituted; X' is an electron withdrawing group; Y1 and Y2 are the same or different, a leaving group; n is 0 or 1.<br>
Furthermore, EP-A 375907 corresponding to JP-A H2(1990)-288860 discloses guanidine derivatives having pesticidal activity, and the following process for producing the derivatives.<br><br>
wherein R1' and R2' are hydrogen or C1-4 alkyl, R4' is C1-4 alkyl, Z is a five- or six-membered heterocyclic group having at least one nitrogen atom which may be substituted by halegen or C1-4 alkyl, R5' and R6' are hydrogen or C1-4 alkyl.<br>
However, in these processes for producing the guanidine derivatives, there are some problems such that a mercaptan compound of RSH (wherein R is a hydrocarbon group which may optionally be substituted) having bad smell is formed as a by-product.<br>
In the above state of the art, the object of present invention is to provide a process which is advantageous to an industrial mass production of guanidine derivatives in a higher yield by simple and convenient reaction procedures without bad smell, novel intermediates therefor, and a process for producing the intermediates.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
To accomplish the above-mentioned object, the inventors of the present invention earnestly explored for a new production route to a guanidine derivative of the formula [I]:<br><br>
- 3 -<br><br>
wherein R is H or a hydrocarbon group which may optionally be substituted; R is an amino group which may optionally be substituted; Q is a heterocyclic group which may optionally be substituted; X is an electron attracting group; n is 0 or 1.<br>
As a result, the inventors discovered that an N-cyclodiacyl-N'-substituted isourea derivative of the formula [IV]:<br><br>
wherein R is a hydrocarbon group which may optionally be substituted, A is a divalent hydrocarbon group which may optionally be substituted, and X is as defined above, can be produced in high yield by reacting an N-substituted isourea derivative of the formula [II]:<br><br>
wherein the symbols are as defined above, or a salt thereof, with a compound of the formula [III]:<br><br><br>
- 4 -<br>
wherein Y1 and Y2 are the same or different, a leaving group; A is as defined above.<br>
The inventors further found that a compound of the formula [VI]: <br>
wherein the symbols are as defined above, or a salt thereof, can be produced in high yield by reacting the compound [IV] with a compound of the formula [V]:<br>
Q-(CH2)n-NH-R2	[V]<br>
wherein the symbols are as defined above, or a salt thereof.<br>
Based on the above findings, the inventors did further research and found surprisingly that when the compound [VI] or a salt thereof is reacted with an amine or a salt thereof either in water or in a mixture of water and an organic solvent, the guanidine derivative [I] or a salt thereof is produced in high yield.<br>
And, the inventors further found that the compound [VI] or a salt thereof can be produced by reacting the compound [II] or a salt thereof with the compound [V] or a salt thereof not via the compound [IV].  The inventors did further reseach and discovered to their own surprise that the compound [VI] or a salt thereof can be produced in a further improved yield by conducting the above reaction in the presence of an acid either in water or in a mixture of water and an organic solvent.<br>

As for the starting compound [VI] for this reaction, the compound which is synthesized by the above process (B) or (C) or any reaction analogous therewith and then isolated can be used, but, the reaction mixture containing compound [VI] so synthesized can also be availabe.  Thus, a typical procedure without isolating compound [VI] (1) comprises conducting the above process (B) or (C) either in water or in a mixture of water and an organic solvent (e.g. the organic solvents mentioned above) and, then, adding the amine compound.  An alternative procedure (2) comprises conducting the reaction according to the above process (B) or (C) in an organic solvent, adding water to the reaction mixture to prepare a binary phase, and adding the amine compound for reaction.  In the latter procedure (2), the by-product compound [VII] may separate out after the first-stage reaction and this by-product may be filtered off but, of course, the process can be further continued without removing the<br><br>

The resulting compound [ IV], compound [VI] and guanidine derivative [I], as well as their salts, can be respectively isolated and purified by known procedures such as concentration, concentration under reduced pressure, distillation, fractional distillation, solvent extraction, change of pH, redistribution,chromatography, crystallization and recrystallization.<br>
