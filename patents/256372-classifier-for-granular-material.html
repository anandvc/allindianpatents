				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to the field of separation of granular materials, and in particular to the classification of powders or similar materials by means of a dynamic air classifiers. More particularly, the present invention relates to dynamic air classifier for the separation of granular and powdery materials into fraction of different grain sizes and to the method of separation of granular and powdery materials according to grain sizes by means of a dynamic air classifier. <br>
State of the art<br>
The separation of granular and powdery materials into two fractions with different grain sizes may be achieved by means of dynamic air classifiers. The materials concerned are powders with particle sizes of up to 1,000 Âµm such as cement, limestone or lime, ore and coal dust, among others.<br>
The capacities of material treated vary from a few tonnes to several hundreds of tonnes per hour.<br>
Dynamic classifiers have undergone several major changes allowing to classify them into three large groups. The first generation, generally known by the names of "turbo," "heyd" or "whirlwind", has been improved by the second generation of the "wedag" type.<br>
The 3rd generation is the most effective from the point of view of the separation efficiency. The operating principle of classifiers (O'Sepa, Sturtevant SD, ...) is described in documents USP 4,551,241 and EP 0 023 320.<br>
Document US 4,551,241 discloses a particle classifier provided with a lateral cyclone into which the particles are brought and cycloned. The surplus is sent to the rotary cage of the classifier. The whole installation proves relatively bulky and of quite complex design.<br>
Document EP 0 023 320 also shows a device for the classification of granular materials with a lateral <br>
outlet for the air charged with fine particles. This installation requires the use of additional filters and/or cyclones for the separation of fine materials.<br>
Aims of the invention<br>
The present invention aims to disclose a dynamic air classifier allowing to avoid the use of external filters or cyclones, the recovery of the fine materials occurring in the body of the classifier itself.<br>
The present invention also relates to a method of separation according to grain size using the classifier of the invention.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The present invention discloses a dynamic air classifier for the separation of granular and powdery materials into grain size fractions, comprising a rotary cage in which:<br>
said classifier also comprises a recovery chamber 2 for<br>
fine materials with a outlet bottom, said chamber 2 being<br>
defined by a casing;<br>
said recovery chamber 2 is coaxially arranged in the<br>
protrusion of the rotary cage I so as to be able to use<br>
the vortex created by the rotary cage for cycloning said<br>
material;<br>
said recovery chamber 2 comprises openings in the casing 5<br>
allowing the passage of the centrifuged material towards<br>
the collection ducts for the material located outside the<br>
chamber.<br>
In addition, according to the invention, said recovery chamber 2 may comprise fixed and/or mobile deflectors (4,7) in order to modify the air velocity and/or to change its direction.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, said recovery chamber 2 for the fine materials is<br><br>
cylindrical or cone-shaped, the cone possibly being open at the top or at the bottom.<br>
As an advantage, said recovery chamber 2 for the fine materials has a length that corresponds to 2 to 6 times the length of the rotary cage 1 so as to have the required and sufficient cycloning capacity.<br>
In an especially preferred manner, said recovery chamber 2 for the fine materials and said rotary cage 1 share the same vertical axis as the recovery chamber 2 positioned below and protruding from said cage 1.<br>
According to a first embodiment of the invention, the deflectors 4 that are positioned in the outlet part of the rotary cage 1 and/or in the recovery chamber 2 are driven by the rotation means of the cage 1 or by a separate device.<br>
According to a second embodiment of the invention, the deflectors 4 that are positioned in the outlet part of the rotary cage 1 are attached to said cage 1 itself.<br>
The invention also specifies that the air-extraction duct 3 passes through the outlet bottom of the recovery chamber 2, said duct having a diameter of between 30 and 95% of the bottom diameter of the recovery chamber 2 for the fine materials.<br>
Several openings and/or slits are preferably provided at the bottom of the recovery chamber 2.<br>
In addition, below said slits and/or openings there are a plurality of ducts 8 leading to a means for conveying the material.<br>
As an advantage, below said slits and/or openings there are a plurality of ducts 8 leading to a circular airslide conveying the material towards another means of conveyance.<br>
The classifier of the invention is also characterised by the presence of one or several deflectors 7 that are conical, cylindrical or radial (angled or straight)<br>
on top of the bottom of the recovery chamber 2, outside the air-extraction duct 3, so as to minimise the turbulence near the bottom of the chamber and to avoid that the material is picked up again by the air.<br>
In addition, the invention also shows the presence of a plurality of openings in the lower part of the casing 5 of the recovery chamber 2, these openings leading into collection ducts for the fine material may be appropriately positioned (not shown).<br>
The present invention also discloses a method of separation according to grain size by means of a dynamic air classifier, comprising the following steps:<br>
-	feeding the material to be treated 13 to the rotary cage 1;<br>
-	sorting between large and fine particles in the rotary cage 1 depending on the rotation velocity and air intake;<br>
-	rejecting the large particles to the refuse chamber 17.<br>
-	recovering the fine materials in the recovery chamber 2 positioned coaxially with the rotary cage;<br>
-	using the vortex created by the rotary cage and possibly further accelerated by mobile or fixed deflectors 4 for cycloning the fine material;<br>
-	separating the dedusted air and fine particles and extraction of the latter to a means of conveyance.<br>
Lastly, the invention discloses the use of the device of the present invention for the separation and classification of particles of mineral materials such as particles of cement, clinker, lime and coal dust.<br>
Brief description of the figures<br>
Figure 1 shows the layout of a classifier of the 3rd generation as in the state of the art.<br>
Figure 2 shows the principle layout of the classifier as in the invention.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
All types of classifier operate according to the same principle, which is shown in Fig. 1. The heart of the classifier comprises a squirrel cage 1 rotating about a vertical axis. This cage comprises spaced plates or bars and is surrounded by vanes 14 allowing to direct the air before it enters through the intake volute 6 in the cage 1. Vanes 14 may also assist with controlling the airflow.<br>
The material to be separated enters the sorting zone defined by the outside of the cage 1. and the deflectors 4. The maximum size of the particles entering the cage with the air will be determined by the rotation velocity of the cage 1 and the volume of air with which the classifier is fed.<br>
The larger particles remain outside the cage and are collected in the refuse chamber 17. These large particles come out of the classifier by gravity 10. The air charged with fine particles 15 comes out of the cage either through the top or laterally and it leaves the classifier by a duct. The fine material is then recovered by means of one or more cyclone (s) or filter (s) outside the body of the classifier.<br>
In modern classifiers of the 3rd generation, the air enters the cage 1 with a tangential velocity of the same order as the peripheral velocity of the cage. The tangential component of the velocity naturally increases when the air enters inside the cage 1 (vortex effect) .<br>
The principle of the invention is laid out in Fig. 2. This consists in using the vortex already created in order to cyclone the material to be treated 13 in a recovery chamber 2 adjacent to and coaxial with the cage 1, the dedusted air 12 leaving this recovery chamber 2 through an air-extraction duct 3 whose intake is located inside the recovery chamber 2. The dedusted air 12 is then sucked towards one or several ventilators that send some of the air<br><br>
or all of it back to the air-intake volute 6 of the classifier.<br>
The vortex created by the rotary cage 1 may either remain free or be accelerated by fixed or mobile deflectors 4 before entering said recovery chamber 2. These deflectors 4 may also be positioned in the recovery chamber 2 itself.<br>
The fine material 11 is centrifuged in this recovery chamber 2 and it will concentrate in the outer part of the chamber where it will be collected by means of openings in the walls (cylindrical casing and/or bottom) of the recovery chamber 2.<br>
The recovery efficiency for the fine materials  essentially depends on the size of the particles and of their absolute density. For a same material, the important factors are the intensity of the vortex, i.e. the tangential velocity of the air all through the recovery chamber 2, the diameter of the recovery chamber 2 and the dwelling time of the particles in said chamber.<br>
In other words, the important factors will be the diameter of the recovery chamber 2, its length and the tangential velocity of the air. The greater the tangential component of the air and the longer the chamber, the greater will be the recovery efficiency.<br>
The invention thus comprises a classifier with a cage, provided with a recovery chamber 2 for fine materials which is fitted coaxially in the protrusion of the rotary cage 1. This recovery chamber for fine materials is cylindrical or conical (cone-shaped), the angle of the cone generating line with the revolution axis of the cone preferably being smaller than 30Â°; the intake diameter of the recovery chamber 2 for fine materials is of the same size order as the diameter of the cage 1 and has a length that corresponds to 2 to 6 times the length of the cage 1.<br><br>
In the outlet area of the cage I and/or in the recovery chamber 2, fixed or mobile deflectors 4 may be installed and will allow to affect the direction of the air currents. The possible rotation of these deflectors 4 may be induced by attaching them to the cage I or on the other hand by setting them in motion by a means that is independent of the cage I. They may also be set in motion by the same means as the cage 1 without being attached to said cage 1.<br>
The extraction duct 3 for the dedusted air 12 will be on its first part concentric of the recovery chamber and will preferably have a diameter between 0.3 and 0.95 times the bottom diameter of the recovery chamber 2 in the plane of the intake surface of said duct. Outlet deflectors 7 may be positioned here so as to control the direction of air intake at the inlet of the duct.<br>
Recovery of the centrifuged material occurs by using openings at the outlet bottom and/or in the lower half of the casing 5 of the recovery chamber 2. Sleeves or ducts 8 for the material are provided opposite these openings so as to collect and direct the material towards traditional means of conveyance.<br>
The use of a coaxial recovery chamber in the protrusion of the rotary cage allows to use the vortex already created by the cage and thereby reduces the losses of charge of the aeraulic circuit.<br>
The invention allows to avoid the use of filters or cyclones external to the machine, thus simplifying its installation. An additional advantage is that the entire separation assembly is more compact, which reduces the engineering work of installation, reduces the installation costs and reduces charge losses in the separation circuit.<br>
