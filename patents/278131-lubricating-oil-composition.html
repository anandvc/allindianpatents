LUBRICATING OIL COMPOSITION<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a lubricating oil composition for internal combustion engines, more specifically to a lubricating oil composition for internal combustion engines which is improved in a corrosion inhibiting effect to metal materials and a friction reducing effect by using sulfated oxymolybdenum dithiocarbamate and a specific ashless base friction controlling agent in combination.<br>
RELATED ART<br>
[0002]<br>
At present, the environment is regulated more and more severely on  a global scale, and particularly in situations surrounding automobiles, regulations to fuel consumption, exhaust gases and the like are becoming severer and severer. The above situations are backgrounded by environmental problems such as global warming and the like and resource protection originating in concerns about depletion of oil resources.  It is estimated that saving of fuel consumption in automobiles shall be advanced more and more because of the reasons described above.  In respect to saving of fuel<br>
 <br>
consumption in automobiles, important is an improvement in engine oils such as   a reduction in a viscosity of engine oils, addition of good friction controlling agents and the like for preventing a frictional loss in engines in addition to an improvement in automobiles themselves such as a reduction in a weight of cars, an improvement in engines and the like. However, a reduction in a viscosity of engine oils is a cause to bring about an increase in friction in the respective parts of an engine, and therefore a friction controlling agent, an extreme pressure agent and the like are more and more important in order to reduce a frictional loss caused by the above reduction in a viscosity and prevent wear.<br>
[0003]<br>
On the other hand, iron base materials and aluminum base materials are principally used for sliding materials in engines and the like, but a large variety of aluminum, copper, tin, lead and the like without being limited to iron is used for materials of sliding parts, for example, bearing metals in main bearings, con'rod bearings and the like.  The above copper- or lead-containing metal materials have the excellent characteristic that they have less fatigue phenomenon, but on the other hand, they have the defeat that they are liable to be corroded.  Accordingly, a reduction in corrosion to various metal materials as well as a reduction in a frictional loss and prevention of wear each described above is required to lubricating oils and additives therefor.<br>
2<br>
 <br>
[0004]<br>
As described above, various performances are required to lubricating oils, and therefore various additives are usually blended thereinto.  However, even if additives are blended in the above complicated components for a purpose of obtaining some effects, the desired effects shall not necessarily be obtained.  Even if the targeted, effects are obtained, negative influences may be exerted on the other performances, and therefore it is important to investigate the combinations of the additives.<br>
[0005]<br>
For example, sulfated oxymolybdenum dithiocarbamate (hereinafter abbreviated to MoDTC) is excellent as a friction reducing agent in terms of a friction reducing effect, but on the other hand, sulfur-containing compounds such as MoDTC have a corrosion property to copper, tin and the like, and therefore countermeasures therefor are required in many cases. [0006]<br>
In respect to corrosion of metals, conditions of corrosion and easiness thereof are generally different according to the kind of metals, and therefore countermeasures are usually required to every metal.  For example, benzotriazole derivatives are used as a metal inactivating agent, and corrosion to copper is inhibited by blending it, but an effect thereof is not exerted on other metals.  Also, corrosion to lead is inhibited by adding zinc dithiophosphate<br>
 <br>
(hereinafter abbreviated to ZnDTP), but since ZnDTP is also a sulfur-containing compound as is the case with ZnDTC, it has a corrosion property to copper, tin and the like.<br>
[0007]<br>
In prevention of corrosion to metals, different methods from blending the corrosion inhibitors described above are proposed in recent years.  It is disclosed in, for example, patent documents 1 and 2 that an effect of inhibiting corrosion to lead is derived by optimizing an ashless dispersant and that this allows prevention of corrosion to lead to be achieved even in the state that a content of zinc dithiophosphate is reduced.<br>
[0008]<br>
Lubricating oil compositions described in the documents described above are improved in an effect of preventing corrosion to lead, but corrosion to copper brought about by using sulfur-containing compounds is not prevented. Accordingly, corrosion to copper brought about by blending MoDTC can not be prevented by a technique of optimizing ashless dispersants, and use of MoDTC having an excellent friction reducing ability remains limited as ever.<br>

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0010]<br>
The present invention has been made under the situation described above, and an object of the present invention is to. provide a lubricating oil composition of an environmental regulation compliant type which is provided with an excellent friction reducing effect and a high corrosion preventing effect to copper and lead in combination by combining MoDTC and an ashless friction controlling agent with a metal inactivating agent.<br>
[0011]<br>
Intensive researches repeated by the present inventors in order to achieve the object described above have resulted in finding that a high corrosion preventing effect to copper is obtained by combining MoDTC with a specific amount of an acid amide compound and a metal inactivating agent.  The corrosion property to lead is enhanced by blending the above acid amide compound, but it has been found that the above undesirable influence is inhibited by blending a fatty acid partial ester compound or an aliphatic amine compound.

[0050]<br>
In the present invention, the above zinc dithiophosphate may be used alone or in combination of two or more kinds thereof.  In particular, the composition comprising zinc dithiophosphate having a secondary alkyl group as a principal component is preferred since it enhances the wear resistance.<br>
The specific examples of zinc dithiophosphate include zinc dipropyldithiophosphate, zinc dibutyldithiophosphate, zinc dipentyldithiophosphate, zinc dihexyldithiophosphate, zinc diisopentyldithiophosphate, zinc<br>

If the above phosphorus content is less than 0.02 % by mass, the wear resistance and the high temperature cleaning property are not satisfactory, and if it exceeds 0.10 % by mass, catalyst poisoning of the exhaust gas catalyst is notably exhibited. Accordingly, both are not preferred.<br>
[0052]<br>
Other additives, for example, a viscosity index improving agent, a pour point depressant, a cleaning dispersant, an antioxidant, a wear resistant agent or an extreme pressure agent, a friction reducing agent, a dispersant, a rust preventive, a surfactant or an emulsification resistant agent, a defoaming agent and  the like can be blended, if necessary, with the lubricating oil composition of the present invention as long as the object of the present invention is not damaged.<br>

If a number average molecular weight of R11, R13 and R14 described above is less than 500, the solubility in the base oil is reduced.  If it exceeds 3,000, the cleaning property is reduced, and no targeted performances are likely to be<br>
 <br>
obtained.  Also, the term r described above is preferably 2 to 5, more preferably 3 to 4.  If the term r is less than 1, the cleaning property is deteriorated, and if r is 11 or more, the solubility in the base oil is deteriorated.<br>
In Formula (V), the term's is preferably 1 to 4, more preferably 2 to 3.  If s falls in the range described above, it is preferred in terms of the cleaning property and the solubility in the base oil.  A polybutenyl group, a polyisobutenyl group and an ethylene-propylene copolymer can be listed as the alkenyl group, and the alkyl group is obtained by hydrogenating the above groups.<br>
The representative example of the suited alkenyl group includes a polybutenyl group or a polyisobutenyl group.  The polybutenyl group is obtained by polymerizing 1-butene with a mixture of isobutenes or isobutene of a high purity.  The representative example of the suited alkyl group includes a group obtained by hydrogenating the polybutenyl group or the polyisobutenyl group. [0058]<br>
The alkenyl- or alkylsuccinimide compound described above can be produced usually by reacting polyamine with alkenylsuccinic anhydride obtained by reacting polyolefin with maleic anhydride or alkylsuccinic anhydride obtained by hydrogenating it. [0059]<br>
The succinimide compound of a mono type and the<br>
 <br>

[0060]<br>
In addition to the alkenyl- or alkylsuccinimide compound described above, a boron derivative thereof and/or compounds obtained by modifying them with organic acids may be used as well.  The boron derivative of the alkenyl- or alkylsuccinimide compound, which is produced by a conventional method, can be used.<br>
For example, the polyolefin described above is reacted with maleic anhydride to obtain alkenylsuccinic anhydride, and it is further reacted with an intermediate obtained bv<br>
 <br>
reacting the polyamine described above with a boron compound such as boron oxide, halogenated boron, boric acid, boric anhydride, boric ester, ammonium borate and the like and subjected to irnidation, whereby the boron derivative is obtained.<br>
A boron content in the boron derivative shall not specifically be restricted, and it is usually 0.05 to 5 % by mass, preferably 0.1 to 3 % by mass in terms of boron. [0061]<br>
A content of the above succinimide compounds is 0.5 to 15 % by mass, preferably 1 to 10 % by mass base on a whole amount of the lubricating oil composition.  If it is less than 0.5 % by mass, the effect thereof is less liable to be exhibited, and if it is more than 15 % by mass, the effect meeting the addition thereof is not obtained.  Further, the succinimide compound has a corrosion property to lead, and therefore it is not preferred to add an amount more than necessary.  The succinimide compound has to be suitably selected in order to achieve ah oxidation stability and prevention of metal corrosion in the lubricating oil at the same time.  From the above point of view, the preferred succinimide compound is a polybutenylsuccinimide compound of a bis type containing a polybutenyl group having a number average molecular weight of 1500 or more, and the corrosion property to lead can be inhibited by blending it in a proportion of preferably 60 % or more, more preferably 70 % or<br>
 <br>
more based on a whole nitrogen amount of the succinimide compound.  The succinimide compound may be used alone or in combination of two or more kinds thereof as long as the prescribed amount described above is added. [0062]<br>

metal element, and it is more preferably 0.05 % by mass or more in order to enhance more the oxidation stability, the base number maintaining property and the high temperature cleaning property.  In particular, controlling the content to 0-08 % by mass or more makes it possible to obtain the composition in which a base number and a high temperature cleaning property can be maintained over a long period of time, and therefore it is particularly preferred.

A corrosion property to copper and lead is inhibited in the lubricating oil compositions prepared in Examples 1 to 5. On the other hand, the lubricating oil composition prepared in Comparative Example 1 does not contain the amide base friction controlling agent, the ester base friction controlling agent and the amine base friction controlling agent, and corrosion to copper brought about by MoDTC results in being markedly shown.  On the other hand, in Comparative Example 2 or 5 in which only the amide base friction controlling agent among the friction controlling agents described above was blended, corrosion to copper is improved as compared with Comparative Example 1, but corrosion to lead is elevated more.  Further, in Comparative Examples 3 and 4 in which only the ester base friction controlling agent or the amine base friction controlling agent was blended, corrosion to copper is not observed to be improved.  The lubricating oil composition prepared in Comparative Example 6 contains the amide base friction controlling agent and  the ester base friction controlling agent but does not contain the copper inactivating agent, and it is deteriorated in corrosion to copper.<br>
