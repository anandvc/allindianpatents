				<td>TITLE<br>
Reflective, Solar Control Coated Glass Article<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to coated glass and, in<br>
particular, to visible light reflecting, solar control<br>
coated glass articles.<br>
Coatings on architectural glass are commonly utilized<br>
to provide specific energy absorption and light<br>
transmittance properties. Additionally, coatings provide<br>
desired reflective or spectral properties that are<br>
aesthetically pleasing. The coated articles are often<br>
used singularly or in combination with other coated<br>
articles to form a glazing or window unit.<br>
Coated glass articles are typically produced "on-<br>
line" by continuously coating a glass substrate while it<br>
is being manufactured in a process known in the art as the<br>
"float glass process." Additionally, coated glass<br>
articles are produced "off-line" through a sputtering<br>
process. The former process involves casting glass onto a<br>
molten tin bath which is suitably enclosed, thereafter<br>
transferring the glass, after it is sufficiently cooled,<br>
to lift out rolls which are aligned with the bath, and<br>
finally cooling the glass as it advances across the rolls,<br>
initially through a lehr and thereafter while exposed to<br>
the ambient atmosphere. A non-oxidizing atmosphere is<br>
maintained in the float portion of the process, while the<br><br>
glass is in contact with the molten tin bath, to prevent<br>
oxidation of tin. An oxidizing atmosphere is maintained<br>
in the lehr. In general, the coatings are applied onto<br>
the glass substrate in the float bath of the float bath<br>
process. However, coatings may also be applied onto the<br>
substrate in the lehr.<br>
The attributes of the resulting coated glass<br>
substrate are dependent upon the specific coatings applied<br>
during the float glass process or an off-line sputtering<br>
process. The coating compositions and thicknesses impart<br>
energy absorption and light transmittance properties<br>
within the coated article while also affecting the<br>
spectral properties. Desired attributes may be obtainable<br>
by adjusting the compositions or thicknesses of the<br>
coating layer or layers. However, adjustments to enhance<br>
a specific property can adversely impact other<br>
transmittance or spectral properties of the coated glass<br>
article. Obtaining desired spectral properties is often<br>
difficult when trying to combine specific energy<br>
absorption and light transmittance properties in a coated<br>
glass article.<br>
There is an increasing demand for solar control<br>
glasses, especially high performance solar control glasses<br>
that exhibit a neutral color in both reflection and<br>
transmission. "High performance" solar control glasses<br>
means glasses that transmit a significantly higher<br><br>
percentage of incident light than of total incident<br>
radiation energy (total solar heat).<br>
It would be advantageous to provide a coated stack<br>
for a glass article that is itself color neutral, so that<br>
for the coated glass article, the reflected color from the<br>
film side is neutral, and transmitted color remains<br>
substantially unchanged from that of the selected base<br>
glass. A visible light reflecting, solar control glazing<br>
with a low emittance, and a low solar heat gain<br>
coefficient, would significantly improve energy costs in<br>
buildings and homes while providing a desirable neutral<br>
color for, at least, film side reflection. The low<br>
emittance characteristic of the glazing would minimize any<br>
indirect heat gain from absorption.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the invention there is provided a<br>
visible light reflecting, solar control article comprising<br>
a glass substrate, a first coating deposited over the<br>
glass substrate and a second coating deposited over the<br>
first coating. The first coating is comprised of a doped<br>
metal oxide, and in an especially preferred embodiment is<br>
comprised of fluorine doped tin oxide. The first coating<br>
provides the low emissivity of the coated glass article.<br>
The second coating is comprised of a transparent<br>
metal oxide having a refractive index greater than the<br>
refractive index of the first coating. The addition of<br><br>
the second coating increases the visible light reflectance<br>
of the coated glass article, so that the resulting coated<br>
glass article has a film side reflectance Rf &gt; 15% and an<br>
emissivity less than or equal to about 0.3.<br>
Preferably, the coated glass article includes an<br>
iridescence-suppressing interlayer deposited between the<br>
glass substrate and the first coating of the doped metal<br>
oxide. The coatings are such as to provide a neutral<br>
color in transmittance and reflectance when applied to a<br>
clear glass substrate.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The advantages of the invention will become readily<br>
apparent to those skilled in the art from the following<br>
detailed description of a preferred embodiment when<br>
considered in the light of the accompanying drawings, in<br>
which:<br>
Figure 1 is a sectional view through a coated glass<br>
article in accordance with one embodiment of the<br>
invention.<br>
Figure 2 is a sectional view through a coated glass<br>
article in accordance with a second preferred embodiment<br>
of the invention.<br>
Figure 3 is sectional view through a double glazing<br>
unit incorporating a coated glass article as illustrated<br>
in Figure 1.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Referring to Figure 1, a visible light reflecting,<br>
solar control coated glass article 1 comprises a glass<br>
substrate 11 and a multi-layer coating 12 including a low<br>
emissivity layer 14 and a reflecting layer 13.<br>
The embodiment shown in Figure 2 is similar to the<br>
embodiment of Figure 1, with a coated glass article 2<br>
comprising a glass substrate 21 and a multi-layer coating<br>
22. However, coating 22 differs from coating 12 in that<br>
it comprises, in addition to low emissivity layer 2 4 and<br>
reflecting layer 23, an iridescence suppressing underlayer<br>
25 as further discussed hereinafter.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates the coated glass pane 1 of<br>
Figure 1 assembled in parallel spaced apart relationship<br>
with a second pane of glazing material 31, typically of<br>
clear float glass, the panes being spaced apart and sealed<br>
together by spacing and sealing system 32, to form double<br>
glazing unit 3 having airspace 33. The coating 12 faces<br>
the airspace 33 of the unit, with the coating facing<br>
towards the interior of the glazed space (usually, but not<br>
necessarily, a building). The second pane of glazing<br>
material 31 may, in certain preferred embodiments, be<br>
provided with a low emissivity layer (not shown) facing<br>
towards the airspace 33.<br>
The glass substrates suitable for use in preparing<br>
the coated glass article according to the present<br>
invention may include any of the conventional glass<br><br>
compositions known in the art as useful for the<br>
preparation of architectural glazings The preferred<br>
substrate is a tinted float glass ribbon wherein the<br>
coatings of the present invention are applied in the<br>
heated zone of the float glass process. Additionally,<br>
clear glass substrates may be suitable for applying the<br>
multilayered stack of the invention. However, the tinted<br>
glass substrates are especially preferred for their impact<br>
on the spectral and energy transmittance properties of the<br>
coated glass article.<br>
The low emissivity layer is a layer of a metal<br>
compound, normally a metal oxide (as other low emissivity<br>
compounds such as metal nitrides and metal silicides tend<br>
to have lower light transmissions), and a transparent<br>
semiconductor, for example, a doped indium, tin or zinc<br>
oxide. Preferred materials include tin doped indium oxide<br>
and fluorine doped tin oxide, with fluorine doped tin<br>
oxide being especially preferred. The low emissivity<br>
layer will normally have a thickness in the range 1000 A<br>
to 6000 A (as use of a thicker layer is likely to result<br>
in an unnecessary reduction in light transmission without<br>
sufficient reduction in emissivity to compensate),<br>
especially a thickness in the range 2000 A to 5000 A. The<br>
low emissivity layer provides an emissivity of less than<br>
0.3 (the numerical values of emissivity referred to in<br>
this description and the accompanying claims are values of<br><br>
hemispherical emissivity (Eh)), although it is preferred<br>
to use a low emissivity layer which provides an emissivity<br>
of 0.2 or less.<br>
The reflecting layer is deposited over the low<br>
emissivity layer in the coated glass article of the<br>
invention. The reflecting layer has a refractive index in<br>
the visible spectrum that is greater than the refractive<br>
index of the low emissivity layer. The refractive index<br>
of the reflecting layer will generally be greater than or<br>
equal to about 2.0. The reflecting layer is normally a<br>
layer of a transparent metal oxide, such as oxides of<br>
titanium, zirconium or chromium. An oxide of titanium is<br>
an especially preferred material for forming the<br>
reflecting layer of the coated glass article.<br>
Titanium oxide coatings formed by atmospheric<br>
pressure chemical vapor deposition, such as those<br>
described in U.S. Patent No. 6,238,738, which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference, are known to be<br>
photocatalytic and hydrophilic. Thus, use of the coating<br>
stack of the invention on an exterior-facing surface of a<br>
glazing will result in so-called "self-cleaning"<br>
properties. Of course, use of the coating stack of the<br>
invention on the exterior-facing surface of an insulated<br>
glass unit will negatively impact the solar control<br>
properties relative to use of the same coating stack on an<br>
unexposed surface of a pane of an insulating glass unit.<br><br>
Use of thin films, as in the present invention, may-<br>
result in the appearance of interference colors and<br>
iridescence. To avoid, or at least alleviate, undesirable<br>
color resulting from interference effects, a color<br>
suppressing underlayer (which may itself be a combination<br>
of sub-layers) may be applied to the glass prior to<br>
deposition of the low emissivity and reflecting layers.<br>
Iridescence-suppressing coatings are conventionally known<br>
within the art. For example, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,187,33 6;<br>
4,419,386; and 4,206,252, herein incorporated by<br>
reference, describe coating techniques suitable for<br>
suppressing interference colors. The interlayer of the<br>
present invention may comprise a single iridescence-<br>
suppressing coating, a two-layer coating, or a gradient<br>
coating. Thus, according to a preferred aspect of the<br>
invention, an iridescence suppressing layer or layers is<br>
incorporated under the coating comprising a low emissivity<br>
layer and reflecting layer.<br>
The low emissivity layer and reflecting layer of the<br>
present invention may be deposited by known techniques,<br>
for example, by sputtering, including reactive sputtering,<br>
or by chemical vapor deposition. Indeed, it is an<br>
important advantage of the invention that both the above<br>
layers are susceptible to deposition by chemical vapor<br>
deposition techniques providing for the possibility of<br>
applying the coating to the hot ribbon of glass during the<br>
glass production process. Methods of depositing metal<br><br>
oxides by chemical vapor deposition are described, for<br>
example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,698,262; 5,773,086 and<br>
6,238,738, each of which is incorporated by reference<br>
herein.<br>
The invention is illustrated but not limited by the<br>
following Examples. In the Examples, as in the remainder<br>
of the description and claims, Tvis represents the visible<br>
light transmission measured using Illuminant C on a<br>
Perkin-Elmer Lambda 19 spectrophotometer. The total solar<br>
heat transmissions (Tsol) stated are determined by<br>
weighting with a solar spectral irradiance function (ASTM<br>
E891-87) that represents the direct normal radiation<br>
incident on a surface (air mass 1.5). The Rg and Rf are<br>
the total visible light reflectances measured from the<br>
glass and film sides respectively. These reflectances<br>
were measured using a Colorsphere spectrophotometer<br>
available from BYK Gardner Scientific. SHGC is the solar<br>
heat gain coefficient and SC is the shading coefficient.<br>
The winter time U values and summer time U values are<br>
denoted as Uwin and Usum respectively. The color of light<br>
transmitted and reflected from the film side of the coated<br>
glass articles is measured according to the CIELAB color<br>
scale coordinates of a* and b*.<br>
Examples 1-3<br>
The multi-layer coating stacks of Examples 1-3 were<br>
deposited by chemical vapor deposition on a clear float<br><br>
glass ribbon during the float glass production process.<br>
The glass was 3-3.2 mm in thickness. An iridescence-<br>
suppressing interlayer was first deposited onto the<br>
surface of the glass substrate in the heated zone of a<br>
float glass production process. The iridescence-<br>
suppressing layer included a tin oxide coating deposited<br>
on and adhered to the glass substrate. The tin oxide was<br>
applied by chemical vapor deposition in the heated zone of<br>
the float glass process by introducing dimethyl tin<br>
dichloride in an oxidizing atmosphere over the surface of<br>
the substrate. A silicon dioxide coating was then applied<br>
onto the surface of the tin oxide coating by reacting<br>
silane, in the presence of oxygen and ethylene, near the<br>
surface of the substrate in the heated zone of the float<br>
process.<br>
A fluorine doped tin oxide coating was deposited onto<br>
the surface of the silicon dioxide coating. The fluorine<br>
doped tin oxide coating was deposited by chemical vapor<br>
deposition in the heated zone of the float glass process<br>
by introducing dimethyl tin dichloride, water and hydrogen<br>
fluoride in an oxidizing atmosphere over the surface of<br>
the substrate.<br>
A titanium dioxide coating was deposited onto the<br>
surface of the fluorine doped tin oxide coating. The<br>
titanium dioxide coating was also deposited by chemical<br>
vapor deposition in the heated zone of the float glass<br>
process by introducing titanium tetrachloride and an<br><br>
organic oxygen source over the surface of the substrate,<br>
as described in U.S. Patent No. 6,238,738.<br>
The layer thicknesses in Angstroms, measured<br>
optically, and the properties of the resulting coated<br>
glass articles are shown below in Table 1. In each case,<br>
the haze was less than 1.0%.<br><br>
Examples 4 -15<br>
A coated glass article was produced in accordance<br>
with Examples 1-3 having the following layer thicknesses:<br>
271 A Sn02, 172 Å Si02, 2100 Å Sn02:F, and 300 Å Ti02 <br>
The Eh of the sample was measured to be 0.22. Properties<br>
were then calculated for this coating stack on various<br>
glass substrates, clear and a variety of tints, having a<br>
thickness of 1/4 inch. These examples are numbered 4-9 and<br>
are shown below in Table 2.<br>
Properties were also calculated for the same coated<br>
glass articles of Examples 4-9 as utilized as the outboard<br>
light in an insulated glass unit with the coating stack<br>
facing the interior of the structure. A 1/4 inch thick<br><br>
clear glass sheet was used as the inboard light of the<br>
insulated glass unit and positioned at 1/4 inch from the<br>
coated article. These examples are numbered 10-15 and are<br>
shown below in Table 3.<br><br><br>
The glasses used in the above examples are all<br>
commercially available from Pilkington North America, Inc.<br>
of Toledo, Ohio. Examples 4 and 10 are on clear glass;<br>
examples 5 and 11 are on a blue glass sold under the<br>
trademark Arctic Bluetm; examples 6 and 12 are on blue-<br>
green glass; examples 7 and 13 are on bronze glass;<br>
examples 8 and 14 are on a green glass sold under the<br>
trademark Evergreentm; and examples 9 and 15 are on grey-<br>
glass .<br>
The coatings of the present invention offer important<br>
advantages over the prior art. Being suitable for<br>
production by pyrolytic methods (which have the added<br>
benefit of lending themselves to application on-line) they<br>
can be obtained in highly durable form, reducing the need<br>
for special care in handling and processing and opening up<br>
the possibility of using the coatings in free standing<br>
glazing without the need to protect them within multiple<br>
glazing units.<br>
Moreover, excellent performance may be achieved, with<br>
coated glass articles having an emissivity less than or<br>
equal to about 0.3 and preferably less than or equal to<br>
about 0.2, and an Rf of 15% or more, preferably 18% or<br>
more, and most preferably 20% or more. When deposited on<br>
a suitable tinted glass, the resulting coated glass<br>
articles have an SHGC of 0.5 or less, preferably 0.45 or<br>
less .<br><br>
The preferred coated glasses of the present invention<br>
are glasses wherein the coating is such as to exhibit<br>
reflection (when viewed from the coated side) and<br>
transmission (when applied to clear float glass) colors<br>
such that (a*2 + b*2)1/2 is less than 12, especially less<br>
than 10. In especially preferred embodiments, the<br>
reflection and transmission colors are each such that<br>
(a*2 + b*2)1/2 is less than 7.<br><br>
