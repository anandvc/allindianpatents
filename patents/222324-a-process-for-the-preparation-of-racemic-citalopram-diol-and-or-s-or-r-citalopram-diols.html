The invention relates to a process for the preparation of racemic citalopram diol and R- or S-citalopram diol by separating an initial non-racemic mixture of the compounds R- and S-citalopram diol (R- and iS,-4-[4-(dimethylamino)-l-(4'-fluorophenyl)-l-hydimybutyl]-3-(hydroxymethyl)-benzoritrile) into a fraction of racemic citalopram diol and a fraction being enriched with S-diol or R-diol. The invention also relates to the use of such isolated citalopram diols for the formation of the corresponding racemic citalopram and/or S- or R-citalopram to be comprised in a pharmaceutical composition.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Citalopram is a well-known antidepressant drug that has now been on the market for some years and has the following structure:<br><br><br>
Further, the S-enantiomer of citalopram (escitalopram) is a valuable antidepressant of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRJ) type. Escitalopram may be prepared<br><br>
by ring closure of 5-444-(dime%lamino)-l-(4'-fluorophenyl)-l-hydroxybutyl]-3-(hydroxymethyl)-benzonitrile (S-diol) with retention of configuration as described in EP Bl 347 066. The amount of R-citalopram compared to S-citalopram in the product escitalopram should be less than 3%.<br>
Furthermore, a method for the preparation of a mixture of R- and S-citalopram with more than 50% of the 5-enatiomer from a mixture of R- and R-diol with more than 50% of the R-diol is described in WO03000672.<br>
It appears from the above, that products of racemic citalopram and escitalopram with the above-mentioned enantiomeric purity are required for the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions and that racemic citalopram and escitalopram products may be prepared by ring closure of the RR-diol and R-diol and/or S-diol. As a consequence, methods for the preparation of products of racemic diol and S-diol being correspondingly enantiomerically pure are required.<br>
Processes for the preparation and purification ofR- or 5-diol products are available. Such processes involve for instance enantio-selective synthesis as described in EP 0347066, classical resolution and chromatographic separation as described in WO03006449. Depending on the specific process and the conditions used, the enantiomeric purity of the S-diol product may have to be improved before the S-diol product will meet the above requirements.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that by using the process of the invention an expensive, but apparently useless S-diol product being contaminated with 22-diol, may easily be converted into the two valuable products, racemic diol and 5-diol, which meet the above requirements as regards enantiomeric purity.<br>
Furthermore, by using the process of the invention, an expensive, but apparently useless R-diol product being contaminated with S-diol, may easily be converted into the valuable products, racemic diol and R-diol, which meet the above requirements as regards enantiomeric purity.<br><br>
More particularly, the present invention provides a process for the separation of an initial non-racemic mixture of R- and6r-4-[4-(dimethylamino)-l-(4'-fluorophenyl)-l-hydroxybutyl]-3-(hydroxymethyl)-benzonitrile with more than 50% of one of the enantiomers into a fraction being enriched with S-diol or R-diol and a fraction comprising RS-diol, wherein the ratio of R-diolS-diol is equal to 1:1 or closer to 1:1 than in the initial mixture of R- and S-diol.<br>
The process of the invention is important and very useful, in particular because it provides a convenient, cheap and efficient way to transform a mixture of R- and S-diols which does not meet the above requirements as regards enantiomeric purity into two valuable products, ASrdiol and S-diol (orR-diol), which meet the above requirements as regards enantiomeric purity.<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides a convenient, cheap and efficient method for making an intermediate to be used in the manufacturing of citalopram and escitalopram.<br>
With the present invention, the process for the production of racemic citalopram and escitalopram meeting the requirements of the respective marketing approvals has become more rational and more economical as regards the simplicity of the process and the utilisation of reagents and resources.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Thus, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of racemic diol free base and/or acid addition salt and/or R- or S-diol free base and/or an acid addition salt comprising a separation of an initial non-racemic mixture of R- and S-diol free base and/or acid addition salt with more than 50% of one of the enantiomers into a fraction being enriched with R-diol or R-diol free base and/or acid addition salt and a fraction comprising RSdioLfree base and/or acid addition salt wlierein the ratio of R-diol:5-diol is equal to 1:1 or closer to 1:1 than in the initial mixture of R- and S-diol wherein<br><br>

iv)      the free bases of the diols obtained are optionally converted to acid addition salts thereof or acid addition salts of the diols obtained are optionally converted to other acid addition salts or acid addition salts of the diols obtained are optionally converted to the corresponding free bases.<br>
Accordingly, the iff-diol free base and/or acid addition salt obtained gives rise to the final solution phase being enriched with either the S- or R-diol free base and/or acid addition salt. The surplus of R- or S-diol free base and/or acid addition salt may then be isolated from the final solution phase as described below.<br><br>

According to yet another embodiment of the invention, the initial non-racemic mixture of R- and S-diol free base and/or acid addition salt used in the process of the invention contains less than 99.9% of R-diol, such as less than 99.5% of R-diol, or less than 99% R-diol, or less than 98% of R-diol.<br>
Accordingly, the initial non-racemic mixture of R- and 5-diol free base and/or acid addition salt may contain 50%-98% of R-dil, or 50%-99% of R-diol, or 50%-99.5% of R diol, or 50%-99.9% of R-dil, or 70%-98% of R-diol, or 70%-99% of R-diol, or 70%-99.5% of R-diol, or 70%-99.9% of R-diol, or 90%-98% of R-diol, or 90%-99% of R-diol, or 90%-99.5% of R-diol, or-90%-99.9% of R-diol.<br>
The process may be repeated until a racemic mixture of R- and 5-diols s obtained and/or until the desired degree of enantiomeric purity of the R- or S-diol s obtained.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, the RSdiol of the residue/precipitate s in the form of a free base and/or an acid addition salt; and independently thereof the R- or S-diol of the final solution phase s in the form of a free base and/or an acid addition salt.

Furthermore, when the RS-dio\ comprsed in the residue/precipitate s in the form of an acid addition salt, then the R- or R-diol comprsed in the final solution phase, may be in the form of a free base, an acid addition salt or a mixture of a free base and acid addition salt. Finally, when the RS-diol comprsed in the residue/precipitate s a mixture of a free base and an acid<br><br>
addition salt, then the R- or S-diol comprsed in the final solution phase, may be in the form of a free base, an acid addition salt or a mixture of a free base and acid addition salt.<br>
The initial non-racemic mixture of R- and S- diol used in the process of the invention may be present as the free base, as salts, or as a mixture of free bases and salts.<br>
Furthermore, the free bases of the diols obtained are optionally converted to acid addition salts thereof or acid addition salts of the diols obtained are optionally converted to other acid addition salts or acid addition salts of the diols obtained are optionally converted to the corresponding free bases by methods known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Precipitation of the iiS free base may be carried out by obtaining or dssolving the non-racemic mixture of R- and S-diol free base and/or acid addition salt in a suitable solvent, optionally by applying heat, and then allowing the solution to cool, or by cooling to below ambient temperature. The precipitate s then separated from the mother liquor, preferably by filtration or decanting.<br>
A residue of Rs-diol free base may be formed by selective dssolution of R- or S-diol free base and/or acid addition salt into a solvent from the initial non-racemic mixture of R- and S-diols free base and/or acid addition salt in said solvent. The residue s then separated from the organic and/or aqueous phase resulting from the selective dssolution of R- or 5-diol.<br>
If the residue/precipitate s crystalline, the crystals are optionally recrystallsed one or more times to form racemic diol free base. Then, racemic citalopram free base may be formed from the racemic diol free base by ring closure. The free base of racemic citalopram may optionally be converted to an acid addition salt thereof, preferably the hydrobromide salt.<br><br>
If the residue/precipitate formed s an oil or an amorphous solid, steps i) and ii) maybe repeated until a crystalline product s obtained. The crystals obtained are optionally recrystallsed one or more times to form racemic diol free base. Racemic citalopram free base may be formed from the racemic diol free base by ring closure. The free base of racemic citalopram s optionally converted to an acid addition salt thereof, preferably the hydrobromide salt.<br>
The RS-diol free base prepared according to the invention s optionally converted to acid addition salts thereof.<br>
An oily phase separated from the final solution phase s optionally subjected to conventional purification processes.<br>
The RSdiol free base prepared according to the invention may contain a minor excess of the S-diol (or R-diol). It may thus be necessary to repeat steps i) and ii) (in particular crystallsation) of the Rs'-diol free base one or more times in order to obtain racemic diol. The final solution phases may be pooled together and the diol enantiomer contained herein may be solated as described below.<br>
Suitable solvents for obtaining the residue/precipitate comprsing the RR-diol free base are apolar solvents for example alkanes, such as heptane or hexane, aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene, benzene and xylene, polar solvents such as acetonitrile, alcohols such as methanol and so-propylalcohol or ketones such as methyl sobutyl ketone; or mixtures thereof.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, a free base of the RS-diol s obtained in step i), preferably in crystalline form.<br>
If necessary, crystallsation may be initiated by seeding with racemic crystalline diol free base.<br><br>
The precipitation of -diol acid addition salt may be carried out by obtaining or dssolving the non-racemic mixture of R- and S-diol free base or acid addition salt in a suitable solvent, if necessary by applying heat, and adding an acid, for example as a solid, a liquid, in a solution or as a gas.<br>
The acid used for the precipitation of a -diol acid addition salt s an acid which precipitates a mixture of R- and S-enantiomers and leaves the mother liquor enriched with either the R- or S-diol enantiomer of the diol as the free base or an acid addition salt.<br>
The acid used for the precipitation of a RR-diol acid addition salt may be:<br>
•	added after the initial non-racemic mixture of R- and S-diol free base and/or acid addition salt s obtained or dssolved in a suitable solvent; and/or<br>
•	present in the solvent during and/or prior to dssolution of the initial non-racemic mixture of R- and S-diol free base and/or acid addition salt; and/or -<br>
•	present in the initial non-racemic mixture of R- and S-diol free base and/or acid addition salt during and/or prior to dssolution in the solvent.<br>
A residue of R5-diol acid addition salt may be formed by selective dssolution of R- or S-diol free base and/or acid addition salt into a solvent from the initial non-racemic mixture of R- and S-diols free base and/or acid addition salt in said solvent, if necessary by adding an acid, for example as a solid, a liquid, in a solution or as a gas; or mixtures thereof.<br>
The acidic part of a RR-diol acid addition salt of the residue formed in step i) s an acid, which allows the selective dssolution of either R- or S-diol free base and/or acid addition salt and leaves the undssolved material enriched with the -diol acid addition salt<br>
The acid used for forming the RS-diol acid addition salt of the residue may be:<br><br>
•	present in the solvent before the initial non-racemic mixture of R- and S-diol free base and/or acid addition salt s mixed with the solvent; and/or<br>
•	mixed with the solvent together with the initial non-racemic mixture of R-and S-diol free base and/or acid addition salt; and/or<br>
•	mixed with the solvent after the initial non-racemic mixture of R- and S-diol free base and/or acid addition salt s mixed with the solvent; and/or<br>
•	present in the initial non-racemic mixture of R- and 5-diol free base and/or acid addition salt during and/or prior to the mixing with the solvent.<br>
Suitable acids for the formation of a residue/precipitate of R5'-diol acid addition salt from an initial non-racemic mixture of R- and S-diol free base and/or acid addition salt are inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid and sulphuric acid or organic acids such as oxalic acid, R-J;oluenesulfomc acid, methanesulfonic acid and acetic acid. Hydrobromic acid, hydrochloric acid and oxalic acid are preferred acids. When these acids are used, a hydrobromide salt,'hydrochloride salt or oxalate salt of the tfs-diol s formed, preferably in crystalline form. Suitably, up to 10 equivalents of acid s used. Accordingly:<br>
•	0.2-10 R-dil of acid may be used, such as 0.2-0.4 R-dil, or 0.4-0.6 R-dil, or 0.9-1.1 R-dil or 1.8-2.2 R-dil of acid s used for each R-dil of S- andR-diol comprsed in the initial non-racemic mixture of R- and S-diol free base and/or acid addition salt; and/or<br>
