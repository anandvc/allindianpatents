DISASTER   PREVENTING   SYSTEM  USING  DIGITAL   RADIO COMMUNICATION<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a disaster prevention system using digital wireless communication.<br>
Background Art<br>
Generally, there has been installed a disaster prevention system and an initial fire fighting device for rapidly suppressing an initial fire, for example, a sprinkler, a fire shutter, a damper (or fan), etc, to protect the lives of occupants and property when a fire occurs in a tall building having a lot of transient population such as an apartment, a department store, a multiplex theater, etc.<br>
A technique for implementing one of the prior art<br>
disaster prevention systems is disclosed in a Korean Patent<br>
No.   10-0373769,   entitled   "DISASTER  PREVENTION  SYSTEM"<br>
(hereinafter  referred  to  as  "earlier  application")  and<br>
patented by the present application.<br>
In the earlier application, the prior art disaster prevention system includes a plurality of fire sensing units for sensing a fire or smoke, generating fire information and<br><br>
transmitting the fire information wirelessly, at least one or more repeaters for receiving the fire information inputted from the fire sensing units, and a signal processing unit for analyzing the fire information inputted from the repeaters, displaying the location of the fire when a fire occurs, and outputting a fire alarm.<br>
The plurality of fire sensing units are installed in a plurality of positions in a building to sense fires. The repeaters are installed in each floor of the building to receive fire information inputted from the plurality of fire sensing units. A signal processing unit is installed in a main management suite to control and manage the entire building, for example, a guardroom to monitor a fire occurrence while it transmit/receives fire information in real-time to/from the repeater. If a fire occurs, the repeater and the signal processing unit display the location of the fire, respectively, and output a fire alarm, so that occupants of the building and building managers are notified as to the location of the fires.<br>
The disaster prevention system in the earlier application is implemented to communicate fire information between the fire sensing units and repeaters wirelessly, or implemented in a power line communication (PLC) manner using a DTMF signal as a carrier to modulate fire information between the repeater and the signal processing unit to be<br><br>
loaded to AC power. Therefore, the earlier application has advantages in that it is easy to construct since it does not additionally require a signal transmission line, thereby reducing the costs therefor.<br>
However, the earlier application has disclosed only that the prior art disaster prevention system is designed to automatically call telephones of government offices such as a fire station, police station, etc., and a manager when a fire occurs, but does not propose specific elements to achieve the object.<br>
Meanwhile, a sprinkler as an initial fire fighting device currently used is generally installed on the ceiling within a building and its head is sealed by solder. Therefore, if the sprinkler is heated to a temperature of above about 80°C, the solder sealing the head of the sprinkler is melted to automatically spray water at a predetermined pressure therefrom. As such, since the prior art sprinkler is implemented to operate only if the temperature is over 80°C, it still has problems that it may not operate properly even if a fire occurs.<br>

invention to provide a disaster prevention system using digital wireless communication capable of outputting a fire alarm when a fire occurs, displaying a location of the fire, and also driving an initial fire fighting device installed at the location of the fire so that the fire can be rapidly suppressed while still in its initial stage.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a disaster prevention system using wireless communication capable of providing convenience of construction and reducing construction costs.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a disaster prevention system using wireless communication capable of stably operating even if external AC power is not supplied thereto.<br>
It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a disaster prevention system using wireless communication capable of automatically and rapidly calling a corresponding office and corresponding manager when a fire occurs.<br>

As such, the disaster prevention system of the present invention outputs a fire alarm when sensing a fire, displays<br><br>
the location of the fire, notifies occupants of building and manager of the fire and the location of the fire, and controls operations of the initial fire fighting device installed at the location of the fire. Therefore, the fire can be initially and rapidly suppressed to safely protect the lives of occupants and their properties.<br>
In accordance with an aspect of the disaster prevention system of the present invention, the repeater further includes a first power line communication interface unit for transmitting a carrier signal containing fire information to a fire signal processing unit, such that the carrier signal is mixed with AC power of a power line, and receiving the carrier signal from the fire signal processing unit, such that the carrier signal is mixed with AC power of power line, and also the signal processing unit further includes a second power line communication interface unit for receiving a carrier signal mixed with AC power of a power line from the first power line communication interface unit, and transmitting a carrier signal containing fire information, such that the carrier signal is mixed to AC power of the power line.<br>

Namely, in the prior art disaster prevention system, a sprinkler is implemented to operate only if it is heated to a temperature of above 80°C when a fire occurs. Meanwhile, the sprinkler 371 according to one embodiment of the present invention is operated as a fire sensor 11 outputs a fire sensing signal if it senses a<br><br>
temperature of about 50°C.   Therefore,  it can correctly operate when a fire occurs.<br>
After that, the controlling unit 33 sequentially selects one of telephone numbers of government offices/managers, which are stored in a telephone number DB 315, and then outputs the selected telephone number together with a telephone call control signal to the dial controller 361 at step S45. The call circuit unit 36 inputting the telephone call control signal from the controlling unit 33 at the step S45 generates a DTMF signal corresponding to the selected telephone number to output it to the telephone office.<br>
After that, the controlling unit 33 detects a tone signal related to state information of a called party's telephone from the telephone office. If the detected tone signal is a ring back tone signal, the controlling unit counts the ring back tone signal and determines whether there is a response within a predetermine time at step S46. If there is a response, corresponding voice information stored in the voice memory 315 is outputted at step S47. If there is not, the controlling unit determines whether the telephone number is the last number as step S48. Meanwhile, if the detected tone signal is a busy tone signal, the controlling unit determines whether the telephone number is the last number at step S48.<br><br>
After performing the step 48, if the telephone number is not the last number, the controlling unit selects the next telephone number of government offices/mangers and outputs the selected telephone number together with a telephone call control signal to the dial controller 361 at step S45. Meanwhile, if the telephone number is the last number, the process is ended at step S49.<br>
The controlling unit according to the present invention can be implemented to automatically call all the telephone numbers of government offices/mangers stored in the telephone number DB 315 when a fire occurs. Therefore the government offices and managers can rapidly respond to fires.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
As apparent from the above description, the disaster prevention system of the present invention constructed to have a dual alarm system, in which the repeaters and the signal processing unit have a display unit and an emergency bell, respectively, can notify occupants of the building and building managers of a fire and the location of the fire when the fire occurs. Especially, since the signal processing unit controls operations of the initial fire fighting device installed in the location of the fire, a<br><br>
fire can be initially and rapidly suppressed and thusly the occupants and their properties can be safely protected therefrom.<br>
Also, the disaster prevention system of the present invention can automatically call government offices such as a fire station and police station, and corresponding mangers, therefore a fire can be fully suppressed and the location of the fire can be controlled.<br>
Also, since the fire sensing unit and the repeater can be implemented to communicate fire information wirelessly and the repeater and the signal processing unit can be implemented to communicate fire information in a power line communication manner, the disaster prevention system of the present invention does not additionally require a signal transmission line. Therefore, it can provide convenience of construction and reduce the costs therefor.<br>
