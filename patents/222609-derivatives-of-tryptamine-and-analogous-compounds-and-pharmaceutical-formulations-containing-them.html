				<td>DERIVATIVES OF TRYPTAMINE AND ANALOGOUS COMPOUNDS, AND PHARMACEUTICAL FORMULATIONS CONTAINING THEM<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to new compounds which are derivatives of tryptamine and their analogs, pharmaceutical formulations containing them, and use of the compounds in the manufacture of medicaments for treating various diseases.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Melatonin is the principal hormone secreted by the pineal gland in all vertebrates. In all mammals studied to date, including humans, a nocturnal rise in the production of melatonin by the pineal gland is evident; melatonin production by the body is acutely suppressed by light. Melatonin is involved in the coordination of photoperiod dependent and physiological processes. The ability of the animals or humans to respond to the melatonin signal may depend upon melatonin receptors. Melatonin acts on the CNS to affect neural mechanisms through receptors located in the brain. Additionally, a number of studies indicate the existence of direct effects of melatonin in peripheral organs via peripheral melatonin receptors. Melatonin receptors are present in the heart, lungs, prostate gland, gonads, white blood cells, retina, pituitary, thyroid, kidney, gut and blood vessels. Retention patterns of radioactive-melatonin injected to rats demonstrate melatonin accumulation in the brain, pituitary, lung, heart, gonads and accessory sex organs (Withyachumnarnkul et al., Life Sci 12:1757-65, 1986).<br>
The synthesis and secretion of melatonin exhibit a circadian rhythm that changes with the seasons and with age, e.g., pubescence and senescence. There is very strong evidence that melatonin is important for the regulation of a variety of neural and endocrine functions, especially those that exhibit circadian and circannual rhythmicity.<br>
Melatonin has been implicated in many human disorders. Some are known to be linked to chronobiological abnormalities. Melatonin has been administered to re-synchronize circadian rhythms that are out of phase with the local photoperiodical cycle. For example, sleep/wake disorders with rapid crossing of time zones Get lag), or in delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS) patients, changes in work shifts, or those experienced by blind people can be treated with melatonin or melatonin<br><br>
analogs (see U.S.  Patents Nos. 4,600,723 and 4,666,086 of Short et al. and 5,242,941 of Lewyetal.).<br>
However, it appears that melatonin also has direct sedative/hypnotic properties in normal human subjects (e.g., Waldhauser et a!., Psychopharmacology, 100: 222-226, 1990; Vollrath et al., Bioscience 29:327-329, 1981: Dollins et al., Proc. Natl .Acad. Sci, 99:1824-1828, 1994, U.S Patent No. 5,403,851 of D'Orlando et al). Three melatonin receptor subtypes have been identified so far mt-1, MT-2 and Mel 1c (Barrett et a!., Biol. Signals Recept., 1999, 8: 6-14). MT-2 is localized mainly in the central nervous system and mt-1, localized in the CNS as well as in peripheral organs such as kidney and the urogenital tract (Dubocovich et al., lUPHAR media, London, UK, 187-93, 1998). The presently known subtypes are not sufficient to evaluate the large variety of melatonin effects and additional receptor subtypes await discovery.<br>
Melatonin has been demonstrated in a number of rodent experimental paradigms to have both anxiolytic (Golus and King, Pharmacol. Biochem, Behav., 41:405-408, 1992, Naranjo-Rodriguez et al., Soc. Neurosci. Abst. 18:1167, 1992; Golombek et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol, 237:231-236, 1993) and antiseizure activity (Brallowsky, Electroencephalo. din. Neurophysiol. 41:314-319, 1976: Farielloet al., Neurology 27:567-570, 1977, Rudeen et a!., Epilepsia 21:149-154, 1980; Sugden, J. Phamiacol Exp. Ther. 227:587-591, 1983; Golombek et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol 210:253-258, 1992).<br>
Melatonin is effective in the treatment of cluster headache and migraine (Claustrat et al.. Headache, 29:241-4, 1989). Melatonin may play a role in other psychiatric conditions, particularly depression, but also mania and schizophrenia (see Dobocovich "Antidepressant Agents", U.S. Patent No. 5,093,352; Miles and Philbrick, Biol. Psychiatry 23:405-425, 1988: Sandyk and Kay, Schizophr. Bull. 16:653-662, 1990). In some instance, psychiatric disorders may have underlying chronobiological etiologies (e.g. seasonal effective disorder) and are definite candidates for melatonin therapy.<br>
Melatonin is involved in the regulation of circadian and circannual changes in body temperature. Administration of exogenous melatonin to humans lowers core body temperature (Strassman et al., J. Appl. Physiol, 71:2178-2182, 1991; Cagnacci et al.. J Clin. Endocrinol. Merab. 75:447-452, 1992). Melatonin may also possess analgesic properties  (Sugden,  J.   Pharmacol.   Exp.   Ther.   227:587-591,   1983).<br><br>
Therefore, melatonin-like compounds may be useful as an alternative to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory, anti-pyretic drugs, such as aspirin, acetaminophen and ibuprofen.<br>
It is known that melatonin levels decrease with advancing age (Sack et al., J. Pineal Res. 4:379-388, 1986; Waldhauser et al., J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab., 66:648-652, 1988; Van Coavorden et al., Am. J. Physiol. 260:E651-661, 1991) which may contribute to some disorders, Neurodegenerative diseases often associated with aging, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, may be treated with melatoninergic compounds (Maurizi, Med. Hypotheses 31:233-242, 1990; Sandyk, Int. J. Neurosci. 50:37-53, 1990; Skene et al., Brain Rev. 528:170-174, 1990).<br>
Sleep disorders in the elderly have been shown to respond to melatonin treatment (Garfinkel et al., Lancet, 346:541-543. 1995, U.S. Patent No. 5,498.423 of Zisapel). Soporific effects of melatonin (0.3-240 mg) have been reported in humans following intravenous, intranasal and oral administration. Apart from its soporific effects, exogenous melatonin may affect sleep via its phase-resetting action on the biological clock. Melatonin administration advanced sleep in delayed sleep syndrome patients, and synchronized sleep to the day-night cycles in blind subjects. The efficacy of melatonin (0.3-5 mg/os) for treatment of insomnia has been demonstrated in studies performed mainly with elderly patients, patients treated with atenolol and chronic heart patients, most of which patients have low or distorted melatonin rhythms. In some of these studies, formulations which release melatonin throughout the night were used, in order to circumvent fast clearance of the hormone and to mimic its endogenous profile (Nutrition, 1998, 14: 1-2; The Aging Male, 1998, 1: 1-8). Melatonin, 3 mg, given to patients with sleep disorders and dementia for 21 days, significantly augmented sleep quality and decreased the number of wakening episodes, while agitated behavior at night (sundowning) decreased significantly (Biol. Signals Recept. 1999, 8(1-2): 126-31).<br>
We have recently found that melatonin treatment may be beneficial not only for improving sleep quality, but may also lead to an improvement in the general state of diabetic patients, as indicated by the decrease in HbA1c levels after long-term treatment.<br>
Daily melatonin supplementation to male Sprague-Dawley rats, starting at middle age (10 months) and continuing into old age (22 months) via the drinking water at a dosage of 4 pg/ml, restored the age-related elevated levels of relative (% of body weight) retroperitoneal and epididvmal fat. as well as plasma insulin and<br><br>
leptin levels to youthful (4 month) levels (Rasmussen et al., Endocrinology, 1999, 140(2): 1009-12).<br>
Even osteoporosis may have a melatoninergic component (Sandyk et al., Int. J. Neurosci. 62:215-225, 1992). In fact, melatonin has been suggested to be an anti-aging, anti-stress hormone (Armstrong and Redman, Med. Hypotheses 34:300-309, 1991; Reiter, Bioassays, 14:169-175, 1992). This may be due to its action as a free radical scavenger (Pooggeler et al., J. Pineal Res. 14:151-168, 1993) or its interaction with the immune system (Maestroni and Conti, J. Neuroimmun. 28:167-176 1990; Fraschini et al., Acta. Oncol. 29:775-776 1990, Guerrero and Reiter, Endocr. Res. 18:91-113, 1992). Melatonin may protect from ischemic stroke (Cho et a!., Brain Research 755:335-338, 1997), decrease cell-death in Alzheimer's disease (Pappola et al., J Neurosci 17:1683-90, 1997) and lower the risk of SIDS in young infants with low endogenous melatonin levels (Israel Patents Nos. 115861/2 and U.S Patent No. 5,500,225 of Laudon et al).<br>
Related to the above, are the findings that melatonin has oncostatic properties in a variety of cancers, the most studied being its effect on estrogen receptor positive breast cancers (Blasak and Hill, J. Neural. Transm. Suppl. 21:433-449, 1986; Gonzalez et al. Melanoma. Res. 1:237-243, 1991; Lissoni et al. Eur. J. Cancer 29A:185-189, 1993; Shellard et al. Br. J. Cancer 60:288-290, 1989; Philo and Berkowitz, J. Urol. 139:1099-1102, 1988; see U.S. Patents. Nos. 5,196,435 of Clemens et al. and 5,272,141 of Fraschini et al.). It is also possible that melatonin has antiproliferative effects on noncancerous cells as well and may be of use to treat benign tumors and proliferative diseases such as BPH (U.S. Patent No. 5,750,557 and European Patent No. EP 0565296B of Zisapel) and Psoriasis.<br>
A major portion of research on melatonin has been devoted to studying is effects on reproduction, particularly in seasonally breeding species (such as hamsters and sheep), in which melatonin is known to regulate fertility and puberty, hibernation, and coat color. These effects have obvious significance for animal husbandry use. Reproductive endocrine uses in humans for melatonin include: contraceptive and fertilit/ agents, treatment for precocious puberty, treatment for premenstrual syndrome and hyperprolactinemia (Pevre et al., J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 47:1383-1386, 1978; Purry et al., Am. J. Psychiatry 144:762-766, 1987: Waldhauser et al., Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 73:793-796, 1991; Bispink et al., Pineal Res. 8:97-106, 1990; Cagnacci et al., J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 73:210-220, 1991;<br><br>
Voordouw et al., J, Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 74:107-108, 1992; see U.S. Patents Nos. 4,855,305 and 4,945,103 of Cohen et al., and 5,272,141 of Fraschini et al.). It is likely that melatonin compounds may also be useful in other endocrine conditions, particularly those involving growth hormone (Cramer et al., Arzeneim-Forsch, 26:1076.1078,1976; Wright et al., Clin. Endocrinol. 24:375-382, 1986; Paccotti et al., Chronobiologica 15:279-288, 1988; Valcavi et al., Clin. Endocrinol. 39:139-199, 1993). Melatonin may serve to reduce prostate enlargement (see above-cited US and EP patents of Zisapel) Orally administered melatonin to castrated juvenile rats inhibited the androgen-dependent growth of the ventral prostate and the seminal vesicles. (Gilad et al., J. of Urol. 159:1069-73, 1998). Recently, we have demonstrated high affinity melatonin receptors in the human benign prostate epithelial cells, which may affect cell growth and viability (Endocrinology, 137:1412-17, 1996).<br>
In addition to the pineal gland, the eye also synthesizes melatonin. Recently melatonin has been implicated in the control of intraocular pressure and may be of use in glaucoma (Samples et al., Curr, Eye, Res. 7:649-653, 1988; Rhode et al., Ophthalmic. Res. 25:10-15, 1993).<br>
The kidney also expresses melatonin receptors and melatonin has been shown to affect vasopressin and urine excretion (Song et al., FASEB J 11:93-100, 1997, Yasin et al., Brain Res. Bull 39:1-5, 1997).<br>
It is clear that there exists a broad range of therapeutic uses for melatonin. Accordingly it is of continuing interest to identify novel compounds that interact with melatoninergic system as potential therapeutic agents. These compounds may offer longer duration, selective localization and greater efficacy to those of melatonin.<br>
Novel compounds related to melatonin, but with pharmacological or pharmacokinetic profiles different from melatonin, are likely to be important new pharmaceuticals. For examples, see U.S. Patent No. 5,403,851 which discloses the use of substituted tryptamines, phenylalkylamines and related compounds, in order to treat number of pharmaceutical indications including sleep disorders, endocrine indications, immune-system disorders etc. PCT Patent Application No. WO 87/00432 describes compositions, for treating or preventing psoriasis, which contain melatonin or related compounds. European Patent Application No. 0330625A2 discloses the production of melatonin and analogs thereof, for various therapeutic purposes, includinq the administration of melatonin in combination with an azidothymidine for<br><br>
the treatment of AIDS. Melatonin analogs based on the bioisosteric properties naphthalenic ring and the indole ring has been disclosed in J. Med. Chem. 1992. 35:1484-1485, EP 662471 A2 950712 of Depreux et al., WO 9529173 A1 951102 of Ladlow et al., U.S. Patents Nos. 5,151,446 of Horn et al., 5,194,614 of Adrieux et al. and 5,276,051 of Lesieur et al.<br>
Inhibition by melatonin of dopamine release from specific brain areas has been demonstrated in vitro in rats (Zisapel et al., Brain Res 1982;246(1):161-3; Brain Res 1982;246(1):161-3) sheep and hamsters (Malpaux et al. Reprod Nutr Dev 1999;39(3):355-66). In addition, melatonin was able to reduce excitability of nigrostriatal neurons (Escames etai Neuroreport 1996;7(2):597-600 ) and increase the affinity of D2 dopamine receptors in the rat striatum (Hamdi Life Sci 1998;63:2115-20). It may therefore treat disorders associated with increased dopamine release or dopamine supersensitivity , e.g. for tardive - dyskinesia, or cocaine addiction.<br>
Melatonin antagonist are also of potential therapeutic use. A reduction in nigrostriatal dopaminergic activity as that caused by melatonin could lead to worsening of parkinsonian side effects and akathisia, as is indeed supported by findings in animal models of Parkinson disease (Willis and Armstrong Brain Res Brain Res Rev 1998;27(3): 177-242). Melatonin antagonists may thus be helpful to prevent the effects of endogenous melatonin in Parkinson's disease. Melatonin antagonists may also be helpful in preventing fatigue and sleepiness of shift workers caused by the increase in endogenous melatonin at night; in blind persons that are not synchronized with the environmental light dark cycle, in delayed sleep phase syndrome patients who secrete melatonin during daytime and in jet lag.<br>
There is evidence suggesting both melatonin agonists and antagonists_,would be of potential therapeutic use for a variety of maladies and conditions. The present invention addresses the need for more therapeutically selective compounds than melatonin.<br>
The compounds N-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-5-methoxytryptamine ("ML-23") and N-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-2-iodo-5-methoxytryptamine, are known to have antagonistic effects on melatonin (Zisapel et al 1989, US Patent No. 4,880,826 , Laudon et al, J Endocrinol, 1988;116:43-53, Oaknin-Bendahan et al, Neuroreport 1995 27;6:785-8, Nordio et al Proc Soc Exp Biol Med 1989 ;191:321-5, Zisapel et al, Eur J Pharmacol 1987:136, 259-60). To the best of the present inventors' knowledge, it has never<br><br>
been previously suggested that other N-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-5-methoxytryptamines, or their ether or thioether analogs, might have potential use for interacting with the melatoninergic system.<br>

BIOLOGICAL TESTING OF COMPOUNDS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Experiment 1 Table 1: Effects of ML compounds of the invention on glutamate-induced oxidative toxicity in hippocampal cell line (HT22)<br>
The changes in the mithochondrial membrane potential was assessed using<br>
the	fluorescent	probe	5,5\6,6'-tetrachloro-1,r,3,3'-<br>
tetraethylbenzimidazoicarbocyanine iodide (JC-1) according to Nuydens et al, 1999, L of Neuroscience;92, 153-9. Immortalized mouse hipocampal cells (HT-22) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and passaged by trypsinization. Cells (3000 per 96 palte well) were cultured for 24h with DMEM containing 5mM glutamate and were treated with 10-7 M of the ML compounds. Cells were then loaded with JC-1 by changing the culture medium to Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing Ig/L glucose and lOuM JC-1 for 10 min. at 37° and were washed once. Flouresence was then measured in a plate reader at excitation/emission wavelengths of 480/530nm and 530/590nm. The ratio of the fluoresence intensities in the two wavelengths 530/590:480/530 is an indication of the mitochondrial membrane potential. Decrease in this ratio indicates depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane due to damage induced by anoxic or other phathological situations leading to apoptosis of cells. The results (table 1) demonstrate the decreased fluorescence ratio by glutamate indicating damage to mitochondrial membrane potential in the hippocampal cells. Melatonin, ML-23 and four compounds of the invention (ML-25, ML-27, ML-26, ML-30) significantly protected against glutamate-mediated damage to the mitochondria so that the fluorescence ratio remained high compared to ceils treated with glutamate. Among these, three (ML-23, ML-25, ML-26) did not decrease membrane potential of the control cells whereas others (ML-27 and ML-30) decreased it. Other compounds in the group presented in Table 1   (ML-29, ML-32, ML--31) decreased<br><br>
mitochondrial membrane potential in control cells without providing protection against glutamate and one (ML-28) elevated the potential in control cells but did not protect against glutamate induced damage.<br>
This experiment indicates a direct inhibitory action of compounds of the invention on mitochondrial membrane potential, which resemble the effect of melatonin.<br><br>
Experiment 2 ^2^/-me/afon/n binding in membranes of hamster brain<br>
2 whole hamster brains were homogenized with Teflon-glass homogenizer in 10voi/g tissue of ice cold Tris-HCI buffer (50mmol/L Tris, 5mmol/L CaCI2, pH=7.4) and spun at 10,000gfor 10 min. the supernatant were spun at 100,000gfortwo hours to yield a crude synaptosomal pellet (P2).<br>
Aliquots of suspended P2 (20ul) were incubated at 37^0 with '125|.rnelatonin (250 pM) for 60 min. in Tris-Hcl buffer in the absence or presence of 1nM-100p,M test-substances (ML compounds and melatonin). The binding reaction was terminated by the addition of 4ml ice cold Tris buffer. Membranes were then collected by vacuum filtration using GF/C glass fiber filters and washed with 3x4ml ice-cold buffer. The<br>
filters containing the bound  1251-melatonin were assayed for the amount of<br><br>
radioactivity in a y counter. The results (table 2) demonstrate the competition of ML<br>
compounds on specific '125l-melatonin binding to membrane fraction of rat brain. ML-<br>
29, ML-30 and ML-31 (10-7M) inhibited (&gt;20%) the specific 135l-melatonin binding.<br>
ML-27, ML-28 and ML-23 reduced the specific 125|-melatonin binding to a lesser<br>
extent (--13%). Melatonin (10-8M) also decreased the specific '125|-melatonin binding to a similar extent (20%). Table 2:<br><br>
