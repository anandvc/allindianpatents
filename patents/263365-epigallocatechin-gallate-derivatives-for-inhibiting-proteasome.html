Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to derivates of (-)-epigallocatechin gallate, particularly for use as proteasome inhibitors and/or for inhibition of cancer cell growth.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The polyphenols found in green tea extracts are (-)-epicatechin (EC), (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC), (-)-epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG) and (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG). In particular, (-)-EGCG, the most abundant catechin,' was found to be chemopreventive and anticancer agent among the green tea catechins (GTCs) (4. Fujiki, H. J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 1999,125, 589-97).<br>
Proteasome is a large protein complex with multicatalytic activities that are responsible for the degradation of not only obsolete and misfolded proteins, but also regulatory proteins involved in cell cycle and apoptosis. In proteasome-dependent proteolysis, ubiquitin is first conjugated to the substrate, followed by degradation of the substrate and recycling of the amino acids and ubiquitin. The ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent degradation pathway plays an essential role in up-regulation of cell proliferation, down-regulation of cell death, and development of drug resistance in human tumor cells. Therefore, proteasome inhibitors show great potential as novel anticancer drugs (Dou, Q. P.; Li, B. Drug Resist Update 1999, 2, 215-23). It has been shown that natural (-)-EGCG and synthetically derived (+)-EGCG are potent inhibitors of the proteasomal chymotrypsin activity, leading to growth arrest and/or apoptosis (Smith, D. M.; Wang, Z.; Kazi, A.; Li, L.; Chan, T. H.; Dou, Q. P. Mol Med 2002, 5: 382-92.). US patent publication no. 20040110790 (Zaveri et al.) describes synthetic analogs of green tea polyphenols as chemotherapeutic and chemopreventive agents, but the synthesis provided only racemic compounds, and do not use natural occurring catechins derived from green tea.<br>
The P13K/Akt signaling is a widely known tumor cell survival pathway (Vanhaesebroeck, B.; Alessi, D. R. Biochem J 2000, 346, 561-76). Blocking this pathway is considered as an important mechanism for inhibiting tumor growth. Phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) is the activated form of Akt. Once Akt is activated, it can mediate cell cycle progression<br><br>
by phosphorylation and consequent inhibition of the cyclindependent kinase inhibitor p27.24 Recently, (-)-EGCG has been found to inhibit the Akt kinase activity via reducing the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signals in MMTV-Her-2/neu mouse mammary tumor NF639 cells, leading to reduced tumor cell growth (Pianetti, S.; Guo, S.; Kavanagh, K. T.; Sonenshein, G. E. Cancer Res 2002, 62, 652-5).<br>
However, (-)-EGCG has at least one limitation: it gives poor bioavailability. A study by Nakagawa et al. showed that only 0.012% of (-)-EGCG could be absorbed in rats given 56 mg of (-)-EGCG orally (Nakagawa, K.; Miyazawa, T. Anal Biochem. 1997, 248, 41-9). This low absorption was thought to be due to the poor stability of (-)-EGCG in neutral or alkaline solutions. As pH value of the intestine and body fluid is neutral or slightly alkaline, GTCs will be unstable inside the human body, thus leading to reduced bioavailability.<br>
Objects of the Invention<br>
Therefore, it is an object of this invention to provide a (-)-EGCG derivative that is able to resolve at least one or more of the problems as set forth in the prior art. As a minimum, it is an object of this invention to provide the public with a useful choice.<br>

The alkyl group R can be partially or fully halogenated". The term "partially or fully halogenated" is meant to express that in the groups characterized in this manner the hydrogen atoms may be partially or fully replaced by identical or different halogen atoms, for example chloromethyl, dichloromethyl, trichloromethyl, fluoromethyl, difluoromethyl, trifluoromethyl, chlorofluoromethyl, dichlorofiuoromethyl, chlorodifluoromethyl, 1-fluoroethyl, 2-fluoroethyl,<br><br>
2,2-difluoroethyl, 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl, 2-chloro-2-fluoroethyl, 2-chloro-2,2-difluoroethyl, 2,2-dichloro-2-fluoroethyl, 2,2,2-trichloroethyl and pentafluoroethyl;<br>

According to this invention, peracetate (-)-EGCG, 1 was synthesized (Figure 1). 1 was found to be more stable than (-)-EGCG. The prodrug was biologically inactive against a purified 20S proteasome, but potently inhibited the proteasome in intact tumor cells. Furthermore, administration of the prodrug, but not its parent compound, to intact tumor cells resulted in the loss of phosphorlyated Akt (p-Akt), indicating inactivation of this cancer-associated kinase. Finally, treatment of leukemia Jurkat T cells with 1 induced cell death.<br>
In order to evaluate whether other peractete protected tea polyphenols possessed greater bioactivity than their unprotected parent, several synthetic analogs to (-)-EGCG that possess deletions of the hydroxyl groups on the gallate ring were synthesized. Additionally, to enhance the stability of the molecules, the hydroxyl groups were converted to acetate or benzoate groups to create a prodrug. Surprisingly, the protected analogs were found to be more potent proteasome inhibitors in intact tumor cells than their unprotected counterparts.<br>

Novel dipeptidyl proteasome inhibitors overcome Bcl-2 protective function and selectively accumulate the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 and induce apoptosis in transformed, but not normal, human fibroblasts. Cell Death Differ 1998; 5: 1062-75.). Analysis of Bax, IKBa, p27, PAW, and ubiquitinated protein expression were performed using monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies according to previously reported protocols (An B et. al.).<br>
Inhibition of purified 20s proteasome activity by (-)-EGCG or synthetic tea polyphenols<br>
Measurement of the chyrnotrypsin-like activity of the 20s proteasome was performed by incubating 0.5 μg of purified rabbit 20s proteasome with 40 μM fluorogenic peptide substrate, Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC, with or without various concentrations of natural and synthetic tea polyphenols as described previously (Nam S et. al).<br>
Inhibition of proteasome activity in intact cells by natural/synthetic tea polyphenols VA-13 or WI-38 cells were grown in 24 well plates (2 ml/well) to 70-80% confluency, followed by 24 h treatment with 25 pM (-)-EGCG, 2, or 2a. 40 pM Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC substrate was then added for 2.5 h at 37°C and the chyrnotrypsin-like activity was measured as described above. Alternatively, cells were treated with each compound at 25 μM for 4 or 24 h, and harvested and lysed. Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC (40 fiM) was then incubated with the prepared cell lysates for 2.5 h and the chyrnotrypsin-like activity was measured as described above.<br>
Immunostaining ofapoptotic cells with anti-cleaved PARP conjugated to F'lTC<br>
Immunostaining of apoptotic cells was performed by addition of a FITC-conjugated polyclonal antibody that recognizes cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and visualized on an Axiovert 2 5 (Zeiss; Thornwood, NY) microscope. Cells were grown to<br><br>
about 80% confluency in 60 mm dishes. VA-13 cells were then treated with VP-16, 2, or 2a (25 ΜM) for 24 h. Following treatment, both suspension and adhering cells were collected and washed twice in PBS pH 7.4. The cells were washed between all steps listed below and all washes are 1 min duration with PBS. Cells were then fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol, permeabilized in 0.1% Triton-X- 100 and blocked for 30 min in 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) at room temperature. Incubation with the primary FITC-conjugated-p85/PARP antibody was for 30 min at 4°C in the dark with mild shaking. Cell suspension was then transferred to glass slides in the presence of Vector Shield mounting medium with DAPI. Images were captured using AxioVision 4.1 and adjusted using Adobe Photoshop 6.0 software. Cell death was quantified by counting the number of apoptotic cells over the total number of cells in the same field. Data are mean of duplicate experiments ±SD.<br>
Trypan Blue assay<br>
Trypan blue assay was used to ascertain cell death in Jurkat T cells treated with natural and synthetic polyphenols as indicated. Apoptotic morphology was assessed using phase-contrast microscopy as described previously (Kazi A, Hill R, Long TE, Kuhn DJ, Twos E, Dou QP. Novel N-thiolated beta-lactam antibiotics selectively induce apoptosis in human tumor and transformed, but not normal or nontransformed, cells.

MTT Assay<br>
MTT was used to determine effects of polyphenols on overall proliferation of tumor cells. Human breast MCF-7 cells were plated in a 96 well plate and grown to 70-80% confluency, followed by addition of analogs for 24 h. MTT (1 mg/ml) in PBS was then added to wells and incubated at 37 °C for 4 hours to allow for complete cleavage of the tetrazolium salt by metabolically active cells. Next, the MTT was removed and 100 ul of DMSO was added and colorimetric analysis performed using a multilabel plate reader at 560 nm (Victor3; Perkin Elmer). Absorbance values plotted are the mean from triplicate experiments.<br>
Soft agar assay<br><br>
LNCaP cells (2 x 104) were plated in soft agar on 6 well plates in the presence of (-)-EGCG or protected tea analogs (25 pM) or in DMSO (control) to determine cellular transformation activity as described previously (Kazi A et al).<br>
Nuclear staining<br>
After each drug treatment, both detached and attached VA-13 and WI-38 cells were stained Hoechst 33342 to assess for apoptosis. Briefly, cells were washed 2X in PBS, fixed for 1 h with 70% ethanol at 4°C, washed 3X in PBS, and stained with 50 pM Hoechst for 30 min in the dark at room temperature. Detached cells were plated on a slide and attached cells were visualized on the plate with a fluorescent microscope at 10X or 40X resolution (Zeiss, Germany). Digital Scientific obtained images with AxioVision 4.1 and adjusted using Adobe Photoshop 6.0.<br>
Induction ofcaspase-3 activity by synthetic tea polyphenols<br>
Cells were treated with each compound at 25 /xM for 4 or 24 h, and then harvested and lysed. Ac-DEVD-AMC (40 /nM) was added to the cell lysates for 2.5 h and the caspase-3 activity.<br>
RESULTS<br>
Chemical stability and enzymatic hydrolysis ofperacetate (-)-EGCG, 1<br>
The stability of 1 with (-)-EGCG in a culture medium (RMPI) is compared, which mimics the body fluid with a pH value around 8. (-)-EGCG or 1 at 0.1 mM was incubated in 1 mL RMPI at 37°C at indicated times. At different time points, the medium was analyzed by HPLC for the amount of tested compound remaining. Degradation curves are shown in Figure 2.<br>
When (-)-EGCG was dissolved in the culture medium, it was found to degrade rapidly within 20 minutes, demonstrating the low stability of (-)-EGCG in the medium. Although 1 also degraded in the medium, as seen in Figure 2, the rate of its degradation was much slower when compared with (-)-EGCG. 1 disappeared completely after 2 hours, indicating that it is 6 times more stable than (-)-EGCG in this medium. Therefore, peracetate protection of the phenol groups of (-)-EGCG assists in stabilizing 1 in culture (presumably physiological) conditions.<br><br>
In order to determine if 1 was hydrolysed to EGCG under the culture medium conditions, the experiment was repeated but now with added vitamin C (at 1.67 mg/mL) to prevent the rapid degradation of the generated EGCG. As 1 disappeared, a new peak A was observed by HPLC to increase and then decline in intensity with time. This was followed by the appearance of another peak B in the HPLC which also eventually declined. Finally, a peak in the HPLC identical in retention time to EGCG was observed to be formed. The time course results of these components were shown in Figure 3. The identity of EGCG was confirmed by UV spectroscopy as well as mass spectrometry. Furthermore, mass spectrometric analyses of peaks A and B showed that they were the di-acetate and mono-acetate of EGCG respectively. These results suggested that compound 1 was first hydrolysed to the diacetate, then mono-acetate and eventually EGCG under the culture medium conditions.<br>
The generation of (-)-EGCG from compound 1 under cellular conditions could be more clearly demonstrated by the addition of vitamin C to prevent the rapid disappearance of (-)-EGCG. In this case, we performed the experiment in medium with breast cancer cell lysate. HPLC analyses showed the disappearance of 1, together with the transient formation of A (the di-acetate), B (the mono-acetate) and then (-)-EGCG in a time-course results (Figure 4) similar to Figure 3. Therefore, it is believed that that in medium with the addition of lysate, compound 1 underwent hydrolysis forming the di-acetate of EGCG, then the mono-acetate, then EGCG, and eventually gallic acid. (Scheme 1)<br><br>
Inhibition oftheproteasomal activity in vitro and in vivo by 1 and (-)-EGCG<br>
If 1 is to function as the prodrug of (-)-EGCG, it should remain biologically inactive until de-acetylation inside the cell where it is converted into its parent compound. In order to test this hypothesis, proteasome activity was tested both in vitro and in intact Jurkat T cells with either 1 or (-)-EGCG (as a positive control). First, 1 and commercial (-)-EGCG were<br><br>
dissolved in DMSO and their effects on the chymotrypsin-like activity of purified 20S proteasomes were measured. At 10 uM, 1 was completely inactive in inhibiting the chymotrypsin-like activity of the purified 20S proteasome (Figure 5). In contrast, (-)-EGCG at 10 μM inhibited 80-90% of the proteasomal chymotrypsin-like activity. Therefore, as predicted, 1 outside of a cellular system is not a proteasome inhibitor.<br>
If 1 converts to (-)-EGCG inside the cells, proteasome inhibition in vivo should be detected. To examine this possibility, human Jurkat cells was treated with 25 uM of 1 or (-)-EGCG for 12 or 24 h, followed by measurement of proteasome activity by using a chymotrypsin-like specific fluorogenic substrate in intact cells (Figure 6a) or Western blot for ubiquinated proteins (Figure 6b). Treatment of Jurkat T cells with (-)-EGCG for 24 h inhibited proteasome activity by 31% versus 42% inhibition with 1 (Figure 6a). To analyze the intracellular level of polyubiquitinated proteins, cells were lysed after 12 hours incubation and subjected to Western blotting. 1 showed comparable levels of ubiquitinated proteins to that of natural (-)-EGCG (Figure 6b). Therefore, 1 is equally potent to, if not more potent than, (-)-EGCG in inhibiting the proteasomal activity in intact cells. On the other hand, even though 1 is six times more stable compared with EGCG, the potency of its biological activities in cells did not increase to a similar extent. It is possible that the amount of EGCG generated from 1, and thus its biological activity inside the cells depends on a combination of factors: the relative permeability of 1 into the cells, the amount of esterase enzymes and the amount of anti-oxidants that may be present in the cells at any time.<br>
Dephosphorylation ofAkt in Jurkat cells by 1 and (-J-EGCG<br>
(-)-EGCG and 1 were incubated with Jurkat T cells for 24 h at 5, 10 and 25 uM, followed by Western blot analysis using a specific antibody to phosphorylated Akt (Figure 7). (-)-EGCG at 25 uM was found to reduce the level of p-Akt by 32% compared to treatment with 1, which lead to a 73% decrease in activated Akt at 25 uM as indicated by densitometric analysis (Figure 7). Actin was used as a loading control.<br>
Cell death induced by 1 and (-J-EGCG<br>
The abilities of (-)-EGCG and 1 to induce cell death in Jurkat T cells treated with 10 uM for 24 h are also accessed. While (-)-EGCG had a minimal effect on cell death (5%), 1 was capable of inducing up to 15% cell death at that concentration (Figure 8). Therefore, the<br><br>
greater abilities of 1 to inhibit cellular proteasome activity (Figure 6) and to inactivate Akt (Figure 7) are associated with its increased cell death-inducing activity (Figure 8).<br>
Acetylated Synthetic Tea Polyphenols Do Not Inhibit the Purified 20s Proteasome Activity<br>
Up to 25 μM of all protected and unprotected compounds were incubated with a purified 20s proteasome and a fluorogenic substrate for chyrnotrypsin activity for 30 rnin. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration or IC50 was then determined. (-)-EGCG showed to be the most potent with an IC50 of 0.2 μM, followed by 2 (IC50 about 9.9 |xM). IC50 values of compounds 3 and 4 were found to be 14-15 μM. In contrast, the protected analogs were much less active: 
Protected tea analogs exhibit greater proteasome-inhibitory potency in intact tumor cells<br>
To determine what effects the synthetic tea analogs had on the proteasome in vivo, Jurkat cells were treated with 25 μM of each synthetic compound for either 4 or 24 h, with (-)-EGCG as a control (Figures 9A and 9B). After 4 h of treatment, Western blot analysis, shows that the acetate-protected analogs induced a greater amount of ubiquitinated proteins (Figure 9A, Lanes 5, 7, and 9), indicating that proteasome activity is abrogated. 1 was used as a control based on the above previous data showing that peracetate-protected (-)-EGCG is more potent than natural (-)-EGCG (Figure 9A, Lanes 3 vs. 2). Additionally, Western blots for Bax and IKBCC, known as two proteasome targets, revealed the disappearance of these proteins and the appearance of a higher molecular weight band, which is speculated to be multi-ubiquinated forms of the proteins (Figure 9A, lanes 3, 5, 7, and 9). However, after 24 h treatment, (-)-EGCG and its unprotected analogs exhibited a greater amount of ubiquitinated proteins (Figure 9B. Lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8). This is consistent with the idea that protected analogs are potent inhibitors 0 f the proteasome at an earlier time point and that after 24 h of treatment the ubiquitinated proteins are being depleted by deubiquitinating enzymes. Accumulation of p27, another proteasome target, is also found in Jurkat cells treated with the protected analogs 2a, 3a and 4a (Figure 9B, Lanes 9, 5, 7). The putative ubiquitinated IKBCC band is still found in cells treated with 2a, 3a, and 4a (Figure 9B, Lanes 9, 5, 7). The presumed ubiquinated IKBCC band is now absent in the 24 h treatment, possibly due to deubiquitination (Figure 9B). Actin was used as a loading control in this experiment.<br>
Protected analogs induce greater cell death in leukemic cells<br><br>
In a kinetics experiment using a pair of analogs, 4 and 4a, it was found that the unprotected analog 4 induced accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins with highest expression after 8 hours of polyphenol treatment (Figure 9C). Conversely, the protected 4a showed increased ubiquitinated protein accumulation as early as 2 h and lasting up to 8 h (Figure 9C). To determine if acetate-protected analogs are potent proteasome inhibitors in other cancer cell systems, prostate cancer LNCaP cells were treated for 24 h with 25 μM of (-)-EGCG, 1, 2a, or 3a, with DMSO as a control. Indeed, ubiquitin-conjugated proteins were observed, with the greatest increase found in cells treated with 2a and 3a (Figure 9D).<br>
Protected analogs are more potent apoptosis inducers<br>
It has been shown that proteasome inhibition can induce apoptosis in a wide variety of cancer cells, but not in normal, non-transformed cells (An B et al). Jurkat T cells are treated with 25 (JM of each of the selected polyphenols and their protected analogs for 24 h to investigate their abilities to induce apoptotic cell death. Trypan blue incorporation assay revealed that 2a, 3a and 4a, but not others, induced death in 99, 57, and 83% of Jurkat cells, respectively (Figure 10A). Similarly, Western blot analysis showed that only 2a, 3a, and 4a induced apoptosis-specific PARP cleavage after 24 h (Figure 10B). An immunofluorescent stain that detects only the cleavage PARP fiagment (p85; green) showed that SV40-transforrned VA-13 cells are highly sensitive to apoptosis induced by 2a with 73% apoptotic cells after 24 h treatment (Figures IOC and 10D). The unprotected 2 induced much less apoptosis (21 %), while 25 μM VP-16, used as a positive control, induced 92% apoptosis (Figures IOC and 10D). Counterstain with DAPI, which binds to the minor groove in A-T rich regions of DNA, was decreased drastically in apoptotic cells (Figure IOC), consistent with DNA fragmentation in late stage apoptosis.<br>
Inhibition of tumor cell proliferation by protected polyphenols<br>
Treated breast cancer (MCF-7) cells were then treated with 5 or 25 uM of peracetate-protected analogs for 24 h, followed by MTT analysis to determine their effects on cell proliferation. Compound 1 at 25 uM inhibited cellular proliferation by 40% (Figure 11A). The protected compounds 2a, 3a, and 4a caused 50% inhibition at 5 uM and 70% at 25 ΜM, respectively (Figure 11A).<br><br>
Human prostate cancer LNCaP cells were then treated for 24 h with each selected tea polyphenol protected analogs 1, 2a, 3a, 4a at 25 μM, followed by determining the apoptotic morphological changes. Again, the protected analogs 2a, 3a, and 4a caused dramatic round¬up, detachment, and cellular fragmentation (Figure 11B). 1 induced mild morphological changes, while (-)-EGCG treatment led to enlarged, flattened cells, indicating growth arrest.<br>
Soft agar assay is used to determine the transforming activity of tumor cells. Abrogation of colony formation is linked to GI arrest and/or apoptosis. LNCaP cells were added to soft agar in 6-well plates, and were then treated one time at initial plating with 25 μM of (-)EGCG or a protected analog (Figure 11C). After 21 days, colony formation was evaluated. Cells treated with (-)-EGCG showed a significant decrease in colony formation compared to the control cells treated with DMSO (Figures 11C and 11D). Protected polyphenols also inhibited tumor cell transforming activity, with 2a and 4a being the most potent inhibitors of colony formation (Figure 11D).<br>
Preferential induction of apoptosis in tumor cells by protected analogs<br>
The ability to induce apoptosis in tumor cells, but not normal cells is an important measure for novel anti-cancer drugs. To determine whether the protected compounds also affect normal cells, both VA-13 and WI-38 cells were treated with 25 uM of (-)-EGCG, 2, or 2a for 24 h and examined proteasome activity, nuclear morphological changes, and detachment. A differential decrease was found in the chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome in VA-13 cells over normal WI-38 cells (Figure 12A). A 42-48% decrease in proteasome activity was observed in VA-13 cells treated with (-)-EGCG and 2, while 2a inhibited 92% of the proteasomal activity. Conversely, the proteasome activity in WI-38 cells was decreased by only -5% with all three polyphenol treatments.<br>
Next, apoptotic nuclear morphology is examined after treatment with natural (-)-EGCG, 2, and 2a (Figure 12B). While (-)-EGCG and 2 exhibited little or no apoptosis, 2a markedly induced apoptosis in SV-40-transformed VA-13 cells. In contrast, normal WI-38 fibroblasts treated with all the compounds did not undergo apoptosis and very little detachment was visible. A comparison among all the protected analogs was then performed using 25μM. for 24 h. After 36 h, (-)-EGCG did initiate apoptosis in VA-13 cells (Figure 12C). All of the protected analogs induced apoptosis in transformed (VArl3), but not normal<br><br>
(WI-38) cells (Figures 12B and 12C). Similarly, when leukemic (Jurkat T) and normal, non-transformed natural killer (YT) cells were treated with (-)-EGCG and 2a for 24 h, only Jurkat cells underwent apoptosis as evidenced by PAW cleavage (Figure 12D). Inhibition of purified 20S proteasome activity by new synthetic tea polyphenol analogs.<br>
The green tea polyphenol (-)-EGCG contains a B-ring with three -OH groups (Figure 1) and has an IC50 value of 0.3 μM to a purified 20S proteasome (Table 1). Table 1. Inhibition of proteasome activity to synthetic tea<br><br>
Inhibition of purified 20S proteasome was assessed using a chymotrypsin-like specific fluorogenic substrate (Sue-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC). 20S proteasomes were incubated with polyphenols for 2 h.<br>
Results obtained from 3 independent experiments performed in triplicate.<br>
3 n.a. indicates that the inhibitory activity of the purfiied 20S proteasome at 25 μM was 
Removal of an -OH from B-ring of (-)-EGCG generates (-)-ECG that has decreased proteasome-inhibitory potency in vitro (0.58 ΜM). TO further examine the effects of B-ring -OH group deletion on proteasome-inhibitory and cell death-inducing abilities, we synthesized several novel EGCG analogs with eliminated -OH groups on the B-ring as well as their putative prodrugs, the peracetate-protected counterparts. By using a purified 20S proteasome and a chymotrypsin-like fluorogenic substrate, the proteasome-inhibitory effects of the following unprotected polyphenol analogs are determined:<br><br><br>
A good correlation between proteasome-inhibitory activity and the number of -OH groups on the B-ring and on the D-ring is observed. As individual -OH groups were eliminated from the B-ring, the IC50 values increased stepwise and the order of potency observed was: (-)-EGCG (IC50 0.30 μM) &gt; (-)-ECG (0.58 μM) &gt; 6 (2.69 μM) &gt; #m (4.56 μM) (Figure 13 and Table 1). Consistently, in the series of compounds 12,11 (an epimer of 12) and 10 which contain one -OH on the D-ring (Figure 13), 12 and 11 with two B-ring -OH groups are more potent than 10 with only one B-ring -OH group (5.99, 7.70, and 8.51 μM, respectively; Table 1).<br>
Additional SAR analysis also revealed that when more -OH groups were removed from the D-ring, the inhibitory potency was further decreased as compared to B-ring -OH eliminations alone. For example, 6 is more potent than 10 (2.69 vs. 8.51 ΜM), and (-)-ECG<br><br>
as well as (-)-CG are more potent than No 12 [0.58 and 0.75 vs. 5.99 ΜM;]. Finally, we have included compound 16 to probe the hydrophobic effect around the A ring. Indeed, compound 16 was found to be more active than the counterpart (-)-CG [0.59 vs. 0.75 μM; Figure 13; Table land 2].<br>
As a comparison, the inhibitory activities of the protected polyphenol analogs to purified proteasome are also determined. As expected, the peracetate-protected analogs (indicated by *) were not potent inhibitors of the chymotrypsin-like activity of the purified 20S proteasome, compared to their unprotected analogs, perhaps due to the lack of cellular esterases required for conversion. All the protected analogs at 25 uM inhibited 
Inhibition of cellular proteasome activity by synthetic tea polyphenols<br>
To determine whether the unprotected and protected polyphenol analogs could inhibit the proteasomal activity in intact cells, leukemia Jurkat T cells were treated with each compound at 25μM for 4 and 24 h, followed by collection of cell pellets and measurement of the proteasomal chymotrypsin-like activity in the prepared lysates. The unprotected compounds show limited proteasome inhibition in intact Jurkat T cells although 10 and 15 showed moderate potency (Figure 14). These data suggest that most, if not all, of the unprotected compounds are only moderately active in the cellular environment, similar to (-)-EGCG, presumably because of their cellular instability.<br>
Importantly, all of the peracyloxyl-protected, particularly, peracetate-protected polyphenols tested were much more potent inhibitors of the proteasomal chymotrypsin-like activity than their unprotected counterparts after 24 h treatment (Figure 14). Especially, 19* inhibited 97% of the chymotrypsin-like activity while its unprotected polyphenol counterpart, 6, inhibited only 30% of the chymotrypsin-like activity after a 24 h treatment.<br>
The pro-apoptotic protein Bax and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 are natural proteasome targets. If the peracetate-protected polyphenols inhibit the intact proteasome activity, we would expect accumulation of Bax and p27 in these cells. To test this idea, Jurkat T cells were treated with both protected and unprotected compounds and lysates were analyzed by Western blot using specific antibodies to Bax and p27 (Figure 15).<br><br>
After 4 h of treatment, the peracetate-protected analogs 24* and 19*, but not their unprotected analogs, were able to increase accumulation of both Bax (by 3- and 2.5-fold, respectively) and p27 (6- and 11-fold, respectively) (Figure 15A). After 24 h treatment, Bax levels were increased in cells treated with all of the peracetate-protected compounds (13-, 12-, 40- and 36-fold, respectively, by 24*, 19*, 21* and 23*). However, p27 increase was observed with treatment of mainly 21* (2-fold) and 23* (2-fold) after 24 h (Figure 15B). In addition, levels of ubiquitinated proteins, an indicator of proteasome inhibition, were significantly increased by the protected 22*, but not its corresponding, unprotected 11, after 4 h treatment (Figure 15C). These data are consistent with the profile of the proteasome-inhibitory activities of these compounds (Figure 14). It is suggested the protected analogs can be converted into active proteasome inhibitors in cultured tumor cells.<br>
Induction ofapoptotic cell death by synthetic tea polyphenol analogs.<br>
It has previously been shown that proteasome inhibition is associated with apoptosis induction. To determine if the B-ring/D-ring protected analogs were capable of inducing cell death, Jurkat T cells were first treated with all the protected and unprotected analogs at 25 μM for 24 h, followed by trypan blue exclusion assay (Figure 16). Changes in cell morphology (shrunken cells and characteristic apoptotic blebbing) were observed after 4 h treatment with both protected and unprotected analogs and these changes were greatly increased after 24 h treatment with protected analogs (data not shown). Furthermore, the peracetate-protected analogs induced a 5- to 10-fold increase in cell death after 4 h incubation and up to 20-fold increase at 24 h (Figure 16). In contrast, the unprotected polyphenols caused much less cell death, only 3- to 5-fold increase after even 24 h treatment (Figure 16).<br>
To determine if the cell death observed (Figure 16) was due to the induction of apoptosis, a similar experiment was performed in Jurkat T cells, followed by measurement of caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage. The peracetate-protected polyphenols induced the highest levels of caspase-3 activity (Figure 17A): 24* treatment for 4 h resulted in an ~16-fold increase while the unprotected 16 resulted in only a 4-fold increase. Furthermore, the protected 19* treatment increased the caspase-3 activity by 16-fold, while the unprotected counterpart, 6, had much less effect (4-fold). Consistently, PARP cleavage was detected in cells treated with 24* and 19*, but not with the unprotected counterparts 16 and 6 (Figure 17B). Furthermore, the protected compound 22*, but not its unprotected counterpart 11, was able to induce PARP cleavage in cells after 4 h treatment (Figure 17C).<br><br>
Preferential induction ofapoptosis in tumor cells by peracetate-protected (-)-EGCG analogs. Apoptosis induction in tumor cells but not in normal cells is an important aspect of anti-cancer drugs. To determine whether the peracetate-protected analogs affect normal cells, we treated both leukemic Jurkat T cells and non-transformed immortalized natural killer (YT) cells with the seemingly most potent peracetate-protected analog, 19*. Again, levels of proteasome target proteins Bax, p27 (data not shown), and IKB-CC (Figure 18) were increased in leukemia Jurkat T cells. However, levels of these proteins were not increased in the non-transformed immortalized YT cells. In addition, levels of ubiquitinated proteins were accumulated in a dose-dependent manner in Jurkat T cells. In contrast, only a slight, transient increase in levels of ubiqitinated proteins was detected in the YT cells. Consistent with the selective inhibition of the proteasome activity, the apoptosis-specific PARP cleavage was found only in the Jurkat T, but not YT cells. Thus, potent peracetate-protected polyphenols apparently do not induce proteasome inhibition and subsequent apoptosis in non-transformed YT cells.<br>
DISCUSSION<br>
Natural (-)-EGCG from green tea has been converted to its peracetate compound 1. In addition, several synthetic analogs to (-)-EGCG that possess deletions of the hydroxyl groups on the gallate ring are synthesized. Additionally, the hydroxyl groups were converted to acetate groups to create a prodrug, which could be cleaved via esterases inside the cell and converted to the parent drug. Surprisingly, the protected analogs were much more potent proteasome inhibitors in intact tumor cells than their unprotected counterparts. Consistently, the protected analogs were also more potent apoptosis inducers than unprotected partners, when tested in leukemic (Jurkat), solid tumor and transformed cell lines. SAR analysis of the protected analogs revealed that the order of their potency is as follows: 2a = 4a &gt; 3a &gt; 1 &gt; (-)-EGCG.<br>
Protected analogs of (-)-EGCG were designed and synthesized. Unexpectedly, these compounds appear to have proteasome inhibitory activity in vivo.<br>
The peracyloxyl, particularly peracetate-protected analogs are also found to be more potent proteasome inhibitors than their unprotected, hydroxylated counterparts. It was suggested that the N-terminal Thr of the chymotrypsin-like subunit (β5) of the proteasome<br><br>
executes a nucleophilic attack on the ester-bonded carbon of (-)-EGCG, which initiates irreversible acylation to the /35-subunit and inhibits its protease activity (Nam S, Smith DM and Dou QP: J Biol Chem 276: 13322-13330, 2001.). However, addition of the peracetate moieties reduces the electrophilic character of the ester-bond carbon, leading to much reduced inhibition to the purified 20S proteasome. Unsurprisingly, the protected polyphenols examined here also exhibited limited inhibition to the chymotrypsin-like activity of purified 20S proteasome (Table 1).<br>
A correlation is shown between the activity of proteasome inhibition and the number of-OH groups on the B-ring (Table 2). The IC50 values of unprotected analogs increased stepwise as individual -OH groups were eliminated (Table 1). Although, 16 contains an additional benzene ring off the C8 carbon on the A ring of (-)-CG, it has slightly increased proteasome-inhibitory potency to (-)-CG (0.59 vs. 0.75 μM).<br>
Another important SAR found is that further elimination of-OH groups from the D-ring leads to further decreased proteasome-inhibitory potency in vitro (Table 1).<br>
As shown in Figure 14, the peracetate-protected polyphenols were much more potent inhibitors of the proteasomal chymotrypsin-like activity than the unprotected polyphenols. Peracetate-protected analogs appear to be stable for extended time points evidenced by the decrease in cellular proteasomal chymotrypsin-like activity at 24 h. In contrast, the unprotected analogs appear to lose stability after 24 h treatment. Cellular proteasomal chymotrypsin-like activity was inhibited 97% by analog 19* after 24 h while its unprotected counterpart, 6, inhibited only 30% of the activity. Compared to other pairs of protected vs. unprotected compounds, 22* displayed relatively small increase in chymotrypsin-inhibitory potency from its counterpart 11, indicating possible conversion of 22* to the parent drug in cells. Although the mechanism is not fully understood, other peracetate-protected green tea analogs seem to be converted to distinct potent compounds in a cellular environment.<br>
Several proteasome target proteins were also evaluated after proteasome inhibition with synthetic tea polyphenols (Figure 15). The data provided another piece of evidence that peracetate-protected analogs require the milieu of the cell and/or cell extract to be converted into effective proteasome inhibitors, represented by the accumulation of Bax, p27, and ubiquitinatied proteins. The protected analogs were able to accumulate target proteins with<br><br>
greater efficacy than their unprotected counterparts in a cellular model compared to the in vitro model. In contrast, the unprotected analogs did not appear to accumulate target proteins to the extent of the protected analogs, which may be a result of proton donation from the -OH groups and subsequent degradation. The data further indicates that the peracetate-protected analogs undergo conversion to a new compound and act as prodrugs in vivo.<br>
Trypan blue analysis confirmed the occurrence of cell death and the characteristic apoptotic morphological changes induced after treatment with mainly protected analogs (Figure 16). The protected analogs again appeared more stable at 24 h (cell death greater than 50% in all) than the unprotected analogs. Caspase-3 activity confirms that apoptosis occurred after 4 h incubation with the protected compounds; caspase-3 activity was increased up to 16-fold compared to the control (Figure 17). Western blot analysis for PARP cleavage further showed appearance after 4 h treatment with the protected analogs such as 19*, 24*, and 22*. Most importantly, the peracetate-protected (-)-EGCG analog, 19*, preferentially induced apoptosis in Jurkat T cells while the non-transformed YT cells remained less unaffected (Fig. 18), suggesting a potential for the protected analogs to be developed into novel anti-cancer agents.<br>
In summary, epidemiological studies have suggested the anti-cancer benefits of green tea consumption. The proteasome has been indicated in the pathological state of cancer (Ciechanover A: Embo J 17: 7151-7160, 1998.), and green tea polyphenols as inhibitors of the proteasome may be a viable treatment for some cancers. Our current study further suggest that synthetic green tea polyphenols containing peracetate-protected -OH groups are potent proteasome inhibitors and that further examination of these compounds may elucidate additional benefits from this form of therapeutics.<br>
This invention provides a variety of derivatives of (-)-EGCG that is at least as potent as (-)-EGCG. The carboxylate protected forms of (-)-EGCG and its derivatives are found to be more stable than the unprotected forms, which can be used as proteasome inhibitors to reduce tumor cell growth. Further, from the structures of 1, 2, 3, 4,19*, 21*, 22* and 23*it can be seen that some of the hydroxyl groups of the gallate ring of (-)-EGCG may not be important to the potency.<br><br>
