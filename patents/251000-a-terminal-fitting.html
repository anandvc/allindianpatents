				<td>The present invention relates to a terminal fitting.<br>
Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2003-092161 discloses a terminal fitting having a rectangular tube portion formed such that a pair of side plates stand up substantially at right angles from the opposite left and right edges of a bottom plate, an upper plate extends from the upper edge of one side plate substantially in parallel with the bottom plate, and the extending end of the upper plate is in contact with the upper end surface of the other side plate.<br>
In the terminal fitting of this or a similar kind, a pressing portion extending from the upper edge of the other side plate substantially in parallel with the bottom plate is placed on the upper surface of the upper plate in order to prevent an upward movement of the upper plate. Such a construction has a problem of making the rectangular tube portion bulky because the upper plate and the pressing portion are placed one over the other.<br>
The present invention was developed in view of the above problem and an object thereof is to reduce the height of a tube portion.<br>
This object is solved according to the invention by the features of claim 1. Preferred embodiments of the invention are subject of the dependent claims. According to the invention, there is provided a terminal fitting comprising a tube portion into which a mating terminal is at least partly insertable, the tube portion including:<br>
a first plate or first plate portion,<br>
second and third plates or plate portions projecting from or at the opposite lateral edge portions of the first plate, and<br>
a fourth plate or plate portions extending or projecting from the distal portion of the second side plate having an extending end placed in (direct or indirect) contact with the distal end portion (particularly the distal end face) of the third side plate,<br>
wherein:<br>
the fourth plate is formed with at least one embossed portion projecting substantially inwardly to substantially have a stepwise or recessed configuration, and<br>
at least one pressing portion extending from the distal edge portion of the third side plate is placed at least partly in contact with the outer surface of the embossed portion to prevent an outward movement of the fourth plate.<br>
Since the embossed portion of the fourth plate to have the pressing portion at least partly placed thereon projects inward to have a stepwise or recessed configuration, i.e. the outer surface thereof is recessed, the height of the tube portion can be reduced substantially by a recessed dimension.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the at least one pressing portion extends from the distal edge portion of the third side plate substantially in parallel with the first plate.<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment of the invention, there is provided a terminal fitting, comprising a rectangular tube portion into which a mating terminal is inserted, the rectangular tube portion including:<br>
a bottom plate,<br>
a pair of side plates standing up substantially at right angles from the opposite left and right edges of the bottom plate, and<br>
an upper plate extending from the upper edge of one side plate substantially in parallel with the bottom plate and having an extending end placed in contact with the upper end surface of the other side plate,<br>
wherein:<br>
the upper plate is formed with an embossed portion projecting downward to have a stepwise configuration, and<br>
a pressing portion extending from the upper edge of the other side plate substantially in parallel with the bottom plate is placed in contact with the upper surface of the embossed portion to prevent an upward movement of the upper plate.<br>
Since the embossed portion of the upper plate to have the pressing portion placed thereon projects downward to have a stepwise configuration, i.e. the upper surface thereof is recessed, the height of the rectangular tube portion can be reduced by a recessed dimension.<br>
Preferably, at least one of the embossed portion and the pressing portion is thinned.<br>
Since at least one of the embossed portion and the pressing portion to be placed one at least partly over the other is thinned, the height of the tube portion can be further reduced substantially by a thinned dimension.<br>
Further preferably, the inner or lower surface of the embossed portion serves as a contact surface with the mating terminal.<br>
Since the embossed portion at least partly doubles as contact means with the mating terminal, the shape of the fourth or upper plate is simpler as compared to a case where the embossed portion is formed in addition to the contact means with the mating terminal.<br>
Most preferably, the inner or lower surface of the embossed portion and that of the extending end of the fourth or upper plate are substantially continuous and flush with each other.<br>
Since the inner or lower surface of the embossed portion and that of the extending end of the fourth or upper plate are substantially continuous and flush with each other, the shape of the fourth or upper plate is simpler as compared to a case where the inner or lower surface of the embossed portion is lower than that of the extending end of the fourth or upper plate to have a stepped configuration.<br>
Most preferably, the embossed portion is thinner than the fourth plate.<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment of the invention, the tube portion further comprises a resilient contact piece and a resilient reinforcing piece, which preferably are in contact only at respective embossed contact portions.<br>
Preferably, an escaping hole or recess is formed in the resilient reinforcing piece so that when the resilient contact piece is resiliency deformed as the mating terminal is at least partly inserted, a portion of the resilient contact piece can at least partly enter the escaping hole to avoid the interference of the resilient contact piece and one of the plates.<br>
Further preferably, one or more projection-shaped contact portions are provided at one or both of the fourth plate and the third side plate and are engageable with one or more respective projecting portions provided on at the other of the fourth plate and the third side plate.<br>
Still further preferably, the inner surface of the embossed portion and those of the one or more contact portions at the extending end of the fourth plate substantially are continuous and flush with each other.<br>
Further preferably, the terminal fitting further comprises:<br>
a resilient reinforcing piece projecting substantially forward with an inward inclination is formed on the first plate,<br>
an escaping hole or recess being formed in a widthwise intermediate position of the front end portion of the resilient reinforcing piece, and<br>
a guiding projection at least partly insertable into the escaping portion being formed so as to be substantially flush with the first plate,<br>
wherein the guiding projection can at least partly enter the escaping portion of the resilient reinforcing piece and at least the rear edge of the guiding projection substantially in flush with the bottom plate is located behind the front edge of the resilient reinforcing piece.<br>
Further preferably, the guiding projection comprises at least one slanted surface, which is formed preferably by obliquely cutting an inner surface portion of an extending end of the guiding projection or near thereto.<br>
Still further preferably, a locking hole is formed at a substantially opposite side with respect to the resilient reinforcing piece. In other words, a locking hole is preferably provided at the fourth plate at a side or position<br>
substantially opposite to the resilient reinforcing piece being provided at the first plate.<br>
Further preferably, the resilient reinforcing piece comprises one or more excessive deformation preventing portions which can engage the second wall and/or the third wall to prevent an excessive deformation of the resilient reinforcing piece particularly beyond its resiliency limit.<br>
Most preferably, the terminal fitting further comprises a wire crimping portion comprising a plurality of crimping pieces being displaced along the longitudinal direction of the wire, wherein the strength of the rearmost crimping piece is increased as compared to that of the relatively forward crimping piece(s).<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a terminal fitting comprising a tube portion into which a mating terminal is at least partly insertable, the tube portion including: a first plate or first plate portion, second and third plates or plate portions projecting from or at the opposite lateral edge portions of the first plate, a fourth plate or plate portions extending or projecting from the distal portion of the second side plate having an extending end placed in (direct or indirect) contact with the distal end portion (particularly the distal end face) of the third side plate, a resilient reinforcing piece projecting substantially forward with an inward inclination is formed on the first plate, an escaping hole or recess being formed in a widthwise intermediate position of the front end portion of the resilient reinforcing piece, and a guiding projection at least partly insertable into the escaping portion being formed so as to be substantially flush with the first plate, wherein the guiding projection can at least partly enter the escaping portion of the resilient reinforcing piece and at<br>
least the rear edge of the guiding projection substantially in flush with the bottom plate is located behind the front edge of the resilient reinforcing piece.<br>
Accordingly, by providing the resilient reinforcing piece and/or the guiding projection an overall operability of the terminal fitting is improved, as particularly the withdrawability of the terminal fitting from a cavity is improved, in case the terminal fitting is inserted in an improper posture such as in an upside-down or inverted orientation.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the guiding projection comprises at least one slanted surface, which is formed preferably by obliquely cutting an inner surface portion of an extending end of the guiding projection or near thereto.<br>
Preferably, a locking hole is formed at a substantially opposite side with respect to the resilient reinforcing piece. In other words, a locking hole is preferably provided at the fourth plate at a side or position substantially opposite to the resilient reinforcing piece being provided at the first plate.<br>
Further preferably, the resilient reinforcing piece comprises one or more excessive deformation preventing portions which can engage the second wall and/or the third wall to prevent an excessive deformation of the resilient reinforcing piece particularly beyond its resiliency limit.<br>
Still further preferably, the resilient reinforcing piece is provided substantially continuously connected to the base or bottom plate via at least one bent portion so that the resilient reinforcing piece or its longitudinal extension is inclined with respect to the base or bottom plate or its longitudinal extension, preferably at an obtuse angle.<br>
Most preferably, at least one embossed portion is provided at least partly on the resilient locking piece, more preferably at or near the bent portion, so as to reinforce the resilient locking piece.<br>

Hereinafter, a first preferred embodiment of the present invention is described with reference to FIGS. 1 to 8. A terminal fitting Ta of this embodiment is formed by applying bending, folding, embossing and/or cutting/bending or pressing to a flat conductive (preferably metal) plate material P punched or cutting out into a specified (predetermined or predeterminable) shape, and has a shape substantially narrow and long in forward and backward directions FBD as a whole. A front area (preferably a substantially front-half area) of the terminal fitting Ta serves as a (preferably substantially rectangular) tube portion 10 hollow in forward and backward directions FBD and a rear area (preferably a substantially rear-half area) thereof serves as a wire connecting portion to be connected to a wire W, the wire connecting portion preferably comprising a crimping portion 19 in the form of one or more open barrels to be crimped or bent or folded into connection with the wire W.<br>
The tube portion 10 having preferably a polygonal cross-sectional shape, more preferably a substantially rectangular cross-sectional shape includes a<br>
base or bottom plate 11, a lateral (left) side plate 12L (as preferred one side plate), a lateral (right) side plate 12R (as preferred other side plate), at least one ceiling or upper plate 13 and a pressing portion 14. The base or bottom plate 11 preferably is narrow and long in forward and backward directions FED, the lateral (left) side plate 12L (preferably narrow and long in forward and backward directions FBD) projects or stands up at an angle different from 0° or 180°, preferably substantially at right angle from the corresponding lateral (left) edge portion of the base or bottom plate 11, and the lateral (right) side plate 12R (preferably narrow and long in forward and backward directions FBD) projects or stands up at an angle different from 0° or 180°, preferably substantially at right angle from the corresponding lateral (right) edge portion of the base or bottom plate 11. The upper or ceiling plate 13 (preferably narrow and long in forward and backward directions FBD) extends at an angle different from 0° or 180°, preferably substantially normally or laterally or rightward from the upper or distal edge (extending edge) of the lateral (left) side plate 12L preferably substantially in parallel with the base or bottom plate 11, and an extending or distal end (right end) of the ceiling or upper plate 13 substantially contacts, preferably is placed on the upper or distal end surface (extending end surface) of the lateral (right) side plate 12R preferably substantially from above. One or more, preferably a plurality of (e.g. six) notches are formed at the extending end of the ceiling or upper plate 13 preferably while being spaced apart in forward and backward directions FBD, and one or more, preferably a plurality of (e.g. five) projection-shaped contact portions 15a to 15e left at the extending end of the ceiling or upper plate 13 substantially without being cut are held in contact with the upper end surface of the right side plate 12R. On the<br>
other hand, one or more, preferably a plurality of (e.g. six) projecting portions 16a to 16f substantially corresponding to the notches are formed to project outward or upward at the distal or upper end of the lateral (right) side plate 12R, and relative displacements of the ceiling or upper plate 13 and the lateral (right) side plate 12R substantially in forward and backward directions FBD are prevented by the engagement of the respective projecting portions 16a to 16f and the contact portions 15a to 15e (notches). The second and third projecting portions 16b, 16c from the front are substantially continuous with the opposite front and rear ends of a coupling portion 17 extending substantially in forward and backward directions FBD along the lateral (left) edge of the second contact portion 15b from the front. The pressing portion 14 extending laterally or leftward from the distal or upper edge of the lateral (right) side plate 12R preferably substantially in parallel with the base or bottom plate 11 is formed by the second and third projecting portions 16b, 16c and the coupling portion 17. In other words, the coupling portion 14 preferably is substantially U-shaped by coupling the two projecting portions 16b, 16c via the coupling portion 17.<br>
A front area (preferably a substantially front-half area) of the ceiling or upper plate 13 is partially embossed to project inward or downward, thereby forming one or more, preferably a pair of embossed portions 18L, 18R narrow and long substantially in forward and backward directions FBD and/or transversely arranged substantially side by side. The lateral (left) embossed portion 18L is such that the upper surface (outer surface) thereof is recessed to have a stepped or recessed configuration relative to a highest part 13a of the upper surface of the upper plate 13 and the lower surface (inner surface)<br>
thereof is projected to have a stepped configuration relative to a highest part 13b of the lower surface of the upper plate 13.<br>
On the other hand, the upper surface (outer surface) of the other lateral (right) embossed portion 18R is recessed to have a stepped or recessed configuration (particularly with more or less sharp or rounded edges) relative to the highest part 13a of the upper surface of the upper plate 13, and is lower or more inward than the upper surface of the lateral (left) embossed portion 18L. Further, the lower surface (inner surface) of the lateral (right) embossed portion 18R is projected to have a stepped configuration relative to the highest part 13b of the lower or inner surface of the upper plate 13 and preferably is at the substantially same height as the lower or inner surface of the lateral (left) embossed portion 18L. In other words, the lateral (right) embossed portion 18R is thinner than the ceiling or upper plate 13, and the thickness (dimension between the upper and lower surfaces) of the lateral (right) embossed portion 18R is smaller than the thickness of the other lateral (left) embossed portion 18L. An elevation difference between the upper surface of the lateral (right) embossed portion 18R and the highest part 13a of the outer or upper surface of the ceiling or upper plate 13 preferably is set substantially equal to the thickness of a conductive (metal) plate material P (particularly pressing portion 14) of the terminal fitting Ta.<br>
Further, the inner or lower surfaces of the contact portions 15a to 15e at or near the extending end of the upper plate 13 substantially are continuous and flush with the lower surface of the lateral (right) embossed portion 18R at the same height. Further, the upper or outer surfaces of the contact portions 15a to 15e preferably are higher than the upper or outer surface of the lateral<br>
(right) embossed portion 18R and/or at the substantially same height as the upper or outer surface of the lateral (left) embossed portion 18L. In other words, the thickness of the contact portions 15a to 15e at the extending end of the upper plate 13 is set equal to the thickness of the conductive (metal) plate material P.<br>
The above coupling portion 17 of the pressing portion 14 is so arranged as to substantially correspond to the lateral (right) embossed portion 18R with respect to width direction WD (transverse direction). The coupling portion 17 is at least partly fitted into a recess in the outer or distal or upper surface of the lateral right embossed portion 18R such that the lower or inner surface of the coupling portion 17 preferably is in surface contact with the upper surface of the lateral (right) embossed portion 18R. With the coupling portion 17 held in contact, the outer or upper surface of the coupling portion 17 is at the substantially same height as the highest part 13a of the outer or upper surface of the ceiling or upper plate 13. In other words, the coupling portion 17 does not project upward or outward from the ceiling or upper plate 13.<br>
According to this embodiment, an outward or upward movement of the ceiling or upper plate 13 is prevented to keep the rectangular tube portion 10 in a specified (predetermined or predeterminable) rectangular tubular shape by placing the pressing portion 14 extending from the upper or distal edge of the lateral (right) side plate 12R (at an angle different from 0° or 180°, preferably substantially normal to the lateral (rights) side plate 12R and/or substantially in parallel with the bottom plate 11) substantially in contact with the upper or outer surface of the embossed portion 18R. Since the embossed portion 18R of the ceiling or upper plate 13 to have the pressing portion 14 placed thereon or in<br>
contact therewith projects stepwise downward or inward have a stepped configuration, i.e. is formed by recessing the upper or outer surface of the ceiling or upper plate 13, the height of the rectangular tube portion 10 can be reduced by the recessed dimension of the embossed portion 18R in this embodiment as compared to a case where the pressing portion is placed on the highest part of the upper surface of the upper plate.<br>
Further, out of the embossed portion 18R and the pressing portion 14 to be placed one at least partly over the other, the embossed portion 18R preferably is at least partly thinned. Thus, the height of the rectangular tube portion 10 can be further reduced by the thinned dimension.<br>
Further, the lower or inner surface of the embossed portion 18R may serve as a contact surface with a mating terminal (not shown). This means that the embossed portion 18R as means for reducing the height of the (rectangular) tube portion 10 preferably doubles as contact means with the mating terminal. Accordingly, the shape of the ceiling or upper plate 13 is simpler in this embodiment as compared to a case where the embossed portion is formed in addition to the contact means with the mating terminal.<br>
Since the lower surface of the lateral (right) embossed portion 18R and those of the contact portions 15a to 15e at the extending end of the upper plate 13 preferably substantially are continuous and flush with each other, the shape of the upper or ceiling plate 13 is simpler in this embodiment as compared to a case where the lower surface of the embossed portion is lower than the lower surface of the extending end of the upper plate have a stepped configuration.<br>
Next, the construction of the rectangular tube portion 10 other than the above is described.<br>
A (preferably substantially rectangular) locking hole 20 is formed to vertically penetrate a rear area (preferably a substantially rear-half area) of the ceiling or upper plate 13. A resilient contact piece 21 (preferably having a rear side thereof placed on the upper or inner surface of the bottom plate 11 and/or projecting forward with an upward inclination) is at least partly accommodated in the rectangular tube portion 10. The rear end of the resilient contact piece 21 preferably is continuous with (supported on) the bottom edge of a supporting plate 22 extending substantially downward or inward from the rear end of the lateral (right) edge of the ceiling or upper plate 13 preferably substantially along the inner surface of the lateral (right) side plate 12R.<br>
A (preferably substantially rectangular) resilient reinforcing piece 23 projecting backward with an upward inclination is formed at a front end portion of the base or bottom plate 11 preferably by cutting and bending. The resilient reinforcing piece 23 is arranged at least partly below the resilient contact piece 21, and a (preferably substantially spherical or round or elliptical) contact portion 23a is formed on the upper or inner surface of the rear end (extending end or near thereto) of the resilient reinforcing piece 23. On the other hand, a (preferably substantially spherical or round or elliptical) contact portion 21 a substantially vertically facing the contact portion 23a of the resilient reinforcing piece 23 is formed on the lower surface (surface substantially facing the base or bottom plate 11) of the resilient contact piece 21.<br>
A preferably substantially comb-shaped (particularly having a semicircular cross section) escaping hole 24 is formed to (vertically) penetrate the base end of the resilient reinforcing piece 23. When the resilient contact piece 21 is resiliency deformed outward or downward as the mating terminal is<br>
inserted, the front end of the resilient contact piece 21 at least partly enters the escaping hole 24 to avoid the interference of the front end of the resilient contact piece 21 and the base or bottom plate 11. At least one recess 25 is so formed in the inner or upper surface of the resilient reinforcing piece 23 from the rear edge of the escaping hole 24 as to thin the resilient reinforcing piece 23 toward the back. Further, one or more excessive deformation preventing portions 26 are formed to project laterally outward from the (preferably substantially opposite) lateral (left and/or right) edge(s) of (preferably the rear end (extending end or near thereto) of) the resilient reinforcing piece 23, and prevent an excessive deformation of the resilient reinforcing piece 23 beyond its resiliency limit by the engagement thereof with the corresponding lateral (left and/or right) side plate(s) 12L, 12R.<br>
The narrow and long mating terminal at least partly inserted into the (rectangular) tube portion 10 from front is held or clamped between the lower surfaces of the two lateral (left and right) embossed portions 18L, 19R and the resilient contact piece 21 resiliency deformed downward or outward from above and below, and the resilient reinforcing piece 23 is resiliency deformed downward or outward together with the resilient contact piece 21 preferably by the contact of both contact portions 21 a, 23a at this time. A specified (predetermined or predeterminable) contact pressure is ensured by resilient restoring force(s) of the resilient contact piece 21 and/or the resilient reinforcing piece 23. Since the resilient contact piece 21 and the resilient reinforcing piece 23 preferably are in contact only at the contact portions 21 a, 23a, they can be stably resiliency deformed, which leads to a stable contact pressure. Further, since the resilient contact piece 21 and the resilient reinforcing piece 23<br><br>
respectively  substantially  extend  forward  and  backward,   i.e.   in  opposite directions, a degree of freedom in setting the length can be improved.<br>
Accordingly, to reduce the height of a tube portion, a tube portion 10 is formed such that at least one pair of side plates 12L, 12R stand up or project from the substantially opposite lateral (left and right) edge portions of a base or bottom plate 11 and an extending end of a ceiling or upper plate 13 extending from the upper or distal edge of the lateral (left) side plate 12L preferably substantially in parallel with the base or bottom plate 11 is placed in (direct or indirect) contact with (preferably the upper end surface of) the other lateral (right) side plate 12R. The ceiling or upper plate 13 is formed with at least one embossed portion 18R projecting inward or downward to preferably substantially have a stepwise configuration, and at least one pressing portion 14 extending from the upper edge of the lateral (right) side plate 12R is placed into contact with the upper surface of the embossed portion 18R to prevent an outward or upward movement of the ceiling or upper plate 13. Since the embossed portion 18R to have the pressing portion 14 at least partly placed thereon projects inward or downward to preferably substantially have a stepwise configuration, i.e. has a recessed upper surface, the height of the tube portion 10 can be reduced by a recessed dimension. <second embodiment></second>
Next, a second preferred embodiment of the present invention is described with reference to FIGS. 9 to 14. A terminal fitting Tb of the second embodiment differs from the first embodiment in part of the base or bottom plate 11 and a resilient reinforcing piece 30. Since the other construction is similar or same as in the first embodiment, it is identified using the same<br>
reference numerals and the similar or same structure, functions and effects thereof are not described.<br>
The (preferably substantially rectangular) resilient reinforcing piece 30 projecting substantially forward with an inward or upward inclination is formed preferably by cutting and bending part of the bottom plate 11 of the second embodiment. The resilient reinforcing piece 30 is arranged at least partly below the resilient contact piece 21, and one or more excessive deformation preventing portions 31 are formed to project laterally outward from the lateral (left and/or right) edge(s) of the front end (extending end or near thereto) of the resilient reinforcing piece 30 and prevent an excessive deformation of the resilient reinforcing piece 30 particularly beyond its resiliency limit by the engagement thereof with the lateral (left and/or right) side plates 12L, 12R. Particularly, the resilient reinforcing piece 30 is provided substantially continuously connected to the base or bottom plate 11 via a bent portion 30a so that the resilient reinforcing piece 30 is inclined with respect to the base or bottom plate 11 preferably at an obtuse angle. Furthermore, at least one embossed portion 30b is provided at or near the bent portion 30a so as to reinforce the resilient locking piece 30.<br>
A (preferably substantially rectangular) escaping hole 32 is formed in a widthwise intermediate position (preferably substantially in the widthwise center) of the front end portion of the resilient reinforcing piece 30. A guiding projection 34 at least partly insertable into the escaping portion 32 is formed at the substantially same height as the base or bottom plate 11 (so as to be substantially flush with the base or bottom plate 11) to extend from the front end portion or the front edge of an opening 33 left in the base or bottom plate<br>
11 by forming the rosilient reinforcing piece 30 preferably by cutting and bending. At least one slanted surface 35 is formed preferably by obliquely cutting the lower surface of the rear end (extending end or near thereto) of the guiding projection 34. Further, an escaping hole 36 is formed to (vertically) penetrate a front end portion of the base or bottom plate 11. When the resilient contact piece 21 is resiliency deformed outward or downward as a mating terminal is at least partly inserted, the front end of the resilient contact piece 21 at least partly enters the escaping hole 36 to avoid the interference of the front end of the resilient contact piece 21 with the base or bottom plate 11.<br>
The terminal fitting Tb of the second embodiment is at least partly inserted upside down into a cavity 41 formed in a connector housing 40. A (preferably substantially cantilever-shaped) locking portion 42 extending substantially forward along the inner or bottom surface is resiliency deformably formed in the cavity 41. In the inserting process, the locking portion 42 is resiliency deformed outward or downward by the interference with the ceiling or upper plate 13 of the (rectangular) tube portion 10. When the terminal fitting Tb is substantially properly inserted, the locking portion 42 is resiliency at least partly restored to engage a retaining projection 42a on the inner (upper) surface of the locking portion 42 with the front edge of a locking hole 20. The terminal fitting Tb is retained by this engagement (see FIG. 13).<br>
Upon withdrawing the inserted terminal fitting Tb, a withdrawal jig (not shown) is or can be at least partly inserted from front to push the locking portion 42 outward or down particularly by the leading end thereof. Thus, the locking portion 42 is disengaged from the locking hole 20 to make the terminal fitting Tb<br>
withdrawable (freed from the retained state). Then, the terminal fitting Tb may be pulled backward with the locking portion 42 kept resiliency deformed.<br>
Because of the miniaturization of the terminal fitting Tb of this embodiment, the terminal fitting Tb might be erroneously inserted into the cavity 41 in an improper posture, e.g. in such a posture vertically inverted from the proper one. In such a case, the terminal fitting Tb can be withdrawn without using the withdrawal jig since the locking portion 42 is left resiliently deformed outward or downward by the interference with the bottom plate 11 of the (rectangular) tube portion 10. After being withdrawn, the terminal fitting Tb may be inserted again in a proper posture.<br>
Upon withdrawing the terminal fitting Tb inserted in the improper posture (e.g. in the vertically inverted posture), the resilient reinforcing piece 30 passes the locking portion 42 and immediately thereafter the opening 33 left by forming the resilient reinforcing piece 30 by cutting and bending passes the locking portion 42. Since the resilient reinforcing piece 30 preferably is in the form of a cantilever substantially extending obliquely forward toward the inside of the (rectangular) tube portion 10 from the outer surface of the bottom plate 11, the front edge of the opening 33 might catch the retaining projection 42a of the locking portion 42 held in contact with the lower surface of the resilient reinforcing piece 30.<br>
However, in this embodiment, the guiding projection 34 formed to project backward from the front edge of the opening 33 at least partly enters the escaping portion 32 of the resilient reinforcing piece 30 and the rear edge of the guiding projection 34 substantially in flush with the bottom plate 11 is located behind the front edge of the resilient reinforcing piece 30. Accordingly, as<br>
compared to a case where no guiding projection is formed, a maximum elevation difference between the lower surface of the resilient reinforcing piece 30 (surface facing the locking portion 42) and the lower surface of the bottom plate 11 (guiding projection 34) can be suppressed. Thus, if the terminal fitting Tb moves further backward from a state where the locking portion 42 is in contact with the lower surface of the resilient reinforcing piece 30, the guiding projection 34 moves onto the upper surface of the retaining projection 42a without the rear edge thereof getting caught thereby as shown in FIG. 14 and can smoothly pass the locking portion 42. Further, since the slanted surface 35 is formed on the outer surface of the rear end of the guiding projection 34 in this embodiment, it can be securely avoided that the front edge of the opening 33 gets caught by the retaining projection 42a. <third embodiment></third>
Next, a third preferred embodiment of the present invention is described with reference to FIGS. 15 and 16. A terminal fitting Tc of the third embodiment differs from the second embodiment in part of the base or bottom plate 11 and a resilient reinforcing piece 50. Since the other construction is similar or same as in the second embodiment, the similar or same structure is identified using the same reference numerals and functions and effects thereof are not described.<br>
In the third embodiment, the base or bottom plate 11 is not formed with means corresponding to the guiding projection 34 of the second embodiment. Accordingly, the front edge of an opening 51 left by forming the resilient reinforcing piece 50 preferably by cutting and bending is located before the front edge of the resilient reinforcing piece 50. Further, since the guiding<br>
projection 34 preferably is not formed, the resilient reinforcing piece 50 is not formed with means corresponding to the escaping portion 32 of the second embodiment. <fourth embodiment></fourth>
Next, a fourth preferred embodiment of the present invention is described with reference to FIG. 17. The fourth embodiment is applicable to the terminal fittings Ta, Tb, Tc of the above first to third embodiments and is featured by at least one crimping portion 60 in the form of an open barrel.<br>
The crimping portion 60 of the fourth embodiment is comprised of an insulation barrel 61 having one or more, preferably a pair of lateral (left and/or right) crimping pieces 61L, 61R to be crimped or bent or folded into connection with an insulation coating Wa of a wire W, and a wire barrel 62 having one or more, preferably a pair of lateral (left and/or right) crimping pieces 63 to be crimped or bent or folded into connection with a core Wb at least partly exposed by at least partly stripping the insulation coating Wa of the wire W. In the insulation barrel 61, the lateral (left and right) crimping pieces 61 L, 61R preferably are offset in forward and backward directions FBD to locate the right crimping piece 61L behind the left crimping piece 61L with both crimping pieces 61 L, 61R crimped or bent or folded to wind around the wire W.<br>
When a backward pulling force acts on the wire W, this pulling force acts on the insulation barrel 61 and particularly the right crimping piece 61R arranged behind resists most of drag against the pulling force. A load resulting from this pulling force is taken into account in this embodiment, and width WR (dimension in forward and backward directions FBD) of the right crimping piece 61R located behind is set larger than width WL (dimension in forward and<br>
backward directions) of the left crimping piece 61L located before. Alternatively or additionally the thickness of the right crimping piece 61R located behind is set larger than the thickness of the left crimping piece 61L located before (e.g. by thinning the left crimping piece 61 L). In other words, the strength (rigidity) of the rear (right) crimping piece 61R is increased as compared to that of the front (left) crimping piece 61L particularly without changing the dimension of the entire insulation barrel 61 in forward and backward directions FBD. This can securely prevent the deformation of the crimping piece 61R upon the action of a backward pulling force, wherefore wire retaining performance by the crimping portion 60 has good reliability. <br>
