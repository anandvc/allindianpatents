The present invention is explained in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings and the following specific embodiments, which are described to explain the invention. It may be understood that various modifications and variations of the features shown are capable of being practised within the scope of the invention discussed, and therefore the<br>
invention should not be construed as being limited to the examples herein mentioned.<br>
a)     Health monitoring system for plants:<br>
Irrigation of plants and agriculture is carried out in a most inefficient manner. The fields are generally irrigated by flooding them with water. Water is wasted in irrigation systems because overall coverage by water is given to the plant from the surface and the bulk of the water fed is wasted, the actual requirement by the plant is of very little water. Existing drip devices feed specific quantum of water at predetermined intervals. This is wasteful, ineffective and may not always meet the needs for optimal irrigation of plants.<br>
When excess fertilizer or mineral is given to the field, the excess of the mineral is left in the soil in the form of a white layer and salination takes place. This causes the land to become fallow and infertile and become wasteland. We have thousands of hectares of such land in various parts of the waterfed soil regions. The only to way reclaim the land is to set up an expensive system of underground pipes to pump out the minerals from the top soil as is being done with Canadian help in Kotah in Rajasthan. This is a very expensive method of regaining use of land which could have been protected by better water and nutrient management<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the applicants propose a sensor system, which will sense the lack of moisture either at plant roots, or foliage or both and release the required amount of water till such time as needs of the plant are met. This system can also be used to control the nutrients and minerals required by the plants. The said sensor system will sense lack of minerals and monitor the health of the plant using multiple parameters. These sensory information will then be used to calculate and<br>
inject the precise amount of water and nutrients to the roots of the plant. This is a dynamic feedback system. Using sensors which can sense specific pests one can control the pests by various means including localised pesticide spray. Fig 1(a) and (b)of the accompanying drawings illustrate the said embodiment. Fig. la represents the placement of various components. The sensor A is placed beneath the ground level at a depth appropriate to the requirement of the plant. A number of such sensors are placed with each plant or plants. These sensors are all connected to a central logic unit which controls the drip units associated with the sensors. The functioning of the system is as per figure lb. The logic unit checks the sensor and if it finds that the plant needs moisture it activates the associated drip unit and releases water till such time as the sensor indicates adequacy.<br>
In addition, health sensors can also be provided in the soil, plant and/or atmosphere around the plants to sense the health of the plant. The health sensor provides respective signals to a control which activates various means to provide a response to rectify any deficiency or requirement. The health sensors can be nutrient sensor, heat sensor, electrical sensor, etc. These sensors can sense the various aspects of health of a plant/plants and provides signals to the controls which in turn triggers various means to meet the requirements or provide remedial measures. For example, heat sensor is provided in the soil, plant and/or the atmosphere to measure the temperature of the atmosphere, on the plant or the soil. This sensor provide signals to a controlling device which activates sprinklers located near the soil or plants to sprinkle some water on the leaves of the plant or soil so that the leaves or the soil do not get dried or scorched. In fact, this system helps in monitoring and protecting the plants from drying or scorched by the change in the temperature.<br>
A similar systems such as nutrient sensors, moisture sensors can be used to sense different types of elements/features such as chlorophyll content of the leaves, lack of nutrients such as phosphates or nitrates, etc. or electrical conductivity of the plant material. These senses can be sent to corresponding controls which could trigger the required remedial measures.<br>
(b) Oven control system<br>
Most home and industrial ovens, which work on LPG or such gases have a system for preventing flameouts by using either a pilot flame or by using a thermocouple sensor, which reignites the extinguished gases. There does not exist any system, which senses the presence of unburnt LPG or such gas and then controls the ignition. Both the pilot flame system and the thermocouple system are unable to respond to failed ignition and the gas keeps on leaking leading to possibly hazardous and dangerous condition.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the applicants have devised a sensor system to sense the presence of unburnt LPG or similar gases and use the sensor to control the ignition process, which will reignite this extinguished gas. This will provide a high degree of safety, as compared to the pilot flame or the thermocouple method. The use of a second sensor or a timing logic can also ensure that the supply is cut off in case of failed ignition and prolonged leakage of the combustible gas<br>
Fig 2a represents the circuit for a sensor system capable of detecting the presence of unburnt LPG and the placement of components in such a system. There are two sensors B and D. The sensor(s) B are with each flame unit and sense the presence of unburnt gas and thus a unlit flame. The sensor D is an overall safety sensor which checks the failure of ignition controlled by sensor B. The sensor is monitored by the logic and<br>
control unit which activates the appropriate flame igniter(s) in case of a failure of the ignition system indicated by the presence of gas at sensor D, the main gas supply is cut off and other safety measures such as alarm and mains cut off are activated. Fig 2(b) represents the functioning of such a system.<br>
Flow metering or measurement of liquids or gases<br>
Currently, most flow metering or flow measurement methods use some sort of vanes or rotary impellers, which cause a meter to move depending on the movement of the fluid or gas. This measurement is not able to discriminate as to whether the actual measurement is due to the desired fluid or gas or due to the presence of an undesired elements such as air or water, which may be flowing through the same pipe or conduit. As a result wrong metering takes place and the correct measurement is not known.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, the applicants have devised a sensor system which can sense the desired fluid or gas and activate the metering only when the desired fluid or gas passes through the metering system. The metering system is disabled by a control mechanism whenever the undesirable fluid or gas passes through the system.<br>
Fig 3 a illustrates the placement of components in a sensor system that may be used for flow metering or flow measuring. The fluid (B) flows in the pipeline (A) along with mixed air/water etc. The metering circuit (C) meters the flow of the fluid through the pipeline. When the sensor (D) senses that the fluid in the pipeline is other than the desired fluid it disables the metering circuit and thus ensure that the correct reading of the fluid is maintained. Fig 3b represents the functioning of such a system.<br>
(f) Control of chlorine levels<br>
Water in swimming pools is chlorinated to disinfect the water. This chlorination is done either by using cylinders of chlorine gas or by using some sort of bleaching powder solution or liquid chlorine agents. Currently, the amount of chlorine added to the water is done by guesswork or by simple calculations. As a result, the amount of chlorine is either inadequate thereby defeating the very purpose of the chlorination or is in excess, which causes discomfort to the occupants of the pool, as chlorine is a highly poisonous gas, which affects breathing and skin.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, the applicants have devised a chlorine sensor, which will sense the desired chlorine level in the outlet water of the chlorination chamber and use this sensed value to control the degree of chlorination. This process can be used in water treatment plants and for treatment of potable water including ensuring adequate and safe levels of chlorine in overhead storage tanks.<br>
Figure 6a represents the placement of various components in a sensor system used for detection of fluctuation in chlorine levels in swimming pools according to the invention. The diagram indicates both the applications viz., the swimming pool or water chlorination units and also the overhead water storage tanks used domestically to store water. The sensor (E) or (F) senses the chlorination level and cause more or less chlorine to be released by the control unit (G) via the chlorine release valve (D) the chlorine is mixed with the water in the mixer unit (C). An additional sensor (F) placed in the pool away from the inlet monitors the chlorine level in the pool and if found to be above a preset safe value cause an alarm and cutoff of the chlorine. Fig 6(b) represents the functioning of such a system.<br>
Small animal / bird trap<br>
Mouse problem is a problem of every house, storage areas, fields and other places where edibles are kept. The present mousetraps are either based on some sort of a mechanical devise for catching or killing the mouse or an ultrasonic noise generator, which makes the rats run away. The common problems in the existing trap systems is that each trap traps or kills only a single rodent in a single attempt and hence is not suitable for trapping more than one rodent. In fact, this invention relates to a door chamber rodent / bird trap used to trap the rodents or small birds. Single chamber rodent / bird traps are well known in the art. The trap comprises a chamber having a spring loaded door provided at one side of the chamber. A hook is provided in the middle of the chamber such that to hold the food item meant for the rodent / bird trap. Another door is provided at the other side of the trap for disposing of the trapped rodent / bird from the chamber of the trap. As soon as the rodent / bird trap touches the food item, the hook is displaced and thus the trap door is released confining the rodent / bird in the chamber of the trap.<br>
There are certain disadvantages associated with the conventional rodent / bird trap. One of the main disadvantage is that only one rodent / bird trap can be trapped at a time in the rodent / bird trap.<br>
Another disadvantage is that some time the rodent / bird eats the food item slowly and comes back from the chamber of the traps and thus these traps are not depending on foolproof traps.<br>
In the event, a rodent / bird escapes, the rodent / bird by virtue of their communication system warn other rodent / bird of the presence of the traps, which reduces the efficacy of the system.<br><br>
In one embodiment, the applicants have provided a trapping system wherein the rat enters the trap attracted by food. As soon as the rat enters, a sensing mechanism, which senses the presence of rat within the trap and either shuts the rat or traps the rat in another chamber. The rat trap is reset once the rat enters into another chamber for a fresh catch.<br>
In another embodiment, the rat trap is being provided with another means wherein the rat which has already been trapped into the trap is either confined or killed by means of a conventional killing method.<br>
Figure 5a represents for details of components and their placement for the rat trap provided according to the invention. The Trap works by sensing via sensor (A) or sensor (B). The sensors work on both proximity sensing of IR sensing of the rat as well as by sensing the presence of the rat by its weight. The presence of the rat causes the entry door to snap shut by activation from a solenoid (C) via a control unit (E). IN a version of the trap the rat is further trapped into a killing or holding chamber and the trap is ready for second use. The trapped mouse is killed using CMOK (conventional method of killing). Fig 5(b) represents the functioning of such a system. Fig 5(c) represents the legends used in the said rat trap system.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention a rat trap comprising a first chamber adapted to be connected with a second chamber, sensing means being provided at any suitable place at the entrance of the trap such as the bottom or top side of the gate of the chamber such that to activate a solenoid in order to release the door provided for closing the entry gate, an intermediate door being provided at the entry gate from second chamber adapted to be opened to allow the entry of the rat into the second chamber,<br>
means may or may not be provided with the second chamber to kill the rats.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention provides the rat trap has first chamber adapted to be connected with a second chamber removably. Sensing means are provided at a suitable place, preparable the side, bottom and/or top side of the entry gate of first chamber to sense the presence of rat in the gate and such that to activate a solenoid provided for releasing the door to close the entry gate. A second door is provided at the connecting end of the second chamber such that to allow the entry of the rat to the second chamber but not to come out therefrom. A disposal window is provided in the second chamber to dispose of the trapped rat therefrom.<br>
Still another embodiment of the invention provides an option a third chamber with or without rat killing means is connected to said second chamber removably for housing and disposing of the rat(s) therewith.<br>
Yet another embodiment of the invention provides the rat trap described above can also function with two trap door chamber first and second and two chambers in a single compartment. First trap door is normally open. Trap doors are mechanically linked in such a way that when first trap door closes second trap door is released and becomes free to swing open with little pressure. Linkage has been provided to add additional security from escape of the trapped animal. Second door is a one way flip door which opens only into the compartment.<br>
Kitchen and industrial safety device<br>
The use of LPG is prevalent in residential and commercial kitchens. LPG is a heavier than air, highly inflammable gas, which forms an explosive<br>
mixture when it leaks due to an open and unlit burner or leakage from the piping system or by defects in the valves of the LPG cylinders. Currently, the only means of sensing LPG leakage is by the strong offensive smell added to the gas. This means that someone has to physically smell the gas and then take remedial action. At present, there is no system, which can automatically sense the presence of gas in the kitchen and raise an alarm and if desired activate some basic safety controls.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the applicants have devised a sensor system which senses the presence of the fuel gas (LPG,CNG, Propane etc.) and the sensor will on activation trigger an alarm, /and if desired will cut off the fuel supply to the appliance as also switch of the electrical power to the room to prevent an explosion being caused by an electrical spark. The basic control circuit can be used for a variety of predetermined actions, which can be initially set up.<br>
Figure 8a represents the placement and identification of components for a sensor system used for detection of LPG.<br>
The gas sensor (A) senses the presence of unlit or leaking gas and this causes the control unit to initiate safety action such as an Alarm, Activation of exhaust (C), Cutting of gas via a control (D), and cutting off the mains supply (E) for additional safety. The control unit can be programmed for a variety of safety sequences. Fig 8(b) represents the functioning of such a system. Fig 8 (c) represents the legends used in the said LPG detection sensor system.<br>
(i) Dehumidification<br>
Closed spaces and areas such as basements, attics, godowns are subject to the problem of excessive humidity, which causes fungus and rotting and<br>
spoilage of material. Most dehumidifiers work without any knowledge of the environment or the humidity and are empirical in nature.<br>
In a further embodiment, the applicants have devised a sensor system which will sense the humidity level within the enclosed space and based on this level control and activate remedial measures, which will dehumidify the enclosed area using a standard dehumidifiers. The system can also be used to control anti-fungal device such as ozone generators or anti-fungal sprays in the same area. The release of ozone will be monitored and maintained at acceptable levels.<br>
Figure 9a represents the placement of the various component of a sensor system that is used to detect and control humidification levels.. The system may be in any enclosed space such as a basement, attic or godown etc. The Humidity sensor (B) senses the humidity level and this activates the dehumidification unit (A) and the exhaust (C) to remove the humid air from the room. We can also incorporate an Ozone unit (D) for anti-fungal purposes and activate it when the humidity increases. The ozone sensor (F) will sense excess of ozone and stop the generator via the control unit. Fig 9(b) represents the functioning of such a system. Fig 9 (c) represents the legends used in the said dehumidification sensor system.<br>
(j) Harmful gases sensing and control system<br>
A variety of harmful gases can exist in a closed atmosphere and be hazardous to health. Some examples are Ozone. Ozone is a corrosive, harmful gas generated by electric sparking and electric appliances. Excess of ozone can cause breathing problems and also damage rubber parts and seals. At present, there is no system or methodology to solve this problem. Typical ozone risk areas are locations such as projection rooms where are sparking can generate ozone, high voltage areas such as power plants, X<br>
ray and such machines etc. Similarly there is a likely hood of RADON gas in basements and underground chambers, Methane in Sewage systems and sewer networks and lines. Ammonia from Ice and cold storage plants, Chlorine in industrial environments etc.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, the applicants have devised a sensor system which can sense the level of harmful gas in such areas and closed spaces by the use of special gas specific sensors. The sensors will activate remedial measures such as exhaustion of the polluting gas or dilution by pumping in additional fresh air into the space.<br>
Figure 10a represents the placement of various components in a sensor system that is used to detect the harmful gases. The gas sensor (A) senses the presence of gas and based on its input the control unit (D) will activate remedial measures which may be one or mofe of the following means i.e., Starting an Alarm (F), Switching on a Exhaust unit (C) or a Blower unit (E). Fig 10(b) represents the functioning of such a system. Fig 10 (b) represents the functioning of such a system. Fig 10 (c) represents the legends used in the said sensor system for detection of harmful gases<br>
(k) Heart beat monitoring unit<br>
Heart Attacks are the most common disease faced in the urban society of today. It is a well known fact that if an early warmng of an impending or an ongoing attack is available then the patient can be treated and generally survives. Unfortunately in most fatal cases, the patient could have been saved if either he had come to know that he was having a heart attack and not an attack on indigestion or if adequate warning was used to initiate prophylactic measures.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, the applicants have devised a sensor system to monitor the heart beat patterns of the patient wearing the<br>
device. These patterns will be compared with stored patterns and using a pattern recognition technique the onset of the heart attack will be identified. This will cause an alarm to be generated and could also be used to inject medicines which will improve the survival chances of the patient and mitigate the effects of the heart attack. The device will be portable and easy to carry device. The device will be adjustable to meet specific patient needs.<br>
Figure 11a represents the placement of component of a sensor system which can be used to monitor and detect the changes in the heat beats. The sensor (A) senses the heart beat and feeds it to the control and logic unit (B). The logic unit will use a variety of techniques such as comparison with the past heart beat cycles and use pattern recognition techniques to ascertain a likely heart attack condition. This will activate an alarm unit and can also be used to operate additional remedial action such as injecting a predetermined amount of a drug into the patient. Fig 11(b) represents the functioning of such a system. Fig 11 (c) represents the legends used in the said sensor system for detection of changes in heart beat pattern.<br>
(I) Nappy monitor<br>
Modern Nappy's or diapers are so designed that they absorb all the moisture and do not allow any leakage. They also use extra layers to give a dryish feeling to the baby. Unfortunately, this means that the parents do not come to know when the nappy is wet and sometimes the baby may not also given an indication. The keeping of a wet nappy for extended periods of time is both uncomfortable and unhygienic.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, the applicants have devised a sensor system to sense the moisture/urine in the nappy by using a light weight sensor. This will activate a musical chime, which will indicate that the nappy needs to be changed. The device will be light and portable and will be available in both reusable and disposable variety.<br>
Figure 12a represents the placement of components in a sensor system used to monitor the moisture consent in a nappy. The system is based on a sensor, which senses the presence of urine or moisture either by changes in its parameters, or by generating an electrical current from dissimilar electrodes on a substrate. This will cause an alarm to be activated which can be either aural or visual or both. Fig 12(b) represents the functioning of such a system.<br>
Eco Friendly Pencil Sharpener<br>
Pencil Sharpening is done in variety of ways. The cheapest pencil sharpener is small hand held sharpener used by children and adults alike. These sharpeners are not able to indicate when pencil has been sharpened as a result the pencil is needlessly turned causing wastage of wood and lead. The invention aims to give aural, visual or both indication of the extent of sharpening. This besides being a novelty is also green technology, which will reduce the amount of wastage of pencils. The sharpener will have an integrated sensor and aural/visual indication Device. The sensor will get pressed or activated by the sharpened lead and activate the indication.<br>
Though a variety of electrical and mechanical sharpeners are available, but no low cost technology in the hand held sharpeners exist.<br>
The existing system does not have any indication of the state of sharpening of the pencil as a result the user specially children over-sharpen the pencil causing avoidable waste.<br>
The objective of this invention is to provide an indication system, which can be incorporated in hand-held sharpeners to indicate when the pencil is sharpened by aural, visual or combination indication.<br>
As the low cost hand-held sharpeners are the most widely used sharpeners in the world. This unique eco-friendly sharpener will indicate the pencil is sharpened and thus prevent the wastage. This is low cost and efficient, can be developed indigenously.<br>
This is dependable small in size and does not have any competition in this segment.<br>
The alarm/visual indication consists of a small circuit with an integral battery, which has two contacts kept open, when these contacts are caused to be closed due to the lead of the pencil moving forward during the process of sharpening the pencil, the circuit is completed and the alarm/visual indication is activated.<br>
