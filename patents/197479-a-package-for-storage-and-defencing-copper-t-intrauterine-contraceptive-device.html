				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a package for a copper T intravenous device.<br>
Copper T is a contraceptive device implanted into the female uterus for fertility control. The Copper T comprises of a polyethylene T shaped device having a horizontal arm and a vertical stem. When packaged the horizontal arm is kept in an unfolded stage, that is straight. Prior to implantation into the female uterus the horizontal arm of the T must be folded to become parallel to the vertical arm and the folded horizontal arm along with the vertical arm are inserted into the inserter tube. Thereafter the inserter tube is passed into the uterus through the cervical canal and the Copper T is pushed out of the inserter tube to lie free in the uterine cavity.<br>
The procedure of folding of the horizontal arm  of<br>
the T for placement within the inserter tube is performed after removing the Copper T and inserter T from the packaging. The surgeon with the gloved hand presses together the two segments of the horizontal arm and pushes the arms into the inserter tube.<br>
It has now been found that the act of touching the horizontal  arm  is  a  step which  at  times  leads  to<br>
contamination of the T with microorganisms. Therefore a 'no touch' technique has been suggested. The folding of the horizontal arm is done while the T is within the packaging. However manipulating the horizontal arm by feel from the outside of the packaging is quite difficult. Therefore several types of insertion facilitator devices have been developed. These gadgets are an additional component beyond the device parts and packaging already existing and therefore add to the cost. Moreover most of the insertion facilitators have to be used only after removal of the T from the packaging. It is only that the surgeon touches the insertion facilitator and not the horizontal arm. Nevertheless it is noted that very often some portion of the surgeon's fingers slip beyond the insertion facilitator device and come to touch the horizontal arm thereby defeating the purpose of providing the insertion facilitator.<br>
An  object  of  this invention  is  to  propose  a package  for Copper T intravenous device which  obviates the disadvantages of the prior art.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a package for Copper T intravenous device and wherein the Copper T is no longer contaminated.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to propose a package for Copper T intravenous device which is simple and does not increase the costs in comparison with the prior art.<br>
According to this invention , there is provided a package for storage and dispensing of a<br>
copper T intrauterine contraceptive device comprising an outer envelope and an inner envelope,<br>
each envelope made of 2 sheets of polymeric material such as laminates of polyster or<br>
polethylene, each envelope rectangular in shape having 2 longer edges and 2 smaller edges,<br>
characterised in that: the said outer envelope (2) is provided with tearable heat seal (17) along its<br>
four edges, a notch (18) being provided in one of the smaller edges of the envelope to facilitate<br>
tearing; the said inner envelope (1) is provided with pealable heat seal along at least one of the<br>
longer edges; a pair of flaps (7) being provided at one of the smaller edges to facilitate<br>
application of force to peal the said heat seal, the said flaps having pealable heat seal in their<br>
proximity;  the  said inner envelope is provided  along  one  of the  smaller edges with a<br>
passage/cavity (13, 14, 16) with a curved or inclined side such as herein described so as to cause<br>
folding of arms of said contraceptive device (IB) upon application of force, the cavity being<br>
formed by firm heat sealing (12) between the said 2 sheets of the envelope.<br>
In accordance with this invention, the seal of the segment of the packaging adjacent to the horizontal arm is given a special shape. At the centre of the seal zone an unsealed space is left between the two flaps of the packaging. Beyond the space distal to the horizontal arm of the T the seal between the packaging flaps is retained to maintain sterility of the contents . The open space left in the seal area is in the shape of the folded horizontal arms of the T. Therefore even before opening the packaging, simply by pushing the inserter tube against the horizontal arm of the T and in consequence abutting the horizontal arm against the aforesaid open space in the seal, the two segments of the horizontal arm are forced to fold together as they move into the open space in the seal. Thereafter the inserter  tube  can be drawn backwards and  next  pushed<br>
forwards so that the folded horizontal arm move into the inserter tube.<br>
In  the above process the horizontal arm does  not have  to be manipulated and only the inserter tube has to be moved forward, backward and then forward.   Grippping the  inserter  tube within the closed  packaging  is   a simple task.  Since the packaging need not be opened  in<br>
this procedure, there is no chance of contamination of the T.  Requirements of the  no tuuch are   truely met.<br>
The system does not require any additional components beyond those normally provided with the Copper T. Therefore the complexity and additional cost of a special inserter facilitator is eliminated by the present invention. In the present invention the insertion facilitator is inbuilt into the packaging simply by leaving a small space unsealed. No extra devices are required. Hence providing the insertion facilitator does not increase complexity and also does not add to the cost of the Copper T system.<br>
Further objects and advantages of this invention will be more apparent from the ensuing description when read  in conjunction with the accompanying drawings  and<br>
wherein:<br>
Fig.l shows the outer envelope; Fig.2 shows the inner envelope, and Fig.3 shows the assembled package.<br>
Referring to the drawings, the inner envelope 1 and  outer  envelope 2 are   each formed from a  back  and<br>
front sheet 3 for inner envelope 1 and a back and  front<br>
sheet  4 for outer envelope 2.  Each of sheets 3  and  4<br>
are        formed   from   a  laminate   of   polyester   and<br>
polyethylene-     However,   the  laminate  is   not   of<br>
importance  in that any other polymeric material may  be<br>
used to constitute the laminate.<br>
Inner envelope 1 has a peelable heat seal 5  along<br>
at  least  one  of  the vertical  sides,  though  it  is<br>
preferred  to  provide such a peelable heat  seal  along<br>
both  of the vertical sides.  A peelable heat seal 6  is<br>
provided near the proximity of the base of envelope 1 so<br>
as  to form flaps 7.  Thus, in operation,  an  attendant<br>
can  open inner envelope 1 by applying force to flaps  7<br>
which  then  allows  the vertical edges or  sides  5  to<br>
open  and  access  is made to the  device  therein.   As<br>
i apparent from Fig.3,  the Copper T intrauterine device 10<br>
with  the plunger 11 is packed within inner envelope  1.<br>
Though  reference is made hereinabove to a heat seal  7,<br>
any  other means may be used such as to form flaps 7  to<br>
open the base of envelope 1.<br>
Reference is made in particular to the upper end of envelope 1. A firm heat seal 12 is provided at the upper end with a passage or cavity 13. Cavity is formed by a convexity 14 at the lower surface of seal 12, said convexity extending into a concavity 15 at the upper portion of seal 12. Figure 1 illustrates a preferred embodiment of seal 12 with convexity 14 and concavity 15. However, and in accordance with another embodiment, cavity 13 may have inclined surfaces extending downwardly from either sides thereof. A passage 16 is provided in seal 12 for holding one end of plunger 11.<br>
Envelope 2 has tearable heat seals 17 along the four sides. A notch 18 is provided at the base of envelope  2 so that when force is applied  thereto,  the<br>
sides  of  envelope  2 are torn and envelope  1  can  be<br>
i<br>
withdrawn therefrom.<br>
Fig.3 illustrates inner envelope 1 freely disposed within outer envelope 2. However, in practice, inner envelope 1 is disposed in a more raised manner within outer envelope 2 than as illustrated in Fig.3. In practice, upward force is applied to the inserter 18 so that the horizontal arms 19 of the T  are urged  towards<br><br>
cavity 13, and upon further application of force, arms 19 are allowed to fold. Such a force is applied from the outside of outer envelope 2. The configuration of cavity 13 allows a minimal force to be applied to inserter 18 from the outside and without the necessity of opening the package.<br><br><br><br><br>
