BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to the application of a mixture of menthyl lactate,<br>
neomenthol and menthol as cooling agent or flavoring agent. In particular, this<br>
invention relates to a coolant composition comprising menthyl lactate,<br>
neomenthol and menthol having a solidification point below +5°C.<br>
2.	Description of the Prior Art<br>
Menthol is a physiological cooling agent well known to the person skilled in the<br>
art for its analgesic, freshening and flavoring effects on the skin and/or mucous<br>
membranes.<br>
Being a major constituent of peppermint oil, menthol has been used extensively<br>
in foodstuff, beverages, dentifrices, mouthwashes, skin and hair care<br>
preparations, confectionary, tobacco and pharmaceutical products.<br>
A strong initial cooling sensation can be achieved if products containing menthol<br>
are applied to the skin and/or mucous membrane. However, very often there is a<br>
need for products containing a coolant composition in order to provide for a long-<br>
lasting cooling sensation.<br><br>
Menthyl lactate also is an important ingredient that is valued for its cooling<br>
properties. Compared to menthol, one of the advantages of menthyl lactate is its<br>
long-lasting cooling sensation as well as low volatility. However, menthyl lactate<br>
does not produce an initial cooling sensation as strong as menthol.<br>
The disadvantage of an addition of menthyl lactate to products is that it has to be<br>
either melted at a temperature of 50-60°C or dissolved in perfume oils, cosmetic<br>
oils, or glycol solvents such as 1,2-propylene glycol or dipropylene glycol. When<br>
adding menthyl lactate to shampoos, shower gels or foam bath products, it is<br>
advisable to first dissolve it in perfume oil or glycol solvents. The resulting<br>
solution can then be mixed with the surfactants required.<br>
Menthyl lactate is available from Symrise GmbH &amp; Co. KG (Germany) in two<br>
forms, the crystalline and the non-crystalline form:<br>
The non-crystalline form (solidified distillate) has a congealing point of min. 40°C<br>
and an appearance of solid, white substance, while the crystalline form has a<br>
congealing point of min. 42°C and an appearance of white, crystalline powder<br>
(EP 0 794 169). The non-crystalline form has the disadvantage of less<br>
convenient handling because the product has to be melted in order to remove it<br>
from the container, which means that the container has to be heated together<br>
with the product.<br>
The crystalline form has the advantage of easy handling. However, it is not<br>
always convenient or easy to mix the powder into foodstuff, oral care or cosmetic<br>
product bases, which may be in a liquid or a paste-like form. To solve this<br>
problem, the crystals can be solubilized using an acceptable solvent, before<br>
adding the solution to such a product base. However, this solubilization<br>
constitutes an extra processing step for the formulator, making it inconvenient<br>
and more costly to use.<br>
There have been reports in the literature where menthol and menthyl lactate<br>
have been used in the same formulation by adding menthol and menthyl lactate<br><br>
separately. For example, WO 00/42983 describes a cosmetic composition<br>
containing menthol and menthyl lactate, having little odor and being non-irritating.<br>
The composition comprises 0.01% to 2% by weight menthol and 0.1% to 10% by<br>
weight menthyl lactate, the menthol/menthyl lactate ratio lying in the range of 1/1<br>
to 1/10, preferably 1/6 to 1/2, and being such that the odor of the menthol is<br>
barely perceivable, said composition not being irritating, in particular for the<br>
sensitive parts of the human body, while conserving the various beneficial effects<br>
of menthol.<br>
JP 06329528 and JP10231238 relate to cosmetic composition where menthol<br>
and menthyl lactate were used in the same formulation by adding them<br>
separately in a ratio of 1/1 and 2/1, respectively. In JP 06329528, the menthol<br>
and menthyl lactate concentration ranged from 0.1% : 0.1 % (ratio 1:1) to 0.2% :<br>
0.2% (ratio 1:1) in the examples, while it was claimed that the menthol<br>
concentration can be in the range of 0.001-10.0% (w/w) and menthyl lactate can<br>
also be added in the range of 0.001-10.0%. In JP 10231238, it was reported that<br>
0.2% menthol and 0.1% menthyl lactate be used in the same formulation with a<br>
ratio of 2:1.<br>
Attempts to provide liquid mixtures of menthol and menthyl lactate mixtures that<br>
solve the above mentioned problems have been published.<br>
WO 2004/037764 refers to a solution consisting essentially of menthyl lactate<br>
and menthol carboxamide dissolved in a solvent, wherein the final menthyl<br>
lactate concentration is higher than that achievable by dissolving menthyl lactate<br>
in a neat solvent, by a) liquefying menthyl lactate, and b) combining the liquefied<br>
menthyl lactate with menthol carboxamide and the solvent, the solvent being<br>
acceptable for food, oral care or cosmetic use.<br>
US 2004/0018954 discloses mixtures containing menthol and menthyl lactate,<br>
characterized in that it comprises menthol and menthyl lactate in a ratio by weight<br>
in the range of 1:4 to 4:1 and the corresponding crystallization point is below<br>
room temperature of 25°C. Such a composition which is liquid at room<br><br>
temperature was produced by stirring menthol and menthyl lactate in solid form<br>
within the mentioned ratio without heating, i.e. without melting the components.<br>
The lowest crystallization point reported was 8.2°C for a mixture of 50% l-menthol<br>
and 50% l-menthyl l-lactate.<br>
Although US 2004/0018954 states that the term "menthol" and "menthyl lactate"<br>
covers not only all such stereoisomers, but also any racemate or mixture of said<br>
stereoisomers, the authors only investigated and used the common and widely<br>
available commercial products l-menthol and l-menthyl l-lactate.<br>
One main disadvantage of the liquid compositions proposed in the prior art.is that<br>
the solidification points achievable are not low enough to enable storage at<br>
temperatures below +5°C or lower without solidifying, especially not for a<br>
prolonged period of time. From an industrial point of view this disadvantage is<br>
significant since a product, once it has been solidified within a container (typically<br>
barrel or tank), needs to be melted before removal therefrom, which means that<br>
the container has to be heated together with the product with all the<br>
disadvantages outlined above.<br><br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a composition containing<br>
menthyl lactate and menthol that maintains its liquid state at temperatures below<br>
+5°C, preferably without the need of adding a conventional solvent or solubilizer,<br>
which can be added directly in liquid form into a formulation of a product without<br>
the need of heating or melting of said coolant composition prior to addition to said<br>
formulation, being non-irritating and of little odor.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a coolant composition that<br>
combines both a strong initial cooling sensation and a long-lasting cooling<br>
sensation to a product when applied on the skin and/or mucous membrane.<br>
Accordingly, there remains a need to provide menthyl lactate in liquid form, which<br>
is easy to use in further formulations or process operations and which remains<br>
stable in liquid form at temperatures below +5°C, preferably at 0°C or below even<br>
during a prolonged period of storage.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that a (coolant) composition comprising<br>
menthyl lactate and having a solidification point of below + 5°C can be obtained<br>
when menthyl lactate is combined, mixed or co-dissolved with a favourably<br>
(liquid) mixture of neomenthol, menthol and optionally neoisomenthol and/or<br>
isomenthol.<br>
In a first aspect the present invention refers to a (coolant) composition comprising<br>
menthyl lactate, neomenthol and menthol and optionally neoisomenthol and/or<br>
isomenthol having a solidification point below +5°C. The composition of the<br>
invention does not require the addition of a conventional solvent. Typically, the<br><br>
coolant compositions according to the present invention are clear liquid solutions<br>
at temperatures between +5°C and -20°C.<br>
Within the concept of the present invention a method is provided for preparing a<br>
clear liquid solution containing menthyl lactate and menthol, wherein the final<br>
menthyl lactate concentration is higher than that achievable by mixing menthyl<br>
lactate and menthol alone, by combining menthyl lactate and [a (liquid) mixture]<br>
of neomenthol and menthol.<br>
It was also found that a composition according to the present invention provides<br>
both a strong initial cooling sensation and a long-lasting cooling sensation. It has<br>
also been found that the cooling sensation of the (coolant) composition<br>
comprising menthyl lactate, neomenthol and menthol taught herein are often not<br>
merely additive, but a synergistic cooling sensation often were observed.<br>
Thus, the use of the (coolant) compositions comprising menthyl lactate,<br>
neomenthol and menthol as a cooling and/or flavoring agent is a further aspect of<br>
the present invention.<br>
A (coolant) composition of the present invention may be employed in a wide<br>
variety of products for consumption by or application to the human body, e. g.,<br>
foodstuff or oral care products such as toothpastes and mouthwashes, chewing<br>
gums, confectionery, alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, cosmetic and<br>
toiletry products such as shaving products, after-shave products, hair and<br>
skincare products, bath and shower products, face cleansing products,<br>
deodorants and antiperspirants, sun protection and sun tan products, after sun<br>
products, anticellulite/slimming products, make-up products e.g. lip sticks, talcum<br>
powders, fragrances, and other products such as detergents, fabric softeners,<br>
soaps, tobacco products, medicaments etc.<br>
A further aspect of the invention is a product, preferably foodstuff, oral care or<br>
cosmetic product into which has been added an amount of a (coolant)<br>
composition according to the present invention sufficient to provide a cooling<br><br>
effect. Such foodstuff, oral care or cosmetic product may be provided with the<br>
(coolant) composition according to the present invention by any useful method, e.<br>
g., by simple addition to, and mixing into the (foodstuff, oral care or cosmetic)<br>
product bases an effective amount of the coolant composition according to the<br>
present invention.<br>
A method of preparing a product according to the present invention particularly<br>
relevant in practice comprises the following steps:<br>
storing a composition according to the present invention at a temperature<br>
(i) below +5 °C (e. g. in an outside container during wintertime) but (ii) above the<br>
solidification point of said composition,<br>
mixing the composition with components of the product base to form the<br>
product,<br>
wherein said composition is not solidified between storing and mixing.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Unexpectedly, the (coolant) compositions according to the present invention<br>
comprising menthyl lactate, neomenthol, menthol and optionally neoisomenthol<br>
and/or isomenthol have significantly lower solidification points than those<br>
reported in US 2004/0018954 although neomenthol and neoisomenthol and/or<br>
isomenthol have higher melting points than the corresponding menthol-isomer<br>
(vide infra).<br>
Further it was found that (coolant) compositions according to the present<br>
invention comprising menthyl lactate, neomenthol, menthol and optionally<br>
neoisomenthol and/or isomenthol allow more variations regarding the weight<br>
ratios of menthyl lactate and menthol-isomers than indicated in US<br>
2004/0018954.<br><br>
It was further observed that certain mixtures according to the present invention of<br>
menthyl lactate, neomenthol, menthol and optionally neoisomenthol and/or<br>
isomenthol yield a shelf-stable liquid product with a solidification point below -<br>
20°C. A mixture of neomenthol, menthol and optionally neoisomenthol and/or<br>
isomenthol allows dissolution of menthyl lactate in varying amounts, the resulting<br>
composition having a low solidification point as desribed in more detail below.<br>
The general formula for menthyl lactate is shown as follows:<br><br>
Menthyl lactate may be obtained by reacting menthol with lactic acid to form the<br>
corresponding ester. Menthyl lactate contains 4 asymmetrical carbon atoms. It<br>
therefore exists in 16 different stereoisomers, whereas the commonly used ones<br>
(formula la) are made from l-menthol and l-lactic acid or d-lactic acid. L-menthyl I-<br>
lactate (formula (lb)) has a congealing point of 40-42°C and is commercially<br>
available.<br>
Menthol can be obtained naturally from essential oils, e.g. peppermint oil, or can<br>
be of synthetic origin. Menthol contains three asymmetrical carbon atoms.<br>
Therefore exist 8 different stereoisomers comprising menthol, neomenthol,<br>
isomenthol, and neoisomenthol. However, only the l-menthol (i. e. (-)-menthol) of<br>
formula (IIa) has been widely used, and its melting point is 42-43°C.<br><br>
Menthol and its isomers can be illustrated by the following formulas, showing one<br>
enantiomer each of the four diastereomers.<br><br>
The enantiomers (lla) to (lId) and their optical antipodes may, for example, be<br>
obtained by hydrogenation of thymol (e.g. WO 2004/018398 and the references<br>
cited therein) or via cyclization of citronellal to the corresponding isopulegol-<br>
isomers and subsequent hydrogenation. The isomers can be separated via<br>
accurate distillation (for more details on manufacturing and separation of menthol<br>
isomers see "Common Fragrance and Flavor Materials", 4th Edition, Wiley-VCH,<br>
Weinheim 2001, 52-55).<br>
Racemic neomenthol (i.e. a 1:1 - mixture of formula (lIb) and its optical antipode)<br>
has a melting point of about 53°C. It should be mentioned that neomenthol,<br>
regardless its stereoisomeric form, does not exhibit a strong cooling sensation<br><br>
when compared to menthol, in particular when compared to l-menthol. Racemic<br>
and enantiopure neomenthol is commercially available, e.g. from Sigma-Aldrich.<br>
The present invention provides a (coolant) composition with a solidification point<br>
below + 5 °C, the composition comprising a) menthyl lactate, b) neomenthol and<br>
c) menthol, wherein preferably the weight ratio of a) to the sum of b) and c) is in<br>
the range of 6:1 to 1:15 and the weight ratio of b) to c) is in the range 20:1 to<br>
1:10.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the weight ratio of a) to the sum of b) and c) is in the<br>
range of 4:1 to 1:10, more preferred in the range of 2:1 to 1:10 and particularly<br>
preferred in the range of 1:2 to 1:8.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the weight ratio the weight ratio of b) to c) is in the<br>
range of 15:1 to 1:3, more preferred in the range of 10:1 to 1:1 and particularly<br>
preferred in the range of 6:1 to 2:1.<br>
Particularly preferred coolant compositions according to the present invention<br>
comprise menthyl lactate, neomenthol and menthol in a total amount of 80 to<br>
100%, preferably 85 to 100%, by weight, based on the total weight of the coolant<br>
composition according to the present invention.<br>
A (coolant) composition according to the present invention has a solidification<br>
point below +5°C, preferably a solidification point of 0°C or below, more<br>
preferably of -10°C or below.<br>
Preferably in the (coolant) compositions according to the present invention<br>
racemic menthol and/or racemic neomenthol are used.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment a (coolant) composition according to the<br>
present invention comprises neoisomenthol (formula (lId) and/or its enantiomer),<br>
preferably racemic neoisomenthol, in an amount, of up to 10%, preferably 3 to<br>
8%, by weight, based on the total weight of the coolant composition according to<br><br>
the present invention. Racemic neoisomenthol has a melting point of about 52-<br>
53°C.<br>
The following Table 1 indicates solidification points of different mixtures. At 25-<br>
30°C mixtures were prepared by combining and homogenizing the amounts<br>
indicated by weight of l-menthyl l-lactate and racemic neomenthol and/or racemic<br>
menthol. The resulting mixtures were then stored for 48 hours at temperatures of<br>
+4°C, -10°C or -20°C respectively and their solid or liquid state determined<br>
visually.<br><br><br>
Table 1<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment a coolant composition according to the<br>
present invention comprises or essentially consists ( i.e. the sum of menthyl<br>
lactate, neomenthol, menthol, neoisomenthol, and isomenthol used is equal to or<br>
greater than 96%, preferably equal to or greater than 98%, by weight) of<br>
a)	10 - 40%, preferably 10 - 30%, more preferably 10 - 20%, of menthyl lactate,<br>
b)	25 - 75%, preferably 40 - 75%, more preferably 50 - 70%, of neomenthol,<br>
c)	5 - 30%, preferably 10 - 30%, more preferably 10 - 25%, of menthol,<br>
d)	0 -10%, preferably 3 - 8%, more preferably 4 - 7%, of neoisomenthol, and<br>
e)	0 -10%, preferably 0.5 - 3%, more preferably 0.5 - 2%, of isomenthol,<br>
by weight, based on the total weight of the coolant composition according to the<br>
present invention.<br>
According to a further particularly preferred embodiment a coolant composition<br>
according to the present invention further comprises 0.1 - 3%, more preferably<br>
0.5 - 2%, by weight of menthone and/or isomenthone.<br>
Solidification pointsbelow -30°C, were obtained with coolant compositions<br>
comprising l-menthyl l-lactate, racemic neomenthol, racemic menthol and,<br>
optionally, racemic neoisomenthol and/or racemic isomenthol.<br>
The coolant composition of the invention exhibits excellent storage stability. It has<br>
been observed that neither menthyl lactate nor neomenthol nor menthol nor the<br>
optional components neoisomenthol and isomenthol precipitate from the liquid,<br>
even at very low storage temperatures of about -20°C and even at temperatures<br>
of about -30°C. Thus, a coolant composition comprising menthyl lactate,<br>
neomenthol, menthol and optionally neosiomenthol or isomenthol is provided<br>
without having the aforementioned disadvantages of a solid product.<br><br>
Furthermore, due to its liquid form, it is considerably easier to manufacture<br>
products containing the (coolant) compositions according to the present<br>
invention, particularly foodstuff, oral care and cosmetic products, rather than<br>
using a powder or an other solid mass which has to be melted prior to use.<br>
The sensory properties of the different menthol-isomers are described in Rivista<br>
Italiana EPPOS 1995 Special edition, 31.08. - 02.09.1995, 111-115. It is well<br>
known that menthol, most particularly l-menthol, exhibits the strongest and<br>
freshest sensory profile among menthol and its isomers.<br>
The presence of menthol (and the isomers neomenthol and/or neoisomenthol<br>
and/or isomenthol to a smaller extent) in the coolant composition according to the<br>
present invention provides a strong initial cooling sensation, and the menthyl<br>
lactate portion provides the long-lasting cooling sensation. Furthermore,<br>
surprisingly it has been found that the cooling sensation of the coolant<br>
composition according to the present invention comprising menthyl lactate,<br>
neomenthol, menthol and optionally neoisomenthol and/or isomenthol often not<br>
merely reflects the additive effects of the ingredients. Unexpectedly, when<br>
coolant compositions of the present invention were tested by trained panelists in<br>
sensory evaluations against menthyl lactate, neomenthol or menthol individually,<br>
a synergistic cooling sensation was often observed. This surprising synergistic<br>
effect is described in more detail in the examples presented below.<br>
A coolant composition according to the present invention, as a cooling and/or<br>
flavoring agent, has the advantage of providing both a strong initial cooling<br>
sensation as well as a long-lasting cooling sensation.<br>
Coolant compositions according to the present invention are therefore eminently<br>
suitable for incorporation into foodstuff, oral care and cosmetic products in order<br>
to deliver the desired cooling sensation by consumption or application to the<br>
human body.<br><br>
The presence of (racemic) neomenthol in a coolant composition according to the<br>
present invention reduces or even eliminates the harshness caused by menthol,<br>
in particular when using l-menthol, without reducing the overall cooling sensation<br>
when compared to the use of l-menthol alone.<br>
In view of the teaching of the present invention the skilled formulator in the art is<br>
able to adjust an appropriate ratio of menthyl lactate to neomenthol, menthol and<br>
optionally neoisomenthol and/or isomenthol in order to achieve any desired<br>
sensory effect as a matter of routine or by a few routine experiments.<br>
A coolant composition of the present invention may be prepared according to the<br>
following procedure: under stirring solid menthyl lactate is either directly<br>
dissolved in a liquid mixture comprising or consisting of neomenthol, menthol and<br>
optionally neoisomenthol and/or isomenthol or alternatively first liquefied or<br>
melted, typically at a temperature of about 40°C to 50°C, prior to addition to the<br>
liquid mixture of neomenthol, menthol and optionally neoisomenthol and/or<br>
isomenthol. The procedure results in a shelf-stable coolant composition of the<br>
present invention.<br>
Alternatively, the coolant composition of the present invention may be formed by<br>
liquefying or melting menthyl lactate, typically at a temperature of about 40°C to<br>
50°C, and adding neomenthol, menthol and optionally neoisomenthol and/or<br>
isomenthol, preferably in form of a (liquid) mixture, under stirring. The procedure<br>
results in a shelf-stable coolant composition of the present invention.<br>
As stated hereinabove, the (coolant) compositions of the present invention are<br>
provided in a liquid form even below + 5°C that exhibits excellent shelf life with no<br>
precipitation. This major advantage allows storage of the coolant composition<br>
under conditions of varied humidity and temperature e. g. in the range of -20 °C<br>
to 40 °C, makes it easy to handle and to add directly into formulations without<br>
heating, thereby saving time, energy and money. Additionally, the liquid coolant<br>
composition of the present invention can be used for manufacturing products<br>
without heating.Examples of other cooling substances which advantageously can<br><br>
be combined with a coolant composition according to the present invention and<br>
incorporated into products, such as products for direct consumption by or<br>
application to the human body, are, for example, substances having a<br>
physiologically cooling action, that is to say substances which cause an<br>
impression of cold on human skin and/or in the mucous membranes. Suitable<br>
substances having a cooling action are, for example, 1-isopulegol, menthone<br>
glycerol acetal, substituted menthane-3-carboxamides (for example N-<br>
ethylmenthane-3-carboxamide),	2-isopropyl-N,2,3-trimethylbutanamide,<br>
substituted cyclohexanecarboxamides, 3-menthoxy-1,2-propanediol, 2-<br>
hydroxyethylmenthyl carbonate, 2-hydroxypropylmenthyl carbonate, N-<br>
acetylglycine menthyl ester, menthylhydroxycarboxylic esters (for example<br>
menthyl 3-hydroxybutyrate), menthyl monosuccinate, 2-mercaptocyclodecanone,<br>
and menthyl 2-pyrrolidin-5-one carboxylate, l-menthyl methyl ether.<br>
For use in food and oral care products, a coolant composition of the present<br>
invention are favorably employed at levels of 0.01% to 5% by weight, preferably<br>
from 0.05% to 3%, more preferably from 0.1% to 2% by weight, based on the<br>
total weight of the food or oral care product.<br>
For use in cosmetic products, the coolant compositions of the present invention<br>
are favorably employed at levels of 0.01% to 10% by weight, preferably from<br>
0.05% to 5%, more preferably from 0.1% to 2% by weight, based on the total<br>
weight of the cosmetic product. However, it is understood that the skilled person<br>
may employ the inventive coolant compositions in amounts outside the<br>
aforementioned ranges to achieve sensorial effects as desired.<br>
Products in which the coolant composition of the present invention<br>
advantageously may be incorporated are many and varied. These products<br>
include a wide variety of products for consumption by or application to the human<br>
body. The following illustrate the range of products into which coolant<br>
compositions of the present invention can be incorporated: edible or potable<br>
products including alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, confectionery, chewing<br>
gum, ice cream, jellies, cosmetics and toiletries including after shave lotions,<br><br>
shaving soaps, creams and foams; toilet water, deodorants and antiperspirants,<br>
„solid colognes", toilet soaps, bath foams, oils and salts; shower gels, body wash,<br>
hair shampoos, oils, conditioners, tonics, creams, gels and antidandruff<br>
shampoos; talcum powders, face creams, lotions, tonics and gels; hand creams,<br>
hand and boby lotions, anticellulite/slimming creams and lotions, sunscreen<br>
lotions, balms, gels, sprays and creams; after sun lotions, sprays and gels; lip<br>
sticks, cleansing tissues, dentifrices, toothpicks, mouthwashes. Other products<br>
are pharmaceutical products such as antiseptic ointments, liniments and lotions,<br>
cough mixtures, oral analgesic, tobacco preparations, detergents, fabric<br>
softeners, water soluble adhesive products for envelopes, postage stamps,<br>
adhesive labels etc.<br>
The coolant compositions according to the present invention are essentially<br>
insoluble in water. It is therefore preferred to incorporate them into products in a<br>
way so that they remain stably distributed throughout the products. This can be<br>
done by forming a dispersion, emulsion, or microemulsion, with the=compositions<br>
solubilized in a suitable solvent that then becomes part of the dispersion or<br>
emulsion (including microemulsions). Emulsion systems include oil-in-water,<br>
water-in-oil, water-in-oil-in-water, and oil-in-water-in-silicone emulsions. The<br>
emulsions can cover a broad range of consistencies including thin lotions (which<br>
can also be suitable for spray or aerosol delivery), creamy lotions, light creams,<br>
heavy creams, and the like. Suitable solvents for the compositions according to<br>
the present invention include lipophilic or nonpolar solvents such as diethylene<br>
glycol, dipropylene glycol, C1-C6 alcohols, acetone, and other organic solvents,<br>
many of which are also suitable for use as perfume solvents.<br>
Products comprising coolant compositions according to the present invention<br>
can, depending on their formulation, be used, for example, as creams, gels,<br>
lotions, alcoholic and aqueous/alcoholic solutions, emulsions or stick<br>
preparations. These products may also comprise, as further auxiliaries and<br>
additives, mild surfactants, co-emulsifiers, superfafting agents, pearlescent<br>
waxes, bodying agents, thickeners, polymers, silicone compounds, fats, waxes,<br>
stabilizers, biogenic active ingredients, deodorant active ingredients, antidandruff<br><br>
agents, film formers, swelling agents, hydrotropic agents, preservatives, insect<br>
repellants, tanning agents, artificial self-tanning agents (e.g. dihydroxyacetone),<br>
stabilizers, antioxidants, perfume oils, dyes, antimicrobial agents and the like.<br>
The amounts of cosmetic or dermatological auxiliaries and carrier and perfume<br>
which can be used in each case can be determined easily by the person skilled in<br>
the art by simple trial and error, depending on the nature of the product in<br>
question.<br>
A lipid phase of products comprising a coolant composition of the present<br>
invention can advantageously be chosen from the following group of substances:<br>
mineral oils, mineral waxes; oils, such as triglycerides of capric or of caprylic acid,<br>
and also natural oils, such as, for example, castor oil; fats, waxes and other<br>
natural and synthetic fatty substances, preferably esters of fatty acids with<br>
alcohols of low carbon number, e.g. with isopropanol, propylene glycol or<br>
glycerol, or esters of fatty alcohols with alkanoic acids of low carbon number or<br>
with fatty acids; alkyl benzoate; silicone oils, such as dimethylpolysiloxane,<br>
diethylpolysiloxane, diphenylpolysiloxane, and mixed forms thereof.<br>

particular, one or more thickeners which can advantageously be chosen from the<br>
group of silicon dioxide, aluminum silicates, polysaccharides and derivatives<br>
thereof, e.g. hyaluronic acid, xanthan gum, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose,<br>
particularly advantageously from the group of polyacrylates, preferably a<br>
polyacrylate from the group of so-called Carbopols, for example, Carbopol<br>
grades 980, 981, 1382, 2984, 5984, in each case individually or in combination.<br><br>
Cosmetic and/or dermatological products comprising a coolant composition<br>
according to the present invention can have the customary constitution and can<br>
be used to convey a refreshing / cooling sensation to the human body, and also<br>
for the treatment, care and cleansing of the skin and/or of the hair and as a<br>
make-up product in decorative cosmetics. Preference is given to those cosmetic<br>
and dermatological products in the form of a cosmetic product which are used to<br>
convey a refreshing / cooling sensation to the human body, in particular the<br>

The following examples illustrate the various aspects of the present invention.<br>
Unless indicated otherwise all parts, amounts and percentages are by weight.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
A mixture of 76.9 g racemic neomenthol, 14.8 g racemic menthol, 6.6 g racemic<br>
neoisomenthol and 1.7 g racemic isomenthol were stirred resulting in a liquid<br>
mixture (Mix A). Alternatively such a liquid mixture can be obtained via<br>
hydrogenation of thymol (see WO 2004/018398) and subsequent distillation.<br>
25 g of l-menthyl l-lactate were warmed to 45-50°C to liquefy the l-menthyl I-<br>
lactate and added with stirring to 75 g of Mix A.<br>
The resulting clear solution was allowed to cool and then stored at -20°C for 48 h.<br>
No precipitation or solidification was observed.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
A mixture of 67.8 g racemic neomenthol, 25.6 g racemic menthol, 5.6 g racemic<br>
neoisomenthol and 1 g racemic isomenthol were stirred resulting in a liquid<br>
mixture (Mix B). Alternatively such a liquid mixture can be obtained via<br>
hydrogenation of thymol (see WO 2004/018398) and subsequent distillation.<br><br>
15 g of l-menthyl l-lactate were warmed to 45-50°C to liquefy the l-menthyl I-<br>
lactate and added with stirring to 85 g of Mix B.<br>
The resulting clear solution was allowed to cool and then stored at -20°C for 48 h.<br>
No precipitation or solidification was observed.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
A mixture of 50 g racemic neomenthol and 50 g racemic menthol were stirred<br>
resulting in a liquid mixture (Mix C).<br>
25 g of l-menthyl l-lactate were warmed to 45-50°C to liquefy the l-menthyl I-<br>
lactate and added with stirring to 75 g of Mix C.<br>
The resulting clear solution was allowed to cool and then stored at -20°C for 48 h.<br>
No precipitation or solidification was observed.<br>
Comparative Example<br>
To illustrate the solidification / precipitation of l-menthyl l-lactate in racemic<br>
menthol alone, 25 g of l-menthyl l-lactate were liquefied by heating to 45-50°C<br>
and mixed at 45-50°C with 75 g racemic menthol. Upon cooling and storage at<br>
0°C for 8 h the mixture had completely solidified.<br>
According to US 2004/0018954 a mixture consisting of 25 g l-menthyl l-lactate<br>
and 75 g l-menthol has a solidification point of 21.1 °C.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
A sensory test was carried out with a group of 19 trained panelists in order to<br>
evaluate the performance of the coolant composition according to the present<br>
invention of Example 2 consisting of 15% l-menthyl l-lactate, 57.6% racemic<br>
neomenthol, 21.8% racemic menthol, 4.8% racemic neoisomenthol and 0.8%<br>
racemic isomenthol) for topical applications.<br>
The cooling sensation of the coolant composition of Example 2 was tested in<br>
direct comparison to l-menthyl l-lactate. The mixture according to Example 2 and<br>
l-menthyl l-lactate were separately incorporated into samples of an alcohol-free<br>
face lotion at a level of 0.3%, based on the total weight of the face lotion.<br>
Although neomenthol does not have a strong cooling sensation (vide supra) the<br>
panelists found a significantly higher overall cooling sensation and preferred the<br>
cooling sensation of the coolant composition of Example 2 according to the<br>
present invention.<br>
The presented data are average values. The overall cooling sensation was rated<br>
on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very weak; 5 = very strong).<br><br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
A sensory test was carried out with a group of 10 trained panelists in order to<br>
evaluate the performance of the liquid coolant compositions of Examples 1 and 2.<br>
Panelists were asked to assess the intensity of cooling sensation at certain time<br>
periods on a line scale of zero to one hundred. Panelists held toothpaste<br>
containing formulations of Example 1 (0.6% by weight based on total weight of<br>
the toothpaste) and Example 2 (0.6% by weight based on the total weight of the<br>
toothpaste) in their mouths for 90 seconds before spitting and rinsing. Panelists<br>
recorded the cooling sensation at rinse (time zero), 30s, 60s, 90s, 2min, 3min, 4,<br>
min, 5 min, 10 min, 15 min, 20 min, 25 min and 30 min.<br>
Toothpastes containing a coolant composition produced according to Example 1<br>
or Example 2 both outperformed toothpastes containing only menthyl lactate or<br>
containing only racemic neomenthol and/or racemic menthol.<br>
