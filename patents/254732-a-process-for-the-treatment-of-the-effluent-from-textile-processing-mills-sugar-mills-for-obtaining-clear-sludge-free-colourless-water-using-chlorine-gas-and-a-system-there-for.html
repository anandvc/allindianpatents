FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
This invention relates to a novel process for obtaining sludge free treated water from the effluents of textile processing mills, sugar mills and a system therefor.<br>
TITLE OF THE INVENTION:<br>
A Novel Process For Obtaining Sludge Free Treated Water From The Effluents Of Textile Processing Mills, Sugar Mills effluents And A System Therefor.<br>
It is well known that effluent management is an environment problem and there are regulations imposed by the Government for this purpose.<br>
PRESENT ART AND DRAWBACKS:<br>
Presently, the effluents from textile mills, which carry colouring matter and other chemicals, are treated using lime and ferrous sulfate.<br>
Though this process enables obtaining almost clear water, the main draw back is that it produces considerable amount of sludge which can not be disposed off and is to be stored in sealed bags at site after drying the sludge in sand beds.<br>
This results in requirement of waste of useful space and other associated problems.<br>
Further, the equipment and the process require the necessity of large man power and control.<br>
Even then the process is not efficient as it is observed that proper control of feeding lime and ferrous sulfate are difficult.<br>
hi addition to these, the cost treatment, man power and chemicals required make the process uneconomical.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION:<br>
It is therefore a principle object of the invention to propose an alternative process which uses easily available chemical for treating the effluents and obtain sludge free treated water.<br>
Another object is to use such a chemical which can be recovered.-<br>
Another object is to use a chemical which can be controlled effectively.<br><br>
Another object is to which totally eliminates the need for conventional sand beds, large man power and space.<br>
Another object is to propose a system which is very easy to control and operate.<br>
Another object is to propose such a system which can be assembled from indigenously available materials.<br>
These and other objects of the invention will be apparent from the following paragraphs.<br>
BRIEF STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Thus, according to this invention there is provided a process for the recovery of sludge free treated water from the effluents of textile processing mills, sugar mills without production of any sludge which comprises, splitting the effluent water into droplets and subjecting it to contact with finely dispersed chlorine gas, (sparging), allowing the reaction between the effluent and chlorine gas to complete, recovering sludge free water and recycling the chlorine gas into the process.<br>
The effluent is dispersed it into fine droplets and the chlorine gas is also admitted into the dispersed effluent to ensure effective contact with the droplets of effluent for effective chemical reaction.<br>
There is also provided a system for the recovery of sludge free treated water from the effluents of textile processing mills, sugar mills which comprises essentially an effluent collection tank, connected to two treatment tanks inter connected to each other, each tank being provided with a ventury system and chlorine recycling arrangement at the top and a collection tank for collecting the treated almost sludge free water, the first tank having a chlorine feeding appertured pipe arrangement for delivering chlorine gas into the ventury to make intimate contact with the finely dispersed effluent fed into the ventury .<br>
In one embodiment, each ventury is provided with separate feed pump for the effluent where the tanks are connected at their mid portions thereof and in this embodyment each ventury outlet tube extents partly from the top of each tank almost to the middle section of the tank.<br>
In another embodiment, there is provided a sort of siphoning arrangement between the two tanks so that the partly treated effluent from the first tank will flow to the next tank automatically and thus there is only one feed pump to the first tank and in this embodiment the ventury outlet tube extends almost to the bottom of both the tanks from the top of each tank.<br><br>
Each ventury is provided with a separate chlorine flushing arrangement with the respective tank to recycle the chlorine effectively.<br>
The system includes pressure balancing connections where necessary.<br>
Each ventury has at least two spaced apart baffle plates with a plurality of fine holes or appertures<br>
One baffle plate is disposed slightly below the top end while the other baffle plate is disposed slightly above the lower end of the cylindrical portion of the ventury for effectively producing fine droplets of the effluent and the effluent is fed on the top baffle plate.<br>
The first ventuy has a chlorine gas feed pipe from its top end extending below the first baffle plate and having fine holes below the level of the baffle plate, the bottom of the said pipe being sealed.<br>
The chlorine recycle tube or shushing tube is provided below the lower baffle plate of each ventury, preferably in the conical section of the ventury.<br>
The invention will now be more fully described with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DETAILS OF THE DRAWINGS.<br>
Figure 1 shows, briefly in section, details of the conventional system presently in use and process details.<br>
Figure 2 shows, briefly in section, details of one embodiment of the system of the present invention and process details.<br>
Figure 3 shows, briefly in section, details of another embodiment of the system of the present invention and process details.<br>
Figure 4 shows, briefly in section a ventury system used in the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS.<br>
The conventional system shown in figure no 1 is provided with an elongated horizontal tank 1.<br>
There are provided a plurality of baffle plates 2 extending alternately from the top end la and bottom end lb of the tank leaving respective clearance spaces 2a and 2b. Thus, there is created a zigzag path for the effluent to pass through when it is fed fr om the feed end 3.<br><br>
A feed or dosing arrangement 4 is provided at the beginning feed end of the tank for feeding or dosing lime into the stream passing through the tank. Down stream, there is provided a feed arrangement 5 for feeding ferrous sulfate.<br>
The system includes collection tanks 6 for the treated water. The sludge 7 created during the treatment collects at the bottom on the sand beds 6a of the tanks 6 which is periodically removed and dried on sand beds. The dried material is packed in sxiitable bags and stored.<br>
In figure 2, there is shown a pair of treating tanks 8a and 8b inter connected almost at their middle levels 9 by a connecting tube 9a. A feeding arrangement 10a is provided for the effluent from the effluent collection tank 10 to tank 8a. It will be seen that each of the tank is provided with respective ventury arrangement 8c and 8d at their top ends whose lower end of the legs-8cc and 8dd end midway into the respective tanks. Tlie lower end of the second tank 8b is provided with recycle arrangement 10b for the partly treated effluent to the ventury while its top end is provided with treated effluent outlet 11 to the collection tank 12. It will also be noticed that there is provided respective a chlorine gas flushing or recycling arrangements 8e and 8f at the top of the respective tanks.<br>
There is a chlorine feeding pipe 13 at the top of the first tank only as can be clearly seen from figure no 4.<br>
In figure 3 the details are almost the same as in the system of fig 2 except for the following differences.<br>
a.	the lower leg end of each ventury extends up to almost the lower inner<br>
bottom of each tank, b.	the two tanks are inter connected by a sort of siphoning connection 9c.<br>
THE VENTURY SYSTEM:<br>
Each veenturt is provided with a pair of baffle plates 14.15 separated from each other. One baffle plate 14 is provided at near top end T while the second baffle plate 15 is provided near to the bottom end B. Both these baffle plates are provided with a plurality of fine holes or apertures 16 so that the effluent fed at the top baffle plate is converted into a fine stream and falls on the lower baffle plate.<br>
There is provided a chlorine gas feed pipe 13 at the top of the first tank 8a. The lower end 13a of the pipe is closed and its section or portion 13b extending below the top baffle plate is provided with fine holes or apertures 13c in the intervening space between the two baffle plates. The chlorine gas admitted through these apertures has intimate contact with the falling stream and the accumulated effluent 16 of the effluent which action is similar to sparging.<br><br>
The second ventury is different from the first ventury only in respect of the fact that there is no separate chlorine feed to the second veutury except the recycle or flushing of chlorine from the tank to which it is connected. The chlorine flushing tubes 17 and 18 connect the lower conical section of the ventury with the top of the respective tank.<br>
Suitable other alternatives also fall within the scope of the invention.<br>
For example , both venturies can b assembled inside the tanks with suitable fixtures.<br>
This helps in completely concealing th venturies. In such an instant, the flushing arrangement for the chlorine gas will conveniently be located out side the respective tanks.<br>
Any entrapped chlorine gas can be absorbed in an alkaline solution like NaOH.<br>
The details as to how the treatment takes place is explained in the following<br>
pages.<br><br>
CHLORINE;<br>
Chlorine is freely available a is an important chemical. Chlorine reacts with water forming :<br><br>
HOCL is a highly oxidizing compound &amp; is unstable.'©' in HOCL is very active &amp; removes the colour from the effluent water completely.<br><br>
HCl formed in the process is very helpful also. PH of the effluent taken for treatment is around 8 to 8.5, due to soda ash added in the process for dying of cotton cloth. HCl adjust the PH of the treated effluent water to 6 to 7, as required by pollution control Board norms.<br>
So the use of chlorine gas of helps in 2 ways.<br>
1.	Removing the colour from the effluent without generating<br>
any sludge.<br>
2.	Adjusting the PH of the effluent water.<br>
The admission of chlorine gas into the effluent treatment system is shown separately in this sketch, taking all safety precautions required.<br><br>
Quantity of chlorine gas required for treating the effluent can be easily adjusted by a valve provided at the bottom of gas flow meter. Also, a vision glass is provided in the effluent inlet water pipe, for the operator to adjust the dosage of chlorine depending upon the strength of the colour in the water (Dark / light) by watching the flow of water in the vision glass during operation.<br>
The chlorine content in the colourless water discharged from the system is around 25 to 50 PPM. By allowing this water to flow through the existing treatment channel used in the conventional process, considerable chlorine content in the water gets reduced. By giving SMBS (Sodium meta Bi sulphite solution 10 Kgs of SMBS dissolved in 100 Its of water) by means of a dosing pump, the entire chlorine content in the water is completely neutralised, before being discharged outside from the unit.<br><br>
For capacities above 6 lakhs Its. Per day, sintex tanks are not suitable.<br>
For the treatment of higher capacities 10 lakhs, and above, this chlorine systems is suitable, but the tank can be cement tanks (FRP coated inside) design of the venturi is the same, but the dimensions will change to suit the capacity.<br>
This system as shown in the sketchi is specially suited for common effluent treatment plants. (CETP) where these type of plants handle from 20 lakhs Its. Per day to 40 to 50 lakhs Its per day. In this system, members of CETP discharge their effluent and it is collected at CETP for treatment.<br>
In this type of plants, the sludge generated varies from 1 MT to 2 MT per day, depending upon the volume of effluent treated. At CETP, this sludge is accumulated over a period of years, and it is causing a major handling problem for CETP. So this chlorine treatment systems is a boon, as no sludge will be generated and the pffliipnt rhar0ed after the treatment is comoletelv colourless.<br><br>
