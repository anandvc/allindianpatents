				<td>The present invention relates to compositions against wood-destroying insects an insecticidally active compound.<br>
The present invention relates to long-acting compositions against wood-destroying insects, to their preparation and to their use.<br>
It is known that the duration of action of crop protection agents can be extended by binding active compounds chemically to hydroxyl-group-containing wood derivatives such as sawdust, bark or lignin. However, to prepare the appropriate wood derivaÂ¬tive/active compound complexes, complicated chemical reactions were required (Tappi/August 1971, Vol. 54, No. 8 p. 1293-1294; FR-P 1 544 406).<br>
It is furthermore known that the action of insecticides can be extended by applying them to the soil shortly after a fertilization with organic fertilizers such as manure, compost, etc. (Archives of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology (1996) Vol. 31, No. 1 p. 98-106).<br>
Furthermore, it is known that UV-sensitive crop protection agents can be protected against UV-induced degradation by addition of lignin (WO 97/15 187).<br>
Furthermore, it is known that polyoxyalkylene derivatives can be added as stabilizers to certain active compounds from the group of the nicotinoyl insecticides (EP-B 431361).<br>
Also known are baits against soil-dwelling insects, such as termites, which contain culture medium for fungi in addition to active compounds from the group of the nicotinoyl insecticides (ZA-P 94-7242).<br>
For protecting wood-containing materials against destruction by insects, a long-term activity of the active compounds, in particular in the soil, is critical. Frequently, the duration of action of the insecticides employed is, owing to their degradation by soil-dwelling microorganisms, too short for protecting buildings.<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to:<br>
1.	Compositions against wood-destroying insects,  characterized in that they<br>
contain<br>
a)	insecticidally active compounds,<br>
b)	organic  natural   compounds   or   organic   synthetic   compounds   or<br>
mixtures thereof as carrier material,<br>
c)	optionally microbicidally active compounds,<br>
d)	optionally   attractants   or   development-inhibitory   compounds   for<br>
insects,<br>
e)	and optionally formulation auxiliaries.<br><br>
2.	Method for delaying the microbial degradation of active compounds against<br>
wood-destroying insects in soil, characterized in that the active compounds are<br>
mixed with natural organic compounds or synthetic organic compounds,<br>
optionally with microbicidally active compounds, optionally with attractants or<br>
development-inhibitory compounds for insects and optionally formulation<br>
auxiliaries.<br>
3.	Compositions according to 1, characterized in that the insecticidally active<br>
compounds used are one or more active compounds from the group of the<br>
agonists or antagonists of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors of insects.<br>
4.	Compositions according to 1, characterized in that the insecticidally active<br>
compound used is imidacloprid.<br>
5.	Compositions according to 1, characterized in that they are used in the soil for<br>
protecting buildings.<br>
6.	Compositions according to 1, characterized in that they are employed in the<br>
soil for protecting materials and buildings against termites. 7.<br>
form.<br>
Compositions according to 1, characterized in that they are packaged in water-soluble polymer films, paper films or paper tubes and employed in packaged form.<br><br>
8.	Compositions according to 7, characterized in that after packaging they are in<br>
the form of tubes, sausages, bags, pillows, mats, blocks, ropes or cylinders.<br>
9.	Compositions according to 1, characterized in that the carrier material has a<br>
particle size of up to 0.2 mm, that the compositions are suspended in water<br>
prior to use and applied to the soil or buildings as a suspension, or mixed with<br>
foaming agents and applied to the soil or buildings as a foam.<br>
10.	Compositions according to 1, characterized in that the carrier material has a<br>
particle size of 0.2 mm to 10 mm and is scattered onto the soil or incorporated<br>
into the soil.<br>
The compositions according to the invention contain one or more agrochemical insecticidally active compounds.<br>
The insecticides include agonists or antagonists of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors of insects, phosphorus-containing compounds such as phosphoric or phosphonic esters, natural and synthetic pyrethroids, carbamates, amidines, juvenile hormones and juvenile hormone-like substances.<br>
Agonists or antanogists of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors of insects are known, for example, from European Offenlegungsschriften Nos. 580 553, 464 830, 428 941, 425 978, 386 565, 383 091, 375 907, 364 844, 315 826, 259 738, 254 859, 235 725, 212 600, 192 060, 163 855, 154 178, 136 636, 303 570, 302 833, 306 696, 189 972, 455 000, 135 956, 471 372, 302 389; German Offenlegungsschriften Nos. 3 639 877, 3 712 307; Japanese Offenlegungsschriften Nos. 03 220 176, 02 207 083, 63 307 857, 63 287 764, 03 246 283, 04 9371, 03 279 359, 03 255 072; US Patents Nos.<br>

In the present context, industrial materials are to be understood as meaning non-living materials, such as, preferably, plastics, adhesives, glues, papers and cardboards, leather, wood and timber products and paints.<br>
i The material to be protected against, infestation by insects is very particularly preferably    j<br>
wood and timber products, and also wood-containing buildings or parts of buildings.<br>
Wood and timber products which can be protected by the composition according to the invention or by mixtures comprising this composition are, for example: construction timber, wooden beams, railway sleepers, bridge components, jetties, wooden vehicles, boxes, pallets, containers, telephone poles, wood cladding, wooden windows and doors, plywood, particleboard, joinery articles, or wood products which, quite generally, are used in the construction of houses or boats or in joinery.<br>
Carrier materials used for the compositions according to the invention are natural organic compounds or synthetic organic compounds. Examples thereof which may be mentioned are porous organic carriers, such as sawdust, wood slivers or shavings, ground or chipped tree bark or tree bark slivers or shavings, peat, lignin, coconut fiber and coconut meal and sugar beet pulp residues.<br>
The particle size of the carrier material is  10 mm maximum. The compositions ' according to the invention are then applied dry or packaged in biodegradable or water-soluble films or paper.<br>
The carrier material preferably has a particle size of up to 0.2 mm. The compositions according to the invention are then applied dry or packaged in biodegradable films or paper. However, they can also be suspended in water or applied to the soil, for example along or under base walls, foundations and stone or concrete ceilings of buildings, using foaming agents and appropriate sprayers or pumps. Compositions with a particle size of 0.2 to 10 mm can be scattered onto the soil or incorporated into the soil, or in the case of fiberous material, applied as mats or imbeded in sheets of water soluble and/or biodegradable plastic.<br>
The compositions or concentrates according to the invention comprise active compound in a concentration of 0.0001 to 95% by weight, in particular 0.001 to 60% by weight.<br>
The amount of the compositions employed depends on the species and the occurrence of the insects and the medium. The optimum application rate can be determined upon use in each case by test series. In general, however, it is sufficient to employ 0.0001 to 20% by weight, preferably 0.001 to 10% by weight, of the active compound, based on the material to be protected.<br>
The compositions according to the invention may contain formulation auxiliaries. Formulation auxiliaries which may be mentioned are solvents and/or diluents, emulsifiers or wetting agents, binders, fixing agents or plasticizers.<br>
The solvents and/or diluents used are organochemical solvents or solvent mixtures and/or oily or oil-type organochemical solvents or solvent mixtures of low volatility and/or polar organochemical solvents or solvent mixtures and/or water and, if appropriate, emulsifiers and/or wetting agents.<br>
Organochemical solvents which are preferably employed are oily or oil-type solvents having an evaporation number of above 35 and a flashpoint of above 30Â°C, preferably above 45Â°C. Substances which are used as such oily and oil-type solvents which have low volatility and are insoluble in water are appropriate mineral oils or their aromatic fractions, or mineral-oil-containing solvent mixtures, preferably white spirit, petroleum and/or alkylbenzene.<br>
Substances which are advantageously used are mineral oils with a boiling range of 170 to 220Â°C, white spirit with a boiling range of 170 to 220Â°C, spindle oil with a boiling range of 250 to 350Â°C, petroleum or aromatics of boiling range 160 to 280Â°C, essence of turpentine and the like.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, liquid aliphatic hydrocarbons with a boiling range of 180 to 210Â°C or high-boiling mixtures of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons with a boiling range of 180 to 220Â°C and/or spindle oil and/or monochloronaphthalene, preferably oc-monochloronaphthalene, are used.<br>
The organic oily or oil-type solvents of low volatility having an evaporation number of above 35 and a flashpoint of above 30Â°C, preferably above 45Â°C, can be partially replaced by organochemical solvents of high or medium volatility, with the proviso that the solvent mixture also has an evaporation number of above 35 and a flashpoint of above 30Â°C, preferably above 45 Â°C, and that the insecticide/fungicide mixture is soluble or emulsifiable in this solvent mixture.<br>
hi a preferred embodiment, part of the organochemical solvent or solvent mixture or an aliphatic polar organochemical solvent or solvent mixture is replaced. Substances which are preferably used are aliphatic organochemical solvents having hydroxyl and/or ester and/or ether groups, such as, for example, glycol ethers, esters and the like.<br>
The organochemical binders used are the synthetic resins and/or binding drying oils which are known per se and can be diluted with water and/or are soluble or dispersible or<br>
emulsifiable in the organochemical solvents employed, in particular binders composed of; or comprising, an acrylate resin, a vinyl resin, for example polyvinyl acetate, polyester resin, polycondensation or polyaddition resin, polyurethane resin, alkyd resin or modified alkyd resin, phenol resin, hydrocarbon resin, such as indene/coumarone resin, silicone resin, drying vegetable and/or drying oils and/or physically drying binders based on a natural and/or synthetic resin.<br>
The synthetic resin used as the binder can be employed in the form of an emulsion, dispersion or solution. Up to 10% by weight of bitumen or bituminous substances can also be used as binders. In addition, colorants, pigments, water repellents, odor-masking substances and inhibitors or anticorrosives known per se and the like can also be employed.<br>
The composition or the concentrate preferably comprises at least one alkyd resin or modified alkyd resin and/or a drying vegetable oil as the organochemical binder. Preferably used according to the invention are alkyd resins with an oil content of over 45% by weight, preferably 50 to 68% by weight.<br>
All or some of the above-mentioned binder can be replaced by a fixative (mixture) or a plasticizer (mixture). These additives are intended to prevent volatilization of the active compounds and crystallization or precipitation. They preferably replace 0.01 to 30% of the binder (based on 100% of the binder employed).<br>
The plasticizers are from the chemical classes of the phthalic esters, such as dibutyl phthalate, dioctyl phthalate or benzylbutyl phthalate, the phosphoric esters, such as tributyl phosphate, the adipic esters, such as di-(2-ethylhexyl) adipate, the stearates, such as butyl stearate or amyl stearate, the oleates, such as butyl oleate, the glycerol ethers or relatively high-molecular-weight glycol ethers, glycerol esters and p-toluenesulfonic esters.<br>
Fixatives are chemically based on polyvinyl alkyl ethers, such as, for example, polyvinyl methyl ether, or ketones, such as benzophenone or ethylene benzophenone.<br>
A particularly useful solvent/diluent is water, if appropriate as a mixture with one or more of the abovementioned organochemical solvents/diluents, emulsifiers and dispersants.<br>
The compositions according to the invention are prepared, for example, by mixing the active compounds together as powders or by dissolving them in suitable solvents, adding formulation auxiliaries and admixing the carrier substances. The components may be added in any order.<br>
The water-soluble polymer films mentioned for use as packaging are known. They are films made of polyvinyl alcohol polymers, for example ethylenephenyl alcohol.<br>
The compositions are packaged in the form of tubes which may optionally be segmented. The diameter of the tubes is from 1 to 20 cm, preferably 2 to 10 cm. The length of the segments is from 5 to 30 cm, preferably 10 to 20 cm.<br>
The compositions may also be packaged, for example, in bags.<br>
In the case of adsorption onto or into coconut fibers, application may be carried out as a rope, as woven mats or in the form of loose fibers or as a powder.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
