DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Compounds of this invention can exist as one or more stereoisomer. The various stereoisomers include enantiomers, diastereomers and geometric isomers. One skilled in the an will appreciate that one stereoisomer may be more desirable and how to separate said<br>
stereoisomers. Accordingly, the present invention comprises mixtures, individual stereoisomers, and optically active mixtures of compounds of Formulae I. II and IVa.<br>
In the above recitations, the term "alkyl", used either alone or in compound words such as "alkylthio" or "haloalkyl" includes straight-chain or branched alkyl, such as, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, i-propyl, or the different butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, or decyl isomers. The term "1-2 alkyl" indicates that one or two of the available positions for that substituent may be alkyl which are independently selected. "Alkenyl" includes straight-chain or branched alkenes such as vinyl, 1-propenyl, 2-propenyl, and the different butenyl, pentenyl and hexenyl isomers. "Alkenyl" also includes polyenes such as 1,2-propadienyl and 2,4-hexadienyl. "Alkynyl" includes straight-chain or branched alkynes such as ethynyl, 1-propynyl, 2-propynyl and the different butynyl, pentynyl and hexynyl isomers. "Alkynyl" can also include moieties comprised of multiple triple bonds such as 2,5-hexadiynyl. "Cycloalkyl" includes, for example, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, and cyclohexy Examples of "cycloalkylalkyl" include cyclopropylmethyl, cyclopentylethyl, and other cycloalkyl moieties bonded to straight-chain or branched alkyl groups.<br>
The term "halogen" includes fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine.<br>
The total number of carbon atoms in a substituent group is indicated by the "C1-C3" prefix where i and j are numbers from 1 to 10. For example, C1-C3 alkyl designates methyl through propyl; and C4 alkyl designates the various isomers of an alkyl group containing a total of four carbon atoms.<br>
When a group contains a substituent which can be hydrogen, for example R3 or R4, then, when this substituent is taken as hydrogen, it is recognized that this is equivalent to said group being unsubstituted.<br>
Compounds of this invention may also exist as a mixture of tautomers. For example, a compound of Formula Ila may exist in one or both of the tautomeric forms illustrated below.<br>
One skilled in the art will appreciate that one tautomer may predominate over the other. The present invention comprises both tautomeric forms as well as mixtures thereof of compounds of Formulae Ila and lie.<br>
The processes of the present invention and methods for the preparation of compounds of Formula I, Formula II (see Schemes 1, 2, and 5), Formula nia (see Scheme 16), and<br>
Formula IVa (see Scheme 18) are described below. One skilled in the art will recognize when the order of addition of reagents is important in the processes of this invention.<br>
Of note are processes wherein R1 is C1-C10 alkyl, C3-C10 alkenyl, C4-C10 cycloalkylalkyl, C4-C10 halocycloalkylalkyl, or C3-C10 alkynyl; and R2 is C1-CI0 alkyl, C3-C]0 alkenyl, C4-C10 cycloalkylalkyl or C3-C10 alkynyl. Preferred processes include processes (A-E) to prepare compounds of Formula I wherein R1 is C1-C3 alkyl, R2 is C1-C3 alkyl, R3 is Br or I, and R4 is H, Br or I. Process A- beginning with anthranilates of Formula la or aminobenzamides of Formula 3<br>
Compounds of Formula I can be prepared by Process A illustrated, in Schemes 1-3. The 2-thioquinazolinedione of Formula Ha may be prepared by condensing an anthranilic acid (2-aminobenzoic acid) of Formula la with an isothiocyanate of Formula 5 in the presence of a base as illustrated in Scheme 1. <br>
la<br>
Only one equivalent of the isothiocyanate is required; however, excess reagent can be used. The reaction is run in a solvent such as dimethylacetamide, cyclohexane, hexane, methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, i-propanol, chloroform, 1,2-dichloroethane, N,N-dimethylformamide, ethyl acetate, n-propyl acetate, i-propyl acetate, diethoxymethane, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, toluene, water or xylene. Alcohol, ester and aromatic solvents such as ethanol, propanol, n-propyl acetate and xylene are preferred. The reaction temperature is from about 60 to 150°C. The preferred temperature range is from about 75 to 145°C.<br>
The base accelerates the reaction and improves the solubility of the anthranilic acid in the solvent. One equivalent of base is generally used. Use of less than one equivalent leads to longer reaction times. Greater than one equivalent offers no advantage. Suitable bases include trialkylamine bases such as trimethylamine, triethylamine, tripropylamine, tributylamine and N,N-diisopropylethylamine, as well as inorganic bases such as sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide.<br>
The reaction is conducted by combining the base, isothiocyanate, and anthranilic acid in a solvent and heating at atmospheric pressure. If desired, the isothiocyanate can be prepared directly in the reaction vessel prior to the addition of the anthranilic acid. The<br>
isothiocyanate can be isolated and purified prior to use but it is not necessary. For example, the isothiocyanate can be prepared by combining carbon disulfide, a metal hydroxide such as potassium hydroxide, and a primary amine, and heating at 30-100°C for 30 min to 2 h. Water is one of many suitable solvents for this reaction. An alkyl chloroformate is then added. The resulting isothiocyanate can be isolated by phase separation or distillation, or combined directly with a base and an anthranilic acid as described above to give the 2-thioquinazolinedione. Alternatively, the isothiocyanate can be added to the hot reaction mixture, or the reaction can be run in a sealed vessel at a pressure of about 1 to 5 atmospheres (1.013 X 105 to 5.065 X 105 Pa). If desired a water-immiscible solvent is used, the water generated in the reaction can be removed using a Dean-Stark trap. The 2-thioquinazolinedione precipitates from the reaction mixture as it forms. After Keating for about 1 to 48 h, the reaction mixture is cooled and filtered. The product is dried, or the wetcake can be used directly in the next step if the solvent is compatible with.the reaction conditions in the following step.<br>
Alternatively, 2-thioquinazolinediones of Formula Ha can be prepared by reacting aminobenzamides of Formula 3 with carbon disulfide as depicted in Scheme la.<br>
Scheme la<br>
Similar transformations are known in the art (Mizuno, et. al., Chemistry Express, (1991), 6, 439). The reaction may be conducted using a variety of solvents and bases. Suitable solvents for this transformation include (but are not limited to) methanol, ethanol, i-propanol, chloroform, 1,2-dichloroethane, N,N-dimethylforrnamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, ethyl acetate, n-propyl acetate, i-propyl acetate, diethoxymethane, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, toluene, xylene, hexanes, and cyclohexanes. Suitable bases for this transformation include (but are not limited to) l,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU), 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO), l,5-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-5-ene (DBN), trimethylamine, triethylamine, tripropylamine, tributylamine, N,N-diisopropylamine, 4-dimethylaminopyridine, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, and potassium carbonate. Effective amounts of base can range from 0.5-5.0 molar equivalents with respect to aminobenzamide 3. Although reaction concentrations from about 0.2M-2.0M (with respect to aminobenzamide 3) may be employed in conjunction with 1.0-20 molar equivalents of carbon disulfide (with respect to aminobenzamide 3), conditions favoring<br>
 greater reaction concentration and fewer molar equivalents of carbon disulfide are preferred. the reaction may be conducted at temperatures from about 40°C-200°C for about 0.5h-24h, and workup is achievable by acidification and filtration of the reaction mixture to obtain precipitated IIa.<br>
Aminobenzamides of Formula 3 are accessible from isatoic anhydrides of Formula 2 through contact with amines of Formula 6 (Scheme 2).<br>
Methods for the preparation of isatoic anhydrides are well-known in the literature. G, M. Coppola in Synthesis, (1980), 505 reviews their preparation and discusses their conversion to aminobenzamides (also see Staiger and Wagner in J. Org. Chem., (1953), 18, 1427).<br>
Process A further involves treatment of the 2-thioquinazolinedione of Formula IIa with phosgene in an inert solvent to give the 2-chloro-4(3H)-quinazolinone of Formula IIb<br>
(Scheme 3).<br>
Scheme 3<br>
+ COCb<br>
Ila<br>
lib<br>
Only one equivalent of phosgene is required, however excess reagent can be used. In addition, a catalyst such as dimethylformamide or dimethyl acetamide may be employed. The reaction is run in an inert solvent such as 1,2-dichloroethane, ethyl acetate, n-propyl acetate, i-propyl acetate, acetonitrile, toluene, xylene or dioxane. Ester solvents such as n-propyl acetate and aromatic solvents such as xylene are preferred. The reaction mixture is heated at about 50 to 120°C for 15 minutes to 6 h or until the 2-thioquinazolinedione is consumed. The preferred temperature is from about 75 to 115°C.<br>
The reaction is conducted by combining the 2-thioquinazolinedione and the solvent and heating. The phosgene is then introduced. Alternatively, the phosgene can be added at room temperature and the reaction mixture is then heated. The reaction can also be run under pressure with a relief valve to vent the carbonyl sulfide and hydrogen chloride generated as by-products. The 2-chloro-4(3H)-quinazolinone is isolated by evaporation of the solvent and is generally of sufficient purity to be used directly in the next step.<br>
Alternatively, the solution or slurry of product can be used directly in the next step with or without first removing the excess phosgene by distillation or sparging with an inert gas such as nitrogen.<br>
The final step in Process A is treatment of the 2-chloro-4(3H)-quinazolinone of Formula lib with a metal alkoxide of Formula M+(-OR2), wherein M is lithium, sodium or potassium, in an inert solvent to give the quinazolinone of Formula I (Scheme 4).<br>
+ M+(-0R2)<br>
The metal alkoxide is generated by treatment of the alcohol of Formula R2OH with a base such as sodium or potassium metal, or sodium or potassium hydride. The alkoxide can also be generated in situ from the alcohol and lithium, sodium, or potassium hydroxide with or without removal of the water by distillation. In general, the metal alkoxide is generated in the alcohol solvent and used as a solution. Whether the metal alkoxide is preformed or generated in situ, preferably M is sodium or potassium and R2 is propyl. Preferred reagerus include sodium propoxide and potassium propoxide. Only one equivalent of the metal alkoxide is required for the reaction, however excess reagent can be used.<br>
Various solvents can be used for the displacement reaction including methanol. ethanol, n-propanol, i-propanol, methylene chloride, 1,2-dichloroethane, N,N-dimethyl-formamide, ethyl acetate, n-propyl acetate, i-propyl acetate, diethoxymethane, dimethoxy-ethane, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, toluene, or xylene. If an ester or alcohol solvent is used, it is desirable to match the alkoxide with the ester group or alcohol to avoid the formation of a mixture of products. Ester solvents such as n-propyl acetate and aromatic solvents such as xylene are preferred.<br>
The reaction is run by adding the metal alkoxide to the 2-chloro-4(3H)-quinazolincne in a solvent at a temperature from about -30 to 50°C. Alternatively, the 2-chloro-4(3HV quinazolinone can be added to a solution of the metal alkoxide. The preferred reaction temperature is from about -10 to 25°C. The reaction mixture is agitated for 5 minutes to 6 hours or until the 2-chloro-4(3H)-quinazolinone is consumed. If desired, the reaction can also be run under 1 to 5 atmospheres of pressure. After the reaction is complete, the metal chloride salt is removed by washing with water, and the solvent is evaporated to afford the compound of Formula I.<br><br>
Process B- beginning with Compounds of Formula 2 or lb<br>
Compounds of Formula I can also be prepared by Process B illustrated in Schemes 2, 5 and 6. As indicated above, an isatoic anhydride of Formula 2 may be contacted with a primary amine of Formula 6 to form the aminobenzamide of Formula 3 (see Scheme 2). Treatment of the aminobenzamide with phosgene affords the 2,4-(lH,3H)-quinazolinedione of Formula lie (Scheme 5).<br>
Only one equivalent of phosgene is required, however excess reagerit has no adverse effect on the reaction. The reaction is run in a solvent such as ethyl acetate, propyl acetate, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, toluene, or xylene. Dioxane is preferred;. The temperature for the reaction is from about 20 to 120°C. The preferred temperature range is 75 to 110°C. After the reaction is complete, the product can be isolated by cooling and filtration, or by dilution with water and filtering if a water-miscible solvent is used. If the quinazolinedione of Formula IIc is not a solid at room temperature, it can be isolated from the reaction mixture by evaporation of the solvent.<br>
As illustrated in Scheme 6, the 2,4-(lH,3H)-quinazolinedione of Formula He is convened to the 4(3H)-quinazolinone of Formula I by treatment with an alkylating agent (R2-Z) such as an R2-iodide, -bromide, -chloride, -alkyl sulfonate [R2OS(O)2(CrC3 alkyl)], -aryl sulfonate [R2OS(O)2(tolyl) or R2OS(O)2(phenyl)], sulfate (R2OS(O)2OR2), or oxonium tetrafluoroborate [(R2)3OBF4].<br>
Alkylating agents known to give primarily 0- vs. N-alkylation are preferred such as dialkyl sulfates and trialkyloxonium tetrafluoroborates. In all cases other than the trialkyloxonium tetrafluoroborates, a base is added to the reaction. Potassium bases such as potassium hydride, potassium carbonate, and potassium hydroxide are preferred. The<br><br><br>
 seaction is run in an inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or methylene chloride at a temperature from about 25 to 110°C.<br>
Alternatively, 2,4-(lH,3H)-quinazolinediones of Formula IIc can be prepared by contacting and heating an isotoic anhydride of Formula 2 with a symmetrical N,N"-dialkylurea of formula R1NHC(O)NHR1 in amide solvents like dimethylacetamide (Scheme 2a).<br>
Alternatively, 2,4-(lH,3H)-quinazolinediones of Formula He can be prepared by methods utilizing acid or ester intermediates of the Formula 8 (Scheme 7). Compounds of Formula 8 may be synthesized by reaction of a suitable anthranilic acid or ester of Formula lb with isocyanates of Formula 7. The starting anthranilic acids and esters of Formula lb and isocyanates of Formula 7 are well-documented in the literature and are easily accessed by one skilled in the art. The reaction of the materials of Formula lb and 7 can be conducted in a variety of solvents such as ethanol, petroleum ether, acetonitrile, N,N-dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, and tetrahydrofuran, in the presence of a basic catalyst at temperatures ranging from ambient to 200°C for about 0.5 to 96 h. Examples of similar transformations can be found in J. Org. Chem., (1961) 26, 5238.<br>
Alternatively, acids of Formula 8a (compounds of Formula 8 wherein R6=H) can be prepared by reacting anhydrides of Formula 2 with an amine of Formula 6 as described in J. Org. Chem., (1953) 18,1427 (Scheme 8). The isatoic anhydrides of Formula 2 are accessible using any of the known means described in the art {e.g.- J. Org. Chem., (1976) 11, 2070). The reaction may be carried out in water, aqueous ethanol, or ethylene glycol at temperatures ranging from about ambient to 150°C for 0.25 to 24 h. Purification and separation can be achieved by diluting the reaction mixture with water, acidifying, and filtering to provide compounds of Formula 8a.<br>
Conversion of compounds of Formula 8 to materials of Formula IIc can be accomplished by heating compounds of Formula 8 either neat or in a suitable solvent at temperatures ranging from about 30 to 220°C for about 0.25 to 24 h optionally in the presence of an acid or base (Scheme 9). Examples of suitable solvents include etjjanol, water, N,N-dimethylformamide, acetonitrile, dimethylsulfoxide, dimethylacetamide, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane. Examples of optional acids include aqueous HC1 or H2SO4. Examples of optional bases include sodium hydroxide or trie thy lamine. Forexamples of similar cyclizations, see J. Org. Chem., (1961) 26, 5238, J. Heterocyclic Chem., (1982) 19, 269 and J. Org. Chem., (1953) 18,1427. The isolated products may be obtained by cooling and filtration from the reaction medium, or by concentration and/or trituration with an alcoholic solvent.<br>
A preferred, single-vessel method for preparing compounds of Formula IIc comprises reacting compounds of Formula lb with isocyanates of Formula 7 in a suitable solvent as described in Scheme 10, followed by distillation of the solvent and heating of the neat residue at temperatures ranging from about 150 to 250°C for about 0.25 to 24 h. Trituration of the cooled reaction mass with alcohol and/or ether solvents delivers the purified material<br>
of Formula IIc.<br>
Scheme 10<br>
Process C- beginning with Compounds of Formula IIc<br>
Compounds of Formula I can also be prepared by Process C illustrated in Schemes 1 and 12.<br>
A 2-thioquinazolinedione of Formula IIa described in Process A above is contacted with an alkylating agent to form the 2-alkylthio-4(3H)-quinazolinone of Formula IId (Scheme 11). Suitable alkylating agents (R5-Z) include alkyl iodides [(C1-C6 alkyl)-I], alkyl bromides [(C1-C6 alkyl)-Br], alkyl chlorides [(C1-C6 alkyl)-Cl], dialkyl/sulfates [(C1C6 alkyl)2SO4]) and alkyl sulphonates [(C1-C6 alkyl)OS(O)2CH3, (C1-C6 alkyl)OS(0)2(tolyl) or (C1-C6 alkyl)OS(O)2(phenyl)]. A base can be used in the reaction. Inorganic bases such as potassium carbonate and sodium hydride are preferred. The reaction is run in an inert solvent at about -10 to 60°C. Suitable solvents include ethers such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran and dioxane, ketones such as acetone and ethyl methylketone, and esters such as ethyl and propyl acetate, aromatic hydrocarbons such as xylene, aliphatic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane and hexane, and amides such as dimethylacetamide and dimethylformamide. After the reaction is complete, the product can be isolated by washing with water and evaporation of the organic solvent. The product is usually of sufficient purity to be used directly in the next step. In some instances, isolation of the product is not necessary and the reaction mixture containing the 2-alkylthio-4(3H)-quinazolinone can be used directly in the next step.<br>
The 2-alkylthio-4(3H)-quinazolinone of Formula IId is converted to the 4(3H)-quinazolinone of Formula I by treatment with a metal alkoxide of Formula M+(~0R2) wherein M is lithium, sodium or potassium in an inert solvent (Scheme 12).<br>
The metal alkoxide is generated as described above in Process A by treatment of the corresponding alcohol with a base such as sodium or potassium metal, sodium or potassium hydride, or sodium or potassium hydroxide. Only one equivalent of the metal alkoxide is required for the reaction; however, excess reagent can be used. Preferably, M is sodium or potassium and R2 is propyl (i.e., sodium or potassium propoxide is employed).<br>
Various solvents can be used including methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, i-propanol, methylene chloride, 1,2-dichloroethane, N,N-dimethylformamide, ethyl acetate, n-propyl acetate, i-propyl acetate, diethoxymethane, dimethoxyethane, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, toluene, or xylene. If an ester or alcohol solvent is used, it is desirable to match the alkoxide with the ester group or alcohol to avoid the formation of a mixture of products. Ester solvents such as n-propyl acetate and aromatic solvents such as xylene are preferred.<br>
The reaction is performed by adding the metal alkoxide to the 2-alkylthio-4(3H)-quinazolinone in a solvent at a temperature at about -30 to 50°C. Alternatively, the 2-alkylthio-4(3H)-quinazolinone can be added to a solution of the metal alkoxide. The preferred reaction temperature is from about -10 to 25°C. The. reaction mixture is agitated until the 2-alkylthio-4(3H)-quinazolinone is consumed. If desired, the reaction can be run under 1 to 5 atmospheres (1.013 X 105 to 5.065 X 105 Pa) of pressure. After the reaction is complete, the metal alkylthiolate is removed by washing with water, and the solvent is evaporated to afford the compound of Formula I. Process D- beginning with Compounds of Formula 1b<br>
Compounds of Formula I may be prepared by the sequence beginning with the reaction of the isothiocyanates of Formula 5 with alcohols of Formula 9 to produce intermediates of Formula 10.<br>
Isothiocyanates of Formula 5 are well-known in the art and can be prepared from the corresponding amines by treatment with thiophosgene (see e.g., J. Heterocycl. Chem., (1990) 27, 407). The conversion of isothiocyanates of Formula 5 to products of Formula 10 has been cited in the art as well (J. Econ. Entomol, (1985)75, 599). The reaction requires prolonged heating of equimolar amounts of an isothiocyanate and alcohol in an inert solvent at elevated temperatures in a pressure bomb apparatus. A preferable alternative for preparing compounds of Formula 10 from isothiocyanates 5 involves reacting the isothiocyanates in neat alcohols of Formula 9 at temperatures ranging from about 50 to 200°C for about 0.5 to 24 h. Following concentration under reduced pressure, the crude material 10 may be purified by distillation at reduced pressure and/or silica gel<br>
chroinatography; however, crude material of Formula 10 may be carried on without further purification. Materials of Formula 10 are well-known in the art and the skilled practitioner realizes that these compounds can also be prepared by other established means (see JP5,139,901=G4, 119: 154014v; Yakhak Hoe Chi, (1982), 26, 91=CA, 97:162320; DE 2353976=CA, 83:78658; Chem. Zvesti, (1969) 23, 736=CA, 73:98568).<br>
Conversion of the compounds of Formula 10 to intermediates of Formula 11 can be accomplished by reacting the compounds of Formula 10 (or anions thereof) with various alkylating agents in suitable solvents at ambient temperatures (Scheme 14). For example, the alkylating agents (R5)3O+BF4- are generally used in halocarbon or hydrocarbon solvents, (R5)2SO4 in halocarbon, ether, or hydrocarbon solvents, and R5-Y (where Y is I,/Br, Cl) in alcohol, ether, halocarbon, hydrocarbon, amide, or sulfoxide solvents. Examples of bases which may be employed to optionally generate the anion of compounds of Formula 10 include NaH, NaOR2, and K2CO3. <br>
The reaction may be conducted for about 0.5 to 24 h at temperatures ranging from about ambient to 100°C. The mixture may then be subjected to aqueous extraction and concentration under reduced pressure to deliver the crude product of Formula 11 which may be suitable for further transformations. Additional purification, however, may be achieved by distillation at reduced pressure and/or silica gel chromatography.<br>
Reaction of the intermediates of Formula 11 with compounds of Formula lb yields the targeted compounds of Formula I (Scheme 15).<br>
Scheme 15<br>
The reaction is conducted in the optional presence of a base (e.g.- Et3N) in an alcohol, ether, or hydrocarbon solvent at temperatures ranging from about 25 to 200°C for about 0.5 to 48 h.<br><br>
 Purification of the final products of Formula I can be accomplished by silica-gei chromatography and/or recrystallization.<br>
A preferable alternative for preparing compounds of Formula I from the isothiocyanates of Formula 5 involves the single-vessel preparation and utilization of compounds of Formula 11. The single-vessel preparation of materials similar to compounds of Formula 11 from isothiocyanates such as 5 and alkylating agents R5-Y has been documented in the art (J. Am. Chem. Soc, (1983) 705, 6985 and Ann. Chem., (1980) 11; 1751). Thus, reaction of isothiocyanates 5 in neat alcohols of Formula 9 generates the intermediates of Formula 10 after heating at temperatures between about 50 to 200°C for about 0.5 to 24 h. The resulting mixture is directly treated with base (e.g.- M+/0R2, K2CO3. NaH) followed by an alkylating agent R5-Y at ambient temperature to afford.the compounds of Formula 11 after reaction for about 0.5 to 24 h at 23 to 100°C. Finally, addition of the<br>
acid or ester species lb in the optional presence of the aforementioned catalyst ultimately<br>
provides the targeted species of Formula I after further reaction, workup; and purification.<br>
An alternative method for preparing a compound of Formula I is described by Schemes 16, and 17. A specifically preferred compound of Formula I, 6-iodo-3-n-propyl~2-n-propyloxy-4(3H)-quinazolinone is illustrated.<br>
Contacting propylcarbonimidoyl dichloride, (H. Ulrich, The Chemistry of lmidoyl Halides, Chapter 2, Plenum Press, New York, 1968) in a suitable solvent such as methylene chloride with a base such as potassium hydroxide and propanol gives the propyl propylchloroformimidate IIIb, which is then contacted with 5-iodoanthranilic acid, a base such as potassium hydroxide and a catalytic amount of tetra-n-butylammonium iodide to give a 6-iodo-3-n-propyl-2-n-propyloxy~4(3H)-quinazolinone.<br>
The isopropyl analog of the compound IIIb can be prepared by using the analogous starting materials isopropylcarbonimidoyl dichloride and isopropyl alcohol.<br><br>
rocess E- beginning with Compounds of Formula lc<br>
Compounds of Formula I may be prepared by a multi-step sequence beginning with the conversion of compounds of Formula lc to isothiocyanates of Formula [V (Scheme 18).<br>
Scheme 18<br>
Examples of the esters lc are cited in the literature (J. Med. Chem., (1088) 31, 2136; Ada. Chem. Scand., B42, (1988) 448; CA, 51:15522i), and the subsequent"thiophosgene-mediated conversion of these types of esters to the corresponding isothiocyanates is documented as well (7. Org. Chem., (1962) 27, 3701; 7. Med. Chem., (1991)34, 1531; Pharmazie, (1990)45, 530).<br>
Alternatively, isothiocyanates of Formula IV can be prepared by treating compounds of Formula lc with carbon disulfide in the presence of base.<br>
Either reaction may be conducted at temperatures ranging from about 25 to 150°C for about 0.5 to 48 h in an inert solvent optionally in the presence of base (e.g.- Et3N, solid or aqueous NaHCO3). A preferable method employs a.heterogeneous system comprised of a hydrocarbon solvent (e.g.- toluene, xylenes) and aqueous base [e.g.- NaHCO3(aq)] at ambient temperature for about 18 h. The skilled practitioner realizes that acid addition salts of compounds lc, as well as the neutral species, may be utilized in this transformation. Upon completion of the reaction, the crude isothiocyanate IV may be used in subsequent reactions without further purification following phase separation, drying (Na2SCO4), and concentration. However, isothiocyanates of Formula IV can be purified by additional aqueous washings, silica gel chromatography, and/or recrystallization from an appropriate solvent.<br>
The subsequent conversion of isothiocyanates of Formula IV to compounds of Formula 4 can be achieved by treatment of compounds of Formula IV with alcohols of Formula 9 either neat or in an inert solvent at temperatures ranging from about 25 to 150°C for about 0.5 to 48 h (Scheme 19). Similar transformations are known in the art (J. Med.<br>
Chem., (1995) 55. (1922); J. Het. Chem., (1982) 19, 1117). Purification of the compounds 4 can be achieved by precipitation and filtration from the reaction mixture, or by concentrating under reduced pressure followed by silica gel chromatography.<br>
A preferable alternative for generating and utilizing the compounds of formula 4 involves the neat reaction of the isothiocyanates IV with neat alcohols of Formula 9 at a reaction temperature from about 25 to 150°C for about 18 hand treatment of the resulting reaction mixture with amines of Formula 6 to afford the compounds of Formula I which may subsequently be isolated directly from the reaction mixture via crystallization and filtration.<br>
Alternatively, compounds of Formula 4 can be isolated and reacted with amines 6 in solvents other than the alcohols 9 to deliver the desired compounds I. Examples of such solvents include toluene, di-n-propyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, and pyridine. The reaction may be conducted at temperatures ranging from about 25 to 200°C for about 0.5 to 48 h. Purification of the crude product I so obtained may be accomplished by concentration under reduced pressure and silica gel chromatography.<br>
