This application claims the benefit of U.S Provisional Patent Application Serial Nos. 60/246,689, filed November 8, 2000, 60/246,707, filed November 8, 2000, 60/246,708, filed November 8, 2000, and 60/246,709, filed November 8, 2000.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to the field of ophthalmic solutions used to treat eyes, store contact lenses, or condition medical devices used in the eye. Such solutions are well known and widely employed with numerous products available commercially. There are several types of solutions within the field depending upon specific use. For instance, there are specific solutions for disinfecting contact lenses, solutions for cleaning contact lenses, solutions for treating the surface of contact lenses, solutions for rinsing lenses, solutions for wetting eyes, etc.<br>
While each of these lenses are formulated specifically for their intended application, each solution is formulated or handled so that it will remain free of sources of infection to they eye    Numerous approaches to this problem have been employed, from methods that call for sterilization of the solution and packaging of the solution in a container that will not allow contamination. Use of specific preservative agents employed in concentrations sufficient to prevent microbial increase have been employed.    Oxidative agents have been used as well as methods of irradiation. In the cases where chemical agents have been employed, there has been a tendency to employ one preservative agent in the formulation     It has been found that use of two or more specific agents in combination surprisingly provide greater efficacy in preserving solutions than state of the art single preservative systems and in particular the use of the combination of a cationic polymeric preservative, hydrogen peroxide and L-histidine provide increased preservative efficacy against fungal contamination<br>
1<br><br>
This surprising effect is achievable with the further use of certain, but not all. contact lens solution agents, in particular, certain tonicity agents when employed decrease the preservative efficacy of the invention and should not be employed<br>
As described in U.S  Pat No. 4.029,817, hydrophilic plastic materials are used in making soft contact lenses. U S. Pat. No. 3,503,393 to Seiderman and U.S. Pat. No. 2,976,576 to Wichterle describe processes for producing hydrophilic polymers of polyhydroxyelhylmethacrylate in aqueous reaction media having a sparingly cross-linked polymeric hydrogel structure and being elastic, soft, transparent hydrogels. Other soft contact lenses are made of silicone and other suitable materials.<br>
Hydrophilic lenses are particularly useful in opthalmology due to their ability to absorb water and swell to a soft mass of good mechanical strength, and due to their transparency with the ability to retain shape and dimensions when equilibrated in ocular fluid and in storage fluids when removed from the eye.<br>
One problem with soft contact lenses, however, is their sterilization and cleaning. The property of hydrophilic soft lenses which allows them to absorb large amounts of water also allows preservatives which might otherwise be used for cleaning and sterilization to be absorbed and later released onto the eye. The release, furthermore, may be much slower than the intake, thereby allowing preservatives to build up in the lenses. This can have the harmful result of damaging or staining contact lenses or harming the sensitive tissues of the conjunctivae or cornea<br>
As stated by R E. Phares in U.S. Pat No. 3,689,673, sterilization of hydrophilic soft contact lenses may be carried out by soaking in an aqueous solution containing approximately 0 001-0 01% chlorhexidine for a time sufficient to sterilize the lens.<br>
Various related methods are disclosed in other U S patents U.S Pat No 3,591,329 discloses the use of a cationic resin exchange material<br><br>
impregnated with active metallic silver U.S Pat. No 3755,561 teaches using an aqueous solution of polyvinyl pyrrolidone, a polyalkylene glycol and thimerosal U.S.Pat No. 3,873,696 discloses using a combination of potassium peroxymonosulfate in the presence of sodium chloride in U S Pat. No 3.876768 is described the use of a chlorinated trisodium phosphate material which is similar to hypochlorite. U.S. Pat. No. 3,888782 relates to the using of chiorhexidine and polyvinyl pyrrolidone. The use of an iodoform solution containing iodine, poiyvinyl alcohol and boric acid is disclosed in U.S, Pat. No. 3.911.107. U.S. Pat. No. 3,912,450 proposes using a combination of an alcoholic glutaraldehyde solution containing a surfactant in conjunction with an ultrasonic radiation device.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 3,888782 more particularly discloses an aqueous, substantially isotonic cleaning and sterilizing solution for plastic hydrophilic soft contact lenses containing, as active ingredients, chiorhexidine and polyvinylpyrrolidone. The solution is said to be non-toxic to the eye of the wearer of soft contact lenses and in the presence of a suitable amount of water soluble polyhydroxyethylmethacrylate to prevent the build-up of opaque deposits on the surfaces of soft contact lenses.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4.029.817 discloses that soft contact lenses may be sterilized by contacting soft lenses with a sterile, aqueous, substantially isotonic solution containing as an active ingredient, an effective amount of a specific quaternary ammonium compound.<br>
United States Patent No. 4758595 teaches a preserving solution comprising a microbicidally or fungicidally effective amount of a biguanide or water-soluble salt thereof, in combination with a buffer system but does not recognize the need to provide a broad spectrum preservative efficacy. United States Patent No. 4361548 discloses and claims disinfecting and/or preserving solution for contact lenses containing 0.00001 to 0.1 weight percent of a dimethyldiallylammonium chloride homopolymer having a molecular weight from about 10,000 to about 1,000,000, optionally together with up to 0.5 weight percent of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid or other<br>

While a multiple preservative system is disclosed, there is no teaching that the system has more than cumulative advantage.<br>
United States Patent No. 5741817 broadly teaches the use of amino acids, but is specifically addressed to the use of glycine in combination with specific antimicrobial preservatives, not the specific agents employed in the present invention.<br>
United States Patent No. 6022732 teaches that effective hydrogen peroxide based solutions used to disinfect lenses need to be reduced. In particular the patent is directed to Compositions, and methods for using such compositions, which are useful to destroy hydrogen peroxide in a liquid aqueous medium, such as that used to disinfect contact lenses. In one embodiment, the composition comprises a hydrogen peroxide destroying component effective when released in a hydrogen peroxide-containing liquid aqueous medium to destroy or cause the destruction of hydrogen peroxide present in the hydrogen peroxide-containing liquid aqueous medium, and a barrier component acting to substantially prevent the release of the hydrogen peroxide destroying component for a period of time after the composition is initially contacted with the hydrogen peroxide-containing liquid aqueous medium, the barrier component comprising a material selected from the group consisting of water soluble cellulose derivatives and mixtures thereof having a molecular weight of at least about 20,000. The composition results in reduced foam formation relative to a similar composition including a barrier component comprising a similar material having a molecular weight of 10,000 when both<br>

Preferably, the composition further includes transition metal ions in an amount effective to further enhance the antimicrobial activity of the aqueous liquid medium and is substantially free of peroxidase<br>
United States Patent No. 5854303 teaches a polymeric material incorporating a polyvalent cation chelating agent in an amount effective to inhibit the growth of an ocular pathogen, particularly a protozoan, can be used to produce eye care products such as contact lens cases and containers for containing eye care solutions and contact lenses.<br>

It does not suggest that L-histidine could be used with other bactericidal agents to improve their effect.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5741817 demonstrates that glycine enhances the activity of antimicrobial preservatives, and could be used in ophthalmic solutions and are useful as substitutes for EDTA, while U.S. Pat. No. 5,494,937 teaches solutions that contain a combination of glycien with a borate-polyol complex, one or more anionic or nonionic surfactants, and a low molecular weight ammo acid (e.g., glycine) This system requires certain anti-bacterial surfactants and no edta specifically teaches glycine<br>

tha "histidine is not known to have been previously suggested for use in care regimens for contact lenses, although the oxidation reaction of histidine with an excess of iodine is discussed in a paper by Schutte, L , et al, "The Substitution Reaction of Histidine and Some Other Imidazole Derivatives With Iodine," Tetrahedron, Suppl 7, pp. 295-306 (1965). One drawback to using an imidazoie such as histidine is the formation of an oxidation product that decomposes to a brown degradation product "<br>

These solutions may be employed in various ways including cleaning contact lenses, rinsing lenses while in the eye, storing lenses and in delivering active pharmaceutical agents to the eye. The invention may also further comprise a surface-active agent chosen from those known in the art, but in particular might be a hydroxy-ethoxylated castor oil.<br>
Histidine is a basic amino acid well known in the chemical arts and available from numerous commercial sources. Histidine is known to be used in ophthalmic ointments and the like in very concentrated forms see United States Patent No. 5,811,446.<br>
The cationic polymeric preservatives The cationic polymeric preservative includes polymeric biguanides such as polymeric hexamethylene biguanides (PHMB), and combinations thereof. Such cationic polymeric biguanides, and water-soluble salts thereof, having the following formula.<br><br>
wherein Z is an organic divalent bridging group which may be the same or different throughout the polymer, n is on average at least 3, preferably on average 5 to 20, and X1 and X2 are<br><br>
7<br><br>
One preferred group of water-soluble polymeric biguanides will have number average molecular weights of at least 1,000 and more preferably will have number average molecular weights from 1,000 to 50,000. Suitable water-soluble salts of the free bases include, but are not limited to hydrochloride, borate, acetate, gluconate, sulfonate, tartrate and citrate salts.<br>
The above-disclosed biguanides and methods of preparation are described in the literature. For example, U.S Pat. No. 3,428,576 describes the preparation of polymeric biguanides from a diamine and salts thereof and a diamine salt of dicyanimide.<br>
Most preferred are the polymeric hexamethylene biguanides, commercially available, for example, as the hydrochloride salt from Zeneca (Wilmington, Del.) under the trademark CosmocilTM CQ. Such polymers and water-soluble salts are referred to as polyhexamethylene (PHMB) or polyaminoptopyl biguantde (PAPB). The term polyhexamethylene biguanide, as used herein, is meant to encompass one or more biguanides have the following formula:<br><br>

:s<br><br>
In another embodiment, a polymeric biguanide is used in combination with a bis(biguanide) compound. Polymeric biguanides, in combination with bisbiguanides such as alexidine, are effective in concentrations  as low as 0.00001 weight percent (0.1 ppm). It has also been found that the bactericidal activity of the solutions may be enhanced or the spectrum of activity broadened through the use of a combination of such polymeric biguanides with alexidine or similar biguanides.<br>
An optional non-biguanide disinfectant/gennicide can be employed as a solution preservative, but it may also function to potentiate, complement or broaden the spectrum of microbiocidal activity of another germicide. This includes microbiocidally effective amounts of germicides which are compatible with and do not precipitate in the solution, in concentrations ranging from about 0.00001 to about 0.5 weight percent, and more preferably, from about 0.0001 to about 0.1 weight percent. Suitable complementary germicidal agents include, but are not limited to, quaternary ammonium compounds or polymers, thimerosal or other phenylmercuric salts, sorbic acid, alkyl triethanolamines, and mixtures thereof. Representative examples of the quaternary ammonium compounds are compositions comprised of benzalkonium halides or, for example, balanced mixtures of n-alkyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chlorides. Other examples include polymeric quaternary ammonium salts used in ophthalmic applications such as poly[(dimethyliminio)-2-butene-1,4-diyI chlonde], [4-tris(2-hydroxyethyl) ammonio]-2-butenyl-w-[tris(2-hydroxyethyl)ammonio]dichloride (chemical registry number 75345-27-6) generally available as polyquaternium 1 (r) from ONYX Corporation, or those described in U.S. Pat No. 6,153,568.<br>
Peroxide sources may also be included in the formulations of the present invention and are exemplified by hydrogen peroxide, and such compounds , which provide an effective resultant amount of hydrogen peroxide, such as sodium perborate decahydrate, sodium peroxide, urea peroxide and peracetic acid, an organic peroxy compound<br>
9<br><br>
The pH of the present solutions should be maintained within the range of 5 0 to 8 0, more preferably about 6.0 to 8.0, most preferably about 6 5 to 7 8. Suitable buffers may be added, such as boric acid, sodium borate, potassium citrate, citric acid, sodium bicarbonate, bis-tris propane, TRIS, and various mixed phosphate buffers (including combinations of Na2HPO4, NaH2PO4 and KH2PO4) and mixtures thereof Borate buffers are preferred, particularly for enhancing the efficacy of PAPB. Generally, buffers will be used in amounts ranging from about 0.05 to 2.5 percent by weight, and preferably, from 0.1 to 1.5 percent.<br>
The solutions of the present invention may further contain other additives including but not limited to buffers, tonicity agents, demulcents, wetting agents, preservatives, sequestering agents (chelating agents), surface active agents, and enzymes.<br>
Ophthalmologically acceptable chelating agents useful in the present invention include amino carboxylic acid compounds or water-soluble salts thereof, including ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, nitrilotriacetic acid, diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid, hydroxyethylethylenediaminetriacetic acid, 1,2-diaminocyclohexanetetraacetic acid, ethylene glycol bis (beta-aminoethyl ether) in N, N, N', N' tetraacetic acid (EGTA), aminodiacetic acid and hydroxyethylamino diacetic acid. These acids can be used in the form of their water soluble salts, particularly their alkali metal salts. Especially preferred chelating agents are the di, tn- and tetra-sodium salts of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), most preferably disodium EDTA (Disodium Edetate).<br>

The solutions of the invention are compatible with both rigid gas permeable and hydrophilic contact lenses and other ophthalmic devices and instruments ¦ during storage, cleaning, wetting, soaking, rinsing and disinfection<br>
A typical aqueous solution of the present invention may contain additional ingredients which would not affect the basic and novel characteristics of the active ingredients described earlier, such as tonicity agents, surfactants and viscosity inducing agents, which may aid in either the lens cleaning or in providing lubrication to the eye Suitable tonicity agents include sodium chloride, potassium chloride, glycerol or mixtures thereof The tonicity of the solution is typically adjusted to approximately 240-310 milliosmoles per kilogram solution (mOsm/kg) to render the solution compatible with ocular tissue and with hydrophilic contact lenses. In one embodiment, the solution contains 0.01 to 0.35 weight percent sodium chloride.<br>
The solutions employed in the present invention may also include surfactants such as a polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene nonionic surfactant which, for example, can be selected from the group of commercially available surfactants having the name poloxamine or poloxamer, as adopted by The CTFA International Cosmetic Ingredient Dictionary. The poloxamine surfactants consist of a poly(oxypropylene)-poly(oxyethylene) adduct of ethylene diamine having a molecular weight from about 7,500 to about 27,000 wherein at least 40 weight percent of said adduct is poly(oxyethylene), has been found to be particularly advantageous for use in conditioning contact lenses when used in amounts from about 0.01 to about 15 weight percent. Such surfactants are available from BASF Wyandotte Corp., Wyandotte, Mich., under the registered trademark "Tetronic". The poloxamers are an analogous series of surfactants and are pofyoxyethylene, polyoxypropylene block polymers available from BASF Wyandotte Corp., Parsippany, N.J. 07054 under the trademark "Pluronic".<br>
The HLB of a surfactant is known to be a factor in determining the emulsification characteristics of a nonionic surfactant in general, surfactants with lower HLB values are more lipophilic, while surfactants with higher HLB<br>
11<br><br>
values are more hydrophllic The HLB values of various poloxamines and poloxamers are provided by BASF Wyandotte Corp , Wyandotte, Mich Preferably, the HLB of the surfactant in the present invention is at least 18, more preferably 18 to 32, based on values reported by BASF.<br>
Additional compatible surfactants that are known to be useful in contact wetting or rewetting solutions can be used in the solutions of this invention The surfactant should be soluble in the lens care solution and non-irritating to eye tissues. Satisfactory non-ionic surfactants include polyethylene glycol esters of fatty acids, e.g. coconut, polysorbate, polyoxyethylene or polyoxypropylene ethers of higher alkanes (C12 - C18).

The results demonstrate the improved antifungal efficacy of the histidine -hydrogen peroxide combination against C. afbicans.<br>
Example 3 Histidine - Peroxide<br>
Formulations were prepared by dissolving L-histidine in water.   The pH of the solutions were adjusted to 7.3 with 1N hydrochloric acid   Glycerin, hydrogen peroxide, Dequest 2010 and polyhexamethylenebiguanide HCI (PHMB) were added to these solutions. The formulations were diluted to volume with water. Each of these solutions were tested for their activity against C. albicans (ATCC 10231) following a two hour exposure. The activity is expressed as a log reduction from the initial inoculum. The compositions, concentrations and activity of each of the solutions are summarized in the following table.<br>
