N-acyl derivatives of amino acids, a process for preparation thereof, a pharmaceutical<br>
composition and use thereof as antiallergic, anti-inflammatory and hypolipidemic agents<br>
Description<br>
The present invention relates to the field of bioorganic chemistry and concerns N-acyl<br>
derivatives of amino acids and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, novel processes for<br>
synthesis of said compounds as well as pharmaceutical compositions based on them and use<br>
thereof in medicine as anti-allergic, anti-inflammatory and hypolipidemic agents.<br>
Prior art<br>
Allergic diseases and lipid metabolism disorders are known to be highly prevalent at the<br>
present time because of a poor environmental situation, change in the structure of nutrition and<br>
life style of population. Therefore, the problem of developing medicaments for combating these<br>
pathologies as well as inflammatory processes accompanying allergy, remains to be actual.<br>
H1-histamine receptor blockers are the most spread group of anti-allergic drugs.. At the<br>
present time, two generations of anti-histamine drugs are distinguished [Mashkovsky M.D.<br>
Lekarstvennye sredstva (Medicaments)/ Moscow, the Novaya Volna publishers, 2005, p.285].<br>
Anti-histamine drugs of the first generation pass through blood-brain barrier and are<br>
capable of inducing H1-receptor blockade of the central nervous system cells that causes their<br>
adverse sedative effect. High blood concentration of these drugs are required to achieve a<br>
pronounced anti-histamine action that requires prescription thereof at high doses. A rather<br>
frequent development of tachyphylaxy, effect on the CNS manifested by disordered<br>
coordination, dizziness, feeling of flabbiness, lowered ability of concentrating attention are<br>
negative characteristics of these drugs. In spite of the aforesaid, anti-histamine agents of the first<br>
generation are still used especially in the situations when a very fast treatment effect is needed,<br>
for example in anaphylaxis. Dimedrol (diphenhydramine), suprastine (chloropyramine), tavegil<br>
(clemastine) and phencarol (chyphenadine) belong to the first generation anti-histamine drugs.<br>
Anti-histamine drugs of the second generation have attained a wide use in allergological<br>
practice since they have no adverse effects inherent to the first generation drugs. In particular,<br>
the second generation drugs do not pass through the blood-brain barrier, they do not exert<br>
sedative and hypnotic effects. These drugs are characterized by a fast and long-lasting anti-<br>
histamine action. Claritine (Loratadine), Zirtec (Cetirisine), Kestine (Ebastine) belong to the<br>
second generation anti-histamine drugs. However, the conducted clinical trials have revealed<br>
side effects of these drugs caused by interaction thereof with other medicaments or by<br>
interruption of its metabolism induced by P450 cytochrome. Thus, potentially sedative<br>
(Cetirisine, Loratadine) and potentially cardiotoxic (Terphenadine, Asthemisol (Ebastine) effects<br><br>
2<br>
have been detected in the second generation anti-histamine agents.<br>
In some cases, for example in bronchial asthma, glucocorticoids exerting a potent anti-<br>
allergic action are used. However, use thereof is accompanied by systemic manifestations such<br>
as Itsenko-Cushing syndrome, hypertension, hyperkalemia, osteoporosis etc. [Mashkovsky M.D.<br>
Lekarstvennye sredstva (Medicaments)/ Moscow, 1993, Vol.1, p.365].<br>
The pathochemical stage of allergic response development, which to a significant extent<br>
is determined by the activation degree of the first order allergy target cells (basophils and mast<br>
cells), plays a special role in the development of allergic diseases. Capability of accumulating<br>
and releasing biologically active compounds, first of all histamine, under the effect of a stimulus<br>
(allergen) is an important feature thereof. In IgE- and/or IgG-mediated response to antigen, just<br>
these cells determine degree of manifestation of immediate allergy clinical picture [Parker<br>
Ch.V./ Mediators: Release and Functions.// In: Immunology. Edited by W. Pole. Moscow, the<br>
Mir publishers. 1989. vol.3, pp.170-247; Chakravarty N.K.// In: The mast cell: Its role in health<br>
and disease, ed. J. Pepys. 1979. p.38-46].<br>
There is a group of drugs (sodium cromoglycate (cromoglycic acid disodium salt),<br>
ketotyphen, oxatomide) useful in bronchial asthma and bronchospastic conditions the action of<br>
which is based on the capability of inhibiting mast cell degranulation and hampering release<br>
from them of mediator substances promoting the development of bronchial spasms, allergy and<br>
inflammation (bradykinin, histamine). Mucosal irritation, headache, laryngeal edema, cough,<br>
suffocation may be observed as side effects [Mashkovsky M.D. Lekarstvennye sredstva<br>
(Medicaments)/ Moscow, the Novaya Volna publishers, 2005, p.297].<br>
Ischemic heart disease that is the first most frequent cause of lethality of adult population<br>
world-wide is known to be the most frequent manifestation of atherosclerosis. Lipid metabolism<br>
disorder manifested by elevated blood plasma cholesterol level including low density lipoprotein<br>
cholesterol (LDLC) and very low density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDLC) which are called<br>
"atherogenic" lipoproteins with simultaneous decrease in the amount of "anti-atherogenic"<br>
lipoproteins is recognized as one of the leading disorders in the instant disease.<br>
Change in plasma lipid content and ratio was shown to reflect modification thereof in<br>
membranous structures of parenchymal organs. Composition of cellular membranes, for example<br>
macrosomal, is directly depends on the diet given to experimental animals [Wade A., Harred W.<br>
// Feder. Proct. 1976, vol. 55. pp. 2475-2479]. Administration of cholesterol to animals induces<br>
cholesterol accumulation in cellular membranes decreasing fluidity thereof that in turn, results in<br>
functional state modification of enzymes [Buters J.T.M., Zysset T., Reichen J.//Biochem.<br>
Pharmacol. 1993. vol. 46. Iss 6. pp. 983-991].<br>
Hypolipidemic agents lowering blood level of cholesterol and triglycerids may be used<br><br>
3<br>
for treating and preventing diseases associated with lipid metabolism disorders. The latter are<br>
characterized by elevated level of triglycerides, total cholesterol (TC), low density and very low<br>
density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC and VLDLC) and by lowered level of high density<br>
lipoprotein cholesterol in such diseases as atherosclerosis, obesity, ischemic heart and cerebral<br>
disease, myocardial infarction, stroke and which serve as a risk factor of manifested diabetes and<br>
thrombus formation.<br>
Clinical use of so called statines, cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitors, for example zokor<br>
(simvastatine) is known. Drugs of the given group at doses 80 mg daily are sufficiently effective<br>
mainly with regard to lowering total cholesterol level, but these drugs being poorly available and<br>
representing chemical compounds which are xenogenic for the body. Furthermore, use thereof<br>
can be accompanied by the side effects such as change in hepatic function with elevated blood<br>
transaminase levels and dyspepsia [Mashkovsky M.D. Medicaments./ Meditsina publishers.<br>
Moscow. 1993. vol.1, p.463].<br>
In view of the foregoing, a search for novel efficient anti-allergic and hypolipidemic<br>
agents with alternative mechanisms of action which are capable of manifesting activity at low<br>
concentrations and devoid of side effects is actual. With this regard, compounds comprising<br>
residues of substances of natural origin are of a special interest as for them, a lower toxicity and<br>
a lower occurrence of side effects may be predicted.<br>
In the International application publication WO 99/01103 anti-allergic and hypolipidemic<br>
action of N-acyl derivatives of biogenic amines, for example γ-glutamyl histamine and the<br>
closest analog thereof glutaryl histamine is disclosed; these compounds are the closest ones by<br>
structure and action to the claimed compounds. In the article of Krzhechkovskaya V.V.,<br>
Zheltukhina G.A., Nebolsin V.E. et al. Study of anti-anaphylactic activity and mechanisms of<br>
action of γ-L-glutamyl histamine. // Pathogenez (Pathogenesis). 2003. Vol.1 No 2, pp.60-64 γ-<br>
glutamyl histamine was shown to possess a frank anti-anaphylactic activity when different<br>
animal species and administration rates are used. The results obtained show that in mast cells of<br>
animals a significant lowering histamine level and antigen-stimulated secretion thereof occurs<br>
under the effect of γ-glutamyl histamine. Decrease in bronchial spasm value more than by 50%<br>
as compared to the control was shown in the test of glutaryl histamine effect on manifestation<br>
degree of antigen-induced bronchial spasm. The instant effect was manifested in both oral and<br>
intratracheal route of administration at a low dose of 50 µg/kg. Glutaryl histamine is capable of<br>
lowering manifestations of passive cutaneous anaphylaxis. In WO 99/01103 administration to<br>
animals of glutaryl histamine at doses 50 and 500 µg/kg was shown to significantly lower<br>
intensity of delayed type hypersensitivity. Furthermore, glutaryl histamine at doses 50 and 500<br>
µg/kg also possessed some anti-cholesterolemic activity lowering total cholesterol by 5 to 7% as<br><br>
4<br>
compared to animals with atherogenic loading.<br>
Drawback of glutaryl histamine is a comparatively high cost and a poor availability of the<br>
starting material for preparation thereof i.e. histamine. Furthermore, the indicated substance is<br>
insufficiently effective in the tests mentioned above.<br>
In order to expand arsenal of technical means and to create a more efficient and available<br>
anti-allergic, anti-inflammatory and hypolipidemic agent, the inventors have revealed certain<br>
specific N-acyl derivatives of amino acids of general formula I disclosed in the International<br>
application publication WO 99/01103 but particularly not described, not prepared and not<br>
characterized therein except for glutaryl-L-histidine methyl ester (XII).<br>

added to an aqueous solution of an amino acid in the absence of inorganic and organic base with<br>
obtaining the target product with a sufficiently high yield of 55 to 60%.<br>

acids of formula I and salts thereof comprising addition of glutaric or succinic anhydride in the<br>
form of a solid to an aqueous amino acid solution of general formula I:<br><br>
7<br>
and optionally converting the target product into a salt thereof.<br>
The instant invention further relates to a process for preparing N-acyl derivatives of<br>
amino acids and salts thereof which process comprises reacting in a biphasic system of glutaric<br>
or succinic anhydride with an aqueous solution of the amino acid of general formula<br><br>
and optionally converting the target product into a salt thereof.<br>

dermatitis, psoriasis, urticaria, allergic (including anaphylactic( reactions to insect stings and<br>
medicaments, cold allergy, allergic conjunctivitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases,<br>

and cerebral disease, myocardial infarction, stroke, which method comprises administering to a<br>
subject an effective amount of the compound of general formula I or a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt thereof.<br>
Detailed disclosure of the invention<br>
Preferable compounds of general formula 1 are presented in Table 1.<br><br><br>
Synthesis of compounds of general formula I can be accomplished by two processes. The<br>
first process consists in a gradual adding to an aqueous solution of an amino acid of general<br>
formula<br><br><br>
glutaric or succinic anhydride in the form of a solid with subsequent isolation of the<br>
target product using ion exchange chromatography, preferably by passing reaction mixture<br>
through a column with cationite and subsequent crystallization from aqueous solution. The<br>
crystals of the target product obtained are washed with a suitable solvent, preferably methanol.<br>
The main advantage of the claimed process consists in the absence of alkali in the amino acid<br>
aqueous solution that prevents from inactivation of dicarboxylic acid anhydride resulting from<br>
hydrolysis. Furthermore, imidazol residue in the amino acid molecule can effect acidic-basic<br>
autocatalysis of acylation reaction of the amino group of amino acid. Rather high yields (55-<br>
60%) in using the claimed process are achieved in particular due to a gradual adding<br>
dicsarboxylic acid anhydride taken in the excess, and to vigorous stirring reaction mass.<br>
Compounds of general formula I can be also prepared using an alternative process in a<br>
biphasic system which process comprises adding glutaric or succinic anhydride in a water<br>
immiscible solvent to .an aqueous solution of the amino acid of general formula:<br><br>
The instant process allows to use the excess of an acylating agent, achieve the complete<br>
acylation of a-amino group of the amino acid and yield of the target product of about 70%. In<br>
order to maintain required pH, instead of an inorganic alkali, the organic base pyridine is used<br>
which does not hydrolyze anhydride and in addition is known to be catalyst of acylation. Using<br>
pyridine allows for avoiding contamination of the final product by inorganic salts which together<br>
with the reaction product remain in aqueous layer. The used approaches allow for simplifying<br>
separation of the target product from non-reacted anhydride and respective amino acid and<br>
isolating the target product by a simple crystallization.<br><br>
10<br>
Preferable water immiscible organic solvents are butanol, ethylacetate and chloroform.<br>
Preferable solvents useful for crystallizing the target product are water-alcohol mixtures,<br>
in particular, water-ethanol.<br>
N-acyl derivatives of amino acid esters of invention (VI-XIII) can be prepared by the<br>
action of respective internal anhydrides of dicarboxylic acids on amino-free histidine or<br>
tryptophane esters in an organic or water-organic medium. Preferable is preparing the<br>
compounds VI-XIII in a biphasic system using water immiscible organic solvents butanol,<br>
ethylacetate and chloroform.<br>
Compounds of general formula I can also be prepared in the form of pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts by reacting for example with sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide,<br>
magnesium carbonate, lithium hydroxide, calcium carbonate using routine processes widely<br>
disclosed in the literature.<br>
Compounds of general formula I have anti-allergic, anti-inflammatory and hypolipidemic<br>
activity and they can be used fro treating allergic, anaphylactic diseases including those<br>
accompanied by inflammation, as well as lipid metabolism disorders.<br>
In particular, compounds of the present invention may be used for treating the following<br>

Effect of compounds of general formula I on immediate type allergic reactions (in vitro test<br>
of ovalbumin (OA)-induced blood basophil degranulation of immunized guinea pig)<br>
Leukocytes from guinea pig blood were isolated according to the Freemel's method<br>
[Immunologicheskiye Metody under edition of G. Frimel/Moscow., "Meditsina" publishers,<br>
1987, p.222 in the inventor's modification].<br>
Guinea pigs of both sexes weighing from 600 to 800 g were used to conduct the test. The<br>
animals were once immunized with a mixture of 10 µg ovalbumin and 100 mg aluminum<br>
hydroxide per one animal according to Andersson [Anderson P. Antigen-induced bronchial<br>
anaphylaxis in actively sensitized guinea-pigs.//Allergy. 1980. Vol. 35. P.63-71].<br>
Under ester anesthesia, 15 ml blood were drawn from guinea pig heart. Double<br>
precipitation of cells using EDTA and a citrate-containing precipitating liquid was used to isolate<br>
basophils in the leukocyte suspension.<br>
Blood was mixed with 5% EDTA-Na2 2H2O ("Sigma") solution at 9:1 ratio and in 30<br>
minutes it was subjected to mild centrifugation (for 12 minutes at 80 g). Supernatant was<br>
collected and centrifuged for 15 minutes at 500 g.<br>
To the remaining cells, a citrate-containing precipitating liquid (3) was added at<br><br>
20<br>
proportion 3:10 (it was thermostated at 37°C for 30 minutes). A supernatant fraction enriched by<br>
leukocytes was centrifuged for 7 minutes at 100 g. To leukocyte precipitate, 0.85% NaCl<br>
solution was added and cellular concentration was brought to 30x103/µl..<br>
Protocol of the in vitro basophil degranulation test [Spravochnil po klinicheskim<br>
laboratornym metodam issledovaniya (A reference book on clinical-laboratory examination<br>
methods)/Edited by E.A. Cost/Moscow, "Meditsina" publishers, 1975, p. 130].<br>
For the test, a centrifuge tube (3 tubes per each sample) was filled with 300 ul cellular<br>
suspension, then salt solution of a tested compound (or a salt solution in the control of<br>
spontaneous and maximum degranulation) was added and pre-incubated at 37°C for 15 minutes,<br>
then into each tube 300 µl 1% OA solution was added (in the control of spontaneous<br>
degranulation a salt solution in the same amount was added) and once more pre-incubated at<br>
37°C for 10 minutes. Functional leukocyte concentration was 104/µl. Samples (100 µl) were<br>
taken off from each tube into separate tubes to assess a complete basophil degranulation, and to<br>
the remained cells, a cooled salt solution was added (5 ml into each tube) to arrest degranulation<br>
reaction, then the tubes were centrifuged for 7 min at 100 g, and from precipitate, preparations<br>
for microscopy were prepared. The preparations were fixed and stained according to the method<br>
of Seder et al. [Seder R.A. et al. Mouse splenic and bone marrow cell populations that express<br>
high - affinity Fes receptors and produce interleukin-4 are highly enriched in basophils.//<br>
Proc.Natl.Acad.USA, 1991, V.88, P.2835-2839].<br>
In order to detect a specific basophil granulation, the dye 0.5% alcyanic blue (pH 1.0)<br>
was used, nuclei were additionally stained with safranin (0.1% solution in 1% acetic acid). The<br>
preparations were used to assess a total degranulation inhibition.<br>
Atotal degranulation inhibition (DI) (%) was calculated according to the formula:<br><br>
max - % of degranulated basophils at the maximum degranulation (OA)<br>
spontaneous - % of degranulated basophils in spontaneous degranulation (control)<br>

The data of Table 3 show that as compared to glutaryl histamine, the compound (IV)<br>
exerts a pronounced anti-anaphylactic action manifested by a practically 100% degranulation<br>
inhibition in the test of a complete OA-induced degranulation of blood basophils collected in<br>
immunized guinea pigs (in vitro anaphylaxis reaction in a calcium free medium). A significant<br>
anti-anaphylactic effect of compound IV is also manifested by decrease in the number of<br>
degranulated cells, especially pronounced at concentration 10-5 M (absence of degranulated<br>
cells).<br>
Example 15<br>
Study of the effect of compounds of general formula I on systemic anaphylaxis in vivo<br>
A bronchial spasm model in conscious guinea pigs actively sensitized by exposure to<br>
aerosol ovalbumin as an antigen was used [Kovaleva V.L. "Metodicheskiye ukazaniya po<br>

Guinea pigs were sensitized by ovalbumin according to the method of Andersson<br>
[Anderson P. Antigen-induced bronchial anaphylaxis in actively sensitized guinea-pigs.//Allergy.<br>
1980. Vol. 35. P. 63-71] and in 1-2 months following sensitization, bronchial spasm was<br>
induced by aerosol administration of albumin booster dose (3 mg/kg in 1 ml normal saline).<br>
In test groups, guinea pigs were for three days administered with tested compounds at<br><br>
23<br>
doses 10 µg/kg, 50 µg/kg, and 150 µg/kg, using a probe. In the other group of experiments, the<br>
tested compounds at dose 50 µg/kg (in 1 ml normal saline) were administered nasally (using a<br>
nebulizer) also once daily for three days. The control group was administered with normal saline.<br>
One hour post the last administration of substances, ovalbumin was administered by inhalation<br>
using a nebulizer, and intensity and duration (in seconds) of bronchial spasm reaction in animals<br>
was assessed.<br>

Experimental results presented in Tables 4 and 5 show that compound IV in intragastric<br>
administration at doses 10 and 150 µg/kg and at dose 50 µg/kg by inhalation exhibited anti-<br>
anaphylactic activity. Administering the substance at dose 50 µg/kg by inhalation blocked the<br>
development of the acute phase of bronchoconstrictory reaction which by inducing suffocation,<br>
is a cause of animals' death. In intragastric administration of compound IV at doses 10 and 150<br>
µg/kg, a significant protective effect with regard to antigen-induced bronchial spasm was<br>
detected.<br>
Thus, compound IV exhibits a significant protective effect with regard to systemic<br><br>
24<br>
anaphylactic reaction in vivo.<br>
Example 16<br>
Anti-allergic action of compounds of general formula I on the model of allergic rhinitis in<br>
guinea pigs<br>
The model of allergic rhinitis in guinea pigs was used.<br>
Guinea pigs were immunized according to the certain scheme for 1.5-2 months (Hutson<br>
P.A., Church M.K. et al. 1988): the animals were first immunized by intraperitoneal<br>
administration of ovalbumin at dose 10 mg/kg at 7-day interval (twice), then ovalbumin solution<br>
was inhaled to the guinea pigs using the Pari nebulizer at increasing concentration beginning<br>
from 0.1% and reaching 1% at 4-day intervals between inhalations. The last ovalbumin dose was<br>
administered into the nasal passages using a micropipette. 24 hours post the last ovalbumin<br>
administration nasal washing was collected (through a system of special tubes) and changes in<br>
nasal mucosa was assessed using a complex of histological and cytological methods. The<br>
compounds tested (0.1% solution) were daily administered in the form of inhalations using<br>
nebulizing device for 6 days; at day 6 of administration, antigen (OA) challenge was performed.<br>
Nαsal wash-off was obtained 24 hours post challenge.<br>
Table 6<br>
The effect of compound IV on cytosis (absolute number of cells in 1 µl) in a nasal wash-off<br><br><br><br>
It follows form Tables 5-7 that under the conditions of modeling allergic rhinitis,<br>
compound IV significantly suppresses eosinophilic inflammation. This is supported by lowering<br>
down to the norm absolute and relative number of eosinophils, as well as by a significant<br>
lowering cytosis in nasal wash-off.<br>
Example 17<br>

Immunization of the animals was similar to that described in Example 7.<br>
24 hours post the last ovalbumin administration broncho-alveolar wash-off was collected<br>
(through a cannula inserted into the trachea), and changes in bronchial mucosa was assessed<br>
using a complex of histological and cytological methods.<br>
The compounds tested (0.1% solution) were daily administered in the form of inhalations<br>
using a nebulizing device for 6 days; at day 6 of administration, antigen (OA) challenge was<br>
performed.<br><br>

It follows from the data of Tables 9 and 10 that compound IV under the conditions of<br>
allergic pneumonitis model significantly inhibits inflammatory process that is manifested by<br>
decrease in cytosis, lowering the level of the key inflammatory cells eosinophils, by a sharp<br>
lowering neutrophil level as well as by decrease in lymphocyte number.<br><br>

Example 18<br>
Study of anti-inflammatory action of compounds of general formula I on the model of<br>
pneumonitis induced in rats by sephadex<br>
The model of sephadex-induced (6-day) pneumonitis in rats<br>
Male Wistar rats weighing 270-300 g were used in the tests.<br>
Inflammation in the lungs was induced by a single inhalation of sephadex A-25<br>
(hydrophilic powder with particle sizes from 20 to 80 µm) at dose 5 mg/kg using a dosing device<br>
which is a laboratory analog of the inhaler "Cyclohaler" (the Scientific-Research Institute for<br>
Pulmonology of the RF).<br>
A technique of inhalation administering sephadex and pharmacological substances<br>
Sephadex A-25 at dose 5 mg per 1 kg body weight was administered to rats under ester<br>
anesthesia using an original dosing device for inhalation administering dry powders. Following<br>
administration of Sephadex A-25, Wistar rats rapidly recovered form anesthesia, and no<br>
peculiarities in their behavior and respiration character were noted. The substances in the form of<br>
a dry powder were administered by inhalation at dose 500 µg/kg 1 hour post Sephadex<br>
administration, then for 5 days in succession once daily at one and the same morning hours. The<br>
control was represented by two groups: a group of intact animals, anda group of rats<br>
administered once with Sephadex by inhalation.<br>
The results of therapeutic action of pharmacological substances on pneumonitis<br>
development were assessed using morphological and morphometric parameters (volume density<br>
and alveolitis) 6 days post aerosol Sephadex administration.<br>
Methods used in the study<br>
Histological method<br>
Histological examinations of the lungs stained by hematoxyline and eosine.<br>
Morphometric methods<br>
4-5 urn thick histological lung slices were prepared wherein neutrophil number was<br>
calculated as well as volume density of alveolitis and emphysema was assessed using the<br>
Avtandilov's mesh [Avtandilov G.G., Vvedeniye v kolichestvennuyu pathologicheskuyu<br>
morphologiyu.// Moscow. "Meditsina" publishers. 1980. p. 203]. Morphometric examination of<br>
pulmonary lymphoid tissue was also carried out. To this end, micro preparations of the lungs<br>
were fixed according to the method of Beinenstock et al [Bienenstock J., Johnson N., Perey<br>
D.Y.E. Bronchial lymphoid tissue 1. Morphologic characteristics//Lab. Invest. 1973. v.28 p.693-<br>
698.] The lungs with trachea were removed from the thoracic cavity, and the micro preparation<br>
was placed into 2% water acetic acid solution. 18-24 hours later, the trachea, the main and<br>
lobular bronchi were dissected, and morphometric assessment of volume density of the lymphoid<br><br>
28<br>
tissue associated with the bronchi was carried out using the point calculation method under a<br>
magnifying glass (magnification x7). Volume density of alveolitis and emphysema was<br>
determined using the point calculation method.<br>
Cytological methods<br>
Broncho-alveolar wash-off was obtained in rats and guinea pigs under hexenal anesthesia<br>
by double washing the lungs through the trachea with 10 ml normal saline. Viability of cells was<br>
determined in the test with tryptane blue. Absolute number of cells in 1 ml (cytosis) was<br>
determined in the broncho-alveolar wash-off liquid (BAW) using the Goryaev's chamber. In the<br>
smears of the BAW liquid precipitate obtained using centrifugation at 200 g for 10 minutes and<br>
then stained according to Romanovsky-Gimza, endopulmonary cytogram was calculated (in<br>
percent) [Avtsyn A.P., Lukomskij G.I., Romanova L.K. et al. Endopul'monal'naya<br>
cytogramma.// Sov. Med. 1982. No 7. pp.8-14].<br>
The study results were processed using variation statistics method and the Student's t-test<br>

Histological examination of the lungs<br>
Compound IV induced a distinct anti-inflammatory action: prevalence of alveolitis was<br>
significantly lower as compared to the model group of animals; emphysema was not practically<br>
detected; infiltration of interalveolar septa with neutrophils was not noted. By cytosis level and<br>
number of neutrophils in the BAW, inflammatory process was also significantly less pronounced<br>
that in animals administered with Sephadex for 5 days.<br>
Thus, all complex of the experimental models used suggests a significant anti-allergic,<br>
anti-anaphylactic and anti-inflammatory activity of compounds of general formula I manifested<br>
in both in vitro tests and in modeling allergic and inflammatory pathology in vivo.<br>
Example 19<br>
The study of hypolipidemic action of compounds of general formula I on the model of<br>
hypercholesterolemia in rats<br>
The study was carried out on male Wistar rats weighing 200±20 g. Hyperlipidemia was<br>
induced by oral administration of cholesterol loading, oily cholesterol suspension:<br>
olive oil (Acorsa, Spain) - 5 ml/kg weigh of animals;<br>
cholesterol (Sigma, USA) - 1 g/kg weight;<br>
sodium cholate (Sigma, USA) - 100 mg/ kg weight.<br>
As a reference preparation, the preparation from the group of statines "Mevacor"<br>
(Lovastatine) manufactured by the firm Merck Sharp &amp; Dohn was used at dose 40 mg/kg.<br>
Cholesterol suspension was administered daily in the morning for 10 days. The compounds<br>
tested (at dose 500 µg/kg) and the reference preparation (at dose 40 mg/kg) were administered to<br>
the animals togester with cholesterol suspension for 10 days. All the animals received a standard<br>
briquetted forage.<br>
The animals were divided into the following groups:<br>
"Control" - intact animals (n=6);<br>
"Cholesterol" - rats that orally received cholesterol loading (n=10);<br>
" Lovastatine" - rats that orally received cholesterol loading and Lovastatine (n=10);<br>
"Compound IV" - rats that orally received cholesterol loading and the tested compound<br>
IV(n=10).<br>
Blood was sampled at days 5, 8 and 10 of the experiment.<br>
Statistical processing of the hypolipidemic action data of the tested substances was<br><br>
carried out with regard to the "Cholesterol" group (Table 13).<br>

Administering compound IV at dose 500 µg/kg resulted in a significant lowering serum<br>
total cholesterol by 19.5%, hepatic cholesterol by 22.7%, LDL cholesterol by 29.8% and hepatic<br>
triglycerides by 19%. The compound glutaryl histamine, by lowering total cholesterol level only<br>
by 9%, exerted effect only on LDL and VLDL (low and very; low density lipoproteins) that is<br>
shown in the publication of the International application WO 99/01103, and it is apparently less<br>
efficient than compound IV in a similar, biological experiment.<br>
The study results of the other claimed compounds are presented below.<br>
Experimental groups included:<br>
1)	"Cholesterol" -rats orally administered with oily cholesterol suspension for 10 days;<br>
2)	"Compound IV" -rats orally administered with oily cholesterol suspension and the<br>
tested compound IV;<br><br>
31<br>
3)	"Compound IV - INa" - rats orally administered with oily cholesterol suspension and<br>
the tested mono-sodium salt of compound IV;<br>
4)	"Compound IV - 2Na" - rats orally administered with oily cholesterol suspension and<br>
the tested di-sodium salt of compound IV;<br>
5)	"Compound V - INa" -rats orally administered with oily cholesterol suspension and<br>
the tested mono-sodium salt of the compound V;<br>
6)	"Compound III - INa" -rats orally administered with oily cholesterol suspension and<br>
the tested mono-sodium salt of the compound III;<br>
7)	"Compound II - INa" -rats orally administered with oily cholesterol suspension and<br>
the tested mono-sodium salt of the compound II;<br>
8)	"Sim" - rats orally administered with oily cholesterol suspension and Simvastatine;<br>
9)	control - intact rats before beginning the test.<br>
At day 10 of the test blood samples were taken following decapitation of the animals.<br>
The animals fasted for 12 hours prior to decapitation.<br>
Blood serum total cholesterol, triglycerides and high density lipoprotein cholesterol<br>
(HDLC) were measured. Low and very low density lipoprotein cholesterol was calculated by the<br>
difference between total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol.<br>
Blood serum total cholesterol and triglycerides were determined using the enzymatic<br>
methods.<br>
Cholesterol level in high density lipoproteins (α-LP) was determined using the<br>
precipitation method of LDL and VLDL with phosphotungstic acid and magnesium ions.<br>
Statistical processing<br>
Data in the tables are presented as a mean value ± standard error. Significance of<br>
differences between the groups "cholesterol" and "preparation..." was assessed by the two-<br>
sampled Student's t-test. Error probability (p) is indicated in the table graphs.<br>
The data on the effect of the compounds on blood serum cholesterol and triglyceride<br>
levels of rats that received cholesterol loading are presented in Tables 14 to 21.<br><br><br><br>
10-day administering oily cholesterol suspension to rats resulted in a significant 2,3-fold<br>
rise in serum cholesterol level and in 1.9-fold rise in triglyceride levels. In the development of<br>
induced hyperlipidemia, HDL cholesterol lowered by 15%. 5-fold rise in LDL+VLDL<br>
cholesterol was observed. 2.3-fold rise in LDL+VLDL triglycerides was observed.<br>
Table 15<br>
Blood serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels (nig/100 ml) in rats at day 5 of the experiment<br><br><br>
33<br><br><br><br><br>
35<br><br><br><br>
Administering a mono-sodium salt of compound III to the animals significantly lowered<br>
total cholesterol (CH) by 29% and cholesterol of the VLDL+LDL fractions by 40%, but it did<br><br>
37<br>
not change the level of CH of serum anti-atherogenic HDL and total triglycerides.<br>
The results obtained suggest that mono- and di-sodium salts were superior over<br>
compound IV by action dynamics on serum total cholesterol and LDL+VLDL cholesterol and<br>
other parameters of lipid metabolism. Whereas by day 10 of the experiment, a significant and<br>
comparable lowering the mentioned parameters occurred under the effect of all the compounds<br>
mentioned above and the reference preparation "Zokor" (Simvastatine), salt of compound IV<br>
begun action at earlier terms of the experiment (by days 5 and 8). The both sodium salts of<br>
compound IV elevated HDL already by day 5 of the experiment, whereas compound IV elevated<br>
this parameter only by day 8. The reference preparation Simvastatine did not effect HDL<br>
cholesterol. Furthermore, disodium salt of compound IV lowered serum total triglyceride levels<br>
at days 5 and 10 of the experiment.<br>
A distinguishing feature of the compound V mono-sodium salt was the ability thereof to<br>
lower serum total triglyceride levels, whereas lowering total cholesterol and VLDP cholesterol<br>
levels and rise in HDL level were lower than in the compound III and compound IV mono-<br>
sodium salts.<br>
Thus, as compared to the activity of the compounds disclosed in the publication of<br>
International application WO 99/01103, and the compounds proposed in the instant invention,<br>
salts of the compounds II, III, IV and V possess enhanced hypolipidemic activity including the<br>
capability of lowering serum triglyceride, total cholesterol levels including LDL cholesterol level<br>
and elevating HDL cholesterol.<br>
Example 19<br>
Study of hypolipidemic effect of compounds of general formula I on the model of<br>
"endogenous" hypercholesterolemia in guinea pigs<br>
The study was carried out on male guinea pigs (Aguti line) weighing 304±25 g. The<br>
experiment lasted 31 days. The control group included 6 guinea pigs (intact animals). The<br>
compounds studied were administered from day 1 of the experiment (from day 1 of<br>
administering fat loading).<br>
The animals of experimental groups received orally for 31 days a compound studied and<br>
fat loading. The compound studied at doses indicated below was administered in the form of an<br>
aqueous solution (0.5 ml per an animal); fat loading (a mixture of porcine fat and preliminary<br>
heated corn oil at 4:1 ratio by volume, at the rate of 5 ml/kg weight 0.5 h post administering the<br>
substance studied.<br>
Experimental groups:<br>
1)	"control" - intact animals;<br>
2)	"fat"- animals that received fat loading only;<br><br>
38<br>
3)	"compound IV" - animals that received fat loading + compound IV at dose 500 fig/kg<br>
body weight;<br>
4)	"compound V" - animals that received fat loading + compound V at dose 500 µg/kg<br>
body weight.<br>
The data on blood serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels in guinea pigs that received<br>
fat loading and the compounds studied, are presented in Tables 22 to 25.<br><br><br>
39<br>
Table 24<br>
Total cholesterol level in lipoprotein fractions at day 31 of blood serum guinea pigs that<br>
received fat loading and the compounds studied<br><br><br>
The studied compounds IV and V significantly lowered total cholesterol level by 33.9<br>
and 37.8% respectively only by day 31 of the experiment At the same time, they significantly<br>
lowered LDL cholesterol by 37.7 and 38%.<br><br><br>
Fig. 1. Change in serum total cholesterol level as effected by fat loading and different<br>
doses (50-1,500 µg/kg) of compound IV. Thin vertical lines indicate standard deviation from the<br>
mean value.<br>
Advantage of the claimed compounds, in particular compound IV, is a broad range of<br>
acting doses that provides for broadness of therapeutic effect thereof. Thus, for example,<br>
compound IV was practically similarly effective in lowering total cholesterol level during 20<br>
days at interval of doses from 50 to 1,500 µg/kg differing 30-fold.<br>
Thus, the claimed compounds corresponding to general formula I possess a significant<br>
hypolipidemic activity considerably improving the lipid metabolism parameters in blood serum<br>
and in the liver.<br>
Example 20<br>
Study of anti-inflammatory action of compounds of general formula I on the model of<br>
carrageenan rat paw edema<br>
The experiments were performed on white outbred male rats weighing 250 g. A total<br>
amount of animals per an experiment was 12.<br>
The model of carrageenan-induced edema according to the method of Winter et al. was<br>
used (Winter et al. Studies of the mediators of the acute inflammatory response induced in rats in<br>
different sites by carrageenan and turpentine.//J.Phamacol. 1971. V.I04. P. 15-29). 0.1 ml 1%<br>
carrageenan solution (SERVA) was subplantarly injected into the right rat paw. The animals<br>
were placed into individual chambers. Gel (1%) comprising a substance tested was applied on<br>
the paw three times: immediately following carrageenan administration, ate 1 and 2 hours post<br><br>
41<br>
administration. 4 hours post administration of carrageenan, paw volumes were measured using a<br>
plethysmograph (Ugo Basile) Therapeutic effect of the gel was assessed by inhibition degree of<br>
inflammatory reaction in comparison with the intact left paw of the given animal and rat paw<br>
reaction of the control (untreated) group. Inflammatory reaction inhibition expressed in percent,<br>
was calculated according to the formula:<br><br>
The tested compounds VI and XIII in the form of 1% gel caused inhibition of edema by<br>
44% and 40%, respectively, and the reference preparation diclofenac (1% gel) inhibited edema<br>
by 62%.<br>
