				<td>HUMAN EPO MIMETIC HINGE CORE MIMETIBODIES, COMPOSITIONS, METHODS AND USES<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to mammalian EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibodies, specified portions and variants specific for bologically active proteins, fragment or ligands, EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody encoding and complementary nucleic acids, host cells, and methods of making and using thereof, including therapeutic formulations, administration and devices.<br>
RELATED ART<br>
Recombinant proteins are an emerging class of therapeutic agents. Such recombinant therapeutics have engendered advances in protein formulation and chemical modification. Such modifications can potentially enhance the therapeutic utility of therapeutic proteins, such as by increaseing half lives (e.g., by blocking their exposure to proteolytic enzymes), enhancing biological activity, or reducing unwanted side effects. One such modification is the use of immunoglobulin fragments fused to receptor proteins, such as enteracept. Therapeutic proteins have also been constructed using the Fc domain to attempt to provide a longer half-life or to incorporate functions such as Fc receptor binding, protein A binding, and complement fixation. One specific and vital role of the mammalian hematopoietic system is the production of erythrocytes, or red blood cells, which transport oxygen to the various tissues of the animal's body. The process of producing erythrocytes ("erythropoiesis") occurs continuously throughout an animal's life span to offset erythrocyte destruction. The typical red blood cell has a relatively short life-span, usually 100 to 120 days. Erythropoiesis is a precisely controlled physiological mechanism whereby sufficient numbers of erythrocytes are produced to enable proper tissue oxygenation, but not so many as to impede circulation.<br>
Erythropoiesis is now known to be primarily controlled by the polypeptide erythropoietin (EPO), an acidic glycoprotein. Erythropoietin is produced as the result of the expression of a single copy gene located in a chromosome of a mammal. The amino acid<br>
CEN5039NP	1<br><br>
sequence for recombinant human EPO ("rHuEPO") is substantially identical to the amino acid sequence for EPO obtained from human urinary sources. However, the glycosylation of rHuEPO differs from that of urinary EPO and human serum EPO.<br>
In a healthy mammal, EPO is present in the blood plasma in very low concentrations, as the tissues are being sufficiently oxygenated by the existing number of circulating erythrocytes. The EPO present stimulates the production of new erythrocytes to replace those lost to the aging process. Additionally, EPO production is stimulated under conditions of hypoxia, wherein the oxygen supply to the body's tissues is reduced below normal physiological levels despite adequate perfusion of the tissue by blood. Hypoxia may be caused by hemorrhaging, radiation-induced erythrocyte destruction, various anemias, high altitude, or long periods of unconsciousness. In contrast, should the number of red blood cells in circulation exceed what is needed for normal tissue oxygenation, EPO production is reduced.<br>
However, certain disease states involve abnormal erythropoiesis. Recombinant human EPO (rHuEPO) is being used therapeutically in a number of countries. In the United States, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved rHuEPO's use in treating anemia associated with end-stage renal disease. Patients undergoing hemodialysis to treat this disorder typically suffer severe anemia, caused by the rupture and premature death of erythrocytes as a result of the dialysis treatment. EPO is also useful in the treatment of other types of anemia. For instance, chemotherapy-induced anemia, anemia associated with myelodysplasia, those associated with various congenital disorders, AIDS-related anemia, and prematurity-associated anemia, may be treated with EPO. Additionally, EPO may play a role in other areas, such as helping to more quickly restore a normal hematocrit in bone marrow transplantation patients, in patients preparing for autologous blood transfusions, and in patients suffering from iron overload disorders.<br>
Erythropoietin (EPO) is a glycoprotein hormone composed of 165 amino acids and four carbohydrate chains that functions as the primary regulator of erythropoiesis by binding to a specific receptor on the surface of erythrocyte precursor cells. This binding signals their proliferation and differentiation into mature red blood cells. The erythropoietin receptor is a 484-amino acid glycoprotein with high affinity for erythropoietin. For the erythropoietin receptor, ligand-induced homodimerization may be one of the key event that governs activation.<br>
Erythropoietin has a relatively short half-life. Intravenously administered erythropoietin is eliminated at a rate consistent with first order kinetics with a circulating half-life ranging from approximately 3 to 4 hours in patients with CRF. Within the therapeutic dose range, detectable levels of plasma erythropoietin are maintained for at least 24 hours. After<br>
CEN5039NP	2<br><br>
subcutaneous administration of erythropoietin, peak serum levels are achieved within 5-24 hours and decline slowly thereafter.<br>
Small peptidomimetics of erythropoietin were identified by several groups through screening of random phage display peptide libraries for affinity to the erythropoietin receptor. These sequences have no homology with erythropoietin. In functional assays several of these peptides showed activity, but only l/100,000th that of recombinant erythropoietin. Although several attempts have been made to increase the potency of these peptides by preparing covalent dimers or multimers of peptidomimetics, these compounds are still 1,000 - 10,000 fold less active than erythropoietin on a molar basis and have very short half lives that has made them not suitable for use as therapeutics.<br>
Accordingly, there is a need to provide improved and/or modified versions of EPO therapeutic proteins, which overcome one more of these and other problems known in the art.<br>

where V is at least one portion of an N-terminus of an immunoglobulin variable region, P is at least one bioactive peptide, L is polypeptide that provides structural flexablity by allowing the mimietibody to have alternative orientations and binding properties, H is at least a portion of an immunoglobulin variable hinge region, CH2 is at least a portion of an immunoglobulin CH2 constant region, CH3 is at least a portion of an immunoglobulin CH3 constant region, m, n, o, p, q, r, and s can be independently an integer between 0, 1 or 2 and 10, mimicing different types of immunoglobulin molecules, e.g., but not limited to IgGl, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA, IgM, IgD, IgE, and the like, or combination thereof. The monomer where m=l can be linked to other monomers by association or covalent linkage, such as, but not limited to, a Cys-Cys disulfide bond or other immnuoglobulin sequence. EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody of the present invention mimics an antibody structure with its inherent properties and functions, while providing a therapeutic peptide and its inherent or acquired in vitro, in vivo or in situ properties or activities. The various portions of the antibody and therapeutic peptide portions of at least one EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody of the present invention can vary as described herein in combinatoin with what is known in the art.<br>

CEN5039NP	13<br><br>
Mimetibodies useful in the methods and compositions of the present invention are characterized by suitable affinity binding to protein ligands or receptors and optionally and preferably having low toxicity. In particular, an EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody, where the individual components, such as the portion of variable region, constant region (without a CHI portion) and framework, or any portion thereof (e.g., a portion of the J, D or V rgions of the variable heavy or light chain; at least a portion of at least one hinge region, the constant heavy chain or light chain, and the like) individually and/or collectively optionally and preferably possess low immunogenicity, is useful in the present invention. The mimetibodies that can be used in the invention are optionally characterized by their ability to treat patients for extended periods with good to excellent alleviation of symptoms and low toxicity. Low immunogenicity and/or high affinity, as well as other undefined properties, may contribute to the therapeutic results achieved. "Low immunogenicity" is defined herein as raising significant HAM A, HACA or HAHA responses in less than about 75%, or preferably less than about 50, 45, 40, 35, 30, 35, 20, 15, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and/or 1 % of the patients treated and/or raising low titres in the patient treated (less than about 300, preferably less than about 100 measured with a double antigen enzyme immunoassay) (see, e.g., Elliott et al., Lancet 344:1125-1127(1994)).<br>
Utility<br>
The isolated nucleic acids of the present invention can be used for production of at least<br>
one EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody, fragment or specified variant thereof, which can be used to effect in an cell, tissue, organ or animal (including mammals and humans), to modulate, treat, alleviate, help prevent the incidence of, or reduce the symptoms of, at least one protein related condition, selected from, but not limited to, at least one of an immune disorder or disease, a cardiovascular disorder or disease, an infectious, malignant, and/or neurologic disorder or disease, a(n) anemia; a(n) immune/autoimmune; and/or a(n) cancer/infecteous, as well as other known or specified protein related conditions.<br>

Mimetibodies of the Present Invention<br>
The EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody can optionally comprise at least one CH3 region directly linked with at least one CH2 region directly linked with at least one portion of at lesat one hinge region fragment (H) such as comprising at least one core hinge region, directly linked with an optional linker sequence (L), directly linked to at least one therapeutic peptide (P), optionally further directly linked with at least a portion of at least one variable antibody sequence (V). In a preferred embodiment a pair of a CH3-CH2-H-L-V, the pair linked by association or covalent linkage Thus, an EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody of the present invention mimics an antibody structure with its inherent properties and functions, while providing a therapeutic peptide and its inherent or acquired in vitro, in vivo or in situ properties or activities. The various portions of the antibody and therapeutic peptide portions of at least one EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody of the present invention can vary as described herein in combinatoin with what is known in the art.<br>
Mimetibodies of the present invention thus provide at least one suitable property as compared to known proteins, such as, but not limited to, at least one of increased half-life, increased activity, more specific activity, increased avidity, increased or descrease off rate, a selected or more suitable subset of activities, less immungenicity, increased quality or duration of at least one desired therapeutic effect, less side effects, and the like.<br>
Fragments of mimetibodies according to Formula (I) can be produced by enzymatic cleavage, synthetic or recombinant techniques, as known in the art and/or as described herein. Mimetibodies can also be produced in a variety of truncated forms using antibody genes in which one or more stop codons have been introduced upstream of the natural stop site. The various portions of mimetibodies can be joined together chemically by conventional<br>
CEN5039NP	15<br><br>
techniques, or can be prepared as a contiguous protein using genetic engineering techniques. For example, a nucleic acid encoding at least one of the constant regions of a human antibody chain can be expressed to produce a contiguous protein for use in mimetibodies of the present invention. See, e.g., Ladner et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,946,778 and Bird, R.E. et al., Science, 242: 423-426 (1988), regarding single chain antibodies.<br>
As used herein, the term "human mimetibody" refers to an antibody in which substantially every part of the protein (e.g., EPO mimetic peptide, framework, CL, CH domains (e.g., CH2, CH3), hinge, (VL, VH)) is expected to be substantially non-immunogenic in humans with only minor sequence changes or variations. Such changes or variations optionally and preferably retain or reduce the immunogenicity in humans relative to non-modified human antibodies, or mimetibodies of the prsent invention. Thus, a human antibody and corresponding EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody of the present invention is distinct from a chimeric or humanized antibody. It is pointed out that a human antibody and EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody can be produced by a non-human animal or cell that is capable of expressing human immunoglobulins (e.g., heavy chain and/or light chain) genes.<br>
Human mimetibodies that are specific for at least one protein ligand or receptor thereof can be designed against an appropriate ligand, such as isolated and/or EPO protein receptor or ligand, or a portion thereof (including synthetic molecules, such as synthetic peptides). Preparation of such mimetibodies are performed using known techniques to identify and characterize ligand binding regions or sequences of at least one protein or portion thereof.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, at least one EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant of the present invention is produced by at least one cell line, mixed cell line, immortalized cell or clonal population of immortalized and/or cultured cells. Immortalized protein producing cells can be produced using suitable methods. Preferably, the at least one EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant is generated by providing nucleic acid or vectors comprising DNA derived or having a substantially similar sequence to, at least one human immunoglobulin locus that is functionally rearranged, or which can undergo functional rearrangement, and which further comprises a mimetibody structure as described herein, e.g., but not limited to Formula (I), wherein portions of C- and N-terminal variable regions can be used for V, hinge regions for H, CH2 for CH2 and CH3 for CH3, as known in the art.<br>
The term "functionally rearranged," as used herein refers to a segment of nucleic acid from an immunoglobulin locus that has undergone V(D)J recombination, thereby producing an immunoglobulin gene that encodes an immunoglobulin chain (e.g., heavy chain), or any portion thereof. A functionally rearranged immunoglobulin gene can be directly or indirectly<br>
CEN5039NP	16<br><br>
identified using suitable methods, such as, for example, nucleotide sequencing, hybridization (e.g., Southern blotting, Northern blotting) using probes that can anneal to coding joints between gene segments or enzymatic amplification of immunoglobulin genes (e.g., polymerase chain reaction) with primers that can anneal to coding joints between gene segments. Whether a cell produces an EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or portion or variant comprising a particular variable region or a variable region comprising a particular sequence (e.g., at least one P sequence) can also be determined using suitable methods.<br>
Mimetibodies, specified portions and variants of the present invention can also be prepared using at least one EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant encoding nucleic acid to provide transgenic animals or mammals, such as goats, cows, horses, sheep, and the like, that produce such mimetibodies or specified portions or variants in their milk. Such animals can be provided using known methods as applied for antibody encoding sequences. See, e.g., but not limited to, US patent nos. 5,827,690; 5,849,992; 4,873,316; 5,849,992; 5,994,616; 5,565,362; 5,304,489, and the like, each of which is entirely incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Mimetibodies, specified portions and variants of the present invention can additionally be prepared using at least one EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant encoding nucleic acid to provide transgenic plants and cultured plant cells (e.g., but not limited to tobacco and maize) that produce such mimetibodies, specified portions or variants in the plant parts or in cells cultured therefrom. As a non-limiting example, transgenic tobacco leaves expressing recombinant proteins have been successfully used to provide large amounts of recombinant proteins, e.g., using an inducible promoter. See, e.g., Cramer et al., Curr. Top. Microbol. Immunol. 240:95-118 (1999) and references cited therein. Also, transgenic maize or corn have been used to express mammalian proteins at commercial production levels, with biological activities equivalent to those produced in other recombinant systems or purified from natural sources. See, e.g., Hood et al., Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 464:127-147 (1999) and references cited therein. Antibodies have also been produced in large amounts from transgenic plant seeds including antibody fragments, such as single chain mimetibodies (scFv's), including tobacco seeds and potato tubers. See, e.g., Conrad et al., Plant Mol. Biol. 38:101-109 (1998) and references cited therein. Thus, mimetibodies, specified portions and variants of the present invention can also be produced using transgenic plants, according to know methods. See also, e.g., Fischer et al, Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 30:99-108 (Oct., 1999), Ma et al., Trends Biotechnol. 13:522-7 (1995); Ma et al. Plant Physiol. 109:341-6 (1995); Whitelam et al, Biochem. Soc. Trans. 22:940-944 (1994); and references cited therein. The above references are entirely incorporated herein by reference.<br>
CEN5039NP	17<br><br>
The mimetibodies of the invention can bind human protein ligands with a wide range of affinities (KD). In a preferred embodiment, at least one human EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody of the present invention can optionally bind at least one protein ligand with high affinity. For example, at least one EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody of the present invention can bind at least one protein ligand with a KD equal to or less than about 10-7 M or, more preferably, with a KD equal to or less than about 0.1-9.9 (or any range or value therein) X 10-7, 10-8, 10-9, 10-10, 10-11, 10-12, or 10-13M, or any range or value therein.<br>
The affinity or avidity of an EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody for at least one protein ligand can be determined experimentally using any suitable method, e.g., as used for determing antibody-antigen binding affinity or avidity. (See, for example, Berzofsky, et al, "Antibody-Antigen Interactions," In Fundamental Immunology, Paul, W. E., Ed., Raven Press: New York, NY (1984); Kuby, Janis Immunology, W. H. Freeman and Company: New York, NY (1992); and methods described herein). The measured affinity of a particular EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody-Iigand interaction can vary if measured under different conditions (e.g., salt concentration, pH). Thus, measurements of affinity and other ligand-binding parameters (e.g., KD, Ka, Kd) are preferably made with standardized solutions of EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody and ligand, and a standardized buffer, such as the buffer described herein<br>
 Nucleic Acid Molecules<br>
Using the information provided herein, such as the nucleotide sequences encoding at least 90-100% of the contiguous amino acids of at least one of SEQ ID NOS:1-30 as well as at least one portion of an antibody, wherein the above sequences are inserted as the P sequence of Formula (I) to provide an EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody of the present invention, further comprising specified fragments, variants or consensus sequences thereof, or a deposited vector comprising at least one of these sequences, a nucleic acid molecule of the present invention encoding at least one EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant can be obtained using methods described herein or as known in the art.<br>
Nucleic acid molecules of the present invention can be in the form of RNA, such as mRNA, hnRNA, tRNA or any other form, or in the form of DNA, including, but not limited to, cDNA and genomic DNA obtained by cloning or produced synthetically, or any combination thereof. The DNA can be triple-stranded, double-stranded or single-stranded, or any combination thereof. Any portion of at least one strand of the DNA or RNA can be the coding strand, also known as the sense strand, or it can be the non-coding strand, also referred to as the anti-sense strand.<br>
CEN5039NP	18<br><br>
Isolated nucleic acid molecules of the present invention can include nucleic acid molecules comprising an open reading frame (ORF), optionally with one or more introns, nucleic acid molecules comprising the coding sequence for an EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant; and nucleic acid molecules which comprise a nucleotide sequence substantially different from those described above but which, due to the degeneracy of the genetic code, still encode at least one EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody as described herein and/or as known in the art. Of course, the genetic code is well known in the art. Thus, it would be routine for one skilled in the art to generate such degenerate nucleic acid variants that code for specific EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variants of the present invention. See, e.g., Ausubel, et al., supra, and such nucleic acid variants are included in the present invention.<br>
As indicated herein, nucleic acid molecules of the present invention which comprise a nucleic acid encoding an EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant can include, but are not limited to, those encoding the amino acid sequence of an EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody fragment, by itself; the coding sequence for the entire EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or a portion thereof; the coding sequence for an EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody, fragment or portion, as well as additional sequences, such as the coding sequence of at least one signal leader or fusion peptide, with or without the aforementioned additional coding sequences, such as at least one intron, together with additional, non-coding sequences, including but not limited to, non-coding 5' and 3' sequences, such as the transcribed, non-translated sequences that play a role in transcription, mRNA processing, including splicing and polyadenylation signals (for example - ribosome binding and stability of mRNA); an additional coding sequence that codes for additional amino acids, such as those that provide additional functionalities. Thus, the sequence encoding an EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant can be fused to a marker sequence, such as a sequence encoding a peptide that facilitates purification of the fused EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant comprising an EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody fragment or portion. Polynucleotides Which Selectively Hybridize to a Polynucleotide as Described Herein<br>
The present invention provides isolated nucleic acids that hybridize under selective hybridization conditions to a polynucleotide disclosed herein, or others disclosed herein, including specified variants or portions thereof. Thus, the polynucleotides of this embodiment can be used for isolating, detecting, and/or quantifying nucleic acids comprising such polynucleotides.<br>
CEN5039NP	19<br><br>
Low or moderate stringency hybridization conditions are typically, but not exclusively, employed with sequences having a reduced sequence identity relative to complementary sequences. Moderate and high stringency conditions can optionally be employed for sequences of greater identity. Low stringency conditions allow selective hybridization of sequences having about 40-99% sequence identity and can be employed to identify orthologous or paralogous sequences.<br>
Optionally, polynucleotides of this invention will encode at least a portion of an EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant encoded by the polynucleotides described herein. The polynucleotides of this invention embrace nucleic acid sequences that can be employed for selective hybridization to a polynucleotide encoding an EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant of the present invention. See, e.g., Ausubel, supra; Colligan, supra, each entirely incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Construction of Nucleic Acids<br>
The isolated nucleic acids of the present invention can be made using (a) recombinant methods, (b) synthetic techniques, (c) purification techniques, or combinations thereof, as well-known in the art.<br>
The nucleic acids can conveniently comprise sequences in addition to a polynucleotide of the present invention. For example, a multi-cloning site comprising one or more endonuclease restriction sites can be inserted into the nucleic acid to aid in isolation of the polynucleotide. Also, translatable sequences can be inserted to aid in the isolation of the translated polynucleotide of the present invention. For example, a hexa-histidine marker sequence provides a convenient means to purify the proteins of the present invention. The nucleic acid of the present invention -excluding the coding sequence - is optionally a vector, adapter, or linker for cloning and/or expression of a polynucleotide of the present invention.<br>
Additional sequences can be added to such cloning and/or expression sequences to optimize their function in cloning and/or expression, to aid in isolation of the polynucleotide, or to improve the introduction of the polynucleotide into a cell. Use of cloning vectors, expression vectors, adapters, and linkers is well known in the art. See, e.g., Ausubel, supra; or Sambrook, supra<br>
 Recombinant Methods for Constructing Nucleic Acids<br>
The isolated nucleic acid compositions of this invention, such as RNA, cDNA, genomic DNA, or any combination thereof, can be obtained from biological sources using any number of cloning methodologies known to those of skill in the art. In some embodiments, oligonucleotide probes that selectively hybridize, under suitable stringency conditions, to the polynucleotides of the present invention are used to identify the desired sequence in a cDNA or genomic DNA<br>
CEN5039NP	20<br><br>
library. The isolation of RNA, and construction of cDNA and genomic libraries, is well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. (See, e.g., Ausubel, supra; or Sambrook, supra)<br>
 Synthetic Methods for Constructing Nucleic Acids<br>
The isolated nucleic acids of the present invention can also be prepared by direct chemical synthesis by known methods (see, e.g., Ausubel, et al., supra). Chemical synthesis generally produces a single-stranded oligonucleotide, which can be converted into double-stranded DNA by hybridization with a complementary sequence, or by polymerization with a DNA polymerase using the single strand as a template. One of skill in the art will recognize that while chemical synthesis of DNA can be limited to sequences of about 100 or more bases, longer sequences can be obtained by the ligation of shorter sequences.<br>
Recombinant Expression Cassettes<br>
The present invention further provides recombinant expression cassettes comprising a nucleic acid of the present invention. A nucleic acid sequence of the present invention, for example a cDNA or a genomic sequence encoding an EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant of the present invention, can be used to construct a recombinant expression cassette that can be introduced into at least one desired host cell. A recombinant expression cassette will typically comprise a polynucleotide of the present invention operably linked to transcriptional initiation regulatory sequences that will direct the transcription of the polynucleotide in the intended host cell. Both heterologous and non-heterologous (i.e., endogenous) promoters can be employed to direct expression of the nucleic acids of the present invention.<br>
In some embodiments, isolated nucleic acids that serve as promoter, enhancer, or other elements can be introduced in the appropriate position (upstream, downstream or in intron) of a non-heterologous form of a polynucleotide of the present invention so as to up or down regulate expression of a polynucleotide of the present invention. For example, endogenous promoters can be altered in vivo or in vitro by mutation, deletion and/or substitution, as known in the art. A polynucleotide of the present invention can be expressed in either sense or anti-sense orientation as desired. It will be appreciated that control of gene expression in either sense or anti-sense orientation can have a direct impact on the observable characteristics. Another method of suppression is sense suppression. Introduction of nucleic acid configured in the sense orientation has been shown to be an effective means by which to block the transcription of target genes. Vectors And Host Cells<br>
The present invention also relates to vectors that include isolated nucleic acid molecules of the present invention, host cells that are genetically engineered with the recombinant vectors, and the production of at least one EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or<br>
CEN5039NP	21<br><br>
specified portion or variant by recombinant techniques, as is well known in the art. See, e.g., Sambrook, et al., supra; Ausubel, et al., supra, each entirely incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The polynucleotides can optionally be joined to a vector containing a selectable marker for propagation in a host. Generally, a plasmid vector is introduced into a cell using suitable known methods, such as electroporation and the like, other known methods include the use of the vector as a precipitate, such as a calcium phosphate precipitate, or in a complex with a charged lipid. If the vector is a virus, it can be packaged in vitro using an appropriate packaging cell line and then transduced into host cells.<br>
The DNA insert should be operatively linked to an appropriate promoter. The expression constructs will further contain sites optionally for at least one of transcription initiation, termination and, in the transcribed region, a ribosome binding site for translation. The coding portion of the mature transcripts expressed by the constructs will preferably include a translation initiating at the beginning and a termination codon (e.g., UAA, UGA or UAG) appropriately positioned at the end of the mRNA to be translated, with UAA and UAG preferred for mammalian or eukaryotic cell expression.<br>
Expression vectors will preferably but optionally include at least one selectable marker. Such markers include, e.g., but not limited to, methotrexate (MTX), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR, US Pat.Nos. 4,399,216; 4,634,665; 4,656,134; 4,956,288; 5,149,636; 5,179,017, ampicillin, neomycin (G418), mycophenolic acid, or glutamine synthetase (GS, US Pat.Nos. 5,122,464; 5,770,359; 5,827,739) resistance for eukaryotic cell culture, and tetracycline or ampicillin resistance genes for culturing in E. coli and other bacteria or prokaryotics (the above patents are entirely incorporated hereby by reference). Appropriate culture mediums and conditions for the above-described host cells are known in the art. Suitable vectors will be readily apparent to the skilled artisan. Introduction of a vector construct into a host cell can be effected by calcium phosphate transfection, DEAE-dextran mediated transfection, cationic lipid-mediated transfection, electroporation, transduction, infection or other known methods. Such methods are described in the art, such as Sambrook, supra, Chapters 1-4 and 16-18; Ausubel, supra, Chapters 1, 9, 13, 15, 16.<br>
At least one EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant of the present invention can be expressed in a modified form, such as a fusion protein, and can include not only secretion signals, but also additional heterologous functional regions. For instance, a region of additional amino acids, particularly charged amino acids, can be added to the N-terminus of an EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant to improve stability and persistence in the host cell, during purification, or during subsequent handling and storage. Also, peptide moieties can be added to an EPO mimetic hinge core<br>
CEN5039NP	22<br><br>
mimetibody or specified portion or variant of the present invention to facilitate purification. Such regions can be removed prior to final preparation of an EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or at least one fragment thereof. Such methods are described in many standard laboratory manuals, such as Sambrook, supra, Chapters 17.29-17.42 and 18.1-18.74; Ausubel, supra, Chapters 16, 17 and 18.<br>
Those of ordinary skill in the art are knowledgeable in the numerous expression systems available for expression of a nucleic acid encoding a protein of the present invention.<br>
Illustrative of cell cultures useful for the production of the mimetibodies, specified portions or variants thereof, are mammalian cells. Mammalian cell systems often will be in the form of monolayers of cells although mammalian cell suspensions or bioreactors can also be used. A number of suitable host cell lines capable of expressing intact glycosylated proteins have been developed in the art, and include the COS-1 (e.g., ATCC CRL 1650), COS-7 (e.g., ATCC CRL-1651), HEK293, BHK21 (e.g., ATCC CRL-10), CHO (e.g., ATCC CRL 1610, DG-44) and BSC-1 (e.g., ATCC CRL-26) cell lines, hepG2 cells, P3X63Ag8.653, SP2/0-Agl4, 293 cells, HeLa cells and the like, which are readily available from, for example, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Va. Preferred host cells include cells of lymphoid origin such as myeloma and lymphoma cells. Particularly preferred host cells are P3X63Ag8.653 cells (ATCC Accession Number CRL-1580) and SP2/0-Agl4 cells (ATCC Accession Number CRL-1851).<br>
Expression vectors for these cells can include one or more of the following expression control sequences, such as, but not limited to an origin of replication; a promoter (e.g., late or early SV40 promoters, the CMV promoter (e.g., US Pat.Nos. 5,168,062; 5,385,839), an HSV tk promoter, a pgk (phosphoglycerate kinase) promoter, an EF-1 alpha promoter (e.g, US Pat.No. 5,266,491), at least one human immunoglobulin promoter; an enhancer, and/or processing information sites, such as ribosome binding sites, RNA splice sites, polyadenylation sites (e.g., an SV40 large T Ag poly A addition site), and transcriptional terminator sequences. See, e.g., Ausubel et al., supra; Sambrook, et al., supra. Other cells useful for production of nucleic acids or proteins of the present invention are known and/or available, for instance, from the American Type Culture Collection Catalogue of Cell Lines and Hybridomas (www.atcc.org) or other known or commercial sources.<br>
When eukaryotic host cells are employed, polyadenlyation or transcription terminator sequences are typically incorporated into the vector. An example of a terminator sequence is the polyadenlyation sequence from the bovine growth hormone gene. Sequences for accurate splicing of the transcript can also be included. An example of a splicing sequence is the VP1<br>
CEN5039NP	23<br><br>
intron from SV40 (Sprague, et al., J. Virol. 45:773-781 (1983)). Additionally, gene sequences to control replication in the host cell can be incorporated into the vector, as known in the art. Purification of an EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant Thereof<br>
An EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant can be recovered and purified from recombinant cell cultures by well-known methods including, but not limited to, protein A purification, ammonium sulfate or ethanol precipitation, acid extraction, anion or cation exchange chromatography, phosphocellulose chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, affinity chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography and lectin chromatography. High performance liquid chromatography ("HPLC") can also be employed for purification. See, e.g., Colligan, Current Protocols in Immunology, or Current Protocols in Protein Science, John Wiley &amp; Sons, NY, NY, (1997-2003), e.g., Chapters 1, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, each entirely incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Mimetibodies or specified portions or variants of the present invention include naturally purified products, products of chemical synthetic procedures, and products produced by recombinant techniques from a eukaryotic host, including, for example, yeast, higher plant, insect and mammalian cells. Depending upon the host employed in a recombinant production procedure, the EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant of the present invention can be glycosylated or can be non-glycosylated, with glycosylated preferred. Such methods are described in many standard laboratory manuals, such as Sambrook, supra, Sections 17.37-17.42; Ausubel, supra, Chapters 10, 12, 13, 16, 18 and 20, Colligan, Protein Science, supra, Chapters 12-14, all entirely incorporated herein by reference.<br>
MIMETIBODIES, SPECIFIED FRAGMENTS AND/OR VARIANTS<br>
The isolated mimetibodies of the present invention comprise an EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant encoded by any one of the polynucleotides of the present invention as discussed more fully herein, or any isolated or prepared EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant thereof.<br>
Preferably, the EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or ligand-binding portion or variant binds at least one EPO proteinliigand or receptor, and, thereby provides at least one EPO biological activity of the corresponding protein or a fragment thereof. Different therapeutically or diagnostically significant proteins are well known in the art and suitable assays or biological activities of such proteins are also well known in the art.<br>
Non-limiting examples of suitable EPO mimetic peptides for this invention<br>
CEN5039NP	24<br><br>

An EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody, or specified portion or variant thereof, that partially or preferably substantially provides at least one biological activity of at least one protein or fragment, can bind the protein or fragment ligand and thereby provide at least one activity that is otherwise mediated through the binding of protein to at least one protein ligand or receptor or through other protein-dependent or mediated mechanisms. As used herein, the term "EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody activity" refers to an EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody that can modulate or cause at least one protein-dependent activity by about 20-10,000%, preferably by at least about 60, 70, 80, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190,200,250,300,350,400,450,500,550,600,700, 800, 900, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, 6000, 7000, 8000, 9000 % or more depending on the assay.<br>
The capacity of an EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant to provide at least one protein-dependent activity is preferably assessed by at least one suitable protein biological assay, as described herein and/or as known in the art. A human EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant of the invention can be similar to any class (IgG, IgA, IgM, etc.) or isotype and can comprise at least a portion of a kappa or<br>
CEN5039NP	28<br><br>
lambda light chain. In one embodiment, the human EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant comprises an IgG heavy chain variable fragment, hinge region, CH2 and CH3 , for example, at least one of isotypes, IgGl, IgG2, IgG3 or lgG4.<br>
At least one EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant of the invention binds at least one specified ligand specific to at least one protein, subunit, fragment, portion or any combination thereof. The at least one EPO mimetic peptide of at least one EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody, specified portion or variant of the present invention can optionally bind at least one specified ligand epitope of the ligand. The binding epitope can comprise any combination of at least one amino acid sequence of at least 1-3 amino acids to the entire specified portion of contiguous amino acids of the sequences selected from the group consisting of a protein ligand, such as an EPO receptorz or portion thereof.<br>
Such mimetibodies can be prepared by joining together the various portions of Formula (I) of the EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody using known techniques, by preparing and expressing at least one (i.e., one or more) nucleic acid molecules that encode the EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody, using known techniques of recombinant DNA technology or by using any other suitable method, such as chemical synthesis.<br>
Mimetibodies that bind to human EPO ligands or receptors and that comprise at least a one portion defined heavy or light chain variable region can be prepared using suitable methods, such as phage display (Katsube, Y., et al, Int J Mol. Med, l(5):863-868 (1998)) or methods that employ transgenic animals, as known in the art and/or as described herein. The EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody, specified portion or variant can be expressed using the encoding nucleic acid or portion thereof in a suitable host cell.<br>
Preferably, such mimetibodies or ligand-binding fragments thereof can bind human EPO ligands or receptors with high affinity (e.g., KD less than or equal to about 10-7 M). Amino acid sequences that are substantially the same as the sequences described herein include sequences comprising conservative amino acid substitutions, as well as amino acid deletions and/or insertions. A conservative amino acid substitution refers to the replacement of a first amino acid by a second amino acid that has chemical and/or physical properties (e.g, charge, structure, polarity, hydrophobicity/ hydrophilicity) that are similar to those of the first amino acid. Conservative substitutions include replacement of one amino acid by another within the following groups: lysine (K), arginine (R) and histidine (H); aspartate (D) and glutamate (E); asparagine (N), glutamine (Q), serine (S), threonine (T), tyrosine (Y), K, R, H, D and E; alanine (A), valine (V), leucine (L), isoleucine (I), proline (P), phenylalanine (F). tryptophan (W), methionine (M), cysteine (C) and glycine (G); F, W and Y; C, S and T.<br>

Amino acids in an EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant of the present invention that are essential for function can be identified by methods known in the art, such as site-directed mutagenesis or alanine-scanning mutagenesis (e.g., Ausubel, supra, Chapters 8, 15; Cunningham and Wells, Science 244:1081-1085 (1989)). The latter procedure introduces single alanine mutations at every residue in the molecule. The resulting mutant molecules are then tested for biological activity, such as, but not limited to at least one protein related activity, as specified herein or as known in the art. Sites that are critical for EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant binding can also be identified by structural analysis such as crystallization, nuclear magnetic resonance or photoaffinity labeling (Smith, et al., J. Mol. Biol. 224:899-904 (1992) and de Vos, et al., Science 255:306-312 (1992)).<br>

An EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant can further optionally comprise at least one functional portion of at least one polypeptide as P portion of Formula (I), at least one of 90-100% of SEQ ID NOS:1-30. An EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody can further optionally comprise an amino acid sequence for the P portion of Formula (I), selected from one or more of SEQ ID NOS:1-30.<br>
In one embodiment, the P amino acid sequence, or portion thereof has about 90-100% identity (i.e., 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100 or any range or value therein) to the corresponding amino acid sequence of the corresponding portion of at least one of SEQ ID NOS: 1-30. Preferably, 90-100% amino acid identity (i.e., 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100 or any range or value therein) is determined using a suitable computer algorithm, as known in the art.<br>
Mimetibodies or specified portions or variants of the present invention can comprise any number of contiguous amino acid residues from an EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant of the present invention, wherein that number is selected from the group of integers consisting of from 10-100% of the number of contiguous residues in an EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody. Optionally, this subsequence of contiguous amino acids is at least about 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27, 28, 29, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190,200, 210, 220, 230, 240, 250 or more amino acids in length, or any range or value therein. Further, the number of such subsequences can be any integer selected from the group consisting of from 1 to 20, such as at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, or more.<br>
As those of skill will appreciate, the present invention includes at least one biologically active EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant of the present invention. Biologically active mimetibodies or specified portions or variants have a specific activity at least 20%, 30%, or 40%, and preferably at least 50%, 60%, or 70%, and most preferably at least 80%, 90%, or 95%-1000% of that of the native (non-synthetic), endogenous or related and known inserted or fused protein or specified portion or variant. Methods of assaying and quantifying measures of enzymatic activity and substrate specificity, are well known to those of skill in the art.<br>
In another aspect, the invention relates to human mimetibodies and ligand-binding fragments, as described herein, which are modified by the covalent attachment of an organic moiety. Such modification can produce an EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or ligand-binding fragment with improved pharmacokinetic properties (e.g., increased in vivo serum half-life). The organic moiety can be a linear or branched hydrophilic polymeric group, fatty acid group, or fatty acid ester group. In particular embodiments, the hydrophilic polymeric group<br>
CEN5039NP	34<br><br>
can have a molecular weight of about 800 to about 120,000 Daltons and can be a polyalkane glycol (e.g., polyethylene glycol (PEG), polypropylene glycol (PPG)), carbohydrate polymer, amino acid polymer or polyvinyl pyrolidone, and the fatty acid or fatty acid ester group can comprise from about eight to about forty carbon atoms.<br>
The modified mimetibodies and ligand-binding fragments of the invention can comprise one or more organic moieties that are covalently bonded, directly or indirectly, to the EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant. Each organic moiety that is bonded to an EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or ligand-binding fragment of the invention can independently be a hydrophilic polymeric group, a fatty acid group or a fatty acid ester group. As used herein, the term "fatty acid" encompasses mono-carboxylic acids and di-carboxylic acids. A "hydrophilic polymeric group," as the term is used herein, refers to an organic polymer that is more soluble in water than in octane. For example, polylysine is more soluble in water than in octane. Thus, an EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody modified by the covalent attachment of polylysine is encompassed by the invention. Hydrophilic polymers suitable for modifying mimetibodies of the invention can be linear or branched and include, for example, polyalkane glycols (e.g., PEG, monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mPEG), PPG and the like), carbohydrates (e.g., dextran, cellulose, oligosaccharides, polysaccharides and the like), polymers of hydrophilic amino acids (e.g., polylysine, polyarginine, polyaspartate and the like), polyalkane oxides (e.g., polyethylene oxide, polypropylene oxide and the like) and polyvinyl pyrolidone. Preferably, the hydrophilic polymer that modifies the EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody of the invention has a molecular weight of about 800 to about 150,000 Daltons as a separate molecular entity. For example, PEG2500, PEG5000, PEG75O0, PEG9000, PEG10000, PEG12500, PEG15000, and PEG20000, wherein the subscript is the average molecular weight of the polymer in Daltons, can be used.<br>
The hydrophilic polymeric group can be substituted with one to about six alkyl, fatty acid or fatty acid ester groups. Hydrophilic polymers that are substituted with a fatty acid or fatty acid ester group can be prepared by employing suitable methods. For example, a polymer comprising an amine group can be coupled to a carboxylate of the fatty acid or fatty acid ester, and an activated carboxylate (e.g., activated with N,N-carbonyl diimidazole) on a fatty acid or fatty acid ester can be coupled to a hydroxyl group on a polymer.<br>
Fatty acids and fatty acid esters suitable for modifying mimetibodies of the invention can be saturated or can contain one or more units of unsaturation. Fatty acids that are suitable for modifying mimetibodies of the invention include, for example, n-dodecanoate (C12, laurate), n-tetradecanoate (C14, myristate), n-octadecanoate (C18, stearate), n-eicosanoate (C20, arachidate). n-docosanoate (C22, behenate), n-triacontanoate (C30), n-tetracontanoate (C40),<br>
CEN5039NP	35<br><br>
cis-D9-octadecanoate (C18, oleate), all cis-5,8,l 1,14-eicosatetraenoate (C20, arachidonate), octanedioic acid, tetradecanedioic acid, octadecanedioic acid, docosanedioic acid, and the like. Suitable fatty acid esters include mono-esters of dicarboxylic acids that comprise a linear or branched lower alkyl group. The lower alkyl group can comprise from one to about twelve, preferably one to about six, carbon atoms.<br>
The modified human mimetibodies and ligand-binding fragments can be prepared using suitable methods, such as by reaction with one or more modifying agents. A "modifying agent" as the term is used herein, refers to a suitable organic group (e.g., hydrophilic polymer, a fatty acid, a fatty acid ester) that comprises an activating group. An "activating group" is a chemical moiety or functional group that can, under appropriate conditions, react with a second chemical group thereby forming a covalent bond between the modifying agent and the second chemical group. For example, amine-reactive activating groups include electrophilic groups such as tosylate, mesylate, halo (chloro, bromo, fluoro, iodo), N-hydroxysuccinimidyl esters (NHS), and the like. Activating groups that can react with thiols include, for example, maleimide, iodoacetyl, acrylolyl, pyridyl disulfides, 5-thiol-2-nitrobenzoic acid thiol (TNB-thiol), and the like. An aldehyde functional group can be coupled to amine- or hydrazide-containing molecules, and an azide group can react with a trivalent phosphorous group to form phosphoramidate or phosphorimide linkages. Suitable methods to introduce activating groups into molecules are known in the art (see for example, Hermanson, G. T., Bioconjugate Techniques, Academic Press: San Diego, CA (1996)). An activating group can be bonded directly to the organic group (e.g., hydrophilic polymer, fatty acid, fatty acid ester), or through a linker moiety, for example a divalent C1C12 group wherein one or more carbon atoms can be replaced by a heteroatom such as oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur. Suitable linker moieties include, for example, tetraethylene glycol, -(CH2)3-, -NH-(CH2)6-NH-, -(CH2)2-NH- and -CH2-O-CH2-CH2O-CH2CH2-O-CH-NH-. Modifying agents that comprise a linker moiety can be produced, for example, by reacting a mono-Boc-alkyldiamine (e.g., mono-Boc-ethylenediamine, mono-Boc-diaminohexane) with a fatty acid in the presence of l-ethyI-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) to form an amide bond between the free amine and the fatty acid carboxylate. The Boc protecting group can be removed from the product by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to expose a primary amine that can be coupled to another carboxylate as described, or can be reacted with maleic anhydride and the resulting product cyclized to produce an activated maleimido derivative of the fatty acid. (See, for example, Thompson, et al., WO 92/16221 the entire teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference.)<br>
CEN5039NP	36<br><br>
The modified mimetibodies of the invention can be produced by reacting an human EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or ligand-binding fragment with a modifying agent. For example, the organic moieties can be bonded to the EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody in a non-site specific manner by employing an amine-reactive modifying agent, for example, an NHS ester of PEG. Modified human mimetibodies or ligand-binding fragments can also be prepared by reducing disulfide bonds (e.g., intra-chain disulfide bonds) of an EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or ligand-binding fragment. The reduced EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or ligand-binding fragment can then be reacted with a thiol-reactive modifying agent to produce the modified EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody of the invention. Modified human mimetibodies and ligand-binding fragments comprising an organic moiety that is bonded to specific sites of an EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant of the present invention can be prepared using suitable methods, such as reverse proteolysis (Fisch et al., Bioconjugate Chem., 3:147-153 (1992); Werlen et al, Bioconjugate Chem., 5:411-417 (1994); Kumaran et al., ProteinSci. 6(10):2233-2241 (1997); Itoh et al, Bioorg. Chem., 24(1): 59-68 (1996); Capellas et al, Biotechnol. Bioeng., 56(4):456-463 (1997)), and the methods described in Hermanson, G. T., Bioconjugate Techniques, Academic Press: San Diego, CA (1996).<br>

Briefly, bone marrow is removed from a patient prior to chemotherapy and treated with TPO and/or EPO, optionally in combination with mimetibodies, optionally in combination with one or more additional cytokines. The treated marrow is then returned to the patient after chemotherapy to speed the recovery of the marrow. In addition, TPO, alone and in combination with EPO mimetibodies and/or EPO, can also be used for the ex vivo expansion of marrow or peripheral blood progenitor (PBPC) cells. Prior to chemotherapy treatment, marrow can be stimulated with stem cell factor (SCF) or G-CSF to release early progenitor cells into peripheral circulation. These progenitors are optionally collected and concentrated from peripheral blood and then treated in culture with TPO and mimetibodies, optionally in combination with one or more other cytokines, including but not limited to SCF, G-CSF, 1L-3, GM-CSF, 1L-6 or 1L-11, to differentiate and proliferate into high-density megakaryocyte<br>
CEN5039NP	60<br><br>
cultures, which are optionally then be returned to the patient following high-dose chemotherapy. Doses of TPO for ex vivo treatment of bone marrow will be in the range of 100 pg/ml to 10 ng/ml, preferably 500 pg/ml to 3 ng/ml. Doses of mimetibodies will be equivalent in activity to EPO which can be used from 0.1 units/ml to 20 units/ml, preferably from 0.5 units/ml to 2 units/ml, or any range or value therein.<br>

As used herein, a "tumor necrosis factor antibody," "TNF antibody," "TNFa antibody," or fragment and the like decreases, blocks, inhibits, abrogates or interferes with TNFa activity in vitro, in situ and/or preferably in vivo. For example, a suitable TNF human antibody of the present invention can bind TNFa and includes anti-TNF antibodies, antigen-binding fragments thereof, and specified mutants or domains thereof that bind specifically to TNFa. A suitable TNF antibody or fragment can also decrease block, abrogate, interfere, prevent and/or inhibit TNF RNA, DNA or protein synthesis, TNF release, TNF receptor signaling, membrane TNF cleavage, TNF activity, TNF production and/or synthesis.<br>
Chimeric antibody cA2 consists of the antigen binding variable region of the high-affinity neutralizing mouse anti-human TNFa IgGl antibody, designated A2, and the constant regions of a human IgGl, kappa immunoglobulin. The human IgGl Fc region improves allogeneic antibody effector function, increases the circulating serum half-life and decreases the immunogenicity of the antibody. The avidity and epitope specificity of the chimeric antibody cA2 is derived from the variable region of the murine antibody A2. In a particular embodiment, a preferred source for nucleic acids encoding the variable region of the murine antibody A2 is the A2 hybridoma cell line.<br>
Chimeric A2 (cA2) neutralizes the cytotoxic effect of both natural and recombinant<br>
CEN5039NP	61<br><br>
human TNFa in a dose dependent manner. From binding assays of chimeric antibody cA2 and recombinant human TNFa, the affinity constant of chimeric antibody cA2 was calculated to be 1.04xl010M-1. Preferred methods for determining monoclonal antibody specificity and affinity by competitive inhibition can be found in Harlow, et al., Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York, 1988; Colligan et al., eds., Current Protocols in Immunology, Greene Publishing Assoc. and Wiley Interscience, New York, (1992-2003); Kozbor et al., Immunol.

Enzymol, 92:589-601 (1983), which references are entirely incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In a particular embodiment, murine monoclonal antibody A2 is produced by a cell line designated cl34A. Chimeric antibody cA2 is produced by a cell line designated cl68A.<br>
Additional examples of monoclonal anti-TNF antibodies that can be used in the present invention are described in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,231,024; Moller, A. et al, Cytokine 2(3): 162-169 (1990); U.S. Application No. 07/943,852 (filed September 11, 1992); Rathjen et al., International Publication No. WO 91/02078 (published February 21, 1991); Rubin et al., EPO Patent Publication No. 0 218 868 (published April 22, 1987); Yone et al., EPO Patent Publication No. 0 288 088 (October 26, 1988); Liang, et al., Biochem.

Immunol. Meth. 96:51-62 (1987), which references are entirely incorporated herein by reference). TNF Receptor Molecules<br>
Preferred TNF receptor molecules useful in the present invention are those that bind TNFa with high affinity (see, e.g., Feldmann et al, International Publication No. WO 92/07076 (published April 30, 1992); Schall et al, Cell 61:361-310 (1990); and Loetscher al, Cell 61:351-359 (1990), which references are entirely incorporated herein by reference) and optionally possess low immunogenicity. In particular, the 55 kDa (p55 TNF-R) and the 75 kDa (p75 TNF-R) TNF cell surface receptors are useful in the present invention. Truncated forms of these receptors, comprising the extracellular domains (ECD) of the receptors or functional portions thereof (see, e.g., Corcoran et al, Eur. J. Biochem. 223:831-840 (1994)), are also useful in the present invention. Truncated forms of the TNF receptors, comprising the ECD, have been detected in urine and serum as 30 kDa and 40 kDa TNFa inhibitory binding proteins (Engelmann, H. et al, J. Biol. Chem. 265:1531-1536 (1990)). TNF receptor multimeric molecules and TNF immunoreceptor fusion molecules, and derivatives and<br>
CEN5039NP	62<br><br>
fragments or portions thereof, are additional examples of TNF receptor molecules which are useful in the methods and compositions of the present invention. The TNF receptor molecules which can be used in the invention are characterized by their ability to treat patients for extended periods with good to excellent alleviation of symptoms and low toxicity. Low immunogenicity and/or high affinity, as well as other undefined properties, may contribute to the therapeutic results achieved.<br>

These immunoreceptor fusion molecules can be assembled as monomers, or hetero- or homo-multimers. The immunoreceptor fusion molecules can also be monovalent or multivalent. An example of such a TNF immunoreceptor fusion molecule is TNF receptor/IgG fusion protein. TNF immunoreceptor fusion molecules and methods for their production have been described in the art (Lesslauer et al, Eur. J. Immunol. 27:2883-2886 (1991); Ashkenazi et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:10535-10539 (1991); Peppel et al, J. Exp. Med. 774:1483-1489(1991); Kolls et al., Pwc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97:215-219 (1994); Butler et al, Cytokine 6(6):616-623 (1994); Baker et al, Eur. J.

A functional equivalent, derivative, fragment or region of TNF receptor molecule refers to the portion of the TNF receptor molecule, or the portion of the TNF receptor molecule sequence which encodes TNF receptor molecule, that is of sufficient size and sequences to functionally resemble TNF receptor molecules that can be used in the present invention (e.g., bind TNFa with high affinity and possess low immunogenicity). A functional equivalent of TNF receptor molecule also includes modified TNF receptor molecules that functionally<br>
CEN5039NP	63<br><br>
resemble TNF receptor molecules that can be used in the present invention (e.g., bind TNFa with high affinity and possess low immunogenicity). For example, a functional equivalent of TNF receptor molecule can contain a "SILENT" codon or one or more amino acid substitutions, deletions or additions (e.g., substitution of one acidic amino acid for another acidic amino acid; or substitution of one codon encoding the same or different hydrophobic amino acid for another codon encoding a hydrophobic amino acid).

Metered dose inhalers like the Ventolin® metered dose inhaler, typically use a propellent gas and require actuation during inspiration (See, e.g., WO 94/16970, WO 98/35888). Dry powder inhalers like Turbuhaler™ (Astra), Rotahaler® (Glaxo), Diskus® (Glaxo), Spiros™ inhaler (Dura), devices marketed by Inhale Therapeutics, and the Spinhaler® powder inhaler (Fisons), use breath-actuation of a mixed powder (US 4668218 Astra, EP 237507 Astra, WO 97/25086 Glaxo, WO 94/08552 Dura, US 5458135 Inhale, WO 94/06498 Fisons, entirely incorporated herein by reference). Nebulizers like AERx™ Aradigm, the Ultravent® nebulizer (Mallinckrodt), and the Acorn II® nebulizer (Marquest Medical Products) (US 5404871 Aradigm, WO 97/22376), the above references entirely incorporated herein by reference, produce aerosols from solutions, while metered dose inhalers, dry powder inhalers, etc. generate small particle aerosols. These specific examples of commercially available inhalation devices are intended to be a representative of specific devices suitable for the practice of this invention, and are not intended as limiting the scope of the invention. Preferably, a composition comprising at least one EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant is delivered by a dry powder inhaler or a sprayer. There are a several desirable features of an inhalation device for administering at least one EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant of the present invention. For example, delivery by the inhalation device is advantageously reliable, reproducible, and accurate. The inhalation device can optionally deliver small dry particles, e.g. less than about 10 (mm, preferably about 1-5 mm, for good respirability.<br>

CEN5039NP	68<br><br>
hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant composition protein in an aqueous solution at a concentration of about 1 mg to about 20 mg of at least one EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant composition protein per ml of solution. The formulation can include agents such as an excipient, a buffer, an isotonicity agent, a preservative, a surfactant, and, preferably, zinc. The formulation can also include an excipient or agent for stabilization of the EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant composition protein, such as a buffer, a reducing agent, a bulk protein, or a carbohydrate. Bulk proteins useful in formulating EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant composition proteins include albumin, protamine, or the like. Typical carbohydrates useful in formulating EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant composition proteins include sucrose, mannitol, lactose, trehalose, glucose, or the like. The EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant composition protein formulation can also include a surfactant, which can reduce or prevent surface-induced aggregation of the EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant composition protein caused by atomization of the solution in forming an aerosol. Various conventional surfactants can be employed, such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters and alcohols, and polyoxyethylene sorbitol fatty acid esters. Amounts will generally range between 0.001 and 14% by weight of the formulation. Especially preferred surfactants for purposes of this invention are polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate, polysorbate 80, polysorbate 20, or the like. Additional agents known in the art for formulation of a protein such as mimetibodies, or specified portions or variants, can also be included in the formulation.<br>
Administration of EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant compositions by a Nebulizer<br>
EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant composition protein can be administered by a nebulizer, such as jet nebulizer or an ultrasonic nebulizer. Typically, in a jet nebulizer, a compressed air source is used to create a high-velocity air jet through an orifice. As the gas expands beyond the nozzle, a low-pressure region is created, which draws a solution of EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant composition protein through a capillary tube connected to a liquid reservoir. The liquid stream from the capillary tube is sheared into unstable filaments and droplets as it exits the tube, creating the aerosol. A range of configurations, flow rates, and baffle types can be employed to achieve the desired performance characteristics from a given jet nebulizer. In an ultrasonic nebulizer, high-frequency electrical energy is used to create vibrational, mechanical energy, typically employing a piezoelectric transducer. This energy is transmitted to the formulation of<br>
CEN5039NP	69<br><br>
EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant composition protein either directly or through a coupling fluid, creating an aerosol including the EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant composition protein. Advantageously, particles of EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant composition protein delivered by a nebulizer have a particle size less than about 10 mm, preferably in the range of about 1 mm to about 5 mm, and most preferably about 2 mm to about 3 mm<br>

The at least one EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant formulation can also include a surfactant, which can reduce or prevent surface-induced aggregation of the at least one EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant caused by atomization of the solution in forming an aerosol. Various conventional surfactants can be employed, such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters and alcohols, and polyoxyethylene sorbital fatty acid esters. Amounts will generally range between 0.001 and 4% by weight of the formulation. Especially preferred surfactants for purposes of this invention are polyoxyethylene sorbitan mono-oleate, polysorbate 80, polysorbate 20, or the like. Additional agents known in the art for formulation of a protein such as at least one EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant protein can also be included in the formulation.<br>
Administration of EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant compositions By A Metered Dose Inhaler<br>
In a metered dose inhaler (MD1), a propellant, at least one EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant, and any excipients or other additives are contained<br>
CEN5039NP	70<br><br>
in a canister as a mixture including a liquefied compressed gas. Actuation of the metering valve releases the mixture as an aerosol, preferably containing particles in the size range of less than about 10 mm, preferably about 1 urn to about 5 urn, and most preferably about 2 urn to about 3 urn. The desired aerosol particle size can be obtained by employing a formulation of EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant composition protein produced by various methods known to those of skill in the art, including jet-milling, spray drying, critical point condensation, or the like. Preferred metered dose inhalers include those manufactured by 3M or Glaxo and employing a hydrofluorocarbon propellant.<br>
Formulations of at least one EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant for use with a metered-dose inhaler device will generally include a finely divided powder containing at least one EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant as a suspension in a non-aqueous medium, for example, suspended in a propellant with the aid of a surfactant. The propellant can be any conventional material employed for this purpose, such as chlorofluorocarbon, a hydrochlorofluorocarbon, a hydrofluorocarbon, or a hydrocarbon, including trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorodifluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethanol and 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane, HFA-134a (hydrofluroalkane-134a), HFA-227 (hydrofluroalkane-227), or the like. Preferably the propellant is a hydrofluorocarbon. The surfactant can be chosen to stabilize the at least one EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant as a suspension in the propellant, to protect the active agent against chemical degradation, and the like. Suitable surfactants include sorbitan trioleate, soya lecithin, oleic acid, or the like. In some cases solution aerosols are preferred using solvents such as ethanol. Additional agents known in the art for formulation of a protein such as protein can also be included in the formulation.<br>
One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the methods of the current invention can be achieved by pulmonary administration of at least one EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant compositions via devices not described herein. Mucosal Formulations and Administration<br>
For absorption through mucosal surfaces, compositions and methods of administering at least one EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant include an emulsion comprising a plurality of submicron particles, a mucoadhesive macromolecule, a bioactive peptide, and an aqueous continuous phase, which promotes absorption through mucosal surfaces by achieving mucoadhesion of the emulsion particles (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,514,670). Mucous surfaces suitable for application of the emulsions of the present invention can include corneal, conjunctival, buccal, sublingual, nasal, vaginal, pulmonary, stomachic, intestinal, and rectal routes of administration. Formulations for vaginal or rectal<br>
CEN5039NP	71<br><br>
administration, e.g. suppositories, can contain as excipients, for example, polyalkyleneglycols, vaseline, cocoa butter, and the like. Formulations for intranasal administration can be solid and contain as excipients, for example, lactose or can be aqueous or oily solutions of nasal drops. For buccal administration excipients include sugars, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, pregelinatined starch, and the like (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,849,695).<br>
Oral Formulations and Administration<br>
Formulations for oral rely on the co-administration of adjuvants (e.g., resorcinols and nonionic surfactants such as polyoxyethylene oleyl ether and n-hexadecylpolyethylene ether) to increase artificially the permeability of the intestinal walls, as well as the co-administration of enzymatic inhibitors (e.g., pancreatic trypsin inhibitors, diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFF) and trasylol) to inhibit enzymatic degradation. The active constituent compound of the solid-type dosage form for oral administration can be mixed with at least one additive, including sucrose, lactose, cellulose, mannitol, trehalose, raffinose, maltitol, dextran, starches, agar, arginates, chitins, chitosans, pectins, gum tragacanth, gum arabic, gelatin, collagen, casein, albumin, synthetic or semisynthetic polymer, and glyceride. These dosage forms can also contain other type(s) of additives, e.g., inactive diluting agent, lubricant such as magnesium stearate, paraben, preserving agent such as sorbic acid, ascorbic acid, alpha.-tocopherol, antioxidant such as cysteine, disintegrator, binder, thickener, buffering agent, sweetening agent, flavoring agent, perfuming agent, etc.<br>
Tablets and pills can be further processed into enteric-coated preparations. The liquid preparations for oral administration include emulsion, syrup, elixir, suspension and solution preparations allowable for medical use. These preparations may contain inactive diluting agents ordinarily used in said field, e.g., water. Liposomes have also been described as drug delivery systems for insulin and heparin (U.S. Pat. No. 4,239,754). More recently, microspheres of artificial polymers of mixed amino acids (proteinoids) have been used to deliver pharmaceuticals (U.S. Pat. No. 4,925,673). Furthermore, carrier compounds described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,879,681 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,5,871,753 are used to deliver biologically active agents orally are known in the art.<br>
Transdermal Formulations and Administration<br>
For transdermal administration, the at least one EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant is encapsulated in a delivery device such as a liposome or polymeric nanoparticles, microparticle, microcapsule, or microspheres (referred to collectively as microparticles unless otherwise stated). A number of suitable devices are known, including microparticles made of synthetic polymers such as polyhydroxy acids such as polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid and copolymers thereof, polyorthoesters, polyanhydrides, and<br>
CEN5039NP	72<br><br>
polyphosphazenes, and natural polymers such as collagen, polyamino acids, albumin and other<br>
proteins, alginate and other polysaccharides, and combinations thereof (U.S. Pat. Nos.<br>
5,814,599).<br>
Prolonged Administration and Formulations<br>
It can be sometimes desirable to deliver the compounds of the present invention to the subject over prolonged periods of time, for example, for periods of one week to one year from a single administration. Various slow release, depot or implant dosage forms can be utilized. For example, a dosage form can contain a pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic salt of the compounds that has a low degree of solubility in body fluids, for example, (a) an acid addition salt with a polybasic acid such as phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, tannic acid, pamoic acid, alginic acid, polyglutamic acid, naphthalene mono- or di-sulfonic acids, polygalacturonic acid, and the like; (b) a salt with a polyvalent metal cation such as zinc, calcium, bismuth, barium, magnesium, aluminum, copper, cobalt, nickel, cadmium and the like, or with an organic cation formed from e.g., N,N'-dibenzyl-ethylenediamine or ethylenediamine; or (c) combinations of (a) and (b) e.g. a zinc tannate salt. Additionally, the compounds of the present invention or, preferably, a relatively insoluble salt such as those just described, can be formulated in a gel, for example, an aluminum monostearate gel with, e.g. sesame oil, suitable for injection. Particularly preferred salts are zinc salts, zinc tannate salts, pamoate salts, and the like. Another type of slow release depot formulation for injection would contain the compound or salt dispersed for encapsulated in a slow degrading, non-toxic, non-antigenic polymer such as a polylactic acid/polyglycolic acid polymer for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919. The compounds or, preferably, relatively insoluble salts such as those described above can also be formulated in cholesterol matrix silastic pellets, particularly for use in animals. Additional slow release, depot or implant formulations, e.g. gas or liquid liposomes are known in the literature (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,770,222 and "Sustained and Controlled Release Drug Delivery Systems", J. R. Robinson ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc., N.Y., 1978).<br>
Having generally described the invention, the same will be more readily understood by reference to the following examples, which are provided by way of illustration and are not intended as limiting.<br>
Example 1: Cloning and Expression of an EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody in Mammalian Cells<br>
A typical mammalian expression vector contains at least one promoter element, which mediates the initiation of transcription of mRNA, the EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant coding sequence, and signals required for the termination of<br>
CEN5039NP	73<br><br>
transcription and polyadenylation of the transcript. Additional elements include enhancers, Kozak sequences and intervening sequences flanked by donor and acceptor sites for RNA splicing. Highly efficient transcription can be achieved with the early and late promoters from SV40, the long terminal repeats (LTRS) from Retroviruses, e.g., RSV, HTLVI, HIVI and the early promoter of the cytomegalovirus (CMV). However, cellular elements can also be used (e.g., the human actin promoter). Suitable expression vectors for use in practicing the present invention include, for example, vectors such as pIRESlneo, pRetro-Off, pRetro-On, PLXSN, or pLNCX (Clonetech Labs, Palo Alto, CA), pcDNA3.1 (+/-), pcDNA/Zeo (+/-) or pcDNA3.1/Hygro (+/-) (Invitrogen), PSVL and PMSG (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden), pRSVcat (ATCC 37152), pSV2dhfr (ATCC 37146) and pBC12MI (ATCC 67109). Mammalian host cells that could be used include human Hela 293, H9 and Jurkat cells, mouse NIH3T3 and C127 cells, Cos 1, Cos 7 and CV 1, quail QC1-3 cells, mouse L cells and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells.<br>
Alternatively, the gene can be expressed in stable cell lines that contain the gene integrated into a chromosome. The co-transfection with a selectable marker such as dhfr, gpt, neomycin, or hygromycin allows the identification and isolation of the transfected cells.<br>
The transfected gene can also be amplified to express large amounts of the encoded EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant. The DHFR (dihydrofolate reductase) marker is useful to develop cell lines that carry several hundred or even several thousand copies of the gene of interest. Another useful selection marker is the enzyme glutamine synthase (GS) (Murphy, et al., Biochem. J. 227:277-279 (1991); Bebbington, et al., Bio/Technology 10:169-175 (1992)). Using these markers, the mammalian cells are grown in selective medium and the cells with the highest resistance are selected. These cell lines contain the amplified gene(s) integrated into a chromosome. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and NSO cells are often used for the production of EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variants.<br>
The expression vectors pCl and pC4 contain the strong promoter (LTR) of the Rous Sarcoma Virus (Cullen, et al., Molec. Cell. Biol. 5:438-447 (1985)) plus a fragment of the CMV-enhancer (Boshart, et al., Cell 41:521-530 (1985)). Multiple cloning sites, e.g., with the restriction enzyme cleavage sites BamHI, Xbal and Asp718, facilitate the cloning of the gene of interest. The vectors contain in addition the 3' intron, the polyadenylation and termination signal of the rat preproinsulin gene. Cloning and Expression in CHO Cells<br>
The vector pC4 is used for the expression of EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant. Plasmid pC4 is a derivative of the plasmid pSV2-dhfr (ATCC<br>
CEN5039NP	74<br><br>
Accession No. 37146). The plasmid contains the mouse DHFR gene under control of the SV40 early promoter. Chinese hamster ovary- or other cells lacking dihydrofolate activity that are transfected with these plasmids can be selected by growing the cells in a selective medium (e.g., alpha minus MEM, Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented with the chemotherapeutic agent methotrexate. The amplification of the DHFR genes in cells resistant to methotrexate (MTX) has been well documented (see, e.g., F. W. Alt, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 253:1357-1370 (1978); J. L. Hamlin and C. Ma, Biochem. et Biophys. Acta 1097:107-143 (1990); and M. J. Page and M. A. Sydenham, Biotechnology 9:64-68 (1991)). Cells grown in increasing concentrations of MTX develop resistance to the drug by overproducing the target enzyme, DHFR, as a result of amplification of the DHFR gene. If a second gene is linked to the DHFR gene, it is usually co-amplified and over-expressed. It is known in the art that this approach can be used to develop cell lines carrying more than 1,000 copies of the amplified gene(s). Subsequently, when the methotrexate is withdrawn, cell lines are obtained that contain the amplified gene integrated into one or more chromosome(s) of the host cell.<br>
Plasmid pC4 contains for expressing the gene of interest the strong promoter of the long terminal repeat (LTR) of the Rous Sarcoma Virus (Cullen, et al., Molec. Cell. Biol. 5:438-447 (1985)) plus a fragment isolated from the enhancer of the immediate early gene of human cytomegalovirus (CMV) (Boshart, et al., Cell 41:521-530 (1985)). Downstream of the promoter are BamHI, Xbal, and Asp718 restriction enzyme cleavage sites that allow integration of the genes. Behind these cloning sites the plasmid contains the 3' intron and polyadenylation site of the rat preproinsulin gene. Other high efficiency promoters can also be used for the expression, e.g., the human b-actin promoter, the SV40 early or late promoters or the long terminal repeats from other retroviruses, e.g., HIV and HTLVI. Clontech's Tet-Off and Tet-On gene expression systems and similar systems can be used to express the EPO in a regulated way in mammalian cells (M. Gossen, and H. Bujard, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89: 5547-5551 (1992)). For the polyadenylation of the mRNA other signals, e.g., from the human growth hormone or globin genes can be used as well. Stable cell lines carrying a gene of interest integrated into the chromosomes can also be selected upon co-transfection with a selectable marker such as gpt, G418 or hygromycin. It is advantageous to use more than one selectable marker in the beginning, e.g., G418 plus methotrexate.<br>
The plasmid pC4 is digested with restriction enzymes and then dephosphorylated using calf intestinal phosphatase by procedures known in the art. The vector is then isolated from a 1% agarose gel.<br>
The DNA sequence encoding the complete EPO mimetic hinge core mimetibody or specified portion or variant is used, corresponding to HC and LC variable regions of an EPO<br>
CEN5039NP	75<br><br>
mimetic hinge core mimetibody of the present invention, according to known method steps. Isolated nucleic acid encoding a suitable human constant region (i.e., HC and LC regions) is also used in this construct.<br>
The isolated variable and constant region encoding DNA and the dephosphorylated vector are then ligated with T4 DNA ligase. E. coli HB101 or XL-1 Blue cells are then transformed and bacteria are identified that contain the fragment inserted into plasmid pC4 using, for instance, restriction enzyme analysis.<br>
Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells lacking an active DHFR gene are used for transfection. 5 mg of the expression plasmid pC4 is cotransfected with 0.5 m.g of the plasmid pSV2-neo using lipofectin. The plasmid pSV2neo contains a dominant selectable marker, the neo gene from Tn5 encoding an enzyme that confers resistance to a group of antibiotics including G418. The cells are seeded in alpha minus MEM supplemented with 1 mg /ml G418. After 2 days, the cells are trypsinized and seeded in hybridoma cloning plates (Greiner, Germany) in alpha minus MEM supplemented with 10, 25, or 50 ng/ml of methotrexate plus 1 mg /ml G418. After about 10-14 days single clones are trypsinized and then seeded in 6-welI petri dishes or 10 ml flasks using different concentrations of methotrexate (50 nM, 100 nM, 200 nM, 400 nM, 800 nM). Clones growing at the highest concentrations of methotrexate are then transferred to new 6-well plates containing even higher concentrations of methotrexate (1 mM, 2 mM, 5 mM, 10 mM, 20 mM). The same procedure is repeated until clones are obtained that grow at a concentration of 100 - 200 mM. Expression of the desired gene product is analyzed, for instance, by SDS-PAGE and Western blot or by reverse phase HPLC analysis.<br>
Example 2: Non-Limiting Example of an EPO mimetic hinge core Mimetibody of the Invention<br>
Background: EMP-1 (EPO mimetic peptide-1) is a 20 amino acid peptide with no sequence homology to human erythropoietin (HuEPO), but with the ability (as a dimer) to activate the EPO receptor (Wrighton et al, 1996, Science, vol. 273, 458-463). However, its relatively low activity (10,000 to 100,000 fold less than HuEPO) and short half-life (ex-vivo half-life of 8 hours in 50% serum, in vivo half-life unknown), compromise its utility as a therapeutic. Therefore, a way was needed to confer upon the peptide a longer half-life, without disturbing, and possibly improving its potency. To this end, several attempts have been made to increase the activity of EMP-I by stabilizing the dimerization of the peptide or by incorporating the peptide into larger structures to increase half-life. Wrighten et al. (1997, Nature Biotechnology, vol. 15, 1261-65) combined biotin labeled EMP-1 with streptavidin to stabilize dimerization. They saw a 100 fold increase in activity in an in vitro cell proliferation assay. They also used anti-biotin antibodies to<br>
CEN5039NP	76<br><br>
stabilize the peptide dimer, however only a 10-fold increase in activity was seen. The same authors prepared a chemically defined dimeric form of EMP-1. In this case an 100-fold increase in activity was seen in vivo. Another group sought to improve the activity of EMP-1 through covalent linkage to polyethylene glycol (PEG) (Johnson et al., 1997, Chem. &amp; Bio., vol. 4(12), 939-50). They reported an increase in potency of up to 1000 fold, however the construct was found to be immunogenic in mice (the antibodies were directed to the peptide) (Dana Johnson, Personal communications). Kuai et al. (2000, J. Peptide Res., vol. 56, 59-62) inserted the EMP-1 peptide into the sequence of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, (PAI-1). It was thought that the insertion of EMP-1 into this scaffold would both stabilize dimerization and increase half-life. In an in vivo assay the potency of this construct was seen to be significantly higher, such as more than 2500 fold higher than EMP-1 alone. It should be noted that different in vitro assays and in vivo models were used in these studies and the reported potencies may not be comparable to each other or to results presented herein.<br>
EPO mimetic hinge core Mimetibody of the Present Invention<br>
A specific, non-limiting, example of this invention is the EMP-hinge core<br>
mimetibody construct where V is the first several N-terminal amino acids of a naturally occurring HC or LC antibody, P is a single copy of the bioactive EMP-1 peptide and L is a tandem repeat of either Gly-Ser or Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser flexible linker, H is a hinge core region and CH2 &amp; CH3 are of the IgGl or IgG4 isotype subclass. It is thought that this structure will constrain the EMP-1 peptide, but allow sufficient flexibility such that the dimerization of the peptides as part of the assembled homodimer is stabilized. In support of this, the activity of EMP-hinge core mimetibody in an in vitro cell proliferation assay is more than 500 fold greater than the EMP-1 peptide and only substantially similar to recombinant HuEPO (rHuEPO). In addition, it is expected that the half-life of this construct will be many times that of rHuEPO or the EMP-1 peptide alone and similar to that of an IgG. Consistently, normal mice treated with EMP-hinge core mimetibody attain a significantly higher maximal hematocrit compared to mice treated with rHuEPO, when equal activity units are given, and elevated levels are maintained for a longer period. This construct is efficiently secreted from cells and appears to be properly folded; overcoming problems associated with 1s' generation mimetibodies.<br>
In addition to the basic structure described above, variants with potentially favorable biological characteristics are described. These include constructs that may have a decreased tendency to self-associate, reduced immune effector functions or decreased immunogenicity. Other modifications that confer desired characteristics such as improved conformation of the biologically active peptide, and transfer across the blood-brain barrier are envisioned. The proposed variants and modifications may be combined in any fashion to yield<br>
CEN5039NP	77<br><br>
constructs with desired activities.<br>
Using recombinant DNA methods, the EMP-1 peptide was inserted into an intermediate vector between an immunoglobulin signal peptide and a human J sequence. This was done using complementary synthetic oligonucletides with ends compatible with the restriction sites present in the vector These oligonucleotides comprised coding sequences for the signal peptidase consensus site (QIQ), the EMP-1 peptide (SEQ ID NO:2), and a flexible linker composed of either GS or GGGS. A restriction fragment containing the above-mentioned functional elements was then transferred into an expression vector. This vector contained the anti-CD4 immunoglobulin promoter and enhancer, and the coding sequence for a human IgGl hinge core sequence, and a portion of an IgGl hinge core region, CPPCP (109-113 of SEQ ID NO:66, as shown in Figure 36C), an HC constant region 2 (CH2) and constant region 3 (CH3) as well as the necessary elements for plasmid replication and selection in bacteria and selection for stable expressers in mammalian cells.<br>
This plasmid was linearized and introduced into the NSO mouse myeloma cell line via electroporation. Resistant cells were selected and high expressers of EMP-hinge core mimetibody were identified by ELISA assay of culture supernatants. Purification of the construct from cell culture supernatants was accomplished by standard proteinA affinity chromatography. Passage of the purified product through SDS-containing polyacrylamide gels under both denaturing and reducing conditions confirmed the expected size of the purified product. The identity of the purified protein was further confirmed by mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequencing.<br>
The amino acid sequences of EMP-hinge core mimetibodes are shown below. Functional domains are annotated above the peptide coding sequence. The three amino acid signal peptide consensus sequence corresponds to the first three amino acids of a naturally occurring immunoglobulin. These amino acids are thought to contribute to the efficient removal of the signal peptide by signal peptidase in the endoplasmic reticulum. This sequence is immediately followed by the EMP-1 coding sequence. The two C-terminal amino acids of the EMP-1 sequence combined with the next six amino acids form a flexible linker characterized by the Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser repeat. A human joining (J) region sequence follows. It is thought that the J sequence will provide even more flexibility to allow the EMP-1 dimmer to assume the proper conformation, and allow the dimmer to protrude from the globular structure of the immunoglobulin and penetrate into the cleft between two EPO receptors. The HC hinge region is also included in the construct immediately following the J region. There are three cysteines in the IgGl hinge region (highlighted). The first would normally pair to the immunoglobulin light chain (LC) and the second two participate in interchain bonds between two HCs. The remainder of the<br>
CEN5039NP	78<br><br>
sequence is composed of the CH2 &amp; CH3 regions, which constitute the bulk of the protein. One of the reasons that immunoglobulins are believed to have a long serum half-life is their ability to bind the FcRn that extends the serum half-life by returning pinocytosed immunoglobulin back to the extracellular space. The binding site of the FcRn overlaps the junction of the CH2 and CH3 regions (Sheilds et al, 2001, J. Biol. Chem., vol. 276 (9), 6591-6604).<br>

It is well known that two IgG heavy chains are assembled during cellular processing via disulfide bonds between cysteines located in the hinge region to form a homodimer. It is expected that this will also occur between the modified peptides to form the assembled EMP-hinge core mimetibody construct. In addition, it is expected that the intrachain disulfide bond between the two cysteines in the EMP-1 peptide will also form. The expected structure of EMP-Hinge core mimetibody contains two EMP-1 peptides. The spatial arrangement of the peptides at the N-terminus along with the flexibility of adjoining sequences should allow the peptides to form the bioacive dimer.<br>
The activity of EMP-Hinge core mimetibody was first tested in an in vitro bioactivity assay. For this assay, the EPO dependent UT-7/EPO cell line, derived from a patient with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia, was used (Komatsu et al., 1993, Blood, vol. 82 (2), 456-464). These cells undergo programmed cell death 48 to 72 hours after withdraw from media supplemented with rHuEPO. Cells that have been incubated in the absence of rHuEPO for 24 hours can be saved if treated with rHuEPO or an EPO agonist. EMP-Hinge core mimetibody was added to cells starved without rHuEPO and cell viability was determined 48 hours after treatment using the tetrazolium compound MTS (CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution, Promega) that is metabolized by living cells to yield a product with an absorbance that can be measured. Results of a typical assay showed the potency of EMP-Hinge core mimetibody on a molar basis to be 500 fold greater than the EMP-1 peptide and 5 fold less than rHuEPO. In addition, these same cells were stimulated with EMP-Hinge core mimetibody and tyrosine phosphorylation patterns visualized by running cell lysate through a polyacrylamide gel. The pattern exhibited by EMP-Hinge core mimetibody was similar to that of rHuEPO, indicating that the mechanism by which EMP-Hinge core mimetibody acts on these cells is like that of rHuEPO.<br>
In vivo studies were done in normal mice to compare the half-life of EMP-Hinge core mimetibody to that of rHuEPO and to compare their effects on erythropoiesis. When mice were dosed equally, EMP-Hinge core mimetibody gave a higher maximal response and the response was prolonged compared to rHuEPO.<br>
The serum concentrations of both rHuEPO and EMP-Hinge core mimetibody were measured by ELISA. The approximate half-life of EMP hinge core mimetibodies was at least several times that of rHuEPO.<br>
It has been shown that mutation of two lysine (L) residues, L234 &amp; L235, in the IgG I lower hinge region to alanine (A) will abrogate the ability of the immunoglobulin to mediate<br>
CEN5039NP	81<br><br>
complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody dependant cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) (Hezereh et al., 2001, J. Virol., vol. 75 (24), 12161-68). Preliminary studies have shown that EMP-Hinge core mimetibody does not mediate complement lysis of cells that express the EPO receptor. This may be due to the low number of receptors that are found on erythroid progenitor cells. In addition the in vivo expansion of erythriod progenitors as evidenced by significant increases in hematocrit supports the possible functional irrelevance of immune effector functions. However, while no effector function associated affects have been observed, there remains an interest in introducing these mutations as a precautionary step.<br>
Another modification that would result in a decrease in mediation of immune effector functions is the removal of the glycosylation attachment site. This can be accomplished by mutation of the asparagine at position 297 (N297) to glutamine (Q). Additional changes can optionally include replacing the threonine (T) with an alternative amino acid to reduce or modify O-glycosylation, e.g., T34 or-T47 with Aglycosylated versions of the IgGl subclass are known to be poor mediators of Immune effector function (Jefferis et al. 1998, Immol. Rev., vol. 163, 50-76).<br>
Advantages: The novel construct, EMP-Hinge core mimetibody described above offers an alternative way of displaying the bioactive peptide EMP-1. The activity of this construct is in the range of rHuEPO and the in vivo half-life is similar to that of an IgG. In addition, proposed modifications are expected to, in combination and in addition to the novel features of EMP-Hinge core mimetibody, enhance the utility of the EMP-Hinge core mimetibody construct.<br>
It will be clear that the invention can be practiced otherwise than as particularly described in the foregoing description and examples.<br>
Numerous modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings and, therefore, are within the scope of the present invention<br>
