				<td>TITLE: AN ADVANCED RAPPER OPERATING METHOD FOR ELECTROSTATIC<br>
PRECIPITATOR.<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
The invention relates to operation of rapper drive motors<br>
deployed in electrostatic precipitator* used for air pollution<br>
control.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART:<br>
Electrostatic precipitation is one of the most effective ways to<br>
control air pollution generated by industrial emissions. This<br>
technique, which has proven highly effective in controlling air<br>
pullution, has been used fop the removal of undesirable<br>
particulate matter from a gas stream by electrostatic<br>
precipitation. Electrostatic precipitator (hereafter referred to<br>
as ESP) is an air pollution control device designed to<br>
electrically charge and collect particulates generated from<br>
industrial processes such as those occurring in power plants,<br>
cement plants, pulp and paper mills and utilities etc. The<br>
electrically charged particles are attracted towards electrode<br>
plates, viz., discharge electrode and collection plate. ESP is<br>
divided into a plurality of fields depending on the dust load. A<br>
field is a set of a discharge electrode and collection plate. A<br>
field is considered healthy as long as it is charged with<br>
sufficient voltage and current between its discharge<br>
and collection plate. During continuous operation of an<br><br><br>
electrostatic precipitator, the dust from collector plates<br>
electrodes must be periodically removed for further conveying of<br>
the collected dust. The dust removal mechanism typically<br>
consists of a mechanical rapper.<br>
Rappers are electro-mechanical devices that are used to<br>
mechanically dislodge collected particulate/materials within an<br>
electrostatic precipitator or dust collector. In general, a<br>
rapper consists of a rapper motor connected to hammer mechanism<br>
that mechanically strikes shock pad of respective electrode to<br>
which it is connected. Striking the field electrode at shock pad<br>
with the hammer transmits mechanical forces to dislodge collected<br>
materials. This type of rapping system is called tumbling-hammer<br>
type rapper. Once the particulate is dislodged from the plates,<br>
it falls into collection hoppers at the bottom of the<br>
precipitator. An electronic rapper controller, which operates<br>
rapping motor, determines the sequence, intensity, and duration<br>
of rapping.<br>
In the prior art, conventional rapper controllers for a tumbling<br>
hammer type rapping system are known, which control rapper<br>
motors by switching them ON or OFF periodically, so as to allow<br>
ash build-up on plates during OFF time and ash removal during ON<br>
time. These periods are dictated by ESP's operating parameters<br>
viz., rapper motor's location with respect to gas flow, overall<br><br><br>
dust load into electrostatic precipitator and other user defined<br>
options. ON and OFF time* are critically set to avoid excessive<br>
rapping or under rapping, both of which are detrimental to ESP<br>
performance. Excessive rapping will lead to more re-entrainment<br>
and under rapping will cause more sparking in ESP, both resulting<br>
in poor performance-of ESP. It is also known in the prior art<br>
that electronic controllers control rapping motors, which drive<br>
hammers to remove ash/dust collected on plates. These electronic<br>
controllers can be of analog or digital type. Irrespective of<br>
p the type of the controller, ON time and OFF time of rapping motor<br>
remain basic parameters for controlling. ON/OFF time i.e. time<br>
period, of a field will vary depending on the particular field's<br>
location with respect to gas flow direction. If the field is<br>
nearer to ESP entry, then the frequency of rapping will be more,<br>
as the dust collection in that field will be more. The frequency<br>
of rapping will reduce towards the end of ESP. The frequency of<br>
rapper operation is determined by three operating parameters<br>
viz., Start-time, Run-time and Repeat-time. Start-time determines<br>
the starting time of rapping motor, Run-time determines how long<br>
a rapper shall run and Repeat-time determines the time gap<br>
between two Start-times. These timings are generally known as<br>
periods of rapping.<br>
In the prior art, mechanisms exist to set the periods directly in<br>
the rapper controller and/or from a master controller. These<br><br><br>
timings are calculated and set based on the dust load entering<br>
each field of the ESP along the gas flow direction and other user<br>
defined methods. Mechanisms also exist to change the rapper<br>
period which is proportional to the plant-operating load, as the<br>
dust load entering the ESP is proportional to the plant-operating<br>
load. But no mechanism presently exists to adjust the periods of<br>
rapping motors in an ESP automatically without human intervention<br>
depending on the ESP-field conditions. The subject invention<br>
seeks to overcome this drawback.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The invention seeks to provide an improved method to monitor<br>
various parameters of the ESP viz., current position of all<br>
rappers with respect to gas flow, healthiness of the fields, and<br>
overall dust load into ESP.<br>
Another object of the invention is to minimise manual<br>
interference in the operation of the rapper motors of ESP,<br>
thereby reducing losses due to human error.<br>
Yet another object is to achieve automatic and continuous<br>
optimisation of rapper operation timings under varying operating<br>
conditions.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The timings of a rapper should change if there is any change in<br>
the healthiness of any ESP-field immediately preceding its own<br><br><br>
ESP-field (i.e. to which it is attached). For example, if first<br>
ESP-field has failed, then second ESP-field will effectively<br>
become first ESP-field with respect to gas flow direction.<br>
pHealthiness of a field means that particularly field is<br>
powered and functioning as expected. Healthiness of a field is<br>
achieved when the particular ESP-field is charged with sufficient<br>
voltage and current between its discharge and collection<br>
plates.Further, the overall dust load into ESP is directly<br>
proportional to the plant-operating load. A plurality of such<br>
monitored parameters are to be communicated to respective rapper<br>
controller. The rapper controller shall then modify the period<br>
of operation of rapper motor automatically without any human<br>
intervention based on these<br>
monitored parameters.<br>
The rapper motor periods are pre-calculated based an ESP<br>
operating parameters., viz., position of the respective field<br>
with respect to gas flow, healthiness of the fields and overall<br>
dust load into ESP. These periods are stored in memory of<br>
microprocessor based rapper controller.<br>
The rapper controller communicates with centralized controller<br>
for ESP for periodic updates of ESP operating parameters. If<br>
there is any change in ESP-field healthiness status, rapper<br>
controller will read new periods for all rapper motors from its<br><br><br>
memory. This process is done without any human intervention.<br>
The invention will now be described in detail with reference to<br>
the accompanying drawings.<br>
Brief description of accompanying drawings :<br>
FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating the processor schematics<br>
of micro-processor based controller with pre-calculated rapper<br>
periods stored in memory unit.<br>
FIG. 2 is a flow diagram of rapper operating periods control<br>
logic.<br>
FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating the method according to<br>
the invention.<br>
This invention deals with an advanced rapper operating method,<br>
which specifically deals with operating rapping system of ESP for<br>
a power plant or process plant. By continuously monitoring the<br>
ESP operating parameters, the rapping time periods of a<br>
particular rapper are continuously adjusted so that the rapping<br>
system gives an optimum rapping. The parameters, which are<br>
monitored continuously, are the position of the particular ESP-<br>
field in which the rapper is connected, healthiness of the<br>
partucular ESP-field and overall dust load into ESP. On<br>
monitoring these parameters continuously, the electronic rapper<br>
controller can decide on whether any of the currently operating<br><br>
time periods are to bechanged or not. If the periods are to be<br>
adjusted based on the monitored parameters, the electronic rapper<br>
controller will retrieve a suitable time period set from its<br>
memory and update its current operatimg time period. The time<br>
periods are pre-calculated based on ESP parameters, viz. position<br>
of the respective field with respect to gas flow, healthiness of<br>
the field and overall dust load into ESP and stored in memory.<br>
This automatic monitoring of ESP parameters and updation of time<br>
periods is done without any human intervention.<br>
In the block diagram shown in Fig. 1, micro-processor (1) is<br>
connected to a plurality of memory units, which are integrated<br>
circuits, through data and control bus. Memory (3) is used to<br>
store the programme of rapper controller. Memory (3) stores<br>
variables of program during execution. The micro-processor is<br>
also connected to the communication interface (2), which acts as<br>
an interface between rapper controller and central computer of<br>
ESP. The monitored data viz., field position with respect to gas<br>
flow, ESP-field healthiness and overall dust load into ESP are<br>
communicated to rapper controller through this communication<br>
interface. On receipt of such parameters, the rapper controller<br>
modifies the current time periods with the new one from its<br>
memory automatically so that the rapping system functions<br>
optimally and effectively.<br><br>
The logic of retrieving new time periods is explained in figure<br>
2. At startup, the rapper controller loads a default time period<br>
(16) into its memory as current time period. It also starts<br>
communication with the central computer for ESP through its<br>
communication interface (2). Using communication, the rapper<br>
controller receives parameter information viz., ESP—field<br>
position with respect to gas flow direction, healthiness of ESP-<br>
field and dust load into ESP, from central computer (17). Upon<br>
checking the parameters, rapper controller decides what action to<br>
take. It may either change the current time period or leave<br>
without any change (18). This process continues as long as the<br>
rapper controller is operating.<br>
Figure 3 shows how the overall system is arranged. The rapper<br>
controller (7) is connected to output card (9), which switches ON<br>
or OFF a rapper motor (12) through a connecting cable. The motor<br>
ON or OFF status is conveyed through a cable to rapper controller<br>
by input card (10). The rapper controller (7) is connected to<br>
central computer of ESP (8) for information on parameters of<br>
interest. The central computer of ESP (8) collects information<br>
on those parameters (11) and communicates them to rapper<br>
controller continuously. After receipt of the information, the<br>
rapper controller decides on changing the time period if<br>
required.<br><br>
The invention thus provides an advanced rapper operating method<br>
for electrostatic precipitators (ESP) comprising a rapper<br>
controller which switches ON or OFF a rapper motor through an<br>
output card, the ON or OFF status of motor being conveyed to<br>
controller by input card, the said rapper controller being<br>
connected to central computer of ESP which collects information<br>
on parameters of interest and communicates to said rapper<br>
controller continuously, the said rapper controller comprising of<br>
a microprocessor connected to a plurality of memories through<br>
data control bus and also to communication interface<br>
characterized in that the time period of the rapper motor is<br>
continuously adjusted depending upon the changes in the said<br>
parameters of interest automatically without any human<br>
intervention.<br><br>
