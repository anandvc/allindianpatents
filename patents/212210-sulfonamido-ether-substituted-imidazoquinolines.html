Sulfonamido Ether Substituted Imidazoquinolines<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to imidazoquinoline compounds that have ether and sulfonamide or sulfamide functionality at the 1-position, and to pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds. A further aspect of this invention relates to the use of these compounds as immunomodulators, for inducing cytokine biosynthesis in animals, and in the treatment of diseases, including viral and neoplastic diseases.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The first reliable report on the lH-imidazo[4,5-c]quinoline ring system, Backman et al., J. Org. Chem. 15, 1278-1284 (1950) describes the synthesis of l-(6-methoxy-8' quinolinyl)-2-methyl-lH-imidazo[4,5-c]quinoline for possible use as an antimalarial agent. Subsequently, syntheses of various substituted lH-imidazo[4,5-c] quinolines were reported. For example. Jain ct a!., J. Med. Chem. 11, pp. 87-92 (1968), synthesized the compound l-[2-(4-piperidyl)ethyl]-lH-imidazo[4,5-c]quinoline as a possible anticonvulsant and cardiovascular agent. Also, Baranov et al., Chem. Abs. 85, 94362 (1976), have reported several 2-oxoimidazo[4,5-c]quinolines, and Berenyi et al., L Heterocyclic Chem. 18, 1537-1540 (1981), have reported certain 2-oxoimidazo[4,5-cjquinolines.<br>
Certain lH-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-4-amines and 1- and 2-substituted derivatives thereof were later found to be useful as antiviral agents, bronchodilators and immunomodulators. These are described in, inter alia, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,689,338; 4,698,348; 4,929,624; 5,037,986; 5,268,376; 5,346,905; and 5,389,640, all of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
There continues to be interest in the imidazoquinoline ring system. Certain IH-imidazo[4,5-c] naphthyridine'4-amines, IH-imidazo [4,5-c] pyridin-4-amines, and IH-imidazo[4,5-c] quinolin-4-amines having an ether containing substituent at the 1 position are known. These are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,268,376; 5,389,640; 5,494,916; and WO 99/29693.<br>
There is a continuing need for compounds that have the ability to modulate the immune response, by induction of cytokine biosynthesis or other mechanisms.<br><br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
We have found a new class of compounds that are useful in inducing cytokine biosynthesis in animals. Accordingly, this invention provides imidazoquinoIine-4-amine and tetrahydroimidazoquinoline-4-amine compounds that have an ether and sulfonamide or sulfamide containing substituent at the 1-position. The compounds are defined by Formulas (I) and (II), which are defined in more detail infra. These compounds share the general structural formula<br><br>
wherein X, R1, R2, and R are as defined herein for each class of compounds having Formulas (I) and (II),<br>
The compounds of Formulas (I) and (II) are useful as immune response modifiers due to their ability to induce cytokine biosynthesis and otherwise modulate the immune response when administered to animals. This makes the compounds useful in the treatment of a variety of conditions such as viral diseases and tumors that are responsive to such changes in the immune response.<br>
The invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions containing the immune response modifying compounds, and methods of inducing cytokine biosynthesis in an animal, treating a viral infection in an animal* and/or treating a neoplastic disease in an animal by administering a compound of Formula (I) or (II) to the animal.<br>
In addition, the invention provides methods of synthesizing the compounds of the invention and novel intermediates useful in the synthesis of these compounds.<br><br>

Preparation of the Compounds<br>
Compounds of the invention can be prepared according to Reaction Scheme I where R, R1, R2, X and n are as defined above.<br>
In step (1) of Reaction Scheme I a 2,4-dichloro-3-nitroquinoline of Formula X is reacted with an amine of Formula R1-O-X-NH2 to provide a 2-chloro-3-nitroquinolin-4-amine of Formula XI. The reaction can be carried out by adding the amine to a solution of a compound of Formula X in a suitable solvent such as chloroform or dichloromethane and optionally heating. Many quinolines of Formula XI are known or can be prepared using known synthetic methods, see for example, Andre et al., U,S. Patent No. 4,988,815 and references cited therein. Many amines of Formula R1-0'X-NH2 are known; some are commercially available and others can by prepared using known synthetic methods.<br>
In step (2) of Reaction Scheme I a 2-chloro-3-nitroquinolin-4-amine of Formula XI is reduced to provide a 2-chloroquinoline'3,4-diamine of Formula XII. Preferably, the reduction is carried out using a conventional heterogeneous hydrogenation catalyst such as platinum on carbon or palladium on carbon. The reaction can conveniently be carried out on a Parr apparatus in a suitable solvent such as ethanol, isopropanol or toluene.<br>
In step (3) of Reaction Scheme I a 2'Chloroquinoline-3,4-diamine of Formula XII is reacted with a carboxylic acid or an equivalent thereof to provide a 4-chloxo-lH-imidazo[4,5-c]quinoline of Formula XIII. Suitable equivalents to carboxylic acid include orthoesters and 1,1-diaIkoxyalkyl alkanoates. The carboxylic acid or equivalent is selected such that it will provide the desired R2 substituent in a compound of Formula XIIL For example, triethyl orthoformate will provide a compound where R2 is hydrogen and triethyl orthoacetate will provide a compound where R2 is methyl. The reaction can be run in the absence of solvent or in an inert solvent such as toluene. The reaction is run with sufficient heating to drive off any alcohol or water formed as a byproduct of the reaction.<br>
Alternatively, step (3) can be carried out by (i) reacting the diamine of Formula XII with an acyl halide of Formula R2C(0)C1 and then (ii) cyclizing. In part (i) the acyl halide<br><br>
is added to a solution of the diamine in an inert solvent such as acetonitrile or dichloromethane. The reaction can be carried out at ambient temperature.   The product can be isolated using conventional methods. In part (ii) the product of part (i) is heated in an alcoholic solvent in the presence of a base. Preferably the product of part (i) is refluxed in ethanol in the presence of an excess of triethylamine or heated with methanolic ammonia.<br>
In step (4) of Reaction Scheme I a 4-chloro-lH-imidazo[4,5-c]quinoline of Formula XIII is aminated to provide a lH-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-4-amine of Formula I. The reaction is carried out by heating (e.g., 125-175°C) a compound of Formula XIII under pressure in a sealed reactor in the presence of a solution of ammonia in an alkanol. The product or a phannaceutically acceptable salt thereof can be isolated using conventional methods.<br><br><br>
is tert-butoxycarbonyI and R11 is -R6-alkyl, -R6-aryl, -R6-heteroaryl or -R6-heterocyclyl where R6 is as defined above.<br>
In step (1) of Reaction Scheme II the amino group of an aminoalcohol of Formula XIV is protected with a tert-butoxycarbonyl group. A solution of the aminoalcohol in tetrahydrofuran is treated with di-tert-butyl dicarbonate in the presence of a base such as sodium hydroxide. Many aminoalcohols of Formula XIV are commercially available; others can be prepared using known synthetic methods.<br>
In step (2) of Reaction Scheme II a protected aminoalcohol of Formula XV is converted to an iodide of Formula XVI. Iodine is added to a solution of triphenylphosphine and imidazole in dichloromethane; then a solution of a protected aminoalcohol of Formula XV in dichloromethane is added. The reaction is carried out at ambient temperature.<br>
In step (3) of Reaction Scheme II a lH-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin*l-yl alcohol of Formula XVII is alkylated with an iodide of Formula XVI to provide a lH-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-l-yl ether of Formula XVIII. The alcohol of Formula XVII is reacted with sodium hydride in a suitable solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide to form an alkoxide. The iodide is added to the alkoxide solution at ambient temperature. After the addition is complete the reaction is stirred at an elevated temperature (-lOO°C). Many compounds of Formula XVII are known, see for example, Gerster, U.S. Patent 4,689,338; others can readily be prepared using known synthetic routes, see for example, Gerster et al., U.S. Patent No. 5.605,899 and Gerster, U.S. Patent No. 5,175,296,<br>
In step (4) of Reaction Scheme II a lH--imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-l-yl ether of Formula XVIII is oxidized to provide a lH-imidazo[4,5-c]quinoline-5N-oxide of Formula XIX using a conventional oxidizing agent capable of forming N-oxides. Preferably a solution of a compound of Formula XVIII in chloroform is oxidized using 3-chloroperoxybenzoic acid at ambient temperature.<br>
In step (5) of Reaction Scheme II a lH-imidazo[4,5-c]quinoline-5N-oxide of Formula XIX is aminated to provide a lH-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-4-amine of Formula XX. Step (5) involves (i) reacting a compound of Formula XIX with an acylating agent and then (ii) reacting the product with an aminating agent. Part (i) of step (5) involves reacting an N-oxide of Formula XIX with an acylating agent. Suitable acylating agents include alkyl- or arylsulfonyl chlorides (e.g., benezenesulfonyl chloride, methanesulfonyl<br><br>
chloride, p-toluenesulfonyl chloride), Arylsulfonyl chlorides are preferred. Para-toluenesulfonyl chloride is most preferred. Part (ii) of step (5) involves reacting the product of part (i) with an excess of an aminating agent. Suitable aminating agents include ammonia (e.g., in the form of ammonium hydroxide) and ammonium salts (e.g., ammonium carbonate, ammonium bicarbonate, ammonium phosphate). Ammonium hydroxide is preferred. The reaction is preferably carried out by dissolving the N-oxide of Formula XIX in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane or 1,2-dichloroethane with heating if necessary, adding the aminating agent to the solution, and then slowly adding the acylating agent. Optionally the reaction can be carried out in a sealed pressure vessel at an elevated temperature (85-100°-),<br>
In step (6) of Reaction Scheme II the protecting group is removed by hydrolysis under acidic conditions to provide a lH-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-4-amine of Formula XXI. Preferably the compound of Formula XX is treated with hydrochloric acid/ethanol at ambient temperature or with gentle heating.<br>
In step (7) of Reaction Scheme II a IHA-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin'4-amine of Fonnula XXI is converted to a sulfonamide of Formula XXII which is a subgenus of Formula I using conventional synthetic methods. For example, a compound of Formula XXI can be reacted with a sulfonyl chloride of Formula RnS(02)Cl. The reaction can be carried out by adding a solution of the sulfonyl chloride in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane or 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone to a solution of a compound of Formula XXI at ambient temperature. Alternatively, a compound of Formula XXI can be reacted with a sulfonic anhydride of Formula RuS(02)OS(02)R11. The reaction can be run at ambient temperature in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane in the presence of a base such as pyridine or N,N-diisopropylethylamine, The product or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof can be isolated using conventional methods.<br><br><br>
Compounds of the invention containing a sulfonamide group can be prepared according to Reaction Scheme III where R, R2, R3, R4, R11, X and n are as defined above and BOC is tert-butoxycarbonyl.<br>
In step (1) of Reaction Scheme III the amino group of an aminoalcohol of Formula XXIII is protected with a tert-butoxycarbonyl group. A solution of the aminoalcohol in tetrahydrofuran is treated with di-/e/t-butyl dicarbonate in the presence of a base such as sodium hydroxide. Many aminoalcohols of Formula XXIII are commercially available; others can be prepared using known synthetic methods.<br><br>
In step (2) of Reaction Scheme III a protected amino alcohol of Fonnula XXIV is converted to a methanesulfonate of Formula XXV. A solution of a compound of Formula XXIV in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane is treated with methanesulfonyl chloride in the presence of a base such as triethylamine. The reaction can be carried out at a reduced temperature (0°C),<br>
In step (3a) of Reaction Scheme III a methanesulfonate of Formula XXV is converted to an azide of Formula XXVI. Sodium azide is added to a solution of a compound of Formula XXV in a suitable solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide or tctrahydrofuran. The reaction can be carried out at an elevated temperature (80 - 100'*C).<br>
In step (3b) of Reaction Scheme III a compound of Formula XXVI is alkylated with a halide of Formula Hal-R3 to provide a compound of Formula XXVII. In compounds where R3 is hydrogen this step is omitted. The compound of Formula XXVI is reacted with sodium hydride in a suitable solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide to form the anion and then combined with the halide. The reaction can be carried out at ambient temperature.<br>
In step (4) of Reaction Scheme III an azide of Formula XXVI or XXVII is reduced to provide an amine of Formula XXVIIL Preferably, the reduction is carried out using a conventional heterogeneous hydrogenation catalyst such as palladium on carbon. The reaction can conveniently be carried out on a Parr apparatus in a suitable solvent such as methanol or isopropanol.<br>
In step (5) of Reaction Scheme III a 4-chloro-3-nitroquinoline of Formula XXIX is reacted with an amine of Formula XXVIII to provide a 3-nitroquinoline of Formula XXX. The reaction can be carried out by adding an amine of Formula XXVIII to a solution of a compound of Formula XXIX in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane in the presence of a base such as triethylamine. Many quinolines of Fonnula XXIX are known compounds or can be prepared using known synthetic methods, see for example, U.S. Patent 4,689,338 and references cited therein.<br>
In step (6) of Reaction Scheme III a 3-nitroquinoline of Formula XXX is reduced to provide a 3-aminoquinoline of Formula XXXI. Preferably, the reduction is carried out using a conventional heterogeneous hydrogenation catalyst such as platinum on carbon. The reaction can conveniently be carried out on a Pan* apparatus in a suitable solvent such as toluene.<br><br>
In step (7) of Reaction Scheme III a compound of Formula XXXI is reacted with a carboxylic acid or an equivalent thereof to provide a lH-imidazo[4,5-c]quinoline of Formula XVIII. Suitable equivalents to carboxylic acid include orthoesters, and 1,1-dialkoxyalkyl alkanoates. The carboxylic acid or equivalent is selected such that it will provide the desired R2 substituent in a compound of Formula XVIII. For example, triethyl orthoformate will provide a compound where R2 is hydrogen and triethyl orthovalerate will provide a compound where R2 is butyl The reaction can be run in the absence of solvent or in an inert solvent such as toluene. The reaction is run with sufficient heating to drive off any alcohol or water formed as a byproduct of the reaction. Optionally a catalytic amount of pyridine hydrochloride can be included.<br>
Alternatively, step (7) can be carried out by (i) reacting a compound of Formula XXXI with an acyl halide of Formula R2C(0)C1 and then (ii) cyclizing. In part (i) the acyl halide is added to a solution of a compound of Formula XXXI in an inert solvent such as acetonitrile or dichloromethane, The reaction can be carried out at ambient temperature or at a reduced temperature. In part (ii) the product of part (i) is heated in an alcoholic solvent in the presence of a base. Preferably the product of part (i) is refluxed in ethanol in the presence of an excess of triethylamine or heated with methanolic ammonia.<br>
Steps (8), (9), (10) and (11) are carried out in the same manner as steps (4), (5), (6) and (7) of Reaction Scheme II.<br>

In step (1) of Reaction Scheme IV a lH-imidazo[4,5-c?]quinolin- 4-amine of Formula XXI is reacted with sulfiiryl chloride to generate in situ a sulfamoyl chloride of Formula XXXII. The reaction can be carried out by adding a solution of sulfiiryl chloride in dichloromethane to a solution of a compound of Formula XXI in dichloromethane in the presence of 1 equivalent of 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine. The reaction is preferably carried out at a reduced temperature (-78°C).<br>
In step (2) of Reaction Scheme IV an amine of Formula HNR5R1] is reacted with the sulfamoyl chloride of Formula XXXII to provide a sulfamide of Formula XXXIII which is a subgenus of Formula 1. The reaction can be carried out by adding a solution containing 2 equivalents of the amine and 2 equivalents of triethylamine in dichloromethane to the reaction mixture from step (1). The addition is preferably carried out at a reduced temperature (-78°C). After the addition is complete the reaction mixture can be allowed to warm to ambient temperature. The product or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof can be isolated using conventional methods.<br><br><br>

CYTOKINE INDUCTION IN HUMAN CELLS<br>
An in vitro human blood cell system is used to assess cytokine induction. Activity is based on the measurement of interferon and tumor necrosis factor (a) (IFN and TNF, respectively) secreted into culture media as described by Testerman et. al. In 'Cytokine Induction by the Immunomodulators Imiquimod and S-27609", Journal of Leukocyte Biology, 58, 365-372 (September, 1995). Blood Cell Preparation for Culture<br>
Whole blood from healthy human donors is collected by venipuncture into EDTA vacutainer tubes. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are separated from whole blood by density gradient centrifugation using Histopaque®-1077. The PBMCs are washed twice with Hank's Balanced Salts Solution and then are suspended at 3-4 x 106 cells/mL in RPMI complete. The PBMC suspension is added to 48 well flat bottom sterile tissue culture plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA or Becton Dickinson Labware, Lincoln Park, NJ) containing an equal volume of RPMI complete media containing test compound. Compound Preparation<br>
The compounds are solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The DMSO concentration should not exceed a final concentration of 1% for addition to the culture wells. Incubation<br>
The solution of test compound is added to the first well containing RPMI complete and serial dilutions are made in the wells. The PBMC suspension is then added to the<br><br>
wells in an equal volume, bringing the test compound concentrations to the desired range. The final concentration of PBMC suspension is 1.5-2 X 106 cells/mL. The plates are covered with sterile plastic lids, mixed gently and then incubated for 18 to 24 hours at 37°C in a 5% carbon dioxide atmosphere. Separation<br>
Following incubation the plates are centrif	uged for 5-10 minutes at 1000 rpm (--200 X g) at 4°C. The cell-free culture supernatant is removed with a sterile polypropylene pipet and transferred to sterile polypropylene tubes. Samples are maintained at -30 to -70°C until analysis. The samples are analyzed for interferon-a and for tumor necrosis factor-a by ELISA* Interferon (a) and Tumor Necrosis Factor (a) Analysis by ELISA<br>
Interferon-a concentration is determined by ELISA using a Human Multi-Species kit from PBL Biomedical Laboratories, New Brunswick, NJ. Results are expressed in pg/mL.<br>
Tumor necrosis factor-a concentration is determined using ELISA kits available from Genzyme, Cambridge, MA; R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN; or Pharmingen, San Diego, CA- Results are expressed in pg/mL.<br>
The table below lists the lowest concentration found to induce interferon and the lowest concentration found to induce tumor necrosis factor for each compound.
