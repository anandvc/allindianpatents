				<td>The present invention relates to a sucrose synthase for the production of Transgenic Plants.<br>
The invention relates to optimization of the production of recombinant sucrose synthase (SS) in soluble, active form employing an appropriate strain of Escherichia coli, the use of SS for making kits for determination of' sucrose, design of optimized forms of SS for the synthesis of ADPglucose (ADPG), and the production of transgenic plants whose leaves and storage tissues accumulate high levels of ADPG and amylose-enriched starch as a result of overproduction of cytosolic ADPG in plants which overexpress SS.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Starch is the main storage form of carbohydrates in plants. It accumulates in large amounts in organs such as seeds (wheat, barley, maize, pea, etc.) and tubers (potato and yam among others) and is a fundamental constituent of the human diet. Furthermore, starch is widely used in the paper, cosmetic, pharmaceutical and food industries, and is also used as an essential component for the manufacture of, biodegradable plastics and environment-friendly paints.'Since it. is made up of covalently bound glucose molecules, investigation of the processes involved in the synthesis of this polysaccharide is a top priority in various areas of industrial production.<br>
ADPG is the universal precursor of starch biosynthesis in plants, both in heterotrophic  organs' (Fig. 1A) and in leaves (Fig. 2A), and it is widely assumed that.its<br>
production is controlled exclusively by the enzyme ADPG<br>
pyrophosphorylase (AGPase) or ADPG synthase (EC<br>
2.7.7.27) (Okita T.W. (1992) Is there an alternative<br>
pathway for starch synthesis? Plant Physiol. 100 560-<br>

in transgenic potatoes leads to sugar-storing tubers<br>

storage protein genes. EMBO J. 11 1229-1238; Stark<br>

Stonewall U. (2005) No time to shift the paradigm on<br>
the metabolic pathway to transitory starch in leaves.<br>
Trends Plant Sci. at press). The various applications<br>
of the starch produced in a plant are based mainly on<br>
the ratio of amylose and amylopectin which determines<br>
the structure of the starch grain as well as its<br>
viscosity in aqueous suspensions. This ratio of amylose<br>
and amylopectin depends on among other things the<br>
concentration of ADPG in the plant cell (Clarke B.R.<br>

relationship between the rate of starch synthesis the<br>

SS (EC 2.4.1.13 SS) (UDP-glucose:D-fructose-2-glucosyl<br>
transferase) is a reversible enzyme that catalyses the<br>
production of UDPG and fructose from sucrose and UDP.<br>
Although as shown in Fig. 1A SS has classically been<br>
regarded as having the role of producing UDPG<br>
metabolic processing of which eventually gives rise to<br>
the production of starch in heterotrophic tissues such<br>
as endosperm and tubers (Zrenner R.  Salanoubat M.<br>

crucial role of sucrose synthase for sink strength<br>

potential ability of the enzyme to use other nucleotide<br>
diphosphates in vitro for the production of the<br>
corresponding sugar nucleotides (Murata T. Sugiyama<br>

relevance (Okita T.W. (1992) Is there an alternative<br>
pathway for starch synthesis? Plant Physiol. 100 560-<br>

in transgenic potatoes leads to sugar-storing tubers<br>
and influences tuber formation and expression of tuber<br>
storage protein genes. EMBO J. 11 1229-1238) it has<br>
been suggested that SS is capable of producing ADPG<br>
directly which can be used for the production of<br>
starch both in heterotrophic tissues and in<br>
photosynthetic tissues (Figs. IB and 2B) (Pozueta-<br>

ADPglucose linked to starch biosynthesis occurs outside<br>
the chloroplast in source leaves. Proc. Natl. Acad.<br>
Sci. USA 101 13080-13085). According to this<br>
hypothesis (based solely and circumstantially on<br>
evidence of the biochemical type) SS is responsible<br>
for the synthesis of an important pool of ADPG<br>
molecules necessary for the biosynthesis of starch.<br>
This hypothesis has not however been demonstrated<br>
experimentally by genetic engineering or traditional<br>
crop improvement techniques and is not consistent with<br>
the countless tests of the genetic and molecular type<br>
indicating that AGPase is the only source of ADPG in<br>
plants (Okita T.W. (1992) Is there an alternative<br>
pathway for starch synthesis? Plant Physiol. 100 560-<br>

E.H. Hausler R.E. Stonewall U. (2005) No time to<br>

transitory starch in leaves. Trends Plant Sci. at<br>
press).<br>
Sugar nucleotides such as UDPG and ADPG are produced<br>
commercially from pyrophosphorylase reactions catalysed<br>
by enzymes such as UDPG pyrophosphorylase (UGPase) and<br>
AGPase respectively based on the use of an expensive<br>
substance called glucose-1-phosphate (G1P). An<br>
alternative to this practice for production of sugar<br>
nucleotides is based on the use of SS development of<br>
which has largely been hampered by the limitations of<br>
Escherichia coli for expressing and efficiently<br>
processing a large number of eukaryotic proteins. This<br>
limitation inspired some researchers to produce<br>
recombinant SS by making use of biological factories of<br>
the eukaryotic type such as yeasts (Zervosen A.<br>

characterization of recombinant sucrose synthase I from<br>
Solanum tuberosum L. for carbohydrate engineering. J.<br>
Biotechnology 107 135-149). Alternatively SS intended<br>
for the production of sugar nucleotides has had to be<br>
purified by expensive processes of purification of<br>
proteins from plant extracts (patent DE4221595 (1993)<br>
Purified sucrose synthase enzyme useful for production<br>
of nucleotide-activated sugars or oligosaccharides).<br>
This SS obtained from plant extracts has the<br>
disadvantage that it has a predilection for UDP and<br>
very low affinity for ADP (Pressey R (1969) Potato<br>

in activity associated with maturation. Plant Physiol.<br>

has recently been achieved (Nakai T. Tonouchi N.<br>

However the production of SS in this prokaryotic<br>
system was associated with problems such as (1) the<br>
amount of SS produced was very low (30 microgramsgram<br>
of bacteria Nakai T. Tonouchi N. Tsuchida T.<br>

epiphytic orchid Oncidium goldiana. Physiol. Plantarum<br>
118 352-360) (2) the amount of active SS obtained was<br>
very low or zero (0.05-1.5 unitsmg (Nakai T.<br>
Tonouchi N. Tsuchida T. Mori H. Sakai F.<br>

149) (3) the recombinant SS had to be purified by<br>
conventional methods of purification of proteins such<br>
as chromatography electrophoresis isoelectric<br>
focusing etc. which combined prove expensive and do<br>
not guarantee purification of the protein in a<br>
homogeneous state and (4) most of the SS is sent to<br>
inclusion bodies or is accumulated in the form of<br>
inactive aggregates as a result of the inability of the<br>
bacterium's machinery to fold the protein correctly<br>
(Miroux B. Walker J.E. (1996) "Over-production of<br>
proteins in Escherichia coli: mutant hosts that allow<br>
synthesis of some membrane proteins and globular<br>
proteins at high levels" J. Mol. Biol. 260 289-298).<br>
The present invention describes the development of a<br>
system based on the use of an appropriate strain of E.<br>
coli and on the use of a suitable expression vector<br>
that permits the large-scale production and fast and<br>
easy purification of different variants of recombinant<br>
SS in its active form. Some of these variants have<br>
greater affinity for ADP than those obtained from plant<br>
extracts and can be used both for the production of<br>
UDPG and ADPG from inexpensive substances such as<br>
sucrose UDP and ADP.<br>
Chromatographic techniques constitute a powerful tool<br>
for determining the sucrose content of complex samples<br>
such as plant extracts sera urine fruit juice<br>
wines fruit and foodstuffs (D'Aoust M-A. Yelle S<br>

fruit sucrose synthase decreases fruit setting and the<br>
sucrose unloading capacity of young fruit. Plant Cell<br>

C.L. Sorensen H. Vidal-Valverde C. (1996) J.<br>
Chromatogr. A 719 213-219). Such techniques require<br>
highly specialized technical personnel and involve a<br>
large investment in equipment. Unfortunately<br>
alternative methods based on hydrolysis of the sucrose<br>
molecule by the action of the enzyme invertase and<br>
subsequent spectrophotometric or fluorimetric<br>
determination of the molecules of glucose andor<br>
fructose (Sweetlove L.J. Burrell M.M. ap Rees T.<br>

Nectars from Fruits and Vegetables of the European<br>
Economic Community) are subject to limitations of a<br>
technical nature such as subtraction of the<br>
measurements corresponding to the endogenous glucose<br>
andor fructose present in the sample. The abundance of<br>
glucose andor fructose in the sample can add<br>
background noise that hampers reliable and accurate<br>
determination of sucrose. In the vast majority of cases<br>
it is necessary to carry out exhaustive controls before<br>
issuing a reliable statement on the true sucrose<br>
content of a sample (Worrell A.C. Bruneau J-M.<br>
Summerfelt K. Boersig M.  Voelker T.A. (1991)<br>
Expression of a maize sucrose phosphate synthase in<br>
tomato alters leaf carbohydrate partitioning. Plant<br>
Cell 3 1121-1130). Kits for determination of sucrose<br>
based on the use of invertase are available from<br>
companies such as Sigma Biopharm GmbH and Megazyme.<br>
Alternatively an automated method of sucrose<br>
determination has been developed based on<br>
determination of the glucose-1-phosphate released by<br>
the action of sucrose phosphorylase of bacterial origin<br>
(Vinet B. Panzini B. Boucher M.  Massicotte J.<br>
(1998) Automated enzymatic assay for the determination<br>
of sucrose in serum and urine and its use as a marker<br>
of gastric damage. Clin. Chem. 44 2369-2371) . The<br>
present invention describes the development of a<br>
simple reliable and inexpensive alternative method for<br>
the determination of sucrose in a sample based on the<br>
use of SS and coupling enzymes which hydrolyse ADPG or<br>
UDPG.<br>
Considerations concerning the factors governing the<br>
intracellular levels of ADPG have mainly revolved<br>
around regulation of the synthesizing enzyme AGPase<br>
(Press (1988) Biosynthesis of starch and its<br>
regulation. The Biochemistry of Plants. Vol. 14<br>
Academic Press New York p. 182-249; Pozueta-Romero<br>
J. Perata P. Akazawa T. (1999) Sucrose-starch<br>
conversion in heterotrophic tissues. Crit. Rev. Plant.<br>
Sci. 18 489-525) . In fact a high proportion of the<br>
patents and scientific publications concerning the<br>
production of ADPG and the production of plants<br>
producing starches of industrial interest revolve<br>
around the use of AGPase (Stark D.M. Timmerman K.P.<br>
Barry G.F. Press J. Inshore G.M. (1992)<br>
Regulation of the amount of starch in plant tissues by<br>
ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase. Science 258 287-282;<br>
Slattery C.J. Kavakli H. Okita T.W. (2000)<br>
Engineering starch for increased quantity and quality.<br>
Trends Plant Sci. 5 291-298). However although they<br>
are yet to be confirmed with evidence of the<br>
geneticmolecular type recent scientific studies of a<br>
biochemical type indicate that as shown in Figs. IB<br>
and 2B SS might be involved in the direct synthesis of<br>
ADPG necessary for the biosynthesis of starch (Baroja-<br>
Fernandez E. Munoz F.J. Saikusa T. Rodriguez-<br>
Lopez M. Akazawa T. Pozueta-Romero J. (2003)<br>
Sucrose synthase catalyzes the de novo production of<br>
ADPglucose linked to starch biosynthesis in<br>
heterotrophic tissues of plants. Plant Cell Physiol.<br>
44 500-509). This hypothesis is especially<br>
controversial bearing in mind that (a) SS has never<br>
been linked to starch production in leaves (b)<br>
presence of an ADPG translocator is required in the<br>
membranes of the plastids connecting the cytosolic<br>
pool of the ADPG produced by SS to the starch synthase<br>
present inside the plastid and (c) the involvement of<br>
an ADPG producing source is in direct conflict<br>
with many tests of the biochemicalgeneticmolecular<br>
type which appear to show that AGPase is the only<br>
source of ADPG (Okita T.W. (1992) Is there an<br>
alternative pathway for starch synthesis? Plant<br>
Physiol. 100 560-56; Muller-Robber B. Stonewall U.<br>
Wurlitzer L. (1992) Inhibition of the ADPglucose<br>
pyrophosphorylase in transgenic potatoes leads to<br>
sugar-storing tubers and influences tuber formation and<br>
expression of tuber storage protein genes. EMBO J. 11<br>
1229-1238; Stark D.M. Timmerman K.P. Barry G.F.<br>
Press J. Inshore G.M. (1992) Regulation of the<br>

Hausler R.E. Stonewall U. (2005) No time to shift<br>
the paradigm on the metabolic pathway to transitory<br>
starch in leaves. Trends Plant Sci. at press). Perhaps<br>
for all these reasons to date plants have never been<br>
designed that overexpress SS for the production of high<br>
levels of starch. However the present invention<br>
describes for the first time the production of<br>
transgenic plants that overexpress SS for increasing<br>
their production of ADPG and starch. Conversely we<br>
show that plants that are deficient in starch as a<br>
result of absence of AGPase possess normal ADPG levels.<br>
This all shows that as shown in Figs. IB and 2B SS is<br>
involved in the direct synthesis of the ADPG required<br>
for the biosynthesis of starch and is responsible for<br>
the synthesis of most of the ADPG accumulated in the<br>
plant cell.<br>
Although based on the approach presented in Fig. 1A<br>
according to which SS is involved in the synthesis of<br>
UDPG (but not ADPG) in storage tissues various works<br>

overexpression of SS could be used for the production<br>
of plants with high starch content as a result of the<br>
increase in levels of ADPG in accordance with the<br>
metabolic schemes shown in Figs. IB and 2B. However<br>
based on the ability of SS to produce the precursor<br>
molecule of the biosynthesis of cell wall<br>
polysaccharides (UDPG) works have been published and<br>
patented which describe the production of cotton plants<br>
with high fibre content or cereals with high content of<br>
celluloses as a result of overexpression of SS<br>

The invention relates firstly to the development and<br>
optimization of a method of production of large amounts<br>
of recombinant SS that is soluble can be purified<br>
easily and has high specific activity based on the use<br>
of a suitable strain of E. coli and on the use of an<br>
expression vector that makes it possible to obtain SS<br>
with a histidine tail. The invention further relates to<br>
the procedure followed for making kits for<br>
determination of sucrose based on the use of the enzyme<br>
product with SS activity coupled to enzymes that<br>
metabolize ADPG or UDPG. It further relates to<br>
optimization of the production of sugar nucleotides<br>
such as ADPG or UDPG starting from variants of SS<br>
specially designed for this purpose. Finally details<br>
are given of the design of transgenic plants with high<br>
content of sucrose ADPG and starch and a high<br>

SS.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Amplification of a cDNA that encodes an SS<br>
Knowing the nucleotide sequence of wild-type sucrose<br>
synthase SS4 (Fu H. Park W.D. (1995) Sink- and<br>
vascular-associated sucrose synthase functions are<br>
encoded by different gene classes in potato. Plant Cell<br>
7 1369-1385) two specific primers were created<br>
corresponding to the 5' and 3' ends of the gene. Using<br>
these primers a 2418 base pair DNA fragment<br>
designated SSX from a potato-leaf cDNA library was<br>
amplified by conventional PCR techniques. This PCR<br>
fragment was inserted in the pSK Bluescript plasmid<br>
(Stratagene) giving rise to the pSS construction (Fig.<br>
3A)  which was amplified in the host bacterium XLl<br>
Blue.<br>
Production of active recombinant SS from a special<br>
strain of E. coli<br>
pSS was digested with the Ncol and NotI restriction<br>
enzymes. The fragment released (which contains the cDNA<br>
encoding SS SSX) was cloned on the same restriction<br>
sites of the pET-28a(+) expression plasmid (Novagen)<br>
(Fig. 3B) which possesses a nucleotide sequence in the<br>
polylinker region that encodes a histidine-rich<br>
sequence which becomes fused with the recombinant<br>
protein. The resulting plasmid (designated pET-SS Fig.<br>
3C) was inserted by electroporation in various strains<br>
of E. coli. The E. coli strain BLR(DE3) (Novagen)<br>
transformed with pET-SS was deposited in the Spanish<br>
Type Culture Collection on 29 October 2003 located in<br>
the Research Building of Valencia University Burjassot<br>
Campus Burjassot 46100 (Valencia Spain) with the<br>
deposition number CECT:5850. The bacteria were<br>
incubated at 20°C in LB medium. Overexpression of SSX<br>
was effected by addition of 1 mM isopropyl-(3-Dthiogalactopyranoside<br>
(IPTG) in 100 ml of cell culture<br>
grown at 20°C. After six hours of induced culture the<br>
bacteria were collected and resuspended in 4 ml of<br>
binding buffer (Novagen His-bind purification kits)<br>
then sonicated and centrifuged at 40000 g for 20<br>
minutes. The supernatant which contains the<br>
recombinant SS with an amino acid sequence rich in<br>
histidine residues at the N-terminal end was passed<br>
through an affinity column of the His-bind protein<br>
purification kit from Novagen. Following the<br>
instructions with the kit SS was eluted with 6 ml of<br>
the recommended elution buffer which contained 200 mM<br>
of imidazole instead of 1 mol. After elution the<br>
protein was quickly submitted to dialysis to remove any<br>
trace of imidazole which inactivates SS irreversibly.<br>
Production of an isoform of SS optimized for production<br>
of ADPG<br>
Using suitable primers with pSS as template the<br>
mutated variant SS5 was designed giving rise to the<br>
construction pSS5. This was done using the QuikChange<br>
Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). pSS5 was<br>
digested with Ncol and Notl. The fragment released<br>
(which contains SS5) was cloned on the same restriction<br>
sites of the pET-28a(+) expression plasmid giving rise<br>
to pET-SS5 which was inserted by electroporation in £.<br>
coli BLR(DE3). The E. coli strain XL1 Blue transformed<br>
with pSS5 was deposited in the Spanish Type Culture<br>
Collection on 29 October 2003 located in the Research<br>
Building of Valencia University Burjassot Campus<br>
Burjassot 46100 (Valencia Spain) with the deposition<br>
number CECT:5849.<br>
Production of transgenic plants that overexpress SS4<br>
In the present invention SS was overexpressed (a)<br>
constitutively (b) specifically in leaves and (c)<br>
specifically in storage organs such as tubers.<br>
For the production of plants that overexpress SS<br>
constitutively constructions were created that were<br>
controlled by the action of the 35S constitutive<br>
promoter of the tobacco mosaic virus. Successive<br>
insertion in pSS of the 35S promoter and NOS terminator<br>
in the 5' and 3' regions of SSX gave rise to the<br>
production of the plasmid p35S-SS-NOS the restriction<br>
map of which is shown in Fig. 4B.<br>
So as to be able to transfer this construction to the<br>
genome of the plants via Agrobacterium tumefaciens it<br>
must first be cloned in a binary plasmid. For this<br>
p35S-SS-NOS was digested successively with the enzymes<br>
NotI T4 DNA polymerase and Hindlll and was cloned<br>
within the binary plasmid pBIN20 (Fig. 4A) (Hennegan<br>
K.P. Danna K.J. (1998) pBIN20: An improved binary<br>
vector for Agrobacteriurn-mediated transformation. Plant<br>
Mol. Biol. Rep. 16 129-131) which had previously been<br>
digested successively with the enzymes EcoRI T4 DNA<br>
polymerase and Hindlll. The plasmid thus obtained was<br>
designated pBIN35S-SS-NOS (Fig. 4C).<br>
To overexpress SS specifically in illuminated leaves<br>
PCR was used for amplifying the promoter region<br>
(designated RBCS) of the gene that encodes the small<br>
subunit of RUBISCO (ribulose-15-bisphosphate<br>
carboxylaseoxygenase) of tobacco (Barnes S.A.<br>
Knight J.S. Gray J.C. (1994) Alteration of the<br>
amount of the chloroplast phosphate translocator in<br>
transgenic tobacco affects the distribution of<br>
assimilate between starch and sugar. Plant Physiol.<br>
106 1123-1129). This nucleotide seguence (which<br>
confers specific expression in photosynthetically<br>
active cells) was inserted in the pGEMT-easy vector<br>
(Promega) giving rise to pGEMT-RBCSprom (Fig. 5A) .<br>
This construction was digested with Hindlll and Ncol<br>
and the fragment released was cloned in the<br>
corresponding restriction sites of p35S-SS-NOS giving<br>
rise to pRBCS-SS-NOS (Fig. 5B) . This construction was<br>
digested successively with Hindlll T4 DNA polymerase<br>
and Notl. The fragment released was cloned in pBIN20<br>
digested successively with Hindlll T4 DNA polymerase<br>
and EcoRI. The resulting construction was designated<br>
pBINRBCS-SS-NOS (Fig. 5C).<br>
After being amplified in E. coli (XL1 Blue) both<br>
pBIN35S-SS-NOS and pBINRBCS-SS-NOS were inserted in A.<br>

Preparation of assay kits for determination of sucrose<br>
One of the kits designed for the determination of<br>
sucrose shown in the following Scheme I of enzymatic<br>
reactions involved in the kit for<br>
spectrophotometricfluorimetric determination of<br>
sucrose based on the conversion of sucrose to a sugar<br>
nucleotide and then conversion of this to glucose-1-<br>
phosphate glucose-6-phosphate and NAD(P)H.<br>
Sucrose<br>
The kit is based on the action of SS on the sucrose<br>
molecule in the presence of a nucleotide diphosphate<br>
(e.g. UDP or ADP) releasing equimolar amounts of<br>
fructose and the corresponding sugar nucleotide. If the<br>
resulting from the reaction is UDPG<br>
this is submitted to the action of hydrolytic enzymes<br>
of UDPG such as UDPG pyrophosphatase of the Nudix type<br>
(EC 3.6.1.45) (Yagi T. Baroja-Fernandez E.<br>
Yamamoto R. Munoz F.J. Akazawa T. Pozueta-Romero<br>
J. (2003) Cloning expression and characterization of a<br>
mammalian Nudix hydrolase-like enzyme that cleaves the<br>
pyrophosphate bond of UDP-glucose. Biochem. J. 370<br>

hydrolase (5'-nucleotidase): regulation of the<br>
ushA gene and the signal sequence of its encoded<br>
protein product. Nucl. Acids Res. 14 4325-4342) . The<br>
G1P released by the action of these hydrolytic enzymes<br>
is transformed by the action of phosphoglucomutase<br>
(PGM) yielding glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) which in its<br>
turn can be made to undergo a coupling reaction with<br>
NAD(P)+ by the action of the enzyme G6P dehydrogenase<br>
(G6PDH) producing 6-phosphogluconate and NAD(P)H<br>
which can easily be determined by fluorimetry and by<br>
spectrophotometry at 340 nm. In its turn the NAD(P)H<br>
released can be coupled to the action of FMNoxidoreductase<br>
luciferase yielding light which is<br>
quantified spectrophotometrically.<br>
Alternatively as shown in scheme II the UDPG produced<br>
can be coupled with UDPG dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.22)<br>
which in the presence of NAD gives rise to equimolar<br>
amounts of UDP-glucuronate and NADH which can be<br>
determined by fluorimetry or by spectrophotometry at<br>
340 nm. In its turn the NADH released can be coupled<br>
to the action of FMN-oxidoreductaseluciferase<br>
yielding light which is quantified<br>
spectrophotometrically.<br>
of the reaction catalysed by the SS is<br>
ADPG this is submitted to the action of hydrolytic<br>
enzymes of ADPG such as bacterial ADPG pyrophosphatase<br>
(EC 3.6.1.21) (Moreno-Bruna B. Baroja-Fernandez E.<br>

pyrophosphatase prevents glycogen biosynthesis in<br>
Escherichia coll. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 98 8128-<br>
8132). The G1P released is transformed by the action of<br>
phosphoglucomutase yielding glucose-6-phosphate (G6P)<br>
which can in turn be made to undergo a coupling<br>
reaction with NAD(P)+ by the action of the enzyme G6P<br>
dehydrogenase producing 6-phosphogluconate and<br>
NAD(P)H which can easily be determined by fluorimetry<br>
or spectrophotometry at 340 ran.<br>
In any case the schemes of enzymatic reactions coupled<br>
to the production of a sugar nucleotide mediated by SS<br>
are perfectly suitable for application to amperometric<br>
detection.<br>
EXAMPLES OF CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Examples are described below which show in detail the<br>
procedure for cloning a cDNA that encodes an isoform of<br>
SS of potato in a suitable expression vector and in a<br>
strain of E. coli optimized for the production and<br>
accumulation of the enzyme in its active form. Other<br>
examples describe the use of the recombinant SS for<br>
making assay kits for the determination of sucrose in<br>
plant samples serum urine fruit juices sweetened<br>
fruit drinks refreshing drinks etc. Another example<br>
describes the use of variants of SS optimized for the<br>
large-scale production of sugar nucleotides such as<br>
UDPG and ADPG. Finally another example describes the<br>
production of plants with high content of sucrose ADPG<br>
and starch and a high amyloseamylopectin ratio as a<br>
result of the high ADPG-producing activity in plants<br>
that overexpress SS.<br>
Example 1: Expression in Escheri.ch.ia coll BLR (DE3) <br>
of a recombinant SS with a histidine tail which can be<br>
purified easily and has high specific activity<br>
Knowing the nucleotide sequence of the SS4 gene that<br>
encodes an isoform of SS of potato it was possible to<br>
create two specific primers whose sequences are in the<br>
5' - 3' direction SEQ ID NO: 1 and SEQ ID NO: 2. Using<br>
these primers a DNA fragment designated as SSX was<br>
amplified by conventional methods of PCR from a potato<br>
tuber cDNA library and this was inserted in a pSK<br>
Bluescript plasmid (Stratagene) which was amplified in<br>
the host bacterium XL1 Blue. The nucleotide sequence of<br>
SSX is SEQ ID NO: 3 which is slightly different from<br>
SS4 (GenBank accession number U24087) . The amino acid<br>
sequence deducted from SEQ ID NO: 3 is slightly<br>
different from SS4 and is therefore designated SSX. The<br>
amino acid sequence deducted after expression of SEQ ID<br>
NO: 3 in the pET-28a( + ) plasmid is SEQ ID NO: 4 which<br>
includes a histidine-rich sequence of 38 amino acids<br>
fused with the amino-terminal end of the amino acid<br>
sequence deducted from SEQ ID NO: 3.<br>
Production of SSX in BL21(DE3) bacteria transformed<br>
with pET-SS was induced on adding 1 mM IPTG. After six<br>
additional hours of culture at 37°C it was observed<br>
that the bacteria transformed with pET-SS accumulated a<br>
protein in aggregated form the size of which<br>
corresponds to SS. However these bacteria did not have<br>
SS activity. This failure in the expression of an<br>
active form of SS can be attributed to the problems<br>
that E. coli has in the correct folding of certain<br>
eukaryotic proteins of high molecular weight (Miroux<br>
B. Walker J.E. (1996) "Over-production of proteins in<br>
Escherichia coli: mutant hosts that allow synthesis of<br>
some membrane proteins and globular proteins at high<br>
levels" J. Mol. Biol. 260 289-298). With the aim of<br>
overcoming this problem the capacity for production of<br>
active SS in other bacterial strains and at a<br>
temperature of 20°C was investigated. In all of them<br>
production of SSX was induced on adding 1 mM of IPTG.<br>
After 6 hours of additional incubation the bacteria<br>
were sonicated and centrifuged. The resulting<br>
supernatant was analysed for SS activity. In these<br>
conditions as shown in Fig. 6 the BLR(DES) strain<br>
proved to be the most efficient from the standpoint of<br>
production of soluble active SS. The E. coli strain<br>
BLR(DE3) (Novagen) transformed with pET-SS was<br>
deposited in the Spanish Type Culture Collection on 29<br>
October 2003 with the deposition number CECT:5850. The<br>
contribution of recombinant SSX in the total protein<br>
pool of CECT:5850 is approximately 20% compared to the<br>
very low productivity of recombinant SS (30 micrograms<br>
per gram of bacteria) described in the literature<br>

centrifugation at 10000 g for 10 minutes. The<br>
supernatant was applied to a preparative-scale HPLC<br>

Production of ADPG required the generation of a mutated<br>
form of SS with an affinity for ADP much greater than<br>
that described for the SS extracted from plant tissues<br>

This isoform designated SS5 was obtained by point<br>
mutagenesis of SSX using the QuikChange Site-Directed<br>

following pairs of primers whose sequences are [SEQ ID<br>

[SEQ ID NO: 9 SEQ ID NO: 10] . The nucleotide sequence<br>
obtained designated SS5 is SEQ ID NO: 11. The changes<br>
in the amino acid sequence of SS5 (Susy 5) relative to<br>
SS4 -Susy 4- (present in databases) are shown shaded in<br>

expression of SEQ ID NO: 11 in the pET-28a( + ) plasmid<br>
is SEQ ID NO: 12 which includes a histidine-rich<br>
sequence of 38 amino acids fused with the aminoterminal<br>
end of the amino acid sequence deducted from<br>

The recombinant SS5 obtained after expression of pETSS5<br>
had a Vmax of 80 unitsmg of protein and 65<br>
unitsmg of protein in the presence of UDP and ADP<br>
respectively. The affinities for UDP and ADP in the<br>
presence of 500 mM sucrose were very similar (Km = 0.2<br>
mM both for ADP and for UDP)  whereas the Km for<br>
sucrose was 30 mM and 100 mM in the presence of<br>
saturated concentrations of UDP and ADP respectively.<br>
These kinetic parameters are very different from those<br>
described for the SS extracted from potato tuber and<br>
other organs of other species according to which the<br>
Vmax of the enzyme is 10 times higher in the presence<br>
of UDP than in the presence of ADP (Pressey R (1969)<br>

Determination of the amount of sucrose present in the<br>
test sample is based on fluorimetric determination or<br>
spectrophotometric determination (at 340 nm) of the<br>
NAD(P)H produced according to the coupled reactions<br>
shown in schemes I and II.<br>
For determining the sucrose content of barley seeds<br>
with different degrees of development (Fig. 7) the<br>
reactions took place in 300-microlitre wells of an<br>
ELISA plate for 3 minutes at 37°C. The volume of the<br>
test sample was 20 microlitres and the volume of the<br>
cocktail resulting from combination of reagents a-g<br>
(kit #1) and a-e (kit #2) was 280 microlitres. The<br>
blanks contained all the components of the cocktail<br>
except SS. Measurement was carried out with a MultiSkan<br>
spectrophotometer. The values obtained both with the<br>
kit of type "1" and with the kit of type "2" were found<br>
to be comparable to those determined using<br>
chromatographic techniques described in the<br>
introduction (Baroja-Fernandez E. Munoz F.J.<br>
Saikusa T. Rodriguez-Lopez M. Akazawa T. Pozueta-<br>
Romero J. (2003) Sucrose synthase catalyzes the de<br>
novo production of ADPglucose linked to starch<br>
biosynthesis in heterotrophic tissues of plants. Plant<br>
Cell Physiol. 44 500-509).<br>
Example 4: Production of transgenic plants that<br>
overexpress SS<br>
Figs. 8-10 present the results obtained in leaves of<br>
potato plants that overexpress SS both constitutively<br>
(35S-SS-NOS) and specifically (RBCS-SS-NOS).<br>
As shown in Fig. 8 the SS activity in the leaves of<br>
any of these plants is 2-10 times higher than in the<br>
same organ of a wild-type plant (WT) . These leaves had<br>
the following characteristics:<br>
1. Clear correlation between the ADPG-producing SS<br>
activity (Fig. 8) and levels of starch (Fig. 9) and<br>
ADPG (Fig. 10). This characteristic was observed not<br>
only in leaves but also in storage tissues such as<br>
tubers and seeds (see below).<br>
2. High starch content (Fig. 9) relative to leaves of<br>
wild-type plants. For example the starch content of<br>
a leaf of a "wild-type" potato plant grown in a<br>
photoperiod of 8 hours light16 hours darkness and<br>
at 20°C is 5 micromolgram of fresh weight whereas<br>
a leaf of a transgenic plant that overexpresses SS<br>
is 8 micromolgram fresh weight. The differences<br>
between wild-type and transgenic plants are<br>
accentuated when the photoperiod is long so that<br>
the leaves of a plant that overexpresses SS contains<br>
4 times more starch than those of a wild-type plant.<br>
3. High ADPG content relative to the same tissue or<br>
organ of the untransformed plant (Fig. 10) . The<br>
average content in a leaf of a wild-type potato<br>
plant grown in a photoperiod of 8 hours light16<br>
hours darkness and at 20°C is 0.35 nanomolgram of<br>
fresh weight whereas the leaves of the plants that<br>
overexpress SS can have a content of 2.5<br>
nanomolgram of fresh weight.<br>
4. Both ADPG and starch exhibit transitory accumulation<br>
over the photoperiod (Fig. 11) . The rate of<br>
accumulation of both substances maintains a positive<br>
correlation with the SS activity indicating that<br>
contrary to what is suggested by the "classical"<br>
model of starch biosynthesis (Fig. 2A) and<br>
confirming the hypothesis of the "alternative" model<br>
shown in Fig. 2B SS plays a fundamental role in the<br>
production of ADPG and in the link between sucrose<br>
metabolism and starch metabolism.<br>
5. Normal levels of soluble sugars such as glucose and<br>
fructose. However the levels of glucose-6-P and<br>
sucrose in transgenic leaves are higher than those<br>
observed in the wild-type potato leaves (Table 2).<br>
Table 2: Levels of metabolites (expressed in nmolg<br>
fresh weight) in leaves of control plants (WT) and 35SSuSy-<br>
NOS source leaves. Values significantly different<br>
from those observed in WT are shown in bold.<br>
6. The external morphology of the plants that<br>
overexpress SS is not aberrant when compared with<br>
that of the untransformed plants.<br>
Figs. 12-14 show the results obtained in potato tubers<br>
that overexpress SS constitutively (35S-SS-NOS). These<br>
results are essentially identical to those observed in<br>
tubers that overexpress SS under the control of a<br>
specific tuber promoter (promoter of the patatina<br>
gene).<br>
As shown in Fig. 12 the SS activity in the tubers of<br>
any of these plants is ??? times greater than in the<br>
same organ of a wild-type plant. These tubers had the<br>
following characteristics:<br>
1. Clear correlation between the ADPG-producing SS<br>
activity (Fig. 12) and levels of starch (Fig. 13)<br>
and ADPG (Fig. 14).<br>
2. High starch content (Fig. 13) relative to tubers<br>
of untransformed plants. For example the starch<br>
content in the tuber of the "wild-type" plant is<br>
approximately 300 micromolgram of fresh weight<br>
(equivalent to 54 mg of starchgram of fresh<br>
in a tuber that overexpresses SS<br>
it is 450-600 micromolgram fresh weight.<br>
3. High ADPG content relative to tubers of wild-type<br>
plants (Fig. 14). The average content in a wildtype<br>
tuber is 5 nanomolgram of fresh weight<br>
whereas the tubers that overexpress SS can have a<br>
content of 7-9 nanomolgram of fresh weight.<br>
The results obtained in rice seeds tomato and tobacco<br>
leaves as well as tomato fruits are qualitatively<br>
similar to those shown in Figs. 8-14. In all cases<br>
there was an increase in the content of starch and an<br>
increase in the amyloseamylopectin ratio.<br>
The production of plants with high content of ADPG and<br>
starch following overexpression of SS is a result that<br>
is totally unexpected according to the current ideas on<br>
the biosynthesis of starch (illustrated in Figs. 1A and<br>
2A) and perhaps explains why the design of plants that<br>
overexpress SS has not previously been adopted as a<br>
strategy for increasing starch production. The results<br>
obtained on the basis of this work suggest that SS but<br>
not AGPase is the fundamental source of ADPG that<br>
accumulates in plants. According to the models that are<br>
still current AGPase is the only source of ADPG.<br>
Surprisingly however ADPG levels have never been<br>
investigated in AGPase-deficient plants. To explore the<br>
significance of our invention we analysed the levels<br>
of ADPG and starch in Arabidopsis and potato plants<br>
with reduced AGPase activity for the first time. As<br>
shown in Fig. ISA the levels of starch in AGPasedeficient<br>
TL25 Arabidopsis plants (Lin T.P. Caspar<br>
T. Somerville C.R. Press J. (1988) Isolation and<br>
characterization of a starchless mutant of Arabidopsis<br>
thaliana lacking ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase activity.<br>
Plant Physiol. 88 1131-1135) are lower than those<br>
observed in the WT plants. However the levels of ADPG<br>
are normal (Fig. 15B). In contrast the levels of<br>
starch in AGP62 and AGP85 potato plants (Muller-Robber<br>
. Stonewall U. Wurlitzer L. (1992) Inhibition of<br>
the ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase in transgenic potatoes<br>
leads to sugar-storing tubers and influences tuber<br>
formation and expression of tuber storage protein<br>
genes. EMBO J. 11 1229-1238) are reduced relative to<br>
those observed in leaves of wild-type plants (Fig.<br>
16A). However the levels of ADPG are completely normal<br>
(Fig. 16B). Taken together these observations (a) show<br>
that SS and not AGPase is the principal source of<br>
ADPG in plants and (b) highlight the significance of<br>
our invention after demonstrating that overexpression<br>
of SS gives rise to plants with high starch content.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE DIAGRAMS<br>
Fig. 1: Mechanisms of starch biosynthesis in<br>
heterotrophic organs. (A) "Classical" mechanism<br>
according to which SS is involved in the production of<br>
UDPG which is eventually converted to starch after the<br>
combined action of UDPG pyrophosphorylase (UGPase)<br>
cytosolic phosphoglucomutase (PGM) plastidial<br>
phosphoglucomutase ADPG pyrophosphorylase (AGPase) and<br>
starch synthase. (B) "Alternative" mechanism according<br>
to which SS is involved in the direct production of<br>
ADPG in the cytosol. The ADPG is then transported to<br>
the amyloplast by the action of a translocator. Once<br>
inside the amyloplast the starch synthase utilizes the<br>
ADPG for producing starch.<br>
Fig. 2: Mechanisms of biosynthesis of starch in leaves.<br>
(A) "Classical" mechanism according to which the entire<br>
process of starch biosynthesis takes place inside the<br>
chloroplast. According to this view starch metabolism<br>
and sucrose are not connected. Moreover SS does not<br>
take part in the gluconeogenic process.<br>
(B) "Alternative" mechanism of starch biosynthesis<br>
according to which SS is involved in the direct<br>
synthesis of ADPG in the cytosol. The ADPG is then<br>
transported to the interior of the plastid where the<br>
starch synthase utilizes it as substrate for the<br>
reaction of starch synthesis.<br>
