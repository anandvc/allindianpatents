<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
 <br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to novel cinamic compounds which are useful as agents for the prevention or treatment of diseases associated with histone deacetylase (HDAC). They also can be used as agents for enhancing the neurite outgrowth. In particular, they can be used as agents for anti-cancer, anti-diabetic, or anti-neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, Spinocerebellar Ataxias (SCA) and human spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).<br>
Background of the Invention [0002] Eukaryotic DNA is highly organized and packaged in the nucleus. The organization and packaging are achieved through the addition of proteins, including core histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4, which form a complex structure, the chromatin, together with DNA. The modification of core histones is of fundamental importance to conformational changes of the chromatin. The level of acetylation is related to transcription activity, and then the acetylation induces an open chromatin conformation that allows the transcription machinery access to promoters. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) and histone acetyltransferase (HAT) are enzymes that influence transcription by selectively deacetylating or acetylating the £-amino groups of lysine located near the amino termini of core histone proteins. HDACs are a family of 18 enzymes (isoforms) that may act as master regulators of many diseases, including cancer, because they are involved in the control of gene expressions. Disruption of HDACs has been linked to a wide variety of human cancers. HDAC enzymes or isoforms appear to be involved in many different types of cancer.<br>
[0003]    Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are emerging as an exciting new class of potential anticancer agents for the treatment of solid and hematological malignancies. In recent<br>
 <br>
years, an increasing number of structurally diverse HDAC inhibitors have been identified; they inhibit proliferation and induce differentiation and/or apoptosis of tumor cells in cultures and in animal models. HDAC inhibition causes acetylated nuclear histones to accumulate in both tumoral and normal tissues, providing a surrogate marker for the biological activity of HDAC inhibitors in vivo. The effects of HDAC inhibitors on gene expression are highly selective, leading to transcriptional activation of certain genes such as the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAFI/CIP1 but repression of others. HDAC inhibition results in acetylation of not only histones but also transcription factors such as p53, GATA-1 and estrogen receptor-alpha. The functional significance of acetylation of non-histone proteins and the precise mechanisms whereby HDAC inhibitors induce tumor cell growth arrest, differentiation and/or apoptosis are currently the focus of intensive research. HDAC inhibitors currently in clinical trials have shown activity and represent a class of molecularly targeted anti-tumor agents with potential for efficacy based on a novel mechanism of action.<br>
[0004] A review article published in Medicinal Research Reviews, Vol. 26, No. 4, pp. 397-413, 2006 states that four classes of HDAC inhibitors, short-chain fatty acids, hydroxamic acids, benzamides and cyclic peptides, had been reported. Hydroxamic acid-based hybrid polar compounds (HPCs) are HDAC inhibitors, which induce differentiation at micromolar or lower concentrations (Journal of the National Cancer Institute, Vol. 92, No. 15, August 2, 2000, pp. 1210-1216). U.S. Pat. No. 6,174,905, EP 0847992, JP 258863/96, and Japanese Application No. 10138957 disclose that benzamide derivatives induce cell differentiation and inhibit HDAC. SNDX-275 (Entinostat) especially disclosed in Example 48 of U.S. Pat. No. 6,174,905 has become a candidate for cancer treatment drug. WO 01/38322 discloses additional compounds that serve as HDAC inhibitors.   It is reported in Hum Genet, 2006, 120, pp. 101-110 that the<br>
 <br>
benzamide M344 up-regulates SMN2 protein expression in fibroblast cells derived from SMA patients up to 7-fold after 64 hours of treatment. It is reported that sodium butyrate ameliorates phenotypic expression in a transgenic mouse model of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (Human Molecular Genetics, 2004, Vol. 13, No. 11, pp. 1183-1192). Trichostatin A, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, was found to induce ubiquitin-dependent cyclin Dl degradation in MCF-7 breast cancer cells (Molecular Cancer 2006, 5:8). U.S. Pat. No. 7,169,801 discloses that compounds having the formula of Z-Q-L-M or Z-L-M may be used to inhibit histone deacetylase. US Patent Number 6888027 covers a family of Sulphonamide HDAC inhibitors including PXD101. European Patent Number EP 1 301 184 covers the use of valproic acid and derivatives as HDAC inhibitors in the treatment of solid tumors. WO0222577 indicates that hydroxamate compounds are inhibitors of histone deacetylase and are useful aspharmaceuticals for the treatment of proliferative diseases. Moreover, the anti-diabetic activity of HDAC inhibitors is reported in the FASEB Journal, 2008, Vol. 22, pp. 944-945 and Diabetes, 2008, Vol. 57, pp. 860-867.<br>
[0005] N,N'-hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA) is an effective inducer of differentiation in a number of transformed cell lines. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,087,367 and RE38506 reports that a number of compounds related to HMBA with polar groups separated by apolar linkages on a molar basis, are as active or 100 times more active than HMBA. Furthermore, U.S. Pat. No. 7,399,787 reports that histone deacetylase inhibitors related to HMBA such as suberoylanilide hydroxamide acid (SAHA) have the ability to induce growth arrest, differentiation and/or apoptosis of tumor cells. In addition, Laurence Catley et al. reports that NVP-LAQ824 (a hydroxamic acid derivative) and NVP-LAQ824 (a derivative of 4-aminomethylcinnamic hydroxamic acid) are potent histone deacetylase inhibitors (Blood, 1 October 2003, Vol. 102, No.<br>
 <br>
7, pp. 2615-2622). George P et al. reports that LBH589 induces growth inhibition and regression in tumor cell lines by triggering apoptosis and LBH589 is now being tested in phase I clinical trials as an anticancer agent (Blood 105(4): 1768-76 February 15, 2005). Other histone deacetylase inhibitors known in the art include pyroxamide, M-carboxycinnamic acid bishydroxamide (CBHA), trichostatin A (TSA), trichostatin C, salicylihydroxamic acid (SBHA), azeiaic bishydroxamic acid (ABHA), azelaic-]-hydroxamate-9-anilide (AAHA), 6-(3-chlorophenylureido) carpoic hydroxamic acid (3C1-UCHA), oxamflatin, A-161906, scriptaid, PXD-101, cyclic hydroxamic acid-containing peptide (CHAP), ITF-2357, MW2796, MW2996, trapoxin A, FR901228 (FK 228 or Depsipeptide), FR225497, apicidin, CHAP, HC-toxin, WF27082, chlamydocin, sodium butyrate, isovalerate, valerate, 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA), 4-phenylbutyrate sodium (PBS), arginine butyrate, propionate, butyramide, isobutyramide, phenyl acetate, 3-bromopropionate, tributyrin, valproic acid, valproate, CI-994, 3'-amino derivative of MS-27-275, MGCD0103 and Depudecin (U. S. Publication No. 20080242648).<br>
[0006]    However, there is still a need to develop a new class of HDAC inhibitors to prevent or treat cancers and other diseases involving HDAC.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
[0007]    The object of the invention is to provide a group of compounds represented by the following formula (1):<br>

[0013] Figure 6 shows the effects of NBM-HB-OS01 derivatives on the biological activity in various human cancer cell lines. As shown in Fig. 6(a), inhibition of the cell growth of human breast cancer MDA-MB-23I cells was observed after treating the cells with various concentrations of NBM-C-BCX-OS01, NBM-C-BMX-OS01, and NBM-C-BFX-OS01 (4c) for 72 hrs. The NBM-HB-OS01 derivatives significantly inhibited the growth of human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. The treated cells counted by a trypan blue exclusion assay are shown in Fig. 6(b). Figs. 6(c) and (d) shows the results of treatment of Human lung cancer A549 cells and Human glioblastoma 05-MG cells with NBM-C-BCX-OS01 and NBM-C-BMX-OS01 for 72 hrs, respectively, Fig. 6(e) shows that NBM-C-BCX-OS01 arrested the growth of Human glioma Hs683 cells. Human glioma Hs683 cells were treated with NBM-C-BCX-OS01 (1.0, 2.0, 4.0 ug/mL) for 72 hrs.<br>
[0014] Figure 7 shows the effects of NBM-C-BCX-OS01 and NBM-C-BMX-OS01 on histones and associated  proteins.     Human  glioma Hs683  cells were treated  with various<br>
 <br>
concentrations of NBM-C-BCX-OS01 and NBM-C-BMX-OS01 for 72 hrs. As shown in Fig. 7(a), the induction of acetylated Hsp90 and gelsolin proteins was detected in a dose-dependent manner, i.e., Hsp90 and CTPS proteins decreased in a dose-dependent manner. It can be observed in Fig. 7(b) that the expression of p21, acetylated tubulin, acetylated Histone H3, and acetylated Histone H4 was significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner. SAHA was used as a positive control and p-actin as an internal control.<br>

Example 9 Effects of the invention (NBM-HB-OS01) on mRNA expression of Rat C6<br>
glioma cells<br>
[0084]    The cell-cycle related mRNA expression was examined by RT-PCR. The total RNA<br>
was isolated from the treated Rat C6 glioma cells using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) as<br>
 <br>
described by the manufacturer. The cDNA was produced from 500 ng of total RNA using ReverTra-Plus-TM (TOYOBO). The RT product (lµl) was amplified by PCR with primers for amplification of several genes (p21, cyclin Bl, and cyclin Dl) for the cell cycle analyses and GAPDH was used as an internal control. Rat C6 glioma cells were treated with NBM-HB-OS0I for 48 hours, and as shown in Fig. 1(d), NBM-HB-OS01 induced p21 mRNA expression. Example 10 Effects of the invention on the cell cycle of various human cancer cells [0085] Human lung cancer A549 cells, Human glioma Hs683 cells and Human glioblastoma 05-MG cells were seeded 1×106 cells in a 100-mm dish. After 24 hours of incubation in DMEM+10% BSA, Human lung cancer A549 cells were treated with NBM-HB-OS01 (2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0 µg/mL) for 24 hours and were treated with NBM-C-BCX-OS01 (2.5, 5.0, 7.5 µ.g/mL) and NBM-C-BMX-OS01 (2.5, 5, 7.5 ug/mL) for 72 hours. Human glioblastoma 05-MG cells were treated with NBM-C-BCX-OS01 (1.0, 2.0, 4.0 µg/mL) and NBM-C-BMX-OS01 (1.0, 2.0, 4.0 µg/mL) for 72 hours. Human glioma Hs683 cells were treated with NBM-C-BCX-OS01 (1.0, 2.0, 4.0 µg/mL), For cell cycle analysis, cells were fixed in 80% ethanol for 1 hour (or overnight) at -20°C and then incubated with 2 ug/mL RNase A for 30 minutes at 37°C. Cells were stained with propidium iodide (5g/mL P1) in PBS and analyzed using a Becton Dickinson flow cytometer, BD FACScan and CellQuest acquisition and analysis programs. The results of Fig.1(c) show that NBM-HB-OS01 arrested the human lung cancer A549 cells on the G0/G1 phase in a dose-dependent manner. Human lung cancer A549 cells were inhibited by various concentrations (2.5, 5, 7.5 µg/mL) of NBM-C-BCX-OS01 and NBM-C-BMX-OS01 for 72 hours (see Fig.6(c)) and Human glioblastoma 05-MG cells were inhibited by various concentrations (1.0, 2.0, 4.0 µg/mL) of NBM-C-BCX-OS01 and NBM-C-BMX-OS01 for 72 hours (see Fig.6(d)). Human glioma Hs683 cells were treated with NBM-C-BCX-OS01  (1.0, 2.0, 4.0<br>
 <br>
µg/mL) for 72 hours. NBM-C-BCX-OS01 could arrest the growth of Human glioma Hs683 cells (see Fig. 6(e)).<br>
Example 11 Up-regulation of the HDAC associated proteins was observed after treatment of the compounds of the inventions<br>
[0086] Rat C6 glioma cells, Human breast cancer MCF-7 cells, and Human lung cancer A549 cells were seeded in 6-well plates. After 24 hrs of incubation in medium+10% BSA, Human breast cancer MCF-7 cells were treated with NBM-HB-OS01 (10.0 u.g/mL) and vorinostat (SAHA, 5 µ.M) for 24 hours. Rat C6 glioma cells were treated with NBM-C-BX-OS01 (7.5µg/mL) and vorinostat (SAHA, 5uM) for 6 hours. Human lung cancer A549 cells were treated with NBM-C-BA-OS01 (7.5µg/mL) and vorinostat (SAHA, 5 µM) for 6 hours. The treated cells were fixed in 80% methanol for 30 minutes and then washed 3 times with PBS solution. Cells were permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 for 30 minutes, and then blocked in 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in PBS-T (0.1% Twin 20 in PBS) for 1 hour. The treated cells were detected with primary antibody against acetyl-Histone H3, acetyl-tubulin, and Gelsolin. Photographs were taken with a Nikon microscope. The results indicated that the compounds of the invention could induce the HDAC associated proteins expression of the various cancer cells (see Fig. 1(g), Fig. 2(e), and Fig. 3(c)).<br>
