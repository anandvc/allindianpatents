2,4-Dinitroimidazole(2,4-DNI)<br>
APPLICANT<br>
Prof. Akamanchi. Krishnacharya Govindacharya,<br>
Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Technology,<br>
Mumbai University Institute of Chemical Technology, Matunga, MUMBAI 400 019 State of Maharashtra, India,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-                                       Original <br>
209/MUM/2002 <br>
05/03/2002	15MAR2004 <br><br>
Field of Invention:<br>
The present process deals with, microwave assisted rearrangement of 1,4-dinitroimidazole (1,4-DNI) to 2,4-dinitroimidazole (2,4-DNI), a less sensitive explosive, high energy propellant and is also a useful pharmaceutical intermediate.<br>
Background and prior art:<br>
In modern ordnance there is a strong requirement for explosives having both good thermal stability, impact sensitivity, and explosive performance. However, these requirements are to some extent mutually exclusive. Those explosives having good thermal stability and impact sensitivity exhibit poorer explosive performances and vice versa. Damavarapu et ai (US Patent No: 5,387,297, 1995) found crystalline 2,4-DNI, a energetic material, to have both good thermal stability and impact insensitivity. The explosives of the prior art are generally less attractive and, unwanted because of many unintentional initiations of munitions by either impact or shock aboard cargo ships, aircraft carriers, ammunition trains, and nuclear warheads.<br>
Apart from the high energetic value, 2,4-DNI and its derivatives are well documented in the literature and studied exclusively for their pharmacological medicinal chemistry. Agrawal et. al (J. Med.chem., Vol.22, No.5, 1979, 583-586) have reported 2,4-DNI and its derivatives to  be  radiosensitizing  agents.   In  the  radiotherapy of<br><br><br>
cancer, the relative resistance of hypoxic cells present in solid tumors is a serious limitation in attempts to increase the therapeutic ratio between tumor and normal tissue damage. Asquith et. al (Radiat.Res., 60, -1974, 108), reported misonidazole, a nitroimidazole derivative to be an effective radiosensitizer of hypoxic cells in at least 16 different animal tumors. However, the high doses of misonidazole required were the limiting factor because of resulting neurotoxicity, convulsions, and peripheral neuropathy in relatively large number of patients. In a systematic approach to design and synthesize various analogues of nitroimidazoles, Agrawal et. al discovered 2,4-DNI as the most promising agent mainly because it exhibited good radiosensitization coupled with low toxicity and mutagenicity, which selectively sensitize hypoxic cells to lethal effects of radiation.<br><br>
2,4-DNI is a valuable starting material for the synthesis of many potent chemotherapeutic agents belonging to the class of nitroimidazoxazine and nitroimidazoxazole.<br><br><br>
Stover et. al {Nature, 405, 2000, 962-966) synthesized a series of nitroimidazoxazines and found that more than 100 of these compounds exhibited, specific activity against the tubercle bacilli. PA-824 is one of the most potent compound (Figure 1). Significantly none of the active compounds have any indication of mutagenicity. Ashtekar et. al {Antimicrob. Agents. Chemother., Vol.37. 1993, 183-186.) also reported number of nitroimidazoxazoles, such as CGI-17341 to be potent anti-tubercular agent (Figure 1).<br>
Few methods are reported in the domain literature for the preparation of 2,4-DNI. Most of them are based on the thermal rearrangement of 1,4-DNI to 2,4-DNI.<br>
Damavarapu et. al (US Patent No. 5,387,297, 1995) reported the smooth transformation of 1,4-DNI to amorphous 2,4-DNI, by placing 1,4-DNI in an open beaker and heating slowly to 95-98째C for 25 mins followed by cooling to room temperature to give amorphous 2,4-DNI which was recrystallized from hot acetonitrile.<br>
S.Bulusu et.al {J.Phys.Chem., 99, 1995, 5009-5015) reported the preparation of 2,4-DNI by thermal rearrangement of 1,4-DNI at 115째C in chlorobenzene overnight, using anhydrous conditions.<br>
K. Nagarajan et. al {Indian Journal of chemistry. Vol 21B, 1982, 1022-1026) synthesized 2,4-DNI by heating a mixture of 1,4-DNI and chlorobenzene with stirring at 120-125째C for 50hours.<br><br><br>
Agrawal et.al (J.Med.Chem., Vol.22, No.5, 1979, 583-586) reported the prepration of 2,4-DNI by nitration of 2-nitroimidazole.<br>
Objective:<br>
The thermal rearrangement of 1,4-DNI to 2,4-DNI by conventional heating is well documented. However, the process suffers with the drawbacks of longer reaction times. Also the molten state rearrangement of 1,4-DNI to 2,4-DNI at 95-98째C is often not reproducible and yields amorphous form of 2,4-DNI. Our main object was to improve the prior art process overcoming the difficulties mentioned above.<br>
Summary of Invention:<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of 2,4-DNI comprising<br>
A)	Nitration of imidazole to 4-nitroimidazole using nitric acid and sulphuric acid<br>
B)	Nitration of 4-nitroimidazole to 1,4-dinitroimidazole (1,4-DNI) using fuming nitric acid, acetic acid, and acetic anhydride<br>
C)	Microwave    assisted    rearrangement    of    1,4-DNI    to    2,4-dinitroimidazole (2,4-DNI) using different solvents.<br><br><br>

Dissolving the collected solid in solvents esters like ethyl acetate (EtOAc), ketones like methyl isobutyl ketone, halogenated solvent like chloroform. Ethyl acetate is the preferred solvent. Drying the organic layer over sodium sulphate and concentrating under reduced pressure at 40째C to give 1,4-DNI as a white solid which can be further purified by crystallization from benzene or carbontetrachloride to white needles.<br><br><br><br>
C) Rearrangement of 1,4-DNI to 2,4-DNI (Scheme 3) as a crystalline solid was carried out by<br>
(Scheme 3)<br>

Cooling the reaction mass to room temperature and filtering to give 2,4-DNI. Re-precipitating the mother liquor with hydrocarbons like hexanes, benzene, toluene, halogenated solvents like chloroform, "carbon tetrachloride; hexane and chloroform are the preferred solvents; to give after filtration second crop of 2,4-DNI, which can be further purified by silica gel column chromatography with EtOAc: hexane (9:1 by volume) or by recrystallization using nitriles like acetonitriie, halogenated solvents like chloroform, alcohols like ethanol, acetonitriie alone and in combination with chloroform is the preferred solvent to give 2,4-DNI as a crystalline solid.<br><br><br>
