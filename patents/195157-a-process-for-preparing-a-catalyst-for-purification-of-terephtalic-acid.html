				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for preparing a catalyst for purification of terephthalic acid. More particularly the invention pertains to a catalyst and a process for their production, which catalysts have been found to be highly effective in purifying tereptithalic acid employed in the synthesis of polyester polymers and copolymers, used in the production of textile fibers.<br>
It is important that terephthatic add used as the monomer for the production of polymer fibers has high purity. The main controlled parameter of terephthalic acid quality is the content of p-carboxybenzaldehyde and colored impurities.<br>
The purified terephthalic acid is produced from less pure, technical or "crude" terephthalic acid by hydropurification of the latter (by treatment in the presence of hydrogen) over the catalysts containing metals of Group VIII. The crude terephthalic acid is dissolved in water at high temperatures and the produced solution is hydrogenated in a shaking reactor within a fixed bed reactor, preferably in the presence of the catalysts containing metals of Group VIII. The purification methods, catalysts and the methods for the production of those catalysts are described in many patents.<br>
Activity and selectivity of the catalyst for hydropurification of terephthalic acid depend on many factors, such as content of VIII group metal or metals in the catalyst, support type, method used for the supporting of metal or metals of Group, VIII, as well as on distribution of metal or metals on the support granule.<br>
There is a known method for hydropurification of crude terephthalic acid [GB patent No. 994769,19651, wherein catalyst composition "Palladium on active carbon" shows high activity in the reaction of purification of terephthalic acid from p-carftoxybenzaldehyde impurities. Other compounds, such as SiO2, A12O3 were studied as supports for palladium. Besides, it was found that carbon supports are the best, since they are not subjected to quick decomposition in the corrosive hot water solutions of terephthalic acid unlike oxide supports.<br>
The effects of the nature of carbon support have been studied. It is known that active carbons prepared from the plant, animal or mineral precursors, preferably from coconut active carbon, are feasible for the production of palladium catalysts for hydropurification of terephthalic acid, it is desirable that the surface area of such active carbon is not tower than 600m2/g, and granule size is 3-6mm. Additional characteristics of such active carbon, namely the value of pH of water suspension is introduced in [US patent No. 4728693, 19881. The possibility to use porous carbon material modified with pyrocarbon as a feasible support is<br>
1A<br><br>
shown in [USSR patent No. 1660282. 1997].<br>
It was shown in [US patents NoNo.4415479. 1983; 4421676. 1983, and 4791226. 1988] that for a more effective process of hydropurification of terephthalic acid from p-carboxybenzaldehyde, it is important to prepare the catalysts with a definite size of the supported palladium. Such panicles should have a size not bigger than 35A. Authors [US patents No.No.4394299. 1983 and 4791226. 1988] also shows the positive effect of such a distribution of the palladium particles in the carbon granule, when they prevail on the external surface of the granule.<br>
It is noticed in many patents, that along with the monometallic catalyst, introduction of Ni, Co. Cu. Fe. Mn. U, Cr to the catalyst composition, as well as Ir, Rh, Pt and Ru. may have a positive effect on the catalytic efficiency of the palladium.<br>
According to other groups of patents [US patents NoNo.4629715, 1986 and 4892972. 1990], the most effective bimetallic catalyst is achieved when the catalysts in the reactor are placed in layers, for example, Pd/C and Rh/C instead of one layer (Rh+Pd)/C. Authors [US patent No.4892972. 1990] have even patented the process using multilayered catalyst, for example, Ru/C + Rh/C + Pd/C.<br>
Typically catalysts containing VIII group metals, in particular, palladium catalysts, are prepared by adsorption of the palladium salt from solution onto the support. In one of the methods [US patent No.2857337, 1967], the salt is treated with a water-soluble metal hydroxyde or basic carbonate with further reduction to metallic palladium with a reducing agent like formaldehyde, glucose, glycerin, etc.<br>
According to Keit et al. [US patent No.3138560, 1967], at the addition of the sodium tetrachlloropallodoate or palladium chloride to many of the carbon supports, most of the palladium is immediately deposited in the form of a glittering film of metallic palladium. Catalysts prepared in such a way typically have low activity. It was supposed, that palladium is directly reduced to metal due to free electrons or due to the presence of such functional groups as aldehydes on the carbon surface. Before the reduction stage, palladium catalysts are usually prepared by fixing palladium in the form of an insoluble compound to avoid the problem of palladium particles migration and crystallites growth, which may arise at the reduction of the palladium from the solution.<br>
P-carboxybenzaldehyde is the most toxic impurity which determines the quality of terephthalic acid which is used for the production of the plastics. P-toluic acid (p-TA) is also an undesirable impurity that should be removed from the water solution of the terephthalic acid produced as the result of hydropurification. Although such a removal may be achieved mainly due to higher solubility of p-toluic acid in water compared to terephthalic acid. significant amounts of p-toluic acid are entrapped in the crystals of purified terephthalic acid in the stage of its crystallization from solution.<br>
2<br><br>
To avoid this accompanying disadvantage in seperating p-tniuic acid, it was proposed to conduct decarbonylation of p-CBA to benzoic acid in water solutions in the presence of the catalyst "palladium on carbon", because benzoic acid is more soluble in water than p-toluic acid [US patent no.3456001, 1969]. However, the above mentioned decarbonylation of p-CBA to benzoic acid produces equimolar amounts of carbon oxide, which is a known poison for noble metals like palladium [US patent No.4201872, 1980]. To minimize the catalyst poisoning in the above mentioned patent, it is proposed to conduct decarbonylation at a relatively lower process" pressure to reduce to the minimum the concentration of the dissolved carbon oxide in the liquid phase. The process pressure should be also controlled within a narrow range of pressures. Liberated carbon oxide is removed from the reactor in the form of a gas.<br>
It is known [US patent No.4892972. 1990] that use in the above mentioned process for the purification of terephthalic acid of the catalytic system including the first catalyst layer, containing VIII group metal fixed on the carbon support, and the second layer of the "palladium on carbon" catalyst, and passing the water solution of crude terephthaiic acid through the above mentioned first layer of the "rhodium on carbon" catalyst, and then through the second layer of the "palladium on carbon" catalyst, minimizes the quantity of p-toluic acid produced in course of the purification of crude terephthalic acid. This method of using of the above mentioned catalytic system does not facilitate hydrogenation of p-CBA to p-toluic acid, but it does facilitate decarbonylation of p-CBA to benzoic acid, which is more soluble in water than p-toluic acid. It, therefore, is more easily separated from terephthalic acid at its crystallization than p-toluic acid. This allows to purify the terephthalic acid solution with higher content of p-CBA at higher economic effect.<br>
The closest method of purification is described in [GB patent No.1578725, 1980], where authors propose to use a catalyst comprising two or more metals, such as Pt, Pd. Rh, Ru, Os, Ir, Fe, Ni, Co, Cr, Mn and U. where one of the metals is Pd or Pt. In the mentioned catalysts the metals are present in the form of alloy, physical mixture, or supported onto the carbon support - active carbon (granules of from 3 to 6mm). Hydropurification is carried out by treating the solution of terephthalic acid with hydrogen in the presence of the mentioned catalysts at high a temperature (280°C) and pressure (~100atm). The rate of the hydrogenation in the presence of bimetallic catalyst (0.4%Pd-0.1%Pt)/C referred to Ig catalyst, is 20% higher than when 0.5%Pd/C is used.<br>
Thus, the crude terephthalic acid, containig p-CBA and other impurities, may be purified by hydrogenation over traditionally prepared catalysts on the base of VIII group supported on carbon.<br>
The invention solves the problem of the creation of selective and stable catalysts and processes wherein the crude terephthalic acid with high content of p-CBA may be selectively<br>
3<br><br>
hydrogenated to p-toluic acid or/and decarbonylated to benzoic acid with low content of the residual p- CBA.<br>
The foregoing problems are solved by. the present invention which relates to a process for preparing a catalyst for purification of terephthalic acid consisting of crystallites of catalytically active palladium or palladium and at least one metal of Group VIII of the Periodic Table deposited on a carbon material wherein said metal crystallites are distributed through the bulk of granules of said carbon material so as within a layer being at a distance from the outer surface of said granule equal to 1 - 30% of the radius thereof, the said process comprising the steps of -<br>
i) contacting granules of carbon material with an aqueous solution of palladium salts or salts of palladium and at least one metal of Group VIII to produce a "metal salt-porous carbon" precursor.<br>
ii) drying said precursor, and<br>
iii) treating said precursor with a reducing agent like hydrogen to reduce surface metal salts to crystallites of said metal, whereby a catalytically active palladium or palladium and at least one metal of Group VIII is deposited upon the surface of said granules to produce a metal or bimetal catalyst, wherein said carbon material is a mesoporous graphite-like material having an average mesopore size in the range of 40 - 400 A, the ratio of mesopores volume in total pore volume at least 0.5,. and graphite-likeness no less than 20%.<br>
The catalyst of this invention includes crystallites of palladium and rhodium or palladium and rhuthenium or palladium and platinum; total content of metals varies from 0.1 to 0.3 % wt, mass ratio of palladium to other metals varies from 0.1 to 10.0.<br>
4<br><br>
The problem is solved also by the development of the process for the production of a catalyst for purification of terephthalic acid by supporting catalytically active palladium or palladium and at least one of the Group VIII metals upon a carbon material, at the contact of said granules with water solution of salts of palladium or salts of palladium and at least one metal of the Group VIII, with the production of the precusor metal salt - porous carbon, wherein the precusor is dried and treated with reducing agent in the amount sufficient to reduce surface metal salts to metal crystallites, wherein said carbon material is used as mesoporous graphite-like material having an average size of mesopores 40 - 400 A, a share of mesopores in total pore volume not less than 0.5 and degree of graphite-likeness not less than 20%, to produce a metal or bimetal catalyst.<br>
The said catalyst is prepared from one of the following, metal precursors :<br>
H2PdCl4 or Pd(NO3)2 ;<br>
H2PdCl4 and RuOHCl3 or RuNO(NO3)3 ;<br>
pd(NO3)2 and RuOHCl3 or RuNO(NO3)3<br>
For the production of said catalyst the nitrate solutions of palladium and/ or ruthenium salts are used with the concentration of the free nitric acid of from 37 to 170 g/1. Bimetallic catalysts are prepared by co-deposition of the metal precursors or by sequent deposition of the metal precursors.<br>
We have found that such a catalyst may be produced if mono- or bimetallic particles of metals of Group VIII are supported on the carbon material having an average pore size of from 40 - 400 A and a significant (from 20 to 60%) degree of graphite-likeness. The said metallic particles are distributed in bulk of the carbon support so that the maximums of their distribution are at a distance from the external surface of said granule equal to 1-30% of<br>
4A<br><br>
the radius thereof.<br>
The above mentioned carbon materials are the supports prepared by thermal processing of plastics, as well as those symhesized by specia technology from gaseous hydrocarbons (V.A. Likholobov et al., React.Kin.Cat.Lett.. v.54. 2 (1995) 381-411), namely Sibunit, KVU and various composites on their base.' Physical-chemical characteristics for some carbons are given in the table l.-Data in the table certify that said carbon materials of such parameters as Vmeso/VE and K are sharply different from traditional active carbons typically used for the production of the catalysts for hydropurification of terephthalic acid produced from plant, animal or mineral precursors, preferably coconut active carbons used for the production of traditional catalysts for hydropurification of terephthalic acid.<br>
We also found that at such distribution of the palladium and rhuthenium particles in the granule of mesoporous carbon material, some of palladium may be substituted by rhuthenium. which results in not only lower catalyst cost (because rhuthenium is cheaper than palladium), but also in the change of the ratio of p-toluic and benzoic acids to the latter, that is favorable for reaching the higher quality of the produced crystalline terephthalic acid.<br>
For the production of the said catalysts, i.e. catalysts containing mono- or bimetallic particles of palladium and rhuthenium supported on carbon support, the well known in the literature methods, like impregnation of the support with the solutions of various salts of Pd and Ru may be used. However, as was found, the best catalysts are produced if the method of . spraying of acidic salts of Pd and Ru on a feasible carbon support is used with further treatment of the supported metal precursors with hydrogen.<br>
The given below examples 1-35 characterize catalytic compositions and the methods for their production. Examples 7, 30~34 are given for comparison, and examples 8 and 35 are given as prototypes. Examples 36-39 describe the methods for terephthalic acid purification. Analysis results of the character of metal particles distribution in the support granule and of the quality of terephthalic acid purified using proposed catalytic compositions, are given in tables 2-6.<br>
Example 1<br>
50g carbon support Sibunit 1 (data on its physical-chemical and texture properties are given in table 1) are loaded to the cylindric rotating reactor. Hereinafter the support is preliminarily purified from the dust by boiling it in distilled water. Then it is discharged to the screen with the cell size of lmm, washed with distilled water and dried at 120°C to the constant weight. Water solutions of Na2CO3 (0.364mole/l; 13ml) and H2PdCl4 (0.182mole/l; 13ml) at the same flow rate (2.5ml/min) at mole ratio of Na2CO3H2PdCl4=2:1 are fed to the injector and the produced mixture is sprayed into the reactor. The catalyst is discharged and dried in a vacuum at 75°C to the constant weight. The next stage of reduction is conducted in the tubular reactor in a hydrogen stream at a temperature of 250°C for 2hr. The temperature is<br>
5<br><br>
reduced from 250°C to 40°C, and at 110°C the hydrogen is substituted by nitrogen. The catalyst is washed with distilled water till there is no reaction of AgNO3 with chlorine ions in the washing water, and dried in vacuum at 75°C till the constant weight. Pd/Sib.l catalyst is produced with palladium content of 0.5wt%.<br>
Electron microsonding of the catalyst granules is conducted by scanning the cut of granule by diameter on microanalyzer MAP-3 with probe of l~2µm diameter at an accelerating voltage of 20kV and current of 20~30nA. Parameter ? characterizing the thickness of the active layer of metal in µn per 1/2 peak height, is used as the characteristics of distribution of active component in catalyst grain.<br>
The data on the distribution of Pd and Ru particles in the catalytsts was prepared in accordance with the given examples, are given in table 2.<br>
Example 2<br>
The catalyst is prepared using the procedure of example 1, except RuOHCb (0.191 mole/1; 13ml) is used as the water solution instead of H2PdCl4, and concentration of Na2CO3 solution (13ml) corresponds to 0.382mole/l; Na:CO3 ; H2PdCl4 = 2:1. Ru/Sib.l catalyst is produced with Ru content of 0.5wt%.<br>
Example 3<br>
The catalyst is prepared by co-deposition of Ru and Pd using water solutions of RuOHCb and H2PdCl4 correspondingly as metal precursors. For this purpose, 50g of carbon support Sibunit 1 are loaded to the cylindric rotating reactor. 13ml of Na2CO2 water solution (0.371mole/l) and 13ml of H2PdCl4(0.109mole/l) + RuOHCb (0.076mole/l) are fed to the injector at the same flow rate (2.5ml/min) at the mole ratio Na2CO3 : (Ru+Pd) = 2:1, and sprayed into the reactor. The catalyst is discharged and dried under vacuum at 70°C till the constant weight. Further stages of reduction, washing and drying are similar to those of the example 1. (Ru-Pd)/Sib.l catalyst is produced with 0.2wt% Ru and 0.3wt%Pd content.<br>

The sample is placed into the tubular reactor and dried in an air stream for 1hr while the temperature is increased to 120°C and held at this temperature for 2hr. Then the air is substituted by nitrogen and the temperature is increased to 250°C (at this temperature Pd(NO3)2 is decomposed to Pd oxide). At these conditions the sample is held for 3hr, then cooled to 150°C. Then at this temperature the nitrogen is substituted with hydrogen and the catalyst is reduced for lhr at 150°C with further increase of temperature to 250°C and held at this temperature for 2hr. The temperature is reduced from 250°C to 40°C. since at 110°C the hydrogen is substituted with nitrogen. Pd/Sib.l catalyst is produced with a palladium content<br>
6<br><br>
of 0.5wt%. Thus the prepared catalyst is used in examples 24, 25 in the synthesis of bimetallic catalysts.<br>

Example 36<br>
150ml distilled water and 12.9g crude terephthalic acid, containing 8-000ppm p-CBA.<br>
10<br><br>
and 126pprn p-to!uic acid are loaded to the reactor (4561 Mini Parr Reactor) made of stainless steel. The anchor of the reactor has the form of a net basket intended for loading catalyst granules thereto. The granules of the catalyst, prepared in accordance with example I. in the amount of 0.170a. are loaded to the basket bottom. The basket is fixed to the stirrer shaft. After that the cover is put on the vessel and carefully screwed-up. The reactor is connected with the system. The system is purged with nitrogen, then with hydrogen, and the pressure is set at 14atm using hydrogen. The temperature of 250°C is set on the control pannel and the furnace is turned on. When the temperature in the reactor reaches the prescribed temperature, the stirrer equipped with magnetic gear (~240rpm) is turned on. The time the stirrer is turned on is considered the beginning of the experiment. Experiment time is 3hr. The reactor is opened, the basket with the catalyst is removed from the stirrer shaft and the catalyst is discharged. The content of the autoclave (suspension of terephthalic acid in water) is transferred to the glass filter, filtered, washed with distilled water (50ml) and dried under vacuum at 75°C for 2hr. The produced terephthalic acid powder,is analyzed for impurities content.<br>
Content of p-CBA in purified terephthalic acid is determined using universal polarograph ON-105 by voltammetering method in differential mode of polarization on Hg-graphite electrode by the analytical signal with the maximum at the potential of -1.07V proportional to the concentration of p-CBA in terephthalic acid.<br>
Concentration of p-toluic acid in purified terephthalic acid is determined by high pressure LC method on liquid chromatograph Milichrom-4. The sample of terephthalic-acid is dissolved in 0.3M NH4H2PO4 and analyzed on 2xS0mm column,with fixed phase - anion exchange resin Partisil, 10 SAX (Watman).<br>
Color (transparency) of the purified terephthalic acid is determined by direct measuring of optical density of water-alkaline solutions at 340 and 400nm. For this purpose, 1.5g of purified terephthalic acid are dissolved in 10ml of 2M KOH solution. The solution is preliminary centrifuged during 15min at 3000rpm. Optical density is measured on spectrophotometer (we used Specord M40) in quartz cells of 10mm thickness reffering to 2M KOH solution at 340 and 400nm.<br>
Analysis data on the quality of terephthalic acid, purified by this method over the catalyst, prepared in accordance with'the below given examples, are given in table 3.<br>
Example 2<br>
The method for the purification of terephthalic acid is similar to that descirbed in example 3. except 0.340g catalyst are loaded to the reactor. Besides the catalyst after the experiment (cycle) is washed directly in the basket with distilled water and used in the next cycle. The experiment time for one sample is from 4 to 5 cycles.<br>
Similar data on the quality of terephthalic acid, purified by this method over the<br><br>
11<br><br>
catalysts prepared in accordance with the above given examples, are given in table -4 Example 3<br>
The method for the purification of terephthalic acid is similar to that of example except the purification is conducted over the catalysts produced in examples 5 and 34, at the initial content of p-CBA of 30,000ppm,<br>
Analysis data on the quality of terephthalic acid purified by this method are given in<br>
table 5,<br>
Example 4<br>
500ml distilled water H2O and 25g crude terephthalic acid, containing 3,552ppm p-<br>
CBA and I26ppm p-colucid acid, are loaded to the stainless vessel of 750ml volume (dissolver). After that the cover is put on the vessel and carefully screwed-up. 2.0g catalyst, prepared in.the example 1 are placed on the reactor grid, in the form of the stainless tube with inner diameter of 10mm and discharge hole on the distance of 110mm from the tower grid. and the cover fixed with the second grid. The reactor is connected with the dissolver, Reactor's discharge hole is hermetically connected with the crystailizer via rhermostafed still capillary. The said crystallizer is an autoclave made of stainless still of 750ml volume. The dissolver, reactor and crystallizer are placed in the heated thermostat. The system is purged with nitrogen, then with hydrogen at H2 bubbling throught the water suspension of terephthalic acid in dissolver. and the pressure is set at lOatm with hydrogen. The temperature of 250°C is set on the control pannef and the thermostat is turned on. When the temperature in the system reaches the prescribed temperature the hydrogen is fed to the dissolver at the constant mote rate using flow mater. Constant pressure in the system is maintained by a pressure regulator situated at the crystallizer outlet The gas substitutes ihe solution of terephthalic acid from dissolver to reactor. The solution of terephthalic acid is pumped over upward through the catalyst level at i constant rate and discharged via a discharge hole to the crystallizer. "Pumping over" time of the solution throught the reactor is 8hr. The reaction mass is cooled and the installation is purged with nitrogen. The content of the crystallizer (suspension of terephthalic acid in water) is transferred to the glass filter, filtered, washed with distilled water (100ml) and dried under vacuum at 75OC for 2hr. The produced powder of terephthalic acid is analyzed for impurities content<br>
Analysis data on the quality of ferephthalic acid, purified by this method over the catalyst, which is prepared in accordance with the above given examples, are given in table 6.<br>
As may be seen from the examples and tables, the invention proposed allows purification of terephthalic acid till low content of p-CBA and allows to this method to ftnd wide application in the chemical industry.<br>

Heretofore problems were encountered in preparing selective and stable catalysts for purifying terephthalic acid with high content of p - CBA.<br>
The present invention attempts to overcome the foregoing problem and relates to a process for preparing a catalyst for purification of terephthalic acid consisting of crystallites of catalytically active palladium or palladium and at least one metal of Group VIII of the Periodical Table deposited on a carbon material wherein said metal crystallites are distributed through the bulk of granules of said carbon material so as within a layer being at a distance from the outer surface of said granule equal to 1 - 30% of the radius thereof, the said process comprising the steps of -<br>
i) contacting granules of carbon material with an aqueous solution of palladium salts or salts of palladium and at least one metal of Group VIII to produce a "metal salt-porous carbon" precursor.<br>
ii)       drying said precursor, and<br>
iii) treating said precursor with a reducing agent like hydrogen to reduce surface metal salts to crystallites of said metal, whereby a catalytically active palladium or palladium and at least one metal of Group VIII is deposited upon the surface of said granules to produce a metal or bimetal catalyst, wherein said carbon material is a mesoporous graphite-like material.<br></td>
