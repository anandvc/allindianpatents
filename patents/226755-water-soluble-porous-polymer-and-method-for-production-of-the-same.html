				<td>WATER%SOLUBLE POROUS POLYMER AND METHOD FOR PRODUCTION OF THE SAME<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
Technical Field<br>
This invention relates to a method for the production<br>
of a water-soluble porous polymer. More particularly, it<br>
relates to a method for producing a water-soluble porous<br>
polymer by polymerizing an aqueous polymer solution<br>
containing an ethylenically unsaturated monomer while causing<br>
the aqueous solution to contain bubbles therein and a<br>
water-soluble porous polymer having a void ratio in the range<br>
of 5 - 80% and a water-insoluble content of not more than<br>
10 wt.%.<br>
Background Art<br>
The water-soluble polymers have hitherto come in various<br>
kinds of products such as natural macromolecules like gelatin<br>
and polysaccharides and synthetic polymers like polyacrylic<br>
acid, poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) , polyacrylamide,<br>
and polyvinyl alcohol. They are extensively utilized as<br>
medical accessories including laceration dressing agents,<br>
contact lenses, artificial muscles, and artificial organs,<br>
breeding materials including planting materials and<br>
artificial planting soils, and tackifiers, waste water<br>
cleaning agents, dispersants, pigments, and organism<br>
immobilizing carriers. In consequence of the growth of the<br>
demand for water-soluble polymers, the desirability of<br>
developing a technique for attaining quantity production of<br>
a water-soluble polymer inexpensively has been finding<br>
popular approval.<br>
It has been known to obtain a polymer by irradiating<br><br>
an acrylic monomer with a light energy. As a means to produce<br>
an acrylic polymer gel continuously, a method for continuously<br>
producing a polymer gel by adjusting a monomer solution<br>
containing an acrylic type monomer and a photopolymerization<br>
initiator to an oxygen concentration of not more than 1 mg/1,<br>
then delivering the monomer solution in the shape of a thin<br>
layer, and irradiating the thin film with a light energy thereby<br>
polymerizing the monomer solution has been known<br>
(JP-A-1989-138210) . To produce the polymer of fine quality<br>
stably, this method is required to control the layer of the<br>
gel during the stage of polymerization to a fixed thickness.<br>
When the gel has a high acrylic acid concentration, it is<br>
causedby the heat of polymerization during the polymerization<br>
to assume a bumping state consequently suffer loss of the<br>
uniformly concentration of itself and induce dispersion of<br>
the degree of polymerization and the bumping possibly scatters<br>
the monomer. In consideration of this disadvantage, the<br>
practice of preparing the aqueous solution having a monomer<br>
content in the range of 20 - 80 wt.% and, with a further view<br>
to precluding occurrence of an unpolymerized moiety,<br>
imparting to the aqueous solution an oxygen concentration<br>
of not more than 1 mg/1 and delivering the aqueous solution<br>
in a layer thickness in the range of 3 - 20 mm has been prevailing.<br>
The polymer gel at the age of 180 minutes after the start<br>
of the delivery of the solution of the monomer mixture has<br>
a solids content of 40.8%. The ribbon of the polymer gel<br>
consequently obtained is disintegrated into the shape of chips<br>
or grains, pulverized with a pulverizer into particles about<br>
3 mm in diameter, and then dried at 80 oC for about one hour.<br>
As ameans to produce a lowmolecular weight water-soluble<br>
polymer, a method which produces a low molecular weight<br>
water-soluble polymer by photopolymerizing a vinyl type<br><br>
monomer in an aqueous solution thereof in the presence of<br>
a hydrogen sulfite ion and a photopolymerization initiator<br>
has been known (JP-A-2002-69104). In contrast with the<br>
conventional method which obtains a water-soluble polymer<br>
of a high molecular weight useful as macromolecular<br>
flocculating agents by delivering an aqueous monomer solution<br>
of a high concentration in the shape of a thin layer and<br>
irradiating the thin layer with an ultraviolet light emitted<br>
from above, the present method has been developed for the<br>
purpose of producing a water-soluble polymer having a sharp<br>
molecular weight distribution and it produces a water-soluble<br>
polymer having a weight average molecular weight in the range<br>
of 2,000 - 10,000 by adding 5 - 85 wt.% of an aqueous vinyl<br>
type monomer solution, a hydrogen sulfite ion as a chain<br>
transfer agent, and a photopolymerization initiator together,<br>
and polymerizing the resultant reaction solution while<br>
stirring it. In the working examples, the solids contents<br>
indicated were in the range of 36 - 44 wt.%.<br>
For the purpose of producing a partially neutralized<br>
(meth)acrylic acid type polymer manifesting a specific<br>
intrinsic viscosity at 30°C and a specific insoluble content<br>
in deionized water, a method for the production of a partially<br>
neutralized (meth)acrylic acid type polymer, characterized<br>
by polymerizing a monomer component containing as main<br>
components an acid type monomer and a (meth) acrylate treated<br>
with activated carbon has been disclosed (JP-A-2000-212222) .<br>
This invention, in view of the fact that the conventional<br>
product has no satisfactory degree of polymerization and is<br>
incapable of forming a medium possessing hardness and<br>
viscosity, is aimed at producing a partially neutralized<br>
(meth)acrylic type polymer having a high degree of<br>
polymerization.<br><br>
Since a water-soluble monomer is used for the production<br>
of a water-soluble polymer, the reaction solution is<br>
automatically an aqueous solution. After the production of<br>
the water-soluble polymer, therefore, it is necessary that<br>
the water used for the reaction solution be separated from<br>
the polymer and that the reaction product be dried. Further,<br>
it occurs at times that the water-soluble polymer thus produced<br>
is disintegrated and pulverized to suit the purpose of use<br>
and the efficiency of disintegrating or pulverization is<br>
varied as well by the water content of the polymer.<br>
Particularly in the continuous production of the<br>
water-soluble polymer, the drying step calls for a long time<br>
when the continuous operation is carried out in concert with<br>
the speed of the polymerization. For the sake of expediting<br>
the drying treatment, the treatment is required to be effected<br>
at an elevated temperature, with the result that the thermal<br>
energy will be unduly increased and the cost of production<br>
will be consequently boosted. Particularly when the<br>
water-soluble polymer forms the target for the drying<br>
treatment, it is not easily dried on account of its quality.<br>
The simplification of such a drying step of the water-soluble<br>
polymer, therefore, constitutes an important element<br>
responsible for enhancing the efficiency of production and<br>
lowering the cost of production.<br>
In the light of the true state of affairs, this invention<br>
is aimed at providing a method for producing a water-soluble<br>
polymer by a simple procedure at a low cost.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The present inventor has found that the polymerization<br>
of an aqueous monomer solution containing an ethylenically<br>
unsaturatedmonomer, when effected while positively supplying<br><br>
bubbles into the reaction solution, is enabled to produce<br>
a water-soluble porous polymer, that the polymer acquires<br>
an enlarged surface area and therefore facilitates<br>
dissipation of the water and the heat of polymerization<br>
entrapped therein, curtails the time required for drying,<br>
enhances the efficiency of pulverization at the subsequent<br>
step of pulverization, and lowers the cost of production,<br>
that the water-soluble porous polymer, even when sliced and<br>
pulverized, is capable of manifesting the same degree of<br>
viscosity as a non-porous polymer, and that the water-soluble<br>
porous polymer has a smaller residual monomer content than<br>
the unfoamed polymer, permits the reaction of polymerization<br>
to proceed more uniformly, and allows further polymerization.<br>
This invention has been perfected as a result.<br>
By this invention, the water-soluble porous polymer can<br>
be produced easily and conveniently.<br>
This invention is particularly characterized by causing<br>
the aqueous monomer solution containing an ethylenically<br>
unsaturated monomer to be polymerized while, containing<br>
bubbles therein. When the porous polymer after completion<br>
of the polymerization acquires a volume 1.1 - 20 times the<br>
volume of the aqueous monomer solution prior to the<br>
polymerization, the produced water-soluble porous polymer<br>
has a small residual monomer content and a large molecular<br>
weight.<br>
The water-soluble porous polymer of this invention<br>
really abounds in water solubility as evinced by such a small<br>
water-insoluble content as not more than 10 wt.% and, owing<br>
to its fabrication in a porous texture, excels in an aqueous<br>
solution-forming property.<br>
Best Mode for Embodying the Invention<br><br>
The first aspect of this invention is directed toward<br>
a method for the production of a water-soluble porous polymer<br>
comprising a step of polymerization of an aqueous monomer<br>
solution while having bubbles contained in the monomer<br>
solution, thereby obtaining the porous polymer having a<br>
water-insoluble content of not more than 10 wt. %. A technique<br>
for producing a porous polymer with the object of enhancing<br>
an absorbent property already exists. It was obtained by<br>
polymerizing a monomer component containing an inner<br>
cross-linking agent, which polymer was a hydrophilic but not<br>
dissolved in water. Since the water-soluble polymer requires<br>
a long time for polymerization of an aqueous monomer solution,<br>
it is difficult to remain bubbles through the polymerization.<br>
Thus, absolutely no development has been made of a<br>
water-soluble porous polymer. This invention, however, has<br>
succeeded in developing a water-soluble porous polymer by<br>
curtailing the polymerization time of the aqueous monomer<br>
solution by including a photopolymerization initiator in the<br>
solution and the exposure of the solution to an ultraviolet<br>
light or a near ultraviolet light, or by enabling the foaming<br>
to continue for a long time owing to the adjustment of the<br>
viscosity of the aqueous monomer solution. Now, this<br>
invention will be described in detail below.<br>
(1) Preparation of aqueous monomer solution<br>
The water-soluble porous polymer of this invention can<br>
be produced by polymerizing a relevant monomer in a medium.<br>
The monomers include ethylenically unsaturated monomers,<br>
carbonyl compounds, alcohols, and carboxylic acids, for<br>
example.<br>
As concrete examples of the ethylenically unsaturated<br>
monomer, anionic monomers such as (meth) acrylic acid, maleic<br>
acid, maleic anhydride, fumaric acid, crotonic acid, itaconic<br><br>
acid, 2-(meth)acryloyl ethane sulfonic acid,<br>
2-(meth)acryloyl propane sulfonic acid,<br>
2-(meth)acrylamide-2-methyl propane sulfonic acid, vinyl<br>
sulfonic acid, and styrene sulfonic acid and lithium, sodium,<br>
potassium, and other alkali metal salts thereof and ammonium<br>
salts thereof; nonionic hydrophilic group-containing<br>
monomers such as (meth)acrylamide, N-substituted<br>
(meth)acrylamide, 2-hydroxyethyl (meth)acrylate,<br>
2-hydroxypropyl (meth)acrylate, methoxypolyethylene glycol<br>
(meth)acrylate, polyethylene glycol (meth)acrylate, and<br>
N-vinyl acetamide; and amino group-containing unsaturated<br>
monomers such as N,N-dimethylaminoethyl (meth)acrylate,<br>
N,N-dimethylaminopropyl(meth)acrylate,	and<br>
N,N-methylaminopropyl(meth)acrylamide and the products of<br>
quaternization thereof may be cited. Incidentally, N-vinyl<br>
pyrrolidone may be used specifically for copolymerization.<br>
It is permissible to use additionally such acrylic esters<br>
as methyl (meth)acrylate, ethyl (meth)acrylate, and butyl<br>
(meth) acrylate and hydrophobic monomers such as vinyl acetate<br>
and vinyl propionate in an amount incapable of impairing the<br>
water-soluility of the produced polymer.<br>
As concrete examples of the carbonyl compound, aldehydes<br>
and ketones, cyclic ethers and lactones may be cited. As<br>
concrete examples of the alcohols, aliphatic alcohols,<br>
aromatic alcohols, and diols may be cited. As concrete<br>
examples of the carboxylic acids, aliphatic carboxylic acids,<br>
aromatic carboxylic acids, amines, and thiols may be cited.<br>
These monomers may be used either singly or in the form of<br>
a combination of two or more members.<br>
In this invention, it is preferable to use ethylenically<br>
unsaturated monomers among them. It is particularly<br>
preferable to use at least one member selected from the group<br><br>
consisting of (meth)acrylic acid and salts thereof,<br>
2-(meth)acryloyl ethane sulfonic acid and salts thereof,<br>
2- (meth) acrylamide-2-methyl propane sulfonic acid and salts<br>
thereof, (meth)acrylamide, methoxypolyethylene glycol<br>
(meth)acrylate, N,N-dimethylaminoethyl (meth)acrylate and<br>
the products of quaternization thereof. It is still more<br>
preferable to use a monomer component which contains<br>
(meth) acrylic acid or a salt thereof as an essential component.<br>
When the monomer component forms a "salt" such as an acrylate,<br>
it is permissible to prepare an aqueous solution containing<br>
an acid type acrylic acid as a monomer component and<br>
subsequently transform the monomer component by addition of<br>
an alkali into a neutral salt. Otherwise, it is permissible<br>
to use a neutral salt type acrylic acid as a monomer component.<br>
As concrete examples of the "salt, " the salts of alkali metals<br>
and alkaline earth metals may be cited.<br>
The viscosity of the aqueous monomer solution does not<br>
need to be particularly restricted. The adjustment of this<br>
viscosity in the range of 0.001 to 1.2 Pa.s, preferably 0.001<br>
to 1.0 Pa.S, and still more preferably 0.001 to 0.6 Pa.s,<br>
however, enables the bubbles to be stably dispersed in the<br>
aqueous monomer solution. If the viscosity exceeds 1.2 Pa. s,<br>
the excess will possibly render difficult uniform dispersion<br>
in the aqueous monomer solution of a foaming agent which is<br>
usable in this invention. Further, the aqueous monomer<br>
solution may be not easy to transfer with a pump by the excess<br>
viscosity.<br>
The concentration of the aqueous monomer solution is<br>
not particularly restricted. When it is adjusted to a level<br>
of not less than 40 wt.%, it can be simplify the drying and<br>
pulverization steps of the obtained polymer. It is preferably<br>
not less than 50 wt.%, still more preferably not less than<br><br>
60 wt.%, and the most preferably not less than 70 wt.%. If<br>
the concentration of the aqueous monomer solution is lower<br>
than 40 wt.%, the shortage will be at a disadvantage in<br>
increasing the water content of the solution, requiring the<br>
drying to be carried out at a higher temperature for a longer<br>
time, necessitating an increase in the size of the device,<br>
and impairing the efficiency of production. The increase of<br>
the concentration of the aqueous monomer solution brings a<br>
proportionate decrease in the water content of the produced<br>
polymer and consequently enhances the efficiency of the<br>
treatments of drying and pulverization proportionately. It<br>
occurs at times that the higher concentration possibly allows<br>
omission of the step of drying. When the aqueous monomer<br>
solution is polymerized at a high concentration, the product<br>
of the polymerization can be immediately pulverized and<br>
obtained the powder aimed at easily. The increase of the<br>
concentration of the aqueous monomer solution results in<br>
heightening the viscosity of itself and consequently adding<br>
to the power of holding bubbles and ensuring production of<br>
a water-soluble porous polymer of high quality.<br>
For the sake of heightening the viscosity of the aqueous<br>
monomer solution, the solution may incorporate a thickening<br>
agent therein. The thickening agent is required to be a<br>
water-soluble polymer. For example, oligoacrylic acid<br>
(salt) , polyacrylicacid (salt) , polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl<br>
pyrrolidone, polyacrylamide, polyethylene oxide,<br>
hydroxyethyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, and hydroxy<br>
propyl cellulose are usable. These water-soluble polymers<br>
usable as a thickening agent have a weight average molecular<br>
weight in the range of 1,000- 10,000,000 and preferably 10, 000<br>
- 5,000,000. If the average molecular weight falls short of<br>
1,000, the shortage will be at a disadvantage in increasing<br><br>
the amount of the thickening agent to be added and possibly<br>
degrading the water solubility. The amount of the thickening<br>
agent to be added does not need to be particularly restricted<br>
but is only required to allow the viscosity of the aqueous<br>
monomer solution to reach a level of not more than 1.2 Pa.s.<br>
Generally, this amount is in the range of 0.01 - 3 wt.%,<br>
preferably 0.1 - 1 wt.% based on the weight of the monomer.<br>
If the amount of the thickening agent to be added falls short<br>
of 0.01 wt.%, the shortage will possibly prevent the effect<br>
of enhancing the viscosity from being satisfactorily<br>
manifested.<br>
For the sake of adjusting the viscosity in the range<br>
specified above, when the monomer component is an<br>
ethylenically unsaturated monomer, for example, the amount<br>
of the neutral salt type monomer to be incorporated may be<br>
controlled in the range of 5 - 100 mol%, preferably 10 - 100<br>
mol%. The ethylenically unsaturated monomer may possibly<br>
have the viscosity thereof in the aqueous solution vary between<br>
the acid type and the neutralized salt type of itself.<br>
Generally, the neutralized salt type has a higher viscosity.<br>
Thus, the viscosity can be controlled by adjusting the amount<br>
of the neutralized salt type to be incorporated. Since it<br>
is made possible to adjust the viscosity and allow the bubbles<br>
to be retained advantageously during the course of the<br>
polymerization by controlling the amount of the neutralized<br>
salt type monomer, the obtained polymer may be reverted to<br>
the acid type by treatment with an acid or adjusted to the<br>
wholly neutralized salt type by treatment with an alkali.<br>
Furthermore, by adjusting the amount of the alkali to be used<br>
in the treatment, it is made possible to obtain a water-soluble<br>
porous polymer containing a neutralized salt as expected.<br>
This procedure is at an advantage in allowing the viscosity<br><br>
to be adjusted without requiring incorporation of such<br>
additives as a thickening agent, for example.<br>
The production of a hydrophilic polymer possessing a<br>
cross-linked structure has been attained hitherto by<br>
positively supplying the scene of polymerization with bubbles.<br>
In the case of the water-soluble polymer having a small<br>
water-insoluble content contemplated by this invention, the<br>
production of a water-soluble porous polymer by the procedure<br>
of positively supplying bubbles has not been realized. It<br>
seems that in the case of a hydrophilic polymer possessing<br>
a cross-linked structure, the reaction solution has a very<br>
high viscosity and is enabled to retain bubbles easily therein.<br>
The water-soluble polymer of this invention having a small<br>
water-insoluble content is a hydrophilic polymer possessing<br>
no cross-linked structure. Owing to the absence of the<br>
cross-linked structure, the reaction solution has a low<br>
viscosity and is not enabled to retain bubbles till completion<br>
of the polymerization. Now, this invention has realized the<br>
synthesis of a water-soluble porous polymer by exalting the<br>
power of the reaction solution to retain bubbles therein by<br>
adjusting the viscosity of the reaction solution in accordance<br>
with the method described above and adopting as well a varying<br>
foaming means described herein below.<br>
When the aqueous monomer solution mentioned above is<br>
polymerized, it is preferable to have a radical polymerization<br>
initiator dissolved or dispersed in advance in the aqueous<br>
polymer solution. Such radical polymerization initiators<br>
include azo compounds such as azonitrile compounds,<br>
azoamidine compounds, cyclic azoamidine compounds, azoamide<br>
compounds,	alkyl azo compounds,<br>
2,2'-azobis (2-amidinopropane) dihydrochlori.de, and<br>
2,2'-azobis[2-(2-imidazolin-2-yl)propane]<br><br>
dihydrochloride) ; persulfates such as ammonium persulfate,<br>
potassium persulfate, and sodium persulfate; peroxides such<br>
as hydrogen peroxide, methylethyl ketone peroxide, benzoyl<br>
peroxide, cumene hydroperoxide, and di-t-butyl peroxide; and<br>
redox initiators formed by combining the peroxides mentioned<br>
above with such reducing agents as sulphites, bisulfites,<br>
thiosulfates, formamidine sulfinic acid, and ascorbic acid,<br>
for example. These radical polymerization initiators may be<br>
used either singly or in the form of a combination of two<br>
or more members. The radical polymerization initiator usable<br>
advantageously in this invention is incorporated in an amount<br>
falling preferably in the range of 0.0001 - 10 wt. parts,<br>
more preferably 0.0005 - 5 wt. parts, and particularly<br>
preferably 0.001 - 1 wt. part, based on 100 wt. parts of the<br>
ethylenically unsaturated monomer.<br>
Further, this invention allows use of such<br>
photopolymerization initiators as benzoin derivatives,<br>
benzyl derivatives, acetophenone derivatives, benzophenone<br>
derivatives, and azo compounds for the purpose of initiating<br>
polymerization as a polymerization initiator. Use of a<br>
photopolymerization initiator and ultraviolet light and/or<br>
near ultraviolet light proves a preferable method.<br>
As concrete examples of the photopolymerization<br>
initiator usable herein, azo type photopolymerization<br>
initiators such as 2, 2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane),<br>
2,2'-azobis(N,N'-dimethylene	isobutylamidine),<br>
2,2'-azobis[2-(5-methyl-2-imidazolin-2-yl)propane],<br>
1,1'-azobis(1-amidino-l-cyclopropylethane),<br>
2,2'-azobis(2-amidino-4-methylpentane),<br>
2,2'-azobis(2-N-phenyl-aminoamidinopropane),<br>
2,2'-azobis(l-imino-l-ethylamino-2-methylpropane),<br>
2,2'-azobis(l-allylamino-l-imino-2-methylbutane),<br><br>
2,2'-azobis(2-N-cyclohexylamidinopropane),<br>
2,2'-azobis(2-N-benzylaminopropane), hydrochlorides,<br>
sulfates, and acetates thereof, 4,4'-azobis(4-cyanovaleric<br>
acid) and alkali metal salt, ammonium salt, and amine salt<br>
thereof, 2-(carbamoylazo) isobutylonitrile,<br>

thereof, benzophenone and derivatives thereof, and benzyl<br>
and derivatives thereof may be cited. These<br>
photopolymerization initiators may be used either singly or<br>
in the form of a combination of two or more members.<br>
Among other photopolymerization initiators enumerated<br>
above, the benzoin type photopolymerization initiators such<br>
as, for example, 2-hydroxy-2-methyl-l-phenyl-propan-l-on<br>
and bis(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)-phenylphosphinoxide are<br>
used particularly advantageously.<br>
The amount of the photopolymerization initiator to be<br>
used is preferably in the range of 0.0001 - 10 wt. parts,<br>
more preferably 0.0005 - 5 wt. parts, and particularly<br>
preferably 0.001 - 1 wt. part, based on 100 wt. parts of the<br>
monomer. If the amount of the initiator falls short of 0. 0001<br>
wt. part, the shortage will result in greatly lowering the<br>
polymerization velocity. Conversely, if this amount exceeds<br>
10 wt. parts, the overage will possibly result in emitting<br>
an unduly large heat and increasing the water-insoluble<br>
content.<br>
This invention permits addition of a chain transfer agent<br>
to the reaction system. The chain transfer agents which are<br>
usable herein include sulfur-containing compounds,<br>
phosphorous acid type compounds, hypophosphorous acid type<br>
compounds, and alcohols, for example. By adding such a chain<br>
transfer agent, it is made possible to adjust the cross-linking<br>
reaction, keeping the water-insoluble content to less than<br>
10 wt.%, and repressing the occurrence of a short-chain<br>
polymer.<br>
As concrete examples of the sulfur-containing compound,<br>
hypophosphorous acids (salts) such as sodium hydrogen sulfite,<br>
potassium hydrogen sulfite, and ammonium hydrogen sulfite,<br>
thiols such as mercapto ethanol, thioglycerol, thioglycolic<br><br>
acid, thioaceticacid, mercaptoethanol, 2-mercapto propionic<br>
acid, 3-mercapto propionic acid, thiomalic acid, octyl<br>
thioglycolate, octyl 3-mercapto propionate, and 2-mercapto<br>
ethane sulfonic acid, and thiolic acids may be cited. As<br>
concrete examples of the phosphorous acid type compound,<br>
phosporous acid and sodium phosphite may be cited. As concrete<br>
examples of the hypophosphorous acid type compound,<br>
hypophosphorous acid and sodium hypophosphite may be cited.<br>
As concrete examples of the alcohol, methyl alcohol, ethyl<br>
alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, and n-butyl alcohol may be cited.<br>
These compounds may be used either singly or in the form of<br>
a combination of two or more members. Among other compounds<br>
enumerated above, hydophosphorous acid type compounds prove<br>
advantageous and sodium hypophosphite proves more<br>
advantageous.<br>
The amount of the chain transfer agent to be incorporated<br>
may be properly set so as to suit the polymerization velocity<br>
and the combination of this agent with a photopolymerization<br>
initiator. It is preferably in the range of 0.0001 - 10 wt.<br>
parts and more preferably 0.005 - 5 wt. parts, based on 100<br>
wt. parts of the monomer.<br>
As regards the relation between the polymerization<br>
initiator and the chain transfer agent, the ratio of their<br>
combination (polymerization initiator/chain transfer agent) ,<br>
in terms of the weight per 1 mol of the monomer, is not more<br>
than 10, preferably not more than 5, and the most preferably<br>
not more than 3. If this ratio of combination exceeds 10,<br>
the overage will be at a disadvantage in suffering the<br>
water-insoluble content of the resultant porous product and<br>
the powder to exceed 10 wt.%.<br>
Further, the aqueous monomer solution may incorporate<br>
therein a surfactant with the object of facilitating the<br><br>
generation and retention of bubbles in the solution. The<br>
surfactants which are usable herein include anionic<br>
surfactants, nonionic surfactants, cationic surfactants,<br>
amphoteric surfactants, fluorine type surfactants, and<br>
organic metal surfactants, for example.<br>
As concrete examples of the anionic surfactant,<br>
aliphatic acid salts such as mixed fatty acid sodium soap,<br>
semi-hard tallow fatty acid sodium soap, sodium stearate soap,<br>
potassium oleate soap, and castor oil potassium soap; alkyl<br>
sulfuric ester salts such as sodium lauryl sulfcite, higher<br>
alcohol sodium sulfate, lauryl sodium sulfate, and lauryl<br>
sulfuric acid triethanol amine; alkylbenzene sulfonates such<br>
as sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate; alkyl naphthalene<br>
sulfonates such as sodium alkylnaphthalene sulfonate; alkyl<br>
sulfosuccinates such as sodium dialkyl sulfosuccinate; alkyl<br>
diphenyl ether disulfonates such as sodium alkyldiphenyl<br>
ether disulf onate; alkyl phosphorates such as potassium alkyl<br>
phosphate; polyoxyethylene alkyl (or alkylallyl) sulfuric<br>
acid ester salts such as polyoxyethylene lauryl ether sodium<br>
sulfate, polyoxyethylene alkyl ether sodium sulfate,<br>
polyoxyethylene alkyl ether sulfuric acid triethanol amine,<br>
and polyoxyethylene alkylphenyl ether sodiumsulf ate; special<br>
reaction type anionic surfactants; special caraboxylic acid<br>
type surfctants; naphthalene sulfonic acid formalin<br>
condensates such as sodium salts of β-naphthalene sulfonic<br>
acid formalin condensate and sodium salts of special aromatic<br>
sulfonic acid formalin condensate; special polycarbonic acid<br>
type macomolecular surfactants; and polyoxyethylene<br>
alkylphospholic acid esters may be cited.<br>
As concrete examples of the nonionic surfactant, sucrose<br>
fatty acid esters; polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers such as<br>
polyoxyethylene lauryl ether, polyoxyethylene cetyl ether,<br><br>
polyoxyethylene stearyl ether, polyoxyethylene oleyl ether<br>
and, polyoxyethylene higher alcohol ethers, polyoxyethylene<br>
alkylaryl ethers such as polyoxyethylene nonylphenyl ether;<br>
polyoxyethylene derivatives; sorbitan fatty acid esters<br>
such as sorbitan monolaurate, sorbitan monopaImitate,<br>
sorbitan monostearate, sorbitan tristearate, sorbitan<br>
monooleate, sorbitan trioleate, sorbitan sesquioleate, and<br>
sorbitan distearate; polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid<br>
esters such as polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate,<br>
polyoxyethylene sorbitan monopalminate, polyoxyethylene<br>
sorbitan monostearate, polyoxyethylene sorbitan tristearate,<br>
polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate, and polyoxyethylene<br>
sorbitan trioleate; polyoxyethylene sorbitol fatty acid<br>
esters such as tetraoleic acid polyoxyethylene sorbit;<br>
glycerin fatty acid esters such as glycerol monostearate,<br>
glycerol monooleate, and self-emulsifying glycerol<br>
monostearate; polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters such as<br>
polyethylene glycol monolaurate, polyethylene glycol<br>
monostearate, polyethylene glycol distearate, and<br>
polyethylene glycol monooleate; polyoxyethylene alkyl amine;<br>
polyoxyethylene hardened castor oil; and alkyl alkanol amides<br>
may be cited.<br>
As concrete examples of the cationic surfactant and the<br>
amphoteric surfactant, alkyl amine salts such as coconut amine<br>
acetate and stearyl amine acetate; quaternary ammonium salts<br>
such as lauryl trimethyl ammonium chloride, stearyl trimethyl<br>
ammmonium chloride, cetyl trimethyl ammonium chloride,<br>
distearyl dimethyl ammonium chloride, and alkylbenzyl<br>
dimethyl ammonium chloride; alkyl betaines such as lauryl<br>
betaine, stearyl betaine, and lauryl carboxymethyl<br>
hydroxyethyl imidazolinium betaine; and amine oxides such<br>
as lauryl dimethyl amine oxide may be cited. By using a<br><br>
cationic surfactant, it may be made possible to impart an<br>
antifungal property to the water-soluble polymer to be<br>
produced.<br>
The surfactants usable herein further include fluorine<br>
type surfactants. By using a fluorine type surfactant, it<br>
is made possible to have bubbles of an inert gas retained<br>
as stably dispersed in the aqueous monomer solution for a<br>
long time. The amount and the diameter of such bubbles are<br>
also controlled easily. The water-soluble polymer is<br>
consequently obtained in the form of a porous foamed mass.<br>
It can be endowed with an antibacterial property. The fluorine<br>
type surfactants which are usable in this invention are known<br>
in various kinds. They result from transforming the<br>
lipophilic group of an ordinary surfactant into a<br>
perf luoroalkyl group by the substitution of the hydrogen atom<br>
in the oleophilic group with a fluorine atom. They acquire<br>
a decisively intensified surface activity owing to the<br>
transformation.<br>
The hydrophilic group of the fluorine type surfactant<br>
can be varied into four kinds, i.e. anionic type, nonionic<br>
type, cationic type, and amphoteric type. The hydrophobic<br>
group thereof makes use of the fluorocarbon chain of the same<br>
configuration more often than not. The carbon chain which<br>
is the hydrophobic group may be used alike in the straight<br>
chain form or the branched form. Typical fluorine type<br>
surfactants are those which are enumerated below.<br>
Fluoroalkyl (C2 - C10) carboxylic acids,<br>
N-perfluorooctane sulfonyl glutamic acid disodium,<br>
3-[fluoroalkyl (C6 - C11) oxy]-l-alkyl (C3 - C4) sulfonic acid<br>

C8)-N-ethylamino]-1-propane sulfonic acid sodium,<br>
N-[3-(perflfuorooctane	sulfonamide)<br><br>
propyl]-N,N-dimethyl-N-carboxymethylene ammonium betaine,<br>
fluoroalkyl (C11- C20) carboxylic acid, perf luoroalkyl<br>

(Li, K, Na) , N-propyl-N-(2-hydroxyethyl)perfluorooctane<br>

trimethyl ammonium salt, perfluoroalkyl (C6-<br>
C10)-N-ethylsulfonyl glycin salt (K) , phosphoric acid<br>
bis(N-perfluorooctyl sulfonyl-N-ethylaminoethyl) ,<br>
monoperfluoroalkyl (C6 - C16) ethylphosphoric acid ester,<br>
perfluoroalkyl quaternary ammonium iodide (a cationic<br>
fluorine type surfactant made by Sumitomo 3M K.K. and sold<br>
under the trademark designation of "Florard FC-135"),<br>
perfluoroalkyl alkoxylate (a nonionic surfactant made by<br>
Sumitomo 3M K.K. and sold under the trademark designation<br>
of "Florard FC-171"), and perflfuoroalkylsulfonic acid<br>
potassium salt (an anionic surfactant made by Sumitomo 3M<br>
K.K. and sold under the trademark designation of "Florard<br>
FC-95 and FC-98").<br>
The organic metal surfactants are also usable herein.<br>
The term "organic metal surfactant" refers to a molecule having<br>
such metals as Si, Ti, Sn, Zr, and Ge in the main chain or<br>
the side chain thereof. Among other conceivable organicmetal<br>
surfactants, those which have Si in the main chain of the<br>
molecule prove particularly advantageous. Siloxane type<br>
surfactants prove more advantageous.<br>
As typical organicmetal surfactants, those represented<br>
by the following formulas (1) - (19) may be cited (Yoshida,<br>
Kondo, Ohgaki, and Yamanaka, "Surfactant Handbook, new<br>
edition,"Kogaku Tosho (1966), p. 34).<br><br><br><br><br>
As the metals to be contained in the organic metal<br>
surfactants represented by the foregoing formulas (1) - (19),<br>
Sn, Zr, Ge, etc. may be used in the place of Si or Ti.<br>
The surfactants mentioned above are incapable of<br>
emitting bubbles in themselves or enabling the aqueous monomer<br>
solution to contain bubbles. When they are added to the<br>
aqueous monomer solution, they enable the aqueous solution<br>
to retain the bubbles to be generated by a stirring and mixing<br>
operation or by the use of a foaming agent.<br>
Kinds of surfactants to be used may be selected based<br>
on factors of the aqueous monomer solution such as pH, for<br>
example, and their amounts to be incorporated are also decided<br>
in accordance with the due data offered above with respect<br>
to the foregoing surfactants. Incidentally, these<br>
surfactants may be utilized as an agent for regulating the<br>
foaming, depending on the condition of use.<br><br>
They may be used either singly or in the form of a<br>
combination of two or more members. This invention prefers<br>
use of sucrose fatty acid esters and sorbitan type surfactants,<br>
especially sorbitan monostearate, particularly among other<br>
surfactants enumerated above.<br>
These surfactants are used in an amount in the range<br>
of 0.001 - 100 wt. parts, preferably 0.005 - 80 wt. parts,<br>
and particularly preferably 0.01 - 30 wt. parts, based on<br>
100 wt. parts of the monomer to be used. If this amount falls<br>
short of 0.001 wt. part, the shortage will possibly render<br>
difficult the adjustment of the volume of the porous polymer<br>
after completion of polymerization to 1.1 - 20 times the volume<br>
of the aqueous monomer solution existing at the time of starting<br>
polymerization. Conversely, if the amount exceeds 100 wt.<br>
parts, the overage may possibly fail to bring a proportionate<br>
addition to the effect expected.<br>
The aqueous monomer solution to be used in this invention<br>
allows additional incorporation therein of the aqueous<br>
solution of starch, a derivative of starch, a water-soluble<br>
polymer of cellulose, poly(sodium acrylate), and<br>
poly(ethylene oxide).<br>
As the solvent to be used in the production of a<br>
water-soluble porous polymer, water proves a proper choice.<br>
It is nevertheless permissible to use an aqueous solution<br>
of such lower alcohol as methanol, ethanol, or propanol, an<br>
amide such as dimethyl formamide or dimethyl acetamide, or<br>
an ether such as diethyl ether, dioxane, or tetrahydrofuran.<br>
(2) Preparation of bubbles<br>
This invention is characterized by polymerizing the<br>
aqueous monomer solution mentioned above while keeping the<br>
presence of bubbles in the solution. As a means to induce<br>
bubbles therein during the course of polymerization, (I) a<br><br>
method which polymerizes a product obtained by stirring and<br>
mixing an inert gas with the aqueous monomer solution in advance,<br>
(II)	a method which comprises adding a foaming agent to the<br>
aqueous monomer solution and polymerizing the resultant<br>
mixture while foaming it by the heat of polymerization, and<br>
(III)	a method of boiling point polymerization are available.<br>
The method (I) of stirring and mixing the inert gas is<br>
known in such forms as (1-1) a method of extruding the aqueous<br>
monomer solution in the form of mousse and feeding it to the<br>
polymerization device, (1-2) a method of stirring and mixing<br>
the aqueous monomer solution in a mixing device adapted to<br>
allow incorporation of the inert gas into the solution under<br>
treatment therein, (1-3) a method of generating bubbles<br>
resembling soap bubbles by means of bubbling, and (1-4) a<br>
method of causing nitrogen gas or carbon dioxide to be dissolved<br>
in the aqueous monomer solution under pressure. As the inert<br>
gas to be incorporated in the aqueous monomer solution,<br>
nitrogen, carbon dioxide, argon, and helium are available.<br>
(1-1): For the sake of preparing the aqueous monomer<br>
solution in the form of mousse, the aqueous monomer solution<br>
is extruded in the form of mousse through a pump type nozzle,<br>
for example. When the aqueous monomer solution has a<br>
surfactant incorporated therein at this time, the surfactant<br>
is effective in retaining the bubbles during the course of<br>
polymerization. By selecting the kind of surfactant and<br>
properly controlling the amount thereof, it is made possible<br>
to regulate the pore diameter and the water-solubility of<br>
the produced water-soluble porous polymer.<br>
(1-2) : For the sake of stirring and mixing the aqueous<br>
monomer solution in a mixing device thereby inducing bubbles<br>
in the solution, a method which comprises preparing an aqueous<br>
monomer solution incorporating therein the surfactant and<br><br>
causing the aqueous solution to foam by the use of a static<br>
mixer is available. The static mixer has lateral elements<br>
alternately disposed inside a pipe. On admitting the streams<br>
of the aqueous monomer solution and the inert gas therein,<br>
this static mixer mixes them and gives rise to the aqueous<br>
monomer solution containing the gas.<br>
As a means to induce bubbles by stirring and mixing,<br>
a method which, as disclosed in JP-A-1998-251310, comprises<br>
mixing the aqueous monomer solution and the inert gas by<br>
advancing them in parallel flow and causing either of the<br>
two parallel streams to be projected via a nozzle into the<br>
other stream may be adopted. By mixing the aqueous monomer<br>
solution and the inert gas both in the form of fluid, it is<br>
made possible to have the inert gas to be dispersed uniformly<br>
and stably in the aqueous monomer solution. Then, by<br>
polymerizing the aqueous monomer solution in a state having<br>
the inert gas disposed in advance therein, it is made possible<br>
to facilitate the control of the pore diameter and produce<br>
a porous polymer abounding in water solubility. To be specific,<br>
a method which effects mixture of the streams of the aqueous<br>
monomer solution and the inert gas by causing either of the<br>
two streams to be injected via a nozzle into the other stream<br>
is available. The mixture is accomplished, for example, by<br>
causing the inert gas injected through one nozzle to flow<br>
parallelly to the stream of the aqueous monomer solution<br>
injected through another nozzle or by causing the aqueous<br>
monomer solution injected through one nozzle to flow<br>
parallelly to the stream of the inert gas injected through<br>
another nozzle. It is permissible to have the inert gas<br>
directly blown into the stream of the aqueous monomer solution.<br>
For the sake of stirring and mixing the two streams, they<br>
may be projected in a parallel flow or a counterflow or in<br><br>
a perpendicular flow. The mode of projecting them in a<br>
parallel flow is preferred over the other modes. The<br>
projection in the parallel flow allows the bubbles to be<br>
uniformly dispersed. The projection in the counter flow<br>
possibly results in causing the two streams to scatter, adhere<br>
to the inner wall of the mixing device, and yield per se to<br>
polymerization.<br>
As the device for stirring and mixing the two streams,<br>
an aspirator and an ejector may be used. Subsequently, by<br>
introducing the mixture of the aqueous monomer solution and<br>
the inert gas into a mixing zone which is furnished with a<br>
corrugation and/or a packing adapted to obstruct the flow<br>
of a fluid, it is made possible to effect uniform mixture<br>
of the two components in the mixture. As concrete examples<br>
of the corrugation or the packing serving to obstruct the<br>
flow of a fluid, mixing zones provided with projections, vanes,<br>
baffle plates, and packing materials maybe cited. Themixing<br>
device of this construction may be operated by following the<br>
procedure which is disclosed in JP-A-1998-251310.<br>
For the sake of enabling the porous polymer resulting<br>
from the polymerization to assume a volume 1.1 - 20 times<br>
the volume of the aqueous monomer solution prior to the<br>
polymerization, the amount of the gas to be mixed is adjusted.<br>
(1-3) : The expression "the method of generating bubbles<br>
resembling soap bubbles by means of bubbling" used herein<br>
refers to a method which comprise adding the aqueous monomer<br>
solution and the aforementioned surfactant together in<br>
advance and causing the foam generated by the introduction<br>
of an inert gas such as nitrogen gas, carbon dioxide, or argon<br>
gas to be introduced as occasion demands into the<br>
polymerization phase.<br>
(1-4) The expression "the method of dissolving nitrogen<br><br>
gas and carbon dioxide under pressure" refers to a method<br>
which comprises mixing the inert gas into the aqueous monomer<br>
solution in advance and then polymerizing the aqueous monomer<br>
solution while enabling the gas to be radiated by the heat<br>
of polymerization during the polymerization and enabling the<br>
aqueous monomer solution to contain the bubbles.<br>
The method comprises placing the aqueous monomer<br>
solution in a pressure vessel such as an autoclave, introducing<br>
an inert gas such as nitrogen gas or carbon dioxide therein,<br>
retaining the interior of the vessel under pressure of not<br>
more than 5 MPa, and causing the inert gas to be dissolved<br>
in the aqueous monomer solution thereby inducing bubbles<br>
therein. This method exalts the content of bubbles in the<br>
aqueous monomer solution because the amount of the inert gas<br>
to be dissolved into the aqueous monomer solution is larger<br>
under pressure than under normal pressure. This method brings<br>
an effect of enabling the aqueous monomer solution to be<br>
efficiently transferred into the polymerization phase by<br>
relieving the vessel of the pressure. If the pressure in the<br>
vessel exceeds 5MPa at this time, the overage will be at a<br>
disadvantage in endangering the operation.<br>
(II): The expression "the method of incorporating a<br>
foaming agent" refers to a method which comprises having the<br>
foaming agent mixed and dispersed or dissolved in advance<br>
in the aqueous monomer solution and enabling the foaming agent<br>
to generate bubbles by the heat of polymerization. As the<br>
foaming technique, the use of a chemical foaming agent or<br>
a physical forming agent has been known. Generally, the<br>
chemical foaming agent and the physical foaming agent are<br>
each divided broadly under an organic type and an inorganic<br>
type. The chemical foaming agent can be further divided<br>
broadly under a thermal decomposition type and a reaction<br><br>
type. The chemical foaming agents of the organic thermal<br>
decomposition type include azo compounds such as azodicarbon<br>
amide and AIBN, hydrazidocompounds, semicarbazidocompounds,<br>
hydrazo compounds, tetrazole compounds, triazine compounds,<br>
and ester compounds such as malonate, for example. The<br>
chemical foaming agents of the organic reaction type include<br>
isocyanate compounds, for example.<br>
Then, the chemical foaming agents of the inorganic<br>
thermal decomposition type include carbonates such as<br>
bicarbonates, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate,<br>
ammonium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, calcium carbonate,<br>
sodium hydrogen carbonate, potassium hydrogen carbonate,<br>
ammonium hydrogen carbonate, magnesium hydrogen carbonate,<br>
calcium hydrogen carbonate, zinc carbonate, and barium<br>
carbonate, nitrites, and hydrides, for example. The chemical<br>
foaming agents of the inorganic reaction type include<br>
combinations of bicarbonates and acids, combinations of<br>
hydrogen peroxide and yeast, and combinations of aluminum<br>
and acids or alkalis, for example. The physical foaming agents<br>
of the organic type include aliphatic hydrocarbons formed<br>
of such volatile liquids as butane and pentane, and halogenated<br>
hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane, trichloroethane, and<br>
trifluforoethane, for example. The physical foaming agents<br>
of the inorganic type include nitrogen gas and carbonic acid<br>
gas, for example.<br>
When the generation of bubbles is implemented by<br>
combining sodium carbonate or ammonium carbonate with an acid,<br>
the generation of bubbles occurs copiously immediately after<br>
mixture and it ceases to continue with the advance of the<br>
neutralization reaction. When the combination mentioned<br>
above is adopted, the polymerization is preferably initiated<br>
as soon as possible after the mixture of the chemical foaming<br><br>
agent of the inorganic type and the acid, specifically within<br>
two hours, preferably within one hour after the mixture.<br>
It is also permissible to use foaming particulates which<br>
are formed of a core part of a low boiling organic solvent<br>
and a shell part of a nitrile type copolymer such as, for<br>
example, nitrile type thermally expandingmicrocapsules (sold<br>
under the product name of "Matsumoto Microsphere F-36") and<br>
nitrile type thermally expanding microcapsules (sold under<br>
the product name of "Matsumoto Microsphere F-20").<br>
In this invention, these foaming agents maybe used either<br>
singly or in the form of a combination of two or more members.<br>
The foaming agents which are advantageously usable in this<br>
invention are low boiling organic solvents such as pentane,<br>
butane, and fleon, thermally expanding microcapsules<br>
enclosing such volatile liquids therewith, inorganic foaming<br>
agents such as sodium bicarbonate and ammonium carbonate,<br>
and organic foaming agents such as azodicarboxylic acid amide<br>
and AIBN among other foaming agents enumerated above. Besides,<br>
the foaming agents which are disclosed in JP-A-1999-35691,<br>
JP-A-1999-292919, JP-A-1999-302391, and JP-A-2000-63527are<br>
advantageously usable.<br>
When the foaming agent is incorporated in the aqueous<br>
monomer solution, the amount thereof to be used is in the<br>
range of 0.001 - 100 wt. parts, more preferably 0.005 - 80<br>
wt. parts, and particularly preferably 0.01 - 30 wt. parts<br>
based on 100 wt. parts of the monomer. Such characteristic<br>
elements of the voids in the produced foamed article such<br>
as continuity, dependence, size, shape, distribution, and<br>
uniformity of size can be controlled by properly setting the<br>
foaming conditions to suit the purpose of foaming.<br>
More specifically, a method which comprises preparing<br>
an aqueous monomer solution, adding this solution and a<br><br>
carbonate type foaming agent together thereby forming a<br>
carbonate-containing monomer solution, polymerizing this<br>
solution thereby obtaining a water-soluble porous polymer,<br>
or polymerizing an aqueous monomer solution having a low<br>
boiling organic solvent such as hexane dispersed therein<br>
thereby producing amicroporous water-soluble porous polymer,<br>
or having a water-insoluble foaming agent dispersed in an<br>
aqueous monomer solution through the medium of a surfactant<br>
and subsequently polymerizing the solution while causing the<br>
foaming agent to emit bubbles in the solution is also available.<br>
It is also permissible to adopt a method which effects<br>
polymerization by the use of an azo initiator having a 10-hour<br>
half life at a temperature in the range of 30 - 120 °C (refer<br>
to WO 95/17455) and a method which consists in polymerizing<br>
a water-soluble monomer in the presence of a foaming agent<br>
formed of an acrylic acid salt complex of azo compound (refer<br>
to WO 96/17884).<br>
In the conventional polymerization using a foaming agent,<br>
the reaction solution has been required to possess such<br>
viscosity as to retain bubbles therein. When a cross-linked<br>
structure is contained, the solution possesses sufficient<br>
viscosity and can produce a porous polymer. When no<br>
cross-linked structure is contained, however, the solution<br>
fails to retain bubbles therein and can not produce porous<br>
polymer. The water-soluble polymer produced by this invention<br>
has a high polymerization velocity and has an ability to adjust<br>
the polymerization temperature at a low level. Thus, it excels<br>
in the ability to retain bubbles from start of the<br>
polymerization to completion of it, therefore, allows<br>
production of a water-soluble porous polymer of high quality.<br>
Particularly, the addition of a surfactant results in the<br>
retention of bubbles in original diameters.<br><br>
(III): The term "the method of boiling point<br>
polymerization" refers to a method of repressing radiation<br>
of heat and heightening the polymerization velocity by causing<br>
the polymerization to start at a temperature approximating<br>
the boiling point of the aqueous monomer solution. The fact<br>
that the polymerization temperature can be retained in the<br>
neighborhood of the boiling point brings the advantage of<br>
nearly fixing the amount of heat during the course of<br>
polymerization and repressing the cross-linking reaction.<br>
At this time, the boiling may be utilized in generating bubbles .<br>
That is, this method consists in enabling the polymer to contain<br>
bubbles therein by completing the polymerization before the<br>
bubbles vanish.<br>
The interval between the preparation of the bubbles<br>
mentioned above and the start of polymerization to be described<br>
below is preferably within two hours, more preferably within<br>
1 hour, furthermore preferably within 30 minutes, and the<br>
most preferably within 10 minutes. When the bubbles are<br>
prepared by stirring and mixing an inert gas and they are<br>
then left standing for a period exceeding two hours, they<br>
will possibly vanish. Also when such a basic foaming agent<br>
as a carbonate is used where the monomer happens to be acrylic<br>
acid, the generation of a gas will possibly decrease with<br>
the elapse of time.<br>
(3) Polymerization<br>
The method for polymerizing the monomer does not need<br>
to be particularly restricted but is only required to enable<br>
an aqueous monomer solution having a polymerization initiator<br>
incorporated in advance therein to be polymerized while<br>
continuing to contain bubbles therein. Generally, the<br>
polymerization is effected thermally with the object of<br>
promoting the polymerization. For this thermal<br><br>
polymerization, any of the known methods such as aqueous<br>
solution polymerization, reversed-phase suspension<br>
polymerization, bulk polymerization, and precipitation<br>
polymerization may be adopted. The reaction conditions such<br>
as reaction temperature and reaction time do not need to be<br>
particularly restricted but may be properly selected to suit<br>
the composition of the monomer component to be used, the method<br>
of generating bubbles, and the kind and amount of a foaming<br>
agent.<br>
Instead of the thermal polymerization, this invention<br>
may resort to the photopolymerization which is effected by<br>
having an aqueous monomer solution incorporate therein a<br>
photopolymerization initiator in advance and exposing the<br>
aqueous monomer solution to a radiation such as gamma ray,<br>
Xray, or electronrayor an ultraviolet light, near ultraviolet<br>
light, or visible light. It is also permissible to use the<br>
thermal polymerization and the photopolymerization together,<br>
namely to carry out the thermal polymerization while the<br>
photopolymerization is being performed by virtue of the<br>
exposure to the radiation such as gamma ray, X ray, or electron<br>
ray or ultraviolet light, near ultraviolet light, or visible<br>
light. This invention prefers sole use of<br>
photopolymerization or combined use of thermal polymerization<br>
and photopolymerization. The photopolymerization enjoys a<br>
short polymerization time and a low polymerization<br>
temperature and, therefore, brings such advantages as<br>
manifesting an excellent ability to retain bubbles, forming<br>
a small residual monomer, and ensuring production of a<br>
water-soluble porous polymer of a large weight average<br>
molecular weight. The water-soluble porous polymer<br>
consequently obtained, when used as a sanitary material,<br>
inflicts no significant stimulus on the skin because of the<br><br>
small residual monomer content and, when used to form an aqueous<br>
solution, allows an increase in the intrinsic viscosity of<br>
the produced solution because of the high weight average<br>
molecular weight.<br>
As concrete examples of the light exposure device,<br>
high-pressure mercury lamp, low-pressure mercury lamp, metal<br>
halide lamp, fluorescent chemical lamp, fluorescent blue<br>
color lamp, blacklight mercury lamp, and xenon lamp may be<br>
cited. The wavelength of the light is in the range of 100<br>
- 800 nm, more preferably 100 - 500 nm and particularly<br>
preferably 200 - 500 nm. If the wavelength falls short of<br>
100 nm, the shortage will possibly render difficult the control<br>
of polymerization because of its strong effect of promoting<br>
polymerization, giving rise to bumping at times, and<br>
increasing to the insoluble component. Conversely, if the<br>
wavelength exceeds 800 nm, the overage will result in requiring<br>
the polymerization time to be increased. This problem can<br>
be solved by weakening the intensity first and then enhancing<br>
the intensity subsequently.<br>
The intensity of irradiation is not more than 100 W/m2,<br>
preferably not more than 80 W/m2, and more preferably not more<br>
than 50 W/m2. Thus, it is made possible to promote the<br>
polymerization quickly and produce a water-soluble porous<br>
polymer having a small residual monomer content and a<br>
relatively large weight average molecular weight. The<br>
photopolymerization may be performed with the intensity of<br>
exposure kept constant. Preferably, the intensity is kept<br>
constant below 100 W/m2 and increased in the intermediate stage<br>
rather than at the start of the polymerization.<br>
In the photopolymerization of this kind, the aqueous<br>
monomer solution is supplied in a thickness of not more than<br>
100 mm, preferably not more than 50 mm, more preferably not<br><br>
more than 30 mm, and the most preferably not more than 10<br>
mm and the thickness of the solution is exposed to the light.<br>
When the polymerization is started, the heat of polymerization<br>
is emitted. The temperature during the polymerization varies<br>
with the method of generating bubbles. Generally, this<br>
temperature is controlled in the range of 20 - 200 °C, preferably<br>
50 - 180 °C, and more preferably 60 - 150 °C.<br>
This invention prefers the volume of the porous polymer<br>
after completion of the polymerization to be 1.1 - 20 times,<br>
preferably 1.3 - 20 times, and particularly preferably 1.5<br>
- 20 times, the volume of the aqueous monomer solution prior<br>
to the polymerization. In the conventional operation of<br>
polymerization reaction performed in a stirred state, the<br>
change of volume due to the addition of bubbles does not reach<br>
1.01 times the original volume. The change of volume exceeding<br>
1.1 times the original volume may well be regarded as resulting<br>
fromintentionallyincorporatingbubbles. Incidentally, the<br>
change in volume of the aqueous monomer solution during the<br>
polymerization can be easily confirmed because it is<br>
manifested as a proportionate change in height of the water<br>
line. If the volume of the water-soluble porous polymer after<br>
completion of the polymerization falls short of 1.1 times<br>
the volume of the aqueous monomer solution at the time of<br>
starting the polymerization, the shortage will possibly<br>
result in degrading the efficiency with which the molecular<br>
weight is increased and the cost of production is lowered<br>
by bubbling. If the volume exceeds 20 times the original<br>
volume, the overage will possibly degrade the efficiency with<br>
which the drying and the disintegrating are effected<br>
proportionately to the bulkiness.<br>
In the case of the thermal polymerization, the time of<br>
starting polymerization is when the heating is started. In<br><br>
the case of the photopolymerization, the time of starting<br>
polymerization is when the exposure to the light is started.<br>
The time of completing polymerization is when the reaction<br>
of polymerization is completed. In the case of the thermal<br>
polymerization, this is when the heating is discontinued.<br>
In the case of the photopolymerization, this is when the<br>
exposure to light is discontinued.<br>
When the aqueous monomer solution is made to contain<br>
therein bubbles in the form of mousse by the method of (1-1)<br>
mentioned above, generally, the mousse is extruded in a<br>
thickness in the range of 1 - 30 mm and more preferably 1<br>
-	20 mm and the mousse is exposed to a light of an intensity<br>
of 5 - 100 W/m2 and a wavelength of 200 - 600 nm for a period<br>
in the range of 30 seconds - 30 minutes, more pireferably 1<br>
-	20 minutes, and particularly preferably 1 - 15 minutes,<br>
though variable with the content of bubbles. If the thickness<br>
exceeds 30 mm, the overage will result in preventing the light<br>
from reaching the bottom part of the mousse and unduly adding<br>
to the polymerization time. If the intensity of the light<br>
exceeds 100 W/m2 and if the light exposure time exceeds 30<br>
minutes, the overage will possibly result in bringing the<br>
disadvantage of encouraging a cross-linking reaction. When<br>
the aqueous monomer solution supplied in the form of a mousse<br>
is polymerized by the exposure of light, the polymerization<br>
time can be shortened as compared with the thermal<br>
polymerization and the polymerization can be advanced<br>
smoothly in spite of a low polymerization temperature and,<br>
as a result, the retention of bubbles is attained favorably<br>
and the product is obtained in a high concentration.<br>
When the aqueous solution polymerization is applied to<br>
the aqueous monomer solution enabled to contain bubbles by<br>
the method of (1-2) mentioned above, this aqueous solution<br><br>
is fed in a height in the range of 1 - 20 mm and more preferably<br>
1 - 10 mm and the sheet of the solution is exposed to a light<br>
of an intensity of 5 - 100 W/m2 and a wavelength of 200 -<br>
600 nm for a period in the range of 2 - 30 minutes and more<br>
preferably 2-20 minutes. At this time, the polymerization<br>
temperature is preferably in the range of 20 - 150 °C and more<br>
preferably 30 - 120 °C. If these conditions deviate from the<br>
relevant ranges specified above, the deviation will possibly<br>
result in rendering difficult the adjustment of the volume<br>
of the produced polymer to 1.1 - 20 times the original volume.<br>
When the bubbles are generated in the form of soap bubbles<br>
by the method of (1-3) mentioned above, the mass of bubbles<br>
is extruded in a thickness in the range of 1 - 30 mm and more<br>
preferably 1-20 mm and the extruded sheet of bubbles is<br>
exposed to a light of an intensity of 5 - 100 W/m2 and a wavelength<br>
of 200 - 600 nm for a period in the range of 2 - 30 minutes,<br>
more preferably 2-20 minutes, and particularly preferably<br>
2-15 minutes. If the thickness of the bubbles exceeds 30<br>
mm, the overage will result in preventing the light from<br>
reaching the bottom part and unduly adding to the<br>
polymerization time. If the intensity of the light exceeds<br>
100 W/m2 and if the exposure time exceeds 30 minutes, the overage<br>
will possibly result in inducing vanishment of bubbles.<br>
When the aqueous monomer solution is caused to have air<br>
bubbled dissolved therein by the method of (1-4) mentioned<br>
above, this aqueous monomer solution is extruded in a height<br>
in the range of 1 - 20 mm and more preferably 1 - 10 mm and<br>
the extruded sheet is exposed to a light of an intensity of<br>
5 - 100 W/m2 and a wavelength of 200 - 600 nm for a period<br>
in the range of 2 - 30 minutes and more preferably 2-20<br>
minutes. At this time, the polymerization is performed at<br>
a temperature preferably in the range of 20 - 150 °C and more<br><br>
preferably 30 - 120 °C. If these conditions deviate from the<br>
relevant ranges specified above, the deviation will possibly<br>
result in rendering difficult the adjustment of the volume<br>
of the resultant polymer to 1.1 - 20 times the original volume.<br>
When the aqueous monomer solution containing a<br>
photopolymerization initiator is caused to have a foaming<br>
agent dissolved or dispersed therein by the method of (II)<br>
mentioned above, this aqueous monomer solution is preferred<br>
to be subjected to photopolymerization under the same<br>
conditions as when the aqueous monomer solution is supplied<br>
in the form of mousse. The aqueous monomer solution prior<br>
to polymerization is supplied in a thickness in the range<br>
of 0.5 - 30 mm, more preferably 1 - 20 mm and particularly<br>
preferably 1-10 mm. As a result, the polymerization by the<br>
exposure to light can be initiated and advanced fully<br>
satisfactorily even when the volume thereof is increased by<br>
bubbling.<br>
In the case of the boiling point polymerization of (III) ,<br>
it is preferred to be performed under the same conditions<br>
as in the case of (II) mentioned above.<br>
For the polymerization reaction, either continuous<br>
polymerization or batch polymerization may be adopted. The<br>
polymerization may be carried out under a reduced pressure,<br>
an increased pressure, or normal pressure. Incidentally, the<br>
polymerization is preferred to be performed in a stream of<br>
such an inert gas as nitrogen, helium, argon, or carbonic<br>
acid gas . When the oxygen concentration in the aqueous monomer<br>
solution is satisfactorily decreased, the polymerization may<br>
be carried out in an atmosphere of air.<br>
(4) Water-soluble porous polymer<br>
The shape of the water-soluble porous polymer obtained<br>
as described above varies with the method of polymerization<br><br>
used. The polymer may be in any of various shapes such as<br>
particles, a belt, a plate, or a clayish mass. The<br>
water-soluble porous polymer obtained by the method described<br>
above has a weight average molecular weight, determined by<br>
the GPC as reduced to polyacrylic acid, in the range of 1, 000<br>
- 10,000,000, preferably 5,000 - 10,000,000, and more<br>
preferably 5,000 - 8,000,000. Since the polymerization<br>
proceeds in the aqueous monomer solution containing bubbles,<br>
the polymerization is performed uniformly and the polymer<br>
consequently formed has a higher molecular weight then ever.<br>
This polymer has a water-insoluble content of not more than l0<br>
wt.%, more preferably not more than 7 wt.% and the most<br>
preferably not more than 5 wt.%. Thus, the porous polymer<br>
truly excels in water-solubility as compared with the<br>
conventional porous polymer. It is provided that the<br>
"water-insoluble content" is determined by the method which<br>
is described in the working examples cited herein below.<br>
The water-soluble porous polymer mentioned above has<br>
an air bubble content in the range of 2 - 90% and preferably<br>
5 - 80%. Since this polymer has a voids ratio in the range<br>
mentioned above, it enjoys an enhanced water-solubility. The<br>
percentage of voids is determined by photographing the cross<br>
section of the porous polymer by the use of a scanning electron<br>
microscope (made by Hitachi, Ltd. and sold under the product<br>
code of "SEM: S-3500N type") and analyzing the photograph<br>
with an image analyzing device (made by Nippon Shokubai K.K.)<br>
thereby calculating the total area of the bubbles in accordance<br>
with the following formula.<br>
Percentage of voids (%) = 100 x(area of bubbles/total<br>
area analyzed)<br>
The water-soluble porous polymer obtained by the method<br>
described above has viscosity preferably in the range of 0 . 001<br><br>
- 10 Pa.s, more preferably 0.002 - 5 Pa.s, and particularly<br>
preferably 0.003 - 2 Pa.s. When the viscosity is in the range<br>
specified above, the water-soluble porous polymer can<br>
manifest a truly excellent effect as a flocculant and a<br>
tackifier. The viscosity is the numerical value obtained by<br>
preparing an aqueous 0.2 wt.% solution of the powder and<br>
measuring the solution for viscosity by the use of a B type<br>
viscosimeter at 25 °C. This invention can accomplish the<br>
polymerization in a short time at a low temperature owing<br>
to the photopolymerization and can effect the production of<br>
a water-soluble porous polymer of a high molecular weight<br>
in a short time owing to the incorporation of a chain transfer<br>
agent. While the viscosity of a water-soluble polymer depends<br>
on the molecular weight of the polymer, this invention can<br>
produce a water-soluble porous polymer of high viscosity by<br>
a simple and convenient process.<br>
The water-soluble porous polymer obtained by the<br>
polymerization can be sliced or crushed in its unmodified<br>
state and put to use or can be sliced and crushed and then<br>
dried. Otherwise, it may be dried in advance and then sliced<br>
or crushed.<br>
(5) Drying<br>
The drying temperature to be used for the resultant<br>
hydrated water-soluble porous polymer is not particularly<br>
restricted. When the drying is performed under normal<br>
pressure, the drying temperature is in the range of 50 - 250<br>
°C and more preferably 100 - 200 °C. When the drying is carried<br>
out under a reduced pressure, the drying temperature is<br>
particularly preferably in the range from the boiling point<br>
of water under the reduced pressure to 200 °C. The drying<br>
time is not particularly restricted. Properly it is in the<br>
approximate range of 10 seconds - five hours. The hydrated<br><br>
water-soluble porous polymer may be treated with an acid or<br>
may be neutralized with a basic substance before it is dried.<br>
Consequently, the water-soluble porous polymer may be<br>
obtained in an acid type or a neutral salt type.<br>
The drying methods usable herein include drying in a<br>
fluidized phase, drying by heating, drying with hot air, drying<br>
under a reduced pressure, drying with an infrared ray, drying<br>
with a microwave, drying in a drum drier, dehydration by the<br>
use of an azeotrope with a hydrophobic organic solvent, and<br>
high-humidity drying by the use of steam of a high temperature,<br>
for example, though not exclusively. Among other drying<br>
methods cited above, the drying in a fluidized phase and drying<br>
with hot air prove particularly advantageous.<br>
The water-soluble porous polymer of this invention is<br>
a porous material as implied by its name. Thus, it abounds<br>
in surface areas for contact with the ambient air and excels<br>
in drying efficiency as compared with a nonporous polymer<br>
and allows a reduction in the drying time.<br>
Further, since this polymer also excels in the cooling<br>
efficiency for the same reason, it can curtail the cooling<br>
time after polymerization or after drying. As a result, the<br>
process which continues till disintegratingand/or crushing<br>
can be performed efficiently.<br>
(6) Disintegrating and/or crushing<br>
The water-soluble porous polymer after drying or<br>
occasionally after polymerization may be disintegrated and/or<br>
crushed by a prescribed method into fragments measuring 10<br>
μm - 1000 mm, preferably lOum - 100 mm, and particularly<br>
preferably lOum - 10 mm. After the water-soluble porous<br>
polymer has been dried by the method described above, it has<br>
a water content of not more than 15 wt.%, more preferably<br>
not more than 10 wt.% and particularly preferably not more<br><br>
than 5 wt. %. This polymer may be disintegrated and/or crushed<br>
by a disintegrating and/or crushing device which fits the<br>
water content. Particularly, the water-soluble porous<br>
polymer which is obtained by the method of this invention<br>
copiously contains pores formed by the numerous bubbles in<br>
the texture of the polymer and the polymer layer forming these<br>
pores has a small thickness. By the application of the same<br>
power as used when the conventional unfoamed water-soluble<br>
polymer is disintegrated, therefore, this polymer can be<br>
disintegrated or crushed into minuter fragments. The<br>
crushing devices which are usable herein include those of<br>
impact type, compression type, and shear type. As concrete<br>
examples of the crushing device, a cutter mill, a vibration<br>
mill, a roll granulater, a knuckle type crushing device, a<br>
roll mill, a jaw crusher, a planar crusher, a shred crusher,<br>
high-speed rotary crushing devices (pin mill, hammer mill,<br>
screw mill, and roll mill) , and a cylindrical mixer may be<br>
cited.<br>
Incidentally, the water content mentioned above is found<br>
by weighing 1 g of a sample in an aluminum cup, drying the<br>
sample with a hot air drier (made by Tabai K.K.) at 130 °C<br>
for two hours, and calculating the difference in weight of<br>
the sample before and after the drying.<br>
The second aspect of this invention is directed towarda<br>
water-soluble porous polymer obtained by polymerizing an<br>
aqueous monomer solution containing an ethylenically<br>
unsaturated monomer, which polymer has a voids ratio in the<br>
range of 5 - 80% based on the volume of the polymer and a<br>
water-insoluble content of not more than 10 wt.%. The<br>
water-soluble porous polymer of this quality can be produced<br>
by the method according to the first aspect of this invention.<br>
The method for the production of this polymer, however, does<br><br>
percentage of voids falls short of 5%, the shortage will result<br>
in lessening the effect of enhancing the solubility in water.<br>
If it exceeds 80%, the overage will possibly degrade the<br>
strength of the powder formed by crushing. Incidentally, the<br>
percentage of voids is calculated by the method described<br>
in the preceding section (4) titled "the water-soluble porous<br>
polymer." The term "porous" as used in this invention means<br>
the presence of voids originating in numerous bubbles in the<br>
interior of a resin and the consequent deficiency in apparent<br>
density of the resin. Incidentally, the average diameter<br>
of the pores in the water-soluble porous polymer is variable<br>
with the number of bubbles and the diameters of these bubbles.<br>
It is in the range of 3um - 100 mm, preferably 5um - 50 mm,<br>
and particularly preferably 10pm - 30 mm.<br>
The third aspect of this invention is directed toward<br>
a powdered water-soluble porous polymer obtained by crushing<br>
the water-soluble porous polymer mentioned above. When the<br>
water-soluble polymer is crushed and then dissolved, as<br>
occasional demands, in an aqueous solution, the powder<br>
obtained from the porous material manifests a high solubility<br>
in water. This preference may be explained by a supposition<br>
that since the water-soluble polymer is porous before it is<br>
crushed, the surface area thereof per unit weight is<br>
proportionately exalted by the crushing. Further, the<br>
powdered water-soluble porous polymer allows more addition<br>
to the ease with which the water-soluble porous polymer<br>
mentioned above is prepared in the form of a solution. Thus,<br>
it is handled easily and conveniently when it is used in its<br>
unmodified for an agent for sewage treatment and a thickener<br>
for wallplates, for example. It occurs at times that the<br>
powdered water-soluble porous polymer obtained by crushing<br>
is devoid of a porous texture, depending on the side thereof.<br><br>
This invention embraces this powdered water-soluble porous<br>
polymer devoid of a porous texture in the range of the powdered<br>
water-soluble porous polymer contemplated by this invention<br>
so long as it has resulted from crushing the aforementioned<br>
water-soluble porous polymer.<br>
The powdered water-soluble porous polymer of this<br>
invention can be prepared by disintegrating or crushing the<br>
aforementioned water-soluble porous polymer into fragments<br>
measuring about 10pm - 10 mm, more preferably about 30um -<br>
5 mm, and particularly preferably about 50um- 3 mm. The extent<br>
of this crushing or disintegrating may be properly selected,<br>
depending on the water content of the water-soluble porous<br>
polymer not yet crushed. When the water content is 10 wt.%,<br>
for example, the aforementioned crushing device may be used.<br>
Particularly, the powdered water-soluble porous polmer which<br>
is obtained by the method of this invention is prepared by<br>
crushing a porous material and, by the application of the<br>
same power as used when the conventional non-porous<br>
water-soluble polymer is disintegrated, can be disintegrated<br>
or crushed into minuter fragments.<br>
The water-soluble porous polymer has a bulk specific<br>
gravity preferably in the range of 0.1 - 1.2 g/ml, more<br>
preferably 0.1 - 1.0 g/ml, and the most preferably 0.1 - 0.7<br>
g/ml. If the bulk specific gravity falls short of 0.1 g/ml,<br>
the shortage will result in unduly increasing impalpable<br>
powder and rendering difficult the handling as a powder.<br>
Conversely, if it exceeds 1.2 g/ml, the overage will result<br>
in degrading the speedof dissolution in water. Incidentally,<br>
the bulk specific gravity is found by accurately weighing<br>
100 ml of a given powdered water-soluble porous polymer and<br>
weighing this sample.<br>
The water-soluble porous polymer and the powdered<br><br>
water-soluble porous polymer of this invention do not<br>
particularly need to restrict the viscosity which they<br>
manifest when they are dissolved in a solution. The viscosity<br>
is preferably in the range of 0.001 - 10 Pa. s, more preferably<br>
0.002 - 5 Pa.s, and particularly preferably 0.003 - 2 Pa.s.<br>
As stated in the foregoing section (4) titled "water-soluble<br>
porous polymer," the scope is commended because the polymers<br>
having a viscosity falling in this range are capable of<br>
manifesting a truly outstanding effect as a flocculant and<br>
a thickener. Incidentally, the viscosiy is the numerical<br>
value determined by preparing an aqueous 0.2 wt.% solution<br>
of a given powder and measuring the aqueous solution for<br>
viscosity with a B type viscosimeter at 25 °C.<br>
The water-soluble porous polymer and the powdered<br>
water-soluble porous polymer of this invention, when<br>
necessary, may further incorporate therein deodorant, perfume,<br>
dye, hydrophilic short fibers, plasticizer, tackifier,<br>
surfactant, fertilizer, oxidizing agent, reducing agent,<br>
water, and salt so as to endow the water-soluble porous polymer<br>
and the powdered water-soluble porous polymer with various<br>
functions.<br>

Now, this invention will be described more specifically<br>
below with reference to working examples and comparative<br>
examples.<br>
Example 1<br>
A vessel made of stainless steel and measuring 10 cm<br>
in inside diameter and 500 ml in inner volume was equipped<br>
with a nitrogen introducing pipe, a gas release pipe, and<br>
a silicone rubber plug fitted with a thermometer. In this<br>
vessel, 2.57 g of purified water, 58.18g of an aqueous 37%<br>
sodium acrylate solution, and 37.7 3 g of acrylic acid were<br>
placed and stirred with a magnetic stirrer and the entrapped<br>
air was thoroughly displaced with nitrogen till the dissolved<br>
oxygen content fell to not more than 0.5 ppm. In this while,<br>
the stainless steel vessel was cooled with ice water to keep<br>
the inner temperature thereof to not higher than 10 °C.<br>
Subsequently, 0.7 6 g of an aqueous 1% sodium hypophosphite<br>
solution, 0.7 6 g of a 1% acrylic acid solution having a<br>
photopolymerization initiator (made by Ciba Specialty<br>
Chemicals K.K. and sold under the trademark designation of<br>
"Irgacure 819") dissolved therein, and 0.50 g of a foaming<br>
agent (made by Matsumoto Yushi Seiyaku K.K. and sold under<br>
the trademark designation of "Matsumoto Microsphere F-36")<br>
were additionally placed and uniformly mixed to obtain a<br>
reaction solution.<br>
This solution was fed within 5 minutes after addition<br><br>
of the foaming agent into a polymerization vessel made of<br>
polytetrafluoroethylene (sold under the trademark<br>
designation of "Teflon") measuring 200 mm in diameter and<br>
displaced with nitrogen till a thickness of 3 mm and was<br>
irradiated for 3 minutes with an ultraviolet light of an<br>
intensity of 22 W/m2. The peak temperature of the heat<br>
generated by the polymerization was 101 °C. After the<br>
polymerization was completed, a white foam swelled to 1.4<br>
times the volume existing when the polymerization was started<br>
was obtained. The percentage of voids in this foam was 30%.<br>
When this foam was dried with a hot air drier till the water<br>
content fell to not more than 5 wt.%, 140 °C and 10 minutes<br>
were necessary. The foam was further crushed with a bench<br>
mill at 15, 7 00 rpm for 30 seconds to obtain a powder of 8 0-mesh<br>
pass in an amount of 55% of the whole amount. The bulk specific<br>
gravity of this powder was 0.32 g/ml. An aqueous 0.2 wt.%<br>
solution of this powder was prepared and was tested for<br>
viscosity with a B type viscosimeter. The viscosity was found<br>
to be 390 mPa.s. The water-insoluble content of the solution<br>
was 0. 2 wt. % . An aqueous 0.1 wt. % solution of the powder was<br>
prepared and determined concentration of acrylic acid in the<br>
solution by liquid chromatography and calculated a residual<br>
acrylic acid content in the powder. This content was found<br>
to be 700 ppm.<br><percentage of voids><br>
Incidentally, the percentage of voids was found by<br>
photographing the cross section of a given porous material<br>
by using a scanning type electron microscope (made by Hitachi,<br>
Ltd. and sold under the trademark designation of "SEM: S-3500N<br>
type"), calculating the total surface area of bubbles from<br>
the photograph with an image analyzing device (made by Nippon<br><br>
Shokubai K.K.), and calculating the percentage of voids in<br>
accordance with the following formula.<br>
Percentage of voids (%) = 100 * (area of bubbles/total<br>
area analyzed)<br><water-insoluble content><br>
Then, the water-insoluble content was found by<br>
accurately weighing 0.80 g as solids of a sample, dissolving<br>
the sample in deionized water to a total amount of 400.0 g<br>
thereby preparing a 0.20 wt.% sample solution, passing the<br>
sample solution through a 250-um sieve (JIS {Japanese<br>
Industrial Standard} Z 8801-1953) thereby withdrawing an<br>
insoluble substance of a hydrated state, and calculating the<br>
water-insoluble content in accordance with the following<br>
formula.<br>
Insoluble content (wt.%) = 100 * (weight of insoluble<br>
substance (g)/400 (g) )<br>
Example 2<br>

gof anaqueous 0.1 wt .%poly (sodiumacrylate) solution, 135.75<br>
g of an aqueous 37% sodiumacrylate solution, 88. 01 gof acrylic<br>
acid, and 4.2 g of sorbitan monostearate (made by Kao<br>
Corporation and sold under the trademark designation of<br>
"Rheodol SP-S10") were placed and stirred with a magnetic<br>
stirrer and the entrapped air was thoroughly displaced with<br>
nitrogen till the dissolved oxygen content fell to not more<br>
than 0.5 ppm. At this time, the stainless steel vessel was<br><br>
cooled with ice water to keep the inner temperature thereof<br>
to not higher than 10 °C. Subsequently, 1.78 g of an aqueous<br>
1% sodium hypophosphite solution and 1.78 g of a 1% acrylic<br>
acid solution having a photopolymerization initiator (made<br>
by Ciba Specialty Chemicals K.K. and sold under the trademark<br>
designation of "Darocur 1173") dissolved therein were<br>
additionally placed and uniformly mixed to obtain a reaction<br>
solution. This solution was fed via the pump type nozzle in<br>
the form of mousse into a polymerization vessel made of Teflon<br>
measuring 200 mm in diameter and displaced with nitrogen till<br>
a thickness of 10 mm and was immediately irradiated for 10<br>
minutes with an ultraviolet light of an intensity of 22 W/m2.<br>
The peak temperature of the heat generated by the<br>
polymerization was 92 °C. After the polymerization was<br>
completed, a white mousse-like foam was obtained. The<br>
percentage of voids in this foam was 21%. When this foam was<br>
coarsely crushed with a meat chopper (made by Masuko K.K.)<br>
and dried with a hot air drier till the water content fell<br>
to not more than 5 wt.%, 140 °C and 15 minutes were necessary.<br>
The dried foam was further crushed with a bench mill at 15, 700<br>
rpm for 30 seconds to obtain a powder of 80-mesh pass in an<br>
amount of 28% of the whole amount. The bulk specific gravity<br>
of this powder was 0.41 g/ml. An aqueous 0.2 wt.% solution<br>
of this powder was prepared and was tested for viscosity with<br>
a B type viscosimeter. The viscosity was found to be 4 90 mPa. s.<br>
The water-insoluble content of the solution was 0.2 wt.%.<br>
An aqueous 0.1 wt.% solution of the powder was prepared and<br>
determined concentration of acrylic acid in the solution by<br>
liquid chromatography and calculated a residual acrylic acid<br>
content in the powder. This content was found to be 1,700<br>
ppm.<br><br>

vessel, 67.60 g of acrylic acid was placed and stirred with<br>
a magnetic stirrer and the entrapped air was thoroughly<br>
displaced with nitrogen till the dissolved oxygen content<br>
fell to not more than 0.5 ppm. At this time, the stainless<br>
steel vessel was cooled with ice water to keep the inner<br>

photopolymerization initiator (made by Ciba Specialty<br>
Chemicals K.K. and sold under the trademark designation of<br>

and uniformly mixed to obtain a reaction solution. Separately,<br>
a solution having 14.93 g of sodium carbonate dissolved in<br>
48.25 g of purified water was prepared and displaced similarly<br>
with nitrogen. These solutions were uniformly mixed and<br>
immediately fed into a polymerization vessel made of Teflon<br>
and measuring 200 mm in diameter and displaced with nitrogen<br>
till a thickness of 3.5 mm and was irradiated for 15 minutes<br>
with an ultraviolet light having an intensity of 22 w/m2. The<br>
peak temperature of the heat generated by the polymerization<br>
was 108 °C. After the polymerization was completed, a white<br>
foam swelled to 1.7 times the volume existing when the<br>
polymerization was started was obtained. The percentage of<br>
voids in this foam was 41%.<br>
When this foam was dried with a hot air drier till the<br>
water content fell to not more than 5 wt.%, 140 °C and 10 minutes<br>
were necessary. The foam was further crushed with a bench<br><br>
mill at 15,700 rpm for 30 seconds to obtain a powder of 80-mesh<br>
pass in an amount of 39% of the whole amount. The bulk specific<br>
gravity of this powder was 0.38 g/ml. An aqueous 0.2 wt.%<br>
solution of this powder was prepared and was tested for<br>
viscosity with a B type viscosimeter. The viscosity was found<br>
to be 390 mPa. s. The water-insoluble content of the solution<br>

resulting from the treatment were evaluated in accordance<br>
with the standards shown in the following table. The<br>
evaluation value was 6.<br><evaluation soil><br>
Samples winning evaluation values of 4 or over were passed<br>
This was a hydrated soil formed by thoroughly mixing<br>
5 wt. parts of Toyoura standard sand, 7 5 wt. parts of silt,<br>
270 wt. parts of clay, and 350 wt. parts of tap water. The<br>
flow value of this evaluation soil was 250 mm<br><br><br>
and samples winning evaluation values of 3 or less were rejected.<br>
The samples winning evaluation values of 4 and 5 were fully<br>
granulated to permit easy transportation on trucks.<br>
Depending on places of use, they were usable as refilling<br>
materials. The samples winning evaluation value of 6 were<br>
usable satisfactorily for soil refilling materials.<br><method for calculation of flow value><br>
The flow value of a soil for evaluation was found by<br>
placing a hollow cylinder measuring 55 mm in inside diameter<br>
and 55 mm in height on a table, filling the cylinder with<br>
the soil, lifting the cylinder vertically and consequently<br>
allowing the soil to spread on the table, measuring the diameter<br>
of the spread soil in two directions, and averaging these<br>
two diameters.<br>

1.5 times the volume existing when the polymerization was<br>
started was obtained . The percentage of voids in this foam<br>
was 35%. The water content of this foam was 11%, When this<br>
foam in the undried state was crushed with a bench mill at<br>
15,700 rpm for 30 seconds to obtain a powder of 80-mesh pass<br>
in an amount of 41% of the whole amount. The bulk specific<br>
gravity of this powder was 0.35 g/ml. An aqueous 0.2 wt.%<br>
solution of this foam was prepared and was tested for viscosity<br>
with a B type viscosimeter. The viscosity was found to be<br>
108 mPa.s. The water-insoluble content of the solution was<br>
0.5 wt.%. An aqueous 0.1 wt.% solution of the powder was<br>
prepared and determined concentrations of acrylic acid and<br>
2-acrylamide-2-methyl propane sulfonic acid in the solution<br>
by liquid chromatography and calculated a residual acrylic<br>
acid content and a residual 2-acrylamide-2-methylpropane<br>
sulfonic acid content in the powder. These contents were<br>
respectively found to be 4,100 ppm and 3,800 ppm.<br>
Comparative Example 2<br>
A vessel made of stainless steel and measuring 10 cm<br>
in inside diameter and 500 ml in inner volume was equipped<br>
with a nitrogen introducing pipe, an air release pipe, and<br>
a silicone rubber plug fitted with a thermometer. In this<br>
vessel, 67.60 g of acrylic acid, 48.25 g of purified water,<br>
and 14.93 g of sodium carbonate were placed and stirred with<br>
a magnetic stirrer and the entrapped air was thoroughly<br>
displaced with nitrogen at room temperature till the dissolved<br><br>
oxygen content fell to not more than 0.5 ppm. Subsequently,<br>
0.94 g of an aqueous 1% sodium hypophosphite solution and<br>
0.94 g of a 1% acrylic acid solution having a<br>
photopolymerization initiator (made by Ciba Specialty<br>
Chemicals K.K. and sold under the trademark designation of<br>
"Darocur 1173") dissolved therein were additionally placed<br>
and uniformly mixed to obtain a reaction solution. In the<br>
vessel, this reaction solution was left standing as shielded<br>
from light for 3 hours while the entrapped air was displaced<br>
with nitrogen. During the first period of about 10 minutes,<br>
the reaction solution violently effervesced because of the<br>
reaction between acrylic acid and sodium carbonate.<br>
Thereafter, no effervescence was observed. The resultant<br>
reaction solution was fed into a polymerization vessel made<br>
of Teflon, measuring 200 mm in diameter, and displaced with<br>
nitrogen till a thickness of 3.5 mm and was irradiated for<br>
20 minutes with an ultraviolet light of an intensity of 22<br>
W/m2. In this while, absolutely no effervescence was observed.<br>
The peak temperature of the heat generated by the<br>
polymerization was 107 °C. After the polymerization was<br>
completed, a colorless transparent gel containing no air<br>
bubble was obtained. The percentage of voids in this foam<br>
was 0% . When this gel was coarsely crushed with a meat chopper<br>
(made by Masuko K.K.) and dried with a hot air drier till<br>
the water content fell to not more than 5 wt.%, 140 °C and<br>
90 minutes were necessary. When the gel was not coarsely<br>
crushed with the meat chopper, the drying performed till the<br>
water content fell to not more than 5 wt.% required 140 °C<br>
and 195 minutes. The gel was further crushed with a bench<br>
mill at 15, 700 rpm for 30 seconds to obtain a powder of 80-mesh<br>
pass in an amount of 5% of the whole amount. The bulk specific<br>
gravity of this gel was 0. 93 g/ml. An aqueous 0. 2 wt. % solution<br><br>
of this powder was prepared and was tested for viscosity with<br>
a B type viscosimeter. The viscosity was found to be 440 mPa. s.<br>
The water-insoluble content of the solution was 3.1 wt. %.<br>
An aqueous 0.1 wt.% solution of the powder was prepared and<br>
determined concentration of acrylic acid in the solution by<br>
liquid chromatography and calculated a residual acrylic acid<br>
content in the powder. This content was found to be 11,500<br>
ppm.<br>

a magnetic stirrer as shielded from light and the entrapped<br>
air was thoroughly displaced with nitrogn till the dissolved<br>
oxygen content fell to not more than 0.5 ppm. Subsequently,<br>
1.65 g of a foaming agent (made by Matsumoto Yushi Seiyaku<br>
K.K. and sold under the trademark designation of "Matsumoto<br>
Microsphere F-36") was additionally placed and uniformly<br>
mixed to obtain a reaction solution.<br>
This solution was fed within 5 minutes after the addition<br>
of the foaming agent into a polymerization vessel made of<br>
Teflon, measuring 200 mm in diameter, and displaced with<br>
nitrogen till a thickness of 5 mm and was irradiated for 3<br>
minutes with an ultraviolet light of an intensity of 22 W/m2.<br><br>

a reaction solution. At this time, the stainless steel vessel<br>
was cooled with ice water to keep the inner temperature thereof<br>
to not higher than 30 °C. Subsequently, the vessel was given<br>
nitrogen bubbling and the dissolved oxygen in the reaction<br>
solution was thoroughly displaced with nitrogen till the<br>
dissolved oxygen content fell to not more than 0.1 ppm. At<br>
this time, the nitrogen bubbling was terminated. Within 30<br>
seconds of terminating the nitrogen bubbling, the reaction<br>
solution was transferred into a vat made of Teflon andmeasuring<br>
5.5 cm in width and 8.5 cm in length and exposed for 5 minutes<br>
