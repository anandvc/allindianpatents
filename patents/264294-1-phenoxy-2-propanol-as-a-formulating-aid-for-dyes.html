1-Phenoxv-2-Dropanol as a Formulating Aid for Dyes<br>
The instant invention relates to storage stable, concentrated aqueous solutions of direct dyes, both anionic dyes and cationic or basic dyes, a process for their preparation and the use thereof for dyeing paper.<br>
In recent years, the use of concentrated aqueous solutions of dyes has gained importance, especially for the dyeing of paper, due to the advantages possessed by such solutions when compared with dyes in powder form. Thus, for example, the use of solutions avoids the difficulties associated with dust formation and releases the user from the time-consuming and frequently difficult dissolving of the dye powder in water. The use of concentrated solutions was also prompted by the development of continuous dyeing processes, since it is convenient in these processes to meter the solution directly into the pulp stream or to add it at some other suitable point during the papermaking process. However, such solutions should be ecologically and toxicologically acceptable, stable on storage, also in concentrated form and be readily pumpable, even at relatively low temperatures.<br>
A recent attempt to solve this problem has been disclosed in EP 1,235,881 B1, whereby it was found that concentrated aqueous solutions of water soluble anionic dyes could be obtained by addition of up to 4% of benzyl alcohol, which solutions are both stable to storage, although the exact definitions of storage stability are not disclosed, and also exhibit desirable flow properties, although again no numerical data are divulged. Furthermore, this document also summarizes the various previous attempts to provide storage stable aqueous dye solutions by addition of, for example, urea, urea/N-methylprrolidone/benzyl alcohol mixtures, alcohols, including glycols and glycol ethers and further organic solvents, as well as the drawbacks in the use thereof.<br>
Although benzyl alcohol would appear to be the additive of choice for the preparation of storage stable aqueous formulations of anionic dyes, one clear disadvantage is the undesirable odor of benzyl alcohol, even if utilized in relatively small quantities.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that the use of 1-phenoxy-2-propanol as a formulating aid provides odorless formulations of both anionic and cationic direct dyes which are stable<br><br>
to storage over long periods and which are superior in their flow properties to those formulations disclosed in the prior art, containing benzyl alcohol.<br>
Consequently, the invention relates to an aqueous dye solution connprising<br>
a)	5 to 30%, preferably 10 to 25%, by weight of an anionic or catlonic direct dye,<br>
b)	0.1 to 10%, preferably 0.5 to 5% and. most preferably, 0.5 to 3% by weight of 1-phenoxy-2-propanol.<br>
c)	0 to 20% by weight of an inorganic or an organic acid,<br>
d)	0 to 20% by weight of further additives and<br>
e)	water to complete to 100%.<br>
Where the solutions of the invention are solutions of anionic dyes, these direct dyes are preferably selected from dyes containing at least one sulfonic acid and/or carboxylic acid group and are derived from the following dye classes: metal-free or metallic monoazo. disazo and polyazodyes, pyrazolone, thioxanthone, oxazine, stilbene, formazan, anthraquinone, nitro, methine, triphenylmethane, xanthone, naphthazarine, styryl. azastyryl, naphthoperinone. quinophthalone. and phthalocyanine dyes.<br>
Typical examples of anionic direct dyes are listed in the Colour Index International, Fourth Edition Online (uri: http:/www,colour-index.org) and may be selected from C.I. Direct Yellows 1-177, C.l. Direct Oranges 1-122. C.l. Direct Reds 1-277, C.I. Direct Violets 1-108 and C.I. Direct Blues 1-313.<br>
Where the solutions of the invention are solutions of cationic dyes, these cationic direct dyes are basic dyes. These so-called basic dyes are selected from the following classes: acridine, anthraquinone, azine. azomethine, azostyryl, mono-, bis- and polyazo, benzimidazole, benzothiazole, cyanine, di- and triarylmethane, ketone imine, methane and polymethine, naphthostyryl, nitro. oxazine and dioxazine, phthalocyanine, quinoline. quinophthalone, thiazine, thiazole and xanthene derivatives.<br>
Typical examples of cationic direct dyes are listed in the Colour Index International, Fourth Edition Online (urI: http:/www.colour-index.org) and may be selected from C.l. Basic Yellows 1-108, C.l. Basic Oranges 1-69, C.l. Basic Reds 1-118. C.l. Basic Violets 1-51 and C.l. Basic Blues 1-164.<br><br>
The invention is especially useful for solutions of specific dyes, such as CI. Basic Yellow 99 and 106, C.I. Basic Red 111, C.I. Basic Blue 100 and 153, C.I. Direct Yellow 11, 50 and 84. C.I. Direct Orange 29 and 102, C.I. Direct Red 23, 80, 81, 239, 254 and 262, C.I. Direct Violet 9, 35 and 51 and C.I. Direct Blue 75, 86, 87,199, 290 and 301.<br>
Where the composition of the invention contains an organic or inorganic acid, those acids particularly suited may be selected from, for example, hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid, formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, gluconic acid, methanesulphonic acid, citric acid, succinic acid, lactic acid, glutamic acid, adipic acid or mandelic acid. Any of these acids may be used alone or in an acid mixture, although formic acid is most preferred.<br>
Although the addition of an acid to the composition of the invention is optional, preferably the acid is present in an amount of between 1 and 20% by weight, most preferably between 1 and 5%, based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
The dye solutions according to the invention may, in addition, contain further additives as component d), such as water-soluble organic solubilizers, examples of which are urea, formamide, e-caprolactam. sugars, such as dextrine, maltose or lactose, carboxycelluloses, such asxanthan. dimethylformamide. 1.2-diaminopropane. 2-(4"aminophenyl)-6-methylbenzothiazole 7-sulphonic acid and salts thereof and polyhydric alcohols such as ethylene glycol or glycerol, e-caprolactam and 2-(4-aminophenyl)-6-methylben20thiazole 7-sulphonic acid and salts thereof being preferred. Further additives which may be present in the solutions of the invention are. for example, hydrotropic agents, viscosity regulators, dispersing agents, microbicides, particularly fungicides, and pH adjusting agents.<br>
As pH adjusting agents, it is possible to use acids, bases or buffers which are conventional and are usually used for the pH adjustment of dye formulations, for example mineral acids, such as hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid or phosphoric acid, low molecular weight aliphatic carboxytic acids, for example having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, such as formic acid, acetic acid, lactic acid or citric acid, or bases, such as alkali metal hydroxides or carbonates, or also aliphatic low molecular weight amines, such as those which can be used for the corresponding salt formation of the above mentioned acid groups, for example, ammonia.<br><br>
diethanolamine, triethanolamine or N-methyldiethanolamine. As buffers, it is possible to employ, for example, mono- or disodium phosphate, sodium acetate or ammonium sulphate.<br>
The pH of the concentrated dye solutions can thus be adjusted as required, depending upon the particular dye in question. Preferably, however, the pH of the solutions generally lies within the range of from 3 to 11, whereby, in the case of cationic dyes, a range of from 4 to 6 is preferred, whilst, in the case of anionic dyes, a pH value of between 6 and 8 is preferable.<br>
Preferably, the aqueous solutions also contain known products as are usually employed for protection against the harmful effect of microorganisms, principally products which inhibit the growth of microorganisms or also microbicides. particularly fungicides. These may be employed in low concentrations, for example, in the range of from 0.01 to 1%, especially from 0.05 to 0.5%.<br>
Although the addition of such additives to the composition of the invention is optional, preferably they are present in an amount of between 1 and 20% by weight, most preferably between 1 and 10%, based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
Apart from small quantities of impurities, which may result from the dye synthesis, and salts, the solutions of the invention are preferably, essentially free from other solvents, in particular alcohols, other than 1-phenoxy-2-propanol.<br>
In one further aspect, the invention relates to a process for the preparation of a dye solution, which process comprises stirring the dye with a mixture of water. 1-phenoxy-2-propanol and, if desired, components c) and d), as described above, at a temperature between room temperature and 90°C, preferably between 30 and 60°C and, if necessary, filtering. The dyes can be employed in the form of corresponding dry dyes, as occur in blended commercial forms, or, preferably, as moist or also dried filter cakes or also as solutions which have previously been subjected to purification by micro- or ultra filtration.<br>
Preferably, the anionic dyes are present in the form of readily water-soluble salts. Consequently, suitable salts are alkali metal salts such as lithium potassium or, especially, sodium salts or ammonium salts, mono-, di-, tri- or tetraCi-C4alkyl ammonium salts or C2-C4hydroxyalkyl ammonium salts or mixtures thereof.<br><br>
Similarly, in the case of the cationic dyes, the counter ion should be such as to ensure sufficient water solubility. Preferred salts in this case are, for example, halogenides, especially chlorides, sulphates, methosulphates and, in particular lower aliphatic carboxylates such as formates, acetates and lactates.<br>
The formulation of the invention is suitable for dyeing natural or synthetic materials, in particular cellulosic materials in any desirable shade. In particular, the formulations are suitable for dyeing paper and paperboard.<br>
Consequently, in a further aspect, the invention relates to the use of the solutions for the dyeing of paper, by treating the paper with a liquid composition as defined previously. The liquid preparation is used, optionally after dilution with water, for the dyeing of paper or paperboard, whereby these materials can be dyed, for example, in the pulp, by brushing or immersion or by applying to the paper surface by coating or spraying or for application in a continuous dyeing process, whereby the paper or paperboard which has been dyed with the liquid composition of the invention constitutes a still further aspect of the invention.<br>
The following examples serve to illustrate the invention, without intending to be restrictive in nature. Parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise stated.<br><br>
Example 1<br>
A mixture consisting of 100 parts of e-caprolactam, 30 parts of 1-phenoxy-2-propanol, 18 parts of formic acid and 270 parts of water are stirred and heated to 40*^C. 600 parts of a moist filter cake, which was previously precipitated at pH 9.0 and washed free of inorganic salts, containing 37.5% of the dye C.I. Basic Blue 100 of the formula<br>
CuPC{[S02NH(CH3)2]2-3S03H}i.2    (101), in which PC represents phthalocyanine, are then added. After stirring for 2 hours at SO'^C, the mixture is cooled and filtered to yield a solution containing 22.5% of the dye of formula (101), 10% of e-caprolactam, 1.8% formic acid and 3% 1-phenoxy-2-propanol. The solution exhibits dynamic viscosity of 300 mPas at 5*'C. is readily dilutable with water and is stable to storage at temperatures of between -10 and 50°C over a period in excess of 6 months.<br>
Similarly stable formulations are obtained by employing varying amounts of 1-phenoxy-2-propanol within the range of fromi to 5%, whereby the dynamic viscosity of the resulting solutions lies within the range of from 1500 to 200 mPas, depending on the amount of alcohol used.<br>
Additionally, similarly stable formulations are obtained containing between 1 and 5%, instead of 1.8%. formic acid, whereby the pH of the solutions varies between 3 and 6, depending upon the quantity of acid added.<br>
Stable formulations are also obtained from salt-containing filter cal<es of the dye whereby viscosity solutions increases slightly.></es>
Comparative Examples 2-6<br>
By proceeding as described in Example 1. but replacing the 30 parts of 1-phenoxy-2-propanol by 30 parts of the additives shown in Table 1, solutions are obtained, the dynamic viscosities of which are measured and the results summarized in the following Table 1 below:<br><br><br>
As is apparent from the above results, the viscosities of these solutions are substantially higher than that of the solution of Example 1.<br>
Example 7<br>
A salt free concentrate of the dye C.I. Direct Orange 102:1 of the formula<br><br>
obtained directly from the synthesis and subjected to diafiltration is treated with 1-phenoxy-2-propanol and diluted with water to yield a solution containing 1% 1-phenoxy-2-propanol and 14% of the compound of formula (102).<br>
The resulting solution exhibits a dynamic viscosity of 50 mPas at 25 °C and shows no sedimentation whatsoever upon storage at temperatures of between -10 and SOX over a period in excess of 6 months.<br><br>
Comparative Examples 8-18<br>
By proceeding as described in Example 7. but replacing the 1-phenoxy-2-propanol by the same quantities of the additives shown in Table 2, solutions are obtained, the dynamic viscosities of which are measured and the results summarized in the following Table 2 below:<br><br>
As is apparent from the above results, the viscosities of these solutions are substantially higher than that of the solution of Example 7.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
