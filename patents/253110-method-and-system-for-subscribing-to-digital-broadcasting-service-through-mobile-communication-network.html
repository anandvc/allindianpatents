METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR SUBSCRIBING TO DIGITAL<br>
BROADCASTING SERVICE THROUGH MOBILE COMMUNICATION<br>
NETWORK<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method and system for enabling a third<br>
generation (3G) mobile equipment to subscribe to a digital broadcasting service<br>
and receive the digital broadcasting service by using information about the mobile<br>
equipment's subscription to a 3G mobile communication network.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
The digitization of terrestrial broadcasting and satellite broadcasting and<br>
the launching of digital broadcasting have resulted in the proliferation of digital<br>
broadcast programs. At present, many users view the digital broadcasts through<br>
fixed digital TV terminals. A user can subscribe to the digital broadcasts using a<br>
written form, using a telephone device etc. and then must wait some time before<br>
being able to receive the desired digital broadcast.<br>
The recent rapid development of mobile communication technology has<br>
spurred the introduction of mobile equipment equipped with a digital<br>
broadcasting reception function. This mobile equipment can access a 3G mobile<br>
communication network, receive mobile communication services, and receive a<br>
digital broadcast over the mobile communication network. However, the<br>
conventional subscription methods used to subscribe to digital broadcast systems<br>
are not suitable for mobile equipment wherein simplicity and fast service are<br>
highly desired. Moreover, mobile equipment users may be required to provide a<br>
digital broadcast service provider with the same personal information as<br>
submitted for subscription to the 3G mobile communication network. Accordingly,<br>
this is a need for a method for subscribing to the digital broadcast in real time/on<br>
line using the existing subscription information of the mobile communication<br>
network.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
An object of the present invention is to substantially solve at least the<br>
above problems and/or disadvantages and to provide at least the advantages below.<br>
Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a method and system<br>
for transmitting 3G network subscription information and other required<br>
information of a 3G network subscriber (i.e., a user) to a DBS (Digital<br>
Broadcasting System) upon request for subscription to a digital broadcasting<br>
service by the 3G network subscriber, which will be received through digital<br>
broadcasting-enabled user equipment UE from the 3G network subscriber.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a method and<br>
apparatus for transmitting broadcasting reception information to a mobile<br>
equipment in a digital broadcasting system.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide a method and<br>
system for changing the digital broadcasting reception setting of mobile<br>
equipment according to broadcasting reception information received from an SAS<br>
(Subscription Agent Server).<br>
The above objects are achieved by providing a method and apparatus for<br>
subscribing to a digital broadcasting service using mobile network subscription<br>
information in a system where a 3G mobile communication network interacts<br>
with a DBS.<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention, in a method of<br>
subscribing to a digital broadcasting service using mobile subscription<br>
information associated with a subscription to a mobile communication network and receiving the digital broadcasting service, a subscription request message is<br>
transmitted from the mobile communication network to a DBS, upon request of a<br>
user through mobile equipment. The subscription request message contains<br>
mobile subscription information of the user required for subscription to the digital<br>
broadcasting service. Broadcasting reception information required for the mobile<br>
equipment to receive the digital broadcasting service is received from the DBS.<br>
The broadcasting reception information is set at the mobile equipment so that the<br>
user can receive the digital broadcasting service, and the digital broadcasting<br>
service is received according to the broadcasting reception information at the<br><br>
mobile equipment.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, in a method of<br>
subscribing to a digital broadcasting service using mobile subscription<br>
information associated with subscription to a mobile communication network and<br>
receiving the digital broadcasting service, subscription items required for<br>
subscription to the digital broadcasting service are requested, upon request of a<br>
user through mobile equipment, and received from a DBS. A subscription request<br>
message containing mobile subscription information of the user required for the<br>
subscription to the digital broadcasting service is transmitted to the DBS.<br>
Broadcasting reception information required for the mobile equipment to receive<br>
the digital broadcasting service is received from the DBS. The broadcasting<br>
reception information is set at the mobile equipment so that the user can receive<br>
the digital broadcasting service, and the digital broadcasting service is received<br>
according to the broadcasting reception information at the mobile equipment.<br>
According to a further aspect of the present invention, in a system having<br>
a mobile communication network and a DBS which interact with each other and<br>
have made an Service Provision Agreement (SPA), a first subscription<br>
management server transmits mobile subscription information of a user associated<br>
with the mobile communication network to the DBS, upon request of the user<br>
through mobile equipment which has subscribed to the mobile communication<br>
network and is capable of receiving a digital broadcasting service from the DBS.<br>
A gateway discriminates the mobile subscription information received from the<br>
first subscription management server and transmits the mobile subscription<br>
information to the DBS. A second subscription management server, which is<br>
connected to the first subscription management server through the gateway,<br>
processes the subscription of the user to the digital broadcasting service using the<br>
mobile subscription information and personal information of the user received<br>
from the first subscription management server or the user, and transmits to the<br>
mobile equipment broadcasting reception information required for reception of<br>
the digital broadcasting service.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described herein<br>
below with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following description,<br>
well-known functions or constructions are not described in detail since they<br>
would obscure the invention in unnecessary detail.<br>
Interacting between a 3G mobile communication network and a DBS can<br>
occur over the Internet. The present invention pertains to the configuration and<br>
operation of a system in which a DBS interacts with a WCDMA (Wideband Code<br>
Division Multiple Access) mobile communication network based on 3G<br>
asynchronous mobile communication standards, 3GPP (3rd Generation Project<br>
Partnership).<br>
A description is first made of the configuration and operation of a system<br>
for managing subscriber information and providing Internet service for interacting<br>
with the DBS in the WCDMA system.<br>
FIG. 1 is a block diagram of the WCDMA system and the DBS which<br>
interact with each other according to a preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention. UEs (User Equipments) 11, 13 and 15 are mobile equipments which<br>
subscribe to a 3G mobile communication network 30 and can receive digital<br>
broadcasting. A UTRAN (UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network) 31 is made<br>
up of a plurality of Node Bs 31a and at least one RNC (Radio Network<br>
Controller) 31b, for transmitting data received from the 3G network 30 to the UEs<br>
11, 13 and 15.<br>
The RNC 31b selectively transmits data to a particular cell and controls<br>
radio channels (not shown). The RNC also controls the underlying Node Bs 31a<br>
and each Node B 31a controls cells within its coverage area. The RNC 31b<br>
allocates and manages radio resources to the Node Bs 31a and the Node Bs 31a<br><br>
actually provide the radio resources to the UEs 11, 13 and 15. Because the radio<br>
resources are configured on a cell basis, the radio resources provided by the Node<br>
Bs 31a are said to be those of the respective cells that the Node Bs 31a manage.<br>
The UEs 11, 13 and 15 configure radio channels using radio resources provided<br>
by a particular cell which is under the control of the Node B 31a that the UEs<br>
belong to, and conduct communications.<br>
A CN (Core Network) 33 includes at least one HSS (Home Subscriber<br>
Server) 33a, at least one SGSN (Serving GPRS Supporting Node) 33c, at least<br>
one GGSN (Gateway GPRS Support Node) 33d, and at least one DBS-CSCF 33b.<br>
The HSS 33a manages the mobility of 3G network subscribers, processes<br>
calls, and manages subscriber mobility information and other additional service<br>
information in a database. For call processing, the HSS 33a stores and manages<br>
mobile subscription information including basic information and additional<br>
service information. The basic information includes subscriber phone numbers,<br>
terminal serial numbers, call process routing information (location information),<br>
and subscriber authority and additional service information including information<br>
related to incoming call number display, call forwarding, etc. The HSS 33a is<br>
provided with, or interacts with, an AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and<br>
Accounting) (not shown) server for authenticating 3G network subscribers.<br>
The SGSN 33c controls 3G network-related services for subscribers. The<br>
main functionality of the SGSN 33c is to manage service billing data for each<br>
subscriber and to transmit packet data received from the GGSN 33d to a<br>
particular RNC 31b. The GGSN 33d serves as an entry point of IP (Internet<br>
Protocol) traffic received from an external network in the WCDMA system. That<br>
is, the GGSN 33d functions as an IP router in the WCDMA system.<br>
The DBS-CSCF 33b is a subscription managing server having a digital<br>
broadcasting subscription function in addition to the existing WCDMA CSCF<br>
function. A CSCF is an essential entity to an IM CN(IP Multimedia Core<br>
Network) subsystem added to an existing CN, to allow subscribers to receive IP<br>
network services. The CSCF controls sessions to provide the subscribers with<br>
services of the IM CN. In other words, the CFCN functions similarly to an SIP<br><br>
(Session Initiation Protocol) server. The CSCF also communicates with the HSS<br>
33a. The DBS-CSCF 33b includes all the above-described CSCF functions. For<br>
example, the DBS-CSCF 33b performs a session control so that the UEs 11, 13<br>
and 15 or the DBS-CSCF 33b can exchange information with an SAS 23 within a<br>
DBS 20 over an Internet 40. Additionally, the DBS-CSCF 33b transmits digital<br>
broadcasting subscription requests to the SAS 23 and transmits broadcasting<br>
reception information received from the SAS 23 to the UEs 11,13 and 15.<br>
The DBS 20 includes a DBSG (Digital Broadcast System Gateway) 27,<br>
the SAS 23, a multiplexer (MUX) 25, and a transmitter 21.<br>
The DBSG 27 transmits IP traffic received over the Internet 40<br>
selectively to the SAS 23. More specifically, the DBSG 27 transmits a message<br>
such as a subscription request received from the HSS 33a of the mobile<br>
communication network 30 to the SAS 23 according to the present invention.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the SAS<br>
23 processes the digital broadcasting subscription requests of the UEs 11, 13 and<br>
15 received from the mobile communication network 30 and provides<br>
broadcasting reception information to the UEs 11,13 and 15, to thereby allow the<br>
UEs 11, 13 and 15 to receive the digital broadcasting. The SAS 23 also transmits<br>
digital broadcasting subscription information to the MUX 25 so that the UEs 11,<br>
13 and 15 can receive their requested digital broadcasting only.<br>
The MUX 25 manages digital broadcasting contents in communication<br>
with a digital broadcasting service provider 29 and transmits the digital<br>
broadcasting content to the transmitter 21.<br>
The transmitter 21 is a unidirectional device that transmits the digital<br>
broadcasting content directly to the UE 11.<br>
A procedure for enabling mobile subscribers to subscribe to a digital<br>
broadcasting service through the above-described interacting system according to<br>
preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described.<br><br>
A Service Provision Agreement (SPA) (i.e. an agreement between service<br>
providers such as a 3G network service provider and a digital broadcasting<br>
service provider, to provide a particular service or services) is made between a 3G<br>
network service provider and a digital broadcasting service provider. The service<br>
providers specify required conditions and policies to provide a particular service<br>
to users through interacting between the two heterogeneous systems. In relation to<br>
a subscription service, the SPA can be considered largely in two ways.<br>
(1)	In the case where the SPA specifies subscription items required for<br>
subscription to the digital broadcasting service, if 3G network subscription<br>
information suffices for the digital broadcasting subscription, the DBS-CSCF 33b<br>
requests the subscription to the SAS 23, providing the 3G network subscription<br>
information (see FIG. 2). If user personal information is further needed, the DBS-<br>
CSCF 33b receives associated information from the user of the UE and requests<br>
the subscription to the SAS 23 using the received information (see FIG. 3) or the<br>
user himself additionally requests the subscription to the SAS 23 (see FIG. 4)<br>
(2)	In the case where the subscription items are not specified in the SPA,<br>
the SAS 23 notifies the DBS-CSCF 33b of the subscription items and requests<br>
corresponding information, upon request for a digital broadcasting subscription<br>
from a user. If 3G network subscription information suffices for the digital<br>
broadcasting subscription, the DBS-CSCF 33b requests the subscription to the<br>
SAS 23, providing the 3G network subscription information (see FIG. 5). If user<br>
personal information is further needed, the DBS-CSCF 33b receives associated<br>
information from the user and requests the subscription to the SAS 23 using the<br>
received information (see FIG. 6) or the user himself additionally requests the<br>
subscription to the SAS 23 (see FIG. 7).<br>
FIGs. 2, 3 and 4 illustrate procedures for subscribing to a digital<br>
broadcasting service in the case where the SPA specifies information needed for<br>
digital broadcasting subscription according to preferred embodiments of the<br>
present invention.<br>
FIG. 2 is a flow diagram illustrating a signal flow for a subscription<br>
procedure in the case where a user can subscribe to a digital broadcasting service<br><br>
using the user's mobile communication network subscription information<br>
according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. This figure further<br>
illustrates a subscription procedure when the SPA specifies the items required for<br>
the digital broadcasting subscription and 3G network subscription information<br>
suffices according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The SAS<br>
defines the SPA specifying the items required for digital broadcasting subscription<br>
with the AAA server or HSS (hereinafter, referred to as HSS/AAA) that manages<br>
3G network subscription information in step 100. In step 102, the DBS-CSCF<br>
announces that digital broadcasting is available to a user (through the user's UE)<br>
in the current location according to the SPA. The UE of the user who has not<br>
subscribed to digital broadcasting yet perceives that it can receive the digital<br>
broadcasting where it is now located.<br>
In step 104, the UE requests subscription to the digital broadcasting to the<br>
DBS-CSCF. The DBS-CSCF asks the HSS/AAA for the 3G network subscription<br>
information, that is, mobile subscription information of the user in step 106.<br>
Specifically, the DBS-CSCF requests subscription information corresponding to<br>
the items specified in the SPA to the DBS-CSCF. The HSS/AAA transmits the 3G<br>
network subscription information to the DBS-CSCF in step 108 and the DBS-<br>
CSCF requests the digital broadcasting subscription to the SAS, while<br>
transmitting the 3G network subscription information in IP traffic in step 110. To<br>
do so, the DBS-CSCF opens a session by SIP signaling between the DBS-CSCF<br>
and the SAS, and interaction between the DBS-CSCF and the SAS occurs<br>
through the session.<br>
In step 112, the SAS processes the digital broadcasting subscription using<br>
the 3G network subscription information. At the same time, the SAS provides the<br>
subscription process result to the MUX so that a setting necessary for the UE to<br>
receive the digital broadcasting is performed within the DBS. The SAS transmits<br>
digital broadcasting reception information to the DBS-CSCF in step 114 and the<br>
DBS-CSCF forwards the broadcasting reception information to the UE in order to<br>
notify that the digital broadcasting subscription has been approved in step 116. In<br>
another case, a transmitter of the digital broadcasting system can directly notify<br>
the UE of the digital broadcasting subscription approval (steps 114 and 116). In<br>
step 118, the UE performs a necessary setting according to the broadcasting<br><br>
reception information, including radio channel setup. After the setting is<br>
completed, the user receives the digital broadcasting service in step 120.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates a subscription procedure when the SPA specifies the<br>
items required for the digital broadcasting subscription and user personal<br>
information is needed in addition to 3G network subscription information<br>
according to a second preferred embodiment of the present invention. The SAS<br>
defines the SPA specifying the items required for digital broadcasting subscription<br>
with the HSS/AAA in step 200. In optional step 202, the DBS-CSCF announces<br>
that digital broadcasting is available to the user (through the user's UE) in the<br>
current location according to the SPA. The user, who has not subscribed to digital<br>
broadcasting yet, perceives that the user is now located in a digital broadcasting<br>
service area by the announcement procedure of 3G network. The announcement<br>
step 202 can be omitted.<br>
In step 204, the UE requests subscription to the digital broadcasting to the<br>
DBS-CSCF. The DBS-CSCF asks the HSS/AAA for the 3G network subscription<br>
information of the user in step 206. The HSS/AAA transmits the 3G network<br>
subscription information to the DBS-CSCF in step 208.<br>
Meanwhile, aside from the 3G network subscription information, the<br>
DBS-CSCF requests the user personal information of the user to the UE in<br>
response to the broadcasting subscription request of step 204 in step 210. When<br>
receiving the user personal information from the UE in step 212, the DBS-CSCF<br>
requests the digital broadcasting subscription to the SAS, transmitting the 3G<br>
network subscription information and the user personal information in IP traffic in<br>
step 214. To do so, the DBS-CSCF opens a session by SIP signaling between the<br>
DBS-CSCF and the SAS, and interaction between the DBS-CSCF and the SAS<br>
occurs through the session. The DBS-CSCF is responsible for management of the<br>
session.<br>
In step 216, the SAS processes the digital broadcasting subscription using<br>
the 3G network subscription information. At the same time, the SAS provides the<br>
subscription process result to the MUX so that a setting necessary for the UE to<br>
receive the digital broadcasting is performed within the DBS. The SAS transmits<br><br>
digital broadcasting reception information required for digital broadcasting<br>
reception to the DBS-CSCF in step 218 and the DBS-CSCF forwards the digital<br>
broadcasting reception information to the UE in step 220. In alternative<br>
embodiment, the transmitter can directly notify the UE of digital broadcasting<br>
subscription approval (e.g., see steps 114 and 116 in FIG. 1). In step 222, the UE<br>
performs a necessary setting according to the broadcasting reception information,<br>
including radio channel setup. After the setting is completed, the user's UE<br>
receives the digital broadcasting service in step 224.<br>
FIG. 4 illustrates a subscription procedure when the SPA specifies the<br>
items required for the digital broadcasting subscription and user personal<br>
information is needed in addition to 3G network subscription information<br>
according to a third preferred embodiment of the present invention. The SAS<br>
defines the SPA specifying the items required for digital broadcasting subscription<br>
with the HSS/AAA in step 300. In optional step 302, the DBS-CSCF announces<br>
that digital broadcasting is available to the user in the current location according<br>
to the SPA. The user, who has not subscribed to digital broadcasting yet,<br>
perceives the user is now located in a digital broadcasting service area by the<br>
announcement procedure.<br>
In step 304, the UE requests subscription to the digital broadcasting to the<br>
DBS-CSCF. The DBS-CSCF asks the HSS/AAA for the 3G network subscription<br>
information of the user in step 306. The HSS/AAA transmits the 3G network<br>
subscription information to the DBS-CSCF in step 308. Meanwhile, aside from<br>
the 3G network subscription information, the DBS-CSCF requests the user<br>
personal information of the user to the UE in response to the broadcasting<br>
subscription request of step 304 in step 310.<br>
When the DBS-CSCF receives the 3G network subscription information<br>
of the step 308, the DBS-CSCF requests the digital broadcasting subscription<br>
including the 3G network subscription information to the SAS in step 312. To do<br>
so, the DBS-CSCF opens a session by SIP signaling between the DBS-CSCF and<br>
the SAS, and interaction between the DBS-CSCF and the SAS occurs through the<br>
session. In step 314, the UE requests the digital broadcasting subscription directly<br>
to the SAS in response to the personal information request of step 310,<br><br>
transmitting the user personal information in IP traffic. The direct requesting<br>
means that the subscription request is transmitted to the SAS, transparently<br>
passing the DBS-CSCF. That is, the UE transmits a subscription request message<br>
including the user personal information to the SAS in IP traffic. To do so, a<br>
session is opened between the UE and the SAS by SIP signaling and the UE and<br>
the SAS interact through the session.<br>
In step 316, the SAS processes the digital broadcasting subscription using<br>
the 3G network subscription information and the user personal information. At<br>
the same time, the SAS provides the subscription process result to the MUX so<br>
that a setting necessary for the UE to receive the digital broadcasting is performed<br>
within the DBS. The SAS transmits digital broadcasting reception information<br>
required for digital broadcasting reception directly to the UE to notify approval of<br>
the digital broadcasting subscription in step 318. Similarly, the direct transmission<br>
means that the SAS transmits the broadcasting subscription approval to the UE in<br>
IP traffic, transparently passing the DBS-CSCF. In an alternative embodiment, the<br>
transmitter can directly notify the UE of digital broadcasting subscription<br>
approval of step 318. In step 320, the UE performs a necessary setting according<br>
to the broadcasting reception information, including radio channel setup. After the<br>
setting is completed, the user receives the digital broadcasting service in step 322.<br>
FIGs. 5, 6 and 7 illustrate procedures for subscribing to a digital<br>
broadcasting service in the case where the SPA does not specify items needed for<br>
digital broadcasting subscription according to preferred embodiments of the<br>
present invention.<br>
FIG. 5 illustrates a subscription procedure when 3G network subscription<br>
information suffices for a digital broadcasting subscription under an SPA having<br>
no specifics about items required for the digital broadcasting subscription<br>
according to a fourth preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, the SAS defines the SPA with the HSS/AAA in step<br>
400. In step 402, the DBS-CSCF announces that digital broadcasting is available<br>
to a user in the current location according to the SPA. The UE of the user, who<br>
has not subscribed to digital broadcasting yet, perceives that the user is now<br><br>
located in a digital broadcasting service area by the announcement procedure.<br>
In step 404, the UE requests subscription to the digital broadcasting to the<br>
DBS-CSCF. Because the SPA has no specifics about the items for the digital<br>
broadcasting subscription, the DBS-CSCF asks the SAS for the items in response<br>
to the subscription request from the user in step 406 and the SAS transmits the<br>
items to the DBS-CSCF in step 408. In step 410, the DBS-CSCF asks the<br>
HSS/AAA for the 3G network subscription information of the user. Specifically,<br>
the DBS-CSCF requests subscription information corresponding to the items to<br>
the DBS-CSCF. The HSS/AAA transmits the 3G network subscription<br>
information to the DBS-CSCF in step 412.<br>
The DBS-CSCF requests the digital broadcasting subscription to the SAS,<br>
while transmitting the 3G network subscription information in IP traffic in step<br>
414. To do so, the DBS-CSCF opens a session by SIP signaling between the DBS-<br>
CSCF and the SAS, and interaction between the DBS-CSCF and the SAS occurs<br>
through the session. In step 416, the SAS processes the digital broadcasting<br>
subscription using the 3G network subscription information. At the same time, the<br>
SAS provides the subscription process result to the MUX so that a setting<br>
necessary for the UE to receive the digital broadcasting is performed within the<br>
DBS. The SAS transmits digital broadcasting reception information to the DBS-<br>
CSCF in step 418 in order to notify that the digital broadcasting subscription has<br>
been approved. The DBS-CSCF forwards the broadcasting reception information<br>
to the UE in step 420. In an alternative embodiment, the transmitter can directly<br>
notify the UE of the digital broadcasting subscription approval of steps 418 and<br>
420. In step 422, the UE performs a necessary setting according to the<br>
broadcasting reception information. After the setting is completed, the user<br>
receives the digital broadcasting service in step 424.<br>
FIG. 6 illustrates a subscription procedure when user personal information<br>
is required in addition to 3G network subscription information for digital<br>
broadcasting subscription under an SPA having no specifics about items required<br>
for the digital broadcasting subscription according to a fifth preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br><br>
Referring to FIG. 6, the SAS defines the SPA with the HSS/AAA in step<br>
500. The SPA has no specifics about the items for digital broadcasting<br>
subscription. In step 502, the DBS-CSCF announces that digital broadcasting is<br>
available to a user in the current location according to the SPA. The UE of the<br>
user, who has not subscribed to digital broadcasting yet, perceives that the user is<br>
now located in a digital broadcasting service area by the announcement procedure.<br>
In step 504, the UE requests subscription to the digital broadcasting to the<br>
DBS-CSCF. Because the SPA has no specifics about the items for the digital<br>
broadcasting subscription, the DBS-CSCF asks the SAS for the items in response<br>
to the subscription request from the user in step 506 and the SAS transmits the<br>
items to the DBS-CSCF in step 508. In step 512, the DBS-CSCF asks the<br>
HSS/AAA for the 3G network subscription information of the user. The<br>
HSS/AAA transmits the 3G network subscription information to the DBS-CSCF<br>
in step 514. Meanwhile, aside from the 3G network subscription information, the<br>
DBS-CSCF requests the user personal information of the user to the UE in step<br>
510 and receives the user's personal information from the UE in step 516.<br>
In step 518, the DBS-CSCF requests the digital broadcasting subscription<br>
to the SAS, transmitting the 3G network subscription information and the user<br>
personal information in IP traffic. To do so, the DBS-CSCF opens a session by<br>
SIP signaling between the DBS-CSCF and the SAS, and interaction between the<br>
DBS-CSCF and the SAS occurs through the session. The DBS-CSCF is<br>
responsible for management of the session. In step 520, the SAS processes the<br>
digital broadcasting subscription using the 3G network subscription information<br>
and the user personal information. At the same time, the SAS provides the<br>
subscription process result to the MUX so that a setting necessary for the UE to<br>
receive the digital broadcasting is performed within the DBS.<br>
In step 522, the SAS transmits digital broadcasting reception information<br>
to the DBS-CSCF in order to notify that the digital broadcasting subscription has<br>
been approved. The DBS-CSCF forwards the broadcasting reception information<br>
to the UE in step 524. In an alternative embodiment, the transmitter can directly<br>
notify the UE of the digital broadcasting subscription approval of steps 522 and<br>
524. In step 526, the UE performs a necessary setting according to the<br><br>
broadcasting reception information. After the setting is completed, the user<br>
receives the digital broadcasting service in step 528.<br>
FIG. 7 illustrates a subscription procedure when user personal information<br>
is needed in addition to 3G network subscription information for digital<br>
broadcasting subscription under an SPA having no specifics about items required<br>
for the digital broadcasting subscription according to a sixth preferred<br>
 embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 7, the SAS defines the SPA with the HSS/AAA in step<br>
600. The SPA has no specifics about the items for digital broadcasting<br>
subscription. In step 602, the DBS-CSCF announces that digital broadcasting is<br>
available to a user in the current location according to the SPA. The UE of the<br>
user who has not subscribed to digital broadcasting yet perceives that it can<br>
receive the digital broadcasting where it is now located.<br>
In step 604, the UE requests subscription to the digital broadcasting to the<br>
DBS-CSCF. Because the SPA has no specifics about the items for the digital<br>
broadcasting subscription, the DBS-CSCF asks the SAS for the items in response<br>
to the subscription request from the user in step 606 and the SAS transmits the<br>
items to the DBS-CSCF in step 608.<br>
Meanwhile, in step 610, the DBS-CSCF asks the HSS/AAA for the 3G<br>
network subscription information of the user. The HSS/AAA transmits the 3G<br>
network subscription information to the DBS-CSCF in step 612. Aside from the<br>
3G network subscription information, the DBS-CSCF requests the user personal<br>
information of the user to the UE in step 614.<br>
In step 616, the DBS-CSCF requests the digital broadcasting subscription<br>
to the SAS, while transmitting the 3G network subscription information in IP<br>
traffic. To do so, the DBS-CSCF opens a session by SIP signaling between the<br>
DBS-CSCF and the SAS, and interaction between the DBS-CSCF and the SAS<br>
occurs through the session. In step 618, the UE requests the digital broadcasting<br>
subscription directly to the SAS, transmitting the user personal information<br>
requested in step 614 in IP traffic. To do so, a session is opened between the UE<br><br>
and the SAS, which interact with each other through the session. As described<br>
above, the digital broadcasting subscription is requested in step 616 and 618.<br>
In step 620, the SAS processes the digital broadcasting subscription using<br>
the 3G network subscription information and the user personal information. At<br>
the same time, the SAS provides the subscription process result to the MUX so<br>
that a setting necessary for the UE to receive the digital broadcasting is performed<br>
within the DBS. In step 622, the SAS transmits digital broadcasting reception<br>
information to the UE, notifying of approval of the digital broadcasting<br>
subscription. The SAS transmits the digital broadcasting subscription approval in<br>
IP traffic to the UE, transparently passing the DBS-CSCF, or a transmitter of the<br>
digital broadcasting system transmits it directly to the UE. In step 624, the UE<br>
performs a necessary setting according to the broadcasting reception information.<br>
After the setting is completed, the user receives the digital broadcasting service in<br>
step 626.<br>
FIG. 8 illustrates the format of the 3G network subscription information<br>
that the DBS-CSCF transmits to the SAS according to a preferred embodiment of<br>
the present invention. The 3G network subscription information is made up of a<br>
subscriber number, a terminal number, subscriber registration information<br>
representing the current subscription status such as normal/theft/arrear, etc. In the<br>
WCDMA system, the subscriber number corresponds to an IMSI (International<br>
Mobile Subscriber Identity), the terminal number corresponds to an IMEI<br>
(International Mobile Equipment Identity), and the subscriber registration<br>
information corresponds to an EIR (Equipment Identity Register).<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the digital<br>
broadcasting reception information that the SAS transmits to the UE includes<br>
information about channels serving the digital broadcasting and key values by<br>
which to scramble corresponding information. Also, the user personal information<br>
includes information about a broadcasting service type, favorite channels, and a<br>
user ID &amp; a password for reception of the digital broadcasting. The broadcasting<br>
service type indicates which broadcasting service the user is to receive, for<br>
example, whether the user is to receive a basic broadcasting service or selected<br>
broadcasting contents. The user personal information may further include a QoS<br><br>
(Quality of Service) field indicating a requested QoS for the broadcasting service.<br>
FIG. 9 is a block diagram of a UE for receiving digital broadcasting over<br>
a 3G network according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. An<br>
RF (Radio Frequency) module 704 converts an RF signal received from an<br>
antenna 702 to a predetermined signal under the control of a controller 708. The<br>
signal output from the RF module 704 includes a pilot signal, and a paging signal<br>
or data for 3G data communication or a power control message from a Node B.<br>
The controller 708 transmits data for a call setup or power control, and<br>
transmission data to the RF module 704, for transmission to the Node B. Also, the<br>
controller 708 provides overall control to the UE. According to the present<br>
invention, the controller 708 interprets digital broadcasting reception information<br>
received from the SAS and controls a digital broadcasting receiver 718 to perform<br>
a broadcasting reception setting.<br>
The digital broadcasting receiver 718 receives a radio digital broadcasting<br>
signal through an antenna 716 according to control of the controller 708. The<br>
radio digital broadcasting signal is a digital multimedia signal in which a video<br>
signal, an audio signal, and a text signal are multiplexed. Also, the digital<br>
broadcasting signal includes a digital multimedia data stream broadcasting signal<br>
a VOD (Video On Demand) signal or an MOD (Music On Demand) signal. The<br>
digital broadcasting processor 720 analyzes the received signal and processes it so<br>
that the user can receive an associated service.<br>
A 3G signal processor 712 processes a 3G network signal received from<br>
the controller 708 so that the user can receive a 3G network service. The 3G<br>
signal processor 712 also converts a signal including video, audio and text signals<br>
received over a 3G network into an appropriate form outputs the signal to a<br>
service provider 714 which displays the signals received from the digital<br>
broadcasting processor 720 and the 3G signal processor 712 on a screen (not<br>
shown) and/or outputs the received signals through a speaker (not shown).<br>
A keypad 706 is configured in a key matrix structure. It has<br>
alphanumerical keys for dialing and function keys for invoking functions. The<br><br>
keypad 706 generates a key signal corresponding to a pressed key to the controller.<br>
The user enters user personal information needed for reception of the digital<br>
broadcasting service through the keypad 706, for transmission to the SAS. Also,<br>
the keypad 706 may be provided with an additional short key for broadcasting<br>
service reception, when needed. Moreover, the keypad can further include a touch<br>
pad or a virtual keyboard.<br>
As described above, the present invention provides a method of<br>
simplifying a subscription procedure for digital broadcasting using 3G network<br>
subscription information. Therefore, the user is relieved of providing his user<br>
personal information to receive a digital broadcasting service and can easily<br>
subscribe to the digital broadcasting service in real time/on line, to thereby<br>
receive the digital broadcasting service conveniently. Also, 3G network service<br>
providers can yield additional benefits by a 3G network upload function to users,<br>
and digital broadcasting service providers take advantage of additional<br>
opportunities to provide the digital broadcasting service to the users.<br>
While the invention has been shown and described with reference to<br>
certain preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in<br>
