				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process useful for the purification of ropinirole or its<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In order to secure marketing approval for a new drug product, a drug manufacturer must submit<br>
detailed evidence to the appropriate regulatory authority to show that the product is suitable for<br>
release on to the market. The regulatory authority must be satisfied, inter alia, that the active<br>
agent is acceptable for administration to humans and that the particular formulation, which is to<br>
be marketed, is free from impurities at the time of release.<br>
Potential impurities in pharmaceutically active agents and formulations containing them include<br>
residual amounts of synthetic precursors to the active agent, by-products which arise during<br>
synthesis of the active agent, residual solvent, isomers of the active agent, contaminants which<br>
were present in materials used in the synthesis of the active agent or in the preparation of the<br>
pharmaceutical formulation, and unidentified adventitious substances. Other impurities which<br>
may appear on storage include substances resulting from degradation of the active agent, for<br>
instance by oxidation or hydrolysis.<br>
Ropinirole hydrochloride, i.e., 4-[2-(dipropylamino)ethyl]-l,3-dihydro-2H-indol-2-one<br>
hydrochloride having the formula (I)<br>
is used in the treatment of the signs and symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson"s disease.<br>
Parkinson"s disease is a debilitating disease characterized by disturbance of voluntary<br>
movement in which muscles become stiff and sluggish, movement becomes clumsy and<br>
difficult, and uncontrollable rhythmic twitching of groups of muscles produces<br>
characteristic shaking or tremor. The condition is believed to be caused by the<br>
degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the nigral striatal system of the brain, leading to<br>
inadequate release of the neurotransmitter dopamine.<br>
Administration of conventional anti-parkinsonian drugs like L-DOPA and ergot alkaloids<br>
relieves certain symptoms of the disease, but are associated with several undesirable side-<br>
effects like dyskinesia, psychiatric problems, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal<br>
distension. Furthermore, the conventional drugs fail to halt the disease progression.<br>
Ropinirole, an indolone derivative, alleviates this deficiency, and has particularly<br>
minimum liability to cause dyskinesia. Furthermore, it has additional beneficial effects on<br>
the central nervous system, namely anti-depressant and anxiolytic effects, which are<br>
considered to be particularly advantageous, considering that patients requiring current<br>
therapies often need to take separate anti-depressant medication. Presence of such<br>
qualities in a single compound obviates the need for separate therapy. Ropinirole is<br>
believed to act by stimulation of post-synaptic dopamine D2-type receptors within the<br>
caudate putamen of the brain, leading to an increase in the activity of the neurotransmitter<br>
dopamine.<br>
Various procedures are known for the synthesis of ropinirole and its pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts, including hydrochloride in the prior art. However, the literature<br>
processes have limitations due to the reaction sequence and the formation of by-<br>
products/impurities associated with them. (Hayler, J. D., Howie, S. L. B., Giles, R. G.,<br>
Negus, A., Oxley, P. W., Walsgrove, T. C, and Whiter, M., Org. Pro. Res. Dev., Vol 2,<br>
1998, pages 3-9). By-product formation has been found even at a level of 40%."<br>
Based on our experience, during the synthesis of Ropinirole hydrochloride, a number of<br>
impurities are formed, of which 4- (2- (di-propyl amino) ethyl) isatin hydrochloride<br>
having the formula (II),<br>
is the most significant single impurity. The impurities, which are formed during the<br>
synthesis of ropinirole hydrochloride including the contaminants of the reagents, get<br>
carried over till the final step of preparation of ropinirole hydrochloride. In order to get<br>
the highly pure Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) of ropinirole, the purification<br>
step is very essential. The crude ropinirole has impurities in the level of 0.5 to 0.6 % as<br>
single impurity and 1 % as total impurity. The purification by various solvents does not<br>
effectively lead to the purified ropinirole to have single impurity content below 0.1%.<br>
Coufal, P. , Stuli, K. , Claessens, H. A. , Hardy, M. J. , Webb, M., J. Chromatog., B:<br>
Biomedical Sciences and Applications, Vol. 732 (2), 1999, pages 437-444 describes a<br>
capillary liquid chromatographic method for the separation and quantification of<br>
ropinirole and its related impurities.<br>
The separation and quantification of the single impurity requires complex analytical<br>
methods, which are expensive and can be carried out only on a very small scale. Prior art<br>
do not discloses any efficient chemical process for the purification of ropinirole<br>
hydrochloride, wherein the single impurity is below 0.1% and total impurity is below<br>
0.5%.<br>
EP0300614A1, US 4997954, EP113964 describe different processes for preparing<br>
ropinirole and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, which reduce the number of steps<br>
involved in the process, improving yields, or getting a commercially advantageous<br>
process. However none of these describes the process for removing Isatine impurity in<br>
the final product.<br>
US4997954 describes process for preparing ropinirole wherein 2-phenyl ethanol(III)<br>
(commercially available) was reacted with phosphorous trichloride and paraformaldehyde<br>
to give the corresponding isochroman (IV). The isochroman (IV) on reaction with<br>
bromine gave the corresponding 2- (2"-bromoethyl) benzaldehyde (V) which on reaction<br>
with nitromethane in the presence of sodium methoxide, gave2-(2"bromoethyl)<br>
betxnitrostyrene (VI).2- (2" bromoethyl) betmitrostyrene (VI) on reaction with acetyl<br>
chloride and ferric-chloride gave 4-2"-bromoethyl)-3-chloro-l, 3-dihydro-2H-indole-2-<br>
one (VII). 4-(2"-bromoethyl)-3-chloro-l, 3-dihydro- 2H-indole-2-one(VII) was<br>
dehydrohalogenated in presence of Palladium on carbon and sodium hypophosphite to<br>
give4- (2"-bromoethyl)-l, 3-dihydro-2H-indole-2-one (VIII), which on further reaction<br>
with di-n-propyl amine in presence of aqueous acetonitrile and nitrogen gave ropinirole<br>
hydrochloride (I). The sequence of the synthetic steps followed is shown in Scheme 1<br>
During this reaction sequence, along with other impurity formation, especially oxidative<br>
impurities, possibly the oxidation of indole-2-one moiety to give diketoindole take place<br>
to give rise to the process impurity, as shown in Scheme-2<br>
We have further observed that the level of the diketoindole impurity in the API, as well<br>
as pharmaceutical compositions containing the API increases upon storage over extended<br>
periods irrespective of the pharmaceutical dosage form. Therefore, high initial levels of<br>
the diketoindole impurity in the API prepared by prior art processes, can further lead to<br>
increase the impurity content over a prolonged period of time.<br>
However, none of process disclosed above in the prior art address the problem of amount<br>
of impurity level in the final product.<br>
Thus, there exists a need for a process of preparing ropinirole and its pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts, which provides a purification procedure for ropinirole, which is cost-<br>
efficient, ecofriendly, less labour intensive, less time consuming as well as can be carried<br>
out on an industrial scale so that the content of the diketoindole impurity can be kept<br>
within acceptable levels.<br>
Present inventors have surprisingly found the simple and cost effective and industrially<br>
applicable process for purifying ropinirole.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a practicable, economic process for purifying ropinirole<br>
hydrochloride on an industrial scale. We have now found an improved process for purifying<br>
ropinirole hydrochloride.<br>
The principle underlying the process for purification of the crude API (Active Pharmaceutical<br>
Ingredient), ropinirole hydrochloride, is the reaction of the crude API with a reagent, which can<br>
easily form a water-soluble compound of that impurity and can get washed away with water<br>
during the work-up. Thus, the impurities react and form a complex with said reagent and gets<br>
eliminated. Further work up gives the purified ropinirole, wherein the purity is found to be less<br>
than 0.1% for single impurity, 4-(2-(dipropylamino)ethyl) isatin hydrochloride of formula (II).<br>
The process of purification of ropinirole hydrochloride comprises the steps of:<br>

As ropinirole hydrochloride is a highly potent drug and is used in doses of 0.25-5 mg, content<br>
uniformity of the drug in a dosage form is very critical to achieve a consistent dosage regimen.<br>
Generally this can be achieved by reducing the particle size using conventional milling<br>
equipment. Particle size reduction by conventional milling procedures and uniform particle size<br>
distribution are essential for achieving content uniformity of the drug in a dosage form. It has<br>
been surprisingly found that the process of the instant invention yields crystals of ropinirole<br>
hydrochloride having a small particle size as well as uniform size distribution, thereby avoiding<br>
the need for costly milling equipment and simultaneously reduces the number of process steps to<br>
achieve the same.<br>
Accordingly, the invention is directed in one embodiment to crystals of ropinirole hydrochloride<br>
with a particle size of below 95 microns not less than 80 %.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the invention is directed to crystals of ropinirole hydrochloride with<br>
a particle size of below 75 microns not less than 80 %.<br>
Pharmaceutical Compositions:<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise as active ingredient<br>
ropinirole hydrochloride containing less than 0.1 % of single impurity and having a particle size<br>
of below 75 microns not less than 80%, in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
diluent, carrier or excipient.<br>
14<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be administered in any suitable way and<br>
in any suitable form, for example orally in the form of tablets, capsules, powders or syrups, or<br>
parenterally in the form of usual sterile solutions for injection.<br>
The pharmaceutical formulations of the invention may be prepared by conventional methods in<br>
the art. For example, tablets may be prepared by mixing the active ingredient with ordinary<br>
adjuvants and/or diluents and subsequently compressing the mixture in a conventional tabletting<br>
machine. Examples of adjuvants or diluents comprise: Corn starch, potato starch, talcum,<br>
magnesium stearate, gelatin, lactose, gums, and the like. Any other adjuvant or additive,<br>
colourings, aroma, preservatives etc. may be used provided that they are compatible with the<br>
active ingredients.<br>
Solutions for injections may be prepared by dissolving the active ingredient and possible<br>
additives in a part of the solvent for injection, preferably sterile water, adjusting the solution to<br>
the desired volume, sterilising the solution and filling it in suitable ampoules or vials. Any<br>
suitable additive conventionally used in the art may be added, such as tonicity agents,<br>
preservatives, antioxidants, etc.<br>

PREPARATORY EXAMPLES:<br>
Example -1<br>
Preparation of Isochroman (IV)<br>
Phosphrous trichloride (185 gm, 1.34 mole) was added to a reaction mass of 2-phenyl ethanol<br>
(III) (500 gm, 4.09 mole), paraformaldehyde (135 gm) and hydrochloric acid, over a one hr<br>
period at 25-30°C. The mix was stirred for 3 hr at 35-40°C. Adjust pH 7 using NaOH solution<br>
below 25°C and extracted with ethyl acetate and the aqueous layer was separated. The extraction<br>
was repeated twice. The resultant three extracts were combined, dried over sodium sulphate, and<br>
then concentrated to give 520.0 gm of clear pale yellow oil of isochroman (IV) (Yield : 94.69%).<br>
Example - 2<br>
Preparation of 2-(2"-bromoethyl) benzaldehyde (V)<br>
Bromine (592 gm, 3.675 mole) in dichloromethane (400 ml) was added to isochroman (IV) (500<br>
gm, 3.731 mole) in dichloromethane (3000 ml) over 2 hr in the presence of a strong light source<br>
at such a rate that the reaction temperature remains about 38°C. The mixture was stirred for<br>
further 2 hr in the presence of light source, keeping the temperature of the mixture below 40?C.<br>
16<br>
The mixture was concentrated at atmosphere pressure to give heavy oil. This was then stirred at<br>
80?Gbrlrr. Thecmdeproductwasdissolvedindchloromethane(300Cml)ardwashedwith<br>
water (1500 ml). Washed the organic layer with saturated sodium bicarbonate (4400 ml). This<br>
layer was again washed with water and then dried over sodium sulphate. Excess solvent was<br>
removed under reduced pressure to given a heavy oil of 2-(2"-bromoethyl) benzaldehyde (V)<br>
(650.0 gm) (Yield : 84.80%).<br>
Purification of 2-(2"-bromoethyl) benzaldehyde (V)<br>
Sodium metabisulphite (500 gm) was dissolved in water (500 ml) and to this was added<br>
methanol (500 ml). To it, the benzaldehyde (V) was added and stirred for 30 minutes after<br>
which dichloromethane (1500 ml) was added. The resulting suspension was filtered to give a<br>
white powder. To sodium carbonate solution (270 gm) in water (4400 ml), the white powder was<br>
added and to this mixture, dichloromethane (1500 ml) was further added. After shaking the<br>
organic layer, the aqueous layer was separated. The extractions were repeated twice. The<br>
