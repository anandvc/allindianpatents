STRIP EJECTION CLOSURE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention is directed to a low cost molded closure or cap, and to methods and apparatus for producing the same. The invention is also directed to a molded closure or cap that is designed to be strip-ejected from the core of a mold.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
There has been a need for low cost containers and container components. Closure and cap components for containers may be manufactured by various processes, e.g., by thermoforming, or by compression (by itself or by (or with) overmolding) or injection molding (by itself or with overmolding). Many such components are made by injection molding processes which involve the injection of molten polymeric material under high pressure into a mold cavity having the shape of the closure or cap (hereafter, collectively referred to as "cap") that is to be formed. The injection molding apparatus includes a cavity that is formed between male tooling, often referred to as the core, that has one or more grooves extending radially inwardly into its surface to form one or more threads on the interior surface of the cap, and female tooling that forms the exterior surface of the cap. While the formed cap is on the core, it is allowed to cool. After the female tooling is pulled away from the cap, the cap is removed from the core. There have been basically three methods for removing the formed cap from mold tooling. Two methods are preferred since they remove the cap with relatively the least damage to its threads. Either the threaded cap is unscrewed from the threaded tooling or vice versa, or the core with the thread groove therein is radially collapsed to remove the groove from the thread of the cap and an axially moving stripper, e. g., a stripper ring, engages the lower rim of the cooled cap and<br><br>
strips the cap from the collapsed core. These methods prevent the threads on the interior of the caps from being weakened, damaged or deformed during removal of the caps from the tooling. In the third method, a stripper, which can be a knock out pin that comes up through an uncollapsed core, engages the top wall of the cap and strips it axially from the' core. This can also be done by use of a stripper ring that pushes up on the bottom surface of the cap. Since the core is not collapsed, the thread of the cap is smeared and/or distorted when the thread engages the groove as the cap is axially stripped from the core. Weakened, damaged or deformed threads are acceptable for some non- or less-demanding applications but such threads are generally undesirable because they can significantly negatively affect the torque that can be applied while screwing the cap onto a container, and/or the ability of the cap to initially or repeatedly properly seal the container.<br>
It would be desirable to provide an improved cap.  It would also be desirable to provide a low cost cap, as well as improved methods and apparatus for producing improved or low cost caps.<br>
It therefore is an object of this invention to provide an improved cap.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a low cost cap.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a low cost cap that is produced with less material.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a cap that can be manufactured of, for example, from about 30% to about 40% less material than would a conventional cap of the same size.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a cap that is designed to be axially removed or stripped from a core, e. g., a non-collapsed core, having a thread or other forming groove therein, without significant smearing or distortion of the thread.<br><br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide a cap that has thin flex areas that allow a threaded skirt of the cap to flex, distort or expand radially outwardly to avoid significant smearing or distortion of the thread when the cap is axially removed from male tooling of a cap-forming mold.<br>
Still another object of the invention is to provide improved methods and apparatus for forming a cap.<br>
Still another object of the invention is to provide improved methods and apparatus for forming an aforementioned desired cap.<br>
Still another object of the invention is to provide methods and apparatus that allow an aforementioned desired cap to be manufactured in less time.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention is directed to a plastic cap, comprising a top portion, an annular skirt that depends from the top portion and has an interior surface, means for securing the cap to the neck of a container, and substantially weak areas provided in the cap to allow the skirt to expand circumferentially radially outward when the interior surface of the skirt is subjected to a radially outwardly directed force, for example, when the cap is being strip ejected from mold tooling.<br>
The invention is also directed to a cap comprised of thermoplastic material and having an interior surface and an exterior surface, comprising a top portion, an annular skirt that depends from the top portion, the skirt having an interior surface that has a radially inwardly extending thread, and a plurality of flex areas that are less thick than the average thickness of the cap, and that increase the ability of the skirt to expand radially outward such that the cap can be strip-ejected from a mold core having an exterior surface with a thread-forming groove therein, with reduced smearing or distortion of the thread of the skirt by the groove of the core than if the cap<br><br>
did not have the weak areas. Preferably, the flex areas are the thinnest areas of the cap, or they are substantially less thick than the minimum thickness of the rest of the cap excluding the thread. The flex areas preferably are from about 12 to about 4 or more times thinner than the thickness of the cap excluding the thread. The flex areas can be flex panels and can be located in the inner and/or outer surface of the top portion of the cap, in the skirt, and/or in or through the joint between the top portion and skirt. The skirt can include a lower rim, and the flex areas can comprise a plurality of circumferentially spaced panels, each continuous from the top portion of the cap or from the top of the skirt or side wall to the lower rim of the cap. The flex areas or flex panels can be narrow and elongated in the skirt and can extend in a direction substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the cap. The widths of the flex panels can taper inwardly as they extend toward the top portion of the cap.<br>
The thread of the cap preferably is formed of segments that are circumferentially staggered from one another. Preferably, no thread segment overlies or underlies another thread segment. The thread segments can have full portions and lead-in and lead-out portions, wherein no full portion of a segment axially overlaps an overlying or underlying full portion of a thread segment. The flex areas can be spaced equally from each other about the cap, and they can be substantially less thick than the average thickness of the cap. The flex panels can be located between the thread segments, and they can be thinner than the average vertical cross sectional thickness of the skirt, or thinner than the average vertical cross sectional thickness of the skirt measured in the non-threaded portions of the skirt.<br>
The skirt can have portions of a first thickness, and flex areas of a second thickness that are thinner than said first portions, for allowing the skirt to stretch mainly in the flex areas and thereby increase the ability of the skirt to expand radially outward more when the skirt is subjected to an internal radially outwardly directed force than if the same force were applied to said skirt without the flex areas.<br><br>
The invention is also directed to a method of molding a strip ejectable plastic cap, which comprises molding a cap in a tool set having a mold cavity formed by female tooling for forming the exterior surface of the cap and by a core for forming the interior surface of the cap," such that the cap will have an exterior surface, an interior surface, a top wall, and a depending annular skirt having a thread and that is in communication with the top wall, providing radially outwardly extending members on the outer surface of the core to form radially inwardly extending weakened areas in the interior surface of the cap, the members extending radially outwardly sufficiently such that the weakened areas are thinner than the average thickness of the cap, to allow the skirt to expand radially outward and thereby allow the cap to be strip-ejected from the mold tooling with reduced smearing of the thread.<br>

Fig. 10 is a front elevation, with portions in vertical section through a portion of a closed tool set of an injection molding apparatus having an empty mold cavity for forming a cap of the invention.<br>
Fig. 11 is a vertical section of the injection molding apparatus of Fig. 10 shown with the tool set open, and it is cross section of the cavity in front elevation.<br>
The skirt of the cap has spaced axial thin portions that allow the cap to distort, flex or expand radially outwardly as the cap is stripped axially, rather than unscrewed, from the core of a mold cavity. The thread preferably is segmented, i.e., discontinuous. The segments of the thread, other than the initial lead-in and terminal lead-out portions, are circumferentially staggered from one another. None of the segments of the thread (other than the aforementioned lead-in and lead-out portions) axially directly underlie another segment of the thread. This allows minimal smearing or distortion of the thread.<br>
The closure or cap (hereafter "cap") is a low cost cap. It uses significantly less material, often from about 30% to about 40% less material, to form the cap as compared to a conventional cap of similar size. Because of the reduced material employed, molding, cooling and stripping time are reduced.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF PREFERED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Fig. 1 shows a preferred cap 10 of the invention. Although the cap shown is for a 1" diameter tubular collapsible dispensing container, the cap of the invention is not limited to any particular sized or type of container. Cap 10 has a top wall, top panel or top portion 11, an outer axial wall or skirt 12 with a top brim or ridge 13 and thin, preferably substantially aligned circumferentially spaced flex areas, here, generally designated 14. The flex areas are thinner than the less-flex thicker areas of the skirt. Whereas the wall thickness of the skirt of a conventional cap of the same size for a<br><br>
1" diameter tube is about 0.035" thick from the outer surface to the non-threaded portion of the inner surface of the skirt, the thickness of cap 10 is about 0.025" thick, measured in the same area through the skirt. The thickness of the thin flex area for cap 10 is about 0.009". The width of each flex area is about 0.050". It is to be understood that these thicknesses are preferred for a cap 10 having the dimensions disclosed herein for a one inch diameter tube having a neck whose diameter is 0.5 inch. Thus, if desired, one skilled in the art can adapt these dimensions and thicknesses to suit the packaging application.<br>
It is contemplated to be within the scope of this invention that the flex areas can have ribs axially circumferentially or angularly therein, thereon or thereacross. Also, one or more of the flex areas themselves can have weakened areas relative to the flex area or areas, for example, holes or gaps, with or without webs, areas of reduced thickness, or portions with pores or filled with particulate material to further weaken portions of the flex area(s) or panel(s).<br>
There can be any suitable number of flex areas. Preferably, there are two or more. The more there are, the thicker they can be. However, generally, the more there are, the less thread circumferential length there will be. Preferably, the flex areas are spaced uniformly or equally from each other about the circumference of the cap. This allows the cap to be circumferentially axially balanced and provides uniform torque relative to rotation of the cap about the threads of, for example, the neck of a container. Each of the flex areas need not be of the same thickness.<br>
Each flex area need not be of the same design or configuration, so long as the purpose of the invention is met. Thus, each, any or all of the flex areas can be of any suitable size, shape, design or configuration. For example, they can be rectangular, trapezoidal, conical, frustoconical, circular, oblong, spiral, helical, or any combination of the same. Though less preferred, there may be certain applications where it may be desirable that the flex areas encompass, lead or follow one or more of the thread<br><br>
segments. As shown, preferably the flex areas are rectangular, though they preferably may also be slightly frustoconical or tapered (to be wider at their lower ends). Preferably, the flex areas are axially arranged.<br>
The flex areas can be of any suitable height or length. Preferably, the flex areas are of uniform height and extend the full height or length of the skirt of the cap. As explained below, one or more of the flex areas of the skirt can extend into a portion of or diametrically across the top wall of the cap.<br>
Consistent with a main objective of the invention, the one or more flex areas can be at any suitable location(s) of the cap. For example, the one or more flex areas of the cap can be located only in the top wall of the cap or only at the joint of the top wall and skirt of the cap. If the flex areas are located in the top wall of the cap, preferably they extend to the joint of the top wall and more preferably into the skirt of the cap. For example, as shown in Figs. 9E-9H, the top wall 11' can have flex areas 14' that preferably are arranged in a starburst pattern in top wall 11", and that extend to the upper brim or ridge 13' of skirt 12'.<br>
The entire area of the top wall can be of reduced thickness and can be considered a flex area within the scope of the invention to allow the skirt to flex radially outward to facilitate stripping of the side wall of the cap without distortion or smearing of the cap.<br>
Fig. 2 is a top view of the cap of Fig. 1. Fig. 2 shows that cap 10 has a top wall 11.<br>
Fig. 3 is a bottom view of the cap of Fig. 1. Skirt 12 has an outer surface 16 and an inner surface 18.<br>
Fig. 4 is a vertical section through a segment 20 of a thread 22. The thread preferably but need not be a buttress thread. The thread preferably<br><br>
is sufficiently long enough to support itself during the strip ejection process. Its thickness preferably is about 0.015".<br>
Fig. 5 shows a segment 20 of thread 22.<br>
Figs. 6 and 7 show staggered thread segments 20 that straddle flex areas 14. These Figures also show lead-out portion 24 of a segment 20 overlying lead-in portion 26 of a lower segment 20. Since the lead-in and lead-out portions are tapered radially outward (progressively thinner) toward the inner surface of the skirt, they do not pose an interference or stripping problem.<br>
Figs. 8 and 9 are perspective views of cap 10. Fig. 9 shows that flex areas 14 are located between thread segments 20, and that the flex areas preferably extend to the bottom edge or rim 17 of the skirt.<br>
Figs. 9A through 9D show a second embodiment of the cap of the invention, generally designated 10* having flex panels 14' extending from outer surface 16' of skirt 12' radially into the wall of skirt 12' of cap 10'. Flex panels 14' extend from the top edge or rim 13' to the bottom edge 17' of the skirt. The flex panels are substantially parallel to the axis of cap 10' and are spaced equally about the circumference of the cap.<br>
Figs. 9E through 9H show a third embodiment of the cap of the invention, generally designated 10". Cap 10" is similar to cap 10' except that cap 10" has a plurality of flex panels that extend downwardly into and are arranged in a starburst or radial pattern in top wall 11". Flex panels 14' are shown interrupted by a central portion 15' that is of the normal thickness of top panel 11". Although, flex panels 14' could, in these Figures they do not enter rim 13' of side wall or skirt 12\ nor do they join flex panels 14'. Providing one or more flex panels downwardly into the upper, outer surface of top portion 11" as shown in Figs. 9E through 9H, or upwardly into the inner surface thereof, helps to meet the objectives of the invention<br><br>
because it weakens the hoop strength of the side wall or skirt. Flex panels 14' can extend into one another by eliminating central portion 15.<br>
Figs. 91 through 9L show a fourth embodiment of the cap of the invention, generally designated 10'".   Cap 10'" does not have a top rim such that top panel 11"' directly joins skirt 12"\ In this embodiment, flex panels 14'" in top wall 11"' and skirt 12"' adjoin each other and form one continuous flex panel. This flex panel arrangement enables the opposed portions of cap 10'" on either side of the flex panels to be moved away from each other in a hinging fashion from the area adjacent top panel 11'", to facilitate strip ejection of the cap from a core of mold tooling.<br>
Figs. 9M through 90 show a fifth embodiment of the cap of the invention, here generally designated 100. This embodiment shows that flex panels 14' can be advantageously employed with continuous flex panel 14'", the former allowing the skirt to expand circumferentially radially outwardly, and the latter enabling the skirt to hinge adjacent top panel 11'", and thereby cooperatively allowing or facilitating strip ejection of cap 100 from the core of mold tooling.<br>
Figs. 9P through 9S show a sixth embodiment of the cap of the invention, generally designated 100'. Cap 100' has flex panels 114 extending from an outer peripheral portion of top panel 111 through joint 117 and downwardly into the outer surface of the upper portion of skirt 112. This configuration of flex panels arranged circumferentially about the joint of the top wall and skirt creates pivot points which allow the skirt to move outwardly to facilitate strip ejection. Flex panels 114 can be of any suitable length in the top wall and skirt. For example, they may be configured as merely a plurality of circumferentially spaced notches (not shown) formed in the joint 117 between the top panel 111 and skirt 112. Thus, the embodiments of Figs. 9A through 9S show that the flex panels can be of any suitable size, configuration and location that meets the objective of the invention, that of reducing the hoop strength of the side wall or skirt to facilitate strip ejection of the cap.<br></td>
