CASE STRUCTURE FOR ELECTRONIC DEVICE<br>
PRIORITY CLAIM<br>
Priority is claimed on Japanese Patent Application No. 2004-138248, filed May<br>
7,2004, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to a case structure for an electronic device. For<br>
example, this invention relates to a case structure that is appropriate for an<br>
electronic device such as a camera, a portable telephone, and an 1C recorder, or<br>
an electronic device such as a remote control for consumer electronic products<br>
such as a television set, a video recorder, an air conditioner, and a projector.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
A covering member for an electronic device such as a camera, a portable<br>
telephone, and an 1C recorder, or an electronic device such as a remote control for<br>
consumer electronic products such as a television set, a video recorder, an air conditioner,<br>
and a projector constitutes a casing that contains built-in electronic parts or optical parts,<br>
and contributes to the design for outer appearance of these devices.<br>
Conventionally, these covering members are made up of a relatively thin plate<br>
member, a shell member, or the like, as for the shape hi order to reduce the size and the<br>
weight of the devices, and are generally produced of the materials such as synthetic resin<br>
or light metal, which are suitable for mass production.<br>
On the other hand, materials such as synthetic resin or light metal have a<br>
disadvantage in that they are difficult to hold comfortably in the hand, due to lack of<br>
hygroscopicity. Accordingly, a proposal has been made that as a covering material,<br>
natural materials such as wood or bamboo be used which tend to be comfortable in the<br>
hand and are endowed with excellent hygroscopicity and delicate features which provide<br>
good sensation.<br>
Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2004-64021 (pages 2-4,<br>
and Figure 1) discloses a component material for constructing a casing for<br>
electronic devices which is formed of a wooden material, and whose surface is<br>
carbonized. The Publication also discloses a camera covered by a front cover<br>
and a rear cover using a wooden material, both being a thin shell type, where a<br>
circuit unit and an imaging unit are attached to a chassis. The front cover and<br>
the rear cover are connected together and secured to the chassis.<br>
However, the case structure for electronic device having a wooden covering<br>
member described above in the prior art has the following problems:<br>
For example, an electronic device such as a camera, a portable telephone,<br>
and an 1C recorder, or a remote control for consumer electronic products such as<br>
a television set, a video recorder, an air conditioner, and a projector, are portable<br>
devices that are operated in hand, and are consequently subject to external force<br>
from outside the covering member when being carried or operated. Thus hi a<br>
conventional case structure, external force causes considerable deformation,<br>
cracks, and damage.<br>
Accordingly, there is a strong demand for a case structure that is not<br>
easily damaged, even when a wood being fragile to the deformation by external<br>
force is used in the covering member.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
The invention is made in view of the above problems. The object of<br>
the invention is to provide a case structure for electronic device that is unlikely to<br>
be damaged by an external force, while using a wood of comparatively low<br>
strength for the covering member.<br>
In order to solve the problems, one aspect of the invention relates to a case<br>
structure for an electronic device. The case structure comprises at least two covering<br>
members made of a wooden material for covering a covered member; and a supporting<br>
member provided along the inner surfaces of the covering members for supporting the<br>
covering members.<br>
According to this invention, when an external force acts on the covering<br>
member, deformation of the covering member is restrained through being<br>
supported by a supporting member provided along inner surfaces of the covering<br>
member, enabling a wood of low strength to be used for the covering member of<br>
an electronic device.<br>
Advantageously, the supporting member includes a frame structure.<br>
According to this invention, the supporting member includes a frame<br>
structure that can be light in weight and inexpensive. Since spaces between the<br>
frames can be used as far as the inner face of the covering member, space inside<br>
the case can be utilized effectively, achieving a space-saving structure.<br>
Advantageously, the supporting member includes a net-like frame structure.<br>
According to this invention, the supporting member includes a net-like<br>
frame structure that enables it to be easily formed in a shape that runs along the<br>
inner surfaces of the covering member, even if the shape of the inner surfaces is<br>
complex. Therefore, the inner surfaces of the covering member can be<br>
supported over a comparatively wide area, facilitating stress dispersion.<br>
Preferably, the supporting member is also a holding member for holding the<br>
covered member.<br>
According to this invention, since the supporting member also functions<br>
as a holding member that holds the covered member, the number of components<br>
can be reduced and the downsizing is /' attained.<br>
Preferably, the supporting member is also a holding member for holding an<br>
external member provided outside the covering member.<br>
According to this invention, since the supporting member also functions<br>
as a holding member that holds the external member provided outside the<br>
covering member, the number of components can be reduced. By using the<br>
member of higher strength than the covering member as the supporting member, '<br>
it can hold the external member even when a wood of comparatively low strength<br>
is used for the covering member.<br>
Preferably, the supporting member has a frame-shaped securing member for<br>
securing the end portion of the covering member.<br>
According to this invention, when an external force acts on the covering<br>
member, the stress can be transmitted through the supporting member to a<br>
frame-shaped securing member, making it possible to restrain deformation of the<br>
end portion of the covering member and the supporting member, and to achieve a<br>
case structure of high strength.<br>
According to the case structure for electronic device of the invention,<br>
deformation of the covering member can be restrained by providing a supporting<br>
member along inner surfaces thereof, making it possible to form a casing that is<br>
unlikely to be damaged while using a wood of comparatively low strength for the<br>
covering member.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Embodiments in accordance with the invention will be described with reference<br>
to the figures. In all the figures, even if the embodiments are different, the same<br>
reference numerals are applied to similar or equivalent elements, and explanations which<br>
are the same hi the embodiments are omitted.<br>
Figure 1 is a perspective view of a digital camera that uses the case structure<br>
according to an embodiment of the invention. Figure 2 is an exploded perspective view<br>
of a digital camera shown in Figure 1 in order to illustrate a structure of a covering<br>
system thereof. Figure 3 is a sectional view taken along A-A of Figure 1. Figure 4 is a<br>
sectional view taken along B-B of Figure 1.<br>
An X, X and Z rectangular coordinate system is described that is common to<br>
Figures 1 to 3. Under the coordinate system, when taking a position to take a<br>
photograph of an object hi front holding a right side of a digital camera, a direction to the<br>
front is designated as a Z direction, a direction to the left as an X direction, and an upper<br>
vertical direction as a Y direction. For simplicity, relative directions may be explained<br>
hereunder referring to the coordinate system.<br>
A case structure of an embodiment in accordance with the invention can be<br>
appropriately used, for example, hi a digital camera 100 (an electronic device) shown in<br>
Figure 1.<br>
A casing of the digital camera 100, as shown in Figures 1 and 2, is made up of a<br>
front cover 1 (a covering member), a rear cover 2 (a covering member), a supporting<br>
frame 11 (supporting member), and a frame 3 (securing member).<br>
The casing contains, as the covered parts, the well-known optical parts,<br>
mechanical parts, and electrical parts that are necessary for a digital camera. In this<br>
embodiment, as shown hi Figures 1 and 3, are provided a built-in flash 6, a finder 7, an<br>
imaging unit 21, a liquid crystal display 24, an electrical control unit 23, a circuit unit 25,<br>
a memory card 27, batteries 29, and a barrier switch 26. One portion of the covered<br>
parts is exposed outside of an aperture provided on each of the front cover 1 and the rear<br>
cover 2.<br>
The imaging unit 21, as shown in Figure 3, is composed of a group of lenses 21a,<br>
a rnirror 21c, and a group of lenses 21b which constitute a zoom lens optical system held<br>
at a lens barrel 2Id, and a CCD as an image pick-up device, arranged at an image surface<br>
thereof.<br>
*•<br>
The group of lenses 21 a is a fixed group located nearest to an object.<br>
The group of lenses 21b, at least a portion of which is set on an optical path<br>
folded by the mirror 21c, is a moving group movably held by a zooming mechanism 21e.<br>
This structure enables the imaging unit 21 to perform a zooming without<br>
protruding from the casing.<br>
A lens barrier 5 is used to cover the front of the group of lenses 21a when no<br>
photograph is taken. The lens barrier 5 is a plate hi a shape of an ellipse or oval having<br>
a size that allows an imaging aperture la to be closed, and is made up of, for example,<br>
synthetic resin or metal.<br>
When the lens barrier 5 is assembled, the minor axis of an ellipse or oval is<br>
guided to a lens barrier guide 12c (described later). On the lens barrier 5, a pin 5a is<br>
erected in a positive Z direction. The pin 5a, when assembled, is inserted into a slide<br>
hole Ig to be connected to a slide lever 4.<br>
Thus, the movement of the lens barrier 5 can be realized by the movement of the<br>
slide lever 4 outside of the casing.<br>
The barrier switch 26 is used to switch on or off the power of the digital camera<br>
100 based on the movement of the lens barrier 5. As shown in Figure 3, a switch lever<br>
26a protrudes movably into a movement path of the lens barrier 5. When the lens<br>
barrier 5 covers the imaging aperture la, an electronic circuit is open. On the other<br>
hand, when the lens barrier 5 uncovers the imaging aperture la, the electronic circuit is<br>
closed.<br>
The rear cover 2, as shown in Figure 2, is of a box shape having an almost<br>
uniform thickness open to the positive Z direction that has a rectangular bottom plate 2E<br>
parallel to the XY plane, the circumference of which is enclosed by four sides.<br>
At the top of each of the four sides are formed a left side end 2A and a right side<br>
end 2C in the positive and negative directions of the X axis, respectively, and an upper<br>
side end 2B and a lower side end 2D in the positive and negative directions of the Y axis,<br>
respectively. The end surface for each of these side ends is nearly aligned on a plane<br>
parallel to the XY plane.<br>
hi the upper side end 2B near the right side end 2C is provided a notch 2a that is<br>
cut out in the shape of a semicircle from the end surface of the upper side end 2B. In<br>
the middle of the lower side end 2D, a notch 2b is provided that is cut out in the shape of<br>
a semicircle from the end surface of the lower side end 2D.<br>
In the nearly middle of the bottom plate 2E, the display aperture 2c is provided<br>
so that the liquid crystal display unit 24 can be seen from outside of the casing. In the<br>
left neighborhood (in the positive X axis direction) of the display aperture 2c, operation<br>
apertures 2d are provided to protrude the operation button 23a to the outside.<br>
The rear cover 2 can employ wooden material, light metal (aluminum, stainless<br>
steel, titanium, magnesium, or the like) that allows press molding, or synthetic resin<br>
(ABS, polycarbonate, acrylic, or the like) that allows injection molding. In the<br>
embodiments wooden material is used that is excellent in hygroscopicity and superior in<br>
design making the most of natural features.<br>
The wooden material used in the embodiments is compressed wooden material<br>
of which the density is enhanced and the strength is unproved by compression molding.<br>
Compression molding is performed as follows. Natural wood is cut relatively<br>
thick with regard to the thickness of the rear cover 2 to manufacture a prototype. The<br>
prototype is compression molded by dies in an atmosphere of high temperature water<br>
vapor to transfer the shape of the die surface. In this way, a thin shell type of member<br>
can be obtained, the surface of exposed woodgrain lines Q and the inside of which is<br>
much stronger than the prototype wooden material.<br>
The notches 2a and 2b, the display aperture 2c, and the operation aperture 2d<br>
can be formed by, for example, secondary processing after compression molding.<br>
In the embodiments, since the prototype for the rear cover 2 is cut out of an edge<br>
grain material, the cross section of a wood fiber is exposed at the end surfaces of the left<br>
side end 2A and the right side end 2C. Because cohesive force between the wood fibers<br>
is weak, the left side end 2A and the right side end 2C are easily broken or come off.<br>
The surface of the rear cover 2 may be provided with a carbonizing layer or<br>
coating layer, or with a pattern, an unevenness, or the like, by secondary processing.<br>
Foreign materials such as synthetic resin and synthetic rubber, and metal can be<br>
embedded into or attached to the rear cover 2.<br>
As a wooden material, the following can be selected: Japanese cypress,<br>
paulownia, teak, mahogany, Japanese cedar, pine, cherry tree, bamboo, or equivalents<br>
thereof. Not only raw wood but also a woody material such as a compression formed<br>
material that is made up of collected and solidified waste chips and sawdust can be used.<br>
The front cover 1 is a formed article made of the similar compressed wooden<br>
material as the rear cover 2. The front cover 1, as shown hi Figure 2, is of a box shape<br>
having an almost uniform thickness open to the negative Z direction that has a<br>
rectangular bottom plate IE parallel to the XY plane, the circumference of which is<br>
enclosed by four sides. Furthermore, in order to improve design, the front cover 1 uses<br>
a prototype cut out of a flat grain material so that complicatedly curved woodgrain lines<br>
G can be obtained. In this situation, as is the same with the rear cover 2, variation in<br>
strength of the ends occurs, depending on the way in which the woodgrain is overlapped<br>
at the ends.<br>
At the top of each of the four sides are formed a left side end 1A and a right side<br>
end 1C in the positive and negative directions of the X axis, respectively, and an upper<br>
side end IB and a lower side end ID in the positive and negative directions of the Y axis,<br>
respectively. The end surface for each of these side ends is nearly aligned on a plane<br>
parallel to the XY plane.<br>
In the upper side end IB near the right side end 1C is provided a notch le that is<br>
cut out in the shape of a semicircle from the end surface of the upper side end IB.<br>
The notch le forms a round hole together with the notch 2a of the rear cover 2,<br>
and the notch Ih forms a round hole together with the notch 2b of the rear cover 2 when<br>
assembled.<br>
Near the end surface of the right side end 1C, a insertion hole If for inserting<br>
and removing the memory card 27 is provided along the end surface thereof. A hole<br>
cover 9 can be removably mounted to the insertion hole If.<br>
Near the right side end 1C of the bottom plate IE, a grip Ib is formed that is<br>
swollen in a semicircle in the positive Z axis direction.<br>
At the bottom plate IE, the imaging aperture la to receive incident light is<br>
provided for a lens aperture of the imaging unit 21. The imaging aperture la, as shown<br>
hi Figure 3, has a slope to reduce its radius stepwise in the plate thickness direction of<br>
which the surface is carbonized to prevent stray light.<br>
For the finder 7 and the built-in flash 6, a finder aperture 1 c and a flash aperture<br>
Id are provided to insert their top end, respectively.<br>
Between the imaging aperture la and the grip Ib, a slide hole Ig is provided<br>
extending in the X axis direction. Into the slide hole Ig, a pin 5a of the lens barrier 5<br>
placed inside of the front cover 1 can be inserted.<br>
To the inner circumference of the frame 3 (a securing member) constituting a<br>
casing, a supporting frame 11 (a supporting member) is fixed. When the casing is<br>
assembled, the supporting frame 11 touches the inner surface of the front cover 1 and the<br>
rear cover 2, or is placed in a position adjacent to them. When an external force is<br>
applied to the front cover 1 and the rear cover 2, the supporting frame 11 is a reinforcing<br>
member for curbing their distortion to the inner side and preventing damage. When<br>
placed adjacent, an appropriate space is provided considering the amount of allowable<br>
deformation according to the strength of the front cover 1 and the rear cover 2.<br>
Away of fixing the supporting frame 11 may be a suitable way such as welding,<br>
caulking, or thread fastening. Alternatively, the supporting frame 11 may be formed<br>
integrally with the frame 3.<br>
The supporting frame 11 contains front frames 15a, 16a, and 17a, rear frames<br>
15b, 16b, and 17b, and a lens barrier storing portion 12, and is mainly composed of a<br>
frame structure of rod members having a cross section of a square.<br>
The front frames 15a and 16a and the rear frames 15b and 16b are spaced with<br>
an interval in the middle of the longer direction of the frame 3, and are made up of a<br>
U-shaped member along a curvature of the inner surfaces of the front cover 1 and the rear<br>
cover 2 built between the span of the shorter direction of the frame 3. The front frame<br>
15a is placed in a position corresponding to the left side (the positive X axis direction) of<br>
the imaging aperture la, while the front frame 16a is arranged in a middle position<br>
between the grip Ib and the imaging aperture la.<br>
The front frame 17a and the rear frame 17b are placed with an interval in the<br>
middle of the shorter direction of the frame 3 to be built between the front frame 16a, the<br>
rear frame 16b, and frame 3, respectively. The front frame 17a and the rear frame 17b<br>
consist of an L-shaped member curved to be along the inner surface of the bottoms IE<br>
and 2E. The front frame 17a contains a curvature for the grip Ib, in which an L-shaped<br>
bent portion projects circularly.<br>
A lens barrier storing portion 12 accommodates the lens barrier 5 together with<br>
the front cover 1 to movably hold the lens barrier 5 to the X axis direction. The lens<br>
barrier storing portion 12 includes a lens barrier guide surface 12b provided at a position<br>
slightly lower than the front surface of the front frame 15a and 16a (the surface opposite<br>
to the bottom platelE) by a thickness of the lens barrier 5, a lens barrier stopper 12a<br>
having a curvature to stop the end of the major axis of the lens barrier 5 from the middle<br>
of the front frame 15a, and lens barrier guides 12c and 12c having a slightly wider<br>
interval than a minor axis width of the lens barrier in the Y axis direction between the<br>
front frame 15a and the front frame 16a. The front surface of the lens barrier guide 12c<br>
is aligned with the front frames 15a and 16a.<br>
The lens barrier guide surface 12b has an aperture 14 in a position<br>
corresponding to the lens aperture of the imaging unit 21.<br>
Subsequently, the operation of the supporting frame 11 of the<br>
embodiment will be explained.<br>
When an external force is applied to the front cover 1 and the rear cover<br>
2, the supporting frame 11 can restrain their deformation at positions where the<br>
supporting frame 11 directly contacts them. Therefore, it is possible to ensure<br>
that stress caused by the external force does not exceed the breaking strengths of<br>
the front cover 1 and the rear cover 2 by providing appropriate gaps between<br>
them and the supporting frame 11.<br>
Moreover, as with the front frame 15a and the rear frame 15b, and the<br>
front frame 16a and the rear frame 16b, the structure circularly continuous to<br>
each other can resist an external force, which constitutes an advantage.<br>
Since the supporting frame 11 has a frame structure, the covered parts<br>
can be arranged near the inner surfaces of the covering member in the space<br>
surrounded by the frames, achieving a space-saving constitution and enabling to<br>
downsize.<br>
Alternatively, the space surrounded by the frames can be utilized to<br>
guide or store the member like the lens barrier 5 that is arranged in close contact<br>
with the covering member.<br>
A frame structure is advantageous in facilitating formation of a curved<br>
shape along the inner surfaces of the covering members.<br>
As a material for the supporting frame 11, wood, synthetic resin, or metal<br>
stronger than the front cover 1 and the rear cover 2 can be employed.<br>
The frame is roughly so formed, as shown in Figure 4, that a rod material whose<br>
cross section is of an H shape, where a web 3b (an end holding portion ) is provided with<br>
side guides 3a (a side guide portion) as a flange, is bent according to a nearly rectangular<br>
aperture that each end of the front cover 1 and the rear cover 2 makes up to form a<br>
circular frame body (see Figure 2). In order to show the cross section, Figure 2 is<br>
partially broken.<br>
The web 3b and the side guides3a and 3a constitute a U-shaped groove that<br>
holds the ends of the front cover 1 and the rear cover 2, respectively. When the front<br>
cover 1 and the rear cover 2 are pushed in between the side guides 3a and 3a from the <br>
axis direction to be assembled, at least one portion of each of the end surfaces of the web<br>
3b can strike against the front cover land the rear cover 2, so that the location of the front<br>
cover 1 and the rear cover 2 in the direction which they are pushed in can be controlled.<br>
Since the digital camera 100 should be repaired by opening the casing when in<br>
trouble, the front cover 1 and the rear cover 2 are removably fixed to the frame 3.<br>
Although not shown in Figure 2, for the drawings to be viewed easily, a fixing means is<br>
provided at appropriate positions in the frame 3.<br>
Various types of fixing means may be used; for example, the structure is<br>
employed that is composed of a projected piece which projects by at least the<br>
length enabling to fasten by screws from the side guide 3a of the inner side of the<br>
casing against the opposite side guide 3a, and has an appropriate width; and a<br>
female screw formed thereon to fasten the front cover 1 or the rear cover 2.<br>
In this case, the front cover 1 or the rear cover 2 is provided with a through hole<br>
to pass the screw.<br>
In this way, with respect to the covering member, only the through hole has to be<br>
processed, and no tapping may be made. Consequently, materials with low strength<br>
such as a wooden material can be fixed and removed repeatedly, and constitute a casing<br>
excellent in durability.<br>
As a material for the frame 3, synthetic resin or metal stronger than the front<br>
cover 1 and the rear cover 2 can be employed.<br>
The supporting frame 11, integrally fixed with the frame 3, may disperse an<br>
external force applied through the front cover 1 and the rear cover 2 and may transfer the<br>
stress to the frame 3.<br>
Being built in the frame 3, the supporting frame 11 is also a beam member for<br>
loading an external force from the circumferential direction of the frame 3.<br>
A various kinds of objects built in the casing can be touched with or fixed at the<br>
frame 3 and the supporting frame 11. For example, as shown in Figure 3, the electrical<br>
control unit 23 is attached to the rear frame 15b. A battery case 29a is mounted to the<br>
rear frame 16b and the frame 3. A card holder 28 is mounted to the front frame 16a and<br>
the front frame 17a. Likewise, the members whose attachment partners are not shown<br>
in Figure 3 are fixed at holding members (not shown) that are attached to the frame 3 and<br>
the supporting frame 11.<br>
Modifications of the supporting member of the embodiment will be<br>
explained.<br>
Figures 5A and 5B are perspective views which schematically explain a<br>
first and a second modifications of the supporting member according to an<br>
embodiment of this invention, respectively.<br>
As shown in Fig. 5A, a supporting frame 41 (supporting member)<br>
according to the first modification of the embodiment is built between opposing<br>
frames of the frame 3 along the inner surface of the covering member. For<br>
simplicity, the supporting frame 41 is illustrated to be of box-shape having<br>
U-shape in cross-section in Fig. 5A, but any three-dimensional shape is<br>
acceptable.<br>
The supporting frame 41 has a net-like frame structure that comprises,<br>
for example, a mesh 42 having multiple rectangular openings.<br>
The mesh 42 can be provided with an opening 43 where necessary.<br>
The outer periphery of the mesh 42 and the inner periphery of the opening 43<br>
may be connected to a frame made of the material different from that of the mesh<br>
42.<br>
Although not illustrated in Figs. 5A and 5B, the covering member and<br>
covered parts may be directly contacted with, or secured to, the mesh 42 if<br>
necessary.<br>
When the mesh 42 is made of metal, it may be formed by twining or<br>
joining metal wires. When the mesh 42 is made of synthetic resin, it can be<br>
molded into various mesh shapes.<br>
Preferably, when using metal for the mesh 42, it should be treated by a<br>
thermosetting process, such as quenching, after being formed into the appropriate<br>
shape. This causes the mesh to be of high strength even when the diameter of<br>
the metal wires is reduced.<br>
According to the supporting frame 41 described above, the netty frame<br>
structure enables a complex three-dimensional curved face to be formed easily.<br>
By providing the opening 43 only where it is needed, a comparatively wide area<br>
of the inner surface of the covering member can be covered by the supporting<br>
frame 41, enabling an external force applied to the covering member to be<br>
dispersed over a wide area.<br>
As shown in Fig. 5B, the supporting frame 45 (supporting member)<br>
according to the second modification of the embodiment is built on the frame 3 in<br>
the same way as the supporting frame 41, and has a plate-shell structure wherein<br>
a multiple holes 47 are formed in a plate portion 46 instead of the mesh 42. An<br>
opening 48 that is larger than the holes 47 may be provided if necessary.<br>
A press-processed punching metal or a molded synthetic resin can be<br>
used as the material for the supporting frame 45.<br>
The plate-shell structure of the supporting frame 45 enables a complex<br>
three-dimensional shape to be formed easily. By providing the opening 48 only<br>
where it is needed, a comparatively wide area of the inner surface of the covering<br>
member can be covered by the supporting frame 41, enabling an external force<br>
applied to the covering member to be dispersed over a wide area. Since a wide<br>
area is covered, the plate can be made thin to form a space-saving supporting<br>
member.<br>
In the first and second modifications, when the mesh 42 and the plate<br>
portion 46 are made of metal, a wide area of the inner surfaces of the covering<br>
member is covered at an appropriate area density, enabling them to be used as<br>
electromagnetic shield members. This is advantageous in easily facilitating<br>
countermeasures against electromagnetic radiation of the electronic device, even<br>
when the covering member is formed of a nonconductive material such as wood.<br>
While the above explanation describes an example where the members<br>
held by the supporting member are mainly covered parts, the supporting member<br>
can be arranged to hold external members that are exposed outside the casing, by<br>
providing through holes in the covering member and the like.<br>
For example, while an external member such as the hole cover 9 is<br>
attached to the insertion hole If in the front cover 1 in the above explanation, the<br>
supporting frame 11 can be arranged so as to hold the hole cover 9 by extending<br>
the shape of the supporting frame 11 into the insertion hole If.<br>
While the embodiment describes the lens barrier 5 that can move<br>
between the covering member and the supporting member, a barrier may be<br>
provided as an external member that moves along the outside of the front cover 1,<br>
a guide for moving the barrier being provided in the supporting frame 11.<br>
While the slide lever 4, being an external member, moves along the slide<br>
hole Ig, the slide hole Ig may instead be treated simply as an opening, with a<br>
guide portion that corresponds to the slide hole Ig being provided in the<br>
supporting frame 11.<br>
When external members are held by the supporting member in this way,<br>
the load on the covering member is reduced and its durability is improved.<br>
While the above explanation describes an example where the frame-like<br>
securing member is provided to secure the ends of the covering member, such a<br>
securing member may be omitted from the structure. In this arrangement, the<br>
case can be formed by securing the ends of covering member together directly.<br>
If the supporting member is strong enough, the covering member may be secured<br>
to it.<br>
In the above explanation, while the frame 3 is H-shaped in cross-section,<br>
and is a member to which the ends of the front cover 1 and the rear cover 2 are<br>
secured by striking the web 3b, the arrangement is not limited to this; for<br>
example, the cross-sectional shape of the frame 3 may be modified as appropriate,<br>
e.g. T-shaped, h-shaped, or the like.<br>
The above explanation is made of assuming that the frame 3 is a circular<br>
frame body. As long as the frame has a structure that hold the supporting<br>
member and bear the stress, the frame 3 may be formed while divided hi the<br>
circumferential direction of the top end of the covering member if necessary.<br>
For example, the constitution may be employed where beam members that are<br>
different from the supporting member are joined between a plurality of above<br>
frames 3.<br>
In the case, at positions at which the frame 3 is not placed, a suitable member<br>
shades light and blocks dust, depending on the situation.<br>
The above explanation is given to an example hi which a case structure for an<br>
electronic device hi accordance with the invention can be applied to a digital camera as<br>
an electronic device. The invention is preferable for all the electronic devices such as a<br>
remote controller for a television set, a video recorder, an air conditioner, or a projector, a<br>
portable telephone, an 1C recorder, and a PDA. In particular, the invention is most<br>
preferable for hand-held and hand-operated electronic devices to which using a wooden<br>
material as a covering member provides good hygroscopicity and good sensation.<br>
While preferred embodiments of the invention have been described and<br>
illustrated above, it should be understood that these are exemplary of the invention and<br>
are not to be considered as limiting. Additions, omissions, substitutions, and other<br>
modifications can be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present<br>
invention. Accordingly, the invention is not to be considered as being limited by the<br>
foregoing description, and is only limited by the scope of the appended claims.<br>
