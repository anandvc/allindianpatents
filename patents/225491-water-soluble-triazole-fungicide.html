				<td>Water-soluble triazole antifungal agents [Technical fiedll]<br>
The present invention relates to triazole compounds and pharmacologically acceptable salts thereof, which have excellent characteristics in terms of pharmacokinetics and antifungal activity) as medicaments (especially for injection)i and to medicaments (especially intifungals) containing said compounds or salts thereof as an active ingredient.<br>
[Background Art 3<br>
Various types of triazole compounds have so far been reported as agents for the treatment of fungal infections. For example, triazole compounds having a tertiary hydroxy group are described in Japanese Patent Application Publication IMo.Hei 3-333350, Japanese Patent Application Publication No.Hei 11-80135, Japanese Patent Application Publication No. He 1-10-279567, and Japanese Patent Application Publication No.2001-342187. In Japanese Patent Application Publication No. Sho62-12766, 2-(2,4-difluorophenyi)-1,3-bis (1H-1,2,4-triazol-l-y1)- 2-propanol (fluconazole) is described. In Japanese Patent Application Publication No.Hei 8-53426, 3-C4-(4-cyanophenyl) thiazol-2-y13-2-(2,4-difluoropheny1)~1-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-l-y1)-2-butanol (ravuconazole) is described. In WO 99/45008, 2-(2,5-difluorophenyi)-3-(4-(4-cyanopheny1)thiazol-2-y13-1- (1H-1, 2, 4-triazol-1-yl)-2-butanol (R00094815) as described. In Japanese<br>
Patent No.2629564, 2-(2f 4-difluorophenyl )-3-(5-fluoro-4-pyrimidinyl)-l-(lH-lt2,4-triazol-l-yl)-2-butanol (voriconazolt) is described. In Japanese Patent Application Publication No. Htl f,ill7M| l-C(lRt2R)-2~ (2f4-difluorophenyl)-2- hydroxy-1-Methyl-3-3 (1H-1,2,4-triazol-l-yl)propyl3-3-[4-(1H=1-<br>
tetrazolyl)phenyl3-2-iMidazolidinone (TAK-456) is described. In Japanese Patent Application Publication No.Hei 11-240871, 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-l- (ethylsulfonyl)-l, 1-difluoro-3-(lH-l,2,4-triazol-l-yl)-2-propanol (SS750) is described. In WO 98/31675, (2R,3R) -2- (2,4-difluorophenyl)-3-C4-[4-C3-oxo-2-l4-<br>
trifluoroMethoxybenzyl)-2H-lf2f4-triazol-4-ylfogebtkL-l- <br>
piperazinyl]-l-(lH-l,2,4-triazol-l-yl)-2-butanol (Syn-2869) is described. In WO97/05130, 7-chloro-3-[(1R,2R)-2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-2-hydroxy-l-methyl-3-(lH-l,2,4-triazol-l-yl)propyl]quinazolin-4(3H)-one (UR-9825) is described. Analogous triazole compounds are also described in Japanese Patent No. 3050982, WO 95/25107, WO 00/27852, WO 01/66551, and WO 01/79196.<br>
Further, ester compounds interrupted by a methylenedioxy group for improving the water solubility of agents for the treatment of fungal infections are described in WO 00/30655, WO 99/61017 and WO 01/52852.<br>
The administration form of agents for treatment of fungal infections depends on the kind of the target fungus and the type of infection. As the administration form, there are, for example, oral administration and injection administration. As these administration methods have advantages and disadvantages, both methods of administration are required for a preferable agent for the treatment of fungal infection. Although the triazole agents for the treatment of fungal infection indicated above have excellent antifungal activity, they also have the disadvantage of difficulty in administration by injection because of their low solubility in water.<br>
In order to improve the low solubility in water, the conversion of the hydroxy group into an ester group for increasing the water solubility may be considered. However, as the hydroxy group which these therapeutic agents have in common is a tertiary hydroxy group, there is the disadvantage that the said ester group is not cleaved promptly in vivo after administration owing to its low reactivity, and consequently that the active substance is not released efficiently. Ester compounds interrupted by a methylenedioxy group generate formaldehyde upon cleavage of the ester.<br>
The problem to be resolved by the present invention is to afford triazole compounds esterified on the tertiary hydroxy group which have high solubility in water, can be cleaved in vivo promptly, and are safe compounds because no formaldehyde is generated upon cleavage. Triazole compounds having an ester<br>
group on the tertiary hydroxy group renting to the present invention have not been known so far.<br>
[Disclosure of the invention]<br>
The present inventors have designed the ester group at the tertiary hydro'xy group relating to the present invention, conducted synthesis, and have found that the triazole compounds relating to the present invention are useful as medicaments (especially as antifungals) (and especially for injection), because these compounds can be produced at low cost and with ease, have superior chemical stability and high water solubility, undergo prompt cleavage of the ester group in vivo with high percentages of conversion to exhibit excellent antifungal activity, do not generate formaldehyde upon cleavage, have high organ selectivity, and exhibit favorable pharmacokinetics and a high degree of safety, thereby leading to completion of the present invention.<br>

The compounds of the general formula (I) of the present invention can be prepared according to the folJowing methods described below.<br>
[Method A]<br>
Method A is a method to prepare compounds (Ta1' [compounds (la) are compounds of general formula (I) of the present invention wherein La is a single bond, a C(.-C_( ary] group which may optionally be substituted with 1 to 3 same or different group(s) selected from the group consisting of Substituent group a, a heterocyclic group which may optionally be substituted with 1 to 3 same or different group (s) selected from the group consisting of Substituent group a, or a C1-C cycloalkyl group which may optionally be substituted with 1 to 3 same or different group(s) selected from the group consisting of Substituent group a, and R is a C1-C6 alkanoyl group which may optionally be substituted with 1 to 3 same or different group(s) selected from the group consisting of Substituent group P, a group of formula -C(O)-NP'R' (wherein, R" and R' independently represent a hydrogen atom or a C1-C( alkyl group, or R' and R', together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, form a 4- to 7-membered heterocyclic group containing nitrogen atom(s)) or a -P(=O)(OH), group], and the reaction scheme is shown below.<br><br>
In the above reaction scheme, X is as defined above, - is as defined for the above L (provided that L' is not an oxygen atom), R" is as defined for the above R (provided that R is not a hydrogen atom), and Pg is a carboxyl protecting grout:.<br>
Here, the protecting group Pg is a protecting group or the ester type which is conventionally used in organic synthesis for the protection of carboxylic acids (examples of wh:ch are<br>

The protecting agent is a compound represented by the formula Pg':-Z~ (wherein, Pgh is as defined above, and Z" represents a halogen atom or a leaving aroup) and, for example, can be a halide such as chloride, bromide, iodide and the like; or a sulfonate such as methanesulfonate, trifluoromethanesulfonate, toluenesulfonate and the like; and is preferably a halide.<br>
The solvent to be used, for example, can be a hydrocarbon such as hexane, cyclohexane, benzene, toluene and the like; -8 halogenated hydrocarbon such as dich Loromerihane, dichloroethane and tne like; a ketone such as acetone, 2-butanone and the iike; a sulfoxide such a.s dimdhyl : suifoxide<br>
and the like; an amide such as N,N-dimethylformamide and the like; a nitrile such as acetonitrile and the like; or an ether such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, 1,4-dioxane, 1,2-dimethoxyethane and the like; and is preferably an ether, a halogenated hydrocarbon or an aside.<br>
The base to be used is. not. particularly limited provided that it is one that is usually used in the field of synthetic organic chemistry, and, for exaaple, can be an alkali metal carbonate such as sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, cesium carbonate, sodium hydrogen carbonate and the like; an organic amine such as triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, dicyclohexylamine, pyridine, lutidine, 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)pyridine, diazabicycloundecene,<br>

The reaction temperature is usually from 0°C to the boiling point of the solvent employed (preferably from 0°C to room temperature). The time required for the reaction varies mainly depending on the kind of protecting group to be introduced, and is usually from 0.5 hours to 24 hours (preferably from 0.5 hours to 6 hours).<br>
After completion of the reaction, the compound (16) can be isolated from the reaction mixture by conventional methods. For example, it can be obtained by neutralizing the reaction mixture, adding an organic solvent which is not miscible with water to the reaction mixture or to the residue obtained after distilling off the solvent from the reaction mixture, washing the mixture with water, and then distilling off the solvent.<br>
If necessary, the obtained compound (16) can be further purified by conventional methods, for example, recrystallization, reprecipitation, chromatography or the like.<br>
Alternatively, in this Step a by-product where both hydroxy groups are protected may be obtained in addition to the desired compound (16) . In this case, if desired, the compound (16) can be isolated from said by-product using a method such as recrystallization, reprecipitation or by<br>
chromatography.<br>
(Step G-2)<br>

For example, when the protecting group Pg5 is a silyl group which is substituted with 3 groups selected independently from C1-C6 alkyl groups and phenyl groups such as a t-butyldimethylsilyl group, the reaction can be carried out by treating compound (17) with a fluoride salt in a solvent.<br>
