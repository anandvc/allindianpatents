				<td>The present invention relates to a method of fabricating an abrasive article, an abrasive segment and a segmented grinding wheel produced by said method. These abrasive tools are suitable for surface grinding and polishing of hard and/or brittle materials. This invention more particularly relates to highly porous, bonded abrasive articles having an interconnected pore structure and methods for making same. The abrasives of this invention are useful in high performance grinding operations, such as backgrinding silicon, alumina titanium carbide and silicon carbide wafers, which are typically used in the manufacture of electronic components.<br>
The use of porous abrasives to improve mechanical grinding processes is generally well known. Pores typically provide access to grinding fluids, such as coolants and lubricants, which tend to promote more efficient cutting, minimize metallurgical damage (e.g., surface burn), and maximize tool life. Pores also permit the clearance of material (e.g., chips or swarf) removed from an object being ground, which is important especially when the object being ground is relatively soft or when surface finish requirements are demanding (e.g., when backgrinding silicon wafers).<br>
Previous attempts to fabricate abrasive articles and/or tools including porosity may generally be classified into one of two categories. In the first category, a pore structure is created by the addition of organic pore inducing media (such as ground walnut shells) into the abrasive article. These media thermally decompose upon firing, leaving voids or pores in the cured abrasive tool. Examples of this category are U.S. Patents 5,221,294 to Carmen, et al., and 5,429,648 to Wu, and Japan Patents A-91-161273 to Grotoh, et al., A-91-281174 to Satoh, et al. In the second category, a pore structure may be created by the addition of closed cell materials, such as bubble alumina, into an abrasive article. See for example U.S. Patent 5,203,886 to Sheldon, et al.<br>
In an alternative approach, Wu et al., in U.S. Patents 5,738,696 and 5,738,697, each of which is fully incorporated herein by reference, disclose an abrasive article and method for fabricating the same including fiber-like abrasive grains having a length to diameter aspect ration of at least 5:1. The poor packing characteristics of the elongated abrasive grains resulted in an abrasive article including increased porosity and permeability and suitable for relatively high-performance grinding.<br>
As market demand has grown for precision components in products such as engines, refractory equipment, and electronic devices (e.g., silicon and silicon carbide wafers, magnetic heads, and display windows) the need has  grown for  improved abrasive  tools  for  fine precision<br><br>
grinding and polishing of ceramics and other relatively hard and/or brittle materials. The abrasive tools known in the art have not proven entirely satisfactory in meeting the above stated needs. Therefore, there exists a need for improved abrasive articles and abrasive tools, and in particular, those including a relatively high degree of porosity.<br>
One aspect of the present invention includes a method for fabricating an abrasive article. The method includes blending a mixture of abrasive grain, bond material, and dispersoid particles, the mixture including from about 0.5 to about 25 volume percent abrasive grain, from about 19.5 to about 49.5 volume percent bond material, and from about 50 to about 80 volume percent dispersoid particles. The method further includes pressing the mixture into an abrasive laden composite, thermally processing the composite, and immersing the composite into a solvent for a period of time suitable to dissolve substantially all of the dispersoid, the dispersoid being soluble in the solvent. Further, the abrasive grain and the bond material are substantially insoluble in the solvent. In one variation of this aspect, the bond material includes from about 35 to about 85 weight percent copper, from about 15 to about 65 weight percent tin, and from about 0.2 to about 1.0 weight percent phosphorus. In a further variation of this aspect, the dispersoid includes granular sodium chloride and the solvent includes boiling water.<br>
In another aspect, this invention includes an abrasive segment for a segmented grinding wheel. The abrasive segment includes a composite including a plurality of superabrasive grains and a metal bond matrix sintered together at a temperature ranging from about 370 to about 795Â°C, the composite having a plurality of interconnected pores disposed therein, the composite including from about 0.5 to about 25 volume percent abrasive grain, from about 19.5 to about 49.5 percent metal bond and from about 50 to about 80 volume percent interconnected porosity. The metal bond matrix includes from about 35 to about 70 weight percent copper, from about 30 to about 65 weight percent tin, and from about 0.2 to about 1.0 weight percent phosphorus. The plurality of superabrasive grains is selected from the group consisting of diamond and cubic boron nitride, the superabrasive grains having an average particle size of less than about 300 microns.<br>
In a further aspect, this invention includes a segmented grinding wheel. The grinding wheel includes a core having a minimum specific strength of 2.4 MPa-cmVg, a core density of 0.5 to 8.0 g/cm3, and a circular perimeter. The grinding wheel further includes an abrasive rim including a plurality of segments, each of the segments including a composite having a plurality of abrasive grains and a metal bond matrix sintered together at a temperature ranging from about 370 to about 795Â°C, the composite having a plurality of interconnected pores disposed therein, the composite including from about 50 to about 80 volume percent interconnected porosity. The grinding wheel still further includes a thermally stable bond between said core and each of said plurality of segments.<br><br>
In still a further aspect, this invention includes a method for fabricating an abrasive article having from about 40 to about 80 volume percent interconnected porosity. The method includes blending a mixture of abrasive grain, organic or other non-metallic bond material, and dispersoid particles, the mixture including from about 0.5 to about 25 volume percent abrasive grain, from about 19.5 to about 65 volume percent organic bond material, and from about 40 to about 80 volume percent dispersoid particles. The method further includes pressing the mixture into an abrasive laden composite, thermally processing the composite, immersing the composite into a solvent for a period of time suitable to dissolve substantially all of the dispersoid, the dispersoid being soluble in the solvent. In a variation of this aspect the dispersoid includes granular sugar and the solvent includes boiling water.<br>
In yet another aspect, this invention includes an abrasive segment for a segmented grinding wheel. The abrasive segment includes a composite including a plurality of superabrasive grains and a non-metallic bond matrix cured together, the composite having a plurality of interconnected pores disposed therein and including from about 0.5 to about 25 volume percent abrasive grain, from about 19.5 to about 65 percent non-metallic bond and from about 40 to about 80 volume percent interconnected porosity. The plurality of superabrasive grains are selected from the group consisting of diamond and cubic boron nitride, the plurality of superabrasive grains having an average particle size of less than about 300 microns.<br>
In yet a further aspect, this invention includes a segmented grinding wheel. The grinding wheel includes a core having a minimum specific strength of 2.4 MPa-cm3/g, a core density of 0.5 to 8.0 g/cm3, and a circular perimeter. The grinding wheel further includes an abrasive rim including a plurality of segments, each of the segments including a composite of abrasive grains and a non-metallic bond matrix cured together, the composite having a plurality of interconnected pores disposed therein and including from about 40 to about 80 volume percent interconnected porosity. The grinding wheel still further includes a thermally stable bond between the core and each of the plurality of segments.<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic representation of one embodiment of an abrasive segment of this invention; and<br>
Figure 2A is a partial schematic representation of one embodiment of a grinding wheel including sixteen of the abrasive segments of Figure 1;<br>
Figure 2B is a cross-sectional view taken along Line "A" - "A" of Figure 2A; and<br>
Figure 2C is a partially enlarged view showing the Portion 110 of Figure 2B.<br>
The present invention includes a porous abrasive article that may be useful in precision grinding, polishing, or cutting applications. One example of the abrasive grinding wheel of the present invention is an abrasive segment 10 for a segmented grinding wheel 100 (see for example Figures 1 and 2, which are described in further detail hereinbelow with respect to Example 1). One embodiment of an abrasive article of this invention includes from about 50 to about 80<br><br>
volume percent interconnected porosity. Another embodiment of an abrasive article of this invention includes a non-metallic bond, such as an organic bond material (e.g., phenolic resin) and includes from about 40 to about 80 volume percent interconnected porosity. This invention also includes a method for fabricating porous abrasive articles. Grinding wheels (e.g., grinding wheel 100) including one or more of the abrasive articles (e.g., segment 10) of this invention are potentially advantageous for mirror finish grinding of hard and/or brittle materials, such as silicon wafers, silicon carbide, alumina titanium carbide, and the like. These grinding wheels may be further advantageous in that they may eliminate the need for dressing (or otherwise conditioning) the grinding face of the grinding wheel during mirror finish grinding of the above materials. Other potential advantages of this invention will become apparent in the discussion and examples that follow.<br>
One aspect of the present invention was the realization, contrary to conventional wisdom (see for example Japan Patent 60-118,469 to Ishihara), that abrasive articles including greater than 50 volume percent interconnected porosity, and in particular including from about 50 to about 80 volume percent interconnected porosity, may provide superior grinding performance when grinding hard and/or brittle materials, without substantially sacrificing the mechanical integrity of the abrasive article. Embodiments of the abrasive articles of this invention, therefore, include at least 50 volume percent interconnected porosity and effective amounts of at least one abrasive grain and bond material. The abrasive articles may further optionally include fillers, lubricants and other components known to those skilled in the art. These abrasive articles preferably include from about 50 to about 80 volume percent interconnected porosity, and most preferably from about 50 to about 70 volume percent interconnected porosity.<br>
Substantially any abrasive grain may be used in the abrasive articles of this invention. Conventional abrasives may include, but are not limited to, alumina, silica, silicon carbide, zirconia-alumina, garnet, and emery in grit sizes ranging from about 0.5 to about 5000 microns, preferably from about 2 to about 300 microns. Superabrasive grains, including but not limited to diamond and cubic boron nitride (CBN), with or without a metal coating, having substantially similar grit sizes as the conventional grains, may also be used. Abrasive grain size and type selection typically vary depending on the nature of the workpiece and the type of grinding process. For fine finish (i.e., "mirror finish") grinding, superabrasive grains having a smaller particle size, such as ranging from about 0.5 to about 120 microns or even from about 0.5 to about 75 microns may be desirable. In general, smaller (i.e., finer) grain sizes are preferred for fine grinding and surface finishing/polishing operations, while larger (i.e., coarser) grain sizes are preferred for shaping, thinning, and other operations in which a relatively large amount of material removal is required.<br>
Substantially any type of bond material commonly used in the fabrication of bonded abrasive articles may be used as a matrix material in the abrasive article of this invention.  For<br><br>
example, metallic, organic, resinous, or vitrified bond (together with appropriate curing agents if necessary) may be used, with metallic bond being generally desirable. A metal bond having a fracture toughness ranging from about 1.0 to about 6.0 MPa-ml/2 is generally desirable, with a fracture toughness ranging from about 1.0 to about 3.0 MPam"2 being preferable. Further detail regarding fracture toughness is provided in U.S. Patents 6,093,092 and 6,102,789 to Ramanath et a!., which are fully incorporated herein by reference, and are hereinafter referred to as the Ramanath patents.<br>
Materials useful in a metal bond matrix include, but are not limited to, bronze, copper, and zinc alloys (e.g., brass), cobalt, iron, nickel, silver, aluminum, indium, antimony, titanium, zirconium, and their alloys, and mixtures thereof. A mixture of copper and tin has been found to be a generally desirable metal bond matrix composition. Compositions including from about 35 to about 85 weight percent copper and from about 15 to about 65 weight percent tin may be suitable for the abrasive articles of this invention. Compositions including from about 35 to about 70 weight percent copper, from about 30 to about 65 weight percent tin, and optionally from about 0.2 to about 1.0 weight percent phosphorous (such as in a copper phosphorous alloy) are preferable. These bond materials may optionally be used with titanium or titanium hydride, chromium, or other known superabrasive reactive material capable of forming a carbide or nitride chemical linkage between the grain and the bond at the surface of the superabrasive grain under the selected sintering conditions to strengthen the grain/bond posts. Stronger grain/bond interactions generally reduce grain "pullout" which tends to damage the workpiece and shorten tool life.<br>
An example of a suitable organic bond is a thermosetting resin, but other types of resins may be used. Preferably, the resin is either an epoxy resin or a phenolic resin, and it may be used in liquid or powder form. Specific examples of suitable thermosetting resins include phenolic resins (e.g., novolak and resole), epoxy, unsaturated polyester, bismaleimide, polyimide, cyanate ester, melamines, and the like.<br>
Embodiments of the abrasive article of this invention include from about 50 to about 80 volume percent interconnected porosity in which the average pore size ranges from about 25 to about 500 microns. The interconnected porosity is formed during fabrication by adding a sufficient quantity of dispersoid particles to the abrasive grain and bond mixture to insure that a relatively high percentage of dispersoid particles are in contact with other dispersoid particles in the molded abrasive article (before and after sintering).<br>
One desirable porous embodiment includes from about 0.5 to about 25 volume percent superabrasive and from about 30.5 to about 49.5 volume percent metal bond matrix sintered together at a temperature ranging from about 370 to about 795 Â°C at a pressure ranging from about 20 to about 33 MPa. The metal bond matrix includes from about 35 to about 70 weight percent copper, from about from about 30 to about 65 weight percent tin, and from about 0.2 to about 1.0<br><br>
weight percent phosphorous. The superabrasive includes diamond having a particle size ranging from about 0.5 to about 300 microns (and in particular embodiments, from about 0.5 to about 75 microns).<br>
Other desirable porous embodiments include from about 40 to about 80 volume percent interconnected porosity in which the average pore size ranges from about 150 to about 500 microns. These embodiments further include from about 0.5 to about 25 volume percent superabrasive and from about 19.5 to about 65 volume percent organic bond cured together at temperatures ranging from about 100 to about 200Â°C (or 400 to about 450Â°C for polyimide resins) at pressures ranging from about 20 to about 33 MPa. (Dispersoids having an acicular shape, e.g., having an aspect ratio of &gt; or = 2:1, may be desirably used to achieve about 40 to 50 volume percent interconnected porosity.) The abrasive articles of this invention may be fabricated using conventional powder metallurgy/polymer fabrication processes. Abrasive, bond, and dispersoid powders of suitable size and composition are well mixed, molded into a suitable shape, and sintered/cured at a relatively high temperature and pressure to yield a relatively dense composite, preferably having a density of at least 95% of the theoretical density (and typically from about 98 to 99% of the theoretical density). For abrasive articles including a metal bond matrix, the powders are typically sintered in the range of from about 370 to about 795 Â°C at pressures in the range from about 20 to about 33 MPa. For example, in one embodiment the powder mixture is first heated to 401Â°C for 20 minutes. The powders are then sintered at a temperature of 401Â°C and a pressure of 22.1 MPa for 10 minutes. After cooling, the abrasive laden composites, including dispersoids that are substantially in contact with one another, are immersed in a solvent in order to selectively remove (i.e., dissolve) the dispersoids. The resultant abrasive article has a foam-like structure including a mixture of abrasive and bond matrix, and having a network of effectively randomly distributed interconnected pores (i.e., voids from which the dispersoid was dissolved).<br>
Substantially any dispersoid that may be readily dissolved in a solvent such as water, alcohol, acetone, and the like, may be used. In general, dispersoids that are soluble in water, such as sodium chloride, potassium chloride, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, sodium silicate, sodium carbonate, sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate, magnesium sulfate, and the like, and mixtures thereof are preferred. For use in some grinding applications (such as silicon wafers and other electronics components), the use of a non-ionic (i.e., non-salt) dispersoid, such as sugar, dextrin, polysaccharide oligomers, may be desirable. Most preferred are dispersoids having a relatively high solubility in water and relatively rapid dissolution kinetics, such as sodium chloride or sugar. Preferable dispersoids may also exhibit a relatively high melting point (mp) to withstand the sintering process. For example sodium chloride has a melting point of about 800Â°C. For abrasive articles requiring very high sintering temperatures, dispersoids such as sodium aluminum silicate (mp 1650Â°C), magnesium sulfate (mp 1124Â°C), potassium phosphate (mp<br><br>
1340Â°C), potassium silicate (mp 976Â°C), sodium metasilicate (mp 1088Â°C), and mixtures thereof may be used.<br>
The particle size of the dispersoids is typically in the range from about 25 to about 500 microns. In one desirable embodiment the dispersoids include a particle size distribution from about 74 to about 210 microns (i.e., including dispersoid particles finer than U.S. Mesh (Standard Sieve) 70 and coarser than U.S. Mesh 200). In another desirable embodiment, the dispersoids include a particle size distribution from about 210 to about 300 microns (i.e., including dispersoid particles finer than U.S. Mesh 50 and coarser than U.S. Mesh 70). In yet another desirable embodiment, in which sugar is used as a dispersoid, particle size distributions ranging from about 150 to about 500 microns may be used (i.e. including dispersoid particles finer than U.S. Mesh 35 and coarser than U.S. Mesh 100).<br>
The abrasive articles described hereinabove may be used to fabricate substantially any type of grinding tool. Generally desirable tools include surface grinding wheels (e.g., ANSI Type 2A2T or Type 2A2TS abrasive wheels and Type 1A and 1A1 abrasive wheels) as well as cup wheels (e.g., ANSI Type 2 or Type 6 wheels, or Type 119V bell-shaped cup wheels). The abrasive grinding wheels may include a core (e.g., core 20 of Figures 2A - 2C) having a central bore for mounting the wheel on a grinding machine, the core being designed to support a porous abrasive rim disposed along its periphery (see for example grinding wheel 100 in Figure 2A, which is discussed in more detail hereinbelow with respect to Example 1). These two portions of the wheel are typically held together with an adhesive bond that is thermally stable under grinding conditions, and the wheel and its components are designed to tolerate stresses generated at wheel peripheral speeds of up to at least 80m/sec, and desirably up to 160m/sec or more.<br>
In one embodiment the core is substantially circular in shape. The core may comprise substantially any material having a minimum specific strength of 2.4 MPa-cm3/g, and more desirably, in the range from about 40 to about 185 MPa-cm3/g. The core material has a density of 0.5 to 8.0 g/cm3, and preferably from about 2.0 to about 8.0 g/cm3. Examples of suitable materials are steel, aluminum, titanium, bronze, their composites and alloys, and combinations thereof. Reinforced plastics having the designated minimum specific strength may also be used to construct the core. Composites and reinforced core materials typically include a continuous phase of a metal or a plastic matrix, often initially provided in powder form, to which fibers or grains or particles of harder, more resilient, and/or less dense, material is added as a discontinuous phase. Examples of reinforcing materials suitable for use in the core of the tools of this invention are glass fiber, carbon fiber, aramid fiber, ceramic fiber, ceramic particles and grains, and hollow filler materials such as glass, mullite, alumina, and Z-Light spheres. Generally desirable metallic core materials include ANSI 4140 steel and aluminum alloys, 2024, 6065 and 7178. Further detail regarding suitable core materials, properties, and the like is provided in the Ramanath patents.<br><br>
A grinding wheel (e.g., grinding wheel 100 shown in Figure 2A) may be fabricated by first forming individual segments of a preselected dimension, composition and porosity, as described hereinabove (see for example segment 10 shown in Figure 1, which is discussed in more detail hereinbelow with respect to Example 1). Grinding wheels may be molded and sintered, fired, or cured by a variety of processes known in the art. Among these processes are hot pressing (at pressures of about 14-28 MPa), cold pressing (at pressures of about 400-500 MPa or more), and hot coining in a steel mold (at pressures of about 90-110 MPa). The skilled artisan will readily recognize that cold pressing (and to a lesser extent hot coining) are useful only for dispersoid particles having a high compressive strength (i.e., resistance to crushing). For metal bond abrasive articles, hot pressing (at about 350 - 500Â°C and 22 MPa) is preferred. For organic bond abrasive articles in which a sugar containing dispersoid is used, cold or "warm" pressing (at temperatures less than about 160Â°C) may be desirable. Additional details regarding pressing and thermal processing techniques are provided in U.S. Patent 5,827,337, which is fully incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Following pressing, thermal processing, and immersing into a solvent, the segments are typically finished by conventional techniques, such as by grinding or cutting using vitrified grinding wheels or carbide cutting wheels, to yield an abrasive rim segment having the desired dimensions and tolerances. The segments may then be attached to the periphery of the core with a suitable adhesive (see for example Figures 2A - 2C, which is also discussed hereinbelow). Desirable adhesives include 353-NDT epoxy resin (EPO-TEK, Billerica, MA) at a 10:1 weight ratio of resin to hardener, and TechnodyneÂ® HT-18 epoxy resin (obtained from Taoka Chemicals, Japan) and its modified amine hardener mixed in a ratio of about 100 parts by weight resin to about 19 parts by weight hardener. Further detail regarding adhesives, their properties, and the application thereof to metal bond grinding wheels is provided in the Ramanath patents.<br>
An alternate grinding wheel fabrication method includes forming segment precursor units of a powder mixture of abrasive, bond, and dispersoid, molding the segment units around the circumference of the core, and applying heat and pressure to create and attach the segments in-situ (i.e., by co-sintering the core and the rim). After co-sintering, the grinding wheel is immersed in a selected solvent for dissolving the dispersoids from the rim, resulting in highly porous abrasive rim (as previously described). For this alternate process, it may be desirable to use dispersoids that do not contain chloride ions (e.g., sodium chloride), in the event the core material includes aluminum or an aluminum alloy (e.g., alloy 7075), since aluminum alloys may pit in the presence of chloride ions.<br>
The abrasive articles and tools of this invention (e.g., grinding wheel 100 shown in Figure 2A and discussed in more detail hereinbelow) are desirable for grinding ceramic materials including, various oxides, carbides, nitrides and, silicides such as silicon nitride, silicon dioxide, and silicon oxynitride, stabilized zirconia, aluminum oxide (e.g., sapphire), boron carbide, boron<br><br>
and about 65 volume percent table salt. Three drops of mineral spirit DL 42â¢ (obtained from Worcester Chemical, Worcester, MA) were added to the blend prior to mixing to help prevent separation of the ingredients. The mixture was then separated into 16 equal portions (each corresponding to one of the 16 abrasive segments 10 used on the abrasive wheel 100). Each portion was placed in a graphite mold and hot pressed at 407Â°C for 10 minutes at 22.1 MPa (3200 psi) until a matrix with a target density in excess of 95% of theoretical had been formed. After cooling, the segments 10 were immersed in a relatively large quantity (e.g., 0.5 liter) of boiling water for 45 minutes in order to remove the salt therefrom. The segments 10 were then thoroughly rinsed with deionized (DI) water. This process was repeated to ensure complete removal of the salt. Subsequent weight loss and energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) measurements confirmed that substantially all table salt had been removed from the segments.<br>
Referring to Figure 1, a schematic representation of one segment 10 is shown. Each of the segments 10 were ground to the required dimensions and tolerances to match the periphery of a machined aluminum core 20 (wheel Type 2A2TS shown in Figures 2A - 2C). Segments 10 have an arcuate profile having an outer radius of curvature 11 of 127 millimeters (5 inches) and an inner radius of curvature 12 of 124 millimeters (4.9 inches). When viewed from the front (or back) segments 10 have a length dimension 13 of 47 millimeters (1.8 inches) and a width dimension 14 of 6.3 millimeters (0.25 inches).<br>
The segments 10 were used to construct a Type 2A2TS face-grinding type grinding wheel 100, as shown in Figure 2A. Grinding wheel 100 includes sixteen symmetrically spaced segments 10 bonded to an aluminum core 20, yielding a grinding wheel 100 having an outer diameter 102 of about 282 millimeters (11.1 inches) and a slotted rim 104. As shown at 110 the segmented rim protrudes a distance 112 from the face of aluminum core 20 of about 3.9 millimeters (0.16 inches). The abrasive segments 10 and the aluminum core 20 were assembled with an epoxy resin/amine hardener cement system (Technodyne HT-18 adhesive, obtained from Taoka Chemicals, Japan) to make grinding wheels having a slotted rim 104 consisting of sixteen abrasive segments 10. The contact surfaces of the core and the segments 10 were degreased and sandblasted to insure adequate adhesion. EXAMPLE 2 Grinding performance evaluation<br>
One metal bonded segmental wheel (wheel 2-A), fabricated according to the method of Example 1, above, was tested for finish backgrinding performance of silicon wafers. One commercially available grinding wheel of the same grit size and concentration in a resin bond (wheel specification D3/6MIC-IN.656-BX623, obtained from Saint Gobain Abrasives, Inc., Worcester, MA) recommended for finish backgrinding of a silicon wafer, served as a comparative wheel and was tested along with the wheel of this invention. This comparative wheel included about 5 volume percent diamond abrasive, about 62 volume percent hollow glass spheres, about<br><br>
12 volume percent resin, and about 21 volume percent porosity. The glass spheres included about 15 volume percent glass shell. Therefore, the comparative wheel may be thought of as including about 9.3 volume percent glass shell and about 73.7 volume percent non-interconnected porosity (i.e., about 21% volume percent porosity plus about 52.7 volume percent hollow interior of the hollow glass spheres).<br>

Results for the grinding test of Example 2 are shown below in Table 1. Fifty wafers were fine ground using the resin-bonded comparative wheel and the porous wheel of this invention (wheel 2-A). As shown in Table 1, both the control wheel and inventive wheel exhibited relatively stable peak normal force for at least fifty wafers. Each wheel also required approximately the same peak normal force. This type of grinding performance is highly desirable in backgrinding silicon wafers because these relatively low force, steady state conditions minimize thermal and mechanical damage to the workpiece.<br>
Further, the porous wheel of this invention provided for the highly desirable grinding performance described above for at least fifty wafers without the need for dressing of the wheel.<br>
In summary, Example 2 shows that the inventive wheel provides for highly desirable backgrinding performance on silicon wafers, while unexpectedly (for a metal bonded wheel) using less power than a comparable resin bonded wheel.<br>

Results for the grinding test of Example 3 are shown below in Table 2. Fifty-five etched silicon wafers were fine finish background using the resin-bonded comparative wheel. In backgrinding etched silicon wafers, a coarse grind step is not used, since the surface of the etched silicon is relatively smooth. As shown in Table 2, the peak normal force increases relatively continuously as more parts are ground, eventually increasing to a value at which the grinding machine shuts down. Seventy-five etched silicon wafers were ground using the porous wheel of this invention. As also shown in Table 2, the peak normal forces remain low and stable over the course of the entire experiment. These results clearly demonstrate the self-dressing nature of the inventive wheel.<br>
This type of grinding performance is highly desirable in backgrinding silicon wafers because these relatively low force, steady state conditions minimize thermal and mechanical damage to the workpiece. Further, the self-dressing nature of the wheel may provide for a backgrinding operation in which it is not necessary to dress (or otherwise condition) the grinding wheel. As a result, the wheels of this invention may provide for increased throughput, reduced costs, and more consistent grinding results than those achieved using conventional grinding wheels.<br>
In summary, Example 3 shows that the inventive wheel provides for highly desirable backgrinding performance on etched silicon wafers, while substantially eliminating the need for dressing of the wheel. The performance of the inventive wheel is substantially superior to that of the conventional resin-bonded wheels in this application.<br><br>

EXAMPLE 4<br>
Grinding Performance Evaluation<br>
Two metal bonded segmented wheels, made in a manner similar to the method of Example 1, above, were tested for grinding performance. Both wheels included about 14 volume percent diamond abrasive having a particle size distribution from about 63 to about 74 micron (i.e., particles finer than U.S. Mesh 200 and coarser than U.S. Mesh 230). The wheels further included about 21 volume percent metal bond (having the composition described in Example 1) and about 65 volume percent interconnected porosity. The first wheel (wheel 4-A) was fabricated using -70/+200 U.S. Mesh table salt dispersoid, as described in Example 1, likely resulting in a pore size ranging from about 74 to about 210 microns (the pore size is assumed to be approximately the same size as that of the removed salt dispersoid). The second wheel (wheel 4-B) was fabricated using -50/+70 U.S. Mesh table salt, likely resulting in a pore size ranging from about 210 to about 300 microns. While not measured, it is expected that the wheel having a larger pore size also included a larger metal bond filament size. The term "filament" is used consistently with normal usage familiar to the skilled artisan, to refer to the connecting matrix material (i.e., the framework of the porous structure) disposed between the interconnected pores.<br><br>
The two grinding wheels described above were used to coarse grind 4.5 inch square AITiC wafers. The grinding test conditions were:<br>

Results for the grinding test of Example 4 are shown below in Table 3. Both wheels were observed to successfully grind the AITiC wafer, exhibiting relatively stable peak normal forces<br><br>
with time and sufficient stock removal. The first wheel, having a relatively fine pore size (and likely a relatively fine metal bond filament size) was used to grind the AlTiC wafer for about 25 minutes (1500 seconds). A relatively stable peak normal force of about 35 N was observed and about 1150 microns of AlTiC was removed from the wafer (a stock removal rate of about 46 microns/min). The wheel was observed to wear about 488 microns (a material removal/wheel wear ratio of about 2.4). The second wheel, having a relatively coarse pore size (and likely a relatively coarse metal bond filament size) was used to grind the AlTiC wafer for about seven minutes (420 seconds). A relatively stable peak normal force of about 94 N was observed and about 2900 microns of AlTiC was removed from the wafer (a stock removal rate of about 414 microns/min). The wheel was observed to wear about 18 microns (a material removal/wheel wear ratio of about 160).<br>
In summary, Example 4 shows that the highly porous wheels of this invention are well suited for grinding AlTiC wafers. Further, this example shows that the wear resistance and self-dressing properties of the wheels of this invention may be tailored by adjusting the relative pore size of the abrasive articles. While not wishing to be bound by a particular theory, it is believed that the increased wheel wear of the wheel including the relatively fine pores is related to a weakening of the metal bond as the metal bond filament size is reduced. Nevertheless, this Example indicates that the properties of the wheel may be engineered for specific applications by adjusting the relative pore size therein.<br>

percent interconnected porosity. Samples measuring 1.5 inch in diameter and 0.5 inch in thickness were hot pressed at 405 degrees C at a pressure of 3200 psi. Upon cooling the samples were lapped by hand using a silicon carbide abrasive slurry (180 grit size) in order to open the pores on the surfaces thereof. The samples were then immersed in boiling water as described in Example 1. Four samples were prepared for each porosity value. Average permeability results are shown below in Table 5.<br>
Permeability values are reported in units of volume of air per unit time (Q, in cc/second) per unit pressure (P, inches of water) and were measured through the thickness of samples having a diameter of 1.5 inches (37.5mm) and a thickness of 0.5 inch (12.7mm). As expected, permeability values were low for the samples having effectively no interconnected porosity. Permeability was observed to increase significantly with increasing porosity. In particular, samples having greater than about 50% interconnected porosity where characterized as having permeability values of greater than about 0.2 cubic centimeter per second per inch of water as the porosity increased above about 50 volume percent.<br>

EXAMPLE 7<br>
Segmented grinding wheels, each including sixteen segments, were assembled in a manner substantially similar to that described in Example 1 (hereinabove). The segments, however, included an organic bond (as opposed to the metal bond described in Example 1) and were fabricated as described below:<br>
Granular sugar (obtained from Shaw"s, Inc., Worcester, MA) was shaken in a 1-gallon paint can for approximately 2 hours using a paint shaker (made by Red DevilÂ®, Inc., Union, NJ), in order to break off the sharp corners and edges, thereby effectively "rounding" the sugar<br><br>
granules. The granular sugar was then screened to obtain a particle size distribution from about 250 to about 500 microns (i.e., -35/+60 U.S. Mesh).<br>
Powdered resin bond was pre-screened through a U.S. Mesh 200 screen in order to remove agglomerates. Fine diamond abrasive powder, particle size distribution from about 3 to about 6 microns obtained from AmplexÂ® Corporation (Olyphant, Pennsylvania) as RB3/6 was added to the powdered resin and mixed until substantially homogeneous. The mixture, including approximately 80 volume percent resin and about 20 volume percent abrasive, was screened three times through a U.S. Mesh 165 screen and was then added to granular sugar (prepared as described above). The resin/abrasive/sugar mixture was then mixed until substantially homogeneous and screened twice through a U.S. Mesh 24 screen.<br>
Three composite mixtures were fabricated. The first mixture (used in the fabrication of wheel 7-A) included about 4 volume percent diamond abrasive, about 20 volume percent 33-344 resin bond (a bis phenol-A modified phenolic resole resin obtained from DurezÂ® Corporation of Dallas, TX), and about 76 volume percent granular sugar. The second mixture (used in the fabrication of wheel 7-B) included about 6 volume percent diamond abrasive, about 30 volume percent 29-346 resin bond (a long flow phenolic novolac resin obtained from DurezÂ® Corporation of Dallas, TX), and about 64 volume percent granular sugar. The third mixture (used in the fabrication of wheel 7-C) included about 6 volume percent diamond abrasive, about 30 volume percent 29-108 resin bond (a very long flow biphenol-A modified resole obtained from DurezÂ® Corporation of Dallas, TX), and about 64 volume percent granular sugar.<br>
The resin/abrasive/sugar mixtures were paired into disk shaped steel molds, leveled, and pressed at a temperature of about 135Â°C at a pressure of about 4100 psi (28 MPa) for about 30 minutes until a matrix with approximately 99% theoretical density is achieved. After cooling the disks were lightly sanded with 180 grit sandpaper to remove the mold skin and the sugar dispersoid removed by immersing in boiling water for approximately 2 hours. After sugar removal the disks were dried and baked to complete the curing of the resin. The drying and baking cycle was as follows. The disks were first ramped to 60Â°C with a ramp time of about 5 minutes and held thereat for about 25 minutes. The disks were then ramped to 90Â°C with a ramp time of about 30 minutes and held thereat for 5 hours. Finally, the disks were ramped to 160Â°C with a ramp time of about 4 hours and held thereat for about 5 hours. After baking the disks were cooled to room temperature and milled into segments for use in assembling grinding wheels.<br>

Results for the grinding test of Example 7 are shown below in Table 6. Two-hundred wafers were fine ground using the porous, resin-bonded wheels of this invention (wheels 7-A, 7-B, and 7-C). Each of the inventive wheels exhibited relatively stable peak normal force of about 90 N (i.e., about 20 lbs) for at least two-hundred wafers. This type of grinding performance is highly desirable in backgrinding silicon wafers because these relatively low force, steady state conditions minimize thermal and mechanical damage to the workpiece. Further, the porous wheel of this invention provided for the highly desirable grinding performance described above for at least two-hundred wafers without the need for dressing of the wheel.<br>
Additionally, the resin-type was observed to effect the wear rate of the grinding wheel. Wheels 7-A and 7-C exhibited relatively high wear rates of 2.2 and 1.7 microns per wafer, respectively, while wheel 7-B (including the long flow phenolic novolac resin) exhibited a relatively low (and desirable) wear rate of 0.5 microns per wafer.<br>
In summary, Example 7 shows that the inventive wheels including organic bond provide for highly desirable backgrinding performance on silicon wafers.<br>
