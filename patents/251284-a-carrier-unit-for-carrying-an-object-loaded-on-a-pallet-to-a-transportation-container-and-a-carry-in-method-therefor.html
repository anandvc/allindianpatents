				<td>SPECIFICATION<br>
APPARATUS FOR CARRYING ARTICLE, METHOD OF CARRYING ARTICLE OUT FROM TRANSPORTATION CONTAINER BY USING THE APPARATUS, AND METHOD OF CARRYING ARTICLE INTO TRANSPORTATION CONTAINER BY USING THE APPARATUS<br>
[Technical Field] [OOO1]<br>
The present invention relates to a carrier unit for a carrying object, a carry-out method of a carrying object from a. transportation container using the same and a carry-in method of a carrying object into the transportation container using the same. More specifically, the present invention relates to a carrier unit capable of carrying various kinds of carrying objects to the transportation container and carrying the carrying objects with the safety with a cheap, simple structure, a carry-out method of the carrying object from the transportation container and a carry-in method of the carrying object into the transportation container.<br>
[BACKGROUND. ART]	<br>
[0002]<br>
Conventionally as a transportation method for freight with trucks, railroads, ships and the like, generally, container transportation with a container has been well known. A number of types of the containers are selectable depending on the application purpose and of them, dry container possesses the largest quantity of its units, costs cheap and is easy to obtain.<br>
1<br><br>
However, because an opening portion is formed on only a single end side, loading (hereinafter called vanning) of heavy freight, long freight, bulky freight and the like into the dry container and unloading (hereinafter called devanning) are very difficult.<br>
Although a special container such as flat container and open top container enables freight lifted with a crane and the like from a ceiling to be loaded into or unloaded from a container when it is opened, such a special container is more expensive than the dry container and the circulated quantity thereof is small and hence, it is not easy to obtain. [0003]<br>
Accordingly, to solve the above-described problem, the<br>
same inventor as this application has proposed a carrier unit<br>
and method capable of carrying various kinds of carrying objects<br>
to containers (particularly dry container) through a pallet (see,<br>
for example, patent documents 1-3).<br>
[0004]	<br>
For example, according to the above-mentioned patent documents 1, 2. a stage side lift and rolling means capable of lifting up/down a carrying object loading pallet and moving horizontally for supporting is provided on the floor surface of a stage adjacent to the side of the opening portion of a container and a container side lift and rolling means capable of lifting up/down the carrying object loading pallet and moving horizontally for supporting is provided on the floor surface of a container and the carrying object loading pallet can be exchanged between the stage side lift and rolling means and the container side lift and rolling means. Consequently, heavy freight, long freight, bulky freight and the like can be carried<br>
2	:<br><br>
effectively to a container in a distribution center, C-F-S (container freight station) and the like which handle a number of kinds of freight in large quantities. As a result, the container transportation of the heavy freight, long freight, bulky freight and the like can be achieved. [0005]<br>
However, according to the patent documents 1, 2, two carrying means, stage side lift and rolling means and container side lift and rolling means, need to be provided and hence, this costs relatively high. Further, because the carrying object loading pallet is carried to an accurate carrying position on the container or stage, it is necessary to provide a special large size carrying means (for example, push â€¢ pull mechanism and the like) and drive and control this accurately.<br>
At places which do not need to handle a large quantity of freight frequently (for example, freight receiver side overseas and the like), even if carrying efficiency drops more or less, appearance of a carrier unit capable of carrying a carrying object at a relatively cheap price, with a simple structure and with the safety has been demanded. [0006]<br>
For example, the above-mentioned patent document 3 has disclosed such a method in which the carrying object loading pallet is floated from the floor surface and carried with an air floating type carrier unit operated by an operator between a container and a stage adjacent to the side of the opening portion of the container. Consequently, a plurality of pieces of freight (particularly coil-like steel material and the like) having a size about 1/4 the entire length of the container can<br>
3<br><br>
be carried to the container efficiently.;<br>
However, according to the patent document 3, heavy-freight, long freight, bulky freight and the like having a size similar to the entire length of the container cannot be carried. [0007]<br>
Conventionally, railroad transportation of heavy freight such as a press die with the container has been demanded. However, there is a fear that the floor of the container may collapse so that the freight is damaged due to vibration for a long time of the railroad transportation and an impact upon jointing and hence, the railroad transportation of the heavy freight has not been achieved. Particularly, in case of the press die, usually, a measuring instrument (called checking/fixture in other words) for measuring the formation precision of a die is carried at the same time'. Because this measuring instrument is likely to be affected by vibration and impact, the press die is not suitable for railroad transportation. [0008]<br>
When a freight loading pallet is carried into<br>
particularly a dry container through an opening portion at an end in the longitudinal direction, that freight loading pallet needs to be carried straight (with straight advancing performance). That is, unless the freight loading pallet is carried straight to the dry container, the problems (l)-(3) occur.<br>
(1)  The freight loading pallet is carried into the dry container in a tilt condition, so that when carry-out of the freight the freight pallet rubs (makes a frictional contact<br>
	4<br><br>
with) the inner wall of the dry container and hence, carry-out of the freight loading pallet is very difficult. (2)  When a plurality of freight loading pallets are carried into the dry container successively by a plurality of carrying procedures, for example, two freight loading pallets about 20 feet long are carried successively into a dry container 40 feet long by two carrying procedures, if a first freight loading pallet (freight loading pallet to be carried to the deep side of the dry container) is carried in the tilt condition, a second freight pallet {freight loading pallet to be carried in to the forward side (side of the opening portion) of the dry container} cannot be carried into the container completely. (3)  The freight loading pallet collides with the inner wall of the dry container and consequently, the freight loading pallet and the inner walls of the dry container are damaged. [0009]<br>

25. to 28. wherein said transportation container is loaded on<br>
the chassis of a vehicle.<br>
[Effects of the Invention] [0012]<br>
According to the carrier unit for the carrying object of the present invention, the carrying object loading pallet is supported by the pallet supporting member such that it is floated from the floor surface and carried horizontally with that floating condition. During that carrying, the pallet supporting member is lifted down and the carrying object loading pallet is placed on the floor surface so as to stop its traveling. Because the carrying object is carried to the<br>
17<br><br>
transportation container with a single carrier unit, the structure can be cheaper and simpler than a case where two carrying means are provided. Further, because the carrying object loading pallet is placed on the floor surface by lifting down the pallet supporting member so as to stop its traveling, any complicated drive control is not necessary unlike conventionally, so that the carrying object can be positioned at an accurate carrying position and the carrying object can be carried with the safety.<br>
Further, in case where the lift operation means has an expandable member, the pipe and the opening/closing valve mechanism, a hejavier carrying object can be lifted up/down and the carrying object can be positioned at a more accurate carrying position.<br>
In case where the present invention further comprises a contact portion and the opening/closing valve mechanism has a fluid discharge contact valve, the structure can be made cheaper and simpler and the carrying object can be positioned at a more accurate carrying position and the carrying work can be executed more safely and smoothly.<br>
Further, in case where the present invention further comprises a remote control portion and the opening/closing valve mechanism has a fluid discharge operation valve, the structure can be made cheaper and simpler and the carrying object can be positioned at a more accurate carrying position and the carrying work can be executed more safely and smoothly.<br>
In case where the present invention further comprises a guided portion which is guided by the guide means provided corresponding to a traveling region, the carrying object can be<br>
18<br><br>
carried with an excellent straight advancing performance.<br>
In case where the pallet has a pallet side guided portion which is guided by the guide means provided corresponding to the traveling region, the carrying object can be carried with an excellent straight advancing performance.<br>
In case where the guide means has a guide main body, a traveling portion and a lift portion, installation/removal of the guide means on/from a transportation container and stage can be executed easily and rapidly.<br>
In case where the present invention further comprises a joint portion which can be jointed with a handling means, the carrier unit can be handled easily.<br>
In case where the present invention further comprises an engaging portion capable of engaging a handling portion of the handling means, the carrier unit can be handled easily.<br>
In case where the engaging portion has an engaging member capable of emerging/submerging from/into the supporting plane of said pallet supporting member, the carrier unit can be handled : easily.<br>
Further, in case where the present invention further comprises a joint/release portion for jointing/releasing the carrier unit with/from other carrier unit, it can be jointed with other carrier unit corresponding to the kind of the carrying object, whereby the present invention can correspond to more diversified kinds of carrying objects.<br>
In case where the traveling means is comprised of a number of rotation rollers supported rotatably on the bottom face of the base member, the structure can be formed lighter and with a higher strength.<br>
19<br><br>
According to the carry-out method of the carrying object from the transportation container of the present invention, a pallet loaded with a carrying object accommodated within the transportation container is supported by the pallet supporting member in conditions in which it is floated from the floor surface, it is carried horizontally with that floating condition. During that carrying, the pallet supporting member is lifted down and the carrying object loading pallet is placed on the floor surface on the side of the opening portion of the transportation container so as to stop the traveling of the carrier unit. After that, the carrying object loading pallet placed on the floor surface can be carried out of the transportation container with a handling means such as a fork lift, crane. Consequently, the carrying object can be carried out with the safety in conditions in which the transportation container is loaded on the chassis of a vehicle and a cheap, simple carry-out work can be achieved.<br>
According to the other carry-out method of the carrying object from the transportation container of the present invention, the carrying object loading pallet accommodated in the transportation container is supported by the pallet supporting member in conditions in which it is floated from the floor surface and carried horizontally with that floating condition. Then, during that carrying, the pallet supporting member is lifted down and the carrying object loading pallet is placed on the floor surface of the stage so as to stop the traveling of the.carrier unit. Consequently, a heavy, long and bulky carrying object can be carried from the transportation container with the safety using the stage.<br>
20<br><br>
According to still other carry-out method of the carrying object from transportation container of the present invention, the carrying object loading pallet accommodated in the transportation container is supported by the pallet supporting member in conditions in which it is floated from the floor surface and carried horizontally with that floating condition. Then, during that carrying, the pallet supporting member is lifted down and the carrying object loading pallet is placed on the floor surface on the side of the opening portion of the transportation container so as to stop the traveling of the carrier unit. After that, the carrying object loading pallet placed on the floor surface can be carried out of the transportation container with a handling means such as a fork lift, crane. Consequently, the carrying object can be carried from the transportation container with the safety using the movable stage.<br>
In case where the stage comprises a leveling mechanism and prior to the carry-out of the carrying object, the height level of the floor surface of the transportation container is adjusted with the leveling mechanism, the carrying object can be carried out more smoothly.<br>
In case where the pallet supporting member is raised by expanding the expandable member by supplying fluid to the expandable member constituting the lift operation means and the pallet supporting member is lifted down by contracting the expandable member by discharging fluid from the expandable member, a heavier carrying object can be carried.<br>
In case where the fluid discharge contact valve provided on the contact portion of the carrier unit makes contact with a<br>
21<br><br>
stopper member provided corresponding to a traveling stop position preliminarily determined during traveling of the carrier unit and fluid supplied to the expandable member is discharged so as to lift down the pallet supporting member, a cheap carrying object can be positioned at an accurate carrying position and the carrying object can be carried with more safety and a cheaper, simpler carrying operation can be realized.<br>
In case where the fluid discharge operation valve provided on the remote control portion jointed with the carrier unit is operated with the fingers during traveling of the carrier unit so as to discharge fluid supplied to the expandable member to lift down the pallet supporting member, the carrying object can be positioned at a more accurate carrying position and the carrying object can be carried with more safety and a cheaper, simpler carrying operation can be realized.<br>
In case where at least one of a guided portion provided on the carrier unit and a pallet side guided portion provided on the pallet is guided by a guide means provided corresponding to a traveling region during traveling of the carrier unit, the carrying object can be carried with an excellent straight advancing performance.<br>
In case where if a single pallet is employed, it is independently substantially consistent with the size of a plan shape inside the transportation container while if two or more pallets are employed, the combined pallets are substantially consistent with the size of the plan shape inside the transportation container, fixing/release operation for the pallet to the transportation container can be minimized.<br>
In case where the pallet comprises a pallet main body, a<br>
22<br><br>
loading portion and a leg portion and the loading portion has a carrying object fixing tool which is supported movably along the horizontal plane and capable of being positioned at a predetermined position, it can be fixed corresponding to carrying objects (particularly, a press die and the like) having diversified contours.<br>
In case where the carrying object fixing tool is<br>
supported through an elastic tool, it is possible to suppress an influence of vibration, impact and the like at the time of transportation upon a carrying object (particularly, measuring instrument such as a press die) fixed with the carrying object fixing tool. As a result, railroad transportation of a press die which is conventionally very difficult can be realized.<br>
If the transportation container is placed on the chassis of a vehicle, the transportation container does not have to be placed on the ground floor and the carrying object can be carried more effectively.<br>
According to the carry-in method of the carrying object into the transportation container of the present invention, the carrying object loading pallet placed on the floor surface on the side of the opening portion of the transportation container is supported by the pallet supporting member in conditions in which it is floated from the floor surface and carried horizontally with that floating condition. During that carry, the pallet supporting member is lifted down and the carrying object loading pallet is placed on the floor surface of the transportation container so as to stop the traveling of the carrier unit. Consequently, the carrying object can be carried in conditions in which the transportation container is placed on<br>
23<br><br>
the chassis of a vehicle and a cheaper, simpler carry-in operation can be achieved.<br>
According to other carry-in method of the carrying object into the transportation container of the present invention, the carrying object loading pallet placed on the floor surface of the stage is supported by the pallet supporting member in conditions in which it is floated from the floor surface and carried horizontally with that floating condition. Then, during the carry, the pallet supporting member is lifted down and the carrying object loading pallet is placed on the floor surface of the transportation container so as to stop the traveling of the carrier unit. Consequently, a heavy, long and bulky carrying object can be carried into the transportation container using the stage.<br>
According to still other carry-in method of the carrying object into thes transportation container of the present invention, the carrying object loading pallet placed on the floor surface on the side of the opening portion of the transportation container is supported by the pallet supporting member in conditions in which it is floated from the floor surface and carried horizontally with that floating condition. During the traveling, the pallet supporting member is lifted down and the carrying object loading pallet is placed on the floor surface of the transportation container so as to stop the traveling of the carrier unit. Consequently, the carrying object can be carried into the transportation container using the movable stage.<br>
In case where the stage comprises a leveling mechanism and prior to the carry-in of the carrying object, the height<br>
24<br><br>
level of the floor surface of the transportation container is adjusted with the leveling mechanism, the carrying object can be carried in more smoothly.<br>
In case where the pallet supporting member is raised by expanding the expandable member by supplying fluid to the expandable member constituting the lift operation means and the pallet supporting member is lifted down by contracting the expandable member by discharging fluid from the expandable member, a heavier carrying object can be carried.<br>
In case where the fluid discharge contact valve provided on the contact portion of the carrier unit makes contact with a stopper member provided corresponding to a traveling stop position preliminarily determined during traveling of the carrier unit and fluid supplied to the expandable member is discharged so as to lift down the pallet supporting member, a cheap carrying object can be positioned at an accurate carrying position and the carrying object can be carried with more safety and a cheaper, simpler carrying operation can be realized.<br>
In case where the fluid discharge operation valve provided on the remote control portion jointed with the carrier unit is operated with the fingers during traveling of the carrier unit so as to discharge fluid supplied to the expandable member to lift down the pallet supporting member, the carrying object can be positioned at a more accurate carrying position and the carrying object can be carried with more safety and a cheaper, simpler carrying operation can be realized.<br>
In case where at least one of a guided portion provided on the carrier unit and a pallet side guided portion provided on said pallet is guided by a guide means provided corresponding to<br>
25<br><br>
traveling region during traveling of the carrier unit, the carrying object can be carried with an excellent straight advancing performance.<br>

[BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION]<br>
[0015]<br>
1.  Carrier unit for carrying object<br>
The carrier unit for a carrying object according to the present invention comprises a base member, a traveling means, a pallet supporting member and a lift operation means and is capable of carrying a carrying object to a transportation container through a pallet. This carrier unit can contain one or two or more combinations of, for example, a contact portion, a remote control portion, a guided portion, a joint portion, an engaging portion and a joint/release portion described later. [0016]<br>
The above-mentioned "transportation container" is not limited to any particular structure, size, material and the like as long as it can store a pallet (hereinafter referred to as just a carrying object loading pallet also depending on the case) loaded with a carrying object. Usually, this transportation container has a rectangular floor surface and its longitudinal direction is a carrying direction of a carrying object. As this transportation container, it is possible to mention, for example, a dry container, reefer container, an open top container, a flat container and the like. Of them, it is preferred to be a dry container or a reefer container. The reason is that they circulate most, are cheap and easy to obtain. Usually, this dry container has a rectangular floor surface and an opening portion at an end in the longitudinal direction thereof. Upon transportation with a carrier unit described later, this transportation container is placed on, for example, the chassis of a vehicle such as a truck or taken off the<br>
35<br><br>
chassis and placed on ground floor. [0017]<br>
The above-described "carrying object" is not limited to any particular type, size, weight and the like as long as it can be stored in the transportation container through a pallet. As the type of this carrying object, it is possible to mention, for example, die, machine tool, automobile, automobile parts, electric appliance, concrete pile, pre-cast concrete, fruits, miscellaneous commodities and the like. Further, as this carrying object, it is possible to mention, for example, a sheet-like product, a coil-like product, a long product, a rod-like product, a lump-like product and the like. As the material of these products, it is possible to mention, for example, steel material, stainless steel, aluminum material, plastic material, glass material, stone (for example, tomb stone), wood and the like. As the weight of the carrying object, it is possible to mention, for example, a weight of about 100 kg-50 ton. Generally, the weight is about 1 ton - 20 ton. If this carrying object is a coil-like product obtained by winding a belt-like material or linear material, this coil-like product is preferred to be stored in the transportation container such that its axis is perpendicular to a carrying direction (longitudinal direction) of the transportation container. The reason is to prevent a wound body of a coil-like product from jumping out in the carrying direction when the transportation container is transported. [0018]<br>
The above-mentioned "pallet" is not limited to any particular structure, size, material and the like as long as it<br>
36<br><br>
is capable of loading a carrying object. The pallet can be substantially matched with the size of an internal flat surface of the transportation container independently if a single unit is employed or if two or more units are employed, by combining them. If the pallet is designed into a module (standardized) based on the length of the floor surface of the transportation container in the longitudinal direction, the work for fixing and releasing of the pallet to/from the transportation container can be minimized.<br>
The above-mentioned "the pallet can be substantially matched with the size of an internal flat surface of the transportation container independently if a single unit is employed or if two or more units are employed, by combining them" means that if the bottom face of this pallet is regarded as rectangular, the pallet can be formed into a shape and size substantially matching with the bottom face of the transportation container. Further, the bottom face shape obtained by combining two or more unit of the pallets diversified in size and shape can be formed into a shape and size substantially matching with the transportation container. In the pallet used under this combination, for example, the shape of the pallet can be formed into a shape 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5 and so on the long side (or short side) of the floor face of the transportation container. Likewise, the floor face may be formed by combination of pallets 1/6, 2/6, 3/6 and so forth or combining pallets not equally divided such as 2/5, 3/5. Further, it is permissible to use pallets obtained by dividing equally to six sections by dividing its long side to three and its short side to two, that is, pallets obtained by dividing both the long<br>
37<br><br>
side and short side. [0019]<br>
The aforementioned pallet comprises, for example, a pallet main body, a loading portion provided on the top side of this pallet main body and for supporting the carrying object and a leg portion provided below this pallet main body and making a contact with the floor surface. A bottom open space in which at least one of the bottom and side is open is formed below this pallet main body. As this loading portion, it is possible to mention, for example, (1) a configuration having a plurality of band fixing holes provided at positions along the contour of the plan shape of a plurality of sheet-like (or lump-like) carrying objects each having a different plan shape, (2) a configuration having a pair of slopes opposing each other capable of supporting a coil-like carrying object such that it makes contact with an outer peripheral face of the carrying object (see FIG. 10), (3) a configuration having a supporting portion for supporting a plurality of long carrying objects by restricting a move thereof in the longitudinal direction (see FIGS. 37, 38), and (4) a configuration having carrying object fixing tools which is supported movably along the horizontal surface and can be located at a predetermined position (see FIGS. 32-34). The pallet loading portion according to the configuration (4) comprises, for example, a plurality of lower base members and a plurality of upper base members provided perpendicular to the top face of these lower base members. This lower base member is provided with a base member fixing tool for fixing the upper base member movably along the longitudinal direction and the upper base member can be provided with the<br>
38<br><br>
carrying object fixing tools which are movable along the longitudinal direction. Consequently, carrying objects having various contours (particularly, press die or the like) can be fixed corresponding thereto. In this case, it is preferable to support the carrying object fixing tools on the upper base member and/or the lower base member through elastic tools (for example, rubber member, spring, buffering mechanism or the like). Consequently, it is possible to restrict a vibration or impact upon transportation from affecting a carrying object (particularly, measuring instrument for press die) fixed with the carrying object fixing tools. In the meantime, as the fixing tool, for example, a screw fixing tool, clamping tool, a hook and the like can be mentioned.<br>
Although the bottom open space is used as a space in which mainly the carrier unit or part thereof is inserted, it can be employed as a space for fixing a fixing member for fixing the carrying object on the loading portion or for other arbitrary purpose.<br>
Meanwhile, the above-described "at least one side is open" means that that direction does not have to be all open but the requirement is satisfied if only any one of "front", "rear", "right" and "left" is open. That is, the "bottom open space" may be constructed that only the "bottom" and "rear" are open. [0020]<br>
The pallet can further comprise a joint/release means for jointing/releasing the pallet main body with/from a pallet main body of other pallet. Consequently, it is possible to provide a pallet which is capable of selecting joint or non-joint of a plurality of pallets appropriately depending on the type of a<br>
39<br><br>
carrying object (for example, size, shape and the like) and has a versatility corresponding to diversified kinds of carrying objects. As the joint style, it is possible to mention a device using, for example, screwing, fitting, engagement, joining, nipping and the like. This joint/release means can be disposed at corners of the loading face for a carrying object of the pallet main body. Consequently, the joint operation performance can be improved and the space efficiency of the loading face for . the carrying object can be improved. [0021]<br>
The pallet can possess a pallet side guided portion which is guided by a guide means described later. This pallet side guided portion can possess a combination of one or two or mote of, for example, a rotation roller, a rolling ball, a guide face and the like. [0022]<br>
The structure, size and the like of the "base member" are not restricted to any particular ones. This base member can possess, for example, a substantially U shaped longitudinal sectional shape. This base member can be formed to extend along the carrying direction (longitudinal direction of the transportation container) of a carrying object. In this case, it is preferable to provide a plurality of pieces in parallel (preferably, a pair of the right and left). The reason is to have a structure having a light weight and a high strength. Particularly, the plan shape of this base member is preferred to be of substantially the same shape as the plan shape of a pallet supporting member described later. [0023]<br>
40<br><br>
The aforementioned "traveling means" is not limited to any particular structure, traveling type and the like as long as it is provided on the bottom side of the base member and capable of traveling on the floor surface. This traveling means is a means for reciprocating the carrier unit along a carrying direction (longitudinal direction of the transportation container) of a specific carrying object. As this traveling means, for example, it is possible to pick up (1) a configuration having a rolling member supported rotatably on the bottom side of the base member and (2) a configuration having the rolling member and a driving means (for example, an air motor) for driving this rolling member. It is preferable to have the configuration (1) having no means for driving the rolling member because it can be structured at a cheap price easily. According to the configuration (1), usually, an external force is applied to the carrier unit or the carrying object loading pallet by a loading means or by human power, thereby enabling the carrier unit to run on the floor surface through the rolling member. According to the configuration (2), although the carrier unit can be run on the floor by the rolling member driven by the driving means, it is permissible to run the carrier unit on the floor surface by giving an external force to the carrier unit and the carrying object loading pallet. In the meantime, as the rolling member, for example, a rotation roller, a rolling ball, a rotating wheel, an endless belt and the like can be mentioned. It is preferable to employ a number of the rotation rollers because of light weight and high strength structure. [0024]<br>
	41 <br><br>
The "pallet supporting member" is not limited to any particular structure, supporting type and the like as long as it is provided on the base member such that it is capable of lifting up/down and capable of supporting the pallet from below. Usually, this pallet supporting member has a pallet supporting face which makes contact with the bottom side of the pallet. This pallet supporting member can possess, for example, a substantially U shaped longitudinal sectional shape. This pallet supporting member can be formed to extend along the carrying direction (longitudinal direction of the transportation container) of the carrying object. In this case, it is preferable to provide a plurality of pieces (preferably a pair of the right and left) in parallel. This reason is to secure a light weight, high strength structure. Particularly, it is preferable that at least one ends of a plurality of pallet supporting members in parallel are joined to each other through a joint member.<br>
The pallet supporting member can be formed into a module (standardized) based on the length in the longitudinal direction of the floor surface of the transportation container. Consequently, the aforementioned module pallet can be supported preferably by this pallet supporting member. [0025]<br>
The "lift operation means" is not limited to any particular structure, lifting type and the like as long as it is capable of lifting up/down the pallet supporting means. This lift operation means is so constructed to descend the pallet supporting member in an ascent condition during a traveling by the traveling means so as to place the pallet supported by this<br>
42<br><br>
pallet supporting member on the floor surface so as to stop the traveling. Consequently, when the carrying object loading pallet makes a contact with the floor surface, the carrier unit can be stopped from traveling. As a result, the carrying object loading pallet, that is, a carrying object can be positioned easily at an accurate transportation position. As the lift operation means, it is possible to mention, for example, an expandable mechanism, a jack mechanism, a link mechanism, a gear mechanism, a cylinder mechanism and the like.<br>
This lift operation means can comprise, for example, an expandable member which is provided between the base member and the pallet supporting member and expanded/contracted by supplying/discharging fluid (usually, gas (particularly, air)), a pipe for communicating this expandable member with a fluid supply source and an opening/closing valve mechanism which is provided halfway of this pipe and for supplying/discharging fluid to this expandable member. Consequently, a heavy carrying object can be lifted up/down and positioned at a more accurate transportation position. The expandable member can be, for example, a tube-like member. Further, the pipe may be connected to the expandable member through its one end and provided with a connecting portion for connecting other pipe communicating with the fluid supply source. This connecting portion may be disposed on an end face in the carrying direction of the base member and/or the pallet supporting member. Consequently, connecting operation of the pipe can be carried out easily.<br>
The opening/closing valve mechanism may be constructed of one or two or more opening/closing valves. As this opening/closing valve, a valve, an electromagnetic valve and the<br>
43<br><br>
like having an operating portion such as a push button and roller can be mentioned. This opening/closing valve mechanism can contain, for example, the fluid discharge contact valve and/or a fluid discharge operation valve described later. This fluid discharge contact valve makes contact with a stopper member provided at a contact portion described later and making contact with a.stopper member described later so as to change over its flow passage to discharge fluid supplied to the expandable member. In the meantime, this fluid discharge contact valve is capable of discharging fluid supplied to the expandable member by changing over the flow passage by an operation by an operator. The fluid discharge operation valve discharges fluid supplied to the expandable member by changing over a flow passage by operating a remote control portion described later with the fingers (for example, push button operation, lever tilting operation and the like). From viewpoints of ability of intensifying the safety, the opening/closing valve mechanism is preferred to have both the fluid discharge contact valve and the fluid discharge operation valve. This opening/closing valve mechanism may contain a fluid supply operation valve for supplying fluid to the expandable member by changing over its flow passage by operation with the fingers. [0026]<br>
The aforementioned "contact portion" is not limited to any particular structure, contact type, quantity, shape and the like as long as it is capable of making contact with a stopper member described later. This contact portion may contain, for example, a detection sensor for detecting a contact when it<br>
'	44<br><br>
makes contact with the stopper member. Consequently, the pallet supporting member can be automatically lifted down by the lift operation means based on a detection signal of the detection sensor. The contact portion may have, for example, the fluid discharge contact valve. Consequently, fluid supplied to the expandable member based on a change-over of the flow passage in the fluid discharge contact valve is discharged so as to automatically lift down the pallet supporting member. The contact portion may contain, for example, the fluid discharge contact valve and a guard member which surrounds the outer periphery of this fluid discharge contact valve. Consequently, the operability of the fluid discharge contact valve can be improved. Further, this contact portion may be disposed on an end face side in the carrying direction of, for example, the base member and/or the pallet supporting member. As a result, the contact portion and the stopper member can be brought into contact with each other securely. Particularly, this contact portion is preferred to be provided in plural quantities (preferably, a pair of the right and left) along the width direction (direction perpendicular to the carrying direction) of the carrier unit. [0027]<br>
The aforementioned "stopper member" is not limited to any particular structure, disposition position, quantity, shape and the like as long as it is provided corresponding to a traveling stop position of the carrier unit specified preliminarily. This stopper member makes contact with the contact portion to restrict a traveling of the carrier unit. This stopper member may be provided for example, on the opening portion side of the<br>
45<br><br>
transportation container. Consequently, as described in the transportation method described later, any carrying object can be transported without using any expensive stage having a leveling mechanism. In this case, this stopper member is preferred to be attached to a corner metal on the opening side of the transportation container. The reason is that the stopper member can be attached or detached easily using the corner metal provided in the transportation container (particularly, container). In the meantime, the corner metal is used for fixing the chassis on the transportation container, fixing the transportation containers in a ship and hoisting with a crane or gantry crane. This metal is provided on each vertex (vertical direction) of the transportation container. The stopper member may be provided on a stage adjacent to the opening portion side of the transportation container.. Consequently, a heavier, longer or more bulky carrying object can be transported using the stage. The stopper member may be fixed on, for example, the inner wall surface or floor surface of the transportation container. Further, this stopper member may be constructed of, for example, an inner wall face (particularly, inner wall surface on deep side) of the transportation container.<br>
As this stopper member, for example, it is possible to mention (1) a configuration comprising a base portion having a substantially same length as the width of the transportation container, a screwing portion which is provided on both ends of this base member and to be screwed with the corner metal on the transportation container and a stopper piece provided at a specified position in the longitudinal direction of this base member, (2) a configuration comprising the base portion having<br>
46<br><br>
substantially same length as the width of the transportation container, a fixing portion which is provided on both ends of this base member and can be fixed on both side wall faces of the container and the stopper piece provided at a predetermined position in the longitudinal direction of this base member. [0028]<br>
The aforementioned "remote control portion" is not limited to any particular structure, shape, control operation and the like as long as it is a portion for controlling various 
The aforementioned "guided portion"-is not limited to any particular structure, guided type and the like as long as it is guided by a guide means described later. This guided portion may possess a combination of one or two or more of the rotation roller, rolling ball, guide face and the like. This guided portion is preferred to possess the rotation roller and/or the<br>
47<br><br>
rolling ball from viewpoints of being guided. This guided portion may be provided at the base member and/or the pallet supporting member of the carrier unit. From the viewpoints of being guided, this guided portion is preferred to be provided in plural quantities along the carrying direction of the carrying object. [0030]<br>
The aforementioned 'guide means" is not limited to any particular structure, guide type and the like as long as it is provided corresponding to a traveling region. This guide means is a means for guiding the guided portion of the carrier unit and/or the pallet side guided portion of the pallet. The "provision corresponding to the traveling region" described above includes not only a configuration in which the carrier unit is provided within the traveling region but also a configuration in which the carrier unit is provided at a portion proximate to the traveling region as long as the guided portion and/or the pallet side guided portion can be guided. [0031]<br>
The aforementioned guide means may be, for example, a guide tool having a long guide main body extending along the carrying direction of the carrying object. As the longitudinal sectional shape of this guide main body, for example, U shape, C shape, H shape, L shape, angular shape, ring shape, flat shape, irregular shape and the like can be mentioned. Further, this guide main body may possess a combination of one or two or more types of the guide face, rotation roller, rolling ball and the like. The guide main body is preferred to have a guide face from viewpoints of being guided. As the disposition type of<br>
48<br><br>
this guide main body, it is possible to mention, for example, (1) a configuration in which the guide main body is provided on the floor surface of the transportation container, (2) a configuration in which it is provided on the floor surface of a stage adjacent to the opening end side of the transportation container and (3) a configuration in which it is provided over the floor surface of the transportation container and the stage can be mentioned. In these cases, the guide main body, for example, may be installed on the floor surface or fixed on the floor surface with an appropriate fixing means (for example, clamp device, engaging device, screwing device and the like). In the meantime, the guide main body may be provided on an inner wall of the transportation container. [0032]<br>
The guide means may comprise, for example, the<br>
aforementioned guide main body, a traveling portion for running this guide main body and a lift portion which is provided between the guide main body and the traveling portion for lifting up/down the guide main body. The guide main body may comprise, for example, a flat floor portion which allows the traveling means of the carrier unit to run and a guide wall portion which is erected from both sides of this floor portion for guiding the guided portion of the carrier unitâ€¢ Consequently, the guide means can be run with the carrier unit loaded, thereby installation and removal of the guide means being carried out easily and rapidly. As the aforementioned traveling portion, for example, a rotation roller, rolling ball, endless belt and the like can be mentioned. Further, as the lift portion, for example, cylinder mechanism, link mechanism<br>
49<br><br>
and the like can be mentioned. The lift portion is preferred to comprise a lift member which is supported by the guide main body-such that it can be lifted up/down freely and has the traveling portion and an elastic member (for example, spring member, rubber member and the like) for urging the guide main body upward with respect to the lift member provided between this lift member and the guide main body. In the meantime, the urging force of the elastic member is set to a value larger than the weight of the guide main body and the carrier unit. Further, The lift portion may comprise, for example, a lift member which is supported by the guide main body such that it can be lifted up/down freely, and an expandable member which is provided between this lift member and the guide main body and expanded/contracted by supplying/discharging fluid (usually, gas (particularly, air)). [0033]<br>
The guide means may be constituted of for example, the inner wall of the transportation container. Consequently, when a carrying object is carried (carried in/carried out) to a transportation container, the guided portion of the carrier unit and/or the pallet side guided portion of the pallet are guided by the inner wall face of the transportation container thereby securing an excellent straight advancing performance.<br>
The guide means may be constituted of the leg portion of the pallet. Consequently, when carrier unit is advanced into the bottom open space in the pallet, the guided portion of the carrier unit is guided by the leg portion of the pallet thereby securing an excellent advancing performance. [0034]<br>
50<br><br>
The aforementioned "joint portion" is not limited to any particular structure, joint type, quantity and the like as long as it can be connected to a handling means such as a fork lift, winch (winding machine), push mechanism, a pull mechanism and the like. When the handling means joined with this joint portion is driven (moved), usually, the carrier unit is given a horizontal pulling force or pressing force, so that the carrier unit travels on the floor surface through the above-described traveling means. As the joint portion, for example, a ring-like member, a hook-like member, a clamp and the like can be mentioned. This joint portion can be joined to the handling means through a joint portion such as a wire rope and a rod. Further, this joint portion is disposed on an end face side in the carrying direction of the base member and/or the pallet supporting member. Consequently, the joint portion can be engaged or disengaged easily. Particularly, this joint portion is preferred to be provided in plural quantities (preferably, a pair of the right and left) along a direction perpendicular to the carrying direction. [0035]<br>
The aforementioned "engaging portion" is not limited to any particular structure, engagement type, quantity and the like as long as it is capable of engaging the handling portion (for example, pawl of fork lift and the like) of the handling means. If the handling means engaging this engaging portion moves, usually, the carrier unit is lifted up and moved to a desired position. This engaging portion may have an engaging member which can emerge or submerge from/into the supporting face of the pallet supporting member. As shown in FIG. 6, this engaging<br>
51<br><br>
portion comprises a supporting mechanism (25) for supporting the engaging member (24) between a storage position (a) in which the engaging member (24) is accommodated from the pallet supporting face (5a) of the pallet supporting member (5) and a handling position (b) projecting from the pallet supporting face. Further, as shown in FIG. 7, this engaging portion, for example, may have a holding mechanism for holding the engaging member (24) at an engagement position (c) slightly projecting from the pallet supporting face (5a) of the pallet supporting member (5). Consequently, the engaging portion at the engagement position is engaged with a pallet supported by the pallet supporting member and positioned in the pallet carrying direction with respect to the pallet supporting member. Further, the engaging portion, for example, may be disposed on the top face of the base member and/or the pallet supporting member. Consequently, the deflection of the engaging portion can be carried out easily. Further, this engaging portion may be provided in plural quantity along the carrying direction. [0036]<br>
The aforementioned "joint/release portion" is not limited to any particular structure, joint type, quantity and the like as long as it is a portion for jointing/releasing the carrier unit with/from other carrier unit. Provision of this joint/release portion enables a plurality of carrier units to be jointed or not jointed appropriately depending on the types of the carrying object (for example, size, shape and the like), that is. joint or non-joint of the above-described plurality of carrier units thereby providing a highly versatile carrier unit corresponding to multiple kinds of carrying objects. As this<br>
52<br><br>
joint type, for example, types using screwing, fitting, engagement, joint, nipping and the like can be mentioned. This joint/release portion may have a joint lever which can be jointed to a joint object portion (for example, dented portion) formed on other carrier unit and supported such that it is capable of swinging as shown in FIGS. 30, 31. This joint/release portion may be disposed on an end face side in the carrying direction of the base member and/or the pallet supporting member. Consequently, the joint/release operation can be carried out easily. Particularly, this joint/release portion is preferred to be provided in plural quantities along the width direction (direction perpendicular to the carrying direction) of the carrier unit. [0037]<br>
2-a. Carry-out method of carrying object (transportation using no stage)<br>
The carry-out method of carrying object of the present invention concerns a transportation method of carrying object from a transportation container using the above-described carrier unit. First, the carrier unit is moved to the floor surface on an opening portion side of the transportation container and after that, the carrier unit is moved on the floor surface of the transportation container from the opening portion side to its deep side and when it invades the bottom open space on the carrying object loading pallet stored in the transportation container, it is stopped. Next, the pallet supporting member of the carrier unit is lifted up so as to raise the carrying object loading pallet from the floor surface by the pallet supporting member. Next, with the carrying object<br>
53<br><br>
loading pallet raised, the carrier unit is moved on the floor surface of the transportation container from the deep side to the opening portion side. After that, the pallet supporting member is lifted down so that the carrying object loading pallet is placed on the floor surface on the opening portion side of the transportation container so as to stop the moving of the carrier unit. [0038]<br>
According to this carry-out method, for example, first, of a plurality of carrying object loading pallets stored within the transportation container, a carrying object loading pallet placed on the floor surface on the opening portion side of the transportation container is moved to a desired position outside the transportation container and after that, the carrier unit can be moved onto the floor, surface on the opening portion side of the transportation container. In the meantime, the transportation method can be executed only a time or repeatedly two or more time depending on the quantity of the carrying object loading pallets (or carrying object loading pallet joint body) transported from the transportation container.<br>
This carry-out method is not limited to any particular carrier unit, carrying object loading pallet transportation type, traveling type of the carrier unit on the floor and the like. For example, by hoisting with a handling means such as a fork lift, the carrier unit and the carrying object loading pallet can be moved to a desired position. As the traveling type of the carrier unit, it is possible to mention, a combination of one or two or more of (1) a configuration in which the carrier unit is run by man power, (2) it is run with such a handling<br>
54<br><br>
means as fork lift, winch, push mechanism and pull mechanism and (3) a configuration in which a self-traveling carrier unit is run.<br>
Further, according to this carry-out method, although a carrying object can be carried out from the transportation container in conditions in which the transportation container is placed on the ground floor, it is preferable to carry out a carrying object from the transportation container in conditions in which the transportation container is placed on a chassis of a vehicle such as truck. [0039]<br>
According to this carry-out method, for example, the pallet supporting member is lifted up by expanding the expandable member by supplying fluid to the same expandable member constituting the lift operation means and the pallet supporting member is lifted down by contracting the expandable member by discharging fluid from the expandable member.<br>
In this case, as the traveling/stop style of the carrier unit, it is possible to mention, for example, a style (1) in which, when the carrier unit travels with the carrying object loading pallet raised from the floor surface, the contact valve provided on the contact portion of the carrier unit makes contact with the stopper member and fluid supplied to the expandable member is discharged so as to lift down the pallet supporting member and then, the carrying object loading pallet is placed on the floor surface on the opening portion side of the transportation container so as to stop the traveling of the carrier unit, a style (2) in which when the carrier unit travels with the carrying object loading pallet raised from the floor<br>
55<br><br>
surface, the contact valve provided, on the contact portion of the carrier unit is operated by an operator so as to discharge fluid supplied to the expandable member to lift down the pallet supporting member and then, the carrying object loading pallet is placed on the floor surface on the opening portion side of the transportation container so as to stop the traveling of the carrier unit, and a style (3) in which when the carrier unit travels with the carrying object loading pallet raised from the floor, the operation valve provided on a remote control portion to be joined with the carrier unit is operated with the fingers (for example, push button operation, lever tiling operation and the like) so as to discharge fluid supplied to the expandable member to lift down the pallet supporting member and then, the carrying object loading pallet is placed on the floor surface on the opening portion side of the transportation container so as to stop the traveling of the carrier unit. In the meantime, it is preferable to use the (1) and (3) at the same time in order to ensure a higher safety.<br>
The carrying object loading pallet mentioned here refers to a pallet on which a carrying object is placed. As this pallet, for example, a pallet having the same structure as the pallet of the above-described carrier unit can be mentioned. [0040]<br>
According to the above-described carry-out method, for example, the carrier unit and/or the pallet guided portion can be guided by the above-described guide means during a traveling of the carrier unit. Consequently, a carrying object can be carried out with an excellent straight advancing performance. The guide means can travel on the floor surface of the<br>
56<br><br>
transportation container from viewpoints of work efficiency for<br>
installation and removal of the guide means. Further, the guide<br>
means is preferred to be capable of being lifted up/down with<br>
respect to the floor surface of the transportation container.<br>
[0041]	'   .<br>
2-b. Carry-out method of other carrying object (transportation using a stage)<br>
The other carry-out method of carrying object of the present invention concerns a carry-out method of carrying object from the transportation container using the above-described carrier unit. The carrier unit is moved onto the floor surface of a stage adjacent to the opening portion side of the transportation container and after that, the carrier unit is moved on the floor surface of the stage and then, on the floor surface of the transportation container from the opening portion side to the deep side. The carrier unit is stopped when it invades the bottom open space on the carrying object loading pallet stored in the transportation container. Next, the pallet supporting member of the carrier unit is lifted up so as to raise the carrying object loading pallet from the floor surface with the pallet supporting member. With that lifting condition, the carrier unit is moved on the floor surface of the transportation container from the deep side to the opening portion side and then, on the floor surface of the stage after that, the pallet supporting member is lifted down and the carrying object loading pallet is placed on the floor surface of the stage so as to stop the traveling of the carrier unit. [0042]<br>
This carry-out method is not limited to any particular<br>
57<br><br>
carrier unit, transportation style of the carrying object loading pallet, traveling style on the floor surface of the carrier unit and the like. As the transportation style and the traveling style, for example,, the style described in the above-described transportation method (2-a) can be mentioned. In the meantime, the transportation method can be carried out only one time or repeatedly two or more time corresponding to the quantity of the carrying object loading pallets (or carrying object loading pallet joint body) carried out from the transportation container.<br>
According to this carry-out method, although a carrying object can be carried out from the transportation container when it is placed on the floor, preferably, the carrying object is carried out from the transportation container in conditions in which the transportation container is placed on the chassis of a vehicle such as truck.<br>
The aforementioned "stage" is not limited to any<br>
particular structure, shape, size and the like as long as it has a floor surface on substantially the same level as the floor surface of the transportation container and capable of carrying the carrying object loading pallet. Although the floor surface of this stage may be on substantially the same level as the floor surface of the transportation container placed on the floor, it is preferred to be on substantially the same level as the floor surface of the transportation container placed on the chassis of a vehicle such as truck. As this stage, for example, a stage for ceirry out/in, platform, slope and the like can be mentioned. Further, this stage has a leveling mechanism comprising for example, an engaging member capable of<br>
58<br><br>
engaging/disengaging the corner metal on the opening portion side of the transportation container placed on the chassis of a vehicle such as truck, a guide rail for supporting this engaging member such that it is capable of being lifted up/down and a lifting mechanism for lifting this engaging member. Consequently, by lifting up (or down) the engaging member engaging the corner metal of the transportation container, the transportation container is lifted up (or down) and the floor surface of the transportation container can be matched with the floor surface of the stage in terms of height level easily and quickly. In this case, as a stage, it is preferable to provide an existing platform with the leveling mechanism. The reason is that it can be constructed easily at a cheap price. Further, this stage comprises a posture control means for controlling the posture of the floor surface. [0043]<br>
According to this carry-out method, for example, the pallet supporting member can be lifted up by expanding the expandable member by supplying fluid to the expandable member which constitutes the lift operation means and then lifted down by contracting the expandable member by discharging fluid form the same expandable member.<br>
In this case, as the traveling/stop style of the carrier unit, it is possible to mention, for example, a style (1) in which, when the carrier unit travels with the carrying object loading pallet raised from the floor surface, the contact valve provided on the contact portion of the carrier unit makes contact with the stopper member and fluid supplied to the expandable member is discharged so as to lift down the pallet<br>
59<br><br>
and then, the carrying object loading pallet is placed on the stage floor surface so as to stop the traveling of the carrier unit, a style (2) in which when the carrier unit travels with the carrying object loading pallet raised from the floor surface, the contact valve provided on the contact portion of the carrier unit is operated by an operator so as to discharge fluid supplied to the expandable member to lift down the pallet supporting member and then, the carrying object loading pallet is placed on the stage floor surface so as to stop the traveling of the carrier unit, and a style (3) in which when the carrier unit travels with the carrying object loading pallet raised from the floor, the operation valve provided on a remote control portion to be joined with the carrier unit is operated with the fingers (for example, push button operation, lever tiling operation and the like) so as to discharge fluid supplied to the expandable member to lift down the pallet supporting member and then, the carrying object loading pallet is placed on the stage floor surface so as to stop the traveling of the carrier unit. In the meantime, it is preferable to use the (1) and (3) at the same time in order to ensure a higher safety.<br>
The carrying object loading pallet mentioned here refers to a pallet on which a carrying object is placed. As this pallet, for example, a pallet having the same structure as the pallet of the above-described carrier unit can be mentioned. [0044]<br>
According to the above-described carry-out method, for example, the carrier unit and/or the pallet guided portion can be guided by the above-described guide means during a traveling of the carrier unit. Consequently, a carrying object can be<br>
60<br><br>
carried out with an excellent straight advancing performance. The guide means can travel on the floor surface of the transportation container and the stage from viewpoints of work efficiency for installation and removal of the guide means. Further, the guide means is preferred to be capable of being lifted up/down with respect to the floor surface of the transportation container and the stage. [0045]<br>
2-c. Carry-out method of carrying object (transportation using a transportation stage)<br>
The carry-out method of carrying object of the present invention concerns a carry-out method of carrying object from a transportation container using the above-described carrier unit. First, the transportation stage on which the carrier unit is loaded is moved to a position adjacent to the opening portion side of the transportation container and next after the carrier unit is moved on the floor surface of the transportation stage, it is moved on the floor surface of the transportation container from the opening portion side to the deep side. The carrying object accommodated in the transportation container is stopped in conditions in which it has invaded the bottom open space of the pallet loaded with the carrying object accommodated in the transportation container. Next, the pallet supporting member of the carrier unit is lifted up so as to raise the pallet supporting member from the floor surface. After that, the carrier unit is moved on the floor surface of the transportation container from the deep side to the opening portion side with that lift condition and next, the pallet supporting member is lifted down and the pallet is placed on the floor surface on the<br>
61	Â¦<br><br>
opening portion side of the transportation container so as to<br>
stop the traveling of the carrier unit.<br>
[0046]<br>
According to this carry-out method, for example, first, of a plurality of carrying object loading pallets stored in the transportation container, a carrying object loading pallet placed on the floor surface on the opening portion side of the transportation container can be moved to a desired position outside the transportation container. After that, the transportation stage can be moved to a position adjacent to the opening portion side of the transportation container. In the meanwhile, the carry-out method can be executed only once or two or more time repeatedly corresponding to the quantity of the carrying object loading pallets (or carrying object loading pallet joint body) carried out from the transportation container.<br>
This carry-out method is not limited to any particular carrier unit, transportation style of the carrying object loading pallet, traveling style on the floor surface of the carrier unit and the like. For example, by hoisting with the handling means such as a fork lift, the carrier unit and the carrying object loading pallet can be moved to a desired position. As the traveling style of the carrier unit, it is possible to mention, for example, a combination of one or two or more of (1) a configuration in which the carrier unit is run by man power, (2) it is run with such a handling means as fork lift, winch, push mechanism and pull mechanism and (3) a configuration in which a self-traveling carrier unit is run.<br>
Further, according to this carry-out method, although a carrying object can be carried out form the transportation<br>
62<br><br>
container in conditions in which the transportation container is placed on the floor, it is preferable to carry out a carrying object from the transportation container in conditions in which the transportation container is placed on a chassis of a vehicle such as truck. [0047]<br>
The aforementioned "transportation stage" is not limited to any particular structure, shape, size or the like as long as it can be moved by the handling means such as a fork lift and possesses a floor surface on which the carrier unit can travel. This transportation stage is moved to a position adjacent to the opening portion side of the transportation container so that the floor surface is of substantially the same height level as the floor surface of the transportation container. Although the floor surfaces of this transportation stage can be of the same height level as the floor surface of the transportation container placed on the floor, it is preferable to be on substantially the same height level as the floor surface of the transportation container placed on the chassis of a vehicle such as a truck. Although this transportation stage can be moved by the handling means such as a fork lift which moves on the floor surface (ground), it is preferable to be moved by the handling means such as a fork lift which moves on the floor surface of the aforementioned stage such as a platform, slope and the like. [0048]<br>
According to this carry-out method, for example, the pallet supporting member is lifted up by expanding the expandable member by supplying fluid to the same expandable member constituting the lift operation means and the pallet<br>

[Embodiment 1 ] [0062]<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in detail according to the embodiment 1 with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
According to the embodiment 1, "back and forth direction" in the carrier unit 1 is set as a direction matching with a carrying direction Q (see FIG. 1) of a carrying object and "right and left direction" in the carrier unit 1 is set as a direction perpendicular to the carrying direction Q. In the embodiment 1, as the "carrying object" of the present invention, as shown in FIG. 10, a coil-like steel A is exemplified. As the "pallet" of the present Invention, as shown in FIG. 10, a pallet Pa comprising a pallet main body Pal, a loading portion Pa2 which is provided on.the top side of this pallet main body Pal<br>
76<br><br>
and capable of carrying the coil-like steel A in its laterally placed condition and a leg portion Pa3 in which the bottom open space Pa4 is formed and which makes contact with the floor surface is exemplified. This pallet Pa is formed in the unit of a module which is substantially 1/4 the longitudinal length of a container described later. For the embodiment 1, as shown in FIG. 12, as the "transportation container" of the present invention, a dry container C (hereinafter described as just container) 20 feet long in which an opening portion cl is formed at an end side in the longitudinal direction is exemplified. Further, as the "handling means" of the present invention, a fork lift F is exemplified. [0063] (1)  Structure of carrier unit<br>
As shown in FIGS. 1, 8, the carrier unit 1 of carrying object according to this embodiment 1 is formed in a size which allows itself to invade the bottom open space Pa4 of the pallet Pa. This carrier unit 1 includes a pair of lift units 2a, 2b provided with a predetermined interval in parallel. As shown in FIG. 3, the lift units 2a, 2b have a base member 3 having a substantially U shaped vertical section extending along the carrying direction Q. Inside the base member 3, A number of rotation rollers, (exemplified as the "traveling means" of the present invention) 4 are supported rotatably around a horizontal axis with a predetermined interval along the longitudinal direction. On the rotation rollers 4, a pallet supporting member 5 having a substantially U shaped vertical section extending along the carrying direction Q is supported such that it is capable of being lifted up/down. The top face of this<br>
77<br><br>
pallet supporting member 5 serves as a pallet supporting face 5a for supporting the pallet Pa from below. As shown in FIGS. 1, 8, both ends in the longitudinal direction of the respective pallet supporting members 5 of the lift units 2a, 2b are connected to each other with sheet-like connecting members 6a, 6b so that both the lift units 2a, 2b are integrated.<br>
The length in the longitudinal direction of each of the lift units 2a, 2b is set to substantially the same value as the length in the carrying direction Q of the pallet Pa. [0064]<br>
As shown in FIGS. 1, 2, a pair of contact portions 11, right and left, are provided on outer side faces of the connecting members 6a and a contact valve 7 (exemplified as "fluid discharge contact valve" of the present invention) having an operating member 7a for switching a fluid passage is attached to each contact portion 11. A pair of ring-like members 8 (exemplified as "joint portion" of the present invention), right and left, which are capable of engaging an end of wire rope, are attached to the outer side face of this connecting member 6a. Guide rollers 9, which are guided to inner faces of the leg portion Pa3 of a pallet Pa are supported on both ends in the longitudinal direction of the joint members 6a, 6b such that they are rotatable freely around their vertical axes. Consequently, when the carrier unit 1 invades the bottom open space Pa4 of the pallet Pa, it can obtain an excellent straight advance performance. Further, a pair of rubber-made buffering members 10, right and left, are provided on the outer side face of the connecting member 6b. [0065]<br>
78<br><br>
As shown in FIG. 3, a tube-like expandable member 12, which is expanded/contracted by supplying/discharging compression air, is provided between the top face of the base member 3 and the pallet supporting member 5. A flexible pipe 13 for supplying compression air is connected to an opening portion at an end of this expandable member 12. The other end of this pipe 13 projects out of the connecting member 6a and a joint 14 is attached to this projecting portion. An air hose 16 connected to a compressor 15 (exemplified as "fluid supply source" of the present invention) for supplying compression air can be connected to this joint 14. As shown in FIGS. 1, 5, a pilot type first valve 17, second valve 18, pushbutton valve 19 and the contact valve 7 are provided halfway of this pipe 13, and an opening/closing valve mechanism 20 is constituted of these valves 17, 18, 19 and 7. If the pushbutton valve 19 is operated with the pipe 13 and the air hose 16 connected to each other, compression air is supplied from the compressor 15 into the expandable member 12, so that the expandable member 12 is expanded so as to lift up the pallet supporting member 5. If the contact valve 7 makes contact with a stopper member described later when the pallet supporting member 5 is lifted up and then the flow passage of this contact valve 7 is switched, compression air supplied to the expandable member 12 is discharged out so that the expandable member 12 is contracted, and the pallet supporting member 5 is lifted down.<br>
It can be said that the "lift operation means" of the present invention is constituted of the expandable member 12, the pipe 13, the opening/closing valve mechanism 20 and the like. [0066]<br>
79<br><br>
As shown in FIG. 6, a reinforcement member 22 having a substantially U shaped vertical section extending along the carrying direction Q is provided between both the connecting members 6a and 6b. This reinforcement member 22 has an engaging portion 23 capable of engaging a pawl portion f of a fork lift F. This engaging portion 23 comprises engaging bars 24 (exemplified as "engaging member" of the present invention) extending in a direction perpendicular to the carrying direction Q and a supporting mechanism 25 for supporting this engaging bar 24 such that it is capable of deflecting freely between a predetermined interval. This supporting mechanism 25 has swing levers 26a, 26b, front and rear, supported by the reinforcement member 22 such that they are capable of swinging freely around a horizontal axis. An end portion of a link member 27 is journaled on an end side of each of the front, rear swing levers 26a, 26b. Further, the engaging bar 24 is mounted on the other end of each of the front, rear swing levers 26a, 26b. Therefore, by swinging one swing lever 26a, the engaging bar 24 deflects between a storage position a submerged below the pallet supporting face 5a of the pallet supporting member 5 and a handling position b projecting upward from the pallet supporting face 5a. When as shown in FIG. 9, the pawl portions f of the fork lift F are inserted into the bottom space on the engaging bar 24 at the handling position b and raised, the pawl portion f engages the engaging bar 24 and the carrier unit 1 is lifted up and with a traveling of the fork lift F, the carrier unit 1 can be carried to a desired position. [0067]<br>
As shown in FIG. 7, a fixing sheet material 29 is fixed<br>
80<br><br>
on one swing lever 24a. A screw portion 30a of an operating tool 30 which can be operated, by rotation with the fingers meshes with this fixing sheet material 29. The bottom end of this screw portion 30a makes contact with the top face of the reinforcement member 22 so as to position the engaging bar 24 at the storage position a. If the amount of downward projection of the screw portion from the fixing sheet material 29 is increased by rotating operation of the operating tool 30, the swing lever 24a swings slightly upward, so that the engaging bar 24 is maintained at an engagement position c which projects slightly upward form the pallet supporting face 5a (indicated with a phantom line in the same Figure). By engagement between the engaging bar 24 located at this engaging position c and the leg portion Pb3 of the pallet Pa supported by the pallet supporting face 5a, the positioning of the pallet Pa in the carrying direction Q is carried out. [0068] (2)  Carry-out operation of carrier unit<br>
Next, the carry-out operation of a carrying object from the container C, which is adopted to the carrier unit having the above-described structure, will be described. In this carry-out operation, it is assumed that four independent carrying object loading pallets Pa (pallet Pa loaded with carrying object) are stored within the container C. In this carry-out operation, as the "stopper member" of the present invention, as shown in FIG. 13, it is assumed to use a stopper member 32.comprising a base portion 32a having a substantially the same length as the width of the container C, a screwing portion 32b which is to be screwed to a corner metal c2 of the container C provided on both<br>
81<br><br>
ends of the base member 32a and a pair of stopper pieces 32c provided at a predetermined position in the longitudinal direction of the base member 32a. [0069]<br>
First, the container C is carried to a specified work place with a truck and the horizontality of the container C to be placed on the chassis is adjusted with a landing gear. Then, the door of the container C is opened and a carrying object loading pallet Pa placed on-the floor surface on the side of the opening portion cl of the container C is moved to a predetermined position out of the container C with a fork lift F (see FIG. 14). After that the engaging bar 24 of the carrier unit 1 is positioned at the handling position b and this engaging bar 24 is engaged with the pawl portion f of the fork lift F. The carrier unit 1 is carried onto the floor surface on the side of the opening portion cl of the container C with the fork lift F (see FIG. 15). At this time, the carrier unit 1 is disposed such that one of the connecting members 6a is directed to the side of the fork lift F. Next, the pawl portion f of the fork lift F is pulled out from the engaging bar 24 of the carrier unit 1 and the engaging bar 24 is positioned at the storage position a. Next, the carrier unit 1 is pressed into the deep side along the floor surface of the container C and taken into the bottom open space Pa4 on the carrying object loading pallet Pa to be carried out next (see FIG. 16). [0070]<br>
After that, a stopper member 32 is fixed on the side of the opening portion cl of the container C through the corner metal c2 of the container C (see FIG. 13). Next, in the carrier<br>
82<br><br>
unit 1, the engaging bar 24 is positioned at the engagement position c by rotating the operating tool 30 and the positioning of the pallet Pa in the carrying direction Q is carried out by engaging this engaging bar 24 with the pallet Pa (see FIG. 7). Next, an air hose 16 is connected to a joint tool 14 of the carrier unit 1 and an end of a wire rope whose other end is connected to the fork lift F is engaged with the ring-like member 8.. If a push button valve 19 is depressed in this condition, compression air is supplied to the expandable member 12 so that the expandable member 12 is expanded and the pallet supporting member 5 is raised. The carrying object loading pallet Pa is brought up from the floor surface of the container C with this raised pallet supporting member 5 (see FIG. 3). [0071]<br>
If the fork lift F is run in a direction leaving from the container C, the carrier unit 1 is pulled through the wire rope 34 and the carrying object loading pallet Pa is run on the floor surface of the container C together with the carrier unit 1 from the deep side to the side of the opening portion cl (see FIG. 17). Then, if the contact valve 7 of the carrier, unit 1 makes contact with the stopper member 32, compression air supplied to the expandable member 12 is discharged out and hence, the expandable member 12 is contracted so that the pallet supporting member 5 is lifted down and the carrying object loading pallet Pa supported by the pallet supporting member 5 is placed on the floor surface on the side of the opening portion cl of the container C (see FIG. 4). Next, the air hose 16 and the wire rope 34 are removed from the carrier unit 1 and by rotating the operating tool 30, the engaging bar 24 is positioned at the<br>
83<br><br>
storage position a and the engagement between the engaging bar 24 and the carrying object loading pallet Pa is released. Next, the carrier unit 1 is pressed into the deep side of the container C by an operator and after that, the carrying object loading pallet Pa placed on the floor surface on the side of the opening portion cl of the container C is moved to a   , predetermined position with the fork lift F (see FIG. 18).<br>
After that, the remaining carrying object loading pallets Pa in the container C are carried out by executing the above-described operation (see FIGS. 16-18) repeatedly and the carry-out operation of sequential carrying objects is terminated. [0072] (3)  Carry-in operation of carrier unit<br>
Next, the carry-in operation of carrying object into the container C using the carrier unit 1 having the above-described structure will be described. In this carry-in operation, it is assumed that four independent carrying object loading pallets Pa are stored within the container C. [0073]<br>
First, the horizontality of an empty container C placed on the chassis is adjusted with a landing gear. Then, the door of the container C is opened and the engagement bar 24 of the carrier unit 1 is positioned at the handling position b. The carrier unit 1 is moved onto the floor surface on the side of the opening portion cl of the container C with the fork lift F through this engagement bar 24 (see FIG. 19). At this time, the carrier unit 1 is disposed so that its connecting member 6a is directed to an opposite side to the fork lift F. After that, the engagement bar 24 is returned to the storage position a and<br>
84<br><br>
the carrier unit 1 is pressed into the deep side of the container C by an operator (see FIG. 20). Next, the carrying object loading pallet Pa is moved onto the floor surface on the side of the opening portion cl of the container C with the fork lift F and then, the carrier unit 1 is pulled into the side of the opening portion cl of the container C so that it invades the bottom open space Pa4 of the carrying object loading pallet Pa (see FIG. 21).  [0074]<br>
After that in the carrier unit 1, by operating the operating tool 30, the engaging bar 24 is positioned at the engagement position c so as to position the carrying object loading pallet Pa in the carrying direction Q. Next, the air hose 16 is connected to the carrier unit 1 and a pressing member 31 (attachment) is attached to the pawl portion f of the fork lift F. By pressing the push button valve 19 under this condition, the pallet supporting member 5 is lifted up so as to lift up the carrying object loading pallet Pa from the floor surface of the container C with the pallet supporting member 5. If the fork lift F is run in a direction of approaching the container C from a state in which the front end of the pressing member 31 keeps contact with the carrier unit 1, the carrier unit 1 and the carrying object loading pallet Pa are pushed to the deep side of the container C (see FIG. 22). Then, when the contact valve 7 of the carrier unit 1 makes contact with the wall surface on the deep side of the container C during the traveling, the pallet supporting member 5 is lifted down "and then, the carrying object loading pallet Pa supported by this pallet supporting member 5 is placed on the floor surface on the<br>
85<br><br>
deep side of the container C. Next, the air hose 16 connected to the carrier unit 1 is removed and by rotating the operating tool 30 so as to locate the engaging bar 24 at its original storage position a, engagement between the carrying object loading pallet Pa and the engaging bar 24 is released and then the carrier unit 1 is pulled out to the side of the opening portion cl of the container C (see FIG. 23).<br>
After that, by repeating the above-described operation (see FIGS. 21-23), remaining carrying object loading pallets Pa are carried into the container C and then, a sequential carrying object carry-in operation is finished. When the remaining carrying object loading pallets Pa are carried in, the stopper member 32 capable of making contact with the contact valve 7 is fixed on the rear side (side of the opening portion cl of the container C) of already carried-in carrying object loading pallets Pa. A last (fourth) carrying object loading pallet Pa is carried onto the floor surface on the side of the opening portion cl of the container C by the fork lift F. [0075] (4)  Effect of the embodiment 1<br>
In the carrier unit 1 of the embodiment 1, a number of rotation rollers 4 are supported freely rotatably on the bottom face of the base member 3, the pallet supporting member 5 capable of supporting the pallet Pa from below is supported such that it is capable of being lifted up/down and the expandable member 12, which is expanded or contracted by supplying compression air is provided between the base member 3 and the pallet supporting member 5. Consequently, a plurality of carrying objects (for example, coil-like steel and the like<br>
86<br><br>
about 4-10 ton) can be carried into/out from the dry container C using a simple handling means such as fork lift, winch. Further the contact valve 7, which makes contact with the stopper member 32 to switch its flow passage is provided on the halfway of the pipe 13 continued from the expandable member 12 and when the contact valve 7 makes contact with the stopper member 32, compression air supplied to the expandable member 12 is discharged and the pallet supporting member 5 is lifted down. Consequently, the carrying object can be transported accurately to a predetermined transportation position (traveling/stop position). As a result, when a carrying object is transported, the carrying object loading pallet Pa can be prevented from slipping out from the opening portion cl of the container C and the carrying object loading pallet Pa can be prevented form colliding with a deep side wall of the dry container C or other carrying object loading pallet Pa strongly to lead to a damage or collapse.<br>
Because the carrier unit 1 of this embodiment 1 includes the engaging bars 24, which deflect freely between the handling position b projecting from the pallet supporting face 5a and the storage position a submerged in the pallet supporting face 5a, the carrier unit 1 can be lifted up by a fork lift or the like and carried away easily. In the carrier unit 1 of this embodiment 1, the engaging bar 24 can be maintained at an engaging position c slightly projecting from the pallet supporting face 5a and by engagement between the engaging bar 24 at this engaging position c and the pallet Pa supported by the pallet supporting member 5, positioning of the pallet Pa in the carrying direction Q is carried out, thereby making it possible<br>
87<br><br>
to suppress a deflection in position of the pallet Pa with respect to the pallet supporting member 5 during transportation.<br>
Further, because the carrier unit 1 of this embodiment 1 transports the carrying object to the dry container C placed on the chassis without using any stage, it can be carried effectively. Because the pallet Pa is formed in the unit of a module with reference to the length of the floor surface of the dry container C, the fixing/releasing work for the pallet Pa to the dry container Ccan be minimized (can be substantially eliminated). [0076]<br>
The present invention is not limited to the embodiment 1 but may be modified in various ways within the scope of the invention corresponding to the purpose and application. That is, although according to the embodiment 1, a carrying object is transported to the container G without using any stage, the present invention is not restricted to this embodiment, but it is permissible to provide a stage having the floor surface of a substantially the same level as the height of the floor surface of the container C on the side of the opening portion cl of the container C and carry the carrying object to the container through this stage. Here, transportation of a carrying object to the stage can be carried out with the handling means such as a fork lift, ceiling crane and the like.<br>
Although according to the embodiment 1, the carrying object is transported to the container C placed on the chassis, the present invention is not restricted to this but the carrying object may be transported to a container placed on the floor surface. In this case, the carrying object can be carried from<br>
88<br><br>
a container placed on the floor to a floor on a different height level from the floor of this container with the handling means such as a fork lift. Further, it is permissible to provide a stage having a floor surface of a substantially the same height level as the height of the floor surface of the container placed on the floor and carry the carrying object to the container through this stage. The transportation of the carrying object to the stage can be carried out with the handling means such as the fork lift, ceiling crane.<br>
Although according to the embodiment 1, the stopper member 32 to be fixed to the corner metal c2 of the dry container C has been exemplified, this embodiment is not restricted to this example, but it is permissible to use a stopper member fixed on the floor surface or right, left inner walls of the dry container.<br>
Although according to the embodiment 1, the carrier unit 1 is run on the floor surface or the carrier unit 1 and the carrying object loading pallet Pa is moved to a desired position with the handling means such as fork lift, winch, this embodiment is not restricted to this example, but the carrier unit can be run on the floor or the carrier unit and carrying object loading pallet can be moved to a desired position by an operator. Particularly, the self-traveling type carrier unit<br>
can be run on the floor using man power as an auxiliary means.<br>
[Embodiment 2]<br>
[0077]<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be specifically<br>
described about the embodiment 2 with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>
89<br><br>
According to the embodiment 2, "back and forth direction" in the carrier unit is set as a direction matching with a carrying direction Q (see FIG. 24) of a carrying object and "right and left direction" in the carrier unit is set as a direction perpendicular to the carrying direction. In the embodiment 2, as the "carrying object" of the present invention, as shown in FIGS. 32, 33, a press die B is exemplified.<br>
As the "pallet" of the present invention, as shown in FIGS. 32, 33, a pallet Pb comprising a pallet main body Pbl, a loading portion Pb2 which is provided on the top side of this pallet main body Pbl and capable of carrying the press die B and a leg portion Pb3 in which the bottom open space Pb4 is formed and makes contact with the floor surface is exemplified. This pallet Pb is a pallet jointed body obtained by joining two pallets, constructed as a module which is substantially 1/4 the length in the longitudinal direction,of a container described later. As shown in FIG. 34, the loading portion Pb2 of this pallet Pb comprises a number of hallow bottom base members 36 arranged in a direction perpendicular to the carrying direction Q and containing a slit 36a on its top face and a plurality of hallow upper base members 37 arranged along the carrying direction Q and containing a slit 37a in its top face. The upper base members 37 are fixed on the top face of the bottom base members 36 with fixing tools 38 supported slidably in the longitudinal direction of the bottom base member 36 and the press die B is fixed on the top face of the upper base members 37 through die fixing holes with fixing tools 39 (exemplified as "carrying object fixing tool" of the present invention) supported slidably in the longitudinal direction of the upper<br>
90<br><br>
base member 37. Therefore, press dies B having various contours and different die fixing hole positions can be handled by adjusting the fixing positions with their fixing tools 38, 39.<br>
For the this embodiment 2, as the "transportation container" of the present invention, a 20-feet dry container C (hereinafter described as just container C) in which an opening portion cl is formed at an end in the longitudinal direction is exemplified. As the "handling means" of the present invention, the winch W (air type or manual type) is exemplified. [0078] (1)  Structure of carrier unit<br>
As shown in FIGS. 24, 25, a carrier unit 41 of carrying object according to this embodiment 2 is formed in a size which allows itself to invade the bottom open space Pb4 of the pallet Pb. This carrier unit 41 includes a pair of lift units 42a, 42b provided with a predetermined interval in parallel. As shown in FIG. 26, the lift units 42a, 42b have a base member 43 having a substantially U shaped vertical section. Inside the base member 43, a number of rotation rollers (exemplified as the "traveling means" of the present invention) 44 are supported rotatably around a horizontal axis with a predetermined interval along the longitudinal direction. On the base member43, a pallet supporting member 45 having a substantially U shaped vertical section extending along the carrying direction Q is supported such that it is capable of being lifted up/down. The top face of this pallet supporting member 45 serves as a pallet supporting face 45a for supporting the pallet Pb from below. Ends in the longitudinal direction of the respective pallet . supporting members 45 of the lift units 42a, 42b are connected<br>
91<br><br>
to each other with sheet-like connecting members 46a so that both the lift units 42a, 42b are integrated. Sheet-like fixing members 46b, 46b are fixed to the other ends in the longitudinal direction of the respective pallet supporting members 45.<br>
The length in the longitudinal direction of each of the lift units 42a, 42b is set to substantially the same value as the length in the carrying direction Q of the pallet Pb. [0079]<br>
As shown in FIGS. 24, 25, a pair of contact portions 110, right and left, are provided on outer side faces of the connecting members 46a and a contact valve 47 (exemplified as "fluid discharge contact valve" of the present invention) having an operating member 47a for switching a fluid passage is attached to each contact portion 110. A pair of ring-like members 48 (exemplified as "joint portion" of the present invention), right and left, which are capable of engaging an end of wire rope, are attached to the outer side face of this connecting member 46a. Guide rollers 40, which are guided to inner faces of the leg portion Pb3 of a pallet Pb, are supported on both ends in the longitudinal direction of the connecting members 46a and on ends in the longitudinal direction of the respective fixing members 46b, 46b such that they are rotatable freely around their vertical axes. Consequently, when the. carrier unit 1 invades the bottom open space Pb4 of the pallet Pb, it can obtain an excellent straight advance performance. Further, a pair of rubber-made buffering members 50, right and left, are provided on the outer side face of the respective fixing members 46b, 46b. [0080]<br>
92<br><br>
A joint lever 51 (exemplified as "joint/release portion" of the present invention) is supported on the other end side of each pallet supporting member 45 such that as shown in FIGS. 30, 31, it is capable of swinging freely between a joint position d and a release position e. The front end side of this joint lever 51 is formed into a hook portion 51a capable of engaging a concave portion 49 in the fixing member 46b provided on an end side of the pallet supporting member 45 of each of the other lift units 42c, 42d. Therefore, if the joint lever 51 at a release position e is positioned at a joint position d by operating the operating portion 51b, the hook portion 51a of the joint lever 51 engages the concave portion 49. Consequently, the other lift units 42c, 42d can be joined with the lift units 42a, 42b along the longitudinal direction. In the meantime, in the other lift units 42c, 42d, preferably, intermediate portions in the longitudinal direction of the paired base members 43 are jointed with an intermediate joint member 35 (indicated with a phantom line in FIG. 24). [0081]<br>
As shown in FIG. 26, a tube-like expandable member 52, which is expanded or contracted by supplying/discharging compression air, is disposed between the top face of the base member 43 and the pallet supporting member 45. A flexible pipe 53 for supplying compression air is connected to an opening portion at an end of this expandable member 52. The other end of this pipe 53 projects out of the connecting member 46a and a joint 54 (see FIG. 25) is attached to this projecting end. An air hose 56 connected to a compressor 55 (exemplified as "fluid supply source" of the present invention) can be connected to<br>
93<br><br>
this joint 54. As shown in FIGS. 24, 28, a pilot type first valve 57, second valve 58, third valve 59, pushbutton valve 60 and the contact valve 47 are provided halfway of this pipe 53, and an opening/closing valve mechanism 61 is constituted of these valves 57, 58, 59, 60 and 47. If the pushbutton valve 60 is depressed with the pipe 53 and the air hose 56 connected to each other, compression air is supplied from the compressor 55 into the expandable member 52, so that the expandable member 52 is expanded so as to lift up the pallet supporting member 45. If the contact valve 47 makes contact with a stopper member described later when the pallet supporting member 45 is lifted up and then the flow passage is switched over compression air supplied to the expandable member 52 is discharged out so that the expandable member 52 is contracted, and the pallet supporting member 45 is lifted down.<br>
It can be said that the "lift operation means" of the present invention is constituted of the expandable member 52, the pipe 53, the opening/closing valve mechanism 61 and the like. [0082]<br>
In the respective lift units 42a, 42b, front/rear engaging bars 63 formed in a substantially U shape (exemplified as "engaging member" of the present invention) are supported on the side faces of each pallet supporting member 45 with a predetermined interval along the longitudinal direction such that they are capable of swinging freely between a storage position a (indicated with a solid line in FIG. 29) and a handling position b (indicated with a phantom line in FIG. 29). Then, by inserting the pawl portion f of the fork lift F into an internal space of the engaging bar 63 at the handling position b<br>
94<br><br>
so as to engage both, the carrier unit 41 can be transported to<br>
a desired position.<br>
[0083]<br>
(2)  Carry-out operation of carrier unit<br>
The carry-out operation of carrying object from the<br>
container C using the carrier unit 41 having the above-described<br>
structure will be described.<br>
In this carry-out operation, as shown in FIG. 39, it is<br>
assumed that two independent carrying object loading pallets Pb (pallet Pb loaded with the carrying object) is stored within the<br>
container C. Further, it is assumed that for this carry-out<br>
operation, a stage 80 adjacent to the opening portion cl of the<br>
container C mounted on the chassis is used. In this carry-out<br>
operation, it is assumed that carrier unit 41 for use does not<br>
include the other lift units 42c, 42d.<br>
[0084]<br>
Here, the aforementioned stage 80 will be described. As shown in FIG. 39, this stage 80 is installed adjacent to the side of the opening portion cl of the container C mounted on the chassis of a truck. This stage 80 has a table 81 whose surface is on substantially the same level as the floor surface of the container C on the chassis. A leveling mechanism 82 is provided on the container C of this table 81. As shown in FIG. 40, this leveling mechanism 82 comprises an engaging member 83, a supporting head 84 which supports this engaging member 83 movably in a direction of inserting/removing it into an elongated hole in the corner metal c2 provided on the corners, right and left on the bottom on the side of the opening portion cl of the container C, a guide rail 85 for supporting this<br>
95<br><br>
supporting head 84 such that the same supporting head 84 is capable of being lifted up/down and a lift mechanism 86 for lifting up/down this supporting head 84. This lift mechanism 86 is constituted of a screw jack 88 driven by the operation of an air motor 87. According to this leveling mechanism 82, if the engaging member 83 in an engagement condition with the corner metal c2 of the container C is lifted up, the container C on the chassis is lifted up so as to adjust the height level of the floor surface. [0085]<br>
First, the container C is carried to a specified work place adjacent to the stage 80 with a truck. Then, the height of the floor surface of the container C mounted on the chassis is matched with the height of the floor surface of the stage 80 with the leveling mechanism 82. After that, the engaging bar 63 of the carrier unit 41 is positioned at the handling position b and the pawl portion f of the fork lift F is engaged with this engaging bar 63 and then, the carrier unit 41 is carried to a desired position on the stage 80. At this time, the carrier unit 41 is disposed so that its connecting member 46a faces in an opposite direction to the container C. Next, the carrier unit 41 on the stage 80 is pressed into the interior of the container C by an operator, so that this carrier unit 41 is taken into, the bottom open space Pb4 of the carrying object loading pallet Pb mounted on the floor surface on the side of the opening portion cl of the container C (see FIG. 41). [0086]<br>
After that, the air hose 56 is connected to the joint 54 in the carrier unit 41 and an end of the wire rope 34 whose<br>
96<br><br>
other end is connected to a winch W is engaged with the ring-like member 48. If the push button valve 60 is depressed under this condition, compression air is supplied to the expandable member 52 so as to expand the expandable member 52, so that the pallet supporting member 45 is lifted up. Consequently, the carrying object loading pallet Pb is brought up from the floor surface of the container C with this pallet supporting member 45. After that, the wire rope 34 is wound up with the winch W and consequently, the carrier unit 41 is pulled toward the side of the opening portion cl of the container C so that the carrying object loading pallet Pb is run on the floor surface of the container C from the deep side to the opening portion side together with this carrier unit 41 and further, run on the floor surface of the stage 80 (see FIG. 42). If the contact valve 47 of the carrier unit 41 makes contact with the stopper member 62 provided on the floor surface of the stage 80, compression air supplied to the expandable member 52 is discharged out so that the expandable member 52 is contracted. Consequently, the pallet supporting member 45 is lifted down and the carrying object loading pallet Pb supported by this pallet supporting member 45 is placed on the floor surface of the stage 80. Next, the carrying object loading pallet Pb carried out on this stage 64 is moved to a desired position with a crane or the like.<br>
After that, the carrying object loading pallets Pb remaining within the container C are carried out by repeating the aforementioned operation (see FIGS. 41, 42) and consequently, a sequential carrying object carry-out operation is terminated. [0087] (3)  Carry-in operation of the carrier unit<br>
97<br><br>
Next, the carry-in operation of carrying object into the container C using the carrier unit 41 having the above-described structure will be described.<br>
In this carry-in operation, it is assumed that two independent carrying object loading pallets Pb are stored in the container C. Further, for this carry-in operation, it is assumed that the stage 80 adjacent to the side of the opening portion cl of the container C mounted on the chassis is used. Additionally, in this carry-in operation, it is assumed that the carrier unit 41 including no lift units 42c, 42d is used. [0088]<br>
First, the empty container C is carried to a specified work place adjacent to the stage 80 with a truck. Then, the height of the floor surface of the container C mounted on the chassis is matched with the height of the floor surface of the stage 80 with the leveling mechanism 82. After that, the engaging bar 63 of the carrier unit 41 is positioned at the handling position b and the pawl portion f of the fork lift F is engaged with this engaging bar 63 and then, the carrier unit 41 is carried to a desired position on the stage 64. At this time, the carrier unit 41 is disposed so that its connecting member 46a faces the deep side of the container C. Next, the carrying object loading pallet Pb is moved to a desired position where it covers over the carrier unit 41 on the stage 80, so that the carrier unit 41 invades the bottom open space Pb4 of the carrying object loading pallet Pb. [0089]<br>
The air hose 56 and the wire rope 34 joined to the winch W are connected to the carrier unit 41. This wire rope 34 is<br>
98<br><br>
wound around the roller 33 provided on the wall face on the deep<br><br>
side of the container C. If the push button valve 60 is depressed under this condition, compression air is supplied to the expandeible member 52 so as to expand the expandable member 52 and consequently, the pallet supporting member 45 is lifted up and the carrying object loading pallet Pb is brought up from<br>
the floor surface of the container C with the pallet supporting<br>
member 45. After that, if the wire rope 34 is wound up with the<br>
winch W, the carrier unit 41 and the carrying object loading pallet Pb are pulled to the deep side of the container C (see FIG. 43). Then, if the contact valve 47 of the carrier unit 41 makes contact with the wall face on the deep side of the container C during traveling, the pallet supporting member 45 is lifted down and the carrying object loading pallet Pb supported by this pallet supporting member 45 is placed on the floor surface on the deep side of the container C. Next, the carrier unit 41 is pulled up to the floor surface of the stage 80 (see FIG. 44).<br>
After that, the remaining carrying object loading pallets Pb are carried into the container C by repeating the above-described operation (see FIGS. 43, 44) and a sequential carrying object carry-in operation is finished. When the remaining carrying object loading pallets Pb are carried in, the stopper member 62 is fixed on the side of the opening portion cl of the container C of already carried in carrying object loading pallets Pb. [0090] (4)  Effect of the embodiment 2<br>
In the carrier unit 41 of the embodiment 2, a number of<br>
99<br><br>
rotation rollers 44 are supported freely rotatably on the bottom face of the base member 43 and the pallet supporting member 45 capable of supporting the pallet Pb from below is supported on this base member 43 such that it is capable of being lifted up/down and the expandable member 52 which is<br>
expanded/contracted by supplying/discharging compression air is provided between the base member 43 and the pallet supporting member 45. Consequently, a heavy, long and bulky carrying object (for example, press die or the like about 4-20 ton in weight) can be carried in or out with such a simple handling means such as a fork lift, winch. Further, the contact valve 47 capable of switching a fluid passage by making contact with the stopper member 62 is provided halfway of the pipe 53 continued from the expandable member 52 and when the contact valve 47 makes contact with the stopper member 62, compression air supplied to the expandable member 52 is discharged out so as to lift down the pallet supporting member 45. Thus, the carrying object can be transported accurately to a preliminarily determined transportation position (traveling stop position). Consequently, the carrying object loading pallet Pb can be prevented from slipping out from the stage 64 or colliding with the deep wall of the dry container C or other carrying object loading pallet Pb strongly to lead to damage, collapse or the like when the carrying object is transported.<br>
Further, because in the carrier unit 41 of the embodiment 2, the joint lever 51 capable of engaging the concave portion 49 formed on the other end in the longitudinal direction of the other lift units 42c, 42d is provided at an end in the longitudinal direction of the lift units 42a, 42b such that it<br>
100<br><br>
is capable of swinging freely, the joint or non-joint can be selected appropriately depending on the type of the carrying object (for example, size, shape, weight and the like).<br>
Because in the carrier unit 41 of the embodiment 2, the engaging bar 63 is provided between the handling position b projecting from the pallet supporting face 45a and the storage position a submerged relative to the pallet supporting face 45a such that it is capable of deflecting freely, the carrier unit 41 can be hoisted through the engaging bar 63 at the handling position b by a handling means such as a fork lift and carried easily.<br>
Further, because according to the transportation method of the embodiment 2, the carrying object is transported to the container C using the stage 80, various kinds of carrying objects, heavy, long or bulky ones can be carried effectively. Further, because the pallet Pb is formed in the unit of a module based on the length of the floor surface of the container C, the fixing/release work for the pallet Pb to the dry container C can be minimized. [0091]<br>
The present invention is not restricted to the embodiment 1 and the embodiment 2, but may be modified in various ways within the scope of the invention depending on the purpose and application. Although according to the embodiment 2, it is so constructed to carry the carrying object to the container C placed on the chassis, this embodiment is not restricted to this example, but it is permissible to transport the carrying object to the container C placed on the floor surface as shown in FIG. 45. ,<br>
101<br><br>
Although according to the embodiment 2, the carrier unit 41 is provided with the guide rollers 40 at positions guided along the leg portions Pb3 provided on the right and left sides of the pallet Pb, the embodiment is not restricted to this example, but it is permissible to provide the guide roller 40' (indicated with a phantom line in FIG. 24) at positions guided along the leg portion Pb3 provided in the center of the pallet Pb. Consequently, the straight advancing performance of the carrier unit can be improved. [0092]<br>
Although in the embodiment 2, the leveling mechanism 82 for adjusting the height level of the floor surface by lifting up the container C has been exemplified, the embodiment is not restricted to this example, but it is permissible to adopt such a leveling mechanism for adjusting the height level of the floor surface by lifting down the engaging member which engages the corner metal of the container so as to press down the container. Further, although the leveling mechanism 82 using the corner metal c2 on the bottom of the side of the opening portion cl of the container C has been exemplified, the embodiment is not restricted to this example, but it is permissible to use corner metals on the upper and bottom sides on the side of the opening portion of a container. Preferably, a slope (not shown) on which wheels of the chassis can ride is provided at a position near the stage 80 or a height adjusting plate (iron plate or the like) is provided on that slope. [0093]<br>
Although according to the embodiment 2, the carrier unit 41 is run on the floor surface or the carrier unit 41 and the<br>
102<br><br>
carrying object loading pallet Pb are carried to a desired position with such a handling means as a fork lift, winch, the embodiment: is not restricted to this example. For example, the carrier unit 41 may be run on the floor surface or the carrier unit 41 or the carrying object loading pallet Pb may be moved up to a desired position by an operator. Particularly, the self-traveling carrier unit can be run on the floor surface using a man power as an auxiliary means. [0094]<br>
Upon transportation of a press die according to the embodiment 2, usually, a three-dimensional measuring instrument is transported together with this press die B. In this case, if as shown in PIG. 35, a substantially C shaped base member 69 is fixed on the top face of a slit provided base member 67 constituting the pallet Pb through a fixing device 68 and a plate 73 for supporting a three-dimensional measuring instrument 71 is fixed on the top face of this base member 69 through a anti-vibration rubber member 70, a container can be transported with the pallet Pb loaded with this three-dimensional measuring instrument 71. Consequently, a vibration at the time of transportation is absorbed by the anti-vibration rubber member<br>
70	so as to suppress application of bad influence upon the<br>
three-dimensional measuring instrument 71 due to vibration. As<br>
a result, railroad transportation of the press die, which is<br>
conventionally difficult, can be realized. Particularly, it is<br>
preferable to package the three-dimensional measuring instrument<br>
71	with anti-corrosion sheet material 72 (for example, vinyl<br>
sheet whose surface is impregnated with volatile anti-corrosion<br>
agent.<br>
103<br><br>
[0095]<br>
Although according to the embodiment 2, the carrying object is loaded on a pallet jointed body prepared by jointing two pallets (1/4 module pallet), the embodiment is not restricted to this example, but whether or not the pallets are jointed can be selected appropriately depending on the size, shape, weight and the like of the carrying object. For example bulky carrying object similar to the internal volume of a container can be loaded as a single carrying object over the pallet jointed body prepared by jointing four pallets as shown in FIG. 36. Further, a carrying object including a number of steel materials slightly longer than the entire length of the container can be loaded through a receiving device 74 mounted on the pallet jointed body prepared by jointing four pallets such that it is placed obliquely as shown in FIG. 37. Further, as shown in FIG. 38, the carrying object comprising a number of steel materials shorter than the entire length of the container can be loaded through a receiving device 75 prepared by jointing four pallets in conditions in which they are prevented from jumping out in the longitudinal direction. In this case, the receiving device 75 is preferred to be supported slidably on the slide rail 76. In this way, this embodiment can correspond to long carrying object having various lengths. As shown in FIG. 38, it is permissible to place an engaging member 100 such as a square material between the right/left side faces of the pallet Pb and the right/left inner wall faces of the container C. Consequently, appropriate straight advancing performance of a pallet pulled out of the container can be secured upon carry-out. If a pallet (or a pallet jointed body) having a size<br>
104<br><br>
substantially coinciding with the floor surface of the container is used as described above, the carrying unit 41. is constituted by jointing the lift units 42a, 42b with the lift units 42c, 42d, the carrying object loading pallet can be carried into/out from the container at a time. [0096]<br>
Although according to the embodiment 1 and the embodiment 2, only the carrier units 1, 41 are provided with the opening/closing valve mechanisms 20, 61, the present invention is not restricted to this example but the opening/closing valve mechanism can be provided on a remote control portion for remote-controlling various operations of the carrier unit. For example, as shown in FIG. 46, by connecting a remote control portion 90 (indicated with a phantom line in FIG. 9) to the pipe 13(or air hose 16) through another pipe, it is permissible to provide this remote control portion 90 with a fluid supply operation valve 91, a fluid discharge operation valve 92 and a valve 93. Here, the fluid supply operation valve 91 switches a fluid passage by push button operation so as to supply fluid to the expandable member 12 thereby lifting up the pallet supporting member 5. Further, the fluid discharge operation valve 92 switches its fluid passage by push button operation to discharge fluid supplied to the expandable member 12 thereby lifting down the pallet supporting member 5. Consequently, it is possible to select appropriately a configuration (1) in which the pallet supporting member 5 is lifted up by operating the push button valve 19 and the contact valve 7 makes contact with the stopper member 32 to lift down the pallet supporting member 5 and a configuration (2) in which lifting up/down of the pallet<br>
105<br><br>
supporting member 5 is remote-controlled through the remote control portion 90 at a place far away from the carrier unit 1 (for example, driver's seat of a fork lift). It is preferable to use the (1) and (2) at the same time in order to intensify the safety.<br>
Further, it is permissible to provide the remote control portion 90 with the fluid supply operation valve 91, the fluid discharge operation valve 92, and the valve 93 as shown in FIG. 47 instead of providing the carrier unit 1 with the contact valve 7 and the push button valve 19.<br>
Further, in the carry-in/out operation of the embodiment 1 and the embodiment 2, jointing or separation of a truck head (operation drive section) to the chassis on which a container is placed can be selected appropriately. [Embodiment 3] [0097]<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be described specifically about the embodiment 3 with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
In the embodiment 3, it is assumed that two independent carrying object loading pallets Pb (see FIG. 60) are carried (carried out from/into) to the container C using the carrier unit 41 (substantially 1/2 the size of the floor surface of the container C) including no other lift units 42c, 42d like the above-described embodiment 2. As the carrying object to be loaded on this pallet Pb, a relatively heavy press die B (for example, about 10 ton) is exemplified. For this transportation method, it is assumed that a large sized fork lift F (about 10-t type) which cannot travel into the container C is used. Further,<br>
106<br><br>
it is assumed that this transportation method is executed in conditions in which the side of the opening portion cl of the container C loaded on the chassis of the truck is located adjacent to the stage 98 (platform (for example, 5 t/m2 in withstand load)). Further, for this transportation method, it is assumed that a movable stage 99 which can be carried with a large sized fork lift F is used. [0098] (1)  Carry-out operation and effect of carrier unit<br>
First, as shown in FIG. 48, the container C storing the carrying object loading pallet Pb is carried to a predetermined work place adjacent to the stage 98 with a truck and the horizontality of the container C placed on the chassis is adjusted with the landing gear. Then, the door of the container C is opened and the carrying object loading pallet Pb placed on the floor surface on the side of the opening portion cl of the container C is carried to a desired position out of the container C with a large sized fork lift F. [0099]<br>
After that, as shown in FIG. 49, the movable stage 99 on whose floor surface the carrier unit 41 is loaded is carried onto the floor surface on the side of the opening portion cl of the container C with the large sized fork lift. At this time, the floor surface of the movable stage 99 is on substantially the same level as the floor surface of the container C. Next, a fixing band (not shown) fixing the carrier unit 41 to the movable stage 99 is removed and the carrier unit 41 is run oh the floor surface of the movable stage 99 and the container C by an operator and pushed to the deep side of the container C, so<br>
107<br><br>
that it invades the bottom open space Pb4 on the carrying object<br>
loading pallet Pb.<br>
[0100]<br>
After that, the air hose 56 is connected to the joint 54 of the carrier unit 41 and an end of the wire rope 34 whose other end is connected to a large sized fork lift F is engaged with the ring-like member 48. If the fluid supply operation valve 91 (lift-up button) of the remote control portion 90 (see the phantom line in FIG. 9) is depressed under this condition, compression air is supplied to the expandable member 52 so as to expand the expandable member 52. Consequently, the pallet supporting member 45 is lifted up, so that the carrying object loading pallet Pb is brought up form the floor surface of the container C with the pallet supporting member 45. [0101]<br>
After that, if the large sized fork lift F is run in a direction of leaving the container C as shown in FIG. 50, the carrier unit 41 is pulled through the wire rope 34 and consequently, the carrying object loading pallet Pb is run on the floor surface of the container C from the deep side to the side of the opening portion cl together with this carrier unit 41. Then, if the carrying object loading pallet Pb is run up to the floor surface on the side of the opening portion cl of the container C, the contact valve 47 (or fluid discharge valve 92 of the remote control portion 90) is operated by an operator and compression air supplied to the expandable member 52 is discharged out. Then, the expandable member 52 is contracted so that the pallet supporting, member 45 is lifted down and the carrying object loading pallet Pb supported by this pallet<br>
108<br><br>
supporting member 45 is placed on the floor surface on the side<br>
of the opening portion cl of the container C.<br>
[0102]<br>
After that, as shown in FIG. 51, an empty movable stage 99 is carried up to the floor surface on the side of the opening portion cl of the container C by the large sized fork lift F and then, the carrier unit 41 is pulled out onto the floor surface of the movable stage 99. After that, as shown in FIG. 52, the carrying object loading pallet Pb placed on the floor surface on the side of the opening portion cl of the container C is carried up to a desired position out of the container C by the large sized fork lift F and then, a sequential carry-out work is finished. [0103]<br>
In this carry-out method, a pallet Pb loaded with a relatively heavy press die B can be carried out with safety from the container C mounted on the chassis of a truck without placing the container C removed from the chassis of the truck with a large size crane or the like on floor. As a result, railroad transportation of a press die with a container, which is conventionally difficult can be realized, so that transportation time (lead time) can be largely reduced depending on geographical factor. [0104]<br>
Although according to this embodiment, as shown in FIGS. 51, 52, the carrying object loading pallet Pb is placed on the floor surface on the side of the opening portion cl of the container C, after that, the carrier unit 41 just under the carrying object loading pallet Pb is carried out of the<br>
109<br><br>
container C and the carrying object loading pallet Pb is carried out of the container C, the present invention is not restricted to this example. For example, as shown in FIG. 53 and 54, it is permissible to run the carrier unit 41 just under the carrying object loading pallet Pb to the deep side, carry out the carrying object loading pallet Pb from the container C with a large sized fork lift F and then carry the transportation container 41 out of the container C. [0105] (2)  Carry-in operation of the carrier unit<br>
First, as shown in FIG. 55, an empty container C is carried to a predetermined wok place adjacent to the stage 98 with a truck and the horizontality of the container C mounted on the chassis is adjusted with a landing gear. Then, the door of the container C is opened and the carrying object loading pallet Pb is carried onto the floor surface on the side of the opening portion cl of the container C with a large sized fork lift F. [0106]<br>
After that, as shown in FIG. 56, the movable stage 99 loaded with the carrier unit 41 is carried onto the floor surface on the side of the opening portion cl of the container C with a large sized fork lift F. At this time, the floor surface of the movable stage 99 is on substantially the same level as the floor surface of the container C. Next, a fixing band (not shown) fixing the carrier unit 41 to the movable stage 99 is removed and the carrier unit 41 is pushed along the floor surface to the deep side of the container C by an operator, so that it invades the bottom open space Pb4 on the carrying object loading pallet Pb.<br>
110<br><br>
[0107]<br>
After that, the air hose 56 is connected to the carrier unit 41 and a pushing member 31 (attachment) is attached to the pawl portion f of the large sized fork lift F. By operating the fluid supply operation valve 91 (lift-up button) of the remote control poz-tion 90 (see the phantom line in FIG. 9) under this condition, the pallet supporting member 45 is lifted up so that the carrying object loading pallet Pb is raised from the floor surface of the container C with this pallet supporting member 45. [0108]<br>
After that, when the large sized fork lift F is run in a direction of approaching the container C from a state in which the front end of the pushing member 31 touches the carrier unit 41 as shown in FIG. 57, the carrier unit 41 and the carrying object loading pallet Pb are pushed into the deep side of the container C. Then, the contact valve 47 of the carrier unit 41 is operated by an operator during that run and the pallet supporting member 45 is lifted down and as a consequence, the carrying object loading pallet Pb supported by this pallet supporting member 45 is placed on the floor surface on the deep side of the container C. [0109]<br>
Next, the air hose 56 connected to the carrier unit 41 is removed and after that, as shown in FIG. 58, an empty movable stage 99 is carried up to the floor surface on the side of the opening portion cl of the container C with a large sized fork lift F and the carrier unit 41 is pulled out onto the floor surface of this movable stage 99. After that, as shown in FIG. 59, the carrying object loading pallet Pb is carried onto the<br>
111  .<br><br>
floor surface on the side of the opening portion cl of the container C with a large sized fork lift F and then, a sequential carry-in work is finished. [0110]<br>
In this carry-in method, a pallet Pb loaded with a relatively heavy press die B can be carried into the container C mounted on the chassis of a truck with the safety without placing the container C removed from the chassis of the truck with a large size crane or the like on floor. As a result, railroad transportation of a press die with a container, which is conventionally difficult, can be realized, so that transportation time (lead time) can be largely reduced depending on geographical factor. [0111]<br>
Although according to this embodiment, as shown in FIG. 60, two pallet jointed bodies Pb each prepared by jointing two pallets (substantially 1/4 the size of the container floor surface) with a joint tool 97 (for example, a clamp device or the like) are accommodated in a container while a press die (for example, about 10 ton) is loaded on each pallet jointed body Pb, the present invention is not restricted to this example. For example, as shown in FIG. 61, it is permissible to accommodate a pallet each on both ends in the longitudinal direction while accommodating the pallet jointed body Pb between the respective pallets. Here, for example, a relatively light press die (for example, about 3 ton) is loaded on each pallet and a relatively heavy press die (for example, about 10 ton) can be loaded on the pallet jointed body Pb. In this case, the carrying object loading pallet jointed body Pb is carried by the carrier unit 41<br>
112<br><br>
and the carrying object loading pallet is carried by a small sized fork lift which can enter into the carrier unit 41 or the container C. Further, even in case of loading two press dies (for example, about 3 ton) on two pallet jointed bodies Pb as shown in FIG. 62, each carrying object loading pallet jointed body Pb can be carried with the carrier unit 41. Further, container transportation can be carried out stably in conditions in which respective pallet jointed bodies Pb or the pallet jointed body Pb and an independent pallet are jointed together with the joint tool 97a, that is, the pallet jointed body substantially as large as the floor surface of the container is accommodated within the container. In this case, when carrying in the carrying object loading pallet, the carry-in can be executed by a single procedure effectively while securing the straight advancing performance by using a pallet jointed body substantially as large as the floor surface of the container and when carrying out a carrying object loading pallet, a plurality of carrying object loading pallets can be carried out successively after the joint tool 97a is removed.<br>
Although the embodiment 3 is so constructed that the carrying object loading pallet Pb is lifted down together with the pallet supporting member 45 by operator's operating the contact valve 47, the present invention is not restricted to this example. It is permissible to provide the stopper member 32 like the embodiments 1, 2 so that the carrying object loading pallet Pb is lifted down together with the pallet supporting member 45 when the stopper member 32 makes contact with the contact valve 47. Consequently, more safe transportation can be achieved.     <br>
113<br><br>
Although as the embodiment 3, a configuration of<br>
transportation using the stage 98 (platform) is exemplified, the present invention is not restricted to this example. For example, it is permissible to carry a carrying object to the container C using a large sized fork lift F and movable stage 99, which travel on the ground, without using the stage 98. Further, it is permissible to carry the carrying object to the container C placed on the floor.<br>
Although in the embodiment 1, 3, the horizontality of the container C placed on the chassis is adjusted with the landing gear when carrying the carrying object loading pallet, the present invention is not restricted to this example. For example, this carrying may be executed without use of the landing gear.<br>
Although according to the embodiment 3, the carrying is executed in conditions in which the truck head (drive section) is connected to the chassis, jointing/separation of the truck head (drive section) can be selected appropriately like the embodiment 1 and 2. [Embodiment 4] [0112]<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be described specifically about the embodiment 4 with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
As the "transportation container" of the present invention, according to the embodiment 4, a dry container C (hereinafter described as just container C) 40 feet long in which an opening portion cl is formed on an end in the longitudinal direction is exemplified. As the "pallet" of the<br>
114<br><br>
present invention, a pallet jointed body 100A prepared by jointing two pallets 100, 100 formed in a module substantially 1/2 the length in the longitudinal direction of the container C is exemplified. Further, as the "carrying object" of the present invention,,heavy freight, long freight, bulky freight and the like, loaded on the pallet jointed body 100A, is exemplified. Further as the "carrier unit" of the present invention, two carrier units 101, 101, right and left, capable of carrying the pallet jointed body 100A loaded with the carrying object is exemplified. In the meantime, a carrier unit 101 has substantially the same structure as the carrier unit 41 described in the embodiment 2. Like reference numerals are attached to the same components and detailed description thereof is omitted. [0113] (1)  Structure of carrier unit<br>
In the carrier unit 101 of the embodiment 4, as shown in FIG. 64, projecting pieces 102 projecting sideway are provided on right and left side faces of the pallet supporting member 45. A guide roller 103 (exemplified as "guided portion" of the present invention) which is guided by a guide tool described later, is supported rotatably around a vertical axis each projecting piece 102. The guide rollers 103 are provided in plural quantities (four positions in FIG. 63) along the carrying direction Q of the carrying object in a single carrier unit 101. [0114]<br>
Next, the structure (exemplified as "guide means" of the present invention) of the guide tool 105 used in the embodiment 4 will be described.<br>
115<br><br>
This guide tool 105 has a long guide main body 106 having a substantially U shaped vertical section extending along the carrying direction Q of a carrying object as shown in FIGS. 63, 64. As shown in FIG. 66, this guide main body 106 is comprised of a flat floor portion 106a on which the rotation roller 44 of the carrier unit 101 is capable of running, right, left guide wall portions 106b which are elevated from right, left edges of this floor portion 106a for guiding the guide roller 103 of the carrier unit 101 and right, left horizontal wall portions 106c extending sideway from the top end of each guide wall portion 106b. [0115]<br>
Plural supporting members 107 are fixed on the bottom face of each horizontal wall portion 106c at a predetermined interval along the carrying direction Q. A vertically-moving shaft 108 is supported by a through hole 107a formed in each supporting member 107 such that it is capable of moving vertically. A vertically-moving member 111 which supports a rolling ball 110 (exemplified as "running portion" of the present invention) for running on the floor surface is connected to the bottom end of each vertically-moving shaft 108. Further, a spring member 112 (exemplified as "elastic member" of the present invention) for urging the guide main body 106 upward with respect to the vertically-moving member 111 is provided between each vertically-moving member 111 and each supporting member 107. The urging force of this spring member 112 is set to a value larger than the total weight of the guide main body 106 and the carrier unit 101. Therefore, when only the carrier unit 101 is loaded on the floor portion 106a of the guide main<br>
116<br><br>
body 106 without loading with the carrying object loading pallet<br>
jointed body 100A, the guide main body 102 is kept floating from<br>
the floor surface by the urging force of the spring member 112<br>
(see FIG. 66) .<br>
[0116]<br>
(2)  Carry-in operation of carrier unit<br>
Next, the carry-in operation of carrying object into the container C using the carrier unit 101 having the above-described structure and the guide tool 105 will be described.<br>
First, an empty container C is carried to a predetermined work place adjacent to the stage 114 with a truck and placed on the floor. As shown in FIG. 67, the guide tool 105 accommodating the carrier unit 101 is prepared on the floor surface of this stage 114. At this time, the guide main body 106 is kept floating from the floor surface of the stage 114 so that the guide tool 105 is capable of running (see FIG. 66). [0117]<br>
Next, as shown in FIG. 68, a first jig 115a capable of positioning the front end of the guide tool 105 is disposed on the deep side of the container C. From this condition, the guide tool 105 is pushed into the container C in conditions in which the carrier unit 101 is accommodated and run on the floor surfaces of the stage 114 and container C, and then positioned within the container C. The front end of this guide tool 105 is engaged with (fixed on) the first jig 115a and the proximal end of the guide tool 105 is engaged with (fixed on) a second jig 115b, so as to position and fix the guide tool 105 within the container C. Next, the pallet jointed body 100A loaded with a carrying object to be carried in is prepared on the floor<br>
117<br><br>
surface of the stage 114. [0118]<br>
After that, the carrier unit 101 is pulled out from the guide tool 105 to the side of the stage 114 and run on the floor portion 106a of the guide main body 106 and the floor surface of the stage 114 and then, as shown in FIG. 69, positioned under the pallet.jointed body 100A. With this condition, by supplying air to the expandable member 52 in the carrier unit 101, the pallet jointed body 100A is brought up from below by the pallet supporting member 45, so that it is kept floating from the floor surface of the stage 114. Next, a well known handling means 116 capable of assisting operator's transportation work using driving with air is connected to the proximal end of the carrier unit 101. [0119]<br>
Next, by operating the handling means 116, the carrier unit 101 loaded with the carrying object loading pallet jointed body 100A is pushed into the container C and the carrier unit 101 is run on the stage 114 of the carrier unit 101 and the floor portion 106a of the guide main body 106. At this time, the guide roller 103 of the carrier unit 101 is guided by the guide wall portion 106b of the guide main body 106. Then, the carrying object loading pallet jointed body 100A is accommodated in the container C together with the carrier unit 101 as shown in FIG. 70. [0120]<br>
By discharging air from the expandable member 52 of the carrier unit 101, the pallet supporting member 45 is lifted down, so that the pallet jointed body 100A is placed on the floor<br>
118<br><br>
surface of the container C (see FIG. 65). After that, the guide<br>
tool 105 accommodating the carrier unit 101 is pulled out to the<br>
side of the stage 114 as shown in FIG. 71 and a sequential carry<br>
operation is finished.<br>
[0121]<br>
(3)  Effect of the embodiment 4<br>
According to the embodiment 4, when carrying a carrying object into the container C, the guide rollers 103 provided on the carrier units 101, 101 are guided by the guide wall portion 106b of the guide tool 105 disposed in the container C. Hence, a carrying object loading pallet loaded with heavy freight, long freight or bulky freight can be carried into the container C 40 feet long with an excellent straight advancing performance. As a result, the carrying object loading pallet can be prevented from rubbing the inner wall of a dry container like conventionally when a carrying object is carried out of the dry container, thereby the carrying object loading pallet being carried out smoothly. Further, the pallet can be prevented from colliding with the inner wall of the dry container thereby protecting the inner wall of the pallet or dry container from a damage. [0122]<br>
Because according to the embodiment 4, the guide main body 106 is provided between the guide main body 106 and the vertically-moving member 111 with the spring member 112 which supports the vertically-moving member 111 having the rolling ball 110 such that it is capable of moving vertically freely and urges the guide main body 106 upward with respect to the vertically-moving member 111, the guide tool 105 can be run on<br>
119<br><br>
the floor surfaces of the stage 114 and the container C and the guide tool 105 can be lifted up/down with respect to the floor surface. As a result, installation/removal of the guide tool 105 into/from the container can be executed easily and rapidly. Further, because according to the embodiment 4, the guide tool 105 is provided with the floor portion 106a on which the rotation roller 44 of the carrier unit 101 is capable of running, the guide tool 105 can be run on the floor surface of the stage 114 or the container C in conditions in which the carrier unit 101 is accommodated, so that the installation/removal of the guide tool 105 can be carried out easily and rapidly. [0123]<br>
Although as the embodiment 4, carry-in work of a carrying object using the carrier unit 101 and the guide tool 105 is exemplified, the present invention is not restricted to this example. For example, if an opposite procedure to the above-described carry-in work is taken, carry-out work for the carrying object can be achieved using the carrier unit 101 and the guide tool 105.<br>
Although according to the embodiment 4, a carrying object is carried to the container C placed on the floor, the present invention is not restricted to this example. For example, it is permissible to carry the carrying object to a container mounted on the chassis of a truck.<br>
Although according to the embodiment 4, a carrying object loading pallet about 40 feet long is carried into a dry container 40 feet long by a single carry-in operation, the present invention is not restricted to this example. For example, it is permissible to carry carrying object loading<br>
120<br><br>
pallets each about 20 feet long (or pallet jointed bodies) successively by two carry-in operations into the dry container 40 feet long. In this case, each carrying object loading pallet can be carried into the dry container successively with an excellent straight advancing performance and consequently, it is possible to prevent an occurrence of an event that a second carrying object loading pallet cannot be accommodated in the dry container because a first carrying object loading pallet is carried in its tilting condition.<br>
Although in the embodiment 4, the dry container 40 feet long is employed, the present invention is not restricted to this example, but for example, a dry container 20 feet long may be used.<br>
Although in the embodiment 4, the guide tool 105 capable of running with the rotation rollers 110 is exemplified, the present invention is not restricted to this example. For example, it is permissible to adopt a rotation roller 121 capable of rotating around its horizontal axis as the guide tool 120 capable of running as shown in FIG. 72.<br>
Although in the embodiment 4, the guide roller 103 of the carrier unit 101 is guided by the guide wall portion 106b of the guide tool 105, the present invention is not restricted to this example. Right, left Side faces 45b (guided faces) of the pallet supporting member 45 of the carrier unit 101 may be guided by the guide roller 122 provided on the guide tool 120. Although in the embodiment 4, the guide tool 105 capable of running with the rotation rollers 110 and having the floor portion 106a on which the carrier unit 101 is capable of running is exemplified, the present invention is not restricted to this<br>
121<br><br>
example, but for example, it is permissible to employ a guide tool 123 placed on the stage 114 and the floor of the container C without provision of the rotation roller 110 and the floor portion 106a.<br>
Although in the embodiment 4, the guide tool 105 having a length substantially the same as the entire length of the container C is exemplified, the present invention is not restricted to this example, but for example, it is permissible to employ a guide tool having a length 0.5, 1.5 or two or more times the entire length of the container C. [0124]<br>
Further, although in the embodiment 4, a configuration in which the guide roller 103 of the carrier unit 101 is guided by the guide tool 105 is exemplified, the present invention is not restricted to this example. For example, as shown in FIG. 74 and 75, a guide roller 126 (exemplified as "pallet side guided portion" of the present invention) provided on a pallet 125 may be guided by the inner wall (exemplified as "guide means" of the present invention) of the container C. Further, as shown in FIG. 76, a guide roller 126 (exemplified as "pallet side guided portion" of the present invention) provided on the pallet 125 may be guided by a square pipe member (exemplified as "guide means" of the present invention) placed on the floor of the container. Even such configurations can exert the same effect as the embodiment 4.<br>
