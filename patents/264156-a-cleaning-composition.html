				<td>ENZYME AND FABRIC HUEING AGENT CONTAINING COMPOSITIONS<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION This invention relates to compositions comprising lipases and fabric hueing agents and processes for making and using such products.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The appearance of lipase enzymes suitable for detergent applications gave the formulator a new approach to improve grease removal. Such enzymes catalyse the hydrolysis of triglycerides which form a major component of many commonly encountered fatty soils such as sebum, animal fats (e.g. lard, ghee, butter) and vegetable oils (e.g. olive oil, sunflower oil, peanut oil). However these enzymes typically showed weak performance in the first wash cycle and typically came with a malodor arising, it is believed, from hydrolysis of fats present in dairy soils like milks, cream, butter and yogurt. While not being bound by theory, it is believed that such soils are prone to lipase-induced malodor generation as they contain triglycerides functionalized with short chain (e.g. C4) fatty acyl units which release malodorous volatile fatty acids after lipolysis. Even the when the performance of such enzymes was improved, the malodor issue remained. Thus, the use of this technology was severely limited.<br>
We have found that the combination of a fabric hueing agent with certain lipase variants gives rise to an improved cleaning performance benefit, while minimising unacceptable malodor. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the following mechanisms are likely to give rise to such benefits: selected lipase variants increase the level of grease removal thus leading to better accessibility of the fabric hueing agent to the fabric surface and hence, improved deposition. The resulting combination of improved oily soil removal and shading colorant deposition leads to a improvement in fabric appearance; even where oily soil isn't adequately removed, the hydrolyai3 of fats into more hydrophilic fatty acids, mono- and di glyceridc leads to improved shading colorant deposition and, hence, cleaning perception; and the presence of dye molecules deposited in the oily soils present on fabrics may inhibit enzyme activity mat gives rise to malodor.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to compositions comprising lipases and fabric hueing agents and processes for making and using such products.<br>

Method of Use<br>
The present invention includes a method for cleaning and /or treating a situs inter alia a surface or fabric. Such method includes the steps of contacting an embodiment of Applicants' cleaning composition, in neat form or diluted in a wash liquor, with at least a portion of a surface or fabric then optionally rinsing such surface, or fabric. The surface or fabric may be subjected to a washing step prior to the aforementioned rinsing step. For purposes of the present invention, washing includes but is not limited to, scrubbing, and mechanical agitation. As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, the cleaning compositions of the present invention are ideally suited for use in laundry applications. Accordingly, the present invention includes a method for laundering a fabric. The method comprises the steps of contacting a fabric to be laundered with a said cleaning laundry solution comprising at least one embodiment of Applicants' cleaning composition, cleaning additive or mixture thereof. The fabric may comprise most any fabric capable of being laundered in normal consumer use conditions. The solution preferably has a pH of from about 8 to about 10.5. The compositions may be employed at concentrations of from about 500 ppm to about 15,000 ppm in solution. The water temperatures typically range from about 5 °C to, about 90 °C. The water to fabric ratio is typically from about 1:1 to about 30:1.<br>
TEST METHOD 1 A protocol to define whether a dye or pigment material is a fabric hueing agent for the purpose of the invention is given here:<br><br>
1.)     Fill two tergotometer pots with 800ml of Newcastle upon Tyne, UK, City Water (~12 grains per US gallon total hardness, supplied by Northumbrian Water, Pity Me, Durham, Co. Durham, UK).<br>
2)	Insert pots into tergotometer, with water temperature controlled at 30°C and agitation set at 40rpm for the duration of the experiment<br>
3)	Add 4.8g of IEC-B detergent (IEC 60456 Washing Machine Reference Base Detergent Type B), supplied by wfk, Bruggen-Bracht, Germany, to each pot.<br>
4)	After two minutes, add 2.0mg active colorant to the first pot.<br>
5)	After one minute, add 50g of flat cotton vest (supplied by Warwick Equest, Consett, County Durham, UK), cut into 5cm x 5cm swatches, to each pot.<br>
6)	After 10 minutes, drain the pots and re-fill with cold Newcastle upon Tyne City Water (16°C)<br>
7)	After 2 minutes rinsing, remove fabrics<br>
8)	Repeat steps 3-7 for a further three cycles using the same treatments<br>
9)	Collect and line dry the fabrics indoors for 12 hours<br>
10)	Analyse the swatches using a Hunter Miniscan spectrometer fitted with D65 illuminant and UVA cutting filter, to obtain Hunter a (red-green axis) and Hunter b (yellow-blue axis) values.<br>
11)	Average the Hunter a and Hunter b values for each set of fabrics. If the fabrics treated with colorant under assessment show an average difference in hue of greater than 0.2 units on either the a axis or b axis, it is deemed to be a fabric hueing agent for the purpose of the invention.<br>
