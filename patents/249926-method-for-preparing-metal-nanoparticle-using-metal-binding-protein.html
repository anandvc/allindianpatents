METHOD FOR PREPARING METAL NANOPARTICLE USING METAL BINDING PROTEIN<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a method for preparing heavy metal nanoparticles using a heavy metal-binding protein, and more particularly to a method for preparing heavy metal structures, comprising the steps of culturing a microorganism, which is transformed with a gene encoding a heavy metal-binding protein, in a heavy metal ion-containing medium, to produce heavy metal structures in the microorganism, and collecting the produced heavy metal structures, as well as nanoparticles of heavy metal structures produced according to said method.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Quantum dots are nanometer-size semiconductor particles, which emit light when they are excited with energy such as light, and the color of the emitted light depends on the size of the particles. That is. when the size of the particles is decreased to reduce the dimension of the particles, the electronic state density and energy thereof will be varied, and thus the characteristics of the particles will vary depending on the dimension thereof. For example, quantum hall effect, which does not appear in three-dimensional systems, is observed in two-dimensional systems. As used herein, the term "reducing dimension" in the strict sense means that electrons are confined to an area smaller than the de Broglie wavelength. A zero-dimensional quantum dot is not a dot having no area, but rather refers to a sample having a three-dimensional size smaller than the de Broglie wavelength. In quantum mechanics, a wave in all material particles with momentum, that is. the de Broglie wavelength, varies depending on material and is about 10 nm for semiconductor material.<br><br>
As shown in FIG. 1. a quantum dot is generally in the form of a sphere consisting of a core and a shell and contains, in addition to Zn, S and Cd illustrated in FIG. 1, other various heavy metals.<br>
Methods for preparing quantum dots can be broadly divided into two categories: lithographic methods using a light source such as a laser: and chemical synthesis methods. The synthesis of quantum dots by chemical method has an advantage in that it can produce quantum dots using a relatively simple system compared to the lithographic method, but this method still has a lot of technical problems to be solved in order to produce a large amount of quantum dots in a cost-effective manner. Also, in comparison with quantum dots prepared using the prior bulk method, quantum dots prepared using molecular chemical technique have excellent optical stability, and their optical properties can be controlled so as to emit light at various wavelengths depending on the size, shape and component of nanomaterials. For this reason, it has become possible to apply quantum dot-based nanomaterials in the biological field. This indicates that the quantum dot-based nanomaterials can be widely used as not only biosensors, but also contrast agents for in vivo optical imaging, and the possibility thereof has recently been proven through various studies (Jovin, Nat. BiotechnoL. 21:32. 2003; Wu et ai, Nat. BiotechnoL, 21:41, 2003; Alivisatos, Nat. BiotechnoL, 22:47. 2004; Gao et al., Nat. BiotechnoL, 22:969. 2004; Lidke et al., Nat. BiotechnoL, 22:198. 2004).<br>
As typical examples thereof, techniques capable of tracking the signal transduction of live cells in vitro were developed, and one example thereof is an approach to the HER2/neu pathway. This overcomes the shortcoming of existing organic fluorophores. in that they readily lose their optical stability, such that they cannot track continuous cell changes (Wu et aL, Nat. BiotechnoL, 21:41. 2003; Lidke et al, Nat. BiotechnoL, 22:198. 2004). Also, in order to track erbB/HER receptor-mediated  signal  transduction  in live cells,  an epidermal<br><br>
growth factor (EGF) was conjugated to quantum dots and activated through binding to an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Then, the process of hicorporation of the quantum dot conjugate-conjugated EGFR into cells was tracked (Lidke et ciL, Nat. BiotechnoL. 22:198. 2004). This method enabled biological processes in live cells to be observed in real time.<br>
Furthermore, to overcome a shortcoming of insufficient //; vivo permeability, semiconductor nanocrystals, which can use wavelengths in the near infrared range, were developed, thus making in vivo image acquisition possible (Gao et oL, Nat. BiotechnoL, 22:969, 2004). In this method, in order to effectively make quantum dots soluble and, at the same time, effectively deliver quantum dots in vivo, quantum dots (ZnS-capped CdSe) were coated with a triblock copolymer, and a monoclonal antibody is conjugated to the reactive group of the coated polymer.<br>
In addition, to overcome a shortcoming of low in vivo permeability of optical imaging, quantum dots, which can be adjusted to the near infrared wavelength, were developed. For example, quantum dots having the near infrared wavelength were used to optically image the sentinel lymph node in the armpit of mice (Kim et al, Nat. BiotechnoL. 22:93. 2004). Such nanomaterials show physical properties different from those of the bulk method as shown in quantum dots, and thus have the potentiality to be used in magnetic resonance imaging.<br>
Meanwhile, methods for treating metal ions in the environment generally include chemical, physical and biological treatment methods. The biological treatment method employs the biological mechanisms of microorganisms themselves, and microbial mechanisms, including biosorption &amp; bioaccumulation. oxidation &amp; reduction, metal-organic complexation and insoluble complex formation, provide an important technical foundation for restoring the environment contaminated with heavy metal (Vails and de Lorenzo, FEMS MicrohioL Rev.. 26:327. 2002).<br><br>
Furthermore, with the development of molecular biology, a recent attempt to develop strains having an increased ability to bind heavy metals suggests the possibility to improve prior biological treatment methods. Microorganisms synthesize heavy metal-binding proteins to remove heavy metals in vivo and ex vivo through bioaccumulation, and these proteins are involved in the storage or regulation of concentration of intracellular metal ions.<br>
Recently, it was found that peptides, called phytocheiatins, which naturally bind to harmful elements, such as lead, mercury and cadmium, to detoxify these elements, are produced by fungi and plants, exposed to heavy metals. Phytocheiatins have a structure of (gamma-Glu-Cys)n-Gly (n=2-7) and accumulate metal ions through the formation of peptide-meta! conjugates (Cobbett. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol., 3:21 1. 2000). In addition, as other kinds of heavy metal-binding proteins, low-molecular proteins called metallothioneins have been much studied, and these proteins have a high content of cysteine and bind to cadmium, zinc, nickel, copper and the like (Hamer. Anirti. Rev. Biochem., 55:913. 1986; Wu and Lin, Biosens. Bioelectron.. 20:864. 2004).<br>
Meanwhile, patent documents relating to the preparation of quantum dots include: Korean Patent Registration No. 10-0540801. entided "'Method of preparing quantum dots using metal powder": Korean Patent Registration No. 10-0526828. entitled "Method of preparing quantum dots having uniform distribution by irradiating magnetic membrane or semiconductor membrane with laser"; Korean Patent Registration No. 10-0541516. entitled "Method for forming quantum dots of semiconductor material"; and Korean Patent Registration No. 10-0279739, entitled "Method for forming nanometer-size silicon quantum dots. However, these methods are methods of preparing quantum dots through the physical binding of metal materials.<br><br>
Having paid attention to that the component of a quantum dot is synthesized by a regular arrangement of cadmium (Cd). selenium (Se). zinc (Zn) and tellurium (Te). the present inventors expressed a heavy metal-binding protein using a bioengineering method. As a result, the present inventors have found that it is possible to synthesize highly economical quantum dots in vivo, and also used the above biological system to prepare quantum dots having optical stability, thereby completing the present invention.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION, AND PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
In the present invention, in order to introduce and express a heavy metal-binding protein gene in E. coli and then synthesize quantum dots depending on the adsorption and accumulation of heavy metals by the expression of the metal-binding protein in the E. coli cells, a plasmid was constructed such that phytochelatin synthase- and metallothionein-encoding genes, encoding heavy metal-binding proteins, would be expressed alone or in combination. Then, E. coli was transformed with the plasmid and cultured to produce heavy metal-binding protein in the cells, the cells were then cultivated in media containing each of heavy metal ions, and whether the heavy metal structures synthesized in the cells would be quantum dots was examined by qualitative analysis and fluorescence analysis.<br><br>
in one aspect, the present invention relates to a method for preparing nanoparticles of heavy metal structures, the method comprising the steps of: culturing a microorganism, which is transformed with a gene encoding a heavy metal-binding protein, in a heavy metal ion-containing medium, to produce heavy metal structures in the microorganism: and collecting the produced heavy metal structures, as well as nanoparticles of heavy metal structures, which are prepared according to said method, have a diameter of 5-120nm and are in the form of spheres.<br>
In the present invention, the heavy metal structures are preferably nanoparticles. and the nanoparticles are preferably quantum dots.<br>
In the present invention, the heavy metal-binding protein can be derived from any one selected from the group consisting of Homo sapiens. Arahidopsis thaliana. Ornamental tobacco. Miis miiscuhts. Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Pseudomonas putida and Escherichia coli. but the scope of the present invention is not limited thereto.<br>
In the present invention, phytochelatin synthase and metallothionein were illustrated as heavy metal-binding proteins, but it will be obvious to one skilled in the art that other proteins or peptides having properties equal or similar to those of said proteins may also be used in the present invention.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention relates to a recombinant microorganism having the ability to produce heavy metal structures, the microorganism being transformed with an expression vector containing a heavy metal-binding protein-encoding gene or a portion thereof.<br><br>

The method of the present invention comprises a step of culturing E. coli transformed with a recombinant vector, which expresses Arahidopsis thoUana-derived phytochelatin synthase and Fseudomonas putida-deiived metallothionein alone or in combination, to express a heavy metal-binding protein in the E. coli cells. In the present invention, the heavy metal-binding protein is preferably fused to the C-terminal or N-terminal end of said protein.<br>

Recombinant plasmid pTJl-AtPCS. which is used in an embodiment of the present invention to transform E. coli so as to express phytochelatin synthase, comprises a phytochelatin synthase-encoding gene, an ampicillin-resistance gene, and a trc promoter for expression induction. In order to express phytochelatin synthase in E. coli. a phytochelatin synthase protein-encoding gene was constructed by synthesizing two primers from a base sequence (cDNA) complementary to the chromosomal DNA of A. thaliana and performing PCR using the primers. Also, a fusion gene of phytochelatin synthase and metallothionein was constructed by obtaining a heavy metal-binding gene of metallothionein from the chromosomal DNA of P. putida by PCR using a base sequence deposited in the GenBank and subjecting the gene to overlapping PCR. Also, an ampicillin-resistance gene can be used for strain screening.<br><br>
The phytochelatin synthase and metallothionein obtained from the strain was expressed alone or in combination, and the cells containing the protein expressed therein were cultured m a heavy metal-containing medium and observed at each of growth stages and each of heavy metal concentrations. As a result, it could be seen that heavy metals were adsorbed and accumulated in the cells to form quantum dots having a regular arrangement. From the quantum dots //; vivo, quantum dots could be readily collected by subjecting the in vivo quantum dots to a simple cell disruption process and filtering the disrupted cells through a membrane having a pore size of a few hundreds of nanometers.<br>

Example 1: Preparation of expression vector of heavy metal-binding protein<br>
(1) Preparation of expression vector of phytochelatin .synthase<br>
In order to obtain an AtPCS gene (NCBl accession No. AF46118()) that synthesize phytochelatin .synthase, PCR was performed using, as template DNA, complementary DNA (cDNA) of A. thaliana represented by a base sequence of SEQ ID NO: 5 [A. thaliana phytochelatin .synthase) and using primers of SEQ ID NO: 1 and SEQ ID NO: 2.    The PCR reaction was performed in the following<br>
conditions: initial denaturation at 94°C for 7 min; 30 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 1 min, annealing at 55°C for 1 min and extension at 72°C for 1 min; and<br>
then final extension at 72°C for 7 min.<br>
SEQ ID NO: 1: 5'-GGAATTCATGGCTATGGCGAGTTTAT-3'<br>
SEQ ID NO: 2: 5'-CCCAAGCTTATTAATAGGCAGGAGCAGCGAG-3'<br><br>
An about 1.5-kb DNA fragment obtained by the PCR reaction was separated using an agarose gel electrophoresis method and cut with two restriction enzymes EcoRl and HindlU. At the same time, plasmid pTac99A (Park and Lee. ,/. Bacreriol., 185:5391. 2003) having a strong inducible rcic promoter was cut with two restriction enzymes EcoR] and HindlU. Then, the plasmid was combined and ligated to the DNA fragment by T4 DNA ligase, and the ligated plasmid was transformed into E. coli DH5a by electroporation. The transformed strain was screened on an LB plate medium containing antibiotic ampicillin (100 |.ig/L), thus obtaining a pTJl-AtPCS recombinant plasmid (FIG. 2). In the prepared recombinant plasmid pTJl-AtPCS. the AtPCS gene to be used as a heavy metal-binding protein could be expressed by a strong inducible tac promoter.<br>
(2) Preparation of expression vector of metallothionein<br>
In order to obtain a P}?MT gene (NCBI accession No. NC_()02947 REGION: 3696753..3696977) that synthesizes metallothionein, PCR was performed using, as template DNA. genomic DNA of P. putida KT2440 represented by a base sequence of SEQ ID NO: 6 (P. putida KT2440 metallothionein) and using primers of SEQ ID NO: 3 and SEQ ID NO: 4.    The PCR reaction was performed<br>
in the following conditions: Initial denaturation at 94°C for 7 min; 30 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 1 min. annealing at 55°C for 1 min and extension at 72°C<br>
for 1 min; and then final extension at 72°C for 7 min.<br>
SEQ ID NO: 3: 5'-GGAATTCATGAACGATCAACGCTGCGC-3' SEQ ID NO: 4: 5'-AACTGCAGTTAGGGCGAGATCGGATCACT-3'<br>
An about 230 bp DNA fragment obtained by the PCR reaction was separated using an agarose gel electrophoresis method and cut with two restriction enzymes<br><br>
EcoRl and Pstl At the same time, piasmid pTac99A having a strong inducible tac promoter was cut with two restriction enzymes EcoRl and Psrl. Then, the piasmid was combined and ligated with the DNA fragment by T4 DNA ligase. and the ligated piasmid was transformed into E. coli DH5a by electroporation. The transformed strain was screened on an LB plate medium containing antibiotic ampicillin (100 ng/L). thus obtaining a pTJl-PpMT recombinant piasmid (FIG. 3), In the prepared recombinant piasmid pTJl-PpMT. the PpMT gene to be used as a heavy metal-binding protein could be expressed by a strong inducible tac promoter.<br>
As host cells for expressing recombinant proteins, procaryotic cells, such as E. coli and Bacillus suhtillis, which can be cultured at a high concentration within a short time, easily genetically modified and have well established physiological properties, have been widely used. However, to solve various problems, including the post-translational modification, secretion, three-dimensional active structure and activation of proteins, a wide range from microorganisms to higher organisms, including unicellular eukaryotic cells, yeasts (Pichia pastoris\ Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Hansenula polyinorpha, etc.), filamentous fungi, insect cells, plant cells, and mammalian cells, has recently been used as host ceils for protein production. Thus, it will be obvious to one skilled in the art to use not only E. coli cells illustrated in Examples, but also other host cells.<br>
Example 2; Fluorescence analysis of E. coli expressing recombinant piasmid pTJl-AtPCS<br>
Phytochelatin .synthase was prepared by culturing E. coli DH5(x transformed with recombinant piasmid pTJl-AtPCS having a strong inducible tac promoter. For this purpose, the transformed E. coli was seeded into a 500 mL flask containing 100 mL of LB liquid medium containing heavy metal ions (5 mM CdCl22.5H20,<br><br>
ZnCl..   SeO..  TeCU.   and CsCl.)  and cuhured  at  37°C.     The  pT.Il-AtPCS<br>
recombinant plasmid had the Tac promoter, and thus IPTG was added to induce gene expression. For this, when the optical density (OD) of the medium reached 0.6 as measured at a 600-nm wavelength with a spectrophotometer, 1 mM IPTG was  added to  induce gene expression.     At 4 hours  after the  induction of<br>
expression, the culture broth was centrifuged at 4°C and 6000 rpm for 5 minutes.<br>
Then, the supernatant was discarded, and the remnant was washed one time with<br>
10 mL PBS buffer (pH 7.4), centrifuged again at 4°C and 6000 rpm for 5 minutes<br>
and then suspended in 10 mL PBS buffer. 100 f.iL of the suspended sample was dispensed into each well of a 96-well black plate and analyzed for emission spectra at 360-700 nm using a fluorescent spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices. USA) (FIG. 4). As shown in FIG. 4. it could be seen that a fluorescent signal having peak emission spectrum of about 420 nm strongly appeared at UV excitation of 320 nm. This suggests that materials having; a characteristic fluorescent signal that quantum dots generate were included in the E. coli strain.<br>
Also, the E. coli strain expressing phytochelatin .vynthase was washed with distilled water, immobilized on a poly-L-lysine-coated slide glass and covered with a cover glass. Then, the fluorescent images of heavy metals accumulated in the cells were analyzed using a confocal laser scanning microscopy (LSM 510. Carl Zeiss, Germany) (FIG. 5). As a result, as shown in FIG. 5, blue fluorescence (a) coincident with an emission spectrum of about 420 nm shown in FIG. 4, and yellow fluorescence (b) having an emission spectrum of about 700 nm, could be observed in the E. coli cells. Thus, the characteristic fluorescence of nanoparticles such as quantum dots could also be observed in the intracellular heavy metal structures of the present invention.    In FIG. 5. (c) is a real image,<br><br>
and (d) indicates a merge image of (a) and (b). Also, all scale bars shown in the figure represent 5 p.<br>
Example 3: Characterization of in vivo heavy metals synthesized in E. coli expressing recombinant plasmid pT.Tl-AtPCS<br>
In order to confirm whether phytochelatin .synthase expressed by IPTG would make heavy metal structures in E. coli DH5a transformed with recombinant plasmid pTJl-AtPCS having an inducible tcic promoter, the E. coli of Example 2 was washed with distilled water and dried in a freeze dryer in a vacuum state for one day, and heavy metal accumulated in the cells were analyzed using a TEM (Technai G2, FEI, the Netherlands). As a result, it was seen that the size and shape of the heavy metal structures were uniform (FIG. 6). Also, it could be observed that heavy metal structures, which were not found in the control group (a) having no phytochelatin .synthase expressed therein, were present in the E. coli having phytochelatin .synthase expressed therein (FIG. 6b. 6c and 6d).<br>
The size of the heavy metal particles synthesized in the cells was about 5-120 nm as could be determined by the scale bar of the figure, but the scope of the present invention is not limited to this size and it is possible to prepare heavy metal particles having various sizes. Also, it could be seen that lattice-like structures, which are the characteristic structures of heavy metal nanoparticles. were formed in the E. coli cells (FIG. 6c and 6d).<br>
Moreover, heavy metal structures adsorbed in E. coli cells expressing phytochelatin synthase were analyzed by EDS using a TEM (Technai G2, FEI, the Netherlands). Herein, heavy metal structures in a portion marked on the microphotograph were analyzed and. as a result, among the components added to the medium, cadmium (Cd), zinc (Zn) and cesium (Cs) were detected (FIG. 7).<br><br>
FIG. 7 shows the results of EDS and TEM analysis of heavy metal structures accumulated in cells when E. coli having phytochelatin synthase expressed therein was cultured in a medium containing 5 mM of each of cadmium (Cd), zinc (Zn) and cesnim (Cs). according to the present invention. As shown in FIG. 7. it could be seen that, except for carbon (C) and oxygen (O). which can appear in organism E. coli. and also sodium (Na) and chlorine (CD, which are always present in the E. coli cells, zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd) and cesium (Cs) were the components of heavy metal nanoparticles in the cells.<br>
FIG. 8 shows the results of EDS and TEM analysis of heavy metal structures accumulated in cells when E. coli expressing phytochelatin synthase was cultured in a medium containing 5 mM of each of cadmium (Cd). zinc (Zn) and selenium (Se), according to the present invention. Particularly, heavy metal structures in a portion marked on the electron microphotograph were analyzed and. as a result, it was seen that the structures contained zinc (Zn) and selenium (Se) and had a high content of selenium (Se).<br>
FIG. 9 shows the results of EDS and TEM analysis of heavy metal structures accumulated in cells when E. coli expressing phytochelatin synthase was cultured in a medium containing 5 mM of each of cadmium (Cd). zinc (Zn) and tellurium (Te). according to the present invention. Heavy metal structures in a portion marked on the electron microphotograph were analyzed and. as a result, the heavy metal structures contained a small amount of zinc (Zn). selenium (Se) and cadmium (Cd) and had a high content of tellurium (Te).<br>
The size of intracellular heavy rnetal nanoparticles used in the EDS of FIGs. 7 to 9 was about 30-50 nm. In addition, it could be observed through a TEM that heavy metal particles having various sizes from about 5 nm to about 120 nm were present in the cells.<br><br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
As described and proven in detail above, the present invention provides the method of preparing heavy metal structures using a heavy metal-binding protein, quantum dots as nanoparticles prepared according to said method, and a recombinant microorganism having the ability to produce heavy metal structures, the recombinant microorganism being transformed with an expression vector containing a metal-binding protein-encoding gene or a portion thereof. Unlike the prior method of preparing quantum dots by physically binding metal materials, ill vivo quantum dots as nanoparticles. which are provided according the present invention, are synthesized by the activity of an enzyme expressed in vivo. According to the present invention, the quantum dots can be produced with high productivity through a simple process in an efficient and cost-effective manner. In addition, the quantum dots are useful because they can solve an optical stability problem that is the shortcoming of organic fluorophores.<br>
