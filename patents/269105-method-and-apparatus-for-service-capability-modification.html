METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR SERVICE CAPABILITY<br><br>
MODIFICATION<br><br>
Claim of Priority under 35 U.S.C. §120<br><br>
[0001] The present Application for Patent claims priority from U.S. Provisional<br><br>
Application No. 60/844,753, filed September 15, 2006, assigned to the assignee hereof and hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein.<br><br>
BACKGROUND<br><br>
Field<br><br>
[0002] The present invention relates generally to wireless communications, and more specifically to the modification of service capability to support simultaneous reception of services.<br><br>
Background<br><br>
[0003] In a wireless communication system, mobile stations, also known as user equipment (UE), may communicate using dedicated communication services. These dedicated communication services provide two-way communication between UE and a wireless network system. The dedicated communication services may occur at various transmission rates that are either defined or negotiated at some point in time after the UE is recognized in the system. Another commonly available communication service for sharing information in a one-to-many type arrangement has come to be known generally as a broadcast service. One of the commonly defined and accepted broadcast communication services is known as the Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS).<br><br>
[0004] Simultaneous support for a dedicated service (e.g., packet data or voice) and MBMS in a single UE has been nominally defined. A UE with the capacity to support simultaneous dedicated services (voice calls, PS data, etc.) and MBMS will necessarily have some limitations on the level of services it can simultaneously support. At a minimum, the UE Radio Access Capabilities requirement specifies that a UE be able to support a dedicated <br><br>
service of 64 kbps downlink data rate in parallel with reception of an MBMS. (See 3GPP Technical Specification 25.306.)<br><br>
[0005] However, beyond this minimum benchmark, there are no defined levels of support — thus, for instance, even if a UE can support 384 kbps together with MBMS, there is no mechanism such as defined UE classes by which this support can be indicated to the network. Furthermore, conflict resolution of available services that exceed the UE capability have been limited to very general "service prioritization" procedures for maintaining and supporting only a single one of the services by releasing the other service. (See Radio Resource Control (RRC) Protocol Specification of 3GPP Technical Specification 25.331.)<br><br>
[0006] Therefore, there is a need for a UE to determine the available competing service requirements and to manage utilization of these services within the UE in view of the available capabilities of the UE.<br><br>
SUMMARY<br><br>
[0007] Techniques to allow a UE to modify the UE 's represented or available capabilities and for allocating a portion of the UE 's actual capabilities for simultaneously supporting a second service are disclosed. Devices, methods, systems and media for performing the same are also disclosed.<br><br>
[0008] In one embodiment, a method for supporting a dedicated service is disclosed. The method includes determining a modified capability offered to maintain the dedicated service while supporting a second service. The method further includes disclosing to a system the modified capability as the available capability for reconfiguring the dedicated service.<br><br>
[0009] In another embodiment, a wireless communication device is disclosed.<br><br>
The wireless communication device includes a memory and a processor coupled with the memory. The processor is configured to determine a modified capability to maintain a dedicated service while supporting a second service; and to disclose to a system the modified capability as the available capability for reconfiguring the dedicated service.<br><br>
[0010] In yet another embodiment, an apparatus includes a means for determining a modified capability offered to maintain a dedicated service while <br><br>
supporting a second service. The apparatus further includes a means for disclosing to a system the modified capability as the available capability for reconfiguring the dedicated service.<br><br>
[0011] In a further embodiment, a method for supporting a plurality of services is disclosed. The method includes establishing a dedicated service according to a first capability and reconfiguring the dedicated service according to a second capability. The method further includes establishing a simultaneous second service using at least a portion of the first capability.<br><br>
[0012] In yet a further embodiment, a processor readable medium is disclosed.<br><br>
The processor readable medium includes instructions thereon that may be utilized by one or more processors. The instructions are for determining a modified capability offered to maintain the dedicated service while supporting a second service and for disclosing to a system the modified capability as the available capability for reconfiguring the dedicated service.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br><br>
[0018] Various embodiments are now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details <br><br>
are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of one or more embodiments. It may be evident, however, that such embodiment(s) may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing one or more embodiments.<br><br>
[0019] In the following description, certain terminology is used to describe certain features of one or more embodiments of the present invention. For instance, the terms "user equipment" (UE), "mobile terminal," "mobile device," "wireless device," are interchangeably used to refer to mobile phones, pagers, wireless modems, personal digital assistants, personal information managers, palmtop computers, laptop computers, and/or other mobile communication/computing devices which communicate, at least partially, through a cellular or wireless network.<br><br>
[0020] In third generation wireless mobile communication technology,<br><br>
Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS), also known as 3GSM (third generation Global System for Mobile Communications), is one communication protocol used for communications on a wireless network. One such type of wireless network is a UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN) which typically includes base stations and controllers to form the UMTS wireless network. This wireless communications network, commonly referred to as a 3G (for 3rd Generation) network, can carry many traffic types, from real-time circuit switched traffic to Internet Protocol (IP)-based packet switched. The UTRAN allows connectivity between UEs, such as mobile phones or wireless communication devices, and to devices on other communication networks.<br><br>
[0021] Base stations typically include transmitters and receivers used to communicate directly with the UEs, which may move freely around a network. A Radio Network Controller (RNC) governs communication within the UTRAN by controlling the operation of the base stations on the network. The RNC carries out radio resource management and some of the mobility management functions of data sent to and from the UE.<br><br>
[0022] Various factors determine the capabilities of the UE operating in the<br><br>
UTRAN. Factors such as processing capability of the UE, storage or buffering <br><br>
capability of the UE, enabled functionality of the UE and location of the UE determine the actual capability of the UE. These capabilities, generally known as "UE Capability," are also known as "Classmark Information," in relationship to other revisions or related standards. Therefore, in order to effectuate communication between the UE and the UTRAN, the network must know the capabilities of the mobile device.<br><br>
[0023] In the UTRAN, the RNC can configure UEs operating within the network to operate according to particular communication system parameters. (See 3GPP Technical Specification 25.331.) For example, during initiation or reconfiguration, a Radio Bearer Reconfiguration message may be sent by the RNC to a UE that configures a transmitter and/or receiver in the UE to operate according to parameters (e.g., combination of transmitted and received data blocks, mapping between channels and services, etc.) sent in the Radio Bearer Reconfiguration message.<br><br>
[0024] Accordingly, the various embodiments of the present invention provide a mechanism to allow a UE to modify the UE 's represented or available capabilities for allocating a portion of the UE 's actual capabilities for simultaneously supporting a Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS). During an ongoing dedicated service, the UE is allowed to transmit a UE CAPABILITY INFORMATION message to inform the UTRAN of changes in its capabilities, however, conventional network behavior may be unpredictable. Accordingly, the various embodiments provide a mechanism for allowing the UE to adjust the data rate of an ongoing session of a dedicated service in response to the availability of broadcast services, such as an MBMS.<br><br>
[0025] FIG. 1 shows a diagram of a 3GPP/UMTS network 100 that includes a<br><br>
UTRAN 120 and a core network 150. A UE 110 communicates with a Node B 130 in UTRAN 120. As stated, UE 110 may be stationary or mobile and may also be referred to as a wireless device, a mobile station, a user terminal, a subscriber unit, a station, or some other terminology. UE 110 may be a cellular phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a handheld device, a wireless modem, and so on. The terms "UE," "wireless device," and "user," are used interchangeably herein. Node B 130 is generally a fixed station that <br><br>
communicates with the UEs and may also be referred to as a base station, an access point, or some other terminology of similar functionality.<br><br>
[0026] Node B 130 provides communication coverage for a particular geographic area and supports communication for UEs located within the coverage area. A Radio Network Controller (RNC) 140 couples to Node B 130 and provides coordination and control for the Node B 130. Core network 150 may include various network entities and services, including dedicated services 160 and MBMS 170, that support various functions such as packet routing, user registration, mobility management, etc. UE 110 may communicate with Node B 130 on the downlink and/or uplink at any given moment. The downlink (or forward link) refers to the communication link from the Node B 130 to the UB, and the uplink (or reverse link) refers to the communication link from the UB to the Node B 130.<br><br>
[0027] In UMTS, data is processed as one or more transport channels at a higher layer. The transport channels may carry data for one or more services, e.g., voice, video, packet data, and so on. The transport channels are mapped to physical channels at a physical layer or Layer 1 (Ll). The physical channels are channelized with different channelization codes and are orthogonal to one another in code domain.<br><br>
[0028] Generally, when a UE desires to establish a communication link, the UE sends a channel request to establish a dedicated session. Typically, the channel request includes limited information relating to the UE and the UE is said to be in a connected mode with the UTRAN and in a CELL DCH state characterized by dedicated uplink and downlink channels. The UE then forwards a UE CAPABILITY INFORMATION message including UE capability information to the UTRAN. The UTRAN responds with a UE CAPABILITY ACK message noting the receipt of the UE capability information. The UE transitions into a dedicated physical channel state and exchange of data (e.g., packet data) over the dedicated services link then commences.<br><br>
[0029] A conflict arises when additional services, such as MBMS 170, become available during the dedicated session of the dedicated services. A UE with the capacity to simultaneously support a dedicated service (e.g., packet data service, voice calls, etc.) and an MBMS will necessarily have some limitations on <br><br>
the level of services that can be simultaneously supported. In a typical situation, a UE might be in the CELL DCH state for packet data service, with the UTRAN and hence the "bearer" supporting a downlink data rate of 384 kbps, when an MBMS becomes available to the UE. If the UE can support only a lesser dedicated service downlink, in addition to the processing demands of a MBMS, then conventional prioritization resulted in the UE determining which of the competing services would be supported and which would be either ignored or released.<br><br>
[0030] In many cases, however, it would be possible to degrade or reduce the bit rate of the dedicated service to a level that allows the UE' s processing resources to simultaneously service both a reduced-rate dedicated service and an MBMS without making an exclusive choice. In the example above, if the UE could somehow request the network to reconfigure the UTRAN for a downlink data rate of, for example, only 256 kbps, the UE could maintain the dedicated services and additionally simultaneously receive the MBMS transmission. Alternatively, if the MBMS quality could be diminished and yet remain acceptable, necessary dedicated service bandwidth could be maintained. While such degradation of bandwidth may not always be acceptable, many data services, such as file downloads, are adequately functional at a reduced data rate. Similarly, if the ongoing service is HSDPA, and the UE's category is such that the service is not compatible with MBMS reception (e.g., because of limited buffer memory), the UE might want to artificially lower its indicated category for the duration of the MBMS.<br><br>
[0031] FIGS. 2A-2B illustrate an embodiment for facilitating simultaneous reception of services. Initially, the UE receives 212 system information sent on a broadcast channel. To initiate a call of any type, the UE sends 214 a request to establish a Radio Resource Control (RRC) connection via an RRC Connection Request message. The RRC connection may thereafter be established by an exchange 216 of an RRC Connection Setup message and an exchange 218 of an RRC Connection Setup Complete message between the UTRAN and UE. Steps 212 through 218 are performed for all types of calls.<br><br>
[0032] Once assigned a dedicated channel, the UE informs the UTRAN, and more specifically the packet service (PS) bearer of the capabilities (e.g., <br><br>
processing/buffering capacity) of the UE. Accordingly, the UE sends 220 a USER CAPABILITY INFORMATION message including the UE 's specific capabilities. The UTRAN informs the PS bearer (not individually shown) of the UE' s specific capabilities. The UE 's specific capabilities may include a data rate capability of, for example, 384 kbps. The UTRAN sends 222 a UE CAPABILITY INFORMATION CONFIRM message acknowledging receipt of the UE's capability information. After the UE's capabilities have been exchanged and confirmed, the UE waits to receive 224 a reconfiguration message from the bearer. Accordingly, the UE responds 226 with a radio bearer reconfiguration complete message and the dedicated services commence 228 according to the exchanged capabilities (e.g., packet data rate of, for example, 384 kbps).<br><br>
[0033] As illustrated in FIG. 2B, during the course of engaging in the dedicated services between the UE and the UTRAN, the UE detects 230 an indication of an available MBMS. If the UE is capable of simultaneously sustaining both the MBMS and the dedicated service at the current data rate (i.e., at the data rate agreed during the exchange of the UE's specific capabilities), then the UE simultaneously services both (i) the dedicated service at the data rate of the previously agreed upon UE's capabilities, and (ii) the MBMS. However, if the UE has insufficient processing capability to simultaneously process both (i) the dedicated service according to the previously agreed upon UE's capabilities and (ii) the MBMS, then the UE seeks to reclaim some of the UE's processing obligation from the dedicated service by restating or redisclosing the UE's capability information to include modified capability information.<br><br>
[0034] Specifically, once an MBMS has been detected 230 and when the capabilities of the UE are insufficient at current data rates to simultaneously process both services, the UE informs the UTRAN, and more specifically the PS bearer, that the UE desires to restate or redisclose the UE's capability information at the modified level. Accordingly, the UE sends 232 a USER CAPABILITY INFORMATION message including the UE's specific modified capabilities. By way of example, the UE's specific reduced capabilities may include a data rate capability of, or example, 256 kbps. The UTRAN sends 234 an UE CAPABILITY INFORMATION CONFIRM message acknowledging <br><br>
receipt of the UE 's modified capability information. After the UE's capabilities have been exchanged and confirmed, the UE waits to receive 236 a reconfiguration message from the bearer. Accordingly, the UE responds 238 with a reconfiguration complete message and the dedicated services continues 240 according to the modified capabilities (e.g., packet data rate of, for example, 256 kbps).<br><br>
[0035] If the dedicated session is still active when the MBMS concludes 242, the UE may reassign the available processing capability back to the dedicated service. Accordingly, the UE sends 244 a USER CAPABILITY INFORMATION message including the UE's specific capabilities. By way of example, the UE's specific capabilities may include a data rate capability of 384 kbps. The UTRAN sends 246 a UE CAPABILITY INFORMATION CONFIRM message acknowledging receipt of the UE's capability information. After the UE's capabilities have been exchanged and confirmed, the UE waits to receive 248 a reconfiguration message from the bearer. Accordingly, the UE responds 250 with a reconfiguration complete message and the dedicated services continue 252 according to the again modified capabilities (e.g., packet data rate of, for example, 384 kbps).<br><br>
[0036] FIG. 3 illustrates an embodiment for resolving conflicts in systems of varying ability to facilitate simultaneous receipt of services. While a UE capable of requesting modifications of previously stated capabilities may be configured accordingly, a UTRAN within which the UE may interact may have varying levels of sophistication and capability with regard to intrasession reconfigurations. In the present embodiment, a dedicated service has been commenced 228 as describe above with respect to FIGS. 2A-2B.<br><br>
[0037] Similarly, during the course of engaging in the dedicated services between the UE and the UTRAN, the UE receives 230 an indication of an available MBMS. The UE determines the desirability of simultaneously supporting both the dedicated service and the MBMS, however, the capabilities (e.g., processing, storage, etc.) of the UE are inadequate of simultaneously sustaining both the MBMS and the dedicated service at the current data rate (i.e., at the data rate agreed during the exchange of the UE's specific capabilities). <br><br>
[0038] Accordingly, once an MBMS has been detected 230 and when the capabilities of the UE are insufficient at current data rates to simultaneously process both services, the UE informs the UTRAN, and more specifically the PS bearer, that the UE desires to restate or redisclose the UE' s capability information at a modified level. Accordingly, the UE sends 232 a USER CAPABILITY INFORMATION message including the UE 's specific modified capabilities as describe above. The UTRAN sends 234 a UE CAPABILITY INFORMATION CONFIRM message acknowledging receipt of the UE 's modified capability information. After the UE 's capabilities have been exchanged and confirmed, the UE sets a timer and waits 260 to receive a reconfiguration message from the bearer. However, the UTRAN is incapable during an ongoing dedicated service to act upon the new capability information. Such an inability may result from programming deficiencies within the UTRAN or the specific bearer. Accordingly, the timer times out 260 in the UE since a reconfiguration message was never received from the bearer. The UE thereafter chooses 262 one of the services to support based on an internal prioritization.<br><br>
[0039] FIG. 4 illustrates another embodiment for resolving conflicts in systems of varying ability to facilitate simultaneous receipt of services. While a UE capable of requesting modifications of previously stated capabilities may be configured accordingly, a UTRAN within which the UE may interact may have varying levels of sophistication and capability with regard to intrasession reconfigurations. In the present embodiment, a dedicated service has been commenced 228 as describe above with respect to FIGS. 2A-2B.<br><br>
[0040] Similarly, during the course of engaging in the dedicated services between the UE and the UTRAN, the UE detects 230 an indication of an available MBMS. The UE determines the desirability of simultaneously supporting both the dedicated service and the MBMS, however, the capabilities (e.g., processing, storage, etc.) of the UE are inadequate of simultaneously sustaining both the MBMS and the dedicated service at the current data rate (i.e., at the data rate agreed during the exchange of the UE' s specific capabilities).<br><br>
[0041] Accordingly, once an MBMS has been detected 230 and when the capabilities of the UE are insufficient at current data rates to simultaneously process both services, the UE informs the UTRAN, and more specifically the PS <br><br>
bearer, that the UE desires to restate or redisclose the UE' s capability information at a modified level. In the present embodiment, one or more flags are associated with the USER CAPABILITY INFORMATION message to indicate a requested intrasession modification to the UE capability rather than and original statement of the UE 's capabilities as performed at the establishment of a dedicated session. A UTRAN can differently interpret a request for a modification rather then interpreting the request as an indication of the inability to sustain the current session.<br><br>
[0042] Accordingly, the UE sends 270 a USER CAPABILITY<br><br>
INFORMATION message including the UE' s specific modified capabilities as describe above and a flag noting the modification of an already stated UE capability. The UTRAN sends 272 a UE CAPABILITY INFORMATION CONFIRM message acknowledging receipt of the UE 's modified capability information. After the UE' s capabilities have been exchanged and confirmed, the UE may begin timing according to FIG. 3 to reconfigure according to FIG. 2B, if the reconfiguration message is received or choose 262 based upon prioritization if a reconfiguration message is not received.<br><br>
[0043] In yet another embodiment, the UTRAN may include another flag in the in the UE CAPABILITY INFORMATION CONFIRM message designating whether the modification request was granted 274 or denied 276. If the modification was granted 274, then the UE anticipates a reconfiguration message 236 and processing continues as described above with reference to FIG. 2B. If the modification was denied 276, then the UE chooses 262 one of the services to support based on an internal prioritization as described above with reference to FIG. 3.<br><br>
[0044] FIG. 5 shows a block diagram of an embodiment of UB 110, Node B<br><br>
130, and RNC 140 in FIG. 1. On the uplink, data and signaling to be sent by UE 110 are processed (e.g., formatted, encoded, and interleaved) by an encoder 322 and further processed (e.g., modulated, channelized, and scrambled) by a modulator (Mod) 324 to generate output chips. A transmitter (TMTR) 332 then conditions (e.g., converts to analog, filters, amplifies, and frequency upconverts) the output chips and generates an uplink signal, which is transmitted via an antenna 334. On the downlink, antenna 334 receives a downlink signal <br><br>
transmitted by Node B 130. A receiver (RCVR) 336 conditions (e.g., filters, amplifies, frequency downconverts, and digitizes) the received signal from antenna 334 and provides samples. A demodulator (Demod) 326 processes (e.g., descrambles, channelizes, and demodulates) the samples and provides symbol estimates. A decoder 328 further processes (e.g., deinterleaves and decodes) the symbol estimates and provides decoded data. Encoder 322, modulator 324, demodulator 326, and decoder 328 may be implemented by a modem processor 320. These units perform processing in accordance with the radio technology (e. g., W- CDMA or cdma2000) used by the network.<br><br>
[0045] A controller/processor 340 directs the operation of various units at UE<br><br>
110. Controller/processor 340 may perform the processes or steps described in FIGS. 2A-4 and/or other processes for the techniques described herein. A memory 342 stores program codes and data for UE 1 10, e.g., UE capabilities, data rates, timers for servicing dedicated and MBMSs.<br><br>
[0046] FIG. 5 also shows an embodiment of Node B 130 and RNC 140. Node B<br><br>
130 includes a controller/processor 350 that performs various functions for communication with UE 110, a memory 352 that stores program codes and data for Node B 130, and a transceiver 354 that supports radio communication with UE 110. Controller/processor 350 may perform the processes or steps described in FIGS. 2A-4 and/or other processes for the techniques described herein.
