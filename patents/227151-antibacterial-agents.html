This invention relates to the use of N-formyl hydroxylamine derivatives as antibacterial agents, to a novel class of such compounds, and to pharmaceutical and veterinary compositions comprising such compounds.<br>
Background to the Invention<br>
In general, bacterial pathogens are classified as either Gram-positive or Gram-negative. Many antibacterial agents (including antibiotics) are specific against one or other Gram-class of pathogens. Antibacterial agents effective against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens are therefore generally regarded as having broad spectrum activity.<br>
Many classes of antibacterial agents are known, including the penicillins and cephalosporins, tetracyclines, sulfonamides, monobactams, fluoroquinolones and quinolones, aminoglycosides, glycopeptides, macrolides, polymyxins, lincosamides, trimethoprim and chloramphenicol. The fundamental mechanisms of action of these antibacterial classes vary.<br>
Bacterial resistance to many known antibacterials is a growing problem. Accordingly there is a continuing need in the art for alternative antibacterial agents, especially those which have mechanisms of action fundamentally different from the known classes.<br>
Brief Description of the Invention<br>
This invention is based on the finding that certain N-formyl hydroxylamine derivatives have antibacterial activity, and makes available a new class of antibacterial agents. The inventors have found that the compounds with which this invention is concerned are antibacterial with respect to a range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. Furthermore, there is evidence that some compounds are antibacterial with respect to bacteria which are resistant to commonly used<br><br>
antibiotics such as vancomycin and the p-lactam antibiotics, for example methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.<br>
Although it may be of interest to establish the mechanism of action of the compounds with which the invention is concerned, it is their ability to inhibit bacterial growth which makes them useful. However, it is presently believed that their antibacterial activity is due, at least in part, to intracellular inhibition of bacterial polypeptide deformylase (PDF) enzyme.<br>
Bacterial polypeptide deformylases (PDF) (EC 3.5.1.31), are a conserved family of metalloenzymes (Reviewed: Meinnel T, Lazennec C, Villoing S, Blanquet S, 1997, Journal of Molecular Biology 267, 749-761) which are essential for bacterial viability, their function being to remove the formyl group from the N-terminal methionine residue of ribosome-synthesised proteins in eubacteria.   Maze! et al. (EMBO J. 13(4):914-923, 1994) have recently cloned and characterised an E. coliPDF. As PDF is essential to the growth of bacteria and there is no eukaryotic counterpart to PDF, Mazel etal. (ibid), Rajagopalan et al. (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 119:12418-12419, 1997) and Becker et al., (J. Biol Chem. 273(19):11413-11416, 1998) have each proposed that PDF is an excellent anti-bacterial target.<br>
Certain N-formyl hydroxylamine derivatives have previously been claimed in the patent publications listed below, although very few examples of such compounds have been specifically made and described:<br>
EP-B-0236872	(Roche)<br>
WO 92/09563	(Glycomed)<br>
WO 92/04735	(Syntex)<br>
WO 95/19965	(Glycomed)<br>
WO 95/22966	(Sanofi Winthrop)<br>
WO 95/33709	(Roche)<br>
WO 96/23791	(Syntex)<br><br>
WO 96/16027	(Syntex/Agouron)<br>
WO 97/03783	(British Biotech)<br>
WO 97/18207	(DuPont Merck)<br>
WO 98/38179	(GlaxoWellcome)<br>
WO 98/47863	(Labs Jaques Logeais)<br>
The pharmaceutical utility ascribed to the N-formyl hydroxylamine derivatives in those publications is the ability to inhibit matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and in some cases release of tumour necrosis factor (TNF), and hence the treatment of diseases or conditions mediated by those enzymes, such as cancer and rheumatoid arthritis. That prior art does not disclose or imply that N-formyl hydroxylamine derivatives have antibacterial activity.<br>
In addition to these, US-A-4,738,803 (Roques et al.) also discloses N-formyl hydroxylamine derivatives, however, these compounds are disclosed as enkephalinase inhibitors and are proposed for use as antidepressants and hypotensive agents. Also, WO 97/38705 (Bristol-Myers Squibb) discloses certain N-formyl hydroxylamine derivatives as enkephalinase and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. This prior art does not disclose or imply that N-formyl hydroxylamine derivatives have antibacterial activity either.<br>

According to the first aspect of the present invention there is provided the use of a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutical^ or veterinarily acceptable salt thereof in the preparation of an antibacterial composition:<br><br><br>
wherein:<br>
R, represents hydrogen, or C,-C6 alkyl or C^Cg alkyl substituted by one or more<br>
halogen atoms;<br>
R2 represents a group R10-(X)n-(ALK)m- wherein<br>
R10 represents hydrogen, or a C,-C6 alkyl, C2-CB alkenyl, C2-C6 alkynyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, or heterocyclyl group, any of which may be unsubstituted or substituted by (CrCB)alkyl, (C^CeJalkoxy, hydroxy, mercapto, (C,-C6)alkylthio, amino, halo (including fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo), trifluoromethyl, cyano, nitro, -COOH, -CONH3,-COORA, -NHCORA, -CONHRA, -NHRA, -NRARB, or-CONRARB wherein RA and RB are independently a (CrC6)alkyl group, and<br>
ALK represents a straight or branched divalent C,-C6 alkylene, C2-C6 alkenylene, or C2-Ce alkynylene radical, and may be interrupted by one or more non-adjacent -NH-, -O- or -S- linkages,<br>

m and n are independently 0 or 1; and<br>
A represents (i) a group of formula (IA), (IB), (IC) or (ID)<br><br>

R5 and R6, independently represent hydrogen, or optionally substituted C.,-C8 alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, aryl(CrC6 alkyl), heterocyclic, or heterocyclic^ ,-Cg alkyl), or R5 and Rg when taken together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached form an optionally substituted saturated heterocyclic ring of 3 to 8 atoms which ring is optionally fused to a carbocyclic or second heterocyclic ring,and<br>

Thus, compounds which are highly active as inhibitors of PDF in vitro and which penetrate bacterial cells are preferred for use in accordance with the invention. It is to be expected that the antibacterial potency of compounds which are potent inhibitors of the PDF enzyme in vitro, but are poorly cell penetrant, may be improved by their use in the form of a prodrug, ie a structurally modified analogue which is converted to the parent molecule of formula<br><br>
(I), for example by enzymic action, after it has passed through the bacterial cell wall.<br>

There are several actual or potential chiral centres in the compounds according to the invention because of the presence of asymmetric carbon atoms. The presence of several asymmetric carbon atoms gives rise to a number of diastereoisomers with R or S stereochemistry at each chiral centre.

Method I<br>
A synthetic route to the title compound is outlined in Scheme 2 and is described in detail below.<br><br><br><br>
Step A: 2RS-Formyl-heptanoic acid ethyl ester<br>
Sodium metal (4.38 g, 0.191 mmol) was cut into small pieces and placed in a two-neck oven-dried round bottom flask under a blanket of argon. Anhydrous diethyl ether (100 ml) was added and the suspension was stirred and cooled to 0°C. The flask was fitted with a reflux condenser before dropwise addition of ethanol (1.03 ml, 17.3 mmol). A mixture of ethyl formate (15.41 g, 0.208 mmol) and ethyl caproate (25 g, 0.173 mmol) was added dropwise via a dropping funnel over a period of about 20 minutes. The resulting orange suspension (sodium metal still visible) was allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred overnight. The resulting thick orange suspension (no sodium metal visible) was cooled to 0 °C and diluted with ice-cold water (100 ml). The mixture was transferred to a separating funnel and the aqueous phase was removed, washed with diethyl ether, cooled to 0 °C and acidified with 1 M hydrochloric acid (200 ml). The emulsion was extracted with ethyl acetate and the organic layer was separated, washed with brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to give a yellow oil containing primarily the title compound (11.09 g), which was used without further purification in Step B.<br>
Step B: 2RS-(Benzyloxyimino-methyl)-heptanoic acid ethyl ester<br>
The crude Claisen product from Step A (11.0 g, 63.9 mmol) was dissolved in ethanol (100 ml) and water (10 ml) and cooled to 0°C during the addition of sodium acetate (6.2 g, 76.6 mmol) and O-benzyl hydroxylamine hydrochloride (12.23 g, 76.6 mmol). The mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred overnight. The resulting suspension was filtered and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residual yellow paste was partitioned between ethyl acetate and water. The organic layer was washed with 1 M hydrochloric acid and brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered and evaporated to a yellow oil. The desired product was obtained by flash chromatography (silica gel, gradient elution with 10% to 25% ethyl acetate in hexane. Yield 9.19 g (52%). 'H-NMR: 5 (CDCI3,<br><br>
mixture of syn- and antf-isomers), 7.46 (0.6H, d, J = 8.0 Hz), 7.38-7.28 (5H, m), 6.79 (0.4H, d, J = 7.1 Hz), 5.11 (0.8H, s), 5.08 (1.2H, s), 4.16 (1.2H, q, J = 7.0 Hz), 4.13 (0.6H, q, J = 7.0 Hz), 3.91 (0.4H, q, J = 7.2 Hz), 3.21 (0.6H, td, J = 8.0 and 6.1Hz), 1.90-1.48 (2H, m), 1.37-1.20 (7H, m), 0.87 (3H, t, J = 7.0 Hz).<br>
Step C: 2RS-(Benzyloxyimino-methyl)-heptanoic acid<br>
2RS-(Benzyloxyimino-methyl)-heptanoic acid ethyl ester (7.0 g, 25.24 mmol) was dissolved in methanol (125 ml) and the solution was cooled to 0 °C. 1 M Sodium hydroxide {26 ml, 26 mmol) was added in portions over 2 minutes to give a pale yellow emulsion. Additional methanol was added until a clear solution was obtained. The solution was allowed to stir for 90 minutes at 0°C then for 5 hours at room temperature whereupon TLC analysis suggested that all of the starting material had been consumed. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the residue was partitioned between water and ethyl acetate. The aqueous layer was cooled to 0 °C and acidified with 1 M hydrochloric acid. The emulsion thus formed was extracted twice with ethyl acetate. The combined organic extracts were washed with brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to provide the title compound as a yellow oil (5.15 g, 82%) which was used without further purification in Step D. 1H-NMR: 5 (CDCI3, mixture of syn- and anti- isomers), 8.00 (1H, brs), 7.46 (0.6H, d, J = 7.9 Hz), 7.36-7.24 (5H, m), 6.80 (0.4H, d, J = 7.0 Hz), 5.13 (0.8H, s), 5.09 (1.2H, s), 3.94 (0.4H, q, J = 7.1 Hz), 3.27 (0.6H, td, J = 6.4 and 8.0 Hz), 1.94-1.58

2-{Benzyloxyimino-methyl)-heptanoic acid (5.16 g, 20.7 mmol), terf-leucine N,N-dimethylamide (3.60g, 22.77mmol) and EDC (4.76g, 24.84 mmol) were stirred together in DMF (75 ml) and cooled to 0 °C.  HOAt (250 mg, cat.) was added and<br><br>
the bright yellow mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred overnight. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the residual oil was partitioned between ethyl acetate and 1M hydrochloric acid. The organic layer was washed with brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure. The title compound was obtained as a colourless oil by flash chromatography (silica gel, gradient elution with 33% to 66% ethyl acetate in hexane). Yield 6.84 g (85%).   'H-NMR: 5 (CDCI3, mixture of syn- and anti- isomers), 7.45 (0.6H, 2d), 7.40-7.26 (5H, m), 6.72 (0.4H, 2d), 6.58 (1H, m), 5.20-4.69 (3H, m), 3.82 (0.4H, m), 3.16-3.10 (3H, m), 3.05 (0.6H, m), 2.99-2.92 (3H, m), 1.90-1.54 (2H, m), 1.39-1.17 (4H, m), 0.97 (2.7H, s), 0.96 (1.8H, s), 0.94 (2.7H, s), 0.92 (1.8H, s) and 0.92-0.82 (3H, m).<br>

To a solution of 2RS-(benzyloxyimino-methyl)-heptanoic acid (1S-dimethyl-carbamoyl-2,2-dimethyl-propyl) amide (5.0g, 12.84 mmol) in acetic acid (40 ml) was added sodium cyanoborohydride (2.02 g, 32.0 mmol) in one portion. Over the course of 1 hour the reagent dissoved slowly with mild effervesence to give a colourless solution, which was left to stir overnight. The solvent was removed by evaporation under reduced pressure and azeotroping with toluene. The remaining oil was partitioned between diethyl ether and 1 M sodium carbonate (CARE!-some gas evolved). The organic layer was washed with brine (70 ml), washed with brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure. The two diastereoisomers of title compound were purified and separated by flash chromatography (silica gel, gradient elution with 50% to 100% ethyl acetate in hexane).<br>

Method ll<br>
An alternative asymmetric synthetic route to the compound of Example 13 is outlined in Scheme 3 and is described in detail below.<br><br><br><br>
Step A: 2-Butyl acrylic acid<br>
To a solution of n-butylmaIonic acid (17.2 g, 107 mmol) in ethanol (200 ml) was added piperidine (12.76 ml, 129 mmol) and 37% aq. formaldehyde (40.3 ml, 538 mmol). The solution was heated to 80 °C during which time a precipitate appeared and then gradually redissolved over 1 hour. The reaction mixture was stirred at 80 °C overnight then cooled to room temperature. The solvents were removed under reduced pressure and the residue was dissolved in ethyl acetate (200 ml), washed successively with 1 M hydrochloric acid and brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated to give the title compound as a clear oil (13.37 g, 97%). 'H-NMR; 5 (CDCI3), 6.29 (1H, s), 5.65 (1H, s), 2.34-2.28 (2H, m), 1.54-1.26 (4H, m) and 0.94 (3H, t, J=7.1 Hz).<br>
Step B:4S-Benzyl-3-(2-butyl-acryloyl)-515-dimethyl-oxazolidin-2-one<br>
2-Butyl acrylic acid (21.5 g, 168 mmol) was dissolved in dry THF (500 ml) and cooled to -78 °C under a blanket of argon. Triethylamine (30 ml, 218 mmol) and pivaloyl chloride (21ml, 168mmol) were added at such a rate that the temperature remained below -60 °C. The mixture was stirred at -78 °C for 30 minutes, wanned to room temperature for 2 hours and finally cooled back to -78 °C.<br>
In a separate flask, 4S-benzyl-5,5-dimethyl-oxazolidin-2-one was dissoved in dry THF (500ml) and cooled to -78 °C under a blanket of argon. n-Butyllithium (2.4 M solution in hexanes, 83 ml, 200 mmol) was added slowly and the mixture was stirred for 30 minutes at room temperature. The resulting anion was tranferred via a cannula into the original reaction vessel. The mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and was stirred overnight at room temperature. The reaction was quenched with 1 M potassium hydrogen carbonate (200 ml) and the solvents were removed under reduced pressure. The residue was partitioned between ethyl acetate and water. The organic layer was washed with brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulphate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure to give an<br><br>
orange oil. TLC analysis revealed the presence of unreacted chiral auxiliary in addition to the required product A portion of the material (30 g) was dissolved in dichloromethane and flushed though a silica pad to give pure title compound as a yellow oil (25.3 g). 1H-NMR;5 (CDCI3), 7.31-7.19 (5H, m), 5.41 (2H,s), 4.51 (1H,dd, J=9.7, 4.2 Hz), 3.32 (1H, dd, J=14.2, 4.2 Hz), 2.82 (1H, dd, J=14.2, 9.7 Hz), 2.40-2.34 (2H, m), 1.48-1.32 (4H, m), 1.43 (3H,s), 1.27 (3H, s) and 0.91 (3H, t, J=7.1 Hz).

The mixture was dissolved in ethyl acetate and the solution was washed with 1 M hydrochloric acid, 1 M sodium carbonate and brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to a pale yellow oil (25.3 g) which was shown by NMR and HPLC analysis to contain 4S-Benzyl-3-[2-(benzyloxyamino-methyl)-hexanoyl]-5,5-dimethyl-oxazolidin-2-one (ca. 82% d.e.) along with a trace of starting material.

The compounds of Examples 14 to 27 were prepared by analogy with Example 13, Method I, substituting the appropriate ester for ethyl caproate in Step A. Where both diastereoisomers were prepared, diastereoisomer A is the faster eluting and usually the more potent against PDF in vitro. In some cases only the faster running diastereoisomer (Step E) was taken through to the final product.<br>

A synthetic route to the title compound is outlined in Scheme 4 and is described in<br>
detail below.<br><br><br><br>
Step A: 2-Ethylsulfanylmethyl-acrylic acid<br>
A mixture of malonic acid (5.2 g, 50 mmol), paraformaldehyde (3.3 g, 110mmol), dicyclohexylamine, 9.95 ml, 50 mmol) and ethanethiol 4.06 ml, 55 mmol) in dioxane (120 ml) was heated at 70 °C for 2 hours. The solvents were removed under reduced pressure, the residue was redissolved in ethyl acetate and the solution was extracted with saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate (4x20 ml). The combined aqueous layers were washed with ethyl acetate (20 ml) then acidified with 1 M hydrochloric acid. The resulting suspension was extracted into dichloromethane and the solution was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered and evaporated to provide the title compound as a white solid (3.76 g, 52%). 1H-NMR; 5 (CDCI3), 9.89 (1H, br s), 6.35 (1H, s), 5.77 (1H, s), 3.39 (2H, s), 2.49 (2H, dd, J=7.4, 14.5 Hz) and 1.25 (3H, t, J=5.2 Hz).<br>
Step B:4S-Benzyl-3-(2-ethylsulfanylmethyl-acryloyl)-5,5-dimethyl-oxazolidin-2-one<br>
2-Ethylsulfanylmethyl-acrylic acid (3.76g, 25.8mmol) was dissolved in dry THF (75 ml) and cooled to -78 °C under a blanket of argon. Triethylamine (4.6 ml, 33.5 mmol) and pivaloyl chloride (3.17 ml, 25.8 mmol) were added at such a rate that the temperature remained below -60 °C. The mixture was stirred at -78 °C for 30 minutes, warmed to room temperature for 2 hours and finally cooled back to -78 °C.<br>
In a separate flask, 4S-benzyl-5,5-dimethyl-oxazolidin-2-one was dissoved in dry THF (75 ml) and cooled to -78 °C under a blanket of argon. n-Butyllithium (2.4M solution in hexanes, 12.9 ml, 30.9 mmol) was added slowly and the mixture was stirred for 30 minutes at room temperature. The resulting anion was tranferred via a cannula into the original reaction vessel. The mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred overnight at room temperature. The reaction was quenched with saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate (20ml) and the solvents were removed under reduced pressure. The residue was partitioned between ethyl acetate and water. The organic layer was washed successively with saturated sodium hydrogen<br><br>
carbonate, 1 M hydrochloric acid and brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by flash chromatography (silica gel, 20% ethyl acetate in hexane) to provide the title compound as a yellow oil (6.5 g, 76%). 1H-NMR; 6 (CDCI3), 7.29 (5H, m), 5.58 (1H, s), 5.49 (1H, s), 4.54 (1H, dd, J=3.9, 9.7 Hz), 3.52 (2H, dd, J=15.8, 3.1 Hz), 3.38 (1H, dd, J=3.9, 14.5 Hz), 2.84 (1H, dd, J=4.6, 14.3 Hz), 2.52 (2H, dd, J=7.2, 14.6 Hz), 1.42 (3H, s), 1.29 (3H, s) and 1.22 (3H, t, J=7.5 Hz). LRMS: +ve ion 356 (M+Na), 334 (M+H).<br>
StepC:4S-Benzyl-3-[2R-terf-butoxyamino-methyl)-3-ethylsulfanylmethyl-propionyl]-5,5-dimethyl-oxazolidin-2-one<br>
4S-Benzyl-3-{2-ethylsulfanylmethyl-acryloyl)-5,5-dimethyl-oxazolidin-2-one (2.1 g, 6.3 mmol) was dissolved in ethanol (10 ml) and O-terf-butyl-hydroxylamine hydrochloride (0.95 g, 7.56 mmol) was added, followed by triethylamine (1.1 ml, 7.87 mmol). The mixture was stirred at 30 °C overnight. The solvents were removed under reduced pressure and the residue was dissolved in ethyl acetate. The organic solution was washed succesively with 1 M hydrochloric acid, saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate and brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulphate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to provide the title compound as a pale yellow oil (2.42 g, 91%; single diastereoisomer by HPLC). 1H-NMR; 5 (CDCI3), 7.30 (5H, m), 5.09 (1H, br s), 4.54 (1H, dd, J=3.5, 9.9 Hz), 4.33 (1H, m), 3.19 (2H, m), 3.08 (1H, dd, J=5.4, 11.8 Hz), 2.80 (3H, m), 2.56 (2H, dd, j=7.4, 14.7 Hz), 1.41 (3H, s), 1.36 (3H,s), 1.23 (3H,t,J=7.3 Hz) and 1.13 (9H,s). LRMS: +ve ion 423 (M+H).<br>
Step D: 2R-terf-butoxyamino-methyl)-3-ethylsulfanylmethyl-propionic acid<br>

ml) was added. The mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature then stirred for 5 hours. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the residue was partitioned between water and ethyl acetate. The aqueous layer was removed and the ethyl acetate layer was washed successively with water and saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate. The combined aqueous layers were washed with ethyl acetate (20 ml) before acidifying with 1 M hydrochloric acid.

as described in detail below:<br><br><br><br>
Step A; 4-Benzyl-3-hexanoyl-oxazolidin-2-one<br>
4S-Benzyl-oxazolidin-2-one (14.5 g, 81.7 mmol) was dissolved in dry THF (75 ml) under an argon atmosphere. The solution was cooled in an ice bath before slow addition of n-butyllithium (1.6 M in hexanes, 56 ml, 89.2 mmol). The lithium salt crystallised from the solution as a solid mass and was allowed to warm to room temperature overnight. The resulting orange suspension was cooled again in an ice bath during the addition of a cold solution of hexanoyl chloride (10.4 ml, 74.3 mmol) in dry THF (50 ml). The mixture was left to warm to room temperature and was then stirred for 3 hours. The reaction was quenched with 1M sodium carbonate solution (5 ml) and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The residue was partitioned between 1 M sodium carbonate (100 ml) and ethyl acetate (150 ml). The organic layer was removed and the aqueous layer was extracted with more ethyl acetate. The combined organic layers were washed successively with water, 1 M sodium carbonate and brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulphate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated to leave an orange oil. Purification by flash chromatography afforded the title compound as a yellow oil (10.21 g, 50%). 1H-NMR; 5 (CDCI3), 7.38-7.24 (3H, m), 7.24-7.16 (2H, m), 4.68 (1H, m), 4.24-4.12 (2H, m), 3.30 (1H, dd, J=13.4, 3.2 Hz), 3.02-2.86 (2H, m), 2.77 (1H, dd, J=13.4, 9.6 Hz), 1.77-1.63 (2H, m), 1.44-1.30 (4H, m) and 0.92 (3H, br t, J=6.9 Hz).<br>

N-[2R-(4S-Benzyl-2-oxo-oxazolidine-3-carbonyl)-1 R (or S)-methyl-hexyl]-N-benzyloxy- formamide (1.50 g, 3.31 mmol) was dissolved in THF (25 ml) and water (5 ml) and the solution was cooled in an ice-water bath. Hydrogen peroxide<br><br>
solution (27% w/w), 13.26 mmol) was added followed immediately by lithium hydroxide (167 mg, 3.98 mmol). The reaction was allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred for a further 3 hours. The solution was cooled again before addition of sodium nitrite (0.92 g, 13.3 mmol). After 10 minutes, most of the solvent was removed under reduced pressure to leave a white paste which was partitioned between ethyl acetate (25 ml) and 1M sodium carbonate (30 ml). The organic layer was washed with more sodium carbonate solution and the combined aqueous extracts were washed with ethyl acetate. The aqueous layer was cooled and acidified with 1 M hydrochloric acid and extracted twice with ethyl acetate. The combined organic layers were washed with brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulphate, filtered and evaporated to provide the title compound as a green oil (839 mg, 86%). 1H-NMR; 5 (CDCI3, mixture of a-diastereoisomers and rotamers), 8.40-7.64 (2H, br m), 7.48-7.27 (5H, m), 5.23-4.80 (2H, m), 4.16 (1H, br m), 2.79 (1H, m), 1.67-1.47 (2H, m), 1.47-1.18 (7H, m) and 0.95-0.82 (3H, m).<br>
