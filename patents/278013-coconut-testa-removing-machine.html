				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>A Coconut Testa Removing Machine has been developed to remove testa from coconut endosperm (kernel). Testa removing is an important operation during the process of making many high value coconut products like desiccated coconut, virgin coconut oil etc. The machine consists of a circular wheel covered with an emery cloth or water paper This friction wheel is rotated using an electric motor. Coconut kernel is pressed to the surface of the rotating friction wheel either by hand or using a fork. Removed testa is collected at the bottom. The emery cloth/ water paper needs to be replaced periodically when the surface gets smoothened. One person can remove testa of about 75 coconuts per hour. Fabrication cost of the machine is Rs.25,000/-</td>

				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to design and development of a machine to remove coconut testa, the brown skin covering the outer surface of coconut kernel. Prior art<br>
India accounts for 22.34 per cent of the world's coconut production and is one of the major players in the world's coconut trade. Currently the crop is grown in 1.91 million ha with an annual production of nearly 13,000 million nuts. However, price of coconut in the Country is dependent on the prevailing price of coconut oil which is characterized by recurring violent fluctuations. The volatile price situation often ends in the negligence of the coconut gardens, leading to attack of pests and diseases and low productivity. Of the range of ways, product diversification and value addition play a crucial role in the stabilization of the coconut price. Consumer demands for varied high value coconut products are tremendously increasing. However, consequent to the liberalization of the Indian economy, the domestic industry has not been catching up commensuration with the growth of other world leaders like Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand and Sri Lanka. Viable processing technologies need to be made available in the State for manufacture of varied products based on coconut. Many of such high value products produced from coconut kernel viz., desiccated coconut, virgin coconut oil etc. requires removal of the brown portion covering the endosperm, testa.<br>
Desiccated Coconut Powder is obtained by drying coconut gratings after the removal of brown testa. It finds extensive use in confectioneries, puddings and many other food preparations as a substitute to raw grated coconut. In India the product is manufactured by small scale units scattered in Karnataka, Tamil Nadir, Karalla and Andhra Pradesh. A study conducted by the Coconut Development Board has revealed that a growing consumer demand for desiccated coconut powder could be developed in the country by resorting to organized market promotion activities for the popularisation of the product in consumer packs for household uses. The survey has also shown that desiccated coconut powder in consumer packs is acceptable even in non-coconut producing states. From the survey it was revealed that a sizeable section of the middle class and upper class families residing in cities and towns in Kerala would prefer desiccated coconut powder, if readily available, to raw nuts. Given the already growing international demand for virgin oil, and consequently its tremendous export potential, virgin coconut oil is expected to revitalize the ailing coconut industry in India and give it an added shine, in the years to come.<br>
 <br>
4. Description<br>
Technical Specifications<br>
The machine consists of a circular wheel of 12.5 cm width and 14 cm diameter. An emery cloth or water paper is pasted to the surface of the wheel. This friction wheel is connected to a 1 0 hp electric motor through a V belt. A circular cover with an opening at one side and a guide at the bottom is provided surrounding the friction wheel. The wheel coupled with the electric motor is fitted to a steel frame and is fixed to the floor. Engineering drawing of the coconut testa removing machine and its parts with all technical details is given in Annexure-lII<br>
Operation<br>
Coconut endosperm, the kernel obtained after the removal of husk and shell, is pressed to the surface of the friction wheel. Bigger sized coconut kernels can be pressed to the friction wheel by hand using goose. A fork may be used for smaller kernel pieces. When the wheel rotates the kernel pieces are pressed towards its surface and due to the friction the testa gets removed. Removed testa is collected at the bottom. The water paper/ emery cloth needs to be replaced periodically.<br>
Commercial Value<br>
Many of high value coconut products like desiccated coconut, virgin coconut oil etc. requires removal of testa. At present testa is being removed manually which is a cumbersome and time consuming process. Moreover a sizable amount of coconut meat also would be lost along with the removed testa. The coconut testa removing machine will definitely improve the efficiency and capacity of any production units that requires the removal of testa.<br>
