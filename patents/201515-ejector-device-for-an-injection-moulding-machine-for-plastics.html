				<td>Ejector device for an injection-molding machine for plastics<br>
Description<br>
The invention relates to an ejector device for an injection-moulding machine for plastics with at least one ejector bolt, which can be moved by an actuator towards the mould and away from it through the center of a movable platen.<br>
EP 0 585 671 Al discloses an ejector for moulds in injection-moulding machines in which there is mounted an electric motor which is provided on a platen and is in constant adjusting connection via a gear mechanism with a rotationally .drivable threaded spindle, which is connected to an ejector pin.<br>
EP 0 890 426 A2 discloses a device in which a servo motor is connected via an endless belt to a be11screw, which is in operative connection with an ejector bolt.<br>
The ejector units known from the aforementioned documents suffer not only from the disadvantage of a complicated construction but also from appreciable wear.<br>
The object of the invention is to provide an ejector device for an injection-moulding machine which, while being of a simple construction and economical in its energy consumption, requires little maintenance, is reliable and takes up only a small free space in the region of the drive of the movable platen.<br>
The invention achieves this object by the features of Claim 1. The remaining claims comprise advantageous developments of the invention.<br>
According to the invention, a linear motor which is connected via bar-shaped power transmission elements to the ejector bolt is provided outside the central axis of the injection-moulding machine. The linear motor is fastened on the movable platen and is<br><br>
arranged parallel or at right angles to the principal axis of the latter.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, a two-armed lever is used, fastened at one end in an angularly movable manner on a bracket of the movable platen and connected at the other end via a tension butt strap to the linear motor- Provided approximately centrally is a compression butt strap, which is in operative connection with the ejector bolt.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, a two-armed lever is provided, one end of which is connected to the ejector bolt, the other end of which is in connection with the linear motor via a compression butt strap and which is in connection with the movable platen  approximately  centrally  via  a  tension  butt<br>
strap-<br>
The two-armed lever is designed in such a way that the lever ratios can be set and, in one embodiment, the lever has various retaining elements, while in a further embodiment the lever is telescopically designed, in order to be able to set the lever ratios of the lever part a, which is inclined towards the linear motor, and the lever part b, which is inclined towards the ejector bolt.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, a gear mechanism formed by a two-armed lever and a one-armed lever is provided, permitting a linear guidance of the ejector bolt over an adequate range. This embodiment makes it possible to dispense with the use of a bearing of the ejector bolt. Where bearings are used, sliding bearings, in particular sintered bearings, are provided.<br>
Used as the linear motors are electric motors which have ball screws or planetary screws. It is also proposed to use as the linear motors reluctance motors in which the inductor comb is in connection either with the movable platen or via a compression or tension butt strap with the two-armed lever.<br><br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, a rigid lever is used, driven by a linear motor arranged parallel to the principal axis.<br>
An example of the invention is represented in the attached drawing, in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows an ejector device with a two-armed lever, which centrally drives the ejector bolt.<br>
Figure 2 shows an  actor device with a two-armed lever in which the ejector bolt is arranged at the end.<br>
Figure 3 shows an ejector device in which the levers form a gear mechanism.<br>
Figure 4 shows an ejector device in which the linear motor is arranged perpendicularly in relation to the principal axis.<br>
Figure 5 shows an ejector device with a rigid lever.<br>
All the figures show a fixed platen 11 and a movable platen 12 of an injection-moulding machine 10. Fastened in each case on the movable platen 12 is a linear motor 21, which is in operative connection via lever-shaped power transmission elements 30 with an ejector bolt 41, which can be guided centrally through the movable platen 12.<br>
In Figure 1, the ejector bolt 41 is fastened on an ejector plate 44, which has bearings 42 and 43 which correspond with guide bolts 16, 17 attached to the movable platen 12.<br>
The ejector plate 44 is connected via a compression butt strap 33 to a two-armed lever 31. The two-armed lever 31 is fastened at one end in an angularly movable manner to a bracket 13 and connected at its other end via a tension butt strap 32 to the linear motor 21- The linear motor 21 is designed as a reluctance motor 23, the inductor comb 24 of which is arranged on the head of the platen 12 parallel to the principal axis I.<br>
The ratios of the lever part a with respect to the lever part b of the two-armed lever 31 can be set<br><br>
via retaining elements 34 and 35, respectively, in interaction with the bracket 13 and 14, respectively. In Figure 2, two ejector bolts 41 are provided on the ejector plate 44. The ejector plate 44 is in this case fastened on the retaining bar 45, which is guided through a bearing 15 which is fastened on the movable platen 12.<br>
The end of the retaining bar 45 is fastened in an angularly movable manner to one end of the two-armed lever 31.<br>
The two-armed lever is held approximately centrally by means of a tension butt strap 32 on brackets 13 or 14, which are fastened on the movable platen 12.<br>
Provided at the other end of the two-armed lever 31 is a compression butt strap 33, which is in operative connection with a spindle 22 of the linear motor 21 provided here.<br>
In Figure 3, the retaining bar 45, which is connected to the ejector plate 44 on which the ejector bolt 41 is located, is connected both to a one-armed lever 37 and to a two-armed lever 31. The one-armed lever 37 is in this case connected at the other end to a bracket 14, and the two-armed lever 31 is connected approximately centrally via a bracket 13 to the movable platen. The points of articulation and the lever ratios are matched with one another in such a way that the ejector bolt 41 is guided on the central axis I for an adequately great distance.<br>
The two-armed lever 31 is designed as a telescope, so that the ratios of the lever arms a and b can be set in a steeples manner as desired.<br>
One end of the two-armed lever 31 is connected via a compression butt strap 33 to the linear motor 21, which is designed as a reluctance motor 23. The inductor comb 24 has adjusting elements 25, which allow an adjustability of the movement axis II in relation to the central axis I.<br><br>
In Figure 4, the movement axis III is provided perpendicularly in relation to the central axis I. The linear motor 21 used is in this case held in an angularly movable manner on a bracket 13, 14.<br>
The two-armed lever 31 has an angular shape and is connected in an angularly movable manner to the movable platen 12 approximately centrally on a bracket 13.<br>
Provided at the other end of the two-armed lever 31 is a compression butt strap 33, which is connected to the retaining bar 45, which is connected to the ejector plate 44 and the ejector bolt 41 fastened on the latter.<br>
The retaining bar 45 is mounted in a bearing 15, which is in connection with the movable platen 12.<br>
Figure 5 has an ejector bolt 41, which is connected to an ejector plate 44 and is in operative connection with the linear motor 21 via a rigid arm 39. One end of the rigid arm 39 forms the inductor comb 24 of the reluctance motor 23.<br>
The ejector plate 44, connected to the rigid arm 39, is mounted by the bearings 42 and 43 on guide bolts 16 and 17, which are fastened on a movable platen 12.<br><br>
