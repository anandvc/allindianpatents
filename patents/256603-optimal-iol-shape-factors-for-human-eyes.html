Related Application<br>
The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application<br>
Serial No. 60/668,520 entitled "Intraocular Lens," filed on April 5, 2005, which is herein<br>
incorporated by reference.<br>
A U.S. patent application entitled, 'Intraocular Lens," assigned to the assignee of<br>
the present application, and filed concurrently herewith, is herein also incorporated hy<br>
reference.<br>
Background<br>
The present invention relates generally to ophthalmic lenses, and more<br>
particularly, to intraocular lenses (lOLs) having optimal shape factors.<br>
Intraocular lenses are routinely implanted in patients' eyes during cataract<br>
surgery to replace the clouded natural lens, The post-operative performance of siwh<br>
I OLs, however, can be degraded due to a variety of factors. For example, aberrations<br>
introduced as aresult of misalignment of the implanted IOL relative to the cornea,<br>
and/or the inherent aberrations of the eye, can adversely affect the lens's optical<br>
performance.<br>
Accordingly, there is a need for improved lOLs that can provide E more robust<br>
optical performance,<br>
fenmmarv<br>
In one aspect, the present invention provides an ophthalmic lens (e,g., an<br>
intraocular lens) having an optic with an anterior surface and a posterior surface. The<br>
optic exhibits a shape factor in a range of about -0,5 to about 4. In a related aspect, the<br>
shape factor of the optic lies in a range of about 0 to about 2. The above shape factors<br>
give rise to a plurality of different lens shapes, such as, bi-convex, plano-convex, planoconcave<br>
and convex-concave.<br>
In another aspect, the optic is formed of a biocompatible polymeric material. By<br>

fccanbe, e.g., in a range of about-1162 to about-19 (e,g., in a range of about-<br>
73 to about -27).<br>
In a related aspect, the optic of the above lens can have a shape factor in a range<br>
of about Oto about 2.<br>
In some embodiments in which one or more surEaces of the ophthalmic lens<br>
exhibit asphsricity. the shape factor of the lens (e.g., an IOL) can be selected as a<br>
function of that asphericity so as to optimize the lens's optical performance. By way of<br>
example, in one aspect, the invention .provides an ophthalmic lens having an optic with<br>

Detailed Description of fee Preferred Embodiments<br>
FIGURE 1 schematically depicts an IOL 10 in accordance with one embodiment<br>
of the invention having an optic 12 that includes an anterior surface 14 and a posterior<br>
surface 16. hi this embodiment, the anterior and posterior surfaces 14 and 16 are<br>
symmetrically disposed about an optical axis IB, though in other embodiments one or<br>
both of those surfaces can exhibit a degree of asymmetry relative to the optical axis.<br>
The exemplary IOL 10 further includes radially extending fixation members or implies<br>
20 that facilitate its placement in the eye. In this embodiment, the optic is formed of a<br>
soft acrylic polymer, commonly known as Acrysof, though in other embodiments, it can<br>
be formed of other biocompatible materials, such as silicons or hydrogel, The lens 10<br>
provides a refractive optical power in a range of about 6 to about 34 Diopters (D), and<br>
preferably in a range of about 16 D to about 25 D.<br>
In this exemplary embodiment, the lens 10 has a shape factor in a range of about<br>
0 to about 2, More generally, in many embodiments, the shape factor of the lens 10 can<br>
range from about -0.5 to about A. As known in the art, the shape factor of the lens 10<br>
can be defined in accordance with the following relation:<br>
Shape Factor (X) = L- Eq. (1)<br>
wherein Cj and Cj denote, respectively, "the curvatures of the anterior and posterior<br>
surfaces,<br>
The, shape factor of the IOL 10 can affect the aberrations (e.g., spherical and/or<br>
astigmatic aberrations) that the lens can introduce as a result of its tilt and decentration,<br>
e,g,, when implanted in the subject's eye or in a modal eye. As discussed in more detail<br>
below, aberrations caused by a plurality of lOLs with different shape factors were<br>
theoretically studied as a function of tilt and decentration by utilizing &amp; model eye.<br>
Those studies indicate that lOLs having a shape factor in a range of about 0 to about 2<br>
introduce much reduced aberrations as a result of tilt and decentration.<br>
More particularly, to study the effects of an IOL's shape factor on aberrations<br>
induced by its tilt and decentration, a hypothetical eye model having optical properties<br>
(e.g.. cornea! shape) similar to those of an average human eye was employed. The radii<br>
of optical surfaces and the separations between optical components were chosen to<br>
correspond to mean values of those parameters for the human population. The refractive<br>
indices of the optical components were chosen to provide selected retractive power and<br>
chromatic aberrations, Further, the anterior comeal surface of the model was selected to<br>
have an ashperical shape. An IOL under study replaced the natural lens in the model,<br>
An optical design software marketed as Zomax® (version March 4, 2003, Zemax<br>
Development Corporation, San Diego, CA) was utilized for the simulations of the<br>
optical properties of the model eye. A merit function was defined based on "the rootmean-<br>
square (RMS) wavefront aberration, that is, the RMS wavefront deviation of an<br>
optical system from a plane wsve, In general, the larger the RMS wavefroat error, the<br>
poorer is the performance of the optical system. An optical system with an RMS<br>
wavefront error that is less than about 0.071 waves is typically considered as exhibiting<br>
a diffraction-limited optical performance.<br>
The effects of misalignment (tilt and/or decentration) of an IOL on its optical<br>
performance for a number of different shape factors was simulated by placing the lOLs<br>
in the above model eye and utilizing the Zemax* software. For these simulations, the<br>
IOL was assumed to have spherical surfaces so as to investigate the effects of the shape<br>
factor alone (as opposed to that of the combined shape factor and asphericity), To<br>
simulate the scotopic viewing conditions for old patients, a 5 mm entrance pupil was<br>
chosen. The following misalignment conditions were considered: 1.5 mm IOL<br>
decentration and a 10-degree IOL tilt. These two conditions represent the extreme cases<br>
of IOL misalignments.<br>
FIGURE 2 presents the simulated magnitude of different aberration types<br>
(spherical aberration, defocus, coma and astigmatism) as a function of the shape factor<br>
for 1.5 mm decenlration of the IOL. These simulations indicate that lOLs with a shape<br>
factor in a range of about 0 to about 2 exhibit much lower aberrations as a result of the<br>
deceleration For example, an IOL with a shape factor of about 1 introduces a defbcus<br>
aberration of 0,07 D compared to a defocus aberration of 0.32 D introduced by an IOL<br>
having a shape factor of -1.<br>
FIGURE 3 presents the simulation results for aberrations introduced as a result<br>
of the lOL's tilt. These results indicate that the defocus and astigmatic aberrations are<br>
not significantly influenced by the lOL's shape factor while the coma and spherical<br>
aberrations exhibit even stronger dependence on the shape factor than their dependence<br>
in case of the lOL's decentration, Again, the lOLs with shape factors in a range of ahout<br>
0 to 2 exhibit a stable performance.<br>
In other aspects, it has been discovered that certain bio-metric parameters of the<br>
eye (e.g., cornea! radius and axial length) can be considered while selecting the shape<br>
factor of an IOL for implantation in the eye to provide enhanced performance of the<br>
lens, As discussed in more detail below, in some embodiments, optimal IOL shape<br>
factors are provided for different eye populations, e.g., average human eye (eyes with<br>
average values for certain biometric parameters), and other populations characterized by<br>
extreme values for those parameters.<br>
The biometric parameters of the above eye model were varied to simulate the<br>
performance of a plurality of IOLs having different shape factors for different eyes. For<br>
an average human eye, a comeal radius (r) of 7,72 mm, a corneal asphericity (Q) of-<br>
0.26: an anterior chamber depth (ACD) of 4.9 mm, and an axial length (AL) of 24,4 mm<br>
were assumed, To investigate human eyes with extreme large or small biometric values,<br>
the anterior chamber depth was varied from 4.3 mm to 5.5 mm, the comeal asphericity<br>
was varied from -0.50 to 0, the corneal radius was varied from 7.10 mm to 8,60 mm, and<br>
me axial length was varied from 22.0 mm to 26.0 mm. These ranges are sufficiently<br>
broad to cover the values exhibited by the majority of the population, The optical<br>
performance of the IOLs was evaluated based on two criteria: calculated wave<br>
aberration and modulation transfer function (MTF). As known to those having ordinary<br>
skill in the art, the MTF provides a quantitative measure of image contrast exhibited by<br>
an optical system, e.g., a system formed of an IOL and the cornea. More specifically,<br>
the MTF of an imaging system can be defined as a ratio of a contrast associated with an<br>
image of an object formed by the optical system relative to a contrast associated with the<br>
object.<br>
Table 2 below presents the simulation results of the optical performance of lOLs<br>
having shape factors in a range of about -2 to about 4 for an eye having an average<br>
anterior chamber depth (ACD) of 4.9 mm, B comeal radius of 1.72 mm, a cornea!<br>
asphericity of-0.26, and an axial length (AL) of 24.4 mm, at a pupil size of 5 mm<br>
The above simulations indicate that while for a long axial length (e.g., an axial<br>
length of about 26 mm), lOLs having shape fiactors over a wide range (e.g., in a range of<br>
about -1 to about 8) provide substantially similar performance, for a short axial length<br>
(e.g., an axial length of about 22 mm), an optimal IOL shape factor lies in a range of<br>
about 0 to about 2 (preferably in a range of about 0.5 to about 2), Further, the peak of<br>
optical performance exhibits a shift as a function of axial length variation.<br>
In some embodiments, an anterior or a posterior surface of the IOL includes an<br>
aspherical base profile selected to compensate for fhe comeal spherical aberration,<br>
Alternatively, both anterior and posterior surfaces can be aspherical so as to collectively<br>
provide a selected degree of compensation for the comeal spherical aberration, By way<br>
(Table Removed)  of example, FIGURE 10 shows an IOL 22 according to one embodiment of the<br>
invention that includes an optic having a spherical posterior surface 24 and an aspherical<br>
.anterior surface 26. More specifically, .the anterior surface 26 is characterized by a base<br>
profile that is substantially coincident -with a putative spherical profile 26a (shown by<br>
dashed lines) for small radial distances from an optical axis 28 but deviates from that<br>
spherical profile as the radial distance from the optical axis increases. In this<br>
embodiment, the aspherical anterior surface can be characterized by the following<br>
relation:<br>
In some embodiments, the conic constant k can range from about -1 162 to about<br>
 (e.g., from about -73 to about -27) and the shape factor of the lens can range from<br>
about -0.5 to about A, and more preferably, from about 0 to about 2, To showthe<br>
efficacy of such aspherical IOLs in. reducing the cornea! spherical aberrations, two<br>
aspherical IOLs were theoretically designed. The IOLs were assumed to be formed of<br>
an acrylic polymer commonly known as Acrysof, One of the IOLs was selected to have<br>
a shape factor of zero (X = D) while the other was chosen to have a shape factor of 1 (X<br>
= 1), The edge thickness for each IOL was fixed at 0.21 mm. For the IOL with X = 0,<br>
the anterior and posterior radii were set, respectively, at 22.934 mm and -22.934 mm, the<br>
central thickness was set at 0.577 mm and the anterior surface asphericity (i.e., the conic<br>
constant) was selected to be -43,656. For the IOL withX = 1, the posterior surface was<br>
selected to be flat while the radius of the anterior surface was set at 11.785 mm. The<br>
central thickness of this lens was 0.577 mm and the anterior surface was assumed to<br>
have an asphericity characterized by a conic constant of -3.594. FIGURE 11 shows the<br>
sag of the anterior surfaces of these exemplary IOLs as a function of radial distance from<br>
the optical axis<br>
The simulations of the optical performances of these two IOL designs in the<br>
aforementioned eye model show a reduction of the tota] RMS wavefront errors to about<br>
0.000841 waves in case of the IOL having a shape factor that approaches zero and to<br>
about 0.000046 in case of the IOL having a shape factor of unity.<br>
Another factor that cm affect the optical performance of an IOL IE its effective<br>
position. The effective lens position (e.g., defined here as the location of the principal<br>
plane relative to the posterior surface) can vary as a function of the lens's shape, The<br>
location of the second principal plane (PPa) relative to the apex of the posterior surface<br>
can be defined by the following relation:<br>
Eq,(3)<br>
wherein »/ and HI denote, respectively, the refractive indices of the IOL and the<br>
surrounding medium, Fi represents the optical power of the anterior surface and F3<br>
represents the optical power of the lens, and d is the lens's central thickness. The<br>
haptics plane (the anchor plane for the implanted IOL) located at the central-Jine of the<br>
lens edge can have a distance from the apex of the posterior surface specified as:<br>
~ Bq.(4)<br>
wherein ET denotes the lens's edge thickness and Sag.2 denotes the sag height of the<br>
posterior surface at the lens's edge, Utilizing the above Equations (3) and (4), the<br>
location of the second principal point relative to the haptics plane can be defined as<br>
follows:<br>
Eq.(5)<br>
wherein APPs denotes an offset shift of the principal plane, and the other parameters<br>
are defined above.<br>
By way of example, the 2d principal plane shift for the aforementioned IOL<br>
having a shape factor of zero (X «= 0) was calculated (by utilizing the above equations)<br>
across a power range of 0 to about 35 D as /- 0.03 mm, while the corresponding shift<br>
for the IOL having a shape factor of unity (X «= 1) was calculated as +/- 0.15 mm<br>
To better appreciate the enhanced optical performance provided by the lOLs of<br>
the invention, some of the major factors contributing to the variability of post-operative<br>
refractive errors can be considered. These fectors are generally classified into three<br>
categories: biometric data errors (ABiomezric), IOL power errors (ATOLPower) and<br>
high-order aberration contributions (Mberration}. An overall variability (Rx) can be<br>
calculated based on these factors by utiliang, e.g., the following relation;<br>
RxError = VABiomeMc2 + ATQLPower2 -f Mberration3 Eq, (6)<br>
The ABiometrtc can, in turn, be defined in accordance with the following<br>
relation;<br>
hBiometric = VAF+A4I2 + MCD2 Eq. (7)<br>
wherein AJk denotes the error in karatometric measurement, A/4L denotes the error in<br>
axial length measurement, and M.CD denotes the error in the anterior chamber depth<br>
maasurement. The AZOLPovcer can be defined in accordance with the following<br>
relation;<br>
MOLPower - ^LIOLStep1 + hlOLTo? -f AELP2 Eq. (8)<br>
wherein MOLStep denotes the variability caused by the use of lOLs whose optical<br>
powers differ by finite steps for correcting patients' refractive errors that vary over a<br>
continuous range, AJOLTol denotes manufacturing power tolerance, and AfiLP denotes<br>
the variability in the shift of the IOL effective position across the power range. Further,<br>
(Aberration can be denned in accordance with the following relation;<br>
wherein AAslig, ASA, hOther denote, respectively, astigmatic, spherical and other<br>
higher order aberrations.<br>
The optical performance of the aforementioned exemplary IOL designs having<br>
shape factors (X) of zero and unity were evaluated based on estimated Rx variability for<br>
three conditions; (1) uncorrected visual acuity (i.e., in the absence of corrective<br>
spectacles) with IOL power step of 0.5 D (UCVA), (2) uncorrected visual acuity with a<br>
refined IOL power step of 0.25 D (UCVA+) and (3) best corrected visual acuity.(i.e.,<br>
utilizing optimal corrective spectacles) (BCV A). The variability due to biometric<br>
measurements was estimated from information available in the literature, The focus of<br>
the analysis relates to estimating contributions of the spherical aberration, errors due to<br>
IOL rmsalignmsnts, and fee 2ni! principal plane (PPL) shifts. For comparison purposes,<br>
a baseline value of 0.65 D was assumed for UCVA and UCVA+ and a baseline value of<br>
0.33 D was assumed for BCV A, for eyes with spherical lOLs, Table £ below lists<br>
absolute and percentage reductions in Rx relative to the baseline values for the two<br>
ation presented in Table 8 shows that reductions inRx variability are<br>
achieved for both lOLs (X = 0, and X =1), thus indicating improved optical performance<br>
of those lenses. For the IOL with a vanishing shape factor (X = 0), the visual benefits<br>
are almost evenly distributed among UCVA, UCVA+ and BCVA while for the other<br>
IOL (X=l), the visual benefit associated with BCV A is more pronounced.<br>
A variety of known manufacturing techniques can be employed to fabricate the<br>
lenses of the invention. The manufacturing tolerances can also affect the optical<br>
performance of an IOL. By way of example, such tolerances can correspond to<br>
variations of, e.g., surface radii, conic constant, surface decentration, surface tilt, and<br>
surface irregularity, with tolerances associated with surface asphericity (conic constant)<br>
general!}' playing a more important role that others in affecting optical performance,<br>
Simulations, however, indicate that the lOL's misalignments upon implantation in the<br>
eye are typically more significant factors in degrading optical performance than<br>
manufacturing tolerances (e.g., manufacturing errors can be nearly 10 times less than<br>
misalignment errors), By way of further illustration, the optical performance of the<br>
aforementioned aspherical lenses withX = 0 and X =1, implanted in the aforementioned<br>
eye model, was theoretically investigated by employing Monte Carlo simulations. More<br>
specifically, 500 hypothetical lenses were generated under constraints of typical<br>
manufacturing tolerances and were randomly oriented relative to the cornea For<br>
example, the tolerances associated with the surface radii, surface irregularities, and<br>
surface decentration and tilt were assumed to he, respectively, within +/- 0.1 mm, 2<br>
fringes, 0,05 mm and 0.5 degrees. The results of the Monte Carlo simulations are<br>
summarized in FIGURE 12. Morethan 50% of the simulated eyes exhibit an RMS<br>
wavefront errorthat is less than about 0.2 waves (about 0.08 D equivalent defocus), For<br>
the lens having X = 1, about 98% of the simulated eyes show a wavefront error less than<br>
about 0.3 waves (about 0.12 D),<br>
Those having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that various changes can be<br>
