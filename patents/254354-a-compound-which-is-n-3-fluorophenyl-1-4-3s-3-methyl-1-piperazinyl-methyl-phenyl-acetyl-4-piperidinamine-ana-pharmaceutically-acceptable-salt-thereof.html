The present invention relates to a compound, which is N-(3-Fluorophenyl)-l-[(4-{[(35)-3-methyl-l-piperazinyl]methyl}phenyl)acetyl]-4-piperidinamine and a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
The present invention relates to novel benzylpiperazine derivatives having pharmacological activity, processes for their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and their use in the treatment of various disorders.<br>
GPR38 is a 7-transmembrane, G-protein coupled receptor, with high affinity for the peptide motilin [Feighner et al. Science 1999, 284, 2184], suggesting that endogenous motilin exerts all or most of its activity via this receptor.<br>
Motilin is a 22 amino acid peptide found in large amounts within endocrine-like cells of the gastrointestinal tract, and especially in the duodenum-jejunum areas. During fasting, the peptide ts known to be associated with the onset of Phase III migrating complex activity within the stomach [Boivin et al.. Dig. Dis. Sci. 1992, 37, 1562], suggesting a role in the mechanisms of prokinetic activity. Motilin is also released from the gut during feeding, sham feeding, gastric distension or by oral or intravenous nutrient application [Christofides et al.. Gut 1979, 20, 102; Bormans et al., Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 1987, 22, 781], suggesting additional roles for this peptide in the modulation of motility patterns during feeding.<br>
In animals or in man, motilin has long been known to increase gastrointestinal motility, and promote gastric emptying and intestinal propulsion in an anal direction, during both fasting and fed conditions. This activity is thought to be primarily due to a facilitation of at least the cholinergic excitatory function of the gut [Van Assche et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997, 337, 267], perhaps also involving the activation of the vagus nerve [Mathis &amp; Malbert, Am. J. Physiol 1998, 274, G80]. In addition, higher concentrations of motilin directly evoke a small contraction of the muscle [Van Assche et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997, 337, 267].<br>
The antibiotic erythromycin was shown to mimic the gastrointestinal activity of motilin, in addition to its previously-described antibiotic properties [see Peelers, in Problems of the Gastrointestinal Tract in Anaesthesia Ed., Herbert MK et al. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg 1999, pp 39-51]. More recently, erythromycin has been shown to activate the GPR38 receptor, confirming its ability to mimic the function of motilin [Cameras et al., Analyt. Biochem. 2002, 300, 146]. In addition, the availability of this non-peptide motilin receptor agonist has allowed at least some<br>
clinical studies to be undertaken in order to examine the clinical potential of motilin receptor agonists. These studies have consistently demonstrated an ability to increase gastric emptying in various conditions associated with gastroparesis, such as functional dyspepsia and diabetic gastroparesis. Further, erythromycin has been shown to increase lower esophageal sphincter pressure in man, which together with the increase in gastric emptying, suggests a role in the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disorders (GERO). Finally, erythromycin has been used to promote intestinal propulsive activity, finding clinical utility in the treatment of pseudo-obstruction and in conditions with impaired colonic motllity [Peeters, in Problems of the Gastrointestinal Tract In Anaesthesia Ed., Herbert MK et al. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg 1999, pp 39-51].<br>
Consequently it is expected that agonists at the GPR38 receptor will mimic the activity of motilin and find clinical utility in the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders associated with hypomotlllty, especially the functional bowel disorders such as GERD,  functional dyspepsia (FD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).     The compounds will also be useful for the treatment of other Gl conditions where the cause is known and in which Gl motility is reduced.    Such conditions include constipation, caused by various diseases such as those associated with neuropathy, and/ or by the administration of other drugs, intestinal pseudo-obstruction, paralytic ileus following surgery or some other manipulation, gastric stasis or hypomotility caused by various diseases such as diabetes and/ or by the administration of other drugs. Interestingly, the ability of motilin or erythromycin to activate the vagus nerve, the association of this nerve with changes in feeding behaviour [e.g. Furness et al., Auton. Neuroscl. 2001, 92, 28] and the chromosomal location of GPR38 [based on Ensembl: 13q21.1 (58.46 - 59.46 Mb)] within the markers (D13S257- 13q14.11 to D13S258 at 13q21.33) of a locus associated with obesity [Feitosa et al, Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2002, 70, 72] also suggests that agonists active at the GPR38 receptor will, in addition to promoting gastrointestinal motility, facilitate eating behaviours in at least those patients In which some degree of appetite suppression or cachexia is present. Such activity indicates that agonists at this receptor will find clinical utility in the treatment of symptoms associated with - for example - the treatment of cancer or by the presence of the cancer itself.<br>
In addition to the ability of motilin receptor agonists to promote gastrointestinal motility, the association of motilin gene polymorphism with Crohn's disease [Annese<br><br>
et al., Dig. Dis. Sci. 1998, 43, 715-710] and the changes in motilin receptor density during colitis [Depoortere et al., Neurogastroenterol. Motil. 2001, 13, 55] suggests a utility for agonists at the motilin receptor for the treatment of inflammatory bowel conditions In general.<br>
Finally, QPR38 is also found in regions outside the gastrointestinal tract. These areas include the pituitary, adipose tissue, urinary bladder and certain areas of the brain. The former suggests clinical utility In the promotion of pituitary function, such as the release of growth hormone secretagogues, the presence within adipose tissue again suggests a role in the control of body weight, and the presence within the urinary bladder suggests a role for agonists at this receptor in the treatment of incontinence. The presence of 6PR3B within the brain supports the gastrointestinal and feeding utilities already mentioned, but in addition, suggests an involvement of the receptor in a greater spectrum of vagal-hypothalamic functions.<br>
WO9410185, EP838469, W09823629, DE19805822, and US6165985 claim erythromycin derivatives targeting GPR38 for use in disorders relating to gastrointestinal motility. WO9921846, WO0185694. WO0168620. WO0168621, and WO0168622 disclose a series of small molecule antagonists of the GPR38 receptor. JP07138284 and EP807639 disclose peptide agonists. JP09249620, WO02092592, WO05027637, US2005065156 and Li et al., (2004, Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 47(7) p1704-1708) disclose series of small molecule agonists.<br>
A structurally novel class of compounds has now been found which provides partial or full agonists of the GPR38 receptor.<br>

Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts will be apparent to those skilled in the art and include those described in J. Pharm. Sci., 1977, 66, 1-19, such as acid addition salts formed with inorganic acids e.g. hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, nitric or phosphoric acid; and organic acids e.g. succinic, maleic, acetic, fumaric, citric, tartaric, benzole, p-toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic or naphthalenesulfonic acid. Certain of the compounds of formula (I) may form acid addition salts with one or more equivalents of the acid. The present invention includes within its scope all possible stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric forms.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) may be prepared in crystalline or non-crystalline form, and, if crystalline, may optionally be hydrated or solvated. This invention includes within its scope stoichiometric hydrates or solvates as well as compounds containing variable amounts of water and/or solvent.<br>
In a further aspect, this invention provides processes for the preparation of a compound of formula (I)<br>

wherein A is phenyl and X is CH2 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, which process comprises reacting of a compound of formula (II)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R1 and R2 are as defined in formula (I) and Q is hydrogen or a suitable nitrogen protecting group such as tert-butyloxycarbonyl (BOC) or benzyloxycarbonyl (CBZ), with a compound of formula (III)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein Y and R3 are as defined in formula (I), using reaction conditions suitable for a reductive alkylation, for example in the presence of a reducing agent such as sodium tri(acetoxy)borohydride In a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane or 1,2-dichloroethane.<br>
And thereafter optionally carrying out one or more of the following reactions:<br>
1.	Converting one compound of formula (I) into another compound of formula (I);<br>
2.	Removing any protecting group;<br>
3.	Forming  a  suitable  pharmaceutical  acceptable  salt  or  solvate  of the<br>
compound so formed.<br>
Compounds of formula (III) may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula (IV)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R3 and Y are as defined in formula (I), with a compound of formula (V)<br><br>

in the presence of a suitable coupling reagent such as 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide (EDC) or N.N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane, dimethylformamide or mixtures thereof.<br>
Alternatively, a compound of formula (III) may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula (IV) with an activated derivative of a compound of formula (V), such as an acid chloride, using general methods described in J. March, Advanced Organic Chemisty. 4th Edition, J Wiley &amp; Sons, 1992, p. 417-418.<br>

The present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition, which comprises a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and a pharmaceuticalty acceptable carrier or excipient.<br>
in a further aspect, the present invention provides a process for preparing a pharmaceutical composition, the process comprising mixing a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient.<br>
A pharmaceutical composition of the invention, which may be prepared by admixture, suitably at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure, is usually adapted for oral, parenteral or rectal administration and, as such, may be in the form of tablets, capsules, oral liquid preparations, powders, granules, lozenges, reconstitutable powders, injectable or infusible solutions or suspensions or suppositories. Orally administrate compositions are generally preferred.<br>
Tablets and capsules for oral administration may be in unit dose form, and may contain conventional excipients, such as binding agents (e.g. pregelatinised maize starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone or hydroxypropyl methytcelfuiose); fillers (e.g. lactose, microcrystailine cellulose or calcium hydrogen phosphate); tabletting lubricants (e.g. magnesium stearate, talc or silica); disintegrants (e.g. potato starch or sodium starch<br><br>
glycollate); and acceptable wetting agents (e.g. sodium lauryl sulphate). The tablets may be coated according to methods well known in normal pharmaceutical practice.<br>
Oral liquid preparations may be in the form of, for example, aqueous or oily suspension, solutions, emulsions, syrups or elixirs, or may be in the form of a dry product for reconstitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may contain conventional additives such as suspending agents (e.g. sorbitol syrup, cellulose derivatives or hydrogenated edible fats), emulsifying agents (e.g. lecithin or acacia), non-aqueous vehicles (which may include edible oils e.g. almond oil, oily esters, ethyl alcohol or fractionated vegetable oils), preservatives (e.g. methyl or propyl-p-hydroxybenzoates or sorbic acid), and, if desired, conventional flavourings or colorants, buffer salts and sweetening agents as appropriate. Preparations for oral administration may be suitably formulated to give controlled release of the active compound.<br>
For parenteral administration, fluid unit dosage forms are prepared utilising a compound of the invention or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a sterile vehicle. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form e.g. in ampoules or in multi-dose, utilising a compound of the invention or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a sterile vehicle, optionally with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilising and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g. sterile pyrogen-free water, before use. The compound, depending on the vehicle and concentration used, can be either suspended or dissolved in the vehicle.    In preparing solutions, the compound can be dissolved for injection and filter sterilised before filling into a suitable vial or ampoule and sealing.   Advantageously, adjuvants such as a local anaesthetic, preservatives and buffering agents are dissolved in the vehicle.   To enhance the stability, the composition can be frozen after filling into the vial and the water removed under vacuum. Parenteral suspensions are prepared in substantially the same manner, except that the compound is suspended in the vehicle instead of being dissolved,  and  sterilisation cannot be accomplished  by filtration.     The compound can be sterilised by exposure to ethylene oxide before suspension in a sterile vehicle.   Advantageously, a surfactant or wetting agent is included in the composition to facilitate uniform distribution of the compound.<br><br>
Lotions may be formulated with an aqueous or oily base and will in general also contain one or more emulsifying agents, stabilising agents, dispersing agents, suspending agents, thickening agents, or colouring agents. Drops may be formulated with an aqueous or non-aqueous base also comprising one or more dispersing agents, stabilising agents, solubilising agents or suspending agents. They may also contain a preservative.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be formulated in rectal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas, e.g. containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be formulated as depot preparations. Such long acting formulations may be administered by implantation (for example subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. Thus, for example, the compounds of the invention may be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for example as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives, for example, as a sparingly soluble salt.<br>
For intranasal administration, the compounds of the invention may be formulated as solutions for administration via a suitable metered or unitary dose device or alternatively as a powder mix with a suitable carrier for administration using a suitable delivery device. Thus compounds of formula (I) may be formulated for oral, buccal, parenteral, topical (including ophthalmic and nasal), depot or rectal administration or in a form suitable for administration by inhalation or insufflation (either through the mouth or nose).<br>
The compounds of the invention may be formulated for topical administration in the form of ointments, creams, gels, lotions, pessaries, aerosols or drops (e.g. eye, ear or nose drops). Ointments and creams may, for example, be formulated with an aqueous or oily base with the addition of suitable thickening and/or gelling agents. Ointments for administration to the eye may be manufactured in a sterile manner using sterilised components.<br><br>
The composition may contain from 0.1% to 99% by weight, preferably from 10 to 60% by weight, of the active material, depending on the method of administration. The dose of the compound used in the treatment of the aforementioned disorders will vary in the usual way with the seriousness of the disorders, the weight of the sufferer, and other similar factors.

The combined organics were dried (MgSO4) and concentrated to give the title compound as a colourless oil (118mg). δH (CDCI3, 400MHz) 7.43 (1H. d). 7.25 (1H, s), 7.09 (2H, m), 6.38 (1H, td), 6.33 (1H, dd), 6.26 (1H, m), 4.52 (1H, m). 3.85 (1H, m), 3.70 (2H, s), 3.62 (1H, m), 3.57 (2H, s), 3.44 (1H, m), 3.16 (1H, m), 2.91 (4H, m), 2.77 (2H, m), 2.07 (3H, m), 1.78 (1H. t), 1.33 (1H, m), 1.15 (1H, m), 1.02 (3H, d). MS (ES): MH+ 459/461<br>
This whole was dissolved in MeOH and treated with 1M HCI in Et2O (0.28ml) to give a hydrochloride salt of the title compound (106mg). MS (ES): MH* 459/461.<br>
GPR38 FLIPR functional agonist assay protocol<br>
24 hours prior to assay, CHO-K1 cells stably expressing the GPR38 receptor were seeded (10,000 cells/well) into poly-D-lysine coated 384-well black-wall, dear-bottom microtitre plates (Greiner). On the day of assay, media was aspirated from cell plates using a cell washer {leaving 10ul of media). Cells were immediately loaded with loading buffer (Tyrodes (Elga water + 145mM NaCI + 5mM KCI + 20mM HEPES + 10mM glucose + 1mM MgCI2) + 1.5mM CaCI2 + 0.714mg/ml Probenicid (predissolved in 1 M NaOH) + 0.25mM brilliant black + 2uM Fluo 4 dyej, and incubated at 37.5°C for 1 hour.<br>
Plates were then assayed on a FLuorometric Imaging Plate Reader (FLIPR, Molecular Devices).<br>
Master compound plates were prepared in 100% DMSO. A top concentration of 3mM was used (giving 12µM final concentration in assay) and this was serially diluted 1 in 4. 1ul from the master plate was transferred to a daughter plate, to which 50µl of<br><br>
compound dilution buffer (Tyrodes + 1mg/ml BSA + 1.5mM CaCI2) was added. In the FLIPR, 10ul of test compound was added to the cells and changes in fluorescence measured over a 1 minute timeframe. Maximum change in fluorescence over baseline was used to determine agonist response and concentration response curves were constructed, using a 4-parameter logistic equation.<br>
Exemplified compounds of the invention have a pECSO &gt; 6.5 in the FLIPR assay.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

1. A compound, which is N-(3-Fluorophenyl)-l-[(4-{[(35)-3-methyl-l-piperazinyl]methyl}phenyl)acetyl]-4-piperidinamine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.</td>
