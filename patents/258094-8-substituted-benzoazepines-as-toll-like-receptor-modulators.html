8-SUBSHTUTED BENZOAZEPINES AS TOLL-LIKE RECEPTOR MODULATORS<br>
This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. § 119 of United States<br>
provisional patent application number 60/710,004, filed August 19, 2005, the contents of<br>
which are incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to methods and compositions for modulating immune function.<br>
More specifically, this invention relates to compositions and methods for modulating TLR7-<br>
and/or TLR8-mediated signaling.<br>
Description of the state of the art<br>
Stimulation of the immune system, which includes stimulation of either or both innate<br>
immunity and adaptive immunity, is a. complex phenomenon that can result in either<br>
protective or adverse physiologic outcomes for the host. In recent years there has been<br>
increased interest in the mechanisms underlying innate immunity, which is believed to initiate<br>
and support adaptive immunity. This interest has been fueled in part by the recent discovery<br>
of a family of highly conserved pattern recognition receptor proteins known as Toll-like<br>
receptors (TLRs) believed to be involved in innate immunity as receptors for pathogen-<br>
associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Compositions and methods useful for modulating<br>
innate immunity are therefore of great interest, as they may affect therapeutic approaches to<br>
conditions involving autoinununity, inflammation, allergy, asthma, graft rejection, graft<br>
versus host disease (GvHD), infection, cancer, and immunodeficiency.<br>
Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are type I transmembrane proteins that allow organisms<br>
(including mammals) to detect microbes and initiate an innate immune response (Beutler, B.,<br>
Nature 2004, 430:257-263). They contain homologous cytoplasmic domains and leucine-rich<br>
extracellular domains and typically form homodimers that sense extracellular (or internalized)<br>
signals and subsequently initiate a signal transduction cascade via adaptor molecules such as<br>
MyD88 (myeloid differentiation factor 88), There is such high homology in the cytoplasmic<br>
domains of the TLRs that, initially, it was suggested that similar signaling pathways exist for<br>
all TLRs (Re, F., Strominger, J. L., Immunobiology 2004, 209:191-198). Indeed, all TLRs<br>
can activate NF-kB and MAP kinases; however, the cytokine/chemokine release profiles<br><br>
-2-<br>
derived from TLR activation appears unique to each TLR. Additionally, the signaling<br>
pathway that TLRs stimulate is very similar to the pathway that the cytokine receptor IL-1R<br>
induces. This may be due to the homology that these receptors share, i.e., TIR (Toll/EL-IR<br>
homology) domains. Once the TIR domain is activated in TLRs and MyD88 is recruited,<br>
activation of the IRAK family of serme/threonine kinases results which eventually promotes<br>
the degradation of Ik-B and activation of NF-kB (Means T. K., et al. Life Sci. 2000, 68:241-<br>
258). While it appears that this cascade is designed to allow extracellular stimuli to promote<br>
intracellular events, there is evidence that some TLRs migrate to endosomes where signaling<br>
can also be initiated. This process may allow for intimate contact with engulfed microbes and<br>
fits with the role that these receptors play in the innate immune response (Underbill, D. M.. ct<br>
al.. Nature 1999, 401:811-815). This process might also allow host nucleic acids, released by<br>
damaged tissues (for example, in inflammatory disease) or apoptosis to trigger a response via<br>
endosomal presentation. Among mammals, there are 11 TLRs that coordinate this rapid<br>
response. A hypothesis put forward years ago (Janeway, C. A., Jr., Cold Spring Harb. Symp.<br>
Quant. Biol. 1989, 54:1-13) that the innate immune response initiates the adaptive immune<br>
response through the pattern of TLR activation caused by microbes has now been<br>
substantiated. Thus, the pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) presented by a<br>
diverse group of infectious organisms results in a innate immune response involving certain<br>
cytokines, chemokines and growth factors followed by a precise adaptive immune response<br>
tailored to the infectious pathogen via antigen presentation resulting in antibody production<br>
and cytotoxic T cell generation.<br>
Gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has long been appreciated as an<br>
adjuvant and immune-stimulant and as a pharmacological tool for inducing an inflammatory<br>
reaction in mammals similar to septic shock. Using a genetic approach, TLR4 was identified<br>
as the receptor for LPS. The discovery that LPS is an agonist of TLR4 illustrates the<br>
usefulness of TLR modulation for vaccine and human disease therapy (Aderem, A.; Ulevitch,<br>
R. J., Nature 2000, 406:782-787). It is now appreciated that various TLR agonists can<br>
activate B cells, neutrophils, mast cells, eosinophils, endothelial cells and several types of<br>
epithelia in addition to regulating proliferation and apoptosis of certain cell types.<br>
To date, TLR7 and TLR8, which are somewhat similar, have been characterized as<br>
receptors for single-stranded RNA found in endosomal compartments and thus thought to be<br>
important for the immune response to viral challenge. Imiquimod, an approved topical anti-<br>
viral/anti-cancer drug, has recently been described as a TLR7 agonist that has demonstrated<br><br>
-3-<br>
clinical efficacy in certain skin disorders (Miller R. L., et al., Int. J. Immunopharm. 1999,<br>
21:1-14). This small molecule drug has been described as a structural mimetic of ssRNA.<br>
TLR8 was first described in 2000 (Du, X., et al., European Cytokine Network 2000 (Sept.),<br>
11(3):362-371) and was rapidly ascribed to being involved with the innate immune response<br>
to viral infection (Miettinen, M., et al., Genes and Immunity 2001 (Oct), 2(6):349-355).<br>
Recently it was reported that certain imidazoquhioline compounds having antiviral<br>
activity are ligands of TLR7 and TLR8 (Hemmi H., et al. (2002) Nat. Immunol. 3:196-200;<br>
.Turk M., et al. (2002) Nat. Immunol. 3:499). Imidazoquinolines are potent synthetic activators<br>
of immune cells with antiviral and antitumor properties. Using macrophages from wildtype<br>
and MyD88-deficieni mice, Hemmi et al. recently reported that two imidazoquinolines,<br>
imiquimod and resiquimod (R848), induce tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukm-12<br>
(IL-12) and activate NF-KB only in wildtype cells, consistent with activation through a TLR<br>
(Hemmi H., et al. (2002) Nat. Immunol. 3:196-200). Macrophages from mice deficient in<br>
TLR7 but not other TLRs produced no detectable cytokines in response to these<br>
imidazoquinolines. In addition, the imidazoquinolines induced dose-dependent proliferation<br>
of splenic B cells and the activation of intracellular signaling cascades in cells from wildtype<br>
but not TLR7-/- mice. Luciferase analysis established that expression of human TLR7, but<br>
not TLR2 or TLR4, in human embryonic kidney cells results in NF-KB activation in response<br>
to resiquimod. The findings of Hemmi et al. thus suggest that these inuIazoquinoline<br>
compounds are non-natural ligands of TLR7 that can induce signaling through TLR7.<br>
Recently it was reported that R848 is also a ligand for human TLR8 (Jurk M., et al. (2002)<br>
Nat. Immunol. 3:499).<br>

It is to be understood that in instances where two or more radicals are used in<br>
succession to define a substituent attached to a structure, the first named radical is considered<br>
to be terminal and the last named radical is considered to be attached to the structure in<br>
question. Thus, for example, an arylalkyl radical is attached to the structure in question by the<br>
alkyl group.<br>
The compounds of this invention may possess one or more asymmetric centers; such<br>
compounds can therefore be produced as individual (R)- or (S)-stereoisomers or as mixtures<br>
thereof. Unless indicated otherwise, the description or naming of a particular compound in<br>
the specification and claims is intended to include both individual enantiomers, diastereomers<br>
mixtures, racemic or otherwise, thereof. Accordingly, this invention also includes all such<br>
isomers, including diastereomeric mixtures, pure diastereomers and pure enantiomers of the<br><br>
-12-<br>
Fonnula I. Diastereomeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereomers on<br>
the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods known to those skilled in the art,<br>
for example, by chromatography or fractional crystallization. Enantiomers can be separated<br>
by converting the enantiomer mixture into a diastereomeric mixture by reaction with an<br>
appropriate optically active compound (e.g., alcohol), separating the diastereomers and<br>
converting (e.g., hydrolyzing) the individual diastereomers to the corresponding pure<br>
enantiomers. Enantiomers can also be separated by use of a chiral HPLC column. Methods<br>
for the determination of stereochemistry and the separation of stereoisomers are well known<br>
in the art (see discussion in Chapter 4 of "Advanced Organic Chemistry". 4th edition, J.<br>
March, John WiJey and Sons. New York, 1992).<br>
In the structures shown herein, where the stereochemistry of any particular chiral atom<br>
is not specified, then all stereoisomers are contemplated and included as the compounds of the<br>
invention. Where stereochemistry is specified by a solid wedge or dashed line representing a<br>
particular configuration, then that stereoisomer is so specified and defined.<br>
A single stereoisomer, e.g. an enantiomer, substantially tree of its stereoisomer may be<br>
obtained by resolution of the racemic mixture using a method such as formation of<br>
diastereomers using optically active resolving agents (Eliel, E. and Wilen, S. Stereochemistiy<br>
of Organic Compounds, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York, 1994; Lochmuller, C. H.,<br>
(1975) J. Chromatogr., 113(3):283-302). Racemic mixtures of chiral compounds of the<br>
invention can be'separated and isolated by any suitable method, including: (1) formation of<br>
ionic, diastereomeric salts with chiral compounds and separation by fractional crystallization<br>
or other methods, (2) formation of diastereomeric compounds with chiral derivatizing<br>
reagents, separation of the diastereomers, and conversion to the pure stereoisomers, and (3)<br>
separation of the substantially pure or enriched stereoisomers directly under chiral conditions.<br>
See: Drug Stereochemistry, Analytical Methods and Pharmacology, Irving W. Wainer, Ed.,<br>
Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York (1993).<br>
Under method (1), diastereomeric salts can be formed by reaction of enantiomerically<br>
pure chiral . bases such as brucine, quinine, ephedrine, sttychnine, a-methyl-P-<br>
phenylethylamine (amphetamine), and the like with asymmetric compounds bearing acidic<br>
' functionality, such as carboxylic acid and sulfonic acid. The diastereomeric salts may be<br>
induced to separate by fractional crystallization or ionic chromatography. For separation of<br>
the optical isomers of amino compounds, addition of chiral carboxylic or sulfonic acids, such<br><br>
-13-<br>
as camphorsulfonic acid, tartaric acid, mandelic acid, or lactic acid can result in formation of<br>
the diastereomeric salts.<br>
Alternatively, by method (2), the substrate to be resolved is reacted with one<br>
enantiomer of a chiral compound to form a diastereomeric pair (E. and Wilen, S.<br>
"Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds", John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1994, p. 322).<br>
Diastereomeric compounds can be formed by reacting asymmetric compounds with<br>
enantiomerically pure chiral derivatizing reagents, such as menthyl derivatives, followed by<br>
separation of the diastereomers and hydrolysis to yield the pure or enriched enantiomer. A<br>
method of determining optical purity involves making chiral esters, for example a menthyl<br>
ester such as (-) menthyl chloroformate, in the presence of base, or Moshcr ester, a-methoxy-<br>
a-(rrifluoromethyl)phenyl acetate (Jacob III. (1982) J. Org. Chem. 47:4165), of the racemic<br>
mixture, and analyzing the NMR spectrum for the presence of the two atropisomeric<br>
enantiomers or diastereomers. Stable diastereomers of atropisomeric compounds can be<br>
separated and isolated by normal- and reverse-phase chromatography following methods for<br>
separation of atropisomeric naphthyl-isoquinolines (WO 96/15111). By method (3), a<br>
racemic mixture of two enantiomers can be separated by chromatography using a chiral<br>
stationary phase (Chiral Liquid Chromatography (1989) W. J. Lough, Ed., Chapman and<br>
Hall, New York; Okamoto, (1990) J. of Chromatogr. 513:375-378). Enriched or purified<br>
enantiomers can be distinguished by methods used to distinguish other chiral molecules with<br>
asymmetric carbon atoms, such as optical rotation and circular dichroism.<br>
In addition to compounds of the Formula I, the invention also includes solvates,<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs, pharmaceutically active metabolites, solvates, and<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts of such compounds.<br>
The term "solvate" refers to an aggregate of a molecule with one or more solvent<br>
molecules.<br>
A "pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug" is a compound that may be converted under<br>
physiological conditions or by solvolysis to the specified compound or to a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt of such compound. Prodrugs include compounds wherein an amino acid<br>
residue, or a polypeptide chain of two or more (e.g., two, three or four) amino acid residues is<br>
covalently joined through an amide or ester bond to a free amino, hydroxy or carboxylic acid<br>
group of compounds of the present invention. The amino acid residues include but are not<br>
limited to the 20 naturally occurring amino acids commonly designated by three letter<br>
symbols and also includes phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, phosphotyrosine, 4-<br><br>
- -14-<br>
hydroxyproline, hydroxylysine, demosine, isodemosine, gamma-carboxygrutamate, hippuric<br>
acid, octahydroindole-2-carboxylic acid, statine, l,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoIine-3-carboxylic<br>
acid, penicillamine, ornithine, 3-methylhistidine, norvaline, beta-alanine, gamma-<br>
aminobutyric acid, cirtulline, homocysteine, homoserine, methyl-alanine, para-<br>
benzoylphenylalanine, phenylglycine, propargylglycine, sarcosine, methionine sulfone and<br>
tert-butylglycine. Particular examples of prodrugs of this invention include a compound of<br>
Formula I covalently joined to a phosphate residue or a valine residue.<br>
Additional types of prodrugs are also encompassed. For instance, free carboxyl<br>
groups can be dcrivatized as amides or alkyl esters. As anothei example, compounds of this<br>
invention comprising free hydroxy groups may be derivatized as prodrugs by convening the<br>
hydroxy group into groups such as, but not limited to, phosphate ester, hemisuccinate,<br>
dimethylaminoacetate, or phosphoryloxymethyloxycarbonyl groups, as outlined in Advanced<br>
Drug Delivery Reviews, (1996) 19:115. Carbamate prodrugs of hydroxy and amino groups<br>
are also included, as are carbonate prodrugs, sulfonate esters and sulfate esters of hydroxy<br>
groups. Derivatization of hydroxy groups as (acyloxy)methyl and (acyloxy)etbyl ethers<br>
wherein the acyl group may be an alkyl ester, optionally substituted with groups including,<br>
but not limited to, ether, amine and carboxylic acid functionalities, or where the acyl group is<br>
an amino acid ester as described above, are also encompassed. Prodrugs of this type are<br>
described in J. Med. Chem., (1996) 39:10. More specific examples include replacement of the<br>
hydrogen atom of the alcohol group with a group such as (CrC6)alkanoyloxymethyl,<br>
l-((Ci-C6)alkanoyloxy)ethyl,	1-methyl-l-((Ci-C6)alkanoyloxy)ethyl,<br>
(Ci-C6)alkoxycarbonyloxymethyl, N-(Ci-C6)alkoxycarbonylaminomethyl, succinoyl,<br>
(C)-C6)alkanoyl, a-amino(Ci-C4)alkanoyl, arylacyl and a-aminoacyl, or a-aminoacyl-a-<br>
aminoacyl, where each a-aminoacyl group is independently selected from the naturally<br>
occurring L-amino acids, P(0)(OH)2, -P(0)(0(Ci-C6)alkyl)2 or glycosyl (the radical resulting<br>
from the removal of a hydroxyl group of the hemiacetal form of a carbohydrate).<br>
Free amines can also be derivatized as amides, sulfonamides or phosphonamides. All<br>
of these prodrug moieties may incorporate groups including, but not limited to, ether, amine<br>
and carboxylic acid functionalities. For example, a prodrug can be formed by the replacement<br>
of a hydrogen atom in the amine group with a group such as R-carbonyl, RO-carbonyl, NRR'-<br>
carbonyl where R and R' are each independently (Ci-Cio)alkyl, (C3-C7)cycloalkyl, benzyl, or<br>
R-carbonyl is a natural a-aminoacyl or natural a-aminoacyl-natural a-aminoacyl, -<br>
C(OH)C(0)OY wherein Y is H, (C,-C6)alkyl or benzyl, -C(OY0)Yi wherein Y0 is (d-C4)<br><br>
-15-<br>
alkyl and Yi is (Ci-C6)alkyl, carboxy(Ci-C6)alkyl, amino(Ci-C4)alkyl or mono-N- or di-N,N-<br>
(Ci-C6)alkylaminoalkyl, -C(Y2)Y3 wherein Y2 is H or methyl and Y3 is mono-N- or di-N,N-<br>
(Ci-C6)alkylamino, morpholino, piperidin-1-yl or pyrrolidin-1-yl.<br>

A "pharmaceutically acceptable salt," unless otherwise indicated, includes salts that<br>
retain the biological effectiveness of the free acids and bases of the specified compound and<br>
that are not biologically or otherwise undesirable. A compound of the invention may possess<br>
a sufficiently acidic, a sufficiently basic, or both functional groups, and accordingly react with<br>

sulfonates, and mandelates. Since a single compound of the present invention may include<br>
more than one acidic or basic moieties, the compounds of the present invention may include<br>
mono, di or tri-salts in a single compound.<br>
If the inventive compound is a base, the desired pharmaceutically acceptable salt may<br>
be prepared by any suitable method available in the art, for example, treatment of the free<br>
base with an acidic compound, particularly an inorganic acid, such as hydrochloric acid,<br>

like.<br>
If the inventive compound is an acid, the desired pharmaceutically acceptable salt may<br>
be prepared by any suitable method, for example, treatment of the free acid with an inorganic<br>
or organic base. Examples of suitable inorganic salts include those formed with alkali and<br>

moieties may include, for example, those salts formed with procaine, quinine and N-<br>
methylglucosamine, plus salts formed with basic amino acids such as glycine, ornithine,<br>
histidine, phenylglycine, lysine and arginine.<br>
The present invention also provides salts of compounds of Formula I which are not<br>
necessarily pharmaceutically acceptable salts, but which may be useful as intermediates for<br>
preparing and/or purifying compounds of Formula I and/or for separating enantiomers of<br>
compounds of Formula I.<br>
The inventive compounds may be prepared using the reaction routes and synthesis<br>
schemes as described in Scheme I, employing the techniques available in the art using starting<br>
materials that are readily available, or can be synthesized according to the methods described<br>
in the Examples and Figures 1 -4 or using methods known in the art.<br><br><br>
-17-<br>
In Scheme I, compounds of Formula II may be prepared from an alkyl arene of<br>
Formula I by treatment with dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal with or without the use of<br>
pyrollidine (J. Org. Chem., (1986), 51(26), 5106-5110) in DMF at 70-90 °C. The crude<br>
intermediate (not shown) may be cleaved to the aldehyde of Formula II with NaIC&gt;4 in<br>
THF/pH 7.2 phosphate buffer at or around room temperature. The aldehyde of Formula II<br>
may be olefinated with phosphonium ylid in toluene at temperatures ranging from 70 to. 110<br>
°C (1 - 16 hours) to give compounds of Formula HI. Compounds of Formula TV can be<br>
prepared from a compound of Formula III using iron powder in acetic acid. The reaction may<br>
be conducted at temperatures between around 90 °C for about 3-14 hours.<br>
It is noted that some of the preparations of compounds of Formula I described herein<br>
may require protection of remote functionalities. The need for such protection will vary<br>
depending on the nature of the functionality and the conditions used in the preparation<br>
methods and can be readily deterrnined by those skilled in the art Such<br>
protection/deprotection methods are well known to those skilled in the art<br>
The compounds of the invention find use in a variety of applications. For example, in<br>
certain aspects the invention provides methods for modulating TLR7- and/or TLR8-mediated<br>
signaling. The methods of the invention are useful, for example, when it is desirable to alter<br><br>
-18-<br>
TLR7- and/or TLR8-mediated signaling in response to a suitable TLR7 and/or TLR8 ligand<br>
or a TLR7 and/or TLR8 signaling agonist.<br>
As used herein, the terms "TLR7 and/or TLR8 ligand," "ligand for TLR7 and/or<br>
TLR8," and "TLR7 and/or TLR8 signaling agonist" refer to a molecule, other than a<br>
compound of Formula I, that interacts directly or indirectly with TLR7 and/or TLR8 through<br>
a TLR7 and/or TLR8 domain other than a TIR8 domain, and induces TLR7- and/or TLR8-<br>
mediated signaling. In certain embodiments, a TLR7 and/or TLR8 ligand is a natural ligand,<br>
i.e.. a TLR7 and/or TLR8 ligand that is found in nature. In certain embodiments, a TLR7<br>
and/or TLR8 ligand refers to a molecule other than a natural ligand of TLR7 and/or TLRS.<br>
e.g., a molecule prepared by human activity.<br>
The term "modulate" as used herein with respect to the TLR7 and/or TLRS receptors<br>
means the mediation of a pharmacodynamic response in a subject by (i) inhibiting or<br>
activating the receptor, or (ii) directly or indirectly affecting the normal regulation of the<br>
receptor activity. Compounds that modulate the receptor activity include agonists, antagonists,<br>
mixed agonists/antagonists and compounds that directly or indirectly affect regulation of the<br>
receptor activity.<br>
The term "agonist" refers to a compound that, in combination with a receptor (e.g., a<br>
TLR); can produce a cellular response. An agonist may be a ligand that directly binds to the<br>
receptor. Alternatively, an agonist may combine with a receptor indirectly by, for example, (a)<br>
forming a complex with another molecule that directly binds to the receptor, or (b) otherwise<br>
resulting in the modification of another compound so that the other compound directly binds<br>
to the receptor. An agonist may be referred to as an agonist of a particular TLR (e.g., a TLR7<br>
and/or TLR8 agonist).<br>
The term "antagonist" as used herein refers to a compound that competes with an<br>
agonist or inverse agonist for binding to a receptor, thereby blocking the action of an agonist<br>
or inverse agonist on the receptor. However, an antagonist has no effect on constitutive<br>
receptor activity. More specifically, an antagonist is a compound that inhibits the activity of<br>
TRL7 or TLR8 at the TLR7 or TLR8 receptor, respectively.<br>
"Inhibit" refers to any measurable reduction of biological activity. Thus, as used<br>
i herein, "inhibit" or "inhibition" may be referred to as a percentage of a normal level of<br>
activity.<br>
In one aspect of this invention, a method of treating a condition or disorder treatable<br>
by modulation of TLR7- and/or TLR8-mediated cellular activities in a subject comprises<br><br>
-19-<br>
administering to said subject a composition of Formula I in an amount effective to treat the<br>
condition or disorder. The term "TLR7- and/or TLR8-mediated" refers to a biological or<br>
biochemical activity that results from TLR7- and/or TLR8 function.<br>
Conditions and disorders that can be treated by the methods of this invention include,<br>
but are not limited to, cancer, immune complex-associated diseases, inflammatory disorders,<br>
immunodeficiency, graft rejection, graft-versus-host disease, allergies, asthma, infection, and<br>
sepsis. More specifically, methods useful in the treatment of conditions involving<br>
autoimmunity, inflammation, allergy, asthma, graft rejection, and CvBD generally will<br>
employ compounds of Formula I that inhibit TLR7- and/or TLR8-mediated signaling in..<br>
response to a suitable. TLR7 and/or TLR8 ligaud or signaling agonist. Alternatively, methods<br>
useful in the treatment of conditions involving infection, cancer, and immunodeficiency<br>
generally will employ compounds of Formula I that augment TLR7- and/or TLR8-mediated<br>
signaling in response to a suitable TLR7 and/or TLR8 ligand. In some instances the<br>
compositions can be used to inhibit or promote TLR7- and/or TLR8-mediated signaling in<br>
response to a TLR7 and/or TLR8 ligand or signaling agonist. In other instances the<br>

This invention also encompasses pharmaceutical compositions containing a compound<br>
of Formula I and methods of treating conditions and disorders treatable by modulation of<br>
TLR7- and/or TLR8-mediated cellular activities by administering a pharmaceutical<br>
composition comprising a compound of Formula I, or a metabolite, solvate, tautomer, or<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug or salt thereof, to a patient in need thereof.<br><br>
-22-<br>
In order to use a compound of Formula I or a solvate, metabolite, tautomer or<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug or salt thereof for the therapeutic treatment (including<br>
prophylactic treatment) of mammals including humans, it is normally formulated in<br>
accordance with standard pharmaceutical practice as a pharmaceutical composition.<br>
According to this aspect of the invention there is provided a pharmaceutical composition that<br>
comprises a compound of Formula I, or a solvate, metabolite, tautomer or pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable prodrug or salt thereof, as defined hereinbefore in association with a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier.<br>
To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions according to this invention, a<br>
therapeutically or proprndacticaliy effective amount of a compound of Formula I or a solvate,<br>
metabolite tautomer or pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug or salt thereof (alone or together<br>
with an additional therapeutic agent as disclosed herein) is intimately admixed, for example,<br>
with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical<br>
compounding techniques to produce a dose. A carrier may take a wide variety of forms<br>
depending on the form of preparation desired for administration, e.g., oral or parenteral.<br>
Examples of suitable carriers include any and all solvents, dispersion media, adjuvants,<br>
coatings, antibacterial and antifungal1 agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents,<br>
sweeteners, stabilizers (to promote long term storage), emulsifiers, binding agents, thickening<br>
agents, salts, preservatives, solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal<br>
agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, flavoring agents, and miscellaneous materials<br>
such as buffers and absorbents that may be needed in order to prepare a particular therapeutic<br>
composition. The use of such media and agents with pharmaceutically active substances is<br>
well known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible<br>
with a compound of Formula I, its use in the therapeutic compositions and preparations is<br>
contemplated. Supplementary active ingredients can also be incorporated into the<br>
compositions and preparations as described herein.<br>
The compositions of the invention may be in a form suitable for oral use (for example<br>
as tablets, lozenges, hard or soft capsules, aqueous or oily suspensions, emulsions, dispersible<br>
powders or granules, syrups or elixirs), for topical use (for example as creams, ointments,<br>
gels, or aqueous or oily solutions or suspensions), for administration by inhalation (for<br>
example as a finely divided powder or a liquid aerosol), for administration by insufflation (for<br>
example as a finely divided powder) or for parenteral administration (for example as a sterile<br>
aqueous or oily solution for intravenous, subcutaneous, or intramuscular dosing or as a<br><br>
-23-<br>
. suppository for rectal dosing). For example, compositions intended for oral use may contain,<br>
for example, one or more coloring, sweetening, flavoring and/or preservative agents.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutically-acceptable excipients for a tablet formulation include, for<br>
example, inert diluents such as lactose, sodium carbonate, calcium phosphate or calcium<br>
carbonate, granulating and disintegrating agents such as corn starch or algenic acid; binding<br>
agents such as starch; lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc;<br>
preservative agents such as ethyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, and anti-oxidants, such as<br>
ascorbic acid. Tablet formulations may be uncoated or coated either to modify their<br>
disintegration and the subsequent absorption of the active ingredient within the<br>
gastrointestinal tract, or to improve their stability and/or appearance, in either case, using<br>
conventional coating agents and procedures well known in the art.<br>
Compositions for oral use may be in the form of hard gelatin capsules in which the<br>
active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium<br>
phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules in which the active ingredient is mixed with<br>
water or an oil such as peanut oil, liquid paraffin, or olive oil.<br>
Aqueous suspensions generally contain the active ingredient in finely powdered form<br>
together with one or more suspending agents, such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose,<br>
methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone, gum<br>
tragacanth and gum acacia; dispersing or wetting agents such as lecithin or condensation<br>
products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids (for example polyoxethylene stearate), or<br>
condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for example<br>
heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters<br>
derived from fatty acids and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or<br>
condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and<br>
hexitol anhydrides, for example polyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The aqueous suspensions<br>
may also contain one or more preservatives (such as ethyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, anti-<br>
oxidants (such as ascorbic acid), coloring agents, flavoring agents, and/or sweetening agents<br>
(such as sucrose, saccharine or aspartame).<br>
Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a<br>
vegetable oil (such as arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil) or in a mineral oil (such<br>
as liquid paraffin). The oily suspensions may also contain a thickening agent such as<br>
beeswax, hard paraffin or ceryl alcohol. Sweetening agents such as those set out above, and<br><br>
-24-<br>
flavoring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions<br>
may be preserved by the addition of an antioxidant such as ascorbic acid.<br>
Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by<br>
the addition of water generally contain the active ingredient together with a dispersing or<br>
wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or<br>
wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above.<br>
Additional excipients such as sweetening, flavoring and coloring agents, may also be present.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be in the form of oil-in-<br>
water emulsions. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil, such as olive oil or araehis oil, or a<br>
mineral oil, such as for example liquid paraffin or a mixture of any of these. Suitable<br>
emulsifying agents may be, for example, naturally-occurring gums such as gum acacia or gum<br>
tragacanth, naturally-occurring phosphatides such as soya bean, lecithin, esters or partial<br>
esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides (for example sorbitan monooleate) and<br>
condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide such as polyoxyethylene<br>
sorbitan monooleate. The emulsions may also contain sweetening, flavoring and preservative<br>
agents.<br>
Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents such as glycerol,<br>
propylene glycol, sorbitol, aspartame or sucrose, and may also contain a demulcent,<br>
preservative, flavoring and/or coloring agent.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions may also be in the form of a sterile injectable<br>
aqueous or oily suspension, which may be formulated according to known procedures using<br>
one or more of the appropriate dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents, which<br>
have been mentioned above. For parenteral formulations, the carrier will usually comprise<br>
sterile water, aqueous sodium chloride solution, 1,3-butanediol, or any other suitable non-<br>
toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent. Other ingredients including those that aid<br>
dispersion may be included. Of course, where sterile water is to be used and maintained as<br>
sterile, the compositions and carriers must also be sterilized. Injectable suspensions may also<br>
be prepared1, in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be<br>
employed.<br>
Suppository formulations may be prepared by mixing the active ingredient with a<br>
suitable non-irritating excipient that is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal<br>
temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Suitable excipients<br>
include, for example, cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols.<br><br>
-25-<br>
Topical formulations, such as creams, ointments, gels and aqueous or oily solutions or<br>
suspensions, may generally be obtained by formulating an active ingredient with a<br>
conventional, topically acceptable, vehicle or diluent using conventional procedures well<br>
known in the art.<br>
Compositions for adrninistration by insufflation may be in the form of a finely divided<br>
powder contouring particles of average diameter of, for example, 30 urn or much less, the<br>
powder itself comprising either active ingredient alone or diluted with one or more<br>
physiologically acceptable carriers such as lactose. The powder for insufflation is then<br>
conveniently retained in a capsule containing, for example, 1 to 50 mg of active ingredient for<br>
use with a. turbo-inhaler device, such as is used for insufflation of the known agent sodium<br>
cromoglycate.<br>
Compositions for administration by inhalation may be in the form of a conventional<br>
pressurized aerosol arranged to dispense the active ingredient either as an aerosol containing<br>
finely divided solid or liquid droplets. Conventional aerosol propellants such as volatile<br>
fluorinated hydrocarbons or hydrocarbons may be used and the aerosol device is conveniently<br>
arranged to dispense a metered quantity of active ingredient<br>
Compositions for transdermal adrninistration may be in the form of those transdermal<br>
skin patches that are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
Other delivery systems can include time-release, delayed release or sustained release<br>
delivery systems. Such systems can avoid repeated administrations of the compounds,<br>
increasing convenience to the subject and the physician. Many types of release delivery<br>
systems are available and known to those of ordinary skill in the art. They include polymer<br>
base systems such as poly(lactide-glycolide), copolyoxalates, polycaprolactones,<br>
polyesteramides, polyorthoesters, polyhydroxybutyric acid, and polyanhydrides.<br>
Microcapsules of the foregoing polymers containing drugs are described in, for example, U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,075,109. Delivery systems also include non-polymer systems that are: lipids<br>
including sterols such as cholesterol, cholesterol esters and fatty acids or neutral fats such as<br>
mono-dirand tri-glycerides; hydrogel release systems; silastic systems; peptide based systems;<br>
wax coatings; compressed tablets using conventional binders and excipients; partially fused<br>
implants; and the like. Specific examples include, but are not limited to: (a) erosional systems<br>
in which an agent of the invention is contained in a form within a matrix such as those<br>
described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,452,775, 4,675,189, and 5,736,152, and (b) diffusional<br>
systems in which an active component permeates at a controlled rate from a polymer such as<br><br>
-26-<br>
described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,854,480, 5,133,974 and 5,407,686. In addition, pump-based<br>
hardware delivery systems can be used, some of which are adapted for implantation.<br>

The amount of a compound of this invention that is combined with one or more<br>
excipients to produce a single dosage form will necessarily vary depending upon the subject<br>
treated, the severity of the disorder or condition, the rate of administration, the disposition of<br>
the compound and the discretion of the prescribing physician. However, an effective dosage<br>
is in the range of about 0.001 to about 100 mg per kg body weight per day. for example, about<br>
0.5 to about 35 mg/kg/day, in single or divided doses. For a. 70 kg human, this would amount<br>
to about 0.0035 to 2.5 g/day, such as about 0.05 to about 2.5 g/day. In some instances, dosage<br>
levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range may be more than adequate, while in other<br>
cases still larger doses may be employed without causing any harmful side effect, provided<br>
that such larger doses are first divided into several small doses for administration throughout<br>
the day. For further information on routes of administration and dosage regimes, see Chapter<br>
25.3 in Volume 5 of Comprehensive Medicinal Chemistry (Corwin Hansch; Chairman of<br>
Editorial Board), Pergamon Press 1990, which is specifically incorporated herein by<br>

In another embodiment of the invention, an article of manufacture, or "kit", containing<br>
materials useful for the treatment of the disorders described above is provided. In one<br>
embodiment, the kit comprises a container comprising a composition of Formula I, or a<br>
metabolite, solvate, tautomer, or pharmaceuticaUy acceptable salt or prodrug thereof. In one<br>
embodiment, the invention provides a kit for treating a TLR7- and/or TLR8-mediated<br>
disorder. In another embodiment, the invention provides a kit for a condition or disordei<br>
treatable by selective, modulation of the immune system in a subject. The kit may further<br>
comprise a label or package insert on or associated with, the container. Suitable containers<br>
include, for example, bottles, vials, syringes, blister pack, etc. The container may be formed<br>
from a variety of materials such as glass or plastic. The container holds a compound of<br>
Formula I or a pharmaceutical formulation thereof in an amount effective for treating the<br>
condition, and may have a sterile access port (for example, the container may be an<br>
intravenous solution bag or a vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection<br>
needle). The label or package insert indicates that the composition is used for treating the<br>
condition of choice. In one embodiment, the label or package inserts indicates that the<br>
composition comprising a compound of Formula I can be used, for example, to treat a<br>
disorder treatable by modulation of TLR.7- and/or TLR8-mediated cellular activities. The<br>
label or package insert may also indicate that the composition can be used to treat other<br>
disorders. Alternatively, or additionally, the kit may further comprise a second container<br>
comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable buffer, such as bacteriostatic water for injection<br>
(BWFI), phosphate-buffered saline, Ringer's solution and dextrose solution. It may further<br>
include other materials desirable from a commercial and user standpoint, including other<br>
buffers, diluents, filters, needles, and syringes.<br>
The kit may further comprise directions for the administration of the compound of<br>
Formula I and, if present, the second pharmaceutical formulation. For example, if the kit<br>
comprises a first composition comprising a compound of Formula I and a second<br>
pharmaceutical formulation, the kit may further comprise directions for the simultaneous,<br>
sequential or separate administration of the first and second pharmaceutical compositions to a<br>
patient in need thereof.<br>
In another embodiment, the kits are suitable for the delivery of solid oral forms of a<br>
compound of Formula I, such as tablets or capsules. Such a kit includes, for example, a<br><br>
-29-<br>
number of unit dosages. Such kits can include a card having the dosages oriented in the order<br>
of their intended use. An example of such a kit is a "blister pack". Blister packs are well<br>
known in the packaging industry and are widely used for packaging pharmaceutical unit<br>
dosage forms. If desired, a memory aid can be provided, for example in the form of numbers,<br>
letters, or other markings or with a calendar insert, designating the days in the treatment<br>
schedule in which the dosages can be administered.<br>
According to one embodiment, the kit may comprise (a) a first container with a<br>
compound of Formula I contained therein: and optionally (b) a second container with a<br>
second pharmaceutical formulation contained therein, wherein the second, pharmaceutical<br>
formulation comprises a second compound which may he effective in treating a condition or<br>
disorder treatable by selective modulation of TLR7- and/or TLR8-mediated cellular activities.<br>
Alternatively, or additionally, the kit may further comprise a third container comprising a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable buffer, such as bacteriostatic water for injection (BWFI),<br>
phosphate-buffered saline, Ringer's solution and dextrose solution. It may further include<br>
other materials desirable from a commercial and user standpoint, including other buffers,<br>
diluents, filters, needles, and syringes.<br>
In certain other embodiments wherein the kit comprises a pharmaceutical formulation<br>
of a compound of Formula I and a second formulation comprising a second therapeutic agent,<br>
the kit may comprise a container for containing the separate formulations, such as a divided<br>
bottle or a divided foil packet; however, the separate compositions may also be contained<br>
within a single, undivided container. Typically, the kit comprises directions for the<br>
administration of the separate components. The kit form is particularly advantageous when<br>
the separate components are administered in different dosage forms (e.g., oral and parenteral),<br>
are administered at different dosage intervals, or when titration of the individual components<br>
of the combination is desired by the prescribing physician.<br>
