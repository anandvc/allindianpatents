The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
NOVEL AZASUGAR DERIVATIVE AND DRUG CONTAINING THE SAME AS THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a novel hydroxamic acid compound having an azasugar structure and, more particularly, to an azasugar derivative represented by the following general formula (A):<br><br>
OH<br>
wherein R1 represents a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, a hydroxyl group, an amino group, a C1-C8 alkyl group, a phenyl group, a phenoxy group, a C1-C8 alkoxy group (said C1-C8 alkoxy group may be substituted with a C1-C4 alkoxy group or a C1-C4  alkylthio group) or a heteroallyloxy group, or a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
2<br><br>
salt thereof, and a drug containing the same as an active ingredient.<br>
Also the present invention is related to a compound which is useful as an intermediate for preparation of the above compound (A) and is represented by the following formula (IIA) or (IIB):<br><br>
wherein Ar represents a phenyl group which may have a substituent at the p-position, CO-R2 represents a hydroxamic acid equivalent, and OR3 represents a hydroxyl group equivalent.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Taking notice of high coordinative ability to metal atoms, various hydroxamic acid compounds have been developed as a metalloenzyme inhibitor. Although peptide-based compounds have mostly been developed (see, for example, WO94/02447 and WO90/05719), various compounds containing sulfonic acid amide in a partial structure have recently been published and, for example, European Patent Publication (EP1081137) discloses a compound having the same N-sulfonylpiperidine-2-hydroxamic acid structure as that of the compound of the present invention as an aggrecan degrading enzyme<br>
3<br><br>
inhibitor.<br>
For a metalloenzyme as a target of inhibition, for example, MMP (WO90/05716) such as collagenases, stromelysins and gelatinases, TNF-. producing enzyme (WO 94/10990) and Fas ligand solubilization enzyme (WO 97/09066) have become of major interest in view of the development of medicaments.<br>
It is known that EGF family growth factors are syntheszied as membrane-bound proteins as precursors which are broken into a soluble form by action of the metalloenzyme, and thus the resulting soluble ligand binds to EGF receptors. In case of HB-EGF among them, the solubilization process plays an important role in the proliferation of keratinocytes (WO 01/70269] Said publication discloses that a hydroxamic acid derivative having a tetrahydroisoquinoline skeleton inhibits a solubilizing enzyme of HB-EGF and is useful as a remedy for keratinocyte-proliferative diseases.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a novel remedy for keratinocyte-proliferative diseases.<br>
The present inventors have intensively studied and found that a hydroxamic acid compound having an azasugar structure represented by the above general formula (A) inhibits solubilization of HB-EGF and is useful as a remedy for keratinocyte-proliferative diseases, and thus the present invention has been completed.<br>
The present invention will now be described in<br>
detail.<br>

FIG. 1 is a graph showing hyperplasia inhibitory activity by virtue of a compound of Example 4.<br>
FIG. 2 is a graph showing re-epithelialization rate(%)of keratinocytes inhibitory activity by virtue of a compound of Example 4.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to a compound represented by the general formula (A):<br>
OH<br><br>
wherein Ar represents a phenyl group which may have a substituent at the p-pbsition, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The substituent as used herein includes, for example, a halogen atom, a hydroxyl group, an amino group, a C1-C8 alkyl group, a phenyl group, a phenoxy group, a C1-C8 alkoxy group (said C1-C8 alkoxy group may be substituted with a C1-C4 alkoxy group or a C1-C4 alkylthio group), or a heteroallyloxy group. Among these substituents, a methoxy group, a 2-ethoxyethoxy group or a phenoxy group is particularly preferable.<br>

Similar to the above, the substituent includes, for example, a halogen atom, a hydroxyl group, an amino group, a C1-C8 alkyl group, a phenyl group, a phenoxy group, a C1-Cs alkoxy group (said C1-C5 alkoxy group may be substituted with a C1-C4 alkoxy group or a C1-C4 alkylthio group) or a heteroallyloxy group.<br>
Furthermore, the hydroxamic acid equivalent as used herein means a monovalent atomic group CONHOH itself and a functional group which can be chemically converted into said atomic group CONHOH by a conventional method, and R2 includes, for example, a methoxy group, an ethoxy group, or a benzyloxyamino group. Since said benzyloxyamino group can be easily introduced by the condensation reaction between carboxylic acid and benzyloxyamine, the hydroxamic acid equivalent includes a carboxyl group and various esters which can be easily converted into a carboxyl group. Therefore carboxylic acid protected with various<br>
6<br><br>
carboxyl protective groups is included and R2 includes, for example, a benzyloxy group and a tert-butyloxy group, in addition to the methoxy group, the ethoxy group and the benzyloxyamino group.<br>
The hydroxyl group equivalent as used herein means a hydroxyl group itself and a functional group which can be chemically converted into a hydroxyl group by a conventional method, and R3 means a hydrogen atom, and alcohol protective group such as acetyl group, benzyl group, tert-butyl group, and tetrahydropyranyl group.<br>
Among the compound (IIA) or (IIB), a compound represented by the following formula (IIIA) or (IIIB):<br><br>
wherein R1 represents a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, a hydroxyl group, an amino group, a C1-C5 alkyl group, a phenyl group, a phenoxy group, a C1-C5 alkoxy group (said C1-C5 alkoxy group may be substituted with a C1-C4 alkoxy group or a C1-C4 alkylthio group) or a heteroallyloxy group, R4 represents a hydrogen atom or an acetyl group, and R5 represents a benzyloxyamino group, a benzyloxy group, a methoxy group or an ethoxy group, is particularly preferably used.<br>

The compound (A) of the present invention can be prepared by the method described below. 1. Preparation of stereoisomers (le) and (Ig) of compound (I):<br>
For example as shown in the following scheme (Scheme 1):<br>
Scheme 1<br><br><br>
(wherein TBDMS represents a tert-butyldimethylsilyl group and R1 is as defined above), stereoisomers (Ie) and (Ig) can be prepared by deprotecting a compound (IV) obtained by reacting D- or L-threitol with a glycine derivative [see Tetrahedron Letters, Vol. 38, No. 46,   8009-8012 (1997)] and performing the ring closure reaction to obtain a precursor (IIIA-1), followed by deprotection and chemical conversion of a functional group.<br>
First, a protective group (TBDMS) of a primary hydroxyl group of the compound (IV) [see Tetrahedron Letters, Vol. 38, No. 46, 8009-8012 (1997)] is deprotected to obtain a compound (V). The reaction is usually conducted by adding TBAF in an inert solvent such as THF and stirring at 0°C to room temperature for 30 minutes to 2 hours.<br>
Then, the compound (V) is cyclized by the<br>
Mitsunobu reaction to obtain a compound (IIIA-1). The<br>
reaction can be conducted for example by adding<br>
triphenylphosphine and DEAD in an inert solvent such as<br>
THF and stirring at 0°C to room temperature for 30<br>
minutes to 4 hours. In this case, since a mixture<br>
derived from epimerization of asymmetric carbon at the<br>
.-position of the benzyloxycarbonyl group of the<br>
compound (IIIA-1) may appear, the compound (IIIA-1) is<br>
subjected to the following reaction after separation"<br>
and purification by various chromatography means such<br>
as HPLC. Alternatively, the compound (IIIA-1) may be<br>
subjected to the following reaction in the form of a<br>
mixture and may be separated and purified in any stage.<br>
The resulting precursor (IIIA-1) can be converted<br>
10<br><br>
into the objective stereoisomers (Ie) or (Ig) by converting a benzyloxycarbonyl group into a benzyloxyaminocarbonyl group and performing deprotection of each group.<br>
First, a benzyl ester moiety of the compound (IIIA-1) is cleaved and removed by hydrogenolysis, followed by condensation with benzylhydroxylamine to obtain a compound (IIIA-2). The hydrogenolysis is usually conducted by optionally adding water in ethyl acetate, lower alcohol such as methanol, or 1,4-dioxane, and stirring in the presence of a catalyst such as 10% palladium-carbon, 20% palladium hydroxide-carbon or platinum under a hydrogen gas flow or pressure at room temperature to 60°C for 1 to 5 hours. The following condensation is usually conducted by using a condensing agent such as DCC or WSC and stirring at 0°C to room temperature for 2 to 24 hours in the presence of an optional auxiliary condensing agent such as HOBt. The molar ratios of the reactants are 0.8 to 1.5 mols of benzylhydroxylamine, 1.0 to 1.5 mol of the condensing agent and 1.0 to 1.5 mol of the auxiliary condensing agent based on 1 mol of the carboxylic acid compound.<br>
Then, each protective group of the compound (IIIA-2) is cleaved and removed to obtain the objective compound. The acetyl group, the acetonide group and the benzyl group may be cleaved and removed by a conventional method. For example, the deacetylation reaction is usually conducted by adding 28% NaOMe in a lower alcohol such as methanol and stirring at 0°C to room temperature for 1 to 6 hours. For example, the acetonide group is cleaved and removed by optionally<br>
11<br><br>
adding water in a solvent such as methanol in the presence of a cation exchange resin and reacting at room temperature to 50°C for 2 to 24 hours. The benzyl group can be cleaved and removed by hydrogenolysis in the same manner as described above.<br>
In Scheme 1, a compound (IVe) as a (3S, 4S, 5R) isomer of the compound (IV) may be used so as to obtain the stereoisomer (le) and a compound (IVg) as a (3R, 4R, 5S) isomer of the compound (IV) may be used so as to obtain the stereoisomer (Ig) (the numbering is based on hexanoic acid) . The compound (IVe) or (IVg) can be derived from the reaction between a glycine derivative and L-threitol or D-threitol respectively. 2. Preparation of stereoisomers (If) and (Ih) of compound (I):<br>
For example as shown in the following scheme (Scheme 2):<br><br><br>
Scheme 2<br><br>
(wherein THP represents a tetrahydropyranyl group and R1 is as defined above), stereoisomers (If) and (Ih) can be prepared by protecting hydroxyl groups at the 3-and 4-positions of the stereoisomer (le) or (Ig) with an acetonide group and performing steric inversion of a hydroxyl group at the 5-position (the numbering is based on the piperidine ring).<br>
First, protective groups (tetrahydropyranyl group<br>
13<br><br>
and acetonide group) of a compound (IIIA-3), which can be synthesized in the same manner as in case of the compound (IIIA-1) shown in Scheme 1, are cleaved and removed to obtain a compound (VI). In the reaction, according to the method using the cation exchange resin used in the cleavage of the above acetonide group, both protective groups can be simultaneously cleaved and removed.<br>
Then, acetonidation of the compound (VI) is conducted to obtain a compound (IIIB-1) . The reaction can be conducted by adding a 5- to 15-fold amount of DMP in an inert solvent such as DMF in the presence of an acid catalyst such as p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate or camphor-10-sulfonic acid and reacting at room temperature to 80°C for 2 to 24 hours.<br>
A hydroxyl group of the compound (IIIB-1) is converted into a triflate group and then steric inversion is caused by the SN2 nucleophilic substitution reaction to obtain a compound (IIIB-2). The reaction for preparation of a triflate compound is usually conducted by adding trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride in a solvent such as methylene chloride in the presence of a base such as triethylamine or pyridine at -60 to 0°C and stirring at the same temperature for 30 minutes to 2 hours. In this case, the resulting triflate compound is subjected to the following reaction immediately after the completion of the reaction without being purified, or can be subjected to the following reaction immediately after purification by silica gel column chromatography. The following SN2 nucleophilic substitution reaction can be<br>
14<br><br>
conducted by adding cesium acetate in a solvent such as acetonitrile in the presence of 18-Crown-6 and stirring at 0aC  to room temperature for 1 to 24 hours.<br>
A benzyl ester moiety of the compound (IIIB-2) is cleaved and removed by hydrogenolysis, followed by condensation with benzylhydroxylamine to obtain a compound (IIIB-3). Subsequently, the respective protective groups, for example, an acetyl group, an acetonide group and a benzyl group of the compound (IIIB-3) are cleaved and removed in any order to obtain the objective stereoisomer (If) or (Ih) . The reaction conditions are the same as in Scheme 1. 3. Preparation of stereoisomers (la), (lb), (Ic) and (Id) of compound (I):<br>
Stereoisomers (la), (lb), (Ic) and (Id) can be prepared through the following scheme (Scheme 3):<br><br><br><br>
(wherein R1 is as defined above).<br>
First, an azide group of a compound (VII) [see Synthesis, No. 9, 1305-1309 (2000)] is reduced, followed by reaction with allylsulfonyl chloride (VIII) to obtain a compound (IX). For example the reduction of the azide group can be conducted by optionally adding water in ethyl acetate, lower alcohol or 1,4-dioxane, and stirring in the presence of a catalyst such as 10% palladium-carbon, 20% palladium hydroxide-carbon or platinum under a hydrogen gas flow or<br><br><br>
pressure at room temperature to 60°C. The following reaction with allylsulfonyl chloride (VIII) is usually conducted in an inert solvent such as DMF in the presence of a base such as DMAP by stirring at 0°C to room temperature for 1 to 24 hours.<br>
Then, a terminal acetonide group of the compound<br>
(IX)	is selectively cleaved and removed. The reaction<br>
is usually conducted by optionally adding water in a<br>
solvent such as methanol in the presence of a cation<br>
exchange resin and stirring at room temperature to 50°C<br>
for 5 hours to 4 days. Alternatively, the objective<br>
compound (X) can also be obtained by stirring in<br>
acetonitrile at room temperature for 0.5 to 2 hours<br>
using cerium chloride heptahydrate and oxalic acid.<br>
Then, a primary hydroxyl group of the compound<br>
(X)	is selectively converted into a mesyl group. The<br>
reaction is conducted by stirring in a solvent such as<br>
methylene chloride in the presence of a base such as<br>
triethylamine or DIEA at low temperature preferably<br>
ranging from -60 to -20°C for 30 minutes to 5 hours<br>
using 0.95 to 1.05 mol of mesyl chloride to obtain the<br>
objective compound   (XI).<br>
Then, a compound (IIIB-4) is obtained by the intramolecular ring closure reaction of the compound<br>
(XI)	. The reaction is usually conducted in an inert<br>
solvent such as DMF in the presence of a base such as<br>
potassium carbonate or triethylamine at room<br>
temperature to 100°C, and preferably 40 to 60°C for 1<br>
to 5 hours to obtain the objective compound (IIIB-4).<br>
An ester moiety of the compound (IIIB-4) is converted into corresponding carboxylic acid by<br>
17<br><br>
alkaline hydrolysis, which is then condensed with benzylhydroxylamine without being purified to obtain a compound (IIIB-5). The alkaline hydrolysis is usually conducted by stirring in a lower alcohol such as methanol at 0 to 60°C for 1 to 5 hours using an aqueous sodium hydroxide or lithium hydroxide solution, and preferably an aqueous IN solution of the hydroxide. Subsequently, an acetonide group and a benzyl group are cleaved and removed to obtain a compound (la), (lb), (Ic) or (Id) . These reactions may be conducted in the same manner as in Scheme 1 or 2.<br>
In Scheme 3, a compound (Vila) as a (3R, 4S, 5S) isomer of the compound (VII) may be used so as to obtain the stereoisomer (la), a compound (Vllb) as a (3S, 4R, 5S) isomer of the compound (VII) may be used so as to obtain the stereoisomer (lb), a compound (VIIc) as a (3S, 4R, 5R) isomer of the compound (VII) may be used so as to obtain the stereoisomer (Ic), and a compound (Vlld) as a (3R, 4S, 5R) isomer of the compound (VII) may be used so as to obtain the stereoisomer (Id) (the numbering is based on hexanoic acid). The compound (Vila) can be prepared from L-gulono-1,4-lactone, the compound (Vllb) can be prepared from L-glucono-1,5-lactone, the compound (VIIc) can be prepared from D-gulono-1,4-lactone, and the compound (Vlld) can be prepared from D-mannono-1,4-lactone [Synthesis, 9, 1305-1309 (2000)]. 4. Another method for preparation of stereoisomer (Id) of compound (I):<br>
According to the following scheme (Scheme 4)<br><br><br><br>
(wherein R1 is as defined above), the stereoisomer (Id) can also be prepared by protecting hydroxyl groups at the 3- and 4-positions of the stereoisomer (la) and performing steric inversion of a hydroxyl group at the<br>
19<br><br>
5-position (the numbering is based on the piperidine ring).<br>
First, a compound (IIIB-7) is obtained by steric inversion of a free hydroxyl group of a compound (IIIB-6) [one of the compound (IIIB-5) in Scheme 3]. Specifically, said hydroxyl group is converted into a triflate group and then the SN2 nucleophilic substitution reaction due to acetoxy ions is conducted. The reaction conditions are the same as in Scheme 2.<br>
Subsequently, the respective protective groups, for example, an acetyl group, an acetonide group and a benzyl group of the compound (IIIB-7) are cleaved and removed in any order to obtain the objective stereoisomer (Id). The reaction conditions are the same as in Scheme 1.<br>
These compounds can be orally or parenterally administered to human.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations for oral administration include solid preparations such as tablets, granules, powders, fine granules and hard capsules, and solutions such as syrups and soft capsules. These preparations can be prepared by a conventional method. For example, tablets, granules, powders or fine granules are prepared by mixing the above compound or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof with a conventional pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, such as lactose, starch, crystalline cellulose, magnesium stearate, hydroxypropyl cellulose, talc, etc., and the hard capsules can be prepared by filling the above fine granules or powders into suitable capsules. Besides, the syrups are prepared by dissolving or<br>
20<br><br>
suspending the above compound or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in an aqueous solution containing sucrose, carboxycellulose, etc., and the soft capsules are prepared by dissolving or suspending the compound or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in lipid excipients (for example, vegetable oils, oily emulsion, glycol, etc.) and then filling the resultant into soft capsules.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations suitable for parenteral administration include injections and further percutaneous preparations (ointment, lotion or cream preparation), suppositories (for example, suppository for rectal administration, suppository for vaginal administration), and nasal preparation (for example, spray preparation). These preparations can be prepared by a conventional method. For example, the injections can be prepared by dissolving or emulsifying the compound or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in physiological saline or a lipid excipient (for example, vegetable oil, oily emulsion, glycol, etc.) and then filling in an ampoule or vial with sealing under sterile condition. Ointment preparation is prepared by mixing the above compound or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof with a base such as vaseline, paraffin or glycerin, and optionally adding an emulsifier or a preservative by a conventional method.<br>
The dosage of the drug of the present invention may vary depending on the dosage forms, ages, sexes, weights or conditions of the patients, but it is usually in the range of 0.1-600 mg/kg weight/day, and<br>
21<br><br>

The cells were pretreated with 0.1 ml/well of the test compound solution [prepared by diluting a 1 mM or 0.1 mM dimethyl sulfoxide (hereinafter referred to as DMSO) solution with DMSO and further diluting 100 times with MEM to necessary consentration] for 30 min in a CO2 incubator at 37°C. Then the culture supernatant was removed by suction and cells were treated with 0.2<br>

ml/well of TPA solution (120 uM of DMSO solution was diluted to 60 nM with MEM) containing the same concentration of the compound as pretreatment for 60 min in a CO2 incubator at 37°C. The cells pretreated with MEM and incubated with only the TPA solution containing no test compound were used as control.<br>
After these treatments, each 0.1 ml of culture supernatant collected from each well and 0.1 ml of MEM as background were transferred to individual wells of new 96 well microplate and incubated at 65°C for 10 min after plate sealing to inactivate endogenous AP in MEM and cells. 0.1 ml of the substrate solution (prepared by diluting an aqueous 100 nig/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate solution prepared previously 100 times with 0.01% magnesium chloride/1 M diethanolamine before use) for AP was added to each well and incubated for 120 minutes at room temperature in the dark. The absorbance at a wavelength of 405 nm of each well was measured using a microplate reader. The IC50 (uM) values of the test compounds were calculated by determining the concentration of the test compounds required to exhibit 50% of the absorbance, a difference between absorbance of the well containing only MEM as background and absorbance of the culture supernatant in case of adding only TPA being 100. 3.

After backs of male BALB/c mice were shaved, 10 uL of a TPA-acetone solution (0.1 mM) was applied to the dorsal skin surface in an area of about 1 cm2. In the medicine-treated group, a volume of 20 uL of a solution prepared by dissolving the test compound in acetone was applied to the same area 5 minutes, 24 hours and 48 hours after TPA application. In the non-treated group, only TPA was applied. In the control group, acetone was applied instead of the TPA-acetone solution.<br>
The mice were sacrificed and the skin tissues<br>
were excised 72 hours after TPA application. Then the<br>
tissues were fixed with formalin, the vertical sections<br>
including the center of the TPA- or acetone-treated<br>
area were prepared and embedded in paraffin according<br>
to the conventional method. And they were stained by<br>
hematoxylin-eosin after removing paraffin. The<br>
24<br><br>
epidermal thickness was measured using a microscope.<br>
The epidermal thickness of the group treated with TPA and the test compounds (the treated group) was compared with those of the non-treated group and the control group, and thus hyperplasia inhibitory activity of the test compounds was examined. 3. Test results<br>
The test results are shown in FIG. 1. In FIG. 1, the numeral in the ordinate represents the epidermal thickness (um) . A bar graph of TPA (-) represents the epidermal thickness of the control group and a bar graph of TPA represents the epidermal thickness of the non-treated group. The respective bar graphs of 1, 10 and 100 denote the epidermal thickness of the group wherein the test compound is administered at a dose of 1, 10 and 100 (ug/wound) of each test compound. A significance test of the treated group relative to the non-treated group was conducted by the Dunnett"s method. The results are indicated by the symbol * or ** (* p

medicine-treated group, immediately after the operation, a test compound suspended in 0.01M phosphate-buffered saline containing 1.5% sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (vehicle) was applied to each wound in a volume of 50 uL/wound. From the following day, the compound was repeatedly applied to each wound once a day for 7 days. In the control group, vehicle solution only was applied in the same manner. Eight days after the operation, mice were sacrificed and skin tissues containing wound area were removed. The tissues were fixed with a 10% neutral buffer formalin solution for one day and embedded in paraffin according to the conventional method. The crosssections were made perpendicularly to the anterior-posterior axis. Keratinocytes in the specimen were stained by immuno histochemical staining method with an anti-keratin antibody after removing paraffin. Measurements of wound size (mm) and re-epithelialization of keratinocytes (mm) were performed by using an image-analyzing software. Re-epithelialization rate(%) of keratinocytes was calculated as follows with regard to each animal. Re-epithelialization rate (%) of Keratinocytes = [(Re-epithelialization of Keratinocytes)/(Wound Size)] * 100 3. Test results<br>
The test results are shown in FIG. 2. In FIG. 2, the numeral in the ordinate represents re-epithelialization rate (%) of keratinocytes. Black four bar graphs denote re-epithelialization rate (%) of keratinocytes of the treated group and the numeral at the bottom represents a dose (ug/wound) of each test compound.
