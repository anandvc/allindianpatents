PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE                                                            <br>
2<br>
The present invention relates to an enzyme detection product and also to a method for detecting the presence of an enzyme.<br>
it is known in the art to detect the presence of enzymes under a variety of circumstances. Aside from laboratory methods, kits have been provided which allow the detection of specific enzymes, or types of enzymes without specialist equipment.<br>
For example, it has been disclosed to provide a kit for use by a dentist in order to analyse the gingival crevicuiar fluid of a patient for the presence of a protease enzyme. A sample of the fluid is taken from the patient and is placed on a filter paper namely loaded with a primary reactant namely the synthetic peptide known as BANA [Na- benzoyi-dl-Arg k-naphthylamide). As is shown in Figure 1, in the presence of a protease, a napthylamine moiety is cleaved from the BANA peptide. Another portion of the filter paper is loaded with a secondary reactant DMAC (Dimethyl amino cinnamaldehyde). In response to the presence of the cleaved napthylamine moiety and HCi, DMAC changes colour (from colourless to pink/red). In use, the filter paper is folded over bringing the area loaded with DMAC into contact with the area loaded with BANA and sample, to permit mixing thereof and any colour change is observed, [f a colour change occurs then this is an indication that a protease is present in the patient's sample.<br>
While such prior art detection systems work acceptably well, they have several problems in their wider applicability. One problem is that, while gingival crevicuiar fluid is generally clear, other'samples may not be clear and therefore it is more difficult to observe the colour change which may be taking place. For example, if the sample is blood, or contaminated with blood, then it has a strong background colour of its own which may obscure the colour which is produced in the reaction.<br>
Another problem with such prior art systems is that they are susceptible to providing false positive results because the sample, itself, may contain the components which will react with the secondary reactant in order to provide the colour change or other<br><br>
3<br>
signs). With some chromagenic systems colour may be generated through reactions with amino acids or short peptides (e.g ninhydrin). For instance, to continue the example given above, the gingival crevicuiar fluid sample may contain a free primary aromatic amine group or an analogue thereof which can react with the DMAC in order to result in a colour change even when no protease is present and the BANA peptide has not been cleaved.<br>
The present invention seeks to alleviate one or more of the above problems.<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided an enzyme detection product for detecting the presence of an enzyme in a sample comprising: a reaction zone for receiving a sample;<br>

Advantageousiy, the reaction zone has a sump made from an absorbent material located adjacent to it.<br>
Preferably, a layer is located between the reaction zone and the sump, such as an adhesive layer. It is particularly preferred that the layer extends laterally outwardly of the reaction zone. For example, if the reaction zone and the layer are circular then the layer has a greater diameter than the reaction zone.<br>
Conveniently, at least one of the reaction zone and visualisation zone is covered by a removable protective film.<br>
Preferably, the visualisation zone comprises a second reactant capable of reacting with the reaction product to generate the signal.<br><br>
5<br>
Advantageously, the enzyme is a protease; the first reactant being the BANA peptide and the second reactant being D-MAC.<br>
Conveniently, the enzyme detection product further comprises a sample dispersion means for facilitating the lateral movement of the sample; breaking up the surface of the reaction zone and forming channels therein to conduct the sample therethrough.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of detecting the presence of an enzyme in a sample comprising the steps of:<br>
i) contacting the sample with a first reactant, the reactant producing a reaction product in the presence of the enzyme;<br>
ii) separating at least some of the components in the mixture which are smaller than a threshold size into a visualisation zone, the reaction product being smaller than the threshold size; and<br>
ijj) detecting the presence of the reaction product in the visualisation zone.<br>

In order that the present invention may be more readily described and so that further features of the invention may be understood, embodiments of the invention shall now be described by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:<br>

FIGURE 13 is a cross-sectional diagram of an enzyme detection product according to a further embodiment; and<br>
FIGURE 14 is an image of an enzyme detection product according to another embodiment, following usage.<br>
Referring to FIGURE 2, an enzyme detection product 1 comprises a paper or cardboard book 2 comprising first and second leaves 3,4 of identical shape and size connected at a spine 5. Thus the spine 5 acts as a hinge between the first and second leaves 3,4.<br>
In the centre of the first leaf 3, there is provided a first aperture 6 in the book 2. On top of the first leaf 3, covering the aperture 6 is provided a visualisation pad 7 which is covered by a protective film prior to use (not shown).<br>
Referring now to FIGURE 3A, the visualisation pad 7 will be described in greater detail. The internal face of the first leaf 3 carries a first adhesive film 8, in which there is an aperture 9 aligned with, but larger than, the first aperture 6. On top of the first<br><br>
8<br>
adhesive film 8 is provided a visualisation film 10 made from polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) which hydrates but does not dissolve in the presence of water. The visualisation film 10 contains DMAC and HCI within its structure. The visualisation film 10, though centred on the aperture 6, is smaller than the first adhesive film 8. The visualisation film 10 is optically clear, carries no inherent colour and allows uniform cofour development. It is non-porous before use.<br>
On top of the visualisation film 10 is provided a membrane 11, which is bigger than the film 10 and thus overlaps the visualisation film 10 and connects at its edges onto the first adhesive film 8, Nonethe/ess, the membrane 11 is smaller than the first adhesive film 8 so that the edges 12 of the first adhesive film 8 extend outwardly from the membrane 11. The membrane 11 is opaque and is preferably white in colour. It contains a plurality of pores (not shown). The pores render the membrane selective of the molecules which may pass through it, More specifically, molecules having a molecular weight of above a threshold size of 500 daltons cannot pass through the membrane 11, but molecules having a molecular weight of less than 500 daltons may pass through the membrane. In alternative embodiments, the threshold size is greater than 500Da and may, for example be 1kDa or 5kDa.<br>
The second leaf 4 has a reaction pad 13 located in its centre. The reaction pad 13 is located on the second leaf 4 facing the visualisation pad 7 of the first leaf 3. Covering the reaction zone 13 is a removable foil wrapper (not shown). Referring now to FIGURE 3B, the reaction pad 13 will be described in further detail.<br>
The reaction pad 13 comprises, attached to the second leaf 4, a second adhesive film 14. On top of the adhesive film 14 (although of a smaller size than the adhesive film 14) is provided an absorbent sump 15. On top of the absorbent pad 15 is provided a reaction film 16 made from polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and having impregnated into it the synthetic peptide BANA and a sample dispersion material. The sample dispersion material is a fabric which facilitates the lateral movement of the sample on the reaction film 16 by breaking up the surface of the reaction film 16 and forming channels in it through which the sample can be conducted. The reaction film 16 is of the same size as the visualisation film 10 and is thus smaller than the<br><br>
9<br>
absorbent sump 15 such that the edges 17 of the second adhesive film 14 extend outwardly of the reaction film 16.<br>
In order to use the enzyme detection product 1, the book 2 is opened to separate the first and second leaves 3,4 and the protective films (not shown) covering the visualisation pad 7 and the reaction pad 13 are removed. The sample to be tested (e.g. blood) is deposited on the reaction film 16. Any run-off from the sample is absorbed by the sump 15. The first and second leaves 3,4 of the book 2 are pressed together after an appropriate reaction time (e.g. 60 seconds), such that the edges 12 of the first adhesive film 8 meet the edges 17 of the second adhesive film 14 and cause adhesion between the first and second feaves 3,4. The adhesion of the first and second leaves 3,4 to each other seals the sample within the book 2, which thus hygienicaliy contains the sample.<br>
It is to be noted that, as soon as the sample is placed upon the reaction film 16, any protease enzyme active in the sample will begin hydroJysing the BANA peptide and releasing the napthylamine moiety even before the leaves 3,4 are brought together. The napthylamine moiety is small enough to pass through the membrane 11 and onto the reaction film 10. Other components of the sample which have a molecular weight bigger than the threshold size of 500 daitons are unable to pass through the membrane 11.<br>
When the napthylamine moiety reaches the visualisation film 10, the DMAC and napthylamine condense and change colour to red/pink (see Figure 1). The visualisation film 10 is visible through the first and second apertures 6,9 in the first leaf 3 and the first adhesive film 8 and thus an observer may see the colour change that takes place. Because the membrane 11 is preferably white in colour, opaque and forms a background to the visualisation film 10, it assists an observer in making an unbiased assessment of the colour change, regardless of sample-derived interfering colour. The colour change is indicative of the presence of a protease enzyme in the sample. The degree of colour change (hue, saturation and absorbance) and the rate of colour change (although not necessarily both) are dependent on the enzyme concentration in the sample and reaction t/me.<br><br>
10<br>
In a sample without protease activity, the napthylamine moiety is not released from the reaction film 16, so when the two leaves 3,4 of the book 1 are brought into contact, the DMAC compound reacts with HCl present in the visualisation film 10 in the   presence   of  the   fluid   sample   to   produce   a   yellow  coloured   product.<br>
In an alternative embodiment of the invention, a transparent slide or window is attached to the first leaf 3, covering the first aperture 6, on the opposite side of the first leaf 3 from the first adhesive film 8. The transparent slide permits viewing of the visualisation film 10, but does not permit ingress of contaminants or egress of the sample.<br>
In alternative embodiments, the reaction film 16 and the visualisation film 10 are instead made from other materials which hydrate but do not dissolve in water such as acrylamide, agarose, pululan or carrageenans.<br>
It is to be understood that the present invention is not limited to embodiments in which the reaction film 16 is impregnated with BANA peptide and the visualisation film 10 is impregnated with DMAC. instead, a different set of reactants may be provided on the reaction film 16 and the visualisation film 10, respectively.<br>
For example, DMAC can also be replaced with Fast Garnet (a zinc stabilised diazonium salt) or Fast Black.<br>
Alternatively, the napthyiamide group of BANA can be attached to any amino acid sequence of choice to enable detection of particular proteases. For example in order to test for the presence of the enzyme neutophil elastase BANA is replaced with H-DL-Ala-bNA (Bachem).<br>
Reactants can be designed and synthesised for the detection of the presence of the activity of a particular protease enzyme using napthyiamide or napthyiamide ester labels.<br><br>
11<br>
In alternative embodiments, the reactant casein is provided on the reaction film instead of BANA and the reactant ninhydrin is provided on the visualisation film instead of DMAC.<br>
Indeed, it is not essentia! to the invention that any reactant is provided on the visualisation film 10.   For example, referring to Figure 4, another embodiment is shown schematically.  In Figure 4, like components have the same numbering as in the previous embodiments. Thus, in this embodiment the first and second leaves 3, 4 have a visualisation film 10 covered by a selective membrane 11 and a reaction film 16, respectively.    An aperture 6 is provided in the first leaf 3, above the visualisation film 10.  The reaction film 16 }$ impregnated with a cleavable peptide 18 having a fluorophore group 19 covalently attached to one end 20 thereof and a quencher group 21 attached to the other end 22 of the peptide.  The peptide 18 is sensitive to a protease enzyme, in that a protease enzyme will cleave the peptide 18 separating the first end 20 to which the fluorophore group 19 is conjugated from the search end 22 to which the quencher group 21 is conjugated. The cleaved first end 20 is small enough to pass through the membrane 11, away from the quencher 23 located on the remaining peptide 18, and into the visualisation film 10, where, under incident light 23 it may be observed to fluoresce visible light 24.   However in the absence of the protease in the sample, the peptide is not cleaved and the uncleaved peptide 18 is too big to pass through the membrane 11.  Thus in this embodiment, the visualisation film 10 does not contain a component which reacts with any other component and instead acts as a receptacle and viewing area for the reaction product (i.e. the fluorophore group 21 bound to the first end 20).<br>
An example of a suitable fluorophore group is Mca(7-methoxycoumarin-4-acetyl) and a suitable quencher is Dpa(2,4-Dinitrophenyl). Mca, when not in proximity to Dpa, can be detected fluorometrically at 392nm (excitation 325 nm).<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the reactant in the reaction film 16 is a peptide, the carboxy end of which is linked via an amide bond to a p-Nitroaniiide group. If the peptide is cleaved by a protease enzyme then this releases a p-nitroaniiine group which passes through the membrane 11 and is visible as It is yeflow in colour.<br><br>
12<br>
In another embodiment, BANA is provided on the reaction film 16 but no DMAC is provided in the visualisation film 10. In the presence of a protease enzyme, napthyfamine is released and is visible in the visualisation fi(m under UV light. In a further embodiment, the reactant provided on the reaction film 16 is DL arginine amino methyl L coumarin which aiso releases a fluorescent cleavage product in the presence of a protease enzyme.<br>
Ji is also to be understood that the present invention is not limited to products for the detection of a protease enzyme. In other embodiments, reactants are provided on the reaction film 16 and, optionally also the visualisation film 10, which are responsive to other enzymes in a sample. For example, in one embodiment amylase is detected by the release of glucose from amyiose in the reaction film 16. In this embodiment the visualisation film 10 contains glucose oxidase and an appropriate chromogen, of a type widely known by those skilled in the art.<br><br>

Method (Film preparation)<br>
H-Ala- NA film was prepared as follows; discs of gauze were cut to fit inside the base of a standard 18cm microbiological Petri dish. Further, 20mgs of H-Afa- NA was weighed out and added to a universal bottle with 1ml of DMSO to dissolve. The following reagents were added to the dissolved substrate; 1.5mls of tris buffer, 100,<br><br><br>
14<br>
of Brij 35 and 7.5mls of 5% PVA. The tube was gently inverted to facilitate mixing of the components before pouring the suspension into the Petri dish to cover the gauze. The open dish was placed in a fume hood to dry at ambient temperature for approximately 20 hours.<br>
DMAC films were prepared as follows; 15mgs of DMAC weighed out and added to a universal with 1.5mJs of MeOH to dissolve. 3.75mls of HCL was added followed by 2.25m(s of deionised water and 7.5mls of 5% PVA. The components were mixed by inverting the tube prior to pouring into a clean empty Petri dish. The film was dried at ambient temperature for approximately 20 hours in a fume hood.<br>
Method fdevice assembly)<br>
The cartridge paper was cut into rectangles of approximately 10x 5cm, these were folded in half and the centre point was marked with a pencil on the front cover. A circular punch was used to cut a aperture approximately 12mm diameter in the front cover of the booklets. The hole was then used to mark the central location on the inside of the opposing (eaf of the construction.<br>
Pieces of double sided tape were applied to the inner left and right hand sides. Film (described above) was cut with circular punches; the H-Aia-j NA was cut with the 12mm diameter punch and applied to the inner right hand side sticky tape to give the sample application area. DMAC film was cut with a slightly larger punch approximately 15mm diameter and secured on the double sided tape on the inner ieft hand side to cover the aperture.<br>
Enzyme assay<br>
Porcine pancreatic elastase (Sigma) was prepared to give approximately 20 mg/mf in Tris buffer pH 8.<br>
Two devices were run, an enzyme negative sample was applied to device 1 and elastase positive sample was applied to second device. The devices were run consecutively by applying 40ul of sample to the substrate pad (H-Ala- NA) and incubating for 10 minutes at room temperature.   After the. incubation period the<br><br>
15<br>
device was closed so that the DMAC film contacted the substrate pad and remained closed by the double sided tape.<br>
The colour development was monitored by placing the device viewing window down onto a basic colourimeter. Readings were taken once per second over a total of 5 minutes. The resulting data was compared for Hue (H) and Saturation (S) by using the following equation: 1/H x S. Data can be seen in Figure 5. Stronger colours generated from a device treated with a positive sample (blue line) have a lower numerical value of H and often greater saturation i.e. S value. Negative samples therefore have a lower flatter trend than positive samples (pink line).<br>
The colourimeter is shown in Figure 6. It consists of a white LED light source and colour sensing chip as detector in a black plastic case to remove ambient light. Components or the colourimeter are as follows: opening for reading devices with white LED 30; power supply 31; connection to computer 32; on/off switch 33; and elastic bands to hold devices in place 34. Raw data is converted by embedded software to give Hue (H), Saturation (S) and Intensity (V) values as well as Red (R), Green (G) and Blue (B) to a terminal emulator application. The readings from the device are based on the colour wheel principle.<br>

Discs of cotton gauze were cut to fit the inside of a standard 18cm microbiological petri dish. 20mg of BANA were added to a universal and dissolved in 1 ml of DMSO. The following reagents were added; 1m! of phosphate/EDTA buffer 0.5 ml of deionised water and 7.5mls of 5% PVA. The suspension was mixed gently and then poured onto the gauze and placed in a fume hood to dry at ambient temperature for approximately 20 hours.<br>
Testing<br>
A piece of cartridge paper approximately 12x5cm was prepared with small 5 small holes (approximately 5mm diameter). The holes were each covered with a small square of double sided tape. BANA film was cut to fit the tape on the holes and applied. Prepared papain enzyme standards at 700, 350, 70, 7ugrnl in a deionised water with 0.01% cysteine, diluent. A negative of diluent only was also used. The enzyme and control samples were applied at 20pl per BANA film and incubated at room temperature. The progress of fluorescence development was checked at approximately 5 minute intervals on a UV light box. The results after approximately 14 minutes are given in Figure 7 and are tabulated in Table 1.<br><br><br>

20<br>
Devices materials were prepared and assembled according to our standard methodologies described above. On day 0 {defined as the day materials were dry and ready for device assembly) devices were run to give day 0 results against which stored materials could be compared. Solutions containing papain at concentrations of 500 and 5pgm! and a negative of the diluent only (50ul volumes per test) were applied to devices for an incubation period of 10 minutes. The booklets were closed and the colour development was monitored using the Moiogic booklet device colourimeter which measures the following parameters at 1 second intervals, Hue (H) Saturation (S) Brightness (V) Redness (R) Greenness (G) and Blueness (B).<br>
Devices were stored at 4°C without a dessicant and assayed over the following 28 days with data for day 0 and day 28 listed below.<br>
Data manipulation<br>
The colorimeter output measurement data for Hue and saturation were manipulated using the following equation: 1/HxS. The data are shown in Figures 9 and 10. Figure 9 shows a graph showing replicate data for the papain standards tested on day 0 devices. Figure 10 shows a graph showing replicate data for papain standards tested on day 28.<br><br><br>
21<br>
Table 3 compares the calculated slopes and readings at certain time points.<br>
Table 3<br>
The data illustrates a reduced rate of signal development in the day 28 positive samples. However, the comparison of the averaged data shows little significant change in the final signal values, in the case of positive samples this is achieved in a slightly longer time frame.<br>
Example 4 - Evaluation of selective membranes into Booklet Assay<br>
Using the standard BANA/DMAC format booklet (as described in Example 3) the following 'selective' membranes have been incorporated into the device according to Figure 3A except that the visualisation window 6 was completely sealed with the adhesive film 8 such that here is no aperture 9 to minimise evaporation during substrate incubation.<br>
A wide range of membranes evaluated in Protease Booklet ranging from a 0.22pm pore size filters to a MWCO 3500Da dialysis membrane as listed below.<br>
Millipore Isopore membrane - 0.1 ,25 thick VCTP Millipore MF membrane - 0.2| 150j thick GSPW MilJipore Durapore membrane - 0.22 150j thick GV<br><br>
22<br>
Whatman Nylon membrane - 0.2jjm pore, 150(jm thick<br>
Degussa ceramic composite membranes - type S240 P25 - 25um thick<br>
Dialysis  membranes - Pierce  Snakeskin  prod  # 68035,   MWCO  3,500  and<br>
Spectra/Por cat # 132723, MWCO 3,500<br>
Amicon NMWL membrane - cat # PBCC 04310, NMWL 5,000<br>
Booklets were prepared with each of the membranes as described above and then tested with 0, 50 and 250ug/ml Papain standards using sample volumes of 40JJ1 for the control devices and   for devices incorporating the membrane to ensure<br>
sufficient liquid added to the device to wet all booklet components. Standards were added to the BANA film and incubated for 10 minutes. The booklets were then closed and colour development recorded by capturing digital images over a 30 minute period.<br>
Figure 11 shows digital images of booklets without a selective membrane (control booklets) and with a MWCO 3,500 dialysis membrane following 15 minute incubation. The results are tabulated in Table 4.<br>
Tabfe 4 - Signaf Generation for Booklets incorporating Sefective Membranes<br><br>
Example 5 - Evaluation of a Sink in the Booklet<br>
Various sink formats were tested in the booklet type protease where in all cases the sink was larger than and placed beneath the BANA film which was held onto the sink using double sided tape. Two materials were tested, Fisherbrand QL 100 filter paper and Bibby Sterilin Bench Guard with the second material having a much greater absorbancy and void volume.<br><br>
23<br>
Where the double sided tape is of the same diameter or smaller then the BANA film (12mm diameter or less) - as in Figure 3B - then it was seen that the 'sample' wicked from the sample pad into the sink via the gauze fibres or directly through the PVA film such that the BANA film would be nearly dry after the initial sample incubation which led to uneven and poor signal generation. Figure 12 is a digital image of booklets according to Figure 3B with and without a sink using 40 and 70 sample volume showing effect of liquid removal from Sample Pad and Reduced Signal. The results are tabulated in Table 5.<br>
Table 5 - Signal Generation for Booklets incorporating sink according to Figure 3B<br><br>
Papain Standard	Sample Volume 40ul	Sample Volume 70ul<br><br>
	Control	Sink	Control	Sink<br>
50jjg/ml	++	+	+	+/-<br>
250ug/ml	++++	++	++++	++<br>
When the double sided tape was larger than the BANA film such that there was a minimum of 1 mm excess around the whole BANA film {as shown below) it was found that device coped with sample volumes from 40 to ~200{j\ of sample without excess not being mopped up by the sink. A diagram of such an embodiment is shown in Figure 13. Components of Figure 13 are as follows: DMAC/PVA Film 35; Double Sided Tape 36; BANA/PVA/Gauze Film 37; and sink/sump 38. A digital image of booklets with and without sink tested using 150 sample volume is shown in Figure 14. The results are tabulated in Table 6.<br>
