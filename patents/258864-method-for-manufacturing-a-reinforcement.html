STRUCTURAL ELEMENT, BASIC ELEMENT, HOLDING MEANS AND AUXILLIARY MEANS FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF A REINFORCEMENT,- METHOD FOR CONSTRUCTING SUCH AN AUXILLIARY MEANS<br>
AND METHOD FOR MANUFACTURING A REINFORCEMENT<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The invention relates to a structural element for constructing an auxiliary means for manufacturing a reinforcement. The invention also relates to a basic element from which at least one such structural element can be formed. The invention further relates to a holding means for holding a reinforcement rod. The invention also relates to an auxiliary means for manufacturing a reinforcement. The invention further relates to a method for constructing such an auxiliary means. The invention also relates' to a method for manufacturing a reinforcement,<br>
Background of the invention<br>
In the manufacture of a reinforcement for a concrete<br>
construction a number of reinforcement rods must usually<br>
be connected to each other, using"binding wire or by<br>
means of welding. This can take place in a concrete<br>
formwork, wherein the rods, brought to length and into<br>
shape, are arranged in their correct position and then<br>
mutually connected with binding wire or welded. Many<br>
prefabricated reinforcements or reinforcement parts are<br>
also applied which are manufactured elsewhere and then<br>
placed in the form work. In order to manufacture<br>
prefabricated reinforcements, particularly reinforcement<br>
mesh for floors and walls and reinforcement cages for<br>
pillars, beams and so forth, use is made of auxiliary<br>
means for placing and holding in the correct position<br>
the reinforcement rods for connecting, see for instance<br>
US 6r560,834 or WO 02/064906. Such auxiliary means are<br>
however expensive because they are made to size for only<br>
a single application.	„<br>
When working without such auxiliary means the steel fixer must work with the reinforcement rods -by." hand, • which requires much laborious manipulation and 'made professional skill, wherein errors are easily;'-made in<br><br>
the dimensioning and a precise positioning and orientation of the rods is difficult.<br>
There therefore exists a need for an affordable and more universal auxiliary means for manufacturing a reinforcement, in particular reinforcement cages, with which the reinforcement rods for connecting can be placed and held in simple and precise manner at their correct position and in the correct orientation. The auxiliary means must preferably be suitable for a plurality of rod diameters, rod lengths and reinforcement geometries; varying from a simple flat reinforcement construction to a more complex, three-dimensional reinforcement construction with for instance curved rods, curved surfaces and corners which are not right angles. It must herein be possible to construct the auxiliary means in simple and easy manner and preferably reuse it. for other reinforcements. The object of the present invention is to provide such, an auxiliary means.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The invention provides for this purpose a system comprising a structural element for constructing an auxiliary means for the manufacture of a reinforcement, which auxiliary means comprises a plurality of such structural elements, wherein the structural element is provided with at least one coupling point for coupling the structural element to another structural element. The other structural element can be a similar structural element or a support, element, such as a, for instance wooden, board, table or floor - Using a number of such structural elements an auxiliary means can be constructed for the manufacture of a reinforcement, wherein, the structural elements are mutually coupled. The construction of the auxiliary means can thus take place simply and easily, and can for instance be compared to the construction of a mechanical structure with the universally to known "Meccano" system. After use, the whole can be dismantled again into parts for reuse in the manufacture of another reinforcement.<br><br>
In addition to at least one first type of coupling point for coupling the structural element to at least one similar structural element, the structural element can be provided with at least one second type of coupling point for coupling the structural element to at least one support element. An auxiliary means can thus be constructed making use of one or more support elements such as a for instance wooden, board, table or floor. A second type of coupling point can herein coincide with a first type of coupling point. The same coupling point can then be used for mutual coupling of similar structural elements as well as for murually coupling a structural element and a support element,<br>
A structural element can comprise at least one holding means for holding at least one reinforcement rod. A holding means can be integrated with the structural element or mounted separately thereon„ A structural element can also be provided with a calibration which can be used in the constructing of the auxiliary means and in placing of holding means .<br>
The structural element is preferably provided with at least one mounting point for mourning at least one holding means f:r holding at least one reinforcement rod. A pluralicy of mounting points can herein be arranged at regular mutual distances, Owing to the, preferably standardised, regular mutual distances measuring and precise seoting-out of the holding means and the construction of the whole auxiliary means becomes relatively simple and the risk of dimensioning errors is drasoicciy reduced. A great accuracy can thus be achieved in resor t of the whole apatial construction of the final reinforcement - A mourning point is preferably embodied here such that a holding means can be mounted reieasabiy. This enables mounting and removal in a single, simple operation. A mounting point can for instance comprise a preferably round recess.<br><br>
In addition to mounting points at discrete distances, it is also possible for the holding means to be mounted at random positions on the structural elements, for instance by simply clamping them in the manner of clothes-pegs on a washing line, A structural element can herein be provided with a calibration.<br>
A mounting point can herein be embodied such that a holding means can be mounted in multiple orientations relative to a structural element. The orientation of the holding means relative to the relevant constructing means can thus be freely chosen, and thereby also the angle between a reinforcement rod held fast by the holding means and the relevant constructing means. Reinforcements with rods which do not cross each other at right angles can thus also be manufactured. At least one coupling point can herein coincide with at least one mounting point, A mounting point can thus also be used for mutual coupling cf structural elements.<br>
The system can also comprise a basic element, from which basic element can be formed at least one structural element according to the invention. for instance by cutting, severing and/or bending. Multiple types of structural element can. thus be manufactured from a single type cf basic element. This will be elucidated further in the following detailed description of the invention.<br>
A holding means according to the invention is preferably suitable for holding a plurality of dimensions of reinforcement rod and/or a plurality of reinforcement rods t The holding means hereby become more universally employable and reinforcements with a number of diameters of reinforcement rod, which is the rule rather than the exception, can be manufactured. The required number of types of holding means cari thus also be limited to a minimum. A holding means according to the invention preferably takes a -resilient form, and can be clamped on a structural element, engaging for instance in a recess or in other manner on the structural element. A V-shape<br><br>
xs found to be well suitable for this purpose. A number of exemplary embodiments with provisions for holding reinforcement rods and for mounting a holding means on a structural element are further described and shown in the following detailed description of the invention.<br>
For the manufacture of a reinforcement using an auxiliary means according to the invention, a number of reinforcement rods can according to the invention now be placed and held in desired mutual positions and orientations by means of holding means according to the invention, where after the reinforcement rods are mutually connected, for instance by means of binding wire or by means of welding, to form for instance a reinforcement cage, for instance for a pillar or a beam. A reinforcement can thus be manufactured quickly, relatively simply and precisely.<br>

Derailed description of the invention<br>
Fig, 1 shows a first exemplary embodiment of a<br>
structural element according to the invention 1.<br><br>
Structural element 1 is provided with recesses 2, in this embodiment round holes at regular mutual distances, which form mounting points for arranging holding means 3 for positioning and holding reinforcement rods. The distance between the mounting points is for instance 2.5 cm, which distance can be standardised. Measuring and precise setting-out of holding means 3 hereby becomes relatively simple and the chance of errors is drastically reduced. Structural element 1 is also provided with coupling points, in this embodiment round holes 4 for mutually coupling a plurality of such structural elements 1 to form an auxiliary means according to the invention. The holes for mutual coupling 4 and recesses 2 can also have the same diameter, and even fully coincide. This will of course result in advantages in the production and use of structural element 1•<br>
Fig. 2 shows a part of an auxiliary means according to the invention 5 built up of a number of structural elements 1 and holding means 3 according to the invention. Structural elements 1 are coupled releasably to each other and holding means 3 are mounted releasably at the appropriate locations. A number of reinforcement roas 6 is held in place by means of holding means 3.<br>
Fig, 3 shows a second exemplary embodiment of a structural element according to the invention ". Structural element 1 is again provided with recesses 2, in this embodiment round holes at regular mutual distances in a two-dimensional placing, which once again form mounting points for the arrangement of holding means 3 for positioning and holding reinforcement rods , The disranee between recesses 2 is again for instance 2 ..5 cm. Recesses 2 car. for instance again also be used, to couple the structural element 7 to other structural elements according to the invention or to a support element such as a board, table or floor.<br>
Fig, 4 shows a third exemplary embodiment, of a structural element according to the invention 3 , Structural element 8 again provided with recesses 2,<br><br>
in this embodiment round holes at regular mutual distances in a three-dimensional placing, which once again form mounting points for the arrangement of holding means for positioning and holding reinforcement rods. The distance between recesses 2 is again for instance 2,5 cm. Recesses 2 can for instance again also be used to couple the structural element 3 to other-structural elements according to the invention or to a support element such as a board, table or floor. Such a structural element can be formed, for instance by cutting, severing and/or bending, from a basic element according to the invention. Use is for instance made here of a single type of strip provided with holes. In this embodiment the structural element 8 is formed from such a strip by severing and bending.<br>
Fig. 5 shows six exemplary embodiments (a-f) of a holding means according to the invention„ The shown holding means a-f take a resilient form whereby in simple manner they can be clamped into, and also removed from, a recess 2 provided for this purpose in a structural element according to the invention (1,7,8) . As shown in Fig. 1, the orientation of the holding means relative to the associated structural element can herein be freely chosen, and thereby also the angle between a reinforcement rod held fast by the holding means and the relevant constructing means. Reinforcements with rods which do not cross each other at right angles can thus also be manufactured. Multiple diameters of reinforcement rod can oe held releasabiy due to the V~ shape and the elastic deformability. The holding means hereby becomes more universally employable and reinforcements with a number of diameters of reinforcement rod, which is the rule rather than the exception, can be manufactured, wherein only a single or a very limited number of types of holding means is used.<br>
Recesses 9 can also be arranged in the holding means to enable more precise and simple mounting thereof or a structural element. Additional provisions 10 can. also be<br><br>
arranged for clamping (multiple diameters of) reinforcement rods,<br>
In one embodiment of a holding means according to the invention (not shown) , the holding means can for instance also be suitable for holding a plurality of reinforcement rods.<br>
Fig. 6 finally shows an exemplary embodiment of an auxiliary means 11 according to the invention constructed from a number of structural elements 1 and holding means according to the invention. Structural elements 1 are coupled releasably to each other. The construction of such an auxiliary means 11 can take place quickly and easily and is comparable to the construction of a mechanical structure with the universally known "Meccano" system. After use, auxiliary means 11 can once again be wholly or partially dismantled into parts for reuse in the manufacture of another reinforcement. A reinforcement 12 for a concrete construction can be manufactured by means of such an auxiliary means 11. A more complex three-dimensional reinforcement wrth non-right angles can be manufactured relatively simply, quickly and precisely in accordance with £ method according tc the invention.<br>
The whole spatial geometry of a reinforcement and the separate positioning of each individual rod can be realised better and more accurately according to the invention than with known methods, tools and devices, Smaller and larger series which cannot oe produced by means of a partly or fully automated machine can thus be realized quickly and precisely.<br>
Although elucidated or: The oasis of a limited number of exemplary embodiments, the invention comprises any system wherein an auxiliary means for manufacturing a reinforcement is built up of a number of structural elements according to the invention; thus, in addition to the described and shown "meccano"-like system and the system making use of a number of basic elements<br><br>
