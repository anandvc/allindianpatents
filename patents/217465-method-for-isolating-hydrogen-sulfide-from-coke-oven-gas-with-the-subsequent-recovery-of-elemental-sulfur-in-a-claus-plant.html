				<td>Method for isolating hydrogen sulfide from<br>
coke oven gas with the subsequent recovery of elemental<br>
sulfur in a Claus plant<br>
Specification:<br>
The invention relates to a method for isolating hydrogen sulfide<br>
from coke oven gas with subsequent recovery of elemental sulfur<br>
in a Claus plant, in which the hydrogen sulfide is removed from<br>
che coke oven gas by means of gas scrubbing, using an absorption<br>
liquid, the charged absorption liquid is regenerated and, in<br>
this connection, hydrogen sulfide that accumulates in<br>
concentrated form is passed to the Claus plant,<br>
wherein the hydrogen sulfide is reacted with oxygen in the<br>
air, in a Claus boiler of the Claus plant, forming<br>
elemental sulfur,<br>
wherein the process gas that leaves the Claus boiler is<br>
cooled to the temperature required for condensation of the<br>
sulfur, in a waste heat boiler, heated after the sulfur has<br>
been precipitated, and passed to a reaction oven of the<br>
Claus plant, in which sulfur compounds are converted to<br>
elemental sulfur on a catalyst, and<br>
wherein the process gas that leaves the reaction oven is<br>
cooled to a temperature required for condensation of the<br>
sulfur, and the condensed sulfur is precipitated.<br>
Coke oven gas contains hydrogen sulfide, which must be removed<br>
before use in a gas scrubber. In the regeneration of the<br>
charged absorption liquid used for gas scrubbing/ hydrogen<br>
sulfide occurs in concentrated form, and is converted to<br>
elemental sulfur in a subsequent Claus plant. The core piece of<br>
the Claus plant is a boiler having a combustion chamber, where<br>
hydrogen sulfide is converted to elemental sulfur with oxygen,<br>
at high temperatures of more than 800°0. The basic reaction of<br>
the process is<br>
The reaction is greatly exothermic and therefore very<br>
temperature-dependent. In accordance with the reaction<br>
equilibrium, about 70% of the hydrogen sulfide converts to<br>
elemental sulfur, which is precipitated by means of cooling of<br>
the process gas in a subsequent waste heat boiler, by means of<br>
condensation. In subsequent reaction ovens, which are also<br>
referred to as catalyst stages, residual contents of hydrogen<br>
sulfide and sulfur dioxide are converted to sulfur on catalysts,<br>
in accordance with the reaction equation<br>
The Claus reactors are operated at temperatures below 350°C.<br>
Within the framework of the known measures, the Claus plant is<br>
always configured with at least two Claus reactors, switched in<br>
series and operated at different temperatures, in order to<br>
achieve high sulfur yields. Between the Claus reactors switched<br>
in series, an intermediate cooling is provided, for the<br>
precipitation of elemental sulfur. A Claus plant having the<br>
structure described and having the purpose of use indicated is<br>
described in Ullmanns Encyklopadie der technischen Chemie<br>
(Ullmann"s encyclopedia of Technical Chemistry), Vol. 21, pages<br>
8 to 13.<br>
A Claus plant consisting of a Claus boiler and cwo subsequent<br>
cacalyst stages with intermediate cooling systems is complicated<br>
in terms of apparatus. The invention is based on the task of<br>
reducing the apparatus expenditure by means of modifying the<br>
method.<br>
Proceeding from the method described initially, the task is<br>
accomplished according to the invention, in that the Claus<br>
plant is operated with only a single reaction oven, and that a<br>
working temperature of less than 250°C is set in this oven, and<br>
that the process gas that leaves the reaction oven, after<br>
precipitation of the condensed sulfur, is passed back into the<br>
coke oven gas to be cleaned, ahead of the gas scrubbing, with a<br>
residual content of hydrogen sulfide that was not converted in<br>
the reaction oven. Preferably, the reaction oven is operated in<br>
a temperature range between 200°C and 230°C.<br>
According to the invention, the Claus plant is configured only<br>
with a Claus boiler and a single subsequent catalyst stage,<br>
which is operated at a lower temperature, in comparison with the<br>
state of the art. In this connection, it is accepted that the<br>
converted part of H2S, wich reference to the hydrogen sulfide<br>
amount passed to the Claus plant, is less than in the state of<br>
the art, when using a Claue plant having two or more catalyst<br>
stages. According to the invention, it was recognized, when<br>
considering the process as a whole, that higher sulfur contents<br>
in the waste gas of the Claus plant are tolerable if the waste<br>
gas is passed back to the coke oven gas to be cleaned, and<br>
subjected to gas scrubbing together with it. The gas scrubbing<br>
is designed in such a manner that a higher content of. hydrogen<br>
sulfide in the coke oven gas has no effect on the hydrogen<br>
sulfide content in the cleaned gas. In this regard, the gas<br>
scrubbing makes a second or third catalyst stage of the Claus<br>
plant superfluous. By means of the method according to the<br>
invention, the Claus plant can be configured in very simple<br>
manner, in terms of System technology. The control technology<br>
side of the Claus plant is also significantly simplified.<br>
Further embodiments of the method according to the invention are<br>
described in the dependent claims 3 to 6, and are explained in<br>
the following, using an exemplary embodiment. The figures<br>
schematically show<br>
Fig. l a greatly simplified block schematic of the method<br>
according to the invention,<br>
Pig. 2 a Claus plant chat is used within the scope of the<br>
method according to the invention.<br>
According to the method shown in Fig. l in the form of a block<br>
schematic, hydrogen sulfide is separated from coke oven gas COG<br>
and converted to elemental sulfur s in a subsequent Claus plant.<br>
The hydrogen sulfide is removed from coke oven gas by means of<br>
gas scrubbing 1 using an absorption liquid. The charged<br>
absorption liquid 2 is regenerated in a stage 3. In this<br>
connection, hydrogen sulfide occurs in concentrated form, in the<br>
form of vapor, which is passed to a Claus plant 4. In the Claus<br>
plant 4, hydrogen sulfide is converted to elemental sulfur S,<br>
which is drawn off in liquid form. Furthermore, a process gas 5<br>
occurs, which contains a non-reacted residual content of<br>
hydrogen sulride and is passed back to the coke oven gas COG to<br>
be cleaned, ahead of the gas scrubbing l.<br>
The structure of the Claus plane 4 is shown in Fig. 2. The<br>
fundamental structure of this plant includes a Claus boiler 6, a<br>
waste heat boiler 7, as well as a reaction oven 8 having a<br>
catalyst bulk material 9. An application stream 10 that<br>
contains hydrogen sulfide is fed into a combustion chamber 13 of<br>
the Claus boiler 6, together with air 11 and heating gas 12, and<br>
converted at temperatures of approximately 1200°C, in an<br>
exothermic reaction, forming elemental sulfur. The process gas<br>
that leaves the Claua boiler 6 is cooled to a temperature of<br>
less than 170°C, which is required for condensation of the<br>
sulfur, in the waste heat boiler 7. Elemental sulfur S is<br>
condensed and precipitated. After precipitation of the sulfur,<br>
the process gas 14 is heated, by mixing in a partial stream 15<br>
that is taken from the Claus boiler 6, and passed to the<br>
reaction oven 8 of the Claus plant. In the reaction oven 8,<br>
hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide are converted to elemental<br>
sulfur on catalycts 16. The reaction oven 8 is operated at a<br>
working temperature of less than 250°C, preferably in a<br>
temperature range between 200°C and 230°C.<br>
From Fig. 2, it is evident that the Claus plant 4 is configured<br>
with only a single reaction oven 8. The process gas that leaves<br>
the reaction oven 8 is cooled to a temperature required for<br>
condensation of the sulfur. After precipitation of the<br>
condensed sulfur, the process gas 5, which still contains a<br>
residual content of hydrogen sulfide, is passed back into the<br>
coke oven gas COG to be cleaned, ahead of the gas scrubbing 1.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the method according co<br>
the invention, the Claus plant 4 is operated in such a manner<br>
that 80 to 85% of the hydrogen sulfide is converted to elemental<br>
sulfur and drawn off as a condensate.<br>
A boiler lined with a refractory material, lying horizontally,<br>
is used as the Claus boiler 6, which has a combustion chamber 13<br>
and a catalyst chamber having a catalyst bulk material 9, which<br>
follows horizontally and is delimited on both sides by gas-<br>
permeable checker bricks 17.<br>
In the waste heat boiler 7, both the gas stream that exits from<br>
the Claus boiler 6, having a temperature of about 1200°C, and<br>
the process gas stream that exits from the reaction oven 8,<br>
having a temperature of less than 250°C, are cooled to a<br>
temperature below the condensation temperature of elemental<br>
sulfur. In this connection, a low-tension steam 18 is generated.<br>
The waste heat boi1er 7 hae a first tube bundle 19 composed, of<br>
heat exchanger tubes, through which the process gas that exits<br>
from the Claus boiler 6 flows. The waste heat boiler 7<br>
furthermore has a second tube bundle 20 composed of heat<br>
exchanger tubes, through which the process gas that exits from<br>
the reaction oven 8 flows. The tube bundles 19, 20 are disposed<br>
in a common steam generator chamber. Elemental sulfur already<br>
condenses in the waste heat boiler 7 and is drawn off from the<br>
waste heat boiler 7 and subsequent precipitators 21 in liquid<br>
form.<br>
To heat the process gas 14 passed to the reaction oven 8, a<br>
partial stream 15 is branched out of the Claus boiler. The<br>
branch line is connected to the circumference of a downstream-<br>
side chamber 22 of the Claus boiler 6, which chamber is lined<br>
with refractory material, and opens into the process gas line<br>
that is adjacent to the boiler. In the orifice region of the<br>
branch line, a valve body is disposed in adjustable manner, with<br>
which the amount flow of the gas stream that exits from the<br>
branch line can be. regulated. The valve body and a setting<br>
device assigned to the valve body are cooled by the process gas<br>
14 that is passed through the process gas line, so that usual<br>
metallic components can be used for the valve body.<br>
