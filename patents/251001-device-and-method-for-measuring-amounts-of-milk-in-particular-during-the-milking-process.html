				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a device and a method for measuring the amounts of milk in<br>
particular during the milking process. The invention is generally suitable for determining<br>
the quantity of milk yield from cows, ewes, goats, buffaloes, llamas, camels, dromedaries,<br>
or of other lactating mammals and will be described below with reference to the milking<br>
of e.g. cows.<br>
In addition the invention may be used in other areas of application where the measuring of<br>
quantities or mass flows of foamy or foam-forming liquids is concerned such as measuring<br>
the mass flow of beers, soft drinks, fruit juices, or other similar food products, as well as<br>
foaming or foamy technical fluids, such as electroplating solutions.<br>
Information about the current milk flow is important for controlling the milking process so<br>
as to adjust parameters during milking e.g. for specifying the transition from the<br>
stimulating phase to the main milking phase, or the removal time. Although a high<br>
accuracy level is usually not required, it is desirable.<br>
Milk yield measuring is significant for drawing conclusions on the performance of the<br>
individual cows. It is useful to have accuracies meet the requirements of ICAR since this<br>
would eliminate the need of regular separate milk yield measuring. Although the<br>
requirements for an ICAR (International Committee for Animal Recording) approval<br>
depend on the animal variety and other parameters, they are generally high. The allowable<br>
error for cows and for milk yields larger than 10 kg, is 2 percent maximum at a maximum<br>
standard deviation of 2.5 %. As a rule, however, a general assessment of performance or<br>
controlling the milking process does not require this level of accuracy.<br>
One advantage of measuring the amount of milk or the mass flow of milk is that in<br>
individual cases, the shape of the milk curve during milking or the total milk yield will<br>
allow to draw conclusions on the state of health of the animal.<br>
One problem encountered in milk flow measuring is that milk is a heavily foaming fluid.<br>
Foam formation during milking is further intensified by the currently employed milking<br>
techniques since as a rule, air is periodically or continually allowed to enter into the milk<br>
collection piece and/or the teat cups during milking to discharge the milk. Although the<br>
volume of air intake per unit time may vary, it will as a rule be approximately 8 liters of<br>
air /minute or even higher. Assuming a maximum milk flow e.g. for cows of<br>
approximately 10 or 12 liters of milk per minute in the main milking phase, the air volume<br>
to be discharged will roughly be at least approximately 25 %, in particular at least 40 % or<br>
even 50 % of the volume flow of milk yield and air intake. And this quite considerable<br>
portion is already present during the maximum milk flow phase. Near the end of milking<br>
the proportion of air to be discharged will rise even higher due to the decreasing milk<br>
flow. Added to this there is the proportion of air entering at the teat cup due to less than<br>
tight sealing between the liner and the teat. This proportion can also be roughly estimated<br>
at e.g. 10 liters of air per minute. The considerable proportion of air in the air-fluid<br>
mixtures to be discharged may thus cause not only individual foam bubbles but substantial<br>
formation of foam which considerably impairs in-flow milk yield measurement.<br>
Since the proportion of foam does not readily permit conclusions on mass from the<br>
volume, the accuracy of milk yield measuring methods through volumetric methods has its<br>
limits. Both the proportion of air in the fluid and the bubble size in the foam are not<br>
always even but they depend on a plurality of factors. These factors include, the milk<br>
temperature, the milk flow rate, the position and layout of the milk hoses, the type of<br>
milking unit, the type of teat liner, the milk hose diameter, the type of milking installation,<br>
the vacuum level and the pulse rate during milking, air leakages or air infiltration, the<br>
current state of health of the udder, individual differences between cows e.g. due to the<br>
lactation stage or the race of the cow, and due to differences in kind and quantity of<br>
feeding, etc.<br>
Another problem in measuring the milk yield flow is caused by the periodic milk flow.<br>
Unlike measuring volumetric flow in many other applications, milk is drawn periodically.<br>
The pulse space and thus also the teat space in the teat cup is subjected to a periodic<br>
vacuum such that milk will flow out of the teat approximately at the pulsation rate. The<br>
pulse rate typically lies between approximately 30 and 90 at e.g. 60 cycles per minute.<br>
Given four teats and identical rates with all of the teats, there will be a milk flow having<br>
approximately 60 milk flow pulses per minute. Where the udder halves or the four teats<br>
e.g. of a cow are selected variably, the high frequency proportion of the milk flow may<br>
increase to reach approximately 240 strokes per minute at a pulse rate of 60. Milk is often<br>
conveyed through the milk hoses in clusters such that short phases at maximum milk flow<br>
alternate with short phases at minimum milk flow. Determining the actual milk flow is<br>
difficult under these conditions.<br>
Due to these influences, measuring a milk flow is found to be difficult since the nature and<br>
composition of the foam phase on the one hand and on the other hand also the composition<br>
and quality of the liquid phase within one milking process and between milking processes<br>
are subject to fluctuations. For example the electrical conductivity of the fluid and the<br>
proportion of the foam phase may vary continually since e.g. the fat content may change<br>
during milking which will cause fluctuations in terms of the electrical conductivity and the<br>
optical properties of the milk. Measuring methods based on measuring these parameters<br>
may thus be subjected to not inconsiderable inaccuracies.<br>
DE 30 20 161 C2 discloses a device for milk yield measuring where milk is periodically<br>
dammed in a chamber until it is filled to then discharge the content of the chamber. By<br>
way of the time required for filling and the volume contained in the chamber the total<br>
amount of milk can be summed up and the current milk flow assessed. The achievable<br>
accuracy of such measuring devices is high. Owing to the principle, however, periodically<br>
operating measuring methods do not allow precise determination of the current milk flow<br>
in particular with slight milk flows. Exact information on the current milk flow is,<br>
however, helpful at the start of milking and in particular at the end of milking for adjusting<br>
the process parameters and for specifying the best time of removal. In-flow measuring<br>
may provide better control of the removal process since continuous measuring enables<br>
early recognition of the best time for removal.<br>
EP 0 536 080 A2 discloses in-flow milk yield measuring wherein the milk is conveyed<br>
through flow channels, and transmission of an infrared light beam through the milk is<br>
measured and analyzed. The temporarily dampened or dimmed infrared light beam<br>
through the channel as milk is flowing through allows to draw conclusions on the<br>
momentary mass flow of milk through said channel. One drawback of optical measuring is<br>
for example that small and large foam bubbles may scatter the light beam employed for<br>
measuring such that in the presence of a foam portion, not enough light can be measured<br>
in transmission or reflection measuring so as to result in measuring errors.<br>
DE 37 37 607 A1 discloses another method and a device for in-flow milk yield measuring.<br>
A plurality of electrodes positioned one above the other is provided to firstly determine the<br>
electrical impedance or electrical conductivity of the liquid and air mixture on the<br>
respective levels by means of the electrodes. In the bottom region, a reference conductance<br>
of the liquid currently passing is measured. On the basis of each height value the stepped<br>
level profile of the specific impedance is calculated by means of the reference<br>
conductance. The flow velocity of the draining off liquid is known for known impedance<br>
profiles from calibration measuring such that the stepped level profile permits conclusions<br>
on the flowing mass of the milk.<br>
A device operating on this principle has become known wherein a plurality of<br>
approximately 60 electrodes is positioned one above the other. To cover a wide range of<br>
heights and thus of measuring, the electrodes are spaced apart from one another in the<br>
vertical direction by a specific electrode-free distance. The actual condition at measuring<br>
cannot be detected in said electrode-free area. Given a distance of e.g. 1.5 mm, this may<br>
mean a measuring error of nearly 1.5 mm, which with slight milk flows at low fill heights<br>
of a few millimeters may result in correspondingly large measuring errors.<br>
Due to this principle, this known device is very complex in terms of mechanics and<br>
electronics since a large number of electrodes must be installed and individually selected<br>
electrically. It is another disadvantage that despite the high number of employed electrodes<br>
the milk flow is only evaluated in steps, thus causing inaccuracies.<br>
/It is therefore still a major challenge to integrate a sensor in the milk flow offering<br>
satisfactory measuring accuracy at a reasonable price for farmers.<br>
It is therefore the object of the present invention to provide a device and a method for<br>
determining the quantity or the mass flow in particular of a foaming liquid, so as to<br>
provide adequate measuring accuracy with simple means.<br><br>
This object is fulfilled according to the invention by the device for measuring a mass flow<br>
in particular of a foaming liquid having the features of claim 1, by a configuration<br>
according to claim 25 and claim 26, and the method having the features of claim 31.<br>
Advantageous specific embodiments are the subjects of the subclaims.<br>
The device according to the invention is in particular suitable for measuring the mass flow<br>
in particular of a foaming liquid. The device comprises at least one measuring device. The<br>
measuring device comprises at least two electrodes and at least one electrical means for<br>
generating an electrical magnitude, and an analysis means. The electrical means is<br>
connected substantially parallel to the first electrode, and the second electrode is<br>
electrically connected with the first electrode via the analysis means. Preferably the<br>
analysis means is electrically mounted between the first and the second electrode. The<br>
analysis means is in particular electrically connected with the first electrode on one side,<br>
and on the other side electrically connected with the second electrode. The electrical<br>
means is connected in particular with two spaced-apart spots on the first electrode such<br>
that it is connected in parallel to the first electrode.<br>
The invention has many advantages. The invention is in particular suitable for determining<br>
the quantity of a foamy and/or foam-producing liquid such as milk.<br>
The device according to the invention is easy to clean, to disinfect and to maintain since it<br>
does not require any moving parts. The structure of the measuring housing may be very<br>
simple.<br>
Preferably the fluid flow is measured in-flow in particular during the milking process. To<br>
this end, a measuring section is preferably provided at the device.<br>
An additional advantage is the possibility which the inventive device offers, of in-flow<br>
measuring the intermittent milk yield with high precision during milking. The pulsating<br>
milk flow is highly demanding in respect of the measuring principle which demands are<br>
fulfilled to a high degree in the present case.<br>
It is another significant advantage of the device according to the invention and the specific<br>
embodiments described above that the entire quantity of flowing fluid will always be<br>
measured including the foam portion. For example when the milk flow lessens and thus<br>
the milk at the electrodes drains off more slowly due to the surface tension (e.g. due to the<br>
fat content), the device according to the invention is still capable of correctly measuring<br>
the milk quantity or the milk flow since what is measured is the density, not the fill height<br>
or the volume.<br>
With a device according to DE 37 37 607 A1 described above, however, the fill height<br>
measured may be higher than it actually is with the milk draining off the electrodes slower<br>
which will create a measuring error. An apparent milk flow is measured where in fact a<br>
smaller amount is present. This milk "adherence" is very frequent in milking since the<br>
milk flows in surges such that a lessening milk flow can occur in every pulse cycle.<br>
With the device according to the invention adhering forces of the fluid at the sensor have<br>
hardly any influence since the density is measured, not the fill height.<br>
It is another significant advantage of the invention in all of the embodiments that<br>
continuous measuring is possible, not related to the number of analysis electrodes as is the<br>
case with a system according to DE 37 37 607 A1. Namely, the resolution capabilities of<br>
the known devices is reduced further with the measuring area not being utilized to the full.<br>
To achieve a satisfactory in-flow measuring accuracy, these devices must provide an<br>
adequately large flow-through height such that the measuring housing must be configured<br>
comparatively large or high enough. This is not required with the device according to the<br>
invention since the resolution generally is not related to the structural configuration of the<br>
electrodes. A device according to the invention can thus be optimally adjusted to the milk<br>
flow of a specific species (e.g. cows or ewes), so as to achieve optimal resolution for said<br>
species both for maximum milk flows and for minimum milk flows.<br>
Preferably the measuring device is positioned in a measuring section that may be provided<br>
in a housing of the device. The housing preferably comprises at least one inlet and at least<br>
one outlet. Between the inlet and the outlet there is provided a measuring section in which<br>
the liquid to be measured is conveyed e.g. in a channel.<br>
In measuring, the height of the flowing liquid is captured not in steps but continuously.<br>
Measuring accuracy can thus be enhanced.<br>
According to the invention it is not the fill height that is measured but an integral density<br>
profile. Due to the principle applied, individual calibration for each cow or for the race of<br>
the cows is not required.<br>
The mass flow is derived from the density profile. The calibration parameters used are<br>
those including the influences specific to the devices. For example one takes into account<br>
which flow velocity will ensue from which density profile.<br>
The response time of the device is determined by the response time of the electronic<br>
analysis components which generally allows fast milk flow measuring.<br>
The inventive measuring principle is realized in all of the embodiments preferably by<br>
potential measurement in that potentiometric measuring is carried out. To one electrode,<br>
e.g. the first electrode, a potential is applied which drops nearly linearly along the<br>
electrode, at least when cross-section and material properties along the electrode are<br>
constant.<br>
The first electrode in particular is spatially considerably extended and it is in particular<br>
elongated in shape. The first electrode considerably extends in particular perpendicular to<br>
the direction of flow.<br>
In measuring, the first electrode is wetted with the foaming liquid up to a specific height.<br>
Wetting occurs both with the liquid phase and a possibly present foam phase. Therefore, a<br>
potential curve is introduced into the fluid related to the height and the quality of wetting.<br>
The electrical means is connected in particular with two spaced-apart spots on the first<br>
electrode such that it is connected in parallel to the first electrode. The two spaced-apart<br>
spots on the first electrode may be positioned in particular at two ends, in particular at the<br>
two ends of the first electrode.<br>
The second electrode preferably also extends spatially and it is in particular elongated in<br>
shape, or else it may be configured as a spot electrode or a contact electrode to the fluid to<br>
be measured.<br>
Now, the second electrode is positioned at a specific (horizontal) distance from the first<br>
electrode. The foaming liquid between the two electrodes overall forms an impedance.<br>
The level of impedance is integrally formed by the fluid between the electrodes. The<br>
higher the proportion of liquid, the smaller the impedance, and the larger the foam<br>
proportion present in the volume between the two electrodes, the larger the impedance.<br>
The impedance is also related to the horizontal distance.<br>
Where the fluid is layered e.g. between the two electrodes such that a liquid layer is<br>
present at the bottom and a foam layer on top, the total impedance is an integral<br>
composition of both. In this simplified case, the liquid and foam portions can be<br>
approximately considered as a connection in parallel. Although the specific impedance of<br>
the foam portion will be considerably higher than the specific impedance of the liquid<br>
portion, both portions will contribute to the total impedance. Therefore the total<br>
impedance is representative of the density between the electrodes.<br>
Preferably, however, what is measured is not the impedance between the electrodes but the<br>
potential. The potential is introduced into the fluid to be measured by the first electrode.<br>
Where both electrodes are covered in pure liquid from bottom to top, the first electrode<br>
will apply a gliding potential between e.g. 0 and 60 mV to the liquid. A locally<br>
homogeneous liquid between the electrodes will thus yield the integral mean value of 30<br>
mV between the two electrodes. With both electrodes wetted up to half their heights, a<br>
potential gliding above the height of the electrode between 0 and 30 mV is applied. Thus,<br>
an integral potential of 15 mV will be measured between the two electrodes.<br>
Where a layered fluid is present, the integral measuring will cause the foam portion to be<br>
directly measured as well. Due to the principle applied, the measuring method allows<br>
measuring of foam-containing liquids. The draining-off characteristics known from<br>
calibration allows to infer the flowing quantity of fluid from the integrally measured<br>
density.<br>
Since the measuring principle in this configuration is substantially based on measuring an<br>
(electrical) potential, an electrical power flow through the fluid which would be significant<br>
in terms of the animal physiology is avoided. Differently therefrom, the known prior art<br>
devices and methods perform measurements of the electrical or optical impedance.<br>
The electrodes are configured such that the source resistance is considerably lower than<br>
that in the liquid phase of the measured fluid. This will ensure a "linear" potential curve<br>
above the height of the first electrode, independently from the fill height of the liquid<br>
phase or the foam portion.<br>
It is expedient to provide the impedance between the first and the second end of each<br>
electrode considerably smaller than the impedance between the electrodes at maximum<br>
level of the liquid phase of the fluid. This will ensure that the electric potential forming<br>
around the electrode is not significantly influenced by the fluid. The measuring accuracy is<br>
thus enhanced. For example an electrode having an electrical impedance of e.g. 100<br>
milliohms may be employed.<br>
As stated above, preferred specific embodiments of all of the above described<br>
configurations include as the preferred electrical means a voltage source or a voltage<br>
generating means. The electrical magnitude applied in parallel to the first electrode will<br>
then be electrical voltage. By means of the voltage source, an electrical voltage is applied<br>
between the first end and the second end of the first electrode. Preferably the analysis<br>
means comprises a voltage measuring means.<br>
It is advantageous that for measuring, the voltage source applies a voltage in the range of<br>
millivolts, in particular in a range up to approximately 100 mV, preferably values up to<br>
approximately 5 mV, 10 mV, 20 mV, 30 mV, 40 mV, 50 mV, or 60 mV.<br>
Preferably the voltage source generates an alternating voltage to protect the electrodes<br>
from wear, and to prevent electrolytical residue which might cause errors in the measuring<br>
results. The frequencies of the alternating voltage preset by the voltage source will be in<br><br>
an adequate range. A suitable frequency is e.g. 1 kHz but other frequencies are also<br>
conceivable.<br>
The voltage measuring means preferably comprises a high internal resistance as is usual<br>
for voltage measuring means. Preferably the internal resistance is considerably larger than<br>
the electrical impedance typical of the examined liquid between the first and the second<br>
electrode at minimum liquid level.<br>
Measuring is also conceivable where instead of the voltage source, a (constant) power<br>
source is used wherein a power sensor is provided instead of the voltage sensor, the<br>
electrical magnitude being the electric current.<br>
With this configuration it should be noted that impedance will change with temperature.<br>
This means that a constant power source must compensate for any varying drops in<br>
voltage. Preferably a temperature sensor is provided to capture the temperature of the<br>
flowing liquid or of the electrode.<br>
The device according to the invention achieves high reliability since no wearing parts and<br>
no moving parts are present. A particularly high measuring accuracy is preferably aimed<br>
for to obtain the approval of the milk control associations or of ICAR. The device<br>
according to the invention thus allows precise measurements of the flow. Any investments<br>
required in terms of machinery or finances can be saved later on in terms of time and<br>
money for regular milk yield checks.<br>
The measuring signal is preferably captured in specific, predetermined or selectable time<br>
intervals such that quasi continuous measuring will be present.<br>
It is furthermore preferred that the structure and quality of the device is such as to achieve<br>
a high measuring rate. Preferably the measuring rate is high enough to enable adequate<br>
speed for measuring and processing data even with high milk flows of e.g. 10 or 121/min.<br>
The measuring principle allows accurately measuring the mass flow in a wide measuring<br>
range from small to large flows without having to calibrate the actually measured fluid<br>
The accuracy of measuring is not related to the conductivity of the liquid if only a<br>
minimum conductivity is present which is given as a rule even for simply distilled water<br>
and thus all the more for tap or well water, milk, etc. Thus the conductivity of milk,<br>
common tap water and other liquids is in a range well suited for measuring.<br>
Systematic variations in the optical, electrical, or physical fluid properties during the<br>
measuring process are inherently taken into account. For example, variations in<br>
conductance during milking between 3000 and 6000 µS/cm will not adversely affect the<br>
measuring result although the conductance has changed by a factor of 2. It is not required<br>
to continually perform calibration or compensation for the fluid conductance.<br>
Due to the measuring principle, measurement will be largely independent from the liquid<br>
conductance (while being = 1 µS/cm), from temperature and from the pressure in the<br>
measuring vessel. Generally speaking, the measuring principle is conceivable also for<br>
small and minute conductivities of the analyzed fluids. It should be considered that simply<br>
distilled water has a conductance e.g. of 2 µS/cm, tap water, a value of approximately 20<br>
to 500 µS/cm and milk, in the range of approximately 2000 to 8000 µS/cm. All of these<br>
conductance values allow reliable measuring.<br>
This offers the advantage that for the common, regular checking of the measuring device<br>
at the farm e.g. clear water may be used as the testing medium. Unlike other, conventional<br>
milk yield measuring devices, the device according to the invention does not require any<br>
special calibration solution at a defined conductivity or a defined transparency, to obtain<br>
reasonable measuring results.<br>
Generally, however, the independence of measurement from fluid conductivity may cause<br>
inaccuracies as the mass flow lessens and only foam is present in the measuring section.<br>
This is because due to the independence from the precise conductance value, the<br>
measuring device cannot distinguish whether pure liquid or pure foam phase is flowing in<br>
the measuring area. With a pure foam phase present in the measuring area, the same<br>
potential will be measured as for a pure liquid phase. The same signal would be applied<br>
although the real mass flow would be considerably different.<br><br>
The problem of measuring errors will not occur where only liquid phase or a portion of<br>
liquid phase and a portion of foam or a portion of mixed phase is present. Owing to the<br>
measuring principle, these kinds of influences are automatically taken into account.<br>
Prevention of the measuring inaccuracies indicated above e.g. in the presence of pure foam<br>
phase, is possible with a number of measures.<br>
In the most simple cases the problem is neglected, employing only milk flow values from<br>
milking phases with a milk flow exceeding a specific level e.g. in the main milking phase.<br>
To this end, the measuring area can be limited as appropriate to exclude measuring errors.<br>
This may include a time factor such that past the maximum, measuring is only continued<br>
for a specified time. Measurement will preferably continue as long as an adequate mass<br>
flow is present to wet both of the electrodes with liquid fluid phase.<br>
It is also conceivable to connect between the two electrodes, parallel to the measuring<br>
section a specific, additional impedance which can thus avoid such measuring errors. Such<br>
impedance will "simulate" a basic height of liquid phase. Then if for example only foam is<br>
present between the electrodes, the total electrical impedance between the electrodes is<br>
accordingly higher such that through the additional, parallel impedance the larger portion<br>
of the potential will drop. The value measured will therefore be more accurate. It is a<br>
drawback though that a systematic error is present since said additional impedance is only<br>
adjusted to a conductance which may vary considerably during milking. Then again, there<br>
is the advantage of reduced risk of contamination in such a construction.<br>
It is possible to measure the current conductance at another position and to continually<br>
adjust the impedance accordingly. This allows automatic recognition whether only foam<br>
phase is present and measuring errors can thus be avoided.<br>
For all of the configurations it is preferred that at least one, preferably both of the<br>
electrodes extend over the entire height of the measuring slot of the measuring surface, in<br>
particular the height of the measuring section or the flow channel or the housing.<br>
Preferably the electrodes protrude from the measuring chamber so as to enable contacts<br>
protected from being influenced by the liquid to be measured.<br>
The structure and configuration of the two electrodes is preferably such that in operation<br>
the liquid phase of the fluid can come into contact with both of the electrodes in a bottom<br>
region. The dimensions of the measuring section are preferably such that the top ends of<br>
the electrodes will only be contacted with the highest, maximum flow.<br>
Another option of preventing said inaccuracies is realized in a preferred specific<br>
embodiment in which the two electrodes extend into a hollow in the bottom area,<br>
preferably positioned in the region of the measuring section. In measuring, the first and the<br>
second electrode will be electrically connected with the fluid in the hollow or in the recess.<br>
The structure and the flow guidance are preferably provided such that the liquid phase of<br>
the fluid or of the foaming liquid to be measured will always be naturally present in said<br>
hollow. In this way there will be continuous calibration relative to the liquid phase. Then,<br>
if only foam phase should be present in the measuring area above the hollow, a potential is<br>
measured between the electrodes which includes the density.<br>
The hollow will ensure that even with slightest milk flows both of the electrodes are<br>
electrically connected with one another through a liquid phase of the fluid and no<br>
measuring errors can ensue. Based on the different electrical conductivities of the liquid<br>
phase and the foam, the electrical connection of the two electrodes through the liquid<br>
phase of the fluid in the hollow will ensure that pure foam will not be regarded as a pure<br>
liquid phase.<br>
The depth of the hollow or recess is much smaller than the height of the channel. The ratio<br>
may be larger than 1:5 and lies e.g. in the range between approximately 1:10 and<br>
approximately 1:30, at approximately 1:20.<br>
Preferably the hollow comprises a drain in one specific embodiment. With the drain being<br>
constantly open during measuring there will be continuous exchange with the measured<br>
fluid such that the hollow will always contain representative fluid. Otherwise, depending<br>
on the configuration of the hollow and the properties of the measured fluid there may only<br>
be minor fluid exchange during measuring which may cause measuring errors.<br><br>
A recess without drain is also conceivable. Then, exchange occurs e.g. by way of the fluid<br>
in the recess being entrained.<br>
If a drain is provided it may be closable. The drain may for example be closed during<br>
measuring, in particular where fluid exchange is sufficient. For cleaning the device, the<br>
drain may then be opened to allow for easy cleaning of the hollow.<br>
The drain may for example be formed of a small discharge channel connecting the hollow<br>
with the discharge. Or else, the drain of the hollow may be connected with a separate<br>
outlet or coupling. With the hollow and the device being configured such that a specific<br>
portion of the fluid is drained off through the hollow, said drain can also be used for<br>
drawing off a representative sample e.g. for precisely analyzing the constituents to<br>
examine the milk quality during milking. For this purpose for example 0.5% or 1% or an<br>
adjustable quantity may be drained off.<br>
One significant advantage of a drain is that the recess empties itself at the end of milking<br>
to ensure that after rinsing, no residual rinsing water can enter the milk of the following<br>
cow.<br>
Preferably the housing has a channel provided in it at least part of which is positioned in<br>
the region of the measuring section.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the invention provides at least one electrode configured as a<br>
device extending into the channel.<br>
Preferably at least one electrode is shaped e.g. as a rod or a tube. An electrode can e.g. be<br>
configured as an electrically conductive rod. It is also conceivable that at least one<br>
electrode is configured as a round, oval, angular, in particular quadrangular rod, or as a flat<br>
or curved plate. Selecting this shape of electrodes causes measuring to be reliable and<br>
manufacture to be cost-effective.<br>
It is also conceivable to incorporate one electrode or two or more electrodes into the<br>
channel walls. In this way, easy cleaning and maintenance will be achieved and high<br>
reliability of the measuring device. Moreover, flow in the channel will not be adversely<br>
affected.<br>
All of the configurations preferably provide a flow restriction in the housing in particular<br>
in the region of the measuring section. Said flow restriction may be a flow resistance.<br>
Preferably the flow restriction is configured as a diaphragm. It is also possible to provide a<br>
narrowing of the flow channel over a specified length.<br>
The diaphragm in the sense of the present application is a resistance to fluid flow<br>
preferably formed through a narrowing of the clear flow cross-section of the measuring<br>
section wherein said clear flow cross-section is preferably configured as a channel.<br>
The flow restriction is provided to dam the flowing fluid. Preferably the measuring device<br>
or the electrodes is/are positioned in the vicinity of the flow restriction.<br>
A diaphragm is already known from a device according to DE 37 37 607 Al. Unlike said<br>
device, the diaphragm or the discharge slot according to the invention can be made<br>
considerably wider since the resolution of the measurement is not related to the fill height.<br>
The known device having a plurality of electrodes positioned one above the other provides<br>
for a stepped resolution such that a high measuring resolution can only be achieved above<br>
a fill height corresponding to a multiple of the step spacing. In the present invention,<br>
however, the resolution is preferably independent of the slot width such that a wider slot<br>
can be provided.<br>
This will also considerably reduce the risk of the discharge slot stopping up with foreign<br>
particles. Damming of the fluid in front of the discharge slot in conjunction with the<br>
discharge stopping up will show a higher flow rate than actually exists. This is why the<br>
known device according to DE 37 37 607 Al provides for sieves in the inlet region which<br>
require regular cleaning. This considerably complicates permanent use if the known<br>
device is firmly mounted to a milking appliance since a lot of additional maintenance and<br>
cleaning is required.<br><br>
This drawback is avoided by the specific embodiment of the device according to the<br>
invention. The resolution is not limited to steps specified by the measuring electrodes. The<br>
principle of capturing stepless measured values allows to obtain high accuracy. The stream<br>
width and the outlet cross-section or the discharge slot can be configured larger than in the<br>
device known from the prior art. This has the considerable advantage that foreign matter<br>
or foreign particles possibly present in the milk are drained off, not stopping up the flow<br>
path. Such foreign particles may be e.g. straw, bedding spread or feeding remnants such as<br>
e.g. corn seeds.<br>
Feeding remnants or other foreign bodies such as straws can e.g. be sucked off the floor<br>
before the vacuum is turned off when a teat cup falls off or is kicked off. Inadequate teat<br>
cleaning also may let foreign bodies get into the milk such that they may then stop up the<br>
discharge slot, in particular if it is too narrow e.g. for corn seeds to fit through. Upstream<br>
filters can be omitted.<br>
Preferably the cross-section of the flow restriction or the diaphragm is variable.<br>
Particularly preferably the diaphragm is exchangeable. This allows to adjust the magnitude<br>
of the hydrodynamic resistance. The advantage of this is that even for smaller maximum<br>
milk flows (e.g. when milking the udder quarters separately or for animals whose<br>
maximum milk flow is generally low such as ewes or goats) the achievable measuring<br>
accuracy and measuring resolution is as high since the entire measuring area height will be<br>
used. Where the available measuring area of the device is optimally utilized for each<br>
measurement, a particularly high measuring accuracy is achieved.<br>
Preferred embodiments provide at least one electrode formed by, or integrally with, a<br>
housing element. For example, one electrode or both of the electrodes may be provided in<br>
the wall or on the wall of the channel. Also, at least one electrode may be positioned at the<br>
flow restriction or at the diaphragm.<br>
In the case of a diaphragm used as flow restriction, one electrode each may be provided on<br>
opposite sides. Then it is preferred to predefine or at least influence the width of the<br>
diaphragm aperture by the two electrodes. Preferably both of the electrodes are provided at<br>
the diaphragm.<br>
It is a considerable advantage to have at least part of the flow resistance formed by the<br>
electrodes. Then the electrodes and the diaphragm will form one integral component. For<br>
example one electrode is incorporated into the surface of the flow resistance. This measure<br>
will achieve a still further simplified structure.<br>
In preferred embodiments at least one electrode is positioned upstream of the diaphragm<br>
or of the flow resistance.<br>
One electrode may expediently be placed in a region dammed by the diaphragm,<br>
preferably very close to the flow resistance so as to achieve the most precise determination<br>
of the mass flow possible. The second electrode may be positioned somewhat upstream of<br>
the diaphragm, or else it may be physically connected with the flow resistance.<br>
In other configurations no cross-section restriction is provided at least in the region of the<br>
electrodes. The measuring area in which the electrodes are positioned will then be formed<br>
preferably as a simply multiangular channel. The preferred cross-section is in particular<br>
round or else oval in shape. Then with the electrodes incorporated in the channel walls, the<br>
mass flow of the flowing fluid is determined without requiring a cross-section restriction.<br>
Such a configuration offers advantages in particular in respect of foam discharge.<br>
Stationary foam not transported off by the liquid phase may, if it entirely fills the clear<br>
space above the liquid phase, press down on the liquid phase and thus accelerate the flow<br>
rate such that the flow velocity is no longer identical with the flow velocity. This is why<br>
devices are preferred where the foam portion is mixed in and conveyed off.<br>
Where e.g. a triangular channel is provided with one tip pointing downward the hollow<br>
described above is not necessary since the bottom region will as a rule contain a liquid<br>
phase.<br>
To stabilize the pressure ratios and to avoid effects from changing pressure ratios acting<br>
on the flow velocity and thus on the measuring accuracy, it is preferred to provide for<br>
pressure compensation above the device.<br>
A device for passive or else active pressure compensation above the measuring device will<br>
achieve that the flow velocity is substantially determined by gravity wherein considerable<br>
influences may be exercised by the mass flow itself. Such a device for pressure<br>
compensation will achieve that in the entire measuring area the flow velocity will<br>
correspond to simple calibration.<br>
Without a pressure compensation between inlet and outlet of the device the flow velocity<br>
may depend on the current pressure situation. This is because when, with equal density<br>
distribution above the height in a first example, the pressure differences above the<br>
measuring section are higher than in a second example, the milk will flow faster in the first<br>
example than in the second. For example if additional air enters a teat liner, the milk flow<br>
rate will accelerate due to the air intake. Moreover, pressure may build up locally above<br>
the measuring section, increasing the flow velocity.<br>
Since as a rule, velocity will not be metered separately but calibration measurements are<br>
referred to, and velocity is influenced by the additional stream of air, the mass flow can<br>
then no longer be accurately determined. The mass flow determined by way of the<br>
calibration curve will then no longer match the current mass flow. However, constructive<br>
measures may reduce or avoid this influence.<br>
For measuring it is therefore advantageous if the pressure ratios present are substantially<br>
constant. Where the influence of pressure difference is known, measuring said pressure<br>
difference above the measuring section can be sufficient so as to calculate the mass of the<br>
momentary flow from the height profile of the density and the pressure difference. This is,<br>
however, more complex.<br>
Preferably therefore, a pressure compensation between inlet and outlet is employed to<br>
stabilize the pressure above the measuring section. In a specific configuration of the<br>
invention the pressure above the device is stabilized by means of an active pressure<br>
generating means.<br>
Preferably, however, a passive means, i.e. a bypass is provided which is positioned and<br>
structured such that substantially only gaseous phase, meaning air, but no foam or liquid<br>
phase is discharged through the bypass. Bypasses are in particular suitable to avoid back<br>
pressure. The bypass is particularly preferably provided in the vicinity of the inlet, in<br>
particular in front of the measuring device or the electrodes.<br>
Due to the bypass, the device for measuring a mass flow does not represent a substantial<br>
flow resistance. The additional pressure supply ensures that the pressure near the inlet is<br>
approximately the same as in the milk pipeline in front of or after the device for measuring<br>
the mass flow. In this way no pressure drop will occur within the device which might<br>
affect the flow velocity of the fluid or the milking process.<br>
Preferably the bypass comprises a bypass coupling to keep the device pressureless. The<br>
coupling for the bypass may be configured e.g. as a bypass nozzle.<br>
Preferably the bypass coupling further serves to directly discharge a large proportion of<br>
the milkless air stream. Discharging a large proportion of the air causes a reduction in<br>
foam formation within the measuring section. Discharge of air furthermore prevents<br>
adverse effects on the flow velocity. The bypass coupling and the inlet together may serve<br>
as a cyclone collector, thus establishing a fluid connection with the device outlet.<br>
The device may furthermore comprise a steadying section for steadying and/or smoothing<br>
the flow before the measuring sensor. In this way the measuring accuracy can be enhanced<br>
further.<br>
In all of the embodiments described above at least a third electrode may be provided<br>
which in preferred embodiments extends into the measuring section from above.<br>
By means of the measured values of a third electrode which is employed additionally to<br>
the second electrode as a sensor or a detector, the values from said two sensors can be<br><br>
averaged to still further enhance accuracy. The second and the third electrode can than be<br>
sensed alternating or simultaneously.<br>
With the third electrode extending downwardly from above not over the entire height but<br>
only over part of the height from above, the third electrode can detect a foam layer which<br>
might come to be deposited on top. With the measuring results from the second and the<br>
third electrode being different one may conclude that the second electrode is surrounded<br>
by liquid phase at the bottom while there is foam in the upper portion which the third<br>
electrode substantially detects. By way of a corresponding analysis, inaccuracies in<br>
measuring may be avoided without a hollow or a recess.<br>
In a preferred specific embodiment of the invention at least three electrodes are provided<br>
with an electrical magnitude applied to the first electrode. A first measurement value is<br>
sensed between the first and the second electrode and a second measurement value is<br>
sensed between the first and the third electrode. Now when the second and the third<br>
electrode are spaced apart in the direction of flow, an inclination of the device can be<br>
determined based on the first and the second measurement value. To determine the angle<br>
of inclination the device is partially filled with a fluid in particular before the actual<br>
measuring operation and preferably it is closed so as to prevent the fluid from draining off.<br>
An inclination can then be inferred from the measured values. It is also possible to<br>
determine the three-dimensional inclination with a total of four electrodes suitably<br>
positioned.<br>
After determining the angle or angles of inclination this value may be employed for<br>
corrections to calibration. It is also conceivable to refer back to a suitable calibration curve<br>
stored in the device memory by means of the determined angular value. The overall<br>
reliability and accuracy can thus be enhanced further.<br>
Preferred specific embodiments of all of the specific embodiments described above may<br>
provide for a separate inclination sensor. An inclination sensor as known from the prior art<br>
is suitable. The signal or signals of the inclination sensor are used for selecting a suitable<br>
calibration curve from a number of calibration curves, or for selecting a fixed or flexible<br>
correction parameter for the measurement values.<br><br>
An incorporated separate inclination sensor offers the advantage that the alignment of the<br>
device can be checked at fixed or irregular intervals. Said checking may be performed<br>
once in a period such as once a week or a day, or preferably at least once per measuring<br>
process. The position may be determined during measuring in that as each measurement<br>
value or every nth measurement value is captured the signals from the inclination sensor<br>
are taken into account.<br>
A particularly preferred embodiment provides a measuring chamber for the inclination<br>
sensor mounted at the device. The inclination sensor may operate according to the<br>
measuring principle described above. Then the measuring chamber for the inclination<br>
sensor comprises three and preferably at least four electrodes. The electrode configuration<br>
is provided such that an inclination angle can be determined at least in the direction of<br>
flow of the fluid to be measured. It is conceivable to provide one common analysis means<br>
for the measuring device for determining the quantity or the mass flow of the fluid and for<br>
the inclination sensor.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention provides that measuring is as a rule not performed<br>
in-flow but by continuously determining the quantity of fluid filling into a measuring<br>
vessel collected in particular during milking. This configuration provides that the<br>
measuring vessel collects the fluid at least for a time period. After filling the measuring<br>
vessel, the vessel may be drained. A periodic filling and draining of the collected fluids<br>
during the measuring process is also conceivable, in particular if the volume of the vessel<br>
is not sufficient for intermediate storage of the entire quantity of fluid for one measuring<br>
process.<br>
In one embodiment with a measuring vessel the electrodes extend over the entire height of<br>
the measuring vessel utilized for measuring. Preferably the cross-section of the measuring<br>
vessel is nearly equal above the height. Otherwise calibration may be performed relative to<br>
the measuring vessel geometry.<br>
In this configuration the analysis means is suitable for determining a mass of the fluid in<br>
the measuring vessel. Due to the difference of the fluid content in the measuring vessel<br><br>
between a second point in time and a first point in time, the quantity of fluid added during<br>
said interval can be inferred. Dividing by the time period will result in the mass flow of<br>
the fluid. Since the frequency of measuring can be very high since the time gap required<br>
between a first and a second measurement is small, a continuous or at least quasi<br>
continuous determination of the quantity or the mass flow can be performed.<br>
With the first measurement of the quantity M1 performed at a time T1 and the second<br>
measurement yielding a measuring result M2 at a time T2, the result will be the mass flow<br>
of (M2(T2)-M1(T1))/(T2-T1). Given a time interval of e.g. 1 second, a milk flow of e.g. 120<br>
g/min. will yield a mass deficiency of 2 grams which will allow a determination of the<br>
milk flow at more than adequate accuracy. A higher frequency of measuring will result in<br>
a correspondingly higher resolution.<br>
In any case, an embodiment with a measuring vessel provides that always the entire<br>
quantity of fluid will be measured (from the last draining of the measuring vessel).<br>
Additionally the current mass flow can be determined by establishing the difference. The<br>
measured values may be smoothed e.g. by employing the moving average method or<br>
another filter method.<br>
Employing a measuring vessel for measuring is in particular preferred if during measuring<br>
the fluid to be measured is analyzed. For example during milking a portion of the milk<br>
yield may be diverted and analyzed online. Milk not meeting specific criteria may be<br>
discarded after milking without getting into the bulk milk tank. This may be done e.g. for<br>
milk not meeting predefined requirements e.g. where the cell count exceeds a specific<br>
threshold value, or clots have been detected in the milk, or inhibiting substances have been<br>
detected in the milk, etc.<br>
Determination is preferably performed continuously to allow immediate determination of<br>
the milk flow and thus immediate control of the milking operation. Then, the mass flow<br>
i.e. the quantity of liquid per time can be determined.<br>
Also for in-flow measuring, a vessel for receiving and intermediate storage of the fluid to<br>
be measured may be provided for performing a total measurement in addition to in-flow<br>
measurement, or for intermediate fluid storage until measuring results on the fluid<br>
constituents are available, and the like.<br>
All of the configurations described above include the considerable advantage of easy<br>
cleaning of the device. The measuring principle allows a simple structure of the device<br>
which in addition to easy cleaning also allows easy maintenance since no fragile or<br>
mechanically moving parts or sensitive optical components are required.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the invention comprises a configuration having at least two<br>
devices as described above.<br>
To obtain further information on the mass flow or the fluid, two or more devices for mass<br>
flow measurements may be provided. Preferably two or more devices as described above<br>
are connected in series. A connection in parallel is also conceivable, in particular with a<br>
specified or known split ratio between the individual devices. With information on the<br>
volume of the mass flow at different positions of the fluid line, interruptions due to<br>
contamination (blocked clear passage of the channel due to deposits of straw, corn seeds,<br>
etc.) can be established and possibly computed out of the measured results, or a<br>
maintenance signal can be emitted.<br>
Furthermore the invention relates to a configuration for measuring at least two quantities<br>
or mass flows in particular of a foaming liquid. The configuration comprises at least one<br>
electrical means for generating an electrical magnitude, and at least one analysis means. At<br>
least two devices having measuring sections or a measuring vessel each and at least two<br>
electrodes each are provided. The electrical means can be connected alternating<br>
substantially parallel to the first electrode of the first device and substantially parallel to<br>
the first electrode of the second device. Preferably each device comprises a separate<br>
housing.<br>
With the mass flow being measured at least in two different places, comparison of the<br>
measurements in the different places along a fluid line will allow drawing inferences on<br>
the structure of the fluid and on the mass flow. A time correlation of the mass flows<br>
determined in different places suggests itself for determining at least one magnitude<br>
characterizing the structure of the fluid. For example the flow velocity can be inferred<br>
from the data. Abrupt, partial clotting of the discharge slot or the measuring area may also<br>
be captured and computed out of the measuring results. In addition, a comparison of the<br>
two measuring results allows conclusions on the measuring accuracy, in particular in terms<br>
of error range. Also, information on the milking process may be gathered.<br>
According to another inventive idea the invention relates to a configuration for measuring<br>
at least two quantities or mass flows in particular of a foaming liquid. At least one<br>
electrical means for generating an electrical magnitude and at least one analysis means are<br>
provided. Furthermore at least two devices having a measuring section each or a<br>
measuring vessel each are provided. The measuring section or the housing comprise at<br>
least two electrodes each. Therein the analysis means can be connected alternating<br>
between the first and the second electrode of a device and between the first and the second<br>
electrode of another device. Preferably each device comprises a separate housing.<br>
In a preferred specific embodiment exactly one electrical means and exactly one analysis<br>
means are provided for at least two devices. It is also possible to provide 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or<br>
more devices in total with exactly one electrical means and exactly one analysis means. It<br>
is also possible to provide one electrical means for a number of devices and for each<br>
device one analysis means each. It is also possible to provide one analysis means for a<br>
number of devices and for each device one electrical means each.<br>
In a preferred specific embodiment at least two devices are positioned in parallel provided<br>
and e.g. optimized for different through-flows.<br>
The configuration allows to determine in particular two or more quantity or mass flows<br>
separated from one another in terms of structure and space. Each device of the<br>
configuration serves to determine independent quantity or mass flows, e.g. from two<br>
different teats of one animal to be milked.<br>
For teat-individual measurement, a corresponding number of devices is preferably<br>
provided. For example for measuring the quantity of milk flow from goats, two devices,<br>
from cows, four devices for individual measuring of each quarter may be provided.<br>
For measuring the milk quantity or the milk mass flow it is e.g. possible to provide a<br>
number of milking places with one configuration in total. Thus, one milking parlor may<br>
have each milking place or part of the milking places equipped with a measuring section<br>
or a measuring vessel while (central) analyzing electronics capture the measured results. A<br>
milking carousel may thus be equipped with one electronic analysis device only.<br>
A preferred specific embodiment of the inventive configuration provides for a first device<br>
having a smaller flow cross-section and a second device having a larger flow cross-<br>
section. The device having the larger flow cross-section may be additionally connected for<br>
high milk flows to increase the measuring area and to further enhance accuracy.<br>
The inventive method for measuring a mass flow of a fluid, in particular a foamy liquid<br>
such as milk, includes the following method steps: introducing an electrical magnitude in<br>
the mass flow of the flowing fluid by means of a first electrode, measuring a generated<br>
electrical magnitude in the fluid between the first and a second electrode, and determining<br>
the mass flow by means of the captured signal. The preferred electrical magnitude applied<br>
to the flowing fluid is a potential.<br>
For measuring the fluid may be dammed by means of a diaphragm and the density profile<br>
measured in the dammed area and the mass flow inferred. Where the hydrodynamic<br>
properties of the diaphragm, the measuring section and the housing are known, the mass<br>
flow can be computed by means of the density profile of the fluid. Inference is particularly<br>
easy through a calibration measurement.<br>
The applicant points out that they reserve the right to apply for separate protection directed<br>
at a device and a method for measuring the quantity of a foaming liquid and/or a device<br>
and a method for measuring a mass flow of a foaming liquid and in particular a foamy or<br>
foam-forming liquid. Specific configurations may provide for such a device or such a<br>
method to comprise individual or several of the features described above.<br>
Further advantages, features and configurations of the invention will now be described in<br>
the following embodiments with reference to the figures. These show schematically in:<br><br>

The Figures 1 and 2 show a first embodiment of a device 100 according to the invention in<br>
a perspective view for measuring a mass flow of a fluid 1, in particular a foam containing<br>
or foamy liquid or a foaming liquid such as milk. In the vicinity of the inlet 4 of the<br>
housing 50 a pressure compensation nozzle 21 is provided to remove air. The inlet 4 leads<br>
tangentially into the housing 50 such that the fluid rotates while running into the housing.<br>
Furthermore a channel 3 is provided subsequent to the inlet 4.<br>
A measuring system 7 is positioned in the channel 3 in front of a diaphragm 17 in this<br>
embodiment with said diaphragm 17 being positioned upstream in front of a drain 5. The<br>
diaphragm 17 serves as a flow resistance 6 (see Fig. 2). Preferred embodiments provide<br>
that the diaphragm can be inserted (see Fig. 1) or exchanged (see Fig. 2) as needed.<br>
Exchanging the diaphragm 17 allows to adjust the flow resistance to different conditions<br>
since e.g. in milking ewes or goats the maximum milk flow is considerably smaller than in<br>
milking cows.<br>
The diaphragm 17 has a trapezoidal opening cross-section 18 which increases upwardly.<br>
The diaphragm 17 predetermines the magnitude of hydrodynamic resistance of the flow<br><br>
resistance 6. The flow resistance is adjustable by changing for example the clear opening<br>
cross-section and its conicity. The air removal device or bypass nozzle 21 serves to<br>
maintain the entire measuring device substantially pressureless by removing a portion of<br>
the air contained in the fluid whose mass flow is to be determined.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a device 100 according to the invention for measuring a mass flow in<br>
longitudinal section with the channel 3 which comprises an inlet 4 (see Fig. 1) and an<br>
outlet 5 and through which a fluid 1 flows which contains a foam portion 2. The inlet 4 is<br>
incorporated in a cyclone collector 20 through which gas or air can be partially removed<br>
via the bypass nozzle 21 or the air removal device 21.<br>
The fluid flows into the housing 50 in the inlet region in a tangent line. The fluid flow lays<br>
against the housing element 51 which is round in shape and which serves as a cyclone<br>
collector 20. The heavier liquid phase is urged outwardly while at least a portion of the<br>
gaseous phase 2 accumulates in a central area and is discharged via the bypass nozzle 21.<br>
The bypass nozzle is positioned centrally at the end of the housing element 51 which is<br>
cylindrical in shape there, connecting the first element of the housing 50 at which the inlet<br>
4 is provided via a bypass line with the second end of the housing 50 where the outlet 5 is<br>
provided so as to establish a pressure balance between inlet 4 and outlet 5. This serves to<br>
maintain the measuring device 100 per se pressureless such that the established flow<br>
velocity of the fluid is substantially not based on pressure differences. Increased pressure<br>
differences might otherwise be caused e.g. by air infiltration at the teat liner. Overall, a<br>
bypass permits an increase in reproducibility.<br>
The housing 50 comprises a first element 51 and a second element 52. The first element of<br>
the housing 51 is inclined to the horizontal in the region of the inlet 4. In this embodiment<br>
the angle is approx. 45° to the horizontal. The second housing element 52 is also inclined<br>
to the horizontal so as to support the flowing movement. The angle of inclination is<br>
smaller though and related to the actual conditions. As a rule the angle will be smaller than<br>
30°, preferably smaller than 15°. Good results have been achieved with an angle of<br>
inclination of 5°.<br><br>
A center axis 56 (the dashed line) through the first housing element 51 or the first section<br>
of the housing 50 is inclined relative to the vertical orientation by an angle 58 which in<br>
this embodiment is approximately 45°. A center axis 58 (the dashed line) through the<br>
second housing element 52 or the second section of the housing 50 is inclined relative to<br>
the vertical orientation by an angle 59. Both housing elements are configured to be<br>
virtually rotationally symmetrical relative to their center axes 56 and 57. In particular the<br>
round cross-section of the second section 52 in front of the sensor with the first and the<br>
second electrode serves to cause the foam to be mixed into the flowing fluid in the<br>
relevant measuring area such that any present or forming foam will be flushed off and<br>
cannot accumulate.<br>
In particular the inclination of the first housing element 51 causes the fluid to flow through<br>
the housing 50 in a helical pattern. The fluid flowing in is guided radially and due to<br>
gravity an additional, axial factor is introduced.<br>
In this embodiment the housing 50 includes an overflow or a partition wall 19 which is<br>
provided herein between the first housing element 51 and the second housing element 52<br>
and extends from the roof rearwardly and downwardly at an incline. The partition 19<br>
closes off the device in the upper region such that fluid can only pass beneath from the<br>
first housing element 51 to the second housing element 52. The partition 19 serves to<br>
additionally decelerate the flow velocity and to better mix the foam in since the foam<br>
floating on the liquid can only pass the clear cross-section beneath the overflow when it is<br>
mixed in, since the clear cross-section tends to be beneath the liquid level. Other<br>
embodiments may be provided without a partition 19.<br>
Generally, the helical fluid movement continues through the entire housing 50 so as to<br>
provide a helical fluid movement also in the second, substantially cylindrically configured<br>
housing element 52, at least with strong fluid flows.<br>
It is a substantial advantage of this structure that the foam portion of the fluid is entrained<br>
and mixed in. In conventional housing structures and flow conditions, foam tends to rise<br>
and to accumulate above the flowing liquid portion of the fluid as a stationary foam<br>
portion. The present configuration largely avoids this. The foam portion is reliably<br><br>
discharged at least in the milk flows occurring during the main milking phase. At the<br>
beginning and ending of milking the foam portion is as a rule also reliably discharged.<br>
Since the principle of the measuring method employed includes the foam portion, the<br>
measuring accuracy achieved is excellent as a whole.<br>
The fluid 1 is dammed in front of the drain 5 in the second housing element 52 by way of<br>
a flow resistance 6 provided in the shape of a diaphragm in this case, emptying into the<br>
drain 5.<br>
The measuring device 7 is formed by the two electrodes 8, 9 and the voltmeter means 13<br>
and the voltage source 12 or the voltage generator means. The electrodes of the measuring<br>
device 7 may be placed in the vicinity of the flow resistance 6. The diaphragm may in<br>
particular be formed by the electrodes as illustrated in Fig. 5 such that a first sidewardly<br>
boundary 53 of the diaphragm may serve as the first electrode 9 and the second sidewardly<br>
boundary 54, as the second electrode 8.<br>
Although the first electrode 9 in Fig. 3 is configured as a round bar of a conductive<br>
material (e.g. high-grade steel), it may be incorporated into a wall of the channel 3 as<br>
illustrated in Fig. 4B.<br>
The voltage generator means 12 serves to predetermine an alternating voltage so as to<br>
avoid electrolytic deposits on the electrodes 8, 9 which would cause an impediment of<br>
voltage measurement. The frequencies employed are conventional.<br>
The density of the fluid 1 flowing through is determined by way of a first electrode 9 and a<br>
second electrode 8 in that electric lines 22 and a voltage generator means 12 apply voltage<br>
to the first electrode 9 between remote spots 9a and 9b of the first electrode 9. The voltage<br>
can be applied in particular, as illustrated in the present embodiment, between the first end<br>
10 and a second end 11 of the first electrode 9. The first end 10 and the first spot 9a at the<br>
first electrode 9 are provided herein in the bottom region of the housing while the second<br>
spot 9b and the second end 11 are positioned in the upper region of the housing.<br><br>
The resistance of the electrode 9 is selected such that it is considerably smaller than that of<br>
the fluid to be measured at maximum fill height. In this way the influence of the fluid<br>
resistance on the total resistance can be neglected in a first approximation. However, said<br>
influence may be included in the calculation.<br>
The applied potential depends on the individual case. In this embodiment the peak value of<br>
the alternating voltage is 60 mV while the impedance of the electrode 9 is approximately<br>
100milliohms.<br>
In the first electrode the potential linearly increases with the height. The applied potential<br>
is introduced into the fluid at each location wetted with fluid. By way of the low absolute<br>
height of the potentials adverse effects on the animals to be milked are avoided.<br>
The second electrode 8 extends from a first spot 8a or from a first end in the bottom region<br>
of the housing up to a second spot 8b or a second end in the upper region of the housing,<br>
acquiring a potential related to the fill height of the fluid 1 and the composition of the<br>
fluid. The voltmeter means 13 serves to connect the spot 8a of the second electrode 8 with<br>
the spot 9a of the first electrode 9 or the lower end 10 of the first electrode 9. Where only a<br>
pure liquid phase is present, a corresponding potential is applied to the second electrode 8<br>
corresponding to the level of the flowing fluid and measured with the voltmeter means 13.<br>
The foam portion 2 is included since the specific impedance of the foam is<br>
correspondingly higher than that of the liquid phase. The impedance portions of the liquid<br>
phase and the foam phase combined form a total impedance which is representative of the<br>
density.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a cross-section through an inventive device 100 comprising a first electrode 9<br>
configured as a round bar and a second electrode 8 likewise configured as a round bar. The<br>
two electrodes 8 and 9 extend into a recess 14 in which fluid will accumulate even with<br>
lowest mass flows so as to establish an electrical connection between the first electrode 9<br>
and the second electrode 8 via the liquid phase. An electrical contact via the liquid phase is<br>
important at the beginning of milking and in particular near the end of milking when the<br>
milk flow is low or insignificant. Where no liquid phase is present and only foam remains,<br>
measuring errors might otherwise occur.<br>
A hollow filled with liquid phase ensures that correct measuring results will be obtained<br>
even with mass flows comprising a virtually pure foam phase.<br>
Basic, simple embodiments also allow a small resistance to be connected in parallel<br>
instead of a hollow to simulate a "hollow". Satisfactory results may be obtained also in<br>
this way although with small flows of virtually purely foam the fluid conductance may<br>
influence the measurement results.<br>
This measure allows measuring the potential even with the smallest mass flows. The<br>
recess 14 comprises a drain 15 through which fluid 1 can continuously drain off such that<br>
the fluid 1 in the recess 14 is continuously exchanged.<br>
Any temporary variations of the conductivity of the fluid 1 are thus also sensed in the<br>
recess 14 so as not to cause inaccuracies in measuring. A minimum level of liquid forms<br>
by way of the recess 14 such that in potentiometric measuring not the fill height of the<br>
foam but the average density of the fluid 1 is determined.<br>
Figures 5 and 6 show different embodiments of the flow resistance 6 as a diaphragm 17<br>
having different conically tapering or trapezoidal opening cross-sections 18. The opening<br>
cross-sections 18 may be adjusted to specific measurements which offers the advantage<br>
that even small mass flows permit reliably measuring changes of the liquid level.<br>
A specific embodiment of the device provides for a diaphragm 17 as illustrated e.g. in Fig.<br>
5. The two electrodes 8, 9 may form the boundaries of the diaphragms 17 in that one edge<br>
53 forms the first electrode 9 and the second edge 54, the second electrode 8. This<br>
configuration was originally considered disadvantageous since it had been expected that<br>
the potential introduced into the first electrode 9 would be irregular and the potential<br>
sensed with the second electrode 8 would also be irregular since the distance of the<br>
electrodes greatly varies above the height. Surprisingly it has been found though that this<br>
configuration results in high quality measuring results although the two electrodes are not<br>
positioned parallel relative to one another. The V-shape or the trapezoidal shape of the<br>
electrodes does not impair measuring. To the contrary, this configuration permits to obtain<br>
especially reliable measurements. The reason is among other things that the entire flowing<br>
fluid flows through the diaphragm and the density is determined between the two<br>
electrodes.<br>
Fig. 7 is a side view of a modified embodiment of the flow resistance. In this configuration<br>
the flow resistance is positioned at an incline to the vertical. While the angle to the vertical<br>
is approximately 45° herein, it may be between 0° and 60° or larger.<br>
In this embodiment the edges of the diaphragm 17 may again be formed by one or both of<br>
the electrodes. Again the diaphragm 17 is trapezoidal in cross-section 18 as illustrated in<br>
the Figures 5 and 6. The diaphragm is inclined in the direction of flow. In this way,<br>
foreign particles in the flowing fluid which might otherwise settle in a bottom region of<br>
the diaphragm are flushed upwardly until the cross-section of the diaphragm is sufficient<br>
to entrain and flush off the foreign particles. Occlusion of the diaphragm will thus not<br>
occur as a rule.<br>
In Figure 8 an equivalent diagram of the measuring principle is drawn in. The first<br>
electrode 9 consists of a low-resistance high-grade steel bar immersed into the conductive<br>
liquid-gas mixture. The voltage generator means 12 drives a high frequency current<br>
through the first electrode 9 via the supply lines 22. A voltage is measured by the<br>
voltmeter means 13 between the first electrode 9 and the second electrode 8.<br>
The center equivalent resistances RF1 and RF2 of the liquid-gas mixture lie parallel to the<br>
immersed portion of the first electrode 9. The collected voltage is thus proportional to the<br>
density curve at the first electrode 9. Controlled current feed serves to minimize the direct<br>
effect of the center equivalent resistances RF1 and RF2 to the measuring result.<br>
