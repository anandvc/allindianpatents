The invention relates to mirror comprising a display device.<br>
As examples one may think of large mirrors, like bathroom mirrors in which part of the minor surface is used for display purposes. Other examples are medium sized mirrors, like outside mirrors for trucks, mirrors in shaving rooms, dressing-table mirrors or full-length minors in fitting rooms or even mirrored walls.<br>
Such a mirror is described in the pending European Applications Serial number 02076069.2, filed on March 18,2002 and Serial number 02079306.3, filed on October 17,2002 (= PH NL 02.1038). The mirror function is obtained by introducing a polarizing mirror or reflective polarizer in stead of a partly reflecting layer in front of a display device.<br>
Some disadvantages of this structure however are on the one hand that the reflectivity of the polarizer shows, (slight) inhomogenities, both in color as in direction, resulting in color patterns and disturbed reflected images while the reflectivity of the polarizer also is limited (to approx. 50% which prohibits certain applications (such as automotive)).<br>
On the other hand presently available reflective polarizers are limited in size, prohibiting applications in (veiy) large mirrors while also their cost is rather high, typically a multitude of the price of a normal mirror.<br>
It is one of the objects of the invention to overcome at least partly the above-mentioned problem. To this end a mirror according to the invention comprises an at least partly reflecting layer and a polarizing mirror for viewing purposes comprising a display<br>
device.<br>
A partly reflecting layer, when present in front of the display device, reduces the above mentioned inhomogenities. On the other hand a completely reflecting layer can be used outside the area of the display device when the mirror has a first part comprising a reflecting layer, and a second part at least partly transmitting light from the polarizing mirror.<br><br>
Generally the polarizing mirror has a first plane reflecting light of a first kind of polarization to a viewing side, the mirror passing light of a second kind of polarization and being provided with a display device at its non-viewing side, which display device during use provides light of the second kind of polarization. The display device during use emits or reflects (polarized) light<br>
By "having a first plane reflecting light of a first kind of polarization" it is meant that a mirror plane acts as a polarizing plane. When in use, light within a certain range of a wavelength of light incident on a polarizing plane will be divided in two.components one which is reflected by the polarizing plane and one of which passes through the polarizing plane. Generally most known is the division of light in two components having linearly polarized, perpendicular directions of polarization. On the other hand the light may be divided in right-handed and left-handed circular or elliptical polarization.<br>
A first possible application of such a mirror is an interactive bathroom-mirror. This mirror displays (preferably personalised) information like news or weatherforecast while the user is standing in front of the mirror while e.g. brushing teeth or shaving. For children the same or another display in said mirror can display interactive instructions (e.g. by means of cartoon-characters) while brushing teeth in order to learn (the timing for) brushing. The mirror can further be used for displaying television or movies during bathing or during hair-cutting.<br>
Such a mirror can also be used as a handheld interactive device, such as a purse-mirror or in the automobile industry, where the dead-angle as viewed by a CCD-camera can directly be displayed in the rear-view mirror.<br>
Preferably the mirror comprises an aperture in the reflecting layer at the area of the display device. A (thin) transflective layer within the aperture reduces the above mentioned inhomogenities again.<br>
To prevent visibility of the display area and the "full mirror" area the reflectivity of the reflective layer at the edge of the aperture increases viewed in an outward directed direction from the aperture. Also a (decorative) cover of the edge area is possible.<br>
A further embodiment has at its viewing side a further semi-transparent mirror.<br>
These and other aspects of the invention are apparent from and will be elucidated with reference to the embodiments described hereinafter.<br><br>
In the drawings:<br>
Figure 1 is a possible embodiment of a mirror device according to the invention, while<br>
Figure 2 is a diagrammatic cross-section of a part of a mirror device according to the invention.<br>
Figure 3 show a modification of the mirror device according to Figure 2.<br>
Figure 4 is a diagrammatic cross-section of a part of another mirror device according to the invention while<br>
Figure 5 shows another mirror device according to the invention and<br>
Figure 6 is a diagrammatic cross-section of a part of another mirror device according to the invention.<br>
The Figures are diagrammatic and not drawn to scale. Corresponding elements are generally denoted by the same reference numerals.<br>
Figure 1 shows a mirror device 1 for viewing purposes having a mirror 2 reflecting light, so a person 3 sees his image 3' (and further background, not shown). According to the invention the mirror has an aperture 9 in a reflective layer 8 provided on a glass substrate 4 (see also Figure 2). Furthermore the mirror is provided with a display device 5 at its non-viewing side.<br>
The display device 5 in this example is a liquid crystal display device having between two substrates (glass or plastic or any other suitable material) a liquid crystal material. Since most liquid crystal display devices are based on polarization effects the display 5 during use substantially emits polarized light. In general light from a backlight is modulated by the liquid crystal display effect. Since the liquid crystal display device is based on a polarization effect the display 5 comprises a first polarizer and a second polarizer (or analyzer), which passes light of a certain polarization (direction).<br>
On the other hand in certain applications it may even be attractive to polarize light from e.g. an (O)LED or other display to obtain the effect of a high contrast of displayed information with respect to reflected images in mirror applications<br>
As discussed in the pending European Applications Serial number 02076069.2, filed on March 18,2002 and Serial number 02079306.3, filed on October 17,2002 (= FH NL 02.1038) the mirror function is obtained by introducing a polarizing mirror or reflective polarizer in which the mirror (plane) only reflects light of a first kind of polarization<br><br>
(direction) (substantially 50 % reflection, indicated by arrow 14 in Figure 2), but passes light of a second kind of polarization (direction) (100% transmission or emission, indicated by arrow 15 in Figure 2) generated by the display 5.<br>
The mirror display 7, comprising the display 5 and the polarizing mirror 6 is integrated or embedded in the minor 2 which reflects substantially all light (radiation) (up to 100% transmission or emission, indicated by arrow 13 in Figure 2).<br>
In most applications the mirror 2 is (much) larger than the mirror display 7. Outside the display area, the mirror is a normal mirror. At the display area, the reflective layer is absent, such that the mirror display is visible. The reflective properties of both areas need not be the same. However, if the reflectivity (and other optical parameters such as color) of both areas are chosen the same, the transition will be less visible. Figure 3 shows a further embodiment in which said transition is masked further. The reflectivity of the reflective layer 8 at the edge 11 of the aperture 9 increases viewed in an outward directed direction from the aperture. Optimal increase is reached over a distance between 1 mm and 20 mm. This can be obtained by either using a slanting edge 11 of the reflective layer 8 or by e.g. diminishing the concentration of reflective particles, when a reflective layer consisting of a composition of such reflective particles is used. In Figure 3 the arrows 14,15,16 have the same meaning as in Figure 2.<br>
In the embodiment shown the perceived display brightness is optimal while at the same time the display area acts as a mirror when the display is off. Furthermore the mirror properties in the non-display area can be optimal for use as a mirror and the size of polarizing mirror can be limited to the display size (reducing cost and enabling large size mirrors).<br>
In the embodiment of Figure 4 a thin layer 8' of the reflective material within the aperture 9 (thinner then the layer 8 in the remaining part of the mirror 2). The mirror 2 now has two different areas, the display and the non-display area, each with a different transmission/reflectivity. The display area of the mirror 2 has a lower reflectivity and higher transmission than the non-display area. By adjusting the reflectivity and transmission of the display area a trade-off can be made between reflectivity (minor functionality) and perceived display brightness. By choosing the reflectivity of the non-display-area the same as the combined reflection of front mirror (in the display area) and the polarizing mirror) the perceived difference between both areas can be minimized. Also other optical properties (such as color) can be matched. Especially for smaller mirrors the thin layer 8* of the<br><br>
reflective material may cover the full part of the mirror 2, as shown in Figure 5. In Figures 4 and 5 the arrows 14,15,16 have a similar meaning as in Figures 2 and 3.<br>
Figure 6 finally shows a variation on the embodiment of Figure 3, which comprises a further semi-transparent mirror 12 in front of the embodiment of Figure 3, the mirror 12 having a partly reflective and partly transmissive layer 16 provided on a glass substrate 17. In this case two different alternatives are possible for the position of the reflective layer 8 of the locally transparent mirror 2. If placed at the side of the polarizing mirror 6 the visibility of the transition between display and non-display area will be minimized. If placed at the side of the semi-transparent mirror 12 parallax effects in the non-display area will be minimized.<br>
The protective scope of the invention is not limited to the embodiments described. For instance more than one display can be integrated in the mirror, whereas many other applications areas can be thought of (rear view mirrors, fitting rooms, etcetera). Also in the embodiments of Figures 4 and 6 the reflectivity of the reflective layer 8 at the edge 11 of the aperture 9 may again increase, viewed in an outward directed direction from the aperture.<br>
Furthermore the transition area (the edge) may be provided with a mask such as a colored strip or any other suitable design depending on the kind of application.<br>
The invention resides in each and every novel characteristic feature and each and every combination of characteristic features. Reference numerals in the claims do not limit their protective scope. Use of the verb "to comprise" and its conjugations does not exclude the presence of elements other than those stated in the claims. Use of the article "a" or "an" preceding an element does not exclude the presence of a plurality of such elements.<br><br>
