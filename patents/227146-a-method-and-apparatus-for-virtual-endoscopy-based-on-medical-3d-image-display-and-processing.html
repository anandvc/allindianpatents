				<td>Method of virtual endoscopy for medical 3D image display and<br>
processing, computer tomograph, workstation and computer<br>
program product<br>
The invention relates to a method of virtual endoscopy for<br>
medical 3D image display and processing, having the following<br>
method steps: a first evaluation volume is provided on the<br>
basis of a 3D data volume, an observer path is provided through<br>
the first evaluation volume. The invention also relates to a<br>
computer tomograph, a workstation and a computer program<br>
product.<br>
Modern medical imaging methods normally provide images in<br>
digital form. To this end, the first step within the framework<br>
of "primary applications" is data recording and the provision<br>
of the digital data in the course of data construction. In<br>
particular, computer tomography images are provided in digital<br>
form and can thus be processed further directly in a computer<br>
or in a workstation. From the original images, it is possible<br>
to obtain images in a new orientation with two-dimensional or<br>
three-dimensional display (2D display, 3D display) in order to<br>
provide a suitable overview for the examiner. Such displays are<br>
intended, in particular, to form the basis of subsequent<br>
diagnosis within the context of a monitor examination. The<br>
advantages of computer tomography result, in particular, from<br>
the fact that there are no superposition problems as in the<br>
case of conventional radiography, and computer tomography<br>
provides the advantage of undistorted display regardless of<br>
different magnification factors associated with the recording<br>
geometry in radiography.<br>
In the meantime, a series of different procedures have become<br>
established for 3D image display and processing. For these<br>
procedures, a computer tomograph has suitable control elements,<br><br>
e.g. a computer mouse or other control media. A workstation for<br>
image display and processing of computer tomography images is<br>
equipped with appropriate software in the form of a computer<br>
program product and a user interface on a screen with<br>
appropriate control elements to which functions are assigned.<br>
Computer tomography (CT) first of all normally provides two-<br>
dimensional sectional images of the transverse plane of a body<br>
to be examined as direct recording plane. In this case, the<br>
transverse plane of a body is arranged essentially at right<br>
angles to the longitudinal axis of a body. Two-dimensional<br>
sectional images in a plane at an angle that has changed in<br>
comparison with the transverse plane and/or those which are<br>
calculated with a different, particularly broader, layer<br>
thickness than the original layer thickness are normally called<br>
multiplanar reformations (MPR). One option which is fundamental<br>
to diagnosis is interactive inspection and evaluation of the<br>
image volume, usually under the control of an appropriate<br>
control element. The examiner can use such control elements -<br>
in a similar manner to guiding a sound head in ultrasound - to<br>
feel his way to anatomized structures and pathological details<br>
and can move forward and backward to select that image in which<br>
a detail of interest is presented most clearly, that is to say<br>
by way of example is displayed with the highest contrast and<br>
the largest diameter. An extended form of two-dimensional<br>
display involves putting together layers (slabs) of arbitrary<br>
thickness from thin layers. For this, the term "sliding thin<br>
slab" (STS) has become established. All 2D displays have the<br>
advantage that the computer tomography values are displayed<br>
directly and without corruption. Any interpolations or averages<br>
formed over a plurality of layers are negligible in this case.<br>
This means that there is always simple orientation in the<br>
evaluation volume, which is also called the volume of interest<br>
(VOI) , and in the associated 3D data volume and also explicit<br>
interpretability of the image values. This type of monitor<br>
examination is work-intensive and time-consuming, however.<br><br>
By contrast, the most realistic presentation of the evaluation<br>
volume possible can be achieved through three-dimensional<br>
display of the evaluation volume. Although 3D image display and<br>
processing is normally the prerequisite for specific<br>
elaboration of diagnostically relevant details, the latter<br>
examination is normally performed in a 2D display.<br>
In the case of 3D image display and processing, a 3D data<br>
volume is normally provided which is taken as a basis for<br>
displaying the evaluation volume. The examiner preferably<br>
prescribes an observer position from which he wishes to observe<br>
the evaluation volume. In particular, the examiner normally has<br>
a search beam at his disposal. In this example, a two-<br>
dimensional image is calculated which is at right angles to the<br>
search beam and is intended to convey a spatial impression. To<br>
construct such a display pixel by pixel (also: voxel - acronym<br>
for volume element) in the image plane, all CT values along the<br>
search beam through the 3D data volume need to be taken into<br>
account and assessed for each beam from the observer to the<br>
respective pixel. The examiner normally prescribes a pixel<br>
value, e.g. a contrast value, which he selects in suitable<br>
fashion for displaying a pixel. The repetition (inherent to the<br>
method) of this process shows the examiner a collection of<br>
pixels corresponding to the search beam on the basis of the<br>
prescribed pixel values within the context of a CT value<br>
profile for the search beam, that is to say shows a 3D display<br>
of the body region/evaluation volume of interest (VOI).<br>
All 3D displays may, that is to say within the context of a<br>
secondary application, be designed either as a central<br>
projection or as a parallel projection. For a parallel<br>
projection, "maximum intensity projection" (MIP) or generally<br>
"volume rendering" (VR) is particularly suitable. In the case<br>
of MIP, the pixel with the highest CT value is determined in<br>
the projection direction along the search beam. In that case,<br><br>
the pixel value thus corresponds to the maximum CT value on the<br>
search beam. In the case of VR, not just a single pixel is<br>
chosen for each individual search beam coming from the<br>
observer's eye, but rather all CT values along the search beam<br>
can, with suitable weighting, deliver a pixel as a contribution<br>
to the resulting image. Freely selectable and interactively<br>
alterable transfer functions are used to assign opacity and<br>
color to each pixel value. It is thus possible, by way of<br>
example, to select normal soft tissue to be largely<br>
transparent, contrasted vessels to be slightly opaque and bones<br>
to be very opaque. Preferable central projections may be<br>
attained, by way of example, by "surface shaded display" (SSD)<br>
or by "perspective volume rendering" (pVR) (or else "virtual<br>
endoscopy") . Accordingly, there is the SSD or else the pSSD<br>
used in virtual endoscopy.<br>
SSD is threshold-based surface display, where a pixel is<br>
prescribed by prescribing a pixel value in the form of a<br>
threshold. For every search beam through the present 3D data<br>
volume, that pixel is determined at which the prescribed pixel<br>
value in the form of a threshold value is reached or exceeded<br>
for the first time as seen by the observer. One basic<br>
difference between SSD and VR is that in the case of SSD only<br>
one threshold is defined, but the surface is displayed opaque.<br>
In the case of VR, on the other hand, a plurality of threshold<br>
regions are defined and these are assigned colors and<br>
transparencies. "Virtual endoscopy" is intended to permit a<br>
perspective view of the close surroundings of the virtual<br>
"endoscope head". Unlike in the case of the actual endoscope,<br>
structures can be observed from different directions and while<br>
moving. "Fly throughs", which are intended to give the<br>
impression of a virtual flight through the VOI, are possible.<br>
This is not only esthetic and instructive, but also may be of<br>
diagnostic value. In particular, a "vessel view" method can be<br>
used to render the interior of an evaluation volume visible.<br><br>
For a parallel projection, a "maximum intensity projection"<br>
(MIP) or generally the "volume rendering" (VR) is particularly<br>
suitable. In the case of an MIP, the pixel with the highest CT<br>
value is determined in the projection direction along the<br>
search beam. In that case, the pixel value thus corresponds to<br>
the maximum CT value on the search beam. In the case of the VR,<br>
not just a single pixel is chosen for each individual search<br>
beam coming from the observer's eye, but rather all CT values<br>
along the search beam can, with suitable weighting, deliver a<br>
pixel as a contribution to the resulting image. Freely<br>
selectable and interactively alterable transfer functions are<br>
used to assign opacity and color to each pixel value. It is<br>
thus possible, by way of example, to select normal soft tissue<br>
to be largely transparent, contrasted vessels to be slightly<br>
opaque and bones to be very opaque.<br>
A prerequisite for image display in virtual endoscopy is<br>
normally a statement relating to an observer path. Such an<br>
observer path is also called a flight path or a center line.<br>
The observer path corresponds in practice to the path which is<br>
taken by a virtual endoscope head and along which a perspective<br>
view of the close surroundings is reproduced. In this case, the<br>
problem frequently arises that a body part to be examined in<br>
the VOI is split into a plurality of evaluation volumes. In<br>
that case, there is no continuous observer path through the<br>
VOI. Rather, it is necessary to provide an observer path in the<br>
first evaluation volume and then to change to a second<br>
evaluation volume, with an observer path then needing to be<br>
provided again there. Such a situation may arise, by way of<br>
example, when a tubular formation in the VOI, for example a<br>
colon, a cisterna or a bronchial system, has a restriction or a<br>
closure or is interrupted in another way, for example is not<br>
filled with contrast agent, or other circumstances lead to the<br>
tubular body part on which the endoscope is to be used not<br>
being in the form of a single complete evaluation volume. In<br>
this regard, a user of the usual method who is examining a<br><br>
patient normally needs to find the respective first and second<br>
evaluation volume and to define the conditions, e.g. a starting<br>
point, for an observer path from the very beginning. In that<br>
case, the examiner needs to use a large part of his time to<br>
find all evaluation volumes in order to examine the entire VOI.<br>
A new observer path needs to be provided in every single<br>
evaluation volume. This costs time and results in the "fly<br>
through" needing to be interrupted or even parts of the VOI not<br>
being examined.<br>
It would be desirable for a virtual endoscopy to involve a VOI<br>
being examined as reliably and completely as possible.<br>
This is the starting point for the invention, whose object is<br>
to specify a method of virtual endoscopy and a corresponding<br>
apparatus which can be used to perform a virtual endoscopy<br>
particularly simply and reliably. In particular, an observer<br>
path should be determined in a particularly expedient fashion,<br>
even if a number of evaluation volumes make up the VOI.<br>
The object is achieved for the method by an initially mentioned<br>
method of virtual endoscopy for medical 3D image display and<br>
processing which also has the following method step:<br>
- automatic ascertainment of at least one further evaluation<br>
volume, which is separate from the first evaluation volume,<br>
on the basis of the 3D data volume according to predetermined<br>
criteria.<br>
In this context, the invention is based on the consideration<br>
that when a first evaluation volume in the VOI is provided the<br>
characteristic features of the evaluation volume are already<br>
defined, at any rate are sufficiently well known. These may be<br>
geometric or medical features. Such features can be used, on<br>
the basis of the recognition of the invention, as predetermined<br>
criteria for automatically ascertaining at least one further<br>
evaluation volume on the basis of the 3D data volume. The<br><br>
examiner thus does not himself need to search for all<br>
evaluation volumes in order to prepare a complete image of the<br>
VOI. In particular, the concept proposed here has the advantage<br>
that this basis allows largely automatic calculation of the<br>
observer path through the complete VOI, even if the latter is<br>
in the form of a number of separate evaluation volumes. The<br>
same applies to a single evaluation volume which, although it<br>
is present in its entirety, has a geometry which is curved or<br>
bent or provided with other drastic changes of direction such<br>
that it is normally not possible to indicate a continual<br>
observer path through the VOI immediately.<br>
A first and a further evaluation volume are thus also<br>
understood to mean a first region and a further region of a<br>
cohesive VOI in which the first region and the further region<br>
are separated from one another, e.g. by a drastic restriction<br>
or constriction, to the extent that an examiner in practice has<br>
a first evaluation volume and a further evaluation volume<br>
available for a screen examination.<br>
An evaluation volume is normally in the form of a tubular<br>
formation, as can often be found for a colon, a cisterna or a<br>
bronchial system.<br>
Advantageous developments of the invention can be found in the<br>
subclaims and specifically indicate advantageous options for<br>
advantageously implementing the method in line with the<br>
explained concept.<br>
Preferably, a further observer path is provided through the at<br>
least one further evaluation volume. This allows, in practice,<br>
complete automatic calculation of an observer path through a<br>
number of evaluation volumes which are each there separately,<br>
that is to say even for the case in which a continuous observer<br>
path cannot be found between all evaluation volumes or can be<br>
found only under difficult circumstances. One development thus<br><br>
has provision, in particular, for automatic ascertainment for<br>
the case in which along the observer path the observer path<br>
allows a boundary to be identified for the evaluation volume.<br>
Calculation of the observer path in line with the proposed<br>
concept may preferably be effected, in a first variant, through<br>
automatic ascertainment before the actual 3D image display and<br>
processing along the observer path. Alternatively or in<br>
addition, in a second variant, automatic ascertainment of the<br>
observer path may also be effected during the actual 3D image<br>
display and processing along the observer path.<br>
In the case of the first variant, the observer path is<br>
determined by the "center line" within the context of an<br>
advance calculation. In the case of the second variant, the<br>
observer path is calculated as a "center line" during the "fly<br>
through", for example under the assumption that the "maximum<br>
visibility" corresponds to the desired direction of flight. In<br>
that case, online calculation of the observer path is thus<br>
involved.<br>
In both cases, there is provision for automatic ascertainment<br>
of at least one further evaluation volume for the case in which<br>
during or upon the actual 3D image display and processing along<br>
the observer path of the first evaluation volume the observer<br>
path allows a boundary to be identified for the first<br>
evaluation volume.<br>
Preferably, the at least one further evaluation volume is<br>
automatically ascertained starting from an orientation point or<br>
boundary for the observer path in the first evaluation volume.<br>
In this case, an orientation point is to be understood, in<br>
particular, to mean a point from which a boundary for the first<br>
evaluation volume can be identified. In line with this<br>
development, there is thus automatic ascertainment from a<br><br>
position in the first evaluation volume at which the observer<br>
path in the first evaluation volume ends in practice.<br>
It has been found that an observer path is defined particularly<br>
well only if the VOI, that is to say normally a tubular<br>
structure, is filled completely with contrast agent, for<br>
example in the form of an inert gas such as ambient air or CO2,<br>
or with water. An unforeseen restriction, or break in the VOI<br>
into individual evaluation volumes is frequently the case with<br>
a body which is to be examined and which is normally moving<br>
(breathing movement, muscular movement, blood circulation,<br>
operations), so that it is no longer readily possible to<br>
calculate an observer path.<br>
Accordingly, within the context of one particularly preferred<br>
development, the entire VOI with all, particularly contrast-<br>
agent-filled, components is first of all visited, particularly<br>
automatically. The entire VOI is then preferably segmented into<br>
its components. Suitable selection of a component allows a<br>
first evaluation volume to be determined particularly<br>
expediently. Automatic ascertainment of at least one further<br>
evaluation volume is preferably supported by interactive<br>
selection or deselection of evaluation volumes which have not<br>
been recorded or which have been recorded incorrectly.<br>
Further developments of the invention make provision for<br>
further aids to assist the examiner within the context of the<br>
concept.<br>
Preferably, there is provision for production of an assessment<br>
of the at least one further evaluation volume and of an<br>
assessment of options in this regard according to the<br>
predetermined criteria. The further evaluation volume found<br>
according to geometric and/or medical criteria naturally<br>
corresponds to such criteria to a greater or lesser extent.<br>
Such correspondence can be quantified within the context of an<br><br>
assessment. It is thus possible to indicate, by way of example,<br>
how high the likelihood is that the further evaluation volume,<br>
like the first evaluation volume, belongs to the same VOI, i.e.<br>
to the same body part that is to be examined, e.g. a large<br>
intestine.<br>
Preferably, the examiner is provided with a number of further<br>
evaluation volumes and options in this regard for selection.<br>
This has the advantage that the examiner is able, for example<br>
as part of a menu selection, to make a reliable decision about<br>
the type of further selection options.<br>
Preferably, the number of further evaluation volumes and<br>
options in this regard is sorted using the predetermined<br>
criteria. By way of example, the number of further evaluation<br>
volumes can be sorted using decreasing likelihood.<br>
Examples of preferable predetermined criteria are geometric<br>
criteria, particularly relating to the size, the orientation<br>
and the shape of the evaluation volume. If a further evaluation<br>
volume has more or less the same properties as a first<br>
evaluation volume in terms of these criteria, then the<br>
likelihood is very high that it is the same VOI, that is to say<br>
the same body part which is to be examined.<br>
In addition, it is possible to indicate medical criteria for<br>
producing the assessment, particularly relating to the type and<br>
surface condition of the evaluation volume. By way of example,<br>
the surface condition of an intestinal wall has a<br>
characteristic form in comparison with that of other parts of<br>
the body.<br>
Preferably, the observer path is provided on the basis of an<br>
observer position and a path direction. Starting from an<br>
observer position, the virtual endoscopy can be effected along<br>
a path direction until a rectilinear observer path arising in<br><br>
this manner leads to the boundary of an evaluation volume.<br>
Should a boundary be in "sight", then either automatic<br>
ascertainment of at least one further evaluation volume or a<br>
change of direction can take place.<br>
The method has been found to be particularly expedient for use<br>
in medical image display and processing of images, particularly<br>
of computer tomography or magnetic resonance images, of a<br>
colon, that is to say in colonoscopy. The concept has likewise<br>
been found to be advantageous for medical image display and<br>
processing of images, particularly of computer tomography or<br>
magnetic resonance images of a bronchial tree, that is to say<br>
in bronchoscopy. The claimed method is likewise advantageous<br>
for image display and processing of images, particularly of<br>
computer tomography or magnetic resonance images, of a<br>
cisterna, that is to say in cisternoscopy.<br>
As regards the apparatus, the invention provides a computer<br>
tomograph or a magnetic resonance tomograph which has control<br>
elements for the method steps of the method in line with the<br>
concept explained above.<br>
In addition, the invention provides a workstation for image<br>
display and processing of computer tomography or magnetic<br>
resonance images which has control elements for the method<br>
steps of the method in accordance with the concept explained<br>
above.<br>
Accordingly, a computer program product for image display and<br>
processing of computer tomography or magnetic resonance images<br>
has program modules for the method steps of the method in<br>
accordance with the concept explained above.<br>
Exemplary embodiments of the invention are described below with<br>
reference to the drawing in comparison with the prior art, some<br>
of which is likewise shown. Specifically, in the accompanying drawing:<br><br>
figure 1 shows an ordinary procedure, shown by way of example,<br>
for determining an observer path through a VOI with a<br>
number of evaluation volumes;<br>
figure 2 shows a preferred embodiment of a procedure for<br>
determining an observer path through a VOI with a<br>
number of evaluation volumes; and<br>
figure 3 shows a diagrammatic flowchart of a preferred<br>
embodiment of the method.<br>
Figure 1 shows an ordinary procedure for prescribing an<br>
observer path as part of a method of virtual endoscopy. In the<br>
present case, the explanation is given using the example of<br>
image display and processing of computer tomography images of a<br>
colon, that is to say using the example of a virtual<br>
endoluminal colonoscopy.<br>
Figure 1 shows a volume of interest (VOI) 1 with a first<br>
evaluation volume 3 and further evaluation volumes 5, 7, 9. The<br>
evaluation volumes 3, 5, 7, 9 are parts of a colon on the basis<br>
of a 3D data volume indicated in the form of a coordinate<br>
cross. Although the VOI 1 is a tubular body part which needs to<br>
be examined in total, namely in the present case the large<br>
intestine as one part of the colon, the VOI 1 is presented to<br>
the examiner during the screen examination in a winding form<br>
such that it is not possible to find a continuous observer<br>
path. The first evaluation volume 3 is separated from the<br>
second evaluation volume 5 by a bend 11, for example. The<br>
curvature in the region of the bend 11 is so great that it is<br>
not possible to find a continuous path between the first<br>
evaluation volume 3 and the second evaluation volume 5. An<br>
observer path 13 defined in the course of an advance<br>
calculation hits the end point 15 at the boundary of the first,<br>
evaluation volume 3. The examiner is therefore forced to<br><br>
indicate a new observer path 17 in the form of a new observer<br>
position 19 and of a new path direction 21 in the second<br>
evaluation volume 5. To do this, he first needs to find the<br>
second evaluation volume 5. In practice, the end point 15 marks<br>
the end of the observer path 13 in the first evaluation volume<br>
3.<br>
The second evaluation volume 5 has been pressed together in the<br>
region of a lesion 23 to form a closure 25. This means that the<br>
further observer path 17 also hits the boundary of the second<br>
evaluation volume 5 at the end point 27. Again, the examiner<br>
needs to find a third evaluation volume 7 and to indicate a new<br>
observer path 2 9 in the form of an observer position 31 and a<br>
path direction 33. Disadvantageously, a region 35 of the third<br>
evaluation volume 7 remains unexamined in this case, during the<br>
flight for the virtual endoscopy the new observer path 2 9 is<br>
respectively continued at the points 37 by a maximum visibility<br>
in the same direction of flight 33. In the present case, the<br>
endoluminal view of the third evaluation volume 7 is thus<br>
produced in the course of an online calculation of the observer<br>
path 29.<br>
The observer path 29 again hits the boundary of the third<br>
evaluation volume 7 at an end point 39. In the present case,<br>
this is caused by a restriction 41 in the VOI 1 as a result of<br>
a muscle 43. A restriction might also be caused by too little<br>
contrast agent. For this reason, it is again necessary to<br>
indicate a new observer path 45 in the fourth evaluation volume<br>
9 in the form of an observer position 47 and a path direction<br>
49.<br>
The outlined procedure is found to be difficult, time-consuming<br>
and at the same time unreliable in the case of the virtual<br>
endoscopy, since it is possible for regions 35 to escape<br>
examination, for example. This applies equally to a colonoscopy<br>
which is shown here, but also similarly to the virtual<br><br>
endoscopy in the region of the bronchoscopy and cisternoscopy<br>
or in other regions.<br>
One preferred embodiment of the concept proposed here for a<br>
method of virtual endoscopy is outlined using the same example<br>
of a large intestine as part of a colon and as VOI in figure 2.<br>
In this case, the same parts of the figure have been provided<br>
with the same reference symbols.<br>
In line with the particularly preferred embodiment, a first<br>
evaluation volume 3 of the large intestine is provided on the<br>
basis of a 3D data volume 10, and an observer path 51 is<br>
prescribed through the first evaluation volume 3. The observer<br>
path is prescribed preferably automatically and with the aid of<br>
a computer. If appropriate, the automatic prescribing is based<br>
on a statement by the examiner, e.g. relating to a starting<br>
point 50 and a direction 54 for the observer path 51. In this<br>
respect, the examiner is provided with an observer path 51. At<br>
an orientation point 53, the observer path 51 allows a boundary<br>
55 for the evaluation volume 3 to be identified. Normally, such<br>
an orientation point would be the end of an observer path 51 in<br>
practice. A similar situation arises for the second evaluation<br>
volume 5, for the third evaluation volume 7 and for the fourth<br>
evaluation volume 9, which is why the corresponding orientation<br>
points 53 and boundaries 55 are identified using the same<br>
reference symbols.<br>
In the regions 57, 57' and 57' (identified symbolically by<br>
frames) of the VOI 1, at least one further evaluation volume is<br>
therefore automatically ascertained on the basis of the 3D data<br>
volume 10 according to predetermined criteria. In the region 57<br>
of the first evaluation volume 3, the second evaluation volume<br>
5 is ascertained automatically. In this case, the predetermined<br>
criteria are primarily medical criteria, since the second<br>
evaluation volume 5 is found to be equivalent to the first<br>
evaluation volume 3 in terms of the type and surface condition.<br><br>
The examiner can interactively prescribe a further observer<br>
path 59 or can have a further observer path prescribed<br>
automatically through the second evaluation volume 5 . In this<br>
case, by way of example, the examiner can make a graphical<br>
selection of the evaluation volume 5 from a list of options.<br>
In the region 57' of the second evaluation volume 5, a third<br>
evaluation volume 7 is ascertained automatically, although the<br>
closure 25 means that it is not possible to find a continuous<br>
path. Geometric criteria relating to size, orientation and<br>
shape of the evaluation volume 7 mean that the latter is<br>
identified as being associated with the same VOI 1 as the<br>
second evaluation volume 5. In this case, the examiner can<br>
select a new observer path A, for example, which in practice<br>
keeps the same orientation 61 in the second evaluation volume<br>
5, in the third evaluation volume 7 and in the fourth<br>
evaluation volume 9. In addition, it is also possible for the<br>
examiner to have a computer indicate to him a new observer path<br>
B in the third evaluation volume 7 which is better suited to<br>
the closure 25.<br>
In this context, both the observer path A and the observer path<br>
B can be provided as part of an advance calculation (described<br>
above) or as part of an online calculation (described above).<br>
The situation explained is repeated in similar fashion in the<br>
region 57 ' ' between the third evaluation volume 7 and the<br>
fourth evaluation volume 9. In the region 57 ' ' , the fourth<br>
evaluation volume 9 is automatically ascertained on the basis<br>
of predetermined geometric and/or medical criteria. The<br>
examiner is able to prescribe a further new observer path 63<br>
for the fourth evaluation volume 9 or to have one indicated to<br>
him.<br>
Should the examiner incorrectly be provided with the muscle 43<br>
as a selectable option for an evaluation volume, for example,<br><br>
then the muscle 43 would nevertheless automatically be assessed<br>
with a much lower likelihood in the course of the method on<br>
account of its geometric and medical properties which differ<br>
greatly from those of the third evaluation volume 7 and those<br>
of the fourth evaluation volume 9. It would also be possible to<br>
provide an examiner with part 52 of a small intestine as an<br>
option for a further evaluation volume. In line with the<br>
proposed method, the part 52 of the small intestine is assessed<br>
with a low likelihood on account of its geometric situation<br>
(since it is not on the same axis as the evaluation volume 7,<br>
9) and the fact that no end of the part 52 indicates a closure.<br>
In addition, the part 52 as part of the small intestine does<br>
not have a start and has a different diameter than the<br>
evaluation volumes 7, 9, which are part of the large intestine<br>
of interest (VOI) . In this case, an examiner would thus be<br>
provided with the fourth evaluation volume 9 for selection with<br>
highest priority and would be provided with the muscle 43 and<br>
the part 52 of the small intestine for selection with a<br>
negligibly small degree of likelihood, if at all. Suitable<br>
sorting carried out on the basis of the assessment means the<br>
examiner is thus able to select the fourth evaluation volume 9<br>
correctly as part of the VOI 1 reliably and quickly.<br>
Figure 3 schematically shows a flowchart of a particularly<br>
preferred embodiment of the method of virtual endoscopy. After<br>
the start of the method 71, a 3D data volume is provided in<br>
method step 73 and the 3D data volume is taken as a basis for<br>
providing a first evaluation volume in method step 75. The<br>
virtual endoscope is positioned automatically in the evaluation<br>
volume. This can be done using a 3D data volume 10 as shown in<br>
figure 2 and a first evaluation volume 3, for example. The<br>
software, possibly on the basis of the statements by an<br>
examiner, e.g. relating to observer position and path<br>
direction, then prescribes an observer path through the first<br>
evaluation volume in method step 77. This may be a first<br>
observer path 51 shown in figure 2, for example.<br><br>
In the case of the embodiment shown in figure 3, method step 79<br>
checks whether a boundary can be identified for the evaluation<br>
volume. This may be a boundary 55 shown in figure 2, for<br>
example, which is identified at an orientation point 53. If a<br>
boundary is not identified, then the original observer path is<br>
followed further as part of the "fly through" in the branch N.<br>
If a boundary is identified, the branch Y is followed. This<br>
results in at least one further evaluation volume being<br>
ascertained automatically on the basis of the 3D data volume<br>
according to predetermined criteria. This step is carried out,<br>
by way of example, in the regions 57, 57' and 57' ' shown in<br>
figure 2 by automatically ascertaining the further evaluation<br>
volumes 5, 7, 9. In method cycle 70, this process is shown by<br>
method step 81. If a number amounting to a plurality of<br>
evaluation volumes is ascertained, these are assessed in a<br>
method step 83 and are sorted in a method step 85 using a<br>
falling assessment. In the case of the particularly preferred<br>
embodiment of a method cycle 70 which is shown in figure 3,<br>
sorting takes place such that the evaluation volumes assessed<br>
as having high likelihood are shown before the evaluation<br>
volumes assessed as having low likelihood. An examiner is thus<br>
actually provided with a sequentially falling, presorted<br>
selection of evaluation volumes in a method step 87, with the<br>
evaluation volume having the highest likelihood being shown in<br>
first place. The selection can be made either in list form or<br>
as a graphical representation of the optional evaluation<br>
volumes (e.g. 7, 9, 52, 43) or of orientation points 53 or<br>
boundary 55, for example. The examiner can abort the method in<br>
method step 89 if he considers this to be expedient. Otherwise,<br>
he can continue the method with method step 91 through<br>
interactive or automatic selection of a further observer path<br>
in the further evaluation volume. By way of example, the<br>
further observer path used may be an observer path 59, A, B, 63<br>
in figure 2.<br><br>
The method continues in a loop in which a check for a boundary<br>
for the evaluation volume is carried out again for a new<br>
observer path.<br>
