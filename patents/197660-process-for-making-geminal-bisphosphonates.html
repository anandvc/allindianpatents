				<td>PROCESS FOR MAKING GEMINAL BISPHOSPHONATES<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a novel process for making geminal bisphosphonates. The process provides for bisphosphorylation using phosphorus trihalide, molten phosphorous acid as a reactant/solvent, and a base as an acid acceptor/solvent.<br>
CROSS REFERENCE<br>
This application claims priority under Title 35, United States Code 119(e) from Provisional Application Serial No. 60/179,506, filed February 1,2000.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
8. Polyphosphonic acids and their pharmaceutically-acceptable salts have been proposed for.<br>
use in the treatment of diseases of bone and calcium metabolism. Such diseases include<br>
osteoporosis, hyperparathyroidism, hypercalcemia of malignancy, ostolytic bone metastases,<br>
myosistis ossifcans progressiva, calcinoisis universalis, arthritis, neuritis, bursitis, tendonitis and<br>
other inflammatory conditions. In particular bisphosphonates, like ethane- 1-hydroxy-1,1-<br>
diphosphonic acid (EHDP), propane-3-amimo-l-hydroxy-l,l-diphosphonic acid (APD),<br>
dichloromethane diphosphonic acid (C12MDP), 3-amino-l-hydroxy-propylidene-diphosphonic<br>
acid.	(PAMIDRONATE), 4-amino-l-hydroxybutylidene-l,l-bisphosphonic acid<br>
(ALENDRONATE) and l-hydroxy-2-(3-pyridinyl)ethylidene-l,l- bisphosphonic acid (RISEDRONATE) have been the subject of considerable research efforts in this area. Paget's disease and heterotropic ossification are currently successfully treated with EHDP. The diphosphonates tend to inhibit the resorption of bone tissue, which is beneficial to patients suffering from excessive bone loss. However, in spite of certain analogies in activity, bisphosphonates do not exhibit the same degree of activity and some have serious drawbacks with respect to the degree of toxicity in animals and the tolerabiliry or the negative side effects in humans.<br>
Several methods for making bisphosphonates have been disclosed.    For example, European Patent Application 0 494 644, Institute Gentili and PCT application WO96/33199<br>
disclose methods for making amino-bisphosphonates. However, just as there are differences in the activities of the different bisphosphonates, so too are there differences in the method of making these compounds. Depending on the reaction conditions, the viscosity of the reaction mixture and/or the formation of large amounts of elemental phosphorus by- products limit the scale on which the bisphosphorylation reaction can be readily carried out.<br>
It is therefore desirable to use a scaleable process to produce geminal bisphosphonates that achieves high yields with little residual elemental phosphorous by-products and that can be safely practiced on the commercial scale.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to a process for making geminal bisphosphonates of the general formula:<br>
(FormulaRemoved) <br>

The bisphosphorylation step of the present process invention is conducted such that the corresponding aminocarboxylic acid is dissolved in molten phosphorous acid and reacted with phosphorus trihalide in the presence of a base, where the base is preferably morpholine or pyridine. The reaction is carried out in the temperature range between about 45°C to about 90°C, preferably between about 55°C to about 90°C, more preferably between about 55°C to about 85° C, and most preferably between about 60°C to about 75°C. The process described herein is readily adapted to industrial production.<br>
Without a solvent, such as excess phosphorous acid, and a base the reaction mixture would be very viscous. The phosphorous acid and bases added in the process act as a solvent to give a uniform reaction mixture or solution. The amount of phosphorus trihalide added in relation to the aminocarboxylic acid is from about 1.7 equivalent to about 2.5 equivalents, preferably about 2 equivalents. The amount of phosphorous acid and phosphorus trihalide should be controlled to avoid the formation of pyrophoric elemental phosphorus. Phosphorus trichloride reacts with phosphorous acid under the reaction conditions consuming some of the phosphorus trichloride and liberating hydrochloric acid gas. Generally, the amount of phosphorous acid added in relation to the amiocarboxylic acid is from about 1.5 to about 6 equivalents, preferably from about 2 to about 6 equivalents, more preferably from about 2 to about 5.5 equivalents, most preferably 5 equivalents. The base is added in an amount appropriate to achieve the desired viscosity. The amount of base added in relation to the phosphorous acid is from about 0.2 to 0.8 equivalents, more preferably from about 0.4 to about 0.6 equivalents. The process described herein is readily adapted to industrial production.<br>
This process is illustrated by the following general scheme:<br>

The bisphosphonates of the present invention are generally more biologically potent in<br>
inhibiting bone resorption. Thus, the compositions of the present invention allow for greater<br>
flexibility in dosage administration and dosing intervals. For example, the compositions of the<br>
present invention, . including oral compositions, may be dosed, daily, weekly, biweekly or<br>
monthly.	.<br><br><br><br><br>

a)	providing an aminocarboxylic acid;<br>
b)	dissolving the aminocarboxylic acid in phosphorous acid; and<br>
c)	reacting the solution of step b) with phosphorus trihalide in the presence of a base.<br><br>
2.	The process of Claim 1 characterized in that the base is selected from the group consisting of<br>
N,N-diisopropylethylamine,     triethylamine,    trimethylamine,    4-dimethylaminopyridine,<br>
pyridine, potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, potassium bicarbonate, sodium bicarbonate,<br>
and morpholine.<br>
3.	The process according to any of the preceding claims characterized in that the phosphorus<br>
trihalide  is  selected  from  the  group  comprising  phosphorus  oxychloride,  phosphorus<br>
oxybromide, phosphorus tribromide or phosphorus trichloride.<br>
5.	The process according to any of the preceding claims characterized in that the phosphorous<br>
acid is heated from 45°C to 95 °C until molten. The process according to any of the preceding claims characterized in that the ratio of<br>
phosphorus trihalide to aminocarboxylic acid is from 1.7 to 3 equivalents.<br>
6.	The process according to any of the preceding claims characterized in that the ratio of<br>
phosphorous acid to aminocarboxylic acid is from 1.5 to 6 equivalents.<br>
7.	The process according to any of the preceding claims characterized in that the ratio of base to<br>
phosphorous acid is from 0.2 to 0.8 equivalents.<br>
8.	The process according to any of the preceding claims characterized in that the phosphorous<br>
acid is heated from 55°C to 85 °C until molten.<br>
9.	The process according to any of the preceding claims characterized in that the geminal<br>
bisphosphonate is selected from the group comprising l-hydroxy-2-(3-pyridinyl)ethylidine<br>
bisphosphonic   acid,  4-amino-l-hydroxybutylidene-l,l-bisphonic   acid,   and   (3-amino-l-<br>
hydroxy-propylidene)-diphosphonic acid.<br>
10.	The process according to any of the preceding claims characterized in that the phosphorus<br>
