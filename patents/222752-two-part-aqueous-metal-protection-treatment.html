				<td>TWO-PART AQUEOUS METAL PROTECTION TREATMENT<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to metal protection compositions. More<br>
particularly, the present invention relates to two-part coating compositions for protecting<br>
metals, methods for applying two-part coating composition to metals and metals having the<br>
two-part coating composition.<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
Many methods and composition for protecting metal surfaces exposed to air<br>
and water, including salt water, are currently in use. Methods for preparing metal surfaces for<br>
subsequent uses, such as applications of adhesives are also known. Generally, before a<br>
primer or other coating is applied to a metal surface, it is desirable to treat a bare metal<br>
surface to prevent corrosion. It is well known that metal surfaces are subject to corrosion and<br>
degradation. A known process for treating metal surfaces before the application of primer or<br>
other coatings is phosphating or conversion coating, a procedure by which a water-insoluble<br>
film of metal phosphate and/or metal oxide is formed on the metal surface by treatment with<br>
an acid such phosphoric acid or acid phosphate salts. The conversion coating can also<br>
include resins, such as phenolic based resins to improve corrosion resistance. U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,011,551 relates to a metal conversion coating composition that includes an aliphatic<br>
alcohol, phosphoric acid, an alkali nitrate, tannic acid and zinc nitrate. U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,293,349 relates to a steel surface protective coating composition that includes pyrogallic<br>
acid glucoside, phosphoric acid, phosphates of bivalent transition metals such as Zn or Mn,<br>
Zn or Mn nitrate, and, optionally, formaldehyde.<br>
Coatings that form by autodeposition are also generally known in the art. An<br>
autodeposition composition generally includes an aqueous solution of an acid, an oxidizing<br>
agent and a dispersed resin. Immersion of a metallic surface in an autodeposition<br>
composition produces what is said to be a self-limiting protective coating on a metal<br>
substrate. The general principles and advantages of autodeposition are explained in a<br>
multitude of patents assigned to Parker Amchem and/or Henkel (see, for example, U.S.<br>
Patents No. 4,414,350; 4,994,521; 5,427,863; 5,061,523 and 5,500,460).<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,691,048 includes phosphoric acid in a list for possible acids<br>
in an autodepositing composition, but hydrofluoric acid is the preferred acid. This patent also<br>
lists hydrogen peroxide, chromic acid, potassium dichromate, nitric acid, sodium nitrate,<br>
sodium persulfate, ammonium persulfate, sodium perborate and ferric fluoride as possible<br>
oxidizing agents. Hydrogen peroxide and ferric fluoride are preferred.<br>
The use of accelerating agents, including oxidizing and reducing accelerators<br>
to accelerate the deposition of the conversion coating is also known. See, e.g., Freeman,<br>
Phospliating and Metal Pretreatment, Industrial Press Inc., 1986, pages 19 to 25. The<br>
accelerating agents are believed to increase the rate of deposition by reacting with hydrogen<br>
formed on the metal surface during attack by acid, thus, preventing polarization of the treated<br>
metal. The use of accelerators is also disclosed in e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 4,149,909;<br>
5,427,632; and 5,711,996. The oxidizers disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,691,048 are also used<br>
as accelerators.<br>
The use of some accelerators in applications that involve the application of a<br>
subsequent coating, such as a primer coating can cause blister formation which results in<br>
decreased corrosion resistance and cosmetic defects. Also, the use of high levels of<br>
accelerators in metal treatment conversion coatings can cause application difficulties with the<br>
conversion coating.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
One object of the invention is to overcome the disadvantages of the known art<br>
described above. Another object of the invention is to provide a metal treatment composition<br>
and method that avoids or reduces blister formation upon application of a protective coating<br>
on a metal surface that has been previously subjected to a conversion coating metal treatment.<br>
Yet another objective of the invention is to reduce and even eliminate the need for<br>
accelerators in the metal treatment conversion coating prior to the application of a protective<br>
coating.<br>
There has been provided according to one aspect of the invention a two-part<br>
metal protection composition that includes: an aqueous metal treatment conversion coating<br>
component that includes an admixture of an acid and a coating forming component; and an<br>
aqueous protective coating component that is applied over metal treated with the aqueous<br>
metal treatment conversion coating component and includes an admixture of a blister<br>
suppressing agent and an organic film forming protective component. The aqueous metal<br>
treatment conversion coating component may contain an accelerator, such as hydroxylamine.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the blister suppressing agent is an organic oxidizing agent that<br>
includes one or more of nitroguanidine; aromatic nitrosulfonates, Naphthol Yellow S; and<br>
picric acid (trinitrophenol).<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, there has been provided a<br>
method for treating a metallic surface that includes: (a) applying an aqueous metal treatment<br>
conversion coating component that includes an admixture of an acid and a coating forming<br>
component; and (b) applying an aqueous protective coating component to the surface that has<br>
at least been partially treated with the aqueous metal treatment conversion coating component<br>
and includes an admixture of a blister suppressing agent and an organic film forming<br>
protective component. The aqueous metal treatment conversion coating component may<br>
further include an accelerator.<br>
According to still another aspect of the invention, there has been provided a<br>
method for bonding an elastomeric substrate surface to a metallic substrate surface that<br>
includes: (a) applying an aqueous metal treatment conversion coating component to the<br>
surface wherein the aqueous metal treatment conversion coating component includes an<br>
admixture of an acid and a coating forming component; (b) applying an aqueous coating or<br>
primer composition to the surface that has at least been partially treated with the aqueous<br>
metal treatment conversion coating component and includes an admixture of a blister<br>
suppressing agent and an organic film forming protective component; and (c) applying an<br>
adhesive overcoat to effect bonding of the metallic substrate to the elastomeric substrate. The<br>
aqueous metal treatment conversion coating component may further include an accelerator.<br>
Further objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become<br>
apparent from consideration of the preferred embodiments which follows.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
As used herein, all percentages are weight percentages based on the total dry<br>
weight of the composition. Dry weight being the total amount of solids in the system,<br>
excluding water. For example, for 10 grams of 85% phosphoric acid would have S.5 grams<br>
of solids. Unless otherwise indicated herein, all measurements, such as pH, are taken at room<br>
temperature, i.e., 25°C.<br>
The present invention is directed to a two-part metal protection system. The<br>
first part of the system includes an aqueous metal treatment conversion coating component.<br>
As used herein, "conversion coating" is defined as a treatment of a metal substrate with a<br>
liquid that results in the surface layer of the metal substrate being chemically altered to form a<br>
protective layer.<br>
The first component of the aqueous metal treatment conversion coating<br>
component includes an acid. The acid can be any acid that is capable of reacting with a metal<br>
to generate multivalent ions of that metal. Illustrative acids include hydrofluoric acid,<br>
phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, phosphonic acid, phosphorous acid, organo-<br>
phosphonic acids, organo-phosphorous acid, organo-phosphonate acid hypophosphorous acid,<br>
inorganic and organic phosphoric acid esters and nitric acid. In the case of steel the<br>
multivalent ions will be ferric and/or ferrous ions. Aqueous solutions of phosphoric acid are<br>
preferred. When the acid is mixed into the composition the respective ions are formed and<br>
exist as independent species in addition to the presence of the free acid. In other words, in the<br>
case of phosphoric acid, phosphate ions and free phosphoric acid co-exist in the formulated<br>
final multi-component composition. The acid preferably is present in an amount of 10-90<br>
wt% preferably 25-50 wt%, based on the dry weight of the metal treatment conversion<br>
coating component.<br>
The aqueous metal treatment conversion coating component also includes a<br>
coating forming component. The coating forming component can be organic or inorganic and<br>
is used to fix free acid to the surface during processing. Examples of inorganic coating<br>
forming components include ions of zinc, manganese, chromium, sodium, cadmium, copper,<br>
lead, calcium, cobalt, nickel, borate, sililcates, titanates, and sol-gels.<br>
The coating forming component is preferably an organic component. A<br>
preferred organic component includes a phenolic compound. "Phenolic compound" is<br>
defined as a compound that includes at least one hydroxy functional group attached to a<br>
carbon atom of an aromatic ring. Phenolic compounds can also include resins that include<br>
phenolic monomer units. Illustrative phenolic compounds include unsubstituted phenol per<br>
se, substituted phenols such as alkylated phenols and multi-hydroxy phenols, and hydroxy-<br>
substituted multi-ring aromatics. Illustrative alkylated phenols include methylphenol (also<br>
known as cresol), dimethylphenol (also known as xylenol), 2-ethylphenol, pentylphenol and<br>
tert-butyl phenol. Phenolic compounds such as tannic acids can also be used.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the organic component of the metal treatment<br>
conversion coating component includes an autodepositable component. The autodepositable<br>
component is any material that enables (either by itself or in combination with other<br>
components of the metal treatment conversion coating component) the metal treatment<br>
conversion coating component to autodeposit on a metal substrate. Preferably, the<br>
autodepositable component is any water dispersible or water soluble resin that is capable of<br>
providing autodeposition ability to the metal treatment conversion coating component. These <br>
resins include those derived ethylenicially unsaturated monomers such as polyvinylidene<br>
chloride, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene, acrylic, acrylontrile, polyvinyl acetate and styrene-<br>
butadiene (see U.S. Patent Nos. 4,414,350; 4,994,521; and 5,427,863; and PCT published<br>
application no. WO 93/15154). Urethane and polyester resins are also mentioned as being<br>
useful. Certain epoxy and epoxy-acrylate resins are also believed to be useful autodeposition<br>
resins (see U.S. Patent No. 5,500,460 and PCT published application no. WO 97/07163). All<br>
these references are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.<br>
A particularly preferred phenolic compound for autodeposition can include<br>
those disclosed in pending application Serial No. 09/235,201' filed January 22,1999 which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The phenolic compound described in this<br>
application is an aqueous dispersed phenolic novolak resins. This resin is responsible for the<br>
autodeposition characteristic of the metal treatment composition.<br>
The preferred phenolic novolak resin dispersion can be obtained by initially<br>
reacting or mixing a phenolic resin precursor and a modifying agent - theoretically via a<br>
condensation reaction between the phenolic resin precursor and the modifying agent.<br>
One functional moiety of the modifying agent provides the ionic pendant<br>
group that enables stable dispersion of the phenolic resin. Without the ionic pendant group,<br>
the phenolic resin would be unable to maintain a stable dispersion in water. Since the ionic<br>
pendant group provides for the stability of the dispersion there is no need, or at the most a<br>
minimal need, for surfactants. The presence of surfactants in an aqueous composition is a<br>
well-known hindrance to the composition's performance.<br>
The other important functional moiety in the modifying agent enables the<br>
modifying agent to react with the phenolic resin precursor. The modifying agent can contain<br>
more than one ionic pendant group and more than one reaction-enabling moiety.<br>
Incorporation of aromatic sulfonate functional moieties into the phenolic resin<br>
structure via condensation is the preferred method of providing the ionic pendant groups.<br>
Accordingly, one class of ionic moieties are substituents on an aromatic ring that include a<br>
sulfur atom covalently or ionically bonded to a carbon atom of the aromatic ring. Examples<br>
of covalently bound sulfur-containing substituents are sulfonate (-S(O)2O-M+) sulfmate (-<br>
S(O)C-M+), sulfenate (-SO-M+) and oxysulfonate (-OS(O)2O-M+), wherein M can be any<br>
monovalent ion such as Na, Li, K, or NR!3 (wherein R1 is hydrogen or an alkyl). Another<br>
example of a covalently bound substituent is sulfate ion. Sulfonate is the preferred ionic<br>
group. The modifying agent should not include or introduce any multivalent ions into the<br>
phenolic resin dispersion since it is expected that the presence of multivalent ions would<br>
cause the phenolic resin to precipitate rather than remain dispersed.<br>
The reaction-enabling functional moiety of the modifying agent can be any<br>
functional group that provides a site on the modifying agent for undergoing condensation<br>
with a phenolic resin. If the phenolic resin precursor is a resole, the modifying agent reacts<br>
with an alkylol or benzyl ether group of the resole. If the modifying agent is aromatic, the<br>
reaction-enabling functional moiety is a substituent on the aromatic ring that causes a site on<br>
the ring to be reactive to the alkylol or benzyl ether of the resole precursor. An example of<br>
such a substituent is a hydroxy or hydroxyalkyl, with hydroxy being preferred. The hydroxy-<br>
or hydroxyalkyl-substituted aromatic modifying agent is reactive at a site ortho and/or para to<br>
each hydroxy or hydroxyalkyl substituent. In other words, the aromatic modifying agent is<br>
bonded to, or incorporated into, the phenolic resin precursor at sites on the aromatic ring of<br>
the modifying agent that are ortho and/or para to a hydroxy or hydroxyalkyl substituent. At<br>
least two reaction-enabling functional moieties are preferred to enhance the reactivity of the<br>
aromatic modifying agent with the phenolic resin precursor.<br>
Alternatively, the reaction-enabling functional moiety of the modifying agent<br>
can be a formyl group (-CHO), preferably attached to a carbon atom of an aromatic ring. In<br>
this instance, the phenolic resin precursor is a novolak rather than a resole. The novolak<br>
precursor is reacted via an acid catalyzed aldehyde condensation reaction with the formyl<br>
group-containing modifying agent so that the formyl group forms a divalent methylene<br>
linkage to an active site on an aromatic ring of the backbone structure of the novolak<br>
precursor. Consequently, the modifying agent structure (including the ionic moiety) is<br>
incorporated into the phenolic structure through the generated methylene linkage. Examples<br>
of such formyl group-containing modifying agents include 2-formylbenzene sulfonate, 5-<br>
formylfuran sulfonate and (R)(SO3)CH-CH2-C(O)(H) compounds wherein R is C1-C4 alkyl<br>
groups.<br>
Another alternative reaction-enabling functional moiety could be a diazo group<br>
(-N2+), preferably attached to a carbon atom of an aromatic ring. In this instance, the phenolic<br>
resin precursor is a novolak rather than a resole. The novolak precursor is reacted via a diazo<br>
coupling reaction with the diazo group-containing modifying agent so that the diazo group<br>
forms a divalent diazo linkage (-N=) to an active site on an aromatic ring of the backbone<br>
structure of the novolak precursor. Consequently, the modifying agent structure (including<br>
the ionic moiety) is incorporated into the phenolic structure through the diazo linkage. An<br>
example of such diazo modifying agents is l-diazo-2-naphthol-4-sulfonic acid.<br>
The modifying agent also can optionally include a functional moiety that is<br>
capable of chelating with a metal ion that is present on a substrate surface on which the<br>
phenolic resin dispersion is applied. The chelating group remains as a residual group after the<br>
condensation of the phenolic resin precursor and the aromatic modifying agent. Typically,<br>
the chelating group is a substituent on the aromatic ring that is capable of forming a 5- or 6-<br>
membered chelation structure with a metal ion. Examples of such substituents include<br>
hydroxy and hydroxyalkyl, with hydroxy being preferred. At least two such functional groups<br>
must be present on the modifying agent molecule to provide the chelating. In the case of an<br>
aromatic modifying agent, the chelating groups should be located in an ortho position relative<br>
to each other. A significant advantage is that hydroxy or hydroxyalkyl substituents on the<br>
aromatic modifying agent can serve two roles - condensation enablement and subsequent<br>
metal chelating.<br>
An aromatic modifying agent is particularly advantageous. Preferably, the<br>
ionic group and the reaction-enabling moiety are not substituents on the same aromatic ring.<br>
The ionic group, particularly sulfonate, appears to have a strong deactivating effect on<br>
condensation reactions of the ring to which it is attached. Consequently, an ionic group<br>
attached to the same ring as the reaction-enabling moiety would not allow the modifying<br>
agent to readily react with the phenolic resin. However, it should be recognized that this<br>
consideration for the location of the ionic and reaction-enabling moieties is not applicable to<br>
the formyl group-containing modifying agent and diazo modifying agent.<br>
A preferred structure for the aromatic modifying agent is represented by<br>
formulae la or Ib below:<br><br>
wherein X is the ionic group; Y is the reaction-enabling substituent; Z is the chelating<br>
substituent; L1 is a divalent linking group such as an alkylene radical (for example,<br>
methylene) or a diazo (-N=N-); a is 1; b is 1 to 4; m is 0 or 1; and c and d are each<br>
independently 0 to 3, provided there are not more than 4 substituents on each aromatic ring.<br>
If a chelating group Z is present it is positioned ortho to another chelating group Z or to Y. It<br>
should be recognized that the reaction-enabling substituent Y may also act as a chelating<br>
substituent. In this instance, the aromatic modifying agent may not include an independent<br>
chelating substituent Z. An aromatic modifying agent according to formulae la or Ib could<br>
also include other substituents provided they do not adversely interfere with the ionic group<br>
or the condensation reaction.<br>
Illustrative aromatic modifying agents include salts of 6,7-dihydroxy-2-<br>
napthalenesulfonate; 6,7-dihydroxy-l-naphthalenesulfonate; 6,7-dihydroxy-4-<br>
naphthalenesulfonate; Acid Red 88; Acid Alizarin Violet N; Erichrome Black T; Erichrome<br>
Blue Black B; Brilliant Yellow; Crocein Orange G; Biebrich Yellow; and Palatine Chrome<br>
Black 6BN. 6,7-dihydroxy-2-naphthalenesulfonate, sodium salt is the preferred aromatic<br>
modifying agent.<br>
It should be recognized that the preferred sulfonate modification contemplated<br>
herein involves an indirect sulfonation mechanism. In other words, the aromatic modifying<br>
agent includes a sulfonate group and is reacted with another aromatic compound (the phenolic<br>
resin precursor) to obtain the chain extended, sulfonate-modified phenolic resin product. This<br>
indirect sulfonation is distinctly different than direct sulfonation of the phenolic resin<br>
precursor.<br>
Any phenolic resin could be employed as the phenolic resin precursor, but it<br>
has been found that resoles are especially suitable. The resole precursor should have a<br>
sufficient amount of active alkylol or benzyl ether groups that can initially condense with the<br>
modifying agent and then undergo further subsequent condensation. Of course, the phenolic<br>
resin precursor has a lower molecular weight than the final dispersed resin since the precursor<br>
undergoes condensation to make the final dispersed resin. Resoles are prepared by reacting a<br>
phenolic compound with an excess of an aldehyde in the presence of a base catalyst. Resole<br>
resins are usually supplied and used as reaction product mixtures of monomeric phenolic<br>
compounds and higher molecular weight condensation products having alkylol (-ArCH2-OH)<br>
or benzyl ether termination (-ArCH2-O-CH2Ar), wherein Ar is an aryl group. These resole<br>
mixtures or prepolymers (also known as stage A resin) can be transformed into three-<br>
dimensional, crosslinked, insoluble and infusible polymers by the application of heat.<br>
The reactants, conditions and catalysts for preparing resoles suitable for the<br>
resole precursor of the present invention are well-known. The phenolic compound can be any<br>
of those previously listed or other similar compounds, although multi-hydroxy phenolic<br>
compounds are undesirable. Particularly preferred phenolic compounds for making the resole<br>
precursor include phenol per se and alkylated phenol. The aldehyde also can be any of those<br>
previously listed or other similar compounds, with formaldehyde being preferred. Low<br>
molecular weight, water soluble or partially water soluble resoles are preferred as the<br>
precursor because such resoles maximize the ability to condense with the modifying agent.<br>
The F/P ratio of the resole precursor should be at least 0.90. Illustrative commercially<br>
available resoles that are suitable for use as a precursor include a partially water soluble resole<br>
available from Georgia Pacific under the trade designation BRL 2741 and a partially water<br>
soluble resoles available from Schenectady International under the trade designations<br>
HRJ11722 and SG3100.<br>
Preferably, the dispersed novolak is produced by reacting or mixing 1 mol of<br>
modifying agent(s) with 2-20 mol of phenolic resin (preferably resole) precursor(s) and,<br>
preferably, 2-20 mol of multi-hydroxy phenolic compound(s). An aldehyde compound,<br>
preferably formaldehyde, is also required to make the novolak. The aldehyde compound can<br>
optionally be added as a separate ingredient in the initial reaction mixture or the aldehyde<br>
compound can be generated in situ from the resole precursor. The resole precursor(s), multi-<br>
hydroxy phenolic compound(s) and modifying agent(s) co-condense to form the dispersed<br>
novolak. The reaction typically is acid catalyzed with an acid such as phosphoric acid. The<br>
F/P ratio of aldehyde compound(s) to combined amount of resole precursor(s) and multi-<br>
hydroxy phenolic compound(s) in the initial reaction mixture preferably is less than 0.9.<br>
Preferably, synthesis of the dispersed novolak is a two stage reaction. In the first stage, the<br>
resole precursors) is reacted with the modifying agent(s) and, optionally, a small amount of<br>
multi-hydroxy phenolic compound(s). Once this first stage reaction has reached the desired<br>
point (i.e. the resin can be readily formed into a translucent dispersion), the acid catalyst and a<br>
greater amount of multi-hydroxy phenolic compound(s) is added to the reaction mixture.<br>
Pyrocatechol (also simply known as catechol) is a preferred multi-hydroxy phenolic<br>
compound for reacting in the first stage and resorcinol is a preferred multi-hydroxy phenolic<br>
compound for reacting in the second stage.<br>
Hydrophilic novolaks typically have a hydroxy equivalents of between 1 and 3<br>
per aromatic ring. Preferably, dispersed hydrophilic novolaks according to the invention have<br>
a hydroxy equivalents of 1.1 to 2.5, more preferably 1.1 to 2.0. The hydroxy equivalents are<br>
calculated based on the amount of multi-hydroxy phenolic compounds used to make the<br>
novolak.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the dispersed phenolic resin reaction<br>
product contains a mixture of oligomers having structures believed to be represented by the<br>
following formulae Ha or lib:<br><br>
wherein X, Y, Z and L1 and subscripts a, b, c, d and m are the same as in formulae la and Ib, e<br>
is 1 to 6, L2 is a divalent linking group and Ph is the phenolic resin backbone structure,<br>
provided the -(L2 -Ph) group(s) is(are) ortho or para to a Y group. L2 depends upon the<br>
particular phenolic resin, but typically is a divalent alkylene radical such as methylene (-CH2-<br>
) or oxydimethylene (-CH2-O-CH2-). Preferably, e is 2 and the -(L2-Ph) groups are in para<br>
position to each other.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment wherein the phenolic resin is a novolak<br>
and the modifying agent is a naphthalene having a ionic pendant group X and two reaction-<br>
enabling substituents Y, the dispersed phenolic resin reaction product contains a mixture of<br>
oligomers having structures believed to be represented by the following formula IV:<br><br>
wherein X and Y are the same as in formulae la and Ib, a is 0 or 1, n is 0 to 5 and R4 is<br>
independently hydroxyl, alkyl, aryl, alkylaryl or aryl ether. Preferably, R4 is tert-butyl. If 6,7-<br>
dihydroxy-2-naphthalenesulfonate, sodium salt is the modifying agent, X will be SO3-Na+ and<br>
each Y will be OH. In this case the hydroxy groups for Y will also act as chelating groups<br>
with a metal ion.<br>
It should be recognized that the dispersed phenolic resin reaction product may<br>
also contain oligomers or compounds having structures that vary from the idealized structures<br>
shown in formula IV.<br>
If the modifying agent includes a sulfur-containing ionic group, the resulting<br>
modified phenolic resin should have a carbon/sulfur atom ratio of 20:1 to 200:1, preferably<br>
20:1 to 100:1. If the sulfur content is greater than the 20:1 carbon/sulfur atom ratio, the<br>
modified phenolic resin begins to become water soluble, is more stable with respect to<br>
multivalent ions and is difficult to thermoset. These characteristics are adverse to the<br>
preferred use of the preferred phenolic resin dispersion of the invention. If the sulfur content<br>
is below the 200:1 carbon/sulfur atom ratio, then the preferred resin dispersion cannot<br>
maintain its stability. Viewed another way, the dispersed phenolic resins have 0.01 to 0.10,<br>
preferably 0.03 to 0.06, equivalents of sulfonate functionality/100 g resin. The aqueous<br>
dispersion of the phenolic resin preferably has a solids content of 1 to 50, preferably 15 to 30.<br>
The modifying agent and the phenolic resin precursor can be reacted under<br>
conditions effective to promote condensation of the modifying agent with the phenolic resin<br>
precursor. The reaction is carried out in water under standard phenolic resin condensation<br>
techniques and conditions. The reactant mixture (including water) generally is heated from<br>
50 to 100°C under ambient pressure, although the specific temperature may differ<br>
considerably depending upon the specific reactants and the desired reaction product. The<br>
resulting product is a concentrate that is self-dispersible upon the addition of water and<br>
agitation to reach a desired solids content. The final dispersion can be filtered to remove any<br>
gelled agglomerations.<br>
The intermediate modified resoles or novolaks that are initially produced in the<br>
synthesis are not necessarily water dispersible, but as the chain extension is advanced the<br>
resulting chain extended modified resoles or novolaks become progressively more water<br>
dispersible by simple mechanical agitation. The chain extension for the dispersed resole is<br>
determined by measuring the viscosity of the reaction mixture. Once the resole reaction<br>
mixture has a reached the desired viscosity, which varies depending upon the reactant<br>
composition, the reaction is stopped by removing the heat. The chain extension for the<br>
dispersed novolak is determined by pre-selecting the F/P ratio of the total reaction mixture (in<br>
other words, the amount of aldehyde compound(s) relative to the amount of phenolic(s) in<br>
both the first and second stages). The reaction for the novolak is allowed to proceed until<br>
substantially all the total amount of the reactants have reacted. In other words, there is<br>
essentially no unreacted reactant remaining. Preferably, the molecular weight (i.e., chain<br>
extension) of the novolak should be advanced to just below the gel point.<br>
The coating forming component can be present in the metal treatment<br>
composition in any amount. Preferably, it is present in an amount of 10-90, preferably 20-<br>
80%, more preferably 30-60%, based on the dry weight of the metal treatment conversion<br>
coating component.<br>
The conversion coating that forms from the metal treatment conversion<br>
coating component forms an environmentally (especially corrosion) resistant, non-<br>
resolvatable coating when applied to a metal surface and cured. As used herein, "non-<br>
resolvatable" means that the coating does not resolvate when the aqueous protective coating<br>
component is applied to the film before it is thermoset. If the coating resolvated, the<br>
components of the coating would dissolve or disperse into the aqueous protective coating<br>
component thus destroying any advantage intended from the formation of the coating on a<br>
surface. The low ionic content of the preferred modified phenolic novolak resin dispersion<br>
(relative to water soluble phenolic resins) allows them to behave similarly to non-ionically<br>
modified resins and form very water resistant films on curing.<br>
Accelerators may also be present in the aqueous metal treatment conversion<br>
coating component. Accelerators are generally used in conversion coatings to'provide<br>
increased corrosion resistance. In the present invention, the inclusion of the blister control<br>
agent in the subsequently applied aqueous protective coating reduces or in some cases even<br>
eliminates the requirement of an accelerator in the aqueous metal treatment conversion<br>
coating component.<br>
Accelerating agents that can be used in the conversion coating can include any<br>
chemical that acts as an oxidizing agent and is capable of reacting with hydrogen formed at<br>
the surface of the metal, including those termed as reducing accelerators. Suitable<br>
accelerating agents can include hydroxylamine, bromates, chlorates, nitrates, nitrites,<br>
peroxides, organic nitro-compounds, oxo-nitrogen compounds and oxitnes, tungsten and<br>
molybdenum compounds (molybdic and tungstic acid compounds, molybdic acid, tungstic<br>
acid, their anhydrides and their water soluble salts), perchlorates, chlorites and perborates.<br>
Also suitable are the compounds discussed in connection with the blister suppressing agent<br>
described below. These and other suitable accelerators are described in U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
4,149,909 and 2,502,441 5,711,996 and Freeman, PhospJiating and Metal Pretreatment,<br>
Industrial Press Inc., 1986, all of which are incorporated in their entireties. The accelerator<br>
may be present in an amount of 0.1 to 20 wt%, preferably 0.5 to 10 wt%, more preferably 1.0<br>
to 5 wt%, based on the dry weight of the metal treatment conversion coating component.<br>
Water, preferably deionized water, is utilized in the aqueous metal treatment<br>
conversion coating component of the invention in order to vary the solids content. Although<br>
the solids content may be varied as desired, the solids content of the metal treatment<br>
composition typically is 1 to 15 wt%, preferably 5 to 10 wt%. Since the aqueous conversion<br>
coating component is waterborne it is preferably substantially free of volatile organic<br>
compounds. The resulting coating from application of the aqueous metal treatment<br>
conversion coating component is a thin, tightly bound interpenetrating matrix of coating<br>
forming component/metal phosphate/oxide at the metal substrate interface. This matrix can<br>
be further flexibilized with polymers. The flexibilizer is any material that contributes<br>
flexibility and/or toughness to the film formed from the composition. The toughness<br>
provided by the flexibilizer provides fracture resistance to the coating. The flexibilizer<br>
should be non-glassy at ambient temperature and be an aqueous emulsion latex or aqueous<br>
dispersion that is compatible with the other components of the coating such as the preferred<br>
phenolic novolak resin dispersion. The flexibilizer preferably is formulated into the<br>
composition in the form of an aqueous emulsion latex or aqueous dispersion<br>
Suitable flexibilizers include aqueous lattices, emulsions or dispersions of<br>
(poly)butadiene, neoprene, styrene-butadiene rubber, acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber (also<br>
known as nitrile rubber), halogenated polyolefin, acrylic polymer, urethane polymer,<br>
ethylene-propylene copolymer rubber, ethylene-propylene-diene terpolymer rubber, styrene-<br>
acrylic copolymer, polyamide, poly(vinyl acetate) and the like. Halogenated polyolefins,<br>
nitrile rubbers and styrene-acrylic copolymers are preferred. Further examples of suitable<br>
flexibilizers can be found in copending application Serial No. 09/235,201. If present, the<br>
flexibilizer may be present in an amount of 5 to 300 wt%, preferably 25 to 100 wt%, based on<br>
the total amount of coating forming component.<br>
The aqueous metal treatment conversion coating component may be prepared<br>
by any method known in the art, but are preferably prepared by combining and milling or<br>
shaking the ingredients and water in ball-mill, sand-mill, ceramic bead-mill, steel-bead mill,<br>
high speed media-mill or the like. It is preferred to add each component to the mixture in a<br>
liquid form such as an aqueous dispersion.<br>
The aqueous metal treatment conversion coating component may be applied to<br>
a substrate surface by any conventional method such as spraying, dipping, brushing, wiping,<br>
roll-coating (including reverse roll-coating) or the like, after which the conversion coating<br>
component typically is permitted to dry. Although conventional application methods can be<br>
used, the aqueous metal treatment conversion coating component can be applied via<br>
autodeposition. The preferred phenolic resin dispersion of the aqueous metal treatment<br>
conversion coating component enables autodeposition of the conversion coating component<br>
on an electrochemically active metallic surface. Autodepositable compositions usually are<br>
applied by dipping the metallic substrate or part into a bath of the composition. The metal<br>
substrate can reside in the metal treatment composition bath for an amount of time sufficient<br>
to deposit a uniform of desired thickness. Typically, the bath residence time is from about 5<br>
to about 120 seconds, preferably about 10 to about 30 seconds, and occurs at room<br>
temperature. The aqueous metal treatment conversion coating component when it is applied<br>
to the metal substrate should be sufficiently acidic to cause reaction with the metal to liberate<br>
the metallic ions. Typically, the pH of the metal treatment composition should be 1 to 4,<br>
preferably 1.5 to 2.5, when it is applied to the metal substrate. The composition typically is<br>
applied to form a dry film thickness of 1 to 15, preferably 4 to 10 fun. After simple forced air<br>
drying of a metal surface coated with the aqueous metal treatment conversion coating<br>
component the metal surface can be immediately coated with the aqueous protective coating<br>
component. The coated metal substrate typically is dried by subjecting it to heat and forced<br>
air. Depending upon the forced air flow, the drying usually occurs at approximately 200-<br>
250°F for a time period ranging from 30 seconds to 10 minutes. The ambient staging period<br>
previously required after such heated drying is no longer necessary. However, immediate<br>
subsequent coating of the treated metal substrate is not required. Alternatively, the treated<br>
metal substrate can be stored for a period of time and then subsequently coated with the<br>
protective coating composition.<br>
The present invention also includes an aqueous protective coating component<br>
that is applied over a metal substrate that has been treated with the aqueous metal treatment<br>
conversion coating component described above.<br>
As described above, when the acid in a conversion coating attacks the metal<br>
surface of the substrate, hydrogen is formed. The use of an accelerator acts as an oxidizing<br>
agent and reacts with the formed hydrogen. If the level or amount of accelerator is low,<br>
blistering can be a particular problem when a subsequent coating is applied. This is believed<br>
to be due to the free acid still in the system reacting with the metal substrate. Because of the<br>
now much thicker coating, any hydrogen liberated has difficulty diffusing through the thicker<br>
coating and hence causes blistering. Higher levels of accelerator in the metal treatment<br>
suppresses blistering: however, higher levels are often undesirable, causing unacceptably fast<br>
deposition of the conversion coat.<br>
The inventor has found that by including a blister suppressing agent, such as<br>
an oxidizing agent, in the subsequently applied protective coating, the blister suppressing<br>
agent in the protective coating, can diffuse to the surface of the metal and oxidize the formed<br>
hydrogen, thus reducing or even eliminating blister formation. The presence of the blister<br>
suppressing agent in the protective coating, allows the use of low levels or even no levels of<br>
accelerator in the metal treatment conversion coating component.<br>
Aside from blistering, the inclusion of an oxidizer in a subsequent protective<br>
coating composition results in the coating having an excellent appearance and corrosion<br>
resistance, regardless of the presence or level of an accelerating agent in the first coat.<br>
Moreover, if the blister suppressing agent is an oxidizing agent that is able<br>
complete the conversion reaction during the application of the aqueous protective coating<br>
component, then, as noted above, it is possible to reduce or in some instances completely<br>
forego the use of accelerators, in the aqueous metal treatment conversion coating component.<br>
Thus, the inclusion of an blister suppressing agent in a coating that is applied<br>
subsequent to a conversion coating has benefits regardless of whether there is an accelerator<br>
in the conversion coating, or whether there is blistering caused by the hydrogen. However,<br>
the use of an aqueous metal treatment conversion coating component with some accelerator<br>
together with a subsequent coating containing a blister suppressing agent is preferred.<br>
As used herein, "blister suppressing agent" is defined as any material which<br>
reduces or eliminates blister formation in the protective coating. Suitable blister suppressing<br>
agents include accelerators typically used in conversion coating compositions, such as the<br>
accelerators described above with respect to the metal treatment conversion coating<br>
component, both those known as oxidizing and reducing accelerators. Preferred blister<br>
suppressing agents include organic oxidizing agents.<br>
The organic oxidizing agents can include organic nitro compounds, oximes<br>
and oxo-nitrogen compounds. Particularly preferred organic oxidizing agents can include<br>
nitroguanidine; aromatic nitrosulfonates, Naphthol Yellow S; and picric acid (trinitrophenol).<br>
Preferred aromatic nitrosulfonates include nitro or dinitrobenzenesulfonate and the salts<br>
thereof, such as sodium nitrobenzensulfonate. The blister suppressing agents can be used<br>
alone or in mixtures. Particularly preferred mixtures include nitroguanidine and sodium<br>
nitrobenzenesulfonate. The blister suppressing agent may be present in an amount of 0.1 to<br>
20 wt%, preferably 0.2 to 10 wt%, based on the dry weight of the metal treatment conversion<br>
coating component.<br>
The protective coating component also includes an organic film forming<br>
protective component that is able to form a protective film on the aqueous metal treatment<br>
conversion coating component. This can include any water-dispersible or emulsifiable film-<br>
forming resin that can deposit an adherent coating on the aqueous metal treatment conversion<br>
coating component. Examples include thermosetting resins such as urethanes, amino resins,<br>
acrylic resins, alkyd resins, epoxy resins, phenolic resins, cyclized olefin rubbers, halogenated<br>
polyolefins, halo-sulfonated polyolefins, polyester resins, polybutadiene rubbers, natural<br>
resins, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Particularly preferred are autodepositable resins. The autodepositable resins<br>
described above with respect to the aqueous metal treatment conversion coating component<br>
can be used, such as derived ethylenicially unsaturated monomers such as polyvinylidene<br>
chloride, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene, acrylic, acrylontrile, polyvinyl acetate and styrene-<br>
butadiene, urethane and polyester resins and certain epoxy and epoxy-acrylate resins. A<br>
particularly preferred autodepositable resin includes the dispersed phenolic resin as described<br>
above in connection with the preferred phenolic resin used with the aqueous metal treatment<br>
conversion coating component.<br>
The organic film forming protective component may be present in an amount<br>
of up to 99 wt%, preferably 30 to 99 wt%, more preferably 75 to 99 wt%, based on the dry<br>
weight of the metal treatment conversion coating component.<br>
The aqueous protective coating component can be any coating known to<br>
protect the underlying metal substrate and prepare it for further treatment, such as application<br>
of adhesive or paint, or provide for an aesthetically pleasing appearance or texture. Of<br>
course, the blister suppressing agent must be added to the known coating compositions.<br>
Preferably, the aqueous protective coating component is a functional •<br>
autodepositable coating using the autodepositable resins described above, such as an adhesive<br>
primer or overcoat, particularly an adhesive primer or covercoat that is useful for bonding an<br>
elastomeric substrate to a metal substrate, in which the conversion coating composition serves<br>
as a protective coating under the subsequently applied functional autodepositable coating.<br>
Even more preferably, the aqueous protective coating component is a primer or adhesive<br>
topcoat that includes the dispersed phenolic resin as described above in connection with the<br>
preferred phenolic resin used with the aqueous metal treatment conversion coating<br>
component. In this instance, the conversion coating component can activate a metal surface<br>
for autodeposition of the subsequently applied coating, primer or adhesive topcoat. Such a<br>
preferred primer is described in more detail in co-pending, commonly assigned U.S. Patent<br>
Application No. 09/235,778 filed January 22, 1999, incorporated herein by reference. In<br>
addition to enhancing the corrosion resistance as explained above, autodeposition activity of<br>
the subsequent coating over the conversion coating composition is substantially increased<br>
according to the invention.<br>
Although preferred, the preferred adhesive primer or overcoat applied as the<br>
aqueous protective coating component over the conversion coating component does not have<br>
to be autodepositable. Conventional, non-autodepositable primers or covercoats can be used<br>
in the present invention. Especially useful are known elastomer-to-metal adhesive primers or<br>
covercoats such as those described in U.S. Patents No. 3,258,388; 3,258,389; 4,119,587;<br>
4,167,500; 4,483,962; 5,036,122; 5,093,203; 5,128,403; 5,200,455; 5,200,459; 5,268,404;<br>
5,281,638; 5,300,555; and 5,496,884, all incorporated by reference in their entireties.<br>
Elastomer-to-metal adhesive primers and covercoats are commercially available from Lord<br>
Corporation.<br>
The aqueous protective coating component also includes water, preferably<br>
deionized water, to vary the solids content. Although the solids content may be varied as<br>
desired, the solids content of the aqueous protective coating component typically is 5 to 50,<br>
preferably 8 to 15 wt%. Since the aqueous protective coating component is waterbome it is<br>
preferably substantially free of volatile organic compounds.<br>
For some organic film forming protective components, the inclusion of a<br>
flexibilizer may be desirable. Flexibilizers can include those described above and in U.S.<br>
Patent Application No. 09/235,778. If present, the flexibilizer may be present in an amount<br>
of 5 to 300 wt%, preferably 25 to 100 wt%, based on the total amount of the organic film<br>
forming protective component.<br>
The aqueous protective coating component can also include conventional<br>
additives such as inert filler material, pigments, plasticizers, dispersing agents, wetting<br>
agents, reinforcing agents and the like in amounts conventionally utilized. Examples of such<br>
conventional additives include carbon black, silica, sodium aluminosilicate, titanium dioxide<br>
and organic pigments and dyestuffs. The aqueous protective coating component preferably<br>
does not include an acid.<br>
The aqueous protective coating component can also include conventional<br>
additives known to be useful in adhesive compositions, such as metal oxides that can include<br>
zinc oxide, magnesium oxide, lead oxide, iron oxide, cadmium oxide, zirconium oxide and<br>
calcium oxide, with zinc oxide and magnesium oxide being preferred. Another useful<br>
ingredient is mica.<br>
The aqueous protective coating component can be applied using the same<br>
techniques as described above with respect to the metal treatment coating component. The<br>
protective coating can be dried under the conditions described above.<br>
Reference will now be made to the non-limiting examples described below.<br>
The following ingredients were mixed together to obtain an autodepositable<br>
metal treatment conversion coating component.<br>
Metal Treatment Conversion Coating Component<br>
The metal treatment was prepared by dissolving the nitroguanidine in the 100<br>
g of the diluent water, diluting the phosphoric acid to 10% with diluent water, adding the<br>
remaining diluent water to the novolac resin with excellent stirring, and adding all the<br>
prediluted components to give the final diluted metal treatment.<br>
Novolac Dispersion used above<br>
Novolac resin dispersion is prepared by dissolving the pyrogallol/resorcinol in<br>
250 g of the water in a 2000 ml resin kettle with stirrer, nitrogen inlet, reflux condenser. Add<br>
the phosphoric acid, bring to 95°C and slowly add 75% of the formalin solution. Then added<br>
the FBS and continued heating for 15 minutes followed by slow addition of the remaining<br>
formalin. Continue heating at 95°C for 30 minutes after the addition is completed, added the<br>
remaining diluent water, filter and package.<br>
The following ingredients were mixed together to obtain an autodepositable<br>
aqueous protective coating component.<br>
Aqueous Protective Coating Component<br>
The above coating was prepared by simply mixing all the dispersions with<br>
diluent water. A second protective coating was prepared as above but without the<br>
nitroguanidine in the coating.<br>
Steel Q-panels were dipped in a bath of the metal treatment conversion coating<br>
composition at 8% solids for 60 seconds. The metal treatment composition formed a<br>
continuous wet film on the steel coupon surface indicating successful autodeposition. The<br>
treated coupons then were dried at 200 F. The dried treated coupons are then dipped in a bath<br>
of the protective coating component at 11.5% solids for 15 seconds. The protective coating<br>
composition forms a continuous wet film on the steel coupon surface indicating successful<br>
autodeposition. The coated coupons are then dried for 15 minutes at 200°F. This process is<br>
repeated for both the nitroguanidine free and nitroguanidine containing protective coating.<br>
The nitroguanidine containing coating gives an excellent appearing, blister free<br>
coating, while the nitroguanidine free system shows substantial blistering over the surface of<br>
the coating.<br>
Another suitable embodiment includes the components of the example<br>
described above, with the novolak dispersion of the aqueous metal treatment conversion<br>
coating replaced by a dispersed novolak resin made by reacting 6,7-dihydroxy-2-<br>
naphthalenesulfonate, sodium salt (available from Andrew Chemicals), a water soluble resole<br>
(made from formaldehyde and phenol, F/P ratio of 2.3, 80% solids and commercially<br>
available from Schenectady under the trade designation HRJ11722), catechol, and water until<br>
viscous, followed by further reacting with phosphoric acid, water and resorcinol, followed by<br>
further reacting with formalin, followed by diluting the reacted concentrate in water as<br>
described above and in copending U.S. patent application Serial No. 09/235,201.<br>
While a preferred embodiment of the present invention has been described, it<br>
should be understood that various changes, adaptation in modification may be made therein<br>
without departing from the spirit of the invention and the scope of the appended claims.<br>
