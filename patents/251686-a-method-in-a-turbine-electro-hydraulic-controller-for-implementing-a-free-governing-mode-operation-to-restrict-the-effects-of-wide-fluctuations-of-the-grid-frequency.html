FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The invention generally relates to frequency support method implemented in<br>
electro-hydraulic governing system of steam turbines. More particularly the<br>
invention relates to a control method in a turbine electro hydraulic controller for<br>
implementing a free governing mode of operation to arrest wide fluctuations of<br>
the grid frequency.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Electricity grid in many countries are generally susceptible to frequent<br>
fluctuations in grid frequency, varying between 48 hertz to 51.5 hertz. Such<br>
fluctuations are obviously detrimental to Power Plant equipment, the utilities and<br>
the consumers which result in grid collapse leadikng to loss of industrial<br>
production including great inconvenience to domestic consumers which in turn<br>
affects the law and order situation.<br>
One of the influencing factors for wide fluctuations in grid frequency is the<br>
disallowance of the governor system of the steam turbine to operate freely and<br>
modify the Turbine-Generator load depending on fluctuation of the grid<br>
frequency. The restrictions imposed on the governing system generally are in the<br>
form of switching off the frequency support device, forcing the turbine admission<br>
valve to be wide open irrespective of load or frequency, and introducing dead<br>
bands and delay in actuating the frequency support device.<br>
Further, the frequency support device provided with the steam turbines are<br>
generally equipped with an electro-hydraulic governing system which is based on<br>
the objective of maintaining the grid frequency at a fixed value i.e. 50 or 60 Hz.<br>
The prior art device however provides a yery limited support in maintenance of<br>
the grid frequency, where frequency variations are very large.<br><br><br>
However, the grid authorities generally operate under the principle that in an<br>
electricity scarce country, the grid frequency can be maintained anywhere<br>
between 49 to 50.5 Hertz. But the frequent and sharp fluctuations in grid<br>
Frequency must be restricted through an appropriate frequency support<br>
mechanism designated as Free Governor Mode of Operation(FGMO).<br>
OBJECTS INVENTION:<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to propose a control method for<br>
implementing a Free Governor Mode of Operation in the steam turbines to<br>
restrict wide fluctuations of the grid frequency.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose a control method for<br>
implementing a Free Governor Mode of Operation in the Steam turbines which<br>
arrest transient swings in grid frequency by generating a floating frequency set<br>
point.<br>
An yet another object of the present invention is to propose a control method for<br>
implementing a Free Governor Mode of Operation in the Steam turbines which<br>
limits load change due to frequency fluctuation such that fluctuation in steam<br>
parameters are restricted within tolerance limits to avoid harmful cycling effect<br>
on various equipment.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to propose a control method for<br>
implementing a Free Governor Mode of Operation in the Steam turbines which is<br>
capable of effecting larger load corrections if frequency goes beyond IEGC band<br>
of 49 to 50.5 Hz.<br><br><br>
A still further object of the present invention is to propose a control method for<br>
implementing a Free Governor Mode of Operation in the Steam turbines which is<br>
capable of exercising automatic supplementary control to bring the load back to<br>
the original value.<br>
A still another object to propose a control method for implementing a Free<br>
Governor Mode of Operation in the Steam turbines which avoids constant<br>
fluctuations in load by introducing a small dead band in frequency support<br>
mechanism.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, there is provided a control method in a turbine electro hydraulic<br>
controller for implementing a free governing mode of operation to restrict the<br>
effects on wide fluctuations of the grid frequency, the method comprising the<br>
steps of integrating a previous value of the actual frequency to generate a<br>
floating frequency set point, the set point is reset to new values in a gradual<br>
manner corresponding to a time constant of an integrator; generating a hold<br>
signal when change in frequency exceeds the new frequency set value, the<br>
hold signal freezes the set value to the last value held; generating a load<br>
correction signal corresponding to the frequency error within the frequency band<br>
of 49.0 to 50.5 Hz, the proportional load correction value is limited to +/-5% of<br>
rated load and added to the load set point; removing the hold signal when the<br>
frequency stabilizes to the new value, the load returning to the original value as<br>
the frequency error becomes zero(Automatic Supplementary Control); carrying<br>
out a load change according to droop characteristics if frequency falls below 49<br>
Hz, the load change is limited to 10%; carrying out load change according to<br><br><br>
droop characteristics if frequency goes above 50.5 Hz, the load change is limited<br>
to 10%; and transmitting a load change signal to modify turbine load set point,<br>
and simultaneously transmitting a signal to boiler controls to make the changes<br>
in fuel firing with a feed forward action.<br>
RIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS:<br>
Figure 1 shows a schematic diagram of the control logic for implementing the<br>
control method according to the invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
As shown in figure-1, the method includes:-<br>
-	Previous value of actual frequency is integrated to generate the floating<br>
frequency set point. If frequency changes, set point changes to the new<br>
value in a gradual manner as per the integrator time constant.<br>
-	For frequency changes more than a set value, a hold signal is generated<br>
which freezes the set value to the last value held.<br>
-	Within the frequency bank of 49.0 to 50.5 Hz the proportional controller<br>
generates a load correction signal corresponding to the frequency error.<br>
The proportional load correction value is limited to +/-5% of rated load<br>
and is added to the load set point.<br><br><br>
-	When the frequency stabilizes to the new value, hold signal is removed<br>
and the load comes back to the original value as error becomes zero. Also<br>
the system is ready to make the next correction if the frequency changes<br>
again.<br>
-	If frequency falls below 49 Hz, the load change shall be carried out as per<br>
droop characteristics and is limited to 5%. If frequency goes above 50.5<br>
Hz, load change is carried out as per droop characteristics and is limited to<br>
10%.<br>
-	While load change signal acts on turbine load set point, a signal Is given<br>
to Boiler controls to make the changes in fuel firing with a feed forward<br>
action.<br>
By implementing the method according to the invention, it is possible to arrest<br>
sharp swings in grid frequency by unloading or loading the steam turbine and<br>
further prevent inadmissible fluctuation in steam parameters.<br>
The control logic for implementing the method is shown in Figure -1 . A brief<br>
description of the control logic to be implemented in EHTC is given below:<br>
1.	Floating frequency set point: The speed actual signal is used to<br>
generate the floating signal. The time delayed set point generated by<br>
the actual value of speed. In the event of any change in frequency,<br>
the set point changes to a value equal to the new frequency (speed)<br>
value. This change happens in a slow ramp.<br>
2.	For frequency changes more than the set value, for a duration<br>
varying between minimum 3 minutes to a maximum of 6 minutes<br>
(proportional to frequency change) a HOLD signal is generated. This<br>
signal forces the floating frequency set point to the last set value<br>
held. This is done to ensure a proportional correction for sufficient<br>
duration to effect changes in boiler parameters.<br><br><br>
3.	A proportional controller compares the set value and actual value and<br>
generates a frequency influence signal with a proportional gain<br>
corresponding to droop setting. This proportional component is given<br>
in full magnitude at the beginning and starts coming down as the<br>
deviation reduces on account of frequency set point slowly<br>
approaching the new actual value.<br>
4.	The proportional values of frequency influence is added to the load<br>
set point to form the final load set point going to load controller,<br>
This will increase the load signal. This signal is in addition to the<br>
pressure dependent load correction (already available)<br>
5.	After the frequency stabilizes to a value within the dead band then<br>
the hold signal is removed. After the removal of hold signal the set<br>
point will now settle to the new frequency value and proportional<br>
frequency influence starts coming down as the deviation reduces.<br>
With this the system is now available for the next frequency change.<br>
6.	In the frequency range beyond IEGC band i.e. blow 49.0 Hz &amp; above<br>
50.5 Hz the frequency influence as per droop characteristic will<br>
become effective and drives the frequency influence signal to ± 10%<br>
(this limit can be decided as per site conditions).<br>
7.	While the frequency influence acts on turbine load set point a signal<br>
is given to Boiler control to make changes in fuel firing with a feed<br>
forward action for a quick response.<br><br>
8. The pressure controller of EHTC In Limit Pressure mode ensures that<br>
the load is reduced to maintain the boiler header pressure, in the<br>
event of a sudden pressure drop more than set limit value.<br>
The performances of the boiler parameters are monitored and the controls<br>
tuned for optimum performance to ensure that the load changes do not cause<br>
any disturbances in the boiler parameters. Depending on the other conditions of<br>
the plant, the limitations of load change can be adopted keeping in view the<br>
regulatory requirements for FGMO.<br><br><br>
