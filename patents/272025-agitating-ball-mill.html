				<td>Agitating ball mill<br>
The invention relates to an agitating ball mill with a cylindrical grinding vessel having<br>
10 at least one grinding stock inlet and at least one grinding stock outlet, wherein in the<br>
grinding stock vessel an agitating shaft connected with a drive is arranged which<br>
transmits a part of the drive energy to auxiliary grinding bodies which are loosely<br>
arranged in the grinding vessel and a separating device arranged in front of the grinding<br>
stock outlet.<br>
15<br>
An agitating ball mill of this kind emerges from EP 1 468 739 Al. With this<br>
horizontally arranged agitating mill the grinding vessel is in connection with a grinding<br>
stock inlet and a grinding stock outlet. In the grinding vessel proper is located an<br>
agitating shaft which is in connection with a drive. The auxiliary grinding bodies filled<br>
20 into the grinding chamber are accelerated through agitating organs so that the grinding<br>
stock located between the auxiliary grinding bodies is ground or dispersed. The fineness<br>
of the product produced in this agitating ball mill is largely dependent on the size of the<br>
auxiliary grinding bodies employed. To separate the auxiliary grinding bodies from the<br>
grinding stock a separating device connected with the grinding stock outlet is provided<br>
25 at the end of the grinding vessel. This separating device comprises several arc-shaped<br>
conveying or wing elements which are arranged between two discs. The wing elements<br>
extend from the outer edge of the discs in the direction of their centre, wherein the<br>
elements partly end at different distances from the grinding stock outlet.<br>
30 Because of the short distance which the auxiliary grinding bodies have to cover between<br>
the wing elements entry of auxiliary grinding bodies in the grinding outlet while the<br>
separating device is stationary cannot be prevented.<br>
The object of the invention therefore consists in improving a separating device also for<br>
35 smallest grinding bodies so that entry of the auxiliary grinding bodies in the grinding<br>
stock outlet is prevented even during the start-up and run-down phase of the agitating<br>
ball mill. This object is solved with the characteristics of Claim 1.<br><br>
5 Further embodiments according to the invention are mentioned in the characteristics of<br>
the subclaims.<br>
Through the invention an agitating ball mill is thus created with a cylindrical grinding<br>
vessel having at least one grinding stock inlet and one grinding stock outlet, wherein the<br>
10 grinding vessel arranged horizontally as shown in the exemplary embodiment has an<br>
agitating shaft connected with a drive which transmits a part of the drive energy to the<br>
auxiliary grinding bodies. To separate the auxiliary grinding bodies from the grinding<br>
stock a separating device is employed which comprises at least one spiral.<br>
15 With a preferred embodiment employed with smallest grinding bodies the separating<br>
device consists of two spirals.<br>
A further preferential embodiment provides that the spirals are arranged with a constant<br>
distance to each other.<br>
20<br>
With smallest grinding bodies it can be advantageous to arrange the spirals with a<br>
varying distance to each other.<br>
Another preferential embodiment of the invention is provided in order to achieve that<br>
25 the auxiliary grinding bodies among themselves are retained by friction. Here, the spiral<br>
directly extends with its radially inner end as far as the grinding stock outlet.<br>
In order to increase the throughput in the agitating ball mill the grinding stock outlet can<br>
extend on both sides of the longitudinal centre of the spiral.<br>
30<br>
It has been shown that secure separation of the auxiliary grinding bodies from the<br>
grinding stock takes place when the spiral/s extend/s by a circumference of at least 360°<br>
about the longitudinal axis of the agitating shaft.<br>
35 Depending on the throughput with which the mill is operated it can be advantageous if<br>
the width of the spiral/s amounts to at least one third of its diameter.<br><br>
5 Since the spiral/s guarantee/s secure separation of the auxiliary grinding bodies from the<br>
grinding stock even with few revolutions it can be advantageous to rotate the spiral/s via<br>
an independent drive.<br>
According to an advantageous arrangement in which the spiral/s is/are protected against<br>
10 excessive wear at the outer end the spiral sits between the agitating shaft surface and the<br>
longitudinal axis of the agitating shaft. Within a cage-like section of the agitating shaft<br>
which in this region comprises radial openings.<br>
In order to promote the outflow of the auxiliary grinding bodies in this cage-like region<br>
15 the slot-shaped openings are inclined contrary to the direction of rotation of the<br>
agitating shaft.<br>
Depending on the viscosity values which the product has it can be an advantage to<br>
configure the openings of the agitating shaft tangentially or asymmetrically to the<br>
20 longitudinal axis of the latter.<br>
To loosen up the auxiliary grinding body package in the region of the outlet it can be an<br>
advantage to provide the agitating shaft with agitating elements in the region of the<br>
spiral/s which consist of agitating bars or cleats and which are staggered by at least 45°<br>
25 relative to one another.<br>
With a further preferential embodiment the spiral/s contrary to the normal embodiment<br>
in which it/they consist/s of plate, consist/s of bars and webs individually spaced from<br>
one another. However, these bars and webs need not be connected with one another in a<br>
30 contacting manner.<br>
It is further preferred that the diameter of the spiral/s comprises at least 30% of the<br>
grinding chamber diameter.<br>
35 In a further embodiment version the diameter of the spiral/s is at least 30% of the<br>
diameter of the hollow space in the agitating shaft.<br><br>
5 If the separating device is employed with a drive arranged independently from the<br>
agitating shaft it can be an advantage if the spirals are inserted between two holohedral<br>
end faces.<br>
To improve the backflow of the auxiliary grinding bodies it can be an advantage if the<br>
10 end faces located laterally on the spirals comprise openings through which the auxiliary<br>
grinding bodies can flow back into the grinding chamber.<br>
To influence the flow direction in the region of the outlet it will be an advantage if a<br>
laterally arranged displacement body is inserted in the spiral/s.<br>
15<br>

The agitating ball mill according to the invention consists of a housing 10 in which a<br>
10 drive 12 in form of an electric motor is seated. The drive is in connection with a drive<br>
shaft 16 by means of a drive belt 14. This drive shaft merges with the bearing shaft 18<br>
which in turn is connected with the agitating shaft 20. On the upper side of the bearing<br>
housing 22 is located the grinding stock inlet 24. The grinding chamber 48 is limited by<br>
the grinding vessel 26 surrounding the agitating shaft 20 and the grinding vessel base<br>
15 28. The separating device 30, with which the auxiliary grinding bodies 54 are separated<br>
from the grinding stock, is seated within the agitating shaft 20. To cool or heat the<br>
grinding vessel the latter is surrounded in a double-walled manner by a jacket 32<br>
capable of being cooled and heated. The grinding stock leaves the grinding vessel via a<br>
central grinding stock outlet which leads from the agitating shaft via the bearing shaft as<br>
20 far as the drive shaft. Figure 2 shows the arrangement of a spiral 36 within the agitating<br>
shaft 20 in whose surface agitating bars 38 are inserted. Here, the grinding stock flows<br>
out centrally from the grinding vessel 26 via a line 40 which merges into a pipeline 42.<br>
Figure 3 discloses the embodiment of a spiral for example employed for separating the<br>
25 auxiliary grinding bodies from the grinding stock. This spiral 36 in this case extends<br>
over 720°. The grinding stock flowing into the spiral reaches the grinding stock outlet<br>
through the pipeline 40. In order to bring about relief of the separating device the<br>
auxiliary grinding bodies are transported back into the grinding chamber 48 via<br>
passages 46 in the agitating shaft even before entering the screw passageway 44.<br>
30<br>
Exemplary embodiments of the arrangement of the spiral can be seen in Figures 4 and 5<br>
where the spirals 36 each extend about 360°. In Figure 4 the spiral consists of bars, in<br>
Figure 6 of triangular profiles. Through these inner surfaces of the spirals that can be<br>
described as rough in the widest sense the effect of retention by friction which occurs<br>
35 during the stationary state of the agitating shaft is supported. To increase this retention-<br>
by-friction effect the embodiment of the spiral in Figures 4 and 6 can be increased by<br>
extending the spiral.<br><br>
5 Figure 5 explains the embodiment of the passages 46 whose lateral surfaces 50 are<br>
directed tangentially to the centre axis of the agitating shaft. Figure 7 shows a separating<br>
device 30 which comprises one or several spirals 36. Depending on how long the<br>
distance of the individual auxiliary grinding bodies in the spiral is, the fewer revolutions<br>
will the separate drive 52 have to complete in order to bring about entering of the<br>
10 auxiliary grinding bodies in the grinding stock outlet.<br>
In Figure 8 the separating device 30 is likewise rotated with a drive 52 separated from<br>
the agitating shaft 20. In addition, the separating device 30 in this case is located in a<br>
hollow space within the agitating shaft 20 as a result of which it is substantially<br>
15 protected against excessive wear through the auxiliary grinding bodies 54 activated by<br>
the agitating shaft 20. Purely schematically it is also shown in this exemplary<br>
embodiment how the auxiliary grinding body concentration decreases from the grinding<br>
chamber 48 in the direction of the grinding stock outlet 34.<br>
20 In Figures 9 and 10 it can be seen that the separating device operates with a right-hand<br>
rotating as well as a left-hand rotating spiral. In the final analysis it is not critical that<br>
the spiral rotates in the direction of rotation opposite to that of the agitating shaft. The<br>
function of the spiral is independent of the direction of rotation of the agitating shaft.<br>
25 In the case of the agitating ball mill shown in Figure 11 the separating device 30 rotates<br>
synchronously with the agitating shaft 20. The spiral 36 of the separating device rests<br>
against the agitating shaft with its left side and with the right side is clamped to the<br>
agitating shaft with a clamping element 56. Centrally in the longitudinal centre of the<br>
spiral in the region of the longitudinal axis of the agitating shaft 20 is located the inlet<br>
30 58 of the grinding stock outlet 34. Figure 12 illustrates in this case the length of the<br>
spiral 36 which in this case comprises a range of 630°.<br>
The embodiment of the separating device according to Figures 13, 14 and 15 is more<br>
preferably geared up for high-viscosity substances. Since the adhesion forces between<br>
35 the product and the auxiliary grinding bodies are very great in high-viscosity<br>
substances, a longer distance for separating the auxiliary grinding bodies is required,<br>
which is why two spirals 36 are provided in Figure 13. Here, the outer surfaces of the<br>
spirals each act like deflectors as far as the start of the further screw. This means that<br><br>
these surfaces 60 generate a pulsating effect in the direction of the grinding chamber<br>
and thus bring about a deflection of the auxiliary grinding bodies in the direction of the<br>
grinding chamber even at the circumference of the separating device. In addition to<br>
this, the auxiliary grinding bodies during the course of the spiral passageways which<br>
extend over 1080° are continuously forced to return into the grinding chamber through<br>
the friction forces on the spiral walls and the inverse conveying direction.<br>
The Figure 14 shows the use of the spirals 36 described in Figure 13. The separating<br>
device here is directly located on the end face of the cantilever-mounted agitating shaft<br>
20. The product flows out centrally via the agitating shaft 20 and bearing shaft 18.<br>
In Figure 15 the grinding vessel base 28 comprises a shoulder 60. In this region the<br>
spiral 36 is open in the direction of the shoulder so thai: the auxiliary grinding bodies can<br>
flow back into the grinding chamber 48 via short distances. The outer region of the<br>
spiral 36 is limited by a ring 62.<br>
Figures 16 and 17 show separating devices with two spirals each of which extends over<br>
a range of 500° and 560°. The two spirals have screw passageways with always constant<br>
wall distance A. The separating device 30 rotates jointly with the agitating shaft 20,<br>
wherein the product outlet is effected through the agitating shaft 20 and bearing shaft<br>
18. To avoid dead zones in which no grinding stock grinding body flow is generated, a<br>
shoulder 60 is embodied in the separating device which is used for flow formation. The<br>
agitating shaft in this exemplary embodiment comprises no grinding pins 31 but cleats<br>
62.<br>
Figures 18, 19, 20 and 21 demonstrate the position and the embodiment of separating<br>
devices with spirals whose distance is embodied constant as in Figure 18, reducing as in<br>
Figure 19 and expanding as in Figure 20. Figure 18 here corresponds to Figure 16 where<br>
the distance A remains constant over the entire arrangement of the two spirals 36. In<br>
Figure 19 the spirals 36 are arranged so that the distance B from the grinding chamber<br>
to the outlet is reduced. This version is particularly used when low-viscosity material is<br>
employed and it must be expected that the agitating ball mill will be briefly put out of<br>
operation. Through the reducing distance between the two spirals the retention-by-<br>
friction effect between the spiral walls and the auxiliary grinding bodies is reinforced.<br><br>
Through the arrangement of the two spirals according to Figure 20 it is possible to<br>
achieve a faster outflow of the product following the separation from the auxiliary<br>
grinding bodies. The shown geometry of the two spirals 36 shows that the distance C<br>
increases in the direction from the grinding chamber to the grinding stock outlet.<br>
A further possibility of transporting auxiliary grinding bodies from the region of the<br>
separating device laterally from the spiral passageways back into the grinding chamber<br>
is shown in Figure 23. Here the separating device 30 is seated within a hollow space 64<br>
which is open on one side within the agitating shaft. The spiral 36 is held by the<br>
agitating shaft 20. At the face end of the spiral 36 facing the grinding vessel base 28 is<br>
located a ring 66 which connects each spiral passageway with the hollow space 64 thus<br>
offering the grinding auxiliary bodies the possibility of flowing from the spiral via the<br>
hollow space back into the grinding chamber 48. The ring has a slot 68 through which<br>
the auxiliary grinding bodies can flow back into the grinding chamber via the hollow<br>
space 64. The processed grinding stock leaves the grinding chamber from the central<br>
region within the spiral/s 36 via an immersion pipe 70. As is evident from Figure 22 this<br>
separating device comprises only one spiral 36.<br><br>
