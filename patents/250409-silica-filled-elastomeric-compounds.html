				<td>Silica-Filled elastomeric compounds<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to silica-filled halogenated butyl<br>
elastomers, in particular bromobutyl elastomers (BUR).<br>
Background of the invention:<br>
It is known that reinforcing fillers such as carbon black and silica<br>
greatly improve the strength and fatigue properties of elastomeric<br>
compounds. It is also known that chemical interaction occurs between<br>
the elastomer and the filler. For example, good interaction between filler,<br>
in particular carbon black and highly unsaturated elastomers such as<br>
polybutadiene (BR) and styrene butadiene copolymers (SBR) occurs<br>
because of the large number of carbon-carbon double bonds present in<br>
these copolymers. Butyl elastomers are known to interact poorly with<br>
fillers like carbon black. For example, a compound prepared by mixing<br>
carbon black with a combination of BR and butyl elastomers results in<br>
domains of BR, which contain most of the carbon black, and butyl<br>
**'<br>
domains which contain very little carbon black. It is also known that butyl<br>
compounds have poor abrasion resistance.<br>
WO-99/09036-A1 discloses protected thiol modifiers in general and<br>
also their use in silica filled compound comprising organic polymers.<br>
However, this reference is silent about the beneficial use of protected thiol<br>
modifiers in compounds comprising halogenated butyl rubbers. Butyl<br>
elastomers may have only one tenth, or fewer, of the carbon-carbon<br>
double bonds found in BR or SBR as disclosed in WO-99/09036-A1.<br>
Thus, our findings that the use of protected thiol modifiers in fact results in<br>
compounds with a very good balance of physical properties while still<br>
maintaining acceptable levels of processability is surprising.<br>
Summary of the Invention:<br>
The present invention provides a composition comprising at least<br>
one halobutyl elastomer, at least one mineral filler and at least one<br>
protected thiol modifier.<br>
It has been discovered that protected thiol modifiers enhance the<br>
interaction of halobutyl elastomers with mineral fillers, resulting in<br>
improved compound properties such as tensile strength and abrasion<br>
resistance (DIN). This is surprising as the non-halogenated butyl<br>
elastomer does not respond in the same way.<br>
Accordingly, in another aspect the present invention provides a<br>
process which comprises mixing a halobutyl elastomer with at least one<br>
mineral filler, in the presence of at least one protected thiol modifier, and<br>
curing the resulting filled halobutyl elastomer.<br>
The halobutyl elastomer that is admixed with one protected thiol<br>
modifier may be a mixture with another elastomer or elastomeric<br>
compound. The halobutyl elastomer should constitute more than 5% of<br>
any such mixture. Preferably the halobutyl elastomer should constitute at<br>
least 10% of any such mixture. In some cases it is preferred not to use<br>
mixtures but to use the halobutyl elastomer as the sole elastomer. If<br>
mixtures are to be used, however, then the other elastomer may be, for<br>
example, natural rubber, polybutadiene, styrene-butadiene or polychloroprene<br>
or an elastomer compound containing one or more of these<br>
elastomers.<br>
The filled halobutyl elastomer can be cured in the presence of at<br>
least one cross-linking agent to obtain a product which has improved<br>
properties, for instance in abrasion resistance, rolling resistance and<br>
traction. Curing can be effected with sulfur but does not have to be. The<br>
preferred amount of sulfur is in the range of from 0 to 2.0 parts by weight<br>
per hundred parts of rubber. An activator, for example zinc oxide, may<br>
also be used, in an amount in the range of from 0.5 parts to 2 parts by<br>
weight. Other ingredients, for instance stearic acid, antioxidants, or<br>
accelerators may also be added to the elastomer prior to curing. Sulphur<br>
curing is then effected in the known manner. See, for instance, chapter 2,<br>
"The Compounding and Vulcanization of Rubber", of "Rubber<br>
Technology", 3rd edition, published by Chapman &amp; Hall, 1995, the<br>
disclosure of which is incorporated by reference.<br>
Other curatives known to cure halobutyl elastomers may also be<br>
used. A number of compounds are known to cure halobutyl elastomers,<br>
for example, such as bis dieneophiles (for example m-phenyl-bismaleimide,<br>
HVA2), phenolic resins, amines, amino-acids, peroxides, zinc<br>
oxide and the like. Combinations of the aforementioned curatives may<br>
also be used.<br>
The mineral-filled halobutyl elastomer of the invention can be<br>
admixed with other elastomers or elastomeric compounds before it is<br>
subjected to curing.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The phrase "halobutyl elastomer(s)" as used herein refers to a<br>
chlorinated or brominated butyl elastomer. Brominated butyl elastomers<br>
are preferred, and the invention is illustrated, by way of example, with<br>
reference to such bromobutyl elastomers. It should be understood,<br>
however, that the invention extends to the use of chlorinated butyl<br>
elastomers.<br>
Thus, halobutyl elastomers suitable for use in the practice of this<br>
invention include, but are not limited to, brominated butyl elastomers.<br>
Such elastomers may be obtained by bromination of butyl rubber (which is<br>
a copolymer of isobutylene and a co-monomer that is usually a C$ to CQ<br>
conjugated diolefin, preferably isoprene - (brominated isobuteneisoprene-<br>
copolymers BUR)). Co-monomers other than conjugated<br>
diolefins can be used, however, and mention is made of alkyl-substituted<br>
\tmy\ aromatic co-monomers such as Ci-C4-alkyl substituted styrene. An<br>
example of such an elastomer which is commercially available is<br>
brominated isobutylene methylstyrene copolymer (BIMS) in which the comonomer<br>
is p-methylstyrene.<br>
Brominated butyl elastomers typically comprise in the range of from<br>
0.1 to 10 weight percent of repeating units derived from isoprene and in<br>
the range of from 90 to 99.9 weight percent of repeating units derived<br>
from isobutylene (based upon the hydrocarbon content of the polymer)<br>
and in the range of from 0.1 to 9 weight percent bromine (based upon the<br>
bromobutyl polymer). A typical bromobutyl polymer has a molecular<br>
weight, expressed as the Mooney viscosity according to DIN 53 523 (ML<br>
1 + 8 at 125°C), in the range of from 25 to 60.<br>
For use in the present invention the brominated butyl elastomer<br>
preferably contains in the range of from 0.5 to 5 weight percent of<br>
repeating units derived from isoprene and in the range of from 95 to 99.5<br>
weight percent of repeating units derived from isobutylene (based upon<br>
the hydrocarbon content of the polymer) and in the range of from 0.2 to 3<br>
weight percent, preferably from 0.75 to 2.3 weight percent, of bromine<br>
(based upon the brominated butyl polymer).<br>
A stabilizer may be added to the brominated butyl elastomer.<br>
Suitable stabilizers include calcium stearate and epoxidized soy bean oil,<br>
preferably used in an amount in the range of from 0.5 to 5 parts by weight<br>
per 100 parts by weight of the brominated butyl rubber (phr).<br>
Examples of suitable brominated butyl elastomers include Bayer<br>
Bromobutyl® 2030, Bayer Bromobutyl® 2040 (BB2040), and Bayer<br>
Bromobutyl® X2 commercially available from Bayer. Bayer BB2040 has a<br>
Mooney viscosity (ML 1+8 @ 125°C) of 39 ± 4, a bromine content of 2.0 ±<br>
0.3 wt% and an approximate molecular weight of 500,000 grams per<br>
mole.<br>
The brominated butyl elastomer used in this invention may also be<br>
a graft copolymer of a brominated butyl rubber and a polymer based upon<br>
a conjugated diolefin monomer. Our co-pending Canadian Patent<br>
Application 2,279,085 is directed towards a process for preparing such<br>
graft copolymers by mixing solid brominated butyl rubber with a solid<br>
polymer based on a conjugated diolefin monomer which also includes<br>
some C-S-(S)n-C bonds, where n is an integer from 1 to 7, the mixing<br>
being carried out at a temperature greater than 50 °C and for a time<br>
sufficient to cause grafting. The disclosure of this application is<br>
incorporated herein by reference. The bromobutyl elastomer of the graft<br>
copolymer can be any of those described above. The conjugated<br>
diolefins that can be incorporated in the graft copolymer generally have<br>
the structural formula:<br>
wherein R is a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group containing from 1<br>
to 8 carbon atoms and wherein R-| and R-| 1 can be the same or different<br>
and are selected from the group consisting of hydrogen atoms and alkyl<br>
groups containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Some representative nonlimiting<br>
examples of suitable conjugated diolefins include 1,3-butadiene,<br>
isoprene, 2-methyl-1,3-pentadiene, 4-butyl-1,3-pentadiene, 2,3-dimethyl-<br>
1,3-pentadiene 1,3-hexadiene, 1,3-octadiene, 2,3-dibutyl-1,3-pentadiene,<br>
2-ethyl-1,3-pentadiene, 2-ethyl-1,3-butadiene and the like. Conjugated<br>
diolefin monomers containing from 4 to 8 carbon atoms are preferred, 1,3-<br>
butadiene and isoprene being especially preferred.<br>
The polymer based on a conjugated diene monomer can be a<br>
homopolyrner, or a copolymer of two or more conjugated diene<br>
monomers, or a copolymer with a vinyl aromatic monomer.<br>
The vinyl aromatic monomers which can optionally be used are<br>
selected so as to be copolymerizable with the conjugated diolefin<br>
monomers being employed. Generally, any vinyl aromatic monomer<br>
which is known to polymerize with organo-alkali metal initiators can be<br>
used. Such vinyl aromatic monomers usually contain in the range of from<br>
8 to 20 carbon atoms, preferably from 8 to 14 carbon atoms. Some<br>
examples of vinyl aromatic monomers which can be so copolymerized<br>
include styrene, alpha-methyl styrene, various alkyl styrenes including pmethylstyrene,<br>
p-methoxy styrene, 1-vinylnaphthalene, 2-vinyl<br>
naphthalene, 4-vinyl toluene and the like. Styrene is preferred for<br>
copolymerization with 1,3-butadiene alone or for terpolymerization with<br>
both 1,3-butadiene and isoprene.<br>
The halogenated butyl elastomer may be used alone or in<br>
combination with other elastomers such as:<br>
BR - polybutadiene<br>
ABR - butadiene/Ci-C4 alkyl acrylate copolymers<br>
CR - polychloroprene<br>
IR - polyisoprene<br>
SBR - styrene/butadiene copolymers with styrene contents<br>
of 1 to 60, preferably 20 to 50 wt.%<br>
IIR - isobutylene/isoprene copolymers<br>
NBR - butadiene/acrylonitrile copolymers with acrylonitrile<br>
contents of 5 to 60, preferably 10 to 40 wt.%<br>
HNBR - partially hydrogenated or completely hydrogenated<br>
NBR<br>
EPDM - ethylene/propylene/diene copolymers<br>
The filler is composed of particles of a mineral, and examples<br>
include silica, silicates, clay (such as bentonite), gypsum, alumina,<br>
titanium dioxide, talc and the like, as well as mixtures thereof.<br>
Further examples are:<br>
- highly disperse silicas, prepared e.g. by the precipitation of<br>
silicate solutions or the flame hydrolysis of silicon halides, with<br>
specific surface areas of 5 to 1000, preferably 20 to 400 m2/g<br>
(BET specific surface area), and with primary particle sizes of<br>
10 to 400 nm; the silicas can optionally also be present as<br>
mixed oxides with other metal oxides such as those of Al, Mg,<br>
Ca, Ba, Zn, Zrand Ti;<br>
- synthetic silicates, such as aluminum silicate and alkaline<br>
earth metal silicate like<br>
- magnesium silicate or calcium silicate, with BET specific<br>
surface areas of 20 to 400 m2/g and primary particle<br>
diameters of 10 to 400 nm;<br>
- natural silicates, such as kaolin and other naturally occurring<br>
silica;<br>
- glass fibres and glass fibre products (matting, extrudates) or<br>
glass microspheres;<br>
- metal oxides, such as zinc oxide, calcium oxide, magnesium<br>
oxide and aluminium oxide;<br>
- metal carbonates, such as magnesium carbonate, calcium<br>
carbonate and zinc carbonate;<br>
- metal hydroxides, e.g. aluminium hydroxide and magnesium<br>
hydroxide;<br>
or combinations thereof.<br>
These mineral particles have hydroxyl groups on their surface,<br>
rendering them hydrophilic and oleophobic. This exacerbates the<br>
difficulty of achieving good interaction between the filler particles and the<br>
butyl elastomer. For many purposes, the preferred mineral is silica,<br>
especially silica prepared by the carbon dioxide precipitation of sodium<br>
silicate.<br>
Dried amorphous silica particles suitable for use in accordance with<br>
the invention have a mean agglomerate particle size in the range of from<br>
1 to 100 microns, preferably between 10 and 50 microns and most<br>
preferably between 10 and 25 microns. It is preferred that less than 10<br>
percent by volume of the agglomerate particles are below 5 microns or<br>
over 50 microns in size. A suitable amorphous dried silica moreover has<br>
a BET surface area, measured in accordance with DIN (Deutsche<br>
Industrie Norm) 66131, of between 50 and 450 square meters per gram<br>
and a DBP absorption, as measured in accordance with DIN 53601, of<br>
between 150 and 400 grams per 100 grams of silica, and a drying loss, as<br>
measured according to DIN ISO 787/11, of from 0 to 10 percent by<br>
weight. Suitable silica fillers are available under the trademarks HiSil®<br>
210, HiSil® 233 and HiSil® 243 from PPG Industries Inc. Also suitable<br>
are Vulkasil® S and Vulkasil® N, from Bayer AG.<br>
Those mineral filler can may be used in combination with known<br>
non-mineral fillers, such as<br>
- carbon blacks; the carbon blacks to be used here are<br>
prepared by the lamp black, furnace black or gas black<br>
process and have BET specific surface areas of 20 to 200<br>
m2/g, e.g. SAP, ISAF, HAF, FEF or GPF carbon blacks;<br>
or<br>
- rubber gels, especially those based on polybutadiene,<br>
butadiene/styrene copolymers, butadiene/acrylonitrile<br>
copolymers and polychloroprene.<br>
Non-mineral fillers are not normally used as filler in the halobutyl<br>
elastomer compositions of the invention, but in some embodiments they<br>
may be present in an amount up to 40 phr. It is preferred that the mineral<br>
filler should constitute at least 55% by weight of the total amount of filler.<br>
If the halobutyl elastomer composition of the invention is blended with<br>
another elastomeric composition, that other composition may contain<br>
mineral and/or non-mineral fillers.<br>
The protected thiol modifier preferably comprises at least one<br>
silicon and one sulfur atom. Examples of suitable protected thiol<br>
modifiers are disclosed in WO-99/09036-A1 which hereby is incorporated<br>
by reference with regards to jurisdictions allowing for this feature.<br>

from 30 parts to 100 parts, more preferably from 40 to 80 parts per<br>
hundred parts of elastomer. The amount of the silazane compound is<br>
preferably in the range of from 0.5 to 10 parts per hundred parts of<br>
elastomer, preferably of from 1 to 6, more preferably of from 2 to 5 parts<br>
per hundred parts of elastomer. The amount of hydroxyl- and aminecontaining<br>
additive used in conjunction with the silazane compound is<br>
typically in the range of from 0.5 to 10 parts per hundred parts of<br>
elastomer, preferably of from 1 to 3 parts per hundred parts of elastomer.<br>
Furthermore up to 40 parts of processing oil, preferably from 5 to<br>
20 parts, per hundred parts of elastomer, may be present. Further, a<br>
lubricant, for example a fatty acid such as stearic acid, may be present in<br>
an amount up to 3 parts by weight, more preferably in an amount up to 2<br>
parts by weight.<br>
The halobutyl rubber(s)/elastomer(s), filler(s), protected thiol<br>
modifier(s) and optional further additive(s) are mixed together, suitably at<br>
a temperature in the range of from 25 to 200 °C. It is preferred that the<br>
temperature in one of the mixing stages be greater than 60 °C, and a<br>
temperature in the range of from 90 to 150 °C is particularly preferred.<br>
Normally the mixing time does not exceed one hour; a time in the range<br>
from 2 to 30 minutes is usually adequate. The mixing is suitably carried<br>
out on a two-roll mill mixer, which provides good dispersion of the filler<br>
within the elastomer. Mixing may also be carried out in a Banbury mixer,<br>
or in a Haake or Brabender miniature internal mixer. An extruder also<br>
provides good mixing, and has the further advantage that it permits<br>
shorter mixing times. It is also possible to carry out the mixing in two or<br>
more stages. Further, the mixing can be carried out in different<br>
apparatuses, for example one stage may be carried out in an internal<br>
mixer and another in an extruder.<br>
The enhanced interaction between the filler and the halobutyl<br>
elastomer results in improved properties for the filled elastomer. These<br>
improved properties include higher tensile strength, higher abrasion<br>
resistance, lower permeability and better dynamic properties. These<br>
render the filled elastomers particularly suitable for a number of<br>
applications, including, but not limited to, use in tire treads and tire<br>
sidewalls, tire innerliners, tank linings, hoses, rollers, conveyor belts,<br>
curing bladders, gas masks, pharmaceutical enclosures and gaskets.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, bromobutyl elastomer,<br>
silica particles, protected thiol modifier(s) and, optionally, further additives<br>
and/or, optionally, processing oil extender are mixed on a two-roll mill at a<br>
nominal mill temperature of 25 °C. The mixed compound is then placed<br>
on a two-roll mill and mixed at a temperature above 60 °C. It is preferred<br>
that the temperature of the mixing is not too high, and more preferably<br>
does not exceed 150 °C, since higher temperatures may cause curing to<br>
proceed undesirably far and thus impede subsequent processing. The<br>
product of mixing these four ingredients at a temperature not exceeding<br>
150 °C is a compound which has good stress/strain properties and which<br>
can be readily processed further on a warm mill with the addition of<br>
curatives.<br>
The filled halobutyl rubber compositions of the invention, and in<br>
particular filled bromobutyl rubber compositions, find many uses, but<br>
mention is made particularly of use in tire tread compositions. Important<br>
features of a tire tread composition are that it shall have low rolling<br>
resistance, good traction, particularly in the wet, and good abrasion<br>
resistance so that it is resistant to wear. Compositions of the invention<br>
display these desirable properties. Thus, an indicator of traction is tan 8<br>
at 0°C, with a high tan 8 at 0 °C correlating with good traction. An<br>
indicator of rolling resistance is tan 8 at 60 °C, with a low tan 8 at 60 °C<br>
correlating with low rolling resistance. Rolling resistance is a measure of<br>
the resistance to forward movement of the tire, and low rolling resistance<br>
is desired to reduce fuel consumption. Low values of loss modulus at 60<br>
°C are also indicators of low rolling resistance. As is demonstrated in the<br>
examples below, compositions of the invention display high tan 8 at 0°C,<br>
low tan 8 at 60°C and low loss modulus at 60°C.<br>
The invention is further illustrated in the following examples.<br>
Examples<br>
Description of tests:<br>
Abrasion Resistance:<br>
DIN 53-516 (60 grit Emery paper)<br>
Physical Testing:<br>
Stress-Strain measurements were determined at 23 °C on an<br>
Instron 4501 according to ASTM 412 Method A. Samples for Stress-<br>
Strain measurements were cut from a 2 mm macro sheet, cured for<br>
tc90+5 minutes, using Die C. Hardness values were determined with the<br>
use of a Shore A2 Tester according to ASTM 2240.<br>
Dynamic Property Testing:<br>
Dynamic testing (tan 6 at 0 °C and 60 °C, Loss modulus at 60 °C)<br>
were carried out using the GABO. The GABO is a dynamic mechanical<br>
analyzer for characterizing the properties of vulcanized elastomeric<br>
materials. The dynamic mechanical properties give a measure of traction<br>
with the best traction usually obtained with high values of tan 5 at 0 °C.<br>
Low values of tan 5 at 60°C, and in particular, low loss moduli at 60 °C are<br>
indicators of low rolling resistance.<br>

Examples 1-7<br>
The effect of incorporation of protected thiol modifier(s) into<br>
halogenated butyl elastomer/silica compounds was investigated via the<br>
formulation of several compounds of which NXT Silane was incorporated<br>
as the protected thiol modifier. For comparison, a halogenated butyl<br>
elastomer/silica compound (Example 1) with no silane and several nonhalogenated<br>
butyl elastomer/silica compounds (Examples 3, 5 and 7)<br>
were also prepared as control compounds. The amount of ingredients<br>
used is shown in Table 1.<br>
Examples 1-7 were prepared with the use of two roll, 6x12 inch<br>
Mill operating with a roll temperature of 30 °C. The compounds were<br>
prepared according to the following mixing sequence:<br>
t = 0min: Add1A+1B*<br>
t = 2min: Add 1C*<br>
t = 3 min : Sweep<br>
t = 4 min : Sweep<br>
t = 5 min : Dump<br>
* as indicated in Table 1 in column "step"<br>
Each of these compounds was then heat treated (banding with a<br>
tight nip setting) on a two roll, 6 x 12 in Mill operating with a roll<br>
temperature of 100 °C for a total of 10 minutes. Following the heat<br>
treatment, the curatives (2A) were added to the room temperature<br>
compounds with the use of a two roll 6 x 12 in Mill operating with a roll<br>
temperature of 30 °C. The compounds were refined with six endwise<br>
passess.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Note: TSTT = To Soft To Test. Compounds denoted as TSTT were<br>
deemed too soft to be tested by DIN 53-516. DNB = Did Not<br>
Break. Compounds denoted as DNB possessed ultimate<br>
elongations which exceeded the upper limit of the Instron 4501,<br>
operating according to ASTM 412 Method A.<br>
As can be seen from the data presented in Table 2, the physical<br>
properties of the compounds based on halogenated butyl (BB2030) are<br>
significantly superior to those measured for compounds based on non-<br>
halogenated butyl (RB301). Regardless of which curative package was<br>
employed, the enhanced reactivity of compounds based on halogenated<br>
butyl (BB2030) compared to compounds based on non-halogenated butyl<br>
(RB301) allowed for the attainment of excellent physical properties in the<br>
final compound. Specifically, compounds which were based on RB301<br>
(Examples 3, 5 and 7) possessed signifcantyl poorer abrasion resistance<br>
(in fact these compounds were too soft to be tested) indexes compared to<br>
their BB2030 analogues (Examples 2, 4 and 6). The significantly lower<br>
values of the modulus at 300 % elongation for Examples 3, 5 and 7 c.f.<br>
Examples 2, 4 and 6 is yet a further indication of the poor degree of filler<br>
interaction (and thus physical reinforcement) present in these<br>
formulations.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
