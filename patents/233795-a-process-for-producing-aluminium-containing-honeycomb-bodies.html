				<td>Process for producing aluminum-containing hineycomb<br>
bodies using radiant heators<br>
The present invention relates to a process for<br>
producing aluminum-containing honeycomb bodies, in<br>
which at least partially structured metal foils are<br>
stacked and/or wound to form a honeycomb structure with<br>
passages running approximately parallel to an axis,<br>
these metal foils are at least partially introduced<br>
into a tubular casing and are connected to one another<br>
by a joining technique at least in subregions. Metallic<br>
honeycomb bodies of this type are used, for example, as<br>
catalyst support bodies for the purification of an<br>
exhaust gas from an internal combustion engine.<br>
Known honeycomb bodies, in particular metallic catalyst<br>
support bodies, have a honeycomb structure with, for<br>
example, thin-walled, smooth and/or corrugated sheet-<br>
metal foils which are wound helically or in an S shape<br>
and, in a circularly cylindrical or oval-cylindrical<br>
tubular casing, are connected to one another by a<br>
joining technique such as welding, soldering,<br>
sintering, adhesion bonding or the like.<br>
To increase the stability of a honeycomb body of this<br>
type under fluctuating thermal stresses, it is already<br>
known for the sheet-metal foils of the honeycomb<br>
structure to be connected to one another by a joining<br>
technique only in certain subregions, for example at<br>
the end sides, and if appropriate also to be connected<br>
to the tubular casing, so that in the event of thermal<br>
stresses occurring, the tubular casing and honeycomb<br>
structure are able to expand unimpeded, with the result<br>
that fluctuating plastic deformations of the honeycomb<br>
structure, leading to destruction and detachment of the<br>
honeycomb structure, are avoided.<br>
Furthermore, processes for the end-side connection by a<br>
ioininq technique of a honeycomb structure arranged in<br><br>
a tubular casing are known in which the connection by<br>
a joining technique is carried out in a discontinuous<br>
process which lasts for a number of hours in a high-<br>
temperature furnace. The individual honeycomb bodies<br>
are in this case introduced into the furnace in<br>
batches. To avoid chemical reactions, such as, for<br>
example, undesirable formation of crystals or oxidation<br>
in particular at the surface of the sheet-metal foils,<br>
the joining process is carried out in the furnace under<br>
a shielding gas atmosphere containing, for example,<br>
argon and/or hydrogen or in vacuo. This in particular<br>
leads to a relatively high outlay on apparatus, with<br>
correspondingly high costs.<br>
Furthermore, there are known continuous processes which<br>
use induction coils to produce a connection between the<br><br>
sheet-metal foils by a joining technique. The induction<br>
coils are used to heat, at least subregions, in which a<br>
connection of the sheet-metal foils by a joining<br>
technique is ultimately to be produced, so that, for<br>
example, a solder arranged in the subregions begins to<br>
flow and, after cooling, generates a connection of this<br>
type. Depending on the form of the connection by a<br>
joining technique, the induction coils have to be<br>
operated with different AC voltage frequencies and have<br>
to be moved relatively close to the corresponding<br>
subregions of the honeycomb body. This can lead to an<br>
uneven formation of connections by a joining technique<br>
in the respective subregions.<br>
Working on this basis, it is an object of the present<br>
invention to provide a process for producing honeycomb<br>
bodies which allows processing of metal foils<br>
containing aluminum and which is suitable in particular<br>
for continuous production, with an improved quality of<br>
the connections by a joining technique that can be<br>
produced.<br>
These objects are achieved by the process having the<br>
features of claim 1. Further advantageous<br>
configurations of the process are described in the<br>
dependent claims.<br>
The process according to the invention for producing<br>
metallic honeycomb bodies comprises the following<br>
steps:<br>
selecting at least partially structured metal<br>
foils based on aluminum;<br>
stacking and/or winding at least partially<br>
structured metal foils to form a honeycomb<br>
structure with passages,<br>
heating the metal foils with the aid of at<br>
least one radiant heater from the open end face<br>
of the passages, the honeycomb structure, at<br>
least in a subregion, being heated in such a<br>
way that the at least one subregion, after<br>
approximately 2 seconds to approximately<br>
30 seconds, is at a temperature of<br>
approximately 450°C to approximately 600°C;<br>
connecting the metal foils to one another by a<br>
joining technique in the at least one<br>
subregion.<br>
In the text which follows, a metal foil based on<br>
aluminum is to be understood as meaning a metal foil<br>
which contains at least 90% by weight of aluminum. The<br>
aluminum content is advantageously on average at least<br>
approx. 95% by weight or even at least approx. 99% by<br>
weight. Under certain circumstances, it may even be<br>
necessary to select metal foils with an even higher<br>
aluminum content, for example more than 99.9% by weight<br>
aluminum. Unless specifically stated otherwise, in the<br>
text which follows the term "metal foil" is always used<br>
to refer to an aluminum-containing metal foil of this<br>
type.<br>
In addition, the metal foil may include at least one of<br>
the following chemical components: manganese (Mn),<br>
silicon (Si), magnesium (Mg), copper (Cu),<br>
titanium (Ti), iron (Fe). By way of example, the<br>
following metal foils can be used: AA3005<br>
(Al Mn 1 Mg 0.5); AA3003 (Al Mn 1 Cu) ; AA3103<br>
(Al Mn 1); and AA 8001 (Al Fe Si)<br>
Surprisingly, tests have shown that relatively high<br>
heating rates can be achieved with honeycomb bodies of<br>
this type. For example, it is possible, using suitable<br>
heat sources, as described below, for the metal foils<br>
to be heated to the desired temperature wthin just, two<br>
seconds. It is in this way possible to achieve<br>
extremely short production cycles. If, for example, the<br>
configuration of the contact zones between the metal<br>
foils or with a tubular casing surrounding them is not<br>
completely uniform, however, it may also be necessary<br>
to perform slightly slower heating, so that the desired<br>
temperature range is only reached after 15 to 30<br>
seconds. Furthermore, only certain conditions should be<br>
used, since increased oxidation of the surface of the<br>
metal foils is then observed, making further uniform<br>
introduction of heat considerably more difficult.<br>
According to the invention, the temperature is<br>
approximately between 450°C and 600°C. In this context,<br>
what solder is used if appropriate to form a connection<br>
by a joining technique between the metal foils is of<br>
crucial importance. If, for example, a zinc-based<br>
solder is used, under certain circumstances<br>
temperatures of only approx. 450°C to approximately<br>
530°C will be sufficient, in which case shorter heat-up<br>
times are preferably also required. However, if the<br>
metal foils are connected to one another for example<br>
using a solder based on aluminum/silicon, temperatures<br>
from approx. 560°C to approx. 600°C need to be set, in<br>
which case longer heating times may need to be used. In<br>
particular in the case of the latter solders, it is<br>
accordingly necessary to carry out heating up to<br>
temperatures which are only just below the melting<br>
point of the metal foil itself. In particular, the<br>
temperatures are in a range which is less than 70°C, in<br>
particular less than 50°C or even less than 3 0°C below<br>
the melting point of the metal foils which are to be<br>
connected to one another.<br>
On account of the short heat-up time to these high<br>
temperatures and a targeted heating of predeterminable<br>
subregions, the result is a very efficient and<br>
energy-saving method. This also has the advantage that.<br>
the proposed process is suitable in particular for the<br>
series production or mass production of metallic<br>
honeycomb bodies.<br>
Furthermore, it is proposed that radiant heaters which<br>
generate a targeted infrared heating radiation are used<br>
to heat the honeycomb structure, generating a clear<br>
temperature drop in the vicinity of the outside of the<br>
at least one subregion. The spatially very tightly<br>
restricted introduction of heat on account of the<br>
substantially parallel infrared heating radiation leads<br>
to a very uniformly distributed thermal energy and<br>
therefore to very uniform formation of connections<br>
within the heated subregions. Consequently, the process<br>
according to the invention produces metallic honeycomb<br>
bodies which have high-quality connections between the<br>
metal foils formed by a joining technique, with this<br>
heating process being of only a short duration.<br>
According to a further configuration of the process,<br>
the honeycomb structure has passages running<br>
approximately parallel to an axis, the heating<br>
radiation being directed onto an end side of the<br>
honeycomb structure in such a manner that the honeycomb<br>
structure is heated only in subregions with an axial<br>
depth which is less than the axial length of the<br>
passages. This allows the production of honeycomb<br>
bodies whose metal foils are, for example, connected to<br>
one another only in the vicinity of the end side, with<br>
in particular a thermally induced compensating<br>
expansion of the metal foils with respect to one<br>
another being ensured. In this context, the term end<br>
side is to be understood as meaning the surface in<br>
which the end faces of the passages are substantially<br>
arranged.<br>
in which the metal foils, prior to heating, are at<br>
least partially introduced into a tubular casing, are<br>
connected to one another by a joining technique, and<br>
are then completely inserted into the tubular casing,<br>
and a number of the metal foils are connected to the<br>
tubular casing by a joining technique. It is in this<br>
case possible, for example, to use different radiant<br>
heaters, in which case, at least during the connection<br>
of the metal foils to one another, a relatively<br>
homogenous distribution of the heat capacity in the<br>
subregions is ensured. Therefore, a radiant heater with<br>
a somewhat lower energy can be used for this connection<br>
than subsequently during the generation of the<br>
connection between tubular casing and honeycomb<br>
structure.<br>
According to a further configuration of the process,<br>
prior to the heating, the metal foils are completely<br>
introduced into the tubular casing, with the tubular<br>
casing preferably projecting beyond the end sides of<br>
the honeycomb structure. This has the advantage that,<br>
after the connections by a joining technique have been<br>
formed, the metal foils no longer have to be moved<br>
relative to the tubular casing.<br>
According to yet another configuration of the process,<br>
the metal foils, prior to heating, are arranged on the<br>
outside of an inner tube, in such a way that the metal<br>
foils form passages running substantially transversely<br>
to the inner tube, with a number of metal foils being<br>
connected to the inner tube by a joining technique.<br>
Therefore, the invention also provides, for example, a<br>
process for producing honeycomb bodies through which<br>
fluid can flow in a radial direction, in which process<br>
the inner tube in particular has openings, through<br>
which the inner tube, which has incoming flow<br>
centrally, allows a gas to flow out into the radially<br>
outwardly directed passages, or vice versa.<br>
It is particularly advantageous for adjacent sections<br>
of the tubular casing or the inner tube to be heated<br>
simultaneously, if appropriate with the aid of<br>
inductively acting heating. It is in this way also<br>
possible to produce a connection by a joining technique<br>
between a number of metal foils and the tubular casing<br>
or the inner tube, with the result that the production<br>
of connections by a joining technique both between the<br>
metal foils and from metal foils to the tubular casing<br>
or inner tube is carried out in one process step,<br>
thereby in particular reducing the manufacturing time.<br>
In this context, however, it should be taken into<br>
account that the heat-up times required to reach a<br>
defined temperature may have to be lengthened if the<br>
tubular casing or inner tube is also to be heated. This<br>
is caused in particular by the different heat<br>
capacities of the metal foils and the tubular casing or<br>
inner tube.<br>
According to yet another configuration of the process,<br>
the at least one end side of the honeycomb structure is<br>
completely heated to a predeterminable depth. This<br>
leads to complete end-side connection of metal foils,<br>
preventing, for example, ends of the metal foils<br>
arranged at the end side from being made to vibrate on<br>
account of pressure fluctuations occurring in an<br>
exhaust-gas stream, since such vibrations could cause<br>
adjacent connections formed by a joining technique to<br>
become detached on account of mechanical fatigue<br>
stresses. Accordingly, the formation of connections<br>
between the metal foils by a joining technique over the<br>
entire end side of the honeycomb structure for example<br>
increases the service life of a honeycomb body used as<br>
a catalyst support body in an exhaust system.<br>
If the honeycomb structure has passages running<br>
approximately parallel to an axis, according to a<br>
further configuration of the process, the depth of the<br>
heated subregions is varied, with heating preferably<br>
being carried out to a greater depth in subregions of<br>
the honeycomb structure which are arranged radially<br>
outward than in subregions which are arranged radially<br>
inward. With regard to a configuration of a honeycomb<br>
body through which medium can flow in the radial<br>
direction, of course, a correspondingly varying depth<br>
in the axial direction and/or circumferential direction<br>
of the honeycomb body is also possible. It is in this<br>
way possible, for example, to achieve a more stable<br>
connection between the honeycomb body and the tubular<br>
casing or inner tube than the connections between the<br>
metal foils formed by a joining technique.<br>
According to a further configuration of the process,<br>
the heating radiation impinges on the at least one end<br>
side of the honeycomb structure at an angle of between<br>
10° and 80°. The angle selected in this case has<br>
effects on the depth up to which the honeycomb<br>
structure is heated. At angles of less than 10°, the<br>
heating radiation extends over a relatively large<br>
subregion of the end side, with the result that the<br>
thermal energy generated by the radiant heater is<br>
distributed over larger subregions, thereby reducing<br>
the introduction of energy per unit area and slowing<br>
the heating process. Angles of greater than 80° should<br>
likewise be avoided, since in this case a large<br>
proportion of the heating radiation or thermal energy<br>
passes directly through the honeycomb structure and<br>
cannot be used to heat the metal foils. Furthermore,<br>
the external shape of the end side should be taken into<br>
account when selecting the angle. If this comprises,<br>
for example, a telescopic arrangement of metal foils,<br>
in which adjacent metal foils are arranged partially<br>
offset with respect to one another, by way of example<br>
relatively large or relatively small angles should be<br>
used depending on the type of telescopic arrangement,<br>
whereas if the end side is substantially planar, angles<br>
in a range from 30° to 60° are preferred<br>
According to yet another configuration of the process,<br>
the honeycomb body is moved relative to the at least<br>
one radiant heater during the heating operation, with<br>
the result that, with the aid of a radiant heater which<br>
emits a spatially limited heating radiation, if<br>
appropriate even large subregions of the honeycomb<br>
structure, in particular the entire end side of the<br>
honeycomb structure, are heated. According to a process<br>
variant, it is proposed to execute a rotational<br>
relative movement of the at least one radiant heater<br>
about the axis of the honeycomb body, thereby likewise<br>
ensuring a large-area and uniform heating of the<br>
honeycomb structure.<br>
It is preferable for the relative movement between<br>
honeycomb body and the at least one radiant heater to<br>
be generated by the honeycomb body rotating about its<br>
axis and/or the angle between the radiation axis of the<br>
at least one radiant heater and the axis of the<br>
honeycomb body being varied. This ensures that the<br>
heating radiation penetrates down to the desired depth<br>
of the honeycomb structure irrespective of whether the<br>
subregions to be heated are located close to a<br>
projecting tubular casing or in centrally arranged<br>
subregions of the end side.<br>
According to yet another configuration of the process,<br>
the connections by a joining technique are produced by<br>
soldering, sintering and/or diffusion welding. It is in<br>
this case particularly advantageous for solder,<br>
diffusion promoter or the like to be arranged in the<br>
subregions prior to the heating used to form the<br>
connections by a joining technique. It is preferable<br>
for the connections produced by a joining technique to<br>
be formed by soldering, in which case solder is<br>
arranged in the subregions prior to the heating<br>
operation. As a result, the temperatures which are<br>
required to form the connection produced by a joining<br>
technique are kept at a relatively low level, so that<br>
relatively short cycle times for the formation of the<br>
connections can be maintained.<br>
If particularly high temperatures (in particular higher<br>
than 550°C) occur during the production of the<br>
connection by a joining technique, it is advantageous<br>
for these connections to be produced under shielding<br>
gas. Known shielding gases, in particular with an argon<br>
content, are suitable for this purpose.<br>
In the text which follows, the process according to the<br>
invention is described in more detail in conjunction<br>
with an apparatus which is suitable for carrying out<br>
the process.<br>
The apparatus for producing metallic honeycomb bodies,<br>
in particular for carrying out the process according to<br>
the invention, comprises a positioning surface for<br>
positioning a honeycomb body during a heating<br>
operation, and at least one radiant heater with a<br>
radiation axis. The apparatus is distinguished by the<br>
fact that the positioning surface and the radiation<br>
axis of the radiant heater include an angle of from 10°<br>
to 80°. In this case, the radiant heater is in<br>
particular configured in such a way that it radiates at<br>
an angle of 10° to 80° with respect to the end side of<br>
a honeycomb body fixed on the positioning surface. The<br>
radiant heater allows rapid heating of subregions of<br>
the honeycomb body to form connections produced by a<br>
joining technique.<br>
To ensure that subregions of the honeycomb body are<br>
heated as uniformly as possible, the positioning<br>
surface is preferably pivotable, so that the angle is<br>
adjustable, in particular even during the heating<br>
operation. This can also be achieved by a further<br>
configuration of the apparatus in which the at least<br>
one infrared radiant heater is pivotable.<br>
In the apparatus, the distance between the positioning<br>
surface and the at least one infrared radiant heater<br>
can be varied. It is in this context particularly<br>
advantageous for the at least one infrared radiant<br>
heater to be movable on predeterminable paths with<br>
respect to the positioning surface. It is in this way<br>
possible to ensure, for example, that the connections<br>
produced by a joining technique are generated over a<br>
varying depth in different subregions of the heated end<br>
side. With a view to superimposing a plurality of<br>
relative movements of honeycomb body and the at least<br>
one infrared radiant heater, it is particularly<br>
advantageous for these movements to be adapted to one<br>
another, in particular by the individual movements<br>
being recorded by metre-logical means and/or coordinated<br>
by means of a common, preferably computer-controlled<br>
control unit.<br>
The positioning surface also has, for example, holding<br>
means for fixing the honeycomb body. This ensures that<br>
a desired positioning of the honeycomb body with<br>
respect to the at least one infrared radiant heater is<br>
maintained. Holding means of this type are important in<br>
particular if the positioning surface is part of an<br>
assembly line. An assembly line of this type allows the<br>
production of metallic honeycomb bodies in a continuous<br>
process, which is particularly suitable on account of<br>
the short heat-up times of the honeycomb body effected<br>
by means of the infrared radiant heaters.<br>
Moreover, it is possible to provide mirrors for<br>
diverting or reflecting the heating radiation. This is<br>
to be understood in particular as meaning parts of the<br>
heating radiation which have already been reflected by<br>
the metal foils. Accordingly, the use of mirrors of<br>
this type leads to improved utilization of the heating<br>
radiation generated by the infrared radiant heaters.<br>
However, it is also possible for radiation to be<br>
radiated directly onto the mirrors and in this way<br>
diverted onto the subregions to be heated, in which<br>
case, for example, projections or shoulders projecting<br>
into the direct radiation axis in the vicinity of the<br>
end side of the honeycomb body can be "bypassed".<br>
If the connections produced by a joining technique are<br>
produced at very high temperatures, the apparatus has<br>
means for generating a local shielding gas atmosphere,<br>
in particular a housing. In this case, the housing<br>
encloses at least sections close to the subregion of<br>
the honeycomb body which is heated with the aid of the<br>
infrared radiant heaters, in which case impeding of the<br>
direct heating radiation should be avoided.<br>
The process will now be explained in more detail on the<br>
basis of the following drawings. However, the<br>
explanations presented in this context in this respect<br>
do not constitute any restriction of the invention.<br>
In the drawing:<br>
fig. 1 shows an embodiment of a honeycomb body which<br>
has been produced,<br>
fig. 2 shows an embodiment of a production apparatus,<br>
and<br>
fig. 3 shows a second embodiment of a production<br>
apparatus.<br>
Figure 1 shows a diagrammatic and perspective<br>
illustration of an aluminum-containing honeycomb body 1<br>
with stacked metal foils 2 which have been wound in an<br>
S shape. The honeycomb body 1 has passages 5 which are<br>
formed using smooth and corrugated metal foils 2. The<br>
passages 5 and the metal foils 2 form a corresponding<br>
honeycomb structure 3. The honeycomb structure 3 is<br>
surrounded by a tubular casing 6 which projects beyond<br>
the end sides 7 of the honeycomb body 1. The<br>
individual, open end faces 26 of the passages 5 are in<br>
this case arranged substantially in the planar end<br>
sides 7 of the honeycomb body 1.<br>
The production of the aluminum-containing honeycomb<br>
body 1 illustrated comprises, for example, the<br>
following steps:<br>
selecting at least partially structured metal<br>
foils based on aluminum;<br>
stacking and S-shaped winding at least partially<br>
structured metal foils to form a honeycomb<br>
structure 3 with passages 5 running approximately<br>
parallel to an axis 4 (not shown);<br>
completely introducing the metal foils 2 into the<br>
tubular casing 6, with the tubular casing<br>
projecting beyond the end sides 7 of the honeycomb<br>
structure 3 ;<br>
completely heating an end side 7 of the honeycomb<br>
structure 3 with the aid of at least one radiant<br>
heater 8 (not shown), with the heating radiation<br>
being directed onto the open end faces 26 of the<br>
passages 5, in such a manner that the honeycomb<br>
structure 3, in a subregion 9 with an axial depth<br>
10 (shorter than the axial length 11 of the<br>
passages 5), is heated in such a way that this<br>
subregion 9 is at a temperature of approximately<br>
450°C to approximately 600°C after only<br>
approximately 2 seconds to approximately 3 0<br>
seconds;<br>
connecting the metal foils 2 to one another and<br>
the radially 13 outer regions of the metal foils 2<br>
to the tubular casing 6 by a joining technique,<br>
the connection produced by a joining technique<br>
being effected by soldering.<br>
Figure 2 shows a diagrammatic and perspective<br>
illustration of a first embodiment of an apparatus for<br>
producing metallic, aluminum-containing honeycomb<br>
bodies 1. The apparatus has a positioning surface 16<br>
for positioning a honeycomb body 1 during a heating<br>
operation and an infrared radiant heater 8 with a<br>
radiation axis 15. The radiation axis 15 and the end<br>
side 7 of the honeycomb body 1, which is approximately<br>
parallel to the positioning surface 16, at least at<br>
times include an angle 14 of from 10° to 80°. The<br>
honeycomb body 1 is in this case fixed by means of<br>
holding means 19. The distance 17 from the infrared<br>
radiant heater 8 to the point at which the heating<br>
radiation impinges on the end side 7 of the honeycomb<br>
body 1 is to be selected in such a way as to ensure<br>
that the honeycomb structure 3 is heated to the<br>
predetermined depth 10 as quickly as possible.<br>
It is in this context particularly advantageous for the<br>
infrared radiant heater 8 to be moved on a path 18<br>
relative to the honeycomb body 1, preferably with the<br>
angle 14 being varied. The path 18 is illustrated in<br>
the shape of a circle, but in particular any desired<br>
path 18 can be generated using a computer-controlled<br>
movement. For improved utilization of the heating<br>
radiation, the apparatus has a mirror 21, which throws<br>
any reflected heating radiation back onto the honeycomb<br>
structure 3. Since very rapid heating of subregions of<br>
the honeycomb body 1 is possible in this way, this type<br>
of formation of connections by a joining technique is<br>
recommended for use as a continuous process. The<br>
positioning surface 16 in this case forms part of an<br>
assembly line 22.<br>
Figure 3 shows a second embodiment of an apparatus for<br>
producing a metallic honeycomb body 1 through which<br>
medium can flow in the radial direction. The honeycomb<br>
body 1 in this case has a plurality of layers of<br>
structured and smooth metal foils 2, which form<br>
passages 5 running substantially transversely with<br>
respect to a centrally arranged inner tube 27, or<br>
radially outward. The honeycomb body 1 is fixed<br>
relative to the positioning surface 16 using holding<br>
means 19, with the honeycomb body extending through the<br>
positioning surface 16. The honeycomb body 1 is<br>
surrounded by a housing 22, which serves in particular<br>
to form a shielding gas atmosphere in the interior. For<br>
this purpose, by way of example, argon-containing<br>
shielding gas is fed into the interior of the central<br>
inner tube 27 from an end side 7 of the honeycomb body<br>
1 by means of a nozzle 22 and emerges again from the<br>
open end faces 26 of the passages 5, with the<br>
connections produced by a joining technique being<br>
formed in a shielding gas atmosphere using the infrared<br>
radiant heater 8. For this purpose, the housing has<br>
openings 24 which ensure unimpeded heating of the<br>
honeycomb structure 3 along the radiation axis 15. In<br>
this context, the arrow 25 indicates that the honeycomb<br>
body 1 rotates for example during the heating<br>
operation, in which case the radiant heater 8<br>
preferably radiates onto the end side 7 of the<br>
honeycomb body 1 at different angles 14 within a range<br>
from 10° to 80°. Uniform heating and therefore also a<br>
high-quality connection by a joining technique are<br>
ensured in this way. Furthermore, the embodiment<br>
illustrated offers the possibility of double-sided and<br>
simultaneous heating of both end sides 7 of the<br>
honeycomb body 1. The production times for an<br>
aluminum-containing honeycomb body 1 of this type could<br>
be further reduced in this way.<br>
