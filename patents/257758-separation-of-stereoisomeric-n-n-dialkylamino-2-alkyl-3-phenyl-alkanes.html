Separation of stereo isomeric N,N-dialkylamino-2-alkyl-3-hydroxy-3-<br>
phenylalkanes<br>
The invention concerns a method for the separation of stereoisomeric N,N-dialkyl-<br>
amino-2-alkyl-3-hydroxy-3-phenylalkanes.<br>
Opioids have been used for many years as analgesics for the treatment of pain<br>
although they can induce a number of side effects, for example addiction and<br>
dependency, respiratory depression, gastro-intestinal inhibition and constipation.<br>
Over an extended period or at high doses they can only be administered with<br>
particular precautionary measures such as special prescribing requirements.<br>
It is known that certain N,N-dialkylamino-2-alkyl-3-hydroxy-3-phenylalkanes<br>
(especially 1-phenyl-3-dimethylaminopropane compounds) possess analgesic<br>
activity without causing the side effects typical of opioids. These compounds are<br>
characterised by a pronounced analgesic action that is significantly increased in<br>
comparison with, for example, the opioid tramadol.<br><br>
These analgesically active N,N-dialkylamino-2-alkyl-3-hydroxy-3-phenylalkanes are<br>
chiral. Since two chiral centres are usually present, the compounds exist in the form<br>
of 4 stereoisomers, i.e. two enantiomeric pairs that are diastereomeric with one<br>
another.<br>
The activity of an analgesic is frequently attributable to its interaction with a certain<br>
receptor of a human or animal cell. Since these receptors are constructed of chiral<br>
amino acids and optionally also chiral glycosides, their interaction with chiral<br>
pharmaceuticals is stereoselective. Therefore the pharmacological activity of chiral<br>
pharmaceuticals is frequently different for the individual stereoisomers.<br>
There is therefore a requirement for a method for the separation of the<br>
stereoisomers, i.e. the diastereoisomers and enantiomers, of N,N-dialkylamino-2-<br>
alkyl-3-hydroxy-3-phenylalkanes.<br>
The synthesis of (2RS,3RS)-1-dimethylamino-3-(3-methoxyphenyl)-2-methylpentan- <br>
3-ol is known from of EP-A 693475.The separation of the diastereoisomers, that is <br>
the two enantiomeric pairs, is carried out by hydrochloride precipitation with<br>
trimethylchlorosilane/water in 2-butanone. The racemic mixture of the two<br>
enantiomers of (2R,3R) and (2S,3S) configuration is carried out by separation on a<br>
chiral HPLC column.<br>
However, the chromatographic separation of enantiomers on chiral stationary phases<br>
is usually unsuitable for relatively large quantities of active compounds and is instead<br>
used almost solely for analytical purposes. There is therefore a requirement for a<br>
method that is also suitable for the separation of the enantiomers of chiral<br>
N,N-dialkylamino-2-alkyl-3-hydroxy-3-phenylalkanes on a preparative scale.<br>
Thus the problem that forms the basis of the invention is to provide a method for the<br>
separation of the stereoisomers, preferably enantiomers, of chiral N,N-dialkylamino-<br>
2-alkyl-3-hydroxy-3-phenylalkanes that can also be carried out on the gram and<br>
kilogram scale. The method must be cost-effective and guarantee a good yield and<br>
high enantiomeric purity.<br><br>
This object is achieved by the subject matter of the claims. It has surprisingly been<br>
found that the isolation of a stereoisomer from a mixture comprising the two<br>
stereoisomers of the general formulae (l-A) and (l-A') and/or the two stereoisomers<br>
of the general formulae (l-B) and (l-B'),<br><br>
in which<br>
R1, R2 and R3, identical or different, are selected from the group consisting -H,<br>
-F, -CI, C1-C6-alkyl, -S-C1-C6-alkyl, -OH, -O-C1-C6-alkyl,<br>
-O-C1-C6-alkylenephenyl, -OCO-C1-C6-alkyl, -OCON(C1-C6-alkyl)2 and<br>
-O-SiR8R9R10 (in which R8, R9 and R10, identical or different, are -C1-C6-alkyl<br>
or-phenyl);<br>
R4 is -H or -C1-C6-alkyI;<br>
R5 is -C1-C6-alkyl; and<br>
R6 and R7, identical or different, are -H or -C1-C6-alkyl;<br>
or their salts with organic or inorganic acids;<br>
is possible by a method comprising the step<br>
(a) manipulating the mixture ratio of the stereoisomers in the mixture so that at<br>
least one of the stereoisomers, preferably the stereoisomer to be isolated, is<br>
present in an enantiomeric excess.<br>
It has surprisingly been found that individual stereoisomers may be crystallised with<br>
high stereoselectivity from the mixture of stereoisomers when at least one of the<br>
stereoisomers is not present in racemic mixture, but instead in an enantiomeric<br>
excess.<br><br>
The compounds of the general formula (I) exhibit at least two chiral centres. The<br>
compounds can be synthesised in different ways. For example, it is possible firstly to<br>
prepare a Mannich base in a Mannich reaction by which means the first chiral centre<br>
is produced:<br><br>
If the Mannich reaction takes place without chiral induction, i.e. in the absence of<br>
chiral auxiliaries, chiral catalysts, chiral solvents, etc., the Mannich base is formed as<br>
a racemic mixture, since transition states leading to the two enantiomeric Mannich<br>
bases are enantiomorphic and thus energetically identical.<br>
The second chiral centre can be introduced, for example, by reaction of the Mannich<br>
base with a Grignard reagent at the carbonyl:<br><br>
In this way, the four stereoisomeric N,N-dialkylamino-2-alkyl-3-hydroxy-3-phenyl-<br>
alkanes of the general formulae (l-A), (l-A'), (l-B) and (l-B') are formed from the<br><br>
racemic Mannich base. Depending on the substitution pattern at the two chiral<br>
centres, the R- or S-configuration is in each case formed.<br>
In principal, it is also possible for further chiral centres also to be present in one of<br>
the side chains. In the case of three chiral centres, the number of stereoisomers<br>
increases to a total of eight, four enantiomeric pairs being present. The N,N-dialkyl-<br>
amino-2-alkyl-3-hydroxy-3-phenylalkanes preferably comprise only two chiral<br>
centres.<br>
Preferably, the stereoisomers (l-A) and (l-A') on the one hand and the stereoisomers<br>
(l-B) and (l-B') on the other are in each case enantiomeric to one another. In other<br>
respects the stereoisomers are diastereoisomeric among one another. Stereoisomer<br>
(l-A) is accordingly preferably enantiomeric to (l-A) and diastereoisomeric to (l-B)<br>
and (l-B'), stereoisomer (l-A') is enantiomeric to (l-A) and diastereoisomeric to (l-B)<br>
and (l-B'), stereoisomer (l-B) is diastereomeric to (l-A) and (l-A') and enantiomeric to<br>
(l-B'), and finally stereoisomer (l-B') is diastereoisomeric to (l-A) and (l-A') and<br>
enantiomeric to (l-B).<br>
If, for example, in step (a) of the method of the invention the mixture ratio of the<br>
stereoisomers in the mixture is manipulated in such a way that the stereoisomer of<br>
the general formula (l-A') is present in an enantiomeric excess, the excess relates to<br>
the relative amount of its enantiomer, i.e. preferably to the stereoisomer of the<br>
general formula (l-A). The mixture ratio of the optionally likewise present<br>
stereoisomers, for example of the general formulae (l-B) and (l-B') need not<br>
necessarily be manipulated, such that these may also (optionally still) be present, for<br>
example, in the racemic mixture.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the method of the invention, this serves to isolate one<br>
stereoisomer from a mixture comprising the two stereoisomers of the general<br>
formulae (l-A) and (l-A'), but not, however, the two stereoisomers of the general<br>
formulae (l-B) and (l-B'). In another preferred embodiment of the method of the<br>
invention, this serves to isolate one stereoisomer, preferably of the general formula<br>
(l-A) or (l-A), from a mixture of all four stereoisomers, i.e. the stereoisomers of the<br>
general formulae (l-A), (l-A'), (l-B) and (l-B').<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment of the method of the invention, the manipulation in step<br>
(a) is carried out<br>
by addition of the stereoisomer which is to be present in excess, or<br>
by enantioselective synthesis of the stereoisomers.<br>
The manipulation in step (a) has the consequence that at least one of the<br>
stereoisomers is present in an enantiomeric excess. This means preferably that it is<br>
relatively enriched in relation to its enantiomer. This enrichment can be achieved in<br>
different ways. On the one hand, it involves achieving an enantiomeric excess during<br>
the course of synthesis of the stereoisomers, on the other it also involves shifting the<br>
relative weight ratio of the two enantiomers of a mixture originally present as a<br>
racemate in respect of these two stereoisomers/enantiomers. The latter variant can<br>
be achieved, for example, by external addition or enantioselective derivatisation of<br>
one of the two enantiomers (e.g. kinetic racemate separation).<br>
If the manipulation in step (a) is carried out by addition of the stereoisomer which is<br>
to be present in enantiomeric excess, it can be isolated previously by separate<br>
isolation from a mixture of the stereoisomers. For example, it is possible to this end<br>
initially to separate the diastereoisomers by selective precipitation of the one<br>
enantiomeric pair as hydrochlorides. In this way, the two stereoisomers of the<br>
general formula (l-A) and (l-A') (enantiomeric pair 1) may be separated from the two<br>
stereoisomers of the general formula (l-B) and l-B') (enantiomeric pair 2). The<br>
separation of the two enantiomers, i.e. the separation of the racemic enantiomeric<br>
pairs 1 and 2, respectively, can then be carried out with the aid of chiral auxiliaries,<br>
for example, chiral acids.<br>
It has now surprisingly been found that the two enantiomers of the general formulae<br>
(l-A) and (l-A') may be selectively precipitated with the aid of (+)- and (-)-di-O,O'-p-<br>
toluyltartaric acid, the respective other enantiomer remaining in the mother liquor.<br>
One aspect of the invention thus concerns a method for racemate separation of the<br>
two enantiomers of the general formulae (l-A) and (l-A) comprising the addition of<br>
(+)- or (-)-di-O,O'-p-toluyltartaric acid. A suitable solvent is, for example, 2-butanone.<br><br>
The two enantiomers of the general formulae (l-A) and (l-A') are dissolved in the<br>
solvent. Depending upon the configuration of the tartaric acid derivative used, a<br>
stereoselective precipitation of the enantiomer of the general formula (l-A) or (l-A') as<br>
addition salt takes place after its addition<br>
Owing to the comparatively high cost of the enantiomerically pure tartaric acid<br>
derivative ((-)- or (+)-di-O,O'-p-toluyltartaric acid) as a chiral auxiliary, this method is<br>
only of limited use for enantiomeric separation on a preparative scale. This method is<br>
preferably merely used initially to obtain the respective enantiomerically pure<br>
stereoisomers of the general formula (l-A) and (l-A') and, through their addition to the<br>
reaction mixture, to manipulate the relative weight ratio in favour of one or the other<br>
stereoisomer for the purposes of step (a) of the method of the invention, i.e. to<br>
produce an enantiomeric excess.<br>
Alternatively, a small but sufficient amount of the enantiomerically pure compounds<br>
can be obtained by HPLC on a chiral stationary phase.<br>
In principle, it is also conceivable for the manipulation in step (a) of the method of the<br>
invention not to take place by the addition of one enantiomer, but instead by<br>
selective removal of the other enantiomer. Thus, for example, alternatively to<br>
enrichment of one of the two enantiomers, one of the two enantiomers may be<br>
selectively degraded. In this connection, it is for example conceivable to carry out<br>
selective enzymatic derivatisation of one stereoisomer, as a result of which its<br>
enantiomer is present in excess.<br>
The manipulation in step (a) of the method of the invention can also be carried out by<br>
enantioselective synthesis of the stereoisomers. In this case, enantioselectivity can<br>
be induced at different steps of the synthesis. Thus it is, for example, possible to<br>
induce an excess of one of the two resulting enantiomers by suitable measures even<br>
at the stage of the aforementioned Mannich reaction. Suitable measures are known<br>
to a person skilled in the art. Alternatively, it is also possible, for example, to induce<br>
an enantiomeric excess by enantioselective reaction control in the also previously<br>
described Grignard reaction (or an equivalent reaction with another organometallic<br>
reagent) subsequent to the Mannich reaction. Suitable methods are known to a<br><br>
person skilled in the art here too. Ojima, Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis, 2nd ed.,<br>

In a preferred embodiment, the enantiomeric excess after carrying out step (a) of the<br>
method of the invention is at least 1.0% ee, more preferably at least 2.5% ee, still<br>
more preferably at least 5.0% ee, most preferably at least 7.5% ee and in particular<br>
at least 10% ee. However, the enantiomeric excess is preferably at most 25% ee,<br>
more preferably at most 20% ee and in particular at most 15% ee.<br><br>
[(-)] denoting the concentration of the dextrorotatory and levorotatory enantiomer and<br>
a positive number always being obtained.<br>
Suitable methods for the determination of the enantiomeric excess are familiar to a<br>
person skilled in the art. HPLC on chiral stationary bases and NMR investigations<br>
with chiral shift reagents may be mentioned by way of example.<br>
The method of the invention is successful with N,N-dialkylamino-2-alkyl-3-hydroxy-3-<br>
phenylalkanes of different structure.<br>
In a preferred embodiment R1 and R3 are -H. Preferred substitution patterns of the<br>
phenyl ring (R1, R2 and R3) are summarised in the following table:<br><br><br><br>
R1 and R3 are particularly preferably in each case -H and R2 is -O-C1-C6-alkyl, preferably<br>
-OCH3, or -OH. R4 is preferably -C1-C6-alkyl, preferentially -CH3 or -CH2CH3. R5 is<br>
preferably -C1-C6-alkyl, preferentially -CH3. R6 and R7 are preferably in each case -C1-C6-<br>
alkyl, preferentially -CH3. R4 is particularly preferably -CH2CH3 and R5, R6 and R7 are in<br>
each case -CH3.<br>
"C1-C6-alkyl" for the purpose of the description means a linear or branched, cyclic or<br>
open-chain saturated hydrocarbon residue with 1 to 6 carbon atoms, optionally<br>
substituted with 1 to 6 halogen atoms (identical or different, selected from F, CI and Br).<br>
Examples	are	-CH3,	-CF3,	-CH2F,	-CHF2,	-CH2CH3,<br>
-CH(CH3)2, -CH2CH2CH3, -CH(CH3)CH2CH3, -CH2CH(CH3)CH3, -C(CH3)3, -CH2CH2CH2CH3,<br>
etc.<br>
"C1-C6-alkylene" for the purposes of the description means a linear or branched, cyclic or<br>
open-chain saturated hydrocarbon residue with 1 to 6 carbon atoms, optionally<br>
substituted with 1 to 6 halogen atoms (identical or different, selected from F, CI and Br).<br>
Examples are -CH2, -CH2CH2-, -CH(CH3)CH2-, -CH2CH2CH2-, -CH(CH3)CH2CH2-, -<br>
CH2CH(CH3)CH2-, -C(CH3)2CH2-, -CH(CH3)CH(CH3)-, - CH2CH2CH2CH2- etc.<br>
In one particularly preferred embodiment of the method of the invention R1 is -H, R2 -<br>
OCH3, R3-H, R4-CH2CH3, R5-CH3, R6-CH3 and R7-CH3, such that the stereoisomers of the<br>
general formula (I-A), (I-AO, (I-B) and (I-B7) are l-dimethyl-amino-3-(3-methoxyphenyl)-<br>
2-methylpentan-3-ol.<br>
In this instance, the stereoisomer of the general formula (I-A) is (2S,3S)-l-dimethyl-<br>
amino-3-(3-methoxyphenyl)-2-methylpentan-3-ol, the stereoisomer of the general<br>
formula (I-A') is (2R, 3R)-l-dimethylamino-3-(3-methoxyphenyl)-2-methylpentan-3-ol,<br>
the stereoisomer of the general formula (I-B) is (2S, 3R)-l-dimethylamino-3-(3-<br>
methoxyphenyl)-2-methylpentan-3-ol, and the stereoisomer of the general formula<br><br>
(I-B') is (2R,3S)-1-dimethylamino-3-(3-methoxyphenyl)-2-methylpentan-3-ol, or their<br>
salts with organic or inorganic acids.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the method of the invention comprises the step<br>
(bi) addition of a chiral compound of the general formula (II) or (IT)<br><br>
The chiral compound of the general formula (II) or (IT) is preferably added in optically<br>
pure form. Its enantiomeric excess is preferably at least 90% ee, more preferably at<br>
least 95%ee, most preferably 98% ee and in particular at least 99% ee.<br>
The chiral compounds of the general formula (II) or (II') are tartaric acid or its<br>
derivatives. The configuration of the two chiral centres is either R,R or S,S. Tartaric<br>
acid and many of its derivatives are available commercially in enantiomerically pure<br>
form.<br>
R11 is preferably -H or -CO-p-tolyl.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the method of the invention comprises the step<br>
(b2) addition of phosphoric acid.<br>
The addition of phosphoric acid preferably serves to convert at least one of the<br>
stereoisomers into the phosphate, hydrogenphosphate or dihydrogenphosphate and<br>
consequently to induce selective crystallisation. By means of the stoichiometric ratio<br>
between the amount of phosphoric acid added and the stereoisomers of the general<br>
formulae (l-A), (l-A'), (l-B) and (l-B') it is possible to exert an influence upon whether<br><br>
salt formation takes place as phosphate (PO43-), hydrogenphosphate (HPO42) or<br>
dihydrogenphosphate (H2PO4").<br>
Besides the addition of a suitable amount of phosphoric acid, the stereoisomers can<br>
be converted into the phosphate, hydrogenphosphate or dihydrogenphosphate in<br>
other ways. Such variants are known to a person skilled in the art, for example the<br>
addition of phosphate salts and subsequent acidification with mineral acids.<br>
Step (b1) or (b2) is preferably carried out under conditions that bring about the<br>
precipitation from a solution of the stereoisomer present in enantiomeric excess<br>
as salt of the chiral compound of the general formula (II) or (IT), or<br>
as phosphate, hydrogenphosphate or dihydrogenphosphate.<br>
If R11 is -H, the chiral compound of the general formula (II) or (IT) is tartaric acid. It<br>
has surprisingly been found that the stereoisomers of the general formulae (l-A) and<br>
(l-A') can in each case be precipitated selectively in step (b1) with one of the two<br>
tartaric acid enantiomers if care is first taken to ensure that the two enantiomers of<br>
the general formulae (l-A) and (l-A') are not present as a racemate, but instead one<br>
of the two enantiomers is present in excess.<br>
It has surprisingly been found that the enantiomeric purity of the precipitate is<br>
sometimes significantly greater than the enantiomeric excess before precipitation.<br>
The difference between the possibly somewhat low enantiomeric excess before<br>
precipitation and the enantiomeric purity of the precipitate can in some cases be<br>
quite considerable. Such crystallisation behaviour is unusual and represents a<br>
significant advantage of the method of the invention relative to conventional methods<br>
for racemate separation.<br>
By using the correct tartaric acid enantiomer it is possible to ensure that practically<br>
only the stereoisomer of the general formula (l-A) or (l-A') present in excess is<br>
precipitated, while the other enantiomer remains in the stock solution. The suitable<br>
enantiomer for the particular situation can be determined by simple preliminary<br>
investigations. Owing to the comparatively low costs of the two enantiomers of<br><br>
tartaric acid, this preferred embodiment of the method of the invention is also<br>
suitable for use on a preparative scale.<br>
Unlike with tartaric acid or its derivatives of the general formula (II) or (IT), in the case<br>
of addition of phosphoric acid in step (b2) no further chiral reagent is added. Instead,<br>
the separation of the stereoisomers is based preferentially on the different<br>
crystallisation behaviour of the phosphates, hydrogenphosphates or<br>
dihydrogenphosphates of the stereoisomers as such. It has surprisingly been found<br>
that one enantiomer can be selectively precipitated as phosphate,<br>
hydrogenphosphate or dihydrogenphosphate from a mixture of the two enantiomers<br>
of the general formulae (l-A) and (l-A') if care has been previously taken to ensure<br>
that it is present in a specific, but not necessarily particularly large, enantiomeric<br>
excess.<br>
This embodiment of the method of the invention is even suitable for the selective<br>
crystallization of one of the stereoisomers from the mixture of all four stereoisomers<br>
of the general formulae (l-A), (l-A'), (l-B) and (l-B'). It is accordingly not even<br>
necessary initially to carry out a diastereomeric separation, for example by<br>
precipitation of one enantiomeric pair as hydrochloride. Instead, selective<br>
precipitation is even successful from the immediate reaction product from the<br>
Grignard reaction. Ethanol, for example, is a suitable solvent for this purpose.<br>
The method of the invention has the advantage that in step (a) only a comparatively<br>
small enantiomeric excess of the stereoisomer need be brought about in order to<br>
achieve a high enantiomeric excess of the precipitate during the precipitation with a<br>
compound of the general formula (II) or (IT) or as phosphate, hydrogenphosphate or<br>
dihydrogenphosphate. If, for example, step (a) of the method of the invention is<br>
carried out with enantioselective reaction control, the enantioselectivity of the<br>
reaction accordingly need not lie in the region of 95% ee and above as is normally<br>
required. Instead, even significantly less pronounced enantioselectivities suffice in<br>
the synthesis in order ultimately to obtain a product with very high enantiomeric<br>
purity.<br><br>
The method of the invention preferably comprises the step<br>
(c)	separation of the precipitated salt obtained in step (b1) or (b2) from the<br>
supernatant solution.<br>
This can be achieved, for example, by decantation, filtration, centrifugation, etc.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the method of the invention comprises the step<br>
(d)	conversion of the salt separated in step (c) into the hydrochloride.<br>
Conversion of the separated salt into the hydrochloride can be achieved in different<br>
ways. In a preferred embodiment, the separated salt is first converted into the free<br>
base of the stereoisomer. This can be carried out by the addition of strong bases, for<br>
example NaOH or KOH.<br>
The free base of the stereoisomer released in this way may then either be initially<br>
isolated or converted directly into the hydrochloride in situ. It has surprisingly been<br>
found that improved yields are obtained during hydrochloride precipitation if<br>
hydrogen chloride is used in gaseous form in place of trimethylchlorosilane/water (cf.<br>
EP-A 693 475). Suitable solvents are, for example, acetone or 2-butanone.<br>
A further aspect of the invention concerns an addition salt of a stereoisomer of the<br>
general formula (l-A), (l-A'), (l-B) or (l-B') as defined above and<br>
