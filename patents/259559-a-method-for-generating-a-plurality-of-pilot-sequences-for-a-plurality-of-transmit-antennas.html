				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR PILOT MULTIPLEXING IN A WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
Claim of Priority under 35 U.S.C. §119<br>
[0001]	The present Application for Patent claims priority to Provisional Application<br>
Serial No. 60/760,482, entitled "METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR PILOT MULTIPLEXING IN A WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM," filed January 20, 2006, assigned to the assignee hereof, and expressly incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Field<br>
[0002]	The present disclosure relates generally to communication, and more specifically<br>
to techniques for transmitting pilots in a wireless communication system.<br>
Background<br>
[0003]	In a wireless communication system, a transmitter station (e.g., a base station or<br>
a terminal) may utilize multiple (T) transmit antennas for a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmission to a receiver station equipped with multiple (R) receive anteimas. The multiple transmit and receive anteimas form a MIMO channel that may be used to increase throughput and/or improve reliability. For example, the transmitter station may transmit up to T data streams simultaneously from the T transmit antermas to improve throughput. Alternatively, the transmitter station may transmit a single data stream from up to T transmit antennas to improve reception by the receiver station.<br>
[0004]	Good performance may be achieved if the MIMO chaimel response can be<br>
accurately estimated. For example, the receiver station may use the MIMO charmel response to perform data detection for the MIMO transmission, to select a spatial mapping matrix to be applied by the transmitter station for the MIMO transmission, etc. Channel estimation is typically supported by transmitting pilot symbols that are known a priori by the receiver station. The receiver station may then estimate the MIMO channel response based on the received pilot symbols and the known pilot symbols.<br>
[0005]	Channel estimates obtained based on pilot are typically impaired by both noise<br>
and interference.    The noise may come from various sources such as the wireless<br><br>
channel, receiver electronics, etc. The interference may include inter-antenna<br>
interference and inter-transmitter interference. Inter-anterma interference is interference<br>
due to transmissions from other transmit antennas. Inter-anterma pilot interference may<br>
be present if multiple pilot transmissions are sent simultaneously from all T transmit<br>
antennas and the pilot transmission from each antenna interferes with the pilot<br>
transmissions from the other antennas. Inter-transmitter interference is interference due<br>
to transmissions from other transmitter stations. Inter-transmitter interference may also<br>
be referred to as inter-sector interference, inter-cell interference, inter-terminal<br>
interference, etc. The inter-anterma interference and inter-transmitter interference may<br>
adversely impact channel estimation, which may then degrade data performance.<br>
)6]	There is therefore a need in the art for techniques to transmit pilot in a wireless<br>
communication system.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
)7]	According to an aspect, an apparatus is described which generates a plurality of<br>
pilot sequences for a plurality of transmit anteimas, with each pilot sequence comprising<br>
a plurality of pilot symbols sent in the time domain on a different set of subcarriers.<br>
The apparatus further generates a plurality of pilot transmissions for the plurality of<br>
transmit anteimas based on the plurality of pilot sequences.<br>
)8]	According to another aspect, an apparatus is described which generates a<br>
plurality of pilot sequences for a plurality of transmit antennas based on frequency-domain code division multiplexing (FD-CDM) of a constant amplitude zero auto¬correlation (CAZAC) sequence such as a Chu sequence defined by a transmitter-specific value. The apparatus further generates a plurality of pilot transmissions for the plurality of transmit antennas based on the plurality of pilot sequences.<br>
[0009]	According to yet another aspect, an apparatus is described which receives a<br>
plurality of pilot transmissions via a plurality of receive antennas, with each pilot transmission comprising a plurality of pilot symbols sent in the time domain on a different set of subcarriers. The apparatus processes the plurality of received pilot transmissions to obtain channel estimates.<br>
[0010]	According to yet another aspect, an apparatus is described which receives a<br>
plurality of pilot transmissions via a plurality of receive antennas, with the pilot transmissions being generated based on FD-CDM of a CAZAC sequence such as a Chu<br><br>
sequence defined by a transmitter-specific value. The apparatus processes the plurality of received pilot transmissions to obtain channel estimates.<br>
[0011]	According to yet another aspect, an apparatus is described which generates a<br>
plurality of pilot transmissions for a plurality of transmit antennas based on a first multiplexing scheme. The apparatus further generates a plurality of data transmissions for the plurality of transmit antennas based on a second multiplexing scheme that is different from the first multiplexing scheme.<br>
[0012]	According to yet another aspect, an apparatus is described which receives a<br>
plurality of pilot transmissions generated based on a first multiplexing scheme. The apparatus further receives a plurality of data transmissions generated based on a second multiplexing scheme that is different from the first multiplexing scheme. The plurality of pilot transmissions and the plurality of data transmissions are for a MIMO transmission sent from multiple transmit antennas to multiple receive antennas. The multiple transmit antennas may be located at a single transmitter station or multiple transmitter stations.<br>
[0013]	Various aspects and features of the disclosure are described in further detail<br>
below.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0021]	The   techniques   described   herein   may   be   used   for   various   wireless<br>
communication systems such as multiple-access communication systems, broadcast systems, wireless local area networks (WLANs), etc.    The terms "systems" and<br><br>
"networks" are often used interchangeably. The multiple-access systems may be code division multiple access (CDMA) systems, time division multiple access (TDMA) systems, frequency division multiple access (FDMA) systems, orthogonal FDMA (OFDMA) systems, single-carrier FDMA (SC-FDMA) systems, spatial division multiple access (SDMA) systems, etc. The techniques may also be used for systems that employ different multiple access schemes for the downlink and uplink, e.g., OFDMA for the downlink and SC-FDMA for the uplink. The downlink (or forward link) refers to the communication link from the base stations to the terminals, and the uplink (or reverse link) refers to the communication link from the terminals to the base stations.<br>
[0022]	An   OFDMA  system  utilizes   orthogonal   frequency   division  multiplexing<br>
(OFDM). An SC-FDMA system utilizes single-carrier frequency division multiplexing (SC-FDM). OFDM and SC-FDM partition the system bandwidth into multiple (K) orthogonal subcarriers, which are also commonly referred to as tones, bins, etc. Each subcarrier may be modulated with data. In general, symbols are sent in the frequency domain with OFDM and in the time domain with SC-FDM. SC-FDM includes (a) IFDM which transmits information on subcarriers that are uniformly distributed across a given frequency allocation and (b) localized frequency division multiplexing (LFDM) which transmits information on adjacent subcarriers.<br>
[0023]	FIG.  1 shows a wireless multiple-access communication system 100 with<br>
multiple base stations 110. A base station is generally a fixed station that communicates with the terminals and may also be referred to as a Node B, an enhanced Node B (eNode B), an access point, etc. Each base station 110 provides communication coverage for a particular geographic area. The term "cell" can refer to a base station and/or its coverage area depending on the context in which the term is used. To improve system capacity, a base station coverage area may be partitioned into multiple smaller areas, e.g., three smaller areas. Each smaller area may be served by a respective base transceiver station (BTS). The term "sector" can refer to a BTS and/or its coverage area depending on the context in which the term is used. For a sectorized cell, the BTSs for all sectors of that cell are typically co-located within the base station for the cell.<br>
[0024]	Terminals 120 may be dispersed throughout the system.   A terminal may be<br>
stationary or mobile and may also be referred to as a user equipment, a mobile station, a mobile equipment, an access terminal, a station, etc.   A terminal may be a cellular<br><br>
phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a wireless modem, a wireless communication device, a handheld device, a subscriber unit, a laptop computer, a cordless phone, etc.<br>
[0025]	A system  controller  130  may couple  to  base  stations   110  and provide<br>
coordination and control for these base stations. System controller 130 may be a single network entity or a collection of network entities.<br>
[0026]	FIG. 2 shows a block diagram of a design of a base station 110 and a terminal<br>
120 in system 100. Base station 110 is equipped with multiple (U) antennas 220a through 220u, which may be used for data transmission on the downlink and data reception on the uplink. Terminal 120 is equipped with multiple (V) antennas 152a through 152v, which may be used for data transmission on the uplink and data reception on the downlink. Each antenna may be a physical antenna or an antenna array.<br>
[0027]	On the downlink, at base station 110, a transmit (TX) data and pilot processor<br>
214 receives data from a data source 212, processes (e.g., formats, encodes, interleaves, and symbol maps) the data, and generates data symbols. Processor 214 also generates pilot symbols as described below and provides the pilot and data symbols to a TX spatial processor 216. As used herein, a data symbol is a symbol for data, a pilot symbol is a symbol for pilot, a zero symbol is a signal value of zero, and a symbol is typically a complex value. The data symbols may be modulation symbols from a modulation scheme such as PSK or QAM. Pilot is data that is known a priori by both the transmitter and receiver stations. Processor 216 multiplexes the pilot and data symbols, performs transmitter spatial mapping (if applicable), and provides U output symbol streams to U modulators (MOD) 218a through 218u. Each modulator 218 performs modulation (e.g., for OFDM, SC-FDM, etc.) on its output symbol stream to generate output chips and further processes (e.g., converts from digital to analog, analog filters, amplifies, and upconverts) the output chips to generate a downlink signal. U downlink signals from modulators 218a through 218u are transmitted via U antennas 220a through 220u, respectively.<br>
[0028]	At terminal 120, V antennas 252a through 252v receive the U downlink signals,<br>
and each antenna 252 provides a received signal to a respective demodulator (DEMOD) 254. Each demodulator 254 processes (e.g., filters, amplifies, downconverts, and digitizes) its received signal to obtain samples and further performs demodulation (e.g., for OFDM, SC-FDM, etc.) on the samples to obtain received symbols. Each demodulator 254 provides received data symbols to a MIMO detector 256 and provides<br><br>
recerved pnot symbois to a channel processor 284. Channel processor 284 estimates the downlink MIMO channel response based on the received pilot symbols and provides charmel estimates to MIMO detector 256. MIMO detector 256 performs MIMO detection on the received data symbols with the channel estimates and provides data symbol estimates. An RX data processor 258 further processes (e.g., deinterleaves and decodes) the data symbol estimates and provides decoded data to a data sink 260.<br>
[0029]	On the uplink, at terminal 120, data from a data source 272 and pilot are<br>
processed by a TX data and pilot processor 274, further processed by a TX spatial processor 276, and modulated and processed by modulators 254a through 254v to generate V uplink signals, which are transmitted via V antennas 252a through 252v. At base station 110, the uplink signals are received by U antermas 220a through 220u, processed and demodulated by demodulators 218a through 218u, detected by a MIMO detector 232, and further processed by an RX data processor 234 to recover the data sent by terminal 120. A channel processor 244 estimates the uplink MIMO channel response based on the received pilot symbols and provides channel estimates to MIMO detector 232 for MIMO detection.<br>
[0030]	Controllers/processors 240 and 280 control the operation at base station 110 and<br>
terminal 120, respectively. Memories 242 and 282 store data and program codes for base station 110 and terminal 120, respectively.<br>
[0031]	The techniques described herein may be used with various subcarrier structures.<br>
The following description assumes that K total subcarriers are available for transmission and are assigned indices of 0 through K-1.<br>
[0032]	FIG. 3A shows an IFDM pilot subcarrier structure 300 that may be used for<br>
IFDM or distributed OFDM data transmission. In subcarrier structure 300, the K total subcarriers are arranged into T disjoint or non-overlapping sets such that each set contains L' subcarriers that are uniformly distributed across the K total subcarriers, where T and L' are suitably selected integer values. Consecutive subcarriers in each set are spaced apart by T subcarriers, where K = T • L'. Hence, set / contains subcarriers /, T + /, 2T + /, ..., (L'-l)-T + i,for ze{0,...,T-l}.<br>
[0033]	FIG. 3B shows an IFDM pilot subcarrier structure 310 that may be used for<br>
LFDM or localized OFDM data transmission. In subcarrier structure 310, the K total subcarriers are arranged into G disjoint groups such that each group contains N" = K/G  consecutive subcarriers, where  N" and G are suitably selected integer<br><br>
values. Thus, group 0 includes subcarrier 0 through N"-l, group 1 includes subcarriers N" through 2N'-1, and so on, and group G-1 includes subcarriers K-N" through K-1.<br>
[0034]	The N" subcarriers in each group may be arranged into T disjoint sets such that<br>
each set contains L" subcarriers that are uniformly distributed across the N" subcarriers in that group, where N" = L' • T. The N" subcarriers in each group may thus be arranged in similar manner as described above in FIG. 3A. FIG. 3B shows the T sets of subcarriers for subcarrier group 1.<br>
[0035]	In general, any subcarrier structure may be used for pilot and data transmission<br>
on the downlink and uplink. For example, subcarrier structure 300 may be used for the downlink, and subcarrier structure 310 may be used for the uplink. Other subcarrier structures may also be used. On each link, pilot and data may be sent using the same or different subcarrier structures.<br>
[0036]	A transmitter station may transmit pilot via multiple (T) transmit antermas using<br>
various multiplexing schemes such as time division multiplexing (TDM), time-domain code division multiplexing (TD-CDM), OFDM, IFDM, FD-CDM, etc. A receiver station may receive the pilot via multiple (R) receive antennas and may estimate the MIMO channel response as well as background noise and interference based on the received pilot. For the downlink, the transmitter station may be base station 110, the receiver station may be terminal 120, T may be equal to U, and R may be equal to V. For the uplink, the transmitter station may be terminal 120, the receiver station may be base station 110, T may be equal to V, and R may be equal to U. Pilot for a MIMO transmission may comprise a different pilot sequence for each of the T transmit antennas. A pilot sequence is a sequence of known symbols that may be sent in the time domain or frequency domain depending on the multiplexing scheme used for the pilot.<br>
[0037]	For TDM pilot, a time interval designated for pilot may be partitioned into T<br>
time segments that may be assigned to the T transmit antennas. The transmitter station may send a pilot transmission from each antenna in the time segment assigned to that antenna. The pilot transmission from each anterma may be any pilot sequence and may be appended with a cyclic prefix to combat frequency selective fading caused by delay spread in a multipath channel. A cyclic prefix is also referred to as a guard interval, a preamble, etc. The cyclic prefix length may be selected based on the expected delay spread.   A unique word may also be used in place of the cyclic prefix.   The receiver<br><br>
station may estimate the MIMO channel response and noise using time-domain RAKE processing (which is commonly used in CDMA systems) or frequency-domain processing. Noise estimation may be trivial since pilot is sent from only one transmit antenna in any given time segment and there is no interference from other transmit antennas. Inter-transmitter pilot interference from other transmitter stations may be suppressed by using different pilot scrambling sequences for different fransmitter stations.<br>
[0038]	For TD-CDM pilot, T different orthogonal sequences may be assigned to the T<br>
transmit antermas and used to achieve orthogonality in the time domain. The transmitter station may generate a time-domain pilot sequence for each transmit anterma by multiplying a time-domain base sequence with the orthogonal sequence for that antenna. The transmitter station may then generate a pilot transmission for each transmit anterma based on its time-domain pilot sequence. The pilot transmission from each transmit antenna may not observe multipath interference due to data streams but may observe multipath interference due to pilot transmissions from other transmit antermas. The receiver station may estimate the MIMO channel response using time-domain RAKE processing, which can exploit the orthogonality among the T pilot transmissions due to use of the orthogonal sequences assigned to the T transmit antennas. The receiver station may estimate noise without interference from the observed data streams. Inter-transmitter pilot interference may be suppressed by using different pilot scrambling sequences for different transmitter stations.<br>
[0039]	For OFDM and IFDM pilots, N subcarriers may be used for pilot transmission<br>
and may be arranged into T disjoint sets, e.g., as shown in FIG. 3A or 3B, with each set including L subcarriers, where N = T • L 
[0040]	For OFDM pilot, the transmitter station may send a pilot transmission from each<br>
transmit antenna in the frequency domain on a set of L subcarriers assigned to that anterma. For each transmit antenna, the transmitter station may map L pilot symbols to L subcarriers in the assigned set, map zero symbols to the remaining K - L subcarriers,<br><br>
and generate an OFDM symbol based on the mapped pilot and zero symbols. The T pilot transmissions from the T transmit antennas occupy different subcarriers and are thus orthogonal in frequency. The receiver station may perform channel and noise estimation based on received pilot symbols using frequency-domain processing. The channel and noise estimation does not suffer from inter-antenna interference since orthogonality is achieved among the T pilot transmissions. Hownever, a drawback with OFDM is high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), which means that the ratio of the peak power to the average power of an OFDM waveform can be high in the time domain. The pilot symbols used for each transmit antenna may be generated or selected such that the PAPR is as low as possible. Inter-transmitter interference may be mitigated by proper pilot planning, frequency hopping, etc.<br>
[0041]	For IFDM pilot, the transmitter station may send a pilot transmission from each<br>
transmit antenna in the time domain on a set of L subcarriers assigned to that anteima. For each transmit antenna, the transmitter station may transform L pilot symbols from the time domain to the frequency domain, map the L transformed symbols to L subcarriers in the assigned set, map zero symbols to the remaining K - L subcarriers, and generate an IFDM symbol based on the mapped transformed and zero symbols. The T pilot transmissions from the T transmit antennas occupy different subcarriers and are thus orthogonal in frequency. The receiver station may perform channel and noise estimation based on received pilot symbols using frequency-domain processing. The channel and noise estimation does not suffer from inter-antenna interference since orthogonality is achieved among the T pilot transmissions. Furthermore, high PAPR may be avoided by using pilot symbols with constant amplitude in the time domain. Good charmel estimation performance may be achieved by properly generating the pilot symbols as described below. Inter-sector interference may be mitigated by proper pilot planning, frequency hopping, etc.<br>
[0042]	For FD-CDM pilot, T different orthogonal sequences may be assigned to the T<br>
transmit antennas and used to achieve orthogonality in the frequency domain. The transmitter station may generate a frequency-domain pilot sequence for each transmit antenna by multiplying a frequency-domain base sequence with the orthogonal sequence for that antenna. The transmitter station may then generate a pilot transmission for each transmit antenna based on its frequency-domain pilot sequence. The T pilot transmissions from the T transmit antennas may be nearly orthogonal in a<br><br>
multipath channel due to use of different orthogonal sequences.   The receiver station<br>
may perform channel and noise estimation based on received pilot symbols using<br>
frequency-domain processing, e.g., in similar manner as for the OFDM and IFDM<br>
pilots.<br>
[0043]	Several multiplexing schemes for pilot are described in further detail below.<br>
1.  IFDM pilot<br>
[0044]	An IFDM pilot may be sent from the T transmit antennas on T disjoint sets of<br>
subcarriers, e.g., as shown in FIG. 3A or 3B, one set of L subcarriers for each transmit antenna. The IFDM pilot may be generated with a base sequence having good properties. For example, the base sequence may be selected to have good temporal characteristics (e.g., a constant time-domain envelope) and good spectral characteristics (e.g., a flat frequency spectrum). These good temporal and spectral characteristics may be obtained with various CAZAC (constant amplitude zero auto-correlation) sequences. Some example CAZAC sequences include a Chu sequence, a Frank sequence, a generalized chirp-like (GCL) sequence, a Golomb sequence, PI, P3, P4 and Px sequences, etc.<br>
[0045]	In one design, a Chu sequence cn(n) of length L is used as the base sequence<br>
for the IFDM pilot. This Chu sequence may be expressed as:<br><br>
where /I is a frequency increment index that is selected such that A, and L are relatively prime and have a greatest common denominator of 1. L is the base sequence length and may correspond to the number of subcarriers assigned to each transmit antenna for pilot transmission. L may be a prime number (e.g., L = 257), which may provide good cross-correlation properties for Chu sequences generated with L -1 different values of A. L may also be selected based on the number of subcarriers used for pilot fransmission by each transmit antenna (e.g., L = 256).<br><br>
f0046]	In equations (1) and (2), X may be used as a transmitter-specific value or code to<br>
distinguish the pilots from different transmitter stations, as described below. A set of values may be determined for X based on the sequence length L. For example, the set may include X values of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 for sequence length of L = 7. Different X values may be assigned to different transmitter stations, e.g., different base stations on the downlink or different terminals on the uplink. Since two base sequences generated with different X values have minimal cross-correlation if the difference between the two X values are relatively prime to L, pilots sent by different transmitter stations with different X values minimally interfere with one another in such a case.<br>
[0047]	The Chu sequence has a constant time-domain envelope, which results in low<br>
PAPR for the pilot. The Chu sequence also has a flat frequency spectrum, which may improve channel estimation performance especially when the distribution of the chaimel spectral density is not known.<br>
[0048]	In another design, an L-point inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT) is<br>
performed on the Chu sequence cn{n) to obtain a transformed sequence QCA:) with L symbols. The transformed sequence is then used as the base sequence.<br>
[0049]	In yet another design, a pseudo-random number (PN) sequence pniri) having<br>
good auto-correlation and cross-correlation properties and low PAPR properties in the time domain is used as the base sequence. The PN sequence may be derived in any manner known in the art, e.g., based on a polynomial generator or with an exhaustive search of all possible sequences of length L. Other sequences may also be used as the base sequence.<br>
[0050]	The IFDM pilot for the T transmit antennas may be generated in various<br>
manners. In one scheme, the base sequence is replicated T times and concatenated to obtain an extended base sequence, as follows:<br>
  Eq(3)<br>
where  hn [n-i- L) is a base sequence that is delayed by / • L samples, and<br>
ign, («) is an extended base sequence of length N.<br>
[0051]	The base sequence \{n) of length L may be equal to (a) the Chu sequence so<br>
that \{n) = cn{ri), (b) the PN sequence so that bn(n) = pn(n), or (c) some other<br><br>
sequence. In equation (3), the T copies of the base sequence bn(n) are delayed and arranged such that the start of the z-th sequence follows immediately after the end of the (z-l)-th sequence. The T delayed sequences are summed to obtain the extended base sequence bn,(n) of length N.<br>
[0052]	A pilot sequence may be generated for each transmit antenna as follows:<br><br>
where /&gt;,. (n) is the pilot sequence for transmit antenna i.  Equation (4) applies a linear<br>
phase ramp to the N samples in the extended base sequence. The slope of the phase ramp is different for different transmit antennas.<br>
[0053]	The base sequence Z)L(N)  contains L time-domain samples and occupies L<br>
consecutive subcarriers. The replication of the base sequence T times results in the extended base sequence bnn,(n) occupying every T-th subcarriers in the frequency domain, with zeros for the T-1 subcarriers between consecutive occupied subcarriers. The multiplication with enn in in equation (4) effectively shifts the pilot sequence for transmit anterma / by / subcarriers in the frequency domain. The T pilot sequences for the T antennas are shifted by different numbers of subcarriers and are thus orthogonal in the frequency domain, with each pilot sequence occupying a different set of L subcarriers, e.g., as shown in FIG. 3A or 3B.<br>
[0054]	FIG. 4 shows a process 400 for generating the IFDM pilot. A plurality of pilot<br>
sequences are generated for a plurality of transmit anteimas, with each pilot sequence comprising a plurality of pilot symbols sent in the time domain on a different set of subcarriers (block 410). The plurality of pilot sequences may be generated based on a Chu sequence with A=l, a Chu sequence defined by a transmitter-specific X value, some other CAZAC sequence, a PN sequence, etc. A plurality of pilot transmissions are generated based on the plurality of pilot sequences (block 420).<br>
[0055]	FIG. 5 shows a process 500 for generating the IFDM pilot.    Process 500<br>
includes blocks 510 and 520 that correspond to blocks 410 and 420, respectively, in FIG. 4. A base sequence of length L (e.g., a Chu sequence, an IDFT of the Chu sequence, a PN sequence, etc.) is initially generated (block 512). An extended base sequence of length N is then generated by replicating and concatenating multiple (T)<br><br>
copies of the base sequence (block 514). A pilot sequence is generated for each transmit antenna by applying a different phase ramp to the extended base sequence, e.g., as shown in equation (4) (block 516). A pilot transmission of length N + C may be generated for each transmit antenna by appending a cyclic prefix of length C to the pilot sequence for that antenna (block 520). The cyclic prefix insertion is achieved by copying the last C samples of the pilot sequence and appending these C samples to the start of the pilot sequence. The pilot transmission may also be generated in other manners based on the pilot sequence, e.g., the pilot sequence may be provided directly as the pilot transmission vnthout any cyclic prefix.<br>
[0056]	In another scheme for generating the IFDM pilot for the T transmit antennas,<br>
which may be used for any subcarrier structure including the ones shown in FIGS. 3A and 3B, a time-domain base sequence with L pilot symbols (e.g., a Chu sequence) is initially generated. An L-point discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is then performed on the time-domain base sequence to obtain a frequency-domain base sequence with L transformed symbols. For each transmit antenna, the L transformed symbols are mapped to the L subcarriers assigned to that antenna, and N-L zero symbols are mapped to the remaining subcarriers. An N-point IDFT is then performed on the N transformed symbols and zero symbols to obtain a time-domain pilot sequence with N samples. A cyclic prefix may be appended to this pilot sequence to obtain the pilot transmission for the transmit antenna. The IFDM pilot for the T transmit antennas may also be generated in other manners.<br>
[0057]	In general, a pilot sequence or a pilot transmission may be generated by<br>
determining the symbols or samples for the pilot sequence/transmission based on appropriate equations, e.g., as described above. A pilot sequence or a pilot transmission may also be pre-computed and stored in memory. In this case, the pilot sequence or pilot transmission may be generated, whenever needed, by simply reading from the memory. Thus, the term "generate" may include any action (e.g., computation, memory retrieval, etc.) to obtain the pilot sequence or pilot transmission.<br>
[0058]	For the IFDM pilot, the T pilot transmissions from the T transmit antennas are<br>
disjoint in frequency and are thus orthogonal in a multipath chaimel. The PAPR is low if a pilot sequence with constant envelope in the time domain is used. Furthermore, the pilot energy is uniformly distributed in frequency if a CAZAC sequence such as a Chu<br><br>
sequence is used, which may simplify channel and noise estimation while providing good perfonnance.<br>
2. FD-CDM pilot<br>
[0059]	An FD-CDM pilot may be sent from the T transmit antennas on the same set of<br>
N subcarriers. However, the pilot transmission from each antenna is multiplied in the frequency domain with a different orthogonal sequence. The FD-CDM pilot may be generated with a base sequence having good characteristics.<br>
[0060]	In one design, a Chu sequence cn (n) of length N is used as a time-domain base<br>
sequence for the FD-CDM pilot. This Chu sequence, for even N, may be expressed as:<br><br>
[0061]	An N-point IDFT may be performed on the Chu sequence cn (n) to obtain a<br>
transformed Chu sequence Cn(k) with N symbols. The transformed Chu sequence may be used as a frequency-domain base sequence Bn (k). In another design, the Chu sequence cn (n) is used directly as the frequency-domain base sequence. In yet another design, a PN sequence PN(k) of length N is used as the frequency-domain base sequence. Other sequences may also be used as the base sequence. In general, the frequency-domain base sequence Bn(k)  of length N may be equal to (a) the Chu<br>
sequence so that Bn(k) = cn(n) where n = k ,(h) the transformed Chu sequence so that<br>
Bn(k) = Cn(k), (c) the PN sequence so that  Bn(k) = PNik), or (d) some other<br>
sequence.<br>
[0062]	The FD-CDM pilot for the T transmit antennas may be generated in various<br>
manners. In one scheme, a frequency-domain pilot sequence may be generated for each transmit antenna as follows:<br><br>
where  Wj(k) is an orthogonal sequence for transmit antenna/, and<br>
Pi (k) is a frequency-domain pilot sequence for transmit antenna /.<br><br>
[0063]	In general, various orthogonal sequences may be used for W,(k) in equation (6).<br>
For example, the orthogonal sequences may be Walsh sequences from a Hadamard matrix, sequences from a Fourier matrix, etc. The orthogonal sequences may also have any length that is equal to or longer than T and is an integer divisor of N. In one design, the orthogonal sequences are defined as follows:<br><br>
[0064]	T   orthogonal   sequences   may   be   generated   based   on   equation   (7)   for<br>
z = 0,...,T-1. These orthogonal sequences have length of N but are periodic over T and thus repeat every T symbols. The use of these orthogonal sequences does not increase the time-domain PAPR nor the frequency-domain PAPR, which is desirable.<br>
[0065]	The frequency-domain pilot sequence for each transmit antenna may then be<br>
generated as follows:<br><br>
[0066]	Equation (8) essentially modulates the frequency-domain base sequence with the<br>
orthogonal sequence, which is at a different frequency for each transmit antenna. It can be shown that modulating the frequency-domain base sequence by e-'n'"''n is equivalent to cyclically shifting the corresponding time-domain base sequence by L • / samples. The time-domain pilot sequence for each transmit antenna may then be generated as follows:<br><br>
where  bn (n) is a time-domain base sequence of length N, and<br>
Pi (n) is a time-domain pilot sequence for transmit antenna i.<br>
[0067]	The time-domain base sequence bn(n) may be equal to (a) the Chu sequence so<br>
that bn{b) = cn{n), (b) the PN sequence so that bn(n) = pn(n), or (c) some other<br>
sequence. The cyclic shifting in equation (9) is achieved by taking the last L • / samples of the time-domain base sequence and appending these L • / samples to the start of the base sequence.    Different numbers of samples are cyclically shifted for different<br><br>
transmit antennas. In particular, 0 samples are cyclically shifted for transmit antenna 0,<br>
L samples are cyclically shifted for transmit antenna 1, and so on, and (T-l)-L<br>
samples are cyclically shifted for transmit antenna T -1.<br>
[0068]	FIG. 6 shows example pilot sequences and pilot transmissions for  T = 4<br>
transmit antennas for the FD-CDM pilot. The pilot sequence for transmit antenna 0 is equal to the base sequence b.n{n). The pilot sequence for transmit antenna 1 is equal to<br>
the base sequence cyclically shifted by L samples. The pilot sequence for transmit antenna 2 is equal to the base sequence cyclically shifted by 2L samples. The pilot sequence for transmit antenna 3 is equal to the base sequence cyclically shifted by 3L samples. The pilot transmission for each transmit anterma is generated by appending a cyclic prefix to the pilot sequence for that transmit antenna.<br>
[0069]	FIG. 7 shows a process 700 for generating the FD-CDM pilot.   A plurality of<br>
pilot sequences are generated for a plurality of transmit antennas based on FD-CDM of a base sequence, e.g., a CAZAC sequence such as a Chu sequence defined by a transmitter-specific 2 value (block 710). A plurality of pilot transmissions are generated based on the plurality of pilot sequences (block 720). The pilot transmissions may be sent on the downlink, and neighboring base stations may be assigned different transmitter-specific values. The pilot transmissions may also be sent on the uplink, and different terminals may be assigned different transmitter-specific values.<br>
[0070]	FIG. 8 shows a process 800 for generating the FD-CDM pilot.   Process 800<br>
includes blocks 810 and 820 that correspond to blocks 710 and 720, respectively, in FIG. 7. A time-domain base sequence of length N (e.g., a Chu sequence defined by a transmitter-specific value, a PN sequence, etc.) is initially generated (block 812). A time-domain pilot sequence for each transmit antenna i is then generated by cyclically shifting the time-domain base sequence by L-i samples (block 814). The cyclic shifting in the time domain achieves the frequency-domain multiplication with the orthogonal sequence shown in equation (7). A pilot transmission of length N + C may be generated for each transmit anteima by appending a cyclic prefix of length C to the time-domain pilot sequence for that antenna (block 820).<br>
[0071]	In another scheme for generating the FD-CDM pilot for the T transmit antennas,<br>
which may be used with any orthogonal sequences and for any subcarrier structure, a time-domain base sequence of length N (e.g., a Chu sequence defined by a transmitter-specific value) is initially generated and transformed with an N-point DFT to obtain a<br><br>
frequency-domain base sequence. For each transmit antenna, the frequency-domain base sequence is multiplied with an orthogonal sequence assigned to that antenna to obtain an intermediate sequence. An N-point IDFT is then performed on the intermediate sequence to obtain a time-domain pilot sequence of length N. A cyclic prefix may be appended to the time-domain pilot sequence to obtain the pilot transmission for the transmit antenna. The FD-CDM pilot for the T transmit antennas may also be generated in other manners.<br>
[0072]	For both the IFDM and FD-CDM pilots with the Chu sequences, different values<br>
of A may be assigned to different transmitter stations to reduce pilot interference and assist the receiver stations acquire pilots from the different transmitter stations. On the downlink, different A values may be assigned to neighboring base stations or BTSs, one X value for each base station or BTS. Each base station or BTS may generate U pilot transmissions for its U antennas with the assigned A value, e.g., as described above. A terminal may receive pilot transmissions from multiple base stations and may be able to detect and distinguish the pilot transmissions from each base station based on the X value assigned to that base station or BTS. On the uplink, different A values may be assigned to different terminals that may simultaneously sent pilot transmissions to the same base station or BTS, one A value for each terminal. Each terminal may generate V pilot transmissions for its V antennas with the assigned A value, e.g., as described above. The base station may receive pilot transmissions from multiple terminals and may be able to detect and distinguish the pilot transmissions from each terminal based on the A value assigned to that terminal.<br>
[0073]	It is desirable for the pilot sequences from different transmitter stations (e.g.,<br>
different base stations on the downlink or different terminals on the uplink) to have as low cross-correlation as possible. Pilot sequences of length L for the IFDM pilot or length N for the FD-CDM pilot may be generated with different A values. The cross-correlation between these pilot sequences may be determined for different time shifts. A set of A values with small cross-correlation between their pilot sequences may be selected for use.<br>
[0074]	Different A values may also be used to support spatial division multiplexing<br>
(SDM) on the uplink. For example, multiple terminals transmitting simultaneously to a given base station may be assigned different A values.  Each terminal may generate its<br><br>
pilot transmissions based on its assigned X value. Alternatively, the multiple terminals transmitting simultaneously to the base station may be assigned the same X value but different orthogonal sequences or cyclic shifts. Each terminal may generate its pilot transmissions based on the common 1 value and its assigned orthogonal sequences or cyclic shifts.<br>
3. Pilot and Data Multiplexing Schemes<br>
[0075]	In general, the transmitter station may achieve orthogonality between pilot and<br>
data using TDM, FDM, etc. For TDM, the transmitter station may send pilot in some time intervals and send data in other time intervals. For FDM, the transmitter station may send pilot on some subcarriers and send data on other subcarriers. The transmitter station may achieve orthogonality between the pilot transmissions from the T transmit antennas using any of the multiplexing schemes described above. The transmitter station may send pilot from T transmit antennas using a first multiplexing scheme and may send data from the T antennas using a second multiplexing scheme. In general, the first multiplexing scheme may be the same as or different from the second multiplexing scheme.<br>
[0076]	FIG.  9  shows  a process  900 for sending pilot and data with different<br>
multiplexing schemes. A plurality of pilot transmissions for a plurality of transmit antennas are generated based on a first multiplexing scheme (block 912). A plurality of data transmissions for the plurality of transmit antennas are generated based on a second multiplexing scheme that is different from the first multiplexing scheme (block 914). The plurality of pilot transmissions may be sent in a first time interval, and the plurality of data transmissions may be sent in a second time interval with TDM (block 916). The plurality of pilot transmissions may also be sent on a first set of subcarriers, and the plurality of data transmissions may be sent on a second set of subcarriers with FDM.<br>
[0077]	The first multiplexing scheme may be OFDM, and the second multiplexing<br>
scheme may be SC-FDM (e.g., IFDM or LFDM), TD-CDM, SDM, etc. The first multiplexing scheme may be SC-FDM (e.g., IFDM), and the second multiplexing scheme may be OFDM, TD-CDM, SDM, etc. The first multiplexing scheme may be FD-CDM, and the second multiplexing scheme may be OFDM, SC-FDM, TD-CDM, SDM, etc. The first and second multiplexing schemes may also be other combinations of multiplexing schemes.<br><br>
[0078]	The first multiplexing scheme may be selected to reduce pilot overhead while<br>
achieving good channel and noise estimation performance for MIMO transmission. The second multiplexing scheme may be selected to achieve good performance for data transmission among different streams of a single terminal or among different terminals. Different multiplexing schemes for pilot and data may be readily supported using frequency-domain processing for channel estimation and data detection, as described below.<br>
4.  Channel Estimation<br>
[0079]	The receiver station may receive pilot transmissions from the transmitter station<br>
and may perform channel estimation in various maimers based on the received pilot transmissions. Channel estimation may be performed in different manners for different pilot multiplexing schemes. Several example channel estimation techniques are described below.<br>
[0080]	For  the   IFDM  pilot,  the  receiver  station  may  obtain  R  received  pilot<br>
transmissions via the R receive antennas and may remove the cyclic prefix in each received pilot transmission to obtain N time-domain samples. The receiver station may then transform the N time-domain samples for each receive antenna with an N-point DFT to obtain N received symbols for the N subcarriers used for the IFDM pilot. The received symbols from each receive antenna may be expressed as:<br><br>
where  Pn (k) is a transmitted symbol from transmit antenna / on subcarrier k,<br>
H.j{k) is a complex channel gain from transmit antenna / to receive antennay<br>
on subcarrier k, Rj(k) is a received symbol from receive antenna_/ on subcarrier k, and<br>
Nj(k) is noise for receive antenna/ on subcarrier L<br>
P (k) is a frequency-domain pilot sequence that may be obtained by performing an N-<br>
point DFT on the time-domain pilot sequence /?, («) for transmit antenna i.<br><br>
[0081]	As shown in equation (10), the received symbol Rnk) from receive antennan' is<br>
composed of the sum of the T transmitted symbols Pj(k) weighted by the channel gains<br>
Hjj(k) between the T transmit antennas and receive antenna/.  The received symbol<br>
Rj(k) is further degraded by noise Nj(k). For the IFDM pilot, each transmit antenna /<br>
is assigned a different subset of the N subcarriers. Hence, the transmitted symbols Pjik) from transmit antenna i are non-zero for only L subcarriers assigned to antenna /.<br>
[0082]	In one design, the charmel gains are estimated based on least-squares technique,<br>
as follows:<br><br>
where Hij{k-T + i) is a channel gain estimate between transmit antenna i and receive<br>
antenna7 for subcarrier k-T + i, which is an estimate of Hnj(k-T + i).   Since each<br>
transmit antenna is assigned a different set of L subcarriers, equation (11) derives the<br>
channel gain estimates for each transmit antenna / by dividing the received symbols<br>
from the L subcarriers assigned to anterma / by the transmitted symbols from antenna i.<br>
[0083]	In another design, the channel gains are estimated based on minimum mean-<br>
square error (MMSE) technique, as follows:<br><br>
where al(k-T + i) is the variance of the noise Nj(k'T + i) for subcarrier k-T + i. For the Chu sequence, \Pi(k-T + i)\n=l and the denominator in equation (12) may be replaced with l + crlik-T + i).<br>
[0084]	A channel gain estimate may be derived based on equation (11) or (12) or some<br>
other equation for each subcarrier k of each pair of fransmit anterma z and receive antenna j. T ■ R sets of channel gain estimates may be obtained for all T transmit antennas and R receive antennas, one set for each transmit-receive antenna pair, with each set including L channel gain estimates for L subcarriers. Each set of channel gain<br><br>
estimates may be transformed with an L-point IDFT to obtain a corresponding channel impulse response estimate with L taps, as follows:<br>
  Eq(13)<br>
where hjj(£) is a chaimel impulse response estimate between transmit antenna / and<br>
receive antenna7. The channel impulse response estimate may also be obtained from the channel gain estimates using least-squares, MMSE, robust MMSE, or some other technique known in the art.<br>
]	Various types of post-processing such as truncation, thresholding, tap selection,<br>
etc., may be performed on the L channel taps of each chaimel impulse response estimate. For truncation, the first Q channel taps are retained and the remaining L - Q channel taps are zeroed out, where Q may be selected based on the expected delay spread of the wireless channel. For thresholding, channel taps with magnitude below a threshold are zeroed out, where the threshold may be a fixed value or a particular percentage of the total energy of all L channel taps. For tap selection, B best channel taps are retained and all other channel taps are zeroed out, where B may be a fixed value or a configurable value determined based on SNR, etc.<br>
I]	After completing the post-processing, the L-tap channel impulse response<br>
estimate for each transmit-receive antenna pair may be padded with N - L zeros. An N-point DFT may then be performed on the zero-padded channel impulse response estimate to obtain N channel gain estimates for the N subcarriers of the transmit-receive anteima pair. The channel gain estimates may be used for MIMO detection of received data symbols and/or other purposes<br>
7]	For the FD-CDM pilot, the received symbols from each receive antenna may be<br>
expressed as:<br><br>
where Rj{k) is a received symbol from receive antennay on subcarrier k.<br>
[0088]	In one design, the channel gains are estimated based on the least-squares<br>
technique, as follows:<br><br><br>
[0089]	Hnnj-j(k) is the interference observed by the channel gain estimates Hnj{k) for<br>
transmit antenna / due to pilot transmissions from the other T-1 transmit antennas. For the orthogonal sequence shown in equation (7), the interference from each transmit antenna m to transmit antenna / may be expressed as:<br>
[0090] <br>
[0091]	Equations (17) and (18) indicate that the interference from transmit antenna m to<br>
transmit antenna i is the channel impulse response hj(i)  for transmit antenna m<br>
shifted by (m - /) • L taps. The amount of shift in h„j{t) is equal to the difference in<br>
the cyclic shifts for transmit antennas m and i. L should thus be greater than the expected delay spread of the wireless chaimel. An N-point IDFT of equation (15) may then be expressed as:<br><br>
[0092]	Equations (19) and (20) indicate that the channel impulse response estimate<br>
hj{l) between transmit antenna i and receive antenna/ includes the desired channel<br><br>
impulse response h1(l) plus T-1 time shifted channel impulse responses for the other<br>
T -1 transmit antennas. The removal of the other pilot sequences in equation (6) may thus be performed in the time domain by retaining the first L channel taps, which contain h1(l) for transmit antenna /, and discarding the remaining N - L chaimel taps,<br>
which contain h1(l) for the other T -1 transmit antennas.<br>
993]	For the least-squares technique with a Chu sequence having a flat frequency<br>
spectrum, an N-point IDFT may be performed on the N received symbols Rj(,k) for N<br>
subcarriers, after removing the phase of the transformed Chu sequence, to obtain N channel taps.   For other base sequences without a flat frequency spectrum (e.g., a PN<br>
sequence), the received symbols Rj (k) may be divided by the frequency-domain base<br>
sequence Bn(k) and then transformed with an N-point IDFT to obtain N channel taps.<br>
For the orthogonal sequence shown in equation (7), the first L charmel taps may be<br>
provided as the channel impulse response estimate hfjj(i) for transmit antenna 0, the<br>
next L channel taps may be provided as the channel impulse response estimate hnj{l) for transmit antenna 1, and so on, and the last L channel taps may be provided as the<br>
A<br>
channel impulse response estimate ht(£) for transmit anteima T -1.<br>
[0094]	In another design, the channel gains are estimated based on the MMSE<br>
technique, as follows:<br><br>
[0095]	An N-point IDFT may be performed on the N channel gain estimates from<br>
equation (21) to obtain N channel taps for T channel impulse response estimates for the T transmit antermas, as described above.<br>
[0096]	In general, N received symbols Rjik) from N subcarriers for each receive<br>
antenna7 may be processed with the frequency-domain base sequence Bn(k) based on the least-squares technique, the MMSE technique, or some other technique to obtain N initial channel gain estimates Hnj{k). The N initial channel gain estimates may be multiplied in the frequency domain with the orthogonal sequence  Wn{k)   for each<br><br>
transmit antenna to obtain L channel gain estimates for that transmit antenna. The L channel gain estimates for each transmit antenna may be transformed with an L-point<br>
A<br>
IDFT to obtain an L-tap channel impulse response estimate hij(£) for that transmit<br>
anternna. Alternatively, the removal of the other pilot sequences may be performed in the time domain, as described above. In any case, post-processing (e.g., truncation, thresholding, tap selection, zero padding, etc.) may be performed on the L-tap channel impulse response estimate for each transmit antenna to obtain an N-tap zero-padded channel impulse response estimate, which may then be transformed with an N-point DFT to obtain N final channel gain estimates for the N subcarriers of that transmit antenna. The processing may be performed in different maimers depending on the frequency-domain base sequence Bn (k) and the orthogonal sequences W1 (k) used for<br>
the FD-CDM pilot. Channel estimation may also be performed in other manners.<br>
[0097]	The background noise and interference for each subcarrier may be estimated<br>
based on the received symbols and the chaimel gain estimates. For the IFDM pilot, the noise and interference for each subcarrier k may be estimated as follows:<br><br>
where crnn (A:) the estimated variance of the noise and interference for receive antenna_/" on subcarrier k. The noise and interference may be estimated in similar manner for the FD-CDM pilot, albeit with Rj{k) replaced with Rj{k) and Pnk) replaced with Pn{k).<br>
The noise and interference estimate  aj (k) may be averaged across R receive antennas<br>
to obtain a noise and interference estimate crj, (k) for each subcarrier k, which may be used for MIMO detection and/or other purposes. The noise and interference estimate a2 (k) may also be averaged over all subcarriers and across time to obtain a long-term<br>
noise and interference estimate, which may be used to estimate operating conditions and/or for other purposes.<br>
5. MIMO Detection<br>
[0098]	The receiver station may recover data symbols sent by the transmitter station<br>
based on various MIMO detection techniques such as an MMSE technique, a zero-<br><br>
forcing (ZF) technique, a maximal ratio combining (MRC) technique, a space-frequency equalization technique, etc. The received data symbols from the R receive antennas for each subcarrier k may be expressed as:<br><br>
where  r(k) is an R x 1 vector of received symbols from the R receive antennas,<br>
x(k) = [XQ(k) ... Xj_n(k)y is a Txl vector of transmitted symbols sent from<br>
the T transmit anteimas, where " T" denotes a transpose, hi(k) = [HiQ(k) ...H,.(A:)] is an Rxl vector of channel gains for transmit<br>
antenna i, H(/t) = [ho(K) ... hx_i(k)] is an RxT MIMO channel response matrix, and n(k) is an Rxl vector of noise.<br>
[0099]	The transmitted symbols X,(A;) may be data symbols sent in the frequency<br>
domain with OFDM or the DFT of data symbols sent in the time domain with SC-FDM.<br>
The channel gains in h,(k) and H(k) may be estimated based on the received pilot<br>
transmissions, as described above.<br>
[00100]	Equalizer coefficients may be derived based on the MMSE, ZF, and MRC<br>
techniques, as follows:<br><br><br>
T,(K) is an R x R noise and interference covariance matrix for anternna i, and ..H.. denotes a conjugate transpose<br>
[00101]	The noise and interference covariance matrix may be expressed as:<br>
  Eq (27)<br>
where R(k) = E{n(k)-n,"(k)} is an RxR noise covariance matrix, and £{ } is an<br>
expectation operation.<br>
[00102]	The noise covariance matrix may be approximated as  R(k) = al(k)-I  for<br>
spatially and spectrally uncorrelated noise, where I is an identity matrix.   R(k) may<br>
also be estimated based on equation (22).<br>
[00103]	MIMO detection for each transmit antenna i may be performed as follows:<br>
  Eq (28)<br>
where  Yj (k) is a biased estimate of Xn (k) sent from transmit antenna i,<br>
Bi (k) = w, (k) • hj (k) is a scaling factor for X, (k), and Vi (k) is post-detection noise and interference for Jf, (k).<br>
[00104]	The detected symbols for each transmit anterma / may then be expressed as:<br>
  Eq (29)<br>
