Useful amide compounds of the formula I are mentioned in EP-A-545 099 and 589 301 which are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference.<br>
The preparation of the amide compounds of the formula I is known, for example, from EP-A-545 099 or 589 301 or can be carried out by similar processes.<br><br>
Also known are the carboxamides II [Ha: common name: dimethomorph, EP-A 120 321; lib: proposed common name: flumetover, AGROW No. 243, 22 (1995)], their preparation and<br>
their action against harmful fungi. &gt;<br>
The compounds of the formula III are also known per se. A first preferred group of valinamide derivatives are compounds of the formula III'<br>
i <br>
in which R13 is as defined above and X is halogen, Ci-C4-alkyl or Ci-C4-alkoxy. Compounds of this type and their preparation are described, for example, in EP-A-0 610 764 and EP-A-0 398 072, which are expressly incorporated herein by way of reference.<br>
A further preferred group of valinamide derivatives are compounds of the formula III"<br><br>
in which R13 is as defined above. Compounds of this type and their preparation are described, for example, in DE-A-43 21 897 and WO-A-96/07638, which are expressly incorporated herein by way of<br>
reference.<br>
Preference is given to compounds of the formula III in which R13 is isopropyl, sec-butyl and tert-butyl,<br>
Likewise, preference is given to compounds of the formula III in which R14 is a-naphthyl, fl-naphthyl and phenyl, the phenyl radical being substituted in the 4-position by chlorine, bromine, Cj.-C4-alkyl or Ci-C^-alkoxy.<br>
Particular preference is given to compounds of the formula III in which Ru is p-naphthyl, 4-chlorophenyl, 4-methylphenyl und 4-methoxyphenyl.<br><br>
Preferred examples of valinamides which can be used according to the invention are summarized in Table 2 below.<br><br>
Particular preference is given to the compounds III.2 and III.9.<br>
From the structural formula for the compounds of the formula III it is evident that these compounds have two asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms. The compounds can therefore be used for the mixture according to the invention either as mixtures of different isomers or as pure isomers.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, compounds of the formula III are used in which the amino acid moiety is formed by alkoxycarbonyl-L-valine (S configuration) and the phenethylamine moiety or the naphthylethylamine moiety has the R configuration. Such compounds can be represented by the formula Ilia<br><br>
in which R13 and R14 are as defined for the compounds of the<br>
formula II.<br><br>
The preparation of the preferred isomers of the formula Ilia is carried out similarly to the methods described in the earlier German patent application DE-A-195 31 814. The disclosure of this application is expressly incorporated herein by way of reference.<br>
The isomerically pure compounds of the formula Ilia can be prepared in a manner known per se starting from the appropriate, L-valine-based carbamoylcarboxylie acids VI. The compounds Ilia are obtained, for example, by the process described below in which a carbamoylcarboxylie acid VI is reacted with an amine VII (the literature references "Houben-Weyl" refer to: Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie, 4th edition, Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart):<br><br>
The carbamoylcarboxylic acids VI are known or can be prepared by known methods, in particular starting from the amino acid L-valine (cf. "Houben-Weyl", volume 15/1, pp. 46-305, in particular pp. 117-125).<br>
The amines VII are also known or can be easily obtained (cf. Organikum, VEB Deutscher Verlag der Wissenschaften, 15th edition, Berlin, 1977, p. 610 ff.; "Houben-Weyl", volume 15/1, pp. 648-665; Indian J. Chem. 10, pp. 366 (1972); J. Am. Chem. Soc. 58, pp. 1808-1811 (1936)).<br>
From racemates of the amines VII, the R isomer can be isolated in a manner known per se, for example by fractional crystallization using optically active tartaric acid or, preferably, by 2nzyme-catalyzed esterification and subsequent hydrolysis (cf., for example, WO-A-95/08636).<br>
This process is preferably carried out by initially converting :he carbamoylcarboxylic acids VI into carboxyl-ativaited ierivatives, in particular into acyl cyanides or anhydrides, (cf. Tetrahedron Letters, volume 18, pp. 1595-1598 (1973), or 'Houben-Weyl", volume 15/1, pp. 28-32). These derivatives are :hen reacted with the amines VII in the presence of bases.<br><br>
Suitable for preparing the carboxyl-activated acyl cyanides is, for example, the reaction of the carbamoylcarboxylic acids V with diethyl cyanophosphonate, in particular in an inert solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran or toluene.<br>
The preparation of the carboxyl-activiated anhydrides is preferably carried out by reacting the carbamoylcarboxylic acid V with chloroformates, such as isobutyl chloroformate, in the presence of bases and, if appropriate, in an inert solvent, such as toluene or tetrahydrofuran.<br>
The reaction of the amines VII with the carboxyl-activated carbamoylcarboxylic acids VI is preferably carried out in a solvent such as dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran or toluene.<br>
The amines VII may also serve as bases, in which case they are usually recovered from the crude product.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of this process step, the carbamoylcarboxylic acid VI, the amine VII, the reagent which is suitable for generating the carboxyl-activated derivative of the carbamoylcarboxylic acid VI and the base are reacted in a one-pot process, if appropriate in an inert solvent, and the crude product is subsequently worked-up in a manner known per se to isolate the carbamoylcarboxamide Ilia.<br>
The compound IV.1 is commercially available under the common name benalaxyl or the trade name Galben™ .<br>
The compound IV.2 is commercially available under the common name ofurace or the trade name Celtan™ P in the form of mixtures with cymoxanil and folpet.<br>

The compound V (US-A 3,957,847; common name: cymoxanil), its preparation and its action against harmful fungi are also known.<br>
To unfold the synergistic activity, even a small amount of amide compound of the formula I is sufficient. Preference is given to employing amide compound and compounds II and/or the compounds III to V in a weight ratio in the range of from 20:1 to 1:20, in particular 10:1 to 1:10.<br>
When preparing the mixtures, it is preferred to employ the pure active ingredients I and II and/or III to V, to which further active ingredients against harmful fungi or other pests, such as insects, arachnids or nematodes, or else herbicidal or growth-regulating active ingredients or fertilizers can be admixed.<br>
The mixtures of the compounds I and II and/or III to V, or the compounds I and II and/or III to V used simultaneously, jointly or separately, exhibit outstanding activity against a wide range of phytopathogenic fungi, in particular from the classes of the Ascomycetes, Basidiomycetes, Phycomycetes and Deuteromycetes. Some of them act systemically and can therefore also be employed as foliar- and soil-acting fungicides.<br>
They are especially important for controlling a large number of fungi in a variety of crop plants, such as cotton, vegetable species (eg. cucumbers, beans, tomatoes, potatoes and cucurbits), barley, grass, oats, bananas, coffee, maize, fruit species, rice, rye, soya, grapevine, wheat, ornamentals, sugar cane, and a variety of seeds.<br>
Ihey are particularly suitable for controlling the following phytopathogenic fungi: Erysiphe graminis (powdery mildew) in cereals, Erysiphe cichoracearum and Sphaerotheca fuliginea in cucurbits, Podosphaera leucotricha in apples, Uncinula necator in grapevines, Puccinia species in cereals, Rhizoctonia species in cotton, rice and lawns, Ustilago species in cereals and sugar :ane, Venturia inaequalis (scab) in apples, Helminthosporium species in cereals, Septoria nodorum in wheat, Botrytis cinerea (gray mold) in strawberries, vegetables, ornamentals and grapevines, Cercospora arachidicola in groundnuts, ?seudocercosporella herpotrichoides in wheat and barley, Pyricularia oryzae in rice, Phytophthora infestans in potatoes<br><br>
and tomatoes, Plasmopara viticola in grapevines, Pseudoperonospora species in hops and cucumbers, Alternaria species in vegetables and fruit, Mycosphaerella species in bananas and Fusarium and Verticillium species.<br>
The mixtures according to the invention may particularly preferably be employed for controlling powdery mildew fungi in vegetables and grapevines.<br>
The compounds I and II and/or III to V can be applied simultaneously, either together or separately, or in succession, the sequence, in the case of separate application, generally not having any effect on the result of the control measures.<br>
Depending on the kind of effect desired, the application rates of the mixtures according to the invention are, in particular in agricultural crop areas, from 0.01 to 8 kg/ha, preferably from 0.1 to 5 kg/ha, in particular from 0.5 to 3.0 kg/ha.<br>
The application rates of the compounds I are from 0.01 to 2.5 kg/ha, preferably from 0.05 to 2.5 kg/ha, in particular from 0.1 to 1.0 kg/ha.<br>
Correspondingly, in the case of the compounds II and/or III to V, the application rates are from 0.01 to 10 kg/ha, preferably from 0.05 to 5 kg/ha, in particular from 0.05 to 2.0 kg/ha.<br>
For seed treatment, the application rates of the mixture are generally from 0.001 to 250 g/kg of seed, preferably from 0.01 to 100 g/kg, in particular from 0.01 to 50 g/kg.<br>
If phytopathogenic harmful fungi are to be controlled, the separate or joint application of the compounds I and II and/or III to V or of the mixtures of the compounds I and II and/or III to V is effected by spraying or dusting the seeds, the plants or the soils before or after sowing of the plants, or before or after plant emergence.<br>
The fungicidal synergistic mixtures according to the invention, or the compounds I and II and/or III to V, can be formulated for example in the form of ready-to-spray solutions, powders and suspensions or in the form of highly concentrated aqueous, oily or other suspensions, dispersions, emulsions, oil dispersions, pastes, dusts, materials for broadcasting or granules, and applied by spraying, atomizing, dusting, broadcasting or<br><br>
watering. The use form depends on the intended purpose; in any case, it should ensure as fine and uniform as possible a<br>
distribution of the mixture according to the invention.<br>
' The formulations are prepared in a known manner, eg. by extending the active ingredient with solvents and/or carriers, if desired using emulsifiers and dispersants, it being possible also to use other organic solvents as auxiliary solvents if water is used as the diluent. Suitable auxiliaries for this purpose are<br>
1 essentially: solvents such as aromatics (eg. xylene), chlorinated aromatics (eg. chlorobenzenes), paraffins (eg. mineral oil fractions), alcohols (eg. methanol, butanol), ketones (eg. cyclohexanone), amines (eg. ethanolamine, dimethylformamide) and water; carriers such as ground natural minerals (eg. kaolins, clays, talc, chalk) and ground synthetic minerals (eg. finely divided silica, silicates); emulsifiers such as nonionic and anionic emulsifiers (eg. polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, alkylsulfonates and arylsulfonates) and dispersants such as lignosulfite waste liquors and methylcellulose.<br>
Suitable surfactants are the alkali metal salts, alkaline earth metal salts and ammonium salts of aromatic sulfonic acids, eg. ligno-, phenol-, naphthalene- and dibutylnaphthalenesulfonic acid, and of fatty acids, alkyl- and alkylarylsulfonates, alkyl, lauryl ether and fatty alcohol sulfates, and salts of sulfated hexa-, hepta- and octadecanols, or of fatty alcohol glycol ethers, condensates of sulfonated naphthalene and its derivatives with formaldehyde, condensates of naphthalene or of the naphthalenesulfonic acids with phenol and formaldehyde, polyoxyethylene octylphenol ether, ethoxylated isooctyl-, octyl-or nonylphenol, alkylphenol polyglycol ethers, tributylphenyl polyglycol ethers, alkylaryl polyether alcohols, isotridecyl alcohol, fatty alcohol/ethylene oxide condensates, ethoxylated castor oil, polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers or polyoxypropylene alkyl ethers, lauryl alcohol polyglycol ether acetate, sorbitol esters, lignosulfite waste liquors or methylcellulose.<br>
Powders, materials for broadcasting and dusts can be prepared by mixing or jointly grinding the compounds I or II and/or Hi to V, or the mixture of the compounds I and II and/or III to V, with a solid carrier.<br>
Granules (eg. coated granules, impregnated granules or homogeneous granules) are usually prepared by binding the active ingredient, or active ingredients, to a solid carrier.<br><br>
Fillers or solid carriers are, for example, mineral earths, such as silicas, silica gels, silicates, talc, kaolin, limestone, lime, chalk, bole, loess, clay, dolomite, diatomaceous earth, calcium sulfate, magnesium sulfate, magnesium oxide, ground synthetic materials, and fertilizers such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium phosphate, ammonium nitrate, ureas, and products of vegetable origin, such as cereal meal, tree bark meal, wood meal and nut-shell meal, cellulose powders or other solid carriers.<br>
The formulations generally comprise from 0.1 to 95% by weight, preferably from 0.5 to 90% by weight, of one of the compounds I or II or of the mixture of the compounds I and II and/or III to V. The active ingredients are employed in a purity of from 90% to 100%, preferably from 95% to 100% (according to NMR spectrum or HPLC).<br>
The compounds I or II and/or III to V, the mixtures, or the corresponding formulations, are applied by treating the harmful fungi, their habitat, or the plants, seeds, soils, areas, materials or spaces to be kept free from them with a fungicidally effective amount of the mixture, or of the compounds I and II and/or III to V in the case of separate application.<br>
Application can be effected before or after infection by the harmful fungi.<br>

Jse Example<br>
?he synergistic activity of the mixtures according to the .nvention can be demonstrated by the following experiments:<br>
'he active ingredients, separately or together, are formulated as<br>
i 10% emulsion in a mixture of 63% by weight of cyclohexanone and :7% by weight of emulsifier, and diluted with water to the lesired concentration.<br><br>
Evaluation is carried out by determining the infected leaf areas in percent. These percentages are converted into efficacies. The efficacy (H) is calculated as follows using Abbot's formula:<br><br>
a       corresponds to the fungal infection of the treated plants in % and<br>
p  corresponds to the fungal infection of the untreated (control) plants in %<br>
An efficacy of 0 means that the infection level of the treated plants corresponds to that of the untreated control plants; an efficacy of 100 means that the treated plants were not infected.<br>
The expected efficacies of the mixtures of the active ingredients are determined using Colby's formula [R.S. Colby, Weeds 15., 20-22 (1967)] and compared with the observed efficacies.<br><br>
E expected efficacy, expressed in % of the untreated control, when using the mixture of the active ingredients A and B at the concentrations a and b<br>
x  efficacy, expressed in % of the untreated control, when using active ingredient A at a concentration a<br>
y  efficacy, expressed in % of the untreated control, when using active ingredient B at a concentration b<br>
Use Example 1 - Activity against Phytophthora infestans on tomatoes<br>
Leaves of potted plants of the variety "Grofie Fleischtomate" were sprayed to runoff point with an aqueous suspension which had been prepared from a stock solution comprising 10% of active ingredient, 63% of cyclohexanone and 27% of emulsifier. The next day, the leaves were infected with an aqueous zoospore suspension of Phytophthora infestans. The plants were subsequently placed in a chamber saturated with water vapor, at temperatures between 16 and 18°C. After 6 days, the tomato blight on the untreated but infected control plants had developed to such an extent that the infection could be determined visually in %.<br><br>
The compounds of the formula I employed were the following<br>
compounds:<br><br>
The results are shown in Tables 1 and 2 below.<br><br>
The test results show that the observed efficacy in all mixing ratios is higher than the efficacy which had been calculated beforehand using Colby's formula.<br><br><br>
