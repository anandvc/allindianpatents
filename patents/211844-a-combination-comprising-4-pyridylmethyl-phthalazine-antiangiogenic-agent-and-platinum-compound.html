The present invention relates to a combination of 4-pyridylmethyl-phthalazine antiangiogenic agent in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of a proliferative disease, especially a solid tumor disease, e.g. renal cancer. The present invention further relates to the use of such a combination for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of a proliferative disease; a commercial package or product comprising such a combination as a combined preparation for simultaneous, separate or sequential use together with instructions to use such combination, to a method of treatment of a warm-blooded animal, especially a human, and improved regimens for the administration of 1 -(4-chloroanilino)-4-(4-pyridylmethyl)phthalazine.<br>
4-Pyridylmethyl-phthalazine derivatives that are selective inhibitors of VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase and their preparation, pharmaceutical formulations thereof and methods of making such compounds are described in W000/59509, EPO2/04892, WO 01/1 0859 and, in particular, in U.S. Patent No. 6,258,812, which are here incorporated by reference.

The corresponding content thereof is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
The present invention further relates to a "combined preparation" comprising (a) a 4-pyridylmethyl-phthalazine antiangiogenic agent, in particular 1-(4-chloroanilino)-4-(4-pyridylmethyl)phthalazine, and (b) one or more chemotherapy agents, in particular oxaliplatin, folinic acid and 5-fluoruracil. The term "a combined preparation", as used herein defines especially a "kit of parts" in the sense that the combination partners (a) and (b) as defined above can be dosed independently or by use of different fixed combinations with distinguished amounts of the combination partners (a) and (b), i.e., simultaneously or at different time points. The parts of the kit of parts can then, e.g., be administered simultaneously or chronologically staggered, that is at different time points and with equal or different time intervals for any part of the kit of parts. Thus, the present invention futher   ,<br><br>
includes a commercial package comprising 1-(4-chloroanilino)-4-(4-pyridylmethyl)phthalazine or a pharmaceutical^ acceptable salt thereof in a form suitable for oral administration and instructions to administer the 1-(4-chloroanilino)-4-(4-pyridylmethyl)phthalazine or a pharmaceutical^ acceptable salt thereof while a patient is undergoing chemotherapy for a solid tumor disease.<br>
The present invention also relates to the use of a COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION for the treatment of a proliferative disease and for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of a proliferative disease.<br>
The inventive combination therapy is especially useful for the treatment of solid tumor diseases. The term "solid tumor diseases" especially means renal cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, cancer of the colon, for example advances colorectal cancer, and generally the Gl tract like, e.g., gastric cancer, cervix cancer, lung cancer, in particular small-cell lung cancer, and non-small-cell lung cancer, head and neck cancer, bladder cancer, cancer of the prostate, Kaposi's sarcoma, carcinoid tumors and carcinoid syndrome. The present combination inhibits the growth of solid tumors and liquid tumors and is also suited to prevent the the metastatic growth of these tumors.<br>
The term "carcinoid tumor" as used herein relates to a neuroendocrine tumor arising from the enterochromaffin cells which cells are scattered mainly throughout the intestine and main bronchi. Peptides synthesized by carcinoid tumors include 5-hydroxytryptamine and 5-hydroxytrypthophan.<br>
The term "carcinoid syndrome" as used herein relates to a disease, in particluar the manifestation of an advanced disease, the symptoms of which include cutaneous flushing, diarrhea and palpable abdominal mass or hepatomegaly. In said disease the urinary concentration of 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-HIAA) typically relates directly to the tumor volume and correlates with the chance of survival. A level of &gt; 8 mg/24 hours of 5-HIAA is a sensitive measurement in 75 % of all cases of carcinoid syndrome. Another indicator for the syndrome is an increased plasma serotonin level, in particluar a plamsa serotonin level higher than about 250, especially 350 ng/ml.<br><br>
The term "metastatic growth" as used herein comprises the metastatic spread of tumors and the growth and development of micrometastases in other organs of the cancer patients.<br>
It will be understood that references to the combination partners (a) and (b) are meant to also include the pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts of the compounds.<br>
A combination which comprises (a) at least one antineoplastic agent known in chemotherapy and (b) a 4-pyridylmethyI-phthalazine derivative, in which the active ingredients are present in each case in free form or in the form of a pharmaceutical^ acceptable salt and optionally at least one pharmaceutical^ acceptable carrier, will be referred to hereinafter as a COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION.<br>
The nature of proliferative diseases is multifactorial. Under certain circumstances, drugs with different mechanisms of action may be combined. However, just considering any combination of drugs having different mode of action does not necessarily lead to combinations with advantageous effects.<br>
All the more surprising is the experimental finding that in wVothe administration of a COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION, results not only in a beneficial effect, especially a synergistic therapeutic effect, e.g. with regard to slowing down, arresting or reversing the neoplasm formation or a longer duration of tumor response, but also in further surprising beneficial effects, e,g. less side-effects, an improved quality of life and a decreased mortality and morbidity, compared to a monotherapy applying only one of the pharmaceutical^ active ingredients used in the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION.<br>
The effective dosage of each of the combination partners employed in the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION may vary depending on the particular compound or pharmaceutical composition employed, the mode of administration, the condition being treated, the severity of the condition being treated. Thus, the dosage regimen the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION is selected in accordance with a variety of factors including the route of administration and the renal and hepatic function of the patient. A physician, clinician or veterinarian of ordinary skill can readily determine and prescribe the effective amount of the single active ingredients required to prevent, counter or arrest the progress of the condition. Optimal precision in achieving concentration of the active ingredients within the range that<br><br>
yields efficacy without toxicity requires a regimen based on the kinetics of the active ingredients' availability to target sites.<br>
For the determination of the active dosage of a 4-pyridylmethyl-phthalazine antiangiogenic agent to be applied to patients and, in particular, to be applied to an individual patient, in monotherapy or combination therapy, two biomarkers, DCE-MRI and plasma VEGF level, along with exposure, safety, and tumor response data can be employed. For this purpose, patients, e.g., receive a continuous daily dose of, e.g., 50, 150, 300, 500, 750, 1000, 1500 or 2000 mg of 1-(4-chloroanilino)«4-(4-pyridylmethyl)phthalazine. Pharmacokinetic (PK) samples are taken at predose, and days 1,15, and 28. DCE-MRI, which reflects the change in tumor perfusion and vascularity, are performed at baseline, day 2, and day 28. For all evaluable MRI scans, contrast enhancement for the whole tumour can be assessed by calculating the bi-directional transfer constant (Ki) and expressed as a percentage of baseline Ki for evaluation on day 2 and 28. Plasma VEGF, a proangiogenic factor produced by the tumor cells, reflects the hypoxic status of the tumor and are sampled at baseline, and on days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 28. A significant relationship exists between the percentage of baseline Ki and an increase in the dose of the 4-pyridylmethyl-phthalazine antiangiogenic agent, its exposure, and its plasma concentration as determined by the Spearman Rank Correlation. Furthermore, a significant relationship exists between the percentage reduction in Ki and the change in liver disease size at the end of cycle 2 as measured by the change in the sum of all measurable liver lesions (bi-dimensional product). Patients with nonprogressive disease have a significantly greater reduction in mean ki. A 50 - 60% reduction in Ki is associated with non-progressive disease.<br>
In general, for the treatment of renal carcinoma, the 4-pyridylmethyl-phthalazine derivative can be given on a continuous basis, for example daily. For 1-(4-chloroanilino)-4-(4-pyridylmethyl)phthalazine, a daily oral dose in the range from 300 mg to 4000 mg, for example in the range from 300 mg/day to 2000 mg/day or 300 mg/day to 1000 mg/day, in particular 300, 500, 750, 1000, 1500 or 2000 mg/day, are contemplated as a pharmaceutical^ effective dose. However, other administration schedules are also likely to be effective and are included within the scope of the present invention.

It is one objective of this invention to provide a pharmaceutical composition comprising a quantity, which is jointly therapeutically effective against a proliferative disease comprising the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION. In this composition, the combination partners (a) and (b) can be administered together, one after the other or separately in one combined unit dosage form or in two separate unit dosage forms. The unit dosage form may also be a fixed combination.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions for separate administration of the combination partners (a) and (b) and for the administration in a fixed combination, i.e. a single galenical compositions comprising at least two combination partners (a) and (b), according to the invention can be prepared in a manner known per se and are those suitable for enteral, such as oral or rectal, and parenteral administration to mammals (warm-blooded animals), including man, comprising a therapeutically effective amount of at least one pharmacologically active combination partner alone or in combination with one or more pharmaceutical^ acceptable carries, especially suitable for enteral or parenteral application.<br>
Novel pharmaceutical composition contain; for example, from about 10 % to about 100 %, preferably from about 20 % to about 60 %, of the active ingredients. Pharmaceutical preparations for the combination therapy for enteral or parenteral administration are, for example, those in unit dosage forms, such as sugar-coated tablets, tablets, capsules or suppositories, and furthermore ampoules. If not indicated otherwise, these are prepared in a manner known per se, for example by means of conventional mixing, granulating, sugar-coating, dissolving or lyophilizing processes. It will be appreciated that the unit content of a combination partner contained in an individual dose of each dosage form need not in itself constitute an effective amount since the necessary effective amount can be reached by administration of a plurality of dosage units.<br>
A further aspect of the present invention relates to the use of improved regimens for the administration of 1-(4-chloroaniIino)-4-(4-pyridylmethyl)phthalazine, or a pharmaceutical^ acceptable salt thereof, for the treatment of patients suffering from solid tumor diseases, including, e.g., renal cancer. According to one inventive regimen 1-(4-chloroanilino)-4-(4-<br><br>
pyridylmethyOphthalazine, or a pharmaceutical^ acceptable salt thereof, is administered twice or more daily, for example two or three times daily, in reduced amounts compared with the known once daily administration regimens. Alternatively, the present invention embraces a treatment regimen wherein 1-(4-chloroaniIino)-4-(4-pyridyImethyl)phthalazine is administered once daily at a dose in the range from 1000 mg/day to 1400 mg/day, particularly a dose of 1200 mg/day to 1300 mg/day, especially 1250 mg/day. The inventive dosing regimens reduce the toxic effects of 1-(4-chloroanilino)-4-(4-pyridylmethyl)phthalazine and improve the efficacy of the treatment by permitting an effective level of the drug, for example above about 1 micromolar, to be maintained for a longer period.<br>
Thus, the present invention relates to a method of administering 1-(4-chloroaniiino)-4-(4-pyridylmethyl)phthalazine to a patient, which comprises administering a pharmaceutical^ effective amount of 1-(4-chloroanilino)-4-(4-pyridylmethyl)phthalazine, or a pharmaceutically •   acceptable salt thereof, to the patient on a twice daily schedule.<br>
Alternatively, the present invention relates to a method of administering 1-(4-chloroanilino)-4-(4-pyridylmethyl)phthalazine to a patient, which comprises administering 1-(4-chloroanilino)-4-(4-pyridylmethyl)phthalazine, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, to the patient on a once daily schedule at a dose in the range from 1000 mg/day to 1400 mg/day, particularly a dose of 1200 mg/day to 1300 mg/day, such as 1250 mg/day.<br>
The invention further relates to a method of treating a solid tumor disease in a patient, which comprises administering a pharmaceutically effective amount of 1-(4-chloroanilino)-4-(4-pyridylmethyl)phthalazine, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, to the patient on a twice daily schedule, or alternatively on a once daily schedule.<br>
1-(4-ChloroaniIino)-4-(4-pyridylmethyl)phthalazine is especially useful for inhibiting metastatic growth of a cancer. Thus, the present invention further relates to method of inhibiting metastatic growth in a patient with a cancer, particularly a solid tumor cancer, which comprises administering a pharmaceutically effective amount of 1-(4-chloroanilino)-4-(4-pyridylmethyl)phthalazine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, to the patient on a twice daily schedule. Alternatively, the present invention further relates to method of inhibiting metastatic growth in a patient with a cancer, particularly a solid tumor cancer, which comprises administering a pharmaceutically effective amount of 1-(4-chloroanilino)-4-<br><br>
(4-pyridylmethyl)phthalazine or a pharmaceutical^ acceptable salt thereof, to the patient on a once daily schedule at a dose in the range from 1000 mg/day to 1400 mg/day, particularly a dose of 1200 mg/day to 1300 mg/day, such as 1250 mg/day.<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention, 1-(4-chloroanilino)-4-(4-pyridyImethyl)-phthalazine is given twice daily on a continuous basis, alone, or during and subsequent to other therapies, for example chemotherapy. A daily oral administration of an amount in the range from 300 mg to 4000 mg, for example in the range from 300 mg/day to 2000 mg/day or 300 mg/day to 1000 mg/day, in particular 300, 500, 750, 1000, 1500 or 2000 mg/day, split into two doses, is contemplated as a pharmaceutical^ effective amount in the twice daily regimen. A 1000 mg/day dose is given as two 500 mg doses 6 to 12 hours apart, for example about 8 hours apart, and a 2000 mg/day dose is administered as two 1000 mg doses 6 to 8 hours'apart, for example about 12 hours apart.<br>
In the alternative once daily dosage regimen, a dose in the range from 1000 mg/day to 1400 mg/day, particularly a dose of 1200 mg/day to 1300 mg/day, such as 1250 mg/day is administered about once per 24 hour period.<br>
When 1-(4-chloroanilino)-4-(4-pyridylmethyl)phthalazine is administered as a pharma-ceutically acceptable salt, an equivalent amount of the free base (i.e. one equivalent to the amounts described above) is administered. In this application, reference to 1-(4-chloroanilino)-4-(4-pyridylmethyl)phthalazine is intended to include pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts thereof.<br>
The different aspects of the present invention can be combined freely with each other. For example, a renal cancer patient or a patient having another tumor type can be teated by administering 1"(4-chloroanilino)-4-(4-pyridylmethyl)phthalazine on a daily basis or twice daily. The improved regimens of administering 1-(4-chloroaniiino)-4-(4-pyridylmethyl)-phthalazine can be applied in monotheraoy or in combination therapy, with other words, 1-(4-chloroani!ino)-4-(4-pyridyImethyl)phthalazine is administered alone, or in combination with other therapeutic agents. As a combination therapy, it is administered on a once or twice daily basis as described herein and any other therapeutic agent or agents are administered according to its established administration regimen.<br><br>
Example 1<br>
15 Patients with histologically confirmed metastatic colorectal cancer seven of which had previously received adjuvant chemotherapy are treated with a combination of 1-(4-chloro-anilino)-4-(4-pyridylmethyl)phthalazine and a chemotherapy regimen. The chemotherapy regimen is 85 mg/m2 of oxaplatin on day 1, 200 mg/m2 of folinic acid given as a 2 hour infusion on days 1 and 2, and 5-fluorouracil administered as a bolus at a dose of 400 mg/m2 followed by 600 mg/m2 over 22 hours on days 1 and 2. The chemotherapy regimen is given every 14 days. 1-(4-Chloroanilino)-4-(4-pyridylmethyl)phthalazine is administered continuously as a single daily dose of 500 mg/day, 1000 mg/day or 2000 mg/day. The treatment is well-tolerated. The pharmacokinetics of oxaplatin are not altered by coadministration of 1-(4-chloroanilino)-4-(4-pyridylmethyl)phthalazine. Stable diseases are observed in 2 patients, minor responses in 3 patients and partial responses in 8 patients.<br>
Example 2<br>
Ten patients having metastatic renal cell carcinoma, six of which had previous biologic therapy, are treated with 300, 750 or 1000 mg/day of 1-(4-chloroanilino)-4-(4-pyridyl-methyl)phthalazine administered once a day orally. Seven of the ten patients maintain stable disease for a median of 3 months.<br>
Example 3<br>
Patients with histologically confirmed advanced solid tumors and measurable disease are orally administered 1-(4-chloroanilino)-4-(4-pyridylmethyl)phthalazine twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Sequential cohorts of patients (3 evaluable at each dose) are treated at total daily doses of 300 mg, 500 mg, 1000 mg and 2000 mg, which was split into two separate doses administered 8 hours apart. The patients are monitored by dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) of tumors to provide a measure of the bi-dimensional transfer constant (Ki) prior to treatment, on day 2 and after every 28 day cycle. In addition, tumor volume is measured by magnetic resonance imaging every 28 days, and full pharmacokinetic profiles are obtained on days 1 and 28. Treatment is well tolerated with no drug-related SAEs. The following toxicities are found among the<br><br>
patients administered the 300 mg, 500 mg and 1000 mg daily doses that are entered: transient grade 3 elevations of liver transaminases (2 patients), grade 1 lethargy (one patient), grade 2 lightheadedness (4 patients). DCE-MRI reveals the following reductions compared with baseline (median % reduction days 2.28 respectively 300 mg - 68.3, 500 mg - 72.98). The pharmacokinetic study shows a mean Cmin (ng/ml) and area under the curve (AUC)(h.ng.ml) respectively of 300 mg - 7.7, 82; 500 mg - 4.3, 46; 1000 mg - 27, 370. The data from the study indicates a biological effect in reducing tumor perfusion/vascular permeability and slowing tumor growth.<br>
Example 4<br>
Patients with histologically confirmed advanced solid tumors and measurable disease are orally administered 1-(4-chloroanilino)-4-(4-pyridylmethyl)phthalazine once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Sequential cohorts of patients (3 evaluable at each dose) are treated at total daily doses of 50 mg, 150mg , 300 mg, 500 mg, 750 mg, 1000 mg, 1200 mg, 1500 mg and 2000 mg administered as a single daily dose. Full Pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling is performed at predose, and days 1,15 and 28. DCE-MRI, which reflects the change in tumor perfusion and vascular permeability, are performed at baseline, and days 2 and 28. For all evaluable MRI scans, contrast enhancement for the whole tumour are assessed by calculating the bi-directional transfer constant (Ki). Plasma VEGF, a pro-angiogenic factor produced by the tumor cells, reflects the hypoxic status of the tumor and is determined at baseline, and on days 1, 8, 15, 22 and 28. Of a total of 76 patients from two Phase I studies, 22 patients with colorectal cancer and liver metastasis were evaluable for DCE-MRI analysis and 63 patients with advanced cancers for plasma VEGF and PK analysis. Using SWOG response criteria, non-progressive disease was defined as &gt; 2 months stable disease.<br>
1-(4-chloroanilino)-4-(4-pyridylmethyt)phthalazine is rapidly absorbed (Tmax 1 to 2.5 hours). At steady-state, which was achieved by day 15, the systemic exposure (AUC) is approximately 30% decreased compared to day 1. Dose proportional increase in exposure is observed up to 1000 mg/day. The terminal half-life is 3 to 6 hours. No dose-limiting toxicity is observed up to 2000 mg/day.<br><br>
A relationship exists between the percentage of baseline Ki at days 2 and 28 and the increase in dose (day 2: p=0.01; day 28: p=0.0003), exposure (AUC; day 2: p1000 mg/day achieved up to 5 fold rise in plasma VEGF levels within the first 28<br>
