The invention relates to a branched hydroxyl-fictional polyester resin and an aqueous dispersion and a cross-linkable binder composition comprising the same. The resin has an average hydroxyl functionality of &gt; 2, a hydroxyl number of 25 to 300 mg KOH/g, and a number average molecular weight within the range of from 500 to 3,000, which polyester resin comprises polyalkylene oxide groups and, optionally, sulphonate groups.<br>
Polyester resins and their use in two-component aqueous-based coating compositions are known from, int. al., EP-A-0 537 568 and WO 94/28043. The water-dilatable. polyesters disclosed therein contain both sulphonate and hydroxyl groups. Though high-quality coating layers can be obtained with the known aqueous-based coating compositions, the solids content of the aqueous polyester dispersions used in the known compositions is too low to be competitive in a great many applications, such as coating compositions to be used in automotive refinishing shops. The concentration of the polyester particles in the examples of both prior art publications does not exceed 35 wt. %. Furthermore, the storage stability of the aqueous polyester dispersions is inferior. Moreover, in order to emulsify the hydrophobic polyisocyanates in EP-A-0 537 568, frequently use has to be made of an external emulsifier, whereas in the examples of WO 94/28043 always use is made of polyisocyanate modified with polyethylene oxide glycol.<br>
A disadvantage of high water content is that the elimination of said water after the composition has been formed into, int. al, a coating layer requires a lot of time and energy. A further disadvantage of the known coating compositions is that the binder compositions exempHfied in WO 94/28043 are said to have a gel time of 3 to 6 hours, whereas on the other hand the curing speed of the binder compositions exemplified in WO 94/28043 is rather low (&gt; 12 hrs at 50’C).<br><br>
The invention now provides a branched hydroxyi-functionai polyester resin having an average hydroxyl functionality of &gt; 2, a hydroxy! number of 25 to 300 mg KOH/g, and a number average molecular weight within the range of from 500 to 3,000, which polyester resin comprises polyalkylene oxide groups and, optionally, sulphonate groups, characterised in that the polyester resin comprises the reaction product of<br>
1)	a module of cartxDxydc acids comprising<br>
50 to 80 mole% of an m- and/or p-aromatic and/or cycioaliphatic dicarboxyiic acid,<br>
20 to 50 mole% of an aliphatic dicariDoxylic acid and/or aliphatic monocarboxylic acid with more than 6 carbon atoms, and, optionally, a tri- or higher-functional acid, and<br>
2)	a mixture of alcohols comprising<br>
an aliphatic did with at least 4 carrion atoms and/or a cydoaliphatic diol with at least 4 carton atoms, a CrC4 alkoxy polyalkylene oxide glycol and/or CrC4 alkoxy polyalkylene oxide 1,3-diol having a number average molecular weight of 500 to 3,000, and, optionally, a tri- or higher-functional playschool, wherein the polyester resin has a carboxylic acid number of 
Also provided according to the invention is an aqueous dispersion comprising the branched hydroxyi-functionai polyester resin and an aqueous cross-linkable binder composition comprising the branched hydroxyi-functionai polyester resin and a organic hydrophobic polyisocyanate. Further provided according to the invention is the use of the aqueous cross-linkable binder composition in coating compositions,   lacquer compositions,   and   adhesives.   Finally,  the  present<br><br>
invention provides the use of such aqueous coating compositions in car refinish applications.<br>
The storage stability of the branched hydroxyl-functional polyester resin according to the invention is excellent Aqueous dispersions comprising the branched hydroxyl-functional polyester resin may have a solids content of more titan 45 Wl% at a viscosity of up to 5 Pa.s. The branched hydroxyl-functional polyester resin is able to disperse organic hydrophobic polyisocyanates in the absence of external emulsifiers. Aqueous cross-linkable binder compositions comprising a branched hydroxyl-functional polyester resin and an organic hydrophobic polyisocyanate have an acceptable pot life and cure speed. Aqueous coating compositions comprising the aqueous cross-linkable binder composition according to the present invention provide coatings having excellent properties like gloss, hardness, and distinctness of image (DOl).<br>
The branched hydroxyl-functional polyester resin can be prepared using conventional polymerisation procedures known to be effective for polyester resin synthesis. The reacBon to form the polyester resin may be conducted in one or more stages. In order to obtain a branched polyester resin, the conder’ati'on reaction is carried out in the presence of a branching agent, which may be a tri- or higher-functional acid and/or alcohol. For tiie tri- or higher-functional acid preference is given to an add selected from the group of trimelfiHc acid and pyromellitic acid or the anhydride thereof- For the tri- or higher’unctional polyalcohol preference is given to a polyalcohol selected from tine group of 1,1,1-trimethylol propane, 1,1,1-trimethylol ethane, 1,2,3-tiimethylol propane, pentaeryOirrtol, and mixtures thereof. More preferred is the use of a prior higher-functional playschool. Most preferred is the use of 1,1,1-trimethylol propane.<br><br>
If desired, the polyester resin may contain a proportion of carbonylamino linking groups -C(=0)-NH- (i.e. amide linking group) by including an appropriate amino-functional reactant as part of the "hydroxyl component" (such amide linkages are in fact useful in that Italy are more hydnDlysis-resistant and more hydrophilic.)<br>
In order to achieve hydroxyl functionality in the resulting polyester resin, a stoichiometric excess of the hydroxyl component should be used. Furthermore, in order to achieve an average hydroxyl functionality of &gt; 2, preferably 2.3, more preferably   2.5, the polyester resin must have a branched structure.<br>

mentioned dimethyl dipropylene glycol, methyl ether of diacetone alcohol, ethyl<br>
acetate, butyl acetate, ethyl glycol acetate, butyl glycol acetate, l-methoxy-2-<br>
propyl acetate,  butyl propionate, ethoxy ethyl propionate, toluene, xylene;<br>

The coating composition of the present invention may be applied to any substrate. The substrate may_ be, for example, metal, plastic, wood, glass, ceramic, or some other coating layer. The other coating layer may be comprised of the coating composition of the current invention or it may be a different coating composition. The coating compositions of the current invention show particular utility as clear coats, base coats, pigmented top coats, primers, and fillers. The coating compositions can be applied by conventional means such as by spray gun, brush, or roller, spraying being preferred. Curing temperatures preferably are between 0 and 80°C and more preferably between 10 and 60°C. The compositions are particularly suitable in the preparation of coated metal substrates, such as in the refinish industry, in particular the body shop, to repair automobiles and transportation vehicles, and in finishing large transportation vehicles such as trains, trucks, buses, and aero planes.<br>
Preferred is the use of the coating composition of the present invention as a clear coat. Clear coats are required to be highly transparent and must adhere<br><br>
well to the base coat layer. It is further required that the clear coat does not change the aesthetic aspect of the base coat by strike-in, i.e. discolourations of the base coat due to its solvation by the clear coat composition, or by yellowing of the clear coat upon outdoor exposure. A clear coat based on the coating composition of the present invention does not have these drawbacks.<br>
In the case of the coating composition being a clear coat tiie base coat may be a conventional base coat known in the coating art Examples are solvent bome base coats, e.g., Autobase® ex Akzo Nobel Coatings BV, based on cellulose acetobutyrate and acrylic resins, and water bome base coats, e.g., Autowave®<br>
0<br>
ex Akzo Nobel Coatings BV, based on an acrylic.resin dispersion. Furthermore, the base coat may comprise pigments (colour pigments, metallics and/or pearls), wax, solvents, flow additives, neutralising agent, and defoamers. Also high solids base coats can be used. These are, for instance, based on polyols, imines, and isocyanates. The clear coat composition is applied to the surface of a base'coat and then cured. An intermediate curing step for the base coat may be introduced,.<br>
The invention will be illustrated with reference to the following examples. Of course these examples are submitted for a better understanding of the invention only; they are not to be construed as limiting in any manner the scope thereof.<br><br>
Examples<br>
In the following examples, the preparation of a number of water borne polyester resin dispersions and binder compositions according to the invention is disclosed. The properties measured on these dispersions are listed in Table 1. The dispersions' average particle size given in to table was detemnined with the aid of dynamic fight scattering, with tiie dispersions diluted to a solids content of about 0.1 wL%. The viscosity was determined with a Brookfield viscometer (LV - 4; 60 revolutions per minute). The solids content was determined in accordance with ASTM motion no. 1644-59, within heating to MO'‘C over a period of 30 minutes. The Mn was measured with GPC with polystyrene as standard.<br>

than that of those prepared with LS 2032 and displayed excellent water and<br>
solvent resistance.<br><br><br>
Note that the coating layers of Examples 11a to 13a (Examples 37 to 42) gained hardness when the ratio of isophthalic acid to sebacic acid was increased. The same applies for the increase in OH functionality.<br><br>
Examples 49 to 68<br>
Mixtures of the polyester resin dispersions with LS 2025 using 0.1 wt.% of Sn diorite as catalyst’ were diluted to spraying viscosity, sprayed over a water borne metallic base coat (Autowave® ex Akzo Nobel Coatings BV). and allowed to dry at 60=*C for 30 minutes as well as at ambient temperature (RT). The NCOiOH ratio was 1.5.<br>
After one day the D.O.I, (distinction of image) and the gloss were measured in accordance with ASTM D-523 at 20° and 60°. A D.0.1. of between 60 and 80 is acceptable, whereas a gloss value on a base coat at 20° of above 80 is considered high, while a gloss value at 60° of above 90 is considered very high. The results are given in Table 3,<br><br><br>
Examples 69 to 74<br>
The aqueous polyester resin dispersions (component A) were mixed with poly-functional isocyanate cross-linkers (component B) in a ratio NCO:OH = 1.5 using 0.1 wt.% of Sn dilaurate as catalyst. The aqueous coating composition was diluted with methoxy isopropyl acetate to obtain a volatile organic content of 250 g/l, For the isocyanate cross-linkers use was made of four polyisocyanates, all commercially available from Bayer:<br>
a)	Desmodur LS 2025 (a hydrophobic isocyanurate based on 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate),<br>
b)	Desmodur LS 2550 (a hydrophobic uretdione based on 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate),<br>
c)	Bayhydur LS 2032 (a hydrophilic isocyanurate based on 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate, modified with about 12 wt.% of methoxy polyethylene oxide glycol), and<br>
d)	Desmodur LS 2150 (a hydrophilic isocyanurate based on isophorone diisocyanate, modified with about 9 wt.% of methoxy polyethylene oxide glycol).<br>
The mixtures of polyester resin dispersions and the isocyanate components were applied on steel panels. The panels were allowed to dry at ambient (room) temperature (RT) for one week. The Persoz Hardness was determined in accordance with French industrial standard method NF T30-016, the result being expressed in seconds, and is given in Table 4.<br><br><br>
Examples 75 to 80<br>
