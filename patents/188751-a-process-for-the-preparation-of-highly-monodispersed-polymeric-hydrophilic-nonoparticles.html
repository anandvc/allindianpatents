				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION <br>
This invention relatos to a process for the preparation of highly ;nonodispersed polymeric hydrophilic nanoparticlos with or without target molecules encapsulated therein and having sizes of upto 100 nm and a high monodispersity. PRIOR ART<br>
Following an administration of a drug in a living system the active substance is distributed throughout the body st a function of its physicochemical properties** and molecular structure. The final amount of drug reaching its target site may only be a small fraction of the administered dose. Accumulation of drug at the non-targeted site may lead to adverse effect and undesirable side reactions. Therefore, targeting of drug to specific body sites is necessary.<br>
One way of modifying the biodistribution of drugs in the body is to entrap them in ultrafine drug carriers. Among these carriers, liposomes, nanoparticles and pharmacosomes have been extensively studied. The* use of liposomes as drug targeting agents is found to be limited due mainly to the problems of low entrapment efficiency, drug instability, rapid drug leakage and poor storage stability.   With  the turn of  overcoming   these<br>
problems, the production of polymeric nanoparticles has been investigated since the last two decades. Nanoparticles are defined as solid colloidal particles ranging in «ize from about lOntr to lOOOnm.<br>
A large number of studies hava been reported on recent advances in drug targeting possibilities and sustain release action with nanoparticles encapsulating drugs. In vivo studies have also been reported with special attention to the reticuloendothelial system (RES). Some in vivo studies concerning nanoparticles administration by oral and ocular routes have also been reported in the literature with rwspect to the possible improvements of bioavailability. These polymeric nanoparticles should be non antigenic, biocompatible and biodegradable.<br>
The important characteristics of the particles used for targeting at specific body sites were found to be influenced mainly by two factors: (i) the size of the nanoparticles and (ii) the surface  characteristics of  the  nanoparticles.<br>
Parti Ices smaller than 7 nm and specially nanopartides are not filtered in the lung and their biodistribution <e dependent on their interaction with reticuloendothelial system biodegradable nanoparticlas are mainly taken up by the kupffer cells in liver while small amount of these particles go to macrophages spleen and bone marrow. marrow uptake targeting at other sites can be modified drastically reducing particle size. nanopaf tides diameter above have biodistrihution res. distribution however reversed if size is made much smaller loonm surfaces hydrophilic. as an tkample it has been found that separated into three ranges lsonir rendered hydrophilic adsorbing poloxamer type surfactants then sized maximum surface hydrophilicity mostly than shown fig.l accompanying drawings. specifically shows dependant></e>
nanoparticles, uncoatt*d and coated with poloxamer surfactant by bone marrow. These small particles in the blood serum do not adsorb serum protein through opsonisation and as a result, their circulation time in blood is considerably increased. Hydrophobic particles are removed from the circulation very ra-pidly due to opsonisation. Nanometer sized particles with hydrophilic surface remain in blood for lunger period of time so that targeting at specific sites may be facilitated.<br>
At present, nanoparticles for drug encapsulation are prepared by methods involving either polymerisation of dispersed monomers or a dispersion of prefor-nad polymers in emulsion in presence of desired drug. The methods known in the art for the preparation of nanoparticles &amp;re (i) dispersion polymerisation method, (ii)emulsion polymerisation method, (iii) dispersion of synthetic polymer nanospheres in emulsion, and (iv)<br>
interfacial polymerisation technique. In all these methods emulsions of oii-in-water are used and the polymer  is formed or dissolved in the  oil  phase.<br>
As a result, the polyasric materials are always hydrophobic because they »re to be soluble in oil and the particles formed are nanoparticles of larger size <i above loonm because the average size of emulsion droplets is mostly and diameter. more over since are highly polydispersed> the nanoparticles formed have broad spectrum size range and these are also highly polydispersed. Thus, in such known processes (i) one cannot prepare nanoparticles of subcolloidal size and (ii) the emulsion medium demands that the polymeric materials should be hydrophobic.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
An  object of this invention is to propose  a novel   process  for  ths  preparation  of   highly monodispersed   polymeric  nanoparticles with   or without   targeted  materials and having a  size of upto 100 nm with a high monodispersity.<br>
A  further  object  of this  inventon  is  to propose a process for the preparation of said polymeric monoparticles  capable of  being   modulated   to required sizes.<br>
Another object of  this  invention  is  to propose  a  process  for the  preparation  of  said highly  monodospersed  polymeric  nanoparticles of subcollodial   size with  or  without   targeted materials.<br>

A further object af this invention is to propose a process for the preparation of said highly monadispersed drug loaded polymeric nanoparticles disposed in aqueous buffer and free of any toxic material.<br>
A still further object of this invention is to propose a process for the preparation of highly monodispersed drug loaded polymeric nanoparticles of hydrophillic in nature which obviates the disadvantages associated with these of the prior art.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to prepare a process for the insertion and loading of target drug/target substance in nanoparticles to secure them from outer intervention in vivo or cell culture invitro till they are exposed at the target site within the eel'..<br>
DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided<br>
a  process for the preparation of  highly  monodispersed polymeric hydrophillic ri*noparticles of the size of upto<br>
100   for  encapsulating  a   targeted  moiecu3 ess/drug material comprising:-i)     dissolving 0.01m to. 0.1m surfactant in an oil  to<br>
obtain reverse micoll«rs»<br>
ii)    adding  an  aqueous  solution  of  a  monomer  or<br>
preformed  polymer  to said  reverse micelles  and  a cross!inking  agent,  initiator  and drug  or  a  target<br>
substance being added therein if required; iii)    subjecting  such a  mixture  to  the step  of<br>
polymerization; iv)   drying said polvfcieriaed reaction material for  the<br>
removal of solvent so as to obtain dry nanoparticlos and surfactant, v)    dispersing tho dry mass in the aqueous buffer and<br>
vi)     separating  tht? surfactant  and  other-   toxic materials therefrom.<br>
In   accordance with  this  invention,   the aqueous core of a revere®  tnicellar droplet is used  as a   nanoreactor   for    the   preparation   of nanoparticles.   The sizfcs of the aqueous core of such droplets &amp;r&amp;     in  "the  range of   Inm-lOnm. The size of the particles which Are  formed  primarily inside  these droplets ar$ larger than the size of the aqueous core of the droplets.  Moreover,  since the  polymerisation  takes place   in  an   aqueous medium,    polymers  with  surface   hydrophilic properties are obtained by this invention.  Therefore, using  reverse  micellar  method  of  the   present invention,  it  is possible to prepare  very  small size nanoparticles with hydrophilic surface so that their  opsonisation  as well as uptake  by RES  is substantially  minimized.  It is  possible  because reverse  micellar droplets in which  the  polymeric reactions are carried out ^re  highly monodispersed*<br>
The aqueous phase is regulated in such a manner so as to keep the entire mixture in an optically transparent micro emulsion phase. The range of  the aqueous phase cannot be defined  as<br>
this would depend on factors such as the monomer, surfactant or polarity Of oil, and the only factor is that the system is in an optically transparent micro emulsion phase.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the monoparticles have a sige of upto 100 not,preferably a size of upto 10 nm to 100 nm.<br>
In accordance with this invention the aqueous core of a reverse micellar droplet is effectively used as nanoreactor to prepare ultrafine nanoparticleu and to encapsulate the drugs (normally water -soluble chemicals of maximum size upto that of 100-200 k Dalton protein By the process of the present invention, extremely small particles of sise of greater uniformity and down to about iOnm diameter has been achieved.<br>
The surfactant, sodium bis ethylhexylsulphosuccinate, or Aerosol0T (i,e,A0T) is dissolved in n-hexane to prepare reverse micelles. To the AQT solution in hexane (usually 0.03M to O.IM of ACT in hexane), aqueous solutions of monomer or preformed polymer, crosslinking agent,<br>
initiator and drug are Added and the polymerisation is done in presence of nitrogen gas. Additional amount of water may be added in order to get nanoparticles of larger size. The maximum amount of drug that can be dissDived in reverse micelles varies from drug to drug and has to be determined by gradually increasing the amount of drug till the clear microemulsion is transformed -into translucent solution. All the stoefc solutions are prepared in phosphate buffer and the contents swirled vigorously in order to ensure the transparency of the solution. The reaction mixture is purged with nitrogen gas. Polymerisation is done in nitrogen atmosphere. The solvent n-Hexane is then evaporated out at a temperature, for example, of 35 C using rotary evaporator under low pressure when tranparent dry mass iu Obtained. The material is dispersed in water and to it CaC12 solution is added drop  by  drop   till  3I1   the   calcium salt of<br><br>
diethylhexylsulphosuccinate (Ca(DEHSS)2  from AOT) is precipitated.  The mixture is then subjected  to centrifugation,  for example, at  15000 rpm  for  10 mins.   The  supernatant  is decanted  off   which contains  nanoparticl*m containing  encapsulated drug.   Some nanopartides  remain absorbed in  the cake of the precipitate.  For complete recovery of the nanoparticles  from, the  precipitated  calcium (DEHSS)2 the latter is dissolved in n-hexane and the nanoparticles  extracted with water.   The aqueous dispersion  is  immediately dialysed  through , for example, 12,000 cut off dialysis membrane for about one hour and the liquid lypophilised to dry  powder and stored at low temperature till further use.<br>
Reference  is now made  to Fig.2 of   the accompanying  drawings which illustrates  the  flow diagram  for nanoparticles using  microemulsion step  A  shows  a rewr&amp;e       micelle Al , proposed from water  in oil microe|nulsion.   Thus,  when  a<br>
surfactant is dissolved in oil, then the hydrophobic constituent tails A2 would remain in contact with oil and   an   inner  core A3  would   comprise   of hydrophillic constituents . When water is added to a solution  containing reverse micelle Al , of as the hydrophillic  constituent  is soluble in water, water is attracted to the hydrophillic  domain or core A3 A  monomer, croBslinking-agent, the required drug and initiator  is  added  to   the  reverse micelle  Al. As  the  aforesaid  constituents are  hydrophillic in nature,  such  constituents  go   to   the  core A3. Polymerisation   is   carried  out    in    nitrogen atmosphere to  form a polymer Bl   and  incapsulated drug   as  shown   in   step  B.    In    step  B, an  evaporation  is effected  under  low  pressure for removal   of   the aotvent.   Step C  illustrates the dried   mass  to consist of   Nanoparticles  CI ,   and surfactant C2 .  The dried  mass   is   dissolved   in phosphate   buffer  and  then  30% CaC12  added   thereto drop by drop in step D to   precipitate   the  surfactant as   calcium diethylhexylsulfosuccinate (DEHSS).  Step D illustrates the nanoparticles  CI and  calcium     DEHSS.<br>
The solution of step D is centrifuged at step E to obtain clear nanoparticles dispersed in  buffer and the precipitate of Ca(DEHSS)2.<br>
The cake of Ca(DEHSS)2 may contain some absprbed nanoparticles Which can be recovered by dissolving the cake in hexane and leaching the nanoparticles by buffer 2 to 3 times. The leaching solutions are collected elong with solution E. Such a buffer solution containing nanoparticles may still contain certain unreacted or toxic materials which are removed by dielyzing the solution for two hours  and  then freeze dried.<br>
Normally O.Oi to 0.1M AOT in n-hexane is used. Vinylpyrrolidone(VP) or mixture of vinylpyrrolidone and polyethyleneglycolfumarate(PESF) are used as monomers as they form water soluble hydrogels on polymerisation and are highly biocompatible. Another suitable polymer which has been used is bovine serani albumin. Other suitable water soluble hydrogels and biocompatible materials can be used for polymerisation. In case of hydrogels,  the crosslinking  is  done with  N,N<br>
methylene bis acrylamide (MBA) whereas albumin is crossl inked by glutaraldehyde. In case of polyvinylpyrroliding PVP crfcsslinked with MBA, the amount of monomer used is, for example, about 50 w% of AOT, of the amount of crosslinking agent (MBA) used is 1.2% w/w of the polymer. Such a composition has maximum shelf life and retention of drug by nanoparticles of this composition i.s also maximum. Loading of drug should be between 17. to 10% w/w of the polymer according to the solubility of the drug in the micellar system but it can be increased according to the solubility of the drug.<br>
The  following examples are  given by  way  of illustration  of the present invention  and  should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example-Ispreparation  of an  antigen  loaded polyvinylpyrrolidone  nanoparticles:<br><br>
An antigen, from Avspergilus fumigatus, has been used as a drug for encapsulation. In a 40ml of 0.03M AOT solution in htsxane, 140ul of freshly distilled pure vinylpyrfolidone, 35ul of N,N' methylene bis arylamidts (0.49mg/ml), 20ul of i/i ferrous ammonium suplphate solution, 40ul of 11.2/C aqueous solution of yeiramethylethylenediamine (TMED), lOul of 5%. potassium persulphate as initiator and 180 ul of antigen (antigen)=16 mg/ml) were added. The amount of excess buffer to be added in reverse micelles was governed by the desired size of the nanoparticles to be prepared. The volume of the excess buffer can be carried from zero to maximum amount up to which microemulsion formation is possible and no phase separation takes place. The solution was homogeneous and transparent. Polymerisation was done in presence of N2 gas at 30 C for 8 hours in a thermostatic bath with continuous stirring. The nanoparticles of  polyvinylpyrrolidone containing   encapsulated<br>
drug would be formed. The solvent was evaporated off in a rotary vacuum evaporator and the dry mass was resuspendd in 5ml of water. Calculated amount of 307. CaC12 solution was added drop by drop to precipitate AOT ay. calcium salt bisethylhexysulphosuccinate. The centrifuged aqueous solution contains nanoparticles which was homogeneous and almost transparent. The cake of calcium DEHSS after centrifugation contains some amount of nanoparticles absorbed in it. It was dissolved in 10ml of n-hexana and the hexane solution was washed 2-3 timfes each time with 1ml water. The phase separated clear aqueous layer was drained out and was collected with the original filtrate. The total aqueous dispersion of Nanoparticles was then dialysed (12,000 cut off membrane) for about 2 hours against water and the dialysed solution was lyophilised immediately to dry  powder for subsequent use.  The sample should<br>
be free from AOT, mohower, crosslinking agent and perdisulphate. Any trace amount of unreacted materials and surfactant could be detected through HPLC. Perdisulphate was detected chemically using starch iodide solution and the presence of AOT was tested as follows:<br>
To an lmg/ml solution' of dry powder, a drop of methylene blue dye was added. The solution was then mixed with 1ml of n-hexane thoroughly and was kept for phase separation. The hexane layer was then tested spectrophotomtetrically at 580nm for the presence of the dye.<br>
Example-IIs The nanoparticles from polyethyleneglycolfumarate were prepared as follows:<br>
5g of polyethylene glyco1600, 0.9-g of fumaric acid and 1.22m of hydroquinonfc were mixed together and heated at 190 C for 7-8 hours in a 100ml 3necked flask equipped with a thermometer, refluxing conderser and a nitrogen inlet . The product of was greenish yellow viscous liquid at room of temperature.<br>
In a 40ml of 0.06m AOT in n-hexane the following components were added. lOOul of polyethyleneglycol fumarate (0.1B6g/ml), lOul of freshly distilled vinylpyrrolidone, lOul of N,N' methylene bis arcylamide (0.049/g/ml), lOul of 0.5% ferrous ammonium sulphate, 20ul of 11.27. TMED and lOul or 20ul, as the case may be, of fluorescence isothiocyanate-dextran (FITC-dextran)Mol.wt. 16KD of concentration 160mg/ml. O-200ul of buffer depending on the size of the droplet were added.<br>
In the above solution N2 gas was passed for 30 mins and then lOul of 5% potassium perdisulphate was added as initiator with vigorous stirring. Thereafter, the nitrog&amp;n gas was passed through the solution for another six hours at 30 C.<br>
The nanoparticles were recoverd from the aqueous solution follcwing the same method as described earlier in the case of polyvinylpyrrolidone particles.<br>
Example-Ills  Preparation of Bovine Serum Albumin-gluteraldehyde nanoparticles.<br>
In  a 40 ml of 0.06m AOT in n-hexane 200ul  bovine serum  albumin   (1OOmg/ml)  and   0-600ul   water<br>
depending on the size  of the micellar droplets were added. The mixture was thoroughly stirred at room temperature till a trasnparent microemulsion was formed. To the wall stirred solution, 20ul 5'/. glutaradlehyde was added and the stirring was continued for another half an hour when the nanoparticles were formed. The aqueous solution of the nanoparticles were prepared from the AOT solution following the method as described in the case of polyvinylpyrrolidone above.<br>
The  nanoparticles were characterised  as follows:<br>
The entrapment efficiency of the FITC-dextran dye in polyvinylpyrrolidone nanoparticles was determined as follows: The aqueous extract including the repeated washings were collected and was made up the volume of 10ml. 500ml of the solution was filtered through 100KD membrane filter and 2ml phosphate buffer was added. The absorbance of the solution was measured at 493nm. The absorbance of the same concentration of free FITC in   phosphate  buffer was measured.   From   the<br>
difference in absorbances the entrapment efficiency<br>
was calculated  and the values as shown  in  the<br>
table was  found  to bs in  the  range  of  39-44%<br>
irrespective of the size of the nanoparticles.   We<br>
have studied (10-100nm).<br>

The size of the nanoparticles was determined by laser light scattering measurements. Dynamic laser light scattering measurements for determining the size of the nanoparticles were performed using Brookhaven 9000 instrument with BI200SM goniometer. Argon ion air cooled laser was operated at 488nm as a light source. The time dependence of the intensity autocorrelation function of the scattered intensity was derived by using 128 channel digital correlator. Intensity correlation data was processed by using the method of   cumulants.    The   translational    diffusion<br>
coefficient  (T)  of  the  particles dispersed  in<br>
aqueous buffer was obtained from a nonlinear  least<br>
square fit of the correlation curve using the decay<br>
equation.   From  the value of  the  translational<br>
diffusion   coefficient,    the   average    of<br>
hydrodynamic diameter Dh of the scattering particles<br>
was calculated by Stokes-Einstein relationship<br>
D = kT/3   T h<br>
where  k is Boltzman constant,n is the viscosity of<br>
the solvent at an absolute temperature T.<br>
The size of the drug loaded nanoparticles of<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone,    polyethyleneglycolfumarate<br>
and  bovine serum albumin  were determined  and<br>
representative spectra for each type are shown  in<br>
the figure 3(a).  Fig.3(a) (i to iii) show<br>
(i)    nanoparticles made of  polyethylene glycol<br>
fumarate containing FITO-Dextran,<br>
(ii)   nanoparticles made  of  polyvinylpyrrolidone<br>
containing FITC-Dextran,<br>
(iii)  nanoparticles made of bovine  serum albumin<br>
crosslinked with glutarnldehyde.<br>
Figure 3(b) shows the variation of particle size with the change of fcize of the microemulsion droplets. Interestingly the size of the polyvinylpyrrolidone nanoparticles increases exponentially with the increase of droplet size whereas the same remain more or less constant in case of bovine sarum albumin-gluteraldehyde particles.<br>
In vitro release kinetic studies: A known amount of lyophilised nanoparticles encapsulating FITC-dtjxtran was suspended in 10ml of phosphate buffer saline in 50ml polypropylene tubes. The tubes were placed in water bath maintained at 37 C. At predetermined intervals a volume of 500ul taken from each tube and was passed through a 100KD filter(Mlllipore UFP2THK24) which retained the nanoparticles and the free dye came out in the filtrcte..The dye concentration in the filtrate was determined spectrophotometrically.<br>
The results are shown in figure 4, which illustrates the release of FITC-dextran dye from polyethylene glycol funtarate particles of different drug loading, and whare curve XI shown a 6.47. loading and curve X2 is 3.2"/. loading of drug.<br>
In vivo antibody  response in mice serum  by injecting antigen encapsulated nanoparticles. Mice were injected subcutaneously three times at an interval   of   7 days  with  PVP       nanoparticles containing 300ug of Asporgillius fumigatus antigen of suspended  in lOOul of normal saline.   Each group contains five animals, three of which received  the antigen  entrapped in nanoparticles,  one  received free  antigen (300ug) and the controlled  received empty  nanoparticles suspended  in  normal  sline. Mice were bled at predetermined intervals and  the amount of Aspergilus fumigatus specific antibody in the mice  serum was assayed using  indirect  ELISA assay.   The results are  shown in figure 3,  which illustrates in vivo.<br>
Specific antibody response of antigen of Apergilus fumigatus entrapped in polyvinylpyrrolidone nanoparticles at different amount of cross linking agent with curves X3,X4, X5 and X6 having 07., 0.3%, 0.67. and 1.27. of cross linking agent.<br><br><br><br><br>
