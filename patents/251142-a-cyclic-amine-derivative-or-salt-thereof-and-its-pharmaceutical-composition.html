CYCLIC AMINE DERIVATIVE AND SALT THEREOF<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a cyclic amine derivative and its salt useful as<br>
medicines, especially as NMDA receptor antagonists, and to an NMDA receptor antagonist<br>
comprising it as the active ingredient thereof. The cyclic amine derivative and its salt and<br>
the NMDA receptor antagonist comprising it as an active ingredient according to the<br>
present invention are useful for treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease,<br>
cerebrovascular dementia, Parkinson's disease, ischemic apoplexy, pain, etc.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
Glutamic acid acts as a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system of<br>
mammals, and it controls the activity of neurocytes or the release of neurotransmitters via<br>
the glutamate receptor existing in synapses. At present, the glutamate receptor is<br>
classified into an "ion-channel glutamate receptor" and a "metabotropic glutamate receptor"<br>
from many physiological.and biological studies (Hollmann M. and Heinemann S., Annu.<br>
Rev. Neurosci., 17 (1994) 31-108). NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor is an ionchannel<br>
glutamate receptor specifically sensitive to the agonist NMDA (Moriyoshi K. et al.,<br>
Nature, 354 (1991) 31-37; Meguro H. et al., Nature, 357 (1992) 70-74); and this has high<br>
Ca2+ permeability (lino M. et al., J. Physiol., 424 (1990) 151-165). NMDA receptor is<br>
expressed with a specific pattern in a central nervous system (Ozawa S. et al., Prog.<br>
Neurobiol., 54 (1998) 581-618).<br>
From many pharmacological and biological studies, it is considered that NMDA<br>
receptor may participate in high-order neurologic functions such as memory and learning<br>
pis RG., et al, Nature, 319 (1986) 774-776; Tsien JZ. et al., Cell, 87 (1996) 1327-<br>
1338). On the other hand, it is suggested that acute or chronic NMD A receptor<br>
hyperactivity or hypoactivity may participate in various nervous system diseases, for<br>
example, ischemic apoplexy, hemorrhagic brain injury, traumatic brain injury,<br>
neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, cerebrovascular dementia,<br>
Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), glaucoma, AIDS<br>
encephalopathy, dependence, schizophrenia, depression, mania, stress-related diseases,<br>
epilepsy, pain (Beal MF., FASEB J., 6 (1992) 3338-3344; Heresco-Levy U. and Javitt DC.,<br>
Euro. Neuropsychopharmacol., 8 (1998) 141-152; Hewitt DJ., Clin. J. Pain, 16 (2000) S73-<br>
79). Accordingly, drugs capable of controlling the activity of NMD A receptor would be<br>
extremely useful in clinical application.<br>
[0003]<br>
As drugs capable of controlling the activity of NMD A receptor, a large number of<br>
non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonists are reported, but many of them are not as yet<br>
used in clinical application because of their side effects based on the NMDA receptorantagonizing<br>
effect thereof, for example, mental aberration such as hallucination or<br>
confusion, or giddiness. Some already-existing NMDA receptor antagonists, for example,<br>
ketamine and dextromethorphan have been tried for pain in clinical application (Fisher K.<br>
et al., J. Pain Symptom Manage., 20 (2000) 358-373), but the safety margin in the treatment<br>
with them is narrow and their clinical use is limitative (Eide PK., et al., Pain, 58 (1994)<br>
347-354). Memantine is known as a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist that has<br>
comparatively few side effects (Parsons CO., et al., Neuropharmacol., 38 (1999) 735-767);<br>
and recently, it has been reported that this may be effective for Alzheimer's disease<br>
(Reisberg B., et al., N. Engl. J. Med., 348 (2003) 1333-1341). However, the safety margin<br>
of memantine as a medicine is still not satisfactory, and an NMDA receptor antagonist<br>
having a broader safety margin is desired (Ditzler K., Arzneimittelforschung, 41 (1991)<br>
773-780; Maier C., et al., Pain, 103 (2003) 277-283; Riederer P., et al., Lancet, 338 (1991)<br>
1022-1023). It is expected that the creation of such an NMDA receptor antagonist having<br>
a bj^sder safety margin may bring about new clinical usefulness of the NMD A receptor<br>
antagonist.<br>
[0004]<br>
Patent Reference 1 describes a pharmaceutical composition for prevention and<br>
treatment of cerebral ischemia, which comprises an adamantane derivative of the following<br>
formula or its pharmaceutically-acceptable acid-addition salt.<br>
(wherein RI and RZ are the same or different, each representing a hydrogen atom, or a linear<br>
or branched alkyl group having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, or the like; RS and R4 are the<br>
same or different, each representing a hydrogen atom, or an alkyl group having from 1 to <br>
carbon atoms, or the like; RS represents a hydrogen atom, or a linear or branched alkyl<br>
group having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms; for the details of the symbols in the formula, the<br>
patent publication is referred to).<br>
In Patent Reference 1, the above-mentioned memantine is described as Test<br>
Compound No. 1 (memantine is a compound of the formula where RI, R2 and Ra are<br>
hydrogen atoms, and R4 and RS are methyl groups).<br>
[0005]<br>
Patent Reference 2 describes 1-amino-alkylcyclohexane of the following formula<br>
as an NMDA receptor antagonist.<br>
 (wherein R* is -(CH2)n-(CR6R7)m-NR8R9; n + m = 0,1 or 2; R sndentiy<br>
selected from a group consisting of a hydrogen atom and a Ci.6 lower alkyl group, and at<br>
least R1, R4 and R5 are lower alkyl groups; for the details of the symbols in the formula, the<br>
patent publication is referred to).<br>
[0006]<br>
Patent Reference 3 describes an indane derivative of the following formula,<br>
which is a type of a compound having an indane ring and a piperidine ring, and useful as a<br>
treating agent for allergy and asthma.<br>
(wherein RI and R2 each independently represent a CM alkyl group; RS represents a<br>
hydrogen atom, a CM alkyl group, a C1-4 alkoxy group, or the like; and the ring A may<br>
have a substituent; for the details of the symbols in the formula, the patent publication is<br>
referred to).<br>
However, in the compound described in this reference, the indane ring and the<br>
piperidine ring are bonded to each other via a double bond therebetween, and the structure<br>
of the compound differs from that of the compound of the present invention in that in the<br>
latter, the two rings are bonded to each other via a single bond or a lower alkylene group,<br>
etc. In addition, the compound described in the reference is useful as a treating agent for<br>
allergy and asthma, but the reference does neither disclose nor suggest the NMDA receptorantagonizing<br>
effect of the compound and the usefulness of the compound as a treating agent<br>
for Alzheimer's disease, cerebrovascular dementia, Parkinson's disease, ischemic apoplexy,<br>
pain, etc. In Example 1 in this reference, described is 6-chloro-2,2-dimethyl-l-(l-methyl-<br>
4-piperidinyl)indan-l-ol of the following formula, as an intermediate for producing the<br>
ed compound. However, this reference discloses nothing relating to the use of the<br>
intermediate for medicine.<br>
[0007]<br>
Non-Patent Reference 1 describes a compound of the following formula, which is<br>
a type of a compound having an indane ring or a tetrahydronaphthalene ring and a<br>
piperidine ring, and may be used as an analgesic agent. However, the structure of this<br>
compound differs from that of the compound of the present invention described(0<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
hereinunder, in that in the former, the saturated ring is substituted with a phenyl group. (wherein R represents a hydrogen atom, or a methyl group; R' represents a methyl group;<br>
R" represents -(CH2)3N(CH3)2, -(CHa^NCCHaXC^^CeHs, an N-methyl-piperidyl group, <br>
(CH2)2N(CH3)2; n indicates 0 or 1; for the details of the symbols in the formula, the patent<br>
publication is referred to).<br>

alkoxy group may be produced by processing the corresponding compound where Y1 is a<br>
hydroxyl group in a lower alcohol solvent in the presence of an acid catalyst such as<br>
camphorsulfonic acid with cooling or under heat.<br>
[0038]<br>
The deprotection may be attained in the presence of a suitable base in a suitable<br>
solvent. Examples of the base are NaOH, KOH, NaOMe, NaOEt. Examples of the<br>
solvent are ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, diglyme; alcohols such as MeOH,<br>
EtOH, i-PrOH; MeCN, water; and their mixtures. Depending on the type of the reaction<br>
substrate and the reaction condition, the solvent may be suitably selected. The reaction<br>
temperature may vary depending on the type of the starting compound and the reaction<br>
condition, generally covering from cooling to refluxing, preferably from about 0°C to about<br>
100°C.<br>
The deprotection may also be attained in the presence of a metal catalyst such as<br>
Pd-C, Pd(OH)2 or PtO2 in a suitable solvent in a hydrogen atmosphere, but may be attained<br>
in the presence of a suitable Lewis acid in a suitable solvent. Examples of the Lewis acid<br>
are BC13, BBr3, A1C13, and examples of the solvent are ethers such as tetrahydrofuran,<br>
dioxane; esters such as ethyl acetate; alcohols such as MeOH, EtOH; MeCN; and their<br>
mixtures. Depending on the type of the reaction substrate and the reaction condition, the<br>
solvent may be suitably selected. The reaction temperature may vary depending on the<br>
type of the starting compound and the reaction condition, generally covering from cooling<br>
to refluxing, preferably from about -80°C to about 30°C.<br>
Thus produced, the compounds (I) of the present invention may be isolated as<br>
free compounds or as their pharmaceutically-acceptable salts. Salts of the compounds (I)<br>
of the present invention may be produced by processing free bases of the compounds (I) of<br>
the present invention for ordinary salt formation.<br>
The compounds (I) of the present invention or their pharmaceutically-acceptable<br>
salts may be isolated and purified as their hydrates, solvates or crystalline polymorphic<br>
substances. The isolation and purification may be attained through ordinary chemical<br>
treatment of extraction, concentration, evaporation, crystallization, filtration,<br>
recrystallization, chromatography.<br>
Various isomers may be isolated by selecting suitable starting compounds, or by<br>
separating them based on the difference between the isomers in the physical or chemical<br>
properties thereof. For example, optical isomers may be led into stereochemically-pure<br>
isomers by selecting suitable starting compounds or by racemic resolution of racemic<br>
compounds (for example, leading them into diastereomer salts with ordinary opticallyactive<br>
acid for optical resolution).<br>
[0039]<br>
The NMDA receptor antagonistic activity of the compounds of the present<br>
invention was confirmed by the following test methods.<br>
I . J0K-801 binding test:<br>
1) Preparation of Specimens of Rat Meninges:<br>
The whole brain was taken out from 10-week-age SD rats (30 heads, by Nippon<br>
SLC), and the cerebellum was removed from it. A 0.32 M sucrose solution was added to<br>
the part containing the cerebrum, cut in a mixer, and homogenized with a Teflon<br>
homogenizer. This was centrifuged at 2800 rpm and 4°C for 15 minutes, and the resulting<br>
supernatant was again centrifuged at 15000 g and 4°C for 20 minutes. The pellets were<br>
suspended in 50 mM Tris-HCL (pH 7.5) containing 0.08% Triton X-100, and kept statically<br>
on ice for 30 minutes, then centrifuged at 15000 g and 4°C for 20 minutes. The pellets<br>
were suspended hi 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) added thereto, and centrifuged at 15000 g and<br>
4°C for 20 minutes. 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) was again added to the pellets, and<br>
centrifuged in the same manner as before. The pellets were suspended in 20 ml of 50 mM<br>
Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) added thereto, and homogenized with a Teflon™ homogenizer. The<br>
membrane specimen was divided into small tubes and stored in a deep freezer (-80°C).<br>
Before use, this was washed twice with 5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) of five times that of the<br>
membrane specimen. Its concentration was controlled at 1 mg protein/ml with 5 mM<br>
Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) added to it, and this was used for assay.<br>
2) )[3H]MK-801-binding Assay:<br>
50 ul of the rat membrane specimen (1 mg protein/ml) was added to a solution of<br>
a test compound dissolved in 1 ul of DMSO. Then, 50 ul of a ligand solution (600 nM<br>
glutamate, 600 nM glycine, 8 nM [3H] MK-801 (by Perkin-Elmer) was added to it and well<br>
stirred, and reacted at room temperature for 45 minutes. Using Uni Filter Plate GF/B 96<br>
(by Perkin-Elmer) previously coated with 0.2% polyethyleneimine, the membrane<br>
specimen was collected, and the filter was well washed with 5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). 30<br>
ul of Microscinti 20 (by Perkin-Elmer) was added to the filter, and the radioactivity trapped<br>
by the filter was determined by a microplate scintillation counter (TopCount™, by<br>
Beckman). Based on the MK-801 (final 1 uM) inhibition, 100%, of a control case of<br>
DMSO alone, the concentration of the compound for 50% inhibition, IC50 was computed.<br>
Th^HJMK-SOl binding affinity for the rat membrane specimen was obtained through<br>
Scatchard analysis and Kd = 1.6 nM. The Ki value of the compound was computed<br>
according to the calculation equation: Ki = ICso/(l + radioligand concentration (4 nM) in<br>
assay)/Kd value (1.6 nM)).<br>
As a result, the compounds of the present invention exhibited good NMD A<br>
receptor affinity. The Ki value of the NMD A receptor affinity of some typical compounds<br>
of the present invention is shown in Table 1 below.<br>

monohydrochloride monohydrate, 0.02% bovine serum albumin, 0.5% glucose,<br>
Ca2+ Mg2+-free PBS), and processed at 37°C for 15 minutes. This was centrifuged at 400<br>
PuJgr 5 minutes, and the supernatant was removed by suction. This was suspended in a<br>
neurocyte culture medium (by Sumitomo Bakelite), and the cell masses were removed by<br>
filtration. The number of the living cells was counted, and 100,000 cells/well were<br>
incubated on a 96-well plate (Biocoat PDL96W black/clear, by Nippon Becton Dickinson)<br>

mg) 6-methoxy-2,2-dimethyl-1 -(1 -methylpiperidin-4-yl)-7-nitro-1,2,3,4-<br>
tetrahydronaphthalen-1 -ol and 6-methoxy-2,2-dimethyl-1 -(1 -methylpiperidin-4-yl)-5-nitro-<br>
1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalen-l-ol that had been obtained through nitration of the compound<br>
of Example 55 in the same manner as in Example 158, followed by stirring in a hydrogen<br>
atmosphere (1 atmospheric pressure) at room temperature for 6 hours. After completion<br>
of the reaction, the insoluble matter was removed by filtration using Celite, and the solvent<br>
was evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica gel column<br>
chromatography (eluent: chloroform/MeOH/aqueous saturated ammonia = 10/1/0.1 to<br>
obtain the compound (167 mg) of Example 159 and the compound (230 mg) of Example<br>
160^ amorphous substances. (The formation of the compound of Example 160 would<br>
result from the residual acetic anhydride in the starting compound.)<br>
In Example 161, the compound shown in Table 40 was produced in the same<br>
manner as in Example 126 but from the compound of Example 159.<br>
