HARDWARE-EFFICIENT TRANSCEIVER WITH DELTA-SIGMA DIGITAL-TO-ANALOG CONVERTER<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
I,	Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to communications systems. Specifically, the present invention relates to transceivers used in communications networks.<br>
II.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Cellular telecommunications systems are characterized bv a plurality or" mobile transceivers in communication with one or more base stations. Each transceiver includes a transmitter and a receiver.<br>
In a typical transceiver, an analog radio frequency (RF) input signal, received by an antenna, is downconverted by an RF section to an intermediate frequency (IF). Signal processing circuits perform noise filtering and adjust the magnitude of the signal via analog automatic gain control (AGC) circuitry. An IF section then mixes the signal down to baseband and converts the analog signal to a digital signal. The digital signal is then input to a baseband processor for further signal processing to output voice or data.<br>
Similarly, the transmitter receives a digital input from the baseband processor and converts the input to an analog signal This signal is then filtered and upconverted by an IF stage to an intermediate frequency. The gain of the transmit signal is adjusted and the IF signal is upconverted to RF in preparation for radio transmission.<br>
In both the transmit and receive sections, signal gain adjustment and mixing is typically performed in the analog domain. This necessitates the use of a plurality of local oscillators (LOs) for signal downconversion, upconversion, and mixing. Analog local oscillators tend to be bulkv and require the use of one or more phase-locked loops. As is well known in the art,   phase-locked   loops   are  large,   expensive   circuits   that   consume    a<br><br>
considerable amount of power. Hence the use of PLLs, drive up the cos., size and power consumption of analog local oscillators and the transceivers in which these circuits are employed.<br>
Hence, a need  exists in  the  art for a cost-effective,  space-efficient transceiver with low noise characteristics and minimal power consumption.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The need in the art is addressed by the transceiver of the present invention. The inventive transceiver includes a dieital circuit for converting baseband signals to intermediate frequency signals. A signal source provides a rirst periodic signal of a first frequency. A direct digital synthesizer provides a second periodic signal of a second frequency from the first periodic reference signal An upconverter circuit digitally upconverts the baseband signals to digital intermediate frequency signals using the second periodic signal. A digital-to-analog converter converts the digital intermediate frequency signals to analog intermediate frequency signals using the first periodic signal<br>
In the transceiver implementation, the digital circit upconverts a first transmit signal from a first frequency to a second frequency in response to the second periodic signal and provides a digital transmit signal in response thereto. A second circuit is provided for converting the digital transmit signal to an analog transmit signal. Transmit and receive circuitry are provided for transmitting the analog transmit signal and receiving m analog receive signal respectively.<br>
In a specific embodiment, the analog receive signal is digitally downconverted to provide a digital receive signal in response to a second periodic signal A significant feature of the invention resides m the provision of the first and second periodic signals with a single local oscillator. A direct digital synthesizer is included for generating one of the reference signals from the output of the local oscillator.<br>
The transmit circuit includes a delta-sigma digital-to-analog converter having  the first periodic signal as an input.    The  delta-sigma  di^ital-to-<br><br>
analog converter has a low-bit digital-to-anaiog converter and a delta-sigma modulator.<br>
In the illustrative embodiment, the low-bit digital-to-analog converter is a 1-bit digital-to-analog converter and the delta-sigma modulator is a sixth order delta-sigma modulator. The delta-sigma modulator includes amplifiers with approximately the following gains: 3/2,<br>
-3/4,1/8.<br>
The transmit circuit includes a digital automatic gain control circuit tor adjusting the gain or the first signal An output oi the automatic gain control circuit is input to the delta-sigma digital-io-analGg converter. Also, a digital lowpass filter, a digital mixer, and 3 digital adder are included in the transmit circuit. An output of the digital adder provides an input to the automatic gam control circuit.<br>
The novel design of the present invention is facilitated by the elimination of a local oscillator via the use oi the direct digital synthesizer and the delta-sigma digital-to-analog converter. By eliminating a locai oscillator, power and space savings are achieved.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED<br>
EMBODIMENTS<br>
While the present invention is described herein with reference to illustrative embodiments for particular applications, it should be understood that the invention is not limited thereto. Those having ordinary skill in the art and access to the teachings provided herein will recognize additional modifications, applications, and embodiments within the scope thereof and additional fields in which the present invention would be of significant utility.<br>
The following review of a traditional transceiver is intended to facilitate an understanding of the present invention.<br>
FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a prior art transceiver 20. The transceiver 20 is a dual conversion telecommunications transceiver and includes an antenna 21 for receiving and transmitting RF signals. A duplexer 22 connected to the antenna 21 facilitates the separation of receive RF signals 24 from transmit RF signals 26.<br>
The receive RF signals 24 enter a receive circuit mat includes a receive RF amplifier 28, an RF-toTF mixer 30, a receive bandpass filter 32, an analog receive automatic gain control (AGC) circuit 34, and an analog IF-to-baseband processing circuit 36. The receive RF signals 24 are amplified by the receive amplifier 28, mixed to intermediate frequencies via the RF-to-IF mixer 30, altered by the receive bandpass filter 32, gain-adjusted by the receive AGC 34, and then converted to digital baseband signals 4S via the analog IF-to-baseband processing circuit 36. The digital baseband signals 48 are then input to a digital baseband processor 46.<br>
The RF transmit signals 26 arrive at the duplexer 2'2 from a transmit circuit that includes a transmit RF amplifier 38, an IF-to-RF mixer 40, a transmit bandpass filter 42, and analog baseband-to-IF processing circuit 44. Digital baseband processor output signals 50 are received by the analog baseband-to-IF processing circuit 44 where they are converted to analog signals, mixed to IF signals that are then filtered by the transmit bandpass filter 42, mixed up to RF by the IF-to-RF mixer 40, amplified by the transmit amplifier 38 and then transmitted via the duplexer 22 and the antenna 21.<br><br>
Both receive and transmit circuits are connected to the digital baseband processor 46 that processes the received baseband digital signals 48 and outputs the digital baseband processor output signals 50. The baseband processor 46 may include such functions as signal to voice conversions and/or vise versa.<br>
The baseband processor output signals 50 are 90° out of phase with respect to each other and correspond to in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) signals. The output signals 50 are input to digital-to-analog converters (DACs) 52 in the analog baseband-to-IF processing circuit 44 where thev are converted to analog signals that are then filtered by lowpass filters 54 in preparation for mixing. The signals' phases are adjusted, mixed, and summed via a 90° shifter 56, baseband-to-IF mixers 58, and adder 60,, respectively. The adder 60 outputs IT signals 62 that are input to an analog transmit automatic gam control (AGC) circuit 64 where the gain of the mixed IF signals 62 is adjusted in preparation for filtering via the transmit bandpass filter 42, mixing up to RF via the IF-to-transmit mixer 40, amplifying via the transmit amplifier 38, and eventual radio transmission via the duplexer 22 and the antenna 21,<br>
The DACs 52 in the baseband-to-IF processing circuit 44 are clocked bv a first local oscillator (LOl) 66. The sampling rate of the DACs 52 is determined by the frequency of the local oscillator 66. The local oscillator 66 also provides the clock signal to the analog IF-to-baseband processing circuit 36, which is used by analog-to-digital converters (ADC) 68 in the analog IF-to-baseband processing circuit 36-<br>
A second local oscillator (L02) 70 is required by the mixers 58 in the<br>
analog-to-baseband processing circuit 44,    The  second local oscillator 70<br>
» outputs a clock signal having a different frequency than the output of the<br>
first local oscillator 66.  Typically, the second local oscillator 70 operates at a much higher frequency than the first local oscillator 66.<br>
A third local oscillator 72 is required for the operation of the receive RF-to-DF mixer 30 and the transmit IF-to-RF mixer 40. Typically the same local oscillator 72 is used for both mixers 30, 40.<br><br>
A fourth local oscillator 73 is used by an analog mixing circuit 75 in the analog IF-to-Baseband circuit 36 to facilitate IF-to-baseband processing functions performed by the analog mixing circuit 75.<br>
All of the local oscillators 66, 70, 72, 73 require one or more phase-locked loops (PLLs).   PLLs are typically large analog circuits that consume excess power-Design limitations of the transceiver 20 limit  the amount oi signal processing that can be performed in the digital domain, and require the use of additional large analog power-consuming circuits such as local oscillators and analog AGCs.   For example, the multi-bit DACs 52 are implemented before the analog signal mixing and filtering performed by the baseband-to-iF-processing circuit £4,  This is partly because the DACs 52 would generate an extraordinary amount of spurious noise if they were implemented  after mixing.   This is because the IF signals 62 are higher frequency signais that magnify converter glitches thereby increasing spurious noise.   The spurious noise is typically in-band and is difficult to filter via conventional means.<br>
Since the digital-to-analog conversion must take place bexore baseband-to-IF conversion by the circuit 44, the baseband-ro-IF processing circuit 44 must be implemented in the analog domain. The analog mixers 58, filters 54, adder 60, and the analog AGC 64 are much larger and consume more power than their digital counterparts. Furthermore, imbalances due to low precision oi analog circuits causes feedthrough of the oscillator signal 70, which cannot be filtered by practical means.<br>
In addition, the design of the transceiver 20 necessitates the use of at least three local oscillators, i.e., the first local oscillator 66, the second local oscillator 70 and the third local oscillator 72. The oscillators 66, 70, and 72 include large, power-inefficient analog PLLs.<br>
FIG, 2 is a block diagram of a transceiver 80 constructed in accordance with the teachings of the present invention.   The transceiver SO employs a<br>
delta-sigma (AS) digital-to-analog converter  (DAC) 32 and a direct digital<br>
synthesizer (DDS) 84. In the transceiver 80, the analog baseband-to-IF processing circuit 44 of FIG, 1 and the analog IF-to-baseband processing circuit 36 of FIG. 1 are replaced with a re-designed baseband-fco-IF processing<br><br>
circuit 86, and re-designed IF-to-baseband processing circuit 88, respectively. The replacements eliminate the need for the second local oscillator 70 of FIG. 1, greatlv reducing transceiver power consumption and size.<br>
The  AX DAC 82 can convert. digital IF signals   to  analog  signals<br>
without tiie spurious noise problems of a multi-bit DAC,  By employing the<br>
IA DAC 82, baseband-to-IF signal processing may be performed in the digital<br>
domain., thus eliminating oscillator feed through.<br>
The digital baseband-to-IF processing circuit 86 includes a first digital lowpass filter 90 and a second digital lowpass filter 92 that filter undesirable signals such as noise from quadrature (Q) 94 and m-phase (I) 96 signals received from the baseband processor 46, respectively. The filtered in-phase signals are input to a first digital mixer 98, while the filtered quadrature signals are input to a second digital mixer 100. The first mixer 98 is clocked by a DDS clock signal 102 from the DDS 84. The DDS clock signal 102 is shifted in phase by 90° by a digital phase shifter 106, providing a shifted clock signal 104 in response thereto. By clocking the mixers 98, 100 with clock signals that are 90° out of phase, the I and Q. signals are brought in phase. The mixers 98, 100 convert the I and Q signals to IF signals that are combined via a digital adder 108. The added IF signals are then output to a digital AGC 110, the construction of which is well known in the art The digital AGC 110 adjusts the gain of the IF signals and outputs these signals to<br>
the AI DAC 82. The AI DAC 82 converts these signals to analog signals in<br>
preparation for more filtering by the bandpass filter 42, mixing up to radio frequencies by the mixer 40, amplifying by the amplifier 38 and transmitting via the dup lexer 22 and the antenna 21.<br>
The AZ DAC 82 utilizes an oscillator signal 112 generated by a single<br>
local oscillator 114 to drive a 1-bit DAC included in the Al DAC 82 (as discussed more fully below). The oscillator signal 112 is also used as a frequency control signal to drive the DDS S4 that synthesizes the DDS clock signal 102. The DDS clock signal 102 has a different frequency than the oscillator signal 112.<br><br>
The DDS 84 produces a digitized sinusoidal signal corresponding to the clock signal 102 from the oscillator signal 112 by accumulating phase increments of the digitized sinusoidal signal 102 at the higher rate of the oscillator signal 112. The accumulated phase is converted to the digitized sinusoidal signal 102 via a look-up table (not shown). The digitized sinusoidal signal 102 is used as a frequency reference by the mixers 98, 100 to translate the baseband signals 94, 96 to IF.<br>
Construction of the DDS 84 is known in the art and described in U.S. Patent No. 4,965,533, entitled DIRECT DIGITAL SYNTHESIZER DRIVEN PHASE LOCK LOOP FREQUENCY SYNTHESIZER, assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Those skilled in the art will'appreciate that the DDS 84 may be implemented as a programmable DDS whose output clock signal 102 is adjustable in response to transmission or reception errors due to oscillator frequency drift and/or other related errors. Such error measurements may be detected by logic in the baseband processor 4b or via additional error detection circuits (not shown).<br>
Use oi the DDS 84 to generate the DDS clock signal 102 eliminates the need for an additional local oscillator with an additional PLL. The DDS 84 is much smaller than a local oscillator and PLL and may be readily implemented in a compact very large scale integration (VLSI) circuit along<br>
with the digital mixers 98, 100, filters 90, 92, adder, 108, AGC 110, and AE DAC 82. In addition, the DDS 84 consumes relatively small amounts of power. Also, use of the low noise AI DAC 82 eliminates the need tor an additional multi-bit DAC as is required in the transceiver 20 of FIG. 1.<br>
With reference to FIGS'. 1 and 2, the separate PLL oscillator 70 required in the conventional transceiver 20 for baseband-to-IF conversion is replaced, in the transceiver 80 of the present invention by the digital DDS 84. The performance of the baseband-to-IF processing circuit 44 of FIG. 1 is improved upon, in the present invention. In the present invention, analog processing functions are implemented in digital circuits and the spurious multi-bit DACs 52 are replaced with the 1-bit sigma-delta DAC 82.<br><br>
processing functions are implemented in digital circuits and the spurious multi-bit DACs 52 arc replaced with  the 1-bit sigma-delta DAC 82.<br>
In the present specific embodiment, the oscillator Signal 112 is also used to clock a digital IF-to-baseband processing circuit S3 in the receive circuit.    In the present  specific  embodiment,   the  digital IF-to-baseband<br>
processing circuit 88 that includes a high-speed AI analog-to-digitai converter (ADC) 116, a digital mixing circuit 117, and a frequency multiplier for  converting   the   frequency  of  the   oscillator  signal   112  to   a   second<br>
frequency for use by the AI ADC 116,  The construction oi AX ADCs, digital<br>
mixing circuits, and frequency multipliers is well known in the art.<br>
In the present embodiment, the frequency multiplier 117 divides the freauencv (Fs) of the oscillator signal 112 by four and provides the resulting divided oscillator signal as a clock to a 1-bit ADC (not shown) included in<br>
the AS ADC 116.<br>
The oscillator signal 112 provides a reference frequency to the digital mixing circuit 117 for use by the digital mixing circuit 117 to downconvert<br>
digital IF signals output from the A£ ADC 116 to the baseband signals 48.<br>
Those skilled in the art will appreciate that digital downconversion functions performed in the digital IF-to-baseband processing circuit 88 may be implemented in a manner similar to up-conversion functions performed in the digital baseband-to-IF processing circuit 86.  Also, the analog AGC 34<br>
may be implemented as a digital AGC after the Zl ADC 116 in the digital IF-to-baseband circuit 8S.<br>
Construction of the receive circuit may be implemented in accordance with the teachings oi U.S. Patent Application Serial No. OS/987.,306, filed on December 9, 1997, entitled RECEIVER WITH DELTA-SIGMA ANALOC-TO--DIGITAL CONVERTER, assigned, to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated by reference herein.<br>
Those skilled in the art will appreciate that digital IF-to-baseband processing circuit 86 may be replaced with a different version, such as the analog IF-to-baseband processing circuit 36 oi FIG. 1 without departing from the scope of the present invention.  Also, the DDS 84 of the digital baseband-<br><br>
to-IF processing circuit 86 may be implemented in the IF-to-baseband processing circuit 88 in addition to or instead of being implemented in the digital baseband-to-IF processing circuit 86. That is, the DDS output 102 may be used bv downconvsrsion circuitry and/or ADCs in the IF-to-baseband processing circuit 88.  In addition, the AGC circuit 110 may be implemented<br>
m the analog domain after the Al DAC 82 without departing from the scope<br>
of the present invention.<br>
FIG. 3 is a block diagram of the AS DAC 32 of FIG. 2, The AI DAC 82<br>
includes a 1-bit DAC 120 at the output of a AI modulator 122    The AI<br>
modulator 122 is a sixth order AI modulator.   The AX modulator  32 has<br>
three basic building blocks 124, also termed second order resonators, cascaded together.   Each basic building block 124 includes a combination of<br>
digital delays (z"'J 128, amplifiers 130 having voltage gains c^ (where i is an integer index ranging from 0 to 5), an adder 132, and a subtractor 134. The adder 132 receives as parallel inputs, outputs from the amplifiers 130- One of the amplifiers 130 has an input provided by a digital delay 12S whose input is also the input of the other amplifier 130. This input is provided by a digital delay 128 m a subsequent resonator 124, or, in the case of the output<br>
basic block 124, provided by the noise-shaped output 127 of the AI modulator S2.<br>
The first basic building block 124 receives the output of the digital AGC 110 of FIG, 2 as a third input to the adder 132. Subsequent building blocks 124 receive outputs of the previous basic building blocks 124 as third inputs to the adders 132.<br>
Those skilled in the art will appreciate that methods for constructing the basic building blocks 124 are well known in the art and may be implemented using programmable gate arrays.<br>
The output of the adder 132 provides an input to the subtractor 134. The output of the adder 132 is sent through a digital delay 128, providing the output of the resonator 124, The output of the resonator 124 is sent through another digital delay 128 and provides a second input to the adder 132 forming a feedback loop.<br><br>
Quantization  noise  is modeled as a linear noise  element   126 and occurs before the noise shaped output 127.<br>
The voltage gains of the amplifiers 130 are picked to provide a noise<br>
transfer function and signal transfer function that enable the Al modulator 82 to meet stability noise shaping requirements tor a particular application Methods for picking of the gains a for the amplifiers 130 are well known in the art.  In the present specific embodiment, the gains are: a0= 0, a, - 3/2, a-<br>
- 0, a3 - -3/4, a4 = 0, a5 = 1/8.<br>
The 1-bit DAC 120 is clocked by the oscillator signal LI2 of FIG. 2, Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the 1-bit DAC 120 may be replaced by a low-bit DAC such as a 2 or 3 bit DAC without departing from the scope of the present invention. The constructions or sigma-deita DACs and ADCs are well known in the art.<br>
Thus, the present invention has been described herein with reference to a particular embodiment for a particular application. Those having ordinary skill in the art and access to the present teachings will recognize additional modifications, applications and embodiments within the scope thereof.<br>
