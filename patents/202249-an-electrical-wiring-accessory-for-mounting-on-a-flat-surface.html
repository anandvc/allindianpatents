This invention relates to an electrical wiring accessory rnountable on a flat surface. The electrical wiring accessory comprising a front plate with one or more devices such as actuators, connectors, socket outlets, fan controllers, light controllers, indicators and combinations of these are within the scope of this invention.<br>
In particular, the invention relates to electncal wiring accessories, which are intended to be fixed on a flat surface of enclosures or plates or walls by means of screws.<br>
In the prior art, recesses are sometimes provided on the electrical wiring accessories of similar type in which the heads of the fixing screws are accommodated. The purpose of providing the recesses for the heads are multifold. It protects against inadvertent human contact and consequent injury against shock if metallic screws accidentally acquire an electric potential. It also improves the visual appearance. In the known art, the recesses are sometimes provided with individual covers, to close trie recesses after the fixing screws are tightened. The purpose for providing the recesses covers include protection against ingress of insects which might otherwise nest in the recesses, protection against accumulation of dirt in the recesses, and to further improve the visual appearance.<br>
2<br><br>
The disadvantage of the recess in the existing electrical wiring accessories which are in use at present, are that they are held by friction and can easily get detached. They also have the disadvantage that once they are placed in position to cover the recesses, they have to be detached to access the fixing screws again for maintenance or changes in the installation. There is also the disadvantage that recess covers are small parts and they may be easily dropped and lost.<br>
The invention provides an electrical wiring accessory with means to attach a recess cover by a means other than friction, so as to eliminate the need to detach the recess cover for initial installation, or subsequent maintenance. A feature of the invention is that the opening of the recess cover is by pushing with a finger or a blunt instrument on the front of the recess cover, instead of pulling with a sharp instrument inserted between the recess cover and the surface of the accessory where it seats. This reduces the likelihood of damage to the recess cover or the accessory. The electrical accessory according to the invention is provided with a swiveling movement of the recess cover about a hinge concealed behind the recess cover. By pushing one end of the recess cover from outside the recess cover swivels to an open position for inserting and tightening or loosening and withdrawing the fixing screws.     By<br>
3<br><br>
pushing at the other end of the recess cover, it swivels to a position to close the recess.<br>
Thus the invention provides an electrical wiring accessory for mounting on a flat surface comprising a front plate with one or more devices such as actuators, connectors, socket outlets, fan controllers, light controllers, indicators characterised by at least one recess for accommodating head of a fixing screw for fixing the said front plate on a flat surface, and a recess cover provided with a hinge means on the side facing the fixing screw for rotatably mounting in the said recess so that the surface of the recess cover is aligned to the surface of the front plate.<br>
A prefered embodiment of the electrical wiring accessory according to the invention is described with reference to the accompanying drawings :<br>
Rgure 1 shows a preferred electrical accessory according to the invention.<br>
Figure 2 shows a sectional view of the electrical accessory shown in figure 1 with the recess cover in open position.<br>
*<br>
4<br><br>
Figure 3 shows the sectional view of the electrical accessory shown in figure 1 with the recess cover in closed position.<br>
The inventive features of a prefered electrical wiring accessory according to the invention is clearly depicted in the accompanying drawings. The electrical wiring accessory according to the invention comprises a front plate (1) with one or more devices such as actuators, connectors, socket outlets, fan controllers, light controllers and indicators mounted thereon. The front plate (1) is provided one or more fixing screws (3) to mount the front plate (1) on a flat surface. Each screw (3) is provided in a recess (2) on the front plate (1) which accommodate the screw head. A recess cover (4) with a hinge means (5) on the side facing the screw head is provided to cover the recess (2).<br>
The recess cover (4) is capable of rotory motion about the hinge means (5). The hinge means may have hinge pins integrally made with the recess cover (4) which engages in hinge pin sockets provided on the opposite side walls in the recess (3). Alternately the hinge pins may be provided on the opposite side walls of the recess and hinge sockets to accommodate the said hinge pins may be provided on the recess cover (4). In both cases the hinge pins are engaged with hinge sockets by making use of the resilience of the<br>
5<br><br>
material with which tine recess cover is made. In general plastic materials used in manufacturing the electrical accessory have the required resilience.<br>
The electrical wiring accessory according to the invention may be provided with required number of recess at appropriate locations depending upon the requirement of die number of fixing screws and their locations. The number of fixing screws will generally depend upon the size of the front plate required for a particular electrical accessory.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the electrical wiring accessory according to the invention a shoulder (6) is provided in the recess on the side opposite to the side nearer to the hinge means (5) to stop the recess cover and align it with tine surface of the front plate (1) when the recess cover is in closed position.<br>
Though the recess and recess cover shown in the preferred embodiment in figures 1 to 3 are rectangular, they may have any shape such as circular, oval or polygonal.<br>
6<br><br><br>
WE CLAIM  :<br>
1.	An electrical wiring accessory for mounting on a flat surface comprising a front plate (1) with with one or more devices such as actuators, connectors, socket outlets, fan controllers, light controllers and indicators characterised by at least one recess (2) for accommodating head of a fixing screw (3) for fixing the said front plate on a flat surface, and a recess cover (4) provided with a hinge means (5) on the side facing the fixing screw for rotatably mounting in the said recess so that the surface of the recess cover is aligned to the surface of the front plate.<br>
2.	An electrical wiring accessory as claimed in claim 1 wherein two recesses are provided symmetrically on the front plate to accommodate two fixing screws.<br>
3.	An electrical wiring accessory as claimed in claim 1 wherein the front plate is rectangular and four recesses are provided at four corners of the front plate to accommodate four fixing screws.<br>
4.	An electrical wiring accessory as claimed in any one of the claims 1 to 3, wherein in the said recess (2), a shoulder (6) is<br><br><br>
provided on the side opposite to the side nearer to the hinge means (5) to stop the recess cover in alignment with the surface of the front plate.<br>
5.	An electrical wiring accessory as claimed in any one of the<br>
claims 1 to 4 wherein the hinge means (5) comprises hinge<br>
pins integral with the recess cover(4) and the ends of the<br>
hinge pins being engaged in matching hinge pin sockets<br>
provided on opposite sides of the recess to fit the recess cover.<br>
6.	An electrical wiring accessory as claimed in anyone of the<br>
claims 1 to 4 wherein the hinge means (5) comprises hinge pin<br>
sockets integral with the recess cover (4) and hinge pins are<br>
