				<td>The present invention relates to magnesium dichloride/alcohol adducts which<br>
are characterized by particular chemical and physical properties. The adducts<br>
of the present invention are particularly useful as precursors of catalyst<br>
components for the polymerization of olefins.<br>
In our co-pending application no. 523/CAL/98 from which this application has<br>
been divided out, we described and claimed a process for the preparation of<br>
Magnesium dichlolide-alchol adducts.<br>
MgCI2•alcohol adducts and their use in the preparation of catalyst components<br>
for the polymerization of olefins are well known in the art.<br>
J.C.J. Bart and W. Roovers [Journal of Material Science, 30 (1995), 2809-<br>
2820] describe the preparation of a number of MgCI2•nEtOH adducts, with n<br>
ranging from 1.4 to 6, and their characterization by means of X-ray powder<br>
diffraction. A range of allegedly new adducts, with n=6, 4.5, 4, 3.33, 2.5,<br>
1.67, 1.50 and 1.25, is characterized in terms of X-ray diffraction pattern.<br>
According to the authors, the MgCI2•alcohol adducts can be converted to<br>
active polymerization catalyst supports through the elimination of the alcohol<br>
molecules from the adducts by thermal desolvation. In table III of the article,<br>
the characteristic diffraction lines of the above indicated new adducts are<br>
reported with reference to the interplanar distances. For convenience,<br>
the same diffraction lines are reported below with reference to the 20<br>
diffraction angles, limitatedly to the range of 26 diffraction angles<br>
between 5° and 15° (the relative intensity I/I0 with respect to the<br>
most intense diffraction line is reported in brackets). For n = 1.25:<br><br>
2θ=7.6° (100), 12.28° (25), 14.9° (8); for n=1.5: 2θ=8.44<br>
(100), 11.95 (48), 14.2 (46); for n=1.67: 2θ=6.1° (9), 6.68°<br>
(100), 8.95° (50), 9.88° (33), 11.8° (8), 12.28° (33), 14.5°<br>
(13), 14.75° (4); for n=2.5: 2θ=6.3 (27), 9.4° (100), 9.93°<br>
(70), 11.7° (11), 12.35° (6), 14.9° (6); for n=3.33: 2θ=9.14°<br>
(15), 9.44° (100), 11.88° (15), 12.9° (27); for n=4: 2θ=8.7°<br>
(49), 10.1° (73), 10.49° (100), 11.8° (58); f or n=4.5: 2θ=9.65°<br>
(100), 11.4° (10), 12.5° (24), 12.94° (32), 14.25° (20), 14.95°<br>
(6); for n=6: 2θ=8.94° (100), 13.13° (3). A MgCl2•2EtOH•0. 5H2O<br>
adduct is also reported, the diffraction lines of which in the<br>
relevant range are the following: 2θ=7.9° (35); 8.5° (&gt;100);<br>
9.7° (26); 11.32° (100); 12.59° (11); 13.46° (12).<br>
Catalyst components for the polymerization of olefins, obtained<br>
by reacting MgCl2•nEtOH adducts with halogenated transition<br>
metal compounds, are described in USP 4,3 99,054. The adducts<br>
are prepared by emulsifying the molten adduct in an immiscible<br>
dispersing medium and quenching the emulsion in a cooling fluid<br>
to collect the adduct in the form of spherical particles. No X-<br>
ray characteristics of the adducts are reported.<br>
USP 4,421,674 describes a method for preparing a catalyst<br>
component for the polymerization of olefins which involves the<br>
preparation of MgCl2•EtOH adducts by means of the following<br>
steps: (a) preparation of a MgCl. solution in ethanol; (b)<br>
spray-drying said solution to collect particles of the adduct<br>
in spherical form, said adduct having from 1.5 to 20% by weight<br><br>
of residual alcoholic hydroxyl content and being characterized<br>
by an X-ray spectrum in which the maximum peak at 2.56 (i.e.<br>
2θ=3 5°) characteristics of the crystalline anhydrous MgCl2 is<br>
practically absent and a new maximum peak at about 10.8 <br>
(i.e. 2θ=8.15°) is present; lesser peaks at about 9.16 (i.e.<br>
2θ=9.65°) and 6.73 (i.e. 2θ=13.15°) are also reported.<br>
EP-A-700936 describes a process for producing a solid catalyst<br>
component for the polymerization of olefins which comprises the<br>
preparation of MgCl2•EtOH adducts by means of the following<br>
steps: (A) preparation of a mixture having formula MgCl2•mROH,<br>
wherein R is an alkyl group with 1 to 10 carbon atoms and m=3.0<br>
to 6.0; (B) spray-cooling said mixture to obtain a solid adduct<br>
having the same composition as of the starting mixture; (C)<br>
partly removing the alcohol from the above-obtained solid<br>
adduct to obtain an adduct containing from 0.4 to 2.8 mol of<br>
alcohol per mol of MgCl2. The adduct obtained in (C) is<br>
characterized by an X-ray diffraction spectrum in which a novel<br>
peak does not occur at a diffraction angles 2θ= 7 to 8° as<br>
compared with the diffraction spectrum of the adduct obtained<br>
in (B) , or even if it occurs, the intensity of the novel peak<br>
is 2.0 times or less the intensity of the highest peak present<br>
at the diffraction angles 2θ=8.5 to 9° of the diffraction<br>
spectrum of the adduct obtained in (C) . Fig. 2 of the said<br>
European Patent Application shows a typical. X-ray diffraction<br>
spectrum of the adducts prepared in (B). The highest peak<br><br>
occurs at 2θ=8.8°; two less intense peaks occur at 2θ=9.5 to<br>
10° and 20=13°, respectively. Fig. 3 shows a typical X-ray<br>
diffraction spectrum of the adducts prepared in (C) . The<br>
highest peak occurs at 2θ=8.8°; other peaks occur at 2θ=6.0 to<br>
6.5°, 2θ=9.5 to 10° and 2θ=11 to 11.5°. Fig. 4 shows a typical<br>
X-ray diffraction spectrum of comparative adducts prepared in<br>
(C) . The highest peak occurs at 20=7.6°; other peaks occur at<br>
2θ=8.8°, 2θ=9.5 to 10°, 2θ=11 to 11.5° and 2θ=12 to 12.5°.<br>
A new MgCl2•alcohol adduct has now been found which is<br>
characterized by a particular X-ray diffraction spectrum, not<br>
shown by the adducts of the prior art, and/or by a particular<br>
crystallinity as shown by the Differential Scanning Calorimetry<br>
(DSC) profile of the adduct. In addition, particular<br>
MgCl2•alcohol adducts of the present invention can be<br>
characterized by their viscosity values in the molten state<br>
which, for a given alcohol content, are higher than the<br>
viscosity values of the corresponding adducts of the prior art.<br>
In addition to the alcohol, minor amounts of water can also be<br>
present in the adducts according to the invention.<br>
The adducts of the present invention can be used to prepare<br>
catalyst components for the polymerization of olefins by<br>
reaction with transition metal compounds. Catalyst components<br>
obtained from the adducts of the present invention are capable<br>
to give catalysts for the polymerization of olefins<br>
characterized by enhanced activity and stereospecificity with<br><br>
respect to the catalysts prepared from the adducts of the prior<br>
art. Also, the morphological properties of the obtained<br>
polymers are improved, particularly when adducts in spherical<br>
forms are used.<br>
The present invention therefore relates to MgCl2•mROH•nH2O<br>
adducts, where R is a C1-C10 alkyl, 2≤m≤4.2, 0≤n≤0.7,<br>
characterized by an X-ray diffraction spectrum in which, in the<br>
range of 29 diffraction angles between 5° and 15°, the three<br>
main diffraction lines are present at diffraction angles 20 of<br>
8.8 ± 0.2°, 9.4 ± 0.2° and 9.8 ± 0.2°, the most intense dif-<br>
fraction lines being the one at 2θ=8.8 ± 0.2°, the intensity of<br>
the other two diffraction lines being at least 0.2 times the<br>
intensity of the most intense diffraction line.<br>
The above described diffraction pattern is unique and it has<br>
never been described in the prior art. In fact, none of the<br>
spectra reported in Bart et al. corresponds to the spectrum<br>
which characterizes the adducts of the present invention; the<br>
same applies to the adducts disclosed in EP-A-700936. As for<br>
the adducts described in USP 4,399,054, applicants repeated the<br>
preparation of the adducts according to the procedure described<br>
therein. The X-ray diffraction spectrum of the obtained adduct<br>
shows, in the range of 29 diffraction angles between 5 and 15°,<br>
the following main peaks (the relative intensity I/I, with<br>
respect to the most intense diffraction line is in brackets):<br>
2θ=8.84° (79); 2θ=9.2 (100); 2θ=9.43 (68); 2θ=9.82 (19).<br><br>
Contrary to the adducts of the present invention, which are<br>
characterized, inter alia, by a most intense diffraction line<br>
occurring at 2θ=8.8 ± 0.2°, the adducts of USP 4,399,054 are<br>
characterized by a most intense diffraction line at 2θ=9.2°.<br>
Preferably R is a Cl-C4 alkyl, more preferably ethyl, m is<br>
between 2.2 and 3.8, more preferably between 2.5 and 3.5, n is<br>
between 0.01 and 0.6, more preferably between 0.001 and 0.4.<br>
The X-ray diffraction spectra are determined with reference to<br>
the main diffraction lines of silicon, used as an internal<br>
standard, using the apparatus and the methodology described<br>
hereinafter.<br>
The preferred adducts of the present invention are<br>
characterized by an X-ray diffraction spectrum in which the<br>
intensity of the diffraction lines at 2θ=9.4° ±0.2° and 9.8° ±<br>
0.2° is at least 0.4 times, preferably at least 0.5 times the<br>
intensity of the most intense diffraction line at 2θ=8.8° ±<br>
0.2°.<br>
As an alternative, or in addition to the X-ray spectrum, the<br>
adducts of the present invention are characterized by a<br>
Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) profile in which no<br>
peaks are present at temperatures below 90°C or, even if peaks<br>
are present below said temperature, the fusion enthalpy<br>
associated with said peaks is less than 30% of the total fusion<br>
enthalpy.<br><br>
The DSC analysis is carried out using the apparatus and the<br>
methodology described hereinafter.<br>
When R is ethyl, m is between 2.5 and 3.5 and n is between 0<br>
and 0.4, the fusion enthalpy associated with peaks possibly<br>
present at temperatures below 90°C is less than 10% of the<br>
total fusion enthalpy. In said case the adducts are furthermore<br>
characterized by the fact that the maximum peak occurs at<br>
temperatures between 95 and 115°C.<br>
Particularly preferred are adducts of the formula (I)<br>
MgCl2•mEtOH•nH2O (I)<br>
where m is between 2.2 and 3.8 and n is between 0.01 and 0.6,<br>
having both the above described X-ray spectrum and the above<br>
described DSC features. Adducts of this type can be further<br>
characterized by their viscosity in the molten state. In fact,<br>
it has been unexpectedly found that adducts with the above<br>
described features are also characterized by values of<br>
viscosity which, for a given alcohol content, are higher than<br>
the values of viscosity of the corresponding adducts of the<br>
prior art. In particular, on a plot viscosity vs. EtOH molar<br>
content, the values of viscosity at 115°C (expressed in poise)<br>
of the adducts (I) are above the straight line passing through<br>
the points having, respectively, a viscosity/EtOH molar content<br>
of 2.43/2.38 and 1.26/3.31; at 120° the values of viscosity of<br>
the adducts (I) are above the straight line defined by the<br>
points having viscosity/EtOH molar content values of 1.71/2.38<br><br>
and 0.9/3.31; at 125° the values of viscosity of the adducts<br>
(I) are above the straight line passing through the points<br>
defined by the viscosity/EtOH molar content values of 1.2/2.38<br>
and 0.63/3.31.<br>
The adducts of the present invention can be prepared with new<br>
methods, not disclosed in the prior art, which are<br>
characterized by particular modalities of reaction between<br>
MgCl2, alcohol, and optionally water.<br>
According to one of these methods MgCl2•pROH•qH2O adducts, where<br>
R is a C1-C10 alkyl, 1≤p≤6, 0≤n≤l, are prepared by dispersing<br>
the particles of magnesium dichloride in an inert liquid<br>
immiscible with and chemically inert to the molten adduct,<br>
heating the system at temperature equal to or higher than the<br>
melting temperature of MgCl2•alcohol adduct and then adding the<br>
desired amount of alcohol in vapour phase. The temperature is<br>
kept at values such that the adduct is completely melted.<br>
The molten adduct is then emulsified in a liquid medium which<br>
is immiscible with and chemically inert to it and then quenched<br>
by contacting the adduct with an inert cooling liquid, thereby<br>
obtaining the solidification of the adduct.<br>
The liquid in which the MgCl2 is dispersed can be any liquid<br>
immiscible with and chemically inert to the molten adduct. For<br>
example, aliphatic, aromatic or cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons can<br>
be used as well as silicone oils. Aliphatic hydrocarbons such<br>
as vaseline oil are particularly preferred. After the MgCl2<br><br>
particles are dispersed in the inert liquid, the mixture is<br>
heated at temperatures preferably higher than 125°C and more<br>
preferably at temperatures higher than 150°C. Conveniently, the<br>
vaporized alcohol is added at a temperature equal to or lower<br>
than the temperature of the mixture. Particularly preferred<br>
products obtainable with the above specified method are the<br>
adducts of formula MgCl2•mROH•nH2O, where R is a C1-C10 alkyl,<br>
2≤m≤4.2, 0≤n≤0.7, and characterized by the specified X-ray<br>
diffraction spectrum.<br>
According to another method, the adducts of the invention are<br>
prepared by contacting MgCl2 and alcohol in the absence of the<br>
inert liquid dispersant, heating the system at the melting<br>
temperature of MgCl2-alcohol adduct or above, and maintaining<br>
said conditions so as to obtain a completely melted adduct.<br>
Said molten adduct is then emulsified in a liquid medium which<br>
is immiscible with and chemically inert to it and finally<br>
quenched by contacting the adduct with an inert cooling liquid<br>
thereby obtaining the solidification of the adduct. In<br>
particular, the adduct is preferably kept at a temperature<br>
equal to or higher than its melting temperature, under stirring<br>
conditions, for a time period equal to or greater than 10<br>
hours, preferably from 10 to 150 hours, more preferably from 2 0<br>
to 100 hours. Alternatively, in order to obtain the<br>
solidification of the adduct, a spray-cooling process of the<br>
molten adduct can be carried out.<br><br>
The catalyst components obtained from the adducts obtained with<br>
the above described processes show still more improved<br>
properties over the catalyst components prepared by the adducts<br>
which have been obtained with the same preparation method but<br>
without having been maintained for the requested period of time<br>
under the described conditions.<br>
A further method for preparing MgCl2•pROH•qH2O adducts, where R<br>
is a C1-C10 alkyl, 2≤p≤6, 0≤n≤1, comprises reacting the MgCl2<br>
solid particles and vaporized alcohol in a loop reactor<br>
comprising a densified zone in which the particles flow in a<br>
densified form under the action of gravity and a fast<br>
fluidization zone where the particles flow under fast<br>
fluidization conditions. As it is known, the state of fast<br>
fluidization is obtained when the velocity of the fluidizing<br>
gas is higher than the transport velocity, and it is<br>
characterized in that the pressure gradient along the direction<br>
of transport is a monotonic function of the quantity of<br>
injected solid, for equal flow rate and density of the<br>
fluidizing gas. The terms transport velocity and fast<br>
fluidization state are well known in the art; for a definition<br>
thereof, see, for example, "D. Geldart, Gas Fluidization<br>
Technology, page 155 et seqq. , J.Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd., 1986". In<br>
the second polymerization zone, where the particles flows in a<br>
densified form under the action of gravity, high values of<br>
density of the solid are reached (density of the solid = kg of<br><br>
solid particles per m3 of reactor occupied), which approach the<br>
bulk density of the adduct; a positive gain in pressure can<br>
thus be obtained along the direction of flow, so that it<br>
becomes possible to reintroduce the solid particles into the<br>
fast fluidization zone without the help of special mechanical<br>
means. In this way, a "loop" circulation is set up, which is<br>
defined by the balance of pressures between the two zones of<br>
the reactor.<br>
In particular, the above method is suitable to prepare<br>
MgCl2•mROH•nH2O adducts, where R is a C1-C10 alkyl, 2≤m≤4.2, and<br>
0≤n≤0.7, characterized by the specified X-ray diffraction<br>
spectrum, carrying out the reaction between MgCl2 particles and<br>
vaporized alcohol in the loop reactor, under conditions such<br>
that the vapour pressure of the formed adduct is kept at values<br>
lower than 30 mmHg when operating atmospheric pressure.<br>
Preferably, the vapour pressure of the adduct is kept at values<br>
lower than 25 mmHg and more preferably in the range 10-20 mmHg.<br>
Preferably, the reaction between magnesium dichloride and<br>
alcohol is carried out in a loop reactor in which the fast<br>
fluidization is obtained by a flow of an inert gas, such as<br>
nitrogen. The particles of the formed adduct are preferably<br>
discharged from the densified zone. As mentioned above, the<br>
reaction between magnesium dichloride and alcohol must be<br>
carried out under conditions which allow a substantial control<br>
of the reaction in order to avoid problems such as melting of<br><br>
the adduct or its substantial dealcoholation. Therefore, the<br>
temperature within the reactor, and particularly in the zone<br>
where the vaporized alcohol is fed, must be carefully<br>
controlled so as to maintain the vapour pressure of the adduct<br>
within the above limits. In particular, the control of the<br>
temperature is very important in view of the fact that the<br>
reaction is greatly exothermic. Therefore, it can be preferred<br>
working under conditions such that heat exchange is maximized.<br>
For the same reason, the feeding of the alcohol has to be<br>
controlled in order to obtain an efficient dispersion of the<br>
alcohol in the reactor, thus avoiding the formation of the so<br>
called hot spots. The feeding of the alcohol can be carried out<br>
for example with injection nozzles, preferably located in the<br>
fast fluidization zone of the loop reactor. According to an<br>
alternative method, the alcohol can be fed to the loop reactor<br>
in a zone after the densified zone and before the fast<br>
fluidization zone, where a centrifugal mixer (of the Loedige<br>
type) is installed in order to direct the solid particles<br>
towards the walls of the reactor and create a cavitated zone<br>
where the alcohol is preferably fed. Preferably, the reactor<br>
temperature in correspondence to the alcohol feeding zone<br>
should be maintained at values in the range 40-50°C when<br>
operating at atmospheric pressure.<br>
The particles of the adduct discharged from the loop reacter<br>
can be then subjected to a treatment capable of imparting them<br><br>
a spherical morphology. In particular, the treatment comprises<br>
subjecting the adducts to a temperature equal to or higher than<br>
the melting temperature of the adduct until the adduct is<br>
completely melted, said treatment being carried out in absence<br>
or presence of an inert liquid dispersant, then emulsifying the<br>
molten adduct in a liquid medium which is immiscible with and<br>
chemically inert to it and finally quenching the molten adduct<br>
with an inert cooling liquid thereby obtaining the<br>
solidification of the adduct in spherical form. Alternatively,<br>
in order to obtain the solidification of the adduct in<br>
spherical form, the molten adduct can be subjected to a spray-<br>
cooling process according to known techniques.<br>
The treatment which comprises melting the adduct in the<br>
presence of an inert dispersant agent, such as vaseline oil,<br>
then emulsifying and finally quenching said molten adduct, is<br>
particularly preferred.<br>
The liquid in which the molten adduct is emulsified is<br>
preferably a hydrocarbon liquid such as vaseline oil. The<br>
liquid used to quench the emulsion can be equal to or different<br>
from the liquid in which the molten adduct is emulsified.<br>
Preferably, it is an aliphatic hydrocarbon and more preferably<br>
a light aliphatic hydrocarbon such as pentane, hexane, heptane<br>
and the like.<br>
The solid adducts having a spherical morphology are very<br>
suitable in the preparation of spherical catalyst components<br><br>
for the polymerization of olefins and in particular for the<br>
gas-phase polymerization process.<br>
The catalyst components to be used in the polymerization of<br>
olefins comprise a transition metal compound of one of the<br>
groups IV to VI of the Periodic Table of Elements, supported on<br>
the adducts of the invention.<br>
A method suitable for the preparation of said catalyst<br>
components, comprises the reaction between the adducts of the<br>
invention and the transition metal compound. Among transition<br>
metal compounds particularly preferred are titanium compounds<br>
of formula Ti(OR)nXy-n in which n is comprised between 0 and y; y<br>
is the valency of titanium; X is halogen and R is an alkyl<br>
radical having 1-8 carbon atoms or a COR group. Among them,<br>
particularly preferred are titanium compounds having at least<br>
one Ti-halogen bond such as titanium tetrahalides or<br>
halogenalcoholates. Preferred specific titanium compounds are<br>
TiCl3, TiCl4, Ti(OBu)4, Ti(OBu)Cl,, Ti(OBu)2Cl2, Ti(OBu)3Cl.<br>
Preferably the reaction is carried out by suspending the adduct<br>
in cold TiCl4 (generally OEC); then the so obtained mixture is<br>
heated up to 80-130EC and kept at this temperature for 0.5-2<br>
hours. After that the excess of TiCl4 is removed and the solid<br>
component is recoverd. The treatment with TiCl4 can be carried<br>
out one or more times.<br>
The reaction between transition metal compound and the adduct<br>
can also be carried out in the presence of an electron donor<br><br>
compound (internal donor) in particular when the preparation of<br>
a stereospecic catalyst for the polymerization of olefins is to<br>
be prepared. Said electron donor compound can be selected from<br>
esters, ethers, amines, silanes and ketones. In particular,<br>
the alkyl and aryl esters of mono or polycarboxylic acids such<br>
as for example esters of benzoic, phthalic and malonic acid,<br>
are preferred. Specific examples of such esters are n-<br>
butylphthalate, di-isobutylphthalate, di-n-octylphthalate,<br>
ethyl-benzoate and p-ethoxy ethyl-benzoate. Moreover, can be<br>
advantageously used also the 1,3 diethers of the formula:<br><br>
wherein RI, RII, RIII, RIV, Rv and RVI equal or different to each<br>
other, are hydrogen or hydrocarbon radicals having from 1 to 18<br>
carbon atoms, and RVII and RVIII, equal or different from each<br>
other, have the same meaning of RI-RVI except that they cannot<br>
be hydrogen; one or more of the RI-RVIII groups can be linked to<br>
form a cycle. The 1,3-diethers in which RVII and RVIII are<br>
selected from C1-C4 alkyl radicals are particularly preferred.<br>
The electron donor compound is generally present in molar ratio<br>
with respect to the magnesium comprised between 1:4 and 1:20.<br><br>
Preferably, the particles of the solid catalyst components have<br>
substantially spherical morphology and an average diameter<br>
comprised between 5 and 150µm. With the term substantial<br>
spherical morphology are meant those particles having a ratio<br>
between the greater and smaller axis equal to or lower than 1.5<br>
and preferably lower than 1.3.<br>
Before the reaction with the transition metal compound, the<br>
adducts of the present invention can also be subjected to a<br>
dealcoholation treatment aimed at lowering the alcohol content<br>
and increasing the porosity of the adduct itself. The<br>
dealcoholation can be carried out according to known<br>
methodologies such as those described in EP-A-395083. Depending<br>
on the extent of the dealcoholation treatment, partially<br>
dealcoholated adducts can be obtained having an alcohol content<br>
generally ranging from 0.1 to 2.6 moles of alcohol per mole of<br>
MgCl2. After the dealcoholation treatment the adducts are<br>
reacted with the transition metal compound, according to the<br>
techniques described above, in order to obtain the solid<br>
catalyst components.<br>
The solid catalyst components according to the present<br>
invention show a surface area (by B.E.T. method) generally<br>
between 10 and 500 m2/g and preferably between 20 and 350 m2/g,<br>
and a total porosity (by B.E.T. method) higher than 0.15 cmVg<br>
preferably between 0.2. and 0.6 cm/g.<br><br>
Surprisingly, the catalyst components comprising the reaction<br>
product of a transition metal compound with a MgCl2-alcohol<br>
adduct which is in turn obtained by partially dealcoholating<br>
the adducts of the invention, -show improved properties,<br>
particularly in terms of activity, with respect to the catalyst<br>
components prepared from the dealcoholated adducts of the prior<br>
art.<br>
The catalyst components of the invention form catalysts for the<br>
polymerization of alpha-olefins CH2=CHR, wherein R is hydrogen<br>
or a hydrocarbon radical having 1-12 carbon atoms, by reaction<br>
with Al-alkyl compounds. The alkyl-Al compound is preferably<br>
chosen among the trialkyl aluminum compounds such as for<br>
example triethylaluminum, triisobutylaluminum, tri-n-<br>
butylaluminum, tri-n-hexylaluminum, tri-n-octylaluminum. It is<br>
also possible to use alkylaluminum halides, alkylaluminum<br>
hydrides or alkylaluminum sesquichlorides such as AlEt2Cl and<br>
Al,Et3Cl3 optionally in mixture with said trialkyl aluminum<br>
compounds..<br>
The Al/Ti ratio is higher than 1 and is generally comprised<br>
between 20 and 800.<br>
In the case of the stereoregular polymerization of α-olefins<br>
such as for example propylene and 1-butene, an electron donor<br>
compound (external donor) which can be the same or different<br>
from the compound used as internal donor can be used in the<br>
preparation of the catalysts disclosed above. In case the<br><br>
internal donor is an ester of a polycarboxylic acid, in<br>
particular a phthalate, the external donor is preferably<br>
selected from the silane compounds containing at least a Si-OR<br>
link, having the formula Ra1Rb2Si(OR2), where a and b are integer<br>
from 0 to 2, c is an integer from 1 to 3 and the sum (a+b+c) is<br>
4; R1, R2, and R3, are alkyl, cycloalkyl or aryl radicals with<br>
1-18 carbon atoms. Particularly preferred are the silicon<br>
compounds in which a is 1, b is 1, c is 2, at least one of R1<br>
and R2 is selected from branched alkyl, cycloalkyl or aryl<br>
groups with 3-10 carbon atoms and R3 is a C1-C10 alkyl group, in<br>
particular methyl. Examples of such preferred silicon compounds<br>
are methylcyclohexyldimethoxysilane, diphenyldimethoxysilane,<br>
methyl-t-butyldimethoxysilane, dicyclopentyldimethoxysilane.<br>
Moreover, are also preferred the silicon compounds in which a<br>
is 0, c is 3, R2 is a branched alkyl or cycloalkyl group and R3<br>
is methyl. Examples of such preferred silicon compounds are<br>
cyclohexyltrimethoxysilane, t-butyltrimethoxysilane and<br>
thexyltrimethoxysilane.<br>
Also the 1,3 diethers having the previously described formula<br>
can be used as external donor. However, in the case 1,3-<br>
diethers are used as internal donors, the use of an external<br>
donor can be avoided, as the stereospecificity of the catalyst<br>
is already sufficiently high.<br>
As previously indicated the components of the invention and<br>
catalysts obtained therefrom find applications in the processes<br><br>
for the (co) polymerization of olefins of formula CH2=CHR in<br>
which R is hydrogen or a hydrocarbon radical having 1-12 carbon<br>
atoms.<br>
The catalysts of the invention can be used in any of the olefin<br>
polymerization processes known in the art. They can be used for<br>
example in slurry polymerization using as diluent an inert<br>
hydrocarbon solvent, or bulk polymerization using the liquid<br>
monomer (for example propylene) as a reaction medium. Moreover,<br>
they can also be used in the polymerization process carried out<br>
in gas-phase operating in one or more fluidized or mechanically<br>
agitated bed reactors.<br>
The polymerization is generally carried out at temperature of<br>
from 20 to 120°C, preferably of from 40 to 80°C. When the<br>
polymerization is carried out in gas-phase the operating<br>
pressure is generally between 0.1 and 10 MPa, preferably<br>
between 1 and 5 MPa. In the bulk polymerization the operating<br>
pressure is generally between 1 and 6 MPa preferably between<br>
1.5 and 4 MPa.<br>
The catalysts of the invention are very useful for preparing a<br>
broad range of polyolefin products. Specific examples of the<br>
olefinic polymers which can be prepared are: high density<br>
ethylene polymers (HDPE, having a density higher than 0.940<br>
g/cc), comprising ethylene homopolymers and copolymers of<br>
ethylene with alpha-olefins having 3-12 carbon atoms; linear<br>
low density polyethylenes (LLDPE, having a density lower than<br><br>
0.940 g/cc) and very low density and ultra low density (VLDPE<br>
and ULDPE, having a density lower than 0.920 g/cc, to 0.880<br>
g/cc) consisting of copolymers of ethylene with one or more<br>
alpha-olefins having from 3 to 12 carbon atoms, having a mole<br>
content of units derived from the ethylene higher than 80%;<br>
isotactic polypropylenes and crystalline copolymers of<br>
propylene and ethylene and/or other alpha-olefins having a<br>
content of units derived from propylene higher than 85% by<br>
weight; copolymers of propylene and 1-butene having a content<br>
of units derived from 1-butene comprised between 1 and 40% by<br>
weight; heterophasic copolymers comprising a crystalline<br>
polypropylene matrix and an amorphous phase comprising<br>
copolymers of propylene with ethylene and or other alpha-<br>
olefins.<br>
The following examples are given to illustrate and not to limit<br>
the invention itself.<br>
CHARACTERIZATION<br>
The properties reported below have been determined according to<br>
the following methods:<br>
X-ray diffraction spectra were carried out with a Philips PW<br>
1710 instrument using the CuKα(λ= l, 5418) with a 40Kv tension<br>
generator, a 20mA current generator and a receiving slit of<br>
0.2mm. The X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded in the<br>
range between 2θ=5° and 2θ=15° with a scanning rate of<br>
0.05°2θ/10 sec. The instrument was calibrated using the ASTM<br><br>
27-1402 standard for Silicon. The samples to be analyzed were<br>
closed in a polyethylene bag of 50µm thickness operating in a<br>
dry-box.<br>
The DSC measurement were carried put with a METTLER DSC 30<br>
instrument at a scanning rate of 5°C/min in the range 5-125°C.<br>
Aluminum capsules having a volume of 40µl filled with the<br>
samples in a dry-box were used in order to avoid hydration of<br>
the samples.<br>
The viscosity measurement have been carried out according to<br>
ASTM D445-65 using a Cannon-Fenske type viscosimeter. During<br>
the measurement the samples are maintained in a dry nitrogen<br>
environment in order to avoid hydration.<br>

Into a 11 steel reactor provided with stirrer, 800cm3 of TiCl4<br>
at 0°C were introduced; at room temperature and whilst stirring<br>
16 g of the adduct were introduced together with an amount of<br>

minutes and these conditions were maintained over 120 minutes.<br>
The stirring was stopped and after 30 minutes the liquid phase<br>
was separated from the sedimented solid maintaining the<br>

hexane at 60°C and 3 washings with 500 cm3 of anhydrous hexane<br>
