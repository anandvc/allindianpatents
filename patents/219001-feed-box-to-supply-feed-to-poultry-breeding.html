				<td>FEED BOX TO SUPPLY FEED TO POULTRY BREEDING<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention concerns a feedbox to supply feed to poultry breeding in general.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In general, feedboxes are connected to a main feeding tube within which the feed is<br>
continously supplied by a auger screw. At each point where a feedbox is to be set, the<br>
main tubular duct comprises a discharge port which opens downwards. The lower part of<br>
each feedbox comprises a feed storage tub, which must be accessible to the animals<br>
regardless of their size throughout the whole of their growth stage.<br>
For this reason, feedboxes are therefore equipped with means to adjust the amount of<br>
feed that is kept in the storage tub. This is necessary to adapt the amount of feed made<br>
available according to the growth stage of the animals present in a particular installation.<br>
However, in contrast to this main requirement is the need to avoid feed waste as much<br>
as possible, a factor that can considerably influence the costs connected with large scale<br>
breeding. The feedboxes of the known type do not generally envisage adjustment<br>
systems of the feed level able to effectively prevent feed waste. In fact, such feedboxes<br>
have fixed mesh feed protection grates that often prevent the chicks, especially when<br>
very young, from completely entering the feedbox and unnecessarily dispersing the feed<br>
and soiling it with excrement and dirt. Therefore, use of these feedboxes, during the<br>
growth of poultry, requires variation in the configuration of the protection grate depending<br>
on the size reached by the poultry. When the poultry is at the chick stage, a protection<br>
cage with particularly reduced openings will be needed, whereas<br>
larger openings will be used for adult poultry.<br>
However, it would be expedient that such feedboxes, for economic<br>
reasons, entirely accompany the life cycle of poultry from the chick<br>
stage to that of adults. For this purpose, it therefore becomes<br>
necessary to use a feedbox with a protection grate in which<br>
accessibility to the feed can be regulated depending on the size of<br>
the poultry.<br>
In addition, the known type of feedboxes have feed adjustment<br>
systems which are complex and difficult to use, above all because the<br>
locking into position of the shutter that regulates feed flow requires<br>
manual handling of the shutter, which is typically found inside the<br>
feedbox.<br>
Moreover, it is expedient to underline that as soon as the chicks are<br>
put into breeding sheds they tend to occupy only certain areas of the<br>
available space and take feed from a only few feedboxes. Only with<br>
time and an increase in poultry size, by now almost adults, will they<br>
move around all the shed space making use of all the feedboxes<br>
present therein. In order to provide for effective plant management<br>
that avoids feed waste it is necessary to be able to supply the<br>
individual feedboxes separately according to the behavioural factors<br>
and/or factors connected to the growth of the poultry.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The task of the present invention is to propose a feedbox to supply<br>
feed to breeding poultry which can be used effectively throughout<br>
the life cycle of the poultry and that solves the drawbacks of the<br>
known technique.<br>
Within the scope of this task, an object of the present invention is to<br>
produce a feedbox for poultry That is easy to manufacture and<br>
effectively prevents the entry of chicks inside the feed container.<br>
An object of the present invention is to propose a feedbox of the type<br>
specified above that allows a simple and precise adjustment of the<br>
feed level in the storage tub of the same feedbox.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose a feedbox that<br>
eliminates feed waste.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose a feedbox that<br>
allows individual adjustment of the feeding tubes in a simple and<br>
precise way.<br>
Furthermore, a feedbox that can be produced with particularly<br>
contained costs, which can be particularly simple to use and easy to<br>
remove if and when necessary.<br>
These objects are achieved by the present invention, that concerns a<br>
feedbox to feed breeding poultry, of the type connected to a main<br>
feed auger screw and comprising: at least one gravity feeding tube<br>
joined to the main feed auger screw by means of a pipe fitting<br>
device, the feeding tube having one or more ports for the passage of<br>
feed; at least one storage tub for the feed coming from the feeding<br>
tube; means to adjust the feed level; at least one main protection<br>
grate mounted on the storage tub and provided with dividing plates<br>
and openings to allow the poultry access to the feed, characterised in<br>
that it comprises at least one sliding auxiliary grate or rotationally<br>
joined to the main protection grate, the auxiliary grate comprising a<br>
plurality of peripheral tips and arranged so that the tips do not<br>
interfere with the openings of the main protection grate in at least one<br>
initial relative position of the auxiliary grate with respect to the main<br>
grate and, vice versa, obstruct at least partially one or more of the<br>
openings in at least one second relative position of the auxiliary grate<br>
with respect to the main grate.<br>
This allows the accomplishment of a feedbox for breeding poultry able<br>
to be effectively used throughout the life cycle of the poultry since it<br>
prevents, in an optimum way, the possible entry of both chicks and<br>
adults inside the same feedbox.<br>
According to a particular aspect of the present invention, the auxiliary<br>
grate is rotationally mounted above the storage tub, and in particular<br>
on the main grate, and the tips partially extend towards the storage<br>
tub.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, the number of<br>
tips of the auxiliary grate is the same as the dividing plates of the main<br>
protection grate and the dividing plates are angularly equidistant<br>
from each other, as well as the tips of the auxiliary grate are angularly<br>
equidistant.<br>
According to a preferred aspect of the present invention, the means<br>
for adjusting the feed level comprise at least one adjustment assembly<br>
to continuously vary the distance between the free edge of the main<br>
protection grate and the upper edge of the tub.<br>
This allows the free edge of the main grate to be always kept at the<br>
most suitable height to avoid the feed overflowing from the feedbox.<br>
and prevent the poultry dispersing the feed unnecessarily.<br>
According to a preferred aspect of the present invention, the<br>
adjustment assembly comprises one or more slots and one or more<br>
corresponding pins engaged in the slots to vary the distance between<br>
the free edge of the main protection grate and the upper edge of the<br>
storage tub.<br>
According to a preferred aspect of the present invention, the slots<br>
have a profile comprising a plurality of appropriately distanced seats<br>
able to engage the pins to prevent the undesired rotation of the main<br>
protection grate with respect to the tub.<br>
According to a preferred aspect of the present invention, the means<br>
to adjust the feed level comprise at least one shutter sliding on the<br>
gravity feeding tube to intercept the feed passage ports and friction<br>
means to hold the shutter in position.<br>
According to an advantageous aspect of the present invention, the<br>
shutter is connected to at least one wire on which the friction means<br>
act.<br>
The provision of friction means to hold the shutter in position<br>
considerably simplifies the manual handiing of the shutter itself to<br>
accurately set the desired feed level in the storage tub.<br>
According to a preferred aspect of the present invention, the pipe<br>
fitting device comprises a member to adjust the feed flow to the<br>
gravity feeding tube of the feedbox.<br>
According to another preferred aspect, the member to adjust the<br>
feed flow comprises a shutter sliding in a guide along at least one<br>
portion of the side surface of the pipe fitting device and means to<br>
adjust the position of this shutter with respect to the gravity feeding<br>
tube.<br>
A sliding shutter in a guide along the side surface of the pipe fitting<br>
device, produced in this way, allows the individual adjustment of the<br>
feeding tubes in a simple and precise way.<br>

MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The feedbox 1 comprises, see Figure 4, a gravity feeding tube 2 connected to a<br>
main feed auger screw (not shown) by means of a pipe fitting device 3. The<br>
feeding tube 2 has a pair of ports 21 (Figure 5) that allow the passage of feed<br>
from the feeding tube 2 to a storage tub 4.<br>
A main protection grate 5 is located above the storage tub 4<br>
designed to prevent the poultry from gaining access to the interior<br>
of the storage tub. The main protection grate 5 is mounted on the<br>
storage tub 4 and has a free edge 51 that overlaps the upper edge 41<br>
(Figures 6A and 6B) of ihe tub 4.<br>
In particular, the main protection grate 5 surrounds the feeding tube 2<br>
and consists of mutually alternated dividing plates 85 and openings<br>
86. The openings 86, defined by the dividing plates 85, are only large<br>
enough to allow an adult bird to insert its head within the feedbox to<br>
reach the feed in the storage tub 4.<br>
The feedbox also has an auxiliary grate 84 (Figure 3) rotationally<br>
connected to the same main grate 5 and with mutually equidistant<br>
tips 87. The auxiliary grate 84 is shaped in a such way that the tips 87<br>
can be completely superimposed by the dividing plates 85 of the<br>
main grate 5, in an initial relative position between main grate 5 and<br>
auxiliary grate 84, and they can partially obstruct the openings 86 of<br>
the main grate 5, in a second relative position between main grate 5<br>
and auxiliary grate 84 (shown in Figure 1).<br>
In the embodiment shown in Figure 1, the auxiliary grate 84 is located<br>
at the upper portion of the main grate 5, around the feeding tube 5,<br>
and the tips 87 partially extend towards the upper edge 51 of the tub<br>
4, so as to reduce the height of the feed access openings 86, when<br>
the tips 87 are set at the latter.<br>
Thus, when the poultry are at the beginning of their growth, i.e. at the<br>
chick stage, it is necessary to rotate the auxiliary grate 84 with respect<br>
to the main grate 5, or vice versa, the main grate 5 with respect to the<br>
auxiliary grate 84, to make the feed access openings 86 partially<br>
obstructed by the tips 87, in a such way to prohibit chicks access<br>
inside the same feedbox. On the contrary, when the poultry are<br>
adults, it is sufficient to rotate the auxiliary grate 84 again, or the main<br>
grate 5, so as to set the tips 87 at the dividing plates 85 and therefore<br>
free the access openings 86 to allow the poultry to feed.<br>
The form and arrangement of the tips 87 are designed so that the end<br>
of the latter is set from the edge 51 of storage tub 4 at a lesser<br>
distance than average chick height and, in particular, at a distance of<br>
between 3.5 and 4cm, to discourage the chicks from jumping on the<br>
edge 51 of the storage tub and entering inside the feedbox. There is<br>
an equal number of dividing plates 85 and tips 87 and both the tips 87<br>
and the dividing plates 85 are mutually equidistant.<br>
Besides, it is preferable to set the auxiliary grate 84 internally with<br>
respect to the main grate 5, thus preventing the tips, especially when<br>
superimposed by the dividing plates 85 and thus harder to distinguish<br>
from the latter, from sticking out dangerously for the poultry.<br>
Moreover, to aid the relative rotation between main grate 5 and<br>
auxiliary grate 84, when the latter is internally mounted with respect to<br>
the main grate 5, the dividing plates 85 of the same main grate 5 have<br>
a slot 82 inside (Figure 2) within which are arranged the tips 87 of the<br>
grate 84 without any mutual interference.<br>
In particular, the main grate 5 has a groove on the inner surface of its<br>
upper closing portion that joins with a shaped projection of the<br>
auxiliary grate 84 in a sliding connection 89 along the entire perimeter<br>
of the same main grate 5 to allow the rotation of the auxiliary grate 84<br>
with respect to the main grate 5, that is instead fixed to the storage<br>
tub 4. Thus the connection 89 only allows the sliding of the projection<br>
of the auxiliary grate 84 along the circular way defined by the groove<br>
made on the main grate 5, preventing any other relative movement<br>
between main grate 5 and auxiliary grate 84.<br>
According to the present invention, in feedboxes where there is a<br>
rotating connection between main grate 5 and auxiliary grate 84, an<br>
external control system 81 (Figure 1) can also be provided, as shown in<br>
Figure 1, for the rotation of the auxiliary grate 84 with respect to the<br>
main grate 5, consisting of a slot made on the main grate 5 and a pin<br>
integral with the auxiliary grate 84 sliding inside the slot to allow<br>
rotation of the auxiliary grate 84 with respect to the main fixed grate.<br>
Figure 4 and the detailed views of Figures 9A and 9B instead show the<br>
assembly that allows the continuous variation of the distance between<br>
the free edge 51 of the main protection grate 5 and the upper edge<br>
of the tub 4.<br>
According to the invention, this adjustment assembly comprises one or<br>
more slots 52 made in a side band 53 of the main grate 5 that surround<br>
the side wall 43 of the tub 4. From the side wall 43 of tub 4, at each<br>
inclined slot 52, pins 42 protrude which fit into in the respective slots 52.<br>
The variation of the distance between the free edge 51 of the main<br>
grate 5 and the upper edge 41 of the tub 4 can be easily carried out<br>
by manually turning the main grate 5 with respect to the tub 4.<br>
Tabs 45 (Figure 4), protruding under tub 4, are preferably provided to<br>
help the mutual rotation between the main grate 5 and the tub 4. In<br>
the position shown in Figure 9A, the distance between the free edge<br>
51 of the main grate 5 and the upper edge 41 of the tub 4 is<br>
maximum, i.e. a suitable position to allow the feeding of adult poultry.<br>
In the position shown in Figure 9B, the two edges 41 and 51 are instead<br>
in such a position to allow smaller poultry to reach the feed present on<br>
the edge 51 without feed being wasted.<br>
According to an advantageous aspect of the present invention, the<br>
slots 52 have a plurality of appropriately equidistant seats 55 able to<br>
engage the pins 42 to determine a series of discrete adjustment<br>
positions and simultaneously prevent any undesired rotation of the<br>
protection grate 5 with respect to the tub 4.<br>
Some slot embodiments according to the invention are shown in<br>
Figures 10A-10F. The embodiments shown in Figures 10A-10D have slots<br>
with a substantially inclined tendency, the embodiment in Figure TOE<br>
has a form with only some inclined sections, while the embodiment in<br>
Figure 10F has a substantially straight progression with vertical slots that<br>
terminate at different heights in correspondence of different seats 55.<br>
For adjustment of the feed level, feedbox 1 also has a shutter 6 sliding<br>
on the feeding tube 2 to intercept the feed passage ports so as to<br>
allow the adjustment of the feed volume inside the tub 4. To aid the<br>
sliding of the shutter 6 on the feeding tube 2 without the chance of<br>
rotation of one part with respect to the other, there are some hollow<br>
guide surfaces 63 (Figure 5) that engage in corresponding protruding<br>
ribs 23 on the feeding tube 2. The protruding ribs 23 give the duct 2<br>
extra rigidity at the portion comprising the ports 21.<br>
The shutter 6 is fastened to a wire 61 on which friction means 7<br>
preferably act to hoid it in position once the desired adjustment has<br>
been carried out. The wire 61 is thus used to carry out the manual<br>
adjustment of the height of shutter 6. The free wire end 61 can be fixed<br>
for convenience to any hooking part (not shown), if necessary, on the<br>
feedbox 1 or on the main feed auger screw.<br>
As better shown in Figures 5 and 6, the friction means 7 comprise an<br>
elastic member, namely a helical spring 71 that pushes the wire 61<br>
against a friction surface 72 supplied with a button 73. The helical<br>
spring 71 is mounted on a pin 31 which sticks out from the pipe fitting<br>
device 3, with the button 73 fixed to the free end of the pin 31 in a<br>
known way, for instance by heat sealing, friction welding, glueing,<br>
fixed joint, threading or similar. Alternatively, the button 73 can also be<br>
produced in a single piece with the pin 31.<br>
Near the button 73, the pin 31 has a transversal hole 32 crossed by the<br>
wire 61, so that the spring 71 pushes the wire 61 against the friction<br>
surface 72 offered by button 73.<br>
As can be seen in Figure 6, the pipe fitting device 3 that connects the<br>
main feed auger serew and the feeding tube 2 is a three-way pipe<br>
fitting device consisting of a pair of distinct half-shells 35 and 36<br>
separated according to a vertical plane and hinged together, and<br>
that creates a hole 109 for the passage of the feed into said gravity<br>
feeding tube 2. To adjust the feed supply to the feeding tube 2, a<br>
shutter 106 is envisaged that slides in a guide 108 on the side surface<br>
of the pipe fitting device.<br>
The shutter 106, sliding within the guide 108 made on an internal side<br>
surface of the pipe fitting device, opens or closes the hole 109 of the<br>
feeding tube 2 to allow, according to feedbox operation needs, the<br>
passage of the feed from the main auger screw to the feeding tube 2.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, shown in Figure 8, the shutter 106 is a<br>
curved plate able to form a cylindrical part 100 with a slit 110 of<br>
appropriate size on its side surface that allows, when placed over the<br>
hole 109 of the feeding tube, the passage of the feed to the feeding<br>
tube 2.<br>
In addition, the shutter 106 has means to adjust its position inside the<br>
guide with respect to the hole 109 of the feeding tube 2. In particular,<br>
such adjustment means consist of a tab 120 integral with the<br>
cylindrical part 110 and protruding from its side surface to engage, in<br>
a sliding way, a slot 130 that crosses the guide 108 on the side surface<br>
of the pipe fitting device 3.<br>
Moving the tab 120 inside slot 130 of the pipe fitting device 3 varies the<br>
position of the slit 110 of the cylindrical part 100 with respect to the<br>
port of feeding tube 2, thus making the passage of the feed possible<br>
inside the feeding tube 2 or its total or partial interception.<br>
According to a preferred aspect of the invention, the cylindrical part<br>
100 forming the shutter is a flexible curved sheet that forms a closable<br>
and/or openable ring-shaped band. This latter feature of the<br>
cylindrical part assists its removal from the pipe fitting device 3 should if<br>
prove necessary to replace it in case of damage or when it is<br>
necessary to clean inside the device 3.<br>
Besides, to avoid the mutual overlapping of the end of the ring-<br>
shaped band, during shutter movement inside the relevant guide 108,<br>
locking means are preferably present i.e. two protruding parts i.e.<br>
projections (not shown) that lock such ends by contrast. Turning again<br>
to Figures 4 and 6, the pipe fitting device 3 that joins the main feed<br>
auger screw and the feeding tube 2 is a three-way pipe fitting device<br>
consisting of a pair of separate half-shells 35 and 36 separated<br>
according to a vertical plane and hinged together. In fact, half-shell<br>
35 comprises a hinge pin 37 able to be snap inserted into a<br>
corresponding hole 38 on the half-shell 36.<br>
In the embodiment described herein, the pin 31 of the friction means 7<br>
is shown integral with the half-shell 35 for reasons of clarity, but is<br>
appropriate to emphasize that the same pin 31 is preferably made<br>
integral with the half-shell 36, so as to simplify the shape of the two<br>
half-shells.<br>
The pipe fitting device 3 thus formed allows to assist assembly<br>
operations and removal of the feedbox 1 with respect to the feed<br>
auger screw.<br>
The connection between the pipe fitting device 3 and the feeding<br>
tube can, for instance, be formed by means of a bayonet joint using a<br>
protruding pin 39 that engages a groove 29 (Figure 5) of shape and<br>
size suitable to produce this type of joint. A possible locking pin 1 1<br>
(Figure 4) can be inserted in the through hole 34 of pipe fitting device<br>
3 (Figure 6) and in the through hole 24 (Figure 5) of the feeding tube 2<br>
to prevent the undesired release of the feedbox 1 from the pipe fitting<br>
device 3.<br>
When one wishes to remove the feedbox 1 from the pipe fitting device<br>
3, the locking pin 11 can be taken off and put in a hole 33, made in<br>
corresponding positions on both the half-shells 35 and 36, so as to<br>
prevent the undesired opening of the half-shells hinged together when<br>
the feeding tube 2 is removed from the pipe fitting device 3.<br>
Figures 10A-10F show some of the possible embodiments of the height<br>
adjustment means of the free edge. Moreover, it is expedient to<br>
underline that, alternatively with respect to the embodiment shown in<br>
Figure 4, the slots 52 can also be made in the tub 4, with the pins 42<br>
protruding inwards from the protection grate 5.<br>
Figures 11A and 11B show an embodiment example of the auxiliary<br>
means that produce a releasable snap locking of the main grate 5<br>
with respect to the tub 4. The main grate 5 (plan view from below in<br><br>
Figure 11A) comprises at least a protruding portion 57 designed to<br>
engage in a plurality of recesses 47 on the tub 4 (plan view from<br>
above Figure 11B).<br>
The embodiment shown in Figures 11A and 1 1 B have a pair of portions<br>
57 that stick out towards the inside of the side band 53 of the main<br>
grate 5 in diametrically opposite positions, and two corresponding<br>
series of recesses located on the side wall 43 of the tub 4.<br>
However, it is appropriate to point out that the figures only represent<br>
an embodiment example, but the reverse arrangement can also be<br>
adopted, i.e. with the recesses 47 made on the grate 5 and the<br>
protruding portions 57 made on the tub 4, as can also be varied the<br>
plurality of recesses and projections without leading away from the<br>
scope of the present invention.<br>
