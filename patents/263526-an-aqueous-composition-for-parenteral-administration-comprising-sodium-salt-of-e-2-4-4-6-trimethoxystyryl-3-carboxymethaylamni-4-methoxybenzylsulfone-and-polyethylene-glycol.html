60/589,075, filed July 19, 2004 related to PCT Application US03/06357 (WO2003US06357),<br>
filed February 28, 2003, entitled AMINO-SUBSTITUTED (E)-2,6-DIALKOXYSTYRYL 4-<br>
SUBSTITUTED-BENZYLSULFONES FOR TREATING PROLIFERATIVE DISORDERS, which<br>
further derives priority from U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/360,397, filed February<br>
28, 2002.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to compositions for parenteral delivery of certain kinase<br>
inhibitors and methods for the treatment of cancer and proliferative disorders related thereto.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Protein tyrosine kinases are enzymes which catalyze a well defined chemical reaction:<br>
the phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue (Hunter et al., Annu Rev Biochem 54:897 (1985)).<br>
Receptor tyrosine kinases in particular are attractive targets for drug design since blockers for<br>
the substrate domain of these kinases is likely to yield an effective and selective<br>
antiproliferative agent. The potential use of protein tyrosine kinase blockers as<br>
antiproliferative agents was recognized as early as 1981, when quercetin was suggested as a<br>
PTK blocker (Graziani et al., Eur. J. Biochem. 135:583-589 (1983)).<br>
The best understood MAPK pathway involves extracellular signal-regulated kinases<br>
which constitute the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK kinase cascade (Boudewijn et al., Trends Biochem.<br>
Sci 20, 18 (1995)). Once this pathway is activated by different stimuli, MAPK<br>
phosphorylates a variety of proteins including several transcription factors which translocate<br>
into the nucleus and activate gene transcription. Negative regulation of this pathway could<br>
arrest the cascade of these events.<br>
Formulations are needed to stabilize new anticancer chemotherapeutic agents which<br>
target receptor tyrosine kinases and which arrest the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK kinase cascade.<br>
Oncoproteins in general, and signal transducing proteins in particular, are likely to be more<br><br>
selective targets for chemotherapy because they represent a subclass of proteins whose<br>
activities are essential for cell proliferation, and because their activities are greatly amplified<br>
in proliferative diseases. However, the new anticancer chemotherapeutic agents are generally<br>
hydrophobic and unstable and therefore are unusually difficult to formulate for storage and<br>
efficacy upon parenteral administration.<br>
Anticancer formulations are needed to enable efficacious delivery of certain kinase<br>
inhibitors and corollary selection in the killing of proliferating cells such as tumor cells.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is directed to formulations for parenteral administration of amino-<br>
substituted (e)-2,6-dialkoxystyryl 4-substituted benzylsulfones and the sodium and potassium<br>
salts thereof for the prevention and/or treatment of conditions mediated by abnormal cell<br>
proliferation.<br>
Composition for parenteral administration are provided which comprise an effective<br>
amount of a compound of formula I<br><br>
or a compound of formula IIa<br><br><br>
and at least about 50% by weight of at least one water soluble polymerselected from the<br>
group consisting essentially of polyethylene glycol (PEG), poly-oxyethylene, poly-<br>
oxyethylene-poly-oxypropylene copolymers, polyglycerol, polyvinylalcohol,<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), polyvinylpyridine N-oxide, copolymer of vinylpyridine N-oxide<br>
and vinylpyridine.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same<br>
meaning as is commonly understood by one of skill in the art to which this invention belongs.<br>
All publications and patents referred to herein, including U.S. Patent No. 6,486,210, entitled<br>
Substituted Styryl Benzylsulfones for Treating Proliferative Disorders, are incorporated by<br>
reference in their entirety.<br>
Compounds for which compositions and formulations of the present invention are<br>
intended, i.e., (amino substituted (e)-2,6-dialkoxystyryl 4-substituted benzylsulfones (herein<br><br>
referred to as "compounds"), as the Applicants have previously disclosed in the above-<br>
referenced copending applications, are valuable therapeutic compounds for the prevention<br>
and/or treatment of pathophysiological disorders related to mammalian cell growth. The<br>
compounds, however, are generally hydrophobic. These compounds are accordingly<br>
unusually difficult to formulate for storage and efficacy upon parenteral administration.<br>
Parenteral administration includes, for example, intravenous, intramuscular, intraarterial,<br>
intraperitoneal, intranasal, rectal, intravaginal, intravesical (e.g., to the bladder), intradermal,<br>
topical, sublingual or subcutaneous administration. Moreover, improved properties are<br>
provided upon stabilization of the compounds in formulations as described herein.<br>

According to a first embodiment of formula I,<br>
X is <br>
and y is 0; and R2 is -H.<br>
According to a sub-embodiment, there are provided compounds of the formula III,<br>
below:<br><br>
wherein:<br>
g is 0 or 1;<br>
each R2 is independently selected from the group consisting of -H, -(C1-C6)alkyl, and<br>
aryl(C1-C3)alkyl, wherein -R2 and -(M)y-R1 may optionally be linked covalently to form a 5-,<br>
6- or 7-membered substituted or unsubstituted heterocycle;<br><br>
each R3 is independently selected from -(C1-C6)alkyl;<br>
each R4 is independently selected from the group consisting of -H, and -(C1-C6)alkyl;<br>
Q is selected from the group consisting of-H, -(C1-C6)alkoxy, halogen, -(C1-C6)alkyl<br>
and -NR42; and<br>
X1 is selected from the group consisting of (i), (ii) and (iii) below:<br><br>
wherein X is optionally protected with one or more chemical protecting groups;<br>
Suitable protecting groups will be stable to reactions designed to derivatize the 3-<br>
amino group of formula III. Subsequently, said protecting groups are optionally removed to<br>
regenerate the X1.<br>
In another sub-embodiment, there are provided compounds of the formula IIIa, below.<br><br>
wherein X2 is selected from the group consisting of -NO2 and -NH2, wherein said -<br>
NH2 is optionally protected with a chemical protecting group.<br>
A strategy for synthesizing compounds of formula I involves derivatization of an<br>
primary or secondary amino group at the 3-position of formula IIIa. Such derivatizations of<br>
the 3-amino group include for example reactions to form carboxamides, sulfonamides alkyl<br>
amines, nitrogen-containing heterocycles, imines, guanidines, ureas, amidines, and amino<br>
ketones.<br>
The intermediate of formula IIIa also incorporates a nitro group or a protected amino<br>
group at the 5-position. In the synthetic strategy, this 5-substituent serves as a second, latent<br><br>
amino group. The use of this protecting group strategy allows for differential derivatization<br>
of these two amino groups, i.e., the 3-amino group of formula IIIa and the moiety at the 5-<br>
position which is inert to the conditions of the derivatization of the 3-amino group. Hence,<br>
the synthetic route involves first derivatizing the 3-amino group, followed by conversion of<br>
the 5-substituent to an amino group via either (a) deprotection, if X2 is a protected amine, or<br>
(b) chemical reduction if X2 is a nitro group. Hence, from a retrosynthetic viewpoint, the<br>
synthetic route allows for differential derivatization of two amino groups, one at the 5-<br>
position which is protected (either with a chemical protecting group, or by being in a nitro<br>
oxidation state) and thereby inert to the conditions of the derivatization of the 3-amino group.<br>
Suitable chemical protecting groups for the 5-position protected amine, include for example,<br>
benzyl, 2,4-dimethoxy-benzyl and benzyloxycarbonyl (CBZ). In a similar manner, when X2<br>
is -NO2, the 3-amino group may be derivatized in the aforesaid manner. Subsequently the —<br>

II. FORMULATIONS<br>
Compositions of the present invention improve the stability, solubility, and efficacy of<br>
amino-substituted (e)-2,6-dialkoxystyryl 4-substituted benzylsulfones substituted<br>
compounds. These compounds exhibit a broad range of activity in a wide array of cancer<br>
cells. Provided herein are compositions that provide for solubilization and stabilization of<br>
these compounds as well as for their efficacious delivery by means of parenteral<br>
administration for the prevention and/or treatment of cancer and related proliferative<br>
disorders.<br>
The term "effective amount", as used herein refers to an amount of a compound<br>
within the description of the present disclosure which, upon parenteral administration to a<br>
mammal in a composition of the present invention, is capable of providing a therapeutic<br>
effect to a mammal in need thereof. "Therapeutic effect", as used herein, refers to the ability<br>
to prevent, control, or treat a pathophysiological or disease condition, for example, a disorder<br>
related to abnormal cell growth and/or proliferation.<br><br>
Compositions described herein are generally formulated to comprise at least one of.<br>
the compounds within a range of about 10mg/ml to about 400mg/ml. Preferred compositions<br>
of the present invention comprise at least one compound within the scope of the description at<br>
a concentration within the range of about 25mg/ml to about 250mg/ml. Compositions<br>
described herein are formulated to comprise at least one of the compounds within the scope<br>
of the description at a concentration within the range of about 40mg/ml to about 200mg/ml.<br>
Compositions described herein are also formulated to comprise at least one of the compounds<br>
within the scope of the description at a concentration within the range of about 50mg/ml to<br>
about 150mg/ml. Compositions described herein are particularly formulated to comprise at<br>
least one of the compounds within the scope of the description at a concentration within the<br>
range of about 60mg/ml to about 100mg/ml. Compositions described herein are formulated<br>
to comprise at least one of the compounds within the scope of the description at a<br>
concentration of about 75mg/ml.<br>
Compositions of the present invention are generally formulated with the active<br>
ingredients, i.e., the compounds, in a concentrated form for storage and handling prior to<br>
dilution with suitable parenteral diluent prior to infusion. A single dosage is generally within<br>
the range of about 1ml to about 5ml of any of the compositions described herein. 3ml<br>
individual dosages of compositions described herein are preferred. The dosages may be<br>
packaged, for example, in 5ml vials.<br>
Compositions of the present invention may, for example, be diluted with about 7 parts<br>
diluent (7:1) prior to administration (e.g., the formulation which is 75/mg/ml in 50% PEG<br>
(Example II)). However, the dilution factor and the diluent employed depend on the<br>
concentration of drug in the formulation, and the composition of the vehicle, i.e., whether the<br>
formulation contains, for example, 50%, 75% or 100% PEG. Compositions of the present<br>
invention, however, may be diluted with anywhere within the range of about 2 volumes of<br>
suitable parenteral diluent prior to infusion to about 12 volumes of suitable parenteral diluent,<br>
prior to infusion. The final diluted product for parenteral administration of compositions of<br>
the present invention should have a pH within the range of about 5.0 to about 9.0. Preferably<br>
the final diluted product for parenteral administration should have a pH within the range of<br>
about 7.0 to about 7.5. A final diluted product pH of about 7.4 is preferred. The osmolality<br><br>
of the diluted formulation for administration should be approximately within the range of<br>
about 200 to about 400 mOsm/kg. Preferred osmolality of the diluted formulation for<br>
administration should be approximately within the range of about 270 to about 330 mOsm/kg.<br>
A preferred osmolality of the diluted formulation for administration should be approximately<br>
300 mOsm/kg.<br>
dielectric constant<br>
Compositions of the present invention, compared to conventional formulations, are<br>
demonstrated herein to unexpectedly greatly increase the solubility and stability of the<br>
specifically described compounds and hence significantly increase the efficacy and<br>
therapeutic value upon parenteral administration. A dramatic stabilization effect, however, is<br>
observed by lowering the dielectric constant of the formulation vehicle. The effect of the<br>
dipole moment of solvent on the compounds described herein is found to be an extraordinary<br>
factor in the formulation of compositions for efficacious parenteral delivery of the<br>
compounds, particularly for efficacy. The influence of ionic strength and dielectric constant<br>
on the stabilization of the activated complex in the transition state of these compounds is<br>
paramount in formulating efficacious compositions for parenteral administration.<br>
Compositions for parenteral administration are particularly provided which comprise<br>
an effective amount of a compound of formula I or a compound of formula IIa and at least<br>
about 50% by weight of at least one water soluble polymer, wherein formula I:<br><br>

Lower dielectric constant moreover unexpectedly increases stability of ON 1910.Na,<br>
for example.<br>
Polyethylene glycols (PEGs) are preferred water soluble polymers. Low molecular<br>
weight liquid polyethylene glycols, for example, PEG 300, PEG 400, PEG 600, and PEG 800,<br>
are preferred water soluble polymers that can be used independently or in combination with<br>
each other, for example, in formulations of the present invention. Particularly preferred are<br>

omega-hydroxy- (CAS No: 25322-68-3)), e.g., Lutrol® E 400, is most preferred.<br>
Compositions of the present invention are preferred wherein the water soluble<br>
polymer is selected from the group consisting essentially of PEG 300, PEG 400, PEG 600,<br><br>
and PEG 800. Although not specifically listed here PEG products substantially the same,<br>
otherwise within this characteristic range of PEG entities, may be employed in compositions<br>
of the present invention.<br>
Aqueous compositions for parenteral administration of a compound described herein,<br>
or a pharmaceutically effective salt, prodrug, or metabolite thereof, are provided which<br>
comprise at least about 50% by weight of at least one water soluble polymer. Aqueous<br>
compositions of the present invention preferably have a pH within the range of about pH 8 to<br>
about pH 10. Aqueous compositions of the present invention generally comprise an effective<br>

(7.2), BES(7.26), MOPS (7.31), TES (7.61), TRIS (8.06), Ethanolamine (9.5), and buffers<br>
otherwise known and used in the art of parenteral formulations. A preferred buffer for use in<br>
compositions of the present invention is phosphate. Buffers, however, may contain an<br>
additional tonicity agent to make the formulation isoosmotic. Examples of tonicity agents<br>
include sodium chloride, mannitol, glucose, dextrose, and similar agents known in the art.<br>
Aqueous compositions of the present invention that have a higher pH, e.g., about 10,<br>
generally provide for higher stability of the compounds described herein. Aqueous<br>
compositions of the invention are preferred which comprise an effective amount of at least<br>
one compound described herein and at least about 60% by weight of at least one water soluble<br>
polymer. Aqueous compositions of the invention are also preferred which comprise an<br>

about 50% by weight of PEG 400.<br>
The results of formulation studies demonstrate that the stability of (E)-2,4,6-<br>
trimethoxystyryl-3-carboxymethylamino-4-methoxybenzylsulfone (ON 01910.Na), for<br>
example, is improved in the presence of PEG 400. The stability is further increased by<br>
increasing the pH of the aqueous phase to about 10, and furthermore if the aqueous phase is<br>
buffered. Based on the results from formulation development efforts, a 50% PEG-400<br>
formulation in apH 10 was determined to provide suitable stability under refrigeration.<br>
Formulations were prepared with about 75 mg/ml of drug substance in the final formulation.<br>
An example substantially stable formulation of (E)-2,4,6-trimethoxystyryl-3-<br>
carboxymethylamino-4-methoxybenzylsulfone (ON 01910.Na) containing 50% PEG-400 in<br>
0.016M phosphate buffer (Sodium Phosphate Dibasic), pH 10.0 is provided in Example II.<br>
The example formulation comprises 75 mg/ml (E)-2,4.6-trimethoxystyryl-3-<br>
carboxymethylamino-4-methoxybenzylsulfone (ON 01910.Na), 50% PEG-400 in 0.016 M<br>
phosphate buffer, pH 10. Dilution of this product 1:7 with 0.00025 M phosphoric acid, for<br>
example, yields a product that has a pH of 7.4 and osmolality of approximately 300<br>
mOsm/kg.<br>
Water, however, is not a necessary element to formulate compositions of the present<br>
invention. A dramatic stabilization effect is unexpectedly observed by lowering the dielectric<br>
constant of the formulation vehicle. See, Example III. A shelf stable formulation was<br>
developed, for example, based on 100% PEG-400 and is demonstrated herein to have<br>
significantly greater stability than conventional formulations. See, Example IV. Accordingly,<br>
preferred compositions of the present invention consist essentially of an effective amount of<br>
at least one compound described herein, and/or a pharmaceutically effective salt, prodrug, or<br>
metabolite thereof, and at least one water soluble polymer. Compositions of the present<br>
invention consist essentially of, for example, an effective amount of at least one compound<br>
described herein, and/or a pharmaceutically effective salt, prodrug, or metabolite thereof, and<br>
at least one water soluble polymer selected from the group consisting essentially of<br><br>
polyethylene glycol (PEG), poly-oxyethylene, poly-oxyethylene-poly-oxypropylene<br>
copolymers, polyglycerol, polyvinylalcohol, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), polyvinylpyridine<br>
N-oxide, copolymer of vinylpyridine N-oxide and vinylpyridine. Polyethylene glycols<br>
(PEGs), as discussed supra, are preferred water soluble polymers; particularly PEG 400.<br>
Accordingly, a preferred composition of the present invention consists essentially of an<br>
effective amount of at least one compound described herein, and/or a pharmaceutically<br>
effective amount of a salt, prodrug, or metabolite thereof, and PEG 400. Compounds<br>
described herein, e.g., ON 01910.Na, are preferably formulated with 100% PEG 400.<br>
Preferred compositions of the present invention comprise at least one amino-substituted (e)-<br>
2,6-dialkoxystyryl 4-substituted benzylsulfone, e.g., ON 01910.Na, and 100% PEG 400.<br>
A particularly preferred example composition of the present invention is 75mg of the<br>
sodium salt of (E)-2,4,6-trimethoxystyryl-3 -carboxymethylamino-4-methoxybenzylsulfone<br>
(ON 01910.Na) per ml in 100%PEG-400 (NF Grade). A single dose of the composition is<br>
generally within the range of about 1ml to about 3ml of the formulation. 1.5 ml of the sterile<br>
formulation, for example, is packaged in a sterile 5ml vial. This formulation comprises about<br>
6.5% wt of the sodium salt of (E)-2,4,6-trimethoxystyryl-3-carboxymethylamino-4-<br>
methoxybenzylsulfone (ON 01910.Na) /wt. in 100% PEG 400. (E)-2,4,6-trimethoxystyryl-3-<br>
carboxymethylamino-4-methoxybenzylsulfone (ON 01910.Na) injection composition, for<br>
example, is a clear yellow viscous solution. It is supplied as a non-aqueous solution intended<br>
for dilution with suitable parenteral diluent prior to infusion. Each ml of sterile non-<br>
pyrogenic solution contains 75 mg (E)-2,4,6-trimethoxystyryl-3-carboxymethylamino-4-<br>
methoxybenzylsulfone (ON 01910.Na) in Polyethylene Glycol, 400, NF and is stable at 40°C<br>
and below for at least 4 weeks.<br>
This formulation, however, is recently demonstrated to be shelf-stable for over one<br>
year.<br><br>
Safety and Efficacy of a Preferred Formulation of ON 01910.Na<br>
(Phase I clinical study)<br>
Safety and efficacy of this formulation, for example, is tested in a Phase I clinical<br>
study, at The Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, Baltimore, MD, i.e., "Phase I<br>
Dose Escalation Study Of ON 01910.Na By 2-Hour Intravenous Infusion In Patients With<br>
Advanced Solid Tumors". U.S. FDA IND #66,780. The objectives of this study include an<br>
identification of a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and a recommended dose for further<br>
clinical studies. A further object of the study is to establish a safety profile, i.e., to observe<br>
any toxicities. The patients in this study have advanced solid tumors that have failed<br>
conventional treatments, or for which no approved therapy exists. An object of the study is<br>
particularly to observe efficacy (anti-cancer effects).<br>
The patients are administered the preferred formulation described herein of the ON<br>
01910.Na drug (properly diluted in intravenous solution) over a two hour period, twice per<br>
week, for three weeks. The patients are subsequently observed for ten days, to constitute a<br>
four week treatment cycle. If the patients have no drug related toxicity and their disease does<br>
not progress, they can continue with additional cycles of therapy.<br>
This study started with a single patient at the first starting dose level of 80 mg per<br>
patient. If there is no grade 2 or worse drug-related toxicity (side effects) observed in the first<br>
four week cycle, then another patient may be dosed at the next higher dose level. The first<br>
patient was dosed at 80 mg per patient on August 3, 2004. Since then, seven patients have<br>
been enrolled and treated at escalating dose levels, that is, at 160, 320, 480, 800, 1280, and<br>
most recently 2080 mg per patient. In each case, there were no grade 2 or worse toxicities,<br>
recently, an eighth patient will soon be enrolled and will be treated at 3120 mg, for example.<br>
Current studies demonstrate that ON 01910.Na, for example, can be safely<br>
administered in this formulation, at least at doses up to 2080 mg given iv in a 2 hour infusion,<br>
twice per week, for 3 weeks, with subsequent ten days off, to constitute a four week cycle of<br>
treatment. Efficacy of this formulation, for example, has been observed in many mouse<br>
xenograft preclinical laboratory experiments.<br><br>
Accordingly, a preferred composition of the present invention comprises about 6% to<br>
about 7% wt. (E)-2,4,6-trimethoxystyryl-3-carboxymethylamino-4-methoxybenzylsulfone<br>
(ON 01910.Na) in 100%PEG-400 (NF Grade). Preferred compositions of the present<br>
invention comprise about 4% to about 10% wt. of at least one compound described herein,<br>
and/or a pharmaceutically effective amount of a salt, prodrug, or metabolite thereof, in<br>
100%PEG-400 (NF Grade). Particularly preferred compositions of the present invention<br>
comprise about 5% to about 8% wt. of at least one compound described herein, and/or a<br>
pharmaceutically effective amount of a salt, prodrug, or metabolite thereof, in 100%PEG-400<br>
(NF Grade). Preferred compositions of the present invention comprise about 6% to about 7%<br>
wt. of at least one compound described herein, and/or a pharmaceutically effective amount of<br>
a salt, prodrug, or metabolite thereof, in 100%PEG-400 (NF Grade).<br>
III. METHODS OF USE<br>
A method for the prevention and/or treatment of a pathophysiological condition is<br>
provided which comprises parenterally administering an effective amount of a composition of<br>
the present invention to a mammal. A method for the prevention and/or treatment of a<br>
pathophysiological condition mediated by abnormal cell growth is provided which comprises<br>
parenterally administering an effective amount of a composition of the present invention to a<br>
mammal. A method for the prevention and/or treatment of a pathophysiological condition<br>
mediated by abnormal cell growth is provided which comprises parenterally administering an<br>
effective amount of a composition of the present invention to a mammal in need of<br>
therapeutic intervention to control the pathophysiological condition and wherein abnormal<br>
cell growth is controlled.<br>
ON 1910 and other compounds described herein exhibit strong synergy, for example,<br>
with chemotherapeutic agents, often inducing complete regression of tumors.<br>
A method of inhibiting growth of tumor cells in an individual afflicted with cancer is<br>
provided comprising administering to said individual an effective amount of a composition of<br>
the present invention. Compositions of the present invention inhibit the proliferation of<br>
tumor cells by inducing cell death. Compositions described herein are particularly useful to<br>
kill primary or metastatic tumor or neoplastic cells in cancers of at least the following<br><br>
histologic subtypes: sarcoma (cancers of the connective and other tissue of mesodermal<br>
origin); melanoma (cancers deriving from pigmented melanocytes); carcinoma (cancers of<br>
epithelial origin); adenocarcinoma (cancers of glandular epithelial origin); cancers of neural<br>
origin (glioma/glioblastoma and astrocytoma); and hematological neoplasias, such as<br>
leukemias and lymphomas (e.g., acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic<br>
leukemia, and chronic myelocytic leukemia). Compositions of the present invention<br>
ieliminate primary or metastatic tumor or neoplastic cells in cancers having their origin in at<br>
least the following organs or tissues, regardless of histologic subtype: breast; tissues of the<br>
male and female urogenital system (e.g. ureter, bladder, prostate, testis, ovary, cervix, uterus,<br>
vagina); lung; tissues of the gastrointestinal system (e.g., stomach, large and small intestine,<br>
colon, rectum); exocrine glands such as the pancreas and adrenals; tissues of the mouth and<br>
esophagus; brain and spinal cord; kidney (renal); pancreas; hepatobiliary system (e.g., liver,<br>
gall bladder); lymphatic system; smooth and striated muscle; bone and bone marrow; skin;<br>
and tissues of the eye. The compositions are moreover useful in the treatment of non-cancer<br>
proliferative disorders. Non-cancer proliferative disorders are characterized by the<br>
uncontrolled growth of cells with a benign phenotype, meaning that the cells evade only the<br>
normal controls on growth, but cannot metastasize. Non-cancer proliferative disorders which<br>
may be treated with the present compounds include, but are not limited to, the following:<br>
hemangiomatosis in newborn; secondary progressive multiple sclerosis; chronic progressive<br>
myelodegenerative disease; neurofibromatosis; ganglioneuromatosis; keloid formation;<br>
Paget's Disease of the bone; fibrocystic disease (e.g., of the breast or uterus); sarcoidosis;<br>
Peronies and Duputren's fibrosis, cirrhosis, atherosclerosis and vascular restenosis.<br>
Tumor cells treated with compositions of the invention accumulate in the G2/M phase<br>
of the cell cycle. As the cells exit the G2/M phase, they appear to. undergo apoptosis.<br>
Treatment of normal cells with compositions of the present invention do not result in<br>
apoptosis.<br><br>
EXAMPLES<br>
EXAMPLE I<br>
Outline of synthesis to produce about 500 grams of ON 01910.Na for Phase I clinical<br>
trials<br>
1. (E)-2,4,6-Trimethoxystyryl-3,-nitro-4'-methoxybenzylsulfone (2) (TNMBS)<br>
One first condenses 2,4,6-trimethoxybenzaldehyde (TMBA) with 3-nitro-4-<br>
methoxybenzylsulfonylacetic acid (NBSA): To an appropriately sized glass reaction<br>
flask equipped with mechanical stirrer assembly, condenser, and gas inlet adapter for<br>
nitrogen charge 1.2 equivalents of 2,4,6-trimethoxybenzaldehyde. Begin agitation of<br>
the flask, and subsequently add a volume of toluene to the flask equal to 7 times the<br>
weight in grams of 3-nitro-4-methoxybenzylsulfonylacetic acid to be added. Charge<br>
the grams of acetic acid equivalent to 4 times the number of moles of NBSA<br>
multiplied by 102.09 g/mole. Finish raw material addition by adding 1.2 equivalents<br>
of NBSA. Begin condensation of the raw materials by heating the contents of the<br>
flask to reflux and maintain this reflux for a minimum of 5 hours until thin layer<br>
chromatography indicates that the TMBA is gone from the reaction mixture.<br>
Reaction workup and product isolation is then completed: Cool the reaction mixture<br>
to about 65°C and reduce the reaction volume to approximately 35% of the original<br>
. volume with the aid of a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure. To the empty<br>
reaction flask, charge a volume of ethanol equivalent to 7 times the grams of NBSA<br>
used in the reaction. Again start the stirrer and slowly add the reduced volume of the<br>
reaction mixture to the ethanol. The intermediate (2) precipitates and is stirred for a<br>
minimum of 1 hour. The resulting solids are filtered and the filter cake is washed<br>
with an appropriate amount of ethanol. The wet filter cake is first dried under vacuum<br>
for a minimum of 8 hours at 25°C followed by a subsequent drying period of at least 8<br>
hours at 50°C.<br><br>
Purification is accomplished in the following manner: To an appropriate sized flask<br>
equipped with agitator, condenser, and gas inlet adapter, one charges the crude product<br>
(2). A volume of ethyl acetate equivalent to 2 times the number of grams of NBSA used<br>
in the condensation reaction is subsequently added followed by a volume of acetonitrile<br>
equivalent to the number of grams of NBSA used in the condensation reaction. This<br>
mixture is stirred and heated to reflux for a minimum of 0.5 hours, and is subsequently<br>
cooled to ambient temperature for a minimum of 8 hours. The purified product is filtered,<br>
washed with ethyl acetate, and dried under vacuum at 50°C for a minimum of 12 hours.<br>
The yield of intermediate TNMBS (2) is about 33%.<br>
2.	(E)-2,4,6-Trimethoxystyryl-3'-amino-4'-methoxybenzylsulfone (3) (ON 01500)<br>
Reactants are charged to the reaction vessel to effect reduction: An appropriately<br>
sized reaction flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, gas inlet adapter and bubbler<br>
charge is used for the reduction reaction. One charges the reaction flask with 1<br>
equivalent of TNMBS followed by a volume (ml) of acetic acid equivalent to 10 times<br>
the weight of TNMBS used in the reaction. Agitation is then started. A weight of<br>
zinc powder (4.5 equivalents) is slowly added to the reactor in small portions so that<br>
the temperature is maintained at 40°C ± 5°C. The reaction is continued at this<br>
temperature until thin layer chromatography indicates that the TNMBS reactant has<br>
been consumed. The reaction is then terminated.<br>
Product isolation follows completion of the reaction: One filters the reaction mixture<br>
through a celite cake to remove unreacted zinc powder. This filter cake is washed<br>
with volumes of acetic acid and ethyl acetate in order to rinse product from the cake.<br>
As a separate operation, the filter cake is quenched with water and disposed to<br>
hazardous waste. The filtrate is concentrated on a rotary evaporator at about 40°C<br>
under vacuum to 30% of the original volume. Upon completion of this operation, a<br>
volume of water equivalent to 18 times the weight of TNMBS is added slowly to the<br>
reactor containing the concentrated filtrate. The reactor is cooled to about 10°C in<br>
preparation for neutralization of the acetate salt of the intermediate (3). The reaction<br>
mixture is basified with 10M sodium hydroxide solution to a pH of 7.5 to 8.5 while<br><br>
maintaining a temperature at or below 20°C. The free amine precipitates during this<br>
procedure and the resulting mixture is stirred for a minimum of 3 hours to complete<br>
the precipitation. One filters the resulting solids and rinses the crude product with<br>
water followed by heptane. The solids are dried in a vacuum oven at 25°C for at least<br>
8 hours. This is followed by an extended drying period of 8 hours at 50°C.<br>
Initial purification of the crude ON 01500 (3) is done using column chromatography<br>
with silica gel. Pack a large filter funnel with about 4000 grams of silica gel that has<br>
been slurried in dichloromethane. Weigh out a maximum of 850 grams of the crude<br>
ON 01500 and dissolve this in a minimum amount of dichloromethane. Carefully add<br>
the solution to the top of the silica gel column being careful not to disturb the silica<br>
gel bed. Cover with a piece of filter paper to prevent further disturbance. Elutethe<br>
mixture of intermediate and impurities with dichloromethane and collect fractions<br>
consistent with the purity of the crude ON 01500. Monitor each fraction by thin layer<br>
chromatography for ON 01500 content. Subsequently elute the material on the<br>
column with 1% methanol in dichloromethane, followed by 2% methanol, 3%<br>
methanol, and 5% methanol until all materials have been removed from the column.<br>
Dispose of the spent silica gel to waste. The fractions containing only ON 01500 are<br>
combined and concentrated using a rotary evaporator at a bath temperature or 35° C<br>
The crude ON 01500 (3) is further purified as follows: With the use of a rotary<br>
evaporator flask to facilitate agitation, crude (3) is slurried with a volume of ethyl<br>
acetate equivalent to 3 times the original weight of TNMBS (2). At ambient pressure<br>
and under rotating conditions, heat the flask to reflux the solution and maintain this<br>
operation for a minimum of 0.5 hours. Allow the solution to cool to room<br>
temperature while stirring for a minimum of 8 hours. Filter the solids and rinse the<br>
filter cake with additional ethyl acetate in order to remove mother liquor from the<br>
cake. Dry the purified product in a vacuum oven at 50°C under full vacuum for a<br>
minimum of 8 hours. The yield of ON 01500 is approximately 45% for this step of<br>
the process. The ON 01500 must have a purity of equal to or greater than 95% before<br>
proceeding to the next step.<br><br>
3.	Methyl-{N-[2-methoxy-5-methylene(2',4',6,-trimethoxystyrylsulfonyl)-<br>
phenyl]amino} acetate (4) (This is an intermediate ester to ON 01910 (naming is<br>
different))<br>
To an appropriately sized reaction flask equipped with stirrer and addition funnel, one<br>
adds ON 01500 (3) via the addition funnel. Sodium acetate (3 equivalents per equivalent<br>
of the intermediate) is then added followed by an amount of ethanol in milliliters<br>
equivalent to six times the weight of ON 01500. The reactor is purged of air using UHP<br>
nitrogen. Methyl bromoacetate (1.5 equivalents per equivalent of ON 01500) is added to<br>
the reactor followed by sodium iodide (1.1 equivalents per equivalent of ON 01500. The<br>
agitated reaction mixture is heated to reflux for a minimum of 4 hours. Reaction<br>
completion is monitored by thin layer chromatography. Upon reaction completion, the<br>
mixture is cooled to 60° C and the mixture is concentrated with a rotary evaporator at a<br>
bath temperature of 40° C to approximately 30% of its original volume.<br>
Isolation of the methyl ester (4) is then completed. The crude mixture is returned to<br>
the reaction flask and water (WFI grade) equivalent to 12 times the weight of ON<br>
01500 (3) used in the reaction is slowly added. The resulting slurry is agitated for a<br>
minimum of 8 hours. The resulting solids are filtered through a tabletop filter and a<br>
Teflon filter cloth. The filter cake is washed with additional WFI and heptane. The<br>
isolated methyl ester (4) is placed on drying pans, covered with aluminum foil and is<br>
dried in a vacuum oven for at least 8 hours at 50° C. Yield of this step is 70%.<br>
4.	{N-[2-methoxy-5-methylene(2',4',6'-trimethoxystyrylsulfonyl)phenyl]-amino}acetic<br>
acid Sodium salt (5) (ON 01910.Na)<br>
To a properly sized reaction flask equipped with agitator, condenser, and nitrogen<br>
bubbler is charged an appropriate amount of the methyl ester (4) produced in the<br>
above step. A volume of ethanol (ml) equivalent to 6.6 times the weight of (4) is<br>
added to the flask. The flask is purged with nitrogen and water (WFI) equivalent to<br>
3.3 times the weight of (4) is added. One adds 1.05 equivalents of sodium hydroxide<br>
pellets slowing to the reaction flask while it is being agitated. Agitation is continued<br><br>
for a minimum of 12 hours at ambient temperature. The completion of saponification<br>
is determined by the disappearance of (4) using thin layer chromatography. Once the<br>
reaction is complete, the mixture is filtered to remove miscellaneous solids and the<br>
filtrate is saved for isolation of the ON 01910 .Na (5).<br>
The product purification is carried out in the following manner. The filtrate from<br>
above is charged to a rotary evaporator, and the volume is reduced to approximately<br>
20% of its original volume with the aid of a bath set at 40° C. The contents remaining<br>
are charged to an appropriately sized reaction flask equipped with an agitator<br>
assembly using water (WFI) equivalent to 3 times the weight of methyl ester (4) to<br>
dissolve the crude (5) and facilitate the transfer. Methyl t-butyl ether (ml) equivalent<br>
to 4 times the weight of (4) is added and the reaction mixture is vigorously stirred for<br>
10 minutes. Agitation is stopped and the phases are allowed to partition for a<br>
minimum of 20 minutes. The organic phase is removed and the aqueous phase is<br>
further extracted twice in the manner described. The aqueous portion containing the<br>
product is filtered to remove miscellaneous solids and the solids are washed with<br>
additional WFI.<br>
Product isolation follows the purification procedure. The filtered aqueous solution is<br>
transferred to a rotary evaporator with a bath temperature of 40° C and the solvent is<br>
removed first at atmospheric pressure and then under high vacuum until the solids are<br>
dry and transferable (a minimum of 24 hours).<br>
Purification/crystallization of the ON 01910.Na (5) is done in the following way. The<br>
crude solid (5) from above is transferred under a nitrogen purge to a reaction flask<br>
with an agitator assembly and nitrogen feed. The crude (5) is transferred to the flask<br>
and WFI (ml) is added equivalent to 2.5 times the crude weight of (5). The resulting<br>
solution is heated to about 43° C and isopropanol is slowly added until the solution<br>
becomes cloudy and that cloudiness persists. (Approximately 12-15 ml/g of crude<br>
product is required). Continue agitation. If an oily residue is present, the solution<br>
may be filtered while hot and then promptly returned to the flask. Allow the solution<br>
to cool to ambient temperature while maintaining stirring for a minimum of 24 hours.<br><br>
One then filters the solids, washes them with isopropanol, and transfers them to<br>
drying pans for drying. The wet (5) is dried in a vacuum oven at ambient temperature<br>
for a minimum of 8 hours. Drying is continued at 70° C for an additional 8 hours.<br>
The final drug substance (5) is cooled to 25° C and an analytical sample is taken to<br>
determine the solvent content. Additional drying is done if the solvent content is<br>
above 0.5%. When (5) is completely dry, an analytical sample is again taken and the<br>
product is packaged. The yield is approximately 69% (if a second crop is taken from<br>
the mother liquor).<br><br><br><br>

propylene glycol or PEG 400, for example, to an aqueous formulation. The following tables<br>
summarizes the results:<br><br><br>
The stability of ON 01910.Na was further improved by adjusting the pH of the aqueous<br>

EXAMPLE VII<br>
Example Reaction Scheme (ON 01910.Na Clinical Material)<br>
Synthesis of the clinical trial quantity of ON 01910.Na carried out by ChemPacific Co.,<br>
USA, is described. The synthesis started with purchased 2,4,6,-trimethoxybenzaldehyde<br>
(Hunan Xinyu, Changsha, China) and 3-nitro-4-methoxybenzylsulfonylacetic acid<br>
(ChemPacific Co., Hangzhou, China). This latter starting material was qualified via<br>
ChemPacific Co., USA to be certain of quality. The synthesis was done under cGMP<br>
conditions. See, FIG.2.<br><br>
1.	(E)-2,4,6-Trimethoxystyryl-3'-nitro-4'-methoxybenzylsulfone (Compound C)<br>
A gentle stream of nitrogen was allowed to pass through a 22-liter glass reactor that was<br>
equipped with a mechanical stirrer assembly, a condenser, a thermometer, and a gas inlet<br>
adaptor. A quantity of 3-nitro-4-methoxybenzylsulfonylacetic acid (Compound A, 1775 g,<br>
6.14 atom molecule) and a quantity of 2,4,6-trimethoxybenzaldehyde (Compound B, 1200 g,<br>
6.12 atom molecule) were both charged to the reactor. Agitation was started as both 12 L of<br>
anhydrous toluene and 2448 g of acetic anhydride were charged slowly to the reactor. The<br>
suspension was stirred and heated to reflux for a minimum of 4 hours until thin layer<br>
chromatographic test indicated the total consumption of compound B was reached.<br>
The reaction mixture was cooled and filtered through a Buchner funnel. The filter cake was<br>
washed with 3 liter of hexane and subsequently dried under house vacuum (20 mmHg) for a<br>
minimum of 8 hours at 25°C, to yield first crop of product. The filtrate and washings were<br>
combined and further concentrated using a rotary evaporator (water bath was kept below 70 C<br>
and vacuum was measured at 20 mmHg) to give a product which then was taken into 3 liters<br>
of ethyl acetate and left standing at 0 C overnight. A solid was formed and the second crop of<br>
the product was collected by filtration. The filter cake was further rinsed with hexane (1L)<br>
then dried under vacuum for at least 8 hours at ambient temperature. Total combined product<br>
Compound C weighed 1350 g with a yield of 52%.<br>
2.	(E)-2,4,6-Trimethoxystyryl-3'-amino-4'-methoxybenzylsulfone (Compound D) (ON<br>
01500)<br>
To a 22-liter glass reactor equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a gas inlet<br>
adapter for protective nitrogen were introduced Compound C (925 g, 2.18 Mole) and acetic<br>
acid (10 L). The suspension was cooled below ambient temperature. Zinc powder (925 g,<br>
14.23 Mole) was slowly added to the reactor in small portions so that the temperature is<br>
maintained under ambient temperature °C. The reaction was continued at this temperature<br>
until thin layer chromatography indicated that Compound C was totally consumed.<br>
The crude mixture was filtered through a pad of celite and the filter cake was washed with 4<br>
liters of acetic acid. The combined filtrate and washings were mixed with cold water. The pH<br>
was brought to 3-8 with 25% of sodium hydroxide while maintaining a temperature at or<br><br>
below room temperature. The resulting precipitate stirred for a minimum of 3 hours before it<br>
was filtered. The filter cake was rinsed with hexane and the solid dried under a house vacuum<br>
for at least 8 hours. Compound D in its crude form weighed 725 g, 87% yield.<br>
The crude product (725 g, dissolved in dichloromethane) was first loaded to a column of<br>
silica gel pre-packed with 4000 g of silica gel powder. A filter paper was used to cover the<br>
silica gel bed to prevent disturbance cause by the addition of eluent. Thus dichloromethane<br>
was added slowly and fractions were collected. The TLC technique was used to monitor the<br>
content of Compound D in the fractions. Subsequent elution with 1%, 2%, 3% and 5%<br>
methanol in dichloromethane assured sufficient collection of the desired compound. The<br>
fractions containing Compound D were pooled and solvent evaporated using rotary<br>
evaporator. The water bath should not go beyond 35°C.<br>
The crude ON 01500 (Compound D) is further purified as follows: With the use of a rotary<br>
evaporator flask to facilitate agitation, the crude (Compound D) is slurried with a volume of<br>
ethyl acetate equivalent to 3 times the original weight of Compound C. At ambient pressure<br>
and under rotating conditions, heat the flask to reflux the solution and maintain this operation<br>
for a minimum of 0.5 h. Allow the solution to cool to room temperature while stirring for a<br>
minimum of 8 hours. Filter the solids and rinse the filter cake with additional ethyl acetate in<br>
order to remove mother liquor vacuum for a minimum of 8 hours. The yield of ON 01500 is<br>
approximately 45% for this step of the process. The ON 1500 must have a purity of equal to<br>
or greater than 95% before proceeding to the next step.<br>
The purity of the product can be still further improved by using the following procedure:<br>
Take 725 g of Compound D into 2 L of dichloromethane. Add 4 L of ethyl acetate.<br>
Concentrate the solvent to obtain a yellow precipitate. The resulting solid is further treated<br>
with either hot ethanol or isopropanol. Cooling the mixture to room temperature and filtering<br>
gave a light colored product (450 g, 52%) with purity more than 98.5%.<br>
3. (E)-2,4,6-Trimethoxystyryl 3-(carbomethoxymethylamino)-4-methoxybenzyl-sulfone<br>
(Compound E)<br>
To a solution of Compound D (ON-1500, 733 g, 1.86 mol) methanol (12 L) was added<br>
sodium acetate (751 g, 8.24 mol) and ethyl 2-bromoacetate (70 mL, 7.3 mol). The mixture<br><br>
was refluxed overnight and the reaction was monitored by thin layer chromatography<br>
(dichloromethane: EtOAc, 4:1). Upon completion of the reaction, the mixture was<br>
concentrated under reduced pressure and the residue was treated with hexane and ethyl<br>
acetate. An off-white solid product was collected by filtration to give Compound E (823 g,<br>
95%).<br>
4. (E)-2,4,6-Trimethoxystyryl 3-[(carboxymethyl)aminol-4- methoxybenzyl-sulfone,<br>
sodium salt (Compound F) This is the drug substance, ON 01910.Na<br>
Compound E (823 g, 1.77 mol) was treated with 20% sodium hydroxide (1840 mL) in<br>
methanol (15 L) at ambient temperature and the reaction was monitored by thin layer<br>
chromatography (chloroform:methanol:acetic acid=15:1:1). Upon the completion of the<br>
reaction, the mixture was concentrated to give a lightly colored crystal, which was filtered.<br>
The filter cake was treated with ethanol, THF, and diethylether, and the product was<br>
subsequently dried over house vacuum to give compound F as an off-white solid: weight, 550<br>
g; 65% and HPLC purity &gt; 98%.<br><br>
