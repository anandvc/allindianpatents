This invention relates to a process for produoing a synergestio pharmaceutical composition for enhancing haemoglobin synthesis and Zinc assimilation. This pharmaceutical composition consists of vitamins of the Group B, Vitamin C, three essential amino acids, necessary for haemoglobin synthesis metabolism and Zinc and iron salts which compliment: and assist in haemoglobin synthesis thereby promoting growth and reducing the rest of immunodeficiency.<br>
Vitamins are heterogenous organic compounds esential in small quantities for maintaining normal health, promoting growth and reducing the risk of infeotion. Human metabolic activity does not result in the synthesis of vitamins and as such they are to form a part of dietary intake regularly. Vitamins are either water soluble or oil soluble. Oil soluble vitamins are retained by the human system for a relatively longer period than the water soluble vitamins which are eliminated from the system easily. The need arises, therefore, to supplement the vitamins required by the system regularly. Most important water soluble vitamins belong to the vitamin 'B' group and vitamin %C. Deficiency of vitamin B group is known to oause weight loss, Pellagra, Neuromuscular disorders, Beri beri, anaemia and the like. Vitamin C is yet another water soluble vitamin which needs to be supplemented almost daily. Scurvy and anaemia may result if vitamin C is deficient in dietary Intake-  Further it has also<br><br>
been  established  that  a combination of vitamin C  and  iron enhances iron assimilation by the system.<br>
Proteins are complex nitrogen containing compounds formed mainly by amino aoid residues joined by peptide linkage. Complex proteins like glycoproteins, nucleo proteins, lipoproteins, chromo proteins and the like have residues of carbohydrates, fats and nuoleo acids conjugated with amino acid residues. Haemoglobin, the oxygen carrying protein present in red blood cells is a conjugate protein of Tour haemo groups which are organo metallic compounds containing iron. It is observed the diminution of the amount of total haemoglobin circulating in the blood stream results in anaemia. Absence of iron in food intake or improper assimilation of iron by the system causes anaemia. Growing children, women, nureiug mothers and oonvalesoents require more haemoglobin and their diets should be supplimented by iron containing compounds. Haemoglobin deficiency and resultant anaemia are more common in the developing and under-developed countries due to imbalanced intake of vitamins and minerals. Out of the twenty three amino acids generaly found in human metabolism, as building blocks for proteins, only eight are not produced by the system during metabolic activity. It has already been established that these eight amino aoids should find a place in the daily intake of food for maintaining proper growth and vitality.  Out of these  eight<br><br>
vital anino acids, three are found essential in haenoglobin synthesis metabolically. They are glycine, histidine and lysine. It has also been established that a composition of these three anino acids and an iron source increases the netabolic production of haenoglobin.<br>
Fron the above description it is clear that a conbination of the three anino aoids, vitanin B complex, vitamin C and a souroe of iron facilitates haenoglobin synthesis and easy assimilation of iron.<br>
Zinc is another essential trace element which plays a vital role in physiological processes. Many enzymes required for human netabolic activity are netallo enaynen having one or more inorganic elements as their constituents Zinc is found to be an important trace elenent that form a part of certain vital metallo enzymes involved in the metabolic pathways of synthesising carbohydrates, lipids and proteins. Zinc containing enzymes are also found to be beneficial in cell mediated immunity in convalescing patients. It is found that breast fed infants consume about 5 mg of zinc per day. During pregnancy and lactation increased intake of zinc is recommended. Zinc also is found to play a role in reducing hair fall and the process of aging in humans. We have now found that a combination of the three  amino acids that go in the making of haemoglobin, B group<br><br>
of vitamins, vitamin C, a source of iron and a source of zinc enhances haemoglobin synthesis and increases assimilation of thhe trace elements, iron and zinc, during metabolic activity. We have also found that such a composition exhibits properties fundamentally different from the compounding ingredients and shows reinforced properties as the different components compliment each other in enhancing haemoglobin synthesis in the increased assimilation of essential minerals like 2inc and iron. The composition is found to be a synergestic dietary supplement resulting in augmenting immunity, promoting growth and health.<br>
This invention provides a process for producing a synergestic pharmaceutical composition for enhancing haemoglobin synthesis and zinc assimilation which comprises blending the compounds listed hereinunder in the range specified thereagainst with known adjuvants and/or excipients.<br>
