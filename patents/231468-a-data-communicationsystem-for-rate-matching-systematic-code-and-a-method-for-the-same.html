				<td>A RATE MATCHING DEVICE AND METHOD FOR A DATA<br>
COMMUNICATION SYSTEM AND A METHOD FOR THE SAME<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to a channel encoding device and<br>
method for a data communication system, and in particular, to a device and method for<br>
rate matching of channel-encoded symbols.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Generally, in digital communication systems such as satellite systems, ISDN<br>
(Integrated Services Digital Network) systems, digital cellular systems, W-CDMA<br>
(Wideband Code Division Multiple Access) systems, UMTS (Universal Mobile<br>
Telecommunication Systems) and IMT-2000 (International Mobile Telecommunication-<br>
2000) systems, source user data is channel encoded with an error correction code before<br>
transmission in order to increase the reliability of the system. A convolution code and a<br>
linear block code are typically used for channel encoding, and, for the linear block code,<br>
a single decoder is used. Recently, in addition to such codes, a turbo code is also being<br>
widely used, which is useful for data transmission and reception.<br>
In multiple access communication systems which support multiple users and<br>
multi-channel communication systems with multiple channels, channel encoded symbols<br>
are matched to a given number of transmission channel symbols, in order to increase the<br>
efficiency of data transmission and to improve system performance. Such a process is<br>
called "rate matching" Rate matching is also performed to match the output symbol rate<br>
with the transmission symbol rate. Typical rate matching methods include puncturing or<br>
repeating parts of channel-encoded symbols.<br>
A conventional rate matching device is shown in FIG. I. Referring to FIG. 1, a<br>
channel encoder 100 encodes input information bits(k) at a coding rate R=k/n, and<br>
outputs encoded symbols(n). A multiplexer (MUX) 110 multiplexes the encoded<br><br>
symbols. A rate matching function 120 rate-matches the multiplexed encoded<br>
symbols by puncturing or repeating, and outputs the rate-matched symbols to a<br>
transmitter (not shown).. The channel encoder 100 operates at every period of a symbol<br>
clock having a speed of CLOCK, and the multiplexer 110 and the rate matching<br>
function 120 operate at every predetermined period of a clock, having a speed of<br>
nxCLOCK.<br>
It should be noted that the rate matching device of FIG. 1 is proposed to be<br>
applied to the case where a non-systematic code such as a convolution code or a linear<br>
block code is used for channel encoding. For symbols, channel-encoded with a non-<br>
systematic code such as a convolutional code or a linear block code, because there is no<br>
weight between symbols, i.e., since the error sensitivity of the encoded symbols output<br>
from the channel encoder 100 is similar for every symbol within one frame, it is possible<br>
that the symbols encoded by the channel encoder 100 are provided to the rate matching<br>
function 120 without distinction and undergo puncturing or repeating, as shown in<br>
FIG. 1.<br>
However, when using systematic codes, such as a turbo code, there is weight<br>
between symbols, so it is not good for the channel encoded symbols that are provided to<br>
the rate matching function 120 to equally undergo puncturing or repeating. Because<br>
the weight is not equal between information symbols and parity symbols, it is<br>
recommended to the rate matching function 120 can puncture parity symbols out of<br>
the turbo-encoded symbols, but should not puncture the information symbols. As an<br>
alternativecase, the rate matching function 120 can repeat the information symbols<br>
out of the turbo-encoded symbols to increase the energy of the symbols, but should not<br>
repeat the parity symbols, if possible. That is, it is difficult to use the rate matching<br>
device of FIG. 1 when a turbo code is being used. This is natural in the light of the facts<br>
that the structure of FIG. 1 is available for only non-systematic codes such as<br>
convolutional codes or linear block codes, and the turbo code has new properties<br>
different from those of the convolution codes and the linear block codes.<br>
Recently, to solve such a problem, a method has been proposed for rate<br>
matching the symbols channel-encoded with the turbo code. However, such a method<br>
can be used only when rate matching the turbo-encoded symbols, and cannot be used<br>
when rate matching the symbols channel-encoded with the existing convolutional codes<br>
or linear block codes.<br>
Therefore, there is a need for a single device and method for rate matching both<br><br>
symbols channel-encoded with existing non-systematic code and symbols channel-<br>
encoded with systematic code. For example, a data communication system designed to<br>
support both non-systematic code and systematic code requires two different structures<br>
in order to rate match both codes, causing an increase in complexity. However, if it is<br>
possible to rate match the different codes using a single structure, the complexity of<br>
implementation will be reduced.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a device and<br>
method for rate matching both symbols channel-encoded with a non-systematic code and<br>
symbols channel-encoded with a systematic code, using a single structure, in a data<br>
communication system.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a device and method for<br>
selectively rate matching symbols channel-encoded with a non-systematic code or<br>
symbols channel-encoded with a systematic code in a data communication system<br>
supporting both non-systematic code and systematic code.<br>
It is further another object of the present invention to provide a device and<br>
method for rate matching channel-encoded symbols to increase the efficiency of data<br>
transmission and to improve system performance in a data communication system.<br>
To achieve the above and other objects, a device and method for matching a rate<br>
of channel-encoded symbols in a data communication system is proposed. The rate<br>
matching device and method can be applied to a data communication system which uses<br>
one or both of a non-systematic code (convolutional code or linear block code) and a<br>
systematic code (turbo code). The rate matching device includes a plurality of rate<br>
matching functions, the number of the rate matching functions being equal to<br>
a reciprocal of the coding rate of the channel encoder. The rate matching device can rate<br>
match the symbols encoded with a non-systematic code or the symbols encoded with a<br>
systematic code, by changing initial parameters including the number of input symbols,<br>
the number of output symbols, and the puncturing/repetition pattern determining<br>
parameters.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described herein below<br>
with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following description, well-known<br>
functions or constructions are not described in detail since they would obscure the<br>
invention in unnecessary detail.<br>
Conditions Required When Designing a Rate Matching Device<br>
First, before describing the invention, reference will be made to conditions<br><br>
which should be considered when rate mating symbols channel-encoded with a non-<br>
systematic code such as a convolutional code or a linear block code (in the description<br>
below, the non-systematic code is assumed to be a convolutional code). Conditions 1A<br>
to 3A below are the conditions which should be considered when rate matching encoded<br>
symbols by puncturing, and Conditions 1C and 2C below are the conditions which<br>
should be considered when rate matching encoded symbols by repeating.<br>
Condition 1A: An input symbol sequence, being encoded symbols, should be<br>
punctured using a puncturing pattern having a specific period.<br>
Condition 2A: The number of punctured bits out of the input symbols should be<br>
minimized, if possible.<br>
Condition 3A: A uniform puncturing pattern should be used such that the input<br>
symbol sequence, which is encoded symbols output from an encoder, should be<br>
uniformly punctured.<br>
Condition 1C: An input symbol sequence, being encoded symbols, should be<br>
repeated using a repetition pattern having a specific period.<br>
Condition 2C: A uniform repetition pattern should be used such that the input<br>
symbol sequence, which is encoded symbols output from an encoder, should be<br>
uniformly repeated.<br>
These conditions are based on the assumption that the error sensitivity of the<br>
symbols output from the encoder using a convolutional code is almost the same for every<br>
symbol within one frame (or codeword). Actually, it is known that when the above<br>
conditions are used as main limitation factors in performing puncturing for rate matching,<br>
affirmative results are obtained as shown by the following references: [1J G. D. Forney.<br>
"Convolutional codes I: Algebraic structure," IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory, vol. IT-16.<br>
pp.720-738. Nov. 1970, [2] J. B. Cain, G. C. Clark, and J. M. Geist, "Punctured<br>
convolutional codes of rate (n-l)/n and simplified maximum likelihood decoding," IEEE<br>
Trans. Inform. Theory, vol. IT-25, pp.97-100, Jan. 1979.<br>
Next, reference will be made to the conditions which should be considered<br>
when rate matching symbols channel-encoded with a systematic code (in the description<br><br>
below, the systematic code will be assumed to be a turbo code). Conditions IB to 5B<br>
below are the conditions which should be considered when rate matching the encoded<br>
symbols by puncturing, and Conditions ID to 5D are the conditions which should be<br>
considered when rate matching the encoded symbols by repeating.<br>
Condition IB: Since a turbo code is a systematic code, the portion<br>
corresponding to information symbols out of the symbols encoded by the encoder should<br>
not be punctured. Moreover, for the further reason that an iterative decoder is used as a<br>
decoder for the turbo code, the portion corresponding to the information symbols should<br>
not be punctured.<br>
Condition 2B: Since a turbo encoder is comprised of two component encoders<br>
connected in parallel, it is preferable to maximize the minimum free distance of each of<br>
the two component encoders, for the minimum free distance of the whole code.<br>
Therefore, in order to obtain optimal performance, the output parity symbols of the two<br>
component encoders should be uniformly punctured.<br>
Condition 3B: In most iterative decoders, since decoding is performed from the<br>
first internal decoder, the first output symbol of the first component decoder should not<br>
be Punctured. In other words, the first symbol of an encoder should not be punctured<br>
regardless of whether it is a systematic or parity bits, because the first symbol indicates<br>
the starting point of encoding.<br>
Condition 4B: The output parity symbols of each component encoder should be<br>
punctured using a uniform puncturing pattern such that the encoded symbols output from<br>
the encoder, such as the existing convolutional code, should be uniformly punctured.<br>
Condition 5B: Termination tail bits used for the turbo encoder should not be<br>
punctured because of the. detrimental effect on the performance of the decoder. For<br>
example, a SOVA (Soft Output Viterbi Algorithm) decoder has low performance when<br>
the termination tail bits are punctured, as compared with the case where the termination<br>
tail bits are not punctured.<br>
Condition 1D: Since a turbo code is a systematic code, a portion corresponding<br>
to information symbols out of the symbols encoded by the encoder should be repeated to<br>
increase the energy of the symbols. Moreover, since an iterative decoder is used as a<br>
decoder for the turbo code, the portion corresponding to the information symbols should<br><br>
be frequently repeated.<br>
Condition 2D: Since a turbo encoder is comprised of two component encoders<br>
connected in parallel, it is preferable to maximize the minimum free distance of each of<br>
the two component encoders, for the minimum free distance of the whole code.<br>
Therefore, when the parity symbols are repeated, the output parity symbols of the two<br>
component encoders should be uniformly repeated in order to obtain optimal<br>
performance.<br>
Condition 3D: In most iterative decoders, since decoding is performed from the<br>
first internal decoder, the first output symbol of the first component decoder should be<br>
preferentially repeated when the parity symbols are repeated.<br>
Condition 4D: The output parity symbols of each component encoder should be<br>
repeated using a uniform repetition pattern such that the encoded symbols output from<br>
the encoder, such as the existing convolution code, should be uniformly repeated.<br>
Condition 5D: Termination tail bits used for the turbo encoder should be<br>
repeated because of the effect on the performance of the decoder. For example, a SOVA<br>
(Soft Output Viterbi Algorithm) decoder has different performance according to whether<br>
the termination tail bits are repeated or not.<br>
The present invention aims to implement a rate matching device which satisfies<br>
not only Conditions 1A-3A and 1C-2C but also Conditions 1B-5B and 1D-5D. That is. a<br>
rate matching device by puncturing according to the present invention serves as a rate<br>
matching device, which satisfies Conditions 1A to 3A, for convolutionally-encoded<br>
symbols, and also serves as a rate matching device, which satisfies Conditions 1B to 5B,<br>
for turbo-encoded symbols. The rate matching device by repeating according to the<br>
present invention serves as a rate matching device, which satisfies Conditions 1C to 2C.<br>
for convolutionally-encoded symbols, and also serves as a rate matching device, which<br>
satisfies Conditions 1D to 5D. for turbo-encoded symbols.<br>
Fundamental Structure of the Rate Matching Device<br>
Embodiments of rate matching device structures according to the present<br>
invention are shown in FIGS. 2 and 3. More specifically, FIG. 2 shows an example of a<br><br>
rate matching device implemented in hardware according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention, and FIG. 3 shows an example of a rate matching device implemented<br>
in software according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2. a channel encoder 200 channel encodes input information<br>
bits at a coding rate R=k/n, and outputs encoded symbols. Here, n denotes the number of<br>
encoded symbols constituting one codeword, and k denotes the number of input<br>
information bits constituting one input information word. There are n rate matching<br>
functions 23 1-239, each of which separately receive encoded symbols, output from<br>
the channel encoder 200, by a number of input symbols determined according to the<br>
coding rate, and puncture/repeat the received symbols. The n rate matching<br>
functions 231-239 each separately receive the encoded symbols, output from the<br>
channel encoder 200, by the number determined by multiplying the number of the<br>
encoded symbols in a frame by the coding rate. For example, if the number of encoded<br>
symbols in one frame is 10 and the coding rate is R=l/5, the 5 rate matching<br>
functions each separately receive 2 symbols. The rate matching functions<br>
231-239 each puncture the received symbols according to a predetermined puncturing<br>
pattern or repeat the received symbols according to a predetermined repeating<br>
repetition pattern. A multiplexer 240 multiplexes the rate-matched symbols from<br>
the rate matching kteekfunctions 231-239, and outputs the multiplexed symbols to a<br>
channel transmitter (not shown). Since the channel transmitter is beyond the scope of the<br>
present invention, a detailed description of the channel transmitter will be avoided herein.<br>
The rate matching operation of the rate matching b4eekfunctions 231-239 will become<br>
more apparent from the following detailed description of the embodiments of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, a channel encoder 200 channel encodes input information<br>
bits at a coding rate R=k/n, and outputs the encoded symbols. A digital signal processor<br>
(DSP) 250 having a rate matching module, performs rate matching (or<br>
puncturing/repeating) on the symbols channel-encoded by the channel encoder 200.<br>
using the rate matching module. The symbols rate-matched by the DSP 250 arc output to<br>
the channel transmitter. The rate matching DSP 250 separately receives the encoded<br>
symbols of one frame from n separate data streams, where the number of symbols<br>
received from each stream equals the number of the input symbols determined according<br>
to the coding rate, and punctures/repeats the received symbols, in the same manner as<br>
shown in FIG. 2. In other words, although the DSP 250 is a single element in hardware.<br><br>
it performs the same rate matching operation as the n rate matching functions of<br>
FIG. 2. The DSP 250 may also be implemented by a CPU (Central Processing Unit), and<br>
the rate matching operation may be implemented by a subroutine. When the term "rate<br>
matching functions" is used herein, it is intended to refer to the rate matching<br>
modules in DSP 250 as well.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 2 and 3, a rate matching device according to the present<br>
invention may have a structure that includes as many rate matching functions as the<br>
number corresponding to the coding rate (i.e., a reciprocal of the coding rate when k=l,<br>
but if k=l then the number of the rate matching functions may be equal to a<br>
reciprocal of the coding rate multiplied by k), and each rate matching function<br>
receives as many symbols as the number determined by multiplying the number of the<br>
encoded symbols in a frame by the coding rate, and punctures the received symbols<br>
according to a predetermined puncturing pattern or repeats the received symbols<br>
according to a predetermined repetition pattern. This structure has the feature that the<br>
channel encoded symbols are separately processed, while the conventional rate matching<br>
device of FIG. 1 processes the channel-encoded symbols in a frame unit. The rate<br>
matching device modified according to the present invention can be used for both<br>
convolutional codes and turbo codes. That is, a rate matching device according to the<br>
present invention has a single structure that can be applied to both convolutional codes<br>
and turbo codes, even though two different sets of conditions are required.<br>
A rate matching device according to the present invention may also have a<br>
structure of FIG. 8. This rate matching device has a combined structure of the<br>
conventional rate matching device of FIG. 1 and the novel rate matching device of FIGS.<br>
2 and 3. Including a single rate matching function. the rate matching device has a<br>
low complexity, even though implemented by hardware.<br>
Referring to FIG. 8, a channel encoder 200 channel encodes input information<br>
bits at a coding rate R=k/n, and outputs the encoded symbols. The encoded symbols are<br>
multiplexed by a multiplexer 260, and the multiplexed encoded symbols are output to a<br>
rate matching function 230. The symbols rate-matched by the rate matching<br>
function 230 by puncturing/repeating are transmitted to a channel transmitter. A<br>
RAM (Random Access Memory) 270 stores an initial value received during rate<br>
matching performed by the rate matching function 230, and provides the initial<br>
value to the rate matching function 230. The channel encoder 200 operates at every<br><br>
period of the symbol clock having a speed of CLOCK, and the multiplexer 260 and the<br>
rate matching f'unction 230 operate at a predetermined period of a clock having a<br>
speed of nxCLOCK. The initial value provided to the RAM 270 includes input symbol<br>
number Nc, output symbol number Ni, error value "e\ and puncturing/repeating<br>
petition pattern determining parameters 'a' and "b\ The number of symbols to<br>
be punctured for every frame of the encoded symbols is determined by the input symbol<br>
number Nc and the output symbol number Ni. The RAM 270 stores input symbol<br>
number Nc corresponding to each symbol clock in a predetermined period, output<br>
symbol number Ni, error value 'e\ and puncturing/repeating patternrepetition pattern<br>
determining parameters 'a' and 'b\ When rate matching is performed by puncturing, the<br>
rate matching function 230 receives the corresponding input symbol number Nc,<br>
output symbol number Ni, error value 'e\ and puncturing pattern determining<br>
parameters 'a' and "b\ stored in the RAM 270, at every symbol clock period, to<br>
determine whether the particular symbol being processed at every symbol clock period<br>
needs to be punctured, and performs puncturing according to the corresponding<br>
puncturing pattern. When rate matching is performed by repeating, the rate matching<br>
function 230 receives the corresponding input symbol number Nc, output symbol<br>
number Ni, error value 'e\ and repetition pattern determining parameters "a* and *bstored in the RAM 270, at every symbol clock period, to determine whether the<br>
particular symbol being processed at every symbol clock period needs to be punctured,<br>
and performs repeating according to the corresponding repetition pattern.<br>
When a convolutional code or a linear block code is used in the channel encoder<br>
200, the initial value is set to a specific puncturing/repeating parameter (Nc,Ni,e«b.a) in<br>
the RAM 270. That is. the rate matching Weekfunction (RMB) 230 operates as shown in<br>
FIG. 1, without updating the RAM 270.<br>
When a turbo code is used in the channel encoder 200, the rate matching<br>
function 230 should sequentially operate from RMB1 to RMBn (each RMBx [x = 1<br>
to n] is associated with a set of values for Nc, Ni. e, b and a) at every symbol clock<br>
period designated as period 'n' (i.e.. period n = the period of a clock having a speed of<br>
CLOCK). In other words, at every period of a clock having the speed of n x CLOCK,<br>
the rate matching b4e6kfunction 230 is updated with the values for Nc, Ni, e. a and b<br>
from one of the RMBx[x = 1 to n]. Thus, for every period of n, the rate matching<br>
function 230 is updated with the values for Nc, Ni, e, b and a from each of the<br>
RMBx. For example, during one period of l/(n x CLOCK), the rate matching<br><br>
function 230 may receive the values for Nc, Ni, e, a and b from RMB1 and then<br>
receive the values for Nc, Ni, e, a and b from RMB2 on the next period of l/(n x<br>
CLOCK) and so on, until the values from RMBn is received by the rate matching<br>
function 230. The same cycle is then again repeated in next period n".. Therefore,<br>
state values of RMBx processed at a certain time point, i.e., the parameter values<br>
(Nc,Ni,e,b,a) for determining the symbols and the patterns for puncturing/repeating, are<br>
stored in the RAM 270 for the process at the next time point. Therefore, if this value is<br>
used when the RMBx is processed again next time, it is possible to perform operation of<br>
n RMBs( RMBl-RMBn )using a single RMB. For a processing rate, since nxCL,OCK is<br>
used as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the complexity will not be increased.<br>
Meanwhile, in FIG. 2, the rate matching functions 231-239 each separately<br>
receive as many symbols encoded by the channel encoder 200 as the number determined<br>
by multiplying the number of encoded symbols in a frame by the coding rate. However,<br>
it should be noted that each of the rate matching functions 231-239 can also<br>
separately receive a different number of the symbols encoded by the channel encoder 200.<br>
For example, one of the rate matching functions 231 -239 could separately receive a<br>
number of encoded symbols which is smaller than the number determined by multiplying<br>
the number of the encoded symbols in a frame by the coding rate, and another rate<br>
matching function could separately receive a number of encoded symbols which is<br>
larger than the number determined by multiplying the number of the encoded symbols in<br>
a frame by the coding rate. However, for simplicity, we will describe a case where each<br>
of the rate matching bleekfunctions 231-239 separately receive the same number of<br>
symbols encoded by the channel encoder 200.<br>
Embodiments of the Rate Matching Device<br>
A description will now be made of the rate matching device according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. Herein, for convenience, the description will be<br>
made on the assumption that the coding rate is R=l/3 and 3 rate matching bleekfunctions<br>
are provided. However, it should be noted that the rate matching device according to the<br>
present invention applies to any case where there are n rate matching bleekfunctions, i.e.,<br>
the coding rate is R=k/n. Further, in the description below, Ncs indicates the total<br>
number of the encoded symbols included in one frame, output from the channel encoder.<br>
Nc indicates the number of symbols input into each rate matching bleekfunction, and the<br>
number of the input symbols is determined as Nc=RxNcs. In the following description.<br><br>
RxNcs=l/3xNcs=Ncs/3. Ni indicates the number of symbols output from each rate<br>
matching function, and the number of output symbols is determined as N'r-RxNis,<br>
which is Nis/3 in the description, where Nis indicates the total number of the symbols<br>
output after rate matching process. That is, Nis is the total number of the symbols output<br>
from the respective rate matching functions. Therefore, the number of symbols<br>
(bits) to be punctured/repeated by each rate matching function is determined y<br>
y=Nc-Ni. The Nc value and Ni value can vary.<br>
Further, the invention uses the parameters 'a' and 'b\ which are integers<br>
determined according to a puncturing/repetition pattern within one frame, i.e.. integers<br>
for determining the puncturing/repetition pattern. The parameter "a' is an offset value for<br>
determining the position of the first symbol in the puncturing/repetition pattern. That is,<br>
the parameter "a' determines which one of the encoded symbols included in one frame is<br>
to be taken as the first symbol of the puncturing/repetition pattern. If a value of the<br>
parameter 'a' increases, a symbol located at the front of the frame will be<br>
punctured/repeated. The parameter 'b' is a value for controlling the puncturing or<br>
repeating period in the frame. By varying this parameter value, it is possible to<br>
puncture/repeat all the encoded symbols included in the frame.<br>
As described above, a rate matching device according to the present invention<br>
can perform rate matching not only by puncturing but also by repeating. The description<br>
of a rate matching device according to the present invention is divided into a device for<br>
performing rate matching by puncturing and a device for performing rate matching by<br>
repeating.<br>
A. Embodiments of the Rate Matching Device by Puncturing<br>
1. Embodiment of the Rate Matching Device by Puncturing (for a<br>
Convolutional Code)<br>
FIG. 4 shows the structure of a rate matching device by puncturing according to<br>
an embodiment of the present invention. This structure is used when the rate matching<br>
devices of FIG. 2 and 3 rate match convolutional-encoded symbols by puncturing.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, a convolutional encoder 210 encodes input information bits<br>
Ik at a coding rate R= 1/3, and outputs encoded symbols C1 k, C2k and C3k. The encoded<br>
symbols C1 k. C2k. and C3k are separately provided to rate matching functions 231.<br><br>
232 and 233. respectively. The first rate matching function 231 punctures the<br>
encoded symbol Clk. At this point, the puncturing process is performed based on the<br>
punctured symbol number y=Nc-Ni. which is determined by the input symbol number<br>
Nc and the output symbol number Mi, and the puncturing pattern determining parameters<br>
"a" and 'b'. For example, the first rate matching bleekfunction 231 can output the<br>
symbols of "...1 lxlOxOlx- (where x indicates a punctured symbol). The second rate<br>
matching function 232 punctures the encoded symbol C2k. At this point, the<br>
puncturing process is performed based on the punctured symbol number y=Nc-Ni, which<br>
is determined by the input symbol number Nc and the output symbol number Ni, and the<br>
puncturing pattern determining parameters 'a" and 'b'. For example, the second rate<br>
matching function 232 can output the symbols of '•■•! 1x1 IxlOx•■•' (where x<br>
indicates a punctured symbol). The third rate matching bleekfunction 233 punctures the<br>
encoded symbol C3k. At this point, the puncturing process is performed based on the<br>
punctured symbol number y=Nc-Ni, which is determined by the input symbol number<br>
Nc and the output symbol number Ni, and the puncturing pattern determining parameters<br>
"a" and 'b'. For example, the third rate matching b+eekfunction 233 can output the<br>
symbols of "•••01x1 lxl lx--" (where x indicates a punctured symbol). The encoded<br>
symbols rate-matched by the rate matching functions 231, 232 and 233 are<br>
multiplexed by a multiplexer 240 (not shown in FIG. 4) and provided to a channel<br>
transmitter.<br>
In FIG. 4, the input symbol number Nc and the output symbol number Ni are<br>
equally determined as Nc=RxNcs and Ni=RxNis, respectively, for every rate matching<br>
function. Each rate matching function separately punctures the same number<br>
of the channel-encoded symbols, on the assumption that the error sensitivity of encoded<br>
symbols is almost the same for every symbol in one frame. That is, an almost uniform<br>
puncturing pattern is provided within one frame regardless of the various punctured bit<br>
numbers determined according to the service type. This is because it is possible that all<br>
of the symbols in one frame can be uniformly punctured for the convolution code.<br>
Therefore, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
symbols encoded by the convolution encoder 210 are separated and provided in the same<br>
number to the rate matching functions 231, 232 and 233. The rate matching<br>
bleekfunctions 321. 232 and 233 each puncture the same number of the input symbols.<br>
At this point, the puncturing pattern parameters can be determined either equally or<br>
differently. That is. the puncturing patterns can be determined either equally or<br><br>
differently for the rate matching functions 231, 232 and 233.<br>
2. Another Embodiment of the Rate Matching Device by Puncturing (for<br>
Turbo Code)<br>
FIG. 5 shows a structure of a rate matching device by puncturing according to<br>
another embodiment of the present invention. This structure is used when the rate<br>
matching devices of FIG. 2 and 3 rate match the turbo-encoded symbols by puncturing.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, a turbo encoder 220 encodes input information bits Ik at a<br>
coding rate R=l/3, and outputs encoded symbols Clk, C2k and C3k. Among the<br>
encoded symbols, the information symbol Clk is separately provided to a first rate<br>
matching function 231, and the parity symbols (or redundancy symbols) C2k and<br>
C3k are separately provided to second and third rate matching functions 232 and<br>
233, respectively. The turbo encoder 220 is comprised of a first component encoder 222.<br>
a second component encoder 224 and an interleaver 226, as shown in FIG. 6. The<br>
structure of the turbo encoder 220 is well known by those skilled in the art. Thus, a<br>
detailed description will be avoided. The input X(t) to the turbo encoder 220 corresponds<br>
to the input information bits Ik shown in FIG. 5. Outputs X(t), Y(t) and Y'(t) of the turbo<br>
encoder 220 correspond to the encoded symbols Clk, C2k and C3k shown in FIG. 5,<br>
respectively. For the first output of the turbo encoder 220, the input information bits<br>
Ik=X(t) are output at as they are, so that, in FIG. 5, the input information bits Ik are<br>
output as Clk.<br>
The first rate matching function 231 punctures the encoded symbols Clk<br>
based on the following criteria. Since the coding rate is R=l/3, the input symbol number<br>
Nc is determined as Nc=RxNcs=Ncs/3, which is 1/3 the total number of encoded<br>
symbols. The output symbol number Ni is also determined as Ni=RxNcs. because<br>
puncturing is not performed on the portion corresponding to the information symbols<br>
according to Condition IB. The puncturing pattern determining parameters 'a' and "b'<br>
can be set to an integer but it is no meaning, since puncturing is not performed according<br>
to Condition IB. For example, the first rate matching function 231 may output the<br>
symbols of'-l II10101 I-'.<br>
The second rate matching function 232 punctures the encoded symbols<br>
C2k based on the following criteria. Since the coding rate is R=l/3, the input symbol<br>
number Nc is determined as Nc=RxNcs=Ncs/3, which is 1/3 the total number of encoded<br><br>
symbols. Because the output parity symbols of the two component decoders should be<br>
uniformly punctured according to Condition 2B and Condition 4B, and the total output<br>
symbol number after puncturing is Nis for the total input symbols(Ncs) in one frame, the<br>
number Ni of symbols output from the second rate matching function 232 after<br>
puncturing is Ni=[Nis-(RxNcs)]/2. If Ni=[Nis-(RxNcs)]/2 is an odd number, the output<br>
symbol number becomes Ni=[Nis-(RxNcs)+l]/2 or [Nis-(RxNcs)-l]/2. One of the two<br>
values is selected according to the relationship between the second rate matching<br>
function 232 and the third rate matching function 233. That is, when the<br>
output symbol number of the second rate matching function 232 is determined as<br>
[Nis-(RxNcs)+l J/2, the output symbol number of the third rate matching function<br>
233 is determined as [Nis-(RxNcs)-l]/2. On the contrary, when the output symbol<br>
number of the second rate matching function 232 is determined as [Nis-(RxNcs)-<br>
1 J/2, the output symbol number of the third rate matching function 233 is<br>
determined as [Nis-(RxNcs)+l]/2.<br>
The puncturing pattern determining parameters 'a' and ;b" can be selected as<br>
integers according to a desired puncturing pattern. These integers are determined<br>
according to the puncturing pattern only, and the parameters can be set to b=l and a=2.<br>
A detailed description of a method for determining the integers for the puncturing pattern<br>
determining parameters will be made with reference to the tables which are given below.<br>
For example, the second rate matching function 232 may output the symbols of<br>
'•••1 lxl lxlOx--" (where x indicates a punctured symbol).<br>
The third rate matching function 233 punctures the encoded symbols C3k<br>
based on the following criteria. Since the coding rate is R=l/3, the input symbol number<br>
Nc is determined as Nc=RxNcs=Ncs/3. which is 1/3 the total number of input<br>
symbols(encoded symbols). Because the total output parity symbols of the two<br>
component decoders should be uniformly punctured according to Condition 2B and<br>
Condition 4B, and the total output symbol number after puncturing is Nis for the total<br>
input symbols in one frame, the number Ni of the symbols output from the second rate<br>
matching function 232 after puncturing is Ni=[Nis-(RxNcs)]/2. If Ni=Nis-(RxNcs)<br>
is an odd number, the output symbol number becomes Ni=[Nis-(RxNcs)+l]/2 or [Nis-<br>
(RxNcs)-1]/2. One of the two values is selected according to the relationship between<br>
the second rate matching function 232 and the third rate matching function<br>
233. That is, when the output symbol number of the second rate matching function<br><br>
232 is determined as [Nis-(RxNcs)+l]/2, the number of output symbols of the third rate<br>
matching function 233 is determined as [Nis-(RxNcs)-l]/2. On the contrary, when<br>
the output symbol number of the second rate matching function 232 is determined<br>
as [Nis-(RxNcs)-l]/2, the output symbol number of the third rate matching<br>
function 233 is determined as [Nis-(RxNcs)+l |/2.<br>
The puncturing pattern determining parameters 'a' and "b" can be selected as<br>
integers according to a desired puncturing pattern. These integers are determined<br>
according to the puncturing pattern only, and the parameters can be set to b= 1 and a=2.<br>
A detailed description of a method for determining the integers for the puncturing pattern<br>
determining parameters will be made with reference to the tables which are given below.<br>
For example, the third rate matching function 233 may output the symbols of<br>
'••■01x1 lxl lx--' (where x indicates a punctured symbol).<br>
In FIG. 5, the symbols encoded by the turbo encoder 220 are separated and then<br>
provided in equal numbers to the rate matching functions 231. 232 and 233. The<br>
first rate matching function 231 outputs the input symbols, as they are. The second<br>
and third rate matching functions 232 and 233 puncture the same number of input<br>
symbols. At this point, the puncturing patterns may be determined either equally or<br>
differently. That is. the puncturing patterns may be determined either equally or<br>
differently for the rate matching functions 232 and 233.<br>
3. Determination of Parameters for Puncturing<br>
In the embodiments of the present invention discussed here, the rate matching<br>
functions puncture the same number of symbols (excepting the rate matching<br>
function 231 of FIG. 5). However, the rate matching functions may puncture<br>
different numbers of symbols. If the number Ni of the symbols output from the<br>
respective rate matching functions is set differently, the number of symbols<br>
punctured by the respective rate matching functions will be determined differently.<br>
Further, the pattern of the symbols punctured by the respective rate matching<br>
functions can be determined either equally or differently, by changing the<br>
puncturing pattern determining parameters 'a' and 'b'. That is, even though it has a<br>
single structure, a rate matching device according to the present invention can determine<br>
parameters such as the input symbol number, the output symbol number, the number of<br>
symbols to be punctured and the puncturing pattern determining parameters differently.<br><br>
Table 1 below shows various cases of the parameters, by way of example. Herein, the<br>
coding rate is assumed to be R=l/3. Therefore, three rate matching functions are<br>
provided, and the respective rate matching functions separately receive the same<br>
number of symbols, i.e., Nc=Ncs/3 symbols. Herein, the rate matching ftinctions<br>
separately receive the same number of the symbols, determined by multiplying the<br>
number of the encoded symbols by the coding rate. However, it should be noted that the<br>
present invention can also be applied to a case where the rate matching functions<br>
separately receive a different number of symbols, i.e., a number of symbols which is<br>
smaller than the number determined by multiplying the number of the encoded symbols<br>
in a frame by the coding rate, or a number of symbols which is larger than the number<br>
determined by multiplying the number of the encoded symbols in a frame by the coding<br>
rate. In the description below. RMB1, R.MB2 and RMB3 denote first to third rate<br>
matching functions, respectively.<br><br><br>
In Table 1, RMB1, RMB2 and RMB3 indicates rate matching functions. I<br>
and p, q, r, s, t, w. x, y and z are integers. In Case 9 and Case 10  1.0. This<br>
is because Nit  Nis. NA (Not Available) indicates that the input symbols<br>
are output as they are, without puncturing, for which the parameters "a' and "b" can be<br>
set to any value. Here, the parameters 'a' and 'b' are positive numbers. Further, the case<br>
where the input symbols are punctured to perform rate matching so that the number of<br>
the input symbols is larger than the number of the output symbols (i.e., Ncs &gt; Nis) is<br>
shown. Reference will be made to each Case.<br>
Case 1. Case 2: In Case 1 and Case 2, the symbols in one frame are punctured in<br>
a uniform pattern. Specifically, in Case 1. the rate matching b+eekfunctions have the<br>
same puncturing pattern because the "a" and "b" parameters are the same, and in Case 2,<br>
the rate matching functions have different puncturing patterns because the "a" and<br>
"b" parameters are different.<br>
Case 3: In systematic puncturing, information symbols are not punctured, but<br>
the parity symbols are punctured. Here, since the puncturing pattern determining<br>
parameter values La' and 'b' are equal to each other, RMB2 and RMB3 perform uniform<br>
puncturing half-and-half using the same puncturing pattern.<br>
Case 4: In systematic puncturing, information symbols are not punctured, and<br>
the parity symbols are punctured. Here, since the puncturing pattern determining<br>
parameters "a" and "b" are different from each other, RMB2 and RMB3 perform uniform<br>
puncturing half-and-half using different puncturing patterns.<br>
Case 5: This is a general case for Case 3. In this case, the puncturing pattern<br>
determining parameter 'a' is set to an integer 'p* so that it may be possible to set the<br>
various puncturing patterns. The parameter 'a' is set to the same value for both RMB2<br>
and RMB3.<br>
Case 6: This is a general case for Case 4. In this case, the puncturing pattern<br>
determining parameter 'a' is set to integers "p* and 'q" so that it may be possible to set<br>
the various puncturing patterns. The parameter "a" is set to 'p' for RMB2 and 'q" for<br>
RMB3.<br><br>
Case 7: This is a further general case for Case 5. In this case, the puncturing<br>
pattern determining parameter "a' is set to an integer -p' and the puncturing pattern<br>
determining parameter 'b* is set to an integer -q" so that it may be possible to set the<br>
various puncturing patterns. The parameters 'a' and "b* are set to the same value for both<br>
RMB2andRMB3.<br>
Case 8: This is a further general case for Case 6. In this case, the puncturing<br>
pattern determining parameter 'a* is set to integers 'p1 and "r for RMB2 and RMB3,<br>
respectively, and the puncturing pattern determining parameter 'b' is set to integers q'<br>
and 's' for RMB2 and RMB3, respectively, so that it may be possible to set various<br>
puncturing patterns. The parameters 'a* and 'b' are set to 'p1 and 'q' for RMB2 and to T'<br>
and -s' for RMB3.<br>
Case 9, Case 10: In these cases, all the possible parameters are changed. That is.<br>
the output symbol number can be set to any integer and the puncturing pattern<br>
determining parameters "a* and 'b" can also be set to any given integers.<br>
In Table 1. Case 1 and Case 2 can be applied when rate matching is performed<br>
on the convolutionally-encoded symbols, and Case 3 to Case 8 can be applied when rate<br>
matching is performed on the turbo-encoded symbols.<br>
The puncturing pattern may be varied according to a change in the puncturing<br>
pattern determining parameter 'a'. Table 2 below shows a variation of the puncturing<br>
patterns according to a change in the parameter "a*. It is assumed in Table 2 that Nc=10,<br>
Ni=8. y=Nc-Ni= 10-8=2, and b=l. The symbols punctured according to the puncturing<br>
pattern are represented by 'x.<br><br><br>
It is noted from Table 2 that it is possible to obtain the different puncturing<br>
patterns by fixing 'b* to T and setting 'a' to different values. It can be understood that<br>
the first symbol of the puncturing pattern is located in front, as the 'a' value is increased.<br>
Of course, it is possible to obtain more various puncturing patterns by changing the<br>
parameter *b" as well. In addition, it is possible to prevent the first symbol from being<br>
punctured by setting the parameter 'b' to 1 and using a value satisfying Equation 1 below<br>
for the parameter -a\ Therefore, to satisfy Condition 3B, the parameter 'a' should be set<br>
to a value within a range of Equation 1.<br>
I <a></a>
where |_Nc/yJ is the largest integer less than or equal to Nc/y.<br>
In Equation 1, for Nc=10 and y=2, Nc/y=l 0/2=5. Therefore, if'a* has a value of<br>
1. 2, 3 and 4, the first symbols will not be punctured.<br>
In order to satisfy Condition 5B, the tail bits should not be punctured. To this<br>
end, Nc should be set to a value determined by subtracting the number of the tail bits<br>
therefrom. That is, if the input symbol number Nc is set to Nc-NT where NT denotes the<br>
number of tail bits, the tail bits will not be punctured, thus satisfying Condition 5B. In<br>
other words, the tail bits do not enter the rate matching function. Thus, the rate<br>
matching pattern only considers a frame size of Nc-NT. After puncturing or repeating by<br>
the rate matching function, the tail bits are concatenated sequentially to the output<br>
symbols of the rate matching function. The tail bits are not processed and are only<br>
attached at the end of the output symbols.<br>
4. Rate Matching Algorithm by Puncturing<br>
FIG. 7 shows a rate matching procedure by puncturing according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. This procedure is performed based on a rate<br>
matching algorithm shown in Table 3 below. In Table 3, "So={dl,d2,- •-.dNc}'" denotes<br>
the symbols input for one rate matching function. i.e., the symbols input in a frame<br>
unit for one rate matching function, and is comprised of Nc symbols in total. A<br>
shift parameter S(k) is an initial value used in the algorithm, and is constantly set to "0'<br>
when a rate matching device according to the present invention is used in a downlink of<br><br>
a digital communication system (i.e., when rate matching is performed on the encoded<br>
symbols to be transmitted from the base station to the mobile station), "m' indicates the<br>
order of the symbols input for rate matching, and has the order of 1. 2, 3. ••■, Nc. It is<br>
noted from Table 3 that the parameters including the input symbol number Nc. the<br>
output symbol number Ni and the puncturing pattern determining parameters 'a' and 'b"<br>
can be changed. For example, the parameters can be changed as shown in Table 1. The<br>
input symbol number Nc can be determined as a value other than Ncs/3, according to the<br>
coding rate R. FIG. 7 corresponds to the case where the algorithm of Table 3 is applied<br>
to a downlink of the digital communication system, i.e., S(k)=0.<br><br>
When the algorithm of Table 3 is used, the following advantages are provided.<br>
First, it is possible to variably puncture the encoded symbols of frame unit.<br>
Second, it is possible to generate various puncturing patterns by adjusting the<br><br>
parameters Nc. Ni. a and b.<br>
Third, it is possible to reduce the complexity and calculating time of each rate<br>
matching funetion by 1/R. This is because if a plurality of rate matching<br>
functions are used, the number of the symbols to be punctured by each rate<br>
matching function will be reduced, as compared with the case where one rate<br>
matching function is used.<br>
Referring to FIG. 7, in step 701, all sorts of parameters including the input<br>
symbol number Nc, the output symbol number Ni and the puncturing pattern<br>
determining parameters 'a' and 'b' are initialized for the rate matching process. When<br>
Nc and Ni are determined by parameter initialization, the number of symbols to be<br>
punctured is determined by y=Nc-Ni, in step 702. In step 703, an initial error value "e"<br>
between current and desired puncturing ratios is calculated. The initial error value is<br>
determined by e = b*Nc mod a*Nc.<br>
Next, in step 704, vnr indicating the order of the input symbols is set to ' I "<br>
(m=l). Thereafter, in steps 705 to 709, the symbols are examined from the initial symbol<br>
as to whether they should be punctured or not. If it is determined in step 707 that the<br>
calculated error value 'e* is smaller than or equal to "0". the corresponding symbol is<br>
punctured and then the error value is updated by e=e+a*Nc, in step 708. Otherwise, if it<br>
is determined in step 707 that the calculated error value 'e' is larger than c0\ puncturing<br>
is not performed. The operation of receiving the encoded symbols in order, determining<br>
whether to perform puncturing on the received symbols, and performing puncturing<br>
accordingly, is repeatedly performed until it is determined in step 705 that all the<br>
symbols in one frame are completely received.<br>
As shown by the algorithm above, the position of the first symbol to be<br>
punctured or repeated is controlled by the (a,b) parameters (let InitialOffsetm ■= the<br>
position of the first symbol to be punctured). In the above algorithm, InitialOffsetm =<br>
"m" when "e' 
InitialOffsetm. In the example below, bNc is assumed to be smaller than aNc.<br><br><br><br>
As shown by the above equations, by controlling the (a,b) parameters, the<br>
position of the first symbol to be punctured or repeated can be controlled.<br>
For example, the value of Initial Offset m decreases as 'a' increases if 'b'<br>
stays constant. Thus, by increasing 'a', the position of the first symbol to be<br>
punctured/repeated will be pushed closer to the first position. If "a" is chosen to be<br>
bigger than by/Nc, then Initial_Offset_m = 1, which means that the first symbol will be<br>
punctured or repeated. As a result, the position of the first symbol to be<br>
punctured/repeated can be manipulated by choosing a value for -a" between 1 and Ppnc.<br>
For example, if "b" = 1 and "a' = 2, the position of the first symbol to be<br>
punctured/repeated will be always equal to Ppnc/2.<br>
As for the "b" parameter, it controls the InitialOffsetm along with "a", and. as<br>
shown below, once the value of 'a' has been decided, the value of "b' can be expressed<br>
as l
decrease if b' decreases. Thus, the puncturing/repeating positions can be controlled by<br>
manipulating the values of (a,b) parameters. Although the value of "b' can be anything,<br>
it is not meaningful to choose a value of b' greater than 'a', as shown below, because<br>
the initial value of 'e" becomes cyclical once the value of'b' becomes larger than 'a' (i.e.,<br>
the value of e' repeats itself)<br><br><br><br>
As shown by the above example, the initial value of 'e' changes as the value of<br>
'b' changes. However, once the value of'b' becomes larger than 'a\ the initial value of<br>
"e" repeats itself cyclically. Thus, it is not meaningful to assign a value bigger than 'a' to<br>
'b\ In conclusion, the puncturing or repetition pattern can be controlled by manipulating<br>
the (a,b) parameters.<br>
B. Embodiments of the Rate Matching Device by Repeating<br>
1. Embodiment of the Rate Matching Device by Repeating (for a<br>
Convolutional Code)<br>
FIG. 9 shows a structure of a rate matching device by repeating according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. This structure is used when the rate matching<br>
devices of FIG. 2 and 3 rate match convolutionally-encoded symbols by repeating.<br>
Referring to FIG. 9, a convolutional encoder 210 encodes input information bits<br>
Ik at a coding rate R=l/3, and outputs encoded symbols Clk, C2k and C3k. The encoded<br>
symbols Clk, C2k, and C3k are separately provided to rate matching functions 231.<br>
232 and 233. respectively. The first rate matching function 231 selectively repeats<br>
the encoded symbol Clk. At this point, the repeating process is performed based on the<br>
repetition symbol number y=Ni-Nc determined by the input symbol number Nc and the<br>
output symbol number Ni, and the repetition pattern determining parameters 'a' and 'b".<br>
For example, the first rate matching function 231 can output the symbols of<br>
*-- 11(11)101(00)010-- (where (11) and (00) indicate repeated symbols).<br>
The second rate matching function 232 selectively repeats the encoded<br>
symbol C2k. At this point, the repeating process is performed based on the repetition<br>
symbol number y=Ni-Nc determined by the input symbol number Nc and the output<br>
symbol number Ni, and the repetition pattern determining parameters 'a' and 'b\ For<br>
example, the second rate matching function 232 can output the symbols of<br>
'-(11)01(00)1100-* (where (11) and (00) indicate repeated symbols).<br><br>
The third rate matching function 233 repeats the encoded symbol C3k. At<br>
this point, the repeating process is performed based on the repetition symbol number<br>
y=Ni-Nc determined by the input symbol number Nc and the output symbol number Mi.<br>
and the repetition pattern determining parameters "a" and "b\ For example, the third rate<br>
matching function 233 can output the symbols of •■•■0(11)1101(11)-' (where (11)<br>
indicates repeated symbols). The encoded symbols rate-matched by the rate matching<br>
functions 231, 232 and 233 are multiplexed by a multiplexer 240 and provided to a<br>
channel transmitter.<br>
In FIG. 9, the input symbol number Mc and the output symbol number Ni are<br>
equally determined as Mc=RxNcs and Ni=RxNis, respectively, for every rate matching<br>
function. It is determined that each rate matching function separately repeats<br>
the same number of the channel-encoded symbols, on the assumption that the error<br>
sensitivity of encoded symbols is almost the same for every symbol in one frame. That is,<br>
an almost uniform repetition pattern is provided within one frame regardless of the<br>
various repetition bit numbers (y=Ni-Mc) determined according to the service type. This<br>
is because it is possible that the whole symbols in one frame can be uniformly repeated<br>
for the convolutional code.<br>
Therefore, in accordance with the embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
symbols encoded by the convolutional encoder 210 are separated by the same number<br>
and provided to the rate matching functions 231, 232 and 233. The rate matching<br>
functions 321, 232 and 233 each repeat the same number of input symbols. At this<br>
point, the repetition pattern parameters can be determined either equally or differently.<br>
That is, the repetition patterns can be determined either equally or differently for the rate<br>
matching functions 231, 232 and 233.<br>
2. Another Embodiment of a Rate Matching Device fry Repeating (for a<br>
Turbo Code)<br>
FIG. 10 shows the structure of a rate matching device by repeating according to<br>
another embodiment of the present invention. This structure is used when the rate<br>
matching devices of FIG. 2 and 3 rate match turbo-encoded symbols by repeating.<br>
Referring to FIG. 10, a turbo encoder 220 encodes input information bits Ik at a<br>
coding rate R=l/3, and outputs encoded symbols Clk, C2k and C3k. Among the<br><br>
encoded symbols, the information symbol Clk is separately provided to a first rate<br>
matching function 231, and the parity symbols (or redundancy symbols) C2k and<br>
C3k are separately provided to second and third rate matching functions 232 and<br>
233, respectively. The turbo encoder 220 is comprised of a first component encoder 222,<br>
a second component encoder 224 and an interleaver 226. as shown in FIG. 6. The<br>
component encoders 222 and 223 may use recursive systematic codes (RSC). The<br>
structure of the turbo encoder 220 is well known by those skilled in the art. Thus, a<br>
detailed description will be avoided. The input X(t) to the turbo encoder 220 corresponds<br>
to the input information bits Ik shown in FIG. 10. Outputs X(t), Y(t) and Y'(t) of the<br>
turbo encoder 220 correspond to the encoded symbols Clk, C2k and C3k shown in FIG.<br>
10, respectively. For the first output of the turbo encoder 220, the input information bits<br>
Ik are output at as they are, so that the input information bits Ik are output as Clk in FIG.<br>
10.<br>
The first rate matching function 231 repeats the encoded symbols Clk<br>
based on the following criteria. Since the coding rate is R=l/3, the input symbol number<br>
Nc is determined as Nc=RxNcs=Ncs/3, which is 1/3 the total number of input<br>
symbols(encoded symbol). The output symbol number Ni is determined as Ni=Nis-<br>
(2RxNcs), since repeating should be performed according to Condition ID. The<br>
repetition pattern determining parameters 'a' and 'b' can be set to given integers<br>
according to a desired repetition pattern. The integers are determined depending on the<br>
repetition pattern only, and the parameters can be typically set to b=l and a=2. A detailed<br>
description of a method for determining the integers for the repetition pattern<br>
determining parameters will be made with reference to the tables below. For example,<br>
the first rate matching Weektunction 231 may output the symbols of<br>
'■■■1(11)101(00)11-•■' (where (11) and (00) indicate repeated symbols).<br>
The second rate matching function 232 outputs the encoded symbols C2k<br>
without repetition.However, the second rate matching function 232 may repeat the<br>
encoded symbols C2k in certain conditions such as severe repetition . Since the coding<br>
rate is R=l/3, the input symbol number Nc is determined as Nc=RxNcs=Ncs/3, which is<br>
1/3 the total number of input symbols. The output symbol number Ni is determined as<br>
Ni=RxNcs which is equal to the input symbol number, since the two kinds of parity<br>
symbols should not be repeated according to Condition 2D and Condition 4D. For<br>
example, the second rate matching function 232 may output the symbols of<br>
"•■•I 10111101---" where there is no repetition.<br><br>
The third rate matching function 233 outputs the encoded symbols C3k<br>
without repetition.However, the third rate matching function 233 may also repeat<br>
the encoded symbols C3k under severe repetition. Since the coding rate is R^-l/3. the<br>
input symbol number Nc is determined as Nc=RxNcs=Ncs/3, which is 1/3 the total<br>
number of input symbols. The output symbol number Ni is determined as Ni=RxNcs<br>
which is equal to the input symbol number, since the two kinds of parity symbols should<br>
not be repeated according to Condition 2D and Condition 4D. The repetition pattern<br>
determining parameters -aN and "b can be set to given integers according to a desired<br>
repetition pattern. 1 lowever, functions 232 or 233 do not use repetition, then (a,b)<br>
parameters are meaningless for the rate matching kteek-functions 232 or 233.. The<br>
integers are determined depending on the repetition pattern only, and the parameters can<br>
be typically set to b=T and a=2. A detailed description of a method for determining the<br>
integers for the repetition pattern determining parameters will be made with reference to<br>
the tables below. For example, the third rate matching function 233 may output the<br>
symbols of'-01011010--' which have not experienced repetition.<br>
In FIG. 10, the symbols encoded by the turbo encoder 220 are separated in the<br>
same number and then provided to the rate matching functions 231, 232 and 233.<br>
The first rate matching function 231 receives the information symbols out of the<br>
encoded symbols and repeats the received symbols according to a predetermined<br>
repetition pattern. The second and third rate matching functions 232 and 233<br>
receive the parity symbols out of the encoded symbols, and output the received symbols<br>
as they arc, without repetition.<br>
3. Determination of Parameters for Repeating<br>
As described above, the repetition patterns used for the respective rate matching<br>
functions may be either identical or different. That is, the symbol repetition pattern<br>
used in the respective rate matching functions and the number of repeated symbols<br>
can be variably determined. If the number Ni of the symbols output from the respective<br>
rate matching functions is differently set, the number of symbols repeated by the<br>
respective rate matching functions will be determined differently. Further, the<br>
pattern of the symbols repeated by the respective rate matching functions can be<br>
determined either equally or differently, by changing the repetition pattern determining<br>
parameters 'a* and "b\ That is, even though having a single structure, a rate matching<br><br>
device according to the present invention can differently determine parameters such as<br>
the input symbol number, the output symbol number, the number of symbols to be<br>
repeated and the repetition pattern determining parameters.<br>
Table 4 below shows various cases of parameters, by way of example. Herein,<br>
the coding rate is assumed to be R=l/3. Therefore, there are provided three rate matching<br>
functions. and the respective rate matching functions separately receive the<br>
same number of symbols, i.e., Nc=Ncs/3 symbols. Herein, the rate matching<br>
functions separately receive the same number of the symbols, determined by<br>
multiplying the number of the encoded symbols by the coding rate. However, it should<br>
be noted that the present invention can also be applied to a case where the rate matching<br>
functions separately receive a different number of symbols, i.e., a number of<br>
symbols smaller than the number determined by multiplying the number of the encoded<br>
symbols in a frame by the coding rate, or a number of symbols which is larger than the<br>
number determined by multiplying the number of the encoded symbols in a frame by the<br>
coding rate. In the description below, RMB1, RMB2 and RMB3 denote first to third rate<br>
matching functions. respectively.<br><br>
In Table 4, RMB1, RMB2 and RMB3 indicates rate matching functions.<br>
and p, q, r, s. I. w and x are given integers. NA (Mot Available) indicates that the input<br>
symbols are output as they are, without repetition, for which the parameters "a* and 'b*<br>
can be set to any value. Here, the parameters "a' and 'b' are positive numbers, further,<br>
the case where the input symbols are repeated to perform rate matching so that the<br>
number of the input symbols is smaller than or equal to the number of the output<br>
symbols (i.e., Ncs 
 <br>
Case 1: In systematic repetition, information symbols are repeated, but the<br>
parity symbols are not repeated. The repetition pattern determining parameters are set to<br>
a=2 and b= 1.<br>
Case 2: In systematic repetition, information symbols are repeated, but the<br>
parity symbols are not repeated. The repetition pattern determining parameters are set to<br>
a=p and b=q.<br>
Case 1 and Case 2 can be applied when only the turbo-encoded information<br>
symbols are repeated as shown in FIG. 10.<br>
Case 3: Both the information symbols and the parity symbols are repeated, and<br>
the repetition patterns are equally determined for all of RMB1, RMB2 and RMB3. The<br>
number of repeated symbols is equal for RMB1, RMB2 and RMB3.<br>
Case 4: Both the information symbols and the parity symbols are repeated, and<br>
the repetition patterns are differently determined for all or some of RMB1, RMB2 and<br>
RMB3. The number of repeated symbols is equal for RMB2 and RMB3.<br>
Table 5 below shows the variation in repetition patterns according to a change<br>
in the parameter 'a'. It is assumed in Table 5 that Nc=8, Ni=10, y=Ni-Nc= 10-8=2, and<br>
b=l. The symbols repeated according to the repetition pattern are represented by '( )".<br><br>
It is noted from Table 5 that it is possible to obtain the various repetition<br>
patterns by fixing "b to T and setting 'a' to different values. Of course, it is possible to<br>
obtain more various repetition patterns by changing the parameter 'b' as well. In addition,<br>
it is possible to always repeat the first symbol by setting the parameter "b' to 1 and using<br><br>
a value satisfying Equation 2 below for the parameter 'a'. Therefore, to satisfy Condition<br>
3D. the parameter "a' should be set to a value within a range of Equation 2.<br>
a &gt; LNc/yJ .... (2)<br>
where [Nc/y] is the largest integer less than or equal to Nc/y.<br>
In Equation 2, for Nc=8 and y--2, Nc/y=8/2=4. Therefore, if "a" has a value<br>
larger than 4. the first symbols will be repeated.<br>
In order to satisfy Condition 5D, the tail bits should be repeated. To this end, Nc<br>
should be set to a value determined by adding the number of the tail bits thereto. That is.<br>
if the input symbol number Nc is set to Nc+NT where NT denotes the number of tail bits,<br>
the tail bits for the information symbols will always be repeated, thus satisfying<br>
Condition 5D. In other words, for repetition, even the tail bits are entered into the rate<br>
matching function and considered for repetition.<br>
4. Rate Matching Algorithm by Repeating<br>
FIG. 11 shows a rate matching procedure by repeating according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. This procedure is performed based on a rate<br>
matching algorithm shown in Table 6 below. In Table 6, "So={dl,d2,- -,dNc}" denotes<br>
the symbols input for rate matching, i.e., the symbols input in a frame unit for rate<br>
matching, and is comprised of Nc symbols in total. A shift parameter S(k) is an initial<br>
value used in the algorithm, and is constantly set to "0' when a rate matching device<br>
according to the present invention is used in a downlink of a digital communication<br>
system (i.e., when rate matching is performed on the encoded symbols to be transmitted<br>
from the base station to the mobile station), 'm' indicates the order of the symbols input<br>
for rate matching, and has the order of 1,2, 3, ■••, Nc. It is noted from Table 6 that the<br>
parameters including the input symbol number Nc, the output symbol number Ni and the<br>
repetition pattern determining parameters 'a' and 'b' can be changed. For example, the<br>
parameters can be changed as shown in Table 4. The input symbol number Nc can be<br>
determined as a value other than Ncs/3, according to the coding rate R. FIG. I I<br>
corresponds to the case where the algorithm of Table 6 is applied to a downlink of the<br>
digital communication system, i.e., S(k)=0.<br><br><br>
When the algorithm of Table 6 is used, the following advantages are provided.<br>
First, it is possible to variably repeat the encoded symbols (or codeword<br>
symbols) of frame unit.<br>
Second, it is possible to generate various repetition patterns by adjusting the<br>
parameters Nc, Ni. a and b.<br>
Third, il is possible to reduce the complexity and calculating time of each rate<br>
matching f'unction by l/R. This is because if a plurality of rate matching<br>
functions are used, the number of the symbols to be repeated by each rate matching<br>
function will be reduced, as compared with the case where one rate matching<br>
function is used. For example, the number of symbols which can be repeated by<br>
each rate matching function can be reduced by the coding rate R, as compared with<br><br>
the case where one rate matching function is used.<br>
Referring to FIG. 11, in step 1101, all sorts of parameters including the input<br>
symbol number Nc, the output symbol number Ni and the repetition pattern determining<br>
parameters 'a" and "b' are initialized for the rate matching process. When Nc and Ni are<br>
determined by parameter initialization, the number of symbols to be repeated is<br>
determined by y=Ni-Nc, in step 1102. In step 1103, an initial error value V between<br>
current and desired repetition ratios is calculated. The initial error value is determined by<br>
e = b*Nc mod a*Nc.<br>
Next, in step 1104. 'rrf indicating the order of the input symbols is set to "1"<br>
(m=l). Thereafter, in steps 1105 to 1109, the symbols are examined from the initial<br>
symbol as to whether they should be repeated or not. If it is determined in step 1107 that<br>
the calculated error value 'e' is smaller than or equal to '0', the corresponding symbol is<br>
repeated and then the error value is updated by e=e+a*Nc, in step 1108. Otherwise, if it<br>
is determined in step 1107 that the calculated error value 'e* is larger than ;0', repetition<br>
is not performed. The operation of receiving the encoded symbols in order, determining<br>
whether to perform repetition on the received symbols, and performing repetition<br>
accordingly, is repeatedly performed until it is determined in step 1105 that all the<br>
symbols in one frame are completely received. During the repetition process, the error<br>
value is updated by e=e-a*y in step 1106.<br>
As described above, the data communication system according to the present<br>
invention can perform rate matching on both symbols channel-encoded with a non-<br>
systematic code and symbols channel-encoded with a systematic code, using a single<br>
structure. Therefore, the data communication system supporting both non-systematic<br>
codes and systematic codes can selectively rate match symbols channel-encoded with a<br>
non-systematic code or symbols channel-encoded with a systematic code, thereby<br>
increasing efficiency of data transmission and improving system performance.<br>
The present invention has the following advantages.<br>
First, it is possible to freely set the puncturing/repetition patterns by adjusting<br>
the parameters of the rate matching functions. and all the conditions which should J<br>
be considered when rate matching the turbo-encoded symbols can be satisfied by simply<br>
adjusting the parameters.<br><br>
Second, it is possible to implement all of the rate matching functions<br>
according to the coding rate R by using the same algorithm, and the rate matching<br>
functions are simple in structure.<br>
Third, a system using both convolutional codes and turbo codes can support<br>
both convolutional codes and turbo codes, using a single rate matching device rather<br>
than using different rate matching devices, by simply setting different initial parameters.<br>
Fourth, it is not necessary to implement the rate matching kleekfunctions<br>
differently according to a convolutional code or a turbo code.<br>
Fifth, by setting the number of input symbols to a value determined by adding<br>
the number of the tail bits therefrom so that the tail bits are repeated, the novel rate<br>
matching device is useful when a SOVA decoder is used or when performance would be<br>
degraded due to the no repeating of the tail bits. By setting the number of input symbols<br>
to a value determined by adding the number of the tail bits to the number of non-tail bits<br>
so that the tail bits are repeated, the novel rate matching device is useful when a SOVA<br>
decoder is used or when performance would be degraded due to the no repeating of the<br>
tail bits.<br>
By setting the number of input symbols to a value determined by adding the number of<br>
the tail bits therefrom so that the tail bits are repeated, the novel rate matching device is<br>
useful when a SOVA decoder is used or when performance would be degraded due to<br>
the no repeating of the tail bits.<br>
Sixth, by setting the puncturing pattern determining parameter *b' to " 1* and<br>
setting the parameter 'a' to a value within a specific range, it is possible to prevent the<br>
first symbol in one frame from being punctured. Further, it is possible to repeat the first<br>
symbol in one frame by setting the repetition pattern determining parameter 'b' to • I"<br>
and setting the parameter 'a' to a value within a specific range.<br>

outputting from the rate matching function with given bits number of<br>
transmission channel; and<br>
a multiplexer for collecting the rate matched bit streams.<br>
27. A rate matching method for rate matching systematic code in a data<br>
communication system having a turbo encoder for encoding input<br>
information bits with predetermined coding rate and outputting a<br>
systematic bit stream, first parity bit streams and second parity bit stream<br>
for the input information bits to generate an encoded bits of the input<br>
information bits, and a rate matching function rate matching a number of<br>
bits from the encoded bits, the method comprising the steps of:<br>
separately receiving, in each of the rate matching functions, respective<br>
systematic bit stream or parity bit stream;<br>
determining a number of the encoded bits to be repeated comparing to<br>
the number of input bits and the number of output bits from each of the<br>
rate matching function; and<br>
repeating in at least one of the rate matching functions a determined<br>
number of the received systematic or parity bits in accordance with<br>
corresponding rate matching parameters which are determined by a<br>
number of bits outputting from the rate matching function with given bits<br>
number of transmission channel to rate match the received bits,<br>
multiplexing the rate matched systematic and parity bit streams.<br>
28.A method for determining bits to be repeated in claim 27, comprising the<br>
steps of:<br>
a.	determining a number Y of the bits to be repeated by receiving a<br>
number Nc of input bits and a number Ni of output bits;<br>
b.	calculating an initial error value V indicating a difference value<br>
between a current repetition ratio and a desired repetition ratio;<br><br>
c.	updating the error value for each of the input bits;<br>
d.	repeating the corresponding input symbol when the error value is<br>
less than or equal to *0'; and<br>
e.	repeatedly performing the steps © and (d) until the number of<br>
counted symbols W is larger than W,<br>
29.The method as claimed in claim 28, wherein the initial error value V<br>
indicating a difference value between a current repetition ratio and a<br>
desired repetition ratio is calculated by a formula [{(2 x S(k) x y)+(b x<br>
Nc)} mod {a x Nc}], each of the rate matching functions receiving a set of<br>
the encoded bits.<br>
30.The method as claimed in claim 29, wherein the S(k) denotes a shift<br>
parameter set to *0" in downlink, "a'denotes a parameter for determining<br>
a position of a bit to be first repeated in one frame, V denotes a<br>
parameter for determining a period of the bits to be repeated in one bit<br>
stream.<br><br>
A data communication system for late matching systematic code and a<br>
method for the same.<br>
A device and method for matching a rate of channel-encoded symbols in<br>
a data communication system. The rate matching device a method can be<br>
applied to a data communication system which uses one or both of a non-<br>
systematic code (such as a convolution code or a linear block code) and a<br>
systematic code (such as a turbo code). The rate matching device<br>
includes a plurality of rate matching functions, the number of the rate<br>
matching functions being equal to a reciprocal of a coding rate of a<br>
channel encoder. The rate matching device can rate match the symbols<br>
encoded with a non-systematic code or the symbols encoded with a<br>
systematic code, by changing initial parameters including the number of<br>
input symbols, the number of output symbols, and the<br>
puncturing/repetition parameters determining parameter.<br><br></td>
