A catalyat comprising at least one nickel{0) complex based on a phosphonite ligand, and the preparation of nitriles<br>
Description<br>
The present invention relates to a catalyst which comprises a nickel(O) complex which comprises at least one mono-, bi- or multidentate phosphonite ligand in which the phosphorus and one of the oxygen atoms of the phosphonite group are part of a 5- to 8-membered heterocycle, and to a process for preparing mixtures of monoolefinic Cs-mononitriles by catalytic hydrocyanation in the presence of a catalyst of this type.<br>
There is a great demand around the world for a^co-alkylenediamines which serve as an important starting material for the industrial preparation of polyamides. a,(o-Alkylenediamines such as hexamethylenediamine are obtained almost exclusively by hydrogenation of the corresponding dinitriles. Almost all industrial routes for preparing hexamethylenediamine are therefore essentially variants of the preparation of adiponitrile, of which about 1,0 million tonnes are produced each year around the world.<br>
K. Weissermel, H.-J. Arpe, Industrielle Organische Chemie, 4th edition, VCH Weinheim, pages 266 et seq. describe four routes, which differ in principle, for preparing adiponitrile:<br>
1.	reductive amination of adipic acid with ammonia in the liquid or gas phase, with intermediate formation of the diamide;<br>
2.	indirect hydrocyanation of 1,3-butadiene via the intermediate 1,4-dichlorobutenes;<br>
3.	hydrodimerization of acrylonitrile in an electrochemical process; and<br>
4.	direct hydrocyanation of 1,3-butadiene with hydrogen cyanide.<br>
In the last-mentioned process, monoaddition in a first stage results in a mixture of isomeric pentenonitriles which is, in a second stage, isomerized mainly to 3- and 4-pentenonitriles. Subsequently, in a third stage, adiponitrile is formed by anti-Markownikoff addition of hydrogen cyanide onto 4-pentenonitrile. This reaction takes place in the liquid phase<br><br>
in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, at a temperature in the range 30 - ISO'^C under atmospheric pressure. The catalysts used for this *are nickel complexes with phosphine or phosphite ligands and metal salt promoters. The abovementioned review does not describe phosphonite ligands integrated into a heterocycle for stabilizing the nickel.<br>
"Applied Homogeneous Catalysis with Organometallic Compounds", Volume 1, VCH Weinheim, pages 465 et seq. gives a general description of the addition, with heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis, of hydrogen cyanide onto olefins. The catalysts used in these cases are in particular based on phosphine, phosphite and phosphinite complexes of nickel and palladium. Adiponitrile is prepared by hydrocyanation of butadiene mainly with the use of nickel(O) phosphite catalysts, in the presence or absence of a Lewis acid as promoter. The reaction can generally be divided into three steps: 1. Synthesis of mononitriles by hydrocyanation of 1,3-butadiene; 2. Isomerization; 3. Synthesis of dinitriles. In the formation of the monoadduct, a mixture of isomers is obtained and comprises, inter alia, 3-pentenonitrile and 2-methyl-3-butenonitrile.<br>
Customary catalysts for the hydrocyanation of 1,3-butadiene are, in particular, the nickel(0)-phosphite catalysts already mentioned.<br>
C. A. Tolman et al. describe in Organometallics 3 (1984) 33 et seq. the catalytic hydrocyanation of olefins in the presence of nickel(O) phosphite complexes paying particular attention to the effects of Lewis acids on the addition of hydrogen cyanide.<br>
Advances in Catalysis, Volume 33, 1985, Academic Press Inc., page 1 et seq. gives a review-type description of the hydrocyanation of olefins with homogeneous nickel catalysis. The catalysts employed are nickel(O) complexes with phosphine and phosphite ligands.<br>
&gt;<br>
J. Chem. Soc, Chem. Commun. (1991) 1292 describes chiral aryl diphosphites as ligands for hydrocyanation catalysts. The phosphite group in these ligands is linked by two oxygen atoms to the 3- and 3'-positions of a 2,2'-binaphthyl unit with which they thus form a 7-membered heterocycle. It is also possible in addition for two of these heterocycles to be linked by a 2,2'-binaphthyl unit to give a bidentate chelating ligand.<br><br>
J- Chem. Soc, Chem. Commun. (1991) 803 et seq. describes chelating diphosphite complexes of nickel(O) and platinum (0) which are analogous thereto but employ a biphenyl unit in place of a 2,2'-binaphthyl unit.<br>
WO 95/28228 describes a process for the hydrocyanation of aliphatic monoolefins which may additionally have a nonconjugated nitrile group or a nonconjugated or conjugated ester group. The nickel(O) catalysts employed in this case likewise comprise bidentate phosphite ligands in which the phosphite groups are parts of aryl-fused heterocycles.<br>
WO 95/29153 describes a process for the hydrocyanation of monoolefins employing catalysts based on zero-valent nickel and monodentate phosphite ligands. The phosphite group in these ligands is in turn, together with two of its oxygen atoms, part of an aryl-fused 7-membered heterocycle. The third oxygen atom of the phosphite group carries a t-butyl-substituted phenyl radical which may also have further substituents.<br>
WO 96/11182 describes a process for the hydrocyanation of aliphatic, monoethylenically unsaturated compounds in which the ethylenic double bond is not conjugated with another unsaturated group or in which the ethylenic double bond is conjugated with an ester group. In this case, a nickel{0) catalyst based on a multidentate phosphite ligand is employed in the presence of a Lewis acid as promoter. The phosphite groups in these multidentate ligands are in turn constituents of aryl-fused heterocycles and may be bridged by aryl-fused groups.<br>
WO 96/22968 describes a process for the hydrocyanation of diolefinic compounds and for the isomerization of the resulting nonconjugated 2-alkyl-3-monoalkenonitriles by reacting an acyclic, aliphatic diolefin with a source of hydrogen cyanide. This reaction takes place in the liquid phase. The hydrocyanation catalysts employed are similar to those described in WO 96/11182.<br>
US-A 5,512,695 has a disclosure content corresponding to that of WO 95/28228.<br>
Besides the hydrocyanation catalysts described previously and based on mono-, bi- and multidentate phosphite ligands, catalysts based on phosphinite ligands are also known. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 116 (1994) 9869 et seq- and US-A-5,484,902 describe catalysts for the enantioselective hydrocyanation of aromatic vinyl compounds based on a chiral, nonracemic, bidentate chelating phosphinite<br><br>
ligands. The ligand preferably employed in this case is a phenyl 2,3-bis-Q-(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)phosphino-4,6-0-benzylidene-P-D-glucopyranoside.<br>
US-A 5,523,453 describes a process for the hydrocyanation of monoolefins which may additionally have a cyano group in the presence of a Lewis acid as promoter and a nickel{0) catalyst. These catalysts have ligands based on chelating phosphinites in which two aryl-substituted phosphinite groups are linked together via their oxygen atom and an aryl-fused alkylene bridge.<br>
None of the abovementioned references describes hydrocyanation catalysts based on phosphonite ligands where the phosphonite group is part of a 5- to 8-membered heterocycle.<br>
US-A 3,766,23 7 describes a process for the hydrocyanation of ethylenically unsaturated compounds which may have other functional groups, such as nitriles, in the presence of a nickel catalyst. These nickel catalysts have four ligands of the formula M(X,Y,Z) where X, Y and Z are, independently of one another, a radical R or OR, and R is selected from alkyl and aryl groups having up to 18 carbon atoms. However, only phosphines and phosphites are explicitly mentioned therein and employed in the examples of the hydrocyanation. On the other hand, there is no disclosure of the possibility of employing phosphonites in which the phosphonite group is part of a heterocycle as ligands for nickel(O) hydrocyanation catalysts.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide novel catalysts based on zero-valent nickel which show good selectivity and good catalytic activity in the hydrocyanation of 1,3-butadiene-containing hydrocarbon mixtures and in the first and second additions of hydrogen cyanide to prepare adiponitrile.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved by catalysts based on nickel(O) complexes which comprise at least one mono-, bi- or multidentate phosphonite ligand where the phosphonite group is part of a 5- to 8-membered heterocycle.<br>

Bidentate chelating ligands can be prepared by employing a compound of the formula HOR^ where the radical R^ has another hydroxyl group. Examples thereof are biphenyl-2,2'-diol and binaphthyl-2,2'-diol. Further suitable diols are mentioned in US-A-5,312,996, column 19, which is incorporated herein by reference. If at least 2 mole equivalents of compound VI are<br><br>
employed for the reaction, a pure bidentate phosphonite ligand of the formula I is obtained. However, bidentate ligands of the formula L which have a phosphonite group and a phosphite group can also be prepared by reacting a compound of the formula VI with a compound of the formula HOR^ which has two hydroxyl groups to give a monocondensate, and then reacting the latter with a compound of the formula VII<br>
Cl	P       D        VII<br>
J<br>
where D may have the meanings mentioned above for A, to give a mixed ligand of the formula I.<br>
The compounds of the formula VI can be isolated if required and subjected to purification, for example by distillation. Reaction of the compound of the formula V to give a compound of the formula VI generally takes place at an elevated temperature in a range from about 40 to about 200*^C, it also being possible to carry out the reaction while increasing the temperature gradually. In addition, a Lewis acid such as zinc chloride or aluminum chloride can be added as catalyst at the start of the reaction or after a certain reaction time. Further reaction of the compounds of the formula VI to give the phosphonite ligands of the formula I employed according to the invention generally takes place in the presence of a base, eg. an aliphatic aonine such as diethylamine, dipropylamine, dibutylamine, trimethylamine, tripropylamine and, preferably, triethylamine or pyridine.<br>
The phosphonite ligands of the formula I employed according to the invention are advantageously prepared without using organomagnesium or -lithium compounds. The simple reaction sequence means that it is possible to vary the ligands widely. The preparation thus takes place efficiently and economically from easily obtainable precursors.<br>
The novel catalysts can be prepared by reacting at least one phosphonite ligand of the formula I with nickel or a nickel compound in the presence of a reducing agent or with a nickel complex in an inert solvent. Suitable nickel compounds in this context are, for example, compounds in which the transition metal assumes an oxidation state above 0 and which are reduced in situ on reaction with the phosphonite ligands of the formula I, where<br><br>
appropriate in the presence of a suitable reducing agent. These include, for example, the halides, preferably the chlorides, and the acetates of the abovementioned transition metals. NiCla is preferably employed. Examples of suitable reducing agents are metals, preferably alkali metals such as Na and K, aluminum, zinc and trialkylaluminum compounds.<br>
If the phosphonite-nickel(O) complexes are prepared using complex compounds of the transition metal, the transition metal is preferably present in the latter in the zero valent state. The complexes preferably employed for the preparation are those with ligands corresponding to the abovementioned additional ligands in the novel complexes. In this case, the preparation takes place by partial or complete ligand exchange with the phosphonite ligands of the formula I described previously.<br>
In a suitable embodiment of the novel process, the nickel complex is bis(1,5-cyclooctadiene)nickel(0).<br>
Suitable inert solvents for preparing the nickel(O) complexes are, for example, aromatic compounds such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, chlorobenzene, ethers, preferably diethyl ether and tetrahydrofuran, or haloalkanes, for example dichloromethane, chloroform, dichloroethane and trichloroethane. The temperature is in the range from -70oc to ISOOQ, preferably from 0^0 to lOQoc, particularly preferably at about room temperature.<br>
If elemental nickel is employed for preparing the phosphonite-nickel(O) complexes, it is preferably in the form of a powder. The nickel and the phosphonite ligand are preferably reacted in a product of the hydrocyanation reaction as solvent, eg. in a mixture of monoolefinic Cs-mononitriles or, preferably in 3-pentenonitrile. It is also possible, where appropriate, for the ligand to be employed as solvent. The temperature is in the range from about 0 to 150oc, preferably 60 to lOOQC.<br>
The invention further relates to a process for preparing mixtures of monoolefinic Cs-mononitriles with nonconjugated C=C and C=N bonds by catalytic hydrocyanation of a 1,3-butadiene-containing hydrocarbon mixture, which comprises carrying out the hydrocyanation in the presence of at least one of the novel catalysts described previously.<br><br>
It is preferable to employ in the novel process for preparing monoolefinic Cs-mononitriles a hydrocarbon mixture which has a 1,3-butadiene content of at least 10% by volume, preferably at least 25% by volume, in particular at least 40% by volume.<br>
It is possible to employ pure butadiene or 1,3-butadiene-containing hydrocarbon mixtures for preparing mixtures of monoolefinic Cs-mononitriles which comprise, for example, 3-pentenonitrile and 2-methyl-3-butenonitrile and which are suitable as intermediates for further processing to adiponitrile.<br>
1,3-Butadiene-containing hydrocarboin mixtures are obtainable on the industrial scale. Thus, for example, petroleum processing by naphtha steam cracking results in a hydrocarbon mixture which is referred to as the C4 cut and has a high total olefin content, about 40% being 1,3-butadiene and the remainder being monoolefins and polyunsaturated hydrocarbons plus alkanes. These streams always also contain small amounts, in general up to 5%, of alkynes, 1,2-dienes and vinylacetylene.<br>
Pure 1,3-butadiene can be isolated, for example, by extractive distillation from industrially obtainable hydrocarbon mixtures.<br>
C4 Cuts are essentially freed where appropriate of alkynes such as propyne or butyne, of 1,2-dienes such as propadiene, and of alkenynes such as vinylacetylene. Otheanvise, the resulting products in some circumstances have.a C=C double bond conjugated with the C^N bond. It is disclosed in Applied Homogeneous Catalysis with Organometallic Compounds, Vol. 1, VCH Weinheim, page 479, that the conjugated 2-pentenonitrile produced in the isomerization of 2-methyl-3-butenonitrile and 3-pentenonitrile acts as inhibitor of the second addition of hydrogen cyanide to give adiponitrile. It has been found that the abovementioned conjugated nitriles obtained in the hydrocyanation of a non-pretreated C4 cut also act as catalyst poisons for the first step in the preparation of adipic acid, the monoaddition of hydrogen cyanide.<br>
Those components which afford catalyst poisons in the catalytic hydrocyanation, especially alkynes, 1,2-dienes and mixtures thereof, are therefore partly or completely removed, where appropriate, from the hydrocarbon mixture. To remove these components, the C4 cut is subjected to a partial catalytic hydrogenation before the addition of hydrogen cyanide. This partial hydrogenation takes place in the presence of a<br><br>
hydrogenation catalyst which is able to hydrogenate alkynes and 1,2-dienes selectively in the presence of other dienes and<br>
monoolefins.<br>
Suitable heterogeneous catalyst systems generally comprise a transition metal compound on an inert carrier. Suitable inert carriers are the oxides customary for this purpose, especially silicon and aluminum oxides, aluminosilicates, zeolites, carbides, nitrides etc. and mixtures thereof. The carriers preferably used are AI2O3, Si02 and mixtures thereof. The heterogeneous catalysts used are, in particular, those described in US-A-4,587,369, US-A-4,704,492 and US-A-4,493,906, which are incorporated herein by reference. Further suitable Cu-based catalyst systems are marketed by Dow Chemical as KLP catalyst.<br>
The addition of hydrogen cyanide onto 1,3-butadiene or a 1,3-butadiene-containing hydrocarbon mixture, eg. a pretreated, partially hydrogenated C4 cut, can take place continuously, semicontinuously or batchwise.<br>
In a suitable variant of the novel process, the addition of hydrogen cyanide takes place continuously. Suitable reactors for the continuous reaction are known to the skilled worker and are described, for example, in Ullmanns Enzyklopadie der technischen Chemie, Vol. 1, 3rd edition, 1951, pages 743 et seq. A cascade of stirred vessels or a tubular reactor is preferably used for the continuous variant of the novel process.<br>
In a preferred variant of the novel process, the addition of hydrogen cyanide onto 1,3-butadiene or a 1,3-butadiene-containing hydrocarbon mixture takes place semicontinuously.<br>
The semicontinuous process comprises:<br>
a)	charging a reactor with the hydrocarbon mixture, where appropriate part of the hydrogen cyanide and a novel hydrocyanation catalyst, which may have been generated in situ, and, where appropriate, a solvent,<br>
b)	reacting the mixture at elevated temperature under elevated pressure, with, in the semicontinuous procedure, hydrogen cyanide being fed in as it is consumed.<br><br>
c)  completing the conversion by subsequent reaction followed by workup.<br>
Suitable pressure-resistant reactors are known to the skilled worker and are described, for example, in Ullmanns Enzyklopadie der technischen Chemie, Vol. 1, 3rd edition, 1951, pages 769 et seq. An autoclave is generally used for the novel process and may, if required, be equipped with a stirring device and an inner lining. The following should preferably be noted for the above steps:<br>
Step a):<br>
The pressure-resistant reactor is charged before starting the reaction with the partially hydrogenated C4 cut, hydrogen cyanide, a hydrocyanation catalyst and, where appropriate, a solvent. Suitable solvents in this case are those mentioned previously for the preparation of the novel catalysts, preferably aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene and xylene, or tetrahydrofuran.<br>
Step b):<br>
The mixture is generally reacted at elevated temperature under elevated pressure. This reaction is generally carried out at about 0 to 2000c, preferably about 50 to 150^0, more preferably 70 to 120
Step c):<br>
It is possible to complete the reaction by subsequent reaction for from 0 minutes to about 5 hours, preferably about 1 hour to 3.5 hours, during which no further hydrogen cyanide is fed into the autoclave. The temperature during this is kept essentially constant at the reaction temperature previously set. Workup takes place by conventional processes and comprises removing the unreacted 1,3-butadiene and unreacted hydrogen cyanide, for example by washing or extraction, and workup by distillation of the remaining reaction mixture to remove the required products and recover the still active catalyst.<br>
In another suitable variant of the novel process, the addition of hydrogen cyanide onto the 1,3-butadiene-containing hydrocarbon mixture takes place batchwise. The reaction conditions in this<br><br>
case are essentially those described for the semicontinuous process, with the hydrogen cyanide being entirely present from the outset, so there is no additional feeding in taking place in step b).<br>
In general, the preparation of adiponitrile from a butadiene-containing mixture by addition of 2 mole equivalents of hydrogen cyanide can be divided into three steps:<br>
1.	Preparation of Cs-monoolefin mixtures with nitrile functionality.<br>
2.	Isomerization of the 2-methyl-3-butenonitrile present in these mixtures to 3-pentenonitrile and isomerization of the 3-pentenonitrile formed in this way and already present in the mixtures from step 1 to various n-pentenonitriles. The aim here is form the maximum amount of 3-pentenonitrile and 4-pentenonitrile and the minimum amount of conjugated 2-pentenonitrile and 2-methyl-2-butenonitrile, which may act as catalyst poisons.<br>
3.	Preparation of adiponitrile by addition of hydrogen cyanide onto 3-pentenonitrile which was formed in step 2 and is previously isomerized in situ to 4-pentenonitrile. Byproducts occurring in this case are, for example, 2-methyl-glutaronitrile from Markownikoff addition of hydrogen cyanide onto 4-pentenonitrile or anti-Markownikoff addition of hydrogen cyanide onto 3-penteno.nitrile, and ethylsuccinonitrile from Markownikoff addition of hydrogen cyanide onto 3-pentenonitrile.<br>
The novel catalysts based on phosphonite ligands are also suitable and advantageous for the positional and double-bond isomerization in step 2 and/or the second addition of hydrogen cyanide in step 3.<br>
In a suitable embodiment of the novel process, the ratio of the amounts of 3-pentenonitrile and 2-methyl-3-butenonitrile obtained in the monoaddition of hydrogen cyanide onto the 1,3-butadiene-containing hydrocarbon mixture is at least 1.9:1, preferably at least 2.1:1.<br>
It is advantageous that the catalysts employed according to the invention not only show high selectivity with regard to the monoaddition products obtained on hydrocyanation of<br><br>
1,3-butadiene-containing hydrocarbon mixtures, but can also be mixed with an excess of hydrogen cyanide in the hydrocyanation with negligible separation out of inactive nickel(II) compounds such as nickel(II) cyanide. In contrast to known hydrocyanation catalysts based on noncomplex phosphine and phosphite ligands, the catalysts of the formula I are thus suitable not only for continuous hydrocyanation processes in which an excess of hydrogen cyanide in the reaction mixture can generally be effectively avoided, but also for semicontinuous processes and batch processes in which a large excess of hydrogen cyanide is generally present. Thus, the catalysts employed according to the invention, and the hydrocyanation processes based on them, generally show higher catalyst recycling rates and longer catalyst useful lives than known processes. This is advantageous not only economically but also from the ecological viewpoint because the nickel cyanide formed from the active catalyst with hydrogen cyanide is highly poisonous and must be reprocessed or disposed of at high cost.<br>
Besides the hydrocyanation of 1,3-butadiene-containing hydrocarbon mixtures, the catalysts of the formula I are generally suitable for all conventional hydrocyanation processes. Mention may be made in this connection in particular of the hydrocyanation of nonactivated olefins, eg. of styrene and 3-pentenonitrile.<br>
The catalysts described above and comprising chiral phosphonite ligands of the formula I are suitable for enantioselective hydrocyanation.<br>
