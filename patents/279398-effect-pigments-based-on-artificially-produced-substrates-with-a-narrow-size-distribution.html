				<td>Effect pigments based on artificially produced substrates with a narrow size distribution<br>
The present invention relates to new effect pigments which are based on artificial substrates and which feature improved optical properties.<br>
The present invention further relates to a new process for producing these effect pigments and also to their use in cosmetics, paints, printing inks, varnishes, powder coating materials, and plastics.<br>
The optical effect of effect pigments is based on the directed reflection of light at predominantly planar, light-refracting pigment particles which are aligned substantially parallel to one another. These pigments particles generally have a substantially transparent substrate and one or more coatings on the substrate. Depending on the composition of the coating (s) of the pigment particles, interference, reflection, and absorption phenomena produce perceptions of color and lightness. Irregularities in the substrate surface to be coated, or colored impurities in the substrate, can lead to unwanted scattered-light effects or instances of unclean color in the end product. These unwanted scattered-light effects and/or color impurities occur particularly when natural substrate materials are used, such as natural mica. In circumventing the aforementioned drawbacks, artificial substrates afford new opportunities for high-quality ' pigments with new color and luster effects.<br>
US Patent 3,331,699 A describes pearlescent pigments based on glass flakes with interference colors and an intense sparkle effect. The glass flakes are coated with a translucent metal oxide layer of high index. The color of the pigments is dependent on the selected metal oxide and on the thickness of the metal oxide layer.<br>
The metal-coated glass flakes coated to counter corrosive effects with an additional protective layer of metal oxides such as SiO2, Al2O3 or TiO2 are described in US Patent 5,436,077 A. These coated glass flakes are comparable in terms of their appearance with metal foils.<br>
Glass flakes coated with titanium oxides and/or iron oxides are known from US Patent 6,045,914 A. The average particle size of the glass flakes is situated in a range from approximately 1 to 250 µm, the thickness being around 0.1 to 10 µm.<br>
WO 2004/055119 Al describes interference pigments which are based on coated platelet-shaped substrates. The substrates in this case are covered with a first layer of SiO2 to which is applied subsequently a high-index layer consisting, for example, of TiO2, Zr02, SnO2, Cr2O3, Fe2O3 or Fe3O4, or an interference system comprising alternating high-index and low-index layers. Optionally the pigments may further have an outer protective layer.<br>
Thermally and mechanically stable, metal oxide-coated effect pigments based on thin glass flakes with a thickness 
The optical properties of effect pigments can be influenced, in accordance with WO 2006/110359 A2, by an appropriate particle size distribution. The classified, metal oxide-coated glass flakes described therein have<br>
a D10 of at least 9.5 µm, preferably of 9.5 µm. A drawback is that the pigments have to have a size range with a D9, value of nor more than 8 5 µm, preferably of about 45 µm. Consectuently, in accordance with the teaching of WO 2006/110359 A2, only small-particle effect pigments with enhanced sparkle effect can be provided.<br>
Performance drawbacks, such as the clogging of filters, for example, can be prevented in accordance with the teaching of WO 2007/114442 Al by an appropriate particle size distribution, in which the D10 is between 4.7 and 25 µm and the ratio of D90 to D10 is between 2 and 3.<br>
A drawback of the effect pigments known to date in the prior art is that their color purity is low. Hence a viewer viewing a plurality of effect pigments from one batch under a light microscope will see effect pigments having a variety of colors - that is, colors which are different from one another.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide new effect pigments having improved optical properties, more particularly having a color purity which is increased relative to the prior art, at a constant angle of light incidence and angle of viewing. It is a further object of the invention to provide a process for producing these effect pigments.<br>
This object has been achieved by a provision of effect pigments comprising artificial platelet-shaped substrates which have at least one optically active coating, where the effect pigments have a volume-averaged cumulative undersize distribution curve with<br>
the characteristic numbers D10,	D50	and	D90,	said <br>
cumulative undersize distribution curve having a span ΔD of 0.7 - 1.4, and the span ΔD being calculated in accordance with formula (1):<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
and the average thickness of the artificial platelet-shaped substrates being 500 nm to 2000 nm.<br>
Preferred developments are specified in dependent claims 2 to 10.<br>
The object has further been achieved through the provision of a process for producing the effect pigments of the invention, comprising the following steps:<br>
a)	size-classifying the artificial substrates,<br>
b)	coating the artificial substrates.<br>
The coating of substrates in step b) takes place preferably after the size-classifying in step a).<br>
Further provided by the invention is the use of the effect pigments of the invention in cosmetics, plastics, and coating compositions, such as paints, printing inks, varnishes, powder coating materials, and electrocoat materials. The invention accordingly provides compositions which comprise the effect pigments of the invention.<br>
Effect pigments having improved optical properties are, for the purposes of this invention, effect pigments notable in particular for their high color purity at a constant angle of light incidence and angle of viewing. In their respective entirety, then, the effect pigments of the invention have a uniform color or a uniform hue. For a viewer, therefore, there are no marked color differences from one effect pigment of the invention to the next effect pigment of the invention in an entirety.<br>
Surprisingly it has been found that substrates having a narrow span in the particle size distribution and coated with at least one optically active coating exhibit a markedly higher color purity than effect pigments having a broader span, as is the case in the prior art.<br>
The   invention   characterizes   the   particle	size<br>
distribution using the span ΔD, defined as ΔD =	(D90-<br>
D10)/D50. The smaller the span, the narrower	the<br>
particle size distribution.<br>
The D10 value indicates the value of the longitudinal dimension of the effect pigments, as determined by means of laser granulometry in the form of the sphere equivalent, which 10% of the pigment particles attain at most, or fall below, out of the entirety of all the particles. Correspondingly, the D50 value and the D90 value, respectively, indicate the maximum longitudinal dimensions of the effect pigments, as determined oy means of laser granulometry in the form of sphere equivalents, which 50% or 90% of the particles attain at maximum, or fall below, out of the entirety of all the particles.<br>
The effect pigments of the invention possess a span ΔD in a range from 0.7 to 1.4, preferably from 0.7 to 1.3, more preferably from 0.8 to 1.2, very preferably from 0.8 to 1.1.<br>
Above a span ΔD of 1.4, the effect pigments obtained lack color purity. Effect pigments below a size distribution span of 0.7 are very costly and inconvenient to produce by the usual methods, and hence can no longer be produced economically.<br>
The effect pigments of the invention may have any desired median particle size (D50) . The D50 values of the effect pigments of the invention encompass a range<br>
from 3 to 350 µm. The effect pigments of the invention preferably have a D50 value in a range of 3-15 µm or 10-35 µm or 25-45 µm or 30-65 µm or 4 0-14 0 µm or 135-2 50 µm.<br>
The D10 values of the effect pigments of the invention encompass preferably a range from 1 to 120 µm. Preferably the effect pigments of the invention have the combinations of D90, D50 and D10 values as specified in Table 2. In the present case, the D10, D50, and D90 values of Table 2 are combined only in such a way as to produce a span ΔD of 0.7-1.4. Combinations of D10, D50, and D90 values that lead to a span which is not within the ΔD range of 0.7-1.4 are not inventive embodiments.<br>
Table 2: Preferred combinations of ranges of D90, D50, and D10 values<br>
(Table Removed ) <br>
It has surprisingly been found that the combinations of ranges of D90, D50 and D10 values as specified in Table 2 produce effect pigments of extremely high color purity.<br>
In this context it has surprisingly emerged that it is not the absolute size of the effect pigments that is critical but rather the proportion of the sizes to one another. It is critical that the span ΔD = (D90-D10)/D50 is situated within a narrow range from 0.7 to .1.4. Within this range, for example, the D50 values of the effect pigments may be 15, 20, 25, 30 µm or else 50, 80, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300 or 350 µm. It has been found that surprisingly, even in the case of a majority<br>
 <br>
of relatively large effect pigments, effect pigments of color purity are obtained if the span ΔD is situated in a range from 0.7 to 1.1.<br>
The average thickness of the artificial platelet-shaped substrates is 500 nm to 2000 nm and preferably 750 to<br>
150 0 nm.<br>
The aspect ratio of the effect pigments of the invention, calculated from the quotient of particle diameter to thickness, is preferably 2-980, more preferably 5-950, and very preferably 10-920.<br>
If substrates below an average thickness of 500 nm are coated with high-index metal oxides, then the substrate has a marked optical influence on the interference color of the system as a whole. The effect pigments obtained, consequently, no longer have the desired high color purity. Moreover, there is a marked decrease in the mechanical stability of these effect pigments with respect, for example, to shearing forces. Furthermore, the times taken to coat these thin substrates with, for example, high-index metal oxides or semi-transparent metals, owing to the high specific surface areas of these pigments, are very long, resulting in high production costs.<br>
Above an average substrate layer thickness of 2000 nm, the effect pigments become too thick overall. This entails a poorer opacity and also a lower level of plane-parallel orientation within the application medium. The poorer orientation results in turn in a reduced luster.<br>
In one preferred embodiment the standard deviation of the thickness of the artificial substrates is 15% to 1001 and more preferably 20% to 70%.<br>
The average thickness :s determined on the basis of a cured paint film in which the effect pigments are oriented substantially plane-parallel to the substrate. For this purpose a transverse section of the cured paint film is examined under a scanning electron microscope (SEM), the thickness of 100 effect pigments being ascertained and statistically averaged.<br>
Below a standard deviation of 15%, the effect pigments obtained exhibit color flop. Above a standard deviation of 100%, the collective of pigments as a whole contains so many relatively thick pigments that orientation is then poorer and hence luster is lost.<br>
It has surprisingly been found that effect pigments whose artificial substrates have an average thickness of 500 to 2000 nm and also a span ΔD of 0.7 to 1.4 exhibit the desired extraordinary color purity at a constant angle of light incidence and angle of viewing.<br>
The effect pigments are preferably pearlescent pigments or optically variable pigments.<br>
The effect pigments of the invention may also be present here in a mixture with other effect pigments.<br>
Effect pigments based on natural mica have been known for some considerable time. When using natural mica as a substrate, however, it is necessary to accept that its surface is not ideally smooth but instead has irregularities, such as steps, for example. These irregularities limit the quality of the resultant effect pigments, since they often lead to different colors within the same. pigment platelet. This considerably reduces the color purity in particular. Furthermore, the foreign ion impurities that are present in natural mica may alter the perceived color of the effect pigments, with the consequence that a plurality  of  effect  pigments  originating  from  one<br>
production batch have differing colors or hues, thus giving the pigment mixture a lew color purity.<br>
These disadvantages of natural mica can be circumvented through the use of artificial substrates. Artificial substrates are substrates which do not occur as such in nature but instead must be synthesized. Suitable base substrates for the effect pigments of the invention are, for example, synthetic, nonmetallic, platelet-shaped substrates. The substrates are preferably substantially transparent, more preferably transparent.<br>
One preferred variant of the invention uses as substrates glass platelets (i.e., glass flakes), platelets of synthetic mica, SiO2 platelets, polymer platelets, platelet-shaped bismuth oxychloride and/or platelet-shaped aluminum oxides or mixtures thereof. For the effect pigments of the invention it is preferred to use substrates consisting of glass platelets or synthetic mica.<br>
The effect pigments of the invention may be substrates provided with one or more optically active layers or coatings. An optically active layer or coating is a layer or coating at which incident light gives rise to perceptible color effects by virtue of physical effects such as reflection, interference, absorption, refraction, etc.<br>
As optically active layers or coatings it is preferred to apply layers which comprise metal oxides, metal oxide   hydrates,   metal   suboxides,   metals,   metal<br>
fluorides, metal nitrides, metal oxynitrides or mixtures thereof. In one preferred variant the optically active layers or coatings are composed of the aforementioned materials.<br>
Unless indicated otherwise, the terms "layers" or "coatings" are used interchangeably for the purposes of this invention.<br>
In one preferred variant: of the invention a coating or two or more coatings may have a refractive index n ≥ 1.9, and hence are nigh-index.<br>
If the effect pigments of the invention have two or more layers, these layers, in relation to refractive index, are preferably arranged in alternation, so that a high-index layer having a refractive index of n &gt; 1.9 is followed preferably by a low-index layer having a refractive index n 
The coating in this case may either surround the entire substrate or be present only partially on the substrate. The metal oxide, metal oxide hydrate, metal suboxide, metal, metal fluoride, metal nitride or metal cxynitride layers, or layers with mixtures of the aforementioned compounds, may be low-index (refractive index  1.9).<br>
In one preferred embodiment the substrate is or comprises a low-index platelet-shaped substrate and the coating has at least one high-index layer (n &gt; 1.9) . Substrate platelets used with preference are glass platelets, synthetic mica platelets and/or SiO2 platelets.<br>
Metal  oxides  and/or metal  oxide  hydrates  used are preferably titanium oxide, titanium dioxide, titanium oxide hydrate, aluminum oxide, aluminum oxide hydrate, silicon  oxide,  silicon  dioxide,  iron  oxide,  iron hydroxide,  tin oxide,  chromium oxide,  antimony oxide, cerium oxide or their mixed oxides.<br>
In a further inventive embodiment of the invention the substrates are coated with metal layers. In this case<br>
 <br>
it is preferred to apply semitransparent metal layers in order to provide effect pigments having interference colors in accordance with the Fabry-Perot effect.<br>
Suitable metals for generating the semitransparent metal layers are, for example, aluminum, chromium, nickel, silver, gold, titanium, copper or their alloys.<br>
The thickness of the semitransparent metal layers is situated preferably in a range from 4 to 40 nm and more preferably 5 to 30 nm.<br>
As a metal fluoride, one variant applies magnesium fluoride as a coating. As metal nitrides or metal oxynitrides it is possible, for example, to use those of the metals titanium, zirconium and/or tantalum.<br>
The substrate is coated preferably with metal oxide layers and/or metal oxide hydrate layers.<br>
Examples of low-index layers include aluminum oxide, aluminum oxide hydrate, silicon oxide, silicon oxide hydrate and/or magnesium fluoride.<br>
Examples  of  high-index  layers  used  are  titanium dioxide,   titanium   suboxides,   iron   oxide,   iron hydroxide,  tin  oxide,  zinc  oxide,  zirconium oxide, cerium oxide,  cobalt oxide,  chromium oxide,  antimony oxide or their mixed oxides.<br>
Different colors in the effect pigments of the invention can be set here through the choice of layer material and layer thickness, as shown for example by Table 1.<br>
(Table Removed ) <br>
Where the effect pigments of the invention have a coating with titanium dioxide, the titanium dioxide may be present in the rutile or anatase crystal polymorph. The best-quality and most stable pearlescent pigments are obtained when the titanium dioxide layer is in the rutile form. The rutile form can be obtained by, for example, applying a layer of SnO2 to the substrate or the pigment before the titanium dioxide layer is applied. Applied to a layer of SnO2, TiO2 crystallizes in the rutile polymorph.<br>
The thickness of the metal oxide, metal oxide hydrate, metal suboxide, metal, metal fluoride or metal nitride layers or of layers with a mixture of the aforementioned compounds is situated typically in a range of 30 - 350 nm, more preferably of 50 - 300 nm.<br>
 <br>
The metal oxide, metal oxide hydrate, metal suboxide, metal, metal fluoride and/or metal nitride layers may contain or comprise colorants such as Prussian Blue, ultramarine, carmine red, azopigments, phthalocyanines or FD &amp; C dyes/lakes. These colorants may be present in the coating and/or applied to this coating and if necessary fixed thereon by adhesion promoters.<br>
In order to provide better protection from weathering effects to the effect pigments of the invention they may additionally be coated with an outer protective layer. This layer comprises or is composed preferably of one or two metal oxide layers of the elements Si, Al or Ce. Particular preference is given here to a sequence in which first of all a cerium oxide layer is applied and is then followed by an SiO2 layer, as described in WO 2006/021386 Al, hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
The outer protective layer may also be organic-chemically modified on the surface. By way of example, one or more silanes may be applied to this outer protective layer. The silanes may be alkylsilanes having branched-chain or unbranched alkyl radicals of 1 to 24 C atoms, preferably 6 to 18 C atoms.<br>
The silanes may alternatively be organofunctional silanes which allow chemical attachment to a plastic, a binder of a paint or of an ink, etc.<br>
The organofunctional silanes which are used preferably as surface modifiers and which contain suitable functional groups are available commercially and are produced, for example, by Degussa, Rheinfelden, Germany and sold under the trade name "Dynasylan®". Other products can be acquired from OSi Specialties (Silquest® silanes) or from Wacker, examples being standard silanes and a silanes from the GENIOSIL product group.<br>

It is also possible, however, to use other organof unctional silanes on the effect pigments of the invention.<br>
Additionally it is possible to use aqueous prehydrolyzates which are obtainable commercially, for example, from Degussa. These include, among others, aqueous, alcohol-free aminosilane hydrolyzate (Dynasylan Hydrosil 1151), aqueous, alcohol-free, amino/alkyl-functional siloxane cooligomer (Dynasylan Hydrosil 2627), aqueous, alcohol-free diamino/alkyl-functional siloxane cooligomer (Dynasylan Hydrosil 2776), aqueous, alcohol-free amino/vinyl-functional siloxane cooligomer (Dynasylan Hydrosil 2907), aqueous, alcohol-free amino/alkyl-functional siloxane cooligomer (Dynasylan Hydrosil 2909), aqueous, alcohol-free epoxy-functional siloxane oligomer (Dynasylan Hydrosil 2926) or aqueous, alcohol-free amino/methacrylate-functional siloxane cooligomer (nynasylan Hydrosil 2929', oligomeric diaminosilane system (Dynasylan 1146), vinyl/alkyl-functional siloxane cooligomer (Dynasylan 6598), vinyl- and methoxy-containing vinylsilane concentrate (oligomeric siloxane) (Dynasylan 6490) or oligomeric short-chain alkyl-functional silane (Dynasylan 9896).<br>
In one preferred embodiment the organofunctional silane mixture, in addition to at least one silane without a functional binding group, comprises at least one amino-functional silane. The amino function is a functional group which is able to enter into one or more chemical interactions with the majority of groups present in binders. Said interactions may involve a covalent bond, such as with isocyanate or carboxylate functions of the binder, for example, or hydrogen bonds, such as with OH or COOR functions, or else ionic interactions.

purpose of the chemical attachment of the effect pigment to different kinds of binders.<br>

In one further-preferred embodiment the silane without a functional binding group is an alkyl silane. The alkyl silane preferably has the formula (A):<br>
 <br>
In this formula z is an integer from 1 to 3, R is a substituted or unsubstituted, unbranched or branched alkyl chain having 10 to 22 C atoms, and X is a halogen and/or alkoxy group. Preferred alkyl silanes have alkyl chains with at least 12 C atoms. R may also be connected cyclically to Si, in which case z is typical ly 2 .<br>
A silane of this kind has the effect of strong hydrophobicization of the pigment surface. This in turn leads to the pearlescent pigment thus coated having a<br>
tendency to float upward in the surface coating. In the case of platelet-shaped effect pigments, behavior of this kind is referred to as "leafing".<br>
A silane mixture composed of at least one silane which possesses at least one functional group allowing attachment to the binder, and an alkyl silane which does not have an amino group and which is insoluble or virtually insoluble in water permits optimum performance properties on the part of the pearlescent pigments.<br>
An organic-chemical surface modification of this kind means that the effect pigments exhibit excellent orientation in a paint or ink film, i.e., are oriented substantially plane-parallel with respect to the painted or coated substrate, and at the same time react chemically with the binder system of the paint or ink and hence are bound covalently in the paint or ink film. Paint or ink films of rhis kind exhibit enhanced mechanical and chemical resistancw towrd environmental effects, such as weather, etc.<br>
When the effect pigments of the invention in an applicator drawdown (e.g., in a nitrocellulose varnish) are viewed in transmission under a light microscope, the effect pigments of the invention are seen to have a very uniform color. The individual pigments have largely the same color, preferably the same color.<br>
The color imparted by effect pigments, such as pearlescent pigments, is as a result of interference phenomena. In the context of these phenomena, interference colors which are complementary to one another are mutually extinguished: thus, for example, a mixture of blue and yellow pearlescent pigments produces a silver or grey color. It is well known that mixtures of different-colored pearlescent pigments always produce a less pure hue with a lower luster,<br>
owing  to  the  ever-present  mutual  extinction  or attenuation of certain color fractions.<br>
In order, therefore, to obtain effect pigments, preferably pearlescenr pigments, having a high color purity, it is necessary for the hues of the individual pigments to be as uniform, as possible. The purity of hue can be represented quantitatively by the following method in accordance with a statistical evaluation.<br>
The starting point for determining the color purity of the effect pigments of the invention are digital color microscope images of applicator drawdowns. Applicator drawdown is carried out with a paint comprising 6% by weight effect pigments in a colorless nitrocellulose varnish. The percent by weight quantities here are based on the total weight of the paint. The paint is applied in a wet film thickness of 76 µm to a BYK-Gardner black-white drawdown chart (byko-chart 2853) and subsequently dried. Within these dried applicator drawdowns, the platelet-shaped effect pigments have a largely plane-parallel orientation. The microscope images are taken preferably using the Axioskop 2 microscope and the AxioCam digital camera from Zeiss, Germany. From the resulting digital images, the AxioVision 4.6 image-recording and image-processing software from Zeiss is then used to prepare color-neutral digital images with a 12-bit depth of color. When the applicator drawdowns are observed through the microscope, the irradiated light is incident vertically from above onto the applicator drawdown. In the applicator drawdown, in turn, the effect pigments have a largely plane-parallel orientation, and hence the incident light falls perpendicularly onto the pigment platelets. The viewing angle is in this case likewise perpendicular to the surface of the pigment platelets.<br>
In order to obtain undistorted statistical data, around 20  individual micrographs  were produced at  randomly<br>
selected points on the black substrate of the applicator drawdowns. This constituted the imaging of more than 100 individual evaluable pigments.<br>
Since the image-processing software is unable to recognize the pigments automatically, they are marked manually. In the marking of the individual pigment area fractions, care should be taken to ensure that there is no recording of pigment marginal regions or regions in which the pigments overlap, since in this case the perceived color of the individual pigment particles is immediately distorted by the overlap (see also figure 1) .<br>
For the areas thus marked, the image-processing software calculates the respective area means of the red, green, and blue fractions. For meaningful statistics, the color fractions of at least 100 evaluable pigment particles are determined from the various micrographs.<br>
The  image-processing  software  uses  the  sRGB  color model.   Conversion  to  the  XYZ   color  space  is accomplished via the well-known transformation matrix (II) (IEC 61966-2-1:1999).<br>
(Equation Removed) <br>
The resulting X, Y, and Z values are then converted into the customary CIE (1976) Lab values:<br>
(Equation Removed)  <br>
The calculation for Y* and Z* is made in a manner similar to that for the calculation of X*. The tristimulus values used were Xn = 94.81, Yn = 100 and Zn = 107.34 for the D65 illuminant and the 10° standard observer.<br>
This produces a distribution of measurement points in the a*-b* color space (see also figure 2): the distance of the measurement points from the origin of the a*,b* diagram determines the color saturation (chroma) C* of each individual measurement value.<br>
The scattering is quantified by first calculating the common middle point (a,b) of the measurement values in the a*-b* color space in accordance with the formulae (VIIa; VIIb):<br>
(Equation Removed) <br>
Subsequently, for each measurement point (a,b), its distance from the middle point (a , b ) is determined as an absolute value ΔC* in the form of the root of the square of the difference in the values (VIII):<br>
(Equation Removed) <br>
This gives a color difference distribution in the a*-b* color space. This distribution may likewise be represented in the form of a cumulative undersize distribution curve. The 90% quantile (ΔC*90) of this color difference distribution is a suitable measure for characterizing the size of the color scattering (see figure 3) . This figure marks the color difference ΔC* of the mean value below which 90% of the counted pigment particles are situated.<br>
The effect pigments cf the invention preferably have a 90% quantile of the color difference distribution ΔC*90 of 0.2 to 8.0 and more preferably of 0.5 to 6.0; with further preference, of 0.6 to 5.0; with particular preference of 0.7 to 4.0, and with very particular preference of 0.7 to 3.0.<br>
The inventors have not as yet found any scientifically meaningful explanation for this surprising effect. It is, however, thought that the pigment substrates which are largely the same in their size are coated substantially more uniformly with the coloring layers -as, for example, high-index metal oxides or semitransparent metals - than is the case for substrates having a greater span ΔD. As a result, coatings with a substantially more homogeneous layer thickness are formed on the substrates. Since the color is imparted as a result of interference phenomena, and in the case of the substrates used is determined critically by the layer thickness of the high-index coating, the more uniform layer thicknesses give rise to a purer hue or a greater color purity in the case of the effect pigments of the invention.<br>
The present invention encompasses pearlescent pigments without color flop and also effect pigments with a high color flop in multilayer systems.<br>
The critical factor, however, is that, at constant angle of incidence and angle of viewing in an applicator drawdown, with largely plane-parallel orientation of the platelet-shaped effect pigments of the invention, the hue observed is always largely the same in the sense of tne present description. It is not necessary here for the angle of incidence and angle of viewing always to be perpendicular to the pigment platelets, although such a case is preferred.<br>
The effect pigments of the invention are suitable more particularly for application in cosmetics, such as, for example, body powder,  face powder,  compact and loose powder,  face  makeup,  powder  cream,  cream  makeup, emulsion makeup, wax makeup, foundation, mousse makeup, blusher,  eye  makeup  such  as  eye  shadow,  mascara, eyeliner,  liquid  eyeliner,  eyebrow pencil,  lip  care stick,  lipstick,  lip  gloss,  lip  liner,  hair-styling compositions such as hairspray, hair mousse, hair gel, hair wax,  hair mascara,  permanent or semi-permanent hair  colors,   temporary  hair  colors,   skin  care compositions such as lotions, gels, and emulsions, and nail varnish compositions.<br>
In order to obtain specific color effects in the cosmetic applications it is possible to use not only the effect pigments of the invention but also other colorants and/or conventional effect pigments or mixtures thereof, in variable proportions. Conventional effect pigments used may be, for example,- commercial pearlescent pigments based on natural mica coated with high-index metal oxides (such as the Prestige product group from Eckart, for example), BiOCl platelets, TiO2 platelets, pearlescent pigments based on synthetic mica coated with high-index metal oxides or based on glass flakes or Al2O3, SiO2 or TiO2 platelets coated with high-index metal oxides. In addition it is also possible to add metallic effect pigments, such as the Visionaire product group from Eckart, for example. The colorants may be selected from inorganic or organic pigments.<br>
Preferred effect pigments for the purposes of the present invention possess a span ΔD of 0.7 - 1.4, preferablv 0.7 — 1.3, more preferable 0.8 — 1.2, and very preferably 0.8 - 1.1, and a D50 value of 3 -350 µm. Their average thickness is 500 - 2000 nm; the standard deviation in the thickness is 15% - 100%.<br>
Further-preferred effect pigments for the purposes of the present invention possess a span ΔD of 0.8 - 1.2, a D50 value of in each case preferably 3 - 15 µm, 10 -35 µm, 25 - 45|am, 30 - 65 µm, 40 - 140 (am or 135 -250 (am. Their average thickness is 500 - 2000 nm, and the standard deviation in the thickness is 15% - 100%.<br>
Further-preferred effect pigments for the purposes of the present invention possess a span ΔD of 0.8 - 1.2 and an average thickness of 500 - 2000 nm, more preferably of 750 - 1500 nm. The standard deviation in the thickness is 15% - 100%, and the effect pigments have a D50 value of 3 - 350 (am.<br>
Further-preferred effect pigments for the purposes of the present invention possess a span ΔD of 0.8 - 1.2 and a standard deviation in the thickness of 20% - 70%. The average thickness of the effect pigments is 500 -2000 nm, preferably 750 - 1500 nm. They have a D50 value of 3 - 350 µm.<br>
A process for producing the effect pigments of the invention comprises the following steps:<br>
a)	size-classifying the artificial substrates<br>
b)	coating the artificial substrates.<br>
If the starting substrates are too large, it is possible optionally to carry out a comminuting step prior to the size-classifying.<br>
The size classification may take place before or after the coating of the substrates. Advantageously, however, the substrate is first classified and then coated. The size classification is carried out and repeated as and where necessary, until the pearlescent pigments have the inventive particle size distribution.<br>
A narrow span ΔD of the substrates can be achieved through   suitable   comminuting   and/or   classifying<br>
operations on the artificial substrates to be coated. The artificial substrates to be coated may be comminuted using, for example, a ball mill, jet or agitator ball mill, edge runner mill or dissolver. The span ΔD of the final fraction can be set by means of appropriate classification, such as by multiple wet sieving, for example. Further classification methods include centrifugation in cyclones or sedimentation from a dispersion.<br>
The comminuting and classifying operations may take place in succession and as and where necessary may be combined with one another. For instance, a classifying operation may follow a comminuting operation, which is followed by a further comminuting operation on the fine fraction, and so on.<br>
The object on which the invention is based is achieved, additionally, by the provision of a coating composition which comprises the effect pigments of any of claims 1 to 10. In one preferred variant the coating composition is selected from the group consisting of cosmetics, paint, printing ink, varnish, powder coating material, and electrocoat material.<br>
The object on which the invention is based is further achieved by the provision of a plastic which comprises the effect pigments of any of claims 1 to 10.<br>
In the text below, the invention is elucidated in more detail by a number of examples and figures, without being confined thereto.<br>

The examples below are intended to elucidate the invention in more detail, but without restricting it thereto.<br>
Example 1:<br>
A suspension of 200 g of glass flakes (average thickness: 1 µm, standard deviation of the thickness: around 40%) in DI water (around 3% by weight) (DI: deionized water: fully demineralized) is classified on a 100 µm sieve, and the sieve undersize is sieved in turn on a 63 µm sieve. This sieving procedure is repeated twice with the residue obtained on the 63 µm sieve, to give a glass flake fraction whose particle size distribution (MALVERN Mastersizer MS 2000) is as follows: D10 = 50 µm, D50 = 82 µm, D90 = 132 µm, Span ΔD = 1.00.<br>
Example 2:<br>
200 g of glass flakes from example 1 are suspended in 2000 ml of deionized water and the suspension is heated to 80°C with turbulent stirring. The pH of the suspension is adjusted to 1.9 using dilute HC1 and then a first layer of "SnO2" is precipitated onto the glass flakes. This layer is formed by addition of a solution consisting of 3 g of SnCl,3 x 5 H2O (in 10 ml of concentrated HCl D] US 50 ml of deionized water) , with simultaneous metering of 10% NaOH in order to keep the pH constant, over a period of 1 hour. In order to complete the precipitation, the suspension is stirred for a further 15 minutes. Thereafter the pH is lowered<br>
to 1.6 using dilute HC1, and a solution of 200 ml of TiCl4 (400 g TiCl4/1 deionized water) is then metered into this suspension. The pH is kept at a constant 1.6 by counter-addition of 10% NaOH. This is followed by stirring for 15 minutes more and by filtration, the filter cake being rinsed with deionized water. The filter cake is then subjected to initial drying at 100°C and to calcining at 750°C for 30 minutes. A highly lustrous effect pigment is obtained which shows a red interference color. Microscopic investigation of the coated pigments shows extraordinary consistency in the color of the pigments.<br>
Example 3:<br>
200 g of glass flakes from example 1 are coated by the method of example 2 with TiO2, but with metered addition of only 167 ml of TiCl4. The product after calcining is a highly lustrous effect pigment having a golden interference color. Microscopic investigation, in the same way as in example 2, shows an extraordinary consistency in color of the pigments.<br>
Comparative example 4:<br>
Commercially  available  golden  pearlescent  "Reflecks Dimension Sparkling Gold" pigments from BASF Catalysts.<br>
Comparative example 5:<br>
Commercially  available  golden  pearlescent  "RonaStar Golden Sparks" pigments from Merck.<br>
Table 3: Characteristic size distribution values for some inventive and comparative examples:<br>
(Table Removed ) <br>
Below, the inventive effect pigments of example 3, with a narrow span and high color purity, were compared in a detailed analysis with the commercially available pearlescent pigments of the comparative examples. All of the pearlescent pigments in the form of an applicator drawdown have a golden interference color which is perceptible visually to the observer.<br>
The starring point for the determination of the color purity of the inventive effect pigments were digital color microscope images of dried applicator drawdowns (produced with a paint containing 6% by weight pigments in nicrocellulose varnish (% by weight figure is based on the total weight of the paint) and knife-coated in a wet film thickness of 76 µm onto a BYK-Gardner black-white drawdown chart (byko-chart 2853), and subsequently dried at room temperature). These images were recorded using the Axioskop 2 microscope and the AxioCam digital camera from Zeiss. This equipment allowed the preparation, with the aid of the AxioVision 4.6 image-recording and image-processing software, of color-neutral digital images with a 12-bit depth of color.<br>
In order to obtain distortion-free statistical data, around 20 individual micrographs were taken at randomly selected locations on the applicator drawdowns.  Cver<br>
100 individual evaluable pigments were imaged in this procedure.<br>
In fig. 2 the color loci of the individual measurements of the three samples are plotted in the a*,b* diagram. It is clearly evident that the inventive effect pigments, in contrast to the commercially available products, have the lowest scattering in the a*-b* color space, i.e., have the purest color. The color values are situated closely together in the red-yellow quadrant of the a*-b* color space. The greatest scattering, i.e., the pigments colored with the least uniformity, is observed for the pigments of comparative example 4. This is also apparent even with the naked eye from the applicator drawdowns. A somewhat narrower scattering, but nevertheless a distribution over the green-yellow and red-yellow quadrants of the a*-b* color space, is present in the case of the Merck Ronastar pigments (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany).<br>

The 90% quantile of the color difference distribution is the lowest for the inventive effect pigments of<br>

Example 6:<br>
200 g of glass flakes from example 1 are suspended in 2000 ml of deionized water and the suspension is heated<br>
to 80°C with turbulent stirring. The pH of the suspension is adjusteo to 1.9 using dilute HC1 and then a first layer of "SnO2" is precipitated onto the glass flakes. This layer is formed by addition of a solution consisting of 3 g of SnCl4 x 5 H2O (in 10 ml of concentrated HC1 plus 50 ml of deionized water) , with simultaneous metering of 10% NaOH in order to keep the pH constant, over a period of 1 hour. In order to complete the precipitation, the suspension is stirred for a further 15 minutes. Thereafter the pH is lowered to 1.6 using dilute HC1, and a solution of 185 ml of TiCl4 (400 g TiCl4/l deionized water) is then metered into this suspension. The pH is kept at a constant 1.6 by counter-addition of 10% NaOH. Thereafter the pH is raised to 7.5 using 5% NaOH, and stirring takes place for 15 minutes. A waterglass solution (207 g of waterglass solution, 27% SiO2, mixed with 207 g of deionized water) is then introduced slowly into the suspension, and the pH is kept constant at 7.5. This is followed by stirring for 20 minutes more, and the pH is lowered again to 1.9. Then a second layer of "Sn02" is deposited on the SiO2 surface. This layer is formed by addition of a solution consisting of 3 g of SnCl4 x 5 H20 (in 10 ml of concentrated HC1 plus 50 ml of deionized water), with simultaneous metered addition of a 10% NaOH, in order to keep the pH constant, over a period of 1 hour. In order to complete the precipitation, the suspension is stirred for a further 15 minutes. After that the pH is lowered to 1.6 using dilute HC1, and a solution of 189 ml of TiCl4 (400 g TiCl4/l deionized water) is then metered into the suspension. In the course of this procedure, the pH is kept constant at 1.6 by counter-addition of 10% NaOH. This is followed by stirring for 15 minutes more and by filtration, the filter cake being rinsed with deionized water. The filter caKe is then subjected to initial drying at 100°C and to calcining at 750°C for 30 minutes. An extremely highly lustrous effect pigment is obtained which exhibits a color flop, with a change<br>
from a green interference color for steep viewing angles into a blue interference color at a shallow viewing angle.<br>
