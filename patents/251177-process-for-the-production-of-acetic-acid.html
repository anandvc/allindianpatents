				<td>PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF ACETIC ACID<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the production of acetic acid by the carbonylation of methanol and in particular to a process for the production of acetic acid by the carbonylation of methanol in the presence of an iridium carbonylation catalyst and a promoter.<br>
The production of acetic acid by the carbonylation of methanol in the presence of an iridium catalyst and ruthenium promoter is described for example in US 5672743, EP-A-0752406, EP-A-0849248, EP-A-0849249, EP-A-0849250, EP-A-0999198 and EP-A-1002785. In such liquid phase carbonylation processes, the acetic acid product may be recovered by withdrawing the liquid carbonylation composition from the carbonylation reactor subjecting the composition to one or more separation stages to recover the acetic acid product and returning other components of the composition to the carbonylation reactor.<br>
EP-A-0728729 relates to a process for purifying a carboxylic acid fraction obtained by liquid phase carbonylation in which volatile iridium and/or volatile co-promoter (such as ruthenium, osmium and rhenium) contaminants are converted to involatile forms by contacting with an iodide in the absence of carbon monoxide or at a partial pressure of carbon monoxide less than that of the carbonylation reaction. It is stated therein that the partial pressure of carbon monoxide may be from 0 to 5 bar, preferably, less than 0.25 bar. The addition of phosphonate compounds to the liquid reaction composition is not considered.<br>
There remains a need for an alternative and/or improved carbonylation process in which the partial pressure of the carbon monoxide during the acetic acid recovery stage and optional further reaction zone(s) may be reduced. A reduction in the partial<br>
pressure of carbon monoxide during product recovery allows an increase in the carbon efficiency of the carbonylation process.<br>
It has now been found that by using certain bis-phosphonate compounds in an indium-catalysed carbonylation process for the production of acetic acid, the partial pressure of carbon monoxide during the acetic acid recovery stage may be decreased.<br>
In addition, the use of certain bis-phosphonate compounds in an iridium-eatalysed carbonylation process for the production of acetic acid, allows high concentrations of promoter to be used resulting in the reduced formation of hydrogen and/or carbon dioxide by-products and an increased reaction rate.<br>
Thus, according to the present invention, there is provided a process for the production of acetic acid by carbonylating methanol and/or a reactive, derivative thereof in a carbonylation reactor in a liquid reaction composition comprising an iridium carbonylation catalyst, methyl iodide, methyl acetate, water, acetic acid and at least one promoter selected from the group consisting of ruthenium, rhenium and osmium, characterised in that there is also present in the reaction composition a bis-phosphonate compound having the formula :-<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
wherein R1, R2, R3, R4 are independently hydrogen or an organic functional group; Y is an optionally substituted C1-C10alkylene or C6-C10 aryl group.<br>
The present invention also provides a process for the production of acetic arid which process comprises the steps of (1) carbonylating methanol and/or a reactive derivative thereof in a carbonylation reactor in a liquid reaction composition comprising iridium carbonylation catalyst, methyl iodide, methyl acetate, acetic acid, water, at least one promoter selected from the group consisting of ruthenium, rhenium and osmium and a bis-phosphonate compound having the formula :-<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
wherein R1, R2, R3,'R4 are independently hydrogen or an organic functional group; Y is an optionally substituted C1- C10 alkylene or C6-C10 aryl group;<br>
(2)	withdrawing liquid reaction composition together with dissolved and/or entrained carbon monoxide and other gases from said carbonylation reactor;<br>
(3)	optionally passing said withdrawn liquid reaction composition through one or more further reaction zones to consume at least a portion of the dissolved and/or entrained carbon monoxide;<br>
(4)	passing said composition from step (2) and optional step (3) into one or more flash<br>
separation stages to form (i) a vapour fraction comprising condensable components and<br>
low pressure off-gas, the condensable components comprising acetic acid product and<br>
the low pressure off-gas comprising carbon monoxide and other gases dissolved and/or<br>
entrained with the withdrawn liquid carbonylation reaction composition and (ii) a liquid<br>
fraction comprising iridium carbonylation catalyst, promoter and acetic acid solvent;<br>
(5)	separating the condensable components from the low pressure off-gas; and<br>
(6)	recycling the liquid fraction from the flash separation stage to the carbonylation<br>
reactor.<br>
Advantageously, the use of the bis-phosphonate compounds of the present invention in a process for the production of acetic acid allows a reduction in the amount of propanoic acid by-product produced even at low partial pressures of carbon monoxide.<br>
In addition the use of certain bis-phosphonate compounds in an iridium-. catalysed carbonylation process for the production of acetic acid provides improved catalyst system (catalyst and promoter) stability at low carbon monoxide partial pressure during product recovery.<br>
Thus, the present invention also provides for the use of a bis-phosphonate compound of formula :-<br>
(Formula Removed) <br><br>
wherein Rl, R2, R3, R4 are independently hydrogen or an organic functional group; Y is an optionally substituted C1-C10 alkylene or C6-C10 aryl group, in a process for the production of acetic acid to reduce the amount of by-product propanoic acid and/or to stabilise the catalyst system, said process comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	carbonylating methanol and/or a reactive derivative thereof in a carbonylation reactor in a liquid reaction composition comprising an iridium carbonylation catalyst, methyl iodide, methyl acetate, water, acetic acid and at least one promoter selected from the group consisting of ruthenium, rhenium and osmium, withdrawing liquid reaction composition together with dissolved and/or entrained carbon monoxide and other gases from said carbonylation reactor;<br>
(b)	optionally passing said withdrawn liquid reaction composition through one or more further reaction zones to consume at least a portion of the dissolved and/or entrained carbon monoxide;<br>
(c)	passing said composition from step (a) and optional step (b) into one or more flash separation stages to form (i) a vapour fraction comprising condensable components and low pressure off-gas, the condensable components comprising acetic acid product and the low pressure off-gas comprising carbon monoxide and other gases dissolved and/or entrained with the withdrawn liquid carbonylation reaction composition and (ii) a liquid fraction comprising iridium carbonylation catalyst, promoter and acetic acid solvent;<br><br>

Preferably, the promoter- containing compounds are free of impurities which provide or generate in-situ ionic iodides which may inhibit the reaction, for example, alkali or alkaline earth metal or other metal salts.<br>
Preferably, the promoter is present in an effective amount up to the limit of its solubility in the liquid reaction compositions and/or any liquid process streams recycled to the carbonylation reaction zones from the acetic acid recovery stage. The promoter is suitably present in the liquid reaction compositions at a molar ratio of each promoter:<br>
iridium in the range [0.1 to 100]:1, preferably [greater than 0.5]:1, more preferably [greater than I]:l and preferably [up to 10]:1 such as [3 to 10] : 1, [4 to 8] : 1 or [4 to 6] : 1.<br>
Suitably, where the molar ratio of promoter : iridium is in the range [3 to 10] : 1, the molar ratio of bis-phosphonate : iridium is in the range [0.5 to 5] : 1.<br>
The concentration of promoter in the liquid reaction compositions in each of the first and second reaction zones is, independently, less than 8000 ppm, A suitable promoter concentration is 400 to 7000 ppm, such as 2000 to 5000 ppm.<br>
Although in general it is preferred to operate the process in the substantial absence of added iodide salt, i.e. a salt generating or dissociating an iodide ion, it may be possible under certain conditions to tolerate such a salt. Accordingly, ionic contaminants such as, for example, (a) corrosion metals, particularly nickel, iron and chromium and (b) phosphines or nitrogen-containing compounds or ligands which may quatemise in situ, should be kept to a minimum, or eliminated in the liquid reaction composition as these may generally have an adverse effect on the reaction by generating F in the liquid reaction composition which has an adverse effect on the reaction rate. Some corrosion metal contaminants such as for example molybdenum have been found to be less susceptible to the generation of I". Corrosion metals which have an adverse effect on the reaction rate may be minimised by using suitable corrosion resistant materials of construction. Similarly, contaminants such as alkali metal iodides, for example lithium iodide, should be kept to a minimum. Corrosion metal and other ionic impurities may be reduced by the use of a suitable ion exchange resin bed to treat the reaction composition, or preferably a catalyst recycle stream. Such a process is described in US 4007130. Preferably, ionic contaminants are kept below a concentration at which they would generate less than 500 ppm I", preferably less than 250 ppm I" in the liquid reaction composition, more preferably less than 50 ppm I".<br>
The carbon monoxide reactant for the carbonylation reactions may be essentially pure or may contain inert impurities such as carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen, noble gases, water and C1 to C4 paraffmic hydrocarbons. The presence of hydrogen in the<br>
carbon monoxide and generated in situ by the water gas.shift reaction is preferably kept low, for example, less than 1 bar partial pressure, as its presence may result in the formation of hydrogenation products. The partial pressure of carbon monoxide in the first and second reaction zones is suitably independently in the range 1 to 70 bar, preferably 1 to 35 bar and more preferably 1 to 15 bar.<br>
Acetic acid product may be recovered from the second reaction zone and optionally together with or separately from the first reaction zone by flash separation. In flash separation liquid reaction composition is passed to a flashing zone via a flashing valve. The flash separation zone may be an adiabatic flash vessel or may have additional heating means. In the flash separation zone a liquid fraction comprising the majority of the iridium catalyst and the majority of the promoter is separated from a vapour fraction comprising acetic acid, carbonylatable reactant, water and methyl iodide carbonylation co-catalyst and non-condensable gases such as nitrogen, carbon monoxide, hydrogen and carbon dioxide; the liquid fraction being recycled to the first reaction zone and the vapour fraction being passed to one or more distillation zones. In a first distillation zone acetic acid product is separated from the light components (methyl iodide and methyl acetate). The light components are removed overhead, and recycled to the first and/or second reaction zones. Also removed overhead is a low pressure off-gas comprising the non-condensable gases such as nitrogen, carbon monoxide, hydrogen and carbon dioxide. Such a low-pressure off-gas stream maybe passed through an off-gas treatment section to remove condensable materials such as methyl iodide, prior to being vented to atmosphere, for example, via a flare.<br>
Suitably, the concentration of carbon monoxide in the low pressure off gas is less than 40 mol %, preferably less than 20 mol% and the promoter concentration in the liquid reaction composition is up to 8000 ppm by weight.<br>
The acetic acid produced by the process according to the present invention may be further purified by conventional processes, for example further distillation to remove impurities such as water, unreacted carbonylation reactant and/or ester derivative thereof and higher-boiling by-products.<br>
The process of the present invention is preferably performed as a continuous process.<br>
The present invention will now be illustrated by way of example only and with reference to the following Examples and Figures 1 and 2. Figure 1 is a schematic diagram of the apparatus used in the Examples. Figure 2 is a graph of the effects of a bis-phosphonate compound on catalyst system stability for ca. 1200 ppm iridium with ca. 20% CO in the low-pressure off-gas. <br>

A 300cm zirconium autoclave, equipped with a stirrer and liquid injection<br>
facility was used for a series of batch autoclave experiments. The autoclave was pressure tested to 4x 106 N/m2 with nitrogen, then flushed three times with carbon monoxide up to lxl06/m2. An initial charge consisting of methyl acetate (approx 48.0g) acetic acid (approx 38.0g) methyl iodide (approx 13.3g) and water (approx 12.5g) was placed into the autoclave, which was then repurged with carbon monoxide and vented slowly to prevent loss of volatiles. Carbon monoxide (approx 6-7x 105 N/m2) was placed in the autoclave, which was then heated, with stirring (1500 rpm) to 190°C. A catalyst injection system was primed with approx 5.6g of iridium acetate catalyst solution (5.25% Ir w/w) and acetic acid (approx 8.7g) and injected with an overpressure of carbon monoxide to the hot autoclave, to bring the autoclave pressure to 2.8xl06N/m2.<br>
The reaction rate was monitored by drop in carbon monoxide pressure from a ballast vessel, typically pressured to 7xl06 N/m2. The autoclave temperature and pressure were maintained at a constant 190°C and 2.8x10 N/m throughout the reaction by pressure and coolant control valves. The reaction was terminated when the drop in ballast pressure became less than lxlO4 N/m2 per 5 minutes.<br>
After cooling, a gas analysis sample was taken, and the autoclave vented. The liquid components were discharged, and analysed for liquid by-products by gas chromatography. Detected components are quantified by integration of the component peaks relative to an external standard and expressed as parts per million (ppm) by weight.<br>
In the experiments, 'Total' propanoic acid was defined as the sum of propanoic acid and its precursors (ethyl acetate and ethyl iodide) converted to ppm propanoic acid) detected in the quenched liquid products of the batch reaction expressed in ppm.<br>
The rate of gas uptake at a certain point in a reaction run was used to calculate the carbonylation rate, as number.of moles of reactant consumed per litre of cold degassed reactor composition per hour (mol/(lxh) at a particular reactor composition (total reactor composition based on a cold degassed volume)<br>
The methyl acetate concentration was calculated during the course of the reaction from starting composition, assuming that one mole of methyl acetate was consumed for every mole of carbon monoxide that was consumed. No allowance was made for organic components in the autoclave headspace.<br>
By monitoring the rate of carbonylation reaction and calculating the<br>
concentration of the reaction components during the experiment, it is possible to determine the rate of carbonylation reaction which would be expected if a carbonylation process were to be operated continuously whilst maintaining under steady state, a liquid reaction composition which is the same as the total reaction composition calculated at any particular point in the batch experiment.<br>
In the experiments the term 'reaction composition' refers to the total composition of the components in the autoclave in the cold degassed state. Experiment A<br>
A baseline experiment was performed with the autoclave charged with methyl acetate (48.05g) acetic acid (53.00g) ruthenium acetate (6.94g) water (13.5g) methyl iodide (13.33g). The catalyst solution consisted of an iridium solution (6.3g) (5.25% Ir w/w) with acetic acid (8.70g). The approximate molar ratio of iridium to ruthenium was 1:2<br>
The rate of reaction, based on carbon monoxide uptake was measured to be 20.3 mol/l/h at a calculated reaction composition of 15% methyl acetate and steadily declined until virtually all the methyl acetate was consumed.<br>
Conversion to acetic acid was 98.9% based on methyl acetate consumed. Analysis of propanoic acid precursors gave a total propanoic acid make of 460 ppm. Gaseous by-products in the cold-vented off-gas were H22.8 mmol; CO2 3.2 mmol; CH4 5.2 mmol<br>
This is not an example according to the present invention because no bis-phosphonate compound was added to the liquid reaction composition. Experiment B<br>
A baseline experiment was performed with the autoclave charged with methyl acetate (48.05g) acetic acid (48.42g) ruthenium acetate (12.28g) water (13.86g) methyl iodide (13.31g). The catalyst solution consisted of an iridium solution (6.15g) (5.25% Ir w/w) with acetic acid (8.71g). The approximate molar ratio of iridium to ruthenium was 1:4<br>
The rate of reaction, based on carbon monoxide uptake was measured to be 23.4 mol/(lxh) at a calculated reaction composition of 15% methyl acetate and steadily declined until virtually all the methyl acetate was consumed.<br>
Conversion to acetic acid was 99.2% based on methyl acetate consumed. Analysis of propionic acid precursors gave a total propionic acid make of 460 ppm.<br>
Gaseous by-products in the cold-vented off-gas were not analysed.<br>
The cooled reaction mixture showed a clearly observable amount of precipitate.<br>
This is not an example according to the present invention because no bis-phosphonate compound was added to the liquid reaction composition. Example 1<br>
Experiment A was repeated except that bis dimethoxyphosphoryl benzene (dmpb) was added to the base of the autoclave in a molar ratio to Ir of 1:1. This is an example of the use of a bis-phosphonate compound according to the present invention. No precipitate could be observed in the cooled reaction mixture demonstrating increased catalyst stability under cool, carbon monoxide free conditions. Example 2<br>
Experiment B was repeated except that bis- dimethoxyphosphoryl benzene was added to the base of the autoclave in a molar ratio to Ir of 1:2. This is an example of the use of a bis-phosphonate compound according to the present invention. No precipitate could be observed in the cooled reaction mixture. Example 3<br>
Experiment B was repeated except that the molar ratio of Ir to Ru was increased to 1:6 and bis- dimethoxyphosphoryl benzene was added to the base of the autoclave in a molar ratio to Ir of 1:2. This is an example of the use of bis- dimethoxyphosphoryl benzene according to the present invention. No precipitate was observed in the cooled reaction mixture.<br>

The results in Table I demonstrate that the use of a bis-phosphonate compound according the present invention in an iridium-catalysed carbonylation process to produce acetic acid, allows<br>
reduction in the amount propanoic acid by-product without adversely affecting the reaction rate o<br>
amount of hydrogen or carbon dioxide by-products.<br>
General Reaction Method for Experiments C to H and Examples 4 to 23<br>
The apparatus used is shown in Figure 1. With reference to Figure 1 the apparatus comprised a stirred primary carbonylation reactor (1), a secondary carbonylation reactor (2), a flash tank (3) and a distillation column (not shown).<br>
Commercial grade methanol, which has been used to scrub the off-gas was carbonylated in the 6 litre primary reactor (1) in the presence of an iridium carbonylation catalyst and a ruthenium promoter at a pressure of 2.76 x 106N/m2 and a temperature of 190°C. The primary reactor (1) was fitted with a stirrer/propeller (4) and a baffle cage (not shown) to ensure intimate mixing of the liquid and gaseous reactants. Carbon monoxide was supplied to the primary reactor (1) via a sparge (5) Fitted beneath the stirrer (4). To minimise iron ingress into the primary reactor (1) the carbon monoxide was passed through a carbon filter (not shown). A jacket (not shown), through which the hot oil is circulated, enabled the reaction liquid in the primary reactor (1) to be maintained at a constant reaction temperature. The liquid reaction composition was analysed by near infra-red analysis and gas chromatography<br>
To purge inerts, high pressure off-gas was removed from the primary reactor (1) through line (6). It was passed through a condenser (not shown) before the pressure was dropped across valve (7) and mixed with the low pressure off-gas for it to be fed into the scrubbing system. Liquid reaction composition was withdrawn from the primary reactor (1) down a still well (8), through the secondary reactor (2), and then via line (9) into the flash tank (3) under reactor level control. In the flash tank (3) the liquid reaction composition was flashed down to a pressure of 1.48 x 105 N/m2. The resulting mixture of vapour and liquid was separated; the catalyst-rich liquid was returned to the primary reactor (1) by line (10) and pump (not shown) and the vapour was passed through a demister (12) and then directly into a distillation column (not shown) as vapour.<br>
The secondary reactor (2) comprised a pipe of diameter 2.5cm, length 30 cm and   . together with associated pipework had a volume of approximately 8 % of the primary reactor (1). The pipe was placed in parallel to the flashing line (9), and was provided with a supply of additional carbon monoxide via line 14. The secondary reactor (2) was operated at approximately the same pressure as the primary reactor (1).<br>
The vapour from the demister (12) enters the distillation column (not shown) where acetic acid is recovered from the vapour and a low pressure off-gas comprising carbon monoxide is passed to a scrubber (not shown) before being vented.<br>
The degree of catalyst precipitation was measured in conjunction with the liquid reaction composition by near infra red spectroscopy. The increase in the baseline absorbance has been found to directly correlate with the amount of precipitation. Experiment C<br>
Using the apparatus and method as described with reference to Figure 1, methanol was carbonylated in the primary reactor (1) at a rate of 20 mol/I/h (based on cold degassed reaction volume). The liquid reaction composition in the primary reactor (1) comprised approximately 7% by weight of methyl iodide, 12% by weight of methyl acetate, 5% by weight of water, approx. 76% by weight of acetic acid, 1400 ppm of iridium and 2940 ppm ruthenium. The liquid reaction composition was further carbonylated in the second reactor (2) at a mid temperature of 190°C and a total pressure of approximately 27 xlO5 N/m2 with a residence time of 40-60 seconds.<br>
Additional carbon monoxide was fed into the secondary reactor to maintain the concentration of carbon monoxide in the non-volatile components exiting the flash tank at 30 mol%. The results are shown in Table 2. Experiments D to E<br>
The process of Experiment C was repeated except the amount of carbon monoxide fed into the secondary carbonylation reactor was reduced in stages, until in Experiment E, there was no additional carbon monoxide fed into the secondary reactor. The results are shown in Table 2. No bis-phosphonate compound was added to the carbonylation reactor in Experiments D to E. Experiments F to H<br>
The processes of Examples C to E were repeated except the Ru:Ir ratio in the carbonylation reactor was increased to a molar ratio of 6:1. The results are shown in Table 2. No bis-phosphonate compound was added to the carbonylation reactor in Experiments F to H. Examples 4 to 23.<br>
The processes of Experiments C to H were repeated except various amounts of dmpb were added to the first carbonylation reactor. The results are shown in Table 2.<br>
Table 2. <br><br>
* data not available  (Table Removed) <br>
The results from Table 2 demonstrate that where dmpb has been added to the carbonylation reactor, the partial pressure of carbon monoxide in the low pressure off-gas can be decreased whilst maintaining catalyst stability and providing a reduction in the amount of propanoic acid by-product produced.<br>
Figure 2 shows the beneficial effect of the addition of dmpb on catalyst stability at low carbon monoxide partial pressure in the low pressure off-gas from the flash tank At 20% carbon monoxide in the low pressure off-gas, catalyst stability is increased as the molar ratio of dmpb : Ir is increased. Each data point on the graph represents the rate of build-up of precipitate derived over 24 hours of experimentation.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
