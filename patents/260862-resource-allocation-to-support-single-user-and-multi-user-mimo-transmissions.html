{0001 j The present application claims priority to provisional U.S. Application Serial No. 60/784,838, filed March 20, 2006, and Serial No. 60/785,687, filed March 24, 2006, both entitled "Method and System for Resource Grouping to Support the Coexistence of Single-User MIMO and SDMA," assigned to the assignee hereof and incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
BACKGROUND<br><br>
I. Field<br><br>
{0002] The present disclosure relates generally to communication, and more specifically to techniques for transmitting data in a wireless communication system<br><br>
II. Background<br><br>
{0003] Wireless communication systems are widely deployed to provide various communication services such as voice, packet data, broadcast, messaging, etc. These systems may be multiple-access systems capable of supporting communication for multiple users by sharing the available system resources, e.g., bandwidth and transmit power. Examples of such multiple-access systems include Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) systems, Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) systems. Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) systems, and Orthogonal PDMA (OFDMA) systems.<br><br>
{0004] A wireless multiple-access system includes Node Bs (or base stations) that can communicate with user equipments (UEs). Each UE may communicate with one or more Node Bs via transmissions on the downlink and uplink. The downlink (or forward link.) refers to the communication link from the Node Bs to the UEs, and the uplink (or reverse link) refers to the communication link from the UEs to the Node Bs. {0005] A wireless multiple-access system may support multiple-input multiple- output (MIMO) transmission on the downlink and/or uplink. On the downlink, a Node B may send a MIMO transmission from multiple (T) transmit antennas at the Node B to <br><br>
multiple (R.) receive antennas at one or more UEs. A MlMO channel formed by the T transmit and Il receive antennas may be decomposed into C spatial channels, where C 
<br>
Improved performance (e.g , higher throughput and/or greater reliability) may be achieved by exploiting the additional dimensionalities created by the multiple transmit and receive antennas.<br><br>
|0006j There is therefore a need in the art for techniques to efficiently support MIMO transmission in a wireless multiple-access system.<br><br>
SUMMARY<br><br>
|0007| Techniques to support MIMO transmission to a single user as well as to multiple users are described herein The terms "user" and "UE" are used interchangeably herein. In one aspect, users are classified into a plurality of groups comprising a first group and a second group. The first group may include users to be scheduled individually for MLMO transmission. The second group may include users that can be scheduled together for MlMO transmission. Transmission resources are allocated to the first and second groups. The transmission resources may comprise hybrid automatic retransmission (HARC)) interlaces, frequency channels, time frequency resources, etc. The resource allocation may be based upon various criteria such as the number of users in each group, data requirements of the users, total loading for each group, etc. The resource allocation may be semi-static, and transmission resources may be reallocated whenever operating conditions changes The transmission resources allocated to each group are used for data transmission on the downlink and/or uplink for the users in the group In one design. HARQ with blanking is used for data transmission for the users in the first group, and HARQ without blanking is used for data transmission for the users in the second group<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION f0022| The techniques described herein may be used for single-carrier systems as well as multi -carrier systems with multiple subcap?ers The techniques may also be used for data transmission on the downlink as well as the uplink For clarity, much of the description below is for data transmission on the downlink.<br><br>
[0023} FIG. 1 shows, a wireless multiple-access communication system 100 with multiple Node Bs 1 10. A Node B is generally a fixed station that communicates with the UEs and may also be referred to as a base station, an access point, an enhanced Node B (eNode B), etc. Each Node B M O provides coin muni cation coverage for a particular geographic area The term "cell" can refer to a Node B and/or its coverage area depending on the context in which the term is used To improve system capacity, a Node B coverage area may be partitioned into multiple smaller areas, e.g., three smaller areas Each smaller area may be served by a respective base transceiver subsystem (BTS) The term "sector"' can refer to a BTS and/ or its coverage area depending on the context in which the term is used. For a sectorized cell, the BTSs for all sectors of that cell are typically co-located within the Node B for the cell.<br><br>
|0024J UEs 120 may be dispersed throughout the system. A UE may be stationary or mobile and may also be referred to as a mobile station (MS)5 a mobile equipment (ME), a terminal, an access terminal (AT), a station (STA), etc. A UE may be a cellular <br><br>
phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a wireless modem, a wireless communication device, a subscriber unit etc,<br><br>
|0025| A system controller 130 may couple to Node Bs UO and provide coordi nation and control for these Node Bs. System controller 130 may be a single network entity or a collection of network entities,<br><br>
|0026J FIG, 2 shows a block diagram of one Node B 110 and two UEs 12Ox and 12Oy in system 100. Node B 1 10 is equipped with multiple (T &gt; ! ) antennas 234a through 234t UE 120x is equipped with a single (R = I ) antenna 252x. UE J 2Oy is equipped with multiple (R &gt; 1 ) antennas 252a through 252r. Each antenna may be a physical antenna or an antenna array,<br><br>
J0O27J At Node B 1 10, a transmit (TX) data processor 220 receives traffic data from a data source 212 for one or more UEs being served Processor 220 processes (e g., formats, encodes, interleaves, and symbol maps) the traffic data and generates data symbols. Processor 220 also generates and multiplexes pilot symbols with the data symbols, As used herein, a data symbol is a symbol for data, a pilot symbol is a symbol for pilot and a symbol is typically a complex value. 'The data symbols and pilot symbols may be modulation symbols from a modulation scheme such as PSK or QAM. Pilot is data that is known a prion by both the Node B and the IJEs. f0028| A TX MIMO processor 230 performs transmitter spatial processing on the data and pilot symbols. Processor 230 may perform direct MLMO mapping, precoding, beamforming, etc. A data symbol may be sent from one antenna for direct MiMO mapping or from multiple antennas for precoding and beam forming. Processor 230 provides T output symbol streams to T transmitters (TMTRs) 232a through 232t. Each transmitter 232 may perform modulation (e.g., for OFDM. CDMA, etc.) on its output symbols to obtain output chips. Each transmitter 232 further processes (e.g., converts to analog, filters, amplifies, and upconverts) its output chips and generates a downlink signal. T downlink signals from transmitters 232a through 232t are transmitted from T antennas 234a through 234t, respectively.<br><br>
|0029| At each UE S 20, one or multiple antennas 252 receive the downlink signals from Node B I lO. Each antenna 252 provides a received signal to a respective receiver (RCVR) 254. Each receiver 254 processes (e.g., filters, amplifies, downconverts, and digitizes) its received signal to obtain samples. Each receiver 254 may also perform <br><br>
demodulation (e.g., for OFDM, CDMA, etc.) on the samples to obtain received symbols.<br><br>
|0030j At single-antenna UE ! 2Ox, a data detector 26Ox performs data detection (e g., matched filtering or equalization) on the received symbols and provides data symbol estimates. A receive (RX) data processor 27Ox then processes (e.g., symbol demaps, dei uteri eaves, and decodes) the data symbol estimates and provides decoded data to a data sink 272.x. At multi-antenna UE 12Oy, a MlMO detector 26Oy performs MIMO detection on the received symbols and provides data symbol estimates. An RX data processor 27Oy then processes the data symbol estimates and provides decoded data to a data sink 272y<br><br>
|003i j UEs 12Ox and 12Oy may transmit traffic data and/or feedback information on the uplink to Node B l I O The feedback information may also be referred to as channel state information (CSl), link adaptation information, etc. The feedback information may convey various types of information such as, e.g., a preceding matrix selected from a set of precodiiig matrices, one or more columns of the selected precoding matrix, a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) estimate or a rate for each data stream, etc. The Node B may use the feedback information to schedule and transmit data to the UEs. iOO32] At each UE 120, traffic data from a data source 2C)2 and feedback information from a controller/processor 280 are processed by a TX data processor 294, further processed by a TX MlMO processor 296 (if applicable), conditioned by one or more transmitters 254, and transmitted via one or more antennas 252. At Node B S I O, the uplink signals from UBs 12Ox and 12Oy are received by antennas 234a through 234t, processed by receivers 232a through 232?, and further processed by a MLMO detector 236 and an RX data processor 238 to recover the traffic data and feedback information sent by the UEs.<br><br>
[0033] A controller/processor 240 and/or a scheduler 244 may classify UEs into multiple groups and may allocate transmission resources to each group, as described below. Depending on the system design, the transmission resources may be quantified by time, frequency, space, code, transmit power, etc., or any combination thereof. Scheduler 244 also schedules UEs for transmission, e.g., based upon the received feedback information. Controller/processor 240 controls data transmission for (to/from) the scheduled UEs based upon the received feedback information. <br><br>
fOO34| Controllers/processors 240, 28Ox and 280y may also control the operation of various processing units at Node B 1 10 and UKs 120x and 12Oy. respectively. Memories 242, 282x and 282y store data and program codes for Node B I lO and L1Es 12Ox and 12Oy, respectively.<br><br>
|00351 A Node B may support single-input single-output (SISQ), single-input multiple-output (STMO), multiple-input single-output (MTSO), and/or multiple-input multiple-output (MiMO) transmissions. Single-input refers to one transmit antenna and multiple-input refers to multiple transmit antennas for data transmission. Single-output refers to one receive antenna and multiple-output refers to multiple receive antennas for data reception. On the downlink, the multiple transmit antennas are at the Node B, the multiple receive antennas may be at one or more UHs. On the uplink, the multiple transmit antennas may be at one or more UEs, and the multiple receive antennas are at the Node B. The Node B may also support space-time transmit diversity (STTD), space-frequency transmit diversity (SFTD), and/or other transmission schemes. |0036j The Node B may support single-user MlMO (SIi-MIMO) and multi-user MIMO (MU-MfMO). SU-MiMO refers to MiMO transmission to/from a single UF. on a set of transmission resources. MU-MIMO refers to MlMO transmission to/from multiple UEs on the sarøe set of transmission resources. MU-MlMO is also referred to as Spatial Division Multiple Access (SDMA). For each link, the Node B may support SU-MlMO on some transmission resources and may support MU-MIMO on some other transmission resources, as described below.<br><br>
(0037] The UEs may be classified into a SU-MiMO group and a MU-MlMO group. The Node B may serve a single UE in the SU-M?M0 group on a set of transmission resources and may simultaneously serve multiple UEs in the MU-MIMO group on a set of transmission resources. The classification of the UEs may be based upon various criteria such as, e.g., the number of antennas at the Node B, the number of antennas at the UEs, the number of UEs, sector loading at the Node B, data requirements of the UEs, long-term channel statistics, etc. In one specific design, the UEs are classified based upon transmit/receive (Tx/Rx) configuration., e.g., as shown in 'fable 1 . <br><br>
Table 1<br><br><br>
|0038j A T^R configuration means T tiansmit antennas at the Node B and R scceive antennas at a I E The six configurations in Table 1 may be supported as follows<br><br>
• 2? 1 configuration - two UEs are supported, with one data stream per UE,<br><br>
• 2 »2 configuration - one UF. is supported, with two data streams for this UF.,<br><br>
• 2x4 configuration - one I T, is supported with two data streams for this VE,<br><br>
• 4 - 1 configuration ~ foui IT-s are supported, with one data stream per VE,<br><br>
• 4x2 configuration - two UFs are supported, with two data streams per LF, and<br><br>
• 4*4 configuration ~ one UF is supported, with four data streams for this UF.<br><br>
|0039| The UEs may also be classified based upon other schemes The classification may be semi-static and røa\ be updated, e g , based upon UH population. UF preference, I F, requirements, channel conditions sector loading, etc |004OJ The Node B may send a MIMO transmission to one or more UHs using direct MiMO mapping, preo?ding, bearnf?rming, etc With direct MIMO mapping, each data stream is mapped to a different tpmsroh antenna With preceding, the data streams are multiplied with a preceding matrix and sent on virtual antennas formed with the precoding matrix The precoding matrix may be a Hadamard matrix, a i-'ourier matrix, or some other matrix Each data stream is sent from all I transmit antennas with precoding Precoding allows the total transmit power for each transmit antenna to be used for data transmission regardless of the number of data streams being sent Precoding may also include spatial spreading, space-time scrambling, etc With beam forming, the data streams are multiplied with a beam forming matrix and steered toward specific receive antennas, c g . at one or more UFs<br><br>
[004 ? j For both SU-MIMO and MU-MLMO. a Ui-: may recover its data streams using various VHMO detection techniques such as linear minimum mean square error (MMSF). zero-forcing (/K). successive interference cancellation (SIC), etc , which are known in the ait For SlC, the VE recovers one data stream at a time, estimates the <br><br>
interference due to each recovered data stream, and cancels the interference prior to recovering the next stream, SiC may improve the SNRs of data streams that are recovered later. For SlJ-MiMO, a UE may be able to perform SlC for all data streams sent in the MiMO transmission to that UE For MU-MlMO, a UE may be able to perform SIC for only the data streams sent to that UE. The MIJ-MlMO UE is typically unable- to recover the data streams sent to other UEs and would not be able to estimate and cancel the interference due to these data streams The MlJ-MIMO UE may thus perform {a} MMSE detection to recover its data streams or (b) MMSE detection with SIC (or MMSE-SIC) to suppress the interference from the data streams for that UE and MMSE detection to suppress the interference from the data streams for the other UHs fßO42} The system may support HARQ, which may take the method of chase combining, incremental redundancy, etc. With HARQ, a transmitter sends a transmission for a packet and may send one or more retransmissions until the packet is decoded correctly by a receiver, or the maximum number of retransmissions has been sent, or some other termination condition is encountered. HARQ may improve reliability of data transmission. fø043| FIG. 3 shows an example HA.RQ transmission on the downlink. The Node B processes packet A and transmits the packet in transmission time interval (TTI) Ti A TTl may be of any duration and is typically dependent on the system design. For example, a TTI may be 1 millisecond (ms), 2ms, 5 nis, IO ms, or some other time duration A UE receives the transmission, decodes packet A in error, and sends a negative acknowledgement (NAK) in TTl Ty The Node B receives the NAK and retransmits packet A in TTI T^ The UE receives the retransmission, decodes packet A based upon the original transmission and the retransmission, and sends a NAK in TTi T4 when the packet is decoded in error. The Node B receives the NAK and retransmits packet A again in TTI Tj. The UE receives the second retransmission, decodes packet A based upon the original transmission and the two retransmissions, and sends an acknowledgement (ACK) in TTi T(l when the packet is decoded correctly. The Node B then processes and transmits the next packet B in similar manner as packet A. |0044| An HARQ process refers to all transmission and retransmissions, if any, for a packet. An HARQ process may be started whenever transmission resources are available and may terminate after the first transmission or after one or more subsequent retransmissions. In FIG. 3, the HAIlQ process for packet A starts in TTI Tj and <br><br>
terminates in TTI T&gt;. The HARQ process for packet B starts in TTI T? after termination of the HARQ process for packet A An HARQ process may have a variable duration that depends on the decoding result at the receiver Packets may be sent such that their HA RQ processes terminate after a target number of retransmissions and with a target packet error rate (PER).<br><br>
|0045| On the downlink, the Node B may send S data streams simultaneously in a MiMO transmission to one or more UEs. S may be given as 1 
<br>
SU-MiMO and ! 
<br>
|0046| FlG. 4A shows an example HARQ transmission for multiple (S &gt; 1 ) data streams with blanking, which is also referred to as blanking strategy HARQ with blanking refers to a scheme that starts HARQ processes at the same time and waits until all of the HARQ processes terminate before starting new HARQ processes. |0047| In the example shown in FlG. 4 A, S HARQ processes are started in TH Ti for S packets IA through SA for the S data streams. The first transmissions for these S packets are sent in TTI Tt Packet I A is decoded in error, packet 2 A is decoded correctly, and so on, and packet SA is decoded in error. Data stream 2 is then blanked, and no transmissions are sent for data stream 2 until the HARQ processes for all other data streams are terminated. The first retransmissions for packets i A, SA, and possibly other packets are sent in TT? ?\. Packet IA is still decoded in error, and so on, and packet SA is decoded correctly. Data stream S is then blanked until ail remaining HARQ processes terminate. The second retransmissions for packets I A and possibly other packets are sent in TTI Tj. In this example, packet IA and ail pending packets are decoded correctly after the second retransmission, and their HARQ processes terminate in TTI Tj. S new HARQ processes are then started in TTI T? for S new packets I B through SB. The first transmissions for these S new packets are sent in TTI T-. <br><br>
|0048] FlG, 4B shows an example HARQ transmission for multiple ( S &gt; i ) data streams without blanking, which is also referred to as non-blanking strategy HARQ without blanking refers to a scheme that starts a new HARQ process immediately whenever a pending HARQ process terminates<br><br>
|0049J In the example shown in FIG 4B, S 114RQ processes are started in TTI Tt for S packets 1 ? through S?, and the first transmissions for these S packets are sent in TT! Tj Packet IA is decoded in error, packet 2 A is decoded correctly, and so on, and packet S? is decoded in error ? new HARQ process is started for packet 2B on data stream 2 The first retransmissions, for packets IA, SA, and possibly other packets as well as the first transmission for packet 2B are sent in TTI T? Packet IA is soil decoded in error, packet 2B is decoded correctly, and so on, and packet SA is also decoded correct!) A nev, HARQ process is started for packet 2C on data stream 2, and another new HARQ process is started for packet SB on data stream S The second retransmissions for packets I A and possibly other packets as well as the first transmissions for packets ZC and SB are sent in 111 Y*, Packet IA is decoded correctly, packet 2C is decoded in error, and so on. and packet SB is also decoded in error ? new HARQ process is started for packet IB on data stream 1 The transmission for packet i B as well as the first retransmissions for packets 2C, SB, and possibly other packets are sent in ITI T-?<br><br>
|0050| As shown in FKiS e lower throughput in comparison to HARQ without blanking This is because UARQ with blanking does not utilize all of the transmission resources when the HARQ processes for the S data streams HARQ with blanking ma\ have some adv antages such as simple user scheduling, simple HARQ management, more flexible rank selection, etc flank selection refers to the selection of a specific number of data streams to send based upon channel conditions If the throughput loss due to blanking is small, then it may be desirable to use HARQ with blanking for MIMO transmission in any case, it may be unavoidable to take the HARQ with blanking in the SU-MlVIO transmission when a K ode B scheduler desires to change one Ul-, assigned to a gi\en resource to another UI\ keeping a single UF transmission |005J| The Node B may dynamically schedule the UFs in the SL -MlMO and MU- MIMO groups based upon various factors such as sector capacity (which may favor MlI-MIMO), high peak throughput (which may favor SlI-MIMO), data requirements, <br><br>
quality of service (QoS) requirements, sector loading, proportional fairness criterion, etc. For example, the Node B may schedule multiple UKs for MU-MIMO transmission, then a single UE for SlJ-MlMO transmission, then multiple UEs for MlJ-MIMO transmission, etc.<br><br>
|00521 The dynamic scheduling of SU-MlMO UEs and MU-MIMO UEs may result in waste of transmission resources when HARQ is used for transmission. For a MU- MIMO transmission to multiple UEs, the HARQ processes for these UEs may terminate at different times. For a SU-MlMO transmission to a single UE, the HARQ processes for this UE may terminate eiose together or at different times depending on the MIMO detection technique employed by the UE, Discrepancy in the termination times of the HARQ processes may result in waste of transmission resources when switching between SU-MIMO and MU-MIMO For example, when switching from MU-MIMO to SU-MlMO, the Node B should wait until the HARQ processes for all KII)-MIMO UEs being served have terminated. The Node B may blank the transmission resources for each HARQ process that terminates early. Depending on the target number of retransmissions and the target PER, this waste of transmission resources may result in significant loss of throughput.<br><br>
{0053] In an aspect, the transmission resources available for data transmission are allocated to the SU-MIMO and MU-MlMO groups The resource allocation may be achieved in various manners depending on how the transmission resources are defined, e.g., with time, or with time and frequency. The resource allocation may also be based upon various criteria such as the number of UEs in each group, the data and QoS requirements of the UEs, etc. Several schemes for allocating transmission resources are described below. The UEs in each group are served using the transmission resources allocated to that group.<br><br>
|0054J FlG. 5 shows an HARQ interlace structure 500 that may be used for HARQ transmission. The transmission timeline may be partitioned into units of TTIs, which may be sequentially numbered. Each TTl may span any time duration, which may be fixed or configurable. fø?55| M HARQ interlaces may be defined, where M may be any value. For example, M may be equal to four, six, or some other value. Each HARQ interlace covers TTIs that are spaced apart by M TTIs (not counting time allocated for overhead). The M HARQ interlaces cover TTIs that are staggered from one another For example. <br><br>
HARQ interlace ! may cover TTIs 1, M-H, etc., HARQ interlace 2 may cover TTIs 2, M-K2. etc., and so on, and HARQ interlace M may cover TTIs M. 2M, etc. |0056j Each HARQ process may be sent on just one HARQ interlace and not across HARQ interlaces. A set of one or more HARQ processes may be active on each HARQ interlace in a given TFL depending on the number of packets being sent simultaneously with MlMO. M different sets of HARQ processes may be sent on the M HARQ interlaces. The M sets may include the same or different numbers of HARQ processes. |0057J The M HARQ interlaces may be considered as transmission resources that may be allocated to the SU-MIMO and MU-MlMO groups. In general, each group may be allocated any number of HARQ interlaces and any one of the M HARQ interlaces. Had) HARQ interlace may be allocated to either the SU-MlMO or MU-MIMO group. fßø58J FIG. 6 shows an example allocation of HARQ interlaces to the SU-MIMO and MlJ-MIMO groups ?n this example, L HARQ interlaces 1 through L are allocated to the SU-MIMO group, and the remaining M -L HARQ interlaces L + I through M are allocated to the MU-MlMO groups<br><br>
|0059| The UEs in the SU-MIMO group may be served using HARQ interlaces 1 through L. For example, HARQ interlace 1 may be used for one SU-MIMO UE, HARQ interlace 2 may be used for another SU-MiMO UE, and so on, and HARQ interlace L may be used for yet another SU-MlMO UE. More than one HARQ interlace may also be used for a given SU-MtMO UE. Up to L SU-MtMO UEs may be served with the L HARQ interlaces allocated to the SU-MlMO group. For a given HARQ interlace K where ( &amp; (i .. !,} , one or more HARQ processes may be active for the SU-<br><br>
MSMO UE assigned with HARQ interlace 
<br>
|0060| The UEs in the MU-MIMO group may be served using HARQ interlaces L ÷ i through M. For example, HARQ interlace L ÷ i may be used for one set of MU- MIMO UEs, HARQ interlace L -*- 2 may be used For another set of MU-MIMO UEs, and so on. and HARQ interlace M mas' be used for yet another set of MU-MlMO UEs. More than one HARQ interlace may also be used for a given MlJ-M SMO UE. Up to M - L sets of MU-MlMO UEs may be served with the M - L HARQ interlaces <br><br>
allocated to the MtI-MlMO group. For a given HARQ interlace /, where ( e (L •!• 1 . . M) . up to T HARQ processes may be active for the set of UEs assigned with HARQ interlace ( . HARQ without blanking may be used for MlJ-MIMO. Whenever an HARQ process terminates on HARQ interlace l\ another HARQ process may be started immediately for either (a) a HE currently assigned this HARQ interlace or (b) a new UE just assigned this H ARQ interlace Hence, transmission resources may be efficiently utilized for MU-MIMO. fßOfil j The allocation of HARQ interlaces to the two groups and the use of the HARQ interlaces allocated to each group to serve the UKs in that group may improve resource utilization By using each HARQ interlace for only one group, loss in throughput due Io blanking when switching from MM-MlMO to SIi-MlMO, and vice versa, can be avoided. Hie HARQ interlaces allocated to the MU-MlMQ group may be efficiently utilized without blanking, HARQ processes for MU-MIMO may be synchronized only as needed for specific purposes, e.g., for resource reallocation, for scheduling, for switching between MlI-MiMO UEs with different numbers of data streams, etc. Blanking may be used in MU-MIMO, e g., if a scheduler cannot find any I5E that can transmit data using the released resource without causing unacceptable interference The HARQ interlaces allocated to the SU-MlMO group may also be efficiently utilized Loss in throughput due to switching from one SU-MIMO UE to another SU-MlMO UE may be reduced by (a) persistently serving a SU-MiMO UE as long as possible to reduce the number/frequency of switches and (b) using techniques (e g., SIC) that result in close termination times for the HARQ processes. |00621 The system may utilize Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), Single-Carrier Frequency Division Multiplexing (SC-I7DM), or some other multi-carrier modulation techniques OFDM and SC-FDM partition the system bandwidth into multiple (K ) orthogonal subcarriers, which, are also called tones, bins, and so on. K may be any integer value. Each subcarrier may be modulated with data In general, modulation symbols are sent in the frequency domain with OFDM and in the time domain with SC-FDM With multiple subcarriers, the transmission resources may be quantified by both time and frequency.<br><br>
[0063} FlG. 7 A shows a subcarrier structure 700 that may be used for data transmission. The K total subcarriers are assigned indices of 1 through K For <br><br>
simplicity, the following description assumes that all K total subcarriers are usable for transmission. For subcarrier structure 700, the K total suhcarriers are arranged into Q sub band s. where Q may be any value Each subband includes P consecutive subcarriers, where K - P - Q . Thus, subband I includes subcarriers ! through P, subband 2 includes subcarriers P ÷ l through 2P. and so on, and subband 0 includes subcarriers K ••• P -¦• 1 through K<br><br>
J0O64J FIG. 7B shows a subcarrier structure 710 that may also be used for data transmission. For subcarrier structure 710, the K total subcarriers are arranged into Q sets Each set includes P subcarriers that are uniformly distributed across the K total subcarriers, and consecutive subcarriers in each set are spaced apart by Q subcarriers. Set q, for q e { 1 ... Q) , includes subcarriers c/, Q -¦• q , 2Q -¦• q , etc fOO65| Q frequency channels may be formed with the Q subbands in FIG. 7A, the Q subcarrier sets in FICT. 7B, or some other grouping of subcarriers. Each frequency channel may correspond to one subband, one subcarrier set, or one subcarrier group |0066| FlG. 8 shows an example of resource allocation across frequency In this example, the Q frequency channels are allocated to the SU-MlMO and MU-MIMO groups, with each frequency channel being allocated to one group. In the example shown in FIG S, frequency channels J, 3, etc. are allocated to the SU-MIMO group, and frequency channels 2, 4. etc.. and Q are allocated to the MU-MIMO group In general, each group may be allocated any number of frequency channels and any one of the Q frequency channels.<br><br>
|0067j In one design, M MARQ interlaces are defined for each frequency channel. The M HARQ interlaces for each frequency channel may be used for the UEs in the group allocated that frequency channel. In this design, the number of HARQ interlaces available for each group is dependent on the number of frequency channels allocated to the group.<br><br>
|0068| In another design, M HARQ interlaces are defined for all frequency channels allocated to each group Each group has M H ARQ interlaces, with the capacity of each HARQ interlace being dependent on the number of frequency channels allocated to the group. The M HARQ interlaces for each group may be used for the UEs in the group. [0069 j In general, any number of HARQ interlaces may be defined for each group based upon the frequency channels allocated to that group. Each HARQ interlace may <br><br>
cover one or more frequency channels. The UEs in each group may be served using the HARQ interlaces available for that group,<br><br>
|0070| Resource allocation may also be performed across time and frequency. In one design, M HARQ interlaces are defined for each frequency channel, and a total of M - Q HARQ interlaces are available. Each of the M - Q HARQ interfaces may be allocated to the SU-MIMO or MU-MlMO group. This design provides fine granularity and flexibility in allocating transmission resources to the groups. In another design, multiple sets of frequency channels are formed, M HARQ interlaces are defined for each set of frequency channels, and each HARQ interlace may be allocated to the SU- MIMO or MU-M iMO group The sets may include the same number of frequency channels, in which case the HARQ interlaces have equal capacity Alternatively, the sets may include different numbers of frequency channels, in v»hich case the HARQ interlaces have different capacities<br><br>
|007i| The available transmission resources may be allocated to the SU-MIMO and MlJ-MiMO groups based upon various criteria. The resource allocation may be based upon the number of L1Es in each group. More transmission resources may be allocated to the SlJ-MIMO (or MU-MlMO) group when more SU-MIMO (or MLi-M IMO) UKs are present The resource allocation may also be based upon the data requirements of the UEs. For example, the total loading 
<br>
|Q073j The scheduler for the Node B may schedule UEs for transmission based upon the data and QoS requirements of the UEs and their feedback information. Each UE may be informed of the transmission resources (e.g , HARQ interlace) used for that UE at the time of scheduling, at the start of a call, and/or at other time. For example, in <br><br>
each scheduling interval, signaling may be sent to convey which UEs are scheduled for transmission and the HARQ interiace(s) used for each scheduled UE. |0074i A SU-MfMO UE may perform MMSE detection with SIC (or MMSE-SlC) to recover the MlMO transmission sent to the UE. For MMSE-SIC, the UE initially performs MMSE detection on the received symbols from the R receive antennas at the UE to obtain data symbol estimates for one packet sent in one HARQ process. The UE then processes (e.g., demodulates, deinteri eaves, and decodes) the data symbol estimates to obtain a decoded packet. If the packet is decoded correctly, then the UE estimates the interference caused by this packet and subtracts the estimated interference from the received symbols. The UE then performs MMSH detection on the interference-canceled symbols to obtain data symbol estimates for another packet sent in another HARQ process. The UE then processes the new data symbol estimates to obtain another decoded packet. f0075| The Node B may concurrently send S packets on S data streams to the SU- MIMO IiE. The UE may perform MMSE detection, decoding, and interference cancellation for each packet sent to the UE. When SlC is employed, the data streams are also referred to as layers The first data stream to be recovered is referred to as the lowest layer stream, and the last data stream to be recovered is referred to as the highest layer stream.<br><br>
[0076J When a SU-MIMO UE uses MMSE-SlC, all of the HARQ processes for the UE are likely to terminate at the same time. The rates for the data streams may be sequentially selected such that higher layer streams can be decoded correctly only when lower layer streams are decoded correctly and canceled. A control loop may be used to achieve similar PER for all data streams, ?n this case, the higher layer streams may be decoded correctly as soon as the lower layer streams are decoded correctly and canceled As a result, all of the HARQ processes terminate in the same TTl in most cases. Furthermore, the rate or backoff margin for each data stream may be selected such that the HARQ processes for all data streams terminate at the same time with high probability. Blanking may be used to synchronize the HARQ processes whenever all data streams are not decoded correctly at the same time, which may be infrequent. Close termination of the HARQ processes may also be obtained when other MIMO detection techniques (e.g., zero-forcing) are used in combination with SlC. <br><br>
fOO77| A SU-MIMO UE may also perform MMSE detection without SIC. In this case, the rates of the data streams may be selected independently based upon the SNRs of these streams. The HARQ processes for these data streams may terminate at different times. j?078| Computer simulations were performed to determine the throughput of SU- MIMO UEs for four cases corresponding to different combinations of (a) MMSE or MMSE-SIC and (b) HARQ with blanking or HARQ without blanking. The simulations indicate that MMSE-SIC with blanking and MMSE-SIC without blanking have the best performance and are similar in performance. MMSJr, without blanking has the next best- performance, and MMSH with blanking has the worst performance. |0079j To reduce loss in throughput due to blanking, the UEs may be classified into groups based upon the likelihood of their HARQ processes terminating at the same time or close together UEs employing SIC and/or other techniques that can result in close termination of their HARQ processes may be placed in the SU-MiMO group. UEs with HARQ processes terminating at different limes may be placed in the MU-MIMO group. 10080} HARQ with blanking may be used for the SU-MIMO group. A M IMO transmission is sent to one UE at a time from the SU-MIMO group. A new MIMO transmission may be sent to another UE when all of the HAIlQ processes for the current UE have terminated.<br><br>
[0081 j HARQ without blanking may be used for the MU-MiMO group. A MIMO transmission may be sent to one or multiple UEs at a time from the MU-MiMO group. A new HARQ process may be started as soon as a pending HARQ) process terminates. A MLMO transmission may be sent to a single UE in the MU-MIMO group. The HARQ processes for this single UE may start at different tiroes depending on when the prior HAR.Q processes terminate. Furthermore, new HARQ processes may be started whenever the HARQ processes for this single UE terminate The HARQ processes for this single UK may thus overlap the HARQ processes for other UKs at the start and/or tail of the MlMO transmission to this single UE. This single UE may be considered as a MU-MlMO UE because of the overlap at the start and/or tail of the transmission to this UE.<br><br>
JO082J FIG. 9 shows a process 900 for allocating transmission resources to users/ UEs. Process 900 may be performed by a Node B, a scheduler, and/or some other network entity. Users are classified into a plurality of groups comprising a first group <br><br>
and a second group (block 912). The first group may include users to be scheduled individual Iy for MlMO transmission, or SU-MlMO users. The second group may include users that can be scheduled together for MlMO transmission, or MlJ-MIMO users The classification may he semi-static and may he based upon various criteria, as described above.<br><br>
|00S3| Transmission resources are allocated to the first and second groups (block 914). The transmission resources may comprise HARQ interlaces, and each group may be allocated at least one HARQ interlace. The transmission resources may comprise frequency channels, and each group may be allocated at least one frequency channel. The transmission resources may also comprise time frequency resources. The resource allocation may he based upon the number of users in each group, data requirements of the users in each group, total loading of the users, interference associated with the users, etc., or any combination thereof. The resource allocation may be semi-static. Information on the transmission resources allocated to each group may be conveyed to each UE in that group by higher layer signaling, a broadcast channel, etc This information may be used by each UE to facilitate feedback of CQI, preceding matrices and vectors, preferred subband information, etc. from the UE. The transmission resources may be reallocated, e.g., if the number of users in the first and/or second group exceeds a threshold.<br><br>
[0084 j The transmission resources allocated to each group are used for data transmission for the users in the group (block 916), The transmission resources may be used for downlink and/or uplink transmission. For the downlink, MIMO transmission may be sent to one user in the first group at a time using the transmission resources allocated to the first group. MlMO transmission may be sent to multiple users in the second group at a time using the transmission resources allocated to the second group. HARQ with blanking may be used for data transmission for the SU-MIMO users in the first group (block 918). HARQ without blanking may be used for data transmission for the MU-MIIVIO users in the second group (block 920).<br><br>

The assigned transmission resources are selected from the transmission resources allocated to the group to which the UB belongs The assigned transmission resources may comprise at least one HARQ interlace, at least one frequency channel, etc. The assigned transmission resources are used for data transmission on the downlink and/or uplink (block 1 116). The HARQ with blanking may be used for data transmission if the UE is in the first group (block 1 1 18) and HARQ without blanking may be used for data transmission if the UE is in the second group (block 1 ! 20).<br><br>
