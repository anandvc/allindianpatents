Continuous silazane cleavage method<br>
Description<br>
The present invention relates to a continuous silazane cleavage method, in<br>
particular for the production of molecular precursors for non-oxide inorganic<br>
ceramics.<br>
Silazane cleavage reactions which are carried out batchwise have already<br>
been described in the prior art (Metallo-organicheskaya Khimiya (1989), 2(3),<br>
701-2, Kalikhman, I.D. et al.; Journal of Organometallic Chemistry (1989),<br>
361(2), 147-55, Kalikhman, I.D. et al.; Zhurnal Obshchei Khimii (1981),<br>
51(8), 1824-9, Sheludyakov, V.D. et al.).<br>
Ceramics prepared from the anionic components C and N together with 2 to<br>
4 further elements such as B, Al, Ga, In, Si, Ge, P, Ti, Zr, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo,<br>
W, Fe or Zn having a cationic function are of particular interest. Such<br>
ceramics, for example consisting of Si, B, N and C, are distinguished by<br>
excellent thermal, mechanical and chemical resistance and, in terms of their<br>
combination of all applicational properties, are distinctly superior to<br>
competing materials, for example for use in heat engines. A prerequisite for<br>
achieving these advantageous properties is the creation of a network with a<br>
regular alternation of elements with an anionic and cationic function, the<br>
latter homogeneously distributed over zones of above 1 to 2 nm.<br>
Such prerequisites may be achieved by the synthesis and provision of<br>
molecular single component precursors, which contain the particular desired<br>
combination of cationic components linked to one another via nitrogen.<br>
These molecular precursors are then polymerised and finally ceramised by<br>
pyrolysis. Since the polymeric intermediate stages may be processed using<br>
any polymer processing method, an unusually wide range of forms of use is<br>
accessible, such as for example fibres, films, infiltrates, coatings and<br>
mouldings. The potential of this new family of materials for the production of<br><br>
fibre-reinforced ceramic composites is of particular significance. Unequalled<br>
properties at elevated temperatures in air and with simultaneous mechanical<br>
loading are the guarantee of potential applications. Penetration into areas<br>
occupied by metallic and conventional ceramic materials is desirable due to<br>
the numerous technical advantages, but only possible if an inexpensive<br>
production process is available.<br>
The review article "Amorphous Multinary Ceramics in the Si-B-N-C System"<br>
(M. Jansen et al., Struct. Bond. 2002, 101, 137) and DE41 07 108A1, DE<br>
100 45 427 A1, DE 100 45 428 A1 and 101 04 536 A1 describe syntheses<br>
for the Si/B/N/C subsystem for the variants of the molecular scaffold for a<br>
single component precursor of the formula (1) RxHal3-xSiNR1-BRyHal2-y<br>
wherein R in each case independently represents a hydrocarbon residue<br>
with 1 to 20 C atoms, Hal in each case independently means CI, Br or I, R1 in<br>
each case independently represents a hydrocarbon residue with 1 to 20 C<br>
atoms or hydrogen, x = 0, 1 or 2 and y = 0 or 1.<br>
A feature which is common to the above-described methods is that the<br>
particular target molecule is synthesised in batch mode starting from Me3Si-<br>
NR1SiMe3 by two successive silazane cleavage reactions, firstly with<br>
SiHal4-xRx, then with BHal3.yRy.<br><br><br>
These are laboratory syntheses which cannot straightforwardly be carried out<br>
as environmentally and economically optimised production methods on an<br>
industrial scale.<br>
The following may in particular be problematic:<br>
1.	Reaction times for the first silazane cleavage are between 20 and 48<br>
hours, for the second approx. 12 hours per batch. Satisfactory space-time<br>
yields thus cannot be achieved via this route.<br>
2.	If reaction temperatures are increased, selectivity declines and undesired<br>
secondary products such as RxHal3-xSi-NR1-SiHal3-xRx or Me3Si-NR1-<br>
SiHal2-xRx-NR1-SiMe3 may be formed.<br>
3.	Large excesses of costly feed materials have hitherto been necessary, the<br>
costs of which impair the economic viability of the method.<br>
4.	Synthesis by the "batch" method is comparatively uneconomic, since each<br>
reaction batch is preceded by a time-consuming and costly provision of an<br>
inert atmosphere in the reaction apparatus.<br>
5.	High costs are generated by the necessary cooling during synthesis and<br>
by the isolation and purification of the product by distillation processes.<br>
DE100 45 428A1 describes an alternative preparative route to yield the<br>
above defined single component precursors, according to which an amine<br>
component R1NH2 is reacted in succession with a silane component<br>
SiHal4-xRx and a borane component BHal3-yRy:<br><br><br>
In this sequence of two successive aminolysis reactions, the formation of<br>
difficult to separate saline hydrochlorides, which inevitably occurs in both<br>
steps, is disadvantageous and additionally considerably diminishes product<br>
yield relative to the introduced material. Nonetheless, this approach has<br>
made it possible to achieve a continuous production method, in which the<br>
reactor is cycled between a production phase and a regeneration phase<br>
(stripping of hydrochlorides) (DE 102 28 990 A1).<br>
While the described method already yields good results, it still exhibits<br>
disadvantages from a technical and economic standpoint:<br>
1.	The space-time yield is reduced by the intermittent mode of operation.<br>
The only remedy is to install a parallel reactor (so increasing capital<br>
investment).<br>
2.	Half of the amine starting component and half of the silylamine<br>
intermediate stage are bound as hydrochlorides and discharged during<br>
the regeneration cycle. This considerably reduces the yield of final product<br>
relative to the valuable feed materials.<br>
3.	The target products require elaborate isolation and purification.<br>
4.	Residues of intermediate and final product are pyrolysed during thermal<br>
stripping and accordingly result in reactor fouling over long-term operation.<br>
Many compounds of interest and in particular molecular single component<br>
precursors for non-oxide ceramics may be produced by silazane cleavage.<br>
Hitherto known batch methods, however, exhibit the disadvantages<br>
discussed above. It was accordingly an object of the present invention to<br>
provide a method for cleaving silazane compounds which at least partially<br>
overcomes the disadvantages of the prior art.<br>
A further object of the present invention was to provide an efficient, generally<br>
applicable method for the production of single component precursors for<br>
non-oxide ceramics which should in particular satisfy the following<br>
requirements:<br>
-	it should be possible to carry out the method continuously, without separate<br>
isolation or storage of the intermediate stage.<br>
-	product yield should be optimal, such that the feed materials are converted<br>
as completely as possible into the product.<br><br>
The invention relates to a method for cleaving silazane compounds, which is<br>
characterised in that it is carried out continuously. It has surprisingly been<br>
found that silazane cleavage may be carried out continuously, so making it<br>
possible to overcome the above-stated disadvantages with regard to a poor<br>
space-time yield.<br>
Silazanes are silicon-nitrogen compounds which comprise an Si-N bond.<br>
Element-N compounds can be synthesised by silazane cleavage.<br>
It has furthermore been found according to the invention that a continuous<br>
mode of operation of the method is in particular advantageous and possible<br>
if at least one of the educts introduced for silazane cleavage is used in<br>
gaseous form. The silazane or the cleaving reagent or both may here be<br>
introduced in gaseous form. In a preferred embodiment, all the educts are<br>
introduced in gaseous form and the reaction proceeds in the gas phase. In a<br>
further preferred embodiment, at least one educt is introduced in gaseous<br>
form and at least one other educt is introduced in liquid form. When this<br>
approach is used, the method is advantageously performed countercurrently,<br>
whereby it is possible to achieve conversion which is virtually quantitative or<br>
even quantitative. When the reaction is carried out in this manner, at least<br>
one reaction stage advantageously takes the form of a gas-liquid reactor, for<br>
example a bubble column, spray column, packed column, falling-film reactor<br>
or reactor with external recirculation.<br>
A further improvement of the continuous method according to the invention<br>
may be achieved by removing the target product and/or undesired secondary<br>
products from the reaction mixture and thus from the equilibrium. The target<br>
product may be isolated from the remaining components of the reaction<br>
mixture for example by crystallisation, condensation and/or using a solvent.<br>
Secondary products, in particular highly volatile secondary products, are<br>
preferably removed from the reaction mixture by partial condensation,<br>
distillation, pervaporation, gas permeation or adsorption. Phase separation<br>
between the condensate phase and gas phase preferably proceeds in an<br>
inertial separator or in a cyclone. Using the continuous mode of operation of<br>
the method according to the invention, it is in particular possible to achieve<br>
elevated selectivity with regard to the desired target products. Selectivity may<br>
further be ensured by carrying out the reaction with one of the educts in<br><br>
in which x = 0 or 1, y = 0, 1 or 2 and z = 0, 1, 2 or 3, Hal is selected from F,<br>
CI, Br and I, and R represents hydrogen or a hydrocarbon residue with 120 C<br>
atoms,<br>
and a compound of the formula (4) selected from<br>
BHal3-xRx, AIHal3-xRx, GaHal3-xRx, lnHal3-xRx, SiHal4-yRy, GeHal4-yRy,<br>
PHal3-xRx, PHal5-zRz, TiHal4-yRy, ZrHal4-yRy, VHal3.xRx, VHal4-yRy, NbHal5-zRz,<br>
TaHal5-zRz, CrHal3-xRx, MoHal4-yRy, MoHal5-zRz, WHal6-zRz, FeHal3-xRx or<br>
ZnCI2<br>
in which x = 0 or 1, y = 0, 1 or 2, z = 0, 1, 2 or 3, Hal is selected from F, CI,<br>
Br and I, and R represents hydrogen or a hydrocarbon residue with 1-20 C<br>
atoms. In this embodiment, two silazane cleavage reactions are carried out.<br>
In these two reactions, the compounds of the formulae (3) and (4) are<br>
preferably present in gaseous form.<br>
It has surprisingly been found the method for the production of molecular<br>
single component precursors for non-oxide ceramics may be carried out<br>
continuously. The reaction of the silazane compound with a compound of the<br>
formula (2) preferably proceeds in the gas phase. Alternatively, one of the<br>
two reactants may be introduced in the form of a liquid. In this case, the<br>
compound of the formula (3) is preferably present in the liquid phase and the<br>
compound of the formula (2) in the gaseous phase. The product of silazane<br>
cleavage is obtained in liquid form, whereby the desired products may be<br>
produced inexpensively and on a large scale. The method according to the<br>
invention for the production of compounds with the structural feature X-N-Y,<br>
in particular of compounds with the formula (1) RxHal3-xSi-NR1BRyHal2-y<br>
proceeds via a two-fold silazane cleavage from R23SiNR1SiR33 (3).<br>
In formula (3), R2 and R3 may preferably in each case independently mean<br>
an alkyl and/or aryl residue with 1-7 C atoms, preferably a methyl residue.<br>
The silazane cleavage according to the invention and in particular the<br>
reaction of a compound of the formula (3) with a compound of the formula<br>
(2) preferably proceeds at temperatures of-100°C to 300°C, more preferably<br>
at temperatures of &gt; 25°C and 
of ≥ 50°C and 
65°C. Furthermore, a suitable pressure is established to ensure that the<br>
compound of the formula (3), is liquid or gaseous as required, and the<br><br>
compounds of the formulae (2) and (4) are gaseous, wherein pressures of<br>
0.1 mbar to 2 bar, in particular of 1 mbar to 1 bar are conventionally used.<br>
Under these conditions, the intermediate of the first silazane cleavage or the<br>
final product obtained by the second silazane cleavage are in each case<br>
obtained in liquid form.<br>
In order to achieve a maximally quantitative conversion into the desired<br>
products, the silazane compound, in particular a compound of the formula<br>
(3), is preferably reacted with an excess of compounds of the formula (2)<br>
and/or a excess of compounds of the formula (4). Compounds of the formula<br>
(2) and/or compounds of the formula (4) are preferably introduced in an<br>
amount of at least 1.1 times, more preferably at least 1.2 times, still more<br>
preferably at least 1.5 times, and most preferably at least 2 times greater<br>
than the silazane compound.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the method according to the invention,<br>
pressure and temperature are adjusted such that the educts (2) and (4) are<br>
in gaseous form, but the educt (3), intermediate and final product are in liquid<br>
form. In this mode of operation of the method, the intermediate or final<br>
product may straightforwardly be separated from the method in condensed<br>
form. Separation may, for example, proceed by crystallisation, condensation<br>
and/or the use of a solvent. The product is preferably separated and<br>
recovered from the equilibrium by condensation.<br>
The mode of operation of the method furthermore preferably proceeds in<br>
such a manner that secondary products, to the extent that any are formed,<br>
are removed from the reaction mixture. One secondary product often formed<br>
during the reaction is R3SiHal, for example Me3SiHal. Pressure and<br>
temperature are therefore suitably adjusted such that the partial pressure of<br>
a secondary product R3SiHal formed during the reaction is lower than the<br>
saturation vapour pressure thereof, such that the secondary product is thus<br>
in gaseous form. Such gaseous secondary products may be separated in<br>
straightforward manner, for example by partial condensation, distillation,<br>
pervaporation, gas permeation or adsorption.<br>
Isolation of the reaction product or separation of secondary products may<br>
advantageously proceed by means of phase separation between the<br><br>
condensate phase and gas phase, for example in an inertial separator or in a<br>
cyclone.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the method according to the invention is carried<br>
out as a reactive distillation.<br>
It is furthermore preferred to convert one educt quantitatively in the liquid<br>
phase countercurrently with a second educt in the gaseous phase.<br>
Preferably, one or both reaction stages are carried out as gas-liquid<br>
reactions, wherein suitable reactors may be for example bubble columns,<br>
spray columns, packed columns, falling-film reactors or reactors with external<br>
recirculation.<br>
The compounds with the formulae (2) and (4) are preferably reacted in<br>
gaseous form. It is furthermore preferred to carry out the synthesis in a two-<br>
stage reaction process, in which both reaction stages proceed in the gas<br>
phase.<br>
In order to achieve maximally quantitative conversion of the feed materials<br>
into the target compounds, unreacted feed materials or educts are<br>
advantageously returned to the process.<br>
The invention in particular relates to a continuous mode of operation of two<br>
or more successive silazane cleavage reactions in a circuit of closed flow<br>
apparatuses without intermediate isolation or storage of the intermediate.<br>
The only secondary product to arise is R23SiCI or R33SiCI, which, by reaction<br>
with R1NH2, may be returned into the educt R23SiNR1SiR33. One particularly<br>
advantageous aspect of the method according to the invention is that no<br>
salts arise as secondary products.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, in the first stage, a compound of<br>
the formula (2), preferably SiHal4-xRx, reacts with a silazane compound, in<br>
particular a compound of the formula (3), preferably Me3SiNR1SiMe3, in the<br>
gas phase or in a gas phase-liquid phase reaction at temperatures of-100°C<br>
to 300°C, in particular of 25 to 100°C and preferably of ≥ 55°C to ≤ 65°C,<br>
and pressures in the reaction volume of 0.1 mbar to 2 bar, and specifically in<br>
each case under p/T conditions, under which the compound of the formula<br><br>
(2) is gaseous and the compound of the formula (3) is gaseous or liquid, but<br>
the saturation vapour pressure of the particular reaction product is exceeded<br>
and the latter is therefore condensed as a liquid, so being withdrawn from<br>
the homogeneous equilibrium and, once separated by a phase separator,<br>
fed into the next stage.<br>
In a second stage, the intermediate is then reacted with a compound of the<br>
formula (4) and specifically preferably under p/T conditions, under which the<br>
compound of the formula (4) is gaseous and the intermediate is liquid. The<br>
second stage is preferably carried out at temperatures of -100°C to +30°C.<br>
The invention is based on the observation that the described type of reaction<br>
may surprisingly be carried out with elevated selectivity even at elevated<br>
temperatures. According to the invention, this is preferably achieved by two<br>
measures:<br>
1.	An excess compound of the formula (2), preferably SiHal4-xRx, is always<br>
present in the reaction volume, such that the two-fold amination, for<br>
example to yield Me3Si-NR1-SiHal2-xRx-NR1-SiMe3 (x = 0.1) is suppressed.<br>
2.	The desired intermediate, for example Hal3-xRxSiNR1SiMe3 is efficiently<br>
drawn off as a liquid phase or removed from the gas phase by<br>
condensation and in this way an undesired further reaction to yield<br>
Hal3-xRxSiNR1SiRxHal3-x is stopped.<br>
If the difference in the boiling points of the feed material of the formula (2),<br>
for example SiHal4-xRx, and of the corresponding secondary product, for<br>
example Me3SiHal is sufficiently large, a condenser is located at the top of<br>
the reaction volume, on which the feed material of the formula (2), for<br>
example SiHal4-xRx, which has been added in excess, is separated and the<br>
secondary product, for example Me3SiHal, is allowed to pass through in<br>
gaseous form. The educt recovered after separation of the phases, for<br>
example SiHal4-xRx, is conveyed back into the reactor. In steady-state<br>
operation, fresh compounds of the formula (3), for example Me3SiNR1SiMe3l<br>
and of the formula (2), for example SiHal4-xRx, are then supplied to the<br>
reactor in the same amount per unit time as the secondary product, for<br>
example Me3SiHal, is removed from the reactor.<br><br>
If, on the other hand, the boiling points of the feed material of the formula (2),<br>
for example SiHal4-xRx, and of the secondary product, for example Me3SiHal,<br>
are very close to one another, the very different molar masses of these<br>
components (for example, molar mass of SiCI4: 169.9; molar mass of<br>
Me3SiCI: 108.6) may sensibly be exploited for the separation thereof.<br>
Suitable methods for this purpose are membrane methods using porous<br>
membranes or adsorption onto molecular sieves. In this case, such a<br>
suitable separation stage firstly adjoins the top of the reactor, in which the<br>
sub-stream enriched with educt, for example SiHal4-xRx, is condensed and<br>
returned to the process. Fresh educt, for example SiHal4-xRx is fed into the<br>
process in a molar quantity per unit time which corresponds to the cumulated<br>
quantity of discharged educt, for example SiHal4-xRx, and secondary product,<br>
for example Me3SiHal, while fresh compounds of the formula (3), for<br>
example Me3SiNR1SiMe3, are supplied to the reactor in the same amount<br>
per unit time as the secondary product, for example Me3SiHal, is removed<br>
from the reactor.<br>
The intermediate, for example Hal3-xRxSiNR1SiMe3, is introduced into the<br>
second reaction stage in gaseous or liquid form and reacted with an excess<br>
of compounds of the formula (4), for example BCI3. The pressure and<br>
temperature in the reactor are suitably adjusted such that the partial<br>
pressure of the secondary product, for example Me3SiHal, is lower than the<br>
saturation vapour pressure thereof. In particular, temperatures of-100°C to<br>
300°C and pressures of 0.1 mbar to 2 bar satisfy the stated requirements for<br>
p/T conditions. Secondary product, for example Me3SiHal, and excess<br>
compounds of the formula (4), for example BCI3, are drawn off from the top<br>
of the reactor. The secondary product, for example Me3SiHal, is condensed<br>
and reused for the production of the starting materials of the formula (3), for<br>
example Me3SiNR1SiMe3. The educt of the formula (4), for example BCI3, is<br>
returned to the reactor. The final product is obtained in liquid form and may<br>
be discharged from the bottom of the reactor and, if necessary, purified by<br>
partial condensation, distillation or pervaporation.<br>
The method according to the invention may in particular be used for the<br>
production of compounds which comprise the structural feature X-N-Y, in<br>
which X and Y may in each case independently be B, Al, Ga, In, Si, Ge, P,<br>
Ti, Zr, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, Fe or Zn. It is particularly preferably used for<br><br>
production of a compound which has the formula (1) RxHal3-xSi-NR1-<br>
BRyHal2-y, in which Hal in each case independently means CI, Br or I, R in<br>
each case independently represents a hydrocarbon residue with 1 to 20 C<br>
atoms or hydrogen, R1 represents a hydrocarbon residue with 1 to 20 C<br>
atoms or hydrogen, x = 0, 1 or 2 and y = 0 or 1.<br>
The desired products are preferably produced in a two-stage process. The<br>
compounds according to the formula (1) are for example produced by<br>
reacting a hexamethyldisilazane component (HMDS) Me3SiNR1SiMe3 in<br>
succession in any desired order with a silane component SiHal4-xRx and a<br>
borane component BHal3-yRy. In the first step, the silane component, which is<br>
introduced in a gaseous state, is preferably caused to react in the gas phase<br>
or a gas phase-liquid phase reaction continuously or in portions, with or<br>
without a carrier gas, with the hexamethyldisilazane component, which is<br>
introduced in a liquid or gaseous state of aggregation. The intermediate<br>
formed is in turn preferably further reacted in the second step with the<br>
borane component in excess in an inert solvent, preferably in the gas phase<br>
or more preferably in pure condensed phase. Alternatively, the intermediate<br>
may be caused to react in a liquid state of aggregation with the borane<br>
component which is present in a gaseous state. Depending on p/T<br>
conditions, the target compound is obtained in pure form or mixed with the<br>
secondary product Me3SiCI and the excess borane component and may be<br>
isolated with a phase separator. Using this reaction pathway, it is possible<br>
inter alia to produce the compounds MeCI2SiNHBCI2 (MADB) (1a),<br>
CI3SiNHBCI2 (TADB) (1b), (CH3)2CISiNHBCI2 (DADB), CI3SiNCH3BCI2<br>
(DMTA) or CH3CI2SiNCH3BCI2 (DDMA) in pure form. In the case of MADB,<br>
methyltrichlorosilane, which is introduced in a gaseous state, and<br>
hexamethyldisilazane, which is introduced in a gaseous or liquid state of<br>
aggregation, are caused to react in the gas phase or in a gas phase-liquid<br>
phase reaction. In the case of TADB, tetrachlorosilane is used instead of<br>
methyltrichlorosilane, the reaction being carried out in analogous manner.<br>
The intermediates obtained are respectively MeCI2SiNHSiMe3 and<br>
CI3SiNHSiMe3, which are in each case reacted in the gas phase or preferably<br>
in condensed form with gaseous trichloroborane.<br><br>
In the formula RxHal3-xSi-NR1-BRyHal2-y (1), the residues R and R1 may in<br>
each case independently mean hydrogen or a hydrocarbon residue with 1 to<br>
20 C atoms, preferably with 1 to 10 C atoms.<br>
A hydrocarbon residue is here a residue which is formed from the elements<br>
carbon and hydrogen. According to the invention, hydrocarbon residues may<br>
be branched or unbranched, saturated or unsaturated. The hydrocarbon<br>
residue may also contain aromatic groups, which may in turn be substituted<br>
with hydrocarbon residues. Examples of preferred hydrocarbon residues are<br>
for example unbranched saturated hydrocarbon residues, such as for<br>
instance C1 to C20 alkyl, in particular methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, n-butyl, n-pentyl,<br>
n-hexyl, n-heptyl, n-octyl, n-nonyl and n-decyl. The residues R and/or R1<br>
may, however, also comprise branched saturated hydrocarbon residues, in<br>
particular branched C3 to C20 alkyls, such as for instance i-propyl, i-butyl, t-<br>
butyl and further branched alkyl residues. In one embodiment, the residues<br>
R and/or R1 comprise one or more olefinically unsaturated groups. Examples<br>
of such residues are vinyl, allyl, butenyl, pentenyl, hexenyl, heptenyl, octenyl,<br>
nonenyl, decenyl, pentadienyl, heptadienyl, octadienyl, nonadienyl and<br>
decadienyl. The residues R and/or R1 may also contain an alkyne group,<br>
thus a C=C bond. In a further embodiment, at least one residue R and/or R1,<br>
preferably all the residues R and/or R1, contain(s) an aromatic group, in<br>
particular an aromatic group with 5 to 10 C atoms, in particular 5 or 6 C<br>
atoms, such as for instance a phenyl group or an aromatic group, in<br>
particular a phenyl group, substituted with a hydrocarbon, in particular a C1<br>
to C10 hydrocarbon, such as for instance methylphenyl, dimethylphenyl,<br>
trimethylphenyl, ethylphenyl or propylphenyl. Including the substituents, the<br>
aromatic residue preferably comprises 5 to 20, in particular to 10 C atoms.<br>
The hydrocarbon residues R and R1 may here in each case mutually<br>
independently be varied.<br>
Preferably, at least one residue R and/or R1 and in particular all the residues<br>
R and/or R1 comprise(s) hydrogen, a C1 to C20 alkyl group, in particular a C1<br>
to C6 alkyl group, a phenyl group, a vinyl group or an allyl group or a<br>
hydrocarbon residue with 1 to 3 C atoms, in particular methyl, ethyl or propyl<br>
and particularly preferably methyl.<br><br>
The residue Hal denotes a halogen atom and in particular means CI, Br or I,<br>
it being preferred for at least one Hal residue and preferably all Hal residues<br>
to mean CI.<br>
The invention is described in greater detail by the attachec ACCOMPANYING Figures 1-4 and<br>
the following Examples. Figures 1-4 are schematic diagrams of variants of<br>
the production plant for the two-stage method according to the present<br>
invention.<br><br>
Examples<br>
Example 1: Synthesis of MADB (1a)<br>
Figure 1 shows the method flow chart according to one embodiment of the<br>
invention. The procedures in reaction stages I and II are independent of one<br>
another and are described sequentially.<br>
MeSiCL3 is apportioned from the temperature-controlled holding vessel 1 and<br>
HMDS from the temperature-controlled holding vessel 2 either pure or in an<br>
inert carrier gas stream, for example N2, He, Ar, CO2, into the reactor 3. The<br>
feed materials are both jointly introduced pointwise, or both spatially<br>
distributed or one pointwise and one spatially distributed into the reactor 3 of<br>
the first reaction stage. Thanks to the nature of apportioning and flow control,<br>
a stoichiometric excess of MeSiCI3 to HMDS of at least 2:1 is ensured<br>
throughout the entire reaction chamber.<br>
Reactor temperature is controlled with the assistance of an external heat<br>
exchanger 3a to a temperature between -100°C and 300°C, in particular<br>
between 25°C and 100°C. The total pressure in the reactor 3 is between<br>
0.1 mbar and 2 bar. Pressure and temperature are here adjusted relative to<br>
one another such that the partial pressures of the feed compounds MeSiCI3<br>
and HMDS are below their respective saturation vapour pressures, but the<br>
partial pressure of the intermediate MeCl2SiNHSiMe3 exceeds its saturation<br>
pressure. Under these conditions, the intermediate condenses, is discharged<br>
from the reaction volume via a phase separator 4 and directly supplied to the<br>
second reaction stage, alternatively it may be held in a buffer vessel 5. At the<br>
top of the reactor 3, the feed material MeSiCl3 is condensed from the volatile<br>
components on a heat exchanger 6 and separated by means of a phase<br>
separator 7 from the secondary product Me3SiCI. The temperature of the<br>
heat exchanger 6 is adjusted such that, at the given pressure, MeSiCl3<br>
exceeds its saturation vapour pressure, but Me3SiCI is below its saturation<br>
vapour pressure. MeSiCI3 is recirculated into the reactor. In steady-state<br>
operation, MeSiCI3 and HMDS are replenished from the storage vessels 1_<br>
and 2 in the same molar quantity per unit time as the Me3SiCI is removed<br>
from the reactor.<br>
The intermediate from the first reaction stage is reacted in the second<br>
reaction stage with an excess of BCI3, which is supplied from the<br><br>
temperature-controlled holding vessel 8. The second reaction stage may be<br>
of an analogous structure to the first stage, the reactor temperature being<br>
adjusted between -100°C and +30°C and the pressure set such that at least<br>
BCI3 is in gaseous form, or may be carried out according to the prior art (DE<br>
4 107 108, DE 10 045 428, DE 10 104 536). The final product is purified by<br>
phase separation.<br>
The phase separators 4 and 7 may function by the principle of mechanical<br>
separation, for example inertial separators or cyclones. Thermal or physico-<br>
chemical separation methods may, however, also be used.<br>
Distillation/rectification or pervaporation may in particular be considered.<br>
The product yield of MADB amounts over both stages to at least 76%<br>
relative to the introduced HMDS. The product is characterised by mass<br>
spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. MS (70 eV):<br>
m/z = 196 (M+-CH3), 174 (M+-HCI), 158 (M+-HCI-CH3), 138 (M+-2HCI), 1H-<br>
NMR: δ= 0.47; 0.49; 13C-NMR: 5= 6.3; 9.3; 128.4; 11B-NMR: 5= 36.4; 41.8.<br>
Example 2: Synthesis of MADB (1a)<br>
The boiling points of the educts, the intermediate, the secondary product and<br>
the final product are in a favourable ratio to one another, such that MADB<br>
may be synthesised by reactive distillation. Figure 2 shows the diagram of<br>
this process variant. The process proceeds in a vacuum column 4. The<br>
educts of the first reaction stage are introduced into the rectification section<br>
together or at different positions 1 and 2. The highly volatile secondary<br>
product MeSiCl3 is enriched towards the top of the column and the<br>
intermediate Cl3SiNHSiMe3 towards the exhausting section of the column.<br>
BCI3 is separately introduced into the column via the inlet 3. The product is<br>
collected at the bottom of the column.<br>
Example 3: Synthesis of TADB (1b)<br>
Preparation of compound (1b) proceeds in analogous manner to the<br>
preparation of compound (1a) in Example 1, but using SiCl4 and HMDS<br>
instead of MeSiCI3 and HMDS as the educts. At the top of the reactor 3,<br>
unreacted SiCI4 and secondary product Me3SiCI leave the reaction chamber<br>
together in gaseous form, as they have the same vaporisation temperature.<br><br>
The SiCI4/Me3SiCI mixture is accordingly separated by means of a suitable<br>
separation stage 7 (membrane method with porous membranes or<br>
adsorption onto molecular sieves) and the sub-stream enriched with SiCI4 is<br>
condensed in a total condenser 6 and recirculated into the first reaction<br>
stage. In steady-state operation, SiCl4 and HMDS are resupplied to the<br>
process from the storage vessels 1 and 2 in a molar quantity per unit time<br>
which corresponds to the cumulated quantity of Me3SiCI and discharged<br>
SiCl4.<br>
The product yield of TADB amounts over both stages to at least 85% relative<br>
to the introduced HMDS. The product is characterised by mass spectrometry<br>
and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. MS (70 eV): m/z = 231 (M+),<br>
196 (M+-CI), 160 (M+-CI -HCI); 1H-NMR: δ= 4.41; 11B-NMR: δ= 35.7; 29Si-<br>
NMR: δ=-23.7.<br>
Figure 3 shows the method flow chart according to the described<br>
embodiment of the invention.<br>
Example 4: Synthesis of TADB (1b)<br>
Preparation of compound (1b) proceeds in analogous manner to the<br>
preparation of compound (1a) in Example 2 (Figure 2), but using SiCl4 and<br>
HMDS instead of MeSiCI3 and HMDS as the educts. Moreover, the educts<br>
for the first reaction stage are preferably introduced into the rectification<br>
section at different positions 1 and 2. Due to its higher boiling point, the feed<br>
material HMDS is introduced into the rectification section above the feed<br>
material SiCl4-<br>
Example 5: Synthesis of TADB (1b)<br>
Figure 4 shows the method flow chart according to an embodiment of the<br>
invention. The procedures in reaction stages (I) and (II) are independent of<br>
one another and are described sequentially.<br>
SiCl4, is apportioned from a temperature-controlled holding vessel 1 either<br>
pure or in an inert carrier gas stream, for example N2, He, Ar, CO2l into the<br><br>
lower part of the reactor of the first reaction stage 2 (for example falling-film<br>
reactor). HMDS is apportioned in liquid form from the storage vessel 3 into<br>
the top of the reactor and reacts countercurrently with gaseous SiCI4. The<br>
molar flow rates of the two reactants are controlled such that a stoichiometric<br>
excess of SiCl4 to HMDS of 1.2 to 1.5 is maintained in the reaction chamber.<br>
Reactor temperature is controlled between -50°C and 200°C with the<br>
assistance of a external heat exchanger 2a. The total pressure in the reactor<br>
2 is between 1 mbar and 1 bar. Pressure and temperature are here adjusted<br>
relative to one another such that the partial pressures of the feed compound<br>
SiCI4 and of the secondary product MeSiCI3 are below their respective<br>
saturation vapour pressures, but HMDS and the intermediate CI3SiNHSiMe3<br>
are in liquid form. This is the case, for example, with the combination 60°C /<br>
300 mbar. The intermediate is discharged in liquid form at the bottom of the<br>
falling-film reactor and directly supplied to the second reaction stage.<br>
Alternatively, the intermediate may be held in a buffer vessel 5. At the top of<br>
the reactor 2, unreacted SiCl4, and secondary product Me3SiCI leave the<br>
reaction chamber together in gaseous form, as they have virtually the same<br>
vaporisation temperature. The further treatment thereof proceeds as<br>
described in Example 3.<br>
The intermediate from the first reaction stage is reacted in the second<br>
reaction stage with an excess (1.1-1.5 times) of BCI3, which is supplied from<br>
the temperature-controlled holding vessel 8. The second reaction stage may<br>
be of an analogous structure to the first, but may also take the form of a<br>
plate column, temperature and pressure conditions being adjusted relative to<br>
one another such that feed material BCI3 is in gaseous form and the<br>
secondary product Me3SiCI is in gaseous or liquid form, while the<br>
intermediate stage CI3SiNHSiMe3 and the final product CI3SiNHBCI2 (TADB)<br>
are in liquid form. Excess BCI3 and the secondary product Me3SiCI are<br>
discharged in gaseous form from the top of the reactor and separated with a<br>
phase separator. Recovered BCI3 is supplied, for example, to the holding<br>
vessel 8, while Me3SiCI is recirculated into the production of the feed material<br>
HMDS. The final product is purified by phase separation and optionally<br>
separated from the secondary product Me3SiCI.<br><br>
The phase separators 4 and 9 may function by the principle of mechanical<br>
separation, for example inertial separators or cyclones. Thermal or physico-<br>
chemical separation methods may, however, also be used.<br>
Distillation/rectification or pervaporation may in particular be considered.<br>
The product yield of TADB amounts over both stages to at least 84% relative<br>
to the introduced HMDS. The product is characterised by mass spectrometry<br>
and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (see Example 3).<br><br><br>
