				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method of converting (Z)-l-(3,5-disubstituted phenyl)-2-(4-substituted phenyl)ethene of general formula (II) to (E)-l-(3,5-disubstituted phenyl)-2-(4-substituted phenyl)ethene of general formula (I).<br><br>
wherein R1, R2, R3 are same or different and independently represent (C1-C4)alkyl, (C1-C4)alkoxy(C1-C4)alkyl, (C1-C4)alkoxy(C1-C4)alkoxy(C1-C4)alkyl, allyl, vinyl, silyl, formyl, acyl, aryl(Ci-C4)alkyl or substituted aryl(Ci-C4)alkyl group.<br>
The compound of formula (I) is useful as a key intermediate in the preparation of E-resveratrol of the formula (III), without contamination of the corresponding Z-isomer, which is formed during the process of synthesis. E-resveratrol has broad spectrum biological activity. Moreover, the preparation of £"-resveratrol can be accomplished quite easily and inexpensively.<br><br><br>
Background of the Invention<br>
	jw of the vital biological activities of the polyhydroxylated trans--<br>
stilbenes, there have been a few methods reported for the synthesis of these compounds.<br>
US Patent 6,048,903 describes the synthesis of f-resveratrol by the Wittig reaction of 3,5-dimethoxybenzyltriphenyl phosphonium salt with p-anisaldehyde in the presence of n-butyl lithium. In this method the mixture of Z- and E- olefins so obtained is demethylated with large amount of boron tribromide to get very low yield of the product. This method suffers from the low quality and use of expensive and hazardous reagents.<br>
WO 00/21368 describes the condensation of phosphonate esters with aromatic aldehydes followed by demethylation using pyridine hydrochloride. In this method also the yields are low &amp; the process is not commercially attractive.<br>
Drewes, S. E.; Fletcher, I. P J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I 1974, 961-962 &amp; Bajaj, R.; Gill, M. T.; McLaughlin, J. L. Rev. Latinoamer Ouim. 1987,18, 79-80 reported the synthesis of analogs of E-resveratrol wherein a mixture oiE- &amp; Z-isomer is obtained.<br>
Cunningham, J.; Haslam, E.; Haworth, R. D. J. Chem. Soc. 1963, 2875-2883 disclosed a different route, which comprises reaction of 3,5-dihydroxyphenylacetate and 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde in acetic anhydride, decarboxylation of the ensuing 3,3',4,5'-tetraacetoxystilbene-a-carboxylic acid with copper and quinoline at high temperature, and hydrolysis of the resulting piceatannol tetraacetate with sodium hydroxide. The reported yields in these methods are moderate to low.<br>
AH, M. A.; Kondo, K.; Tsuda, Y. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1992, 40(5). 1130-1136 described the Wittig reactions, wherein the undesired Z- isomers are reported to form to the extent of 52% along with the desired £^-isomers (48%) when potassium tert-butoxide is employed.<br><br>
Cushman, M.; Nagarathnam, D.; Gopal, D. et al. J. Med. Chem. 1992, 35 (12). 2293-2306; Chen, Yi-Ping; Lei, Tong-Kang. Zhongguo Yivao Gongye Zazhi 2000, 31(7). 334-336 disclosed the formation of Z- isomers to the extent of 45% (E: 55%) when sodium hydride is used.<br>
All of the above prior art disclosures have following limitations because of which the process is commercially not suitable &amp; hazardous:<br>
A mixture of Z- and ^-isomers is always encountered and the isomers are separated by column chromatography or by crystallization techniques. Conversion of Z- into E- isomers with the aid of photochemical techniques are reported, wherein the mixture of Z- and E- isomers are irradiated with high powered lamps in the presence of catalysts like diaryl disulfides at high temperature.<br>
In addition, the disulfides, which are essential for photochemical conversions, produce very bad smell and not environmentally acceptable.<br>
Thus these techniques make the process not preferable for the industrial scale and, more over, these are non eco-friendly.<br>
Objectives of the Invention<br>
The objective of the present invention is to prepare exclusively the (^-1-(3,5-disubstituted phenyl)-2-(4-substituted phenyl)ethene of general formula (I).<br>
Another objective of the invention is to develop a simple, eco-friendly commercial method for converting Z-isomer of the formula (II) to the ^-isomer of the formula (I).<br>
Still another objective is to avoid the use of purification techniques like solvent crystallization &amp; column chromatography.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a simple and effective process without using photochemical reaction in the manufacturing process.<br><br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide a high-yielding method of producing exclusively the £'-resveratrol of the formula (III) from (E)-l-(3,5-disubstituted phenyl)-2-(4-substitutedphenyl)ethene of general formula (I).<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a method of converting (Z)-l-(3,5-disubstituted phenyl)-2-(4-substituted phenyl)ethene of general formula (II) to (£)-l-(3,5-disubstituted phenyl)-2-(4-substituted phenyl)ethene of general formula (I) <br>
wherein Ri, R2, R3 are same or different and independently represent (Ci-C4)alkyl, (Ci-C4)alkoxy(Ci-C4)alkyl, (Ci-C4)alkoxy(Ci-C4)alkoxy(Ci-C4)alkyl, allyl, vinyl, silyl, formyl, acyl, aryl(Ci-C4)alkyl or substituted aryl(Ci-C4)alkyl group, the said method comprising steps of:<br>
(a)	treating isomeric mixture of (Z)-l-(3,5-disubstituted phenyl)-2-(4-substituted phenyl)ethene of the general formula (II) and (£)-l-(3,5-disubstituted phenyl)-2-(4-substituted phenyl)ethene of the general formula (I) or (Z)-l-(3,5-disubstituted phenyl)-2-(4-substituted phenyl)ethene of the general formula (II) with halogen in catalytic amounts, in an organic solvent for a period of 15 min to 16 hrs, at a temperature varying from -10 °C to +110 °C,<br>
(b)	quenching into cold water and reducing the halogen using a reducing agent and<br>
(c)	isolating the product formed to produce (£)-l-(3,5-disubstituted phenyl)-2-(4-<br>
substituted phenyl)ethene of general formula (I).<br><br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a method for the conversion of (£)-l-(3,5-disubstituted phenyl)-2-(4-substituted phenyl)ethene of general formula (I) prepared by a method described above to E-resveratrol of the formula (III) which comprises deprotecting the protecting groups R], R2, and R3 by conventional methods.<br>
Description of tlie Invention<br>
In an embodiment, the groups represented by R], R2, and R3 are selected from (Ci-C4)alkyl group such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl, iso-butyl, sec-butyl; (Ci-C4)alkoxy(Ci-C4)alkyl group such as methoxymethyl, methoxyethyl, methoxypropyl, ethoxymethyl, ethoxyethyl, ethoxypropyl; (Cp C4)alkoxy(Ci-C4)alkoxy(Ci-C4)alkyl group such as methoxyethoxymethyl, methoxyethoxyethyl; allyl, vinyl, silyl, formyl, acyl group such as acetyl, propanoyl, butanoyl or benzoyl; aryl(Ci-C4)alkyl or substituted aryl(Ci-C4)alkyl group such as benzyl, phenethyl, diphenylmethyl, p-methoxybenzyl, p-nitrobenzyl, p-methylbenzyl or o-chlorobenzyl.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the solvents used in step (i) are selected from chloroform, dichloromethane, dioxane, THF, methanol, ethanol or isopropanol, more particularly, dichloromethane.<br>
In another embodiment, the stereochemical conversion is carried out at temperature in the range of-10 °C to +110 °C and more particularly, 0-40 °C.<br>
In still another embodiment, the halogen used in step (i) is selected from iodine, chlorine or bromine, in catalytic quantities ranging from 0.1% w/w to 10% w/w, more particularly, from 1% w/w to 5% w/w.<br>
In still another embodiment, the reducing agent used in step (ii) is selected from olefins like cyclohexene, cyclopentene, isoprene, or from inorganic reagents like sodium metabisulfite, sodium thiosulfate, or sodium bisulfite.<br>
The foregoing technique has been found to be markedly attractive, both from commercial point of view, as well as from a stereo selectivity standpoint, and<br><br>
atlords an almost exclusive formation of the ^-isomer and is also free from the limitations discussed above.<br>
The starting materials of the present invention, (Z)-l-(3,5-disubstituted phenyl)-2-(4-substituted phenyl)ethene of general formula (II) or its mixture with the corresponding ^'-isomer can be produced by the methods known in the art.<br>
The probable mechanism of the stereochemical conversion is predicted in which a reversible addition-elimination of iodine to the double bond of the subject compound of the formula (II), which results in the formation of stable ^-isomer exclusively has been suggested. The mechanism is shown in Scheme-1 below:<br><br>
The present invention is illustrated with the following examples, which should not be construed as limiting to the scope of the invention.<br><br>
