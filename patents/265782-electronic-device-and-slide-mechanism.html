				<td>ELECTRONIC DEVICE AND SLIDE MECHANISM<br>
FIELD<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates in general to electronic devices, and more<br>
specifically to slide mechanisms in the electronic devices.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] Due to the growth in modern communication technology, a large number of<br>
electronic devices such as mobile phones, pagers, cameras, MP3 players, remote<br>
controllers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and the like, have been introduced in<br>
the market. In order to keep up with this trend and to gain a competitive advantage,<br>
manufacturers of electronic devices focus on enhancing the functionalities of the<br>
electronic devices, and at the same time making them compact. However, the small<br>
size of the electronic devices reduces the area available for their components such as<br>
keys and displays. To counter this restriction due to the reduced area, electronic<br>
devices with multiple housings have been developed. Such electronic devices can be<br>
folded or made compact in other ways when they are not in use, and are capable of<br>
performing different operations in different configurations.<br>
[0003] Some foldable electronic devices have two or more housings. However,<br>
electronic devices with multiple housings suffer from one or more of the following<br>
limitations. First, the multiple housings increase the weight of the electronic device.<br>
Second, multiple housings increase the thickness of the electronic device. Third, while<br>
typing text in alphanumeric characters, the electronic device needs to be switched to<br>
different configurations to alternatively enter characters from a telephonic keypad or a<br>
QWERTY keypad. Fourth, the multiple housings can be made compact or made to<br>
slide in one direction only - either along their length or their breadth.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0004] An electronic device that includes a plurality of housings that slide with<br>
respect to each other in a non-linear motion is described.<br>
[0005]<br><br>

[0022] FIG. 1 shows a view of an exemplary electronic device 100, in accordance<br>
with an embodiment of the present disclosure. In accordance with the embodiment,<br>
the electronic device 100 is shown in a compact configuration. The electronic device<br>
100 can also have other configurations, such as a landscape configuration and a<br>
portrait configuration. Examples of the electronic device 100 include devices such as<br>
mobile phones, pagers, cameras, MP3 players, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and<br>
the like. The electronic device 100 includes a first housing 102 and a second housing<br>
104. The first housing 102 includes a display unit 106 and can also include external<br>
keys. The external keys can be navigational keys and soft keys, although they may be<br>
easily substituted by other keys such as power on-off, volume up-down, display on-<br>
off, and display contrast up-down. Further, external keys may be implemented<br>
virtually by using a touch screen, a touchpad, a joystick or other input mechanisms.<br>
[0023] In the compact configuration, the first housing 102 and the second housing<br>
104 are aligned with each other. A length of the first housing 102 is aligned with the<br>
length of the second housing 104, and a breadth of the first housing 102 is aligned<br>
with the breadth of the second housing 104. The portrait configuration and the<br>
landscape configuration are defined, based on the relative positions of the first<br>
housing 102 and the second housing 104 with respect to each other. The electronic<br>
device 100 further includes an internal keypad (not shown in FIG. 1) on the second<br>
housing 104. In accordance with an embodiment, the compact configuration, the<br>
portrait configuration, and the landscape configuration have an effect on the usability<br>
of the internal keypad. The internal keypad includes a first portion referred to as a<br>
numeric keypad, and a second portion referred to as a QWERTY keypad. In<br><br>
accordance with, an embodiment, the internal keypad can be the QWERTY keypad<br>
and need not include a separate set of keys apart from those present in the QWERTY<br>
keypad. In such a case, the numeric keypad is part of the QWERTY keypad.<br>
[0024] FIG. 2 shows a view of the electronic device 100 in the portrait<br>
configuration, in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. In the<br>
portrait configuration, the first housing 102 is offset in a first direction with respect to<br>
the second housing 104, to expose the numeric keypad 202. Therefore, in the portrait<br>
configuration, the numeric keypad 202 can be used. In accordance with an<br>
embodiment, the first housing 102 is offset along the length of the second housing<br>
104, to present a length-wise augmented profile of the electronic device 100 as shown<br>
in FIG. 2.<br>
[0025] FIG. 3 shows a view of the electronic device 100 in the landscape<br>
configuration, in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. In the<br>
landscape configuration, the first housing 102 is offset in a second direction with<br>
respect to the second housing 104, to expose the QWERTY keypad 302. Therefore, in<br>
the landscape configuration, the QWERTY keypad 302 can be used. In accordance<br>
with an embodiment, the first housing 102 is offset along the breadth of the second<br>
housing 104, to present a breadth-wise augmented profile of the electronic device 100.<br>
[0026] The electronic device 100 is suitable for operation in the compact<br>
configuration, the portrait configuration, and the landscape configuration. The portrait<br>
configuration and the landscape configuration are defined, based on the relative<br>
positions of the first housing 102 and the second housing 104 with respect to each<br>
other, as described earlier. A bar linkage is used in order to effect changes between<br>
the compact configuration, the portrait configuration, and the landscape configuration.<br>
[0027] FIG. 4 shows the bar linkage in the electronic device 100, in accordance<br>
with an embodiment of the present disclosure. Examples of the bar linkage, which is a<br>
slidablc non-linear mechanism, include, but arc not limited to, a thrcc-bar linkage and<br>
a four-bar linkage 401. In accordance with the embodiment, the four-bar linkage 401<br>
slides the first housing 102 with respect to the second housing 104 in a non-linear<br>
motion, to configure the compact configuration, the portrait configuration or the<br><br>
landscape configuration. To slide the first housing 102 with respect to the second<br>
housing 104, a curved track 402 is provided in the first housing 102. The curved track<br>
402 allows a two-dimensional movement of the four-bar linkage 401 in the curved<br>
track 402, and restricts a three-dimensional movement of the four-bar linkage 401. In<br>
this view, a first bar 403 and a second bar 404 of the four-bar linkage 401 are shown.<br>
The second bar 404 will be functionally described in conjunction with FIG. 5.<br>
[0028] FIG. 5 shows a view of the four-bar linkage 401, in accordance with an<br>
embodiment of the present disclosure. In this embodiment, the slidable non-linear<br>
mechanism also includes a data coupler 502. The data coupler 502 electronically<br>
couples the first housing 102 with the second housing 104. In accordance with an<br>
embodiment of the present disclosure, the data coupler 502 is a flexible circuit that<br>
can couple the first housing 102 with the second housing 104 even.when they are<br>
offset with respect to each other to form the portrait configuration and the landscape<br>
configuration from the compact configuration. Examples of the data coupler 502<br>
include, but are not limited to, flexible circuits and optical couplers.<br>
[0029] The four-bar linkage 401 includes the first bar 403 (not shown in FIG. 5),<br>
the second bar 404, a third bar 504, and a fourth bar 506. The first bar 403 is attached<br>
to the first housing 102, while the second bar 404 is attached to the second housing<br>
104. The third bar 504 and the fourth bar 506 are coupled to the first bar 403 and the<br>
second bar 404, so that the first bar 403 and the second bar 404 remain substantially<br>
parallel during the movement of the first bar 403 and the second bar 404. The third<br>
bar 504 has a first end 508 and a second end 510. Similarly, the fourth bar 506 has a<br>
first end 512 and a second end 514. In an embodiment of the present disclosure, the<br>
first housing 102 is prevented from moving into a perpendicular position with respect<br>
to the second housing 104 by the fourth bar 506. Examples of the four-bar linkage 401<br>
constructions include, but are not restricted to, a stacked plate type and a rod and<br>
bushing type.<br>
[0030] In accordance with another embodiment of the present disclosure, the fourth<br>
bar 506 can be removed from the four-bar linkage 401 to form the three-bar linkage.<br>
The three-bar linkage enables the movement of the first housing 102 into an<br>
essentially perpendicular position in the second housing 104. This can be useful<br><br>
where a configuration of the first housing 102 forming a 'T'-shape with the second<br>
housing 104 is desirable, such as when the electronic device 100 is used as a video<br>
player or in camera mode, to facilitate viewing of landscape pictures or any similar<br>
use.<br>
[0031] In accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure, at least one of<br>
the third bar 504 and the fourth bar 506 include a data coupler path 516 to route the<br>
data coupler 502 through it. The data coupler 502 electronically couples the first<br>
housing 102 with the second housing 104 by being routed through the data coupler<br>
path 516. The data coupler path 516 is further described in conjunction with FIG. 9.<br>
[0032] FIG. 6 shows a view of the electronic device 100 in the compact<br>
configuration, with respect to the bar linkage of FTGs. 4 and 5, in accordance with an<br>
embodiment of the present disclosure. In the compact configuration, the first housing<br>
102 and the second housing 104 are aligned with each other.<br>
[0033] FIG. 7 shows a view of the electronic device 100 in the landscape<br>
configuration, with respect to the bar linkage of FlGs. 4 and 5, in accordance with an<br>
embodiment of the present disclosure. In the landscape configuration, the first<br>
housing 102 and the second housing 104 are offset with respect to each other along<br>
the breadth, relative to the compact configuration, but remain aligned with each other<br>
along the length. The landscape configuration reveals the QWERTY keypad 302 on<br>
the second housing 104. The electronic device 100 is operated in the landscape<br>
configuration by using the external keys, if there are any, and the QWERTY keypad<br>
302.<br>
[0034] FIG. 8 shows a view of the electronic device of FIG. 1 in the portrait<br>
configuration, with respect to the bar linkage of FIGs. 4 and 5, in accordance with an<br>
embodiment of the present disclosure. In the portrait configuration, the first housing<br>
102 and the second housing 104 are offset with respect to each other along the length,<br>
relative to the compact configuration, but remain aligned with each other along the<br>
breadth. The portrait configuration reveals the numeric keypad 202 on the second<br>
housing 104. The electronic device 100 is operated in the portrait configuration by<br>
using the external keys, if there are any, and the numeric keypad 202.<br><br>
[0035] In accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure, when the<br>
electronic device 100 is a mobile phone, the portrait configuration is suitable for<br>
operating it in a talk mode. In the talk mode, it is desirable to have a greater length of<br>
the electronic device 100 facilitating the placement of a speaker in the mobile phone<br>
near the ear of a user, while bringing a microphone close to the mouth of the user.<br>
Further, access to the numeric keypad 202 can be useful to enable input or selection of<br>
numbers to be called. Alternatively, the landscape configuration is suitable for<br>
operating the electronic device 100 in a PDA mode. In the PDA mode, it is desirable<br>
to have a greater breadth of the electronic device 100, to facilitate ease of access to all<br>
the keys of the QWERTY keypad 302, which is more conveniently used for the input<br>
of text messages such as notes or email, as compared to the internal keypad 202.<br>
[0036] In the compact configuration, the portrait configuration and the landscape<br>
configuration, exchange of electrical signals between the first housing 102 and the<br>
second housing 104 is required, such as between the display unit 106 and the keypads.<br>
The data coupler 502 that is routed through the data coupler path 516 carries these<br>
electrical signals between the first housing 102 and the second housing 104.<br>
[0037] FIG. 9 shows a section view of the data coupler path 516, in accordance with<br>
an embodiment. In the section view of the data coupler path 516, the data coupler 502<br>
is shown in bold, and depicts the routing of the data coupler 502 around a pin 902.<br>
The data coupler 502 can be held in place in the data coupler path 516 by means of a<br>
metal clip, or an adhesive, for example, but not limited to, epoxy or other forms of<br>
potting material. The pin 902 can protrude from the first end 508 of the third bar 504,<br>
the second end 510 of the third bar 504, the first end 512 of the fourth bar 506 or the<br>
second end 514 of the fourth bar 506. For example, in conjunction with FIGs. 5 and<br>
6, the pin 902 is a protrusion from the first end 508 of the third bar 504. The pin 902<br>
moves in the curved track 402 in the first housing 102. This restricts the three-<br>
dimensional or z-axis movement of the four-bar linkage 401. The curved track 402<br>
acts as a clearance cut for the pin 902.<br>
[0038] In accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure, the third bar<br>
504 includes the data coupler path 516 and multiple pins, for example, two pins,<br>
including the pin 902. The fourth bar 506 includes a pin and a hole. The fourth bar<br><br>
506 can also include two pins, but including only one pin and the hole instead of the<br>
second pin reduces the thickness of the electronic device 100. This is because the pin<br>
of the fourth bar 506 can be placed in the first housing 102.<br>
[0039] During the operation of the electronic device 100, the data coupler 502 in the<br>
data coupler path 516 can be subjected to a force that tends to displace the data<br>
coupler 502 from the data coupler path 516. For example, when changing between the<br>
compact configuration and the portrait configuration or the landscape configuration of<br>
the electronic device 100, the data coupler 502 can experience such a force.<br>
[0040] FIG. 10 shows a view of the thirdbar 504 of FIG. 4, illustrating the bar<br>
linkage being held in place by a snap ring 1002, in accordance with an embodiment.<br>
The pin 902 can be held in place, and movement of the pin 902 can be restricted. The<br>
snap ring 1002 is used to anchor the joint at which the pin 902 is placed on the bar<br>
linkage, and holds the bar linkage in place, restricting the degree of freedom of the pin<br>
902. The data coupler 502 extends and retracts around the pin 902, to enable changing<br>
between the compact configuration, the portrait configuration, and the landscape<br>
configuration. To hold the electronic device 100 in the compact configuration, the<br>
portrait configuration or the landscape configuration, a cam mechanism can be used.<br>
[0041] FIG. 11 shows a view of a cam mechanism 1100 that can hold the electronic<br>
device 100 of FIG. 1 in the compact configuration, the portrait configuration or the<br>
landscape configuration, in accordance with an embodiment. FIG. 11 shows the<br>
connection between the third bar 504 and the second bar 404. The cam mechanism<br>
1100 resides, for example, in the second bar 404. An exploded view of the cam<br>
mechanism 1100 is shown in FIG. 11. In accordance with an embodiment of the<br>
present disclosure, the cam mechanism 1100 includes a ball and socket type joint, in<br>
which a ball 1102 is selectively inserted into a socket 1104 by a spring 1106. This<br>
holds the relative positioning of the bar linkages at the position of insertion of the ball<br>
1102, which can be pushed into the socket 1104 by the spring 1106. The first housing<br>
102 is therefore held in place relative to the second, housing 104 as the bar linkages<br>
are coupled to them. Multiple sockets 604 can be used to define the relative<br>
positioning of the first housing 102 and the second housing 104 in the different<br>
configurations in which the electronic device 100 can be held. Examples of the<br><br>
different configurations include, but are not restricted to, the compact configuration,<br>
the portrait configuration, and the landscape configuration. The cam mechanism 1100<br>
can also allow the first housing 102 to be held in an intermediate configuration with<br>
respect to the second housing 104, depending on a desired functionality. For example,<br>
the electronic device may be operated in a camera mode, exposing a viewfinder and<br>
flash in the landscape configuration, while exposing only the viewfinder in an<br>
intermediate configuration. This can be useful, for example, when flash functionality<br>
is not desired.<br>
[0042] Various embodiments of the present disclosure, as described above, provide<br>
an electronic device that is suitable for operation in the compact configuration, the<br>
portrait configuration, and the landscape configuration. The use of the bar linkage can<br>
allow a reduction in the thickness of the electronic device by requiring only two<br>
housings, to allow for the configurations described earlier. The use of the bar linkage<br>
can also reduce the weight of the electronic device by removing the need for more<br>
than two housings, to allow for two degrees of freedom - along the length and the<br>
breadth. Further, the availability of the QWERTY keypad 302, when using the<br>
electronic device for text input, and the numeric keypad 202 when using it for<br>
numeric input, can make the electronic device more user-friendly.<br>
[0043] It will be appreciated the electronic device described herein may include of<br>
one or more conventional processors and unique stored program instructions that<br>
control the one or more processors to implement, in conjunction with certain non-<br>
processor circuits, some of the functions of the electronic device described herein.<br>
The non-processor circuits may include, but arc not limited to, a radio receiver, a<br>
radio transmitter, signal drivers, clock circuits, power source circuits, and user input<br>
devices.<br>
[0044] It is expected that one of ordinary skill, notwithstanding possibly significant<br>
effort and many design choices motivated by, for example, available time, current<br>
technology, and economic considerations, when guided by the concepts and principles<br>
disclosed herein will be readily capable of manufacturing a device in accordance with<br>
the description as set out above.<br><br>
[0045] In the foregoing specification, the disclosure and its benefits and advantages<br>
have been described with reference to specific embodiments. However, one of<br>
ordinary skill in the art appreciates that various modifications and changes can be<br>
made without departing from the scope of the present disclosure as set forth in the<br>
claims below. Accordingly, the specification and figures are to be regarded in an<br>
illustrative rather than a restrictive sense, and all such modifications are intended to be<br>
included within the scope of present disclosure. The benefits, advantages, solutions to<br>
