				<td>Ruthenium complexes with (F-P)-coordinated<br>
ferrocenyldiphosphine ligands, process £or preparing<br>
them, and their use in homogeneous catalysis<br>
Description<br>
The present invention relates to ruthenium complexes<br>
for homogeneous catalysis. In particular, the invention<br>
relates to ferrocene-containing, P-P-coordinated<br>
ruthenium complexes with chiral diphosphine ligands<br>
(known as ferrocenyldiphosphine ligands) and a process<br>
for preparing them. The invention further relates to<br>
the use of these complexes as catalysts for homogeneous<br>
catalytic hydrogenation.<br>
Chiral ferrocenyldiphosphines have proven to be<br>
valuable ligands for catalytically active metal<br>
complexes which are used in homogeneous catalysis for<br>
the enantioselective hydrogenation of organic<br>
conqpounds. Fields of use are the preparation of<br>
intermediates or active compounds, for example<br>
pharmaceuticals, pesticides, flavors or fragrances.<br>
Among the diphosphines having a ferrocene framework,<br>
l-sec-phosphino-2-(2'-sec-phosphino-1-benzyl)-<br>
ferrocenes, for excunple, have proven to be valuable<br>
ligands for noble metal complexes for the<br>
enantioselective hydrogenation of organic compounds.<br>
Ligands of this type are referred to by the name<br>
"Taniaphos" and are described in WO 00/37478. Further<br>
examples of diphosphines having a ferrocene framework<br>
are 1-(a-sec-phosphinoalkyl)-2-(sec-phosphinoaryl)-<br>
ferrocenes which are disclosed in WO 02/02578 (trivial<br>
neune "Walphos") .<br>
In enantioselective hydrogenation, these diphosphine<br>
ligands are used together with suitable noble metal<br>
complexes. The reaction of asymmetric ferrocenyl-<br>
diphosphine ligands with organometallic Ru con^ovinds<br>
leads to mixtures of complexes which have monodentate<br>
coordination of the P atoms of the phosphine ligand,<br>
cf. equ. (1):<br>
Equation (1) :<br><br>
According to equ. (1) , an isomer mixture of<br>
monodentate, P-coordinated Ru conplexes in which in<br>
each case, only one of the P atoms of the<br>
ferrocenyldiphosphine ligcuid is bound to the ruthenium<br>
is present. The two isomers in equation (1) can be<br>
distinsruished, for example, by means of ^^P-NMR<br>
spectroscopy. Simultaneous coordination of both P atoms<br>
of the ferrocenyldiphosphine ligand in a ruthenium<br>
coirplex (hereinafter referred to as "bidentate"<br>
coordination or "P-P coordination") has hitherto not<br>
been observed.<br>
Organometallic Ru conpounds used in these hydro-<br>
genations are, for example, [Ru(COD)y2]x- [Ru(NBD)Y2]x/<br>
[Ru(aromatic)Y2]x or [Ru(COD) (2-methylallyl) 2] (where X<br>
= 2; Y = halide, COD = 1,5-cyclooctadiene, NBD =<br>
norbornadiene, aromatic = for example, p-cumene or<br>
another benzene derivative).<br>
EP 1622920B1 discloses transition metal complexes with<br>
ferrocenyldiphosphine ligands. Complexes having<br>
specific P-P coordination of the phosphine ligands are<br>
not described, and in addition the diphosphine ligands<br>
disclosed have phosphine groups which are located on<br>
different ferrocene rings of the ligand system.<br><br>
Although WO 00/37478 describes transition metal<br>
complexes which contain a metal atom of transition<br>
group 7 or 8 and in which both P atoms of the<br>
ferrocenyldiphosphine ligand are simultaneously<br>
coordinated to the central atom, the complexes are<br>
neither isolated nor characterized. No process for<br>
preparing them is described; rather, the complexes are<br>
generated shortly before use by combining the ligands<br>
and the appropriate treinsition metal salts in the<br>
reaction solvent ("in situ") .<br>
These in-si tu processes are prior art. Thus,<br>
ferrocenyldiphosphine ligands are reacted with<br>
ruthenitim complexes in an in-situ procedure; cf.<br>
Angewandte Chemie 1999, 111, No. 21, 3397-3400. Here,<br>
[Ru(COD) (C4H7)2]HBr (COD = cycloocta-1,5-diene, C4H7 =<br>
2-(T|^-)methylallyl) is used as Ru complex and 3-keto<br>
esters of the type R-C0-CH2-CO-OEt are hydrogenated in<br>
ethcmol at 50°C under 50 bar of hydrogen. The seime Ru<br>
starting coitpound is used in Tetrahedron Asymmetry 1^<br>
(2004) 91-102 and the catalyst is prepared in situ.<br>
Adv, Synth. Catal. 2003, 345, 160-164 describes phenyl-<br>
ferrocenylethyldiphosphine ligands of the "Walphos"<br>
type. Dimeric [RUI2 (p-cvimene) ]2 is used as Ru-containing<br>
catalyst precursor in the hydrogenation and the<br>
catalyst is formed in situ.<br>
However, no studies on the structure of the metal<br>
complexes generated in situ have hitherto been carried<br>
out; the corresponding con^lexes were not isolated but<br>
used directly in the reaction mixture for homogeneous<br>
catalysis, in particular for catalytic hydrogenation.<br>
Disadvantages of the catalytic hydrogenation processes<br>
which have been described up to now and the catalysts<br>
used therein are, in particular, the low enantio-<br>
selectivities and a high consumption of noble metal<br>
catalysts, i.e. a low substrate/catalyst (S/C) ratio,<br>
and long hydrogenation times.<br>
It was therefore an object of the present invention to<br>
provide inproved catalysts for homogeneous, asymmetric<br>
hydrogenation.<br>
This object is achieved by provision of the rutheniiom<br>
complexes of the types (A) and (B) as claimed in<br>
claim 1 of the invention. Furthermore, a process for<br>
preparing the complexes of the invention is disclosed<br>
in claim 11. Preferred embodiments are described in the<br>
subordinate claims dependent thereon.<br>
The present invention describes ruthenium complexes<br>
with a chiral ferrocenyldiphosphine ligand for<br>
homogeneous catalysis, wherein the ruthenium has the<br>
oxidation state (+11) and the ferrocenyldiphosphine<br>
ligands have bidentate P-P coordination to the Ru. The<br>
ruthenium complexes are cyclic and with the<br>
ferrocenyldiphosphine ligaund have an at least eight-<br>
membered ring. The ferrocenyldiphosphine ligands are,<br>
for example, selected from the group consisting of<br>
"Taniaphos" and "Walphos' ligands, but are not<br>
restricted to these ligands.<br>
The present invention further provides a process for<br>
preparing the ruthenium complexes of the invention, in<br>
which specific Ru starting compounds are reacted with a<br>
chiral ferrocenyldiphosphine ligand.<br>
In the search for well-defined Ru complexes with<br>
ferrocenyldiphosphine ligands, it has surprisingly been found that simultaneous coordination of both P atoms of<br>
the ferrocenyldiphosphine ligands to a central Ru atom<br>
can be achieved under particular conditions. This gives<br>
cyclic Ru complexes which have an at least eight-<br><br>
membered ring in their structure (number of ring<br>
members r &gt; 8) .<br>
The effect of P-P coordination is obtained by use of<br>
specific ferrocenyldiphosphine ligands which have at<br>
least seven ring-forming atoms in their structure and<br>
are therefore sterically capable of forming an at least<br>
eight-membered ring with the central Ru atom. The<br>
phosphino groups are preferably located on one (i.e. on<br>
the Scune) cyclopentadienyl ring of the ferrocene<br>
molecule.<br>
Example of suitable ferrocenyldiphosphine ligands are<br>
ligands of the Taniaphos type and their derivatives,<br>
for exainple Taniaphos-OH or Taniaphos-OMe, etc.<br>
However, it is also possible to use ligands of the<br>
"Walphos" type. Examples of suitable ferrocenyl-<br>

the invention are:<br>

These chiral ferrocenyldiphosphine ligands are in most<br>
cases commercially available. Use of these ligands in<br>
the preparative process of the invention gives cyclic<br>
Ru coitplexes which have an eight-meihbered ring in their<br>
structure. However, other chiral ferrocenyldiphosphine<br>
ligands are also suitable as long as they allow<br>
formation of an at least eight-membered ring (number of<br>
ring members r &gt; 8).<br>
In the present preparative process, the effect of P-P<br>
coordination is achieved by use of specific Ru starting<br>
compounds which are present in the oxidation state<br>
(+11) and have at least two neutral 2-electron donor<br>
ligands Ld- They have the following general formula<br><br>
where<br>
Ru is in the oxidation state +11,<br>
n is an integer equal to or greater than 3,<br>
Lo is an neutral ligand,<br>
Z is at least one n-bonded organic ligand and<br>
E' is the anion of an oxo acid or complex acid.<br>
The at least three neutral ligands Ld generally belong<br>
to the class of 2-electron donor ligands such as<br>
secondary or tertiary phosphines or N-heterocyclic<br>
carbene ligands (knovm as NHC ligands). The ligands Ld<br>
are preferably solvent ligands which are bound to the<br>
central Ru atom. At least two of these ligands are<br>
replaced in the reaction by a chiral diphosphine<br>
ligand. Exanqples of suitable ligands Ld are ligands<br>
from the group consisting of alcohols, ethers, amines,<br>
acid eunides, lactams eind sulfones; for example<br>
acetonitrile (CH3CN). diethyl ether (DEE), water (H2O)<br>
or acetone. It is also possible to use cyclic ligands<br>
such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), dioxane, pyridine,<br>
imidazole or thiophene. Mixed systems having different<br>
types of ligands, for example ones containing phosphine<br>
ligands and/or carbene ligands and/or solvent ligands,<br>
are also possible.<br>
Furthermore, the Ru starting compound has at least one<br>
n-bonded organic ligand Z. Z encompasses substituted or<br>
unsubstituted cyclic or open-chain dienyl ligands in<br>
general, for example substituted or unsubstituted<br>
pentadienyl or heptadienyl ligands.<br>
For clarification, such dienyl ligands are, when bonded<br>
to the Ru, negatively charged, i.e. anionic.<br>
Preference is given to using 2,4-dimethylpentadiene,<br>
2,3,4-trimethylpentadiene, cycloheptadiene, cycloocta-<br>
diene, norbornadiene, etc. The ligeuids Z can also be<br>
present in the protonated state and have protons in an<br>
"agostic interaction*.<br>
Most preferably, for Z, one negatively charged open-<br>
/ chain dienyl ligand, for example 2,4-dimethyl-<br>
pentadienyl- or 2,3,4-trimethylpentadienyl- is<br>
employed.<br>
The Ru starting compound is present as cation having a<br>
single positive charge emd has, as further constituent<br>
E", the anion of an oxo acid or complex acid as<br>
counterion. Exaunples of E" are HSO4', CF3SO3', C104',<br>
BF4", B(aryl)4', SbF6' and PF6'.<br>
Examples of suitable Ru starting compounds are<br>
[Ru(2,4-dimethylpentadienyl) (CH3CN)3]*BF4' or [Ru(2,4-<br>
dimethylpentadienyl) (acetone) 3] *BF4*.<br>
The Ru starting compound can be prepared in various<br>
process steps from known Ru precursor compounds by<br>
reaction with the appropriate ligand LD, and isolated.<br>
The Ru precursor conpound can be protonated before<br>
reaction with the neutral ligand Ld in order to achieve<br>
improved ligand replacement by Ld-<br>
As Ru precursors, it is possible to use the compounds<br>
mentioned above, e.g. bis (?5-(2,4-dimethylpenta-<br>
dienyDRu, [Ru{COD)Cl2]2, [Ru(norbomadiene)Cl2]2,<br>
[Ru(p-cumene)l2]2 or [Ru{COD)(2-methylallyl)2]. These Ru<br>
compounds are commercially available. The preparation<br>
procedures for the Ru starting compound have to be<br>
adjusted depending on the precursor compound used.<br>
A preferred Ru precursor conprises negatively charged Z<br>
ligands, such as, for example, bis diS-(2,4-dimethyl-<br>
pentadienyDRu. The preparation of the Ru starting<br>
compoxmd typically proceeds in two steps:<br>
Step A (protonation):<br>
[Zi-Ru] + H* E =&gt; [Zz-Ru-H ]+ + E'<br><br>
step B (ligand exchange) :<br>
[Z2-Ru-H]+E- + dLd =&gt; [Z-Ru (LD)n r E" + Z-H<br>
It has been found that reaction of the Ru starting<br>
compounds with the appropriate chiral ferrocenyl-<br>
diphosphine ligands (hereinafter represented as<br>
P(l)-P(2) for short) gives the Ru complexes of the<br>
invention. The formation of the ferrocenyldiphosphine<br>
conplex then occurs in step C. The preparative process<br>
of the invention is shown in general form in equ. (2):<br>
The reaction of equ. (2) gives the novel Ru complexes<br>
of type (A) . To prepare the Ru complexes of type (A) ,<br>
the ferrocenyldiphosphine ligands are reacted with the<br>
above-described Ru starting compound, resulting in at<br>
least two of the ligands Ld being replaced by the<br>
chiral diphosphine ligands in the reaction. If the Ru<br>
starting compoiind has more than two ligands Ld, the<br>
remaining ligands Ld remain coordinated to the<br>
ruthenium. They can be replaced or eliminated in a<br>
subsequent step. The preparation of the Ru complexes is<br>
preferably carried out vmder a protective gas<br>
atmosphere using the Schlenk technique and oxygen-free<br>
solvents. The ferrocenyldiphosphine ligands are<br>
typically reacted with the Ru starting compound in a<br>
suitable solvent at temperatures in the range from 20<br>
to 80°C, preferably in the range from 20 to 60°C and<br>
particularly preferably at room temperature (25°C) ,<br>
while stirring. Suitable solvents are chlorinated<br><br>
hydrocarbons such as chloroform, methylene chloride,<br>
trichloroethane or dichloroethane. The reaction times<br>
range from 1 hour to 10 hours. It can be advantageous<br>
to use the ligand in a small excess in the preparation<br>
of the Ru complexes. The excess can be in the range<br>
from 1 to 10 mol% (based on the Ru starting compound) .<br>
The subsequent isolation, washing and purification<br>
steps are well known to those skilled in the art. To<br>
remove solvent residues, the product is dried under<br>
reduced pressure.<br>
In a further embodiment, the present invention<br>
encompases Ru complexes of type (B) . These complexes<br>
bear no net charge and have a negatively charged ligand<br>
Lz in addition to the P-P-coordinated ferrocenyl-<br>
diphosphine ligand, the n-bonded organic ligand Z and,<br>
if appropriate, the ligcuid Ld-<br>
This ligand Lz can be introduced by replacement of one<br>
of the ligands Ld by a halide ion (fluoride, chloride,<br>
bromide or iodide) or a pseudohalide ion (e.g. CN",<br>
SCN', cyanate, isocyanate, etc.). The Ru complex of<br>
type (B) is preferably prepared from the complex of<br>
type (A) by subsequent ligand exchange, for example by<br>
replacement of an acetonitrile molecule by iodide (cf.<br>
example 2):<br>
Step D (replacement of the ligand Ld by negatively<br>
charged ligands Lz) according to equ. (3).<br>
To carry out step D, the cationic Ru complex (type A)<br>
is dissolved in a dipolar, aprotic solvent, for example<br>
acetone or THF, and reacted with ligand Lz at<br>
temperatures in the range from 20 to 50°C. The product<br>
generally precipitates and can be separated off.<br>
The novel Ru complexes of type (A)<br>
where, in each case,<br>
Ru is in the oxidation state +11,<br>
n is an integer equal to or greater than 3,<br>
Ld is an neutral ligand,<br>
Z is at least one n-bonded organic ligand,<br>
E" is an anion of an oxo acid or complex acid and<br>
Lz is at least one anionic ligand<br>
and the ferrocenyldiphosphine ligand P(l)-P(2) has<br>
bidentate P-P coordination, are effective homogeneous<br>
catalysts for the asymmetric hydrogenation of prochiral<br>
organic confounds.<br>
They are therefore used as catalysts for homogeneous<br>
asymmetric catalysis, for exanple for the enantio-<br>
selective hydrogenation of multiple bonds. For the<br>
purposes of the present invention, multiple bonds are<br>
double bonds between a carbon atom and a further carbon<br>
atom (C=C) or oxygen atom (C=0) or nitrogen atom (C=N).<br>
Furthermore, the ruthenium complexes of the invention<br>
can also be used as catalysts for other asymmetric<br>
reactions. These include C-C, C-0, C-N, C-P, C-Si, C-B<br>
or C-halogen bond formation reactions. Examples are<br>
asynmietric cyclization reactions, asymmetric oligo-<br>
merizations and asymmetric polymerization reactions.<br>
The novel Ru complexes of type (A) and (B) are used as<br>
defined compounds and display, for example, very good<br>
catalytic properties in hydrogenation. In comparison,<br>
Ru complexes which only have single, monodentate<br>
coordination of the P atoms of the<br>
ferrocenyldiphosphine ligands or Ru compounds which are<br>

is observed. Signals of a noncoordinated P atom are not<br>
found.<br>
The complex according to the invention gives vejry good<br>
yields when used as catalyst for enantioselective<br>

Example 2<br>
Preparation of (ti5-2,4-dliiisthylpentadienyl) (iodo)-<br>
(Taniaphos TOOl-1)ruthenium(II)<br>
The Taniaphos complex (115-2,4-dimethylpentadienyl)-<br>

borate is prepared as described in exeuttple Ic) . 100 mg<br>
of this compoiind are dissolved in 4 ml of acetone, an<br>
excess of 2 equivalents of potassium iodide (80 mg) is<br>
added and the mixture is stirred at room temperature<br>
for 10 hours. The precipitated solid is filtered off<br>
and washed firstly with water and then with cold<br>
acetone. This gives a mixture of two diastereomers<br>
having a de of 60% as a yellow-orange solid in a yield<br>
of 85%.<br>

mm (d, Jpp = 40.5 Hz). MS (FAB) m/e: 1012 [M*+l] , 884<br>
[M*-I], 788 [M*-I-pentadienyl] . The P-P coordination<br>
according to the invention is evidenced by the fact<br>
that only 2 P signals having chemical shifts which are<br>
relatively close together (6: 39.88 ppm and 29.96 ppm)<br>
occur in the ¦'^P NMR and a coupling of 40.5 Hz between<br>
P(l) and P(2) is observed.<br>
Use for catalytic hydrogenation:<br>
The (Taniaphos TOOl-1)(iodo)ruthenium(II) complex<br>
prepared as described in example 2 is used for the<br>
asyimnetric hydrogenation of trans-2-methyl-2-butenoic<br>
acid. The hydrogenation is carried out in an autoclave<br>
under 50 bar of hydrogen; solvent: methanol;<br>
ten^erature: 50°C. A little methanolic HCl is added.<br>
After a reaction time of 18 hours, the hydrogen<br>
pressure is vented. Analysis of the crude material<br>
indicates a conversion of &gt; 90% and an enantiomeric<br>
excess (ee) of &gt; 40%. The substrate/catalyst ratio<br>
(S/C) is &gt; 500.<br>
The complex according to the invention thus gives very<br>
good results when used as catalyst for enantioselective<br>
catalytic hydrogenation.<br>
Exanple 3<br>
Preparation of (T]5-2,4-diinethylpentadieny-l) (lodo)-<br>
(Tanlaphos "OH) rutheniua (II)<br>
In a round-bottom flask provided with a magnetic<br>
stirrer, the acetonitrile complex (ti5-2, 4-diraethyl-<br>
pentadienyl) (CH3CN)3ruthenivun{II) tetraf luoroborate<br>
prepared as described in example lb) (288 mg,<br>
0.71 iranol] is dissolved in 15 ml of methylene chloride<br>
and stirred with (S, S)-Taniaphos-OH (288 mg, 0.71 mmol)<br>
at room tenperature for 3 hours. The solution becomes<br>
deep red. The solvent is removed under reduced pressure<br>
and the residue is washed with diethyl ether. The<br>
(Taniaphos-OH)ruthenium(II) tetrafluoroborate complex<br>
obtained is not isolated further but dissolved in 20 ml<br>
of acetone. Excess potassium iodide (33 0 mg, 2 mmol) is<br>
added and the solution is stirred for a further<br>
10 hours. The precipitated yellow-orange solid is<br>
filtered off and washed with water and acetone. This<br>
gives a product comprising a mixture of two<br>
diastereomers in a virtually equimolar ratio. Yield:<br>
90%. The P-P coordination of the Taniaphos-OH ligand is<br>
evidenced by the ^^P-NMR.<br>
The Ru complex gives good yields when used as catalyst<br>
for enantioselective catalytic hydrogenation.<br>
CoMparative <mcmiple></mcmiple>
Preparation of an Ru coanplex with P-monocoordinated<br>
£erroce]^ldiplioaphine ligaads<br>
The reaction of Taniaphos SL-TOOl-1 with the<br>
commercially available ruthenivim complex [RuCl2(p-<br>
cumene)]2 (from Umicore, Hanau) in THF at room<br>
teit^perature gives, in accordance with equ. (1), a 2:1<br><br>
mixture of two Isomers which were identified as<br>
P-monocoordinated complexes by means of '^P<br>
spectroscopy. The spectrum displays four different<br>
signals (•'^P NMR in CD2CI2: 5 = 49 ppm and -13 ppm for<br>
the isomer present in the lesser amount, 5 = 35 ppm and<br>
-15 ppm for the predominant isomer) . Here, the signals<br>
having a negative chemical shift (5 = -13 ppm and<br>
-15 ppm) can be assigned to the noncoordinated P atoms<br>
of the ligand in each case.<br>
When the mixture is refluxed for 2 hours, the isomer<br>
which is present in the predominant proportion is<br>
formed; isolation is effected by precipitation with<br>
hexane. Bidentate P-P coordination of the ferrocenyl-<br>
diphosphine ligand is not observed.<br>
Use for catalytic hydrogenation:<br>
The Ru complex mixture prepared as described in<br>
con^jarative example 1 is used for the asymmetric<br>
hydrogenation of treins-2-methyl-2-butenoic acid. The<br>
hydrogenation is carried out in an autoclave lander<br>
50 bar of hydrogen; solvent: methanol; tenperature:<br>
50°C. A little methanolic HCl is added. After a<br>
reaction time of 18 hours, the hydrogen pressure is<br>
vented. Analysis of the crude material indicates<br>
incomplete reaction and an ee of 
substrate/catalyst ratio (S/C) is 200.<br>
These results can be compared with the results of<br>
exeuiple 2. They demonstrate the superiority of the Ru<br>
complexes of the invention having P-P coordination of<br>
the ferrocenyldiphosphine ligands in the asyiranetric<br>
hydrogenation of chiral organic confounds.<br>
