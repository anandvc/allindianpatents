				<td>Process for the production of anilines<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the amination of ortho-bicyclopropyl-substituted halobenzenes and also to intermediates of that process.<br>
Ortho-bicydopropyl-substituted primary anilines such as, for example, 2-bicyclopropyl-2-yl-phenylamine are valuable intermediates for the preparation of fungicides such as those described, for example, in WO 03/074491.<br>
In general terms, anilines can be prepared from halobenzenes by means of palladium-catalysed cross-coupling reactions. Such palladium-catalysed cross-coupling reactions are described in the following summary articles: Handbook of Organopalladium Chemistry for Organic Synthesis, Vol. 1,1051-1096,2002; Journal of Organometallic Chemistry, 576,125-146,1999 and Journal of Organometallic Chemistry, 653,69-82,2002. The basic disadvantage of palladium-catalysed cross-coupling is that direct preparation of primary anilines is not possible.<br>
Therefore, when using palladium-catalysed cross-coupling, primary anilines have to prepared   -from the corresponding halobenzenes in synthesis procedures comprising at least two stages.<br>
Such a two-stage process for the preparation of ortho-bicyclopropyl-substituted primary anilines, using imines as nucleophiles, is described in WO 03/074491 (see Scheme 1).<br>
Scheme 1:<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
According to WO 03/074491, substituted 2-(2-halophenyl)cyclopropanes of formula (A), wherein Hal is bromine or iodine and R3 is, inter alia, unsubstituted or substituted cyclopropyl, are aminated in a two-stage reaction to form the corresponding 2-(2-aminophenyl)cyclopropanes (C). For that purpose, firstly benzophenoneimine, sodium tert-butanolate, tris(dibenzylidene-acetone)dipalladium (Pd2dba3) and racemic 2,2'-bis(diphenylphosphine)-1,1'-binaphthyl ("BINAP") are added. In the second reaction step, the resulting imines (B) are reacted with, for example, hydroxylamine and sodium acetate to form the corresponding 2-(2-aminophenyl)bicyclopropanes (C). As a further palladium ligand, 1,1'-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene ("dppf") is proposed in WO 03/074491.<br>
This reaction procedure is described in WO 03/074491 exclusively for bromo- or iodo-benzenes, not for chlorobenzenes. It has been found that the reaction procedure described in WO 03/074491 is poorly suited to the imination of the less reactive but more economically priced 2-(2-chlorophenyl)cyclopropanes in high yields.<br>
The reaction procedure described in WO 03/074491 for the preparation of primary anilines is not suitable for the large-scale preparation of ortho-bicyclopropyl-substituted primary anilines because of the high cost of the benzophenoneimine.<br>
The problem of the present invention is accordingly to provide a new process for the preparation of ortho-bicyclopropyl-substituted primary anilines which avoids the above-mentioned disadvantages of the known process and makes it possible to prepare those compounds at economically reasonable cost and in easily manageable manner in high yields and good quality.<br>
 The present invention accordingly relates to a process for the preparation of compounds of formula I<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R1, R2 and R3 are each independently of the others hydrogen or C1-C4alkyl, which process comprises<br>
a)	reacting a compound of formula II<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R1, R2 and R3 are as defined for formula I and X is bromine or chlorine, with a compound of formula III<br>

herein R4 is hydrogen or C1-C4alkyl, in the presence of a base and catalytic amounts of at least one palladium complex compound, to form a compound of formula IV<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R1, R2, R3 and R4 are each independently of the others hydrogen or C1-C4alkyl; and<br>
b)	converting that compound, using a reducing agent, into the compound of formula I.<br>
Compounds of formula I occur in various stereoisomeric forms, which are described in formulae l(l In, L and 1^:<br>
The process according to the invention includes the preparation of those stereoisomeric forms of formulae l(, In, hn and \N, wherein R1 R2 and R3 are as defined for formula I, and the preparation of mixtures of those stereoisomeric forms in any ratio.<br>
The process according to the invention is suitable preferably for the preparation of compounds of formula I wherein RI is hydrogen or C1-C4alkyl and R2 and R3 are hydrogen.<br>
The process according to the invention is suitable preferably for the preparation of compounds of formula I wherein Rt is hydrogen or methyl and R2 and R3 are hydrogen.<br>

Palladium complex compounds which are used in process step (a) are formed from a palladium precursor and at least one suitable ligand. In process step (a), the palladium complex complexes are preferably present in dissolved form as palladium-ligand complexes.<br>
In the context of the present invention, palladium complex compounds are expressly understood to include compounds consisting of cyclic organic palladium compounds, the so-called "palladacycles", and secondary phosphines.<br>
The palladium complex compounds may be used as already formed complex compounds in process step (a) or are formed in situ in process step (a).<br>
In order to form palladium complex compounds, a palladium precursor is reacted with at least one suitable ligand. In the event of incomplete reaction, it can be the case that minor amounts of palladium precursor or of ligand do not dissolve in the reaction mixture.<br>

Suitable ligands are tertiary phosphine ligands, N-heterocyclic carbene ligands or phosphinic acid ligands.<br>
In the context of the present invention, tertiary phosphine ligands are sub-divided into monodentate tertiary phosphine ligands and bidentate tertiary phosphine ligands. A "monodentate ligand" is understood to be a ligand able to occupy one co-ordination site of the palladium centre.

The compounds of formula IV are valuable intermediates for the preparation of compounds of formula I and have been developed specifically for the present process according to the invention. The present invention accordingly relates also thereto.<br>
The present invention will be explained in greater detail using the following Examples:<br>
Example PI: Preparation of benzyl(2-bicyclopropyl-2-yl-phenyl)amine: 3 g of 2-(2-chlorophenyl)bicyclopropyl (15.6 mmol, trans/cis ratio of about 2:1), 2.5 g of benzylamine (23.4 mmol), 2.4 g of sodium tert-butanolate (25 mmol), 35 mg of Pd(ll) acetate (0.16 mmol) and 60 mg of R(-)-di-fert-butyl-[1-[(S)-2-(dicyclohexylphosphanyl)-ferrocenyl]ethyl]phosphine (0.11 mmol) are dissolved in 30 ml of dimethoxyethane. The reaction mixture is heated to the reflux temperature of the solvent and is stirred for 24 hours. After cooling, ethyl acetate is added and the organic phase is washed with water. The solvent is removed using a water jet vacuum and the residue is dried. The product is purified by column chromatography on silica gel (eluant: ethyl acetate/hexane 1:15). 3.58 g of benzyl(2-bicyclopropyl-2-yl-phenyl)amine (87 % of theory) are obtained in the form of a brown oil (trans/cis ratio of about 2:1).<br>
Example P2: Preparation of benzyl(2-bicyclopropyl-2-yl-phenyl)amine: 3.7 g of 2-(2-bromophenyl)bicyclopropyl (15.6 mmol, trans/cis ratio of about 3:1), 2.0 g of benzylamine (18.7 mmol), 2.1 g of sodium tert-butanolate (21.8 mmol), 3.5 mg of Pd(ll) acetate (0.016 mmol) and 8.6 mg of R(-)-di-/ert-butyl-[1-[(S)-2-(dicyclohexylphosphanyl)-ferrocenyljethyljphosphine (0.016 mmol) are dissolved in 30 ml of dimethoxyethane. The reaction mixture is heated to 70°C and stirred for 24 hours. After cooling, ethyl acetate is added. The organic phase is washed with water. The solvent is removed using a water jet vacuum and the residue is dried. The product is purified by column chromatography on silica gel (eluant: ethyl acetate/hexane 1:15). 3.47 g of benzyl(2-bicyclopropyl-2-yl-phenyl)amine (84 % of theory) are obtained in the form of a brown oil (trans/cis ratio of about 3:1).<br>
Example P3: Preparation of 2-bicyclopropyl-2-yl-phenylamine: 1 g of benzyl(2-bicyclopropyl-2-yl-phenyl)amine (3.8 mmol, trans/cis ratio of about 3:1) is dissolved in 15 ml of absolute tetrahydrofuran. Then 50 mg of Pd (5 %) on activated carbon are added. Hydrogenation is then carried out, with stirring, for 1 hour at room temperature. After completion of the reaction, the catalyst is filtered off and the solvent is removed using a water jet vacuum. The product is purified by chromatography on silica gel (eluant: ethyl acetate/hexane 1/15). 0.61 g of 2-bicyclopropyl-2-ylphenylamine (92 % of theory) is obtained in the form of a brownish liquid (trans/cis ratio of about 3:1).<br>

As a result of the provision of the present invention, it is possible to aminate ortho-bicyclopropyl-substituted halobenzenes in high yields and with little outlay.<br>
The starting compounds of the process of the present invention are distinguished by being readily accessible and easily handled and, in addition, they are economically priced.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the process according to the invention, the palladium used in the process is-recycled. This embodiment constitutes a variant of the process according to the invention which is especially interesting from an economic point of view.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, compounds of formula II wherein X is chlorine are used. The starting compounds of this preferred embodiment of the process of the invention are distinguished by being especially readily accessible and by their especially economical price. This embodiment accordingly constitutes a variant of the process of the process according to the invention which is especially interesting from an economic point of view.<br>
It is known, however, that, under the conditions of palladium-catalysed cross-coupling, this class of starting compounds, the deactivated chlorobenzene substrates, are especially difficult to aminate because of the extremely low reactivity of the chlorine leaving group, compared to deactivated bromobenzene substrates.<br>
In addition, the yield is generally further reduced when using a primary alkylamine nucleophile having a hydrogen atom in the p position such as, for example, the compounds of formula III. This is due, firstly, to the subsidiary reaction of P elimination within the alkylamine nucleophile to form the imine, an unsubstituted aryl being formed from the aryl<br>
halide substrate. Secondly, when using primary amine nucleophiles it is also necessary to take into account the follow-on reaction of further amination to the secondary arylamine, which can reduce the yield of the desired primary arylamines.<br>
The amination of deactivated, electron-rich chlorobenzene substrates with primary alkylamine nucleophiles which have a hydrogen atom in the p position is therefore regarded as being extremely difficult because of the reduced reactivity and because of the subsidiary and follow-on reactions. Those difficulties are pointed out, for example, in the above-mentioned summary articles.<br>
It has been found, surprisingly, that palladium complex compounds having at least one ligand selected from an N-heterocydic carbene ligand, a monodentate tertiary phosphine ligand and a bidentate tertiary phosphine ligand which is selected from a ferrocenyl biphosphine ligand and an aminophosphine ligand are especially suitable for the amination of compounds of formula II wherein X is chlorine.<br>
For that reason, for the formation of the palladium complex compound preference is given to the use of at least one ligand selected from an N-heterogyclic carbene ligand, a monodentate tertiary phosphine ligand and a bidentate tertiary phosphine ligand which is selected from a ferrocenyl biphosphine ligand and an aminophosphine ligand.<br>
Preference is given to the use of palladium complex compounds which comprise at least one ligand selected from tri-tert-butyl-phosphine, P(tBu)3HBF4, P(tBu)2BiPh, P(Cy)2BiPh, x-Phos, Josiphos 1, racemic Josiphos 1, Josiphos 2, racemic Josiphos 2, PCy2NMe2BiPh and l-Pr.<br>
Tables 4 and 5 describe yields of the amination reaction of chlorobenzenes.<br>
Table 4:         Yields of the amination reaction of chlorobenzenes A mixture of 100 mg of 2-(2-chlorophenyl)bicyclopropyl (0.5 mmol), 0.085 ml of benzylamine (0.78 mmol), 8 mg of sodium terf-butanolate (0.83 mmolj, 1.2 mg of Pd(ll) acetate (0.005 mmol, 1 mol %) and 0.0035 mmol (0.69 mol %) of ligand is prepared. 3 ml of dimethoxyethane are added and stirring is carried out at 90°C for 16 hours. After cooling, 2.5 ml of ethyl acetate and 3 ml of water are added and the organic phase is extracted. The<br>
identity of the reaction product benzyl(2-bicyclopropyl-2-yl-phenyl)amine and its yield are determined by means of gas chromatography.<br>

The palladium complex compounds are prepared using processes known from the literature and are added as already formed palladium complex compounds directly to the reaction mixture. 3 ml of dimethoxyethane are added and stirring is carried out at 90°C for 16 hours. After cooling, 2.5 ml of ethyl acetate and 3 ml of water are added and the organic phase is extracted. The identity of the reaction product benzyl(2-bicyclopropyl-2-yl-phenyl)amine and its yield are determined by means of gas chromatography.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
In an especially preferred embodiment of the invention, there are used palladium complex compounds having at least one ligand selected from an N-heterocyclic carbene ligand, a monodentate tertiary phosphine ligand and a bidentate aminophosphine ligand.<br>
In this especially preferred embodiment of the invention, compounds of formula II wherein X is chlorine can be reacted with small amounts of palladium complex compounds whilst maintaining high yields. As a result, the costs for the catalyst are substantially reduced. This embodiment accordingly constitutes a variant of the process according to the invention which is very especially interesting from an economic point of view.<br>
This especially preferred embodiment of the present invention makes it possible to use ligands in a ratio of from 1:10 000 to 1:200 relative to compounds of formula II (or from 0.01 mol % to 0.5 mol % in relation to compounds of formula II), whilst maintaining high yields.<br>
In Angewandte Chemie International Edition, 44,1371-1375,2005, it is described that Josiphos 1 is suitable as a ligand for reactions of ortho-methyl-substituted chlorobenzenes, using the ligand in a range of from 1:1000 to 1:10 000 relative to compounds of formula II. Yields of 97 % when using Josiphos 1 in a ratio of 1:1000 relative to compounds of formula II and of 98 % when using Josiphos 1 in a ratio of 1:10 000 are described therein. The mentioned reactions were carried out in a glovebox under a nitrogen atmosphere. A reaction in a glovebox points to extremely sensitive reactants/catalysts. For large-scale production operations, as are generally necessary in agrochemistry, glovebox processes do not constitute economically viable preparation processes.<br>
It was moreover found that this property of the ligand Josiphos 1 which was found in the glovebox process cannot be readily transferred from the ortho-methyl-substituted chlorobenzenes to ortho-bicyclopropyl-substituted chlorobenzenes. Instead it was found, when using Josiphos 1, even at amounts of ligand of 1:700 relative to compounds of formula II, that the yield is reduced to 39 % (see Table 6). Similar yields were also found when using Josiphos 2.<br>
It has been found, surprisingly, that some palladium complex compounds are especially suitable for this embodiment of the present invention (see Tables 6 and 7).<br>

After cooling, 2.5 ml of ethyl acetate and 3 ml of water are added and the organic phase is extracted. The identity of the reaction product benzyl(2-bicyclopropyl-2-yl-phenyl)amine and its yield are determined by means of gas chromatography.<br>
