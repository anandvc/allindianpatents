Field of the invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a herbal formulation comprising the synergistic combination of fiber/powder/granules of the aerial parts of at least two plants selected from the group comprising of Hemedesmus indicus, Acorus calamus, Murraya Koenigii, Alpinia galanga, Papaver somniferum, Amorphophallus campanulatus, Hygrophila auriculata, Hygrophila schulli, Cuminum cyminum, Apium graveolens, Colocasia esculenta along with one or more flavoring agents selected from essential/aromatic oils. More particularly, it relates to the use of the said formulation in formulated products such as bidis and cigarettes/ snuffs/ chewing gums.<br>
Background   and prior art of the invention:<br>
For the joy of living, medicated smoke should become a part of the daily routine. When used as therapy, the smoke is inhaled through the nose for head and neck disease, and through the mouth for throat disorders. The potential advantages of delivering a drug to the lung by inhalation have been well known to physicians and drug abusers for years. For drugs that exert their biological effect in the lung, these include rapid onset of action, reduced dose and minimized side effects compared to the same drug delivered by mouth. First line asthma therapy is currently based on inhaled corticosteroids which minimize the problems associated with oral steroids, such as adrenal suppression, electrolyte imbalance and muscle weakness. Tobacco smoke has been used in western culture for more than 400 years; human inhalation of cigarette smoke is a twentieth century phenomenon with major medical and economic consequences. However, excessive smoking is now recognized as one of the major health problems throughout the world. The most important difficulty results from the fact that heavy smokers are dependent on nicotine, which is considered to be one of the risk factors in tobacco smoke. During the combustion of tobacco the important risk factors formed such as carbon monoxide, tar products, aldehydes and hydrocyanic acid (US patent 5335678). US patent 20040103908 describes the herbal cigarette free from the existing tobacco cigarettes contains a predetermined mixture of different herbs packed in the filtered or non-filtered<br>

Example 2<br>
Blood pressure recording<br>
Blood pressure (Systolic and diastolic) and pulse rate were recorded after 1st and 2n week smoke exposure using a tail cuff blood pressure recorder (UGO Basile, Model no 58500; Comerio-varese, Italy). Rats were acclimatized to heating chamber (29-30 oC) for 30 min before recording the blood pressure (between 8. 30 and 10.30 AM), in order to cause a sufficient vasodilatation in the caudal artery. Three recordings were measured for each rat and the average was calculated.<br>
Table 1: Body weight, systolic, diastolic pressure and pulse rate of smoke exposure<br>
in rats<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The result explains that there is a change in the vital parameters on the blood pressure and pulse rate. This may be due to the reduction in the intake of the food during the course of exposure of the smoke. Table 2: Body weight, systolic, diastolic pressure and pulse rate of smoke exposure<br>
in rats<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The result explains that there is no significant change in the vital parameters on the blood<br>
pressure and pulse rate. However, there is a tendency in reduction of the body weight.<br>
This may be due to the reduction in the intake of the food during the course of exposure of the smoke.<br>
