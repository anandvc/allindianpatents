				<td>GRANULES COMPRISING A β-LACTAM ANTIBIOTIC<br>
The present invention relates to granules comprising a β-lactam antibiotic, to a process for the preparation thereof and to an apparatus for preparing the granules comprising the β-lactam antibiotic.<br>
The preparation of a β-lactam antibiotic typically involves obtaining the β-lactam antibiotic as a crystalline powder, e.g. by crystallizing the β-lactam antibiotic from a solution, and drying the resulting crystals resulting in the powder. When improved physical properties are desired, e.g. bulk density or flowability, the powder may be compressed, e.g. by roller compacting to form granules comprising compressed powder. Roller compacting of a β-lactam antibiotic is e.g. described in WO-A-9911261.<br>
It was found that the known process for the preparation of granules comprising a β-lactam antibiotic in compressed form results in a product having an unpleasant smell. It is an object of the invention to provide granules comprising having no smell or a smell that is at least less intensive.<br>
This object is achieved by providing granules comprising a β-lactam antibiotic,<br>
wherein CH2s(72h) 
Preferably, the granules comprising a β-lactam antibiotic according to the invention, have a CH2s(72h)  1 μl of H2S gas per kg of β-lactam antibiotic.<br><br>
As used herein CH2s(72h) is determined under the following conditions: a sample of between 3.5 and 4.5 gram of said granules is kept in a closed container (volume of 20 ml) at a temperature of 22 °C during 72 hours at atmospheric pressure (1 bar). After said 72 hours a sample of air is taken from the container and analysed by gas chromatography to determine the volume fraction of H2S in said sample of air. Said volume fraction of H2S gas is multiplied by the gas phase volume above the sample (i.e. volume of the container, i.e. 20 ml, minus the volume of the sample) resulting in the volume of H2S gas in the container. The calculated value of said volume of H2S gas in the container is divided by the weight of the sample, resulting in CH2S(72H).<br>
The invention also provides granules comprising a β-lactam antibiotic, wherein CH2s(3h) 
In the latter aspect of the invention, the CH2s(3h) is determined under the following conditions: a sample of between 3.5 and 4.5 gram of said granules is kept in a closed container (volume of 20 ml) at a temperature of 22 °C during 3 hours at atmospheric pressure (1 bar). After said 3 hours a sample of air is taken from the container and analysed by gas chromatography to determine the volume fraction of H2S in said sample of air. Said volume fraction of H2S gas is multiplied by the gas phase volume above the sample (i.e. volume of the container, i.e. 20 ml, minus the volume of the sample) resulting in the volume of H2S gas in the container. The calculated value of said volume of H2S gas in the container is divided by the weight of the sample, resulting in CH2s(3h).<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the invention provides granules comprising a β-lactam antibiotic, wherein CH2s(3h)

EXAMPLES Materials<br>
In comparative experiment A and example 1, cephalexin was prepared and recovered using the process as described in WO-A-9623796. The cephalexin (monohydrate) crystals obtained were washed with water and subsequently with a water-acetone mixture containing 80 vol.% of acetone. The resulting wet cake contained 8 wt.% of free water and 8 wt.% of acetone,<br>
In addition one sample of cephalexin granules in comparative experiment A was obtained from company A.<br>
In comparative experiment B, a sample of granules of cephradin was obtained from company B.<br>
In example 2, cephradine was prepared and recovered according to the method as described in WO 2005/003367, using PenG acylase mutant Phe-24-Ala. The cephradine, hydrate crystals obtained, were washed with water and subsequently with a water-acetone mixture containing 80 vol.% of acetone. The resulting wet cake contained 8 wt.% of free water and 8 wt.% of acetone.<br>
Comparative experiment A<br>
The cephalexin wet cake was dried using a Vacuum Paddle dryer type SH V-3000 supplied by Bachiller S.A., Spain. The dryer was charged with 600 kg cephalexin wet cake produced as described above, containing 8 wt.% of free water and 8 wt% of acetone. The walls were heated at a temperature of 70 °C (product temperature 40 °C). The final pressure was 20 mbar. During drying the wet cake was stirred at a speed of 7 rpm. After 2 hours and 40 minutes of drying the product was discharged. The water content was 5.2 wt.% (Karl Fisher).<br><br>
The resulting powder, having a temperature between 20-25 °C, was fed to a roller compactor produced by Hosokawa-Bepex, type K200/1 00 operated at a roller speed of 12 rpm and a roller pressure of 1 30 KN. The resulting compacted product was crushed to obtain granules having a bulk density above 0.45 g/ml and a tapped density above 0.75 g/ml. The densities were determined using method Eur. Ph. 5.0, section 2.9.15 (with the difference that a 100 ml cylinder was used).<br>
The resulting product was analysed for the H2S content using a HP 6890 gas chromatograph, and a Supelco SPB-1 sulfur, 30 m x 0.32 mm x 4.00 urn column. 3 reference experiments were carried using gases containing known volume concentrations of H2S in N2: (0.5 vol ppm, 1 .5 ppm, and 5.6 ppm). Using these reference experiments, a calibration curve was constructed.<br>
A.1. Determination CH2s(3h)<br>
After this the CH2s(3h) of the cephalexin granules was determined.<br>
A sample (4.04 gram), was introduced into a vial having a volume of 20 ml. The sample was equilibrated at ambient temperature (22 °C) for 3 hours. After said 3 hours a sample of air (300 μl injection volume) from the vial was analysed. The H2S vol ppm in said sample was 3.2 ppm. The volume of the gas phase above the sample was 14.5 ml (i.e. sample volume was 5.5 ml). Hence, CH2s(3h) = 11 μI of H2S gas per kg of β-lactam antibiotic. This experiment was repeated 3 times, resulting in an average value for ) of 1 0 μl of H2S gas per kg of β-lactam antibiotic.<br>
A.2. Determination CH2s(72h) of cephalexin granules from company A<br>
The CH2s(72h) of cephalexin granules from company A was determined by weighing a sample of 3.5 to 4.5 g of the cephalexin granules into a vial of 20 ml. The H2S content was analysed as described above under § A.1., with the difference that the sample was equilibrated at an ambient temperature for 72 h. The average value for CH2s(72h) of cephalexin granules from company A was 73 μl of H2S gas per kg of β-lactam antibiotic.<br><br>
Example 1<br>
Comparative experiment A was repeated with the difference that the powder was cooled after drying.<br>
A cooler (Vertical conical mixer, type MCV-3000-N, produced by Bachiller S.A.) was charged with 550 kg cephalexin powder. The wall temperature of the mixer was kept at a temperature of 5 °C. The cephalexin was cooled in the cooler under mixing during 2 hours until a product temperature of just below 1 5 °C was achieved.<br>
1.1. Determination<br>
The resulting powder was roller compacted as described above, and the of the thus pepared cephalexin granules was determined. Due to the cooling the smell of the resulting product was significantly less intensive.<br>
1.2. Determination<br>
In addition, the CH2s(72h) of the cephalexin granules as prepared under § 1.1 was determined. A sample of 3.5 to 4.5 g of the cephalexin granules was analysed for the H2S content according to the method as described under comparative experiment A.2., wherein the sample was equilibrated at ambient temperature (22 °C) for 72 h. The average value for CH2s(72h) was 21 μl of H2S gas per kg of β-lactam antibiotic.<br>
Comparative experiment B<br>
The CH2s(72h) of cephradine granules from competitor B was determined. A sample of 3.5 to 4.5 g of cephradine granules from competitor B was analysed for the H2S content according to the method as described under comparative experiment A, wherein the sample was equilibrated at ambient temperature for 72 h. The average value for CH2s(72h) of cephradine granules from competitor B was 28 μl of H2S gas per kg of β-lactam antibiotic.<br><br>
Examples<br>
The cephradine wet cake was dried and compacted according to the method as described under comparative experiment A with the difference that after drying the product was cooled as described in Example 1 . Subsequently, the CH2s(72h) was determined as described under comparative experiment A.2. The average value for was 1 8 μl of H2S gas per kg of β-lactam antibiotic.<br>
The results in Examples 1 to 2 show that cooling before compacting results in reduced concentrations of H2S.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
