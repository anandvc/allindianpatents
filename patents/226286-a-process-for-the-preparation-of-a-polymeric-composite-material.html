				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to fabric based polymeric materials, (hereafter referred as "material") made from a single polymer. Thus the materials of the present invention, which may he in the form of a composite, are made from different or same forms of a single polymer. The materials composites of the present invention are made from fibre and film of a single polymer, from fibre and fibre of single polymer, from film and flat tape of single polymer or still further from fibre and flat tape of single polymer. A single polymer, herein, is considered as one having at least 85% of the same repeat unit.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Polymeric materials are known to be used in a variety of ways, such as plastics, fibres, rubbers etc. The combination of these various forms of polymers are known to be used with certain advantages, but limited to a possibility of combination of same or different forms of different polymers.<br>
A typical example of a material made from the same form but different, polymer known in the art i« that<br>
of fabric of high density polyethylene laminated with low density polyethylene film used in the making of<br>
woven tracks.<br>
Yet. another known material is chopped high performance polyethylene fibre or HPPE fibre, processed with low density polyethylene or LDPE chips. This known polymeric material is made from different polymers having different characteristics namely HPPE fibre and LDPE chips and is prepared by melt mixing of components and suitable moulding.<br>
A distinct disadvantage of such known materials is that such materials are prepared from expensive high performance polyethylene (HPPE) fibres. Vet another disadvantage of such known materials is that the method of preparation has significant limitations due to high melt viscosity during melt processing. A further disadvantage of such known materials is that of high melt, viscosity during melt processing which also results<br>
in insufficient mixing of the? two components. A still further disadvantage is of a possibility of significant changes in properties of HPPE fibres during melt processing. Finally, the known process is limited to preparation of a combination of HPPE fibres and LDPE chips.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
A primary object of the present invention is to propose polymeric materials or composites made from different or same forms of a single polymer.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose low cost polymeric materials made from easily available polymeric raw materials.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to propose polymeric materials which can be recycled after the desired use.<br>
A still further object of the present invention is to propose polymeric materials which ran he of have a multi-layer construction to provide the desired dimensions.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to propose polymeric materials which are degradable under environmental conditions.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided a process for the preparation of a polymeric materials or composites comprising at least a first and second member, said members being of the same polymer but of different properties and sealed to each other at the melting temperature range of the polymer and at a pressure of • 1 to 4 kb.<br>
In accordance with this invention, the first and second members are of the same polymer and selected from fibre, film, flat tape or fabric. Thus, the members could be fibre and fibre, film and flat tape, fibre and flat tape, fabric and film or fabric and fabric, of the same polymer hut having different properties.<br>
By way of example, the single polymer is polypropylene, hereinafter referred to as PP, from its fibre and film form comprises of heat sealing or impregnation of PP film and PP fibre of desired shape and dimensions in temperature range of about 150 to 165 °C at a pressure of about 1 to 4 kg, which results in complete impregnation of film and fabric.<br>
In accordance with one embodiments of the present invention, the method of preparation of polymeric materials made from same form of the single or same polymer, for example made from fibre and fibre of a single polymer comprises of heat sealing of two sets of said same form of the single or same polymer, that is fibres of same polymer with different melting behavior and/or properties.<br>
Thus, a typical example, which is not intended to limit the scope of the present invention, is preparation of polymeric materials of polypropylene, from its fibre forms comprises of heat sealing of PP fibres of desired shape and dimensions but having different melt behaviour, which results in complete impregnation of fabrics.<br>
In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the textile structure and film or textile structure of two different types of fibres, is placed in a mould to any desired shape. The mould<br>
temperature on the two side of the mould is changed to impart a rough structure, if desired. Further, in the polymeric materials with porous structure the film in supplied in deficiency.<br>
Depending upon the thickness of the polymeric material,  each of the members may consists of a  single or  a  plurality  of  layers and  of  the  same  member. Further,  the  polymeric materials or composites can  be prepared  in woven form, non—woven form,  knitted  form, braided   form   or  more  complex   three   dimensional structures or  a combination of these forms, say in  the form of layers.<br>
The polymers that can be employed in the polymeric form are, for example, polypropylene, high density polyethylene, polyethylene tetephthalate, polybutyle terephthalate, polypropylene terephthalate, nylons liquid crystal polymeric systems etc. and other thermoplastics that can be converted to fibre, film or flat tape forms.<br>
The materials of the presently disclosed invention<br>
are very strong arid could be obtained in desired show<br>
and with desired characteristics, like porous or water<br>
scalable, rough or smooth, and are completely<br>
recyclable.	<br>
The materials of the presently disclosed invention find their applications in wide range, such as geogrids, geotextiles, medical packaging and in general material substitute to whole range of other products.<br>
As described hereinabove, and in accordance with an embodiment of this invention, the polymeric material is formed by impregnation of the first member to the second member. The density of the polymeric material is dependent on the level of impregnation.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
