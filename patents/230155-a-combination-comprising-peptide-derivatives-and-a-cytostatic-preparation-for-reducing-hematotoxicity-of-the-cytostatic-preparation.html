				<td>A COMBINATION COMPRISING PEPTIDE DERIVATIVES AND A CYTOSTATIC PREPARATION<br>
FOR -REDUCING HEMATOTOXIV^TY OF THE CYTOSTATIC PREPARATION<br>
Specification<br>
The invention relates to medicine and in particular, to treating cancer diseases and it is<br>
useful in treating tumors of different genesis.<br>
The invention relates to a method for inducing cells differentiation using peptides<br>
derivatives as an agent inducing cells differentiation and in particular, to their use in antitumor<br>
noncytotoxic therapy.<br>
Absence of the ability to differentiate in most tumor cells is known to result in an<br>
uncontrollable tumor growth.<br>
Search for agents of both specific and non-specific induction of cells differentiation is<br>
therefore one of novel approaches to anti-tumor noncytotoxic therapy.<br>
Under "induction of cells differentiation" is averaget the capability of the different<br>
substances to restore (or to drive) the following functions lost or lowered because of the various<br>
reasons: passing a normal cellular cycle by a cell, synthesis of biologically active vitally<br>
important substances therein etc.<br>
Substances or compounds the action mechanism of which is not associated with one<br>
particular cell function and those can cause its differentiation by several parameters, can be<br>
attributed to non-specific differentiatio 1 inductors.<br>
Methods for inducing tumor cells differentiation by administering retinoids or ct-2-<br>
interferon are known [Cancer Res.,40, 2245-3350, 1980].<br>
The cells differentiation inductor polytransretinoic acid (PTRA) is used as an agent to<br>
prolong remission following induction or post-remission therapy of acute promyelocytic<br>
leukemia. Cells differentiation as affected by retinoic acid derivatives leads to stabilization of<br>
tumor cells growth [Abelev G.I. Differentiation and tumor phenotype in cells of leukoses and<br>
lymphomas/ In: The Clinical Oncol ematology (edited by M.A. Volkova). Moscow, the<br>
Meditsina publishers, 2001, Chapter 11 pages 116-123].<br>
The use of a-interferon preparations as immunotherapy agents in treating melanoma is<br>
also associated with induction of tumor cells differentiation in which adhesion capability is<br>
enhanced and antigenic profile changes. Therapy with interferon results in reduced progression<br>
of tumor growth as well as prevents the development and rate of metastasis [Atzpodien J.,<br>
Kirchner H. Cancer, Cytokines, and cytotoxic cells: interleukin-2 in the immunotherapy of<br>
human neoplasms. Klin. Wochenschr, 1!&gt;90, v.68, pp. 1-7].<br>
Preparations that cause hemopoietic cells differentiation damaged owing to cytotoxic<br><br>
the chemotherapy have been introduced into clinical practice recently. These preparations are<br>
different cytokines prepared from bons marrow such as hematohormones: granulocytic colony-<br>
stimulating factor, granulocytic-macrophagal colony-stimulating factor and others. Their use in<br>
treating different human tumors results in accelerated maturation of the bone marrow cells and<br>
prevents hematologic cytotoxic effect of the chemotherapy preparations [Crawford j., Ozer H.,<br>
Stoller R. et al. Phase II of clinical investigation of GM-CSF by the patients of SCLC with the<br>
dose-intensive the chemotherapy. The New England Journal of Medicicne. 1991, v.325, No.3,<br>
pp.164-170].<br>
Thus, induction of tumor cells differentiation is one of the leading mechanisms of<br>
neoplasm growth stabilization, increased immunotherapy effect and correcting hematologic<br>
toxicity of the chemotherapy preparations.<br>
The present inventors have discovered that the peptides derivartives of general formula<br><br><br><br>
are potent inductors of cells differentiation and are useful as agents for non-cytotoxic therapy of<br>
cancer diseases in particular, melanoma and hemoblastomas as well as hematocorregating<br>
agents.<br>
The compounds of formula (I)<br><br>
are disclosed in the International application PCT/RU98/00215 as possessing antioxidant,<br>
antiasthmatic, antihypoxic, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, antibacterial, lipidregulating, anti-<br>
metastatic as well as other kinds of therapeutic effect. The compounds of cyclic aspartyl-<br>
histamine and acetyl-aspartyl-histamine structure are disclosed in the work Kvamme, E.;<br>

In a preferred embodiment the present invention relates to a method for induction of cells<br>
differentiation comprising administration as an active agent an effective amount of 4-[N-(2-<br>
imidazol-4-yl)ethyl)carbamoyl]butyric acid (Dicarbamine®).<br>
Preferred compounds of general formula (I) used in the present invention are compounds<br>

The most preferred compound used in the present invention is 4-[N-(2-imidazol-4-<br>
yl)ethyl)carbamoyl]butyric acid (Dicartamine®).<br>

In another preferred embodiment of the invention peptides derivatives of general<br>

chemotherapy course starting, during the chemotherapy and within the period between the<br>
chemotherapy courses until next course of cytotoxic therapy.<br>
Below, the examples illustrating preferred embodiments of the instant invention are<br>
presented.<br>
Example 1. Activity of peptides derivatives of general formula (I) to melanoma M-6<br>
cells differentiation<br>
The study was conducted on 10-12 week old thymus free (nude) female Balb/C mice<br>
weighing 20-22 grams (breeding of the Russian Cancer Research Center (RCRC) named after<br>
N.N.Blokhin of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences (RAMS)). A human melanoma strain<br>
earlier obtained from primary clinical material was taken from the bank of tumor strains of the<br>
RCRC of the RAMS for transplantation to thymus free "nude" mice. Tumor was disintegrated by<br>
Versen solution with vital Tripan blue staining and inoculated subcutaneously to mice in the<br>
amount of 1.6 million cells per a mouse.<br>
Dicarbamine was administered to mice intragastrically using a metal probe daily at dose<br>
1.0 mg/kg beginning 4 days before the tumor inoculation and thereafter for 10-11 days<br>
(administration course up to 15 days). The mice were sacrificed with ether anesthesia in 12, 24<br>
and 48 hours after the last adrninistratior.<br>
4 groups of mice were used in the experiment:<br>
Group 1 - the control, no Dicarbamine is administered. Mice aree sacrificed at the same<br>
terms as those of the groups received Dicarbamine.<br>
Group 2 - Dicarbamine is administered and mice are sacrificed in 12 hours after<br>
termination of the administration.<br>
Group 3 - Dicarbamine is administered and mice are sacrificed in 24 hours after<br>
termination of the administration.<br>
Group 4 - Dicarbamine is administered and mice are sacrificed in 48 hours after<br>
termination of its administration.<br>
Four morphologic parameters such as the number of cells with pigment and the number<br>
of cells with apoptosis signs (capability to differentiate), the number of mitoses (proliferation<br>
activity) and necrosis area were determined to monitor differentiation and proliferation degree of<br>
M-6 melanoma in the groups of control animals and the Dicarbamine groups. These parameters<br>
were determined dynamically and correlated with general morphologic picture of a tumor growth<br>
as an integral sign. For this purpose the cumor was removed in mice, placed into formaline and<br>
histologically processed for light microscopy. The data obtained are shown in Table 1.<br>
Table 1.<br>
Morphologic parameters of M-6 melanoma (light microscopy)<br><br><br>
The conducted study allowed the inventors to establish that human melanoma inoculated<br>
to nude mice at day 9 forms the tumor consisting of polymorph cells that grow by continuous<br>
fields with insignificant stroma development. Small necrosis sites are ennumberered in the<br>
tumor, which sites slightly increase by 48 hours (up to 3-5 % of slice area) as compared to<br>
sacrificing terms 12 and 24 hours (1-2 % and 2-3 % , respectively). 3-5 % of imitoses are<br>
observed in the tumor during all growth periods. Apoptosis is slightly expressed. Cells<br>
containing pigment are rarely found and their number during the first day does not exceed 1-2 %<br>
and only in 48 hours of growth it increases up to 2-3 %. Thus intensity of melanin genesis during<br>
this period is insignificant. The obtained characteristic allows to conclude that melanoma is a<br>
rapidly growing tumor practically lost capability of differentiating on the basis of both apoptosis<br>
degree and first of all, on the basis of the basal functional capability of melanin genesis.<br>
The effect of Dicarbamine on melanoma cells differentiation was assessed on the basis<br>
of the intensity of melanin genesis by numbering the number of cells with melanin in the tumor<br>
slices. With this object, the tumor was excised in mice, placed into glutaraldehyde and<br><br>
histologically processed for electronic microscopy was done. The Melanin Genesis Intensity<br>
Index (MGII) that reflects the degree of cells differentiation was calculated in the prepared slices<br>
according to the following equation:<br>
MGII = NCMxNM,<br>
wherein: NCM is the number of cells containing melanosomes;<br>
NM is average number of melanosomes per a cell.<br>
The analysis of melanin genesis intensity conducted by this index is shown in Table 2.<br>
Table 2.<br>
Comparative melanin genesis inter.sity in melanoma cells following administration of<br>
Dicarbamine (electronic microscopy)<br><br>
*beginning from day 9 following the tumor inoculation<br>
Electronic microscopy test shows that as compared to the control, the number of tumor<br>
cells comprising melanosomes and the number of melanosomes per one cell are increased as due<br>
to Dicarbamine effect. The MGII index increases for the observes terms as follows: in 12 hours -<br>
1.9-fold, in 24 hours - 2.4-fold and in 48 hours - 2.3-fold.<br>
Thus following a 15 day administration course of Dicarbamine, average increase of M-6<br>
melanoma tumor cells differentiation degree is 2.2-fold that is supported by melanin genesis<br>
intensity (the MGII index), increase in the number of cells comprising melanosomes (1.3-fold)<br>
and increase in the number of melanosomes (1.3-fold).<br>
Example 2. The effect of Dicarbamine on melanin synthesizing function of inoculated<br><br>
human melanoma cells<br>
Mice with subcutaneously inoculated human melanoma as described in Example 1, were<br>
daily p.o. dosed with Dicarbamine at a higher single dose 4.5 mg/kg for 3 weeks from the<br>
moment of the tumor transplantation.<br>
Animals were sacrificed in 3 weeks since the tumor transplantation. By sacrifice the<br>
tumors volume was in average 150 mm3. Following sacrifice, the tumor wsa excised in mice and<br>
disintegrated with Versen solution and the cell fraction was isolated in which the number of cells<br>
with pigment was calculated in the Goryaev's chamber during light microscopy.<br>
The conducted studies show that in the control average number of cells with melanin was<br>
39.14±8.72, and in the test it was 108.42±11.91, i.e. the number of cells synthesizing melanin<br>
significantly (p
Thus in the conducted series of tests using Dicarbamine at the different doses, a<br>
statistically significant effect of pronounced induction of human melanoma cells differentiation<br>
was obtained as evidenced on the basis of the melanin genesis intensity.<br>
The data are presented in Table 3.<br>
Table 3.<br>
Melanin genesis intensity in human melanoma cells induced by Dicarbamine<br><br>
Example 3. The effect of Dicarbamine on inoculated human melanoma Mel-6growth<br>
dynamics<br>
The study was conducted on 10-12 week old thymus free "nude" female Balb/C mice<br>
weighing 20-22 grams (breeding of the RCRC named after N.N.Blokhin of the RAMS). A<br>
human melanoma strain Mel-6 earlier obtained from primary clinical material was taken from<br><br>
the bank of tumor strains of the RCRC of the RAMS for transplantation to thymus free mice.<br>
Dicarbamine at the single doses 1.5 mg/kg and 4.5 mg/kg was p.o. administered daily to<br>
two mice groups for 3 weeks from the moment of the tumor development (from day 15 to day 36<br>
from the tumor transplantation ).<br>
Measurement of the tumor was done, at days 18, 25, 33, 39, 46 and 53 from the<br>
transplantation. Dicarbamine effect was assessed on the basis of the tumor growth dynamics for<br>
8 weeks in multiple measurements of tumor volumes "V" according to the formula:<br><br>
wherein L is length in mm, s is width in mm; and h is height in mm.<br>
Ratio between volumes of tumors Vt/Vt-1 that was expressed in percent was then<br>
calculated and statistically processed according to the Student's method to calculate statistically<br>
significant difference. The data obtained are shown in Table 4.<br>
The data obtained showed a 7-day delay in maximum tumor mass gain in comparison<br>
with the control. As compared with the control group, statistically significant differences in<br>
tumor growth rate were found at day 25 from the transplantation in the mice group received<br>
Dicarbamine at the single doses 4.5 mg/kg that corresponds to a 10-day course of Dicarbamine<br>
dosing at a course dose 45 mg/kg. In this group average tumor volume increased by<br>
166.0±93.0%, whereas in the control this parameter was 329.0±88.9% (p
Example 4. The Dicarbamine affect in combination with the chemotherapy on the<br>
growth of inoculated human M-6 melanoma transplanted to thymus free mice.<br>
The study was conducted according to the technique described in Example 3.<br>
Dicarbamine was administered daily p o. at the single dose 4.5 mg/kg for 3 weeks from the<br>
moment of tumor appearance (from day 15 to day 36). In the groups of combined treatment<br>
Dicarbamine was also administered daily at the single dose 4.5 mg/kg for 3 weeks (days 15-36)<br>
in combination with a single administration of anti-tumor cytostatic agents Cysplatin at dose 6<br>
mg/kg i.v. (day 25) and Aranoza at dose 40 mg/kg i.p. (day 27). Cytostatic therapy with was<br>
commenced at average tumors volume being 200±62 mm3. At days 18, 25, 33, 39, 46 and 53<br>
from the transplantation tumor volumes were measured and the value Vt/Vt_1 was calculated<br>
which value was expressed in percent. The data obtained are shown in Table 5.<br>
Table 5.<br>
The effect of combined the chemotherapy with anti-tumor cytostatic agents and Dicarbamine on<br>
human M-6 melanoma growth dynamics<br><br><br>
It follows from the data presented that Dicarbamine in the used dosing routdelays the<br>
tumor growth at initial stagesthat can be shown by decrease in tumor mass gain at day 25<br>
166.0±93.0% as compared to the control where the gain was 329.0±88.9%. Thus the results of<br>
Dicarbamine effect on melanoma growth were reproduced (see Example 3). Combined the<br>
chemotherapy with Aranoza and Cysplntin in the indicated regimes appeared to be inefficient,<br>
i.e. gain of the tumor at this term was higher than the control value (413.0±276.0%). This proves<br>
the absence of sensitivity of the used Mel-6 human melanoma strain to the given the<br>
chemotherapy scheme. Introduction of Dicarbamine into the inefficient the chemotherapy<br>
scheme resulted in a statistically significant (p
by 182.0±60.0% that proves its efficacy in case of the absence of the chemotherapy effect.<br>
Example 5. The effect of peptides derivartives of general formula (I) on proliferation<br>
capability of melanoma cells when interferon administration.<br>
The effect of Dicarbamine on proliferation capability of melanoma cells along with a-<br>
interferon (Introne®, IN) administration was studied. It should be noted that Dicarbamine itself<br>
is capable of slowing proliferation activity of melanoma cells without changing their survival.<br>
The study was conducted on two continuous cell cultures growing in the form of a<br>
monolayer in a tissue culture on murine B-16 melanoma cells and human M-5 melanoma cells.<br>
IN was administered at concentrations 7( -700 IU/ml. Dicarbamine (D) was transferred into stock<br>
solution (1.000 uM), sterilized through filters with 0.22 urn pore diameter and then diluted to<br>
concentrations 0.01 and 1.0 μM.<br><br>
The effect of preparations en cells was assessed on the basis of initial rate of cell<br>
proliferation (IRCP). This index (IRCP) that is usually called colony rate growth, was<br>
determined by numbering the number of cells in micro colonies during the first days following<br>
affection in "test" (with preparations) and "control" (without preparations) dishes, by analyzing<br>
50 colonies in each of them. Each "point" included not less than three Petri dishes with growing<br>
cell colonies in adding specific concentrations of preparations under study. Growth rate of<br>
colonies (in %) was calculated according to the formula:<br><br>
Cell numbers in micro colonies were calculated for every "point". Toxicity of<br>
preparations in the selected range of concentrations was judged by cells survival that was<br>
determined by the ratio between numbers of the grown colonies in "test" and "control" dishes.<br>
Test results are shown in Table 6.<br>
Table 6.<br>
The effect of Dicarbamine and a-interferon on proliferation activity of murine B-16 melanoma<br>
and human M-5 melanoma cells<br><br>
One can see from the table that i n the control with M-5 melanoma the IRCP index was<br>
preserved at the 100% level for 96 hours.<br>
In the samples with M-5 cells when a-interferon was added at the concentration 7.0<br>
IU/ml in 48 hours the IRCP index increased up to 111.3% and slowed down to 94.8 and 73.0%<br>
respectively only in 76 and 96 hours. When a-interferon was added at concentration 70 IU/ml in<br>
48 hours the IRCP index slowed down to 53.7%, in 72 hours - down to 51.9% and in 96 hours -<br>
down to 48.8%. I.e. the maximum inhibiting effect of a-interferon at concentration 70 IU/ml<br><br>
achieves 50% IRCP.<br>
When Dicarbamine at the concentration 0.01 μM was added, the IRCP index in 48 hours<br>
slowed down to 82.4%, in 72 hours - down to 73.6% and in 96 hours - down to 70.2% and when<br>
Dicarbamine at the concentration 1 μM was added, the IRCP index in 48 hours slowed down to<br>
69.0% and in 72 hours - down to 50.0%.<br>
Thus the maximum inhibiting effect of Dicarbamine also achieves 50% of the IRCP<br>
index and was obtained at the preparation concentration 1.0 uM.<br>
In the tests on B-16 melanoma when α-interferon was added at the concentration 70<br>
IU/ml, the IRCP index in 72 hours slowed down to 50.0%, and when Dicarbamine was added at<br>
two indicated concentrations, the IRCP index in 48 hours slowed down to 52.9 and 44.6%<br>
respectively and in 72 hours to 61.0 and 44.6% respectively. Significant reducing the IRCP index<br>
down to 38.0 and 29.8% was obtained only when a-interferon was added at concentration 700<br>
IU/ml.<br>
Thus the conducted tests show that α-interferon and Dicarbamine inhibit M-5 melanoma<br>
and B-16 melanoma cells growth at the level of 40.0-50.0% that is characteristic of<br>
differentiation inductors. A more pronounced effect on the IRCP index can be obtained only in<br>
case of a 100-fold increase in α-interferon concentration.<br>
Combined addition of a-interferon at concentration 70.0 IU/ml and Dicarbamine to M-5<br>
cells showes that in all cases the IRCP index lowered down to 30.7-24.0-31.0%) respectively to<br>
recording terms. The most pronounced effect was obtained on B-16 melanoma when a-interferon<br>
at concentration 700 IU/ml and Dicarbamine at the both concentrations were used in<br>
combination: the IRCP index lowered down to 24.9 and 29.8% in 48 hours and down to 22.0 and<br>
16.0% in 72 hours, respectively.<br>
Thus Dicarbamine similarly to a-interferon slows down murine B-16 melanoma and<br>
human M-5 melanoma cells proliferation and doe:s not show toxicity (according to the survival<br>
index). As it was shown by the given examples, the effect of Dicarbamine is characteristic of<br>
differentiation inductors and has an additive character in combination with the known<br>
differentiation inductor a-interferon on melanoma cells. This effect results in enhancement of<br>
tumor growth inhibition and it is an indication for raising immunotherapy efficacy of<br>
melanomas.<br>
5.2. The effect of peptide derivatives on melanoma cells proliferation capability .<br>
The study was conducted on a continuous cell culture of murine B-16 melanoma growing<br>
in the form of a monolayer in a tissue culture. α-Interferon selected as a preparation of<br>
comparison, was administered at concentration 70 IU/ml.<br>
The tested compounds were transferred into stock solution (1,000 μM), sterilized through<br><br>
filters with 0.22 μm pore diameter and then diluted down to concentration 100 μM.<br>
The effect of compounds on cells was assessed on the basis of initial rate of cell<br>
proliferation (IRCP). This index was determined by numbering the number of cells in micro<br>
colonies during the first days following affection in "test" (with preparations) and "control"<br>
(without preparations) dishes, by analyzing 50 colonies in each of them.<br>
Growth rate of colonies (in %) was calculated according to the formula:<br><br>
Calculations of cell numbers in micro colonies were done for every "point". Toxicity was<br>
judged by B-16 melanoma cells survrval that was determined by the ratio between numbers of<br>
the grown colonies in "test" and "control" dishes. Test results are shown in Table 7.<br>
Table 7.<br>
The effect of peptide derivatives at concentration 100 μM and α-interferon at concentration 70<br>
IU/ml on murine B-16 melanoma cells proliferative activity<br><br>
Differences with the control are s:gnificant (p
Data presented in Table 7 show that peptide derivatives inhibit B-16 melanoma cell<br><br>
colonies growth at the level 50.0-70.0% that is characteristic of differentiation inductors.<br>
Example 6. Distribution of tumor cells by cell cycle phases at different terms following<br>
Dicarbamine administration.<br>
Tests were done on inoculated B-16 melanoma. The effect of Dicarbamine on the<br>
distribution of tumor cells was studied on the basis of DNA content at different terms following<br>
administration of the preparation. From day 6 after the tumor inoculation mice for 10 days were<br>
daily intragastrically given with 0.5 mg/kg Dicarbamine. Animals were sacrificed with<br>
subsequent investigation of tumor material at days 10, 12,16 and 18 after inoculation, i.e. days 5<br>
and 7 respectively after Dicarbamine administration as well as in 2 and 4 days after termination<br>
of Dicarbamine 10-day dosing.<br>
Testal results shows that Dicarbamine caused a significant increase of the portion of<br>
inter-phase tumor cells (IIG1) (≈25%). In a constant portion of proliferating cells (≈30%)<br>
increase in the portion of IIG2 cells (12-14%) is noted. Accordingly the portion of normal<br>
stromal cells (IG1) in the samples compensatory dicrease. Said changes are most clearly<br>
pronounced after 5-10 administrations of Dicarbamine.<br>
Course dosing of Dicarbamine causes kinetic rearrangement of tumor cell population.<br>
Inhibition of cells in the synthetic cycle phase (S-phase) is noted with compensatory decrease in<br>
the portion of cells that are ready for proliferation or proliferating cells (G phase).<br>
Accumulation of tumor cells in the stationary phase G1 simultaneously occurs.<br>
Lowering the level of proliferative activity Dicarbamine promotes accumulation of cells<br>
in stationary (non-proliferating) cell cycle phase. It can slow down tumor growth and promote<br>
transition of cells to a more differentiated state.<br>
Example 7. Efficacy of Dicarbamine in respect to hematological toxicity of<br>
Cyclophosphamide and its combinations with Cysplatin and Carboplatin.<br>
Hematocorregating effect of Dicarbamine was studied on the first generation of male<br>
mice hybrids F1 (CBA x C57BI).<br>
7.1. 4 groups of animals were used to study the effect of Dicarbamine on hematotoxicity<br>
of Cyclophosphamide (CPH):<br>
Group 1 - Dicarbamine, 0.5 mg/kg daily beginning 5 days before CPH administration<br>
and for 5 days after the single administration of CPH at dose 200 mg/kg;<br>
Group 2 - the single administration of 200 mg/kg CPH;<br>
Group 3 - intact control;<br>
Group 4 - Dicarbamine 0.5 mg/kg, daily for 10 days.<br>
The data obtained are shown in Table 8.<br><br>
Table 8.<br>
Total leukocyte number in peripheral mice blood under Cyclophosphamide effect and<br><br>
The data obtained show that use of Dicarbamine in combination with CPH allows<br>
reducing hematotoxic effect of the latter and speeding up recovering blood parameters.<br>
7.2. When studying the effect of Dicarbamine on hematotoxic action of CPH<br>
combinations with platinum derivatives, Dicarbamine was intragastrically daily administered to<br>
mice for 20 days daily at a single dose 0.5 mg/kg. Cytostatic preparations were once<br>
administered intraperitoneally at day five from, starting Dicarbamine administration course.<br>
Doses of cytostatic preparations are shown in Tables 10 and 11.<br>
The results of studying the effect of Dicarbamine on leukocytes number in mice<br>
peripheral blood when combined dosing of CPOH with Cysplatin or Carboplatin are shown in<br>
Tables 9 and 10 respectively.<br>
Table 9.<br>
The effect of Dicarbamine on hematotoxicity of Cyclophosphamide in combination with<br><br><br><br><br>
The presented data show that adready by day 5 in the mice group received cytostatic<br>
preparations at maximal doses along with Dicarbamine, leukocyte number achieved lower border<br>
of physiological norm and by day 7 it practically restored up to the initial level. Without<br>
Dicarbamine restoration was observed only by clay 21 of the test. In mice received cytostatic<br>
preparations at maximum doses without Dicarbamine death of animals was noted at days 3, 4<br>
and 7 of the test. In animals that were given cytostatic preparations at maximum doses along<br>
with Dicarbamine, only delayed death at days 8 and 16 was noted.<br>
Table 10.<br>
The effect of Dicarbamine on hematotoxicity of Cyclophosphamide in combination with<br><br><br><br>
The data presented show (Table 10) that in case of using Dicarbamine together with<br>
Carboplatin and Cyclophosphane at the lethal doses, leukocyte number in peripheral blood and<br>
terms of animals death are similar to the data presented in Table 9.<br>
Thus Dicarbamine inhibits the development of leukopenia in all the courses studied, it<br>
speeds up recovering total leukocyte number and delays term of mice death when using<br>
cytostatic preparations at lethal doses.<br>
7.3. When studying the effect of peptide derivatives of general formula (I) on<br>
hematotoxic action of CPH combinations with Carboplatin, the compounds were intragastrically<br>
administered to mice daily at the dose 0.5 mg/kg for 10 days. At day five after starting<br>
administration of the tested compounds mice were intraperitoneally injected CPH at dose 200<br>
mg/kg and Carboplatin at a single dose 15 mg/kg. Thereafter administration of the tested<br>
compounds was continued for 5 more days.<br>
Before starting dosing the tested compounds, blood was drawn from mice tail to<br>
calculate total leukocyte number. At days 3, 5 and 7 after administration of Cyclophosphamide<br>
with Carboplatin blood also was drawn from mice tail to calculate total leukocyte number. Each<br>
group included 15 animals.<br>
As a control a mice group that received only cytostatic preparations was used.<br>
The data presented in Table 1 show that peptide derivatives of general formula (I)<br>
inhibit the development of leukocytopenia and speed up recovering total leukocyte number.<br>
Table 11.<br>
The effect of peptide derivatives of general formula (I) on hematotoxic action of<br>
Cyclophosphamide combination with Carboplatin<br><br><br><br>
7.4. The effect of Dicarbamine on cells differentiation is supported by the study of mice<br>
peripheral blood differential number under Cyclophosphamide effect in combination with<br>
Dicarbamine in comparison with dosing Cyclophosphamide alone.<br>
Two groups of mice are used. Group one is administered Dicarbamine at dose 0.5 mg/kg<br>
5 days prior to and 5 days after CPH administration at dose 200 mg/kg. Group two of mice is<br>
administered CPH alone at dose 200 mg/kg. Results of the studies are shown in Tables 12 and<br>
13.<br>
Data presented in Tables 12 and 13 show that recovering peripheral blood occurs due to<br>
burst of mature forms that confirms the differentiation effect of Dicarbamine. This is especially<br>
seen at days 3 and 5 by peripheral blood number and cellularity of bone marrow (Tables 12 and<br>
13). In the group with Dicarbamine myelocytes and band neutrophils are absent in peripheral<br>
blood and in group without Dicarbamine these form elements are present (Table 12).<br>
Example 8. Decrease in the rate of and dimensions of subcutaneously inoculated Friend<br>
erythroblastosis (FEB) in mice as effected by peptide derivatives.<br>
The studies were conducted on male mice hybrid 100 BDF1 that were divided into groups<br>
containing 10 mice each. Lineal DBA2 mice were used for passaging FEB in vivo.<br>
A strain of Friend erythroblastosis was obtained from the bank of tumor strains of the GU<br>
RCRC named after N.N.Blokhin of the RAMS, it was twice passaged intraperitoneally using<br>
generations 3-8 in subcutaneous inoculation. Thr inoculation was done using cellular suspension<br>
at amount 1x106 in 0.3 ml 1999 medium<br>
Solutions of the tested compounds were intragastricaally daily administered to mice using<br>
a probe from day 3 to day 7 after tumors inoculation.<br>
Therapy efficacy was assessed on the basis of tumor growth inhibition (TGI, %) and an<br>
average life span (ALS). Increase in life span was determined by the commonly accepted<br>
criterion T/C (%) that was calculated as ratio between ALS in the test and control groups. Tumor<br>
growth rate Vt/V1 was calculated on the basis of change dynamics in average tumor volumes.<br>
Data of the studies on the effect of peptide derivatives on tumor size and on tumor growth<br>
rate are shown in Tables 14 and 15, respectively.<br>
The results obtained show that peptides derivartives cause growth inhibition of<br>
subcutaneously inoculated FEB for 19 days after ternination of therapy. Said effect started to be<br>
recorded immediately after termination of administering compounds at a single dose 1.5 mg/kg<br><br>
and was preserved at a significant leve. (p
during one week following withdrawal of the compounds.<br>
It was established resulting from the conducted studies that the compounds of general<br>
formula (I) possess inhibiting effect on the development of FEB subcutaneous node. The data<br>
obtained allow to consider that the test compounds are useful for therapy of human<br>
hemoblastoses.<br>
Example 9. The effect of Dicarbamine and 2a-interferon (Reaferon) on Friend<br>
erythroblastosis tumor cells.<br>
Friend erythroblastosis was investigated which was inoculated subcutaneously to DBA2<br>
female mice via spleen cells.<br>
4 groups of tests were carried out.<br>
Group 1 - control animals without therapy, a physiological saline was administered;<br>
group 2 - Reaferon at dose 100 thousand IU/kg was administered daily s.c. from day 3 to<br>
day 7 after inoculation;<br>
group 3 - Dicarbamine at a single dose 4.5 mg/kg was administered p.o. from day 3 to<br>
day 7 after inoculation;<br>
group 4 - Dicarbamine and Reaferon were administered simultaneously according to a<br>
similar scheme.<br>
Material for light microscopy was taken in sacrificed animals at days 3, 7 and 14 after<br>
termination of therapy or administration of a physiological saline, material for electronic<br>
microscopy was taken at days 7 and 14.<br>
For histological examination tumor pieces were fixed in 10% neutral formaline and<br>
imbedded into paraffin; slices obtained were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and examined for<br>
glycogen (polysaccharides) content using periodic acid Schiff reaction, for RNA content<br>
according to Brachet, for lipids and iron. Slices were looked through and photographed in the<br>
Polivar light microscope (Austria).<br>
For electronic microscopy tumor pieces were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde solution and<br>
1% osmium quadrioxide, embedded into EPON-812. Semi-thick and ultra-sick slices were<br>
prepared on the LKB-III ultratome (Sweden). The obtained semi-sick slices were stained with<br>
Toluidine blue and looked through in the light microscope. Ultra-sick slices were additionally<br>
stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate; the slices were looked through and photographed in<br>
the JEOL 1200 EX-II electronic microscope (Japan).<br>
Percentage of cells with different t types of differentiation (blast cells, lymphocytes and<br>
granular leukocytes) was calculated during electronic microscopy for quantitative assessment.<br>
Percentage of mitoses and cells with apoptosis as well as areas of necroses were assessed<br><br>
during histological examination.<br>
Histological examination<br>
Group 1. Control animals without therapy.<br>
It was found at histological examination that tumor cells are large, polymorphous, their<br>
nuclei are light, cytoplasm is moderately developed. Cellular size sometimes fluctuates and<br>
individual smaller cells are errnumberered but large cells represent the main mass of cells.<br>
Tumor cells form continuous ou:growths. In individual tumors necrosis sites surrounding<br>
preserved fields of tumor cells are errnumberered. Area of necroses did not exceed 10-15% of the<br>
slice surface.<br>
In a majority of tumor cells Brachet reaction for RNA is strongly pronounced, less often<br>
it is weak or absent (in individual small cells).<br>
Periodic acid Schiff reaction had diffuse character, reaction to iron was positive only in<br>
individual cells.<br>
In the tumor among large cells mitoses (up to 1-1.5%) and cells with apoptosis signs (up<br>
to 0.5%) were errnumberered.<br>
As the tumor grew, the area of necroses was increasing up to 20-30% of the slice surface,<br>
the number of metoses increased (up to 1.5-2%), apoptosis activity did not change. The number<br>
of large polymorphous cells significantly prevailed at all terms.<br>
Group II. Administration of Reaferon<br>
Tumors have usual histological structure. As in the control, among large polymorphous<br>
cells smaller cells with hyperchromatic nucleus are found.<br>
By day 14 the area of necroses is 40-50% of the slice surface, mitotic activity is 0.5-1%,<br>
by day 7 apoptosis increased up to 1-2%, but by day 14 it lowered down to 1-1.5%.<br>
Group HI. Administration of Dicarbamine<br>
Increase in the quantity of small tumor cells with hyperchromatic nuclei is noted.<br>
Quantity of large polymorphous cells significantly prevails. The area of necroses did not<br>
significantly change as compared to the picture in group I. Mitotic activity also remained within<br>
the limits of the control figures. At days 3 and 7 the rate of apoptosis slightly lowered (down to<br>
0.1=0.5% at day 7).<br>
Group IV. Simultaneous administration of Dicarbamine and Reaferon<br>
The area of necroses and mitotic activity did not show significant shifts as compared to<br>
the changes in group II. At day 3 apoptosis lowered down to 0.2-0.5%, at days 7 and 14 it is<br>
0.5% (as in the control).<br>
Large polymorphous cells of blast type significantly prevail in the tumor.<br>
Electronic microscopy<br><br>
Group I. Control animals without treatment<br>
Large polymorphous low-differentiated cells of blast type are mainly found in the tumor<br>
during electronic microscopy. Nuclei in these cells have rounded or slightly irregular shape<br>
occasionally with uneven surface. Diffuse distribution of chromatin is usually seen in them, only<br>
in some of them formation of marginally located heterochromatin is noted. Nuclei usually<br>
occupy a major portion of cytoplasm wherein ribosomes, single mitochondria, occasionally the<br>
structures of slightly rough endoplasmic reticulum prevail. Blast cells amount 90-95% of all the<br>
tumor population.<br>
In addition to blast cells, lymphocytes of different maturity degree are ennumberered, i.e.<br>
lymphoblasts, lymphocytes (large, medium, small). Nuclei in these cells are rounded, oval, often<br>
with uneven surface, they comprise heterochromatin in the form of large accumulations, nucleoli<br>
are ennumberered. Cytoplasm is moderately developed, it comprises a lot of ribosomes; there are<br>
little other organelles, dense granules are occasionally ennumberered.<br>
Granular leukocytes are small, granules characteristic of neutrophils, less often<br>
eosinophils are visible in cytoplasm. Nuclei in cells are segmented or have deep concavities.<br>
Cells having granules in cytoplasm, irregular nucleus and protruding plasmatic membrane in the<br>
form of processes can be occasionally seen (monocytes). Freely lying red blood cells were<br>
ennumberered in the tumor.<br>
Large blast cells mainly prevail in the 1umor (up to 90-95%). Lymphoid cells are<br>
ennumberered within the range 4-8%, granular cells amount 1-2%.<br>
No significant shifts in the ratio between different cell types were noted as the tumor<br>
grew following engrafting.<br>
Group II. Administration of Reaferon<br>
General ultrastructure of tumor cells of different type is preserved.<br>
Quantity of large blast cells does not lower, lymphoid cells amount up to 4-8%, granular<br>
leukocytes amount up to 1-2%. Individual red blood cells are present in the tumor.<br>
Group III. Administration of Dicarbamine<br>
Ultrastructure of tumor cells of different type remains previous. Their quantitative ratio<br>
changes and differentiation level somewhat raises. The quantity of large blast type cells lowers<br>
down to 70-80%), the quantity of lymphocytes and granulocytes increases up to 18-25% and 2-<br>
5% respectively. Individual red blood cells are present in the tumor.<br>
The most constantly found changes are ennumberered at day 7 post treatment<br>
termination.<br>
Group IV. Administration of Reaferon and Dicarbamine<br>
Ultrastructure of tumor cells of different type practically corresponds to what is described<br><br>
above (see Group I).<br>
The quantity of large blast type cells fluctuates within the range of 70-80%. The number<br>
of lymphocytes achieves 18-25%, the quantity of leukocytes remains at the level of 2-5%. Red<br>
blood cells lying among the other cells are ennumberered.<br>
As in the previous groups, the changes found are most pronounced at day 7.<br>
Thus Dicarbamine orally administered to mice with Friend erythroblastosis at dose 4.5<br>
mg/kg daily for 5 days was established to cause differentiation of immature tumor cells mainly in<br>
the direction of forming granulocytes as well as cells of erythroid lineage.<br>
As compared to tumors of the control animals, when Dicarbamine was used, the quantity<br>
of immature tumor cells lowered down from 90-95% to 70-80%, i.e. by 15-20% and the quantity<br>
of lymphocytes increased from 4-8% up to 18-25%, i.e. 4-fold.<br>
The quantity of granulocyte lineage cells increased less significantly (from 1-2% to about<br>
2-5%).<br>
It should be noted that most frequently changes were found at day 7 after termination of<br>
treatment. At day 14 after termination of treatment these changes got stabilized.<br>
Reaferon in subcutaneous administration for 5 days at dose 100 thousand IU/kg caused<br>
increase in the area of necroses in the tumor (from 15-20% in the control to 40-50% in the test at<br>
day 7 after termination of treatment anc. from 20-30%) to 40-50%) at day 14). The rate of mitoses<br>
somewhat decreased (from 1.5-2% to 0.5-1%) and the quantity of cells with apoptosis signs<br>
increased (from 0.5% to 1-2%) at day 7 after termination of treatment). Differentiation of tumor<br>
cells did not practically change.<br>
In simultaneous administration of Dicarbamine and Reaferon at the same doses and at the<br>
same terms summation of the effect of ea.ch preparation was found. Enhancement of<br>
differentiation of blast immature cells characteristic of the effect of Dicarbamine alone was<br>
observed as well as growing area of nee roses and decrease in the number of mitoses were found<br>
that was seen in administering Reaferon alone.<br>
Thus it has been established that Dicarbamine is capable of enhancing differentiation of<br>
immature tumor hemopoietic cells of Friend erytliroblastosis in different directions in particular<br>
with formation of lymphoid and myeloid lineage tumor cells.<br>
The effect of Dicarbamine on cells differentiation represents its general property as it was<br>
earlier observed in the example of melanoma study.<br>
Example 10. Electronic microscopy of Dicarbamine protective effect in respect to<br>
hemopoietic cells of the bone marrow and peripheral blood in patients with ovarian cancers<br>
during the chemotherapy<br>
In the previous studies devoted to studying action mechanism of Dicarbamine on the<br><br>
bone marrow, the given preparation was found to protect the bone marrow in animals under<br>
testal conditions against adverse cytotoxic effect of Cyclophosphamide by reducing apopotosis<br>
in normal hemopoietic cells.<br>
Similar data were obtained on the bone marrow puncture biopsies and peripheral blood of<br>
10 patients with stage III-IV ovarian caNcer.<br>
The patients were divided into two equal groups: group I - patients who received the<br>
chemotherapy alone and group II - patients who received the chemotherapy along with<br>
Dicarbamine administration.<br>
Patients in groups I and II received 600 mg/m2 Cyclophosphane and 400 mg/m2<br>
Carboplatin during the first day of therapy; courses were repeated with 3-4 week interval.<br>
Average the chemotherapy course of one patient included 6 courses without Dicarbamine and<br>
5.7 courses with Dicarbamine.<br>
In group II patients received the chemotherapy along with Dicarbamine dosing at a single<br>
dose 100 mg beginning 5 days before the first course and then until the beginning of next course<br>
at the same dose. Duration of Dicarbamine use between two courses averaged 24.5 days.<br>
Average total dose was 2.5 grams.<br>
Puncture biopsy of the bone marrow and peripheral blood for electronic microscopy were<br>
taken in patients prior to the chemotherapy starting and at the end of treatment course with<br>
Dicarbamine or without it.<br>
Fresh bone marrow puncture biopsies were placed on slide plate and many times stirred<br>
with stirring rod until small dense fragments were obtained. The latter were fixed in 2.5%<br>
glutaraldehyde solution additionally fixed in 1% osmium quadrioxide solution; following<br>
washing with phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 they were dehydrated in alcohols of increasing<br>
concentration and embedded into the mixture of epoxy resins EPON-812. Semi-thick and ultra-<br>
sick slices were prepared on the LKB-III ultratome (Sweden). The semi-sick slices were stained<br>
with Methylene or Toluidine blue, ultra-sick slices were contrasted with aqueous solution of<br>
uranyl acetate and lead citrate.<br>
Peripheral blood comprising heparin was centrifuged for 1 hour at 3,000 rpm. Then 2.5%<br>
glutaraldehyde solution was poured on the surface of the film formed for 10-15 minutes the film<br>
was removed and then treatment was proceeded as described above.<br>
Thin slices were jbserved in the light microscope Polivar (Austria) and semi-thin slices<br>
were observed in the electronic microscope JEOL-] 200-CX-l 1 (Japan).<br>
1. Control studies prior to starting of the chemotherapy and Dicarbamine administration.<br>
Patients of groups I and II.<br>
Hemopoietic cells of different maturity degree and differentiation direction are found in<br><br>
puncture biopsies of the bone marrow a portion of cell being with the signs of vacuolization and<br>
dystrophy.<br>
There are blast non-differentiated cells of large size with narrow cytoplasm rim<br>
comprising mainly ribosomes. In these cells a. nucleus of rounded-oval shape with diffuse<br>
chromatin and individual nucleoli occupy the main portion of cytoplasm.<br>
A portion of the cells differentiates in the direction of granulocytic lineage of leukocytes<br>
of different type and differentiation degree.<br>
Promyelocytes and myelocytes with rounded-oval nuclei, diffuse chromatin comprising<br>
in cytoplasm different amount of specific granules are seen. Red blood cells and more mature<br>
granulocytes are often situated around these cells.<br>
Accumulations of more differentiated granulocytes, i.e. band neutrophils and segmented<br>
neutrophils are often seen. Specific granules of different type characteristic of neutrophils,<br>
eosinophils and basophils are present in their cytoplasm.<br>
Lymphoid cells of different differentiation degree (small, medium, large - lymphoblastic)<br>
are disposed among granulocytes.<br>
Many mature red blood cells, often having different shape as well as normoblasts<br>
comprising nuclei and platelets are ennumberered.<br>
2. Bone marrow following the chemotherapy with Cyclophosphane and Carboplatin -<br>
group I.<br>
In the preserved hemopoietic cells of different type (granulocytes, lymphocytes,<br>
normocytes, red blood cells, platelets) the signs of dystrophy and low degree maturity are<br>
ennumberered in the bone marrow puncture biopsies taken after the chemotherapy course.<br>
In blast cells cytoplasm contains ribosomes and it is often vacuolated. Nuclei are large<br>
with diffuse chromatin or accumulations of heterochromatin, occasionally of irregular shape and<br>
with sites drawn inside.<br>
The quantity of specific granules in promyelocytes and myelocytes is insignificant and<br>
cytoplasm often has pronounced dystrophic changes.<br>
In the preserved granulocytes of band and segmented type dystrophic changes and<br>
insignificant amount of specific granules are also observed. The present granules are also often<br>
dystrophically modified and vacuolated.<br>
The preserved normoblasts are often of irregular shape with processes and projections of<br>
cytoplasm.<br>
It should be noted that in puncture bone marrow biopsies especially among granulocytes<br>
cells with apoptosis signs were ennumberered. In such cells margination of heterochromatin, the<br>
signs of nucleus and cytoplasm fragmentation and formation of apoptotic bodies were noted.<br><br>
3. Bone marrow after the chemotherapy with Cyclophosphane and Carboplatin along<br>
with Dicarbarnine administration - group II.<br>
In puncture bone marrow biopsies of patients who underwent the chemotherapy along<br>
with Dicarbarnine administration hemopoietic cells of different degree and type of differentiation<br>
(granulocytes, lymphocytes, platelets, normoblasts) are ennumberered.<br>
The cells of blast type are large, they contain rounded nuclei with diffuse chromatin and<br>
individual nucleoli, their cytoplasm is narrow and therein ribosomes, individual mitochondria<br>
and occasionally single primary dense granules are seen.<br>
There are many promyelocytes and myelocytes comprising rounded or oval nuclei with<br>
diffuse or condensed chromatin; their cytoplasm comprises a rather big amount of specific<br>
granules both primary ones (dark) and less mature ones (more mature).<br>
Band and segmented leukocytes are also frequently ennumberered. The have a concave<br>
(bean-like) or segmented nucleus, abundance of specific granules of predominantly neutrophile<br>
type in their cytoplasm, less often of eosmophile type with crystalloid structures.<br>
Lymphocytes of different differentiation degree comprise in cytoplasm mitochondria,<br>
structures of rough endoplasmic reticulum, occasionally single inclusions in the form of single<br>
granules.<br>
Cells of granulocytic type, lymphocytes often form compact accumulations.<br>
Along with red blood cells, normoblasts of different differentiation degree and relatively<br>
usual shape are ennumberered.<br>
Cells with apoptosis signs are rarely ennumberered.<br>
The same regularities of composition that were earlier described for bone marrow<br>
elements were found in studying hemopoaetic cells of peripheral blood.<br>
The conducted comparative electronic microscopy of bone marrow and peripheral blood<br>
hemopoietic cells in patients with ovarian cancer before and after combined the chemotherapy<br>
(Cyclophosphamide + Carboplatin) and daring the chemotherapy along with Dicarbarnine dosing<br>
allowed establishing mechanisms of its protective effect from cytotoxic influence of the used<br>
preparations.<br>
The study showed that the the chemotherapy preparations used in the present work exert<br>
a pronounced cytotoxic effect on different types of hemopoietic cells of granulocytic, lymphoid<br>
and erythroid lineage.<br>
This cytotoxic effect is expressed in the form of dystrophic changes in cytoplasm and<br>
death of specific granules that develop in bone marrow cells (and respectively peripheral blood).<br>
Said disorders especially concern granulocyte and to a less extent lymphoid cells at early<br>
stages of their differentiation, i.e. formation of blast cells, promyelocytes, myelocytes,<br><br>
lymphoblasts, and they involve erythroid lineage as well that results in insufficient accumulation<br>
of differentiated functionally competent forms of hemopoietic cells.<br>
Further as it was found in the elements of granulocytic lineage the genetically<br>
programmed cell death, i.e. apoptosis is enhanced.<br>
Dystrophic changes and apop:osis generally result in the development of leukopenia,<br>
neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and other disorders of hemopoiesis state and limit capabilities of<br>
the chemotherapy.<br>
Based on the conducted study, Dicarbamine was established to protect hemopoietic cells<br>
of the bone marrow (and respectively peripheral blood) from cytotoxic effect of the used the<br>
chemotherapy preparations, to promote differentiation of young forms to mature cellular<br>
elements and to reduce the events of apoptosis.<br>
As a result of the found effect of Dicarbamine, in the bone marrow of patients during the<br>
chemotherapy accumulation of young (blast) forms of hemopoietic cells occurs and what is<br>
especially important, their differentiation to functionally competent forms is enhanced.<br>
Thus under the conditions of the chemotherapy stimulation of the bone marrow<br>
hemopoietic cells differentiation especially of granulocytic lineage cells, and preventing the<br>
growth of apoptosis are those mechanisms that underlie the protective effect of Dicarbamine.<br>
Example 11. The efficacy of Dicarbamine in respect to reducing hematological toxicity of<br>
the chemotherapy in ovarian cancer<br>
The effect of Dicarbamine was studies in 13 patients with stage III-IV ovarian cancer<br>
who underwent 77 courses of the chemotherapy according to the scheme: 400 mg/m<br>
Carboplatin i.v. drop-wise, once + 600 mg/m2 Cyclophosphan i.v. drop-wise, once; the courses<br>
were repeated in 28 days. Dicarbamine was prescribed daily at dose 100 mg orally after meals<br>
beginning 5 days prior to the first course and then for three weeks. Dosing duration was 26 days,<br>
course dose being 2600 mg. Dicarbamine was given again 5 days prior to second the<br>
chemotherapy course and dosing was continued for 21 days. Total duration of Dicarbamine<br>
intake during two the chemotherapy courses was 52 days.<br>
Hematological toxicity (leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) was assessed in 13<br>
patients who received 77 courses of the chemotherapy with Dicarbamine as compared with the<br>
group of 7 patients who received 25-27 courses of the chemotherapy without Dicarbamibne<br>
(control).<br>
Hemopoiesis parameters were assessed dynamically many times before and after<br>
conducted the chemotherapy (control) as well as dynamically before and after Dicarbamine<br>
dosing in the test group. Below hemopoiesis parameters in individual patients who received the<br>
chemotherapy according to the indicated scheme with Dicarbamine or without it are presented.<br><br>

Complete blood analysis, course 2 of the chemotherapy<br><br>
8.3. Comparative data on hematological toxicity in patients who received the<br>
chemotherapy and those who received or not received Discarbamine are shown in Table 16 and<br><br>
Table 16.<br>
Number (%) of patients with hematological toxicity who received the chemotherapy without<br>
Dicarbamine<br><br><br><br>
Table 17.<br>
Number (%) of patients with hematoi ogical to?dcity who received the chemotherapy with<br>
Dicarbamine<br><br>
The data obtained show that the limiting hematological toxicity of stage III-IV without<br>
use of Dicarbamine (table 16) achieves on the basis of leukopenia over 23.0%, on the basis of<br>
neutropenia 42.3% and by thrombocytopenia 20.0°/!).<br>
In the group of patients who recei ved Dicarbamine the occurrence rate of leuko-, neutro-<br>
and thrombocytopenia was significantly lower (Table 17). Hematological toxicity on the basis of<br>
leukopenia lowered down to 12.9%, i.e. 1.8-fold, on the basis of neutropenia 2.6-fold and on the<br>
basis of thrombocytopenia 2.2-fold. Thus the use Dicarbamine resulted in reducing all the listed<br>
kinds of hematological toxicity.<br>
Below the data are presented supporting the fact that administration of Dicarbamine does<br><br>
not lower therapy efficacy with cytostatic agents but on the contrary enhances to some extent the<br>
effect achieved.<br>
Efficacy of therapy was assessed in groups of patients following two courses of the<br>
chemotherapy with or without Dicarbamine according to the above described scheme. Efficacy<br>
was assessed according to the generally accepted parameters: CR - complete remission, PR -<br>
partial remission, SB - stabilization; and Progr. - progression.<br>
The data obtained are presented in Table 18.<br>
Table 18.<br>
Efficacy of treating patients according to scheme Cyclophosphane + Carboplatin with<br>
Dicarbamine<br><br>
The data presented show that in the group of patients who received the chemotherapy<br>
without Dicarbamine, tumor growth control (CR+PR) amounts to 49.9%. In the group of<br>
patients who received the chemotherapy with Dicarbamine efficacy of therapy is 73.2%.<br>
Thus the use of Dicarbamine in treating patients who receive the chemotherapy results in<br>
reducing main kinds of hematological toxicity without decrease in the efficacy of therapy.<br>
The testal and clinical data presented above evidently prove the efficacy of peptide<br>
derivatives of general formula (I) as non-specific inductors of differentiation that when using<br>
peptide derivatives together with myelosuppressive the chemotherapy is showed by reducing the<br>
degree and number of neutropenias and in use alone results in growth stabilization of murine<br>
hemoblastosis, of differentiating murine and human melanoma including the case of absent<br>
efficacy of the chemotherapy.<br>
The effect of peptide derivatives of general formula (I) on tumor growth was shown to be<br>
associated with delay of proliferation activity of tumor cells and raised degree of differentiation<br>
in particular melanin synthesizing capability of melanoma cells and differentiation induction of<br>
Friend erythroblastosis precursor cells.<br>
Clinical investigations revealed the properties of peptide derivatives of general formula<br>
(I) to significantly lower hematologica toxicity in treating cancer patients using different<br>
schemes of combined the chemotherapy. Thus when treating patients suffering from ovarian<br>
cancer with platinum preparations (Cyclophosphane) along with peptide derivatives, the degree<br><br>
of limiting neutropenia and thrombocytopenia lowered 2-3-fold. At the same time efficacy of<br>
therapy did not lower.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
