				<td>Method and system for optimized reading of a<br>
radio frequency communication transponder with the aid<br>
of a passive resonant circuit.<br>
The invention relates to the field of methods and<br>
systems for reading RF radio frequency transponders and<br>
the structure of such radio frequency transponders.<br>
More particularly, the invention relates to an<br>
improvement in the reading and/or the communications<br>
between a transponder liable to be surrounded by<br>
several transponders and a reader provided for this<br>
purpose. The invention more particularly aims at an<br>
application of such methods and systems to the<br>
contactless reading of electronic travel documents such<br>
as electronic passports and electronic visas in the<br>
form of transponders positioned together. In<br>
particular, such documents and visas are compliant with<br>
ICAO "International Civil Aviation Organization"<br>
specification and the IS07IEC 14443 standard.<br>
The travel documents such as the electronic<br>
passports and/or the electronic visas are composed on<br>
the one hand of a paper document whereon information<br>
relative to the holder of said document is noted and on<br>
the other hand a contactless electronic chip which also<br>
contains secured information relative to the same<br>
holder.<br>
The unsolved problem arises as soon as the travel<br>
document of the electronic passport type must also<br>
include several electronic visas.<br>
As a matter of fact, because of the variable<br>
principles used by such contactless electronic chips,<br>
the increase in the number of electronic visas in the<br><br>
document makes the simultaneous reading more and more<br>
difficult when and as their number increases, which can<br>
even make the operation thereof impossible as soon as<br>
the number is greater than 4 or 5 visas.<br>
The need expressed as regards electronic travel<br>
documents is that said document may contain a maximum<br>
of contactless electronic visas which are<br>
simultaneously operated when they are submitted to a<br>
magnetic field from a contactless reader. The reader<br>
and the travel documents must be compliant with the<br>
ISO/IEC 14443 standard.<br>
The specifications of contactless electronic visa<br>
or visas request that on the one hand each visa<br>
consumes as little as possible magnetic field from the<br>
contactless reader and interacts therewith as little as<br>
possible and on the other hand that each one causes a<br>
variation of said magnetic field which is compatible<br>
with the specifications imposed by the ISO/IEC 14443<br>
standard during the phases of responses from the visa<br>
to the reader.<br>
The contactless technology resulting from the<br>
ISO/IEC 14443 standard describes the mechanisms making<br>
it possible to implement the anti-collision principles<br>
between contactless products. Such principles provide<br>
logical mechanisms which make it possible to retrieve a<br>
contactless product among several others when they are<br>
submitted to the same magnetic field. The condition<br>
required for a correct operation of such principle is<br>
that the reader supplies all the products existing in<br>
the field it generates and that it detects them all.<br>
More particularly, the contactless anti-collision<br>
mechanism is limited by the consumption and the<br><br>
magnetic load induced by the sum of several contactless<br>
transponders. This limits the number of electronic<br>
visas which can be read in or out of an electronic<br>
passport.<br>
In addition, the ISO/IEC 14443 standard contains<br>
a specification imposing that the contactless products<br>
be operated in a range of magnetic field between 1.5<br>
A/m and 7.5 A/m. This specification makes it possible<br>
for contactless products to be operated from a magnetic<br>
field of at least 1.5 A/m.<br>
A standard compliant reader can thus generate<br>
only a 1.5 A/m field in the presence of the travel<br>
document while being conformable with the standard.<br>
The ISO/IEC 14443 standard also imposes the minimum<br>
amplitude of the response of the contactless product so<br>
that the reader can detect it.<br>
Such minimum amplitude is worth at least 30/H1*2<br>
(or 18.6mV), with H amplitude of the magnetic field.<br>
Such value is defined from the amplitude of the side<br>
bands generated because of the amplitude modulation of<br>
the reader magnetic field, with the frequency of<br>
13.56MHz by the contactless product at the rate of the<br>
sub-carrier thereof, rated at 847Khz.<br>
If these conditions are complied with, the<br>
contact reader complying with the standard should be<br>
capable of receiving the data from the contactless<br>
chip.<br>
The present state of the art makes it possible to<br>
comply with all such conditions whenever a maximum<br>
number of a few electronic visas are positioned in the<br>
travel document. At present, 5 visas seem to be a<br>
maximum as regards the curve of the transponders<br><br>
response (Figure 3 retrieved from the official document<br>
N1088 from ISO/IEC JTC1/SC17/WG8).<br>
The inventor noted that if more than five<br>
contactless products which are individually standard<br>
compliant are used, when they are grouped in the same<br>
travel document, because of the electromagnetic<br>
coupling together, the assembly, is no longer compliant<br>
with the ISO/IEC 14443 standard. The conformable<br>
contactless reader is no longer capable of supplying<br>
them or detecting them.<br>
This limitation to five as regards the number of<br>
transponders is considered by the inventor as being<br>
potentially a disadvantage in the development of an<br>
electronic passport and also in a general way for the<br>
reading of several transponders positioned together<br>
whatever the considered application.<br>
Thus the inventor has considered improving in a<br>
general way the contactless communication of a certain<br>
number of transponders for a constant power of the<br>
reader.<br>
As regards the known prior art making it possible<br>
to improve the communication between the transponders<br>
and a reader, the patents FR 2 777 141 or US 6172608<br>
are known.<br>
Such patents make it possible to have a second<br>
oscillating circuit which can be tuned on a frequency<br>
which is close to (or equal to) the electromagnetic<br>
field, so that the modulation of the field performed by<br>
the transponder is better detected by the antenna of<br>
the reader. Such documents more particularly teach the<br>
utilization of a passive resonant circuit for<br>
increasing the communication distance between the<br><br>
reader and the transponder while keeping a correct<br>
operation and without increasing the emission power of<br>
the reader.<br>
On the other hand, the document FR 2 812 482-A1<br>
is known, which uses a collective antenna which is<br>
closed to amplify the communication from the reader<br>
with several transponders positioned on the same<br>
support. The multiplicity of the transponders on a<br>
support corresponds to the problem of increasing the<br>
storage memory available on the support. The<br>
transponders have a more reduced format than the<br>
passive antenna because of the manufacturing cost.<br>
This document does not teach the optimization of the<br>
number of legible transponders for a constant<br>
electromagnetic field power.<br>
In addition, the arrangement of a closed passive<br>
collective antenna associated with several transponders<br>
having more reduced dimensions than the passive antenna<br>
seems not to be operational, as exposed in the present<br>
document in the present state of the art of the person<br>
skilled in the art.<br>
The invention more particularly relates to the<br>
solving of the above-mentioned drawbacks.<br>
It more generally aims at improving the reading<br>
of transponders, such improvements being intended to<br>
lead to the increase in the number of transponders<br>
which can be read together in a determined<br>
electromagnetic field, whatever the dimension thereof.<br>
It also aims at providing the optimization of the<br>
number of transponders which can be read together for<br>
the application to an electronic passport, in<br>
compliance with specifications of the ICAO and<br><br>
ISO/IEC14443, in particular. New transponders<br>
characteristics are supplied for this purpose.<br>
According to a first aspect, the invention aims<br>
at a method for the contactless reading RF transponders<br>
positioned in one and the same magnetic interrogation<br>
field, wherein a magnetic coupling of the transponders<br>
is ensured with a passive resonant circuit during<br>
reading.<br>
The method is characterised in that the passive<br>
antenna of the resonant circuit is associated with at<br>
least one transponder antenna, and the passive resonant<br>
is tuned in such a way that the resonant frequency<br>
resulting from the association corresponds to one of<br>
the frequencies of the emission side bands of the<br>
transponder to be read.<br>
Such provisions make it possible to favor the<br>
amplitude of the transponder return signal.<br>
According to a particular embodiment, the<br>
association of the passive antenna of the resonant<br>
circuit with at least one antenna of the transponder is<br>
made negligible and the passive resonant circuit is<br>
tuned to a resonant frequency corresponding to one of<br>
the frequencies of the emission side bands on the<br>
transponder to be read.<br>
Such provisions make it possible to further<br>
simplify the reading method while favoring the<br>
amplitude of the return signal delivered by the chip of<br>
the antenna module or transponder.<br>
The invention also relates to a system for<br>
reading at least one RF transponder, said system<br>
including a reader able to emit an interrogation field<br>
on at least one transponder and to collect a response<br><br>
from the transponder, a passive resonant circuit for<br>
performing a magnetic coupling with at least one<br>
transponder during the reading.<br>
The system is characterised in that the passive<br>
resonant circuit is tuned in such a way that the<br>
resonant frequency resulting from the association of<br>
the resonant circuit with at least one transponder<br>
corresponds to one of the frequencies of the emission<br>
side bands of the transponder to be read.<br>
Another aspect of the invention relates to a<br>
support object containing at least one main<br>
transponder, at least one secondary transponder and one<br>
passive resonant circuit associated with at least a<br>
main transponder.<br>
The object can be distinguished in that the<br>
passive resonant circuit is tuned in such a way that<br>
the resonant frequency resulting from the association<br>
of the resonant circuit with the main transponder at<br>
least corresponds to one of the frequencies of the<br>
emission side bands of the secondary transponder.<br>
Another aspect of the invention relates to a<br>
support object containing at least one transponder and<br>
a passive resonant circuit associated with at least the<br>
transponder. It can be differentiated in that the<br>
passive resonant circuit is tuned to a resonant<br>
frequency corresponding to one of the frequencies of<br>
the emission side bands of the transponder.<br>
Another aspect of the invention relates to a<br>
transponder including a flat antenna on a support<br>
defining an outer turn;<br>
the transponder is characterised in that:<br><br>
-	the surface outside the outer turn is greater<br>
than a 15 x 15mm surface and smaller than a surface of<br>
approximately 30 x 30mm,<br>
-	the antenna includes approximately between 13<br>
and 18 turns,<br><br>
-	the tuning frequency is between 15 and 18 MHz,<br>
-	a quality factor is above 30.<br>
Another aspect of the invention relates to a<br>
travel document including several pages between two<br>
covers and a plurality of transponders between the<br>
pages, with each transponder being contained in a plane<br>
support distinct from the pages or covers, but having<br>
substantially the same format of a page, with the<br>
transponder having the above characteristics.<br>
According to an advantageous provision making it<br>
possible to have less interference or coupling between<br>
the transponders, the latter are positioned in the<br>
support in various positions and particularly in a<br>
random way.<br>

In Figure 1, an existing system 1 for reading<br>
electronics passport and electronic visas in the form<br>
of transponders of the radio frequency (RF) type<br>
includes a reader able to emit an interrogation field<br>
via an emitting antenna 2 and to collect a response<br>
from the transponder submitted to this field.<br>
The passport 3 (PICIO) and each visa 4 (PCI1-<br>
PICI5) include the same type of transponders, i.e. an<br>
electronic circuit (5a, 5b) of the RF-ID (radio<br>
frequency identification) type connected to an antenna<br>
(4a-4b).<br><br>
In Figure 2, the passport transponder is buried<br>
in the cover 6 of a passport 7 and each electronic visa<br>
transponder is buried in a sheet 8.<br>
In Figure 3, a diagram of voltage response curve<br>
(10) of a transponder with a ID1 format (the format of<br>
present passports) has a peak beyond 35 volts whereas<br>
the voltage response of 5 transponders PICI positioned<br>
together is close to 5 volts. Beyond 5 transponders,<br>
the voltage dramatically drops and it is no longer<br>
possible to detect and to read more than 5 transponders<br>
having a frequency of 13.56MHz.<br>
Generally speaking, within the frame of the<br>
present description, transponder means any<br>
identification electronic circuit using detection or a<br>
communication using an electromagnetic field. More<br>
particularly, electromagnetic fields are concerned and<br>
they include a coil connected to a condenser and where<br>
an integrated circuit or any other electronic<br>
components can be found.<br>
The transponders more particularly include an<br>
electronic component such as an integrated circuit chip<br>
connected to an antenna. They can be inserted into, or<br>
associated with any type of support. They may, for<br>
example, have the shape of adhesive electronic labels,<br>
contactless card; they can be buried in a packaging,<br>
the cover of a document, a sheet or any other thing,<br>
etc.<br>
Transponders are used in various economics fields<br>
such as bank (electronic purse), communications,<br>
transport, identity (e-passport, ID card). More<br>
particularly as regards identity, identifying a person<br>
through a radio frequency communication with a<br><br>
contactless portable electronic object of the RFID<br>
type, is known.<br>
In a general way, reader means within the scope<br>
of the following description, an emitter/receiver<br>
device provided with one antenna which creates an<br>
electromagnetic field at a given frequency. The<br>
antenna of the device also makes it possible to<br>
modulate the electromagnetic field and to measure<br>
variations in the electromagnetic field. The antenna<br>
of the device also makes it possible to modulate the<br>
electromagnetic field and to measure the variations in<br>
the electromagnetic field. The reader antenna is<br>
generally composed of one or several coils.<br>
The reader-transponder system is operated in a<br>
more or less complex way according to the type of the<br>
transponder used. The general operation principle<br>
consists in emitting an electromagnetic field with a<br>
given frequency. When one transponder goes within the<br>
electromagnetic field, it is supplied and it reacts.<br>
The reaction of the transponder causes the variation of<br>
an electromagnetic field which is detected by the<br>
reader.<br>
For the simplest systems, the transponder being<br>
for example composed of one coil and one condenser, the<br>
assembly is an oscillating circuit tuned on the<br>
frequency of the electromagnetic field. The presence<br>
of the transponder in the field makes the oscillating<br>
circuit resonate and causes a modification of the field<br>
which can be detected by the reader. Such systems<br>
which are very simple are currently used as anti-theft<br>
devices in department stores.<br><br>
As regards the most complex systems, the<br>
transponder includes for example an integrated circuit<br>
connected to a coil, the coil and the integrated<br>
circuit forming among other things a tuned resonant<br>
circuit. The presence of the transponder in the<br>
electromagnetic field supplies the integrated circuit<br>
which modulates the electromagnetic field to have the<br>
reader detect the presence thereof. Then, a dialog can<br>
take place between the transponder and the reader<br>
through the modulation of the electromagnetic field.<br>
In Figures 4 and 5, a reading system allows<br>
improvements in the reading of several transponders 13-<br>
16 by implementing during the reading, a magnetic<br>
coupling of the transponders with a passive resonant<br>
circuit 17.<br>
The reading system 12 includes the emission-<br>
reception antenna 18 buried in a support 19 and the<br>
passive resonant circuit 17 is performed on a plane<br>
support 20 for example a paper sheet, and includes an<br>
open antenna 21 the ends of which are connected to<br>
plates 22, 23 of a capacitor. The antenna is in fact a<br>
double face device made by screen printing with a<br>
conductive ink; on the inner face the capacitor plate<br>
24 is opposite two terminal plates 22, 23 connected to<br>
the turns.<br>
The passive circuit is positioned in the above<br>
example of the reader antenna, for example placed or<br>
glued on a support plane close to the radio frequency<br>
antenna of the reader.<br>
According to one implementation system, the<br>
passive antenna of the resonant circuit is associated,<br>
at least during the reading, with at least one<br><br>
transponder antenna. Association means a physical<br>
bringing together of their positions so as to obtain a<br>
magnetic coupling therebetween with or without a common<br>
support.<br>
According to one step on the method, the passive<br>
resonant circuit is tuned to a resonant frequency so<br>
that the resonant frequency resulting from the<br>
association with at least one transponder antenna<br>
corresponds to one of the frequencies of the emission<br>
side bands of the transponder to be read.<br>
The advantage consists in favoring the detection,<br>
by the reader, of the variations in the field caused by<br>
the transponders when they respond.<br>
Preferably, the transponders are designed or<br>
configured so as to be neglected in the association<br>
with the passive resonant circuit, each more<br>
particularly by drawing less magnetic field and/or by<br>
interfering less with the other transponder antennas.<br>
The transponders, for this purpose, have a reduced<br>
format as compared to the antenna of the passive<br>
resonant circuit. In the example, the transponder is<br>
one or several of the transponders 13-16 with the small<br>
dimension to be read as compared to the antenna. The<br>
reduced format of the transponders is for example less<br>
than 1/10°, even 1/5°, the format of the passive<br>
resonant circuit antenna.<br>
The advantage consists in allowing the supply of<br>
as many transponders as possible with the same field<br>
density.<br>
Thus, in the example above, as this association<br>
is negligible in so far as there is no significant<br>
influence of small transponders on the resonant<br><br>
frequency resulting from the association, the resonant<br>
circuit is tuned to a frequency corresponding to one of<br>
the frequencies of the emission side band of the<br>
transponder to be read.<br>
The emission side bands are generated by any<br>
other transponder submitted to an interrogation<br>
magnetic field that the transponder modulates more<br>
particularly in amplitude, during its response.<br>
The side bands exist for other principles of<br>
modulations of the communication between a reader and a<br>
transponder, more particularly the phase modulation and<br>
frequency modulation.<br>
In the example, an amplitude modulation of a<br>
sine-wave signal having a 13.56MHZ frequency by a<br>
847Khz modulating signal corresponding to the sub-<br>
carrier generated by the transponder creates, from a<br>
spectral point of view, a signal with two side bands<br>
located at 13.56MHz +/-847KHz or 12.71 and 14.4MHz<br>
respectively.<br>
Other side bands as other than those hereabove<br>
are also generated but with less energy.<br>
In order to favor as much as possible the<br>
detection by the reader and reach the minimum level of<br>
retro-modulated field defined by the ISO/IEC 14443<br>
standard the resonance frequency of the passive<br>
resonant circuit is selected at 14.4MHz, i.e. 13.56MHz<br>
+847KHZ.<br>
Other examples of association will be<br>
subsequently illustrated.<br>
According to another implement, at least one<br>
format F of the transponder antenna and one transponder<br>
response having a behavior or characteristics<br><br>
corresponding to this format are determined and then<br>
the passive resonant circuit is configured in such a<br>
way as to obtain the behavior of the characteristics<br>
corresponding to such format for each transponder.<br>
The passive antenna has thus been voluntarily<br>
defined in an area Z (Fig. 6) between two rectangles<br>
25, 26 centered on each other and in the IDl format<br>
described in the ISO/IEC 14443 standard, respectively<br>
81mm x 49mm and 64mm x 34 mm.<br>
The advantage consists in obtaining a response<br>
from small transponders having the same characteristics<br>
as the big ones while allowing a reading of more<br>
transponders with a constant interrogation field.<br>
This makes it possible to meet the specifications<br>
of the ICAO in order to allow the reading to a greater<br>
number of transponders, and a travel document 27 (Fig.<br>
7) of the e-passport or e-Visa is manufactured and<br>
includes the passive antenna (or passive resonant<br>
circuit 17 composed of one or several conductive<br>
tracks) more particularly in the cover of the passport.<br>
This travel document can shelter one or several<br>
transponder or transponders 13 to 16, each taking the<br>
part of the local field induced by the passive resonant<br>
circuit submitted to the field of the reader plus the<br>
part of the field which is radiated by the antenna of<br>
the reader about the surface of the antenna module or<br>
modules 13-16.<br>
Figures 8 and 9 illustrate the system for reading<br>
the travel document. It includes, as above, a reading<br>
support 19 containing an emitting and receiving antenna<br>
18 connected to means 28 for processing and operating<br>
the signal received.<br><br>
The resonant circuit 17 is here fixed under the<br>
reading support. The advantage is to have a common<br>
circuit at the level of the reader for all the<br>
passports whereas in the example in Figure 7, each<br>
document including such resonant circuit, it is not<br>
indispensable to have it at the reading level.<br>
In the example, conformably with the provisions<br>
of ICAO, the amplitude of the magnetic field H of the<br>
reader is determined at a value above or equal to 1.5<br>
A/m and the amplitude of the transponder response to a<br>
value above or equal to 30/H1'2.<br>
The travel document includes a large dimensioned<br>
transponder 3 for example ID1 and several transponders<br>
13-16 of smaller dimensions such as electronic visas.<br>
The antenna modules 13-16 are not necessarily<br>
positioned on the same plane as those on which the<br>
passive antenna is positioned.<br>
In Figure 8, the passive resonant circuit 17 is<br>
positioned out of the travel document. It is<br>
associated with the reading system by being fixed under<br>
the reading support.<br>
However, it could be positioned close to it, more<br>
particularly close to or stuck onto the reading<br>
support.<br>
The passive resonant circuit can have the shape<br>
of a label stuck on the document more particularly with<br>
an adhesive. It can be integrated in the document more<br>
particularly in one of the pages or the covers thereof.<br>
The transponders to be read (13-16, 3) are in the<br>
travel document 27B. In such a document, reduced<br>
dimensions, so-called secondary transponders, and large<br>
dimensions, so-called main transponders can be found.<br><br>
In this case, as indicated while referring to Figure 10<br>
described infra, it is recommended to tune the passive<br>
resonant circuit while considering the association with<br>
the main circuit.<br>
The energy and coupling balance of such a<br>
solution cannot be compared with the balance obtained<br>
by ID1 dimension transponders which are compatible with<br>
ISO/IEC14443. Each antenna-module is separately<br>
perceived by the reader as having a format and thus an<br>
action on the magnetic field of the reader which<br>
corresponds to that of the passive antenna which is<br>
itself in compliance with the standard ID1 for the<br>
travel documents.<br>
The geometric and electric characteristics, on<br>
the one hand, of the passive resonant circuit and the<br>
antenna-module preferably corresponding to the<br>
following description, on the other hand, exist.<br>
As regards the reader and also the test devices<br>
such as those described in the test methods for<br>
contactless products: ISO/IEC 10373-6, the travel<br>
document including several electronic visas must be<br>
considered as only one contactless product.<br>
The following preferable principles aiming at<br>
making a passive resonant circuit to be included in the<br>
travel document of the electronic passport type are the<br>
results thereof.<br>
The passive resonant circuit must be such that<br>
the couple thereof with the reader causes an effect<br>
complying with the contactless card equipped with a IDl<br>
format antenna.<br>
It must cause a low load on the electromagnetic<br>
field generated by the reader. Such load must<br><br>
correspond to that caused by the reference PICC,<br>
appendix D of the ISO/IEC 10373-6 standard adjusted on<br>
6Volt for Hmin. The loading induced by the transponder<br>
corresponds to an ID1 antenna tuned on 13.56Mhz and<br>
including a resistive part of 1.8kQ and the continuous<br>
voltage of which is the result of an interrogation<br>
field of less than 6V at the load terminals.<br>
This results in the resonant circuit having the<br>
following geometric characteristics.<br>
As described hereabove, the passive antenna has<br>
thus been voluntarily defined in a zone Z between two<br>
rectangles 25, 26 centered on each other and on the ID1<br>
format described in the ISO/IEC 14443 standard,<br>
respectively 81mm x 49mm and 64mm x 34mm (Fig. 6).<br>
In order not to limit too much the field<br>
generated by the contactless reader, the quality factor<br>
on the passive resonant circuit is voluntarily limited<br>
to a value of less than 30.<br>
The optimum quality coefficient of such resonant<br>
circuit for meeting the conditions described hereabove<br>
is between 10 and 20. The optimum value of the quality<br>
factor of the passive resonant circuit is 20. This<br>
allows drawing technologies for an antenna with a<br>
strong electric resistance such as screen printing<br>
using silver ink or carbon ink. Because of the<br>
necessity for an overvoltage factor, the passive<br>
resonant circuit must be composed of an antenna<br>
composed of several terms and connected to a capacitor.<br>
The passive resonant circuit must supply to the<br>
electromagnetically coupled antenna-modules, the<br>
additional energy which they require because of their<br>
small coupling surfaces with the reader. The passive<br><br>
resonant circuit mu3t generate an additional local<br>
field as a complement to that delivered by the reader<br>
which supplies the antenna modules.<br>
On the other hand (Fig. 11) the transponder 13<br>
can be made in the form of an antenna module complying<br>
with the chip card technology. It includes a flat<br>
antenna 29 on an isolating support 30 (dielectric film)<br>
in a plane and is connected to an integrated circuit<br>
chip 31. The chip may include a protective coating<br>
resin 32 or not. The assembly may have a global<br>
thickness of less than 1mm.<br>
The antenna 29 is preferably made of a metal wire<br>
or copper etching so as to have a good quality factor.<br>
The transponder will advantageously have a<br>
reasonable size for example 25mm in length, 15mm in<br>
width and include an antenna of about fifteen turns for<br>
example between 13 and 18 turns. The number of turns<br>
will slightly depend on the selected chip.<br>
Each turn for example made of copper has for<br>
example a width of the order of 50 to 300um with a<br>
spacing between two contiguous turns of the order of 50<br>
to 200um.<br>
A compromise or optimization between the surface<br>
ratio is still to be reached. A module-antenna having<br>
too small a surface for example of less than 10mm by<br>
10mm would require a very accurate positioning with<br>
respect to the passive resonance circuit in order to<br>
allow a correct operation which a priori excludes the<br>
devices based on antennas directly made on the surface<br>
of the chip.<br>
A contrario, a module-antenna having dimensions<br>
above 30mm by 30mm would consume too much magnetic<br><br>
field and would be too coupled to the other modules<br>
having an antenna to allow the operation of several<br>
integrated circuit chips or electronic visas.<br>
The ideal solution is a resonance frequency of<br>
transponders amounting to 17MHz.<br>
Considering the geometry of the transponders, the<br>
resonance frequency and the number of the turns, the<br>
number of the passive resonance circuit turns is<br>
optimum for 4 turns. The surface of the capacitor<br>
plates is so calculated as to make the frequency<br>
tuning, as mentioned hereabove.<br>
In Figure 10, the passive resonant circuit 17 is<br>
associated with a transponder having an antenna, the<br>
dimensions of which can be compared to those of the<br>
passive circuit. The importance thereof is such that<br>
it must be considered within the tuning in frequency of<br>
the passive resonant circuit.<br>
As a matter of fact, the resultant resonance<br>
frequency of two circuits is defined by the following<br>
relation:<br>
where k: the coupling coefficient between the<br>
transponders (equal to 1 if the coupling is the maximum<br>
one)<br>
fres.2: resonance frequency resulting from the<br>
association of two transponders having the same<br>
resonance frequency "fres".<br>
This could be for example the ID1 format<br>
transponder such as presently positioned in the cover<br>
of the electronic passport of the prior art or one of<br>
the electronic visas in the ID1 format as in Figure 2.<br><br>
The passive resonant circuit is so tuned that the<br>
resonance frequency resulting from the association M<br>
corresponds to one of the frequencies of the emission<br>
side bands of the transponder to be read.<br>
The two associated elements can be grouped<br>
together in the same support, for example a cover 6A of<br>
the travel document.<br>
Due to the extension of this principle, the<br>
association may concern several transponders so long as<br>
the number thereof gives them a non-negligible<br>
importance.<br>
According to an advantageous provision<br>
illustrated in Figures 12 and 13, each electronic visa<br>
is positioned in a support 33, 34, for example a sheet<br>
which is substantially of the same format as the<br>
document or slightly smaller. In the application to<br>
the passport, the support is in the IDl format or<br>
slightly smaller. The important thing is not leaving<br>
the choice to the user when it is applied into the<br>
document.<br>
This transponder support 33 must be placed in the<br>
document or stuck onto a page more particularly using a<br>
self-adhesive coating.<br>
The transponder 13 is positioned in a random<br>
position inside the support upon the manufacturing of<br>
the visa more particularly through lamination. In<br>
Figure 12, it is positioned along the left side edge 35<br>
whereas it is positioned along the right side edge 36<br>
in Figure 13. Thus, when both sheets are superimposed,<br>
the transponders get less coupled together.<br>
An embodiment of the transponders must include,<br>
for this purpose, a step and means for the random or<br><br>
varied position of the transponder on the surface of a<br>
transporter support sheet for example during the<br>
lamination of sheet sandwiching the transponder.<br>
Thus, when it is copied in the travel document,<br>
it is distributed also in a random way with respect to<br>
the other transponders. The result is that the labels<br>
are all different as regards the magnetic point of view<br>
and they can be more easily operated even though they<br>
are superimposed.<br>
Thus, thanks to the invention, it is possible to<br>
make the application of an electronic Visa with a more<br>
important number of electronic visas possible. The<br>
preferred characteristics, as mentioned hereabove, make<br>
it possible to read up to 15 transponders complying<br>
with the ICAO specifications.<br>
The reading method can implement an anti-<br>
collision mechanism or protocol of a known type more<br>
particularly the one described in the standard. The<br>
mechanism can be triggered by the reader processing<br>
means.<br>
According to another aspect, the invention makes<br>
it possible to produce an electronic travel document.<br>
This document is supposed to include a plurality of<br>
transponders complying with constraints or<br>
specifications more particularly resulting from the<br>
standard (ICAO) which impose at least one ID1 format of<br>
transponder antenna, a minimum amplitude of the<br>
magnetic field H for the reading and a minimum<br>
amplitude for the response from the transponders.<br>
According to this other aspect, the transponder<br>
is made with an antenna format smaller than the IDl<br>
format and said transponder is so arranged with a<br><br>
passive resonant circuit and a capacitor and a passive<br>
antenna with an ID1 format, so that the transponder is<br>
seen by the reader as a ID1 format transponder.<br>
The travel document according to the invention<br>
may include several pages and a plurality of<br>
transponders between the pages, with each transponder<br>
being contained in a plane support separate from the<br>
pages but substantially having the format of a page of<br>
the document.<br>
This document can easily be read by all the<br>
transponders in so far as the transponders are<br>
positioned in the supports in various positions.<br>
Consequently, the invention is also characterised<br>
by an assembly or a set of transponders, more<br>
particularly for electronic visas, in that each<br>
transponder is positioned in a sheet (33, 34) having a<br>
bigger format than the format and in that the<br>
transponders are positioned in the sheets (33, 34) in<br>
various positions from one sheet to another.<br>
Although the invention has mainly been described<br>
in relation with a travel document, it can be applied<br>
to any object supporting a passive resonant circuit<br>
associated to at least one transponder such as for<br>
example an electronic label, a chip card including a<br>
module-antenna associated with a passive resonant<br>
circuit the antenna of which has the dimensions of the<br>
contactless chip ID1.<br>
Such objects are preferably portable devices such<br>
as a chip card or a cell phone.<br>
The passive antenna can be included in the body<br>
of the chip card, more particularly about the module<br>
antenna inserted in a standard cavity of the chip card.<br><br>
The passive antenna together with the resonant circuit<br>
can also be integrated in the reader.<br><br>
