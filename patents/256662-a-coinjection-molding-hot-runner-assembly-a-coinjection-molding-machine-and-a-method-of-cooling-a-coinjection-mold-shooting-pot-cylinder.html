				<td> The present invention relates to coinjection molding shooting pot apparatus.<br>
The present invention relates to  coinjection  molding shooting pot apparatus and method that cools the shooting pot cylinder, thereby raising the viscosity of the melt therein, thus reducing leakage of the melt between the shooting pot cylinder wall and the shooting pot piston.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Coinjection molding is typically used to mold multi-layered plastic packaging articles having a laminated wall structure. Each layer is typically passed through a different annular or circular passageway in a single nozzle structure and each layer is partially, sequentially, injected through the same mold gate. Some coinjection hot runner systems include shooting pots to meter material of one plastic resin so that each cavity of a multi-cavity mold receives an accurate dose of that resin in the molding cycle., A shooting pot piston within the shooting pot cylinder is actuated to discharge the resin into a hot runner manifold, which carries the resin to the coinjection nozzle and then into the mold cavity.<br>
Often,  a substantial amount of resin drools through  the<br>
clearance between _the shooting pot cylinder and the piston during normal molding operations, when the shooting pot is pressurized and the resin is at high temperature.  This drool typically increases with the increase of the piston-to-cylinder wall clearance and with the cylinder temperature.  The drool also increases with the decrease of the permanent engagement between the piston and the cylinder wall.   Any significant leakage of the resin not only reduces the accuracy of the shot size being injected, but also wastes expensive resin and causes a build-up of degraded resin in the space between the shooting pot  cylinder  exterior  wall  and  the  manifold plate  that eventually  requires  stopping  the  operation  for  cleanup. Decreasing the piston-to-cylinder clearance close to a line-to-line fit is not advantageous because of the high risk of the<br><br>
piston seizing inside the cylinder. Also, increasing the piston-to-cylinder engagement in an attempt to minimize drool is often limited by the constraints on the size of the mold.<br>
Attempts have been made to minimize the resin leakage past the shooting pot piston by adjusting the respective sizes of the piston's exterior diameter and the cylinder's interior diameter. A variety of such "sliding fit" tolerance combinations can be tried until the resin leakage is minimized to an acceptable level. However, this fit may have to be readjusted for different resins and for operating the system at different process temperatures where thermal expansion may cause the effectiveness of the "sliding fit" to change. Furthermore this "cut and try" approach is costly as each attempt requires dismantling the hot runner.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,717,324 to Schad discloses a coinjection hot runner assembly with shooting pots. The shooting pot chambers are an integral part of the hot runner manifold that is a heated component of the assembly. The shooting pot pistons that operate within the shooting pots must both slide and seal throughout their operating stroke. There is no disclosure of providing cooling or even lowering the temperature of the piston/shooting pot wall interface to reduce leakage.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,241,932 to Choi shows, in Figure 1, a conventional two stage (preplasticizing) injection unit including a shooting pot and piston assembly. There is no disclosure of cooling the rear end of the shooting pot to minimize leakage or drooling.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,527,539 to Ujma teaches a shooting pot configuration of an injection molding machine. There is no disclosure of cooling the rear end of the shooting pot to minimize leakage or drooling.<br>
Thus, what is needed is a coinjection molding shooting pot structure which substantially reduces leakage between the shooting pot piston and the shooting pot cylinder wall, and is relatively inexpensive to design, install, and maintain.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an advantage of the present invention to overcome the problems of the related art and to provide a coinjection shooting pot structure which efficiently minimizes melt leakage between the shooting pot piston and the shooting pot cylinder wall by cooling appropriate portions of the shooting pot structure to increase the viscosity of the melt to reduce the leakage .<br>

A heat sink sleeve is disposed to contact an outer surface of a rear portion of the shooting pot cylinder.

Figure 1 is a partial sectional view of a coinjection hot runner assembly showing a shooting pot assembly according to a first embodiment according to the present invention.<br>
Figure 2 shows an alternate embodiment of the shooting pot cylinder cooling feature.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)<br>
1.  Introduction<br>
The present invention will now be described with respect to several embodiments in which a plastic resin coinjection molding machine has first and second shooting pots which respectively inject "A" and "C" resins through different coinjection nozzle melt channels into a mold cavity. However, the present invention may find applicability in other injection molding applications as well, such as injection molding of<br><br>
metals, composites, etc.  The below description will generally be limited to a discussion of a single shooting pot.  However, it is to be understood that this description could apply to one or more of the shooting pots in a coinjection molding machine.<br>
Briefly, the preferred embodiments of the present invention provide for cooling at least one shooting pot cylinder by use of a heat transfer sleeve adjacent the shooting pot cylinder. Such a configuration thus relies on melt viscosity to reduce leakage, controls the leakage thermally and not mechanically, and eliminates the need to use tight tolerances between the piston and cylinder. Moreover, since there is no change in the shooting pot geometry when fine tuning the cooling features (i.e., by modifying the heat sink sleeve geometry, the contact surface with the plate, or the contact surface with the shooting pot), lowering the temperature in the top of the cylinder to precisely below the no-flow temperature of the resin can reduce the leakage significantly. The preferred embodiments also accommodate for heat expansion of the hot runner manifold as well as for that of the shooting pot by utilizing a spring for producing a loaded contact between the hot shooting pot and the cool plate through heat-sink sleeve.<br>
2.  The Structure of the First Embodiment<br>
Figure 1 shows a portion of a coinjection hot runner assembly and mold comprising, in part, a first hot runner manifold 1, a second hot runner manifold 2, a nozzle housing 3, a cooled manifold plate 4, a shooting pot cylinder 5, a shooting pot piston 6, a heat-sink sleeve 7, a retaining ring 8, and a spring 9. The hot runner manifolds 1 and 2 are heated by heaters 10, and the manifold plate 4 is cooled by coolant flowing through cooling channels 11. The second melted plastic resin "C" is conveyed through second melt channels 12 in the heated second manifold 2 to the nozzle 3. A check valve assembly 13 is located in one end of the shooting pot cylinder 5 such that the incoming resin "C" from an inlet channel 14 is prevented from backflowing when the shooting pot piston 6 is advanced to inject the resin "C" into the mold cavity via the second hot runner melt channel 12 and the corresponding coinjection nozzle melt channel 26. Preferably, there is a<br><br>
thermally insulative air gap 15 that separates the manifolds from their surrounding plates.<br>
The diametric sizing of the piston 6 in the shooting pot cylinder 5 is such that the piston 6 is able to slide without allowing a substantial amount of the resin contained therein from leaking past the piston sidewall. For example, a clearance of 10 to 20 microns allows the piston 6 to freely travel inside the shooting pot cylinder 5. The resin between the piston sidewall and the piston cylinder wall acts like a lubricant.<br>
By providing the heat sink sleeve 7 to cool the rearward end of the shooting pot cylinder 5, a more certain "sliding fit" configuration can be reliably provided. The heat sink sleeve 7 provides a path for heat to be thermally conducted from the rear end of the shooting pot cylinder 5 to the cooled manifold plate 4. This decreases the temperature of the resin "C", increasing its viscosity and preventing substantial leakage past the piston walls. The heat-sink sleeve 7 is tightly fitted (e.g., a 5 to 10 micron clearance fit) around the shooting pot cylinder 5 to be able to slide axially therealong and provide thermal expansion accommodation while keeping intimate contact with shooting pot cylinder for effective heat transfer.<br>
The heat sink sleeve 7 is retained in position on the shooting pot cylinder's external diameter by the retaining ring 8 and the spring 9 acting against a shoulder 16, which constantly urges the heat-sink sleeve 7 against its seat 19 in the manifold plate 4 to enhance the cooling. By cooling this rear portion of the shooting pot cylinder wall, any resin leakage between the wall's interior surface and the piston will be cooled sufficiently to reduce its flow significantly, thereby virtually eliminating leakage, without denying the lubricating properties the resin provides to the shooting pot action. The thermal profile of the shooting pot cylinder is a function of the areas of contact between the heat sink sleeve 7 with the cooled manifold plate 4 and with the shooting pot cylinder itself. These contact areas are optimized to produce (i) a<br><br>
temperature below the no-flow temperature of the resin "C" in the area of the piston inside the shooting pot cylinder 5 where these two components are permanently in contact, and (ii) a temperature equivalent to the molding temperature of the resin in the rest of the cylinder (metering area).<br>
The cooling of the shooting pot cylinder 5 can be fine tuned by judicious selection of the material(s) which comprise the heat sink sleeve 7, the longitudinal length and radial width (outside diameter minus inside diameter) of the sleeve, the shape of the sleeve (the inner surface thereof may be profiled with sinusoidal or stepped shapes), the closeness and extent of the contact between the sleeve 'and the cooled manifold plate and the cylinder wall, etc. Preferably, the heat sink sleeve 7 is made of tool steel, has a longitudinal length of 6-12 mm, an inside diameter of 10 mm, and an outside diameter of 20 mm. Preferably, the area that the sleeve 7 contacts the cooled manifold plate 4 is the same area as it contacts the outside diameter of the cylinder wall. Preferably, the sleeve 7 contacts the cylinder wall 5 throughout the entire inner surface of the sleeve. If desired, the sleeve 7 can be provided with cooling fins, cooling channels with coolant flowing therein, or other cooling aids, etc.<br>
3.  The Process of the First Embodiment<br>
In operation, the shooting pot cylinder 5 is charged with resin "C" by an injection unit (not shown) feeding the resin through the inlet channel 14, past the check valve 13. This infeeding resin causes the shooting pot piston 6 to move away from the check valve 13, extending outwardly from the shooting pot cylinder 5. When the shooting pot piston 6 is stopped by its actuation rod (not shown) at a predetermined position, this limits the shot size of the resin in the shooting pot cylinder<br>
5	to a volume created by the piston's rearward movement.  At<br>
the appropriate time in the molding cycle,  the shooting pot<br>
piston 6 is moved forward by the actuating rod acting on the<br>
exposed end 18 of piston 6.  The forward movement of the piston<br>
6	displaces the resin "C" from the shooting pot cylinder 5 via<br>
the channel 12 and the nozzle melt channel 26 and into the mold<br>
cavity through the mold gate.   The check valve 13 prevents<br><br>
backf lowing of the resin into the inlet channel 14. At each infeeding of the resin into the shooting pot cylinder 5, the heat sink sleeve 7 extracts sufficient heat to reduce the resin temperature and increase its viscosity to a point where leakage past the piston wall is substantially prevented.<br>
4.	The Structure of the Second Embodiment<br>
A shooting pot cylinder 20 containing a shooting pot piston 21 is surrounded by a heat-sink sleeve 24 having a bore that has a sliding fit to the outer diameter of the shooting pot cylinder 20. The sleeve 24 is located in a recessed seat in a cooled manifold plate 25 and held in place by a retainer ring 22 and a spring washer 23 that constantly urges the sleeve 24 against its seat in the manifold plate, thereby ensuring good contact for thermally conducting heat from the shooting pot cylinder wall to the plate while allowing the shooting pot cylinder to thermally expand and slide within the bore of the heat-sink sleeve 24. This alternate embodiment does not require the shoulder 16 of the Figure 1 configuration and thereby makes a slightly less costly component.<br>
5.	Conclusion<br>
Advantageous  features  according  to  the  present  invention<br>
include:<br>
•  A coinjection hot runner assembly with a least one shooting<br>
pot cylinder having a cooling feature near its rear end to<br>

The individual components shown in outline or designated by blocks in the attached Drawings are all well-known in the injection molding arts, and their specific construction and operation are not critical to the operation or best mode for carrying out the invention.<br><br>
