				<td>A CASE FOR RECEIVING AND DISPENSING PILLS<br>
Related Application<br>
This Application claims the priority benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent<br>
Application Serial No. 60/500,207 filed September 4, 2003.<br>
Field Of The Invention<br>
The present invention is relates to a case, and more particularly a case having<br>
at least one article receiving sleeve which may be removably or permanently<br>
secured within the case. The sleeve is used to store and dispense the article such<br>
as a pill.<br>
Background Of The Invention<br>
Pill cases are known in the art and typically contain a plurality of pills which<br>
can be accessed by the user as needed. Pill cases known in the art are desirably<br>
compact so that they can be carried by the user in a purse or in a shirt pocket or<br>
other convenient location.<br>
Some users are required to take medication for extended periods of time.<br>
Examples of such medications include medicines for treating chronic illnesses such<br>
as elevated blood pressure, cardiac deficiencies, arthritis, illnesses in which pain is<br>
part of an on-going treatment plan, and the like. In addition, life-style related<br>
medications such as birth control pills, hormone replacement pills and the like also<br>
require long term, periodic use.<br>
Pill storage/dispensing devices, especially for long term use medications,<br>
typically suffer from a number of disadvantages. One such device is a container<br>
typically used by pharmacies to fill prescriptions for medications. These containers<br>
are disadvantageous because the pills can be adversely affected (e.g. chipped or<br>
broken) by unwanted contact with other pills and can easily fall out of the container<br>
when attempting to dispense a typical dose of one or two pills. In addition, such<br>
containers do not enable the user to readily visualize how many pills remain in the<br>
container. Some pill dispensers are typically limited to a fixed number of pills before<br>
they must be replaced and therefore can only be used for relatively short term<br>
prescription periods (e.g. no more than 30 days).<br>
Other pill storage/dispensing cases are shown and described in U.S. Design<br>
Patent Nos. Des. 339,742; Des. 358,762; Des. 411,445; Des. 414,106; and Des.<br>
423,111; as well as U.S. Patent Nos. 3,414,119; 5,348,158; 5,351,818; 5,368,187;<br>
5,372,258; 6,036,018; 6,173,838; and 6,219,997 each of which is incorporated<br>
herein by reference.<br>
Some pill dispensing/storage cases now employ blister cards or blister packs<br>
which house a preselected number of pills and which protect each pill so that they<br>
cannot be broken by contact with other pills. The blister cards store pills in spaced<br>
apart pill receiving cavities which are then sealed using a protective cover such as<br>
coated paper, foil, plastic or the like. The pills may be removed from the cavities by<br>
piercing the cover or by applying pressure to one side of the covered pill until the pill<br>
bursts through the protective cover. More detailed descriptions of blister cards or<br>
packs are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,368,187; 6,036,018;<br>
6,219,997; and 6,338,408, each of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Despite these efforts there remains the need for a pill storage/dispensing device that<br>
a) is compact, b) easily opened to gain access to the pills, c) capable of<br>
accommodating pills for extensive prescription periods, d) capable of<br>
accommodating sleeves for receiving different pills and/or dosage regimens and e)<br>
wherein the sleeves can accommodate multiple blister cards or packs, which are<br>
either permanently or removably secured to the pill case.<br>
It would therefore be a significant advantage in the art to provide users an<br>
opportunity to house medications in a pill storing/dispensing device which can readily<br>
house individual pills in separate compartments and which facilitates dispensing of<br>
the desired dose of pills. It would also be an advantage in the art if the pill containing<br>
device can house a varying quantity of pills depending on the particular requirements<br>
of the medication and the dosage regimen required by the user which may be in the<br>
form of blister cards which have varying numbers of pills such as may be used for<br>
dispensing oral contraceptive medications.<br>
It would be a further advantage in the art to provide a pill storage/dispensing<br>
device having multiple sleeves, where each" sleeve receives and dispenses a<br>
number of pills corresponding to a particular dosage regimen, ft would be a further<br>
advantage in the art if the device can accommodate relative long term prescriptions<br>
{e.g. more than 30 days) and it would be a still further advantage in the art if the pill<br>
case can be in a compact form, easy to carry and store in a purse, shirt pocket or the<br>
like.<br>
Summary Of The Invention<br>
The present invention is generally directed to a case which provides for at<br>
least one pill receiving sleeve which may be removably or permanently secured to a<br>
spine. Each sleeve may be independently replaced by removing the same from the<br>
spine when the pills received therein have been dispensed or the entire case may be<br>
discarded when all of the pills in the sleeves have been consumed. The case<br>
provides for multiple pill receiving sleeves which may optionally be secured to each<br>
other or to a top or bottom cover to enable access to an individual pill receiving<br>
sleeve as desired.<br>
Each pill receiving sleeve may be adapted to receive a plurality of pills which<br>
may be matched with a particular dosage regimen particularly suited for the user.<br>
For example, if the user requires two pills a day, then one or more sleeves may<br>
contain 14 pills (covering one week) or 60 pil/s (covering one month). The use of<br>
multiple sleeves can therefore accommodate long term prescriptions. The pills can<br>
be secured to the sleeves in a variety of ways including the use of blister cards or<br>
packs. When using a blister card, the pills are individually stored in blister cards or<br>
packs which fit within the sleeve and may be readily removed therefrom.<br>
Alternatively, the sleeves per se may be provided with the pills of the dosage<br>
regimen (i.e. the pills are not packaged in a blister card). The sleeves may be easily<br>
removed from the case when all of the piils of one sleeve have been consumed and<br>
replaced by another sleeve which may contain the same or different medication<br>
accordingly to need or the case may be discarded after all of the pills have been<br>
consumed.<br>
It will be understood that reference to the term "pill" as used herein snail<br>
include not only pills of a variety of shapes and sizes but all forms of dispensable<br>
products or articles of manufacture such as medications which can effectively be<br>
housed in the device of the present invention including tablets, capsules, lozenges,<br>
caplets and the like. Likewise, all reference to a "pill case" shall mean a case which<br>
can accommodate the dispensable product or article of manufacture. The term "pill<br>
receiving sleeve" shall mean a sleeve or tray which can receive a blister card or<br>
blister pack containing prepackaged pills or which can itself contain pills which may<br>
be dispensed therefrom without the use of a blister card.<br>
The case may optionally have a top cover and a bottom cover which are used<br>
to protect the sleeves and may be readily separated from the sleeves to gain access<br>
to the sleeves and the pills received therein. The top and bottom covers are<br>
reversibly engageable so that the top and bottom covers may be moved from a<br>
closed position to an open position, exposing the pill receiving sleeves. In an<br>
optional feature of the present invention, the sleeves may reversibly engage the top<br>
and/or bottom covers in a manner such that when the top and bottom covers are<br>
moved to an open position, only one pill receiving sleeve may be exposed.<br>
In one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a case, comprising a<br>
spine and at least one, more typically a plurality of sleeves, with each of the sleeves<br>
being configured to receive and dispense at least one article of manufacture (e.g.,<br>
pills) therefrom such as, for example, via a blister card containing a plurality of pills.<br>

position so that each pill of the plurality of pills may be dispensed from one of the<br>
plurality of apertures; and<br>
a spine comprising a sleeve engaging locking assembly operatively<br>
engaging the at least one sleeve at the rearvvard edge so that the at least one sleeve is<br>
secured to the spine and can be accessed to dispense the pills contained therein,<br>
wherein the sleeve engaging locking assembly comprises at least one channel, and the<br>
at least one sleeve comprises at least one spine engaging projection adapted to be<br>
removably secured within the at least one channel to secure the sleeve within the case.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a case for<br>
receiving and dispensing pills, comprising:<br>
a top cover having a forward edge and a rearward edge;<br>
a bottom cover having a forward edge and a rearward edge;<br>

Detailed Description Of The Invention<br>
The present invention is directed to a case (e.g., pill case) with at least one<br>
article receiving sleeve (e.g.. pill receiving sleeve) secured therein by a sleeve<br>
engaging locking assembly in which the sleeves are operatively engaged to the<br>
sleeve engaging iocking assembly.<br>
It will be understood that the present invention can be used to store and<br>
dispense a variety of articles such as gum, confections, and the like. For illustrative<br>
purposes, reference hereinafter will be to a pill case for dispensing pills. As will be<br>
explained hereinafter, the pili receiving sleeves may be permanently affixed to the pill<br>
case or replaceable as desired. The pili receiving sleeves may be easily engaged<br>
and optionally disengaged from the sleeve engaging locking assembly to enable<br>
users, even those suffering from the loss of manual dexterity, to easily remove pills<br>
from the pill receiving sleeve and optionally replace pill receiving sleeves with a new<br>
full set of pills contained therein as needed. The pills may be individually stored in<br>
blister cards or packs, which fits within the sleeve and may be readily dispensed<br>
therefrom.<br>
Referring to the drawings and first to Figure 1, there is shown a pill case 2 in<br>
accordance with an embodiment of the present invention having an optional top<br>
cover 4 and an optional bottom cover 6 spaced apart from each other by a spine 13<br>
including a sleeve engaging locking assembly 14 which optionally enables pill<br>
receiving sleeves or trays 18 to be replaced as needed. The top cover 4 has a<br>
forward end 8 and the bottom cover 6 has a corresponding forward end 10, each of<br>
which may operatively engage adjacent pill receiving sleeves 18 to secure the pill<br>
case 2 in the closed position via a clasp mechanism 11 as specifically shown in<br>
Figure 1 and as explained in detail hereinafter.<br>
The top cover 4 has a rearward end 12, which is operatively engaged to the<br>
sleeve engaging locking assembly 14 forming part of the spine 13 through a living<br>
hinge or other appropriate attachment device as described hereinafter. The bottom<br>
cover 6 has corresponding rearward end 16, which is likewise operatively engaged<br>
to the sleeve engaging locking assembly 14 of the spine 13 in a manner similar to<br>
the top cover 4.<br>
The pill case 2 shown in Figure 1 contains at least one, preferably a plurality<br>
of pill receiving sleeves 18 which are removably engaged to the sleeve engaging<br>
locking assembly 14 positioned on the spine 13 of the pill case 2. In the embodiment<br>
shown in Figure 1, the pill receiving sleeves 18 are in a stacked arrangement with<br>
the sleeves 18 positioned one on top of another.<br>
Referring to Figures 2, 3 and 4, each of the pill receiving sleeves 18<br>
comprises a base 20 having a plurality of apertures 22. Each aperture 22 is sized to<br>
correspond to the size of a pill contained within a blister card so that the pill may be<br>
released from the blister card through the aperture 22 as desired. Alternatively, each<br>
aperture 22 may contain therein a piil (not shown) protected by a cover, which can<br>
be released from the base by exerting pressure on the pill to break the protective<br>
cover, in the alternative embodiment, each pill has in effect its own individual<br>
compartment. In both embodiments each pill is not adversely affected by contact<br>
with other pills. The size and shape of the apertures may be selected to suit the size<br>
and shape of the particular type of pill.<br>
Each of the sleeves 18 has a rearward wall 24 (see Figure 2) which is<br>
adapted to engage the sleeve engaging locking assembly 14 as hereinafter<br>
described. The pill receiving sleeve 18 also has an opposed wall 26 and sidewalls<br>
28 which together with the base 20 and the rearward wall 24 form a pill containing<br>
area 30 for housing the blister card and which helps to prevent a blister card from<br>
sliding out of the pill receiving sleeve 18.<br>
The pill case 2 may be further provided with an optional system for aligning<br>
and securing respective adjacent pill receiving sleeves 18 with the top and/or bottom<br>
covers. This optional system enables a single pill receiving sleeve 18 in a multiple<br>
sleeve embodiment to be exposed for dispensing a pill, while allowing the remaining<br>
pill receiving sleeves 18 and/or top and bottom covers 4, 6 to remain closed.<br>
More specifically, as shown best in Figure 3, the top cover 4 has an underside<br>
surface 31 having two pair of spaced apart detents 33 and 35 extending therefrom.<br>
Each pair of detents 33 and 35 extends from the underside surface 31 of the top<br>
cover 4 for frictionally engaging opposed wall 26 and the rearward wall 24,<br>
respectively, of the adjacent pill receiving sleeve 18 to align the adjacent pill<br>
receiving sleeve 18 with the top cover 4 to as shown in Figure 1.<br>
In particular, the pair of detents 35 frictionally engage the rearward wall 24<br>
while the pair of detents 33 frictionally engage the opposed wall 26 of the pill<br>
receiving sleeve 18 when the top cover 4 is closed over the adjacent pill receiving<br>
sleeve 18 shown in Figure 3. Because the pairs of detents 33, 35 are only frictionally<br>
engaged to the respective walls 24,26 of the pill receiving sleeve 18, the top cover 4<br>
may be easily moved into a position in which the top cover 4 is secured to the<br>
adjacent pill receiving sleeve 18 and then released therefrom to expose the adjacent<br>
pill receiving sleeve 18 and the pills contained therein.<br>
The pill case 2 is securable in the closed position to form a compact pill case<br>
using a clasp mechanism 11 as shown in Figure 1. The clasp mechanism 11<br>
includes an elongated projection 32 having on an inner surface a transversely<br>
extending detent 34 (as best shown in Figure 4). The projection 32 extends<br>
downwardly from the forward end 8 of the top cover 4 to the forward end 10 of the<br>
bottom cover 6 as shown in Figure 1.<br>
There is also provided a projection engaging latch 36 which extends upwardly<br>
from the forward end 10 of the bottom cover 6 in a direction that will enable the<br>
projection 32 and latch 36 to operatively engage each other in a locking position to<br>
thereby secure the pill case in the closed position (See Figure 1) and disengage from<br>
each other by dislodging the projection 32 from the latch 36 to enable the pill case 2<br>
to move to an open position exposing the pill receiving sleeve 18 as shown in Figure<br>
10.<br>
The latch 36 is provided with a forwardly extending lip 38 which engages the<br>
detent 34 to removably secure the pill case in the closed position. It will be<br>
understood that other suitable clasp mechanisms (e.g. hook and eye connectors)<br>
can be used for the same purpose.<br>
As part of the optional system described above, each of the pill receiving<br>
sleeves 18 has an underside surface 37 (See Figure 4) which also contains<br>
respective pairs of detents 39 and 41 which frictionally engage the inside surface of<br>
the rearward wall 24 and opposed wall 26 of the next adjacent pill receiving sleeve<br>
18 immediately therebelow as shown best in Figure 4. It will be noted that each of<br>
the pairs of detents 39 and 41 frictionally engage the inside surfaces of the<br>
respective walls 24 and 26 to provide a corresponding frictional contact therewith.<br>
The employment of the pairs of detents 39 and 41 therefore provides secure<br>
alignment of the adjacent pill receiving sleeves 18 with one another. In this manner,<br>
if the pill container 2 contains more than two pill receiving sleeves 18, one of sleeves<br>
may be exposed to allow access to the pills while the remainder of the sleeves may<br>
remain together as shown specifically in Figure 3. Other means of detachably<br>
aligning the pill receiving sleeves 18 together would be apparent to those of ordinary<br>
skill in the art.<br>
As previously indicated, the top cover 4 may be secured to the adjacent pill<br>
receiving sleeve 18 through the employment of respective pairs of detents 33 and 35<br>
frictionally engaging the rearward wall 24 and opposed wall 26 on the inside surfaces<br>
thereof, respectively. The bottom cover 6 may be provided with respective adjacent<br>
pairs of detents 43 and 45 (see Figures 4 and 6) extending from the underside<br>
surface 29 of the bottom cover 6 frictionally engage corresponding detents 39 and 41<br>
extending from the underside surface 37 of the adjacent pill receiving sleeve 18. In<br>
this manner, the adjacent pill receiving sleeve 18 is securely aligned with respect to<br>
the bottom cover 6.<br>
Thus, the present pill case provides an optional system for aligning an<br>
adjacent pill receiving sleeve 18 with the top cover 4, an adjacent pill receiving<br>
sleeve 18 with the bottom cover 6 and the alignment of adjacent pill receiving<br>
sleeves -18 to each other. This detachable aligning and securing arrangement<br>
enables the user to access a single pill receiving sleeve 18 for retrieving a pill<br>
therefrom while keeping the other pill receiving sleeves 18 secured together as<br>
shown, for example, in Figure 3. In addition, by pushing the top cover 4 towards the<br>
bottom cover 6 so that all of the pill receiving sleeves 18 are aligned together with<br>
the top and bottom covers, the pill case will assume the completely closed position<br>
shown in Figure 1 for protecting the pills contained therein.<br>
When the pill case is in the closed position as shown in Figure 1, access to<br>
the pill receiving sleeves 18 may be facilitated by tabs 55 extending from the outside<br>
surface of the wall 26 of the sleeves 18. The tabs 55 may be contacted by a finger<br>
or a thumb and lifted to thereby raise any sleeve 18 which is located above the<br>
particular tab 55 as well as the cover 4, thus exposing the pill receiving sleeve 18<br>
immediately below the particular tab 55,<br>
By way of example and referring to Figure 2, the pill case 2 includes three pill<br>
receiving sleeves 18a, 18b, and 18c each having extending therefrom at the wall 26,<br>
respective tabs 55a, 55b, and 55c. If the tab 55b and thus sleeve 18b is lifted<br>
upwardly, the sleeve 18a and the cover 4 will likewise be lifted thereby exposing pill<br>
receiving sleeve 18c and the pills received therein. Thus, the tabs 55 not only<br>
facilitate entry to the contents of the pill case 2 in general, but particularly to an<br>
individual pill receiving sleeves 18 as desired.<br>
The pill receiving sleeves 18 are individually removably secured to the spine<br>
13 of the pill case 2 through a sleeve engaging locking assembly 14. Referring to<br>
Figures 5-7, there is shown an embodiment of the sleeve engaging locking<br>
assembly 14 in which the pill receiving sleeves 18 are removably secured to the<br>
spine 13 through a side loading motion. It will be understood that other methods of<br>
removably securing the sleeve 18 to the spine 13 may be employed. The sleeve<br>
engaging locking assembly 14 positioned on the spine 13 comprises at least one,<br>
typically a plurality of sleeve engaging connector assemblies 40 with each sleeve<br>
engaging connecting assembly 40 adapted to receive a single pill receiving sleeve<br>

engaging locking assembly 14 is prevented by the operative engagement of the<br>
respective gripping portions 72 and 104 contained within the second channel portion<br>
44 and on the second engagement portion 48.<br>
The pill receiving sleeve 18 may be removed from operative engagement with<br>
the sleeve engaging locking assembly 14 by exerting a force in the opposite direction<br>
(i.e. to the left) from that required to obtain operative engagement. This necessitates<br>
as shown in Figure 5 a side unloading motion with the pill receiving sleeve 18 being<br>
slid to the left until the first and second engagement portions 46 and 48 disengage<br>
from the first and second channel portions 42, 44 respectively. It will be understood<br>
that the configuration of the sleeve engaging locking assembly may be such that the<br>
side loading direction may be different so long as the pill receiving sleeve can be<br>
operatively engaged and disengaged to the spine.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, the pill receiving sleeves 18 as<br>
previously described as well as the top and bottom covers may be secured in<br>
operative relationship to each other by another type of sleeve engaging locking<br>
assembly as shown in Figures 10-12. The embodiment shown therein may be used<br>
to removably secure the individual pill receiving sleeves but may also be used to<br>
permanently secure the pill receiving sleeves in operative engagement so that the<br>
pill case may be used as a disposable (e.g. when all the pills are consumed, the pill<br>
case is discarded).<br>
Referring specifically to Figures 10-12, there is shown a pill case 102 in which<br>
