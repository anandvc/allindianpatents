				<td>The present invention relates to profiled bar having an inner tube part and an outer tube part.<br>
From CH-415 999, a profiled beam is known, which is composed of a central circular ring and four equal arrows, which are radially staggered at 90° with respect to each other and directed with their tips outwards from the ring, whereby the beam comprises four long slots which are situated each between two tips.<br>
It is the task of the invention to improve such a beam.<br>
This task is solved, according to the invention, by means of a profiled beam with the -characteristics given in the characterizing part of patent claim 1.<br>
Furthermore this task is solved, according to the invention, by means of a clamping profile for profiled beams with the features of claim 6.<br>
The solution according to the invention results in a versatile support beam system, which allows a simple lateral mounting of walls.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to profiled bar having an inner tube part and an outer tube part, the two tube parts being connected to one another by webs, and the peripheral wall of the outer tube part having at least two adjacent longitudinal slots, characterised in that through-passages for securing a flat support element are provided between the two sides of each web, and these through-passages, as seen in the cross-section of the profiled bar, are each aligned parallel to the adjacent outer sides of the inner tube part.<br><br>
Further advantageous embodiments of the invention are given in the dependent patent claims.<br>

Figure 14 and 15 further variants of the cross-section of a clamp¬ing profile according to the invention.<br>
The profiled beams according to Fig. 1 and 2 respectively are com¬posed of an inner tubular part 1 or 1' with a quadratic cross sec¬tion, which might, in its case, also be polygonal or circular, and an outer tubular part 2 with an octagonal cross section, which may also be polygonal or circular. The inner tubular part 1 or 1' (Fig. 2) comprises four relatively thin side walls 3, 4, 5, and 6. The outer tubular part 2 comprises eight relatively thin side walls 7 to 14. The tubular parts 1, respectively 1', and 2 are connected by eight elongated webs or ribs 15 to 22, which extend pair-wise outwards from the corner regions of a side wall of the inner tubular part 1, and namely each time orthogonal to this side wall. Each web 15 to 22 is connected to the junction part of two adjacent walls of the octagonal tubular part. Because the walls of the tubular parts 1, 1' and 2 and the thickness of the webs 15 to 22 are relatively thin in comparison to the height or width of the beam, nine hollow spaces result between the two tubular parts 1, 1' and 2. The largest hollow space 23 is situated at the interior of the inner tubular part 1, 1'. Four mean-sized hollow spaces 24, 25, 26, 27 are situated between the walls of both tubular parts 1, 1' and 2 and the webs 16 and 17, respectively 18 and 19, respec¬tively 20 and 21, respectively 22 and 15. The four smaller hollow spaces 28, 29, 30, and 31 are situated between the corners of the inner tubular part 1, 1', the walls of the outer tubular part 2<br><br>
and the webs 15 and 16, respectively 17 and 18, respectively 19 and 20, respectively 21 and 22.<br>
The four walls 7, 9, 11, and 13 of the outer tubular part 2 run therefore parallel to the four side walls 3, 4, 5, and 6, respec¬tively, of the inner tubular part 1, 1', and are provided each with a centred long slot 32, 33, 34, and 35, which represent open¬ings to the exterior world of the mean-sized hollow spaces 27, 24, 25, and 26, respectively.<br>
Two further side walls 8 and 12 of the outer tubular part 2 run parallel to one diagonal of the cross section of the inner tubular part 1, 1' and are provided with each a centred long slot 36, 37, which represent openings of these two smaller hollow spaces 28, 30 to the exterior world. The two other side walls 10 and 14 of the outer tubular part 2 run parallel to the other diagonal of the cross section of the inner tubular part 1, 1' and are provided with each a centred long slot 38, 39, which represent openings of these two smaller hollow spaces 29, 31 to the exterior world. Be¬cause the four smaller hollow spaces 28, 29, 30, and 31 are rela¬tively small, it results that the side walls 8, 10, 12, and 14 of the outer tubular part 2 are formed in part by relatively short elongated ribs 40, 40', ... in the region of the long slots 36, 38, 37, and 39. The webs comprise on both sides a guide groove each, for example 401 and 402, respectively, which have identical width.<br>
The webs 15 to 22 (Fig. 1) are provided with through-passing slots 41, 42, 43, ... in the bottom of the grooves 401, 402, ..., which are preferably situated in regular intervals between the web walls 44, 45, 46, respectively 47, ... . The width of the long slots 36, 37, 38, and 39, which communicate with the smaller hollow spaces, is sized as large as to allow a plate or a flat element to be in¬serted into one of these long slots, independently of if the plate is parallel to the one or to the other side wall of the inner<br>
tube. To this end, the outer edge or outer rib 40 of the outer side wall of a groove 401 may, for example, lie in the same plane of the outer surface of the side wall 3 of a inner tubular part 1, 1'f or the distance between the remote outer edges 40 and 40' of the outer side walls of two grooves 402, 402' of two adjacent par¬allel webs, for example 16, 17, may be smaller than the width of the inner tubular part 1, 1' between the outer surfaces of the opposed side walls 3 and 5.<br>
The inner tubular part 1 comprises, according to the embodiment shown in Fig. 1, eight inner guide ribs 48, 49,... , which com¬prise cylindrical front sides at their innermost end in a way that the guide ribs 48, 49, . . . can serve as guide for a cylindrical tube with a round cross section, and they are provided along the tubular part 1 preferably pair-wise in the middle of the inner side walls of said tubular part 1.<br>
The outer tubular part 2' comprises, according to the embodiment shown in Fig. 3, eight grooves or recesses 50, 51 which act as, shoulders and guides. Preferably, they comprise, as shown in Fig.<br>
3, an angle of 90°.<br>
The flat supporting element according to Fig. 4 comprises hooks 52, 53, known per se, which can be introduced into the openings 41, 42, 43, ... for mounting the flat supporting element with the profiled beam.<br>
The grooves 401, 402, . . . (Fig. 2) are provided as guide grooves and they have the same width and comprise on their left and on their right side walls which are provided pair-wise in two paral¬lel planes.<br>
The distance between the remote outer edges or ribs 40, 40' of the outer side walls of two grooves 402, 402' of two adjacent parallel webs 16, 17 is each time preferably smaller than the distance be-<br><br>
tween the outer surfaces of two opposite side walls 3, 5 of the inner tubular part 1, 1'.<br>
Fig. 5 and 6 show a profiled beam according to a second embodi¬ment. Identical features in the drawings are indicated by using the same numerals. The profiled beams are composed likewise of an inner tubular part 1 with a substantially quadratic cross section and an outer tubular part 2 with an octagonal cross section.<br>
The webs 15 to 22 are provided, according to Fig. 6, with through-passing slots 41, 42, 43, ..., which are preferably situated in regular intervals between web walls 44, 45, 46, respectively 47. The width of the long slots 36, 37, 38, and 39, which communicate with the smaller hollow spaces, is sized as large as to allow a plate or a flat supporting element (Fig. 11) to be inserted into one of these long slots, independently of if the plate is parallel to the one or to the other side wall of the inner tube. To this end, the outer rib 40 may, for example, lie in the same plane, of the outer surface of side wall 3, or the distance between the edges 40 and 40' may be smaller than the width of the inner tubu¬lar part 1 between the outer surfaces of the opposed side walls 3 and 5.<br>
The clamping profile according to Fig. 7 is composed of an in¬verted U-profile 61 and a flat profile 62, which comprises, in addition to a strip-shaped wall 63, preferably each an angle-shaped lateral longitudinal edge 64, 65. The legs 66, 67 of the U-profile are two parallel elongated walls, provided with an elon¬gated ground plate 68, in such a way that two corner regions 69, 69' are formed. The left corner region 69 of the U-profile is con¬nected to the flat profile 62 by means of an elongated web 70, and the right corner region 69' by means of an elongated web 71. The wall 63, the webs 70 and 71 and the ground plate 68 of the U-profile 61 enclose a hollow space 72. The inner surfaces of these two elongated walls 66, 67 are plane glide-surfaces.<br><br>
The wall 66 comprises an exterior longitudinal rib 73, which runs parallel to the ground plate 68 and is situated in the region be¬tween the end-edge 74 of the wall 66 and the ground plate 68. The end-edge 74 has the shape of an outward-extending wedge 75, which forms an acute, inward directed termination 76 of the wall 66, whereby the other end of the wedge 75 and the rib 73 form an elon¬gated guide-groove 77, whose width corresponds to the thickness of the walls 7, 9, 11 and 13 (Fig. 2 or 6) . The wall 67 of the U-profile comprises as well a rib 73' and a wedge 75', which are symmetrically arranged to the corresponding parts of the wall 66.<br>
Fig. 8 shows a clamping profile 60, which is clamped fast in the slot 36 of a beam, whereby, at the corners of the inner tubular part 1, the side walls 3, 4, ... are preferably inward angular-shaped/ in such a way that the angular-shaped strip 101 of the wall 3 appears as a prolongation of the web 15, and the angular-shaped strip 102 of the wall 4 as a prolongation of the web 16.<br>
The clamping profile 60 is made of a hard material, such as hard PVC-plastic, which is, however, elastic enough to permit, by ex¬erting a pressure onto the wall 63, when the wedges 75 touch the outer edges of the beam in the region of the slot 36, a gliding narrowing of the distance between the two walls 66, 67, wherein the clamping profile is pressed into the slot 36 until it remains clamped fast between the ribs 73, 73' and the shoulders of the wedges 75, 75' . The edges 64, 65 of the clamping profile are shaped in such a way that they run, in the mounted state, prefera¬bly parallel to the wall 8 or 9, respectively (Fig. 8).<br>
In the example according to Fig. 9, three clamping profiles 81, 82, 83 are clamped fast in a beam, whereby a first, strip-shaped plate 84 is held between the clamping profiles 81 and 82, and a second, strip-shaped plate 85 between the clamping profiles 82 and 83.<br>
At the slots 33 and 34, each a flat bar 86, respectively 87, is fixed in an in itself known way with the help of clamping ele¬ments. As shown in Fig. 9, additional plates 88 and 89 can be held between a flat bar 86, 87 respectively, and a clamping profile 81, 83 respectively.<br>
Fig. 10 shows two flat bars 91, 92 in whose end regions a clamping device is lodged, in order to be able to mount them on an not rep¬resented supporting beam. The flat bars 91, 92 are provided with at least one long slot 93, 94, in which each a clamping profile 95, 96, according to the invention, is clamped fast. A plate 97, preferably of plastic, glass or another light material, is in¬serted at one side between the edge 64 of the clamping profile 95 and the flat bar 91, and at the other side between the edge 65 of the clamping profile 96 and the flat bar 92, whereby the end re¬gions of the plate 97 near the clamping profiles 95, 96 lie tightly on the flat bars.<br>
Fig. 11 shows a supporting beam 111, provided with a circular inner tubular part and comprising eight long slots, three of which are covered with each a clamping profile 112, 113, 114. At the supporting side, a supporting element 115 and two flat bars 116, 117 are fixed, which are provided with slots for further clamping profiles. The edges of the clamping profiles serve for the supporting of plates. A supporting surface 118 is attached laterally to the supporting element 115. The supporting element 115, which is oriented parallel to the flat bar 116, can also be mounted at the place of or additionally to this flat bar in par¬allel orientation to the flat bar 117, which shows the versatile applicability of the profiled beam.<br>
Fig. 12 shows various variants of the cross section of a beam ac¬cording to the invention, in which the inner tubular part may com-<br><br>
prise at the inner side thickenings 119, 119', which are, for ex¬ample, step-shaped.<br>
Fig. 13 shows a clamping profile without an additional elongated ground plate or bottom 68 (Fig. 7) and without a hollow space 72, i.e. the bottom 68 may be considered as a part of the auxiliary profile 62. Thereby the lower part of the approximately U-shaped cross-section is laterally outwardly expanded.<br>
The bottom 68' of the profile of Fig. 14 is not connected to the bend regions 69, 69' but to regions of the walls 66, 67 which are somewhat lower.<br>
The profile of Fig. 15 has a cross-section like the profile of Fig. 14 but without bottom 68'.<br>
The clamping profile 62 can be shaped as a covering profile for one slot of a beam. —<br><br><br><br><br>
