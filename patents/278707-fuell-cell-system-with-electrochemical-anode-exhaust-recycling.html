RECYCLING<br>
[0001]	The present application claims benefit of United States provisional<br>
patent application serial number 60/701,977, filed July 25, 2005, which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference in entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	The present invention relates generally to the field of gas separation<br>
and more particularly to fuel cell systems with electrochemical fuel exhaust fuel<br>
recovery,<br>
[0003]	Fuel cells are electrochemical devices which can convert energy stored<br>
in fuels to electrical energy with high efficiencies. High temperature fuel cells<br>
include solid oxide and molten carbonate fuel cells. These fuel cells may operate<br>
using hydrogen and/or hydrocarbon fuels. There are classes of fuel cells, such as the<br>
solid oxide regenerative fuel cells, that also allow reversed operation, such that<br>
oxidized fuel can be reduced back to unoxidized fuel using electrical energy as an<br>
input.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0004]	Figures 1 and 2 are schematic diagrams of fuel cell systems of the<br>
embodiments of the invention.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0005]	The embodiments of the invention provide a fuel cell system with an<br>
electrochemical fuel cell stack fuel (i.e., anode) exhaust recycling. The fuel exhaust<br>
stream is sent to a hydrogen separation device which separates hydrogen from the fuel<br>
exhaust stream. The hydrogen separation device is an electrochemical pump<br>
separation unit, such as a proton exchange membrane type separation unit. The<br>
separated hydrogen is recycled into the fuel inlet stream.<br>
-1-<br>
 <br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0006]	The first and second embodiments of the invention illustrate how the<br>
electrochemical pump separation unit is used together with a fuel cell system, such as<br>
a solid oxide fuel cell system. It should be noted that other fuel cell systems may also<br>
be used.<br>
[0007]	In the system of the first embodiment, a fuel humidifier is used to<br>
humidify the fuel inlet stream provided into the fuel cell stack. In the system of the<br>
second embodiment, the fiiel humidifier may be omitted. A portion of the fuel cell<br>
stack fuel exhaust stream is directly recycled into the fuel inlet stream to humidify the<br>
fuel inlet steam. Another portion of the fuel cell stack fuel exhaust stream is provided<br>
into the separation unit, and the separated hydrogen is then provided into the fuel inlet<br>
stream.<br>
[0008]	Figure 1 illustrates a fuel cell system 100 of the first embodiment.<br>
The system 100 contains a fuel cell stack 101, such as a solid oxide fuel cell stack<br>
(illustrated schematically to show one solid oxide fuel cell of the stack containing a<br>
ceramic electrolyte, such as yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ), an anode electrode, such<br>
as a nickel-YSZ cermet, and a cathode electrode, such as lanthanum strontium<br>
manganite).<br>
[0009]	The system also contains an electrochemical pump separation unit 1<br>
which electrochemically separates hydrogen from the fuel exhaust stream. The<br>
electrochemical pump unit 1 may comprise any suitable proton exchange membrane<br>
device comprising a polymer electrolyte. The hydrogen diffuses through the polymer<br>
electrolyte under an application of a potential difference between anode and cathode<br>
electrodes located on either side of the electrolyte. Preferably, the electrochemical<br>
pump comprises a stack of carbon monoxide tolerant electrochemical cells, such as a<br>
stack of high-temperature, low-hydration ion exchange membrane cells. This type of<br>
cell includes a non-fluorinated ion exchange ionomer membrane, such as, for<br>
example, a polyben/imidazole (PBI) membrane, located between anode and cathode<br>
electrodes. The membrane is doped with an acid, such as sulfuric or phosphoric acid.<br>
-2-<br>
<br>
 <br>
An example of such cell is disclosed in US published application US 2003/0196893<br>
Al, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. These cells generally operate in a<br>
temperature range of above 100 to about 200 degrees Celsius. Thus, the heat<br>
exchangers in the system 100 preferably keep the fuel exhaust stream at a temperature<br>
of about 120 to about 200 degrees Celsius, such as about 160 to about 190 degrees<br>
Celsius.<br>
[0010]	The system 100 also contains the first conduit 3 which operatively<br>
connects a fuel exhaust outlet 103 of the fuel cell stack 101 to a first inlet 2 of the<br>
electrochemical pump separation unit 1. The system also contains a second conduit 7<br>
which operatively connects an outlet 8 of the electrochemical pump separation unit 1<br>
to a fuel inlet 105 of the fuel cell stack 101. Preferably, the system 100 lacks a<br>
compressor which in operation compresses the fuel cell stack fuel exhaust stream to<br>
be provided into the electrochemical pump separation unit 1. The system 100 also<br>
contains a third conduit 9 which removes the exhaust from the unit 1. The conduit 9<br>
may be connected to a catalytic burner 107 or to an atmospheric vent.<br>
[0011]	The system 100 further contains a fuel humidifier 119 having a first<br>
inlet operatively connected to a hydrocarbon fuel source, such as the hydrocarbon fuel<br>
inlet conduit 111, a second inlet operatively connected to the fuel cell stack fuel<br>
exhaust 103, a first outlet operatively connected to the fuel cell stack fuel inlet 105,<br>
and a second outlet operatively connected to a burner 107. In operation, the fuel<br>
humidifier 119 humidifies a hydrocarbon fuel inlet stream from conduit 111<br>
containing the recycled hydrogen using water vapor contained in a fuel cell stack fuel<br>
exhaust stream. The fuel humidifier may comprise a polymeric membrane<br>
humidifier, such as a Nafion© membrane humidifier, an enthalpy wheel or a plurality<br>
of water adsorbent beds, as described for example in U.S. Patent Number 6,106,964<br>
and in U.S. Application Serial Number 10/368,425, both incorporated herein by<br>
reference in their entirety. For example, one suitable type of humidifier comprises a<br>
water vapor and enthalpy transfer Nafion® based, water permeable membrane<br>
available from Perma Pure LLC. The humidifier passively transfers water vapor and<br>
enthalpy from the fuel exhaust stream into the fuel inlet stream to provide a 2 to 2.5<br>
-3-<br>
<br>
 <br>
steam to carbon ratio in the fuel inlet stream. The fuel inlet stream temperature may<br>
be raised to about 80 to about 90 degrees Celsius in the humidifier.<br>
[0012]	The system 100 also contains a recuperative heat exchanger 121 which<br>
exchanges heat between the stack fuel exhaust stream and the hydrocarbon fuel inlet<br>
stream being provided from the humidifier 119. The heat exchanger helps to raise the<br>
temperature of the fuel inlet stream and reduces the temperature of the fuel exhaust<br>
stream so that it may be further cooled in the condenser and such that it does not<br>
damage the humidifier.<br>
[0013]	If the fuel cells are external fuel reformation type cells, then the system<br>
100 contains a fuel reformer 123. The reformer 123 reforms a hydrocarbon fuel inlet<br>
stream into hydrogen and carbon monoxide containing fuel stream which is then<br>
provided into the stack 101. The reformer 123 may be heated radiatively,<br>
convectively and/or conductively by the heat generated in the iiiel cell stack 101<br>
and/or by the heat generated in an optional burner/combustor, as described in U.S.<br>
Patent Application Serial Number 11/002,681, filed December 2, 2004, incoiporated<br>
herein by reference in its entirety. Alternatively, the external reformer 123 may be<br>
omitted if the stack 101 contains cells of the internal reforming type where<br>
reformation occurs primarily within the fuel cells of the stack.<br>
[0014]	Optionally,  the   system   100   also   contains   an  air preheater heat<br>
exchanger 125. This heat exchanger 125 heats the air inlet stream being provided to<br>
the fuel cell stack 101 using the heat of the fuel cell stack fuel exhaust. If desired, this<br>
heat exchanger 125 maybe omitted.<br>
[0015]	The system 100 also preferably contains an air heat exchanger 127.<br>
This heat exchanger 127 further heats the air inlet stream being provided to the fuel<br>
cell stack 101 using the heat of the fuel cell stack air (i.e., oxidizer or cathode)<br>
exhaust. If the preheater heat exchanger 125 is omitted, then the air inlet stream is<br>
provided directly into the heat exchanger 127 by a blower or other air intake device.<br>
The system also optionally contains a hydrogen cooler heat exchanger 129 which<br>
-4-<br>
<br>
 <br>
cools the separated hydrogen stream provided from unit 1, using an air stream, such as<br>
an air inlet stream.<br>
[0016]	The system may also contain an optional water-gas si lift reactor 128.<br>
The water-gas shift reactor 128 may be any suitable device which converts at least a<br>
portion of the water in the fuel exhaust stream into free hydrogen. For example, the<br>
reactor 128 may comprise a tube or conduit containing a catalyst which converts some<br>
or all of the carbon monoxide and water vapor in tine fuel exhaust stream into carbon<br>
dioxide and hydrogen. Thus, the reactor 128 increases the amount of hydrogen in the<br>
fuel exhaust stream. The catalyst may be any suitable catalyst, such as a iron oxide or<br>
a chromium promoted iron oxide catalyst. The reactor 128 may be located between<br>
the fuel heat exchanger 121 and the air preheater heat exchanger 125.<br>
[0017]	The system 100 of the first embodiment operates as follows.   A fuel<br>
inlet stream is provided into the fuel cell stack 101 through fuel inlet conduit 111.<br>
The fuel may comprise any suitable fuel, such as a hydrocarbon fuel, including but<br>
not limited to methane, natural gas which contains methane with hydrogen and other<br>
gases, propane or other biogas, or a mixture of a carbon fuel, such as carbon<br>
monoxide, oxygenated carbon containing gas, such as rnethanol, or other carbon<br>
containing gas with a hydrogen containing gas, such as water vapor, I-I2 gas or their<br>
mixtures. For example, the mixture may comprise syngas derived from coal or<br>
natural gas reformation.<br>
[0018]	The  fuel  inlet stream passes  through the  humidifier   119 where<br>
humidity is added to the fuel inlet stream. The humidified fuel inlet stream then<br>
passes through the fuel heat exchanger 121 where the humidified fuel inlet stream is<br>
heated by the fuel cell stack fuel exhaust stream. The heated and humidified fuel inlet<br>
stream is then provided into a reformer 123, which is preferably an external reformer.<br>
For example,. reformer 123 may comprise a reformer described in U.S. Patent<br>
Application Serial Number 11/002,681, filed on December 2, 2004, incorporated<br>
herein by reference in its entirety. The fuel reformer 123 may be any suitable device<br>
which is capable of partially or wholly reforming a hydrocarbon fuel 10 form a carbon<br>
containing and free hydrogen containing fuel.   For example, the fuel reformer 123<br>
-5-<br>
<br>
 <br>
may be any suitable device which can reform a hydrocarbon gas into a gas mixture of<br>
free hydrogen and a carbon containing gas. For example, the fuel reformer 123 may<br>
comprise a catalyst coated passage where a humidified biogas, such as natural gas, is<br>
reformed via a steam-methane reformation reaction to form free hydrogen, carbon<br>
monoxide, carbon dioxide, water vapor and optionally a residual amount of<br>
unreformed biogas. The free hydrogen and carbon monoxide are then provided into<br>
the fuel (i.e., anode) inlet 105 of the fuel cell stack 101. Thus, with respect to the fuel<br>
inlet stream, the humidifier 119 is located upstream of the heat exchanger 121 which<br>
is located upstream of the reformer 123 which is located upstream of the stack 101.<br>
[0019J	The air or other oxygen containing gas (i.e., oxidizer) inlet stream is<br>
preferably provided into the stack 101 through a heat exchanger 127, where it is<br>
heated by the air (i.e., cathode) exhaust stream from the fuel cell stack, If desired, the<br>
air inlet stream may also pass through the hydrogen cooler heat exchanger 129" and/or<br>
through the air preheat heat exchanger 125 to further increase the temperature of the<br>
air before providing the air into the stack 101.<br>
[0020]	Once the fuel and air are provided into the fuel cell stack 101, the stack<br>
101 is operated to generate electricity and a hydrogen containing fuel exhaust stream.<br>
About 25% of the input fuel exits the fud exhau..;t outlet 103 of the stack. The fuel<br>
exhaust stream (i.e., the stack anode exhan;;l stream) is provided from the stack fuel<br>
exhaust outlet 103 into the electrochemical pump separation unit 1. At least a portion<br>
of hydrogen contained in the fuel exhaust stream is separated in the unit 1. The<br>
hydrogen separated from the fuel exhaust stream in the unit 1 is then provided back<br>
into the fuel inlet stream. Preferably, the hydrogen is provided back into the fuel<br>
inlet conduit 111 upstream of the humidifier 119.<br>
[0021]	The fuel exhaust stream is provided into the unit 1 as follows. The fuel<br>
exhaust stream may contain hydrogen, water vapor, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide,<br>
some unreacted hydrocarbon gas, such as methane and other reaction by-products and<br>
impurities. This exhaust stream is first provided into the heat exchanger 121, where<br>
its temperature is lowered, preferably to less than 200 degrees Celsius, while the<br>
temperature of the fuel inlet stream is raised.   If the water-gas shift reactor 128 and<br>
-6-<br>
<br>
 <br>
the air preheater heat exchanger 125 are present. Lhen the fuel exhaust stream is<br>
provided through the reactor 128 to convert al least a portion of the water vapor and a<br>
majority of the residual carbon monoxide into carbon dioxide and hydrogen. The fuel<br>
exhaust stream is then passed through the heat exchanger 125 to further lower its<br>
temperature while raising the temperature of the air inlet stream. The temperature<br>
may be lowered to 90 to 110 degrees Celsius for example.<br>
[0022]	The   fuel   exhaust   stream   is   then  provided   into   inlet  2  of the<br>
electrochemical pump separation unit 1 via conduit 3. During the separation step in<br>
unit 1, at least a majority of the hydrogen, such as about 85% of the hydrogen in the<br>
fuel exhaust stream, diffuses through the electrolyte of the cells in the unit 1, while<br>
allowing the water vapor, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and remaining<br>
hydrocarbon gas in the fuel exhaust stream to be passed through conduit 9 to the<br>
humidifier 119.<br>
[0023J	In the fuel humidifier 119, a portion of the water vapor in the fuel<br>
exhaust stream is transferred to the fuel inlet stream to humidify the fuel inlet stream.<br>
The fuel/hydrogen fuel inlet stream mixture is humidified to 80C to 90C dew point.<br>
The remainder of the fuel exhaust stream is then provided into the burner 107 along<br>
with the air (i.e., cathode) exhaust stream from the stack 101 to be burned and to<br>
provide low quality heat. The heat from the burner 107 may be used to heat the<br>
reformer 123 or it may be provided to other parts of the system 100 or to a heat<br>
consuming devices outside the system 100, such as a building heating system.<br>
[0024]	The hydrogen separated from the fuel exhaust stream is then removed<br>
from unit 1 through outlet 8 and conduit 7 and provided into the hydrocarbon fuel<br>
inlet stream in the fuel inlet conduit 111. If desired, prior to being provided to the<br>
fuel inlet conduit, the hydrogen stream may be passed through a hydrogen cooler heat<br>
exchanger 129, where the hydrogen stream exchanges heat with an air stream, such as<br>
the air inlet .stream provided into the fuel cell stack 101. The temperature of the<br>
hydrogen stream is lowered in the heat exchanger 129 before being provided into the<br>
fuel inlet conduit, while the temperature of the air inlet stream is raised. Thus, the<br>
hydrocarbon  fuel  inlet  stream   is   mixed   with  a  low  dew point,   near  ambient<br>
-7-<br>
<br>
 <br>
temperature recycled hydrogen recovered from the anode tail gas with an<br>
electrochemical hydrogen pump 1.<br>
[0025]	 Thus, with respect 10 the fuel exhaust stream, the heat exchanger 121 is<br>
located upstream of the reactor 128, which is located upstream of the heat exchanger<br>
125, which is located upstream of the pump unit 1, which is located upstream of the<br>
humidifier 119 and the fuel inlet conduit 111.<br>
[0026]	Figure 2 illustrates a system 200 according to the second embodiment<br>
of the invention. The system 200 is similar to system 100 and contains a number of<br>
components in common. Those components which are common to both systems 100<br>
and 200 arc numbered with the same numbers in Figures 1 and 2 and will not be<br>
described further.<br>
[0027]	One difference between systems  100 and 200 is that system 200<br>
preferably, but not necessarily lacks, the humidifier 119. Instead, a portion of the<br>
water vapor containing stack fuel exhaust stream is directly recycled into the stack<br>
fuel inlet stream. The water vapor in the fuel exhaust stream is sufficient to humidify<br>
the fuel inlci stream.<br>
[0028]	The system 200 contains a fuel splitter device 201, such as a computer<br>
or operator controlled multi-way valve, for example a three-way valve, or another<br>
fluid splitting device. The device 201 contains an inlet 203 opcratively connected to<br>
the fuel cell stack fuel exhaust outlet 103, a first outlet 205 operatively connected to<br>
the unit 1 and a second outlet 207 operatively connected to the fuel cell stack fuel<br>
inlet 105. For example, the second outlet 207 may be operatively connected to the<br>
fuel inlet conduit 111, which is operatively connected to inlet 105. However, the<br>
second outlet 207 may provide a portion of the fuel exhaust stream into the fuel inlet<br>
stream further downstream.<br>
[0029]	Preferably, the system 200 contains a blower or compressor 209 which<br>
provides the fuel exhaust stream into the fuel inlet stream. Specifically, the outlet<br>
207 of the valve 201 is operatively connected to an inlet of a blower or compressor<br>
209, while an-outlet of the blower or compressor 209 is connected to the hydrocarbon<br>
-8-<br>
<br>
 <br>
fuel inlet conduit 111. In operation, the blower or compressor 209 controllably<br>
provides a desired amount of the fuel cell stack fuel exhaust stream into the fuel cell<br>
stack fuel inlet stream.<br>
[0030]	The method of operating the system 200 is similar to the method of<br>
operating the system 100. One difference is that the fuel exhaust stream is separated<br>
into at least two streams by the device 201. The first fuel exhaust stream is recycled<br>
into the fuel inlet stream, while the second stream is directed into the separation unit 1<br>
where at least a portion of hydrogen contained in the second fuel exhaust stream is<br>
electrochemically separated from the second fuel exhaust stream. The hydrogen<br>
separated from the second fuel exhaust stream is then provided into the fuel inlet<br>
stream. For example, between 50 and 70%, such as about 60% of the fuel exhaust<br>
stream may be provided 1o the blower or compressor 209, while the remainder may be<br>
provided toward the unit 1.<br>
[0031]	Preferably, the fuel exhaust stream is first provided through the heat<br>
exchangers 121 and 125 and reactor 128 before being provided into the valve 201.<br>
The fuel exhaust stream is cooled to 200 degrees Celsius or less, such as to 120 to 180<br>
degrees, in the heat exchanger 125 prior to being provided into the valve 201 where it<br>
is separated into two streams. This allows the use of a low temperature blower 209 to<br>
controllably recycle a desired amount of the first fuel exhaust stream into the fuel inlet<br>
stream, since such blower may be adapted to move a gas utreani which has a<br>
temperature of 200 degrees Celsius or less.<br>
[0032]	The blower or compressor 209 may be computer or operator controlled<br>
and may vary the amount of the fuel exhaust stream being provided into the fuel inlet<br>
stream depending on the conditions described below. If desired, all or a portion of the<br>
hydrogen separated from unit 1 may be provided to a hydrogen using device, such as<br>
a PEM fuel cell in a vehicle or another hydrogen using device or to a hydrogen<br>
storage vessel. In this case, a selector valve may be placed in conduit 7 to either split<br>
the hydrogen stream between the fuel inlet conduit 111 and the hydrogen storage<br>
vessel or hydrogen using device, or to alternate the hydrogen flow between the fuel<br>
inlet conduit ll and the hydrogen storage vessel or hydrogen using device.     The<br>
-9-<br>
<br>
 <br>
blower or compressor and the optional selector valve may be operated by a computer<br>
or an operator to controllably vary the gas .flow based on one or more of the following<br>
conditions: i) detected or observed conditions of the system 100 (i.e., changes in the<br>
sys'.em operating conditions requiring a change in the amount of hydrogen in the fuel<br>
inlet stream); ii) previous calculations provided into the computer or conditions<br>
known to the operator which require a temporal adjustment of the hydrogen in the fuel<br>
inlet stream; iii) desired future changes, presently occurring changes or recent past<br>
changes in the operating parameters of the stack 101, such as changes in the<br>
electricity demrmd by the users of electricity generated by the slack, changes in price<br>
for electricity or hydrocarbon fuel compared to the price of hydrogen, etc, and/or iv)<br>
changes in the demand for hydrogen by the hydrogen user, such as the hydrogen using<br>
device, changes in price of hydrogen or hydrocarbon fuel compared to the price of<br>
electricity, etc.<br>
[0033]	It is believed that by recycling at least a portion of the hydrogen from<br>
the fuel exhaust (i.e., tail) gas stream into the fuel inlet stream, a high efficiency<br>
operation of the fuel cell system is obtained. Furthermore, the overall fuel utilization<br>
is increased. The electrical efficiency (i.e., AC electrical efficiency) can range<br>
between about 50% and about 60%, such as between about 54% and about 60% for<br>
the methods of the firs I and second embodiments when the per pass fuel utilization<br>
rate is about 75% (i.e., about 75% of the fuel is utilized during each pass through the<br>
stack). An effective fuel utilization of about 94% to about 95% is obtained when the<br>
per pass utilization is about 75%, and about 85% of the fuel exhaust gas hydrogen is<br>
recycled back to the fuel cell stack by the separation unit 1. Even higher efficiency<br>
may be obtained by increasing the per pass fuel utilization rate above 75%, such as<br>
about 76-80%. At steady-state, the methods of the first and second embodiments<br>
eliminate the need for generating steam when steam methane reformation is used to<br>
create the feed gas to the fuel cell. The fuel exhaust stream contains enough water<br>
vapor to humidify the fuel inlet stream to the stack at steam to carbon ratios of 2 to<br>
2.5. The increase in net fuel utilization and the removal of heat requirement to<br>
generate  steam   increases  the  overall  electrical  efficiency.     In  contrast,  without<br>
-10-<br>
<br>
 <br>
recycling hydrogen, the AC electrical efficiency is about 45% for a fuel utilization<br>
rate within the stack of about 75% to 80%.<br>
