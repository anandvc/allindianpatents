The invention relates to a roll arrangement comprising a roll shaft and at least one roll ring clamped thereon between two annular abutments, of which at least one is removable.<br>
An axially acting clamping device is used for fastening roll rings on roll shafts. It acts between two annular abutments, of which at least one can be removed for the fitting of the roll rings. As a rule, they are formed, on the one hand, by a shaft collar connected to the shaft in one piece and, on the other shaft, and by a threaded ring which sits on a shaft thread (U.S. Pat. No. 4,008,598, U.S. Pat. No.4,117,705). If the shaft is subjected to a bending stress at the location of the threaded ring, the thread does not bear uniformly over the entire periphery, but rather bears mainly on the bending pressure side of the shaft. Since this side revolves, the thread is subjected to an alternating stress, which may lead to failure.<br>
The object of the invention is to provide an arrangement which is able to cope better with the bending stress than a threaded ring.<br>
The solution according to the invention consists in a roll arrangement as described herein, in which the removable abutment is formed by a split ring which is supported on a shaft collar and whose parts are held by a fixing ring which surrounds it. The latter absorbs the extremely high torsional forces acting on the split ring. It is expediently prestressed, in particular shrunk on. For fitting purposes, the outside diameter of the shaft collar, on which the split ring is supported, should be smaller than the inside diameter of the roll ring.<br><br>
l<br>
It   is   known    (DE-A-3022554,    DE-A-211862~) <br>
n	 iiiiiii—iiiii»wi"ii'ii<br>
rings which sit in a shaft groove for absorbing axial forces. However, this does not apply if extremely high torsional forces are acting. According to the invention, these extremely high torsional forces are absorbed by the fixing ring.<br>
The invention is explained in more detail below with reference to the drawing, which illustrates an advantageous exemplary embodiment and in which:<br>
fig. 1 shows a partly sectioned view of the overall arrangement,<br>
fig. 2 shows a longitudinal section through the relevant part of the roll arrangement on an enlarged scale,<br>
fig. 3 shows a cross section,<br>
fig. 4 shows an alternative arrangement, and<br>
figs. 5 and 6 show partial illustrations with different<br>
designs of the split ring and the fixed ring,_., &gt; i^^<br>
The roll rings 2 are mounted in place on the roll shaft 1. They are axially restrained by a clamping device 3. In this case, they are supported on the one side on an abutment formed by the shaft collar 4 and on the other side on a removable abutment 5. The shaft is mounted in the regions 6 and is subjected to a bending stress.<br>
Details of the clamping device 3 and of the removable abutment 5 can be seen from figure 2 . The clamping device corresponds to a known principle (EP-B-34344 0).,, A thrust ring 8 which is supported axially on the adjacent roll ring 2 contains a pistun/cylinder device 9, to which a pressure medium can be directed via the<br><br>
connection 10. The piston/cylinder device 9 presses axially against a "wedge ring" 11, which accommodates an adjusting ring 12 in an annular cutaway portion. The flanks 13 of the wedge ring 11 and cf the adjusting ring 12 which face one another are designed in a sawtooth shape, so that, by rotating the adjusting ring 12 relative to the wedge ring 11, their combined axial length can be adjusted. The axial distance between those end faces of the abutments 4 and 5 which face one another corresponds, with slight fitting clearance, to the combined length of the roll rings 2, the intermediate rings 14 and the clamping device 3 when the latter is located in its axially shortest setting s"ate. Once these parts have been fitted on the shaft 1, pressure is applied to the piston/cylinder device 9, the adjusting ring 12 is tightened and the piston/cylinder device 9 is pressure-relieved. The roll rings are 'then axially clamped between the abutments 4 and 5 by the clamping device 3. To this extent, the arrangement may be regarded as known.<br>
A split insert ring may take the place of the adjusting ring 12 and the saw teeth of the wedge ring 11, the axial dimension of split insert ring corresponding to the distance between the rings 8 and 11 in the hydraulically clamped state (US-A-4117705).<br>
The removable abutment 5 consists of a shaft collar 15 and a ring 16 which is preferably split in half and is supported with an annular nose 17 on the end face of the collar 15. It turns a stop surface 18 toward the adjacent roll ring 2. Since the mean diameter of the stop surface 18 is greater than the mean diameter of the end face of the collar 15, the ring 16 is subjected to a torsional moment 7;hich attempts to twist it away from the shaft in its region adjacent to the roll ring 2 . This is prevented by a fixing ring 19 which is shrunk in place on the split ring 16. Its prestress is<br><br>
so great that the parts of the ring 16 cannot lift from the shaft under the axial force.<br>
As can be seen from figure 3, the parts 16a and 15b of the ring 16 are held together by screws 2 0 or other fastening means, which, however, serve more to provisionally fix the ring parts 16 a, 16b during fitting rather than to fix them under the operational forces. They may be replaced by an'_.- other desired provisionally acting fixing means or may be completely dispensed with.<br>
The split ring 16 turns a first stop surface 18 toward the roll ring or an intermediate ring possibly located between the roll ring 2 and the split ring 16. The axial force transmitted via this surface is transmitted to the shaft collar 15 via a second stop surface 25. The first stop surface 18 has a mean radius 24 and the stop surface 25 has a mean radius 26. The torsional mioment which acts on the split ring 16 due to the di f f erence between the mean radi i 24, 26 is proportional to this difference.<br>
The split ring 16 is supported on the inside (that is to say in the radial direction) via the surface 27 on a corresponding outer surface of the shaft 1, This inner surface 27 has a boundary 28 remote from the roll ring. When the split ring 16 wants to yield to the torsional force referred to, it is supported on the shaft 1 at the inner surface 27 and in particular at its boundary point 28 remote from the roll ring, whereas on the roll-ring side remote from the boundary point 2 8 it tends to lift from the shaft. This lifting is .prevented by the fixing ring 19. The. torsional mioment produced by it about the point 2S and opposed to the torsional deformation is all the greater, the greater its axial distance is from the point 28. The invention therefore teaches  to  make  the  axial  distance  between  that<br><br>
boundary 30, close to the roll ring. of the inner surface 29, via which the fixing ring 19 is supported on the split ring 16, as large as possible, namely at least approximately as large as the difference between the mean first and second radii 24, 26. More precisely, i - is to be at leasr three quarters of this radius difference. It is preferably greater rhan the radius difference.<br>
In some cases, the s"op surface 18 has such a large radial extent that it cannot reasonably be assumed that ic participates fully in the axial force transmission over the entire radial extent. In these cases, of the entire stop surface, only a radially inner part is to be taken into account when dimensioning the first mean radius, namely that part which mainly participates in the axial force transmission.<br>
In the example shown, the split ring 16 is provided with an axially parallel extension 31 remote from the roll ring, so that said order of magnitude of the axial distance between the boundary 30, close to the roll ring, of the inner surface 2 9 of the fixing ring 19 and the boundary 2 8, remore from the roll ring, of the inner surface 27 of the split ring 16 can be maintained. In the exemplary embodiment in fig, 6, the split ring 16, for the same purpose, is of correspondingly long design overall, the second stop surface 25 lying on that side of the inner surface 27 of the split ring 16 which is remote from the roll ring.<br>
In the embodiment alternative according to figure 4, which - insofar as not described belov; - corresponds to the embodiment in figure 2, the fixing ring 21 interacts with the split ring 16 via a conical surface 22. The dimensions are selected in such a way that, when the fixing ring 21 has been pushed completely,<br><br>
i.e. with aligned end face 18, onto the split ring 16, the fixing ring is pres tressed to such a pronounced extent that its prestressing force acting radially inward is greater than the those forces acting radially cutward which act on it under the axial operating forces. As a result, the ring 16 is prevented from lifting from the shaft 1.<br><br><br><br>
