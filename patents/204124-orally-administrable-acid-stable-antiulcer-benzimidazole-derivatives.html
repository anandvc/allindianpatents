The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention  and<br>
the manner in which it is to be performed	GRANTED<br>
26-3-2003<br>
	26 MAR 2004<br><br>
This invention relates to a process for the preparation of orally administrate acid stable  anticulcer benzimidazole derivatives.<br>
Technical Field<br>
The benzimidazole derivatives are polymeric bensimidazoles of the formula I<br><br><br><br>
Formula I<br><br><br>
wherein R6= H or CH3, X = - OCOCH2COO -,<br><br>
or-CONHCH2NHCO-<br><br>
Ry = H, CH3, C2H5 or CONH2, Y = OH or NH2, E = -COO-, B is benzimidazole moiety of the formula IIA.<br><br>
wherein each of R1, R2, R3, R4, R5 = H, C1-12 alkyl, C6-12 (un)substituted aryl, C1-8 alkoxy, C6-12 aryloxy, C1-5 alkoxy carbonyl, C6-12 aryloxy carbonyl, C1-5 alkoxy alkyl, C6-12 alkoxyaryl, C1-5 haloalkyl, C1-5 alkyl or C6-12 aryl thioethers, (un)substituted amines or diamines, (un)substituted amides, halo, cyano, nitro, carboxylic acid or carbocyclic or O, N, S containing heterocyclic ring systems or enantiomers thereof.<br><br><br>
This invention also relates to pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the acid stable antiulcer polymeric benzimidazoles, process for the preparation thereof, formulation comprising the same and process  for the preparation of the formulation.<br>
The compounds of the invention on oral administration inhibit exogenously or endogenously stimulated gastric acid secretion and thus may be used in the treatment / prevention of peptic ulcers, gastro intestinal inflammatory diseases like duodenal / gastric ulcer or gastritis or other gastro intestinal disorders.<br>
Background art<br>
Antiulcer benzimidazoles of the formula II:<br><br>
wherein each of R1, R2, R3, R4, R5 is as defined above, are known to be unstable at neutral or acidic pH of the gastric fluid and undergo decomposition in gastrointestinal fluid on oral administration resulting in loss of activity. Therefore, these compounds are not directly orally ingested. Instead, they are formulated for use by enteric coating or by N-substitution with non-polymeric substituents followed by enteric coating [US Patents Nos 4045563, 5039806 and 5948773, PCT Publications Nos WO 95/32957, W094/27988 and WO 91/19711, EP Patents Nos 176308 and 0045200 and J. Med. Chem., 34,1049(1991) John Sih et al].<br><br><br>
Enteric coated formulations in the form of tablet comprise an initial barrier coating on the active with polymers such as hydroxyl propyl methyl cellulose, polyvinyl pyrrolidone or the like, followed by acid resistant coating with polymers such as cellulose acetate phthalate, hydroxyl propyl methyl phthalate, polyvinyl acetate phthalate or copolymer of methacrylic acid and ethyl acrylate. The method of preparing enteric coated tablet involves provision of multiple coatings and numerous unit operations such as communition, blending, pelletisation, pan coating, drying, spray coating and/or fluid bed coating / drying because of which it is cumbersome, time consuming and expensive. Benzimidazole actives being sensitive to light, moisture and organic solvents such as dichloromethane, acetone or isopropyl alcohol, there are chances of decomposition of the actives during pelletisation thereof. The biologically active compound from such enteric coated formulation is directly released in neutral pH in the intestinal fluid bypassing contact with acidic gastric fluid, where a good percentage of the active is decomposed due to its instability in neutral pH. Thus the bioavailability of benzimidazole actives from enteric coated formulations thereof is low. Antiulcer benzimidazoles are not known or reported to have been formulated into other   oral dosage forms  such as syrup or   suspension.<br>
Bioactives other than benzimidazoles covalently conjugated with synthetic polymers directly or through a reactive functional group are known and reported. For example, progesterone has been conjugated with aliphatic polyesters such as poly-(e-Caprolactone), poly-[e-(+,-)-Calactone], polypivalolactone and poly -(+,-)-dilactide through an ester linkage [(Biomed. Mater. Res, Pitt et al. 1979, 13, 491); (Polymer conjugates with Anticancer Activity, Advances in Polymer Science, D Putnam et al, 1995, Vol 122, Page 55-123, Springer Verlag Berline)]. These polymer conjugates are administered by subdermal route.<br>
US Patent No 4587046 describes covalent conjugation of naturally occurring catecholamines and autocoid moieties with monodisperse amino acid polymers or peptides having an alkyl group through ester/ amide linkages. These conjugates are administered parenterally.<br><br><br>
US Patent No 5783178 describes conjugation of actives like vinca alkaloids, mitomycins, bleomycins, fluconazole, amphotericin B, paclitaxel derivatives, cytokines, erythroprotein or polynucleotides with block copolymer of ethyleneoxy monomer or a mixture of ethyleneoxy monomer or a mixture of ethyleneoxy and the OCH(CH3)CH2 - monomers through bifunctional linking group. This system is mainly used as targeted drug delivery system.<br>
US Patent No. 5510418 describe covalent conjugation of glycosaminoglycan with polyethylene glycol through an ether linkage and is useful for hard/soft tissue augmentation. These polymer-conjugates are to be administered by parenteral route.<br>
Biphenylamine derivatives have been conjugated with polymethacrylic acid. Release of the biphenyl amine derivative from the conjugate was reported only after intraperitoneal injection.<br>
US Patent No 5889078 describes conjugates of biologically active compounds such as cytostatic fluoro uracil with homopolymer of acrylic acids through ester or amide linkages. These polymer conjugates are mainly used as drug delivery system by parenteral route wherein the polymeric backbone after release of the bioactives is difficult to be excreted from the biological system.<br>
US Patent No. 5037883 describes conjugate of actives such as anticancer daunomycin with copolymer of N-(2-hydroxypropyl) acrylamide, N-methacrylamide, N-methacrylic acid and/or N-methacryloylated amino acid through peptide group. These polymer-conjugates are administered by parenteral route.<br>
US Patent No. 5976527 describes conjugates of proteins such as albumin, immunoglobulins, blood clotting factors and peptide hormones with polymethylmethacrylate or polymethacrylamide comprising reactive oxirane groups,<br><br><br>
which after immobilization are used for interaction with biological systems.    These conjugate systems are mainly used for diagnostic purposes and as sorbents for pollutants.<br>
Benzimidazole compounds substituted with polymer at the nitrogen thereof are not known or reported.<br>

The polymeric benzimidazoles of the invention are novel and are found to be acid stable due to the polymeric N-substitution, Therefore, they do not disintegrate in the gastrointestinal fluid and are suitable for oral administration without enteric coating. Since they do not disintegrate in the gastrointestinal fluid, their bioavailability is increased as compared to enteric coated benzimidazoles and their activities are comparable to those of unsubstituted benzimidazoles. Because the process for the preparation of the compounds of the invention eliminates enteric coating, it is simple, less time consuming, less expensive, easy and convenient to carry out. Upon oral administration, under the influence of enzymes / chemicals in the gastrointestinal fluid, the polymeric benzimidazole cleaves at the hydrolysable group (E) to release a N-substituted benzimidazole derivative (i.e. the benzimidazole along with a part of the polymer) having anti-ulcer activity. The remaining part of the polymer is inert, non-toxic and non-absorbable in the gastro intestinal fluid and is excreted from the body as such or as nonabsorbable metabolites thereof. Therefore the polymeric benzimidazole conjugates of the invention are safe for clinical use. The polymeric benzimidazoles of the invention may be formulated into tablets or capsules besides other oral dosage forms such as syrup or suspension.<br>

The distribution of animals in groups, the sequence of trials and the treatment allotted to each group were randomized. Gastric ulceration was produced by pylorus ligation and absolute ethanol administration. In these methods, animals were fasted for 36 hrs before the experiment. Coprohagy was prevented by fasting the animals in cages with grating as the floor. Duodenal ulceration was produced by cysteamine and in this model fasting is not required and hence food and water were made available as libidum till the start of the experiment.  The animals were sacrificed<br><br><br>
using anaesthetic ether after the completion of experiments; the stomachs were removed, opened along the greater curvature, washed with saline and examined with 6.4* (cm diameter) binocular magnifier. Lesions were assessed by two observers unaware of the experimental protocol.<br>
Drug treatment schedule<br>
Drugs used were polymeric benzimidazoles of Examples 1 to 7 (1.5 mg to 10 mg/kg, peroral i.e. p.o.) and unsubstituted and unenteric coated omeprazole (manufactured by us, 0.40 mg/kg p.o ). They were administered per orally 30 minutes after the drug treatment the animals were subjected to any ulcerogenic procedure.<br>
Pylorus ligated rats<br>
Rats were anaesthetized with anaesthetic ether and the portion of abdomen was opened by a small midline incision below the xiphoid process. Pylorus portion of the stomach was lifted and ligated. During this process care was taken to avoid the traction to the pylorus or damage to its blood supply. The stomach was isolated from the body and its contents were collected, measured and centrifuged. The supernatant was used immediately for biochemical analysis for total acidity. Immediately after the removal of the contents from the stomach, they were examined for lesions in the stomach portion which was measured and expressed in terms of ulcer index calculated as the total ulcerated area divided by the total mucosal area.<br>
Ethanol induced gastric mucosal damage<br>
Rats were given 1.0 ml of 100% ethyl alcohol (p.o.) by gavage needle, 30 minutes after the administration of test compound. Two hours after ethanol administration all rats were sacrificed. The area of the glandular portion of the stomach was measured in millimeters. Then the area of; the gastric mucosal damage was calculated in square millimeters and the severity of the gastric mucosal injury was expressed as percentage of the surface area of the glandular stomach.<br><br><br>
Cysteamine-HCl induced duodenal ulcers in rats<br>
Wistar albino rats of either sex were used. Food and water were available and libidum; throughout the study. Duodenal ulcers were induced by two administrations of cysteamine hydrochloride 400 mg /kg. p.o., in 10% aqueous solution at an interval of 4 hour. The drugs under study were administered 30 minutes before each dose of cysteamine hydrochloride. All the animals were sacrificed 24 hours after the first dose of cysteamine and duodenum were excised carefully and opened along the antimesenteric side. The mean ulcer area was obtained by measuring the dimensions of the duodenal ulcer(s) in square millimeters.<br>

EXPRESSIONS OF RESULTS AND STATISTICS<br>
The results were analyzed statistically using the unpaired students 'T'test. The value of P less then 5% (P
IN-VITRO STUDIES<br>
In-vitro digestion of polymeric benzimidazole of Examples 1-5 using simulated gastric and intestinal fluids for 2 and 7 hrs respectively at 37°C, did not show the release of Omeprazole (tested by HPLC procedure given for omeprazole in USP - 23). Similarly, polymeric benzimidazole of Examples 6 and 7 after digestion, did not show release of lansoprazole and pantoprazole (USP-23) respectively. Therefore it should be assumed that the drugs released were derivatives (modified forms) of omeprazole, lansoprazole and pantoprazole respectively.<br>
In-vivo screening of the polymeric benzimidazole of Example 1-7 in rats by pylorus ligation, ethanol induced cytoprotective property and antiduodenal ulcer property reveals significant proton pump inhibiting property at 1.5 - 2 mg/ kg body weight dose.<br>
Conclusions<br>
Polymeric benzimidazoles of Examples 1-7 show significant antiulcer activity in rats in all the three experimental models, viz, pylorus Hgated rats, ethanol induced gastric mucosal injury and cysteamine induced duodenal ulcer. Activities were comparable with that of omeprazole in pylorus ligated rats model.<br><br><br>
