If the compounds of the formula I contain one or more centers of asymmetry, these may have both the S and the R configuration. The compounds may be in the form of optical isomers, of diastereomers, of racemates or of mixtures thereof.<br>
The defined alkyl radicals and partly or completely fluorinated alkyl radicals may be both straight-chain and branched. Groups CaH2a-1 and their analogs as far as<br>
CyyH2yy_i mean either the corresponding alkenyls, cycloalkyls, cycloalkylalkyls or<br>
alkylcycloalkyls.<br>
Appropriate heteroaryls are, in particular, 2- or 3-thienyl, 2- or 3-furyl, 1-, 2- or 3-pyrrolyl, 1-, 2-, 4- or 5-imidazolyl, 1-, 3-, 4- or 5-pyrazolyl, 1,2,3-triazoM-, -4- or 5-yl, 1,2,4-triazol-1-, -3- or -5-yl, 1- or 5-tetrazolyl, 2-, 4- or 5-oxazolyl, 3-, 4- or 5-isoxazolyl, 1,2,3-oxadiazol-4- or 5-yl, 1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-or 5-yl, 1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl or -5-yl, 2-, 4-or 5-thiazolyl, 3-, 4- or 5-isothiazolyl, 1,3,4-thiadiazol-2- or -5-yl, 1,2,4-thiadiazol-3- or -5-yl, 1,2,3-thiadiazo!-4- or 5-yl, 2-, 3- or 4-pyridyl, 2-, 4-, 5- or 6-pyrimidinyl, 3- or 4-pyridazinyl, pyrazinyl, 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6- or 7-indolyl, 1-, 2-, 4- or 5-benzimidazolyl, 1-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6- or 7-indazolyl, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7- or 8-quinolyl, 1-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7- or 8-isoquinolyl, 2-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7- or 8-quinazolinyl, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7- or 8-cinnolinyl, 2-, 3-, 5-, 6-, 7- or 8-quinoxalinyl, 1-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7- or 8-phthalazinyl. The corresponding<br><br>
N-oxides of these compounds are additionally encompassed, that is to say, for example, 1-oxy-2-, 3- or4-pyridyl.<br>
Of these, the 5- or 6-membered heterocycles are preferred. The particularly preferred heterocycles are imidazolyl, pyrazolyl, pyrrolyl, triazolyl, tetrazolyl, thiazolyl and oxazolyl.<br>
The terminal CH3 groups in an alkyl chain are also regarded as CH2 units and are in this connection viewed as CH2 groups.<br>
Methods for preparing the compounds used are also described.<br>
Thus, the substances described herein can be prepared starting from the benzylamine precursors IV. These in turn can, if not obtainable commercially, be synthesized by standard processes from the corresponding benzyl chlorides or bromides III.<br><br>
The benzylamines IV obtained in this way are alkylated in a manner known to the skilled worker with the appropriately substituted alpha-bromoacetophenone compounds V.<br><br><br><br>
When R6 is not equal to H, the desired compounds of the formula I can be prepared for example from the iodides VIII by halogen/metal exchange and subsequent nucleophilic attack of the intermediate organolithium species on the carbonyl group (cf. Chem. Pharm. Bull.; 1995,43, 1543).<br><br>
The tertiary alcohols synthesized in this way can be converted by known methods into other derivatives.<br>
Alkyl-branched analogs (I) are prepared by alkylating the corresponding diphenylacetic esters X in the alpha position by known methods. The desired product XI can be converted by standard processes into the corresponding amides XII, which are converted into the desired tetrahydroisoquinolines I in a Pictet-Spengler-analogous reaction (cf. Tetrahedron; 1987,43,439; Chem. Pharm. Bull.; 1985, 33, 340).<br><br><br>
Compounds of the type I are described in the published specifications WO 01 32 624 and WO 01 32 625 as norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin reuptake inhibitors. However, these patent applications protect exclusively compounds in which R1 and R2 may be exclusively H. It has emerged, however, with the compounds according to the invention that at least for R2 it is necessary that R2 is not equal to H. In addition, it was not possible to detect by means of an exemplary compound of the compounds according to the invention any inhibitory properties on the described receptors, so that the described compounds differ distinctly both in structure and in their pharmacological properties from the compounds described in the patent applications mentioned.<br>
In addition, compounds of type I are described in the patent specification EP 11 13 007 as estrogen agonists and antagonists. It was possible to show that the compounds i     according to the invention show no activity on said receptors, so that the structural differences of the compounds according to the invention result in distinctly different pharmacological properties in this regard too.<br><br>
It was possible to show that compounds of the formula I are excellent inhibitors of the sodium-hydrogen exchanger (NHE) - especially of the sodium-hydrogen exchanger of subtype 3 (NHE3).<br>
On the basis of these properties, the compounds are suitable for the treatment of disorders caused by oxygen deficiency. The compounds are, as a result of their pharmacological properties, outstandingly suitable as antiarrhythmic medicaments with a cardioprotective component for prophylaxis of infarction and for treatment of infarction, and for the treatment of angina pectoris, in which connection they also inhibit or greatly reduce in a preventive manner the pathophysiological processes associated with the development of ischemia-induced damage, in particular in the induction of ischemia-induced cardiac arrhythmias. Because of their protective effects against pathological hypoxic and ischemic situations, the compounds of the formu\a I which are used according to the invention can, as a result of inhibition of the cellular Na+/H+ exchange mechanism, be used as medicaments for the treatment of all acute or chronic damage induced by ischemia or disorders induced primarily or secondarily thereby. This relates to the use thereof as medicaments for surgical interventions, e.g. in organ transplantations, in which cases the compounds can be used both to protect the organs in the donor before and during removal, to protect removed organs for example on treatment with or storage thereof in physiological bath fluids, as well as during the transfer into the recipient organism. The compounds are likewise valuable medicaments with a protective action during the performance of angioplastic surgical interventions, for example on the heart as well as peripheral vessels. In accordance with their protective action against ischemia-induced damage, the compounds are also suitable as medicaments for the treatment of ischemias of the nervous system, especially of the CNS, in which connection they are suitable for example for the treatment of stroke or of cerebral edema. In addition, the compounds of the formula i which are used according to the invention are likewise suitable for the treatment of types of shock, such as, for example, of allergic, cardiogenic, hypovolemic and bacterial shock.<br><br>
In addition, the compounds induce an improvement in the respiratory drive and are therefore used to treat respiratory conditions associated with the following clinical conditions and diseases: disturbance of central respiratory drive (e.g. central sleep apnea, sudden infant death, postoperative hypoxia), muscle-related breathing disorders, breathing disorders after long-term ventilation, breathing disorders associated with altitude adaptation, obstructive and mixed type of sleep apnea, acute and chronic pulmonary disorders with hypoxia and hypercapnia. The compounds additionally increase the tone of the muscles of the upper airways, so that snoring is suppressed.<br>
A combination of an NHE inhibitor with a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (e.g. acetazolamide), the latter inducing metabolic acidosis and thus itself increasing respiratory activity, proves to be advantageous due to an enhanced effect and reduced use of active ingredient.<br>
It has emerged that the compounds used according to the invention have a mild laxative effect and accordingly can be used advantageously as laxatives or if there is a risk of constipation, in which case the prevention of the ischemic damage associated with constipation in the intestinal region is particularly advantageous.<br>
It is additionally possible to prevent the formation of gall stones.<br>
The compounds of the formula I used according to the invention are furthermore distinguished by a strong inhibitory effect on the proliferation of cells, for example of fibroblast cell proliferation and the proliferation of smooth muscular muscle cells. The compounds of the formula I are therefore suitable as valuable therapeutic agents for diseases in which cell proliferation represents a primary or secondary cause, and can therefore be used as antiatherosderotic agents, agents to prevent late complications of diabetes, cancers, fibrotic disorders such as pulmonary fibrosis, hepatic fibrosis or renal fibrosis, organ hypertrophies and hyperplasias, in particular for prostate hyperplasia or prostate hypertrophy.<br><br>
The compounds used according to the invention are effective inhibitors of the cellular sodium-proton antiporter (Na/H exchanger) which is elevated in numerous disorders (essential hypertension, atherosclerosis, diabetes, etc.), also in those cells which are readily amenable to measurements, such as, for example, in erythrocytes, platelets or leukocytes. The compounds used according to the invention are therefore suitable as excellent and simple scientific tools, for example in their use as diagnostic agents for determining and distinguishing different types of hypertension, but also of atherosclerosis, of diabetes, proliferative disorders etc. The compounds of the formula I are moreover suitable for preventive therapy to prevent the development of high blood pressure, for example of essential hypertension.<br>
It has additionally been found that NHE inhibitors show a beneficial effect on serum lipoproteins. It is generally acknowledged that blood lipid levels which are too high, so-called hyperlipoproteinemias, represent a considerable risk factor for the development of arteriosclerotic vascular lesions, especially coronary heart disease. The reduction of elevated serum lipoproteins therefore has exceptional importance for the prophylaxis and regression of atherosclerotic lesions. The compounds used according to the invention can therefore be used for the prophylaxis and regression of atherosclerotic lesions by eliminating a causal risk factor. With this protection of the vessels against the syndrome of endothelial dysfunction, compounds of the formula I are valuable medicaments for the prevention and treatment of coronary vasospasms, of atherogenesis and of atherosclerosis, of left-ventricular hypertrophy and of dilated cardiomyopathy, and thrombotic disorders.<br>
Said compounds are therefore advantageously used for producing a medicament for the prevention and treatment of sleep apneas and muscle-related respiratory disorders; for producing a medicament for the prevention and treatment of snoring; for producing a medicament for lowering blood pressure; for producing a medicament for the prevention and treatment of disorders induced by ischemia and reperfusion of central and peripheral organs, such as acute renal failure, stroke, endogenous states of shock, intestinal disorders etc.; for producing a medicament for the treatment of late damage from diabetes and chronic renal disorders, in particular of all inflammations of<br><br>
the kidneys (nephritides) which are associated with increased protein/albumin excretion; for producing a medicament for the treatment of infection by ectoparasites in human and veterinary medicine; for producing a medicament for the treatment of said disorders in combinations with hypotensive substances, preferably with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, with diuretics and saluretics such as furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide, pseudoaldosterone antagonists and aldosterone antagonists; with adenosine receptor modulators, in particular with adenosine receptor activators (A2 agonists); and with angiotensin receptor antagonists.<br>
The administration of sodium-proton exchange inhibitors of the formula I as novel medicaments for lowering elevated blood lipid levels, and the combination of sodium-proton exchange inhibitors with hypotensive medicaments and/or medicaments with hypolipidemic activity is claimed.<br>
Medicaments which comprise a compound I can in this connection be administered orally, parenterally, intravenously, rectally, transdermally or by inhalation, the preferred administration being dependent on the particular characteristics of the disorder. The compounds I may moreover be used alone or together with pharmaceutical excipients, both in veterinary medicine and in human medicine.<br>
The excipients suitable for the desired pharmaceutical formulation are familiar to the skilled worker on the basis of his expert knowledge. Besides solvents, gel formers, suppository bases, tablet excipients, and other active ingredient carriers, it is possible to use, for example, antioxidants, dispersants, emulsifiers, antifoams, flavorings, preservatives, solubilizers or colors.<br>
For a form for oral administration, the active compounds are mixed with additives suitable for this purpose, such as carriers, stabilizers or inert diluents, and converted by conventional methods into suitable dosage forms such as tablets, coated tablets, hard gelatin capsules, aqueous, alcoholic or oily solutions. Examples of inert carriers which can be used are gum arable, magnesia, magnesium carbonate, potassium phosphate, lactose, glucose or starch, especially corn starch. It is moreover possible<br><br>
for the preparation to take place both as dry granules and as wet granules. Examples of suitable oily carriers or solvents are vegetable or animal oils such as sunflower oil or fish liver oil.<br>
For subcutaneous or intravenous administration, the active compounds used are converted, if desired with the substances customary for this purpose, such as solubilizers, emulsifiers or other excipients, into a solution, suspension or emulsion. Examples of suitable solvents are: water, physiological saline or alcohols, e.g. ethanol, propanol, glycerol, as well as sugar solutions such as glucose or mannitol solutions, or else a mixture of the various solvents mentioned.<br>
Suitable as pharmaceutical formulation for administration in the form of aerosols or sprays are, for example, solutions, suspensions or emulsions of the active ingredient of the formula I in a pharmaceutically acceptable solvent such as, in particular, ethanol or water, or a mixture of such solvents.<br>
The formulation may, if required, also contain other pharmaceutical excipients such as surfactants, emulsifiers and stabilizers, and a propellant gas. Such a preparation normally contains the active ingredient in a concentration of about 0.1 to 10, in particular of about 0.3 to 3, % by weight.<br>
The dosage of the active ingredient of the formula I to be administered, and the frequency of administration, depend on the potency and duration of action of the compounds used; additionally also on the nature and severity of the disorder to be treated and on the sex, age, weight and individual responsiveness of the mammal to be treated.<br>
On average, the daily dose of a compound of the formula I for a patient weighing about 75 kg is at least 0.001 mg/kg, preferably 0.01 mg/kg, to a maximum of 10 mg/kg, preferably 1 mg/kg, of body weight. For acute episodes of the disorder, for example immediately after suffering a myocardial infarction, higher and, in particular, more frequent dosages may also be necessary, e.g. up to 4 single doses a day. Up to<br><br>
200 mg a day may be necessary, in particular on i.v. administration, for example for a patient with infarction in the intensive care unit.<br>

Example 7: 4-(6,8-Dichloro-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-4-yl)-N-ethyl-benzamide, trifluoroacetate; <br>
146 mg (0.43 mmol) of 4-(6,8-dichloro-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-isoquinolin-4-yl)-benzoic acid (see example 6) are dissolved in 5 ml of DMF, and 1.0 equivalent of triethylamine is added. At 0°C, a solution of 141 mg (0.43 mmol) TOTU in 3 ml of DMF is added. The mixture is stirred at 0QC for 30 min and at room temperature for 30 min. This solution is then added at 0°C to a solution of 0.28 ml of 2 M ethylamine solution and 0.06 ml (0.043 mmol) of triethylamine in 5 ml of DMF, and the reaction mixture is<br><br>
stirred at room temperature for three hours. For workup, the solvent is distilled off in vacuo, and the residue is taken up in ethyl acetate and washed twice with 1 N KOH and once with H2O. The organic phase is dried with Na2SC&gt;4 and concentrated. Chromatography on silica gel (dichloromethane/methanol 95:5) is used for further purification. Further purification on a preparative HPLC (acetonitrile/H20/trifluoroacetic acid) affords the desired carboxamide as trifluoroacetate (Rj = 4.169 min (method A);<br>

(0.045 mmol) of 2,2-bis-(diphenylphosphino)-1,1-binaphthyl are introduced into 5 ml of abs. toluene. Under argon, a solution of 0.104 ml (1.2 mmol) of morpholine in 2.5 ml of abs. DMF, and a solution of 371 mg (1.0 mmol) of 4-(4-bromo-phenyl)-6,8-dichloro-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline in 2.5 ml of abs. toluene are added, and the mixture is stirred at 100°C for a total of 9 hours. For workup, the solvent is removed, the residue is taken up in dichloromethane, and insoluble constituents are filtered off. After concentration of the filtrate, the residue is chromatographed on silica gel (CH2CI2<br>
/methanol 95:5), resulting in 350 mg of the desired morpholine derivative. After a further purification on a preparative HPLC it is possible to isolate 160 mg of the corresponding trifluoroacetate in the form of a colorless solid.<br>

The intracellular acidification was induced by adding 975 pi of an NH4CI-free buffer (see below) to 25 //I aliquots of the cells incubated in NH4CI buffer. The subsequent<br>
rate of pH recovery was recorded for two minutes with NHE1, five minutes with NHE2 and three minutes with NHE3. To calculate the inhibitory potency of the tested substances, the cells were initially investigated in buffers with which a complete or absolutely no pH recovery took place. For complete pH recovery (100%), the cells were incubated in Na+-containing buffer (133.8 mM NaCI, 4.7 mM KCI, 1.25 mM CaCl2» 1.25 mM MgCl2, 0.97 mM Na2HPC&gt;4, 0.23 mM NaH2PC&gt;4, 5 mM Hepes, 5 mM glucose, a pH of 7.0 is adjusted with 1 M NaOH). To determine the 0% value, the cells were incubated in an Na+-free buffer (133.8 mM choline chloride, 4.7 mM KCI, 1.25 mM CaCl2, 1.25 mM MgCl2, 0.97 mM K2HPO4, 0.23 mM KH2P04, 5 mM Hepes, 5 mM glucose, a pH of 7.0 is adjusted with 1 M NaOH). The substances to be tested<br>
were made up in the Na+-containing buffer. The recovery of the intracellular pH at each test concentration of a substance was expressed as a percentage of the maximum recovery. The IC50 value for the particular substance for the individual NHE subtypes was calculated from the pH recovery percentages using the Sigma-Plot<br>
