				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is an improvement in the industrial preparation of (2S,3oS,7aS)-l-[2-[l-(ethoxycarbonyl)-(S)-butylamine]-(S)-propionyl]- octahydroindole-2-carboxylic acid of Formula I<br><br>
and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts.<br>
This relates to invention disclosed and claimed in our co-pending application no 709/CHE/2005<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Perindopril, and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, more specifically the tert-Butylamine salt, have valuable pharmacological properties. Their principal property lies in the inhibition of the enzyme that converts angiotensin I (or kininase II), which enables on the one hand prevention of the conversion of the decapeptide angiotensin I to the octapeptide angiotensin II (vasoconstrictor) and on the other hand prevention of the degradation of bradykinin (vasodilator) to inactive peptide. These two actions contribute to the beneficial effects of perindopril in cardiovascular disorders, especially arterial hypertension and cardiac insufficiency.<br>
Perindopril, its preparation and its therapeutic use have been for the first time, described in US 4,508,729.<br>
Several methods for the preparation of perindopril of Formula (I) are already known, but on an industrial scale these processes have significant disadvantages. EP 308 341 B1 describes the industrial synthesis of perindopril by catalytic hydrogenation of (2S)-2,3-dihydroindole-2-carboxylic acid, followed by coupling of the resulting (2S,3aS, 7aS)-octahydroindole-2-carboxylic acid benzyl ester with N-[(S)-l-carboxybutyl]-(S)-alanine ethyl ester, and then deprotection of the carboxylic group of heterocycle by catalytic hydrogenation. This process has the advantage of yielding perindopril in a good yield. However, the purity of the perindopril obtained by this process is not satisfactory, and necessitates a purification step in order to obtain perindopril of a quality that would allow its use as a pharmaceutical active agent. Indeed, under the conditions described in the patent specification the perindopril obtained is contaminated by significant amounts of the impurities (dicyclohexyl urea derivatives) of the following formulae which are also pharmacoepial impurities.<br><br>
EP 309 324 B1 describes a process for obtaining a compound of formula (I) by reacting alanine benzyl ester with ethyl a-bromovalerate in dimethylformamide in the presence of triethylamine to obtain carboethoxy benzyl ester followed by deprotection to give perindopril. The major drawbacks of this process are the number of steps involved and the low yield of the (S,S) isomer. Indeed, since the reaction is not diastereoselective, a purification step is required in order to obtain the pure (S,S) isomer, which comprises fractional crystallization in the presence of maleic acid.<br>
EP 1 333 026 A1 describes the synthesis of perindopril by acylating the N-[(S)-1- carboethoxybutyl]-(S)-alanine with a suitable carbonic acid like methyl chloroformate, ethyl chloroformate, and benzyl chloroformate respectively in an inert organic solvent and in the presence of a base. The N-protected carbonic acid derivative is then activated with thionyl chloride which is subsequently coupled with 2-carboxyperhydroindole derivative which after deprotection gives perindopril.<br>
It would be apparent from the above processes that while there are several known methods available for synthesis of perindopril, however, most of the methods either involve utilization of hazardous or costly coupling agent like dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. Further, it is difficult to remove completely the byproduct, dicyclohexylurea derivatives from the final perindopril obtained. These in turn lead to complexities in the manufacture and render the methods to obtain perindopril less cost-effective.<br>
Given the pharmaceutical interest in this compound, it is important to be able to obtain it by cost effective process that can be readily applied on an industrial scale, yielding perindopril in a good yield and, especially, with an excellent degree of purity.<br>
The inventors have now developed a new industrial process that, requires less laborious purification, yielding perindopril in a single reaction step with a purity that is compatible with its use as a pharmaceutical active ingredient, totally free of the above mentioned pharmacoepial impurities.<br>
OBJECTIVES OF INVENTION<br>
The objective of the present invention is to develop an improved process for the preparation of perindopril without requiring laborious purification and free of pharmacoepial impurities which in turn can be used as Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of Perindopril of Formula I<br>
 Formula I<br>
which comprises reacting the compound of Formula II<br>
 Formula II<br>
wherein R represents H or a protecting group<br>
with a carbonic acid derivative of compound Formula III<br>
 Formula III<br>
wherein R' represents aryl, substituted aryl and subsequent N-acylation of compound of Formula IV<br>
 Formula IV<br>
wherein R" represents benzyl, substituted benzyl<br>
in the presence of base to obtain a compound of Formula V<br>
wherein R, R" are defined as above,<br>
which on deprotection by catalytic hydrogenation gives compound of Formula I. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention describes an improved process for the preparation of perindopril free of pharmacoepial impurities without requiring laborious purification steps.<br>
The aim of the present invention is to eliminate the formation of dicyclohexyl carbodiimide related pharmacoepial impurities. This has been achieved by avoiding dicyclohexylcarbodiimide in the synthesis of perindopril.<br>
The inventors have found that by activating the compounds of general Formula II with the compounds of general Formula III, like 4-nitrophenyl chloroformate in the presence of a base and subsequently achieving N-acylation of the perhydroindole moiety.<br>
The condensations of compound of Formula II with compounds of Formula III and subsequent N-acylation of compound of Formula IV with the compound resulting from condensation of compounds of Formula II and III, is carried out in the presence or absence of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole derivative.<br>
The above coupling reaction is effected in halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, esters, ethers, alcohols, nitriles, ketones, more preferably acetonitrile.<br>
More particularly, the present invention relates to a process, which comprises coupling of the protected perhydroindole moiety of Formula IV with compounds of general Formula II, followed by deprotection yielding perindopril in a single reaction step.<br>
Examples of bases are alkali metal hydroxides, alkali carbonate, alkali hydrogen carbonate, organic bases like triethylamine, N-methyl morpholine, diisopropyl amine and 4-dimethylaminopyridine.<br>
Aryl group as referred herein refers to phenyl, substituted aryl refers to 4- nitrophenyl cloroformate.<br>
Examples of carbonic acid derivative used in the present invention are phenyl chloroformate, 4-methoxyphenylchloroformate, 4-chlorophenylchloroformate, 2,4-dinitrophenylchloroformate, 4-trifluoromethylphenylchloroformate, 4- nitrophenylchloroformate, 2-nitrophenylchloroformate, more preferably 4- nitrophenylchloroformate.<br>
Examples of benzotriazole derivative are 1-hydroxybenzotriazole, l-hydroxy-5- chlorobenzotriazole and l-hydroxy-7-azabenzotriazole, 3-hydroxy-3,4- dihydroxybenzotriazole-4-one.<br>
The reaction is carried out at a temperature ranging between -20 °C and 60 °C, more preferably at 0-30 °C.<br>
After completion of the reaction, the reaction mass is washed with DM water, aqueous base, aqueous acid and finally with aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution. Organic layer is concentrated under reduced pressure, which on deprotection leads to perindopril.<br>
Deprotection is conveniently carried out using Pd/C in an organic solvent selected from hydrocarbons, halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, esters, alcohols, ethers, ketones, water and their mixtures, more preferably methyl tert.butylether.<br>
