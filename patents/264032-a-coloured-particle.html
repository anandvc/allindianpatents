				<td>DETERGENT COMPOSITIONS COMPRISING COLOURED PARTICLES<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to coloured particles for use in detergent compositions which are added to impart a hueing effect on fabrics laundered using such detergents.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The marketing of detergent products often involves the use of distinctive product aesthetics to help consumer differentiate one given product from another commercially available product of the same general type. Colored e.g. dyed or pigmented, speckles are sometimes used to create distinctiveness. It has been found that some consumers associate products having dyed particles with improved cleaning so that the consumer acceptance of products comprising colored particle can be higher than products not comprising such colored particles. Furthermore, the use of dyes or pigments to provide wash water with a blue colour is also known and has historically been associated with better cleaning of white fabrics. Such "blueing" of the wash water has been achieved by additives containing dyes or pigments for adding directly to the wash water in addition to the laundry detergent. Attempts have been made to incorporate coloured agents into detergent compositions, either to provide particular product aesthetics, blueing of the wash water or even to increase perceived cleaning of white fabrics. However, problems have been associated with the use of dyes or pigments directly in detergents, particularly that they can lead to spotting or staining of the fabrics being laundered.<br>
Examples of art in this area include WOOO/27980, which discloses speckle particles having a specific sparkle index and transparency index which is colored by addition of a dye pigment and/or brightener. US 6,541,437 discloses speckled detergent compositions comprising colored glassy phosphates. US 4,097,418 relates to agglomerate colored speckles for use with white or lightly colored detergent granules to provide detergent composition having a distinctive and attractive appearance and which - because of the nature of the agglomerate colored speckles - are non-staining to fabric in use. US 4,671,886 discloses mixing finely divided pigments which form large visible agglomerates with a non-agglomerating granular diluent. This is said to prevent or reduce the formation of visible agglomerates of pigment and prevent staining problems. The premix is used to color granular products such as spray dried granules. However, in all the prior art relating to coloured particles, the issue of fabric staining is so sensitive that particles<br><br>
containing dyes or pigments always do so at low levels to avoid localized high concentrations of colouring materials. For example, US 3,931,037 describes granular detergent product substantially uncolored in its dry state which contains coloring materials. These particles are said not to be subject to separation and segregation and to be readily soluble or dispersible when the detergent is mixed with water to form a colored washing solution.<br>
The present inventors have found that hueing agents such as pigments and/or dyes may be incorporated into detergent particles without causing staining of items to be washed when incorporated in a detergent composition. The particles according to the invention can incorporate relatively high levels of dye and/or pigment and enable use of such particles in detergent compositions at relatively high levels without causing fabric staining or spotting. The present inventors have now found that by incorporating a suspending agent for the hueing agent in the coloured particles, the problems of the prior art are alleviated. Without wishing to be bound by theory the inventors believe that this is because on contact of the detergent composition with water, the coloured particles rapidly dissolve/disintegrate. However, the deposition of the hueing agent is slowed by the suspending agent until concentrated regions of hueing agent are dispersed and this ensures that spotting of the hueing agent, or staining on the fabrics being laundered is substantially avoided.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a coloured particle for use in a detergent composition, the particle comprising a coloured ingredient which is a hueing agent, and a binder, characterized in that the coloured particle also comprises a suspending agent or suspending agent precursor. The invention also comprises detergent compositions comprising the coloured particles.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The colored particle<br>
The colored particle typically has a particle size distribution (PSD) between 250 urn and 2500 um, preferably 500 urn and 2000 (am, and more preferably between 700 urn and 1400 urn. Preferably, the colored particle of the present invention has a Mean Particle Size (MPS) between 700 um and 1500 urn, and preferably between 800 um and 1200 um<br><br>
The Particle Size Distribution (PSD) and Mean particle Size (MPS)<br>
The PSD and MPS of the colored particle of the present invention are measured as follows. The particle size distribution of granular detergent products, intermediates and raw materials are measured by sieving the granules/powders through a succession of sieves with gradually smaller dimensions. The weight of material retained on each sieve is then used to calculate a particle size distribution and median or mean particle size.<br>
Equipment: RoTap Testing Sieve Shaker Model B (as supplied by: W.S. Tyler Company, Cleveland, Ohio), supplied with cast iron sieve stack lid with centrally mounted cork. The RoTap should be bolted directly to a flat solid inflexible base, preferably the floor. The tapping speed used should be 6 taps/minute with a 12 rpm elliptical motion. Samples used should weight 100 g, and total sieving time should be set at 5 mins.<br>
Particle Size Distribution: The fraction on each sieve is calculated from the following equation:<br>
Fraction on sieve (%) =<br>
Mass on sieve (g) x 100<br>
Original sample weight (g)<br>
If this calculation is done for each sieve size used then a particle size distribution is obtained. However a cumulative particle size distribution is of more use. The cumulative distribution is calculated by adding the fractions on a particular sieve to the fractions on sieves above it (i.e. of higher mesh size).<br>
Calculation of Mean particle size: Mean Particle Size is the geometric mean particle size on a mass basis calculated as the X intercept of the weighted regression line on the sigma versus log (size) plot.<br>
The free moisture content (water that is not chemically bound) of the coloured particle of the invention is typically no greater than 5 % by weight of the coloured particle, preferably no greater than 2% by weight or even no greater than 1.5 or 1% by weight of the particle.<br>
The colored ingredient<br>
The colored detergent ingredient of the present invention can be any detergent ingredient which<br>
has a substantially intense color as a raw material, such as enzymes, colored or dark clays. For the<br><br>
purpose of the present invention, the colored detergent ingredient is a hueing agent. The present invention enables the formulator to incorporate such hueing agents into detergent compositions in order to bring color to the fabric or wash solution.<br>
A hueing agent is defined as a compound which upon washing provides white fabrics with a light off-white tint, modifying whiteness appearance and acceptance (e.g. bluish white, pinkish white). It can be colored material depositing on fabrics such as a pigment, a dye or a photo-bleach.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the hueing agent is selected from pigments , dyes, photo-bleaches and mixtures thereof, more preferably the hueing agent is selected from dyes and pigments. The invention is particularly applicable to hueing agents comprising pigments, preferably Ultra Marine Blue.<br>
The hueing agent may be incorporated into the coloured particles of the invention in amount of at least 8 wt%, preferably in amounts of at least 10 wt% or from 12, or 15 or even from 20 wt% based on the total weight of the particle. Generally the coloured particles will contain up to 75 wt% or up to 60 wt% or up to 50 wt% hueing agent. Where the hueing agent is a dye, lower levels are also acceptable for example from 0.5 to 10 wt% or even from 1 to 10 wt% or from 3 or 5tolOwt%.<br>
Pigments<br>
The colored detergent particle preferably comprises a pigment as a hueing agent. A pigment is a finely divided colouring material. Any pigment suitable for detergent compositions may be used herein. Pigments are insoluble colorants. Examples of pigments are Monastral Violet = Violet 19, Pigment Scarlet = Red 60, Blue cobaltous aluminate, and a most preferred example is Ultra Marine Blue pigment (e.g. CI 77007 - Pigment Blue 29). Other examples are the coloured pigments disclosed in US 4,671,886.<br>
Dyes<br>
Dyes are water soluble or water dispersible compounds that color the material onto which they have been anchored, by selectively absorbing certain wavelength of light. The principle feature of dyes is a conjugated system, allowing them to absorb energy in the visible part of the spectra. Most common conjugated systems are phtalocyanine, anthraquinone, azo, phenyl groups, referred to as chromophore. Dyes can be chosen from the following categories: reactive dyes, direct dyes,<br><br>
sulphur and azoic dyes, acid dyes and disperse dyes. Direct dyes are water soluble molecules. Examples of direct dyes are Direct orange 18, direct blue 86, direct yellow 50 = lemon yellow, direct red 80 = basic red. Reactive dyes are for example dichloro triazine, dichloro quinoxaline, chlorodifluoropyrimidine. Disperse dyes are for example disperse red 13, violet 33 = fuchsia, Blue C-4RA = National blue. Suitable dyes for use in the coloured particles of the invention comprise Polar Brilliant Blue GAW 180% sold by Ciba-Geigy SA, (similar to C.I. (Colour Index) 61135 - Acid Blue 127), FD&amp;C Blue No. 1 (CI 42090), Rhodamine BM (CI 45170), Pontacyl Light Yellow 36 (similar to CI 18820), Polar Brilliant Blue RAW (CI 61585 - Acid Blue 80).<br>
Photo-bleaches<br>
Photo-bleaches are molecules, which absorb the energy from sunlight and transfer it by reacting with an other molecule (typically oxygen) to produce a bleaching specie (singlet oxygen). Photo-bleaches are extensively conjugated rings, and therefore usually present a strong visible color. Typical compounds are phthalocyanines, based on zinc, copper, or aluminum. Examples include phthalocyanine blue (CI 74160) and phthalocyanine green (CI 74260).<br>
The particles of the present invention comprise both a binder and either a suspending agent or suspending agent precursor. The binding agent is any conventional binder used in detergent compositions which dissolves or disintegrates on contact of the coloured detergent particle with the wash water in the presence of a detergent composition. Suitable binders may gel at very high concentrations in aqueous detergent solutions, but at low concentrations such as in the wash water will substantially completely dissolve or disperse to enable the contents of the particle to be released in the wash water. In this context, "low concentration" means at the concentrations typical of the amount of binder present when the coloured particles of the invention are incorporated into a detergent composition which is used in a wash process at its typical dosage levels. Binders are mixed with the other coniponents of the particle in a liquid form, for example they are either liquid at the temperature of mixing or they are mixed with the other coniponents to form the coloured particle in the form of an aqueous solution.<br>
In addition, the coloured particles of the invention also comprise a suspending agent or pre-cursor thereof. In contrast to the binders, the suspending agents either already present in the particle or formed by reaction of the pre-cursor on contact of the particle with water, preferably remain in the form of a gel even at low concentrations in the wash water. Dispersed gel phases in the wash water are also acceptable.<br><br>
Thus, for example a cellulose may be used to provide a binder and a cellulose may be used to provide a suspending agent, however, they will be different forms of cellulose e.g. they will have different molecular weights (lower for binding and higher for suspending) and/or different degrees of substitution, as the former will need to be provided in aqueous solution to be mixed with the other ingredients of the particle and then need to dissolve or disperse in the wash solution allowing the particle to dissolve, whereas the suspending agent needs to provide a surface area for suspending the hueing agent in the wash water and is either insoluble or in a gel phase in the wash water.<br>
Binders<br>
Any binder material can be used herein. Preferred binders are selected from synthetic organic polymers such as polyethylene glycols, polyvinylpyrrolidones, polyacetates, polymeric polycarboxylates such as water-soluble acrylate copolymers, cationic polymers such as ethoxylated hexamethylene diamine quaternary compounds, surfactants, liquid glucose, sugars and sugar alcohol such as sorbitol, manitol, Xylitol and mixtures thereof. Most preferred binders also have an active cleaning function in the wash such as the cationic polymers, surfactants or other examples include, bishexamethylene triamines or pentaamines, ethoxylated polyethylene amines, maleic/acrylic homo- or co-polymers.<br>
Particularly preferred binders include the polymeric polycarboxylates such as acrylic acid homopolymers or copolymers with maleic acid or salts thereof, such as those sold by Rohm and Haas under the Sokolan trade name. A further class of preferred binders is surfactants. Surfactants may be anionic, nonionic, zwitterionic, cationic or mixtures thereof. Anionic surfactants are particularly preferred. Examples of suitable surfactants are given below in the definition of surfactants suitable for use in the detergent composition as a whole. Preferred anionic surfactants include alkyl sulphates and alkyl benzene sulphonates either alone or in admixture with one another or additional binders.<br>
The binder is generally present in the coloured particle in amounts from 2 to 50 % by weight of the coloured particle. More typically the binder will be present in amounts from 5 to 40 % by weight or even from 10 to 25 % by weight based on the weight of the particle.<br><br>
Suspending Agent and Suspending Agent Pre-cursor<br>
The suspending agent may comprise any water- swellable component which may be slowly water-soluble or insoluble in the alkaline wash liquor and which suspends the hueing agent as the coloured particles dissolve/disintegrate so that high localized concentrations of the hueing agent are dispersed prior to deposition of the hueing agent on the fabric surface. They may also assist in rapid disintegrating of the coloured particle. Examples of suitable materials include Acacia, Alginic Acid, Carbomer, Dextrin, Gelatin, Guar Gum, Hydrogenated vegetable oil type 1, Magnesium aluminum silicate, Maltodextrin, Methylcellulose, polymethacrylates, povidone, sodium alginate, starch and zein. Crosslinked polymers (water insoluble) such as crosslinked cellulose, crosslinked starch, crosslinked CMC, crosslinked carboxymethyl starch, crosslinked polyacrylates (Acusol771/772 from Rohm &amp; Haas), and crosslinked polyvinyl pyrrolidones such as Sokolan HP62G from BASF), anionic exchange resins such as those based on polyacrylate or sulfonate (such as TD8 from Rohm &amp; Haas) are also suitable. CMC cross-linked with aluminium III ions providing an insoluble disintegrant at pH 7 which dissolves when Al ions are released as the pH increases to around 10 in the wash water may also be used. Arbocel, Nymcel, Neutrogel and Polygel may be suitable. Swelling clays such as bentonite and laponite may be suitable suspending agents.<br>
Water-swellable cellulosic materials are preferred.    Particularly preferred are optionally substituted alkyl celluloses and salts thereof, such as ethylcellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, methyl cellulose and carboxymethyl cellulose. Sodium salt of carboxymethyl cellulose is particularly preferred. Preferred suspending agents are CMC salts, particularly those having a degree of substitution of from 0.3 to 0.9, more preferably from 0.45 to 0.6. Preferred suspending agents have a Brookfield viscosity (test method defined below) no greater than 1500 cps, more preferably, the viscosity of the suspending agent is from 25 to 1000, more preferably from 25 to 500 cps.<br>
Brookfield Viscosity Measurement Method<br>
A 1% by weight solution of the compound to be tested is prepared with deionised water in a 600ml beaker by slowly adding the compound to be tested to the water at room temperature using a high speed, heavy-duty mixer to stir the solution (for example Stir-Pale Model 4554-20). Stir at about 2000-2300 rpm using a propeller style blade until the sample is substantially homogeneous. Then stir for a further 20 minutes. Place the sample beaker in an ultra-sonic bath for 15 minutes to remove the air bubbles after stirring. The sample is then equilibrated to 25°C for at least one hour in a water hath. Usine a Brookfield viscometer LVT series, selecting a #3 spindle and at<br><br>
30rpm, the spindle is immersed up to the middle of the indentation in the spindlle shaft. The spindle is allowed to rotate for 3 minutes before recording the reading. 3 successive readings are taken and the average determined.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, a suspending agent pre-cursor is present in the detergent composition. Such a suspending agent pre-cursor will react with one or more other components in the coloured particle on contact of the particle with the wash water, thus forming suspending agent for the hueing agent. One preferred suspending agent pre-cursor comprises multivalent metal ions. Suitable metal ions include any multivalent metal ions, for example Group II or Group III (of the Periodic Table) metal ions. Such metal ions may be provided in the coloured particle by incorporating any water soluble salt of the metal ion. Particularly preferred metal ions are calcium, magnesium and aluminium ions, with calcium ions being most preferred. When the suspending agent is provided in situ, in the wash water, the suspending agent pre-cursor must be present in the coloured particle in addition to a reactant for the pre-cursor which forms the suspending agent with the pre-cursor i.e. the pre-cursor must react with some other component of the coloured particle to produce the suspending agent, usually a gel, required for suspending the hueing agent. The reactant preferably has additional functionality in the particle, for example, preferably the reactant for the precursor is also a binder.<br>
In the case of multivalent metal ions, preferably the coloured particle also comprises a surfactant most preferably an anionic surfactant for reacting with the multivalent metal ion. Particularly preferred anionic surfactants comprise alkylbenzene sulphonates and alkyl sulphates or mixtures thereof.<br>
The suspending agent is typically present in the coloured particle in amounts from 3 to 80 wt%, generally in amounts from 5 to 70 wt%, or from 10 to 45 wt% based on the weight of the coloured particle. Suspending agent pre-cursor may be present in lower amounts such as from 0.5 to 10 wt% of the coloured particle, more usually from 0.5 to 5 wt% or even 1 to 3 % by weight.<br>
Multivalent metal ions<br>
Multivalent metal ions are particularly useful as a component in the coloured particles of the invention where the hueing agent is a negatively charged pigment. The inventors have found that a coloured particle comprising a hueing agent, binder and multivalentmetal ion (having a charge of 2+ or greater) where the hueing agent is negatively charged is extremely effective as it results in more efficient use of the pigment in the coloured particle by precipitating out the pigment,<br><br>
thereby enhancing deposition. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that this is because the hueing agent and metal ion form an insoluble precipitate which deposits efficaciously on a fabric surface so that most efficient use of the hueing agent is achieved. In the embodiment of the invention described above in which the suspending agent is provided in situ by combination of multivalent metal ion and surfactant binder, these two effects can be combined. However, where the coloured particles comprise a suspending agent, preferably a multivalent metal ion is also present to enhance deposition. Preferred negatively charged pigment for use in this embodiment of the invention is UltraMarine Blue.<br>
Other ingredients<br>
The colored particle may comprise other additional ingredients such as any material suitable for use in a detergent product, preferably a granular material. The material may be a complete detergent composition in itself, a usual ingredient in a detergent composition; and would include, but is not limited to builders, bleaches or bleach precursors, zeolites, buffers, chelants, hydratable salts and mixtures thereof, or could include any material not incompatible with the other ingredients or the purpose of a detergent product. Hydratable salts are most preferred as other ingredients, slowly hydrating hydratable salts being particularly preferred. Examples include salts with any conventional anion, preferably carbonates, phosphates, especially sodium tripolyphospahte, especially form II, aluminosilicates, chlorides, sulphates, acetates and citrate salts. Sodium salts of these hydratable salts may be preferred.<br>
However in accordance with a further preferred embodiments of the invention the hydratable salt may be a multivalent metal ion salt so that the hydratable salt may also provide the suspending agent precursor and/or the multivalent metal ions for enhancing deposition of any negatively charged hueing agent. Preferred examples of multivalent metal ion hydratable salts include calcium sulphate (plaster of paris), magnesium sulphate, magnesium carbonate, calcium chloride. Such components will be present to balance, but are generally present in amounts from 5 to below 90 wt%, more typically from 10 to below 80 wt%, more typically from 15 to below 75wt%. Typically, the colored particle will comprise the colored detergent ingredient, a carrier such as a hydratable salt, a binder and a suspending agent, optionally with a multivalent metal ion. The colored particle may further comprise an opaque pigment and/or a coating<br>
When multivalent metal ions are present in the coloured particles, and when the binder comprises anionic surfactant, in the making process, at the time of addition of the multivalent metal ions to the surfactant, preferably the total free water added in the processing and present in the<br><br>
ingredients mixed together to form the particle will be relatively low in order to minimize reaction between the surfactant and the multivalent metal ions. Preferably the total free water added and from raw materials will be below 10 wt%, preferably below 5 wt %, more preferably below 1 or even below 0.5 or 0.2 wt% based on the total weight of the particle. The acceptable levels of total free water added in the making process and via the raw materials will be dependent on the other ingredients in the particle as the total free moisture in the finished particle will be reduced by using hydratable salt. Preferably hydratable salt should be present in an amount that will substantially react with all of the free moisture in the particle. The free moisture in the coloured particles is preferably below 5 wt%, most preferably below 1 wt%, and more preferably below 0.5 or 0.2 wt%.<br>
Method for Making the Particles<br>
The colored particle may be prepared by any process wherein the colored ingredients, binder, suspending agent or precursor thereof and optionally further ingredients, are combined to form a mixture. The mixture may be in any form, such as a liquid, slurry, or a solid material, such as a granule, particulate or noodle. For example a particle comprising binder (liquid or in aqueous solution or suspension) and suspending agent may be prepared and then hueing agent is sprayed on. Alternatively, the hueing agent may be mixed with any crystalline components of the coloured particle and/or suspending agent, preferably in the presence of a binder. For example, the colored particle herein may be colored with a hueing agent, preferably a pigment and/dye and/or or a brightener by spraying the colorant onto solid component of the coloured particle in a fluid bed dryer/coater or into a mixing-container or mix drum, containing the colored particles and optionally drying the colored speckle particles, preferably in a fluidized-bed.<br>
The mixture may be formed into particulate materials, such as granules by for example an extrusion process, a fluid bed process, rotary atomization, agglomeration or a moulding process. Preferably, the granules are formed by an agglomeration and/or extrusion process. The agglomeration and also the extrusion processes, provide a simple, fast, efficient, cost-effective means of preparing a granule, noodle, needle or shaped form of particles.<br>
For the preparation of the mixture, any type of mixer may be used, especially a dynamic mixer. The mixing equipment will need to be selected to handle the relatively high viscosities that the<br><br>
mixture will reach. The exact viscosity will depend on the composition of the mixture and on the processing temperature. Preferably the processing temperature is below 120°C, preferably below 100°C, more preferably below 80°C, and most preferably between 15°C and 75°C.<br>
Preferred means are described in more detail below:<br>
Fine mixing and granulation including agglomeration<br>
Suitable pieces of equipment in which to carry out the fine mixing or granulation of the present invention are mixers of Fukae mixers such as the Fukae® FS-G Series manufactured by Fukae Powtech Kogyo Co. Japan. This apparatus is essentially in the form of a bowl-shaped vessel accessible via a top port, provided near its base with a stirrer having substantially vertical axis, and a cutter positioned on a side wall. The stirrer and cutter may be operated independently of one another and at separately variable speeds. The vessel can be fitted with a heating or cooling jacket.<br>

Patterson-Kelly V-Blender, ribbon mixers, Sigma, Z-blade, Forberg mixers may also be suitable. High shear mixers for example as outlined below may be preferred although medium or low shear mixing may be equally suitable, they may require a greater recycle of fines or oversize particles, increasing processing expense.<br>
Other preferred suitable equipment can include Eirich® Series R and RV, manufactured by Gustau Eirich Hardheirn, Germany; Lodige, Series FM for batch mixing or series CB and KM, either separately or in series for continues mixing/agglomeration, manufactured by L6dige Maschinenbau GmbH, Paderborn Germany; Drais® T 160 Series, manufactured by Drais Werke GmbH,Mannheim, Germany; and Winkworth® RT 25 series, manufactured by Winkworth Manchinery Ltd., Berkshire, England. The Littleford Mixer, Model #FM-130-D-12, with internal chopping blades and the Cuisinart Food Processor, Model #DCX-Plus, with 7.75 inch (19.7 cm) blades are two more examples of suitable mixers. Any other mixer with fine mixing and granulation capability and having a residence time in the order of 0.1 to 10 minutes can be used. The "turbine-type" impeller mixer, having several blades on an axis of rotation, is preferred. The<br><br>
