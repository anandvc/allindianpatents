A carrier comprising one or more di and/or mono-(electron transfer agent) phosphate<br>
derivatives or complexes thereof<br>
Field<br>
The invention relates to a carrier for use in<br>
administering biologically active compounds and<br>
formulations containing biologically active compounds and<br>
the carrier. The carrier assists in improving the<br>
efficacy, transport and delivery of the biologically<br>
active compounds, in particular Pharmaceuticals including<br>
cosmetic agents.<br>
Background<br>
In this specification where a document, act or item<br>
of knowledge is referred to or discussed, this reference<br>
or discussion is not an admission that the document, act<br>
or item of knowledge or any combination thereof was at the<br>
priority date, publicly available, known to the public,<br>
part of common general knowledge; or known to be relevant<br>
to an attempt to solve any problem with which this<br>
specification is concerned.<br>
The major objective in pharmaceutical delivery is to<br>
obtain an appropriate biological effect at a desired site<br>
of action. The choice of formulation can be critical to<br>
the efficacy of a pharmaceutical since the bioactivity of<br>
a pharmaceutical will be sub-optimal if it does not<br>
possess the correct physiochemical properties to allow<br>
release from the formulation at the target site of action.<br>
Enteral delivery involves administering the<br>
pharmaceutical via the GI tract where the pharmaceutical<br>
is absorbed and distributed via the bloodstream to the<br>
target site of action. For example, Pharmaceuticals<br>
delivered orally are absorbed through the intestine.<br>
The chemical environment of the GI tract is also<br>
important to external pharmaceutical delivery. The<br>
pharmaceutical must be in a form which is stable at the<br>
different pH of the various parts of the GI tract. If the<br>
pharmaceutical forms a non-absorbable complex or is<br>
degraded chemically or enzymatically then this will<br><br>
WO 2006/133506	PCT/AU2006/000839<br>
2<br>
decrease absorption. The pharmaceutical must also be in<br>
solution in the GI fluids to be absorbed. Sedimentation<br>
of the pharmaceutical involves the pharmaceutical forming<br>
solid particles and thus leaving the solution. Adsorption<br>
onto luminal solid particles involves solids adsorbing the<br>
pharmaceutical; that is, removing the pharmaceutical from<br>
solution. Both sedimentation and adsorption decrease<br>
absorption of the pharmaceutical. In many cases,<br>
degradation and complexation can be circumvented, or at<br>
least minimized, by chemical or formulation approaches so<br>
that they do not present a limitation to pharmaceutical<br>
uptake.<br>
Further, if a pharmaceutical is absorbed through the<br>
intestinal or stomach wall, it then must pass through the<br>
liver. The liver is designed to eliminate foreign<br>
compounds from the body. As a result, a significant<br>
proportion of the pharmaceutical (for example, 40-50%) may<br>
be metabolised and excreted before its reaches the<br>
bloodstream. It is possible to reduce the effect of the<br>
liver on enteral administration by having the<br>
pharmaceutical absorbed through the lining of the mouth<br>
(bucchal / sublingual) or the lining of the rectum<br>
(suppositories), however these routes are not always<br>
appropriate.<br>
Attempts to improve the bioavailability of enterally<br>
administered Pharmaceuticals involve either the formation<br>
of prodrugs, for example morphine sulphate or the use of<br>
excipients which improve absorption.<br>
Topical delivery involves administering the<br>
pharmaceutical to a membrane of the body where the<br>
pharmaceutical is absorbed and distributed. For example,<br>
Pharmaceuticals delivered transdermally are absorbed<br>
through the skin.<br>
The skin is the largest organ of the body, which<br>
functions to protect the internal organs from external<br>
chemical, physical and pathological hazards. Normal skin<br>
is divided into three layers: the epidermis, the dermis,<br><br>
WO 2006/133506	PCT/AU2006/000839<br>
3<br>
and subcutaneous tissue. The outer cornified layer of the<br>
epidermis, the stratum corneum, possesses properties of<br>
strength, flexibility, high electrical impedance and<br>
dryness that retards penetration and proliferation of<br>
micro-organisms. The stratum corneum is also the<br>
principle barrier to transdermal pharmaceutical<br>
absorption. There is a layer of sebum protecting the skin<br>
which is considered to be a barrier to all aqueous based<br>
pharmaceutical formulations.<br>
When travelling through the skin, a diffusing<br>
pharmaceutical molecule has three potential routes of<br>
entry to the deeper skin layers: the intercellular route,<br>
the transcellular route, and the transappendageal route.<br>
While shunt diffusion of electrolytes and large molecules<br>
through appendages may be significant, the relatively<br>
small area available for transport (0.1% of skin surface)<br>
means this route has a negligible contribution to steady<br>
state pharmaceutical flux. The main route for the<br>
permeation of the majority of molecules is commonly<br>
believed to be the intercellular route, and hence many<br>
enhancing techniques are aimed at disrupting the strong<br>
"brick and mortar" construction of the strata corneum.<br>
Current theories regarding the transport route point to<br>
two possible mechanisms: (i) passive transcellular and<br>
(ii) intracellular epidermal transport.<br>
Pharmaceuticals are topically applied to the skin in<br>
a number of ways including ointments, patches, solutions,<br>
subcutaneous depots, poultices, plasters and transdermal<br>
delivery devices.<br>
Interest in transdermal pharmaceutical delivery may<br>
be increasing but some fundamental limitations restrict<br>
broader application of the technology. The main<br>
limitation to the use of transdermal delivery is the rate<br>
of transport of the pharmaceutical through the skin.<br>
Not every pharmaceutical can be administered<br>
transdermally at a rate sufficiently high enough to<br>
achieve blood levels that are therapeutically beneficial<br><br>
WO 2006/133506	PCT/AU2006/000839<br>
4<br>
for systemic medication. Pharmaceuticals with similar<br>
molecular weights and sizes for example may absorb across<br>
the skin at different rates. Fentanyl for example<br>
permeates the skin at 2 mg/cm2/hr compared to ephedrine at<br>
200 mg/cm2/hr. The large size of a transdermal delivery<br>
system required for fentanyl would therefore be neither<br>
practical nor economical despite the advantages of the<br>
administration route.<br>
Skin enhancers and various formulation techniques<br>
have been developed to improve pharmaceutical absorption<br>
through the skin. Skin enhancers can include compounds<br>
like capric acid, oleic acid, azone, decylmethyl sulfoxide<br>
and hydroxy cinnamates that typically function to modify<br>
structure especially of the stratum corneum by dissolving<br>
the lipid matrix to improve permeability of<br>
Pharmaceuticals. Dermal absorption of progesterone for<br>
example increases by 143% when the stratum corneum is<br>
delipidized. The enhancement increases to 843% when the<br>
stratum corneum is totally eliminated. With such<br>
aggressive modification, commonly reported problems with<br>
repeated use of such systems are therefore evident,<br>
including contact dermatitis, reddening of the skin,<br>
itching and burning that requires movement of the patch,<br>
or application of the pharmaceutical, around the body to<br>
prevent local irritation. The reddening is said to<br>
disappear within hours of removing the patch. But concern<br>
has been raised with respect to long term risk and safety<br>
with use of this type of transdermal delivery systems,<br>
mainly because increased pharmaceutical permeability is<br>
achieved at the cost of damaging a fundamentally important<br>
protective layer of the skin.<br>
There is a need for formulations which further<br>
improve the bioavailability of biologically active<br>
compounds.<br><br>

Summary<br>
It has been found that the efficacy, transport and<br>
delivery of biologically active compounds can be increased<br>
if they are administered in a carrier comprising one or<br>
more C1-C4 alcohols, polyols and polymers thereof, water<br>
and one or more di- and/or mono-(electron transfer agent)<br>
phosphate derivatives or complexes thereof.<br>
According to a first aspect of the invention, there<br>
is provided a carrier for administering biologically<br>
active compounds comprising one or more C1-C4 alcohols,<br>
polyols and polymers thereof, water and one or more di-<br>
and/or mono-(electron transfer agent) phosphate<br>
derivatives or complexes thereof.<br>
The present invention also provides use of one or<br>
more C1-C4 alcohols, polyols and polymers thereof, water<br>
and one or more di- and/or mono-(electron transfer agent)<br>
phosphate derivatives or complexes thereof in the<br>
manufacture of a carrier for administering biologically<br>
active compounds.<br>
There is also provided a process for the preparation<br>
of the carrier defined above which comprises the steps of:<br>
(a)	combining one or more di- and/or mono-<br>
electron transfer agent) phosphate<br>
derivatives or complexes thereof with one<br>
or more C1-4 alcohols, polyols or polymers<br>
thereof; and<br>
(b)	adding water to the combination of step<br>
(a).<br>
It will be understood that the carrier may be<br>
prepared from or the reaction product of the alcohol,<br>
water and electron transfer agent phosphate derivatives or<br>
complexes thereof. Under these circumstances, the<br>
alcohol, water and electron transfer agent phosphate<br>
derivatives or complexes thereof may interact and be<br>
present in modified forms.<br>
Preferably, the C1-C4 alcohol is ethanol.<br><br>
WO 2006/133506	PCT/AU2006/000839<br>
6<br>
The carrier preferably contains one or more di-<br>
(electron transfer agent) phosphate derivatives or a<br>
combination of one or more di-(electron transfer agent)<br>
phosphate derivatives and one or more mono- (electron<br>
transfer agent) phosphate derivatives.<br>
It will be understood that the term "di- and/or mono-<br>
electron transfer agent) phosphate derivative" refers to<br>
phosphate esters of electron transfer agents in which the<br>
phosphate may be ortho-phosphate or pyro-phosphate di- or<br>
mono- substituted with electron transfer agents.<br>
In one embodiment, the di-(electron transfer agent)<br>
phosphate derivative is selected from the group consisting<br>
of di-tocopheryl phosphate derivatives, di-tocopheryl di-<br>
phosphate derivatives, di-tocotrienol phosphate<br>
derivatives and mixtures thereof. Preferably, the di-<br>
(electron transfer agent) phosphate derivative is di-<br>
tocopheryl phosphate.<br>
The mono-(electron transfer agent) phosphate<br>
derivative is preferably selected from the group<br>
consisting of mono-tocopheryl phosphate derivatives, mono-<br>
tocopheryl di-phosphate derivatives, mono-tocotrienyl<br>
phosphate and mixtures thereof.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, the formulation is<br>
prepared using at least one of di-tocopheryl phosphate,<br>
di-tocopheryl di-phosphate and di-tocotrienol phosphate.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the formulation is<br>
prepared using a combination of at least one of mono-<br>
tocopheryl phosphate, mono-tocopheryl di-phosphate and<br>
mono-tocotrienyl phosphate with at least one of di-<br>
tocopheryl phosphate, di-tocopheryl diphosphate and di-<br>
tocotrienyl phosphate.<br>
When the formulation contains a combination of mono-<br>
tocopheryl phosphate and di-tocopheryl phosphate, these<br>
compounds may be present in one or more of their alpha,<br>
beta, gamma and delta forms, preferably alpha and gamma<br>
forms.<br><br>
WO 2006/133506	PCT/AU2006/000839<br>
7<br>
The ratio of mono-tocopheryl phosphate to di-<br>
tocopheryl phosphate is preferably 4-.1 to 1:4, more<br>
preferably 2:1.<br>
The present invention further provides a formulation<br>
comprising a biologically active compound and a -carrier<br>
comprising one or more C1-C4 alcohols, polyols and polymers<br>
thereof, water and one or more di- and/or mono-(electron<br>
transfer agent) phosphate derivatives or complexes<br>
thereof.<br>
The present invention still further provides a method<br>
for preparing the formulation defined above comprising the<br>
step of combining a biologically active compound with a<br>
carrier comprising one or more C1-C4 alcohols, polyols and<br>
polymers thereof, water and one or more di- and/or mono-<br>
(electron transfer agent) phosphate derivatives or<br>
complexes thereof.<br>
Further according to the present invention there is<br>
provided a method for administering biologically active<br>
compounds which comprises the step of combining the<br>
biologically active compound with a carrier comprising one<br>
or more C1-C4 alcohols, polyols and polymers thereof, water<br>
and one or more di- and/or mono-(electron transfer agent)<br>
phosphate derivatives or complexes thereof.<br>
The carrier may be in the form of vesicles. The<br>
biologically active compound may be at least partially<br>
encapsulated by the vesicles. While not wishing to be<br>
bound by theory, it is believed that the formation of<br>
vesicles with controlled malleability enables the<br>
formulation to traverse intercellular pathways and deliver<br>
the biologically active compound intracellularly to target<br>
cells or into the systemic circulation. The di- and/or<br>
mono- (electron transfer agent) phosphate derivatives<br>
assist in countering any inflammation caused by<br>
administration of the formulation.<br>
Detailed description<br><br>
WO 2006/133506	PCT/AU2006/000839<br>
8<br>
The carrier of the present invention contains one or<br>
more C1-C4 alcohols, polyols and polymers thereof, water<br>
and one or more di- and/or mono-(electron transfer agent)<br>
phosphate derivatives or complexes thereof. Preferably,<br>
the amount of water present is in the range of 50 to 99%,<br>
more preferably 60 to 95%, most preferably 70 to 90%.<br>
The carrier is then combined with a biologically<br>
active compound to form a formulation.<br>
Alcohol<br>
The term "C1-C4 alcohol" refers to alcohols having 1<br>
to 4 carbon atoms such as C1-4 alkanols, for example,<br>
methanol, ethanol, propanol isopropanol or butanol.<br>
Polyols and polymers of C1-4 alcohols include glycols such<br>
as propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol, for example<br>
PEG400. Combinations of alcohols may also be used.<br>
Ethanol is preferred.<br>
The amount of C1-C4 alcohol present is preferably in<br>
the range of 0.5 to 50%, more preferably 5 to 4 0%, most<br>
preferably 10 to 30%.<br>
Electron transfer agent phosphate derivative<br>
The term "electron transfer agent" refers to an agent<br>
which may be phosphorylated and which (in the non-<br>
phosphorylated form) can accept an electron to generate a<br>
relatively stable molecular radical or accept two<br>
electrons to allow the agent to participate in a<br>
reversible redox system. Examples of electron transfer<br>
agents that may be phosphorylated include hydroxy chromans<br>
such as alpha, beta, gamma and delta tocols in<br>
enantiomeric and racemic forms; quinols being the reduced<br>
forms of electron transfer agent K1 and ubiquinone;<br>
hydroxy carotenoids such as retinol; calciferol and<br>
ascorbic acid. Preferably, the electron transfer agent is<br>
selected from the group consisting of tocols, retinol,<br>
quinols being the reduced form of electron transfer agent<br>
Kl and mixtures thereof.<br><br>
WO 2006/133506	PCT/AU2006/000839<br>
9<br>
More preferably, the electron transfer agent is a<br>
tocol such as tocopherol or tocotrienol. The tocols<br>
include all isomers of derivatives of 6:hydroxy 2:methyl<br>
chroman having the formula (I) below including the oc-5:7:8<br>
tri-methyl; β-5:8 di-methyl; γ-7:8 di-methyl; and δ 8<br>
methyl derivatives.<br><br>
in which<br>
R1, R2 and R3 are independently selected from the<br>
group consisting of hydrogen and C1-4 alkyl, preferably<br>
methyl.<br>
In the tocopherols, R4 is 4:8:12 tri-methyl tridecane<br>
and the 2, 4, and 8 positions (see *) may be stereoisomers<br>
with R or S activity or racemic. In the tocotrienols, R4<br>
is 4:8:12 tri-methyl trideca-3:7:11 triene and the 2<br>
position may be stereoisomers with R or S activity or<br>
racemic. Most preferably, the electron transfer agent is<br>
α-tocopherol or tocotrienol.<br>
The term "phosphate derivative" refers to the acid<br>
forms of phosphorylated electron transfer agents, salts of<br>
the phosphates including metal salts such as alkali or<br>
alkaline earth metal salts for example sodium, magnesium,<br>
potassium and calcium salts and any other derivative in<br>
which the phosphate proton is replaced by other<br>
substituents such as C1-C4 alkyl groups or phosphatidyl<br>
groups.<br><br>
WO 2006/133506	PCT/AU2006/000839<br>
10<br>
In some situations, it may be necessary to use a<br>
phosphate derivative such as a phosphatide. Phosphatidyl<br>
derivatives are amino alkyl derivatives of organic<br>
phosphates. These derivatives may be prepared from amines<br>
having a structure of R5RSN (CH2)nOH in which n is an integer<br>
of 1 to 6 and R5 and Re are independently selected from H<br>
and C1-4 alkyl. The phosphatidyl derivatives are prepared<br>
by displacing the hydroxyl proton of the electron transfer<br>
agent with a phosphate entity that is then reacted with an<br>
amine, such as ethanolamine or N,N' dimethylethanolamine.<br>
One method of preparing the phosphatidyl derivatives<br>
involves a basic solvent such as pyridine or triethylamine<br>
with phosphorous oxychloride to prepare an intermediate<br>
which is then reacted with the hydroxy group of the amine<br>
to produce the corresponding phosphatidyl derivative, such<br>
as P cholyl P tocopheryl dihydrogen phosphate.<br>
The term "C1-4 alkyl" refers to straight chain,<br>
branched chain or cyclic hydrocarbon groups having from 1<br>
to 4 carbon atoms. Examples include methyl, ethyl,<br>
propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl,<br>
cyclopropyl and cyclobutyl.<br>
Particularly preferred electron transfer agent<br>
phosphate derivatives are di-tocopheryl phosphate<br>
derivatives, di-tocopheryl di-phosphate derivatives, di-<br>
tocotrienol phosphate derivatives, mono-tocopheryl<br>
phosphate derivatives, mono-tocopheryl di-phosphate<br>
derivatives and mono-tocotrienyl phosphate derivatives,<br>
most preferably a combination of mono-tocopheryl phosphate<br>
derivatives and di-tocopheryl phosphate derivatives.<br>
It has been found that the stability of the carrier<br>
increases as the concentration of mono-electron transfer<br>
agent such as mono-α-tocopheryl phosphate increases. When<br>
a combination of mono-α-tocopheryl phosphate and di-<br>
tocopheryl phosphate is present they are preferably in a<br>
4:1 to 1:4 ratio, more preferably a 2:1 ratio.<br><br>
WO 2006/133506	PCT/AU2006/000839<br>
11<br>
The amount of electron transfer agent phosphate<br>
derivative present is preferably in the range of up to<br>
11%, more preferably 1 to 11%, most preferably 1 to 3%.<br>
Complex of electron transfer agent phosphate derivative<br>
Complexes of electron transfer agent phosphate<br>
derivatives may also be used when additional properties<br>
such as improved stability or deliverability are<br>
desirable. The complex is a reaction product of one or<br>
more electron transfer agent phosphate derivatives and one<br>
or more complexing agents selected from the group<br>
consisting of amphoteric surfactants, cationic<br>
surfactants, amino acids having nitrogen functional groups<br>
and proteins rich in these amino acids such as those<br>
disclosed in International Patent Publication No. WO<br>
02/4 0034, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The preferred complexing agents are selected from the<br>
group consisting of amino acids such as arginine and<br>
lysine and tertiary substituted amines such as those of<br>
formula (II) :<br>
NR7R8R9<br>
(II)<br>
in which<br>
R7 is selected from the group consisting of C6-22 alkyl<br>
optionally interupted by carbonyl; and<br>
R8 and R9 are independently selected from the group<br>
consisting of H, CH2C00X, CH2CHOHCH2SO3X, CH2CHOHCH2OPO3X,<br>
CH2CH2COOX, CH2COOX, CH2CH2CHOHCH2SO3X or CH2CH2CHOHCH2OPO3X<br>
in which X is H, Na, K or alkanolamine,<br>
provided that R8 and R9 are not both H and when R7 is<br>
RCO, then R8 NCH3 and R9 is (CH2CH2)N(C2H4OH) -H2CHOPO3 or R8<br>
and R9 together form N (CH2) 2N(C2H4OH) CH2COO.<br>
Preferred complexing agents include arginine, lysine<br>
or lauryliminodipropionic acid where complexation occurs<br>
between the alkaline nitrogen centre and the phosphoric<br>
acid ester to form a stable complex.<br><br>
WO 2006/133506	PCT/AU2006/000839<br>
12<br>
The term "C6-22 alkyl" refers to straight chain,<br>
branched chain or cyclic hydrocarbon groups having from 6<br>
to 22 carbon atoms, Examples include hexyl, cyclohexyl,<br>
decyl, dodecyl, tridecyl, tetradecyl, pentadecyl,<br>
hexadecyl, heptadecyl and octadecyl.<br>
Biologically active compound<br>
The term "biologically active compound" refers to<br>
compounds having a biological effect in humans or animals<br>
for medical, veterinary or cosmetic applications.<br>
Biologically active compounds include Pharmaceuticals or<br>
derivatives thereof, in particular phosphate derivatives<br>
thereof. Pharmaceuticals include vitamins,<br>

Types of administration<br>
The formulations include those suitable for<br>
parenteral, enteral, oral, topical, transdermal,<br>
opthalmological, rectal, vaginal, intranasal and<br>
intrapulmonary administration. The formulations may be in<br>
the form of liquids, solutions, suspensions, creams,<br>
ointments, lotions, gels, powders, aerosols, patches,<br>
enteric coated tablets, capsules, suppositories, pessaries<br>
or tampons and prepared by any methods well known in the<br>
art of pharmacy such as described in Remington JP. The<br>
Science and Practice of Pharmacy, ed. AR Gennaro, 20th<br><br>
WO 2006/133506	PCT/AU2006/000839<br>
20<br>
edition, Lippincott, Williams and Wilkins Baltimore, Md<br>
(2000) . These methods include the step of bringing into<br>
association the biologically active compound with the<br>
carrier, and then, if necessary, shaping the formulation<br>
into the desired product.<br>
The formulation may be administered parenterally by<br>
injection, infusion or implantation (intravenous,<br>
intramuscular, subcutaneous, or the like) in dosage forms,<br>
formulations, or via suitable delivery devices or implants<br>
containing conventional, non-toxic pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carriers and adjuvants.<br>
Formulations for parenteral use may be presented<br>
in unit dosage forms (e.g., in single dose-ampoules), or<br>
in vials containing several doses and in which a suitable<br>
preservative may be added. The formulation may be in form<br>
of a solution, a suspension, an emulsion, an infusion<br>
device, or a delivery device for implantation or it may be<br>
presented as a dry powder to be reconstituted with water<br>
or another suitable vehicle before use. Apart from the<br>
biologically active compound, the formulation may include<br>
suitable parenterally acceptable carriers and/or<br>
excipients. The biologically active compound may be<br>
incorporated into microspheres, microcapsules,<br>
nanoparticles, liposomes, or the like for controlled<br>
release. Furthermore, the formulation may include<br>
suspending, solubilizing, stabilizing, pH-adjusting<br>
agents, and/or dispersing agents.<br>
As indicated above, the formulations may be in the<br>
form suitable for sterile injection. To prepare such a<br>
formulation, the biologically active compound is dissolved<br>
or suspended in a parenterally acceptable liquid vehicle.<br>
Among acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be<br>
employed are water, water adjusted to a suitable pH by<br>
addition of an appropriate amount of hydrochloric acid,<br>
sodium hydroxide or a suitable buffer, 1,3-butanediol,<br>
Ringer's solution, and isotonic sodium chloride solution.<br>
The aqueous formulation may also contain one or more<br><br>
WO 2006/133506	PCT/AU2006/000839<br>
21<br>
preservatives (e.g., methyl, ethyl or n-propyl p-<br>
hydroxybenzoate). In cases where one of the compounds is<br>
only sparingly or slightly soluble in water, a dissolution<br>
enhancing or solubilizing agent can be added, or the<br>
solvent may include 10-60%w/w of propylene or glycol or<br>
the like.<br>
Controlled release parenteral compositions may be in<br>
form of aqueous suspensions, microspheres, microcapsules,<br>
magnetic microspheres, oil solutions, oil suspensions, or<br>
emulsions. Alternatively, the biologically active<br>
compound may be incorporated in biocompatible carriers,<br>
liposomes, nanoparticles, implants, or infusion devices.<br>
Materials for use in the preparation of microspheres<br>
and/or microcapsules are, e.g., biodegradable/bioerodible<br>
polymers such as polyglactin, poly-(isobutyl<br>
cyanoacrylate) , poly (2-hyroxyethyl-L-glutamnine) and<br>
poly(lactic acid).<br>
Biocompatible carriers that may be used when<br>
formulating a controlled release parenteral formulation<br>
are carbohydrates (e.g., dextrans), proteins (e.g.,<br>
albumin), lipoproteins, or antibodies.<br>
Materials for use in implants can be non-<br>
biodegradable (e.g., polydimethyl siloxane) or<br>
biodegradable (e.g., poly(caprolactone) , poly(lactic<br>
acid), poly(glycolic acid) or poly(ortho esters)).<br>
Formulations suitable for oral administration may<br>
conveniently be presented as discrete units such as<br>
capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a<br>
predetermined amount of the biologically active compound;<br>
as a powder or granules; as a solution, a suspension or as<br>
an emulsion. The biologically active compound may also be<br>
presented as a bolus, electuary or paste. Tablets and<br>
capsules for oral administration may contain conventional<br>
excipients such as binding agents, fillers, lubricants,<br>
disintegrants, or wetting agents. The tablets may be<br>
coated according to methods well known in the art. Oral<br>
liquid preparations may for example be in the form of<br><br>
WO 2006/133506	PCT/AU2006/000839<br>
22<br>
aqueous or oily suspensions, solutions, emulsions, syrups<br>
or elixirs, or may be presented as a dry product for<br>
constitution with water or other suitable vehicle before<br>
use. Such liquid preparations may contain conventional<br>
additives such as suspending agents, emulsifying agents,<br>
non-aqueous vehicles which may include edible oils, or<br>
preservatives.<br>
For topical administration transdermally, the<br>
biologically active compounds may be formulated as<br>
ointments, creams or lotions, or as a transdermal patch.<br>
Ointments and creams may, for example, be formulated with<br>
an aqueous or oily base with the additional of suitable<br>
thickening and/or gelling agents. Lotions may be<br>
formulated with an aqueous or oily base, and will in<br>
general also contain one or more emulsifying agents,<br>
stabilising agents, dispersing agents, suspending agents,<br>
thickening agents, or colouring agents.<br>
Formulations suitable for topical administration in<br>
the mouth include lozenges comprising active ingredient in<br>
a flavoured base, usually sucrose and gum acacia or gum<br>
tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active ingredient in<br>
an inert base such as gelatin or sucrose and gum acacia;<br>
and mouthwashes comprising the active ingredient in a<br>
suitable liquid carrier.<br>
Formulations suitable for rectal administration may<br>
be presented as suppositories. Suitable excipients<br>
include cocoa butter and other materials commonly used in<br>
the art, and the suppositories may be conveniently formed<br>
by admixture of the biologically active compound with the<br>
softened or melted carrier(s) followed by chilling and<br>
shaping moulds.<br>
Formulations suitable for vaginal administration may<br>
be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes,<br>
foams or sprays containing in addition to the biologically<br>
active compound such excipients as are known in the art to<br>
be appropriate.<br><br>
WO 2006/133506	PCT/AU2006/000839<br>
23<br>
For intranasal or intrapulmonary administration, the<br>
formulations may be administered in the form of a solution<br>
or a suspension or as a dry powder.<br>
Solutions and suspensions will generally be aqueous<br>
(for example sterile or pyrogen-free water) with a<br>
physiologically acceptable co-solvent (for example<br>
ethanol, propylene glycol or polyethylene glycols such as<br>
PEG 400).<br>
Such solutions or suspensions may additionally<br>
contain other excipients for example preservatives (such<br>
as benzalkonium chloride), solubilising agents or<br>
surfactants such as polysorbates (eg. Tween 80, Span 80,<br>
benzalkonium chloride), buffering agents, isotonicity-<br>
adjusting agents (for example sodium chloride) , absorption<br>
enhancers and viscosity enhancers. Suspensions may<br>
additionally contain suspending agents (for example<br>
microcrystalline cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose<br>
sodium).<br>
Solutions or suspensions may be applied directly to<br>
the nasal cavity by conventional means, for example with a<br>
dropper, pipette or spray. The formulations may be<br>
provided in a single or multidose form. The latter case<br>
means of dose metering is desirably provided. In the case<br>
of a dropper or pipette this may be achieved by<br>
administering an appropriate, predetermined volume of the<br>
solution or suspension. In the case of a spray this may<br>
be achieved for example by means of metering atomising<br>
spray pump.<br>
Administration to the respiratory tract may also be<br>
achieved by means of an aerosol formulation in which the<br>
biologically active compound is provided in a pressurised<br>
pack with a suitable propellant, such as chloroflurocarbon<br>
(CFC), for example dichlorodifluoromethane,<br>
trichlorofluoromethane or dichlorotetrafluoroethane,<br>
carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. The aerosol may<br>
conveniently also contain a surfactant such as lecithin.<br><br>
WO 2006/133506	PCT/AU2006/000839<br>
24<br>
The dose of pharmaceutical may be controlled by provision<br>
of metered valve.<br>
Alternatively the compounds may be provided in the<br>
form of a dry powder, for example a powder mix of the<br>
compound in a suitable powder base such as lactose,<br>
starch, starch derivatives such as hydroxypropylmethyl<br>
cellulose and polyvinylpyrrolidine (PVP). Conveniently<br>
the powder carrier will form a gel in the nasal cavity.<br>
The powder composition may be presented in unit dose form,<br>
for example in capsules or cartridges of eg. gelatin, or<br>
blister packs from which the powder may be administered by<br>
means of an inhaler such as Diskhaler (Trade Mark of<br>
GlaxoSmithKline) or meter dose aerosol inhaler.<br>
Other Excipients<br>
A person skilled in the art would know which other<br>
excipients could be included in the formulation. The<br>
choice of other excipients will depend on the<br>
characteristics of the biologically active compound and<br>
the form of administration used. Examples of other<br>
excipients include solvents, thickeners or gelling agents,<br>
surfactants, buffers, emollients, sweeteners,<br>
disintegrators, flavours, colours, preservatives,<br>
fragrances, electrolytes, film foaming polymers and the<br>
like. Suitable sweeteners include sucrose, lactose,<br>
glucose, aspartame or saccharin. Suitable disintegrators<br>
include corn starch, methylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidon,<br>
xanthan gum, bentonite, alginic acid or agar. Suitable<br>
flavours include peppermint oil, oil of wintergreen,<br>
cherry, orange or raspberry flavouring. Suitable<br>

propyl paraben and sodium benzoate and buffers such as<br>
sodium hydroxide. The excipients may be present in an<br>
amount up to about 5%.<br>
Process for Preparing the Carrier or Formulation<br>
The process for preparing the carrier involves<br>
combining the electron transfer agent phosphate<br>
derivatives or complexes thereof with the alcohol and then<br>
adding water. The formulation is then prepared by adding<br>
the biologically active compound to the carrier at any<br>
step of the process for preparing the carrier.<br>
Generally the alcohol is heated to temperatures of<br>
55°C or more and the electron transfer agent phosphate<br>
derivatives are dissolved in the alcohol. If the<br>
biologically active compound is soluble in the alcohol,<br>
then this is added when the electron transfer agent<br>
phosphate derivatives and alcohols are combined and the<br>
balance of the formulation is made up of water.<br>
The other excipients such as gelling agents,<br>
preservatives and buffers may be added during any step of<br>
the process, usually after addition of the water.<br>
The components of the carrier and formulation may be<br>
combined using any suitable known mixing technique, such<br>
as, for example, shaking or vortexing.<br>

Various embodiments/aspects of the invention will now<br>
be described with reference to the following non-limiting<br>
examples.<br>
Example 1<br>
This example investigates the transdermal uptake of<br>
human parathyroid hormone (fragment 1-34) (PTH) using a<br>
formulation according to the invention.<br>

The TPM-02/PTH formulation was a colloidal suspension<br>
which looked like milk. This indicated that vesicles had<br>
formed.<br>
Treatment<br>
Sprague-dawley rats (10-12 week old males) were<br>
randomly assigned to treatment groups (Groups 1 &amp; 2, n =<br><br>
WO 2006/133506	PCT/AU2006/000839<br>
27<br>
6) and housed in individual boxes to prevent their<br>
housemates from licking the formulation from their backs.<br>
Treatment groups:<br>
•	Group 1 - 100 mg of TPM-01/PTH / 200g body weight<br>
twice daily for 24 hours.<br>
•	Group 2 - 100 mg of TPM-02/PTH / 2 00g body weight<br>
twice daily for 24 hours.<br>
Rats were anaesthetized, weighed and a region of ~5 x<br>
4 cm immediately below the neck was shaved. Rats were<br>
tail bled while under anaesthesia and plasma collected to<br>
determine the level of PTH before the commencement of<br>
treatment. Beginning the following day, the appropriate<br>
dose of formulation for each rat was weighed out and<br>
massaged into the rat's skin using a gloved finger.<br>
Formulation was applied to Groups 1 and 2, twice daily<br>
(morning and evening) over 24 hours. At the completion of<br>
the treatment period, rats were killed by CO2 asphyxiation<br>
and bled by heart puncture.<br>
Analysis of PTH in plasma: Plasma was separated from<br>
the collected blood by centrifugation and stored at -20°C<br>
until analysis. Levels of PTH in rat plasma was analysed<br>
using the Human Bioactive PTH 1-34 ELISA Kit (Immunotopics<br>
Inc., USA) as per the manufacturer's instructions.<br>
Results<br>
Mean PTH levels detected in plasma are summarized in<br>
Figure 1.<br>
Twice daily application of TPM-01/PTH produced a<br>
significant (p
present within plasma after 24 hours. Mean plasma PTH<br>
levels were increased by 685 pg/ml relative to the basal<br>
level in the untreated rats. This increase in plasma<br>
represents 4.5% percent of the total dose.<br>
Twice daily application of TPM-02/PTH produced a<br>
significant (p
present within plasma after 24 hours. This increase (1185<br><br>
WO 2006/133506	PCT/AU2006/000839<br>
28<br>
pg/ml) represents 7.7% of the total dose, and a 70%<br>
improvement over the TPM-01/PTH formulation.<br>
*Results of student's t-test<br>
Transdermal treatment with TPM-02/PTH increased the<br>
levels of PTH in rat plasma indicating that the TPM was<br>
able to enable the absorption of PTH-(1-34) across the<br>
skin over 24 hours, significantly elevating circulating<br>
PTH plasma levels compared to untreated controls. 72<br>
hours after treatment, the plasma levels of PTH had<br>
returned to basal levels.<br>
Reported studies show that following subcutaneous<br>
injection of therapeutic amounts (25 μg/kg body weight),<br>
PTH levels in rat plasma peak -40-60 minutes after<br>
injection, and are completely turned over within 4 hours.<br>
Although applied topically, the rats in this study<br>
received a much larger dose (500 μg / kg body weight).<br>
Given the rapid rate of PTH turnover, it is reasonable to<br>
conclude that the high levels of PTH remaining 24 hours<br>
after the initial application represent only a small<br>
percentage of the total dose received. The effective dose<br>
produced by topical application of the TPM formulations<br>
would therefore be much larger than the levels of PTH<br>
measured after 24 hours.<br>
Conclusions<br>
Although both the TPM-01 and TPM-02 formulations were<br>
effective at delivering PTH, TPM-02/PTH delivered 70% more<br>
PTH to the circulatory system than TPM-01/PTH. The<br>
formulation according to the invention is more effective<br>
in delivering actives through skin and into the systemic<br>
circulation.<br>

1.	Weighed accurately 0.5 g of CoQ into a 50ml Falcon<br>
tube.<br>
2.	Weighed accurately 1 g of TPM into the same 5 0ml<br>
Falcon tube.<br>
3.	Weighed 10 g (not ml) ethanol into the tube. Capped<br>
tightly and mixed.<br>
4.	Heated in a 70°C water bath to help dissolve/melt the<br>
components. Snaked by hand every few minutes until both<br>
CoQ and TPM had dissolved. Left in heat until needed. At<br>
this concentration CoQ, precipitated out of the ethanol<br>
upon cooling.<br>
5.	Measured 80ml MilliQ into a 100ml specimen container.<br>
Capped tightly and placed in water bath for 5 minutes to<br>
warm the water.<br>
6.	Poured the heated CoQ/TPM/ethanol solution directly<br>
into the MilliQ.<br><br>
WO 2006/133506	PCT/AU2006/000839<br>
30<br>
7.	Capped immediately and shaked vigorously by hand to<br>
mix the components. The formulation had an opaque, yellow<br>
appearance. Vortex for 5 minutes.<br>
8.	Weighed accurately 1 g of Carbopol and 100 mg of<br>
methylparaben into a weigh boat. Added gradually to<br>
CoQ/TPM solution, with vigorous vortexing between each<br>
addition. Heated the sample in the 70°C water bath for<br>
short periods to help the samples to dissolve.<br>
9.	Once all carbopol/methylparaben had been added,<br>
vortexed until the components achieve an even consistency,<br>
although at this stage it had not formed a gel.<br>
10.	Added 3 ml 1M NaOH, cap and shake vigorously.<br>
11.	If the formulation had not formed a gel, checked the<br>
pH. Carbopol will form an optimal gel between pH 7-8.<br>
12.	Repeated steps 10 and 11 until a gel of the desired<br>
consistency was formed.<br>
13.	If necessary, made up to 100 g with MilliQ.<br>
14.	Vortexed for a further 5 minutes.<br>
15.	Wrapped container in foil to prevent photodegradation<br>
of CoQ.<br>
16.	By the next day, any remaining lumps of undissolved<br>
carbopol will have absorbed water from the formulation and<br>
formed clear pockets of gel. Shaked vigorously until the<br>
formulation assumed an even consistency.<br>
The formulation was a colloidal suspension which<br>
looked like milk. This indicated that the vesicles had<br>
formed.<br>

CoQ Control: The CoQ Control formulation was used to<br>
assess the amount of CoQ10 able to penetrate the skin in<br>
the absence of TPM. Contents: 0.5% CoQ10 (Kaneka, Japan),<br>
10% ethanol, 1% carbopol, 0.1% methylparaben, made up to<br>
100% with water.<br>
Weighed 0.5 g of CoQ10 into a 50ml Falcon tube.<br>
Added 10 g ethanol using the benchtop balance. Capped<br>
tightly and mixed. Heated in a 55°C water bath to help<br>
dissolve/melt the CoQ. Left in heat until needed. At<br>
this concentration CoQ precipitated out of the ethanol<br>
upon cooling. Measured 80 ml of water into a 100 ml<br>
specimen container. Poured the heated CoQ/ethanol<br>
solution directly into the water. Capped immediately and<br>
shaked vigorously by hand to mix the components. Vortexed<br>
for 5 minutes. Some CoQ10 came out of solution, forming<br>
an oily orange ring around the container. This cannot be<br>
avoided due to the insoluble nature of CoQ10. Weighed<br>
accurately 1 g of Carbopol and 100 mg of methylparaben<br>
into a weigh boat. Poured into formulation and vortexed<br>
until an even consistency was achieved, although at this<br>
stage it will not have formed a gel. Added 3 ml 1M NaOH,<br>
capped and shaked vigorously. If the formulation had not<br><br>
WO 2006/133506	PCT/AU2006/000839<br>
32<br>
formed a gel, checked the pH. Carbopol will form an<br>
optimal gel between pH 7-8. Repeated the addition of 3ml<br>
1M NaOH, snaked and checked pH until a gel formed. If<br>
necessary, make up to 100 g with MilliQ. Vortexed for a<br>
further 5 minutes. Wrapped container in foil to prevent<br>
photodegradation of CoQ. By the next day, any remaining<br>
lumps of undissolved carbopol will have absorbed water<br>
from the formulation and formed clear pockets of gel.<br>
Vortexed vigorously until the formulation assumed an even<br>
consistency.<br>
TPM Control: The TPM Control formulation was used to<br>
determine the effect of TPM on endogenous CoQ10 levels.<br>
Contents: 1% TPM, 10% ethanol, 1% carbopol, 0.1%<br>
methylparaben, made up to 100% with water. No CoQIO is<br>
present in this formulation.<br>
Weighed 1 g of TPM into a 50ml Falcon tube. Added 10<br>
g ethanol using the benchtop balance. Capped tightly and<br>
mixed. Heated in a 55°C water bath to help dissolve/melt<br>
the TPM. Left in heat until needed. Measured 8 0 ml of<br>
water into a 100 ml specimen container. Poured the heated<br>
TPM/ ethanol solution directly into the water. The<br>
formulation immediately gained a milky quality. Capped<br>
immediately and shaked vigorously by hand to mix the<br>
components. Vortexed for 5 minutes. Weighed accurately 1<br>
g of Carbopol and 100 mg of methylparaben into a weigh<br>
boat. Poured into formulation and vortexed until an even<br>
consistency was achieved, although at this stage it will<br>
not have formed a gel. Added 3 ml 1M NaOH, capped and<br>
shaked vigorously. If the formulation had not formed a<br>
gel, checked the pH. Carbopol will form an optimal gel<br>
between pH 7-8. Repeated the addition of 3ml 1M NaOH,<br>
shaked and checked pH until a gel formed. If necessary,<br>
made up to 100 g with water. Vortexed for a further 5<br>
minutes. Wrapped container in foil to prevent<br>
photodegradation of CoQ. By the next day, any remaining<br>
lumps of undissolved carbopol will have absorbed water<br>
from the formulation and formed clear pockets of gel.<br><br>

Treatment Groups<br>
Sprague-dawley rats (10-12 week old males) were<br>
purchased from Animal Services, Monash University and<br>
acclimatised to the Departmental Animal House for a<br>
minimum of 5 days before the treatments commenced. Animals<br>
were randomly assigned to treatment groups (n = 6), and<br>
housed in individual boxes to prevent their housemates<br>
from licking the formulation from their backs. Food<br>
(standard rat laboratory pellets; Barastoc, Australia) and<br>
water were provided freely.<br>

twice daily for 48 hours<br>
Rats were anaesthetized, weighed and a region of ~5 x<br>
4cm immediately below the neck was shaved. Beginning the<br>
following day, the appropriate amount of formulation for<br>
each rat was weighed out and massaged into the rat's skin<br>
twice daily (morning and evening) over 24, or 4 8 hours,<br>
using a gloved finger. The formulation was restricted to<br>
areas of the dorsal skin that the rat was unable to reach<br>
whi1e grooming.<br>
Analysis of CoQ10 in skin and plasma: At the<br>
completion of the treatment period rats were killed by<br>
asphyxiation using CO2 gas. Blood was removed by heart<br>
puncture into heparinised collection tubes, and<br>
centrifuged for separation of plasma. The area of shaved<br>
skin was washed thoroughly with distilled water to remove<br>
any unabsorbed CoQ10 remaining on the surface, and the<br>
area excised. CoQ extraction from tissues and<br>
quantitation by HPLC were performed essentially according<br>
to the method of Aberg et al., (1992) Distribution and redox<br>
state of ubiquinones in rat and human tissues. Arch Biochem<br>
Biophys 295: 230-234.<br>
Statistical Analysis: Results are expressed as mean<br>
+ SD. A Student's t-test was performed to determine<br>
whether there were significant differences in the levels<br>
of CoQ extracted from both the plasma and skin between the<br>
treatment groups.<br>

Plasma<br>
Twice daily application of TPM-02/CoQ to the dorsal<br>
region of rats produced a significant (p
the amount of CoQ10 present within plasma (Table I). Mean<br>
plasma CoQ10 levels were increased by 114% (p
treatment with TPM-02/CoQ relative to the endogenous CoQ10<br>
levels seen in the Untreated controls. In contrast, the<br>
CoQ and TPM Controls were only able to elevate mean plasma<br>
CoQ10 levels by 26% and 22% respectively. Neither of the<br>
latter two increases achieved statistical significance.<br>
Importantly, TPM-02/CoQ significantly (p
plasma CoQ10 levels by 70% relative to the CoQ Control<br>
formulation lacking TPM, evidence for the direct<br>
involvement of TPM with the ethanol in the transdermal<br>
uptake of CoQ10.<br>
Nivea Visage® increased plasma CoQ10 levels by 4 9%<br>
relative to the Untreated Controls after a single day's<br>
treatment. However, the amounts of plasma CoQ10 produced<br>
by Nivea Visage® were significantly less (44%; p
than those produced by treatment with TPM-02/CoQ.<br>
Skin<br>
Treatment with TPM-02/CoQ significantly (p
increased endogenous CoQ10 levels in skin by 2454% in the<br>
first 24 hours (Table I) . By 48 hours this increase had<br>
risen to 4312% of endogenous levels. In contrast, the CoQ<br>
and TPM controls elevated mean skin CoQ10 levels by 2 08%<br>
and 33% respectively in the first 24 hours, and 621% and<br><br>
WO 2006/133506	PCT/AU2006/000839<br>
36<br>
154% by 48 hours. While significant (p
magnitude of the increase following treatment with the TPM<br>
Control may seem to be of little interest. TPM-02/CoQ<br>
produced increases in mean skin CoQ10 relative to the CoQ<br>
Control of 728% and 512% after 24 and 48 hours<br>
respectively.<br>
Mean skin CoQ10 levels were significantly (p
increased (1513%) by TPM-02/CoQ after 24 hours compared to<br>
the Nivea Visage®, which failed to significantly elevate<br>
skin CoQ10 levels above those seen in the other control<br>
formulations.<br>
Conclusion<br>
The TPM/ethanol formulation enhanced the solubility<br>
and subsequent absorption of CoQ10 across the skin,<br>
significantly elevating plasma and skin CoQ10 levels<br>
compared to control formulations which include a<br>
commercially available cosmetic source of CoQ10.<br>
Formulating compounds with a TPM/ethanol formulation<br>
according to the invention has enormous potential for the<br>
topical application and absorption of molecules known to<br>
have poor oral bioavai lability, skin specificity or<br>
adverse side-effects that manifest during digestion.<br>
Example 4<br>
A formulation containing insulin was prepared as set<br>
out in the description above. The details of the<br>
formulation are as follows:<br><br>

insulin formulated with TPM.<br><br><br>
WO 2006/133506	PCT/AU2006/000839<br>
38<br>
Four separate experiments were conducted to<br>
independently demonstrate the transdermal delivery of<br>
insulin using TPM formulations after topical<br>
administration. TPM was formulated with either bovine<br>
insulin, a fast acting insulin analog (LISPRO), or a<br>
radiolabelled human recombinant insulin. Successful<br>
transdermal delivery was assessed by increases in plasma<br>
insulin levels, the detection of subcutaneous<br>
radioactivity or decreased blood glucose levels after a<br>
glucose load.<br>
Experiment 1: Increasing Plasma Insulin Levels<br>
The dorsal skin region of male Sprague Dawley rats<br>
(220-300g) was shaved under light anaesthesia (ether) the<br>
day before the experiment. While asleep, the rats were<br>
weighed in order to calculate the dose of nembutal and<br>
treatment formulation required for each rat. Rats were<br>
fasted overnight (~16h) with free access to water.<br>
Rats were anaesthetised the following morning and<br>
maintained under anaesthesia for the duration of the<br>
experiment. The test formulation contained 2% TPM, bovine<br>
insulin (3U/100μ1; Sigma) , ethanol (30%) and carbomer (1%)<br>
made up with water. Rats received a final insulin dose of<br>
10 U/kg of bodyweight. The control group received the<br>
same formulation containing TPM but without insulin.<br>
Control (n=2) and TPM-Insulin formulation (n=2) were<br>
topically applied and massaged into the skin with a gloved<br>
finger. Serum was collected 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 hours after<br>
administration.<br>
A competition radioactive immunoassay (Linco Research<br>
Inc.) specific for bovine insulin was used to measure the<br>
amount of insulin present in the serum samples.<br><br>

water.<br>
Human recombinant insulin containing a radiolabel<br>
(125I-Insulin, Amersham Biosciences) was formulated with 2%<br>
TPM, 30% ethanol, 1% carbomer and water to form a gel<br>
(TPM-125I-Insulin) . TPM-125I-Insulin was applied topically<br>
(as above) at a dose of ~400 nCi per rat (n=4) . Control<br>
rats (n=5) received a formulation without TPM, in order to<br>
address the role of TPM in transdermal absorption. Rats<br>
were housed individually after application with free<br>
access to food and water. After 5 hours, the rats were<br>
sacrificed and the organs removed, weighed and placed in<br>
scintillation vials to determine the total amount of<br>
radioactivity in each organ. The skin was washed to remove<br>
any unabsorbed I125-insulin remaining on the skin surface.<br>

Lilly), was formulated with 2% TPM, 30% ethanol, 1%<br>
carbomer and water to form a gel (TPM-LISPRO) . The<br>
treatment group (n=15) received a topical application of<br>
TPM-LISPRO (dose of 32.5U LISPRO / kg body weight) 30<br>
minutes prior to the glucose load to allow the LISPRO time<br><br>
WO 2006/133506	PCT/AU2006/000839<br>
40<br>
to enter systemic circulation. The control group (n=15)<br>
received a formulation without LISPRO. Glucose (3 0% w/v)<br>
was injected IP at a dose of 2g/kg body weight (2ml per<br>
300g rat).<br>
Rats were maintained under anaesthesia (nembutal)<br>
throughout the experiment, and blood glucose was measured<br>
from the tail using a Medisense Optium Blood Glucose<br>
Monitor (Abbott) . The blood glucose level was measured 5<br>
minutes after glucose load, and another 5 minutes later.<br>
Blood glucose was then measured every 10 minutes for ~2-<br>
2.5 hours. The blood glucose levels measured immediately<br>
before glucose load were subtracted from all subsequent<br>
values to determine the change in blood glucose for each<br>
rat during the experiment. The average change in blood<br>
glucose was calculated for each time point and plotted<br>
(Figure 3). As non-diabetic rats were used in this study,<br>
the efficacy of TPM-LISPRO was judged as a reduction in<br>
peak blood glucose relative to control animals.<br>
The area under the curve was calculated for<br>
individual rats and the population groups were compared<br>
using the Student's t-test.<br>
Experiment 4: Lowing Blood Glucose Using Transdermal<br>
Insulin<br>
Eight pigs with two surgically prepared catheters<br>
were prepared at least 5 days before the study. Pigs were<br>
trained to consume their feed at approximately 3:00 pm in<br>
the afternoon so that they were acclimatised to an<br>
overnight fast. The experimental design was a single<br>
reversal with the two treatments being the TPM-02 gel<br>
containing insulin or the TPM-02 gel without insulin.<br>
Intravenous (IV) infusions were separated by at least 1<br>
day. On the day of an infusion pigs were bled every 15<br><br>
WO 2006/133506	PCT/AU2006/000839<br>
41<br>
min for 1 hour to obtain basal blood glucose<br>
concentrations before application of the gels. After 30<br>
min an infusion of glucose (0.33 g/kg per h) and xylazine<br>
(0.033 mg/kg per h) was commenced and blood sampling<br>
continued for another 3 h. Blood was immediately analysed<br>
for glucose using a Glucometer. During the course of the<br>
study the catheters in one pig lost patency and so only 7<br>
pigs entered the study. Also, on one bleed day (insulin<br>
treatment) the sampling catheter in one pig lost patency<br>
during the infusion. Therefore, the number of bleed days<br>
for the control and insulin treated pigs was 7 and 6,<br>
respectively.<br>
Blood glucose data was analysed using REML with the<br>
fixed effects including treatment (control or insulin) and<br>
time of blood sampling while the random model included pig<br>
and bleed day. In addition, blood glucose were averaged<br>
over the pre-treatment period and over both the last 2 and<br>
4 samples. These data were also analysed using REML with<br>
the fixed effects being bleed time (either before or after<br>
application of gel and infusion) while the random model<br>
included pig and bleed day. For these latter analyses the<br>
data were subject to log-transformation.<br>
Results and Discussion<br>
Pilot Experiment 1: Increasing Plasma Insulin Levels<br>
In a trial experiment, topical application of TPM-<br>
insulin was able to increase the blood sera levels of<br>
insulin (Figure 3). In both treated animals the increase<br>
in sera insulin levels peaked 4 hours after treatment.<br>
Insulin levels in control animals declined over this<br>
period or failed to reach similar levels as the treated<br>
animals. The small number of animals used in this pilot<br>
experiment means that statistical evaluation is not<br><br>
WO 2006/133506	PCT/AU2006/000839<br>
42<br>
possible; however a positive trend for successful<br>
transdermal absorption is apparent, warranting further<br>
examination in larger experiments.<br>
Experiment 2; Detecting Transdermal Absorption of Insulin<br>
Using Radioactive Probes<br>
Having obtained positive evidence of increased sera<br>
insulin levels in a trial experiment, we sought to<br>
conclusively demonstrate the transdermal absorption of<br>
insulin formulated with TPM. To do this, we formulated<br>
TPM with a radiolabelled form of insulin, with the aim of<br>
using its radioactive decay to monitor the transdermal<br>
absorption of "hot" insulin and subsequent distribution<br>
(if any) throughout the rat. Results show that TPM was<br>
able to successfully drive the transdermal absorption of<br>
125I -insulin (Figure 2) . Levels of radioactivity detected<br>
within the skin at the site of application were<br>
significantly elevated (p
animals. As the skin surface of each rat was washed, this<br>
radioactivity is present within the deeper skin layers.<br>
Importantly, subcutaneous fat directly below the area of<br>
application contained significantly (p
levels of radioactivity compared to controls, conclusively<br>
demonstrating the ability of TPM to drive the absorption<br>
of insulin across the skin to the underlying tissue.<br>
Example 3: Lowering Blood Glucose Using Transdermal<br>
Insulin.<br>
Having demonstrated the successful transdermal<br>
absorption of insulin when formulated with TPM, we sought<br>
to examine whether the delivered molecule could<br>
effectively enter systemic circulation to lower blood<br>
glucose. Pasted rats were subjected to a glucose<br><br>
WO 2006/133506	PCT/AU2006/000839<br>
43<br>
tolerance test 3 0 minutes after topical application of<br>
TPM-LISPRO, and blood glucose measured at subsequent<br>
intervals (Figure 4). Blood glucose levels were<br>
significantly (p
TPM-LISPRO compared to controls, demonstrating both the<br>
transdermal delivery, and subsequent activity of the<br>
transported LISPRO. TPM is therefore able to transport<br>
large, active molecules such as insulin across the skin.<br>
Experiment 4: Lowering Blood Glucose Using Transdermal<br>
Insulin<br>
This study expanded on the rat study in which glucose<br>
tolerance tests showed that the transdermal insulin<br>
formulation penetrates the skin and is bioavailable.<br>
This was assessed in pigs with an IV glucose tolerance<br>
test using TPM-02/Insulin.<br>
Methods were refined by replacing the initial oral<br>
glucose tests that did not work as anticipated, with an IV<br>
dosing of glucose. In addition, xylazine (a chemical that<br>
inhibits insulin being released in pancreas) was co-<br>
infused with glucose.<br>
The overall statistical effect of TPM-02/Insulin was<br>
highly significant (p
appeared to be over the latter part of the infusion when<br>
blood glucose had reached plateau. At plateau, the<br>
increase in blood glucose was significantly lower in the<br>
pigs receiving the transdermal insulin preparation which<br>
represents a marked improvement in control of glycemia.<br>
The data indicate that insulin was absorbed transdermally.<br>
The simultaneous infusion of glucose and an inhibitor<br>
of insulin secretion such as xylazine appears to be a good<br>
model system to measure transdermal delivery of insulin.<br>
Further work should extend the use of the current model to<br><br>
WO 2006/133506	PCT/AU2006/000839<br>
44<br>
look at the effect of transdermal delivery during a more<br>
abrupt increase in blood glucose, and should extend the<br>
study time to determine for how long the delivery could be<br>
sustained. Further studies could also be conducted on a<br>
model system suitable for the target (ie. the diabetic<br>
human) such as the streptozotocin diabetic pig. That is,<br>
pigs that have been treated with the chemical<br>
streptozotocin, which destroys the insulin-secreting cells<br>
of the pancreas rendering the pig diabetic.<br>
Conclusions:<br>
The results presented demonstrate that mixed<br>
tocopheryl phosphates (TPM) can successfully drive the<br>
transdermal absorption of large molecules such as insulin.<br>
Increased insulin levels were demonstrated within the<br>
dermis at the site of application, the subcutaneous fat<br>
below and within the blood. Importantly, glucose<br>
tolerance tests indicate that the delivered molecule is<br>
active and able to effectively lower blood glucose. This<br>
is a positive finding for diabetics, offering hope that a<br>
non-invasive insulin delivery method may become available<br>
to alleviate the discomfort of daily injections.<br>
It is proposed to conduct experiments using vertical<br>
diffusion (Franz) cells, with skin from pig and human, to<br>
test the flux rates and permeability of multiple variants<br>
of the formulation. This technique will allow faster<br>
optimisation of the TPM-insulin formulation.<br>

Example 7<br>
TPM vesicles containing a mixture of the<br>
monophosphate ester of α-tocopheryl (TP) and di-tocopheryl<br>
phosphate (T2P) in a 2: ratio were exposed to simulated<br>
gastric and intestinal juices so as to determine whether<br>
enteric formulations of the present invention could<br>
withstand the conditions of the gut.<br>
Vesicles were prepared with 2% TPM including the<br>
fluorescent dye Rhodamine 6G, and an analysis of the<br>
distribution of the vesicle population was done with<br>
fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS).<br>
Simulated gastric and intestinal juices were prepared<br>
according to the US Pharmacopoeia. Gastric juice was an<br>
acidic solution of pepsin enzyme, at pH 1.2. Intestinal<br>
juice was prepared with pancreatin powder made up<br>
in a phosphate buffer at pH 6.8.<br>
The vesicles were exposed to both juices separately.<br>
Exposure to the simulated gastric juice created larger<br>
vesicles and/or aggregates of vesicles. Exposure to the<br>
simulated intestinal juice had almost no effect on the<br>
appearance of the vesicles, and they maintained the<br>
original size distribution.<br><br>
