				<td>The present invention relates to an apparatus and method for controlling adaptive circuits<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to adaptive circuits. More specifically, the present invention relates to an apparatus and method for controlling adaptive circuits, such as controlling gain and phase adjustments in a feed forward amplifier circuit. <br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Adaptive circuits are well known and used in a variety of applications. One well-known example of an adaptive circuit is the feed forward amplifier ("FFA"). In order to achieve linearity in a feed forward amplifier, careful control of the amplifier circuitry is required. In particular, in FFAs two or more gain and phase adjusters are often employed and the taps of each of these adjusters are carefully steered to achieve linearity through the amplifier.<br>
Within the art of FFAs, it is known to use detector-controller circuits, one for each gain-and-phase adjuster. Each detector-controller circuit is operable to steer the taps of its respective gain-and-phase adjuster in the FFA so that the main amplifier and correctional amplifier can properly cooperate in order to reduce error introduced by the main amplifier and, should a pilot tone be used in the FFA, to also reduce the output residue of the pilot tone injected prior to the main amplifier.<br>
In certain prior art detector-controller circuits, once the detector portion of the detector-controller circuit has indicated that the associated controller portion should make an adjustment, the controller arbitrarily steers the taps of the gain-and-phase adjuster in a direction to either increase or decrease the input to the tap, without knowing which of an increase or decrease will actually achieve the desired effect. In order to verify whether the controller steered the tap in the correct direction (e.g., to increase the signal to the tap), after the correction has been applied the detector circuit ascertains whether the direction of the variation brought about the desired effect, and, if so, instructs the controller circuit to continue steering in the same direction, if necessary. If, however, the detector circuit ascertains that the steering direction brought about an undesired result, then the detector instructs to the controller to try steering the tap in the opposite direction<br>
(e.g., to decrease the signal to the tap).<br>
In flic prior art, each detector-controller circuit works independently of each other, and therefore, achieving convergence towards m optimum level for each tap of each adjuster can be difficult For example, rapid changes is the strength of the input signal being amplified by the 5     FFA can make it difficult for the detector-controller circuits to respond quickly enough to converge the tap levels of each gain-and-phase adjuster towards the respective optimum levels. Furthermore, the adjustment of one tap of a gain-and-phase adjuster can disrupt an optimum or near optimum input level achieved at another tap, therefore cascading disruptions through all of the taps.<br>
	The inventor of the present invention also believes that a further problem is that such<br>
prior art controller circuits can sometimes result in taps being steered to levels that are levels corresponding to local minima for the input signal, missing a global optimum for the input signal.<br>
SUMMARY OF TOE INVENTION<br>
	It is an object of the present invention to provide a novel apparatus and method for<br>
controlling an adaptive circuit mat obviates or mitigates at least one of the above-identified disadvantages of the prior art It is a further object of the present invention to provide a novel feed forward amplifier mat obviates or mitigates at least one of the above-identified disadvantages of the prior art.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Referring now to Figure 1, a forward feed amplifier ("FFA") in accordance with an 20     embodiment ofthe invention is indicated generally at 20. FFA 20 comprises an amplifier<br>
portion 24 and a detector-controller portion 28.  Amplifier portion 24 includes a coupler 36 mat is connected to an input signal path 40. Coupler 36 is operable to split an incoming signal from path 40 into a main amplifier signal path 44 and a correctional amplifier signal path 48.<br>
Main amplifier signal path 44, which carries the main signal from coupler 36, includes a 25     gain and phase adjuster GPAi, amain amplifier 56 and a delay element 60 that outputs to an output signal path 6*4. GPAi includes a gain control input tap Ti, and a phase control input tap T2, each of which can be steered so mat GPAi operates to yield maximum signal cancellation at the output of coupler 82 and the input of coupler 104, as discussed below. The location in the circuit at which maximum signal cancellation is to occur is sometimes referred to as the 30     "cancellation node".<br>
Correctional amplifier signal path 48 which carries a sample, generated by coupler 36, of the signal from input signal path 40 includes a delay element 68, a gain and phase adjuster GPA2<br><br>
and a correctional amplifier 74, the output of which connects to output signal path 64 via a coupler 76. GPA2 includes a gain control input tap T3, and a phase control input tap T4} each of which can be steered so that GPAa is adjusted to require a minimum, or near minimum, amount of power to be delivered to me correctional amplifier 74. As used herein, the terms "steer",     "steered" and "steering" are intended to comprise all suitable methods of adjusting and/or controlling of the taps respective to a gain and phase or other suitable adjuster. In the embodiment of the invention discussed below, taps T1, T2, T3, and T4, are steered by changing the voltage levels applied to each of them respectively.<br>
As will be apparent to those of skill in the art, GPA2 and correctional amplifier 74 form 10     an error pathway 73 within amplifier portion 24. Accordingly, when the output of correctional amplifier 74 is coupled to the output of delay 60, errors and pilot tones, if used, are substantially eliminated from the output signal path 64, such that the output signal path 64 presents a substantially linear amplification of the signal from input signal path 40.<br>
Amplifier portion 24 is further characterized by a coupled path 79 mat interconnects a 15     first coupler 80, which is connected to the output of main amplifier 56, and a second coupler 82, which is connected to the output of delay element 68, in order to provide a sample of the error introduced by main amplifier 56" to the error pathway 73, commencing at GPA2. Attenuation may be provided in coupled path 73, if not already provided by the first coupler 80.<br>
The main amplifier signal path 44, the correctional amplifier signal path 48, and the 20     coupled path 79 together are sometimes referred to as a "signal cancellation loop".<br>
In the illustrated embodiment, amplifier portion 24 further includes a pilot tone generator 86 that is coupled, via a coupler 90, to the input of main amplifier 56. Pilot tone generator 86 generates a pilot tone for use by error pathway 73 in the usual manner for reducing error introduced by main amplifier 56. By the same token, amplifier portion 24 further includes a 25     pilot tone receiver 94 that is coupled, via a coupler 98, to output signal path 64. Pilot tone<br>
receiver 94 is operable to measure any remaining pilot tone present along output signal path 64 for eventual use by error pathway 73 to introduce a signal at coupler 76 that will reduce the pilot tone in output signal path 64.<br>
Detector-controller portion 28 connects to amplifier portion 24 through various inputs 30     and various outputs, as described herein. Specifically, a coupler 104 connected just prior to error pathway 73 delivers an input signal to a first detector Dx, which in turn presents a detector-outoat to a gain controller Ci and a phase controller C2.  hi the illustrated embodiment, the<br><br>
detector-output is a measure of the amplitude of the envelope of the input signal applied to it. However, it is within the scope of the invention to provide as a detector-output a signal proportional to the log of the IMS value of the envelope of the input signal or proportional to peaks of the envelope of the input signal, as well as any other measure or signal that will occur 5     to those skilled in the art Wherever in the following or in the claims that reference is made to the detector-output being the amplitude of the envelope of the input signal applied to it, it should be understood that such other signals or measures are also intended.<br>
Similarly, pilot tone receiver 94 delivers an output signal to a second detector D2, which in turn presents a detector-output to a gain controller C3 and a phase controller C4. Again, 10     detector D2 outputs the amplitude ofthe envelope ofthe input signal applied to it. As will be discussed in greater detail below, controllers Q, C2, C3 and Q are operable to steer taps Ti, T2, T3 and T4, respectively, based on the signals received from their respective detectors D, in order to find optimum (or otherwise desired) pin and phase adjustments for each of adjusters GPAi and GPA2.<br>
15	In the illustrated embodiment, tracer signals are applied to each of main amplifier signal<br>
path 44 and correctional amplifier signal path 48 by using them to modulate the voltage levels applied to the taps Ti, T2, T3, and T4, respectively. Those voltage levels are also referred to as tap steering signals and the modulated voltage levels as modulated tap steering signals. Each tracer signal, because it rapidly but slightly changes either the gain or the phase m the signal<br>
20     cancellation loop, causes variations in the amplitude ofthe envelope ofthe input signal applied to one ofthe detectors D| and D2. The detected amplitudes ofthe envelopes ofthe signals applied to the detectors Dj and D2 are passed to the respective controllers C. Each controller C extracts the variation in the detector output caused by the tracer signal applied to the corresponding tap and steers the tap accordingly. The variations in the detector outputs caused<br>
25     by the tracer signals «m be separated from each other because each tracer signal is selected to be orthogonal to each other tracer signal As described below, to achieve orthogonality in the illustrated embodiment each tracer signal is a Walsh code, but other techniques, such as selecting appropriate pseudo noise sequences as the tracer signals will be apparent to those of skill in the art As will become apparent to those of skill in the art from the discussion herein,<br>
30     the present invention will operate wifli tracer signals tot are not totally orthogonal to each other, although better performance will be obtained when using signals as orthogonal as possible. Accordingly, as used herein, the term orthogonal is intended to include both perfectly orthogonal<br><br>
signals, such as Walsh codes, and near-orthogonal signals, for example pseudo noise sequences taken over a time period that provides approximately orthogonal results. The general criterion is that the mere uncorrelated tracer signals are over an appropriate time period the better the results.<br>
5	Before going into the details, as an overview, consider an idealized situation that may<br>
help in understanding the embodiment of the invention described herein. To aid in understanding, we assume that the main amplifier does not distort the input signal at all and we start with adjusting only one tap steering signal. We begin by setting a tap steering signal at a particular voltage level. If that voltage level is applied to a tap of an adjuster, a particular level<br>
10     of signal cancellation at the cancellation node results. If the voltage level is optimal (so that the amplitude of envelope of the signal at the cancellation node is zero), dithering of the voltage level by a tracer signal that has an avenge value of zero (as do orthogonal and pseudo noise sequences over appropriate periods) wit result in slight excursions in the amplitude of envelope of the signal at the cancellation node above and below zero, but the sum of all the excursions<br>
15     will be zero. Now suppose mat the voltage level is not optimal. Then the slight excursions in the amplitude of the envelope of the signal at the cancellation node will be to levels above and below the amplitude of envelope of the signal at the cancellation node that would occur if no dither were applied. The result will be a non-zero sum with a polarity, or sign, the same as the polarity of the amplitude of the envelope of the signal at the cancellation node would be if no<br>
20     dither were applied. So far we have assumed that there is only one tap. If there are more taps, thenby using orthogonal or pseudo noise sequences over appropriate periods as tracer signals, the excursions in the amplitude of envelope of the signal at the cancellation node caused by dithering of each tap can be extracted separately from the amplitude of envelope of the signal at the cancellation node, summed, and used to adjust the corresponding tap steering signals<br>
25     simultaneously.<br>
Referring now to Figure 2, detector-controller portion 28 will now be discussed m greater detail. As shown, controllers d, Cz, C3 and C4 each include the same components. Each controller C includes a multiplier 200 fiiat receives a detector-output ftom a respective detector D. Controllers C are operable to utilize fte detector-output to determine how to steer their<br>
30     respective tap T. In the present embodiment, each detector-ou^wt is the amplitude of the envelope of the signal received by a respective detector D and carries combined information about the effects of dithering (modulating) the respective tap steering signals with the respective<br><br>
tracer signals on me amplitude of the envelope of the signal received by the respective detector D. The information carried about the effect of the dithering of each tap steering signal with a tracer signal may be separately extracted from the detector-o»$&gt;ut in the manner discussed in greater detail further below.<br>
5	To extract &amp;e effect of the tracer signal injected by tap T for the controller C, each<br>
multiplier 200 receives its Walsh code from a Walsh code generator 204. Each Walsh code generator 204j, 2042,2043 and 2044, generates a unique Walsh code, which, as is understood by those of skill in the art, is a preselected pattern of one or more logical ones and/or logical zeroes that repeat over a given period and is orthogonal to each other Walsh code. As will be 10     discussed in greater detail below, when the detector-output from a respective detector D is multiplied by multiplier 200 with a respective Walsh code, only the portion of the detector-output resulting from the tracer signal injected at the respective tap T will be output from the respective multiplier 200.<br>
Controllers C also each include an integrator 208 which is operable to sum the results<br>
15     from multiplier 200, which represent the effect of tracer signal for the respective tap T on the<br>
respective detector-output, for each penoi and output those summed results to an adjuster 212<br>
which is operable to determine from the summed result whether the tap T it is responsible for is<br>
properly steered. If an adjuster 212 determines that its corresponding tap T was steered in the<br>
proper direction, then adjuster 212 outputs a signal mat continues to steer that tap T in the same<br>
20     direction. If adjuster 212 determines that its corresponding tap T was steered in the wrong<br>
direction, then adjuster 212 outputs a signal that steers that tap T in the opposite direction.<br>
Adjuster 212 can also determine that the tap T is at an optimum level, in which case adjuster 212<br>
does not steer tap T at all, but leaves the tap steering signal at the existing level.  Further details<br>
of adjuster 212 will be discussed in greater detail below.<br>
25	To inject the tracer signal for a controller C into amplifier portion 24, the signal<br>
outputted from adjuster 212 is modulated, using a summer 216, with the Walsh code generated at Walsh code generator 204, the Walsh code having first been attenuated through an attenuator 220 by a factor A. The Walsh code is attenuated, by fetor A, to a level that provides a suitable "dither" or '^perturbance" that can be summed with the control signal from adjuster 212 for the 30     respective tap T. The voltage level of the resulting modulated signal is at a level that will generally yield a niiniiHuni reliably detectable signal at the output of detector D.<br>
As will be apparent to those of still in me art, in order for the Walsh code to behave as a<br><br>
good dither, each Walsh code for each controller C is selected to have as many transitions as possible, while still bemg orthogonal to fee Walsh codes of the other controllers C. Also, as the tracer signal is averaged over a suitable period of time to reduce the effects of noise in the detected signal, it is desired to choose a Walsh code, or other orthogonal signal, with a suitably long length. It is presently preferred that a length for the Walsh codes is selected which is at least twice the number taps T to be controlled, i.e. — in the embodiment of Figure 1, the shortest desired length of Walsh codes would be an eight chip code and, in feet, it is presently preferred to use a Walsh code length of sixty-four chips for a feed forward amplifier with four taps T.<br>
The output of each summer 216 is then presented to its respective tap T, thereby steering each respective tap T accordingly and injecting the respective tracer signal.<br>
A method of controlling the gain and phase adjustment of feed forward amplifier 20 will now be discussed with reference to Figure 3. The flow-chart in Figure 3 shows a sequence of steps which can be used to operate, for example, each controller C of detector-controller portion 28, thereby steering each tap T.  In other words, fee sequence of steps in Figure 3 will be performed, in parallel, for each controller C.<br>
Although, as mentioned above, in a presently preferred embodiment each Walsh code is actually sixty-four chips in length, for simplicity while explaining fee method, it will be assumed feat each Walsh code Wt, W2, W3 and W4, is only eight chips in length.   Each Walsh code W,, W2, W3 asd W4 is generated by a respective Walsh code generators 204i, 2042,2043 and 2044 and is shown in Table I and illustrated in fee pulse-waveforms shown in Figure 4. From fee waveforms shown therein, it is to be understood feat a "1" means a logical "1", and "-1" means a logical "0".<br>
Table I<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Again for simplicity, fee method of Figure 3 will only be discussed in detail wife reference to controllers d and C2 and feek associated detector Dt. The method begins at step<br><br>
300 where a signal is detected at detector Di from the amplifier portion 24 of feed forward amplifier 20. To illustrate how this step can be accomplished according to a present embodiment, it will be assumed that feed forward amplifier 20 has just been activated (i.e. initialized), but that so input signal is present along input signal path 40, and accordingly no 5     output signal is present along output signal path 64.<br>
The activity in feed forward amplifier 20 at this point in the method is illustrated in Figure 5, where detector Dj, controlter Ci and conlmllar C2 are shown. As there is no input signal along input signal path 40, detector Di detects this and outputs a corresponding waveform, which is represented in Figure 5 as a detector-output waveform 400a, which in turn is 10     inputted into multiplier 200i and multiplier 2OQ2.<br>
By way of further background tofhe operation of the present embodiment, it will be apparent to those of skill in the art that the tracer signal being applied to the taps T of gain and phase adjuster GPAi, whether a Walsh code or any other dither, will only be detectable at detector D] where there is an input signal along input signal path 40 as the tracer signal is a 15     modulation of the input signal. Similarly, ifapilot tone is being injected at coupler 90, then the tracer signal applied at the tips T of GP A2 will be detectable at detector D?. as modulation of the pilot tone detected at detector D2.  As there is as yet no input signal in Figure 5, detector-output waveform 400a is all zeros, as shown.<br>
Referring again to Figure 3, the method then advances to step 320 where the tracer signal 20     for the tap Tj respective to the controller Q is extracted from the signal detected at step 300. In a present embodiment, this signal is extracted from detector-output waveform 400a using multiplier 200 and integrator 208. First, multiplier 200 multiplies the Walsh code output from Walsh code generator 204 with the detector-output waveform 400a to extract the tracer signal. The product waveform is presented to integrator 208, which sums each pulse in the waveform 25     over the number of chips in the Walsh code. The output for each integrator 208 u 2082 are represented on Figure S as items 404ai and 404%, respectively.<br>
Specifically, for controller C«, since flic detector-output 400a = {0,0,0,0, 0,0,0,0}, and since the output of Walsh code generator 204i can be represented by the series Wi={l, -1, -1,1,-1,1,1,-1}, then the output of multiplier 200i can be represented as {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0} 30     x {1, -1, -1,1, -1,1,1, -1} - (0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0). The result 404at, from integrator 208t can be represented as 404ai =   (0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0) - 0.<br>
Similarly, for controller Cz» since detector-outouF400a== {0,0,0,0, 0,0,0,0} and since<br><br>
the output of Walsh-code generator 204z can be represented by the series Wf* {1, -1,1, -1,1, -1, 1, -1}, then flieoutptttofmuhqjKeraOOicanbereiHi^enled as {0,0,0,0, 0,0,0,0} x {1, -1,1, -1,1,-1,1,-1}- (0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0). The result 404&amp;2, from integrator 208a can be represented as 404a2 -   (0,0,0, 0,0,0,0,0) « 0.<br>
5	Referring again to Figure 3, the method ten advances to step 340 where the appropriate<br>
steering signal for the tap T; respective to a given controller Q is determined. In the present embodiment, this step is performed by adjuster 212. Continuing with the above example being discussed with reference to Figure 5, flic result 404a from each integrator 208 is then passed to its respective adjuster 212. As shows in fee example of Figure 5, the result 404a from each 10     integrator 20S was "0", and this value is passed to adjuster 212.<br>
In the present embodiments, adjuster 212 includes digital signal processing circuitry that is operable to make the determination of whether and how to steer the tap T based on the result 404a passed irons its respective integrator 208. Adjuster 212 determines from the received "0" input that no steering of a tap T is required and the method advances to step 360, wherein no 15     adjustment is made to the steering signal applied to the respective tap T.<br>
If adjuster 212 had received a positive or negative input from the result 404a, men an appropriate adjustment to the tap steering signal would be determined and the method would have advanced to step 360 where the appropriate adjustment of the steering signal is applied to the respective tap T.<br>
20	Continuing with the example being discussed in conjunction with Figure 5, as it was<br>
determined at step 340 mat no adjustment to the steering signal was required, and as feed forward amplifier 20 has just been activated, adjuster 212 determines mat the tap T for its respective controller C should remain in tt* nominal position. Each adjuster 212 then outputs a corresponding tap steering signal, indicated on Figure 5 as signals 408aI and 408a2. The exact 25     format oftapsteermg signals 408 can be generated usmg known meam and circuitry and need only correspond with the format required to control the specific type of gain and phase adjusters used within amplifier portion 24.<br>
Tap steering signals 408a are then presented to their respective summer 216, which sums the tap steering signal 408a with an attenuated version AW of the Walsh code W. This 30     attenuated WaMi code is indicated on Figure 5 as items AWi and AW2 and is the tracer signal to be injected in me signal paths of amplifier portion 24 for fee next iteration of the control method, fi will be apparent to those of skill in fee art that fee factors A for each attenuator 220<br><br>
can differ from each other. Attenuated Walsh codes AW are attenuated by factors A to a level, appropriate far me specific O»A employed, so they act as a "dither" modulated on top of its tap steering signal 408a and that operation of the gain and phase GPA is not impeded by the dither. Attenuated Walsh codes AW are produced by attenuators 220, which simply receive the 5     output of their respective Walsh code generator 204 and generate and output an attenuated version thereof to their respective summers 216. Thus, each tap steering signal 408a and respective attenuated Walsh code AW are combined by their respective summer 216, to create a dithered tap steering signal, indicated on Figure 5 as items 412ai and 412a2. At step 360, the dithered tap steering signals 412ai, 412% are then presented to their respective taps Tt, T2 of 10     GPAi and the method then returns to step 300, where another iteration of the method begins.<br>
As mentioned above, the method shown in Figure 3 operates simultaneously for detector D2 and controllers C3 and Q in the same manner as that described above for detector Di and controllers Ci and Q. Thus, steering adjustments can be effected at each tap T at the same tune. An example of a second iteration through the method of Figure 3 will now be discussed 15     with reference to Figure 6. It is assumed that, prior to this iteration an input signal is being input along input signal pain 40. Figure 6 again shows detector D1 and controllers C1 and C2. This iteration commences with step 300 again being performed by detector Di. As mere is now an input signal along input signal path 40, detector D1 now detects the tracer signal (dither) mat has been applied to at least one of the gain and phase adjusters and reflects this detection in detector-20     output waveform 400b. For purposes of explaining the present embodiment, it will be assumed mat detector-output waveform 400b is {-3, -1,0,2, -3,0, -1,1} and waveform 400b is input to multipliers 200) and 2OO2.<br>
Referring again to Figure 3, the method then advances to step 320 where the tap measurement for the tap T, respective to the controller C, is extracted from the signal detected at 25     step 300. In the present example discussed in conjunction with Figure 6, tilts signal is extracted from detector-output waveform 400b using multiplier 200, and integrator 208, of each controller Q. First, multiplier 200 multiplies the Walsh code output from Walsh code generator 204 with the detector-output waveform 400b. The product waveform is then presented to integrator 208, which sums each pulse in the waveform over the number chips in the Walsh code. The results 30     from each integrator 2081,2O82 are represented on Figure 6 as items 404bi and 404b2, respectively.<br>
Specifically, for controller Cj, since the detector-output 400b = {-3, -1, 0, 2, -3, 0, -1,1},<br><br>
and since the output of Walsh-code generator 204, Wi-{1, -1, -1,1, -1,1,1, -1}, then the output of multiplier 200! can be represented as {-3, -1,0,2, -3, 0, -1,1} x {1, -I, -1,1, -1,1,1, -1} = (-3,1,0,2, 3,0, -1, -1). The result for integrator 208] can be represented as 404b, =    (-3, 1, 0, 2,3,0, -1, -1) - 1. Similarly, for controller C2,400b - {-3, -1, 0,2, -3,0, -1,1} and since the 5     output of Walsh-code generate 2042 Wz- {1, -1,1, -1,1, -1,1, -1}, then the output of multiplier 2002 can be represented as {-3, -1,0,2, -3,0, -1,1} x {1, -1,1, -1,1, -1,1, -1} = (-3,1, 0, -2, -3, 0, -1, -1). Tfceresult for integrator 2O82 can be repre^oted as 404b2==    (-3,1,0, -2, -3,0, -1, -1) - -9.<br>
The method then advances to step 340 where the appropriate steering signal for the tap T 10     respective to a given controller C is determined. Continuing with the above example being<br>
discussed with reference to Figure 6, the result 404b for each integrator 208 is then passed to its respective adjuster 212. In this example, the result 404b produced by integrator 2081 was "1" and this value is passed to adjuster 212b. The result 404b2 produced by integrator 2O82 was "-9", and this value is passed to adjuster 2122- In each case, the sign of the integrator output 15     determines which way the respective tap T is adjusted.<br>
As previously discussed, adjusters 212 include digital signal processing circuitry which is operable to make the determination of whether to steer the tap T based on the result 404b passed from its respective integrator 208. hi the present embodiment, adjusters 212 are configured so mat, if the received input from its respective integrator 208 does not equal "0", then it is 20     determiDed that steering of its respective tap T is required. Accordingly, in the example of Figure 6 adjusters 212i and 2122 both determine that steering of the respective taps Ti, T2 is required.<br>
For controller Ci, adjuster 212i has received a "1", and thereby detetmines that the tap steering signal 408b 1 to tap Tj should be increased and accordingly, the output tap steering signal 25     408bi is increased by a preselected increment from the previous signal mat was used during the previous iteration through the method of Figure 3. For controller C2, adjuster 2122 has received a "-9", and thereby determines mat the tap steering signal 408b2 to tap T2 should be decreased and accordingly, the output tap steering signal 408t&gt;2 is decreased by a preselected increment from the previous signal that was used during the previous iteration through the method of 30     Figure 3. Tap steering signals 408b are men presented to their respective summer 216, which sums the tap steering signal 408a with the respective attenuated Walsh code AW. Thus, each tap steering signal 408a and attenuated Walsh code AW are summed together by their respective<br><br>
summer 216, to create a dithered tap steering signal, indicated on Figure 6 as items 412bi and 412ba. The dithered tap steering signals 412b are flien presented to their respective taps T of their respective GPA at step 360.<br>
Iterations through tibe method of Figure 3 repeat continuously for each controller C, 5     increasing or decreasing each tap output signal 412 until an optimum level for a respective tap T is reached, at which point the respective controller C simply mamtarns the tap output signal 412 at its current level (i.e. - the result from integrator 208 of the product from multiplier 200 of waveform 400 and Walsh code W is "0*0 until, during a subsequent iteration through the method of Figure 3, further steering of the respective tap T is required.<br>
10	While the embodiments discussed herein are directed to specific implementations of the<br>
invention, it will be understood that combinations, sub-sets and variations of the embodiments are within the scope of the invention. For example, it will now be apparent to those of skill in the art that amplifier portion 24 is a substantially known configuration for one type of amplifier portion of a feed forward amplifier, yet other configurations of amplifier portion 24 are within<br>
15     the scope of the invention. Other such configurations are discussed in a co-pending U.S. patent application 09/715,085, assigned to the assignee of the present invention, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. In particular, this application teaches a feed forward amplifier with a single pilot tone generator receiver, which is also suitable for incorporation into the present invention. A general discussion of feed forward amplifiers instructive to those of<br>
20     skill in the art for the design of amplifier portions is discussed in U.S. Patent 3,471,798, the contents of which are also incorporated herein by reference.<br>
As will also be apparent to those of skill in the art, feed forward amplifiers can include more than two gain and phase adjusters, hi such a case, a detector-controller circuit can be employed for each gain and phase adjuster and a separate orthogonal tracer signal employed for<br>
25     each tap T.<br>
Further, while the embodiments discussed herein refer specifically to FFAs having a pilot tone, it is to be understood that the present invention is also applicable to FFAs that do not use pilot tone, but use some other method, for example such as measuring intermodulation energy at detector D2.<br>
30	While the embodiments discussed herein refer to gain and phase adjusters having gam<br>
and phase taps T, it is to be understood that the present invention is not so limited and can be applied to other types of adjusters, such as phase and gain adjusters having in phase T and<br><br>
quadrature "Q" taps. Furthermore, while the embodiments discussed herein refer to controHing gain and phase adjustments in FFAs, it is to be understood thai the apparatus and method discussed herein can be modified for use with any appropriate circuit where adaptive control is used, such as feed forward circuits, etc.<br>
5	It is also to be understood that while the embodiments discussed herein refer to Walsh<br>
codes, any type of orthogonal tracer-signal, such as suitable length pseudo noise sequences or the like can be used, with appropriate modifications to other aspects of the remainder of the circuit. Additionally, while the number of chips of the Walsh codes used in the exemplary embodiments discussed herein corresponds to the period of the puke wave-form of the detector-output, it will 10     be understood that these periods need not correspond at all. to general, it is to be understood that any means or method for extracting a particular tap measurement from a detector-output can be used, such as using frequency division multiplexing.<br>
While presently less preferred due to increased complexity, it is contemplated that the magnitude of the output of integrator 208 could also be used to provide further information to 15     determine the amount by which each tap T is to be steered, in addition to using the polarity of the integrated signal to determine the direction the tap T should be steered. In such a case, instead of adjusting the amount by a preselected increment, a variable increment can be selected depending upon the magnitude of the output.<br>
It is also contemplated that the size of the increment can vary, in a preselected manner, 20     between start up of the adaptive circuit and normal operation of the adaptive circuit. For<br>
example, at start up and for a given number of iterations, amplifier 20 of Figure 1 can employ an increment/decrement size of 5 unite, followed by an increment/decrement size of 3 units for another given number of iterations, then followed by an increment/decrement size of 2 units for another given number of iterations, after which an increment/decrement size of 1 unit is 25     employed.  This should allow faster convergence of the ampUfier at start up.<br>
The present invention provides a novel feed forward amplifier that includes a method and apparatus for steering the gam and phase adjustment such mat each tap within the gain and phase adjusters is adjusted at substantially the same time to converge towards an optimum operating setting. Convergence towards me optimum settings are therefore obtained 30     substantially faster and/or more accurately than prior art feedforward amplifiers. Bach tap can have a tracer signal, which is orthogonal to other tracer signals, applied to the signal paths through the amplifier. The respective tap measurement is extracted and employed by each tap<br><br>
controller to appropriately alter the respective tap steering signal.<br>
