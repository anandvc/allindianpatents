Field of (he Invention<br>
The invention relates to lipoxin A4 analogs, their use in treating inflammatory and autoimmune disorders and pulmonary and respiratory tract inflammation, and pharmaceutical compositions containing the analogs and processes for their preparation.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
Lipoxins, together with leukotrienes, prostaglandins,. and thrombo.xanes, constitute a group of biologically active oxygenated fatty acids collec dvely referred to as th; eicosanoids. Eicosanoids are all synthesised de novo from membrane phospholipid via the arachidonic acid cascade of enzymes. Since thei initial .discovery in 1984, it has become apparent that lipoxins, which are a structural; ' unique class of eicosanoids, possess potent anti-inflammatory properties that suggest they may have therapeutic potential (Serhan, C.N., Prostaglandins (1997), Vol. 53, pp. 107-137; O'Meara, Y.M. et al., Kidney Int. (Suppl.) (1997), Vol. 58, pp. S56-S6;; Brady, H.R. et a!., Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. (1996), Vol. 5, pp. 20-27; aid Serhan, C.N., Biochem. Biophys. Ada. (1994), Vol. 1212, pp. 1-25). Of particular interest is the ability of lipoxins to antagonise the pro-inflammatory functions of leukotrienes in addition to other inflammatory agents such as platelet activating factor. FMLP, immune complexes and TNFα. Lipoxins are thus potent anti-neutrophil (PMN) agents which inhibit PMN chemotaxis, homotypic aggregation, adhesion, migration across endothelial and epithelial cells, margination/diapedesis and tissue inifltration (Lee, T. H., el al., din. Sci. (1989), Vol. 77, pp. 195-203; Fiore, S., et al., Biochemistry (1995), Vol. 34, pp. 16678-16686; Papyianni, A., et al., J. Immunol. (1996), Vol. 56, pp. 2264-2272; tiedqvist, P., et al., Acta. Physiol. Scand. (1989), Vol. 137,. pp. 157-572; Papyianni, A., et al., Kidney Intl. (1995), Vol. 47, pp. 1295-1302). In Addition, lipoxins are able to down-regulate endothelial P-selectin expression and adhesiveness for PMNs (Papyianni, A., et al., J. Immunol. (1996), Vol. 56, pp. 2264-2272), bronchial and vascular smooth muscle contraction, mesangial cell contraction and adhesiveness (Dahlen, S.E., et al., Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. (1988), Vo.. 229, pp. 107-130; Christie, PJE.,. el al., Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. (1992), Vol. 145, pp. 1281-1284; Badr, K.F., et al, Proc.<br><br>
Nat!. Acad. Sci. (1989), Vol. 86, pp. 3438-3442; and Brady, H.R., et al., Am. J. Physiol. (1990), Vol. 259, pp. F809-F815) and eosinophil chemotaxis and degranulation (Soyombo, 0., et al., Allergy (1994), Vol. 49, pp. 230-234).<br>
This unique anti-inflammatory profile of lipoxins, particularly lipoxin A4, has prompted interest in exploiting their potential as therapeutics for the treatment of inflammatory or autoimmune disorders and pulmonary and respiratory tract inflammation. Such disorders and inflammation which exhibit a pronounced inflammatory infiltrate are of particular interest and include dermatologic diseases, such as psoriasis, and rheumatoid arthritis, and respiratory disorders, such as asthma.<br>
As with other endogenous eicosanoids, naturally occurring lipoxins are unstable products which are rapidly metabolized and inactivated (Serhan, C.N., Prostaglandins (1997), Vol. 53, pp. 107-137). This has limited the development of the lipoxin field of research, particularly with respect to in vivo pharmacological assessment of the anti-inflammatory profile of lipoxins. Several U.S. Patents have issued directed to compounds having the active site of lipoxin A4, but with a longer tissue half-life. See, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 5,441,951 and 5,648,512, the disclosures of which are incorporated in full by reference herein. These compounds retain lipoxin A4 receptor binding activity and the potent in vitro and in vivo anti-inflammatory properties of natural lipoxins (Takano, T., et al., J. Clin. Invest.(1998), Vol. 101, pp. 819-826; Scalia, R., et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (1997), Vol. 94, pp. 9967-9972; Takano, T., et al.,J. Exp. Med. (1997), Vol. 185, pp. 1693-1704; Maddox, J.F., et al., J. Biol. Chem. (1997), Vol. 272, pp. 6972-6978; Serhan, C.N., et al., Biochemistry (1995), VoL 34, pp. 14609-14615).<br>

As used herein, "methods known to one of ordinary skill in the art" may be identified though various reference books and databases. Suitable reference books and treatise that detail the synthesis of reactants useful in the preparation of compounds of the present invention, or provide references to articles that describe the preparation,<br>
include for example, "Synthetic Organic Chemistry", John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York; S. R. Sandier et al., "Organic Functional Group Preparations," 2nd Ed., Academic Press, New York, 1983; H. 0. House, "Modem Synthetic Reactions", 2nd Ed., W. A. Benjamin, Inc. Menlo Park, Calif. 1972; T. L. Gilchrist, "Heterocyclic Chemistry", 2nd Ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1992; J. March, "Advanced Organic Chemistry: Reactions, Mechanisms and Structure", 4th Ed., Wiley-Interscience, New York, 1992. Specific and analogus reactants may also be identified through the indices of known chemicals prepared by the Chemical Abstract Service of the American Chemical Society, which are available in most public and university libraries, as well as through on-line databases (the American Chemical Society, Washington, D.C., www.acs.org may be contacted for more details). Chemicals that are known but not commercially available in catalogs may be prepared by custom chemical synthesis houses, where many of the standard chemical supply houses (e.g., those listed above) provide custom synthesis services.<br>
As used herein, "suitable conditions" for carrying out a synthetic step are explicitly provided herein or may be discerned by reference to publications directed to methods used in synthetic organic chemistry. The reference books and treatise set forth above that detail the synthesis of reactants useful in the preparation of compounds of the present invention, will also provide suitable conditions for carrying out a synthetic step according to the present invention.<br>
"Clathrates" as used herein refers to substances which fix gases, liquids or compounds as inclusion complexes so that the complex may be handled in solid form and the included constituent (or "guest" molecule) subsequently releases by the action of a solvent or by melting. The term "clathrate" is used interchangeably herein with the phrase "inclusion molecule" or with the phrase "inclusion complex". Clathrates used in the instant invention are prepared from cyclodextrins. Cyclodextrins are widely known as having the ability to form clathrates (i.e., inclusion compounds) with a variety of molecules. See, for example, Inclusion Compounds, edited by J.L. Atwood, J.E.D. Davies, and D.D. MacNicol, London, Orlando, Academic Press, 1984; Goldberg, I., "The Significance of Molecular Type, Shape and Complementarity in Clathrate Inclusion", Topics in Current Chemistry (1988), Vol. 149, pp. 2-44; Weber, E. et al., "Functional Group Assisted Clathrate Formation - Scissor-Like and Roof-Shaped Host Molecules", Topics in Current Chemistry (1988), Vol. 149, pp. 45-135; and MacNicol, D.D. et al., "Clathrates and Molecular Inclusion Phenomena", Chemical Society Reviews (1978), Vol. 7, No. 1, pp. 65-87. Conversion into cyclodextrin clathrates is known to increase the stability and solubility of certain compounds, thereby facilitating<br>

B.        Utility of the Compounds of the Invention<br>
The compounds of the invention are lipoxin A^ analogs that have similar biological activity of natural lipoxin v\4, but with an enhanced resistance to metabolic degradation. Accordingly, the compounds of the invention are useful in treating inflammatory or autoimmune disorders in mammals, particularly in humans. In particular, the compounds of the invention are useful in inhibiting acute or chronic inflammation or an inflammatory or autoimmune response that is mediated by neutrophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, NK cells or other immune cells which contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory, immune or autoimmune diseases. The compounds are also useful in the treatment of proliferative disorders including, but not limited to, those associated with derangements in the inflammatory or immune response, such as cancer. The compounds are also useful as inhibitors of angiogenic responses in the pathogenesis of cancer.<br>
Accordingly, the compounds can be used to treat the following inflammatory or autoimmune disorders in mammals, particularly humans: anaphylactic reactions, allergic reactions, allergic contact dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, chemical and non-specific irritant contact dermatitis, urticaria, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, septic or endotoxic shock, hemorrhagic shock, shock-like syndromes, capillary leak syndromes induced by immunotherapy of cancer, acute respiratory distress syndrome, traumatic shock, immune- and pathogen-induced pneumonias, immune complex-mediated pulmonary injury. and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, inflammatory bowel diseases including ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and post-surgical trauma, gastrointestinal ulcers, diseases associated with ischemia-reperfusion injury including acute myocardial ischemia and infarction, acute renal failure, i'schemic bowel disease and acute hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke, immune-complex-mediated glomerulonephritis, autoimmune diseases including insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus, acute and chronic organ transplant rejection, transplant arteriosclerosis and fibrosis, cardiovascular disorders including hypertension, atherosclerosis, aneurysm, critical leg ischemia, peripheral arterial occhisive disease and Reynaud's syndrome, complications of diabetes including diabetic nephropathy, neuropathy and retinopathy, ocular<br>
disorders including macular degeneration and glaucoma, neurodegenerative disorders including delayed neurodegeneration in stroke, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, encephalitis and HIV dementia, inflammatory and neuropathic pain, including arthritic pain, periodontal disease including gingivitis, ear infections, migraine, benign prostatic hyperplasia, cancers including, but not limited to, leukemias and lymphomas, prostate cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, malignant melanoma, renal carcinoma, head and neck tumors and colorectal cancer.<br>
The compounds are also useful in treating folliculitis induced by inhibitors of epidermal growth factor (EOF) or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase used in the treatment of solid tumors. Clinical trials have revealed folliculitis (inflammation of the hair follicle manifested by severe acne-like skin rash on the face, chest and upper back) as a major dose-limiting side effect of such treatments. Such folliculitis is associated with an infiltraiton of neutrophils suggesting products secreted by activated neutrophils to be the cause of the inflammation. The lipoxin A4 analogs of the instant invention inhibit neutrophil or eosinophil-mediated inflammation, and are therefore useful in treating such folliculitis, thereby improving the quality of life of the treated cancer patients but also allowing for the increase of the dosage of the EGF inhibitor or EGFR kinase inhibitor or the extension of the duration of the treatment, resulting in improved efficacy of the desired inhibitor.<br>
The compounds are also useful in the treatment of pulmonary and respiratory inflammation, including, but not limited to, asthma, chronic bronchitis, bronchiolitis, bronchiolitis obliterans (including such with organizing -pneumonia), allergic inflammation of the respiratory tract (including rhinitis and sinusitis), eosinophilic granuloma, pneumonias, pulmonary fibroses, pulmonary manifestations of connective tissue diseases, acute or chronic lung injury, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, adult respiratory distress syndrome, and other non-infectious inflammatory disorders of the lung characterized by eosinophil infiltration.<br>
For example, the compounds of the invention are useful in the inhibition of: eosinophil-mediated inflammation of the lung or tissues; neutrophil-mediated inflammation of the lung; lymphocyte-mediated inflammation of the lung; cytokine and chemokine production, including interleukin-5, interleukin-13 and eotaxin; lipid mediator generation, including prostaglandin £2 and cysteinyl leukotrienes; airway hyper-responsiveness; and airway and vascular inflammation.<br>
C.        Testing of the Compounds of the Invention<br>
A hallmark of inflammation is the adhesion and transmigration across endomelium of neutrophils, eosinophils and other inflammatory cells. A similar process is observed for the migration of cells across polarized epithelial cells that occur in the lung, gastrointestinal tract and other organs. Cell.culture models of these processes are available and have been used to show that lipoxin A4 and stable lipoxin A4 analogs inhibit the transmigration of human neutrophils across human endothelial cells and epithelial cells, including the human intestinal epithelial cell line TM. Accordingly, one of ordinary skill in the art can test the compounds of the invention for their ability to inhibit the transmigration of human neutrophils and eosinophils across human endothelial cells and epithelial cells by performing assays similar to those described in Colgan, S.P., et al, J. Clin. Invest. (1993), Vol. 92, No. 1, pp. 75-82 and Serhan, C.N., et-al, Biochemistry (1995), Vol. 34, No. 44, pp. 14609-14615.<br>
The air pouch model and/or the mouse zymosan-induced peritonitis model may be used to evaluate the in vivo efficacy of the compounds of the invention in treating an inflammatory response. These are acute experimental models of inflammation characterized by infiltration of inflammatory cells into a localized area. See, e.g., the in vivo assays described in Ajuebor, M.N., et al, Immunology (1998), Vol. 95, pp. 625-630; Gronert, K., et al., Am. J. Pathol. (2001), Vol. 158, pp. 3-9; Pouliot, M., et al., Biochemistry (2000), Vol. 39. pp. 4761-4768; Clish, C.B., et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. (1999), Vol. 96, pp. 8247-8252; and Hachicha, M., et al., J. Exp.Med. (1999), Vol. 189, pp. 1923-30.<br>
Animal models (i.e., in vivo assays) may also be utilized to determine the efficacy of the compounds of the invention in treating asthma and related disorders of the pulmonary and respiratory tract, including, but not limited to, asthma. See, e.g., the assays described in De Sanctis, G.T. et al., Journal of Clinical Investigation (1999), Vol. 103, pp. 507-515 and Campbell, E.M., et al, J. Immunol (1998), Vol.161, No. 12, pp. 7047-7053.<br>

To prepare the cyclodextrin clathrates of this invention, the lipoxin A4 analogs of formula (I) and formula (II), or the lipoxin A4 analogs described and claimed in U.S. Patent No. 5,441,951; U.S. Patent No. 5,079,261; U.S. Patent No. 5,648,512; and U.S. Patent No. 6,048,897, as defined above in the Summary of the Invention, can be dissolved in a pharmacologically acceptable solvent, e.g., in an alcohol, preferably ethanol, in a ketone, e.g., acetone or in an ether, e.g., diethyl ether, and mixed with aqueous solutions of tx-cyclodextrin, p-cyclodextrin or y-cyclodextrin, preferably P-cyclodextrin, at 20°C to 80°C; or the acids of the lipoxin A* analogs as defined above in the Summary of the Invention in the form of the aqueous solutions of their salts (e.g., Na" or K'salts) can be admixed with a cyclodextrin and after solution with the<br>
equivalent amount of an acid (e.g., HC1 or HjSCU) to afford the corresponding cyclodextrin clathrate.<br>
At this point or after cooling, the corresponding cyclodextrin clathrates separate in the form of crystals. However, it is also possible to convert oily and also crystalline compounds of formula (I) and/or formula (II), as defined above in the Summary of the Invention, by rather long stirring (e.g., for 1 hour to 14 days) at ambient temperature, by treatment with an aqueous solution of cyclodexrrins, into the corresponding cyclodextrin clathrate form. The clathrates can then be isolated as solid, free-flowing crystals by suctioning off the solvents and drying.<br>
Cyclodexrrins used in this invention are commercially, available, for example, from Aldrich Chemical Co., or can be prepared by methods known to those skilled in the art. See, for example, Croft, A.P. et ai., "Synthesis of Chemically Modified Cyclodexrrins", Tetrahedron (1983), Vol. 39, No. 9, pp. 1417-1474. Suitable cyclodexrrins will include a wide variety of those which produce clathrates of the compounds of formula (I) and formula (II) as set forth above. See, for example, J. E. F. Reynolds (ed.) Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia 28th ed. The Pharmaceutical Press, London 1982, p. 333 and 389-390 and O.-A. Neumueller (ed.), Roempps Chemie-Lexikon, 8. Aufl. Franckh'sche Verlagshandlung, Stuttgart 1981, p. 763-764, 841,1053-1054.<br>
By selection of the suitable amounts of cyclodextrins and water it is possible to obtain the new clathrates in a stoichiometric composition with a reproducible content of effective substance. The clathrates can be used in a dry hygroscopic form or in a water-containing, but less hygroscopic form. Typical molar ratios of cyclodextrin to a compound of formula (I) or a compound of formula (II) is 2:1 (cyclodextrinicompound).<br>

Trans-epithelial and trans-endothelial migration assays<br>
Culture of Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC):<br>
Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC)- were cultured according to the methods disclosed in Serhan, C.N., et al, Biochemistry (1995), Vol. 34, No. 44, pp. 14509-14615. In particular, HUVEC were used at passages 1 and 2 and were isolated by collegenase digestion (0.1% collagenase, CLS3; Worthington Biochem. Corp., Freehold, New Jersey) and propagated on gelatin-coated (1%) tissue culture plates (Costar Corp., Cambridge, Massachusetts) in RPMI 1640 cell culture medium (BioWhittaker Inc., Walkersville, Maryland) supplemented with 15% bovine calf serum (BCS) (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, Utah), 15% NU-serum (Collaborative Research Inc., Lexington, Massachusetts), 50 ug/mL endothelial mitogen (Biomedical Technologies Inc., Stoughton, Massachusetts), 8 units/mL heparin, 50 units/mL penicillin, and 50 ug/mL streptomycin. For transmigration assays HUVEC were seeded and grown to confluence on gelatin-coated (1%) polycarbonate permeable supports (inserts) with a surface area of 0.33 cm2 (Costar Inc., Cambridge, MA).<br>
Epithelial Cell Culture:<br>
Tg4 cells were grown in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium and Hams F-12 medium supplemented with 15 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.5), 14 mM NaHCC&gt;3, 40 (.ig/mL penicillin, 8 u.g/mL ampicillin, 90 ug/mL streptomycin, and 5% newborn calf serum (Dharmasatbaphorn et al., 1990). For apical-to-basolateral<br>
transmigration experiments, T84 monolayers were grown on collagen-coated, polycarbonate-permeable supports (inserts) with a surface area of 0.33 cm2 (Costar Inc., Cambridge, MA) as described in Parkos, C.A.,et at., J. Clin. Invest. (1991), Vol. 88, pp. 1605-1612.            For physiologically directed, basolateral-to-apical neutrophil<br>
transmigration experiments, Tg4 cells were plated on the underside of 0.33 cm2 polycarbonate filters that had been lightly coated with rat-tail collagen as described in Parkos, C.A., et al. This permitted growth of inverted monolayers, which thus allowed neutrophils to settle by gravity into the immediate subepithelial compartment.<br>
Assay:<br>
Human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) were isolated from normal human volunteers and suspended-at a concentration of 5x107- cells/mL in modified Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS), without Ca2+ and Mg2+, with lOmM Hepes, pH 7.4, (Sigma). Prior to the addition of PMN, Tg4 epithelial or HUVEC endothelial cell monolayers were extensively rinsed in HBSS to remove residual serum components. PMN were pre-exposed to compounds of the invention at concentrations ranging from 10"" to 10"7 M for 15 minutes at 25°C. The transmigration assay was performed by the addition of PMN (40 ul) to HBSS (containing Ca2+ and Mg2+, 160 u.1) in the upper chambers after chemoattractant (10 nM fMLP) was added to the opposing (lower) chambers. PMN were not washed free of the compounds of the invention prior to addition to monolayers. PMN (1x106) were added at time 0. Transmigration was allowed to proceed for 60 minutes. All experiments were performed in a 37°C environment to ensure that endothelial/epithelial monolayers, solutions, plasticware, etc., were maintained at uniform 37°C temperature. Transmigration was quantitated by assaying for the PMN azurophilic-granule, marker myeloperoxidase (MPO). Following each transmigration assay, non-adherent PMN were extensively washed from the surface of the monolayer and PMN cell equivalents (PMN CE), estimated from a standard curve, were assessed as the number of PMN which had completely traversed the monolayer (i.e., across the monolayer into the reservoir bath).<br>
The compounds of the invention, when tested in this assay, demonstrated the ability to inhibit the transmigration of PMN across polarized monolayers of epithelial cells and vascular endothelial cells, which are sites of two important immune events in host defense and inflammation.<br>
Example 12<br>
(In Vivo Assay)<br>
Chemotaxis Assay<br>
Chemotaxis experiments were performed on freshly prepared human neutrophils (PMN) obtained from whole blood donated by healthy volunteers. Blood was anticoagulated (heparin), centrifuged at low speed and platelet-rich plasma removed by aspiration. The remaining blood was mixed with an equal volume of phosphate buffered saline minus Ca+2/Mg+2, pH 7.4 (PBS"'") and an equal volume of 3% dextran in PBS"'" was added, sample mixed and allowed to settle. The upper layer enriched for white blood cells (~25 mL) was applied to a 15 mL cushion of Ficoll-Hypaque and centrifuged at 400g for 30 minutes at 18-22 °C. The upper layers were aspirated and the PMN cell pellet subjected to hypotonic red blood cell lysis. PMN were washed twice and resuspended in Hank's Balanced Salt Solution minus Ca+2/Mg+2 pH 7.4 (HBSS"'") at IxlO7 cells/mL in a centrifuge tube. 2.5 uM Calcein-AM (Molecular Probes cat #C3100) was added and the cells incubated for 25 minutes at ambient temperature, then placed in a 37°C incubator for 5 minutes. The cells were then centrifuged and washed twice in HBSSV" to remove residual Calcein-AM. Neutrophils were finally resuspended at 2 x!07/mL with HBSSV" + 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4.<br>
Chemotaxis assays were performed with specialized 96-well plates. The 3 um filter was bonded to a metallic frame and was selectively coated with a hydrophobia mask around each well. This hydrophobic mask allowed for the direct addition of cells to the topside of the filter. Neutrophils (15 uL, 1.5x10s cells/well) were added to the top of the ChemoTx® plate (Cat #101-3). For inhibition studies, PMN were pre-incubated for 15 minutes with a compound of the invention. Prior to adding PMN to the top chamber, 30 uL of chemoattractant (10 nM fMLP or 10 nM LTB4 or F-12 culture medium (without phenol red) was added to the lower chamber, the filter mat was then snapped in place and PMN added to the filter with an 8-channel pipettor. The assay plates were incubated for 90 minutes at 5% CO2+ 95% air at 37°C. After incubation, the filter mat was removed and the plate was read in the Victor II plate reader (485nm-excitation/535nm emission). The fluorescently tagged cells that have migrated through the filter into the lower chamber were measured.<br>
When tested in this assay, the compounds of the invention demonstrated the ability to inhibit human neutrophil chemotaxis.<br>
Example 13<br>
(In Vivo Assay)<br>
Mouse zymosan-induced peritonitis model<br>
The following assay was used to evaluate the ability of the compounds of the invention to inhibit inflammation characterized by cellular infiltration into a localized area.<br>
A compound of the invention in 0.1% ethanol/PBS vehicle was administered via intravenous, intra-peritoneal, subcutaneous or intra-gastric delivery to six to eight week-old FVB mice (average 21 g) purchased from Charles River Laboratories. For intra-gastric studies, 200 uL of each compound concentration were delivered using animal feeding needles. Approximately forty-five minutes later, 1 mL (1 mg/mL) zymosan A was injected into the peritoneum. Two and a half hours after the intra-peritoneal injection, mice were euthanized with an overdose of isoflurane and peritoneal lavages with 5 mL of PBS containing calcium and magnesium were collected. Total leukocytes were enumerated by light microscopy and percentage inhibition relative to vehicle control is calculated. For differential inhibitory effects on neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes and lymphocytes, ~250,000 cells were transferred to glass slides and stained with 0.4% of Wright Giemsa Stain, differentiated by counting under a microscope (x40) and percentage inhibition relative to vehicle control calculated.<br>
When tested in this assay, the compounds of the invention demonstrated the ability to inhibit the migration of inflammatory cells (i.e., neutrophiles, monocytes and lymphocytes) into the peritoneum. Accordingly, the compounds of the invention were shown to be useful in treating an inflammatory disorder in an in vivo model.<br>
Example 14 (In Vivo Assay)<br>
The following assay may be performed in a similar manner as the assay described in Campbell, E.M., et ai, J. Immunol. (1998), Vol. 161, No. 12, p. 7047-7053.<br>
The assay utilizes CBA/J mice sensitized with soluble cockroach antigents in incomplete Freund's adjuvant intraperitoneally. The assay uses 6-8 animals in each group/time point, including a group for controls. After 14 days, the mice are sensitized again sensitized with soluble cockroach antigen by an intranasal administration, followed 3-5 days later with an intratracheal injection of cockroach<br>
antigen. The mice can be given a second intratracheal challenge at 48 hrs post-primary. Prior to the final challenge, the allergic mice receive one of 3 doses of a compound of the invention. After 8 and 24 hours post-challenge, the mice are examined for airway hyperreactivity and the accumulation of leukocyte subsets are monitored in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and in histologic sections. The second challenge is given at a time when there is a considerable amount of inflammation found within and around the airway, including eosinophils. This scenario is representative of what occurs in chronic asthmatics. This chronic stage response is much more severe and has significantly higher levels of leukocyte infiltration and a synergistic increase in the numbers and activation of eosinophils. This inflammation is dependent upon Th2 type immune responses. This analysis allows for the identification of whether a compound of the invention can attenuate the responses, i.e., leukocyte migration and the clinically relevant airway physiology.<br>
In addition to the above analysis, various samples collected from the ^study, including the BAL fluid and lung tissue, further analysis may be performed to determine the manner in which the compounds of the invention are attenuating the responses. Specifically, cytokine (IL-4,IL-5, IL10, IL-13, IL-18, TNP, IFN, etc.) levels in the BAL fluid and the lung tissue homogenates can be analyzed, as well as histamine and eosinophil peroxidase levels (see Wu, W., et ai, Journal of Clinical Investigation (2000), Vol. 105, pp. 1455-1463).<br>
Animals:<br>
Female C57/BL6 mice were purchased from either The Jackson Laboratory, (Bar Harbor, ME) or Charles River Breeding Laboratories (Wilmington, MA) and were maintained under standard pathogen-free conditions. All materials were obtained from Sigma Chemical Company (St. Louis, MO) unless otherwise indicated.<br>
Sensitization and induction of the airway response:<br>
Normal C57/BL6 mice were immunized with 10 ug of cockroach allergen (Bayer) in IF A. on day 0. In order to localize the response to the lung, the mice were given an intranasal administration of 10 u.g of cockroach allergen in 10 uL of diluent on day 14. This initial intranasal allergen induced little cellular infiltrate into the lungs of the mice upon histological examination. Mice were then challenged 6 days later (referred to hereafter as primary challenge response) by intratracheal administration of 10 ug of cockroach allergen in 50 uL of sterile PBS or with PBS<br>
alone (vehicle). The magnitude of leukocyte recruitment in both the vehicle control and cockroach allergen-challenged mice was examined histologically. Only the cockroach allergen-challenged mice displayed a significant inflammatory response that included mononuclear cell and eosinophil infiltration. Some mice were given a second intratracheal injection of either cockroach allergen (10 ug in 50 uL) or diluent control and subsequently analyzed (secondary rechallenge response). In separate studies, the effect of the anti-murine MlP-la and anti-murine eotaxin polyclonal antibodies on cockroach allergen-induced responses were assessed by giving sensitized mice an i.p. dose of the antibody (0.5 mL, tilers of 106/mL) at 1 hour prior to each allergen challenge. Normal rabbit serum (NRS) was used as a control. Polyclonal antibodies had previously been demonstrated to block the chemotaxis of murine eosinophils in vitro.<br>
Measurement of airway hyperactivity:<br>
Airway hyperactivity was measured using Buxco mouse plethysmograph, which is specifically designed for the low tidal volumes (Buxco) as previously described in Lukacs, N.W., et al., J. Immunol. (1992), Vol. 13, pp. 501. Briefly, the mouse to be tested was anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital and incubated via cannulation of the trachea with an 18-gauge metal tube. The mouse was subsequently ventilated with a Harvard pump ventilator (tidal volume = 0.4 mL, frequency =120 breaths/min., positive end-expiatory pressure 2.5 to 3.0 cm t^O and the tail vein was cannulated with a 27-gauge needle for injection of the methacholine challenge. The plethysmograph was sealed and readings were monitored by computer. Since the box was a closed system, a change in lung volume was represented by a change in box pressure (Pbox), which was measured by a differential transducer. The system was calibrated with a syringe that delivered a known volume of 2 mL. A second transducer was used to measure the pressure swings at the opening of the trachea tube (Paw), referenced to the body box (i.e., pleural pressure, and to provide a measure of transpulmonary pressure (P,p = Paw-Pbox). The trachea transducer was calibrated at a constant pressure of 20 cm HiO. Resistance was calculated by the Buxco software by dividing the change in pressure (Ftp) by the change in flow (F) (5Ptp/5F; units = cm H2O/mL/s) at two time points from the volume curve, based upon a percentage of the inspiratory volume. Once the mouse was hooked up to the box it was ventilated for 5 minutes prior to acquiring readings. Once baseline levels were stabilized and initial readings were taken, a methacholine challenge was given via the cannulated tail vein. After determining a dose-response curve (0.001 to 0.5 mg), an optimal dose was chosen<br>
 (0.1 mg of methacholine) which was used throughout the rest of the experiments in this study. After the methacholine challenge, the response was monitored and the peak airway resistance was recorded as a measure of airway hyperactivity.<br>
Compounds of the invention, when tested in the above assay, demonstrated the ability to decrease airway resistance in an animal model for asthma.<br>
