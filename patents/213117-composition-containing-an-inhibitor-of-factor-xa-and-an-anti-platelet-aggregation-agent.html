The subject of the present invention related to a combination of direct or indirect selective inhibitors of factor Xa which act via  antithrombin III, in combination with a compound with anti-platelet aggregation activity, for their activity in arterial thromboembolic diseases.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions containing the combination of antithrombotic and anti-platelet aggregation active ingredients are also included in the invention. The active ingredients constituting the combination are present in the free state or in the form of one of their pharmaceutically acceptable salts.<br>
During the last decade, a lot of attention has been given to studying the role played by platelets in the development of diseases associated with atherosclerosis (myocardial infarction, angina, cerebral vascular accident, arterial diseases of the lower limbs and the like). Moreover, the well-established role of the blood clotting process in arterial thrombosis has allowed the development of numerous medicines which inhibit various clotting enzymes. The discovery of the essential role of thrombin and factor Xa in the thrombotic process has led to the use of anticoagulants being proposed in the prevention and treatment of arterial thrombosis.<br>
Among the anticoagulants available, heparin is the preferred medicine in the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic diseases.<br>
Heparin catalyses, in particular via   anti¬thrombin III (AT III), the inhibition of two enzymes which are involved in the blood clotting cascade, namely factor Xa and factor Ila (or thrombin). The relative importance of these two activities in the overall activity of heparin remains unknown. Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) preparations contain chains consisting of 4 to 30 monosaccharides which act like heparin on factor Xa and on thrombin but which have the property of being more selective for factor Xa than for thrombin. In spite of this different biological activity profile, low-molecular-weight heparin has an antithrombotic effect as has been demonstrated in studies on animals and on patients suffering from thromboembolic diseases or at risk of forming a thrombus (Hirsch J. et al.,   J. Thromb, Hemest., 1987, Leuven, Belgium Leuven University Press, 325-348).<br>
Unlike hepaxin and the LMWHs, some synthetic oligosaccharides, especially those described in EP 84999,<br><br>
have the property of selectively inhibiting factor Xa via antithrombin III but have no activity on thrombin. These synthetic oligosaccharides which correspond to the antithrombin-binding domain (ABD) of heparin are known and manifest an unthrombotic activity in venous thrombosis. These compounds are described in EP 529715 and EP 621282.<br>
The efficacy of these oligonucleotides in the prevention of arterial thrombosis was hardly probable because of their inability to inhibit thrombin.<br>
Indeed, it has long been known in the literature that thrombin plays a key role in arterial thrombosis and this is again confirmed by recent experiments (L. A. Marker, Blood, 1991, 77. 1006-1012). Thrombin inhibitors therefore constitute an effective means of preventing or combating this type of thrombosis.<br>
It has been observed, by comparing the efficacy of heparin to those of direct thrombin inhibitors (direct inhibitor means an inhibitor which inhibits thrombin without requiring AT III), that they are much more effective than heparin for preventing and treating arterial thrombosis (Arteriosclerosis and thrombosis, 1992, 12,   879-885, J. Am. Coll. Cardiol., 1994, 23,    993-1003). The reason for this lack of efficacy is that the heparin/AT III complex cannot, for reasons to do with steric hindrance, inhibit thrombin in a thrombus rich in platelets as is a platelet thrombus.<br>
The low activity of heparin in contrast to direct inhibitors is therefore linked to its need to use AT III. This explanation is further justified by the recent observation that the direct inhibitors of factor Xa which act without AT III are also effective, in animal models of arterial thrombosis (Circulation, 1991, 84, 1741-1748 Thrombosis Haemost., 1995 74,   640-645).<br>
A compound which, on the one hand, acts via AT III and, on the other hand, does not inhibit thrombin, would therefore be expected to possess no activity in arterial thrombosis.<br>
It has now been found, according to the present invention, quite surprisingly, that a direct or indirect selective inhibitor of factor Xa, alone or in combination with a compound with anti-platelet aggregation activity, can be used for their activity in thromboembolic diseases of arterial origin.<br>
Although it is known to date that the anti-factor Xa agents and the anti-platelet aggregation agents<br><br>
a(i:t via  two different mechanisms of action, the combination or association of these products for use in arterial thromboembolic diseases has never been studied.<br>
Accordingly, the subject of the present invention is, according to one of its features, the use of one or more direct or indirect selective inhibitors of factor Xa, alone or in combination with one or more compounds with anti-platelet aggregation activity, for the preparation of medicines intended to prevent and to treat thromboembolic diseases of arterial origin.<br>
According to the invention, selective inhibitor of factor Xa is understood to mean a compound capable of selectively inhibiting factor Xa via antithrombin (AT III) but not exhibiting significant activity towards thrombin. Preferably, the inhibitor has no activity towards thrombin.<br>
According to another of its features, the subject of the present invention is also the use of a selective inhibitor of factor Xa which acts via  AT III, alone or in combination with a compound with anti¬platelet aggregation activity, for the preparation of medicines intended to combat thromboembolic diseases of arterial origin.<br>
Advantageously, the said direct inhibitors of factor Xa are DX-9065a and its analogues. DX-9065a is in particular described in Thromb. Haemost. 1994, 71, 314-319 and in Drugs Fut. 1995, 206,   564-566 and also in EP 540051. Also advantageously, the indirect inhibitors of factor Xa are synthetic oligosaccharides.<br>
Among the direct selective inhibitors of factor Xa, DX-9065a is particularly advantageous, and consists of (2S)-2-[4-[ [ (3S)-l-acetimidoyl-S-pyrrolidinyl] oxy] phenyl] -3- (■7-amidino-2-naphthyl) -propanoic acid hydrochloride pentahydrate in which the acid has the structure (A)<br><br>
and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, described in particular in Thromb. Haemost. 1994, 71, 314-319 and in Drugs Fut. 1995, 206,    564-566 and also in EP 540051. Among the indirect selective inhibitors of factor Xa and advantageously, the synthetic oligo-<br><br>
saccharides are pentasaccharides, such as those claimed in patents EP 84999 and US 5,378,829.<br>
Particularly advantageous pentasaccharides are in particular:<br>

(imino)methyl}phenyl]thiazol-2-yl}-3-aminopropionic acid,<br>

trihydrochloride, designated SR 121566.<br>
The formulae of SR 121787 and of SR, 121566 are recalled below:<br><br><br>
The selective inhibitor of factor Xa, alone or in combination with an anti-platelet aggregation agent, is particularly useful for the treatment or prophylaxis of pathological conditions such as disorders of the cardiovascular or cerebrovascular system such as thromboembolic disorders associated with atherosclerosis or with diabetes such as unstable angina, cerebral attack, restenosis following angioplasty, endarterectomy or fitting of metallic endovascular prostheses, or such as thromboembolic disorders associated with rethrombosis following thrombolysis, with infarction, with dementia of ischaemic origin, with peripheral arterial diseases, with haemodialysis, with atrial fibrillations, or during the use of vascular prostheses, of aortocoronary bypasses or for stable or unstable angina, or for patients treated by a revascularization procedure at the risk of thrombosis including percutaneous angioplasties, endovascular prostheses, vascular prostheses, aortocoronary bypasses.<br>
As examples of pharmaceutically acceptable organic salts, there may be mentioned oxalate, maleate, fumarate, methanesulphonate, benzoate, ascorbate, pamoate, succinate, hexamate, bismethylenesalicylate, ethanedisulphonate, acetate, propionate, tartrate, salicylate, citrate, gluconate, lactate, malate, cinnamate, mandelate, citraconate, aspargate, palmitate, stearate, itaconate, glycolate, p-aminobenzoate.<br><br>
glutamate, benzenesulphonate and theophylline acetate as well as the salts formed from an amino acid such as the lysine or histidine salt.<br>
As examples of pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic salts, there may be mentioned hydrochloride, hydrobromide, sulphate, sulphamate, phosphate and nitrate.<br>
The neutralization of activated factor X (Xa) (by antithrombin III) can be catalysed by the pentasaccharide (PS) such as low-molecular-weight heparin. Unlike the low-molecular weight heparin, the pentasaccharide is completely devoid of activated thrombin. In addition, the pentasaccharide hardly modifies the haemostasis tests and in particular the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) test on human plasma and unlike heparin, it does not potentiate ADP or platelet aggregation induced by collagen.<br>
However, the antithrombotic effects of the pentasaccharide have been demonstrated after intravenous (i.V.) and subcutaneous (s.c. ) administration in different animal models with different types of induced thromboses (the venous stasis model in rats, the arteriovenous shunt model in rats, the Wessler model in rabbits) (Hobellen PMJ et  al,   Tromb. &amp; Haemost., 1996, 63(2),   265-270 and Amar J. et al,   Br. J. Haematol., 1990, 76,   94-100) . As regards the risk of bleeding, the loss of blood at high PS dose tested in rats (21.7 mg/kg) is identical to that observed with 200 units anti-Xa/kg of heparin, thus indicating that PS only slightly increases blood loss compared with standard heparin or LMWHs.<br>
To illustrate the invention and by way of example, there will be given below the results obtained during the study of the potentiation of the antithrombotic effect in rabbits by co-administration of a selective inhibitor of factor Xa and of an anti-platelet aggregation agent. As selective inhibitor of factor Xa, SR 90107/ORG 31540 (or PS) was selected and the anti-platelet aggregation agent was selected from the antagonists of glycoprotein Ilb/IIIa, namely SR 121787A.<br>
The aim of this test was therefore to determine the arterial antithrombotic effects of the co¬administration of an anti-Xa, the pentasaccharide SR 90107/ORG 31540 and of an antagonist of the GPIIb/IIIa receptors, SR 121787A.<br><br>
New Zealand male rabbits weighing 2.7 to 3 kg, obtained from the Lago breeding unit (France) were used. They were housed under standard conditions.<br>
The formation of the thrombus was induced by external electrical stimulation of the left common carotid according to the Hladovec I. et  al,   method (Experimental arterial thrombosis in rats with continuous registration, Throm. Diathes. Haemor. 1971; 26:   407-410). The rabbits were anaesthetized with pentobarbital at the dose of 30 mg/kg iv. A segment of the left carotid artery was exposed and insulated by a piece of insulating film. Electrodes were inserted under the artery. A partial stricture inducing a 20% reduction in flow rate was made in the artery- The latter was then stimulated with the aid of a 2.5 mA current delivered by a constant current stimulator for 3 minutes. The thrombotic occlusion was evaluated by continuous measurement of the flow rate of blood in the carotid by means of an NARCO electromagnetic flow meter. This measurement was made over an observation period of 45 minutes.<br>
For the treatment, solutions of SR 90107/ORG 31540 and of SR 121787A were prepared immediately before use in a saline solution. The solutions of SR 90107/ORG 31540 were injected by the IV route 5 minutes before induction of thrombosis in a volume of 1 ml/kg. SR 121787A was administered by the oral route 2 hours earlier.<br>
The results were calculated and expressed as % reduction in blood flow rate at various times relative to time 0. They are grouped together in Figure 1.<br>
In the control animals, the flow rate was gradually reduced from 20.9±2.1 to 3.812.5 ml/min (n = 8: mean for 8 animals) over 15 minutes and 1.5±1.4 ml/min over 20 min. It then stayed at this level for up to 45 minutes. SR 90107/ORG 31540, at the dose of 300 nmol/kg, had no influence on this reduction in flow rate. 600 nmol/kg of SR 90107/ORG 31540 reduced it slightly but not significantly.<br>
SR 121787A administered 2 hours before as sole active ingredient at the oral dose of 10 mg/kg, did not significantly modify the course of the carotid output whereas 20 mg/kg almost completely inhibited the drop in the latter.<br>
The co-administration of the pentasaccharide SR 90107/ORG 31540 and of the antagonist of the GPIIb/IIIa receptor SR 121787A, at doses which are separately inactive (300 nmol/kg iv and 10 mg/kg po.<br><br>
respectively), completely protected against reduction in flow rate and therefore against the arterial thrombosis thus induced.<br>
No toxicological effect of SR 90107/ORG 31540 was observed on any animal species whatsoever, regardless of the concentration tested in the appropriate toxicity studies and by repeated assays (over a period of 4 weeks with up to 10 mg/kg subcutaneously). SR 90107/ORG 31540 is not mutagenirectoc in the AMES test, or in the DNA repair test.<br>
Thus, the use of a direct selective inhibitor of factor Xa, such as DX-9065a or of an indirect selective inhibitor of factor Xa, such as an oligosaccharide, alone or in combination with an anti-platelet aggregation agent, is particularly beneficial for pathological conditions such as disorders of the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular system such as thromboembolic disorders associated with atherosclerosis or with diabetes such as unstable angina, cerebral attack, restenosis following angioplasty, endartemy or fitting of metallic endovascular prostheses or such as thromboembolic disorders associated with rethrombosis following thrombolysis, with infarction, with dementia of ischaemic origin, with peripheral arterial diseases, with haemodialysis, with atrial fibrillations or during the use of vascular prostheses or of aortocoronary bypasses, or for stable or unstable angina, or for patients treated by a revascularization procedure at risk of thrombosis including percutaneous angioplasties, endovascular prostheses, vascular prostheses, aortocoronary bypasses.<br>
In addition, the use of a direct selective inhibitor of factor Xa, such as DX-9065a or of an indirect selective inhibitor of factor Xa, such as an oligosaccharide, alone or in combination with the anti¬platelet aggregation agents, does not increase the haemorrhagic risk.<br>
The combination of a direct selective inhibitor of factor Xa, such as DX-9065a or of an indirect selective inhibitor of factor Xa, such as an oligosaccharide and of the anti-platelet aggregation agent may be formulated in pharmaceutical compositions which can be used by the oral or parenteral route, in particular by the subcutaneous route, in the form of a mixture with conventional pharmaceutical excipients.<br>
Thus, according to another of its features, the invention relates to the pharmaceutical compositions<br><br>
comprising one or more direct or indirect selective inhibitors of factor Xa acting via antithrombin III in combination with one or more compounds with anti-platelet aggregation activity, and optionally one or more pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles.<br>
The preferred pharmaceutical compositions of the invention comprise an antagonist of glycoprotein Ilb/IIIa as anti-platelet aggregation agent and methyl O-(2-deoxy-<br>
2-sulphoamino-6-O-sulfo-α-D-glucopyranosyl)- (1→4)-O-(P-D-<br>
glucopyranosyluronic acid- (1→4 ) -O-(2-deoxy-2-sulphoamino-<br>
3, 6-di-O-sulpho-α-D-glucopyranosyl-(1→4) -O-(2-O-sulpho-α-<br>
L-idopyranosyluronic acid)- (1→4) -2-deoxy-2-sulphoamino-6-<br>
O-sulpho-α-D-glucopyranoside whose anion has the structure (B)<br><br>
or one of its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, as indirect selective inhibitor of factor Xa.<br>
Another preferred group of pharmaceutical compositions consists of the compositions comprising<br>
methyl O-(2-deoxy-2-sulphoamino-6-O-sulfo-α-D-gluco-<br>
pyranosyl)- (1→4)-O-(p-D-glucopyranosyluronic acid-(1→4) -<br>
O-(2-deoxy-2-sulphoamino-3,6-di-O-sulpho-α-D-<br>
glucopyranosyl- (1→4) -O- (2-O-sulpho-α-L-idopyranosyluronic<br>
acid) - (1→4)-2-deoxy-2-sulphoamino-6-O-sulpho-α-D-gluco-pyranoside whose anion has the structure (B)<br><br>
or one of its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, as indirect selective inhibitor of factor Xa, and aspirin, as anti-platelet aggregation agent.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions which are the subject of the present invention are preferably provided in the form of dosage units containing a predetermined quantity of the active ingredients, as specified below. The unit forms for administration by the oral route<br><br>
comprise tablets, gelatin capsules, powders, granules, microgranules.<br>
The anti-platelet aggregation agent may be formulated according to methods well known to persons skilled in the art. The same applies to the selective inhibitor of factor Xa.<br>
In the formulation of the combinations of active ingredients for the preparation of the pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention, the nature of the active ingredients entering into the combination will be taken into account.<br>
Thus, when the selective inhibitor of factor Xa is an oligosaccharide, the latter is preferably used in the form of an addition salt in the composition, for example in the form of a sodium salt.<br>
Normally, the oligosaccharides in the form of their addition salts with pharmaceutically acceptable acids are not chemically incompatible with the nonsalifled anti-platelet aggregation agents. However, some of the latter are also used in the form of acid addition salts. In any case, it is preferable to keep the active ingredients separate according to techniques well known in the literature.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are particularly suitable in the treatment or prophylaxis of pathological conditions such as disorders of the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular system such as thromboembolic disorders associated with atherosclerosis or with diabetes such as unstable angina, cerebral attack, restenosis following angioplasty, endarterectomy or fitting of metallic endovascular prostheses, or such as thromboembolic disorders associated with rethrombosis following thrombolysis, with infarction, with dementia of ischaemic origin, with peripheral arterial diseases, with haemodialysis, with atrial fibrillations, or during the use of vascular prostheses, of aortocoronary bypasses or for stable or unstable angina, or for patients treated by a revascularization procedure at risk of thrombosis including percutaneous angioplasties, endovascular prostheses, vascular prostheses and aortocoronary bypasses.<br>
The combinations according to the invention may be formulated in pharmaceutical compositions for administration to mammals, including humans, for the treatment of the abovementioned diseases.<br><br>
The combinations according to the invention may be used at daily doses of the selective inhibitor of factor Xa or of the anti-platelet aggregation agent of 0.1 to 100 mg per kilo of body weight of the mammal to be treated.<br>
In human beings, the dose may vary for each of the components from 1 to 500 mg per day, according to the age of the subject to be treated and the type of treatment: prophylactic or curative. Preferably, the pentasaccharide is administered at doses of between 0.30 mg and 30 mg per patient and per day.<br>
In the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention, the active ingredients are generally formulated in dosage units containing from 0.1 to 50 mg of the said active ingredient per dosage unit.<br>
The compositions of the invention are prepared so as to be able to be administered by the digestive or parenteral route and are provided in various forms, such as for example of injectable or oral solutions, sugar-coated tablets, plain tablets or gelatin capsules. The injectable solutions are the preferred pharmaceutical forms.<br>
In the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention for oral, sublingual, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, transdermal, transmucosa, local or rectal administration, the active ingredient may be administered in unit forms for administration, in the form of a mixture with conventional pharmaceutical carriers, to animals and to human beings. The appropriate unit forms for administration comprise the forms to be administered by the oral route, such as tablets, gelatin capsules, powders, granules and oral solutions or suspensions, the forms for sublingual or buccal administration, the forms for subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intranasal or intraocular administration and the forms for rectal administration.<br>
When a solid composition in the form of tablets is prepared, the principal active ingredient is mixed with a pharmaceutical vehicle such as gelatin, starch, lactose, magnesium stearate, talc, gum arable and the like. The tablets may be coated with sucrose or other appropriate materials or they may be treated such that they have a prolonged or delayed activity and that they continuously release a predetermined quantity of active ingredient.<br><br>
A preparation of gelatin capsules is obtained by mixing the active ingredient with a diluent and by pouring the mixture obtained into soft or hard gelatin capsules.<br>
The water-dispersible powders or granules may contain the active ingredient in the form of a mixture with dispersing agents or wetting agents, or suspending agents, such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, as well as with sweeteners or with flavour correctors.<br>
For a rectal administration, suppositories are used which are prepared with binding agents which melt at the rectal temperature, for example cocoa butter or polyethylene glycols.<br>
For a parenteral, intranasal or intraocular administration, aqueous suspensions, isotonic saline solutions or sterile and injectable solutions are used which contain pharmacologically compatible dispersing agents and/or wetting agents, for example propylene glycol or butylene glycol.<br>
For transmucosa administration, the active ingredients may be formulated in the presence of a promoter such as a bile salt, a hydrophilic polymer such as for example hydropropylcellulose,<br>
hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, ethyl cellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, dextran, polyvinylpyrrolidone, pectins, starches, gelatin, casein, acrylic acids, acrylic esters and their copolymers, vinyl polymers or copolymers, vinyl alcohols, alkoxy polymers, polyethylene oxide polymers, polyethers or their mixture.<br>
The active ingredients may also be formulated in the form of microcapsules, optionally with one or more carriers or additives.<br>
The active ingredients may also be provided in the form of a complex with a cyclodextrin, for example<br>
α, β - or γ=-Cyclodextrin, 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin<br>
or methyl-p-cyclodextrin.<br>
One of the active ingredients, for example the oligosaccharide, inhibitor of factor Xa, may also be released by a balloon containing it and by an endovascular expander introduced into the blood vessels. The pharmacological efficacy of the active ingredient is thus not affected.<br>
Preferably, the selective inhibitor of factor Xa is administered by the intravenous or subcutaneous route.<br><br>
In the therapeutic combinations according to the present invention, the pharmaceutical forms preferably contain 8 to 30 mg of selective inhibitor of factor Xa and 10 to 200 mg of anti-platelet aggregation compound.<br>
The combination of 15 to 25 mg of selective inhibitor of factor Xa and of 10 to 30 mg of anti¬platelet aggregation agent is particularly advantageous. Better still, the pharmaceutical forms of the present invention comprise 20 mg of a pentasaccharide, selective inhibitor of factor Xa, and 20 mg of an anti-platelet aggregation agent.<br><br><br><br>
