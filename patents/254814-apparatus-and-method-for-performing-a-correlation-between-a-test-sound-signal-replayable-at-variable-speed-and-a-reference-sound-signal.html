Description<br>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and a method<br>
for performing a correlation between a test sound signal<br>
replayable at variable speed and a reference sound signal,<br>
in order to synchronize film events with image<br>
reproduction, for example.<br>
Audio video data are stored on data carriers, i.e. film or<br>
tape, or transmission channels, i.e. radio or telephone, in<br>
a fixed format, which does not allow an extension by novel<br>
audio formats or other synchronous or image synchronous,<br>
respectively, supplementary services, such as subtitles.<br>
Thus, with the introduction of, for example, new audio<br>
formats thus, new data carriers or film copies,<br>
respectively, have to be produced, which have the new audio<br>
formats.<br>
Fig. 8 shows an exemplary film 110. Film information, such<br>
as video information or images 112, respectively, which are<br>
also referred to as "frames" or "video frames", and audio<br>
information or a plurality of analog or digital soundtracks<br>
114, which have "audio frames" in the digital case is<br>
applied in spatial sequence or, during replay, in time<br>
sequence, respectively. Further, the film 110 has, for<br>
example, advance perforations 116, with the help of which<br>
the film is played.<br>
Basically, two methods are known for synchronizing<br>
supplements.<br>
The first method comprises storing a time code on the data<br>
carrier, such as with DTS (digital theatre system) for<br>
cinema sound or in an additional channel connected to the<br><br>
audio signal. Examples herefore are ancillary data by DAB<br>
and mp3. The time code is used to replay sound or<br>
additional information, respectively, synchronously from an<br>
external data carrier, for example CD with DTS. However, it<br>
is a disadvantage of this method that every additional<br>
format requires further space on the data carrier or<br>
transmission channel, respectively, which might not be<br>
available. With film, these are for example the tracks for<br>
analog sound, Dolby digital, DTS, SDDS (sony dynamic<br>
digital sound). However, proprietary formats avoid the<br>
utilization of the time code of one extension by other<br>
extensions. Mutual interferences of the extensions cannot<br>
always be avoided, one example is the usage of ancillary<br>
data in MP3 for additional information and bandwidth<br>
extension from different manufacturers.<br>
The second method is based on the improper use of analog<br>
soundtracks for storing time code, such as it is used for<br>
example in a prototype cinema equipped with an IOSONO<br>
system. However, it is a disadvantage of this method that<br>
the analog track exists in all systems and is often used as<br>
fallback solution during interferences of the other<br>
systems, which means a misuse of the analog track prevents<br>
the fallback possibility. Automatic switching to the analog<br>
track, which is installed in most cinemas, leads to the<br>
fact that the time code is replayed as analog signal when<br>
no signal is present on the "modern" tracks for Dolby<br>
digital or DTS, respectively. Thus, in the prototype<br>
cinema, during a pure wave-field synthesis reproduction,<br>
which will be discussed below, the redundant analog<br>
reproduction has to be switched off manually, because<br>
otherwise the time code can be heard via the redundant<br>
further loudspeakers.<br>
The acoustic wave-field synthesis, short WFS goes beyond<br>
the surround approaches of the formats Dolby, SDDS or DTS.<br>
In WFS, an attempt is made to reproduce the air vibrations<br>
of a real situation, which constitute sound, across a whole<br><br>
room. In contrary to conventional reproduction across two<br>
or more loudspeakers, where the mapping of the position of<br>
the original sound source is limited to a line between the<br>
loudspeakers, the wave-field synthesis is to transmit the<br>
whole sound field true to the original to the room. This<br>
means that the virtual sound sources can be exactly<br>
spatially localized, and even seem to exist within the<br>
room, and thus can be encircled. Systems with up to 200<br>
loudspeakers in cinema systems and up to 900 loudspeakers<br>
in theater sound systems have already been realized.<br>
Wave-field synthesis is based on the Huygens' principle,<br>
which says that every point on a wave front can be seen as<br>
starting point for an elmentary spherical wave. By<br>
interference of all elementary waves, a new wave front<br>
occurs, which is identical to the original wave.<br>
Such a sound system has been developed by Fraunhofer<br>
Institute for Digital Media Technology under the name<br>
IOSONO and is used in cinema of Ilmenau.<br>
Thus, the cinema of Ilmenau is mentioned as a practical<br>
example, where the wave-field synthesis is operated in two<br>
modes.<br>
In the first mode, the cinema is operated as "real" wave-<br>
field synthesis system, wherein the time code is stored on<br>
the analog track of the 35 mm film, such as has been<br>
discussed above with regard to the second "improper"<br>
method, where the WFS sound is played from an external<br>
medium, such as hard disk or DVD.<br>
In the second mode, "compatible reproduction", the sound<br>
stored in every 35 mm film is read out and decoded by a<br>
Dolby processor, alternatively, DTS or SDDS, respectively,<br>
could be used, wherein the Dolby processor, if necessary,<br>
switches automatically to the analog track and maps the<br><br>
occurring multi-channel signal via WFS to virtual<br>
loudspeakers.<br>
Since different signal paths are required for both modes, a<br>
division of the signal coming from the read head for the<br>
analog signal is required, which causes additional<br>
technological effort.<br>
Thus, in summary, it can be said that there is no room on<br>
current spools of cinema film to attach a further<br>
synchronization track, such as for external sound systems<br>
or subtitle systems. All cinema sound systems available up<br>
to now, analog and digital, obtain their soundtrack either<br>
directly via one or a plurality of soundtracks on the spool<br>
of film or by a manufacturer-specific time code signal on<br>
the spool of film. This means that for both known<br>
approaches, as explained above, new copies of the films<br>
have to be produced, usually with significant costs. Yet,<br>
audio formats like Dolby digital and SDDS allow modern<br>
audio experiences, but have still no time code for the<br>
synchronization of, for example, subtitles or foreign-<br>
language versions of the film sound recording.<br>
Hence, Frank Jordan and Jesper Dannow, in their publication<br>
"Generating Timecode Information from Analog Sources",<br>
118th Convention, Audio Engineering Society, of May 28 to<br>
31, 2005, in Barcelona, Spain, Convention Paper 6473,<br>
propose generating a time code on the basis of the analog<br>
sound track. The publication describes a system with the<br>
designation "Soundtitles", which is attached to the analog<br>
sound track of the projector. Based on an edited, digital<br>
copy of the sound track and the analog signal of the film<br>
projector, time information or a time code is determined by<br>
cross-correlation. The system "Soundtitles" consists of<br>
three components. The core module "Sync Tracker" generates<br>
the time code signal. The second module, the "Sync Player",<br>
generates subtitles projected with a beamer, for example.<br>
The third module, the "Clip Player" plays synchronized<br><br>
audio clips transmitted to the cinema visitor via wireless<br>
headphones.<br>
It is disadvantageous, however, in the "Sound Titles"<br>
system that no lip-sync can be produced, because there<br>
still remains a time offset of almost 100 ms. A time offset<br>
of about 100 ms between image and sound is, however,<br>
perceived as disturbing by the viewer.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide an<br>
improved concept for performing a correlation, in order to<br>
reduce the time delay between a video signal of a film and<br>
a sound signal not stored on the film or one or a plurality<br>
of other film events, for example, and in particular<br>
achieve lip-sync for a sound signal. This object is<br>
achieved by an apparatus for performing a correlation<br>
between a test sound signal and a reference sound signal<br>
according to claim 1, an apparatus for generating a control<br>
signal according to claim 20, a method for performing a<br>
correlation between a test sound signal and a reference<br>
sound signal according to claim 21, and a computer program<br>
according to claim 22.<br>
The present invention is based on the finding that a<br>
determination of a time shift between two signals produces<br>
an optimum correlation result by means of correlation if<br>
the two signals represent the same film portion by the same<br>
samples, for example. It is a prerequisite for this that<br>
both signals sample this portion with the same sampling<br>
rate or the ratios of sampling rate to replay speed of the<br>
digital image and the replayed films match.<br>
Hence, according to the invention, there is provided an<br>
apparatus for performing a correlation between a test sound<br>
signal replayable at variable speed and a reference sound<br>
signal, which is a digitally stored version of the test<br>
sound signal, comprising: a means for determining a measure<br>
for a test replay speed of a test sound signal, a means for<br><br>
varying a test sampling rate with which the test sound<br>
signal is sampled, in order to generate a modified test<br>
sound signal depending on the measure for the replay speed,<br>
or for varying a reference sampling rate of the digitally<br>
stored reference sound signal, in order to generate a<br>
modified reference sound signal depending on the measure<br>
for the replay speed, the means for varying being formed to<br>
vary the test sampling rate or the reference sampling rate<br>
so that a deviation between a test replay speed associated<br>
with the test sound signal or a reference replay speed<br>
associated with the modified reference sound signal is<br>
reduced, or that a deviation between a test replay speed<br>
associated with the modified test sound signal and a<br>
reference replay speed associated with the reference sound<br>
signal or that a deviation between a test replay speed<br>
associated with the modified test sound signal and a<br>
reference replay speed associated with a modified reference<br>
sound signal is reduced, and a means for comparing the<br>
modified test sound signal and the reference sound signal,<br>
or the test sound signal and the modified reference sound<br>
signal, or the modified test sound signal and the modified<br>
reference sound signal, in order to obtain a result of the<br>
correlation.<br>
For this reason, preferred embodiments are formed to<br>
correlate the test sound signal with three reference sound<br>
signals of different reference sampling rate and/or<br>
different sampling rate conversion, in order to determine a<br>
measure for the replay speed of the test sound signal<br>
and/or reduce the deviation of the replay speeds.<br>
The apparatus and the method for performing a correlation<br>
between a test sound signal and a reference sound signal<br>
may be employed in an apparatus for generating a control<br>
signal for a film event system synchronizing film events<br>
with image reproduction, for example as means for<br>
comparing. Examples for film events are the audio sound,<br>
subtitles and special effects, wherein special effects may<br><br>
include e.g. air flows, shaking at the cinema chairs,<br>
smells or light effects on side and back walls. With<br>
respect to the audio event, both different languages, such<br>
as simultaneous replay of the original version and of<br>
translations into other languages, and various audio<br>
techniques are possible here, such as the synchronization<br>
of digital surround systems, like the wave-field synthesis.<br>
Here, the apparatus or the method for performing the<br>
correlation particularly serves for synchronization and/or<br>
matching of a "replay speed" of the additional film events<br>
with the replay speed of the film.<br>
Even when the above-described and following examples talk<br>
of a cinemagoer or a film, the invention is not limited to<br>
cinema films for cinemagoers, but also relates generally to<br>
films or audio-visual signals, respectively, regardless<br>
whether these are film information stored on films or other<br>
data carriers and memory media, such as magnetic bands or<br>
hard drives. Additionally, the invention can also be used<br>
for pure sound systems without video, or for example, it<br>
can be used for the synchronization of pure video material,<br>
i.e. without sound, via video-ID, with arbitrary events.<br>

In the following description of the invention or the<br>
preferred embodiments, respectively, the same reference<br>
numbers are used for similar or equal elements.<br>
In the following, the invention will be discussed in more<br>
detail with regard to embodiments which use the sound<br>
signal applied to the film as film information. However,<br>
this is not to limit the invention but only serves for<br>
illustration purposes.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a basic block diagram of an apparatus for<br>
generating a control signal for a film event system and an<br>
exemplary film 110, as has been explained above with regard<br>
to Fig. 8, wherein the apparatus for generating a control<br>
signal comprises a means for storing 120 the film<br>
information, a means for receiving a section read from the<br>
film 140, a means 160 for comparing the read section with<br>
the stored film information 112, 114 and a means 180 for<br><br>
determining the control signal based on the comparison and<br>
the time scale.<br>
The stored video information 112, 114, comprises, for<br>
example, the sound or audio signals, respectively, the<br>
images or video signals, respectively, or also labels that<br>
can currently be found on films, and which determine, for<br>
example, where the aperture opens or from when on sound is<br>
played or when the film stops, respectively. The stored<br>
audio and/or video signals are, for example in digitized<br>
form, preferably in compressed form to reduce memory<br>
requirements.<br>
An advantage of the digitized storage is the simple and<br>
particularly error-free reproducibility of the stored image<br>
of the film information.<br>
In contrary to conventional systems, the film remains<br>
unchanged, as above-described, a stored image of the film<br>
information is generated only once, e.g. when producing the<br>
film.<br>
When replaying the film via a film replay device, such as a<br>
film projector, for example, the sound signal contained on<br>
the soundtrack 114 is received by the means 140 for<br>
receiving and edited for the means 160 for comparing,<br>
sampled, for example, with a given sample rate and passed<br>
on as section of a given length or a given number of sample<br>
rates, respectively.<br>
The means 160 is formed to compare this section read from<br>
the film with the stored film information, wherein the<br>
means 160 for comparing can be formed to compare the read<br>
section with the entire stored information, preferably,<br>
however, to compare the read section with a section of the<br>
stored film information to minimize the computing effort.<br>
The comparison can be made, for example, via<br>
crosscorrelation but also via calculating the difference,<br><br>
e.g. by calculating a compressed hash sum and searching the<br>
same in a database. The comparison can be based on the<br>
sound signal alone, the video signal alone, a comparison of<br>
the sound signal and the video signal as well as a<br>
combination with an evaluation of the above-mentioned<br>
features. Based on the result of the comparison of the<br>
means for comparing 160 and the time scale, the means 180<br>
for determining determines the control signal 190. A film<br>
event system is controlled via the control signal 190,<br>
which generates, for example, WFS sound signals or<br>
subtitles based on the control signal 190 time<br>
synchronously to the replayed film 110. Thereby, the<br>
apparatus for generating a control signal or specifically<br>
the means for determining the control signal 180 can be<br>
formed such that the control signal is any time code<br>
format, proprietary or standardized such as the LTC time<br>
code format (LTC = longitudinal time code) standardized<br>
according to SMPTE (Society of Motion Picture and<br>
Television Engineers).<br>
Time-synchronous means that the film event system<br>
generates, based on the control signal 190, a simultaneous<br>
event corresponding to the time on the time scale of a<br>
position of the film just replayed, to which a time on the<br>
time scale is associated in the stored film information.<br>
Thereby, differing from the explained embodiment, instead<br>
of the film projector, any film replay device can be used,<br>
any film formats, such as silent films (e.g. with<br>
synchronization based on video information), films with<br>
analog or digital soundtrack, one soundtrack or several<br>
parallel soundtracks can be used, or as an alternative to a<br>
film, any other memory media can be used, such as tapes or<br>
hard drives, whose format can not or must not be changed,<br>
for example to be compatible to the film replay device in<br>
future, to which, however, other film events are to be<br>
synchronized at the same time.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment, the sound signal is used as film<br>
information for the synchronization. Thereby, the section<br>
read from the film is sampled with a given sample rate,<br>
which will be referred to below as test sample rate, to<br>
generate a test sound signal, and the stored film<br>
information is stored in digital form, wherein the stored<br>
film information will be referred to below as reference<br>
signal, and the test sound signal and the reference sound<br>
signal are compared in the means 160 for comparing via<br>
crosscorrelation.<br>
In one embodiment, the test signal sample rate and the<br>
reference signal sample rate are invariable, i.e. constant.<br>
The means 160 for comparing can, for example, be formed to<br>
generate a first correlation result at a first time based<br>
on a first test sound signal and a first reference sound<br>
signal, to determine a first time of the time scale, and to<br>
generate a second correlation result at a second time based<br>
on a second test sound signal and a second reference sound<br>
signal to determine a second time of the time scale for<br>
determining, for example, a time difference or replay<br>
speed, respectively, or for determining a speed difference<br>
in comparison with a target or reference replay speed.<br>
Based thereon, the means 180 for determining determines the<br>
control signal for synchronizing, for example, the film<br>
event system.<br>
However, it is a disadvantage of a constant sample rate<br>
that the correlation result decreases with varying test<br>
replay speed, and thus the accuracy of determining the time<br>
or position in the film becomes more inaccurate and thus<br>
the synchronization decreases. This disadvantage can be<br>
compensated by varying of the sample rates, which means the<br>
test sample rate and/or the reference sample rate.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a basic block diagram of an apparatus for<br>
performing a correlation between a test sound signal that<br>
can be played with a variable replay speed, and a reference<br><br>
sound signal, which is a digitally stored version of the<br>
test sound signal, wherein the apparatus for performing a<br>
correlation comprises a means 210 for determining a measure<br>
for a test replay speed, a means 230 for varying a test<br>
sample rate or a reference sample rate and a means 250 for<br>
comparing. The means 230 is formed to vary a test sample<br>
rate, by which the test sound signal 270 is sampled, to<br>
generate the modified test signal 272 or to vary a<br>
reference sample rate to generate a modified reference<br>
sound signal based on the reference sound signal 274.<br>
Further, the means 230 for varying is formed to vary the<br>
test sample rate or a reference sample rate such that a<br>
deviation between a test replay speed associated to the<br>
test sound signal or reference replay speed associated to<br>
the modified reference sound signal 276 is reduced, or that<br>
a deviation between a test replay speed associated to the<br>
modified test sound signal 272 and a reference replay speed<br>
associated to the reference sound signal 274, or that a<br>
deviation between a test replay speed associated to the<br>
modified test sound signal 272 and a reference replay speed<br>
associated to the modified reference sound signal 276 is<br>
reduced, wherein the term replay speed or the problem of a<br>
variable replay speed, respectively, will be discussed<br>
below in more detail.<br>
The means 250 for comparing the modified sound signal 272<br>
and the reference sound signal 274, or the test sound<br>
signal 270 and the modified reference sound signal 276, or<br>
the modified test sound signal 272 and the modified<br>
reference sound signal 276 is formed to determine a result<br>
278 of the correlation.<br>
The embodiment of the apparatus for performing a<br>
correlation shown in Fig. 2a can, for example, be used as a<br>
means 160 for comparing in an apparatus for generating a<br>
control signal for a film event system, such as shown, for<br>
example, in Fig. 1.<br><br>
Fig. 2b shows a basic block diagram of a preferred<br>
embodiment of an apparatus for performing a correlation<br>
between a test sound signal and a reference sound signal.<br>
Fig. 2b shows a means 280 for storing a reference sound<br>
signal 274, which is a digital version of the test sound<br>
signal 270, wherein the reference sound signal 274 has been<br>
generated once based on a given memory reference replay<br>
speed and memory reference sample rate.<br>
The test sound signal is replayed with a variable test<br>
replay speed and sampled with a test sample rate to<br>
generate the test sound signal 270.<br>
The means 210 for determining the measure for the test<br>
replay speed of the test sound signal 270 controls the<br>
means 230 for varying based on the measure for the test<br>
replay speed. The means 230 for varying controls a<br>
reference or sample rate converter 232 and a variable<br>
sampler 234, wherein the. sample rate converter 232 is<br>
formed to convert a reference sound signal based on the<br>
memory reference replay speed and the memory reference<br>
sample rate into a modified reference sound signal 276<br>
corresponding to a reference sound signal based on a<br>
different memory reference sample speed and/or memory<br>
reference sample rate, and wherein the variable sampler 234<br>
is formed to sample the test sound signal with a varied<br>
sample rate differing from the standard or basic sample<br>
rate, to generate a modified test sound signal 272.<br>
Differing from Fig. 2b, the apparatus for performing a<br>
correlation can also be formed such that the test sound<br>
signal 270 is always supplied to the means 250 for<br>
comparing via the variable sampler 234, wherein the<br>
variable sampler 234 is then formed such that one of the<br>
variable test sample rates corresponds to the standard or<br>
basic sample rate, and is further formed such that the<br>
reference sound signal 274 is always supplied to the means<br><br>
250 for comparing via the reference sample rate converter<br>
232, wherein the reference sample rate converter 232 is<br>
formed such that it passes the reference sound signal 274<br>
in an unmodified way to the means 250 for comparing with<br>
respective control by the means 230 for varying.<br>
The representation of the separate supply of the test sound<br>
signal 270 compared to the modified test sound signal 272<br>
and the reference sound signal compared to the modified<br>
reference sound signal 276 to the means 250 for comparing<br>
selected in Fig. 2b serves to illustrate the alternative<br>
embodiments or realization possibilities.<br>
Thus, for example, in one embodiment where the means 250<br>
for comparing is formed to compare the modified test sound<br>
signal 272 with the non-modified reference sound signal<br>
274, no reference sample rate converter 234 is required, or<br>
the apparatus for performing a correlation according to<br>
Fig. 2b has no reference sample rate converter 232,<br>
respectively. In the same way, a means 250 for comparing,<br>
which is formed to compare the unmodified test sound signal<br>
270 to the modified reference sound signal 246, has no<br>
variable sampler 234.<br>
In a further embodiment, the means 280 for storing is a<br>
means for storing film information, wherein a time scale is<br>
associated to the stored film information, and the test<br>
sound signal 270 is, for example., a film sound signal. The<br>
apparatus for performing a correlation according to Fig. 2b<br>
can then, for example, be used as means for comparing 160<br>
according to Fig. 1.<br>
Fig. 2c.1 shows a section of an exemplary film 110 with a<br>
soundtrack 114 as described above in Fig. 1. In Fig. 2c.1,<br>
two positions of the film 110 are indicated, a first<br>
position, further referred to as position L1., and a second<br>
position, further referred to as position L2. The two<br><br>
positions L1 and L2 define a section on the film 110 having<br>
a length of ΔL = L1 - L2.<br>
Fig. 2c.2 shows an exemplary curve of the test sound signal<br>
associated to the section between the position L1 and L2<br>
described in Fig. 2c.1, wherein further the time, when the<br>
position L1 of the film is played, is referred to as time<br>
T1, and the time when the position L2 of the film is played<br>
is referred to as time T2. The time period ΔT = T1 - T2<br>
depends on the length of the respective section and the<br>
replay speed v of the film. The following applies:<br>
ΔT = ΔL / v or<br>
T2 - T1 = (L2 - L1) / v, respectively.<br>
When sampling the test sound signal with the sample rate f<br>
= 1 /At, wherein At is the sample period and ΔT = n • AT,<br>
the test sound signal can be illustrated as a sequence of n<br>
+ 1 samples, as indicated exemplarily in Fig. 2c.2 with n =<br>
10.<br>
When replaying the film with a replay speed v and a sample<br>
rate f = 1 / At, the section of the film between L1 and L2<br>
or T1 an T2,respectively, is divided, for example, in n<br>
time periods, or represented by n + 1 samples,<br>
respectively. The following applies:<br>
n = ΔL / (At . v) or<br>
n = ΔL . f / v, respectively.<br>
This means the number of sample periods or samples,<br>
respectively, for a given section of the film AL is<br>
proportional to the sample rate f or antiproportional to<br>
the sample period At, respectively, and antiproportional to<br>
the replay speed v. In other words, in a section of<br>
constant length ΔL, the quotient "f / v" or the product "Δt<br>
• v", respectively, has to be constant, when n or the<br>
number of samples n+1 is to be constant.<br><br>
In that case, if the first sample is equal, the individual<br>
samples are also equal under the above-mentioned condition.<br>
Correspondingly, when generating the stored film<br>
information or the reference sound signal, respectively, in<br>
a memory sample rate fmemory and a memory replay speed vmemory,<br>
the stored section of the film information or the test<br>
sound signal, respectively, is represented, for example, by<br>
nmemory + 1 reference samples and stored.<br>
For illustrating the facts, Figs. 2c.2 to 2c.4 show<br>
exemplary samples or storages of the film section between<br>
the position L1 and L2 for a constant sample rate f or a<br>
constant sample period At, respectively, and a variable<br>
sample speed, wherein Fig. 2.c2 shows an exemplary sampling<br>
or storing for a first replay speed v1, Fig. 2c.3 shows a<br>
sampling or storing the same section of the film with a<br>
second replay speed v2, and Fig. 2c.4 shows sampling of the<br>
same section of the film for a third sample speed v3.<br>
Thereby, in this example, v1 is half the size of v2 and<br>
twice the size of v3: V1 = v2 /2 and v1 = 2 • v3.<br>
All three sound signals illustrated in Figs. 2c. 2 to 2c.4<br>
have the same sample at the position L1 or at the<br>
corresponding time T1, respectively. Thus, correspondingly,<br>
as illustrated exemplarily in Figs. 2c.2 to 2c.4, the<br>
stored image information or the reference sound signal in<br>
Fig. 2c.2 is represented by n1 + 1 = 11 samples, in Fig.<br>
2c.3 the same section of the film is represented by n2 + 1<br>
= 6 samples and in Fig. 2c. 4 the same section of film is<br>
represented by n3 + 1 = 21 samples.<br>
As can be seen in Figs. 2c. 2 to 2c. 4, with a constant<br>
sample rate, an increase of the replay speed v corresponds<br>
to a time compression of the sound signal, i.e. a doubling<br>
of the replay speed v1 of Fig. 2c.2 leads, as indicated in<br>
Fig. 2c.3 to halving T2 - T1 and n, and a reduction of the<br><br>
replay speed v to a time extension of the sound signal,<br>
i.e. halving the replay speed v1 of Fig. 2c. 2 leads to<br>
doubling T2 - T1 and n, as indicated in Fig. 2c. 4.<br>
Figs. 2d.l and 2d.2 correspond merely to Fig. 2c. 1 and<br>
2c.2. Compared to Fig. 2c.1, Fig. 2d.l shows two additional<br>
positions defining a search section or a search window with<br>
regard to the film and the film information applied<br>
thereon, wherein a first position of the search window is<br>
indicated by L0 and a second position of the search window<br>
is indicated by L3, wherein the section between the<br>
position L0 and the position L3 is greater than the section<br>
defined by positions L1 and L2, or ΔLwindow &gt; ΔL with ΔLwind0W<br>
= L3 - L0 and ΔL = L2 - L1 applies. Correspondingly, in Fig.<br>
2d.2, additionally to Fig. 2c.2, the time T0 representing<br>
the time associated to the position L0 based on the given<br>
replay speed, and the time t3 representing the time<br>
associated to the position L3 based on the given sample<br>
replay speed were added.<br>
In relation to the generation of the stored film<br>
information or the reference sound signal and additionally<br>
stored time scale, respectively, this means that T0<br>
defines, for example, the time on the time scale associated<br>
to the position L0, the time T1 defines the time on the<br>
time scale associated to the position L1, the time T2<br>
defines the time on the time scale associated to the<br>
position L2, and the time t3 defines the time on the time<br>
scale associated to the position L3 on the film.<br>
Fig. 2d.3 corresponds to Fig. 2c.2.<br>
In the following, with regard to Figs. 2d. 2	to 2d. 4, a<br>
basic curve of a comparison of two signals via	correlation<br>
or the problematic of a variable replay	speed when<br>
comparing two signals, respectively, will be	exemplarily<br>
represented and discussed.<br><br>
Thereby, Fig. 2d.3 illustrates currently read film<br>
information applied to the film or the test sound signal<br>
270, respectively, and Fig. 2d.2 stored film information or<br>
a reference sound signal, respectively, wherein in an<br>
optimum case, which is represented by Fig. 2d. 2 and Fig.<br>
2d. 3, the memory replay speed and the memory sample rate<br>
with which the reference sound signal has been generated,<br>
correspond to the replay speed of the test sound signal and<br>
the sample rate of the test sound signal or as above<br>
mentioned, the quotient of memory sample rate fmemory and<br>
memory replay speed vmemory corresponds to the quotient of<br>
sample rate for the test sound signal f and replay speed of<br>
the test sound signal v, respectively. In that case, the<br>
reference sound signal or a section of the reference sound<br>
signal defined by T1 and T2, respectively, can correspond<br>
exactly to the test sound signal representing the section<br>
between T1 and T2, more precisely, their sample sequences,<br>
and a definite local maximum or a correlation peak can be<br>
gained via correlation, as illustrated exemplarily in Fig.<br>
2d.4.<br>
The position of the peak indicates the time shift of the<br>
test sound signal in relation to the reference sound signal<br>
or the search window, respectively. Based thereon, the<br>
current time can be determined with regard to the stored<br>
time scale.<br>
In contrary to Figs. 2d.l to 2d.4, Figs. 2d.5 to 2d.8 show<br>
an example where the replay speed of the test sound signal<br>
indicated in Fig. 2d. 7 is reduced compared to the replay<br>
speed of the test sound signal as indicated in Fig. 2d.2.<br>
Fig. 2d. 5 corresponds to Fig. 2d.l. Fig. 2d. 6 corresponds<br>
to Fig. 2d.2, that means Fig. 2d.6 represents an exemplary<br>
curve of a reference sound signal based on a memory sample<br>
rate fmemory and a memory sample speed vraemory. Fig. 2d. 7 shows<br>
an exemplary curve or an exemplary sample of the test sound<br>
signal, based on a test sample rate f unaltered in relation<br><br>
to 2d.3 or Fig. 2d.6, respectively, but an altered reduced<br>
replay speed v' of the test sound signal.<br>
Relating to a time period AT under consideration, this<br>
means that in the same time period AT with reduced speed v'<br>
only a smaller section or a section of less length AL'<br>
according to AL' = v' ΔT of the film is replayed, so that<br>
relating to the just played film after the time period A'<br>
only one position L'2 prior to the position L2 is reached,<br>
as illustrated in Fig. 2d.5. Relating to the reference<br>
sound signal and the time scale associated thereto, the<br>
time T'2 of the time scale is associated to the position<br>
L'2, as indicated in Fig. 2d.7.<br>
Relating to the individual samples of the test sound<br>
signal, this means that the "spatial" curve of the test<br>
sound signal predetermined by the soundtrack of the film is<br>
invariable, so that with lower replay speed, v' corresponds<br>
to a sample period At or a corresponding spatial sample<br>
section Δ1', respectively, which is smaller than A1, so<br>
that, as indicated in Fig. 2d.7 compared to Fig. 2d.6, the<br>
samples of the test sound signal "migrate" towards the left<br>
with regard to the "spatial" signal curve.<br>
In the opposite case where the altered replay speed v' is<br>
greater than the memory replay speed vmemory, the opposite<br>
case occurs, where in the same time period Δt a longer<br>
spatial section Δ1 is played, so that the samples of the<br>
test sound signals "migrate" towards the "right" on the<br>
signal curve in the "spatial" curve of the test sound<br>
signal.<br>
Thus, with an altered replay speed, regardless whether it<br>
is higher or lower than the memory replay speed, the result<br>
of the comparison decreases, since even with otherwise<br>
optimum conditions, the test sound signal and the reference<br>
sound signal reproduce two different spatial sections of<br>
the film. The result of the comparison becomes the worse<br><br>
the more the memory replay speed deviates from the test<br>
replay speed. When comparing by correlation, the amount of<br>
the local maximum or peak decreases and the maximum itself<br>
becomes broader and flatter, so that the time determination<br>
with regard to the time scale becomes more and more inexact<br>
until it is no longer possible.<br>
Under real conditions, the replay speed of the test sound<br>
signal varies, for example, not only between different film<br>
projectors but can also vary during a film. Thus, accurate<br>
retuning is essential to ensure synchronism during the<br>
whole film.<br>
Thus, the apparatus for performing a correlation varies the<br>
sample rate of the test sound signal or the sample rate of<br>
the reference sound signal to minimize the adverse effect<br>
of a variable replay speed of the test sound signal as<br>
described above according to the above-described condition<br>
that the quotient of sample rate and replay speed of the<br>
test sound signal and the reference sound signal have to be<br>
the same in order to represent the same section of the film<br>
with the same samples.<br>
In a digital reference sound signal that has been generated<br>
before with a memory sample rate, the change of replay<br>
speed is effected by sample rate conversion, wherein the<br>
stored reference sound signal 274 is, for example,<br>
correspondingly interpolated to generate a reference sound<br>
signal with the sample rate corresponding to the altered<br>
replay speed.<br>
Figs. 2d.l - 2d.8 represent simplified examples, where it<br>
has been assumed for clarity reasons that the memory replay<br>
speed vmemory corresponds to a normal or common replay speed<br>
of a player for generating a test sound signal. As<br>
explained above, however, the quotient of sample rate f and<br>
replay speed v is the amount that has to be same for the<br>
reference sound signal and the test sound signal, in order<br><br>
to be able to represent the same section of the film with<br>
the same samples, as discussed above. For example, when<br>
generating the reference sound signal, double replay speed<br>
can be used when the sample rate is doubled at the same<br>
time.<br>
In an embodiment according to Fig. 2b the means 210 for<br>
determining can determine a measure for the test replay<br>
speed based on the result 278 of the correlation.<br>
One approach is to use a single correlation result for the<br>
determination of a measure of the replay speed by<br>
comparing, for example, an amplitude of a peak with a given<br>
threshold to determine whether a deviation between a replay<br>
speed of a test sound signal and a reference sound signal<br>
lies within in a given range.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, at least two different reference<br>
sound signals based on different reference sample rates or<br>
corresponding to different reference replay speeds,<br>
respectively, are compared to the test sound signal to<br>
compare the results of the correlation, for example, via<br>
quality evaluation, which is discussed in more detail with<br>
reference to Fig. 5 in order to determine from the same a<br>
most similar reference sound signal and thus a measure for<br>
the replay speed of the test sound signal based on the<br>
known sample rate and the known memory replay speed.<br>
Thereby, the different reference sound signals can be<br>
formed successively and compared to the test sound signal<br>
or can be formed and compared simultaneously.<br>
A particularly preferred embodiment of the apparatus for<br>
performing a correlation generates three reference sound<br>
signals based on different reference sample rates, wherein<br>
the reference sound signal of the medium of the three<br>
sample rates is based on the reference sample rate of the<br>
reference sound signal which had the best quality or<br>
maximum match with the test sound signal, respectively, in<br><br>
a previous comparison and wherein the two other reference<br>
sound signals have each a reference sample rate, which is<br>
higher or lower than the reference sample rate of the<br>
medium reference sound signal or reference sample rate,<br>
respectively. This is controlled by the means 230 for<br>
varying based on an output signal of the means 210 for<br>
determining the measure for the test replay speed. Thus, it<br>
is ensured that the reference sample rate or the reference<br>
replay speed of the reference sound signal, respectively,<br>
is adapted to the replay speed or reference sample rate of<br>
the test sound signal, respectively.<br>
Fig. 3a shows an exemplary film as illustrated in Fig. 8<br>
and a basic block diagram of an apparatus for determining a<br>
position in the film.<br>
The embodiment of the apparatus for determining a position<br>
in a film shown in Fig. 3a can, for example, be used in an<br>
apparatus for generating a control signal for a film event<br>
system, as shown, for example, in Fig. 1, as means 180 for<br>
determining the control signal.<br>
The apparatus for determining a position in a film<br>
comprises a memory 320 for storing a reference fingerprint<br>
representation of the film information, wherein the<br>
fingerprint representation is formed such that a time curve<br>
of the fingerprint representation depends on a time curve<br>
of the film information, and wherein a time scale is<br>
associated to a stored reference fingerprint<br>
representation, a means 340 for receiving a section read<br>
from the film, a means 350 for extracting a test<br>
fingerprint representation from the read-in section and a<br>
means 360 for comparing the test fingerprint representation<br>
to the reference fingerprint representation to determine<br>
the position in the film based on the comparison and the<br>
time scale.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment, the fingerprint representation<br>
comprises a representation in form of a spectral flatness,<br>
wherein a time curve of the fingerprint representation<br>
comprises a time curve of the spectral flatness.<br>
Fig. 3b. 1 shows an exemplary film 110, as illustrated in<br>
Fig. 8. Thus, during playing the film with a given replay<br>
speed, for example, the time T100 of the time scale<br>
corresponds to a position L100 of the film, the time T103 of<br>
the time scale to a position L103, the time T113 of the time<br>
scale to a position L113 and the time T116 of the time scale<br>
to a position L116.<br>
In the step of generating the reference fingerprint<br>
representation of the film information, in one embodiment,<br>
a fingerprint is determined for certain spatial or time<br>
portions of the film, respectively.<br>
Fig. 3b. 2 shows, for example, a first section comprising<br>
the section from the position L100 to L113 or T100 to T113,<br>
respectively, and a second section comprising the section<br>
from the position L103 to the position L113 or from the time<br>
T103 to the time T116, respectively. Based on these sections,<br>
a fingerprint associated to the section is generated based<br>
on, for example, spectral analysis, Fourier transformation<br>
or other methods of feature extraction. In a particularly<br>
preferred embodiment, the fingerprint comprises the<br>
spectral flatness yx2, which is calculated from the curve of<br>
the power density spectrum, so that the value of the<br>
spectral flatness is determined for every section, and a<br>
sequence of spectral flatnesses results in dependence on<br>
the time curve of the film information, for example the<br>
sound signal, which is stored in the memory 320 with the<br>
associated time scale.<br>
Sample rate, length or duration of the section,<br>
respectively, or the distance between two subsequent<br>
sections are determined according to the requirements, for<br><br>
example, with regard to uniqueness or accuracy of the<br>
determination of the position in the film. The longer the<br>
section the clearer the specification of the feature in<br>
general, the higher the sample rate and/or the smaller the<br>
distance between two sections the more accurately the<br>
position in the film can be determined. The higher the<br>
sample rate the longer the sections and the lower the<br>
distances between the sections, the higher the memory<br>
requirement for the reference signal or the requirements of<br>
computing power signal processing.<br>
A significant advantage of the fingerprint representation<br>
in form of spectral flatness is its lower memory<br>
requirement compared to, for example, a complete storage of<br>
the power density spectrum for an equal section.<br>
Preferably, a curve or sequence of spectral flatnesses,<br>
respectively, is used as fingerprint for a section.<br>
Fig. 4a shows an exemplary film 110, as indicated in Fig.<br>
8, as well as an apparatus for determining a position in a<br>
film having film information applied in a time sequence.<br>
The embodiment of the apparatus for determining a position<br>
in a film shown in Fig. 4a can, for example, be used in an<br>
apparatus for generating a control signal for a film event<br>
system such as shown in Fig. 1, as a means 180 for<br>
determining the control signal.<br>
The apparatus for determining a position has a memory 420<br>
for storing film information applied to a film in time<br>
sequence, wherein a time scale is associated to the stored<br>
film information, a means 440 for receiving a section read<br>
from the film and a synchronization means 460, which is<br>
formed to compare a sequence of samples of the read<br>
portions based on a first sample rate and a first search<br>
window of the stored film information to obtain a coarse<br>
result and to compare a sequence of samples of the read<br>
section based on a second sample rate and a second search<br><br>
window of the stored film information to obtain a fine<br>
result pointing to the position of the film, wherein a<br>
position of the second search window in the stored film<br>
information depends on the coarse result, and wherein the<br>
first search window is longer in time than the second<br>
search window and wherein further the first sample rate is<br>
lower than the second sample rate.<br>
Fig. 5a shows an exemplary film 110, as indicated in Fig.<br>
8, as well as a preferred embodiment of an apparatus for<br>
generating a control signal for a film event system, which<br>
is formed to determine the control signal based on an<br>
analog soundtrack applied to the film of a section of the<br>
audio signal or test sound signal, respectively, read from<br>
the film, and a stored digital version of the test sound<br>
signal, referred to as reference sound signal below, to<br>
which a time scale is associated, by comparing the test<br>
sound signal and the reference sound signal via the time<br>
scale.<br>
Fig. 5a shows a preferred embodiment of an apparatus for<br>
generating a control signal for a film event system having<br>
a first film sound sampler 542, which is connected to a<br>
first A/D converter 544 (A/D = analog/digital), wherein the<br>
first A/D converter 544 is connected to a first feature<br>
extractor 552, a first means 562 for correlation with a<br>
first reference sound signal based on a first sample rate,<br>
with a second means 564 for correlation with a second<br>
reference sound signal based on a second sample rate, and a<br>
third means 566 for correlation with a third reference<br>
sound signal based on a third sample rate. An input of the<br>
first means 562 for correlation, an input of the second<br>
means 564 for correlation, and an input of the third means<br>
566 for correlation are connected to an output of a sample<br>
rate converter (SRC) 232.<br>
An output of the first means 562 for correlation, an output<br>
of the second means 564 for correlation and an output of<br><br>
the third means 566 for correlation are connected to an<br>
input of a first means 568 for quality evaluation. The<br>
means 568 for quality evaluation again is coupled to the<br>
sample rate converter 232 and a means 570 for sampler<br>
selection, wherein an output of the means 570 for sampler<br>
selection is connected to an input of a timer 582. The<br>
timer 582 again is connected to the stored soundtrack or a<br>
means 522 for storing the soundtrack, respectively, wherein<br>
an output of the means 522 for storing the soundtrack is<br>
connected to an input of the sample rate converter 232.<br>
An output of the first feature extractor 552 is connected<br>
to an input of means 554 for comparing a feature having,<br>
for example, a feature classificator and a database of<br>
features, wherein an output of the means 554 for comparing<br>
a feature is connected to an input of the timer 582.<br>
An output of the timer 582 is coupled to an input of a<br>
means 584 for time code generation, which has a time code<br>
database or is coupled to a time code database, wherein<br>
further an output of the means 584 for time code generation<br>
is connected to an input of means 586 for time code<br>
smoothing, wherein the means 586 for time code smoothing is<br>
further formed to output a time code 592, wherein further<br>
an output of the means 586 for time code smoothing is<br>
connected to an input of a word clock generator 588, which<br>
is further formed to output a word clock signal 594.<br>
Optionally, the apparatus for generating a control signal<br>
for a film event system further has a second film sound<br>
sampler 542' , which is connected to a second A/D converter<br>
544', wherein the second A/D converter 544' is connected to<br>
a second feature extractor 552', to a fourth means 562' for<br>
correlation with a fourth reference sound signal based on a<br>
first sample rate, to a fifth means 564' for correlation<br>
with a fifth reference sound signal based on a second<br>
sample rate and to a sixth means 566' for correlation with<br><br>
a sixth reference sound signal based on the third sample<br>
rate.<br>
An output of the fourth means 562' for correlation, an<br>
output of the fifth means 564' for correlation and an<br>
output of the sixth means 566' for correlation are<br>
connected to an input of a second means 568' for quality<br>
evaluation, wherein an output of the second means 568' for<br>
quality evaluation is connected to an offset compensation<br>
569 and a further output to an input of the sample rate<br>
converter 232, and wherein further the means for offset<br>
compensation 569 is connected to the sampler selection 570.<br>
Thereby, the first film sound sampler 542, also referred to<br>
as main sampler, is positioned such that the apparatus for<br>
generating a control signal has enough time to synchronize.<br>
Thus, the first film sound sampler 542 provides a<br>
predelayed signal. At the time of synchronization, the<br>
correlation window width or width of the section of the<br>
test sound signal is added. Based on the perforations on<br>
the spool of film, the time difference for the predelay can<br>
be adjusted accurately. Three seconds are recommended as<br>
first basis.<br>
Below, the mode of operation of the embodiment of the<br>
apparatus for generating a control signal for the film<br>
event system will be discussed in more detail, wherein the<br>
principle will be discussed based on the test sound signal<br>
generated by the first film sound sampler 542 or its signal<br>
processing chain, respectively, since the second optional<br>
signal processing chain or signal processing of the test<br>
sound signal generated by the second film sound sampler<br>
542', respectively, corresponds to the first and thus<br>
merely the means 569 for offset compensation will be<br>
discussed in detail.<br>
The first film sound sampler 542 reads the sound signal<br>
from the soundtrack of the film or samples the sound signal<br><br>
from the soundtrack of the film, respectively, and passes<br>
this signal on to the first A/D converter 544, wherein the<br>
first A/D converter 544 is formed to generate a digital<br>
audio signal or test sound signal based on the sample rate<br>
of the first film sound sampler 542 and the replay speed of<br>
the film from which the soundtrack or film information,<br>
respectively, is read.<br>
Based on the test sound signal 270, one or a plurality of<br>
features is extracted or a test fingerprint representation<br>
is formed, respectively. For the feature extraction or<br>
fingerprint representation, respectively, for example the<br>
spectral flatness is used as feature or fingerprint,<br>
respectively. The test fingerprint representation is then<br>
compared to a reference fingerprint representation by the<br>
means 544 for comparing a feature or a fingerprint<br>
representation, respectively, wherein, as mentioned above,<br>
the fingerprint representation is formed such that a time<br>
curve of the fingerprint representation depends on a time<br>
curve of the film information, and wherein a time scale is<br>
associated to a reference fingerprint representation stored<br>
in a means 544 for comparing a feature, and a means 554 for<br>
comparing is formed to determine a position in the film or<br>
to generate a time code signal 544Z, respectively, based on<br>
the comparison of the test fingerprint representation with<br>
the reference fingerprint representation and the time<br>
scale.<br>
Based on the stored reference sound signal 274, the sample<br>
rate converter generates the same signal with slightly<br>
different sample rates, i.e. modified reference sound<br>
signals for the correlations to be calculated in parallel.<br>
Thereby, the case that a modified reference sound signal<br>
has the same sample rate as the original reference sound<br>
signal, is included, so that for the discussion of Fig. 5<br>
below generally the term reference sound signals is used.<br><br>
In other words, the sample rate converter 232 generates<br>
three reference sound signals 276 or modified reference<br>
sound signal 276, respectively, wherein a first reference<br>
sound signal is based on a first sample rate and supplied<br>
to the first means 562 for correlation, wherein a second<br>
reference sound signal 276 is based on a second sample rate<br>
and supplied to the second means 564 for correlation, and<br>
the third reference sound signal 276 is based on a third<br>
sample rate and supplied to a third means 566 for<br>
correlation. The sample rate converter 232 provides<br>
slightly stepped signals, with different sample rates, to<br>
the correlation or the means 562, 564, 566 for correlation,<br>
respectively, wherein the sample rate is always adjusted in<br>
dependence on the previously measured maximum peak to noise<br>
value from the correlation. One correlation each receives<br>
the modified reference sound signal with this sample rate,<br>
a further correlation receives a further slightly lower<br>
one, which is one step lower, and a further correlation<br>
receives a slightly higher stepped sample rate. Thereby, it<br>
is ensured that the sample rate converter can tune or<br>
synchronize, respectively, to a speed change of the analog<br>
sound signal.<br>
The means 522 for storing the soundtrack and the sample<br>
rate converter 232 are preferably formed to use a window<br>
width of 2n, to calculate large calculation windows via<br>
fast Fourier transformation (FFT) with little effort. More<br>
than three correlations can be calculated in parallel to<br>
compensate for sudden jumps in the sound check. The<br>
correlation window is selected large to obtain a<br>
significant correlation peak. To obtain the detection<br>
accuracy of the correlation peak in a sample or a sample<br>
period, respectively, oversampling of the input signal or<br>
test sound signal, respectively, can be used.<br>
The means 522 for storing the soundtrack outputs the<br>
reference sound signal in the length of the correlation<br>
window in dependence on the supplied time code signals 582Z<br><br>
of the timer 582, wherein the correlation window is the<br>
search window wherein the test sound signal is searched.<br>
The first means 568 for quality evaluation is formed to<br>
perform a maximum value search in the result of the<br>
crosscorrelation of the signals or the amounts of the<br>
signals, respectively, and to weight the quality of the<br>
result of the crosscorrelation depending on the height of<br>
the correlation peak compared to other peaks and the<br>
crosscorrelation or to determine the quality of every<br>
individual correlation with regard to the peak to noise<br>
distance, respectively.<br>
Based on the quality evaluation, the reference sound signal<br>
with the best quality factor or quality, respectively, is<br>
determined, and based on the position of the peak of the<br>
reference sound signal with the best quality or quality<br>
factor, the shift of the peak in relation to the search<br>
window is determined, and, for example, output as time code<br>
difference between measured and actually valid time code or<br>
as relative time code.<br>
Depending on the result of the quality evaluation, the<br>
first means 568 for quality evaluation sends a control<br>
signal 568A to the sample rate converter 232, which, for<br>
example, differentiates only the three signal values "0",<br>
"+1", and "-1", wherein, for example, with "0", the sample<br>
rates of the last sample rate conversion or correlation,<br>
respectively, are maintained, because the correlation<br>
result from the modified reference sound signal with the<br>
medium sample rate has been determined as the one with the<br>
highest quality, wherein with "+1", the sample rates are<br>
increased by one step in relation to the last sample rate<br>
conversion or correlation, respectively, because the<br>
correlation result from the modified reference sound signal<br>
with the highest sample rate has been determined as the one<br>
with the highest quality, and with "-1", the sample rates<br>
are reduced by one step in relation to the previous sample<br><br>
rate conversion or correlation, respectively, since the<br>
correlation from the test sound signal and the modified<br>
reference sound signal with the lowest reference sample<br>
rate had the best correlation result or the best peak to<br>
noise distance, respectively.<br>
In other words, depending on with which sample rate (first,<br>
second or third) the best correlation peak has been<br>
obtained, the sample rate converter is increased or<br>
decreased, e.g. by a sample rate delta value or controlled<br>
such that it performs no sample rate conversion.<br>
Thereby, the correlation serves for addressing two main<br>
aspects. First, the determination of the position in the<br>
film or determination of the time in the film,<br>
respectively, based on the time code difference from the<br>
correlation. Second, the determination of the measure for<br>
the replay speed to determine the optimum reference sample<br>
rate or optimum sample rate conversion of the reference<br>
sample rate, respectively. Here, the adaption of the sample<br>
rates or the generation of adapted sample replay speeds,<br>
respectively, again allows improved correlation results and<br>
thus improves the time determination or determination of<br>
the position in the film, respectively, and thus improves<br>
synchronization and prediction.<br>
A preferred embodiment according to Fig. 5 is performed to<br>
detect signal parts with certain characteristics via signal<br>
analysis to suppress them during synchronization and thus<br>
avoid wrong detections or synchronizations, respectively,<br>
or to avoid random variations of the time axis.<br>
Such characteristics can, for example, be the loudness of<br>
the signal component or the "problems" of a signal and the<br>
signal analysis or detection of problematic components can<br>
be based on SNR (signal to noise ratio), PNR (peak to<br>
noise), spectral power or power density spectrum, spectral<br>
flatness or averaging of a time sequence.<br><br>
Below a threshold of the peak noise value or the peak noise<br>
distance, the time code difference can, for example, be<br>
detected as invalid. Or if several peaks with similar peak<br>
noise distance are determined, the time code difference can<br>
also be detected as invalid.<br>
Further, the quality of correlations with quiet signal<br>
components, i.e. signal components with low amplitudes, is<br>
lower than the one of correlations with loud signals due to<br>
the higher quantization noise during digital sampling<br>
compared to, thus, quiet signal components are suppressed<br>
based on thresholds or adaptively, to avoid random<br>
variations of the time axis. Additionally, the signal<br>
energy can be a further quality feature.<br>
A further example is suppression of problematic, because<br>
repetitive signal components to avoid ambiguities and thus,<br>
for example, wrong synchronization.<br>
Problematic signal components or portions, respectively,<br>
can further be signalized as metadata, for example, to<br>
suppress these signal components independent of the quality<br>
of the current correlation.<br>
The means 584 for time code generation is formed to convert<br>
based on the time code signal 582Z of the timer 582, which<br>
can, for example, be based on an internal or proprietary<br>
time code, fcr example into a standardized time code or a<br>
time code signal based on a standardized time code.<br>
The timer 582 is controlled by an internal clock (interval<br>
or frequency of the correlations), a coarse audio ID<br>
fingerprint or fingerprint representation, for example the<br>
time code signal 554Z from the feature determination or<br>
fingerprint representation, and the determined correlation<br>
difference, for example the time code difference signal<br>
570Z determined from the correlation of the means 570 for<br><br>
sampler selection. The timer has to perform a<br>
prioritization of correlation signal (highest priority),<br>
time code from feature determination and internal clock<br>
(lowest priority).<br>
The means 58 6 for time code smoothing is formed to smooth<br>
the time code signal 584Z, to so, for example, avoid a<br>
highly jumping time code or to find useful intermediate<br>
values if there are no time codes from the correlation, to<br>
compensate, for example, breaks in the analog sound. The<br>
time code signal 592 generated by the means 586 for time<br>
code smoothing is preferably a standardized time code, by<br>
which the film event system is synchronized or controlled,<br>
respectively. However, the time code signal 592 can also be<br>
used to generate the corresponding sample clock via a<br>
slowly regulating phase locked loop (PLL), if the included<br>
sound replay system is digital. Such phase locked loops are<br>
available as complete devices and thus no subject matter of<br>
the patent.<br>
Optionally, more than one film sampler with time different<br>
offset from the projection lens can be used for improving<br>
the robustness with damages of the film or for the<br>
synchronization of unsuitable portions, respectively.<br>
A second film sound sampler 542' can then, for example, be<br>
used, since the second film sound sampler 542' already<br>
exists in conventional cinema systems. Breaks in the analog<br>
sound can here be bridged by the film sound samplers 542,<br>
542' applied at different positions on the cinema film,<br>
since with short breaks in the film sound the probability<br>
increases that at least one sampler, either the first film<br>
sound sampler 542 or the second film sound sampler 542'<br>
provides enough signal for a correlation and the associated<br>
synchronization.<br>
Further, optionally, different samplers, e.g. for analog<br>
sound, Dolby digital sound (including decoder), DTS digital<br><br>
sound (including DTS decoder) or a different sound as well<br>
as a combination of the above-mentioned can be used as<br>
reference soundtrack and/or test soundtrack.<br>
Here, individual tracks can be used for the comparison by<br>
using averaging, majority decision or prioritization,<br>
automatically or via metadata of the generated time<br>
information as well as a downmix on mono.<br>
Generally, different samplers can be used for different<br>
sound formats and/or different film samplers with offsets<br>
different in time.<br>
The usage of a downmix on mono has the advantage that when<br>
the monotrack is used as stored soundtrack, needs to be<br>
stored compared to storing, for example, five channels.<br>
The storage of several, i.e. more than one soundtrack, i.e.<br>
no downmix, means that all channels are stored<br>
independently of each other and that then, for example, as<br>
discussed above, corresponding comparisons or majority<br>
decisions have to be performed to perform the<br>
synchronization by using a certain channel, the actual<br>
soundtrack and a corresponding channel of the stored<br>
soundtrack.<br>
The initialization phase or first synchronization and the<br>
synchronization, respectively, after a sound break from two<br>
critical phases during film projection or a synchronization<br>
of a film event system, respectively.<br>
Thus, preferred embodiments calculate more than three<br>
parallel correlations in the beginning, since no<br>
synchronization has been performed, this means more than<br>
three reference sound signals of different sample rates are<br>
compared or correlated, respectively, with the test sound<br>
signal to determine the correct sample rate or sample speed<br>
of the test sound signal as fast as possible. Here,<br><br>
different sample rates can be tested one after other until<br>
one of the correlation has the best signal noise distance.<br>
Alternatively or additionally, the first feature extractor<br>
552 and the means 554 for feature classification provide,<br>
together with the database, a coarse absolute time code<br>
value defining a coarse position in the film, to perform in<br>
a second step, for example by the correlation, a fine<br>
determination of the position of the film or a fine time<br>
code determination, respectively. As soon as the<br>
synchronization has been made, three correlations can be<br>
used to synchronize changes of the replay speed of the test<br>
sound signal during film projection.<br>
The accuracy with which a position in a film or the time<br>
associated to the position, respectively, can be associated<br>
to the time scale (time code), depends on the sample rate<br>
of the reference sound signal and the sample rate of the<br>
test sound signal, the higher the sample rate the more<br>
exact the position in the film can be determined. However,<br>
a lower sample rate has the advantage that with the same<br>
number of samples a longer section of the reference sound<br>
signal or the test sound signal can be represented. Thus, a<br>
preferred embodiment is formed to determine in a first step<br>
a coarse determination of a position in a film by<br>
representing a longer section of the film by a reference<br>
sound signal with lower sample rates, and a test sound<br>
signal is also gained by sampling with a lower sample rate.<br>
Then, in a second step, based on the coarse position in the<br>
film, a reference sound signal of higher sample rate and a<br>
test sound signal of higher sample rate are used for a fine<br>
determination of the position in the film.<br>
In other words, the window length is adapted during<br>
correlation. At the beginning of the search, windows with<br>
long timing but a reduced sample rate of the signals are<br>
used, but when a time is to be found approximately and is<br>
only to be followed, short windows are used, even with<br><br>
oversampling of the signals to obtain a higher time<br>
accuracy.<br>
In the initialization phase, for example, a "compatible<br>
replay" of the "old" audio format can be performed until<br>
the exact position is determined.<br>
In the same way, a "compatible replay" of the "old" audio<br>
format can be performed when the synchronization has been<br>
clearly lost until the exact position is determined again.<br>
The means 570 for sampler selection and the means for<br>
offset compensation 569 are only required in embodiments<br>
with more than one film sound sampler. Thus, for example,<br>
the means 570 for sampler selection decides whether the<br>
result or the time code difference of the first means 568<br>
for quality evaluation 568Z, respectively, or the result or<br>
the time code difference 568Z' of the second means 568' for<br>
quality evaluation, respectively, is passed on to the timer<br>
582 for determining a position in the film or a time code<br>
582Z, respectively. Since the second film sound sampler<br>
542' samples the test sound signal at a different position<br>
of the film, the difference (offset) between the position<br>
where the first film sound sampler 542 samples the film to<br>
the position where the second film sound sampler 542'<br>
samples the film is compensated by the means 569 for offset<br>
compensation, so that the timer 582 obtains the correct<br>
time code difference 570Z, regardless whether the time code<br>
difference 568Z or the time code difference 568Z' is<br>
selected with regard to the last stored time or the last<br>
stored position of the film, respectively, stored in the<br>
timer.<br>
Differing from the embodiment illustrated in Fig. 5a, the<br>
different reference sound signals of different reference<br>
sample rates can also be generated successively and<br>
compared or correlated, respectively, to the test sound<br>
signal to determine the measure for the replay speed of the<br><br>
test sound signal or the optimum reference sample rate,<br>
respectively. Alternatively, more than three modified<br>
reference sound signals can be compared to the test sound<br>
signal, parallel or serial, to allow a fast synchronization<br>
not only in the initial phase but also to synchronize the<br>
film event system during film projection more quickly to<br>
the current position in the film after larger jumps in the<br>
film, e.g. caused by cuts or portions missing in the film,.<br>
Differing from the embodiment illustrated in Fig. 5, a<br>
synchronization of a film event system can also be<br>
performed based on the pictures applied to the film, both<br>
for an evaluation of features or fingerprints,<br>
respectively, and for a correlation of a test image signal<br>
with one or a plurality of reference image signals.<br>
Thereby, as illustrated above, the correlation of audio<br>
and/or video signals can be used for determining the time<br>
space in an audio and/or video stream, and synchronous<br>
replay can be controlled due to this time determination.<br>
Alternatively, the determination of an audio and/or video<br>
signature from the raw material in the form of an audio<br>
ID/video ID (ID = identification) can be used for coarsely<br>
determining the time in a long AV stream to enable<br>
synchronization at any position.<br>
The basic approach of the invention is to store the already<br>
existing analog sound again in digital form to synchronize<br>
onto the cinema film with the analog soundtrack via<br>
correlation and other feature determination. The output<br>
signal or control signal, respectively, of the apparatus<br>
for generating a control signal or the synchronization<br>
device, respectively, can be any time code format.<br>
Preferably, the SMPTE standardized LTC time code format is<br>
used. For every cinema film, during production, a dataset<br>
has to be generated for the apparatus for generating a<br><br>
control signal or for the synchronization device,<br>
respectively.<br>
During production, a separate data carrier is generated for<br>
every cinema film for the above-described means for<br>
generating a control signal or a synchronization device,<br>
respectively. The data carrier contains the digitized<br>
analog soundtrack, e.g. in Dolby stereo format, as can be<br>
found on the spool of film, feature data to the soundtrack<br>
and matching time codes.<br>
In the following, an exemplary determination of a time code<br>
difference is described with reference to Figs. 5b. 1 to<br>
5b.4.<br>
Fig. 5b.1 shows an exemplary film 110 with a soundtrack 114<br>
as already described in Fig. 8.<br>
Based on the time code signal 582Z of the timer 582, a<br>
reference sound signal 274 is read out from the means 522<br>
for storing a soundtrack and a modified reference sound<br>
signal is generated according to Fig. 5b.2 via the<br>
apparatus for sample rate conversion 232, which represents<br>
a film section from the position L0 to the position L3 or<br>
the time To associated to the position L0 or a<br>
corresponding time code and the time T3 or time code,<br>
respectively, associated to the position L3.<br>
Fig 5b.3 shows an exemplary test sound signal or section of<br>
a test sound signal, respectively, which is defined by the<br>
starting time T1 and the end time T2 and has been generated<br>
based on the sample rate f = 1/Δt.<br>
Fig. 5b.4 shows the result of the correlation of the<br>
modified reference sound signal according to Fig. 5b.2 and<br>
the section of the test sound signal Fig. 5b. 3. The time<br>
difference ΔT' ' = T1 - T0 between the starting time T0 of<br>
the search window or modified reference sound signal of<br><br>
Fig. 5b.2 and the time T1 of the search window or reference<br>
sound signal, respectively, is the time shift based on<br>
which the time code difference or the relative time code,<br>
respectively, is formed. Thereby, the time T1 is the time<br>
or the time shift of the test sound signal where a section<br>
of the reference sound signal, which is n = 11 samples<br>
long, maximally matches the test sound signal or a<br>
correlation of the reference sound signal and the test<br>
sound signal, which is N = 11 samples long, has a maximum<br>
as correlation result, respectively.<br>
Thereby, knowledge of the absolute time T0 or the time T1 <br>
is not required for quality evaluation 568, since, for<br>
example, the timer 582 knows the last absolute time or<br>
absolute time code, respectively, and only requires the<br>
time code difference 570Z to determine the updated absolute<br>
time or time code, respectively. The difference can for<br>
example be illustrated from the position of the peak in<br>
relation to the time of the beginning of the search window.<br>
In Fig. 5b. 4, the peak is, for example, the first sample,<br>
i.e. the test sound signal of Fig. 5b.3 is shifted by "3 •<br>
At" in relation to the reference sound signal of Fig. 5b.2,<br>
wherein At is the sample period corresponding to the<br>
modified sample rate.<br>
Thus, the time code difference 570Z can consist, for<br>
example, of the value n = 3. Here, the advantage of the<br>
sample rate or replay speed of the reference sound signal,<br>
respectively, adapted to the variable replay speed of the<br>
test sound signal is advantageous, since At is also adapted<br>
to the replay speed, a more exact determination of the<br>
position of the film or offset in relation to the search<br>
window is possible compared to a fixed sample rate of the<br>
reference sound signal, since the only multiples of this<br>
sample rate are generated for a determination of the<br>
position in the film.<br><br>
Thereby, for example, the time T0 of the search window or<br>
reference sound signal, respectively, can be equal to T1 of<br>
the previous correlation since the film is only played<br>
forward.<br>
Fig. 6a shows an embodiment of a film system, wherein an<br>
apparatus 100 for generating a control signal 190 is<br>
coupled to a film event system 600, thereby, the apparatus<br>
100 for generating a control signal based on the film 110,<br>
shown in Fig. 8, generates the control signal 190, for<br>
example a time code, with which the film event system 600<br>
is synchronized.<br>
Fig. 6b shows a film system having an apparatus 100 for<br>
generating a control signal 100 and a wave-field synthesis<br>
system 610 as exemplary film event system, wherein the<br>
embodiment of the wave-field synthesis system 610 comprises<br>
a means 620 for controlling the wave-field synthesis<br>
system, a digital memory 622 for the wave-field synthesis<br>
audio signal and a plurality of loudspeakers 624 for the<br>
wave-field synthesis system. Based on the film 110 or an<br>
analog film soundtrack 114, respectively, the means 100 for<br>
generating a control signal generates the control signal<br>
190 to enable a wave-field synthesis audio experience with<br>
an originally analogously soundtracked film in a lip<br>
synchronous way.<br>
As an alternative to the wave-field synthesis system 610,<br>
naturally, other audio systems, for example digital audio<br>
systems or digital surround audio systems can be<br>
synchronized via the apparatus 100 for generating a control<br>
signal in a lip synchronous way.<br>
Fig. 7 shows an exemplary film as illustrated in Fig. 8, an<br>
exemplary digitally stored reference sound signal 720 and<br>
an association of a time scale.<br><br>
When generating the stored film information or the<br>
reference sound signal, respectively, the analog sound<br>
signal is sampled at a given replay speed and a given<br>
sample rate, for example 44.1 kHz and sound portions of,<br>
for example, 10 ms are stored as a so called audio frame,<br>
i.e. the digital reference sound signal is present as a<br>
sequence of audio frames on the memory. The associated time<br>
of a time scale can then, for example, consist in numbering<br>
the audio frames from 0 or 1 in an ascending way as time<br>
code or time scale, respectively, time code TC1 corresponds<br>
to audio frame AF1 in Fig. 1 or for example to find the<br>
starting time or end time of an audio frame as time code,<br>
such as for the first audio frame either 0 ms or 10 ms when<br>
an audio frame has a length of 10 ms.<br>
Usually, time codes have formats like hour:minute:second:<br>
frame, wherein frame usually relates to video frames with,<br>
for example, 24 frames per second (cinema film).<br>
Thus, the time scale or time code can associate several<br>
audio frames to one video frame or define an audio frame as<br>
smallest time scale unit.<br>
Correspondingly, the time code or the time scale can, for<br>
example, associate four audio frames to one time code, see<br>
TC1' in Fig. 7, which comprises four audio frames AF1 to<br>
AF4, or associate a single audio frame to a time code, see<br>
TC1 in Fig. 7, to which one audio frame AF1 is associated.<br>
Thereby, depending on audio format, the audio frames can<br>
also represent portions of the audio signal overlapping in<br>
time.<br>
The control signal 190 can, for example, be formed as time<br>
code, but also as a sequence of pulses, wherein, for<br>
example, every pulse corresponds to a time scale unit and<br>
the film event system accumulates the pulses similar to a<br>
relative time code to synchronize with the film.<br><br>
A further embodiment offers the approach to embed a<br>
watermark into the audio and/or video signal to further<br>
have, for example, an analog sound signal as fallback, but<br>
to realize at the same time a time code for synchronous<br>
additional services. It is an advantage of this approach<br>
that even with "difficult" audio signals, e.g. very quiet<br>
sequences or even similar "monotonous" sounds, a clean<br>
clock recovery is possible. For this variation, basically,<br>
the full set of relevant watermarked claims is useful,<br>
particularly in the area of searching for the correct clock<br>
rate or the readjustment of the sample rate, respectively,.<br>
The decisive disadvantage of this approach is, however,<br>
that the actual film is altered or a new version or the<br>
copy of the film has to be made, respectively, in order to<br>
be able to embed the watermarks into the audio and/or video<br>
signal.<br>
Depending on the circumstances, the inventive method can be<br>
implemented in hardware or in software. The implementation<br>
can be made on a digital storage medium, particularly a<br>
disc or CD with electronically readable control signals,<br>
which can interact with a programmable computer system such<br>
that the method is performed. Generally, the invention<br>
consists also in a computer program product with a program<br>
code for performing the inventive method stored on a<br>
machine-readable carrier when the computer program product<br>
runs on a computer. Thus, in other words, the invention can<br>
be realized as a computer program with a program code for<br>
performing the method when the computer program runs on a<br>
computer.<br><br>
