				<td>BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An arrangement for open-end rotor-spinning<br>
The present invention relates to an arrangement for application in open-end<br>
rotor spinning comprising an opening roller which is driven by a tangential belt<br>
and which can be brought to a standstill by means of a brake, said opening roller<br>
being taken up in a swivel housing, which is supported by a holding device and<br>
which can be removed therefrom together with the assembled opening roller<br>
while the tangential belt is still circulating.<br>
An arrangement of this type is known from US Patent 54 33 068 and from the<br>
practical embodiment of the arrangement described therein, which is delivered<br>
worldwide in large-scale production.<br>
In the known arrangement, the swivel housing can be disassembled together<br>
with the assembled opening roller while the tangential belt is circulating. During<br>
disassembly, the contact between the opening roller and the tangential belt is<br>
interrupted. Due to its mass, however, the opening roller continues to rotate for<br>
some time thereafter. An operator coming into contact with the still rotating<br>
opening roller either before or after the disassembly is at risk of injury, if the<br>
opening roller has not been stopped beforehand by means of activating the<br>
brake.<br>
DE 2451551 corresponds to US-patent 4059947 a copy of which is encloses. You<br>
may add the following text to the introductory part of the present specification:<br>
By DE 2451551 (or US 4059947) an open-end rotor spinning machine is known<br>
which has at each spinning position a first swivel housing forming a cover for a<br>
housing of the spinning rotor and a second swivel housing containing an opening<br>
roller. In the closed position the first swivel housing holds against spring means<br>
the second swivei housing in its operating position. In this operating position the<br>
opening roller is in engagement with a drive belt. If the first swive laesing is<br>
opened for making the spinning rotor accessible for cleaning purposes the spring<br>
means causes the second swivel housing to move into its inoperating position in<br>
which the opening roller is released from the drive belt and engaged with a<br>
brake arranged stationarily within the machine frame. The second swivel housing<br>
may be removed without bringing the opening roller into engagement with the<br>
brake.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to permit the safe disassembly of the<br>
swivel housing in a simple way.<br>
This object has been achieved in accordance with present invention in that a<br>
locking device is provided which prevents the swivel housing from being removed<br>
while the opening roller is still rotating.<br>
With the embodiment according to the present invention, it is now possible to<br>
remove the swivel housing for maintenance purposes from the operator"s side<br>
without the risk of injury from a still rotating opening roller.<br>
The locking device can take various forms and can function either electrically or<br>
mechanically.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment, the locking device is coupled with the brake in<br>
such a way that the swivel housing is only released when the brake has been<br>
activated. It can thus be established in a simple way that the swivel housing can<br>
only then be removed when the brake has already been<br>
activated. The risk of injury from the opening roller to the operator due to inattention or carelessness<br>
is therefore eliminated.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment, the locking device is designed as a movable lever, which can be<br>
brought into a position which prevents the swivel housing being removed. It is hereby practical when<br>
the lever is arranged on the swivel housing and comprises a stopping face which can be disposed on a<br>
countersurface in the arrangement for open-end rotor spinning. The risk of injury can thus be<br>
eliminated in a particularly simple and effective way.<br>
In a further advantageous embodiment, the locking device and the brake are activated by a joint<br>
activating element. Protection from injury can thus be obtained by means of a very simple design, as<br>
the already present activating lever for the brake can be used for a further function.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The arrangement for open-end rotor spinning comprises as essential spinning elements a spinning<br>
rotor 1, a feed roller 2 and an opening roller 3.<br>
The feed roller 2 and the opening roller 3, denoted only in Figure 1, are assembled in a swivel housing<br>
4, which can be swivelled around a stationary swivel axle S for maintenance purposes in a way<br>
described below and which can also be disassembled. The swivel axle 5 extends vertically to the<br>
respective axles of the spinning rotor 1, the feed roller 2 and the opening roller 3.<br>
The spinning rotor 1 comprises a rotor cup 6, and a rotor shaft 7 fixedly connected thereto. The rotor<br>
cup 6 is arranged in the known way in the inside of a rotor housing 8 in which a vacuum prevails, said<br>
.rptor housing 8 being supported in a stationary way. The rotorshaft 7 penetrates through the sealed<br>
back wall of the rotor housing 8 and is supported and driven externally therefrom in a way not shown.<br>
The swivel housing 4 comprises as an essential component a plane plate 9, to which, amongst other<br>
components, an opening roller housing 11 surrounding the opening roller 3 is arranged. The plate 9<br>
supports further a take-up 12, which serves to support, swivel and disassemble the swivel housing 4 in<br>
a way shown below. The plate 9 supports further an extension 13 for taking up the bearing of the<br>
opening roller 3 and for affixing the bearing of the feed roller 2 .<br>
The opening roller housing 11 is provided with an opening 14, through which trash particles, present<br>
in the fibre material to be spun, are expelled during the spinning operation. The trash particles fall into<br>
a trough (not shown), to which a protective metal sheet is arranged, thus preventing an operator from<br>
reaching into the opening 14.<br>
The opening roller 3 is connected to a drive wharve 15, which is disposed against a tangential belt 16<br>
in the operational position shown in Figure 1. The tangential belt 16 extends between the drive<br>
wharve 15 and the swivel jutle 5 in longitudinal direction of the open-end rotor spinning machine<br>
comprising a plurality of arrangements, and is pressed against the drive wharve 15 by means of a<br>
pressure roller (not shown), which also guides the returning end of the tangential belt 16.<br>
The feed roller 2, with its bearing housing affixed to the extension 13, is connected to an<br>
electromagnetic coupling (not shown) in the known way and is driven via a worm wheel and a worm<br>
by a drive shaft 17. The axis of the drive shaft 17 extends co-axially to the swivel axle 5.<br>
The swivel housing 4 is supported on stationary lateral walls 18 and 19 (see also Figures 4 to 6) of the<br>
arrangement in a way described below. The lateral walls 18 and 19 are in turn affixed to a frame (not<br>
shown) of the open-end rotor spinning machine.<br>
In its operational state, as shown in Figure 1, the opening roller 3 is functionally connected with the<br>
spinning rotor 1 via a fibre feed channel 21, which is located in a separate, exchangeable housing part<br>
22 of the swivel housing 4. During operation, the housing part 22 is disposed with a seal 23 on the<br>
rotor housing 8 and seals off the inside of the rotor housing 8 to the operator"s side 24. The housing<br>
part 22 supports in the known way an extension (not shown) in the area which is facing the rotor<br>
housing 8, said extension projecting into the inside of the rotor cup 6, as well as supporting other<br>
devices which serve the removal of the thread 25 spun in the spinning rotor 1.<br>
The opening roller 3 can be brought to a standstill by means of a brake 26. The brake 26 comprises a<br>
brake block 27, which is affixed to a spring steel sheet 28, which in turn is screwed on to the extension<br>
13.<br>
The opening roller 3 can be removed in a simple way from the swivel housing 4, as shown in Figure 2.<br>
The axial position of the opening roller 3 during the operational state shown in Figure 1 is secured by<br>
an axial locking device 29. This comprises a spring bar 31, which is affixed to the swivel housing 4.<br>
During operation, the spring bar 31 is pressed into a ring groove 32, which is located on the periphery<br>
of the bearing housing 33 of the opening roller 3.<br>
The arrangement for open-end rotor spinning is provided with a locking device 34 (see also Figure 4),<br>
which prevents the disassembly of the swivel housing 4 while the opening roller 3 is still rotating. The<br>
locking device 34 comprises a pin-like lever 35 arranged to the swivel housing 4, and also a stopper<br>
36, which is arranged to the lateral wall 19 of the arrangement for open-end rotor spinning. In the<br>
embodiment of the present invention, a section of a brake lever (not shown) is used as a stopper 36,<br>
which is mounted on the lateral wall 19 and with which the spinning rotor 1 can be braked. The lever<br>
35 comprises a stopping face 37, which can be disposed on a countersurface 38 of the stopper 36. It is<br>
arranged in a movable way to the swivel housing 4 and can be swivelled into various positions.<br>
The swivel housing 4 comprises a joint activating element 39 for the brake 26, the axial safety device<br>
29 and the locking device 34. The activating element 39 is provided on the operator"s side 24 with a<br>
handle 41. This handle 41 can be used to turn the activating element 39 around its axis 42 and bring it<br>
into various periphery positions.<br>
The activating element 39 penetrates through the swivel housing 4 from the operator"s side 24 to<br>
behind the plate 9. The activating element 39 is provided at this point with an eccentric part 43. This<br>
comprises outer eccentric surfaces 44,45,46 and inner eccentric surfaces 47,48,49 (see Figures 4 to 6).<br>
The outer eccentric surfaces 44,45,46 are located on the outer periphery of the eccentric part 43. The<br>
inner eccentric surfaces 47,48,49 are located in a ring groove-like recess of the eccentric part 43. The<br>
outer and inner eccentric surfaces 44,45,46,47,48,49 lie eccentric to the axis 42 of the activating<br>
element 39.<br>
A wing 51 is adjoined to the eccentric part 43 in axial direction of the activating element 39 . The pin-<br>
like lever 35 is arranged on the wing 51. which lever 35 projects from the wing 51 radially to the axis<br>
42.<br>
As can be seen in particular in Figures 4 to 6, the spring metal sheet 28 is disposed against the<br>
eccentric part 43 during the various rotational positions of the activating element 39. Accordingly, the<br>
spring bar 31 is disposed against the eccentric part 43 during the various turning positions of the<br>
activating element 39. The respective positions of the spring metal sheet 28 and the spring bar 31 can<br>
be determined with the aid of the eccentric part 43.<br>
Accordingly, the respective position of the pin-shaped lever 35 can be determined by means of turning<br>
the activating element 39.<br>
Shell-shaped holding devices 52 made of plastic are applied to the lateral walls 18 and 19 mentioned<br>
above which support the arrangement for open-end rotor spinning, which shell-shaped holding devices<br>
52 support the swivel housing 4. The inner contour of each shell-shaped holding device 52 surrounds<br>
the drive shaft 17 with clearance, whereby the drive shaft 17 is not supported in the area of each<br>
arrangement, but rather in only every fourth or sixth arrangement.<br>
The holding devices 52 comprise a sliding surface 53 on the outside, which is principally designed as a<br>
semi-cylindrical surface, whose axis extends co-axially to the swivel axle 5. The fork-shaped take-up<br>
12 of the swivel housing 4 mentioned above is supported in a sliding and swivelable manner on this<br>
sliding surface 53, namely with a cylindrical surface 54 provided in the base of the fork.<br>
The semi-cylindrical surface 53 of each holding device 52 is interrupted secant-like by a plane surface<br>
55 in such a way that the cylindrical surface 54 of the take-up 12 is not disposed on the holding de\ ice<br>
52 in this area. This plane surface 55 serves the removal of the swivel housing 4 from its two holding<br>
devices 52.<br>
During the operational state shown in Figure 1, the drive wharve 15 is disposed against the tangential<br>
belt 16. The opening roller 3 is thus driven to rotate. A drive connection also exists between the<br>
rotating drive wharve 17 and the feed roller 2 during this operational state.<br>
During the operational state shown in Figure 1, the activating element 39 takes up the turned position<br>
shown in Figure 4. The element 39 is thus secured against turning in a way not further described here.<br>
As can be seen in Figure 4, the spring metal sheet 28 is disposed against the outer eccentric surface 44.<br>
This has the effect that the brake block 27 takes up a position at a distance to the drive wharve 15. The<br>
spring metal sheet 31 is disposed against the inner eccentric surface 47. This has the effect that the<br>
spring metal sheet 31 is disposed inside the ring groove 32 of the bearing housing 33. The axial<br>
locking device 29 is effective in this position and prevents the opening roller 3 being removed axially.<br>
The pin-like lever 35 is in a position in which it is disposed, as seen from the operator"s side 24,<br>
behind the stopper 36. If the swivel housing 4 were to be swivelled out of its operational position as<br>
shown in Figure 1, the drive wharve 15 would be disengaged from the tangential belt 16. while the<br>
opening roller 3 would, however, continue to rotate for quite a while due to its mass. If the swivel<br>
housing 3 were to be brought into the disassembled position as shown in Figure 3 without turning the<br>
activiating element 39, the stopping face 37 would be disposed against the countersurface 38 thus<br>
preventing the removal of the swivel housing 4. The locking device 34 thus prevents the removal of<br>
the swivel housing 4 while the opening roller 3 is still rotating.<br>
The swivel housing 4 can be swivelled around the swivel axle 5 into the position shown in Figure 2 for<br>
maintenance purposes. The activating element 39 hereby takes up the turned position shown in Figure<br>
5. The spring metal sheet 28 is disposed against the outer eccentric surface 45, so that the brake block<br>
27 remains in a position at a distance to the drive wharve. The spring metal sheet 31 is disposed<br>
against the inner eccentric surface 48. This has the effect that the spring metal sheet 31 comes to be<br>
disposed outside of the ring groove 32 of the bearing housing 33. The axial safety device 29 is thus<br>
disengaged, permitting the opening roller 3, as shown in Figure 2, to be removed from the operator"s<br>
side 24 using a suitable gripping device to grip the opening roller 3 as soon as it has come to a<br>
standstill. Also in this turned position of the activating element 39, it would not be possible to remove<br>
the swivel housing 4 after being swivelled into the position shown in Figure 2 towards the operator"s<br>
side 24, because the lever 35 would be disposed against the stopper 36.<br>
The swivel housing 4 can be swivelled around the swivel axle 5 into the position shown in Figure 3 for<br>
the purpose of disassembly. The protective sheet metal mentioned above must be pushed downwards<br>
beforehand. In the swivelled position of the swivel housing 4 as shown in Figure 3, the activating<br>
element 39 takes up the turned position shown in Figure 6. The spring metal sheet 28 is disposed<br>
against the outer eccentric surface 46. This has the effect that the brake block 27 comes to be<br>
supported on the drive wharve 15 and brings this to a standstill within a very short time. The spring<br>
metal sheet 31 is disposed against the inner eccentric surface 49. This has the effect that the spring<br>
metal sheet 31 continues to be disposed outside of the ring groove 32 of the bearing housing 33. The<br>
lever 35 is in a position in which it no longer is disposed behind the stopper 36, as seen from the<br>
operator"s side 24. When the swivel housing 4 is removed in the direction of the operator"s side 24,<br>
the stopping face 37 would not be disposed on the countersurface 38. In this position, in which the<br>
opening roller 3 is braked and at a standstill, the blocking device 34, which prevents the swivel<br>
housing 4 being removed, is temporarily disengaged. The blocking device 34 is thus coupled with the<br>
brake 26 in such a way that it only releases the swivel housing 4 when the brake has been activated.<br>
As can be seen in Figure 3, the swivel housing 4 can be displaced slightly towards the operator"s side<br>
24 and can be removed when the tangential belt 16 is circulating, because the cylindrical surface 54 of<br>
the take-up 12 can be easily moved past the plane surface 55 of the holding device 52. The opening<br>
roller 3 is at a standstill: An operator coming into contact with the opening roller 3 by reaching into the<br>
opening 14 does not run the risk of injury.<br>
We Claim:<br>
1. An arrangement for open-end rotor spinning comprising an opening role<br>
which is driven by a tangential be ft and which can be hard light to a<br>
standstill by means of a brake, said opening roller being taken up in a<br>
swivel housing, which is supported by a holding device and which can<br>
removed therefrom together with the assembled opening roller while the<br>
tangential belt is still circulating, characterized in that a locking device<br>
(34) is provided which prevents the removal of the swivel housing (4)<br>
white the opening roller (3) is still rotating.<br>
2. An arrangement according to claim 1, wherein the locking device (34) is<br>
coupled with the brake (26) in such a way that it only releases the swivel<br>
housing (4) when the brake (26) has been activated.<br>
3. An arrangement according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the locking device (34)<br>
is designed as a movable lever (35), which can be brought into a position<br>
which prevents the swivel housing (4) being removed.<br>
4. An arrangement according to claim 3, wherein the lever (35) is arranged<br>
to the swivel housing (4) and comprises a stopping face (37), which can<br>
be disposed on a countersurface (38) of the arrangement for open-end<br>
rotor spinning.<br>
5. An arrangement according to claims 1 to 4, charactered in that the<br>
swivel housing contains the brake for the opening roter and a joint<br>
activating element (39) which is shiftable between at least twopositions in<br>
one of which positions the swivel housing is prevented from removal and<br>
the brake is held out of engagement with the opening roller and in the<br>
other of which positions removal of the swivel housing is allowed and the<br>
brake is in engagement with the opening roller.<br>
In an arrangement for application in open-end rotor spinning, the opening roller<br>
is housed in a swivel housing. The swivel housing can, together with the<br>
assembled opening roller, be removed from the arrangement for open-end rotor<br>
spinning when the machine is in operation. The opening roller, due to its mass,<br>
continues to rotate after it has been separated from the tangential belt which<br>
drives it.<br>
According to the present invention, a locking device is provided which prevents<br>
the removal of the swivel housing when the opening roller is rotating. This<br>
results in the opening roller being at a standstill when the swivel housing is<br>
removed. The risk of injury caused by a still rotating opening roller is eliminated.</td>
