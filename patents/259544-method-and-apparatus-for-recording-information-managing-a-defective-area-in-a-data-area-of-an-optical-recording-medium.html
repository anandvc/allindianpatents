OPTICAL DISC OF WRITE ONCE TYPE, METHOD, AND APPARATUS<br>
FOR MANAGING DEFECT INFORMATION ON THE OPTICAL DISC<br>
Tchnical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a method for managing a defective area<br>
on a high density optical disc, and more particularly to a write once optical disc,<br>
an apparatus and a method for managing a defective area on a high density<br>
optical disc such as a Blu-ray Disc Write Once (BD-WO).<br>
Background Art<br>
Optical discs on which a large capacity of data can be written as optical<br>
recording media have widely been used. Among them, a new HD-DVD (High-<br>
Density Digital Versatile Disc) on which video data and audio data can be<br>
written and stored in high quality and in large quantities, e.g., a BD (Blu-ray<br>
Disc), has been recently developed.<br>
The Blu-ray disc, which belongs to the next-generation HD-DVD<br>
technology, is the next-generation optical recording solution that can strikingly<br>
surpass the data recording capability of existing DVDs.   The Blu-ray disc world<br>
standards of HD-DVD that have recently been established include the use of a<br>
celadon laser having a wavelength of 405nm that is mush denser than a red laser<br>
of existing DVD technology having a wavelength of 650nm.   Accordingly, a<br>
greater amount of data than the existing DVD technology can be stored on the<br>
BD that has a thickness of 1.2 mm, a diameter of 12 cm, and an optical<br>
transmission layer having a thickness of 0.1 mm.<br>
As various kinds of standards related to the BD (Blu-ray Disc) are being<br><br>
WO 2004/068476 PCT/KR2003/002026<br>
2<br>
developed, various lands of standards for BD-RE (BD Rewritable disc) and BD-<br>
WO (BD Write Once disc) are being developed.  One of the new high density<br>
optical discs, on which high quality video and audio data. can be written, erased<br>
and rewritten for long periods of time, is a Blu-ray Disc Re-'writable (BD-RE)<br>
that is currently being developed.<br>
FIG. 1 schematically illustrates the structure of a recording area of a BD-<br>
RE.   The BD-RE of FIG. 1 shows the structure of the recording area of a disc<br>
having one recording layer.   Seen from the inner periphery of the disc, the<br>
recording area is divided into a lead-in area, a data area, and a lead-out area. An<br>
inner spare area ISAO and sri outer spare area OSAO for replacement of a,<br>
defective area are provided on the inner and outer peripheries of the data, area,<br>
and a user data area for recording user data is provided in the center of the data<br>
area.<br>
If a defective area exists in a user data area during recording of data on a<br>
BD-RE, the data recorded in the defective area is shifted to and recorded in a<br>
spare area as replacement data.   Also, position information relating to the<br>
defective area and the replacement data, recording area is recorded in defect<br>
management areas DMA 1, DMA. 2, DMA 3 and DMA 4 provided in the lead-in<br>
and  lead-out  areas.   The position  information  serves   as   management<br>
information for the defective area to perform defect management for the optical<br>
disc.   In the case of the BD-RE, since rewriting is possible in any area of the<br>
disc, the whole area of the disc can randomly be used irrespective of its<br>
recording mode.<br>
The Blu-ray Disc write-Once (BD-WO) is another type of high density<br>
optical disc that is being developed where a high quality of data can be recorded<br>
and reproduced to and from the disc.   As the name may suggest, data can be<br>
written only once on the BD-WO and is net re-writable on the BD-WO.<br><br>
WO 2004/068476 PCT/KR2003/002026<br>
3<br>
However, the BD-WO can be read repeatedly. As a result, the BD-WO is<br>
useful where the rewritability of data on a recording medium is not desired or<br>
essential.<br>
Discussions on the standardization of high-density optical discs, e.g.,<br>
such as BD-WO, have recently been underway. In this regard, a disc structure,<br>
a method and an apparatus for managing defective areas of the BD-WO are<br>
seeded, which accommodate and consider the unique characteristics and<br>
intended operations of the BD-WO. Such techniques will render the BD-WO<br>
commercially marketable and operationally feasible.<br>
In the BD-WO (Blu-ray Disc Write Once), since only a single recording<br>
of data in a specified area of the disc is possible, the recording mode is greatly<br>
restricted.   Accordingly, it is difficult to randomly use the whole area of the<br>
disc due to its management difficulty.   Also, in a high-density optical disc of<br>
write once type, such as the BD-WO, me management of the defective area<br>
becomes an important aspect of data, recording.   Accordingly, the optical disc of<br>
write  once  type  requires a unified standard of management  for  defect<br>
information on optical discs of this type.<br>
Disclosure oflavention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention is directed to an optical disc of write<br>
once type and a method and apparatus for managing defect information on the<br>
optical disc that substantially obviate one or mote problems and/or<br>
disadvantages of the background art.<br>

including defect management data associated with the recording medium 21, and<br>
a microprocessor or controller 26 for controlling the operations and elements of<br>
the recording/reproducing device 20.<br>
Data to be written or read to or from the recording medium 21 may also<br>
be stored in the memory 27.   All the components of the recording/reproducing<br>
device 20 are operatively coupled.   In the exemplary embodiment shown, the<br>
recording medium 21 is a recording medium of write-once type, e.g., such as a<br>
BD-WO.<br>
FIGS. 3A and 3B illustrate a structure of a single layer BD-WO and a<br>
dual layer BD-WO optical disc, respectively, according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention.   As shown in FIGS, 3A and 3B, the BD-WO can have one or<br>
two recording layers.   In FIG. 3A, a BD-WO having only a single recording<br>
layer (Layer 0) includes a single recording layer composed of a lead-in area<br>
(LIA), a data area, and a lead-out area (LOA), and  is referred to herein as a<br>
single layer disc.<br>
In FIG. 3B, a dual layer BD-WO includes two recording layers (Layers 0<br>
and 1) and is referred to hereinafter as a dual layer disc. The first recording<br>
layer (Layer 0) includes a LIA, a data area, and an outer zone. The second<br>
recording layer (Layer 1) includes a LOA, a data area and an outer zone.<br>
Generally a data writing occurs in the direction shown with the dotted arrow in<br>
the dual layer disc.   The single layer disc can have a capacity of 23.3, 25.0 or<br><br>
WO 2004/068476 PCT/KR2003/002026<br>
9<br>
27.0 Gbytes, whereas the dual layer disc can have a capacity of 46.6, 50.0, or<br>
54.0 Gbytes.<br>
It should be noted that all the different embodiments of the present<br>
invention, e.g., various methods discussed hereinafter, are applicable to any type<br>
of an optical disc, such as a single layer BD-WO, a dual layer BD-WO or a BD-<br>
RE.   Further, although the use of the recording/reproducing device 20 of FIG. 2<br>
is discussed below in conjunction with the methods of the invention, the<br>
invention is not limited to such and encompasses other recording/reproducing<br>
devices as long as they are configured to implement the present methods.   A<br>
detailed description of the preferred embodiments will be provided hereinafter<br>
with reference to an exemplary BD-WO (Blu-ray Disc Write Once).<br>
FIG. 4 shows an example of the structure of an optical disc of write once<br>
type, e.g., a BD-WO, and the method of recording disc management information<br>
according to the present invention.   The optical disc of write once type of FIG,<br>
4 is a single-layer disc having one recording layer.   This optical disc includes<br>
spare areas, e.g., inner and outer spare areas ISA0/OSA0, for recording of<br>
replacement data of a defective area, and one or more TDMAs (Temporary<br>
Defect Management Area) for managing information relating to the defective<br>
area, e.g,, in order to manage a physical defect<br>
In the case of a general rewritable optical disc, data can be repeatedly<br>
written and erased from a DMA (Defect Management Area) even if the DMA<br>
has a limited size, end thus a. DMA of a large size is not required.   However, in<br>
the case of an optical disc of write once type, e.g., a BD-WO, an area that has<br>
data recorded thereon cannot be used for recording  data again,  and  a<br>
management area of a larger size is requited with this type of recording medium.<br>
If no former recording is made on the optical disc of write once type, the final or<br>
latest TDMA (Temporary Defect Management Area) information is required to<br><br>
WO 2004/068476 PCT/KR2003/002026<br>
10<br>
be transferred to and recorded in the DMA (Defect Management Area), and thus<br>
it is referred to as the TDMA (Temporary DMA) in distinction from the DMA.<br>
In FIG. 4, a TDMAL is provided in a lead-in area with, a fixed size and a<br>
TDMA2 having a size variable or associated with a size of the respective outer<br>
spare area (OSA0) in which it is provided e.g., as seen in FIGs. 4-5B, P =<br>
(N*256)/4 is provided. The respective TDMA serves to store therein a TDFL<br>
(Temporary Defect List) and a TDDS (Temporary Disc Definition Structure) for<br>
defect management<br>
The TDFL is an entry list containing information for managing a series of<br>
processes for replacement of data in a defective area of the data area in the spare<br>
area. The size of ihe TDFL varies according to the size of the defective area,<br>
e.g., in the case of a single layer disc, the TDFL is prepared with a size of<br>
between 1-4 clusters, and in the case of a dual layer, the TDFL is prepared with,<br>
a size of between 1-8 clusters.<br>
The TDDS may he prepared in the unit of a single cluster, or both the<br>
TDDS and the TDFL are prepared in the unit of a single cluster. The TDDS<br>
includes information for management of the optical disc of write once type and<br>
information relating to the defect management required in the present invention.<br>
The defect management information is information located partially within the<br>
TDFL and the TDDS.<br>
Hereinafter, the detailed contents of 1he TDFL and the TDDS will be<br>
explained with reference to FIGs. 5A and 5B. FIG. 5A illustrates an. example<br>
of the structure of the TDFL. applied to the present invention. The TDFL is<br>
generally divided into three parts; a TDFL header, a defect entry list<br>
(Defect_eatry_List) and an indicator for the termination of the TDFL (TDFL<br>
terminator).<br><br>
WO 2004/068476 PCT/KR2003/002026<br>
11<br>
The TDFL header is at the leading portion of the TDFL and is used for<br>
recognizing the TDFL during defect management The TDFL header includes<br>
a TDFL  identifier, a TDFL update count field that increases a count by 1<br>
whenever the TDFL is updated, a field for the number of defect entries that exist<br>
in the corresponding TDFL (number of TDFL entries), and a field containing the<br>
number of entry types (number of first to N-th entry types).<br>
The defect entry list (Defect_entry_List) actually includes the contents<br>
that makeup the TDFL, e.g., the defect entry list is for managing position<br>
information of the defective area and the replacement area for each defective<br>
area in a single entry or location.   Each entry is made up of 8 bytes of data, and<br>
the structure of a each entry includes an entry type (status  1), position<br>
information of the defective area (Defective cluster First PSN), and position<br>
information of the replacement area for replacement data (replacement cluster<br>
First PSN) recorded in order within the entry.<br>
The TDFL terminator incudes information that indicates the termination<br>
of the defect entry list (Defect_entry_List).  In the case of a dual-layer disc, the<br>
defect entry list (Defect_entry_List) occupies 8 clusters at a maximum, and in<br>
the case of a single-layer disc, the defect entry list CDefect_entry_List) occupies<br>
4 clusters at a maximum.<br>
In FIG. 5B, the TDFL has the same structure as that of FIG. 5A, but the<br>
TDDS is now recorded along with TDFL information, e.g, the TDDS may be<br>
recorded in a different location than the TDFL (as shown in FIG. 5A), and/or<br>
may be recorded in the same cluster along with the TDFL (FIG. 5B).<br>
In the	 TDDS, a  variety of  informatiuon may be recorded.   However, in a<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention, the TDDS should indude<br>
position information of the latest TDFL (First PSN of latest TDFL),   In the<br>
optical disc of  write once type, the position in which the latest TDFL is recorded<br><br>
WO 2004/068476 PCT/KR2003/002026<br>
12<br>
is changed whenever the TDFL is updated with respect to the defective area.<br>
Accordingly, it is necessary to manage the latest TDFL position information at<br>
all times. The position in which the latest TDFL is recorded may be referred to<br>
as a TDFL pointer, since it contains information that indicates the position<br>
information of the latest TDFL. However the quantity of latest TDFL position<br>
information may be changed according to the recording method of the TDFL,<br>
which will be explained in greater detail hereinafter.<br>
The term First PSN used in the present invention and shown in the<br>
accompanying figures refers to the first physical sector number of a cluster.   In<br>
the case of a BD-WO, the minimum recording unit is defined as one duster, and<br>
since 32 sectors generally exist in a. single cluster, the First PSN refers to the<br>
position information  of the leading sector in the  corresponding  cluster.<br>
Consequently,  the First PSN refers to the position  information  of the<br>
corresponding cluster, e.g., defective cluster First PSN for the first physical<br>
sector number of me defective cluster.<br>
A method of recording a TDFL and a method of recording a TDFL<br>
pointer according to the various embodiments of the present invention will be<br>
explained in greater detail hereinafter, The defect entry list (Defect_entry_List)<br>
is expressed as TDFLl, TDFLlc, TDFL21, TDFL32, etc, to assist in the<br>
following description of FIGs. 6A-6B. TDFLl refers to entries prepared at the<br>
first stage (stagel), and TDFLlc refers to TDFLl after it has been cumulatively<br>
recorded. TDFL21 refers to first entries prepared at the second stage (stage2),<br>
and TDFL32 refers to second entries prepared at the third stage (stage3).<br>
The TDFL terminator has been omitted in FIGs. 6A and 6B to reduce the<br>
complexity of these figures, and the latest TDFL position information (TDFL<br>
pointer) recorded in the TDDS is expressed as P1, P2, P3, , , respectively.<br>
Also, the cluster that is the recording unit is illustrated with a thick solid line to<br><br>
WO 2004/068476 PCT/KR2003/002026<br>
13<br>
more prominently mark the contents of the TDMA.<br>
FIGs. 6A and 6B illustrate a method of managing defect information on<br>
an optical disc of write once type according to the fiist embodiment of the<br>
present invention.   According to the method of managing defect information<br>
according to the first embodiment of the present invention as shown, in. FIG. 6A,<br>
tie latest TDFL is repeatedly recorded, cumulatively with the previous TDFL.<br>
Accordingly, only one TDFL header and one TDFL pointer are used with respect<br>
to the TDFL of the camulatively repeated 1-4 clusters (or 1 - 8 clusters),<br>
respectively.   The TDFL header and the TDFL are recorded and managed in the<br>
unit of single cluster.   In the case of a single layer (SL) disc, the size of the<br>
TDFL varies from 1 cluster to 4 clusters and in the case of a double layer (DL)<br>
disc, the size of the TDFL varies from 1 to 8 clusters.<br>
At the first stage (stagel), a part of the TDFL information, a TDFL<br>
headerl and a TDFLl are recorded in a single cluster in the exemplary sequence<br>
shown.   In the TDDS, information (TDDS 1) that indicates the position of the<br>
latest defect management information is recorded.   In FIG. 6A, the information<br>
that indicates the position of the latest defect management information, e.g., the<br>
TDLF pointer is expressed as P1 as described above.   The position information<br>
indicated by this pointer is the first PSN, i.e., address of the corresponding<br>
cluster. For example, in FIG, 6A, the pointer P1 indicates the position of the<br>
TDFLheaderl.<br>
At the second stage (stage2) shown in FIG. 6A, TDFL21 and TDFL22<br>
are further recorded during an update operation. The defect management<br>
information is recorded in a once-iecordable state in the recording unit of a<br>
single cluster on the disc. During the recording of the defect management<br>
information at the second stage stage2, TDFL21 and TDFL22 (corresponding to<br>
new TDFL information obtained during the present update operation), and the<br><br>
WO 2004/068476 PCT/KR2003/002026<br>
14<br>
previously recorded TDFL information (TDFL1c that is identical to TDFLl), are<br>
recorded along with, the corresponding TDFL headed and TDDS2.   That is, the<br>
TDFL information is cumulatively recorded at each update stage along with any<br>
new TDFL informastion.   The second. stage (stage 2) refers to the recording<br>
method in the case that the list information of the defect management area<br>
exceeds a single cluster, but is less than 2 clusters.   For example, TDFL<br>
header2 + TDFLlc + TDFL21 equals a single cluster in size.   Therefore, when<br>
the TDFL22 is recorded this TDFL occupies a partial area of the second<br>
successive cluster, and TDFL beader2 contains the contents of the TDFLlc,<br>
TDFL21 and TDFL22.   The pointer value recorded in the TDDS2 shows that<br>
the latest defect information position P2- is recorded, the PSN of TDFL Header 2.<br>
Since the defect management information is cumulatively recorded, only the<br>
latest PSN is necessary as a pointer.   In this embodiment, only one TDPL<br>
header and one TDDS having the TDFL pointer are generated and recorded at<br>
every stage.<br>
In each stage, a sorting to sort the existing TDBLs can he performed.<br>
The sorting can be done based on certain, predetermined criteria. For instance,<br>
the TDFLs can be sorted first based on status 1 (see FIG. 5B) and can be further<br>
sorted based on the first PSN of the TDFL. Obviously other criteria can be<br>
used.<br>
The defect management information after a sorting has been performed is<br>
shown as an exampls at the third stage (stage 3). Here, the defect management<br>
information is sorted according to the PSN of the TDFL entry and based on the<br>
TDFL entry type (status 1). From a viewpoint of the second stage (stage 2), the<br>
sorting is performed under the assumption that a new TDFL entry is produced to<br>
be included  in a P2x position.<br>
If a new TDFL entry to be recorded is produced, the new TDFL should<br><br>
WO 2004/068476 PCT/KR2003/002026<br>
15<br>
to recorded by reflecting the list information of the defective area sorted<br>
according to the sorting rule as described above. The third stage (stage 3)<br>
shows this. Since all the information of TDFLlc, TDFL21 and TDFL22 are<br>
changed through sorting by the P2x, the changed defect management area list<br>
information is recorded as the TDFL31, TDFL32, etc. and for TDFL header3<br>
corresponding to the TDFL31, TDFL32, etc. is recorded in the lead of the<br>
corresponding information.<br>
In the TDDS3, the position information P3 of the latest defect<br>
management information is recorded. The TDFL31 occupies a single cluster,<br>
and the TDFL32 occupies less than a single cluster, following the TDFL31.<br>
Accordingly, at the third stage, the defective area management information<br>
exceeds a single cluster, but is less than 2 clusters.<br>
In summary, according to the method of managing defect information on<br>
an optical disc of write once type according to the first embodiment of the<br>
present invention, the TDFL is cumulatively recorded in the recording unit of a<br>
single cluster whenever it is updated. The TDDS then expresses the position of<br>
the latest defect management information (TDFL) with one pointer only. Also,<br>
in the case that the defect management information is changed according to a<br>
sorting rule, it can adaptively cope with such a change.<br>
In FIG, 6A, the TDFL header has the information that indicates the<br>
number of clusters currently used. This means that a flag for representing how<br>
many clusters are used for representing the defect management area list can be<br>
employed since the size of the defect management information is variable. It is<br>
also possible to record the information for representing the number of clusters<br>
currently used in not only the TDFL header, but also the TEDS.<br>
FIG. 6B shows a table that represents the change of the TDFL pointer by<br>
stages according to the first embodiment of the present invention.   In the first<br><br>
WO 2004/068476 PCT/KR2003/002026<br>
16<br>
embodiment, it can be recognized that only one pointer is required for each stage.<br>
FIGs. 7A and 7B illustrate a method of managing defect information cm<br>
an optical disc of write once type according to the second embodiment of the<br>
present invention.   According to the method of managing defect information<br>
according to the second embodiment of the present invention as shown in FIG.<br>
7A, the latest TDFL is repeatedly recorded cumulatively with the previous<br>
TBFL.   Therefore, only one TDFL header and one TPFL pointer are used for<br>
each cluster with respect to the TDFL of the cumulatively repeated 1- 4 clusters<br>
(or 1 - 8 clusters).   The TDFL recorded for each stage is the same as that in the<br>
first embodiment<br>
In  the   second   embodiment,   one   TDFL  pointer  is  used  for  the<br>
corresponding cluster with respect to the TDFL size that increases by stages.<br>
Accordingly, even if a defect is identified during the recording of the cluster<br>
indicated by TDFL pointer P3 at the second stage (stage2), the defect is<br>
overcome through re-recording of only the cluster corresponding to that defect,<br>
i.e., the cluster including or beginning with TDFL22,   The pointer can be<br>
changed to point to the re-recorded area.   If it is re-recorded, the defect can be<br>
overcome through the change of only the pointer indicated by P3.   Thus, the<br>
TDMA required for the preparation of the TDFL can be reduced,<br>
FIG, 7E shows a table that represents, the change of the pointer of the<br>
TDFL as the TDFL is updated by stages according to the second embodiment of<br>
the present invention.    In the second embodiment, eight pointers may be<br>
required at maximum, and pointers that were not used at the respective stages are<br>
set to zero.   In this example, the first TDFL pointer points to the P1 location, P2<br>
location and P4 location at stages 1, 2, 3, respectively.   The second TDFL<br>
pointer points to P3 and P4 locations at stages 2 and 3, respectively.   The<br>
second TDFL pointer can  indicate a pointer change form the first or previous<br><br>
WO 2004/068476 PCT/KR2003/002026<br>
17<br>
TDFL pointer location, which may be due to the re-recording of certain cluster<br>
due to a defect as discussed above.<br>
FIGs. 8A and 8B illustrate a method of managing defect information on<br>
an optical disc of write once type according to the third embodiment of the<br>
present invention.   According to the method of managing defect information<br>
according to the third embodiment of the present invention as shown in FIG- 8A,<br>
the latest TDFL is repeatedly recorded cumulatively with the previous TDFL in<br>
a single cluster, but the TDFL is also separately recorded for each cluster, and<br>
position information of the latest TDEL is recorded in each recorded duster in<br>
the TDDS.<br>
At the first stage (stage l), it is assumed that the TDFL headerl and the<br>
TDFLl are recorded in a single cluster,    in the TDDS, information that<br>
indicates the position of the latest TDFL; is recorded, and in FIG, 8A, this is<br>
expressed as P1.   The position information indicated by this pointer is the first<br>
PSN of this cluster, i.e, address of the corresponding cluster in the optical disc<br>
structure.   In FIG. SA, the pointer P1 indicates the first position of the TDFL<br>
headerl.   In the case of a SL disc,  the recording unit, e.g., 1 cluster, of the<br>
defect management information may the varied from 1 cluster to 4 clusters, and<br>
thus 4 pointers are required,   In the case of a DL disc, the recording unit of the<br>
defect management information may be varied up to 8 clusters, and up to 8<br>
pointers are required.<br>
At the second stage (stage 2) in FIG. 8A, new TDFL21 and TDFL 22 are<br>
further recorded along with the cumulative recording of previous TDFLs (which<br>
is represented as TDFL1c) during an update operation. The defect management<br>
information is recorded in a once-recordable state in the recording unit of a<br>
single cluster on the optical disc of write once type. During the recordation of<br>
the defect managemeat information at the second stage (stage 2), new TDFL21<br><br>
WO 2004/068476 PCT/KR2003/002026<br>
18<br>
and TDFL22, and the cumulative TDFLlc that is identical to TDFL1, are<br>
recorded along with the corresponding TDFL header 2 and TDFL header 3 and<br>
TDDS2.<br>
The second stage (stage 2) refers to the recording method in the case that<br>
the list information of the defect management area exceeds a single cluster; but<br>
is less than 2 clusters.    For example, the TDFL header 2 + TDFLlc + TDEL21<br>
equals a single cluster of data, and the TDFL22 is therefore recorded occupying<br>
only a partial area of the second successive cluster.    The corresponding TDFL<br>
header 3 is recorded, and the pointer value recorded in the TDDS2 shows that the<br>
latest defect information positions are recorded and identified by TDFL pointers<br>
P2 and P3.<br>
At the  third stage (stage 3), new TDFL31   and TDFL32  are further<br>
recorded along with the cumulative recording of previous TDFLs (which. is.<br>
represented   as   TDFL22cc)   during   the   update   operation.       The   defect<br>
management information is recorded in a single recording in the recording unit<br>
of a single cluster on the optical, disc of write once type as described above.<br>
During the recordation of the defect management information at the third stage<br>
(stage3), TDFL31 and TDFL32, an the cumulative TDFL22c that is identical to<br>
TDFL22, are recorded along with the corresponding TDFL header 4, TDFL<br>
header 5 and TDDS3,    The TDFL header 2, the corresponding TDFLlc and the<br>
TDFL21 are not newly recorded, but information that indicates their position P2<br>
is recorded in the TDDS3, so that an unnecessary, repetitive recording is<br>
prevented.   Therefore, the recording area of the disc is efficiently used and<br>
available space for defect management and recording is increased.<br>
If the TD7L22C, TDFL31 and TDFL32 information exceeds a single<br>
cluster, but is less than 2 clusters, i.e., the combination of TDFL header 4 +<br>
TDFL22c + TDFL31 equals a single cluster, the TDFL32 is recorded occupying<br><br>
WO 2004/068476 PCT/KR2003/002026<br>
19<br>
a partial area of the second successive cluster along with the corresponding<br>
TDFL header 5. The pointer value recorded in the TDDS3 shows that the latest<br>
defect information positions P2, P4 and. P5 are recorded at stage 3.<br>
The latest TDFL information can be obtained using P2, P4 and P5, e.g.,<br>
the positions of the latest defect management information recorded in the<br>
TDDS3.    The TDFL header 2, TDFLlc and TDFL21 information can be<br>
obtained using the P2 position information indicated by the first TDFL pointer,<br>
and the TDFL header 4, TDFL22c and TDFL31 information can be obtained<br>
using the P4 position information mdicated by the second TDFL pointer.   The<br>
TDEL header5 and TDPL32 inf ormation can be obtained using the P5 position<br>
information indicated by the third TDFL pointer.<br>
As discussed in the previous embodiment, a sorting can be performed to<br>
sort TDFLs in some order at each stage,   for example, at the fourth stage<br>
(stage 4), the defect management information after the sorting is performed is<br>
shown.   Here, the defect management information is sorted according to the<br>
PSN of the TDFL entry and based on the TDFL entry type (status 1).   From a<br>
viewpoint of the third stage (stage 3), the sorting is performed raider the<br>
assumption that a new TDFL entry is produced to be included in the P2x<br>
position.<br>
Since all the information of TDFLlc, TDFL2l, TDFL22c, TDFL31 and<br>
TDFL32   are  changed  through  sorting by the  P2x the  changed  TDFL<br>
information is recorded as the TDFL41, TDFL42 and TDFL42, and the<br>
corresponding TDFL header 6, TDFL header7 and TDFL header 8 are recorded<br>
along with a new TDDS4.  Here, in the TDDS4, P6, P7 and P8 which is a<br>
position information of the latest defect management information is recorded.<br>
The TDFL header 6 and the TDFL41 occupy a single cluster, the TDFL header 7<br>
and the TDFL42 oqcupy a single cluster; and the TDFL header8 and the<br><br>
WO 2004/068476 PCT/KR2003/002026<br>
20<br>
TDFL43 occupy less than a single cluster. Accordingly, at the fourth stage, the<br>
defective area management information exceeds two cluster but is less than<br>
three clusters.<br>
In summary, according to the method of managing defect information on<br>
an optical disc of write once type according to the third embodiment of the<br>
present invention, the TDFL header and the TDFL are recorded in the recording<br>
unit of a single cluster whenever the TDFL is updated.   If the TDDS expresses<br>
the position of the latest defect management information, and the recording is<br>
performed in excess of a single cluster, repeated recordings are minimized using<br>
the information that represents the position of the latest defect management<br>
information, and the latest defect management information can be efficiently and<br>
promptly obtained.<br>
Meanwhile, in FIG. 8A, the defect management information may be<br>
obtained when the corresponding header has information with respect to the<br>
corresponding   TDFL   contents.      Alternatively,   the   defect   management<br>
information may be obtained when the latest TDFL header includes all of the<br>
TDFL information.   For example, at the second stage (stage2), the TDFL<br>
header 2 only has  information with respect to the contenis of the TDFL1C and<br>
TDFL21, and the TDFL header 3 only has information on the contents of the<br>
TDFL22.   Therefore, all the information related to the corresponding defective<br>
area can be obtained by processing all entry information of all the headers<br>
indicated by the position of the latest defect management information.<br>
However, the TDFL header 5 includes information on the entire contents<br>
of the TDFLlc, TDFL21, TDFL22c, TDFL31, and TDFL32.   In this case, all<br>
     the information relating to the entire defective area can be obtained by the<br>
contents of only the latest TDFL header,<br>
In FIG. 8A, the TDFL header also has information that indicates the<br><br>
WO 2004/068476 PCT/KR2003/002026<br>
21<br>
number of clusters currently used. A flag for representing how many clusters<br>
are used in representing the defect management area list can be employed.<br>
Sines the size of the defect ntanagement information is variable, this flag can be<br>
particularly helpful. It is also possible to record information representing the<br>
number of clusters currently used, in not ooly the TDFL header, but also in the<br>
TDDS.<br>
FIG. 8B shows an example of table that represents the change of the<br>
TDFL pointers by stages according to the third embodiment of the present<br>
information. In the third embodiment, eight pointers are required at a maximum,<br>
and the pointers that are not -used at the respective stages are set to zero. The<br>
concept of FIG, 8B is identical to that of FIG. 7B and thus is not discussed in<br>
further detail hereinafter.<br>
FIGs. 9A and 9B illustrate a method of managing defect information on<br>
an optical disc of write once type according to the fourth embodiment of the<br>
present invention.   According to the method of managing defect information<br>
according to the fourth embodiment of the present invention as shown in FIG.<br>
9A, the latest TDFL is repeatedly recorded cumulatively with, the previous<br>
TDFL in one cluster.   However, the TDFL is separately recorded for each<br>
cluster, and position information of the latest TDFL is recorded in each recorded<br>
cluster in the TDDS.   In comparison to the third or other previous embodiments,<br>
the header that indicates the TDFL is not placed in the leading edge of the TDFL,<br>
but is placed in the TDDS.   This can prevent complecated rules for recording<br>
the TDFL header information by recording the TDFL header in the TDDS.   In<br>
this configuration a TDFL header may not be needed for each, cluster, but can be<br>
provided once at each update stage.   The TDDS is typically composed of 2048<br>
bytes, the TDFL header of about 60 bytes, and the existing TDDS information<br>
usually does not exceed 100 bytes.    Accordingly, there is no trouble in<br><br>
WO 2004/068476 PCT/KR2003/002026<br>
22<br>
performing the recording in the TDDS.<br>
FIG, 9B shows an example of a table that represents the change of the<br>
pointer of the TDFL by stages according to the fourth embodiment of the present<br>
invention.   In the fourth embodiment, eight pointers are required at a maximum<br>
in the same manner as the third embodiment, and the pointers that are not used at<br>
the respective stages are set to zero.<br>
