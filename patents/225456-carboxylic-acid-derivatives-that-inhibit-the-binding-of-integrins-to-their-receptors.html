				<td>This invention relates to a carboxylic acid<br>
derivatives that inhibit the binding of integrins to<br>
their receptors and is an improvement in or modification<br>
of an invention disclosed in our co-pending National<br>
Phase Patent application No.IN/PCT/2001/01110.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention is directed generally to the inhibition of the binding of a4b1 integrin to<br>
its receptors, for example VCAM-1 (vascular cell adhesion molecule-1) and fibronectin. The<br>
invention also relates to compounds that inhibit this binding; to pharmaceutically active<br>
compositions comprising such compounds; and to the use of such compounds either as above,<br>
or in formulations for the control or prevention of disease states in which a4b1 is involved.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
When a tissue has been invaded by a microorganism or has been damaged, white<br>
blood cells, also called leukocytes, play a major role in the inflammatory response. One of<br>
the most important aspects of the inflammatory response involves the cell adhesion event.<br>
Generally, white blood cells are found circulating through the bloodstream. However, when<br>
a tissue is infected or becomes damaged, the white blood cells recognize the invaded or<br>
damaged tissue, bind to the wall of the capillary and migrate through the capillary into the<br>
affected tissue. These events are mediated by a family of proteins called cell adhesion<br>
molecules.<br>
There are three main types of white blood cells: granulocytes, monocytes and<br>
lymphocytes. The integrin a4b1 (also called VLA-4 for very late antigen-4) is a heterodimeric<br>
protein expressed on the surface of monocytes, lymphocytes and two subclasses of<br>
granulocytes: eosinophils and basophils. This protein plays a key role in cell adhesion<br>
through its ability to recognize and bind VCAM-1 and fibronectin, proteins associated with<br>
the endothelial cells that line the interior wall of capillaries.<br>
Following infection or damage of tissue surrounding a capillary, endothelial cells<br>
express a series of adhesion molecules, including VCAM-1, that are critical for binding the<br>
white blood cells that are necessary for fighting infection. Prior to binding to VCAM-1 or<br>
fibronectin, the white blood cells initially bind to certain adhesion molecules to slow their<br>
flow and allow the cells to "roll" along the activated endothelium. Monocytes, lymphocytes,<br>
basophils and eosinophils are then able to firmly bind to VCAM-1 or fibronectin on the blood<br>
vessel wall via the a4b1 integrin. There is evidence that such interactions are also involved in<br>
transmigration of these white blood cells into the damaged tissue as well as the initial rolling<br>
event itself.<br>
Although white blood cell migration to the site of injury helps fight infection and<br>
destroy foreign material, in many instances this migration can become uncontrolled, with<br>
white blood cells flooding to the scene, causing widespread tissue damage. Compounds<br>
capable of blocking this process, therefore, may be beneficial as therapeutic agents. Thus, it<br>
would be useful to develop inhibitors that would prevent the binding of white blood cells to<br>
VCAM-1 and fibronectin.<br>
Some of the diseases that might be treated by the inhibition of a4b1 binding include,<br>
but are not limited to, atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, allergy, multiple sclerosis,<br>
lupus, inflammatory bowel disease, graft rejection, contact hypersensitivity, and type I<br>
diabetes. In addition to being found on some white blood cells, a4b1 is also found on various<br>
cancer cells, including leukemia, melanoma, lymphoma and sarcoma cells. It has been<br>
suggested that cell adhesion involving a4b1 may be involved in the metastasis of certain<br>
cancers. Inhibitors of a4b1 binding may, therefore, also be useful in the treatment of some<br>
forms of cancer.<br>
The isolation and purification of a peptide which inhibits the binding of a4b1 to a<br>
protein is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,510,332. Peptides which inhibit binding are<br>
disclosed in WO 95/15973, EP 0 341 915, EP 0 422 938 Al, U.S. Patent No. 5,192,746 and<br>
WO 96/06108. Novel compounds which are useful for inhibition and prevention of cell<br>
adhesion and cell adhesion-mediated pathologies are disclosed in WO 96/22966, WO<br>
98/04247 and WO 98/04913.<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to provide novel compounds which are<br>
inhibitors of a4b1 binding, and pharmaceutical compositions including such novel<br>
compounds.<br>

-C-, -C(O)-, -NH-, -S-, -SCO)-, -O-, -C(O)O- or -S(O)O-. Rings may be substituted<br>
multiple times.<br>
The terms "electron-withdrawing" or "electron-donating" refer to the ability of a<br>
substituent to withdraw or donate electrons relative to that of hydrogen if hydrogen occupied<br>
the same position in the molecule. These terms are well-understood by one skilled in the art<br>
and are discussed in Advanced Organic Chemistry by J, March, 1985, pp. 16-18, incorporated<br>
herein by reference. Electron withdrawing groups include halo, nitro, carboxyl, lower<br>
alkenyl, lower alkynyl, carboxaldehyde, carboxyamido, aryl, quaternary ammonium,<br>
trifluoromethyl, sulfonyl and aryl lower alkanoyl among others. Electron donating groups<br>
include such groups as hydroxy, lower alkyl, amino, lower alkylamino, di(lower alkyl)amino,<br>
aryloxy, mercapto, lower alkylthio, lower alkylmercapto, and disulfide among others. One<br>
skilled in the art will appreciate that the aforesaid substituents may have electron donating or<br>
electron withdrawing properties under different chemical conditions. Moreover, the present<br>
invention contemplates any combination of substituents selected from the above-identified<br>
groups.<br>
The most preferred electron donating or electron withdrawing substituents are halo,<br>
nitro, alkanoyl, carboxaldehyde, arylalkanoyl, aryloxy, carboxyl, carboxamide, cyano,<br>
sulfonyl, sulfoxide, heterocyclyl, guanidine. quaternary ammonium., lower alkenyl, lower<br>
alkynyl, sulfonium salts, hydroxy, lower alkoxy, lower alkyl, amino, lower alkylamino,<br>
di(lower alkyl)amino, amine lower alkyl mercapto, mercaptoalkyl, alkylthio, carboxy lower<br>
alkyl, arylalkoxy, alkanoylamino, alkanoyl(lower alkyl)amino, lower alkylsufonylamino,<br>
arylsulfonylamino, alkylsulfonyl(lower alkyl)amino, arylsulfonyl(lower alkyDamino, lower<br>
alkylcarboxamide, didower alkyDcarboxamide, sulfonamide, lower alkylsulfonamide,<br>
didower alkyDsulfonamide, lower alkylsulfonyl, arylsulfonyl and alkyldithio.<br>
As used herein, the term "composition" is intended to encompass a product<br>
comprising the specified ingredients in the specified amounts, as well as any product which<br>
results, directly or indirectly, from a combination of the specified ingredients in the specified<br>
amounts.<br>
As used herein, the term "mammals" includes humans and other animals.<br>
The ring defined by Y in Formulae I, II and III can be a mono-cyclic heterocycle or<br>
aromatic ring, or can be a bicyclic ring.<br>
The dotted lines used in Formulae I, II, III, IV and VI indicate that the bond at that<br>
location can be either single or double. The bond between the atoms Yand W for example<br>
can be a single or double bond if Y and/or W is a substitutent such as N, C or CH. Therefore,<br>
the ring defined by Y in the Formulae can be either saturated or unsaturated, depending upon<br>
which W and/or Y is selected. In Formulae IV and VI, the dotted line indicates that the<br>
nitrogen -containing ring optionally contains double bonds at the indicated locations.<br>
In the Formulae, certain R groups potentially substitute their associated rings a<br>
number of times. R19, R20, R21, R23, R27, R28, R29 and R25 may each substitute their<br>
associated rings more than once. For example for R9, when c is zero, the associated ring is<br>
unsubstituted, having hydrogens at the C-2 and C-4 positions; and for R23, when g is zero,<br>
hydrogens are at the C-2 - C-5 positions.<br>
Suitable substituents for the aryl, alkyl, cycloalkyl, heterocyclyl groups or the ring defined<br>
by Y and W in the formulae described above, when present, include alcohols, amines,<br>
heteroatoms, or any combination of aryl, alkoxy, alkoxyalkoxy, alkyl, cycloalkyl or<br>
heterocyclyl groups either attached directly, or via suitable linkers. The linkers are typically<br>
short chains of 1-3 atoms containing any combination of C, C=O, CO2, O, N, S, S=O, SO2, as<br>
for example ethers, amides, amines, ureas, sulfamides, sulfonamides, among others.<br>

Examples of the procedures that may be used to synthesize compounds of the<br>
Formulae described above are shown in the Schemes which follow. A detailed<br>
description of the representative compounds of the present invention is set forth in the<br>
Examples below.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be used in the form of pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts derived from inorganic or organic acids. The phrase "pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt" means those salts which are, within the scope of sound medical judgement,<br>
suitable for use in contact with the tissues of humans and lower animals without undue<br>
toxicity, irritation, allergic response and the like and are commensurate with a reasonable<br>
benefit/risk ratio. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are well-known in the art. For example,<br>
S. M. Berge et al. describe pharmaceutically acceptable salts in detail in J. Pharmaceutical<br>
Sciences. 1977, 66: 1 et seq. The salts can be prepared in situ during the final isolation and<br>
purification of the compounds of the invention or separately by reacting a free base function<br>
with a suitable organic acid. Representative acid addition salts include, but are not limited to<br>
acetate, adipate, alginate, citrate, aspartate, benzoate, benzenesulfonate, bisulfate, butyrate,<br>
camphorate, camphorsulfonate, digluconate, glycerophosphate, heinisulfate, heptanoate,<br>
hexanoate, fumarate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, 2-hydroxyethansulfonate<br>
(isothionate), lactate, maleate, methanesulfonate, nicotinate, 2-naphthalenesulfonate, oxalate,<br>
palmitoate, pectinate, persulfate, 3-phenylpropionate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, succinate,<br>
tartrate, thiocyanate, phosphate, glutamate, bicarbonate, p-toluenesulfonate and undecanoate.<br>
Also, the basic nitrogen-containing groups can be quaternized with such agents as lower alkyl<br>
halides such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl chlorides, bromides and iodides; dialkyl<br>
sulfates like dimethyl, diethyl, diburyl and diamyl sulfates; long chain halides such as decyl,<br>
lauryl, myristyl and stearyl chlorides, bromides and iodides; arylalkyl halides like benzyl and<br>
phenethyl bromides and others. Water or oil-soluble or dispersible products are thereby<br>
obtained. Examples of acids which can be employed to form pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
acid addition salts include such inorganic acids as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid,<br>
sulphuric acid and phosphoric acid and such organic acids as oxalic acid, maleic acid, succinic<br>
acid and citric acid.<br>
Basic addition salts can be prepared in situ during the final isolation and<br>
purification of compounds of this invention by reacting a carboxylic acid-containing<br>
moiety with a suitable base such as the hydroxide, carbonate or bicarbonate of a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable metal cation or with ammonia or an organic primary,<br>
secondary or tertiary amine. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited<br>
to, cations based on alkali metals or alkaline earth metals such as lithium, sodium,<br>
potassium, calcium, magnesium and aluminum salts and the like and nontoxic quaternary<br>
ammonia and amine cations including ammonium, tetramethylammonium,<br>
tetraethylammonium, methylammonium, dimethylammonium, trimethylammonium,<br>
triethylammonium, diethylammonium, and ethylammonium among others. Other<br>
representative organic amines useful for the formation of base addition salts include<br>
ethylenediamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, piperidine, piperazine and the like.<br>
Dosage forms for topical administration of a compound of this invention include<br>
powders, sprays, ointments and inhalants. The active compound is mixed under sterile<br>
conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and any needed preservatives, buffers or<br>
propellants which can be required. Opthalmic formulations, eye ointments, powders and<br>
solutions are also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention.<br>
Actual dosage levels of active ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions of<br>
this invention can be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active compound(s) which is<br>
effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular patient, compositions<br>
and mode of administration. The selected dosage level will depend upon the activity of<br>
the particular compound, the route of administration, the severity of the condition being<br>
treated and the condition and prior medical history of the patient being treated. However,<br>
it is within the skill of the art to start doses of the compound at levels lower than required<br>
to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and to gradually increase the dosage until the<br>
desired effect is achieved.<br>
When used in the above or other treatments, a therapeutically effective amount of<br>
one of the compounds of the present invention can be employed in pure form or, where<br>
such forms exist, in pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester or prodrug form.<br>
Alternatively, the compound can be administered as a pharmaceutical composition<br>
containing the compound of interest in combination with one or more pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable excipients. The phrase "therapeutically effective amount" of the compound of<br>
the invention means a sufficient amount of the compound to treat disorders, at a<br>
reasonable benefit/risk ratio applicable to any medical treatment. It will be understood,<br>
however, that the total daily usage of the compounds and compositions of the present<br>
invention will be decided by the attending physician within the scope of sound medical<br>
judgement. The specific therapeutically effective dose level for any particular patient will<br>
depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being treated and the severity of<br>
the disorder; activity of the specific compound employed; the specific composition<br>
employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient; the time of<br>
administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion of the specific compound<br>
employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in combination or coincidental with<br>
the specific compound employed; and like factors well known in the medical arts. For<br>
example, it is well within the skill of the art to start doses of the compound at levels lower<br>
than required to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and to gradually increase the<br>
dosage until the desired effect is achieved.<br>
The total daily dose of the compounds of this invention administered to a human<br>
or lower animal may range from about 0.0001 to about 1000 mg/kg/day. For purposes of<br>
oral administration, more preferable doses can be in the range of from about 0.001 to<br>
about 5 mg/kg/day. If desired, the effective daily dose can be divided into multiple doses<br>
for purposes of administration; consequently, single dose compositions may contain such<br>
amounts or submultiples thereof to make up the daily dose.<br>
The present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions that comprise<br>
compounds of the present invention formulated together with one or more non-toxic<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. The pharmaceutical compositions can be specially<br>
formulated for oral administration in solid or liquid form, for parenteral injection or for rectal<br>
administration.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention can be administered to humans<br>
and other mammals orally, rectally, parenterally , intracisternally, intravaginally,<br>
intraperitoneally, topically (as by powders, ointments or drops), bucally or as an oral or<br>
nasal spray. The term "parenterally," as used herein, refers to modes of administration<br>
which include intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intrasternal, subcutaneous and<br>
intraarticular injection and infusion.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition<br>
comprising a component of the present invention and a physiologically tolerable diluent.<br>
The present invention includes one or more compounds as described above formulated<br>
into compositions together with one or more non-toxic physiologically tolerable or<br>
acceptable diluents, carriers, adjuvants or vehicles that are collectively referred to herein<br>
as diluents, for parenteral injection, for intranasal delivery, for oral administration in solid<br>
or liquid form, for rectal or topical administration, among others.<br>
The compositions can also be delivered through a catheter for local delivery at a<br>
target site, via an intracoronary stent (a tubular device composed of a fine wire mesh), or<br>
via a biodegradable polymer. The compounds may also be complexed to ligands, such as<br>
antibodies, for targeted delivery.<br>
Compositions suitable for parenteral injection may comprise physiologically<br>
acceptable, sterile aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or<br>
emulsions and sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or<br>
dispersions. Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers, diluents, solvents or<br>
vehicles include water, ethanol, polyols (propyleneglycol, polyethyleneglycol, glycerol,<br>
and the like), vegetable oils (such as olive oil), injectable organic esters such as ethyl<br>
oleate, and suitable mixtures thereof.<br>
These compositions can also contain adjuvants such as preserving, wetting,<br>
emulsifying, and dispensing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be<br>
ensured by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens,<br>
chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include<br>
isotonic agents, for example sugars, sodium chloride and the like. Prolonged absorption<br>
of the injectable pharmaceutical form can be brought about by the use of agents delaying<br>
absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.<br>
Suspensions, in addition to the active compounds, may contain suspending agents,<br>
as for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan<br>
esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar and<br>
tragacanth, or mixtures of these substances, and the like.<br>
In some cases, in order to prolong the effect of the drug, it is desirable to slow the<br>
absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This can be<br>
accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with<br>
poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of<br>
dissolution which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form.<br>
Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered drug form is<br>
accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle.<br>
Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the drug<br>
in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio<br>
of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug<br>
release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include<br>
poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared<br>
by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body<br>
tissues.<br>
The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a<br>
bacterial-retaining filter or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid<br>
compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile<br>
injectable medium just prior to use.<br>
Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders<br>
and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound may be mixed with at<br>
least one inert, pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier, such as sodium citrate or<br>
dicalcium phosphate and/or a) fillers or extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose,<br>
glucose, mannitol and silicic acid; b) binders such as carboxymethylcellulose, alginates,<br>
gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sucrose and acacia; c) humectants such as glycerol; d)<br>
disintegrating agents such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch,<br>
alginic acid, certain silicates and sodium carbonate; e) solution retarding agents such as<br>
paraffin; f) absorption accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds; g) wetting<br>
agents such as cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate; h) absorbents such as kaolin and<br>
bentonite clay and i) lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid<br>
polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate and mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules,<br>
tablets and pills, the dosage form may also comprise buffering agents.<br>
Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and<br>
hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high<br>
molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like.<br>
The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills and granules can be<br>
prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings well-known<br>
in the pharmaceutical formulating art. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and<br>
may also be of a composition such that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or<br>
preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner.<br>
Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric substances<br>
and waxes.<br>
The active compounds can also be in micro-encapsulated form, if appropriate,<br>
with one or more of the above-mentioned excipients.<br>
Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active<br>
compounds, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art<br>
such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as<br>
ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl<br>
benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethyl formamide, oils (in particular,<br>
cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor and sesame oils), glycerol,<br>
tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan and<br>
mixtures thereof.<br>
Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions may also include adjuvants such as<br>
wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming<br>
agents.<br>
Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories<br>
which can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with suitable non-<br>
irritating excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository<br>
wax which are solid at room temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore<br>
melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound.<br>
Compounds of the present invention can also be administered in the form of<br>
liposomes. As is known in the art, liposomes are generally derived from phospholipids or<br>
other lipid substances. Liposomes are formed by mono- or multi-lamellar hydrated liquid<br>
crystals which are dispersed in an aqueous medium. Any non-toxic, physiologically<br>
acceptable and metabolizable lipid capable of forming liposomes can be used. The<br>
present compositions in liposome form can contain, in addition to a compound of the<br>
present invention, stabilizers, preservatives, excipients and the like. The preferred lipids<br>
are natural and synthetic phospholipids and phosphatidyl cholines (lecithins) used<br>
separately or together.<br>
Methods to form liposomes are known in the art. See, for example, Prescott, Ed.,<br>
Methods in Cell Biology, Volume XIV, Academic Press, New York, N.Y. (1976), p. 33 et<br>
seq.<br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs" as used herein represents those<br>
prodrugs of the compounds of the present invention which are, within the scope of sound<br>
medical judgement, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of humans and lower<br>
animals without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response, and the like, commensurate<br>
with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio, and effective for their intended use, as well as the<br>
zwitterionic forms, where possible, of the compounds of the invention. Prodrugs of the<br>
present invention may be rapidly transformed in vivo to the parent compound of the above<br>
formula, for example, by hydrolysis in blood. A thorough discussion is provided in T.<br>
Higuchi and V. Stella, Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems. V. 14 of the A.C.S.<br>
Symposium Series, and in Edward B. Roche, ed., Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design.<br>
American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press (1987), hereby incorporated<br>
by reference.<br>
Compounds of the present invention that are formed by in vivo conversion of a<br>
different compound that was administered to a mammal are intended to be included<br>
within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Compounds of the present invention may exist as stereoisomers wherein<br>
asymmetric or chiral centers are present. These stereoisomers are "R" or "S" depending<br>
on the configuration of substituents around the chiral carbon atom. The present invention<br>
contemplates various stereoisomers and mixtures thereof. Stereoisomers include<br>
enantiomers and diastereomers, and mixtures of enantiomers or diastereomers. Individual<br>
stereoisomers of compounds of the present invention may be prepared synthetically from<br>
commercially available starting materials which contain asymmetric or chiral centers or<br>
by preparation of racemic mixtures followed by resolution well-known to those of<br>
ordinary skill in the art. These methods of resolution are exemplified by (1) attachment<br>
of a mixture of enantiomers to a chiral auxiliary, separation of the resulting mixture of<br>
diastereomers by recrystallization or chromatography and liberation of the optically pure<br>
product from the auxiliary or (2) direct separation of the mixture of optical enantiomers<br>
on chiral chromatographic columns.<br>
The compounds of the invention can exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms,<br>
including hydrated forms, such as hemi-hydrates. In general, the solvated forms, with<br>

equivalent to the unsolvated forms for the purposes of the invention.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention contemplates a process of inhibiting the<br>
binding of a4b1 integrin to VCAM-1. A process of the present invention can be used either<br>
in vitro or in vivo. In accordance with a process of the present invention, a cell expressing<br>
a4b1 integrin is exposed to a cell expressing VCAM-1 in the presence of an effective<br>
inhibiting amount of a compound of the present invention.<br>
A cell expressing a4b1 integrin can be a naturally occurring white blood cell, mast<br>
cell or other cell type that naturally expresses a4b1 on the cell surface, or a cell<br>
transfected with an expression vector that contains a poly-nucleotide (e.g., genomic DNA<br>
or cDNA) that encodes a4b1 integrin. In an especially preferred embodiment,<br>
a4b1 integrin is present on the surface of a white blood cell such as a monocyte, a<br>
lymphocyte or a granulocyte (e.g., an eosinophil or a basophil).<br>
A cell that expresses VCAM-1 can be a naturally occurring cell (e.g. an<br>
endothelial cell) or a cell transfected with an expression vector containing a<br>
polynucleotide that encodes VCAM-1. Methods for producing transfected cells that<br>
express VCAM-1 are well known in the art.<br>
Where VCAM-1 exists on the surface of cell, the expression of that VCAM-1 is<br>
preferably induced by inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-a<br>
interleukin-4 and interleukin-1b.<br>
Where the cells expressing a4b1 integrin and VCAM-1 are in a living organism, a<br>
compound of the present invention is administered in an effective amount to the living<br>
organism. Preferably, the compound is in a pharmaceutical composition of this invention.<br>
A process of the present invention is especially useful in treating diseases associated<br>
with uncontrolled migration of white blood cells to damaged tissue. Such diseases<br>
include, but are not limited to, asthma, atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, allergy,<br>
multiple sclerosis, lupus, inflammatory bowel disease, graft rejection, contact<br>
hypersensitivity, type I diabetes, leukemia, and brain cancer. Administration is<br>
preferably accomplished via intravascular, subcutaneous, intranasal, transdermal or oral<br>
delivery.<br>
The present invention also provides a process of selectively inhibiting the binding<br>
of a4b1 integrin to a protein comprising exposing the integrin to the protein in the<br>
presence of an effective inhibiting amount of a compound of the present invention. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the a4b1 integrin is expressed on the surface of a cell, either<br>
naturally occurring or a cell transformed to express a4b1 integrin.<br>
The protein to which the a4b1 integrin binds can be expressed either on a cell<br>
surface or be part of the extracellular matrix. Especially preferred proteins are fibronectin<br>
or invasin.<br>

detail hereinafter in the Examples. These Examples are presented to describe preferred<br>
embodiments and utilities of the invention and are not meant to limit the invention unless<br>
otherwise stated in the claims appended hereto.<br>

Example 42<br>
A procedure in which a 26-amino acid peptide containing the CS1 sequence of fibronectin with an N-terminal Cys (CDELPQLVTLPHPNLHGPEILDVPST) was coupled to maleimide activated ovalbumin was used to determine the efficacy of the compounds synthesized. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) and CS1 conjugated ovalbumin were coated onto 96-well polystyrene plates at 0.5 Âµg/ml in TBS (50 mM TRIS, pH 7.5; 150 mM NaCl) at 4Â°C for 16 hours. The plates were washed three times with TBS and blocked with TBS containing 3% BSA at room temperature for 4 hours. Blocked plates were<br>
washed three times in binding buffer (TBS; 1 mM MgCl2; 1 mM CaCl2; 1 mM MnCl2)) prior to assay. Ramos cells fluorescently labeled with calcein AM were resuspended in binding buffer (107 cells/ml) and diluted 1:2 with same buffer with or without compound. 100 ÂµM of compound was added. The cells were added immediately to the wells (2.5 x 105 cells/well) and incubated for 30 minutes at 37Â°C. Following three washes with binding buffer, adherent cells were lysed and quantitated using a fluorometer. The results are shown in Tables 2-7. IC5o is defined as the dose required to give 50% inhibition, measured in ÂµM for Tables 2 and 4. The lower the IC50 value and the greater the percentage of inhibition, the more efficient the compound is at prevention of cell adhesion.<br>
