STEREOSELECTTVE PROCESS AND CRYSTALLINE FORMS OF A<br>
CAMPTOTHECIN<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a stereoselective process for preparing 7-[(E)-<br>
t-butyloxyiminomethyl]-camptothecin (also known as gimatecan). With<br>
the addition of further dissolution and precipitation steps carried out<br>
in appropriate different solvent mixtures, three new crystalline forms<br>
of gimatecan are obtainable by using the same stereoselective process<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Camptothecin is an alkaloid, which was isolated by Wall et al (J. Am.<br>
Chem. Soc. 88, 3888-3890 (1966)) for the first time from the tree<br>
Camptoteca acuminata, a plant originating from China, of the Nys-<br>
saceae family. The molecule consists of a pentacyclic structure having<br>
a lactone in the E ring, which is essential for cytotoxicity. The drug<br>
demonstrated a wide spectrum of antitumor activity, in particular<br>
against colon tumors, other solid, tumors and leukemias, and the first<br>
clinical trials were performed in the early 70's.<br>
Since Camptothecin (CPT) has low water solubility and in order to<br>
prepare clinical trials, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) prepared<br>
the sodium salt (NSC 100880), which is water-soluble. Clinical trials in<br>
phase I and II were not completed because of the high toxicity showed<br>
by the compound (hemorrhagic cystitis, gastrointestinal toxicity, such<br>
as nausea, vomit, diarrhoea, and myelosuppression, especially leuco-<br>
penia and thrombocytopenia.<br>
 	Subsequently many CPT analogues weresynthesised in order to ob-<br>
tain compounds with lower toxicity and higher water solubility. Two<br>
drugs are marketed, irinotecan (CPT-11) (Camptosar™ by Upjohn)<br>
and topotecan (Hycamtin™ or Thycantin™ by Smith Kline &amp;<br>
Beecham).<br><br>
WO 2006/067092	PCT/EP2005/056849<br>
2<br>
All the derivatives identified to-date contain the parent structure with<br>
5 rings, essential for cytotoxicity. It was demonstrated that modifica-<br>
tions on the first ring, such as in the case of the above-mentioned<br>
drugs increase water solubility and allow a higher tolerability of the<br>
drug.<br>
Patent application WO97/31003 discloses derivatives of camptothecins<br>
substituted at positions 7, 9 and 10. Position 7 provides the following<br>
substitutions: -CN, -CH(CN)-R4, -CH=C(CN)-R4, -CH2-CH=C(CN)-R4, -<br>
C(=NOH)-NH2, -CH=C(NO2)-R4, -CH(CH2NO2)-R4, 5-tetrazolyl, 2- (4,<br>
5-dihydroxazolyl), 1,2 ,4-oxadiazolidin-3-yl- 5-one, wherein R4 is hy-<br>
drogen, linear or branched alkyl from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, nitrile, car-<br>
boxyalkoxy.<br>
Of these compounds, the best one proved to be the 7-nitrile (7-CN),<br>
hereinafter named CPT 83, with cytotoxic activity on non-small cells<br>
lung carcinoma (non-SCEC,H-460) This tumbur line is intrinsically<br>
resistant to cytotoxic therapy and is only moderately responsive to to-<br>
poisomerase I inhibitors, notwithstanding the overexpression of the<br>
target enzyme. CPT 83 is more active than topotecan, taken as refer-<br>
ence compound and on the whole it offers a better pharmacological pro-<br>
file, even in terms of tolerability, then a better therapeutic index.<br>
CPT 83 is prepared trough a synthesis route comprising the oxidation<br>
of 7-hydroxymethylcamptothecin to camptothecin 7-aldehyde, the<br>
transformation of the latter into oxime and final conversion into ni-<br>
trile.<br>
The starting compound and the intermediates are disclosed in Sawada<br>
et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull., 39, 5272 (1991). This paper makes refer-<br>
ence to a patent family with priority of 1981,  for example European<br>
patent application EP 0056692, published in 1982. In these publica-<br>
tions camptothecin 7-aldehyde and its oxime are described among oth-<br>
ers.<br><br>
WO 2006/067092	PCT/EP2005/056849<br>
3<br>
The usefulness of these derivatives is to provide compounds with anti-<br>
tumor activity having low toxicity starting from 7-<br>
hydroxymetylcamptothecin. In the paper published on Chem. Pharm.<br>
Bull. 39, 5272 (1991), the authors demonstrate that, with respect to<br>
camptothecin, the 7-alkyl and 7-acyloxymethyl derivatives, which were<br>
not foreseen in the above mentioned patent application, are the more<br>
active compounds on lines of murine leukemia L1210, while lower ac-<br>
tivity, always with respect to camptothecin, was observed in com-<br>
pounds bearing 7-substitutions with high polar character, such as hy-<br>
drazones and the oxime - CH(=NOH).<br>
In patent application EP1044977 and in Dallavalle S. et al., J. Med.<br>
Chem. 2001, 44, 3264-3274, camptothecin derivatives are described<br>
which bear an alkyloxime O-substituted at position 7 and which are<br>
endowed with antitumor activity higher than the compound of refer-<br>
ence topotecan. Moreover these camptothecin derivatives bearing an<br>
imino group on position 7, also show an improved therapeutic index.<br>
Among these compounds one of the preferred molecules was shown to<br>
be 7-t-butoxyiminomethylcamptothecin (CPT 184). When this molecule<br>
is prepared as described in EP1044977 and in the above DallavaEe pa-<br>
per, a mixture of the two E and Z isomers, in 8:2 ratio, is obtained from<br>
a solvent mixture containing ethanol and pyridine.<br>
All the processes described in the above-mentioned literature for ob-<br>
taining camptothecin derivatives bearing alkyloxime O-substituted at<br>
position 7 lead to a mixture of the two E and Z isomers of the oxime or<br>
the alkyloxime.<br>
Therefore, it is desirable to make available a stereoselective process<br>
leading to single E,Z isomers, respectively, more particularly the E<br>
isomerr<br>
Many drugs, old and new, were discovered and rushed into market as<br>
their 'suitable' crystalline forms and had never been screened thor-<br>
oughly for their potential polymorphic forms. With the recent techno-<br><br>
WO 2006/067092	PCT/EP2005/056849<br>
4<br>
logical advancement of solid state chemistry, it is possible that new po-<br>
lymorphic forms can be discovered, which have never been seen before.<br>
The new polymorphic forms are often able to deliver therapeutic ad-<br>
vantages and represent one of the new challenges of the pharmaceuti-<br>
cal industry. As a matter of fact polymorphism, the ability of a mole-<br>
cule to crystallize into more than one crystal arrangement, can have a<br>
profound effect on the shelf life, solubility, formulation properties, and<br>
processing properties of a drug. More seriously, the action of a drug<br>
can be affected by the polymorphism of the drug molecules. Different<br>
polymorphs can have different rates of uptake in the body, leading to<br>
lower or higher biological activity than desired. In extreme cases, an<br>
undesired polymorph can even be toxic. The occurrence of an unknown<br>
polymorphic form during manufacture can have an enormous impact<br>
on a drug company. Therefore it is vital that researchers involved in<br>
the formulation of crystalline products be able to select the polymorph<br>
with the correct properties and anticipate problems such as the un-<br>
wanted crystallization of other polymorphs. Surprisingly, a very   large<br>
number of Pharmaceuticals exhibit the phenomenon of polymorphism.<br>
70% of barbiturates, 60% of sulfonamides and 23% of steroids exist in<br>
different polymorphic forms.<br>
The problem of polymorphism in organic compounds is generically re-<br>
viewed by Caira, M. R. "Crystalline Polymorphism of Organic Com-<br>
pounds", Topics in Current Chemistry, Springier, Berlin, DE, Vol. 198,<br>
1998, pages 163-208.<br>
Conducting a crystallization study on gimatecan has brought the Ap-<br>
plicant to the claimed invention.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
We have now surprisingly found a stereoselective process for preparing<br>
7-[(E)-t-butyloxyiminomethyl] -camptothecin (also known as gi-<br>
matecan). We have also found that it is possible to obtain the complete<br>
conversion of the Z isomer into the E isomer. For clarity, the structural<br>
formulae of the two isomers are shown in Figure 1.<br>
Moreover, we found that this product can exist under different crystal-<br>
line forms and that these forms can be obtained by using the same<br>
stereoselective process with the addition of further dissolution and<br>
precipitation steps carried out in appropriate different solvent mix-<br>
tures.<br>
Therefore the main object of the present invention is a process for the<br>
stereoselective preparation of 7-[(E)-t-butyloxyiminomethyl]-campto-<br>
thecin comprising reacting an acetal of 7-formyl-camptothecin with O-<br>
t-butylhydroxylamine hydrochloride in a polar protic or aprotic organic<br>
solvent, preferably under acidic conditions (pH
found that the amount of Z isomer is proportional to the amount of<br>
base (for example pyridine) added. Therefore the process of the present<br>
invention must be carried out in the absence of an organic base,  in par-<br>
ticular, in the absence of pyridine.<br>
Different embodiments and variations of the above process are com-<br>
prised in the present invention.<br><br>
WO 2006/067092	PCT/EP2005/056849<br>
6<br>
Preferably, the polar protic or aprotic organic solvent is an alcohol,<br>
such as methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, i-propanol, n-butanol, i-<br>
butanol. More preferably, it is ethanol or methanol.<br>
The pH is preferably acidic, but it can be brought to higher values<br>
(close but not equal to 7) with the addition of an inorganic base. Pref-<br>
erably, the inorganic base is sodium or potassium hydroxide. Prefera-<br>
bly, the inorganic base is added in a molar ratio of 0.5-0.9:1 with re-<br>
spect to the hydroxylamine hydrochloride.<br>
The acetal of 7-formyl-camptothecin is a dialkyl acetal, preferably<br>
methyl or ethyl acetal.<br>
The temperature of the reaction is usually comprised between room<br>
temperature and solvent boiling point.<br>
At the end of the reaction the precipitate is isolated from the reaction<br>
mixture, for example by filtration.<br>
According to the process of the present invention, the E isomer is al-<br>
ways obtained in a ratio of at least 95:5 with respect to the Z isomer.<br>
The Examples show that the process of the invention allows to obtain<br>
the E isomer up to a ratio of 99.8:0.2 with respect to the Z isomer.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention the above-<br>
described process comprises further steps, such as dissolving the pre-<br>
cipitate previously obtained in dichloromethane, adding a co-solvent,<br>
concentrating the solution obtained and crystallizing the product thus<br>
obtained.<br>
	Depending on the co-solvent used,different crystalline formsare ob-<br>
tained as follows.<br>

These new crystalline forms I, II and III of gimatecan are further ob-<br>
jects of the present invention. Crystalline form I of gimatecan is pre-<br>
ferred.<br>
Amorphous form I of gimatecan is a further object of the present in-<br>
vention.<br>
Another object of the present invention is the use of any crystalline<br>
form I, II, III of gimatecan, or a mixture thereof, as medicaments, in<br>
particular for the preparation of a medicament for treating pathologi-<br>
cal states which arise from or are exacerbated by cell proliferation.<br>
A further object of the present invention are compositions, in particu-<br>
lar pharmaceutical compositions, comprising at least one of the above-<br>
mentioned crystalline forms as active ingredient, the pharmaceutical<br>
compositions being in admixture with at least one pharmaceutically<br><br>
WO 2006/067092	PCT/EP2005/056849<br>
11<br>
acceptable carrier and/or diluent. In addition, pharmaceutical composi-<br>
tions of the present invention can contain also one or more pharmaceu-<br>
tically acceptable excipients.<br>
Gimatecan shows an antiproliferative activity, therefore its crystalline<br>
forms are useful for their therapeutical activity, and possess physico-<br>
chemical properties that make them suitable to be formulated in<br>
pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions comprise at least one of the above-<br>
mentioned crystalline forms of gimatecan, in an amount such as to<br>
produce a significant therapeutical effect, in particular antitumoral ef-<br>
fect. The compositions comprised within the present invention are con-<br>
ventional and are obtained with commonly used methods in the phar-<br>
maceutical industry. According to the desired administration route,<br>
the compositions shall be in solid or liquid form, suitable to the oral,<br>
parenteral, intravenous route. The compositions according to the pre-<br>
sent invention comprise together with the active ingredients at least a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle or excipient. Formulation co-<br>
adjuvants, for example solubilizing, dispersing, suspending, emul-<br>
sionation agents can be particularly useful.<br>
The above-mentioned crystalline forms of gimatecan can also be used<br>
in combination with other active ingredients, for example other anti-<br>
tumor drugs, both in separate forms, and in a single dose form.<br>
The above-mentioned crystalline forms of gimatecan according to the<br>
present invention are useful as medicaments with antitumor activity,<br>
for example in lung tumors, such as the non-small cell lung tumour,<br>
tumors of the colon-rectum, prostate, gliomas.<br>
Cytotoxic activity is assayed in cell systems of human tumour cells, us-<br>
ing the antiproliferative activity test as a method of evaluation of the<br>
cytotoxic potential.<br><br>

These and other objects of the present invention shall be illustrated in<br>
detail also by means of the following Examples.<br>
The following examples further illustrate the invention.<br>
Introduction<br>
Example 1 and 2 deal with the synthesis of 7-[(E)-t-butyloxyiminome-<br>
thyl]-camptothecin employing 7-formyl-camptothecin dimethylacetal<br>
as starting material.<br>
Examples 3 and 4 report the synthesis of 7-[(E)-t-butyloxyiminome-<br>
thyl]-camptothecin employing 7-formyl-camptothecin as starting mate-<br>
rial under conditions that afforded the E isomer. All the reactions of<br>
this group are faster then the reactions reported in Examples 1 and 2,<br>
indicating that hydrolysis of the acetal is plausibly slower than the re-<br>
action of the aldehyde to give the oxime.<br>
Example 5 reports the conversion of the Z isomer into the E isomer.<br>
Example 6 reports the synthesis and the characterization of the differ-<br>
ent (polymorphic) crystalline forms that can be obtained for 7-[(E)-t-<br>
butyloxyiminomethyl] -camptothecin (gimatecan).<br>
HPLC: the analyses are carried out on an instrument equipped with a<br>
quaternary pump (Waters Alliance 2690) with automatic injector (in-<br>
