				<td>Sliding Device for a Pump and Wear Bar for the same<br>
Description<br>
The invention relates to a sliding device for a pump with two conveying cylinders<br>
working in push-pull operation, for conveying thick substances that are fed to a pump<br>
through a material feeding container, with a largely C-shaped bent swing pipe gripping<br>
into the material feeding container and which is connected at its upper end to a conveying<br>
pipe through a pipe rotary joint and is limited in a pivoted manner against it around the<br>
axis of the pipe rotary joint and whose other end can be alternately connected to the<br>
openings of the conveying cylinders, and which can be supported on the side of the<br>
material feeding container lying opposite to the conveying cylinder with a pressure plate<br>
against a wear bar arranged in the interior side of the material feeding container and is in<br>
contact in a sliding manner during the swinging sequence. The invention further relates<br>
to a wear bar for such a sliding device.<br>
Sliding devices of this type (DE-C-21 62 406) are particularly suited for automobile<br>
concrete pumps on account of their compact design, in which the end of the swing pipe<br>
protruding above the rear wall of the material feeding container forms a connection to the<br>
conveying pipe, if required, through an extension pipe; this conveying pipe is guided<br>
through a distributor mast resting on the front portion of the chassis. The parts of the<br>
sliding device subjected to high wear are easily accessible from the upper side of the<br>
material feeding container and can therefore be replaced easily. The wear bars of the<br>
known sliding devices of this type have a longitudinally stretched and largely rectangular<br>
outline. On their width side towards the inner side of the material feeding container, the<br>
wear bar is provided with an abrasion-proof coating. Besides, precautionary measures<br>
are taken, that allow an adjustment on the side of the wear bar according to the wear<br>
occurring in the sliding device. During operation of known sliding devices it has been<br>
seen that, on account of the non-uniform wear over the sliding length and breadth of the<br>
wear bar, gradually a wave-shaped or ramp-type surface run gets formed on the sliding<br>
surface or the pressing surface of the wear bar, that can lead to jerky movements or<br>
jamming during reverse sequence of the swing pipe.<br><br><br>
Based on this, it is the task of this invention to develop a sliding device of the<br>
type mentioned above and a wear bar for the same that allows a uniform erosion<br>
of the material coating subjected to wear and thus ensures a jerk-free operation.<br>
The solution according to the invention is mainly based on the idea that the wear<br>
bar has a sliding surface and a pressing surface with an effective sliding length<br>
for the pressure plate corresponding to the swing of the swing pipe, and has a<br>
sliding width at its ends corresponding to the diameter of the pressure plate and<br>
a sliding width that gets reduced in its central region towards the centre.<br>
Through these measures it is achieved that uniform material erosion takes place<br>
during the life-span over the entire sliding and pressing surface. Importance is to<br>
be given thereby to the knowledge that the sliding and pressing surface has to be<br>
adapted in its size and shape to the swinging range of the pressure plate<br>
arranged on the swing pipe and that in the central region, in which only sliding<br>
friction occurs in case of slight pressing force, altogether lesser material gets<br>
eroded.<br>
Accordingly, the wear bar has an effective sliding and pressing surface for the<br>
pressure plate with a longitudinally stretched outline that is wider at its ends<br>
than in its central region. Ideally, the sliding and pressing surface has in its<br>
central region a concave outline binding on both its sides, whereby starting from<br>
its effective end over its sliding length of at least 1.5 times the diameter of the<br>
pressure plate it initially still has a constant sliding width. A preferred extension<br>
of the invention foresees that the sliding width of the sliding and pressing<br>
surface is lesser in the central region than the pressure plate diameter, whereby<br>
at the centre of the wear bar the sliding width should preferably be lesser than<br>
0.7 times the pressure plate diameter. An advantageous extension of the<br>
invention foresees that at the ends of the wear bar fastening straps or mounting.<br><br><br>
attachments are moulded, that are staggered with respect to the sliding and pressing<br>
surface at least by the thickness of the abrasion-proof material coating provided there.<br>
The invention is explained in details below through diagrams and drawings of a design<br>
example. The following are shown:<br>
Fig. 1	A cut-out of a two-cylinder thick substance pump in partially broken up<br>
depiction;<br>
Fig.2	An explosion depiction of the swing pipe of the two-cylinder thick<br>
substance pump shown in fig. 1;<br>
Fig.3a and b A top view and a partially sectioned side view of the wear bar.<br>
The two-cylinder thick substance pump shown in the drawing is mainly meant for use in<br>
automobile concrete pumps. It mainly comprises of two conveying cylinders 10 with<br>
hydraulic plungers driven in push-pull operation, a material feeding container 14 and a<br>
sliding device 20 with a C-shaped swing pipe 16 gripping into the material feeding<br>
container 14 from above and which can be activated by a reversible mechanism 18. The<br>
conveying cylinders 10 are connected through openings 22 to the rear wall 24 of the<br>
material feeding container 14, whereby the openings 22 on the inner side of the material<br>
feeding container 14 are limited by a spectacles-shaped wear plate 26. The swing pipe 16<br>
with its lower end supporting a wear ring 28 lies against the wear plate 26 and by means<br>
of the reversible mechanism 18 in relation to the movement direction of the plungers 12<br>
in the conveying cylinders 10, is swung alternately before the one or the other opening<br>
22. In this way, with the back movement of the plunger 12 indicated by the arrow 13,<br>
material from the material feeding container 14 is suctioned in the direction of the arrow<br>
32 through the free opening 22 into the corresponding conveying cylinder 10, while<br>
through the other plunger 12 material is transported in the direction indicated by the<br>
arrows 34, 36, 38 through the swing pipe 16 into a conveying pipe situated behind the<br>
rear wall 24 of the material feeding container 14. For this purpose, the swing pipe 16 is<br>
connected through a flange 40 to an extension pipe 42, which again is connected through<br>
a pipe rotary joint 43 to the conveying pipe leading to a concrete distributor mast.<br><br><br>
The flange 40 is connected in a detachable manner by means of two clamping screws 44<br>
to the reversing lever 46 of the reversing mechanism 18 that has at its lower ends bearing<br>
points 48 pointing to opposite sides and designed as spherical pans for connecting one of<br>
the piston-side ball head 50 of both driving cylinders 52. On the cylinder side the drive<br>
cylinders 52 are supported with another ball head 54 in a conveying cylinder-fixed, as<br>
bearing position 56 designed as ball pan.<br>
In order to ensure a tight contact of the lower end of the swing pipe 16 against the wear<br>
plate 26, a force acting perpendicular to the rear wall 24 of the material feeding container<br>
is exercised on the lower arm 80 of the swing pipe 16 by an adjusting screw 62 that can<br>
be activated form outside. During the pumping sequence, the wear ring is additionally<br>
pressed against the respective opening edge of the wear plate 26 by means of hydrostatic<br>
forces within the swing pipe 16. The lower arm 80 of the swing pipe 16 supports at its<br>
side towards the wear bar 82, a pressure plate 84 which lies against the sliding and<br>
pressing surface 86 of the wear bar 82 pointing towards the inner side of the material<br>
feeding container 14. As one can especially seen from fig. 3a, the effective sliding and<br>
pressing surface 86 of the wear bar 82 has a longitudinally stretched outline that is wider<br>
at its ends 88 than in its central region 90. The sliding and pressing surface 86 formed by<br>
an abrasion-proof material coating 100 that protrudes above the corresponding plate<br>
levels 92. In the region of both ends 88, the edge 94 of the effective sliding and pressing<br>
surface 86 pointing outwards is bent in a circular shape, with a bending radius that<br>
approx. corresponds to the radius of the circular pressure plate 84. Starting from the<br>
outer edge 94, the sliding and pressing surface 86 initially has for some distance a<br>
constant sliding width be in the region of the end 88 corresponding to the diameter of the<br>
pressure plate 84. Subsequently the sliding width bm reduces in the central region 90<br>
towards the centre along two concave edge lines 96 by half. With these measures it is<br>
achieved that the wear over the entire sliding and pressing surface 86 takes place<br>
uniformly while swinging the swing pipe 16, so that no waves or ramps get formed along<br>
the sliding and pressing surface 86.<br><br>
At the ends 88, opposite to the sliding and pressing surface 86, mounting attachments 98<br>
are moulded in a shifted back position, that rectangularly border the wear bar 82.<br>
One can sum up as follows: the invention relates to a sliding device for a pump with two<br>
conveying cylinders working in push-pull operation, for conveying thick substances, with<br>
a largely C-shaped bent swing pipe gripping a material feeding container; the swing pipe<br>
can be supported in the lower region with a pressure plate 84 against a wear bar 82<br>
arranged in the material feeding container, and which comes into sliding contact with it<br>
on swinging the swing pipes. In order to ensure a uniform abrasion of the wear bar 82<br>
over the entire sliding and pressing surface, the invention suggests that its effective<br>
sliding and pressing surface 86 has a longitudinally stretched outline for the pressure<br>
plate 84; this outline is wider at the ends 88 than in the central region 90.<br><br>
