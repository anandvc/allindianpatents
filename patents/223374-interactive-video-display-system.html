CROSS-REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[01] This application claims priority from co-pending U.S. Provisional Patent Application<br>
No. 60/296,189 filed June 5,2001 entitled INTERACTIVE VIDEO DISPLAY SYSTEM<br>
THAT USES VIDEO INPUT which is hereby incorporated by reference, as if set forth in full<br>
in this document, for all purposes.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[02] The present invention relates in general to image processing systems and more<br>
specifically to a system for receiving and processing an image of a human user to allow<br>
interaction with video displays.<br>
[03] Image processing is used in many areas of analysis, education, commerce and<br>
entertainment. One aspect of image processing includes human-computer interaction by<br>
detecting human forms and movements to allow interaction with images. Applications of<br>
such processing can use efficient or entertaining ways of interacting with images to define<br>
digital shapes or other data, animate objects, create expressive forms, etc.<br>
[04] Detecting the position and movement of a human body is referred to as "motion<br>
capture." With motion capture techniques, mathematical descriptions of a human<br>
performer's movements are input to a computer or other processing system. Natural body<br>
movements can be used as inputs to the computer to study athletic movement, capture data<br>
for later playback or simulation, enhance analysis for medical purposes, etc.<br>
[05] Although motion capture provides benefits and advantages, motion capture techniques<br>
tend to be complex. Some techniques require the human actor to wear special suits with<br>
high-visibility points at several locations. Other approaches use radio-frequency or other<br>
types of emitters, multiple sensors and detectors, blue-screens, extensive post-processing, etc.<br>
Techniques that rely on simple visible-light image capture are usually not accurate enough to<br>
provide well-defined and precise motion capture.<br>
[06] Some motion capture applications allow an actor, or user, to interact with images that<br>
are created and displayed by a computer system. For example, an actor may stand in front of<br>
a large video screen projection of several objects. The actor can move, or otherwise generate,<br>
modify, and manipulate, the objects by using body movements. Different effects based on<br>
an actor's movements can be computed by the processing system and displayed on the<br>
display screen. For example, the computer system can track a path of the actor in front of the<br>
display screen and render an approximation, or artistic interpretation, of the path onto the<br>
display screen. The images with which the actor interacts can be e.g., on the floor, wall or<br>
other surface; suspended three-dimensionally in space, displayed on one or more monitors,<br>
projection screens or other devices. Any type of display device or technology can be used to<br>
present images with which a user can control or interact<br>
[07] In some applications, such as point-of-sale, retail advertising, promotions, arcade<br>
entertainment sites, etc., it is desirable to capture the motion of an untrained user (e.g., a<br>
person passing by) in a very unobtrusive way. Ideally, the user will not need special<br>
preparation or training and the system will not use unduly expensive equipment. Also, the<br>
method and system used to motion capture the actor should, preferably, be invisible or<br>
undetectable to the user. Many real-world applications must work in environments where<br>
there are complex and changing background and foreground objects, short time intervals for<br>
the capture, changing lighting conditions and other factors that can make motion capture<br>
difficult<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[08] The present invention permits interaction between a user and a computer display<br>
system using the user's (or another object's) movement and position as input to a computer.<br>
The computer generates a display that responds to the user's position and movement The<br>
generated display can include objects or shapes that can be moved, modified, or otherwise<br>
controlled by a user's body movements.<br>
[09] In a preferred embodiment of the invention, displayed images are affected by a user's<br>
actions in real-time. The display can be projected around the user so that that the user's<br>
actions create effects that emanate from the user and affect display areas proximate to the<br>
user. Or the user can affect video objects such as by kicking, pushing, moving, deforming,<br>
touching, etc., items in video images. Interference between light used to display interactive<br>
images and light used to detect the user is minimized by using light of substantially different<br>
wavelengths.<br>
[10] In one embodiment, a user is illuminated with infrared light that is not visible to the<br>
human eye. A camera that is sensitive to infrared light is used to capture an image of the<br>
user for position and motion analysis. Visible light is projected by a projector onto a screen,<br>
glass or other surface to display interactive images, objects, patterns or other shapes and<br>
effects. The display surface can be aligned around the user so that their physical presence<br>
within the display corresponds to their virtual presence, giving the experience of physically<br>
touching and interacting with virtual objects.<br>
[11] One aspect of the invention can use patterned illumination instead of a simple, non-<br>
visible, uniform "floodlight." With patterned illumination, a pattern, such as a checkerboard,<br>
random dot pattern, etc., is projected. The pattern is used by processes executing on a<br>
computer to interpret a camera image and to detect an object from a background and/or other<br>
items in a scene. The pattern can be generated as a background (so that it does not impinge<br>
upon an object to be detected) or the pattern can be projected over all of the camera's<br>
viewable scene so that it illuminates background, foreground and objects to be detected and<br>
motion captured.<br>
[12] One way to achieve the patterned illumination includes using an infrared LED cluster<br>
or other non-visible light source in a slide projector. Another approach could use an infrared<br>
laser beam that is deflected, shuttered, scanned, etc., to produce a pattern.<br>
[13] Another way to achieve the patterned illumination is to use a regular "floodlight", but<br>
mark the aforementioned pattern onto the camera's viewable area using ink, dye, or paint that<br>
is either dark or highly reflective in the camera's receptive frequency. This ink, dye, or paint<br>
can be made invisible to the human eye so as to improve the aesthetics of the display.<br>
[14] Another aspect of the invention uses a gradient approach to determine object - image<br>
interaction. An "influence image" is created by creating a gradient aura, or gray scale<br>
transition, around a detected object. As the detected object moves, the gradient aura is<br>
calculated in real time. As the gradient aura impinges upon a video image or item, the<br>
brightness and gradient in the region of the impinged item is calculated. The strength and<br>
direction of interaction (e.g., a pushing of the item) is a function of the brightness and<br>
gradient, respectively, of the impinged region.<br>
[15] In one embodiment the invention provides a system for detecting an object and<br>
generating a display in response, the system comprising a first source, for outputting<br>
electromagnetic energy in a first wavelength range, a detector for detecting a reflection of the<br>
first source of electromagnetic energy from an object, a processor coupled to the detector for<br>
using the detected reflection to generate a display signal, a second source, for outputing<br>
electromagnetic energy at a second wavelength range, wherein the second source generates a<br>
visible display in response to the display signal, wherein the first and second wavelength<br>
ranges are different.<br>
[16] In another embodiment the invention provides a method for detecting an object in an<br>
image captured with a camera, the method comprising using a patterned illumination to<br>
illuminate a background differently from the object; and using a processing system to define<br>
the object apart from the background.<br>
[17] In another embodiment the invention provides a method for computing an interaction<br>
of an object with a video item, the method comprising using a processor to determine a<br>
gradient for the object; using a processor to determine a boundary for the video item; and<br>
identifying an interaction by using the gradient and the boundary.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[28] Several configurations of the invention are described below. In general, the present<br>
invention uses a first light source to illuminate a user, or another object. The first light source<br>
uses light that is not visible to humans. For example, infrared or ultraviolet light can be used.<br>
A camera that is sensitive to light at the wavelength range of the first light source is used to<br>
detect a user who is illuminated by the first light source. A computer (or other processing<br>
system) is used to process the detected object image and to generate images for display. A<br>
second light source (e.g., a projector, video screen, etc.) is used to display the generated<br>
display images to a human user or viewers. The displayed images are at wavelengths that<br>
minimize interference with the camera's object detection. Typically, the visible spectrum is<br>
used to display the images.<br>
[29] In a preferred embodiment, the display surrounds the user such that the user's virtual<br>
presence is aligned with the user's physical presence. Thus, the virtual scene on the display<br>
has a physical location around the user, and the user's movement within the display will<br>
cause identical movement of the user's representation within the virtual scene. For example,<br>
the user can impinge on a virtual object's physical location and know that this will cause their<br>
virtual representation to touch the virtual object in the computer system. The use of the term<br>
"touch" or 'touching" in this specification does not mean physical contact with an object,<br>
such as a person, and an image item. Rather the notion of touching means that the object's<br>
position and action in physical space is translated into an effect in a generated image,<br>
including effects of moving items in the generated images.<br>
[30] Displayed images or items can include objects, patterns, shapes or any visual pattern,<br>
effect, etc. Aspects of the invention can be used for applications such as interactive lighting<br>
effects for people at clubs or events, interactive advertising displays, characters and virtual<br>
objects that react to the movements of passers-by, interactive ambient lighting for public<br>
spaces such as restaurants, shopping malls, sports venues, retail stores, lobbies and parks,<br>
video game systems, and interactive informational displays. Other applications are possible<br>
and are within the scope of the invention.<br>
[31] Fig. 1 shows a front-projection embodiment of the invention using a co-located<br>
camera and projector. In Fig. 1, a person 1 is illuminated by an infrared (or other non-visible<br>
light) lamp 2. The image of the person is photographed by an infrared (or other non-visible<br>
light) camera 3. This signal is transmitted real-time 4 to computer 5. The computer performs<br>
the object detection algorithm, and generates the video effect in real time. The effect is<br>
transmitted 6 real-time to video projector 7. The projector projects the resulting image onto a<br>
screen 8 or some other surface. The video effect is then displayed 9 on the screen, in real<br>
time, and aligned with the person.<br>
[32] Fig. 2 shows an overhead projection configuration of the system. Component 10<br>
includes the aforementioned system. Component 10 is shown mounted vertically here, but<br>
the camera, projector, and light source within 10 can also be mounted horizontally and men<br>
redirected downwards with a mirror. A person moving on the ground 11 can have the video<br>
signal projected onto the ground around them 12. The person's own shadow obscures a<br>
minimal amount of the image when the projector is directly overhead.<br>
[33] Figs. 3 and 4 show two more alternate configurations for the camera and projector. In<br>
both figures, camera 20 captures objects such as a person 22 in front of a screen 23. The<br>
angle viewed by the camera is shown at 21. In Fig. 3 projector 25 is placed behind the<br>
screen. The cast light from projector 24 can be seen on the screen from both sides. In Fig. 4,<br>
projector 25 is at an oblique angle to the screen; its light cone 24 is shown. Both of these<br>
configurations make it more likely that mere are no shadows obstructing the projected image.<br>
[34] As described in the configurations, above, a video camera is used to capture the scene<br>
at a particular location for input into the computer. In most configurations of the device, the<br>
camera views part of the output video display. To prevent unwanted video feedback, the<br>
camera can operate at a wavelength that is not used by the video display. In most cases, the<br>
display will use the visible light spectrum. In this case, the camera must photograph in a non-<br>
visible wavelength, such as infrared, so that the video display output is not detected.<br>
[35] The scene being videotaped must be illuminated in light of the camera's wavelength.<br>
In the case of infrared, sources including sunlight, a heat lamp or infrared LEDs can be used<br>
to illuminate the scene. These lights can be positioned anywhere; however, the camera's<br>
view of spurious shadows from these lights can be minimized by placing the light source in<br>
proximity to the camera. A light source, such as one or more lights, can illuminate objects<br>
with a uniform lighting, as opposed to the patterned illumination discussed, below. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the video signal is exported in real-time to the computer. However,<br>
other embodiments need not achieve real-time or near-real-time and can process object or<br>
video images (i.e., display images) at times considerably prior to displaying the images.<br>
[36] This component is designed to be modular, any computer software that utilizes the<br>
video input from the previous component and outputs the results to a video display can be<br>
used here.<br>
[37] Most instances of this component will have two parts: the first part handles the<br>
detection of mobile objects from static background, while the second part utilizes the object<br>
information to generate a video output. Numerous instances of each part will be described<br>
here; these instances are simply meant to be examples, and are by no means exhaustive.<br>
[38] In the first part, the live image from the video camera is processed real-time in order<br>
to separate mobile objects (e.g. people) from the static background, regardless of what the<br>
background is. The processing can be done as follows:<br>
[39] First, input frames from the video camera are converted to grayscale to reduce the<br>
amount of data and to simplify the detection process. Next, they may be blurred slightly to<br>
reduce noise.<br>
[40] Any object that does not move over a long period of time is presumed to be<br>
background; therefore, the system is able to eventually adapt to changing lighting or<br>
background conditions. A model image of the background can be generated by numerous<br>
methods, each of which examines the input frames over a range of time. In one method, the<br>
last several input frames (or a subset thereof) are examined to generate a model of the<br>
background, either through averaging, generating the median, detecting periods of constant<br>
brightness, or other heuristics. The length of time over which the input frames are examined<br>
determines the rate at which the model of the background adapts to changes in the input<br>
image.<br>
[41] In another method, the background model is generated at each time step (or more<br>
infrequently) by computing a weighted average of the current frame and the background<br>
model from the previous time step. The weight of the current frame is relatively small in this<br>
calculation; thus, changes in the real background are gradually assimilated into the<br>
background model. This weight can be tuned to change the rate at which the background<br>
model adapts to changes in the input image.<br>
[42] An object of interest is presumed to differ in brightness from the background. In<br>
order to find objects at each time step, the current video input is subtracted from the model<br>
image of the background. If the absolute value of this difference at a particular location is<br>
larger than a particular threshold, then that location is classified as an object; otherwise, it is<br>
classified as background.<br>
[43] The second part can be any program that takes the object/background classification of<br>
an image (possibly in addition to other data) as input, and outputs a video image based on this<br>
input, possibly in real time. This program can take on an infinite number of forms, and is<br>
thus as broadly defined as a computer application. For example, this component could be as<br>
simple as producing a spotlight in the shape of the detected objects, or as complicated as a<br>
paint program controlled through gestures made by people who are detected as objects. In<br>
addition, applications could use other forms of input, such as sound, temperature, keyboard<br>
input etc. as well as additional forms of output, such as audio, tactile, virtual reality, aromatic,<br>
etc.<br>
[44] One major class of applications includes special effects that use the<br>
object/background classification as input. For example, stars, lines, or other shapes could be<br>
drawn in the output video image in a random portion of the locations that were classified as<br>
"object". These shapes could then be set to gradually fade away over time, so that people<br>
leave transient trails of shapes behind them as they move around. The following are<br>
examples of other effects in the same class:<br>
[45] - contours and ripples surrounding the objects<br>
[46] - a grid which is deformed by the presence of objects<br>
[47] - simulations of flame and wind, and other matrix convolutions applied to<br>
objects<br>
[48] - special effects that pulse to the beat of the music, which is detected<br>
separately<br>
[49] Another major class of applications allows the real objects to interact with virtual<br>
objects and characters. For example, an image showing a group of ducklings could be<br>
programmed to follow behind any real object (e.g. a person) that walks in front of the display.<br>
[50] In addition, computer games that can be played by people moving in front of the<br>
camera form another class of applications.<br>
[51] However, this list is not exclusive; this component is designed to be programmable,<br>
and thus can run any application.<br>
[52] The output of the processing software from the previous component is displayed<br>
visually. Possible displays include, but are not limited to video projectors, televisions,<br>
plasma displays, and laser shows. The displayed image can be aligned with the video<br>
camera's input range so that the video effects align with the locations of the people causing<br>
them. Since some configurations of the video camera can detect objects in non-visible light,<br>
the problem of the display interfering with the camera is avoided.<br>
[53] There are numerous possible configurations for the different components. For<br>
example, the camera and a video projector can be in the same location and pointed in the<br>
same direction The camera and projector can then be pointed at a wall as shown in Fig. 1,<br>
pointed at the ground, redirected with a mirror as shown in Fig. 2, or pointed at any other<br>
surface. Alternatively, the projector could be placed behind the screen as shown in Fig. 3 so<br>
that the display is identical to the one in Fig. 1, but the person is no longer in the way of the<br>
projection, so they do not cast a shadow. The shadow could also be avoided by placing the<br>
projector at an oblique angle to the screen as shown in Fig. 4. The video display could also<br>
be a large-screen TV, plasma display, or video wall. While the aforementioned<br>
configurations all have the video display lined up with the video input, this is not necessary;<br>
the video display could be placed anywhere. The preceding list is not exhaustive; mere are<br>
numerous additional possible configurations.<br>
[54] The overall system can be networked, allowing vision information and processing<br>
software state information to be exchanged between systems. Thus an object detected in the<br>
vision signal of one system can affect the processing software in another system. In addition,<br>
a virtual item in the display of one system could move to other systems. If the displays of<br>
multiple systems are aligned together so that they form a single larger display, then the<br>
multiple systems can be made to function as if they were a single very large system, with<br>
objects and interactions moving seamlessly across display boundaries.<br>
[55] One common problem with the vision system is that, in cases where there is<br>
uncontrollable ambient illumination (e.g. sunlight) of the camera's viewable area from a<br>
significantly different angle than the camera, objects cast shadows onto the background. If<br>
these shadows are strong enough, the vision system may mistake them for objects. These<br>
shadows can be detected and removed by strobing the camera's light source. By subtracting<br>
a camera input image with ambient light alone from a camera input image with both the<br>
ambient light and the camera's light, the system yields an image that captures the scene as if<br>
only the camera's light were being used, thus eliminating the detectable shadows from the<br>
ambient light.<br>
[56] Additional accuracy in detecting objects with the images captured by the camera can<br>
be obtained by using patterned illumination or patterned markings.<br>
[57] One shortcoming of using a simple floodlight illumination system for computer vision<br>
is that if the colors of objects being viewed by the camera are very similar, then the objects<br>
can be very difficult to detect. If the camera operates in monochrome it is much more likely<br>
for the object and background to look the same.<br>
[58] Using a patterned object to cover camera's viewable area can improve object<br>
detection. If a pattern that contains two or more colors intermingled in close proximity is<br>
used, it is highly unlikely that other objects will have a similar look since at least one color of<br>
the pattern will look different from the color of surrounding objects. If a patterned object,<br>
such as a screen, is used as a background before which are the objects to be detected, then<br>
objects that pass in front of the patterned screen are more easily detected by the vision<br>
algorithm.<br>
[59] For example, in an infrared vision application the patterned object could be a<br>
background mat that appears white to the human eye, but contains a light &amp; dark checkered<br>
pattern that is invisible to the human eye but visible to the camera. By using a pattern that is<br>
not in the visible light spectrum, the patterned mat will not interfere with the aesthetics of the<br>
system. The display system (e.g., projection video) can project output images onto the mat,<br>
as described above. A process executing on a processing system such as a computer system<br>
can be provided with the background pattern, thus making detection of an object in front of<br>
the mat easier, although the system could learn the patterned background in the same way<br>
that the vision algorithm learns any other background. Also, the ability of the system to adapt<br>
to changes in background light brightness would not be adversely affected.<br>
[60] A patterned illumination can also be projected from a light source onto the camera's<br>
viewable area. As long as the camera and invisible light source are in different, offset<br>
locations, parallax effects will cause the camera's view of the projected pattern to be distorted<br>
as objects move through the camera's viewing area. This distortion helps make objects that<br>
have similar colors stand out from each other. If the difference between the two images seen<br>
by the camera is taken, the result will show the shape of any object that has appeared,<br>
disappeared, or moved between the two images. If the image of an object in front of the<br>
background is subtracted from an image of the background alone, the result is an image that<br>
is zero where there is background and nonzero where there are other objects. This technique<br>
can be used in combination with other aspects of the invention discussed, herein.<br>
[61] A patterned light source can be achieved through several means. One method is to<br>
use an infrared light-emitting diode (LED) cluster or another non-visible light source in a<br>
slide projector. A set of lenses would be used to focus the light source through a slide<br>
containing the desired pattern, thus casting the pattern's image onto the camera's viewing<br>
area. In another method, an infrared laser beam could be shined onto a laser pattern generator<br>
or other scattering device in order to produce a light pattern on the camera's viewing area.<br>
Light can be deflected, shuttered, scanned, etc., in order to achieve a pattern. Many other<br>
approaches are possible.<br>
[62] A patterned tight source is also useful for 3-D computer vision. 3-D computer vision<br>
techniques such as the Marr-Poggio algorithm take as input two images of the same scene<br>
taken from slightly different angles. The patterns on the images are matched up to determine<br>
the amount of displacement, and hence the distance from the camera, at each point in the<br>
image. The performance of this algorithm degrades when dealing with objects of uniform<br>
color because uniform color makes it difficult to match up the corresponding sections in the<br>
image pair. Thus, the patterned light source can improve the distance estimates of some 3D<br>
computer vision algorithms.<br>
[63] The two input images to these 3-D vision algorithms are usually generated using a<br>
pair of cameras pointed at the scene. However, it would also be possible to use only one<br>
camera. The second image could be an entirely undistorted version of the projected pattern,<br>
which is known ahead of time. This image of the pattern is essentially identical to what a<br>
second camera would see if it were placed at the exact same location as the patterned light<br>
source. Thus, the single camera's view and the projected pattern together could be used as an<br>
input to the 3-D vision algorithm. Alternatively, the second image could be an image of the<br>
background alone, taken from the same camera.<br>
[64] While many different kinds of patterns can be used, a high-resolution random dot<br>
pattern has certain advantages for both 2-D and 3-D vision. Due to the randomness of the dot<br>
pattern, each significantly sized section of the dot pattern is highly unlikely to look like any<br>
other section of the pattern. Thus, the displaced pattern caused by the presence of an object<br>
in the viewing area is highly unlikely to look similar to the pattern without the object there.<br>
This maximizes the ability of the vision algorithm to detect displacements in the pattern, and<br>
therefore objects. Using a regular pattern such as a grid can cause some difficulty because<br>
different sections of the pattern are identical, causing the displaced pattern to often look like<br>
the non-displaced pattern.<br>
[65] Figs. 5A-D show the usefulness of a random dot pattern in detecting an object. Fig.<br>
5 A shows a picture of a person under normal illumination. The person has a similar<br>
brightness to the background, making detection difficult. In Fig. 5B, a random dot pattern is<br>
projected onto the background from a light source near the camera. When the person stands<br>
in front of this pattern, the pattern reflected off of the person is displaced, as shown in Fig.<br>
5C. By taking the difference between the images in Figs. 5B and 5C, the image of Fig. 5D is<br>
obtained which defines the image area of the person with a strong signal.<br>
[66] Other approaches can be used to improve object detection. For example, a light<br>
source can be "strobed" or turned on-and-off periodically so that detection of shadows due to<br>
other light sources (e.g., ambient light) is made easier.<br>
[67] Once an object has been detected and defined the preferred embodiment uses a<br>
gradient aura to determine degree and direction of interaction of the object with a displayed<br>
image item.<br>
[68] Fig. 6A shows a human user interacting with a video object.<br>
[69] In Fig. 6A, object 304 has been detected and is shown in outline form. One<br>
representation of the object within a computer's processing can use the outline definition<br>
depicted in Fig. 6A. Video screen 302 displays several image items, such as image 306 of a<br>
ball.<br>
[70] Fig. 6B illustrates an influence image for the region of 308 of Fig. 6 A.<br>
[71] In Fig. 6B, the outline image of the user's foot 320 and lower leg are used to generate<br>
successively larger outline areas. The original outline area 320's region is assigned a large<br>
pixel brightness value corresponding to white. Each successive outline area, 322,324,326,<br>
328,330 is assigned a progressively lower value so that a point farther away from the initial<br>
outline (white) area will have a lower pixel value. Note that any number of outline areas can<br>
be used. Also, the size and increments of outline areas can vary, as desired. For example, it<br>
is possible to use a continuous gradient, rather than discrete areas. The collection of all<br>
outline areas is referred to as the "influence image."<br>
[72] The influence image is compared to different image items. In Fig. 6B, ball item 306<br>
impinges upon gradient areas 326, 328 and 330. As is known in the art, direction lines are<br>
determined in the direction of the gradient of the pixel value field for the impinged areas.<br>
Fig. 6B shows three example direction lines within item 306. The direction lines can be<br>
combined, e.g., by averaging, or a select single line can be used. The processing also detects<br>
that the brightest outline area impinged by the item is outline area 326. Other approaches are<br>
possible. For example, the brightness and gradient can be averaged over every point in the<br>
area of the image item, or on a subset of those points. Also, some embodiments can include<br>
duration of contact as a factor in addition to the brightness and gradient.<br>
[73] The interaction between an object, such as a person, and an item on the screen is<br>
computed using both the brightness of impinged outline areas and the direction as computed<br>
using one or more direction lines. The impinged brightness corresponds to the strength with<br>
which the user is "touching" the item. The gradient corresponds to the direction in (or from,<br>
depending on die sign of the calculation) which the item is being touched.<br>
[74] Although the invention has been discussed with reference to specific embodiments<br>
thereof, these embodiments are illustrative, not restrictive, of the invention. For example,<br>
although the preferred embodiments use a camera as a detector, different types of detection<br>
devices can be employed. The camera can be digital or analog. A stereo camera could be<br>
used in order to provide depth information as well as position. In cases where processing and<br>
display are not done in real time, film and other types of media can be used and followed up<br>
by a digital conversion before inputting the data to a processor. Light sensors or detectors<br>
can be used. For example, an array of photodetectors can be used in place of a camera.<br>
Other detectors not contemplated herein can be used with suitable results.<br>
[75] In general, any type of display device can be used with the present invention. For<br>
example, although video devices have been described in the various embodiments and<br>
configurations, other types of visual presentation devices can be used. A light-emitting diode<br>
(LED) array, organic LED (OLED), light-emitting polymer (LEP), electromagnetic, cathode<br>
ray, plasma, mechanical or other display system can be employed.<br>
[76] Virtual reality, three-dimensional or other types of displays can be employed. For<br>
example, a user can wear imaging goggles or a hood so that they are immersed within a<br>
generated surrounding. In this approach, the generated display can align with the user's<br>
perception of their surroundings to create an augmented, or enhanced, reality. One<br>
embodiment may allow a user to interact with an image of a character. The character can be<br>
computer generated, played by a human actor, etc. The character can react to the user's<br>
actions and body position. Interactions can include speech, co-manipulation of objects, etc.<br>
[177] Multiple systems can be interconnected via, e.g., a digital network. For example,<br>
Ethernet, Universal Serial Bus (USB), IEEE 1394 (Firewire), etc., can be used. Wireless<br>
communication links such as defined by 802.1 lb, etc., can be employed. By using multiple<br>
systems, users in different geographic locations can cooperate, compete, or otherwise interact<br>
with each other through generated images. Images generated by two or more systems can be<br>
"tiled" together, or otherwise combined to produce conglomerate displays.<br>
[78] Other types of illumination, as opposed to light, can be used. For example, radar<br>
signals, microwave or other electromagnetic waves can be used to advantage in situations<br>
where an object to detect (e.g., a metal object) is highly reflective of such waves. It is<br>
possible to adapt aspects of the system to other forms of detection such as by using acoustic<br>
waves in air or water.<br>
[79] Although computer systems have been described to receive and process the object<br>
image signals and to generate display signals, any other type of processing system can be<br>
used. For example, a processing system that does not use a general-purpose computer can be<br>
employed. Processing systems using designs based upon custom or semi-custom circuitry or<br>
chips, application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), field-programmable gate arrays<br>
(FPGAs), multiprocessor, asynchronous or any type of architecture design or methodology<br>
can be suitable for use with the present invention.<br>
[80] Thus, the scope of the invention is to be determined solely by the appended claims.<br>
