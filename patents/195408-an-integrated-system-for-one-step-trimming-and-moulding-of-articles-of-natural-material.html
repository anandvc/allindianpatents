AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM FOR ONE STEP TRIMMING AND MOULDING OF<br>
ARTICLES OF NATURAL MATERIAL<br><br>
The present invention relates to system for trimming and moulding article's of natural material such as Sal leaf plates and in particular to an integrated system for one step trimming and moulding of articles of natural material such as Sal leaf plates following a simple and fast operation.<br>
It is well known to use natural materials such as plant leaves and the like for making disposable plates, containers and the like. In particular, such disposable plates, containers etc of natural material such as of plant leaves are mostly in use in religious functions and also in feasts and the like wherein large-scale use of such plates, containers are required. Importantly, such disposable leaf plates enable simple disposal of the plates after use without requiring any form of cleaning or washing as is required for conventional house-hold plates such as those obtained of glass, ceramic, plastics and other like materials. Added to the above, the leaf plates are also simple to carry as it is almost weightless, breakage free and favors easy holding of the plate if necessary during distribution and/or use of the plates. Moreover, since such plates are disposed after use, there is no question of any contamination due to improper washing/handling of the plates for reuse as is usually encountered in use of conventional glass, ceramic and like plates, utensils.<br>
The disposable plates are usually made from either fresh or dehydrated leaves of varying sizes, cut/trimmed and stitched together with desired shapes and sizes.<br>
Banana leaves are popular almost all over the Indian subcontinent Lotus leaves are popular in the Southern States. Sal leaves are popular in the Central and Eastern States. For year round use of dehydrated leaves, partial success has been made with banana and lotus leaves, because of their fragility when dry. Sal (shorea robusta) leaves on the other hand, when temper dried, acquire residual strength. It has a proven commercial value and found access to rural and urban market with equal popularity and choice. Unlike paper and plastic plates, sal leaf plates even in dehydrated form can be rinsed and disposed of after use by burning or dumping in a compost pit, and is completely degradable and eco-friendly.<br>
Sal (shorea robusta) is a natural flora found widespread in the forests of Central and Eastern India The trees may be tall upto 50 ft. Younger plants usually have an average leaf foliage of 12 cm x 18 cm or smaller with increasing height of the tree The tree becomes barren during March and fresh foliage comes during the next two months Ten to twelve such foliage may be hand stitched with wooden or grass picks to form a circular<br><br>
2<br>
disc like foil plate of average approximately 30 cm to 40 cm in diameter, which serves as a disposable dinner plate Conical shaped cups called Donas are also made for serving yogurt or pudding like semisolid or fluid dishes. This makes good cottage industry for villagers near forest areas In course of time these sal leaf plates were improved to have a leak proof flat base and raised edges by using moulding type mechanical devices, using pressure and heat.<br>
There are disadvantages associated with the presently used apparatus and method of manufacture of the sal leaf plates. One of the main disadvantages is that the machine or apparatus for moulding of such plates presently used are electrically heated. As such these machines can be used only in places where electricity is available. Usually places where electricity is available are at considerable distance from the forests where sal leaves are available. Thus transportation of the sal leaves to the town from the forest add to the cost. Moreover, the cost of major consumables in such electrical apparatuses conventionally used included expenses on electrical energy and required frequent replacement of heating coil which made its use cost-extensive.<br>
Moreover, the machine or apparatus presently in use are bulky and not portable and have limitations in use. Also, the present systems are found to require regular and frequent maintenance which lower the productivity and increases cost while decreasing the benefits of the labour.<br>
In our Copending application No. 1872/CAL/98 there is disclosed and claimed an apparatus for manufacture of the moulded Sal leaf plates in two operations of trimming and moulding requiring a separate trimming machine and a separate moulding machine. The trimming machine consisting of a blade or punch with a serrated edge fitted to a holder, the said holder being attached to a vertical screwed shaft for providing upward and downward movement of the cutter blade by rotating the said screwed shaft with a wheel attached to the ends of the said screwed shaft and the said cutter blade or punch matching with a cutting blade guide or die fitted on to the base plate for trimming the edges of the flat plates. The moulding machine comprising a heat exchanger/oven placed in a suitable base frame, the oven provided with a flue gas outlet having a control valve for maintaining desired temperature of the bottom die/lower moulding plate, the said lower moulding plate being fixed on the said oven and a matching upper moulding plate/top die fitted to a support, the upper moulding plate adapted to be moved up and down to place on the said lower moulding plate and a pressure is applied to it with a lever with a trimmed Sal leaf placed between the said matching upper and lower moulding plates.<br><br>
3<br>
While the above trimming machine and the moulding machine of our co-pending application did take care of some of the limitations of the conventional machines/devices in that it provided for a bio-mass operable oven instead of electricity furnace and also was compact and portable for effective use in remote rural places, it still had limitations in terms of convenience of operation and consequential problems of productivity /performance. In particular, one of the basic problem in the said trimming machine and moulding machine were that the trimming and the moulding had to be attended in two entirely separate machines involving two separate steps/operations. This necessarily resulted in multiplicity of steps of operation and consequential delay in manufacture which again affected the productivity<br>
Also, in our co-pending application, the moulding machine did not have the desired support structure to cater to the load bearing requirements of such moulding devices. In particular, there was no rigid frame structure and accordingly the heat exchange and oven which were adjacent therewith the moulding unit were directly affected by the moulding action which made the oven/heat exchanger subject of damage/deterioration on use leading to problems of effective functioning/moulding.<br>
Moreover, the moulding machine of our Copending application was not adapted for uniform heating required during the moulding. Also, the die setting had been extremely difficult and occasionally improper die setting lead to non-uniform moulding and consequential production losses.<br>
Furthermore, even the trimming action in the machine of our co-pending application had been problematic in that a pressure ring was used to hold the inner portion of the leaf which occasionally resulted in inefficient trimming. Also, there were problems of groove clogging leading to machine problems. Importantly, also, in the earlier machine the construction was such that any worn out or damaged part could not be placed or repaired in isolation and in case of such an event the entire machine had to be discarded. This necessarily led to expenditure and additional burden to use such apparatus.<br>
Finally, it is also important to mention that in the earlier moulding machine the fuel feed (biomass) which necessarily generated lot of heat and gas was close to the operator Accordingly, the use of such machine caused inconvenience to the operator as far as convenient and comfortable operation was concerned as the operator was continuously exposed to the heat and gas in the process of moulding.<br><br>
4<br>
It has thus been the basic objective of the present invention to provide for improvement in the trimming and moulding machines and the method for manufacture of such moulded articles of natural material such as Sal plate and the like which would on one hand be simple and cost effective and use and at the same time would avoid the aforediscussed problems of the conventional trimming and moulding machines presently in use including the trimming machine and moulding machine disclosed in our Copending application No. 1872/CAL/98.<br>
Another object of the present invention is directed to provide for an integrated system for one step trimming cum moulding of articles of natural material such as Sal plate and the like which would enable carrying out both the trimming and the moulding operation in a single stroke thereby facilitating simple and fast production of such moulded articles such as sal plates and the like.<br>
Another object of the invention is directed to provide for an integrated system for one step trimming and moulding of moulded articles of natural materials such as sal plate which would be stable, rigid and compact and therefore, can be extensively used without need for regular maintenance and/or any required specialized training/knowledge of its operation.<br>
Another object of the invention is directed to provide for an integrated system for one step trimming and moulding of articles of natural material such as Sal plates and the like which would provide uniform distribution of required heat to the die during the moulding process avoiding problems of die damage due to direct exposure of the die to flame and gas<br>
Another object of the invention is directed to provide for an integrated system for one step trimming and moulding of articles of natural material such as Sal plate which would ensure proper trimming of the plates attended in tandem with the moulding operation thereby enabling maintaining uniformity in the manufacture of the Sal plates.<br>
Another object of the invention is directed to provide for an integrated system for one step trimming and moulding for manufacture of moulded articles of natural material such as Sal plate which would not have problems of groove clogging and would therefore necessarily provide for efficient functioning of the machine without requiring regular maintenance.<br><br>
5<br>
Another object of the invention is directed to provide for an integrated system for one step trimming and moulding for manufacture of moulded articles of natural material such as Sal plate which would avoid the requirement of replacement of the entire machine in case of worn out or damaged parts thereby providing for simplicity in maintenance and durability of the machine.<br>
Another object of the invention is directed to provide for an integrated system for one step trimming and moulding machine for manufacture of moulded articles of natural material such as Sal plate which would provide for convenient and safe operation by the operator without being affected by the flue and dust as well as the heat constantly generated during the operation of the machine.<br>
Another object of the present invention is directed to an integrated system for one step trimming and moulding machine for manufacture of moulded articles of natural material such as Sal plate which would be simple and comfortable for the to the operator by way of provision of the fuel feed end away from the operator and an insulating screen/barrier in between the machine and the operator to cut off the radiated heat during operation which usually affect the operator.<br>
Thus according to the present invention there is provided an integrated system for one step trimming and moulding of articles of natural material such as Sal plates and the like comprising:<br>
i) a base support structure ;<br>
ii) atleast one bottom die plate and a corresponding top die plate,<br>
iii) said bottom die plate secured with respect to said base support structure and<br>
adapted to hold atleast one selective lower die ; iv) said top die plate corresponding to each said bottom die plate adapted for up<br>

corresponding bottom die plate the said trimming of the article is effected by<br>
the cutter means as also the moulding of the article by said corresponding top<br>
and bottom die set, vis) means for uniform heating of said bottom die plate for said moulding.<br><br>
6<br>
It is thus possible by way of the above disclosed integrated system for trimming and moulding of moulded articles of natural material such as sal plates and the like whereby perfect trimming, forming, heating and ejection of desired finished product could be carried out in one stroke. This necessarily provided for simplicity in manufacture of such moulded articles such as Sal leaf plates by way of a simple, faster and uniform production of such articles.<br>

Additionally, the integrated system for trimming and moulding of the invention is adapted to provide for working comfort to the operator during operation of the machine by way of avoiding the flue gas and heat from being directed to the operator's body For the purpose in the system of the invention, the fuel feed is provided away from the operators place. Also, the fuel gas is driven out of the working place through an exhaust pipe. Preferably, asbestos pipe may be used for more draft and driving the gas out of the working place.<br>
The details of the invention, its objects and advantages are explained hereunder in greater detail in relation to non-limiting exemplary illustrations as per the accompanying figures wherein<br>
Figure 1 is a front view from the operators end of the integrated system for trimming and moulding of articles of natural material such as sal leaf plates of the present invention ;<br>
(Figure 2 is a side view of the integrated system for trimming and moulding of the present<br>
 Fig.3:Details of cutter and Moulding Means<br>
Fig.4: Detail of heating means<br>
Reference is first invited to Figure 1 which schematically illustrates the system in accordance with the present invention As illustrated in said figure the system in accordance with this preferred embodiment comprises a portable system having a sturdy base structure (O) adapted to support the entire system An oven (N) is used as the heating means which is supported on the base (O) The oven is preferably a bio-mass fuel operatible oven so that the system can be used in remote rural location which do not necessarily have the supply of electricity for electrical operation.<br>
The support angles (M) are rigidly secured with respect to the base (O) and support the bottom die plate (J). A pair of die guide pins (G) is provided on the bottom die plate to ensure perfectly aligned movement of the top die plate (H). The top and bottom die plates are adapted to hold the die sets upper and lower die (marked I) which are thus fixed on the respective die plates Importantly, in order to facilitate the one stroke trimmina and mouldinq operation, the upper die plate is further adapted to hold the cutter blade (CB) which is secured by the cutter holder rinq (CHR). Also provided with the upper die is a spring loaded pressure ring to ensure proper trimming of the leaves. Four numbers of top plate guide pins (C) ensure smooth plate movement<br><br>
9<br>
The top die plate (H) is operatively connected to an operating wheel (A) through an operating screw (B). The operating screw (B) is maintained in alignment by passing the same through a frame channel (D) which is further secured to the base structure (O) by means of frame angle post (L). The top die plate is adapted to be moved downward and upward vertically by rotary motion of the operating wheel (A) For the purpose the operating screw (B) is threaded and operatively connected to an operating screw nut (E) provided in the frame channel (C).<br>
The bottom die plate is adapted to receive uniform heat by way of operative connection of the same to the oven (N) through a heat exchanger (K).This ensures the die plate is properly heated uniformly during the moulding process to provide heat to the die without exposing the die to direct heat and flame.<br>
Importantly, in, the system of the present invention there is provided an Autolock (S) adapted to prevents accidental downward movement of theupper die abought the cutter blade leading to injury of the operator There was no such safety arrangement in the system disclosed in co- pending appliaction No 1872/CAL/98.<br>
Reference is now invited to figure 2 which illustrates in side view the construction of the<br>
integrated system for trimming and moulding of the present invention. As illustrated in<br>
said figure in order to ensure that the operator is not subject to problems of flue gas,<br>
dust and heat during operation of the machine, the fuel feed inlet comprising of a flap<br>
door (Q) and fuel feed tray (R) is located on the side away from the operating position.<br>
Importantly also to ensure that the flue gas and the other accompanying heat is released<br>
from the system without affecting the operator, the flue gas is directed through an<br>
-exhaust passage (P) from the heat exchanger (K) thereby ensuring that the operator is<br>
not troubled by such flue gas and heat generating during the operation of the machine.<br>
METHOD OF OPERATION .<br>
To operate the machine, the selected die set comprising the upper and lower dies for carrying out the moulding is secured to the respective top and bottom die plates The die plates and dies are heated by biomass fuel by firing the same after placing said fuels (biomass) in the oven The total heat generated is<br><br>
proportionately distributed to the die plates and consequently to the dies through the heat exchanger<br>
Subsequently, by rotating the operating wheel (A) the top die plate is moved downward<br>
whereby the cutter blade in the top die plate trims the sal leaves and simultaneously in<br><br>
relation to the lower dies effectuates the moulding of the last plate in one stroke.<br><br>
10<br>
 DETAILS OF CUTTER &amp; MOULDING MEANS<br>
The moulding and Trimming of leaves are executed simultaneously in single stroke.(Fig.3)<br>
The top Die (I - t) is screwed with Top Die Plate (H), being centrally located by Top Die<br>
locating Pin (I - pt)<br>
The Top Die besides performing the moulding operation is also designed to act as Trimming<br>
device.<br>
The outer diameter of the Top Die holds the Cutter Blade (CB) being clamped by Cutter Holder<br>
Ring (CHR).<br>
The Cutter Blade (CB) protrudes beyond the surface of the Die, so that the same is engaged on<br>
the leaves (being already placed on top of Lower Die (I - b) surface).<br>
For perfect Trimming of leaves a spring (Sp) loaded pressure Ring (Pr) is loosely fitted on<br>
Cutter Holder outer diameter, which moves upward against spring on pressure.<br>
The Pressure Ring is so adjusted that it holds the outer part of the leaves to be moulded and<br>
Trimmed.<br>
The Cutter Blade is designed to trim the leaves by Shearing action.<br>
The outer diameter of the Bottom Die (I - b), which is fitted on the Bottom Die Plate (J) acts as<br>
the inner surface for shearing groove where as Cutter Groove Ring (Cg) provides the outer<br>
surface for the groove for the shearing action of the Cutter Blade.<br>
While the Cutter Blade enters the grove on turning Operating Wheel (A) to trim the leaves by<br>
shearing, the Pressure Ring holds the outer edge of the leaves against spring action to enable<br>
perfect shearing.<br>
Further rotation (beyond trimming) of Operating Wheel engages hot Upper Die (I - t) with<br>
heated Lower Die (I - b), to complete Moulding operation.<br>
Thus single movement of Operating Wheel (A) simultaneously performs Trimming and<br>
Moulding of leaves.<br>
The Operating Screw (B) movement is designed to act through Operating Screw Nut (E) which<br>
is rigidly fixed with the fixed Frame Channel (D).<br>
The Heating means is provided by Bio-mass Fuel through Oven (N) and Heat Exchanger (K).<br><br>
11<br>
DETAILS OF HEATING MEANS BY BIO-MASS AS FUEL<br>
The necessary Heat required to heat the Moulding Dies is obtained by burning any suitable <br>
Biomass Fuel Fig.4 (Naturally available at the place of working, cheap and pollution level on burning<br>
is minimum).	<br>
Oven (N) has been designed to facilitate burning at maximum efficiency by providing optimum<br>
Air supply and also by minimizing heat loss from Oven by radiation.<br>
The Oven body has double layered sheet metal structure. The inner sheet is perforated and the<br>
space between the two sheet metal work is about 25 mm.	<br>
The air besides being allowed from the bottom of the oven (as is the case with ordinary<br>
Chullah), flows freely from all four sides of the oven towards the burning fuel, thereby<br>
considerably increasing the burning efficiency, due to more supply of Oxygen.<br>
Air flow to the fuel from all four sides also minimizes radiation heat loss.<br>
On top of the oven a Heat Exchanger (K) has been integrally built.<br>
The heat from the oven is uniformly transmitted through the Heat Exchanger to the Bottom Die<br>
Plate (J).<br>
By conduction both the dies and plates are heated for necessary moulding.<br>
Biomass Fuel is fed in the oven (N) by placing them on Fuel Feed Tray (R) and pushed on<br>
grille (Hg) through Flap Door (Q)<br>
The flue gas escapes through Exhaust Pipe (P)<br><br>
