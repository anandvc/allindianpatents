				<td>Polysiloxane coated metal oxide particles<br>
The present invention relates to novel UV filters, a process for the preparation and their use especially in formulations for the protection of human skin and/ or hair against harmful effects of sunlight. The novel UV filters are metal oxide particles which are coated with sunscreens on the basis of polysiloxanes.<br>
There is a constantly increasing need for sunscreen protection agents in a population that is exposed to an increasing amount of damaging sunlight. Repetitive sun exposure can result in skin changes known as photoaged skin. The clinical changes that are seen in photoaged skin differ from those of normally aged skin in sunlight protected sites of the body, Among the damaging results of intensive sun exposure of the skin there is increased wrinkling, elastosis, pigmentary changes, precancerous and cancerous skin lesions.<br>
Many sunscreening chemicals have been developed in the past protecting against the harmful effect of UV-A (320 to 400 nm) or UV-B (290-320 nm) wavelength, UV-A and UV-B (290 to 400 nm) wavelength and even shorter wavelength (UV-C). Very recently a new class of sun screening chemicals, the broadband UV-filters have been developed which shield the skin from UV-A and UV-B radiation. These chemicals are usually incorporated either alone or. in combination with each other into cosmetic or pharmaceutical preparations which are widely known and used.<br>
Most UV filters used in sunscreen compositions are monomeric compounds, and thus there is the inherent risk that such compounds can penetrate the skin barrier, which is highly undesirable. UV filters on the basis of polysiloxanes which may be either linear or cyclic are described e.g. in WO 93/04665, WO 94/06404, EP-A 538 431, EP-A 392 883 and EP-A 358 584. With these polysiloxanes the risk of skin penetration is lower, but it is sometimes difficult to incorporate the polysiloxanes in sunscreen compositions due to incompatibility problems which differ depending on the UV-active chromophores which are covalently bonded to the polysiloxanes.<br>
Apart from carbon-based chromophores metal oxides such as titanium dioxide or zinc oxide are widely used in sunscreening agents. Their action  is substantially based on the<br>
reflection, scattering and absorption of harmful UV radiation and is substantially dependent upon the primary particle size of the metal oxide.<br>
However, incorporation of metal oxide in sunscreen compositions can cause significant problems, in particular because many metal oxides such as titanium dioxide or zinc oxide tend to agglomerate in many finished formulations leading to a loss in their efficacy as sun-screening agent and resulting in an unacceptable aesthetic appearance due to a so-called 'whitening effect' when applied to the skin. Furthermore, the metal oxides such as titanium dioxide or zinc oxide show formulation incompatibilities when used in combination with other usual ingredients of cosmetic or dermatological formulations and/ or other UV-sunscreens. Especially unwanted are incompatibilities with other UV-sunscreens such as dibenzoylrnethane derivatives (e.g. 4,4'-Methoxy-tert,butyldibenzoylmethane) resulting amongst others e.g. in a coloration of the formulation which is highly undesirable. Additionally, untreated metal oxides are known to have photocatalytic activity through which reactions are triggered which may lead to changes of components of sunscreening agents or cause skin irritations.<br>
Various coatings have been proposed for modifying the surface of the metal oxide in order to ease the incorporation into the formulation, to avoid the formulation incompatibilities and to reduce the photocatalytic activity such as e.g. simethicone, methicone and triethoxy caprylylsifane and silicon dioxide e.g. described in EP1 281 388 and DE 103 33 029. In particular in view of their photocatalytic activity it has been suggested to coat the metal oxide particles with an inorganic coating which is not degenerated by a photocatalytic reaction. Coatings on the basis of calcinated alumina and of other oxides are known. EP-A 988 853, EP-A 1 284 277, EP0988853, and US 5562897 disclose silica coated metal oxide powders. While these coatings solve some problems associated with the use of metal oxide particles as UV absorbing or scattering particles in sunscreen compositions, there is still need for improved coated metal oxide particles, in particular for UV absorbing and/or scattering particles which allow a wide variability regarding the range of UV light which they absorb or scatter while nevertheless avoid the manifold problems occurring after incorporation of those UV absorbing particles into cosmetic or dermatological compositions. The UV filters of this invention should not show the shortcomings of the prior art UV filters, They should have excellent UV filter activity, being easily accessible and compatible with the other usual ingredients of cosmetic and dermatological compositions and with other UV-sunscreens e.g. such as dibenzoylrnethane derivatives.  For solving these problems the present invention for the first time provides novel UV filter particles which combine both the advantages of coated metal oxide particles and the advantages of chromophores on carbon basis which have excellent UV filter activity over a broad wavelength independent of the particle size. With these novel UV filter particles sunscreen formulations with high SPF values can be generated while avoiding the disadvantages of the prior art metal oxide particles and the prior art chromophores on carbon basis. Surprisingly, it was also found that the coated meta] oxides of this invention additionally stabilize dibenzoylmethane derivatives such as 4,4'-Methoxy-tert.butyldibenzoylmethane against degradation upon irradiation. Such dibenzoy! methane derivatives are well known to have a limited photostability.<br>
The present invention therefore provides novel coated metal oxide particles comprising a metal oxide particle and at feast one coating, wherein the at least one coating comprises a. The present invention also provides a process for producing these coated metal oxide particles. The sunscreens on polysiloxane basis have UV-A and/or UV-B and/or UV-C filter and/or broadband filter activity and can be prepared by state of the art methods. The present invention also provides coaled metai oxide particles obtainable by this process, sunscreen composftions comprising those coated meta! oxide particles and the use of the coated metal oxide particles for producing cosmetic and dermatological compositions, especially sunscreen compositions. Additionally, the present invention provides a method for the stabilization of dibenzoylmethane derivatives against degradation upon irradiation.<br>
The sunscreens on polysiloxane basis used for the coating may be either linear or cyclic and are described e.g. in WO 93/04665, WO 94/08404, WO 92/20690, EP-A 392 863, EP 538 431, EP 358 584, WO 03/035 022, EP-A 709 080, WO2004007592, and in WO 03/086340 and the content of all of these documents is included herein by reference.

Preparation of silica-coated titanium dioxide<br>
The coating of the metal oxide coated with a sunscreen on polysiloxane basis was measured by FT-1R spectrometry using a Perkin Elmer Spectrum One, FT-IR Spectrometer and on determination of the resulting transmission infrared absorption spectrum: a peak originating from the Si-O-Si stretching vibration was observed from 1000 to 1200 cm-1. The incorporation of the sunscreen on polysiloxane basis is proven by a peak originating from the carbonyl group of the chromophore at about 1650-1720cm-1. The effectiveness of the coating is proven via the method described below showing a reduced coloration of all samples prepared according to the Invention compared to uncoated titanium dioxide.<br>
Stability during irradiation<br>
Untreated titanium dioxide produces an intense yellow coloration upon irradiation with UV-light. The more intense the color, the greater the reactivity of the titanium dioxide. This offers a good analytical test for the effectiveness of the surface treatment.<br>
A 10% dispersion of the coated Ti02 in Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride in comparison to an uncoated sample and also in comparison to Uvinul TiOa. is drawn as a film on a glass plate with a 20 (am spreading knife, Afterwards irradiation was performed with a Hereaus Suntester with 40 MED. The judgment of the color of the samples was performed by comparison with "Methuen Handbook of Color", A. Kornerup und J.H. Wanscher, 3. edition,  Eyre Methuen, London, 1984. Additionally, the samples were compared with untreated and with a commercially available silicone coated titanium dioxide grade; Uvinul* (octylsllylated titanium dioxide from BASF).<br>
The surface treated sample of this invention showed a reduced coloration compared to the untreated TiO2 and an equal or better performance compared to the commercial sample, Uvinut* Ti02 (octylsilylated titanium dioxide).<br>
