An electric motor is provided to operate the device in case the user feels tired and electricity is available.<br><br>
There are disadvantages associated with the prior art. One of the main disadvantages is that the water out put of the pump is very low and to increase the water output the pedalling is done at a very high speed which is not advisable for the user.<br>
Another disadvantage is that in the conventional water lifting device is not so efficient and a lot of input energy is required to lift small amount of water as the device is directly connected to the water lifting means.<br>
Yet another disadvantage is that the conventional devices are useful for lifting water from the wells and bore wells only.<br>
Still another disadvantage is that the user is not able to apply maximum force during operation of the device as he has to operate the device in the sitting condition only and no means are provided to give support to the user during operation.<br>
Objects and advantages of the present invention<br>
Therefore, the main object of the present invention is to provide a water lifting device wherein minimum input energy is required to get the maximum output of the water.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a water lifting device having the means to reduce the input energy so that the user does not get tired in a short time period.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a water lifting device which is easy to operate and the pedalling means are not directly connected with the water lifting means/pump.<br><br>
still another object of present invention is to provide a water lifting device which can be used to lifting water from all kind of water sources like river, wells, bore wells, and ponds etc.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a water lifting device which can be transported easily from one place to another place.<br>
