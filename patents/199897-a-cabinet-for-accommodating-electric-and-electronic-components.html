				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relstes to a eabinet for accomodating electric and electronic components,<br>
The invention concerns a cabinet for accepting electrical<br>
and electronic components having a rack to which a door leaf having a hinge as well as wall elements are mounted in a detachable fashion, wherein the hinge has at least one stationary section attached to a side rail of the frame as well as at least one pivoting section attached to the door leaf and the pivot axis of the hinge is disposed in the vicinity of the outer side of the door leaf.<br>
These types of cabinets are utilized as circuit component cabinets in electrical technology or as electronic cabinets. The frame of such a cabinet usually supports modules as well as various other types of built-in and insert elements and forms the supporting structure for the cabinet. The housing of the cabinet is effected through the introduction of wall elements and a door leaf on the rack. The housing visually covers the contents of the cabinet, effects mechanical protection and, if necessary, electromagnetic shielding.<br>
DE 94 03 989 41 describes a hinge in a conventional circuit cabinet having a cabinet housing and a door leaf, wherein the door leaf has a bent edge in the vicinity of the hinge and the pivot axis of the hinge is disposed in the vicinity of the outer side of the door leaf.<br>
DE 39 30 134 C2 discloses a housing (module or circuit cabinet) having rack elements to which a door leaf is mounted in a detachable fashion via a hinge, wherein the<br>
pivot axis of the hinge is likewise disposed in the vicinity of the outer side of the door.<br>
DE 93 04 072 41 UI and DE 42 24 468 Cl each disclose a cabinet of the above mentioned kind, namely a circuit cabinet having a frame to which a door leaf with a hinge as well as wall elements are attached, wherein the pivot axis of the hinge is disposed in the vicinity of the outer side of the door leaf.<br>
For reasons of appearance but above all in order to prevent unauthorized access to the contents of the cabinet, it is necessary that the door leaf and the wall elements be mounted to the rack using mounting elements which can only be accessed from the inside. Towards this end a free access from the inside of the cabinet to the above mentioned mounting elements is necessary. In order to facilitate free access to an equipped cabinet it is however necessary to first remove and then reinsert the built-in components.<br>
It is the purpose of the invention to improve a cabinet of the above mentioned kind such that it is possible to attach its wall elements in the vicinity of the door leaf in such a fashion that they can be mounted and dismounted even if the cabinet is completely equipped without having to remove the inserts or built-in components.<br>
This purpose is achieved using a cabinet with the features as aereinafter descrited.<br>
Advantageous configurations and improvements of the invention can be extracted from the follewing description.<br>
The pivot axis of the hinge with which the door leaf is mounted to the side rail of a cabinet in accordance with the invention is disposed in the region of the outer side of the door leaf. The pivot axis is borne in front of the side rail in such a fashion that the edge region of the door leaf associated with the hinge seats essentially between the pivot axis and the side rail in the closed state. In order to open the cabinet, the door leaf is pivoted about the pivot axis disposed on its outer side as result of which the narrow side of the door leaf describes an arc to move away from the side rail. The narrow side of the door leaf thereby provides access, when the door is opened, to a region of the hinge between the hinge axis and the side rail to which a side wall element can be mounted in such a fashion that the mounting elements can only be accessed when the cabinet door is opened. This accessibility is also guaranteed when the cabinet is completely equipped, since the built-in components naturally only extend at most up to the inner side of the door leaf.<br>
In accordance with the invention the entire thickness of the door leaf is therefore utilized as an additional region, separated from the inside but not accessible from the outside, at which at least one of the side wall elements can be mounted. In this manner it is possible to configure a mounting which is sufficiently stable that the side wall element can have additional components such as a heat exchanger, a cooling apparatus or a cable input box. The side wall element can also be completely replaced by such added components which then must be specially adapted to this purpose.<br>
The side wall element can also be a side door, wherein same is preferentially mounted to at least one additional pivoting section of the hinge to thereby pivot about the same pivot axis as the front door leaf.<br>
The side wall element is advantageously mounted to the side rail with first mounting elements, wherein these first mounting elements are accessible from that side of the stationary section of the hinge facing away from the side wall element and disposed between the pivot axis of the hinge and the side rail. The first mounting elements are preferentially covered by the narrow side of the door leaf when the door is closed to thereby be exclusively accessible when the door leaf is removed or the door is opened.<br>
In a similar fashion, it is possible for the door leaf to be attached to the pivoting section of the hinge by means of additional mounting elements, wherein these additional mounting elements are covered by the side wall element when the door is closed and are disposed between the pivot axis of the hinge and the side rail. One thereby guarantees that the mounting of the door leaf is also not accessible from the outside when the door is closed. When the door is opened, the door leaf can however be easily dismounted, since the above mentioned additional mounting elements pivot along a curved path away from the side rail and the stationary hinge section when the door is opened and are thereby easily accessed.<br>
For improved sealing with respect to ambient dust or moisture it is advantageous to dispose one sealing element each both between the side rail and the side wall element as well as between the door leaf and the side rail which e.g. can be made from rubber. It is also conceivable to utilize contact elements for RF-shielding instead of the above mentioned sealing elements.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a cabinet for accommodating electric and electronic components, with a framework, to which a door leaf via a hinge and wall elements are releasably connected, wherein the hinge has at least one fixed section secured to a lateral beam of the framework as well as at least one pivotable section secured to the door leaf, the pivotal axis of the pivot being provided in the region of the outer side of the door leaf, and wherein a lateral wall element is secured to the fixed section of the hinge, characterized in that<br>
the lateral wall element is secured with first fixing elements which are accessible from the side of the fixed section of the hinge that is remote from the lateral wall element and are placed between the pivotal axis of the pivot and the lateral beam, the first fixed elements are covered over by the narrow side of the door leaf when the door is closed,<br>
the door leaf is secured by way of fixing elements to the pivotable sections of the hinge, wherein the fixing elements are covered over by the lateral wall element when the door is closed and placed between the pivotal axis of the pivot and the lateral beam, so that the fixing elements are accessible only when the door of the cabinet is open.<br>
BRIEF  DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
An embodiment of the invention is explained more closely below with reference to the associated drawing.<br>
Figure 1 shows a perspective exploded view of a part of a hinge of a cabinet in accordance with the invention with side rail, door leaf and side element;<br>
Figure 2 shows a cut representation along the line II-II in accordance with Figure 1;<br>
Figure 3 shows a cut representation along the line Ill-Ill in accordance with Figure 1.<br>
Figure 1 shows a side rail 1 of a rack (not shown) in a cabinet in accordance with the invention. The side rail 1 supports a hinge 2 having a stationary section 3 and a pivoting section 4 fitting into the openings thereof. The stationary section 3 of the hinge 2 can be formed on the side rail 1 or mounted thereto in a suitable manner.<br>
Bore holes 5 are fashioned in the pivoting section 4 of the hinge 2 through each of which a screw 6 can be screwed into a narrow side 7 of a door leaf 8.<br>
The stationary section 3 of the	hinge 2	has bore holes 9<br>
through which a screw 10 can be	screwed	into a side wall<br>
element 11 which is adjacent to	hinge 2	with a seating<br>
surface 12.<br>
The pivot axis 13 of the hinge 2 is separated from the side rail 1 in such a fashion that it is still in front of the outer side of the door leaf 14 when the door is closed.<br>
A handle 15 as well as a sealing element 16 can also be recognized on the door leaf 8. The side wall element 11 supports a corresponding sealing element 17.<br>
Figure 2 shows the configuration represented in Figure 1 in an assembled state cut along line II-II. The side rail 1 is, in the present example, integrally connected with the visible stationary section 3 of the hinge 2. The door leaf 8 covers, with its narrow side 7, the screw 10 connecting the side wall element 11 to the stationary section 3 of the hinge 2 in a detachable fashion. In the closed state of the cabinet shown, the screw 10, which serves as a first attachment element for the side wall element 11, is therefore not accessible.<br>
Figure 2 clearly shows the position of the sealing elements 16 and 17 when the door is closed.<br>
Figure 3 shows a cut representation of the configuration of figure 1 along the line Ill-Ill. The pivoting section 4 of the hinge 2 can be seen herein and is only indirectly connected to the side rail 1 via the pivot axis 13 of the hinge 2. The pivoting section 4 of the hinge 2 is mounted to the narrow side 7 of the door leaf 8 by means of the screw 6, wherein, in the closed state of the door shown, the side wall element 11 covers the pivoting section 4 of the hinge 2 and thereby also the screw 6. The screw 6, which serves as additional attachment element for mounting the door leaf 8 to the<br>
pivoting section 4 of the hinge 2, is therefore also not accessible when the door is closed.<br>
As can be seen from figures 1 through 3, the screws 6 and 10 are easily accessible when the door is open, since the pivot axis 13 of the hinge 2 is mounted in front of the outer side of the door leaf 14 so that, when the door is fully opened, a wide opening of the intermediate space between the pivot axis 13 and the side rail 1 thereby results, wherein the screws 6 and 10 each describe a curved path when the cabinet is opened. The attachments of the door leaf 8 and the side wall element 11 to the side rail 1 of the rack (not shown) are therefore not accessible from the outside. These elements are nevertheless easily detached when the cabinet door is opened without having to change the contents of the cabinet.<br>
