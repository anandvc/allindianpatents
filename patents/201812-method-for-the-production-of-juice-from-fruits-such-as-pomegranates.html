				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a method for the production of juice from fruits such as pomegranates, comprising the method steps of fragmenting the fruit and extracting the juice sacs of the fruit, and pressing of the juice sacs for obtaining a fruit juice.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Pomegranates are a fruit which is harvested from bushes or small trees and is cultivated in sub-tropical or tropical areas. The fruit, which is round, has a dry, hard and rufous to yellow skin. Inside, there are several cavities in two or more layers. In each cavity there is a large number of juice sacs containing juice and a seed or a kernel The juice sacs have long been used widely in cooking. The juice sacs are also pressed and the scarlet juice is used as a drink or as a flavouring in drinks or in cooking. In many cultures, the juice from pomegranates is highly appreciated as a refreshing and healthy drink.<br>
In all production of juice fronn different fruits, particular consideration must be paid to the properties and structure of the peninent fruit. When it is the intention to extract juice from pomegranates, care must be taken to ensure that no parts of the skin and inner partitions accompany the sacs and are pressed at the same time as the juice sacs. The skin and inner partitions contain large quantities of polyphenols such as punicalagin and punicalin which have a manifest bitter and astringent taste. In the production of the flavouring known as grenadine from pomegranates, use is made to some degree of the bitter taste, but as regards juice extraction, the intention is to include as little as possible of these bitter flavourings.<br>
Juice has long been produced on a small scale by manual separation of the juice sacs from the skin and inner partitions- The juice sacs are then pressed in some form of silk screen. There is also equipment for the industrial production-of juice from pomegranates, but the problem is to be able, in an efficient and rapid manner, to extract the juice sacs without including parts of the skin or inner<br><br>
partitions. Some existing equipment suffers from problems inherent in the overly large admixture of parts containing the undesirable bitter flavourings. OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
One object of the present invention is to realise a method for producing juice from pomegranates, in which the fruit is treated in an efficient manner without being subjected to such mechanical action that parts of the skin and the inner partitions accompany the juice sacs and in the later pressing of juice give rise to the bitter flavourings which are included in the skin and inner partitions, giving an undesirable flavour to the finished juice. SOLUTION<br>
This and other objects have been attained according to the present invention in that the method of the type described herein.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for the production of juice fi-om fiiiits such as pomegranates, comprising the steps of: fragmenting the fruit and extracting the juice sacs of the fruit, and pressing of the juice sacs for obtaining a fruit juice, characterized in that the fragmented fruits are caused, in a rotating drum, to fall from the upper region of the drum to its bottom where the juice sacs depart from the drum via perforations in the circumferential surface of the drum, while the remaining parts of the fruit are discharged out from the short side of the drum.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention have further been given the characterizing features as described herein: BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWING<br>
One preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be described in greater detail hereinbelow, with particular reference to the accompanying Drawing. In the accompanying Drawing:<br>
Fig. 1 shows a pomegranate in cross section; and<br>
Fig. 2 schematically shows an apparatus for carrying the method into effect. DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Fig. 1 shows a fruit 1 of pomegranate cut in half. The fruit 1 has a surrounding skin<br>
2 which is relatively hard and brittle. Within the fruit i, there are	â€”<br><br>
a number of chambers 3 which are divided off by inner partitions 4. In each one of the chambers 3, there is a large number of juice sacs 5. The juice sacs 5 are held together by a relatively tough membrane and contain a scarlet juice and a kernel or seed 6.<br>
The skin 2 and the inner partitions 4 contain large quantities of polyphenols which have an extremely manifest bitter taste. The juice and the kernels 6 in the juice sacs 5 contain only minor quantities of these bitter substances. In order to be able to extract the juice in a desirable manner, the intention is thus to separate the juice sacs 5 from the skin 2 and the inner partitions 4 so that no parts of these accompany the sacs and impart an overly bitter taste to the extracted juice.<br>
Fig. 2 shows, in a schematic flow diagram, how the method is formulated. Pomegranate fruits 1 are conveyed into the apparatus to a first workstation 7 where the fruits 1 are fragmented. Depending upon their degree of maturity and quality, the fruits 1 may be halved or cut into thick slices. The fruits 1 should be fragmented as little as possible in order to avoid the bitter substances from being released. After fragmentation, the fragmented fruits 1 arc conveyed further to a rotating drum 8. The drum 8 has a number of carriers secured on its inner wall. The carriers may be straight, but in the preferred embodiment, they are slightly oblique. The circumferential surface 10 of the drum 8 is perforated with a large number of holes. The holes have a diameter of approximately 15 mm. The rotation of the drum 8 is relatively moderate, at most 30 rpm, and depends upon the diameter of the drum 8 so that a larger diameter will give a slower rotation.<br>
The fragmented fruits 1 are fed into the drum 8 via its one short side 1 i. As a result of the rotation of the drum 8, the fruit fragments are moved by the carriers towards the upper region of the drum 8. When the carriers can no longer hold the fruit fragments, these will fall down towards the bottom of the drum 8. The fruit fragments are broken up and the juice sacs 5 which are of a size of approximately 5-10 mm fall through the holes in the circumferential surface 10 of the drum 8- The more or less-intact parts of skin 2 and inner partitions 4 remain in the drum 8. As a result of the oblique carriers, the remaining parts of the fruit 1 are moved forwards in the drum 8 and depart from the drum 8 through its other short side 12.<br><br>
The juice sacs 5 extracted from the fruit 1 and having left the drum 8 through the perforation holes are conveyed further in some form of conventional screw 13 or on a conveyor belt. The juice sacs 5 are fed by means of the screv/13 or the conveyor belt to some form of straining machine 14 or possibly a mill and a decanter. Other types of equipment for pressing the juice sacs 5 may also be employed in connection with the method according to the present invention. In the straining machine 14, the juice sacs 5 are pressed under counter pressure against a fine mesh net and the juice sacs 5 are emptied of their juice contents. Kernels 6 and membranes are conveyed off from the straining machine 14 and the pressed juice is pumped into a conduit 15 and further to a tank 16, or possibly direct to after treatment and packing in consumer packages. Alternatively, the juice may be concentrated after extraction in order to be able to be transported further where the concentrate can be employed in the production of other juices or food products.<br>
As will have been apparent from the foregoing description, the present invention realises a method for the production of juice from fruits such as pomegranates. The method permits an efficient and gentle separation of the juice sacs of the fruit from skin and inner partitions. The method makes it possible to industrially extract juice from pomegranates without the mechanical processing of the fruit being too accentuated, so that the bitter substances in the skin and inner partitions accompany the finished juice.<br><br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
