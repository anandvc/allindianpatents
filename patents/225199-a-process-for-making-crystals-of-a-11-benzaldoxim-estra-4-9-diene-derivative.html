				<td>A PROCESS FOR MAKING CRYSTALS OF A 11 b -BENZALDOXIM ESTRA-<br>
4,9-DIENE DERIVATIVE<br>
The invention relates to a process for production of crystals, whose average particle size is in a<br>
predetermined range and whose maximum particle size does not exceed a predetermined<br>
value, to the crystals obtained thereby and to the pharmaceutical preparations containing them,<br>
especially to low-dosage preparations.<br>
EP 0 648 778 A2 discloses 11 (3-benzaldoxim-estra-4,9-diene derivatives. The synthesis and<br>
purification of these compounds is described in that reference. However the crystallization and<br>
shaping step is not described in that reference. Like most steroids these compounds are<br>
crystallized from a suitable solvent. However, a conventional cooling or displacement<br>
crystallization produces a coarse-grain crystallizate, which is not further defined.<br>
For low dosage preparations, which contain the effective ingredient in only small amounts, for<br>
example 0.1 to 2 percent by weight, special requirements are put on the homogeneity of the<br>
active ingredient distribution (content uniformity, CUT) and dissolution kinetics. In these low<br>
dosage preparations the active ingredient present in very limited amounts is diluted with the<br>
other medicinal ingredients to a considerable extent. A certain average particle size should not<br>
be exceeded and the scatter or spread of the distribution should not be too great, so that the<br>
uniformity of the effective ingredient distribution remains nearly constant. This maximum particle<br>
size depends on the dosage and the application form and can be determined statistically.<br>
Furthermore with low dosage formulations the fact that smaller particles dissolve more rapidly in<br>
the stomach than larger particles must be considered. A certain particle size must not be<br>
exceeded in order to meet the requirement in regard to dissolution kinetics (more than 70% of<br>
the effective ingredient is dissolved within 45 minutes).<br>
Currently crystallizates are micronized in a jet mill according to traditional engineering to obtain<br>
the required uniformity of effective-ingredient distribution and dissolution kinetics, especially for<br>
low-dosage preparations. Average grain sizes of from 1.5 to 3 urn are obtained. However, there<br>
is an enormous increase in surface area as well as a thermodynamic activation of the surface<br>
by partial amorphization and/or by considerable destruction or perturbation of lattice structure.<br>
These physical changes cause a considerable chemical destabilization of the effective<br>
ingredient not only in its pure form, but also and above all, when it is present in a<br>
pharmaceutical preparation.<br>
The carbamate functional group of the above-mentioned 11b-benzaldoxim-estra-4,9-diene<br>
derivative decomposes to form a nitrile by splitting off ethylamine and CO2, The use of a<br>
micronizate thus evidently leads to medicinal preparations, in which the effective ingredient is<br>
not sufficiently stable under ICH, i.e. (40°C, 70% relative humidity).<br>
Lowering the milling pressure of course leads to a slight increase in the average particle size,<br>
but also to an undesirable increase in its spread. However a certain minimum pressure is<br>
absolutely required for operation of the mill. It has currently been possible to use the form of the<br>
solid to obtain better chemical stability through the micronization parameters to an only very<br>
limited extent.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a process for making crystals which do not<br>
have the disadvantages of the known prior art processes and which fulfill the requirements of<br>
low-dosage preparations.<br>
According to the invention this object is attained by a process for making crystals, whose<br>
average grain or particle size is in a predetermined range and whose maximum particle size<br>
does not exceed a predetermined value. This process comprises subjecting a supersaturated<br>
solution containing the 11b-benzaldoxim-estra-4,9-diene derivative of formula (1)<br>
wherein<br>
R1 represents hydrogen or an alkyl group with 1 to 6 carbon atoms;<br>
R2 represents hydrogen, an alkyl, aryl, aralkyl, or alkylaryl group with 1 to 10 carbon atoms, an<br>
acyl group with 1 to 10 carbon atoms or a -CONHR4 group or a -COOR4 group, wherein R4<br>
represents hydrogen, an alkyl, aryl, aralkyl, or alkylaryl group with 1 to 10 carbon atoms;<br>
R3 represents hydrogen, an alkyl, aryl, aralkyl, or alkylaryl group with 1 to 10 carbon atoms, or a<br>
-(CH2)n-CH2X group, wherein n is 0, 1 or 2, X represents hydrogen, an alkyl, aryl, aralkyl, or<br>
alkylaryl group with 1 to 10 carbon atoms, a fluoro group, a chloro group, a bromo group, an<br>
iodo group, a cyano group, an azido group, a rhodano group, an -OR5 group or an SR5 group,<br>
wherein R5 represents hydrogen, an alkyl, aryl, aralkyl, or alkylaryl group with 1 to 10 carbon<br>
atoms, or an acyl group with 1 to 10 carbon atoms;<br>
an OR5 group, whherein R5 is as defined above;<br>
a -(CH2)0-CH=CH(CH2)p-R6 group, wherein o is 0, 1, 2 or 3 and p is 0, 1 or 2 and R6 represents<br>
hydrogen, an alkyl, aryl, aralkyl, or alkylaryl group with 1 to 10 carbon atoms, a hydroxyl group,<br>
an alkoxy group, or an acyloxy group with 1 to 10 carbon atoms;<br>
a -(CH2)qC=CR7 group, wherein q is 0, 1 or 2 and R7 represents hydrogen, a fluoro group, a<br>
chloro group, a bromo group or an iodo group, an alkyl, aryl, aralkyl, or alkylaryl group with 1 to<br>
10 carbon atoms, or an acyl group with 1 to 10 carbon atoms;<br>
Z represents hydrogen, an alkyl, aryl, aralkyl, or alkylaryl group with 1 to 10 carbon atoms, an<br>
acyl group with 1 to 10 carbon atoms, a -CONHR4 group or a -COOR4 group, wherein R4<br>
represents hydrogen, an alkyl, aryl, aralkyl, or alkylaryl group with 1 to 10 carbon atoms;<br>
or an an alkali metal atom or an alkaline earth metal atom, or pharmacologically acceptable<br>
salts thereof,<br>
to a wet milling by means of a wet milling apparatus while crystallizing, in order to obtain a<br>
primary particle suspension.<br>
With the process according to the present invention it is surprisingly possible to obtain crystals<br>
which are sufficiently stable and which are adjusted in regard to their particle size parameter<br>
and thus correct in regard to pharmaceutical requirements for homogeneity of the active<br>
ingredient distribution (CUT) and dissolution kinetics for low-dosage formulations. Furthermore<br>
the grain size distribution for a certain dosage can be made with a high accuracy and<br>
reproducibiiity. Furthermore the process according to the invention can be performed simply,<br>
rapidly and in a cost-effective manner.<br>
The compound used is 11b-{4-[(ethylamino-carbonyl)oximinomethyl]phenyl}-17b-methoxy-17a-<br>
methoxymethyl-estra-4,9-dien-3-one in a preferred embodiment of the process according to the<br>
invention. The use of this particular compound in the process according to the invention<br>
provides the above-described advantages in a particularly good manner.<br>
The invention will now be illustrated in more detail with reference to the accompanying figures in<br>
which:<br>
FIG. 1 is the IR spectrum of 113-{4-[(ethylaminocarbonyl)oximino-methyl]phenyl}-17p-methoxy-<br>
17a-methoxymethyl-estra-4,9-dien-3-one (J956);<br>
FIG. 2 shows nitrile formation as a function of particle size;<br>
FIGs. 3 and 4 show the development of the grain size in the crystallization process according to<br>
the invention.<br>
The average particle size preferably amounts to from 3 pm to 25 urn, especially from 7 urn to 15<br>
mm. The maximum particle size preferably does not exceed 100 pm, more preferably 80 mm.<br>
The "maximum particle size" means that no particle has a size that is greater than the stated<br>
value. Within these limits for the average particle size and the maximum particle size the<br>
particle size distribution is selected in a beneficial way so that the pharmaceutical specifications<br>
regarding CUT and dissolution kinetics correspond to those for low-dosage preparations.<br>
In the process according to the invention a supersaturated solution of a compound of formula<br>
(1) is used. The solution contains the compound of formula (1) as a solute, which is dissolved<br>
for that purpose in a solvent. The term "solvent" is understood to also encompass mixtures of<br>
different solvents. A supersaturated solution, for example prepared by cooling, used in the<br>
process according to the invention contains more dissolved material than it would when the<br>
solution is in thermodynamic equilibrium. Supersaturated solutions, in which crystal nuclei<br>
spontaneously form, can be used in the process according to the invention.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the process according to the invention the supersaturated solution<br>
contains from 10 percent by weight to 30 percent by weight, preferably about 20 percent by<br>
weight, of the compound of formula (1), in relation to the supersaturated solution. The above-<br>
described advantages of the process according to the invention can be achieved in an<br>
especially beneficial manner with these supersaturated solutions.<br>
The splvent used to prepare the supersaturated solution is preferably ethyl acetate, which has<br>
proven to be particularly good for making supersaturated solutions of the compounds of formula<br>
(1).<br>
The preparation of the supersaturated solutions can occur in the usual manner. Preferably the<br>
supersaturated solution is made by dissolving the compound of formula (1) in a solvent at a<br>
temperature below the boiling point and subsequently cooling to a temperature above the<br>
freezing point of the solution. If ethyl acetate is used as the solvent for the supersaturated<br>
solution, which is preferred, in the process according to the invention, the heating can occur, for<br>
example, at about 70°C, until the compound of formula (1) has dissolved in the ethyl acetate<br>
and the resulting solution appears to be clear. Cooling can take place during a period from 10<br>
minutes to one hour, preferably 15 minutes to 30 minutes, at about 50 to 10°C, preferably 30 to<br>
35°C. One skilled in the art can easily ascertain the parameters for making a supersaturated<br>
solution with another solvent than ethyl acetate.<br>
The crystallization is advantageously performed in a vessel, which is equipped with a stirrer.<br>
Examples thereof are the crystallization vessels known per se for technical applications.<br>
In the process according to the invention wet milling is performed by a wet milling apparatus<br>
during crystallization. The crystallization can proceed from the saturated solution, after the wet<br>
milling has been started. Suitable apparatus for wet milling are dispersion tools and<br>
homogenizers, such as rotor-stator apparatuses, stirring mills, cylinder mills and colloid mills.<br>
The manufacture of the crystals according to the invention occurs, as already described above,<br>
by crystallization from a solvent or solvent mixture, preferably from a supersaturated ethyl<br>
acetate solution prepared by cooling. During the crystallization a wet milling is performed by<br>
means of a wet milling apparatus, especially a rotor-stator apparatus or a colloid mill. The wet<br>
milling is performed either shortly after crystallization has begun or before it has begun. The<br>
apparatus for wet milling can be used immediately as an additional stirring device in the<br>
crystallization vessel or in a by-pass loop that goes around the crystallization vessel. If a rotor-<br>
stator apparatus is used, the peripheral rotation speed can be 10 m/s to 50 m/s, preferably 20<br>
m/s to 40 m/s. A very high secondary nuclei formation rate is produced by the additional energy<br>
input caused by the wet milling, especially by the rotor-stator apparatus. The individual crystal<br>
growth is greatly reduced because of that energy input. Also, any agglomerates formed are<br>
broken up in narrow gaps. Thus a fine primary particle is the result, whose average particle size<br>
is between 3 urn and 5 urn, depending on the setting of supersaturation and peripheral speed of<br>
the rotor, and whose maximum particle size is not greater than 25 mm to 60 urn. These particle<br>
parameters can already be sufficient for low dose formulations.<br>
In order to be able to make crystals that meet the pharmaceutical requirements, even for larger<br>
particle sizes, with a definite particle size distribution with suitable accuracy and better<br>
reproducibility, the primary suspension is preferably subjected to an oscillatory temperature<br>
profile. For that purpose the fine primary particle suspension produced is heated to a<br>
temperature Tmax below the solubility limit of the primary particles in the suspension and<br>
subsequently cooled slowly to a temperature Tmin, which is above the freezing point of the<br>
suspension. On heating the fine-grained fraction of the primary particle suspension is dissolved<br>
and precipitated on the coarse particle fraction present during a subsequent cooling process.<br>
Because of that a defined shift in the particle size distribution to the larger range occurs.<br>
Preferably Tmax is selected so that from 10 to 90, preferably 20 to 50 and more preferably about<br>
30, percent by weight of the primary particles are dissolved in the solvent. The fraction of<br>
dissolved primary particles is selected according to the predetermined grain size, which again is<br>
determined by the type of low-dosage formulation. If a high proportion of the primary particles<br>
dissolve, coarser particles result.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the process according to the invention Tmin is selected so that the<br>
dissolved primary particles substantially re-crystallize again. If it is particularly desirable to<br>
reduce the losses of the compound of formula (1), nearly all of the dissolved primary particles<br>
are re-crystallized on the still remaining primary particles.<br>
The cooling from Tmax to Tmin preferably occurs during 1 minute to 10 hours, especially during<br>
0.5 hours to 2 hours.<br>
The cooling side of the temperature profile should be controlled so that the fresh nuclei<br>
formation is kept as small as possible. The size of this coarsening depends on the amount of<br>
the crystallizate dissolved in the heating cycle, which again is determined by the position of both<br>
temperatures Tmax and Tmin in relation to the solubility limit and the solid concentration of the<br>
suspension. This heating-cooling cycle can be repeated often, preferably 1 to 10 times, until the<br>
desired particle size distribution is obtained. The controlling parameters are thus Tmax, Tmin and<br>
the number of cycles. The less the desired coarsening, the less Tmax should be. Thus one can<br>
approach the desired final particle size with small steps. The development of the dissolved<br>
portion of the crystallizate in the heating periods is thus dimensioned so that the maximum<br>
particle diameter increases still only to a very small extent and the coarsening occurs in the<br>
region of the finer particles. Thus, for example, during dissolution and re-crystallization of 40<br>
percent of the J956 precipitated from a 20 percent by weight ethyl acetate solution, the average<br>
particle diameter (x50) increases from 4.9 urn to 7.8 urn while the increase of the maximum<br>
particle size (x100) is scarcely measurable. That means that the particle size distribution is<br>
considerably narrowed during growth of the average value (x50) of the particle diameter. This<br>
effect is especially advantageous for pharmaceutical applications, especially for obtaining<br>
suitable CUT values and dissolution properties.<br>
After passing through the oscillatory temperature profile the obtained crystal suspension can be<br>
filtered and washed with a solvent, since the compound of formula (1) is only soluble to a small<br>
extent, for example less than 1 percent by weight. For example, these solvents are methyl-t.-<br>
butyl ether, hexane, heptane, water or mixtures of two or more of these solvents. Because of<br>
that, in the subsequent drying process, which occurs preferably by a drying gas or in vacuum<br>
directly in the filtration unit, bridge formation and agglomeration of the particles are avoided.<br>
The drying can occur by convection or vacuum drying in a stirred or moving bed.<br>
When a conventional filtration and drying is difficult and leads to impairment of the particle size<br>
distribution produced during the crystallization, for example in the case of very fine particle<br>
sizes, alternatively the filtered and washed filter cake is suspended with a suspending liquid.<br>
The suspending liquid should be a liquid, preferably water, in which the compound of formula<br>
(1) is only slightly soluble, for example less than one percent by weight. The obtained<br>
suspension can be converted into the dried solid form of the compound of formula (1) by spray<br>
drying.<br>
The subject matter of the invention also includes crystals of the compound of formula (1), which<br>
are obtained by the process according to the invention. Reference is made to the above<br>
description in which the process according to the invention has been described in detail.<br>
If the steroid 1ip-{4-t(ethylamino-carbonyl)oximinomethyl]phenyl}-17p-methoxy-17a-<br>
methoxymethyl-estra-4,9-dien-3-one (referred to hereinafter as J956) is used as the compound<br>
of formula (1) in the process according to the invention, the X-ray powder diffraction data shown<br>
in Table I below and the IR spectrum shown in FIG. 1 are obtained.<br>
Two crystal forms of the compound J956 are known, but only one of these forms is<br>
pharmaceutically relevant. The above-described process according to the invention produces<br>
this pharmaceutically relevant crystal form and the X-ray powder diffraction data are given in<br>
Table 1. Comparison of the observed d-values with the theoretical d-values shows that the<br>
deviation is in the range of less than 1%.<br>
The present invention also relates to pharmaceutical formulations or preparations, which<br>
contain the crystals of the compounds of formula (1). As pharmaceutically effective medicinally<br>
effective drug forms, for example hard gelatin capsules or tablets with and without coatings are<br>
used, in particular, for peroral administration. The drugs made with the microcrystalline steroid<br>
of formula (1) should not impair the chemical and crystalline stability of the microcrystals. This<br>
can be achieved by<br>
- including a light protective means or agent with the medicinally effective ingredient, for<br>
example a colored capsule jacket or applying a colored coating;<br>
- not including a surface-increasing adjuvant, such as a highly dispersed silicon dioxide;<br>
- using, if possible, no or only water as solvent or auxiliary agent, and/or<br>
- keeping the water content of the medicinally effective ingredient low by a sufficient drying.<br>
An example of a suitable capsule recipe or formula is provided in Table 2.<br>
Table 2: Suitable capsule recipe for composition containing 1 mg of J956<br>
In Table 3 an example of a suitable tablet recipe is provided.<br>
Table 3: Suitable capsule recipe for composition containing 1 mg of J956<br>
An essential result of the invention is that microcrystals of the steroid of formula (1) are<br>
obtained, which are chemically considerably more stable than currently known micronizates,<br>
since first they have a reduced specific surface area and second they have crystalline surfaces<br>
that are unperturbed by the crystallization process according to the invention and highly<br>
crystalline.<br>
In FIG. 2 the stability of the microcrystals regarding nitrile formation under thermal stress (80%,<br>
28% relative humidity) is shown in comparison to micronizates. It shows that the microcrystals<br>
with increased particle size in comparison to a micronizate have a considerably improved<br>
stability, which results in a reduced generation of nitrile.<br>
Another result is that the microcrystals of the steroid of formula (1) obtained by the process<br>
according to the invention correspond in terms of their particle size distribution and solubility<br>
properties to the pharmaceutical requirements of drugs regarding CUT and dissolution<br>
properties.<br>
It has been shown that the obtained release values are not inferior to those using micronized<br>
solids for comparison (Table 4 and Table 5) for the 1 mg capsule and 1 mg tablet examples.<br>
Table 4: J956: Comparative release values for comparison of 1 mg capsule with a micronized<br>
effective ingredient to 1 mg capsule with microcrystaltine solids<br>
Table 5: J956: CUT value spread for 1 mg capsule with a micronized effective ingredient versus<br>
1 mg capsule with microcrystalline solids<br>
Table 6: J956: Comparative release values for comparison of 1 mg tablet with a micronized<br>
effective ingredient to 1 mg tablet with microcrystalline solids<br>
A further important result is that the pharmaceutically required particle size distribution of the<br>
steroid of formula (1) can be produced with high reproducibility and accuracy with the process<br>
according to the invention. In FIGS. 3 and 4 the development of the grain size or particle size in<br>
the crystallization process is illustrated. The scatter of the particle size distribution is clearly<br>
reduced and the maximum grain size is clearly only slightly increased in spite of a multiple<br>
increase in the average particle size. This assists in attaining good CUT values, also for low-<br>
dosage formulations.<br>
Furthermore the grain size distribution produced in the suspension also is maintained in the<br>
dried solid body.<br>
Finally a pharmaceutical formulation has been found, which provides a chemically stable and<br>
pharmaceutically effective medicinal preparation using the microcrystals produced by the<br>
process according to the invention.<br>
Drugs with the microcrystals according to the invention made of the steroid of formula (1) can<br>
advantageously be used for the following applications. Steroids of formula (1), especially J956,<br>
are antigestagen-acting substances, which have a considerably reduced antiglucocorticoid<br>
activity in comparison to RU 486 (mifeprison), but with the same activity as RU 486 at the<br>
progesterone receptor. J956 is designated as "mesoprogestin", whereby it is characterized as a<br>
compound, which has both agonistic and also antagonistic activity in vivo at the progesterone<br>
receptor (PR). Accordingly functional states can be attained that have gestagen and<br>
antigestagen activity. J956 itself is suitable for the following applications: It can be employed, as<br>
the case may be, together with an estrogen to make a female contraceptive preparation. It can<br>
also be used for treatment and prevention of benign hormone-dependent gynecological<br>
maladies, for example for treatment of gynecological conditions, such as endometriosis, uterine<br>
fibroids, post-operative peritoneal adhesion, dysfunctional bleeding (metrorrhagia, menorrhagia)<br>
and dysmenorrhea, as well as for prevention of gynecological conditions, such as post-<br>
operative peritoneal adhesion, dysfunctional uterus bleeding (metrorrhagia, menorrhagia) and<br>
dysmenorrhea. The daily dosage of mesoprogestin can be 0.5 mg to 100 mg, preferably 5.0 mg<br>
to 50 mg, and at its strongest preferably amounts to 10 mg to 25 mg. J956 can similarly be used<br>
together with an estrogen as a pharmaceutical ingredient for making a medicine for hormone<br>
replacement therapy (HRT) and treatment of hormone deficiencies and symptoms of hormone<br>
irregularities.<br>
The following measurement procedures are used to obtain the experimental data.<br>

The following examples serve to illustrate the invention, but do not limit the broad concept of the<br>
invention expressed generally above or in the claims appended below.<br>
Example 1<br>
In a glass reactor with an anchor agitator and a double-wall heating/cooling jacket 250 g of<br>
carbamate J956 are dissolved in 1100 ml ethyl acetate at 70°C. The clear solution is cooled<br>
within 30 minutes to 35°C. A rotor-stator dispersing apparatus is used to prepare this solution. It<br>
is operated with a rotation speed of 8000 to 13000 rpm. After 2 to 5 minutes crystallization<br>
begins. The Ultra Turrax is operated for an additional 10 minutes and then is shut off.<br>
The starting suspension obtained is heated at 55°C and subsequently cooled within an interval<br>
of 1 hour 20 minutes to 20cC. This procedure is repeated still twice more. Subsequently the<br>
suspension is filtered by a frit and washed with 500 ml of cold MtBE.<br>
Subsequently the filter cake is sucked dry with air.<br>
Microcrystals are obtained with the following particle size distribution:<br>
Example 2<br>
In a sulfonation flask with a blade mixer and a thermostat-equipped heating/cooling bath 50 g of<br>
J956 are dissolved in 200 g of ethyl acetate at 70°C. The clear solution is cooled within 15<br>
minutes to 35°C. A rotor-stator dispersing apparatus (Ultra Turrax) is introduced and operated<br>
with a rotation speed of 12000 to 16000 rpm. After 2 minutes crystallization begins. The Ultra<br>
Turrax is operated for an additional 10 minutes and then is shut off.<br>
The starting suspension obtained is heated at 50°C and subsequently cooled within an interval<br>
of 1 hour at 20°C. This procedure is repeated still twice more.<br>
Subsequently the suspension is filtered by means of a frit and washed with 100 ml MtBE. The<br>
filter cake is washed with 1000 ml water very thoroughly and subsequently suspended with 300<br>
g water. The suspension is spray-dried under the following conditions in a laboratory spray-drier<br>
with two nozzles (2 mm) (QVF/Yamato):<br>
Microcrystals are obtained in the separating filter of the spray-drier with the following particle<br>
size distribution:<br>
Microcrystalline J956 is mixed with microcrystalline cellulose in a suitable mixer (e.g. container<br>
mixer). The magnesium stearate is added and mixed several times. The absence of water in the<br>
unit is tested. The mixture is filled in a hard gelatin capsule, size 3, with a suitable capsule filling<br>
machine (e.g. Harro Hoeflinger, KFMIIIC).<br>
The microcrystalline J956 is mixed with lactose and corn starch in a granulator (e.g. a fluidized<br>
bed granulator GPCG 3.1, Glatt Co.). A solution of malto-dextrin in water is sprayed into the<br>
mixture. The resulting granulate is then dried (input air temperature 70°C). The granulate is<br>
mixed with Na- carboxy-methyl starch and glycerol monobehenate and 150 mg of the resulting<br>
mass is pressed to form the tablet core. The tablet core is then sprayed with a suspension of<br>
the coating substance in water by means of a suitable coater (e.g. Driacoater 500, Driam). The<br>
film arising on the tablet core is then dried (film mass 4 mg, input air temperature 70°C, drying<br>
loss of the film tablet 3%).<br>
