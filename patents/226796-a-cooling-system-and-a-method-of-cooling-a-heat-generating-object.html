				<td>A COOLING SYSTEM AND A METHOD OF COOLING A HEAT<br>
GENERATING OBJECT<br>
Technical Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a cooling system and a method of<br>
cooling a heat generating object and is suitable for cooling electronic equipment.<br>
It particularly relates to systems for cooling electronic equipment that are<br>
reconfigurable to allow customized air flow in proximity to the electronic<br>
equipment.<br>
Background and Objects of the Invention<br>
The growth of the computer industry and telephony over the past few<br>
decades has been phenomenal. The integration of these technologies, for<br>
example, in telecommunications switching systems, has lead to greater and<br>
greater efficiencies as larger numbers of communications are handled by fewer<br>
components, which are typically housed in a central control room.<br>
One problem inherent with many existing cooling systems for electronic<br>
equipment is rigidity. Many existing cooling systems are built into and/or under<br>
the flooring of a temperature-controlled room having equipment needing to be<br>
cooled. Such cooling systems employ fixed conduits or other piping for directing<br>
cooled air along a subsurface of the flooring and upwardly through the floor and<br>
towards the equipment to be cooled. The upwardly directed cooled air is in<br>
proximity to the equipment. In the event the temperature characteristics within<br>
the temperature-cooled room changes, such as by the equipment being moved<br>
within the room or by additional equipment being added therein, it is very difficult<br>
to modify the cooling system accordingly. For instance, the conduits<br>
have to be detached from their fixed positions and repositioned, or replaced<br><br>
in favor of differently sized conduits. Consequently, altering the cooling characteristics of existing<br>
cooling systems frequently proves a costly adventure.<br>
Floor-based cooling systems present additional difficulties other than rigidity in its cooling<br>
characteristics. For instance, floor-based cooling systems that do not utilize conduits for passing<br>
cooled air occupy more area so that equipment cabling and other obstructions do not cause uneven<br>
air distribution or a reduction in air pressure. Such systems require the equipment cabling to be<br>
plenum rated, thereby increasing system cost. Floor-based cooling systems also possess the<br>
tendency to distribute noise and vibrations, which may effect the operation of the equipment to be<br>
cooled.<br>
In addition, floor-based and other existing cooling systems have a rather limited cooling-<br>
capability. For instance, existing cooling systems have heat densities of approximately 80 watts per<br>
square foot (w/ft2) with planned cooling systems being claimed to possess heat densities of up to<br>
150 w/ft2. Cooling systems having such heat densities, however, may not effectively cool today's<br>
equipment, such as state-of-the-art computational equipment.<br>
As is readily apparent, if equipment is not effectively cooled, the internal temperature of the<br>
electronic components in the equipment substantially increases, thereby leading to significantly<br>
reduced system performance and, in some cases, total system failure. If a cooling system<br>
inefficiently cools the equipment, either the equipment may fail due to increased operating<br>
temperature or the costs for cooling the equipment may be unnecessarily high. What is needed, then,<br>
is a cooling system having its cooling characteristics closely tailored to the heating characteristics<br>
of the equipment to be cooled.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention overcomes the above-discussed shortcomings and satisfies a<br>
significant need for a cooling system for cooling a heat generating object. In accordance with a first<br>
embodiment of the present invention, a cooling system includes a frame and a heat exchanger, such<br><br>
as a cooling coil, connected thereto so that airflow is capable of passing through<br>
the frame in proximity to the heat exchanger. A fan unit is connected to the<br>
frame adjacent to the heat exchanger so that when the fan unit is activated, a<br>
first path of airflow passes through the frame in proximity to the heat exchanger<br>
through a first portion of the heat exchanger in a first direction and a second path<br>
of airflow passes through a second portion of the heat exchanger in a second<br>
direction substantially opposite said first direction. In addition, the fan unit is<br>
selectively adjustable along the heat exchanger so that the first and second<br>
paths of airflow may be repositioned to the desired locations along the heat<br>
exchanger and thus the heat generating object. The present invention thus<br>
provides a cooling system that is selectively customized to particular cooling<br>
requirements.<br>
The operation of the embodiment of the present invention includes<br>
drawing air from the heat generating object through the first portion of the heat<br>
exchanger so as to define the first path of air flow. The fan unit draws air from<br>
the first path of airflow through the second portion of the heat exchanger and<br>
directs the drawn air toward the heat generating object in the second path of<br>
airflow. In the event heat generating dynamics of the heat generating object<br>
changes, the fan unit may be moved along the heat exchanger so that the first<br>
and second paths of airflow may be redefined.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings in which a preferred embodiment of the invention is shown. This invention<br>
may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as being limited<br>
to the embodiment set forth herein. Rather, the embodiment is provided so that mis disclosure will<br>
be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the<br>
art.<br>
Referring to Figures 1-8, there is shown a cooling system 1 according to an embodiment of<br>
the present invention. Cooling system 1 is adapted to provide cooled air to one or more heat<br>
generating objects, such as a computer equipment C. As shown in Figure 1, cooling system 1 may<br><br>
be disposed above the heat generating objec(s) C cooling system 1 is intended to cool. As such,<br>
cooling system 1 may be attached along or suspended from a ceiling of the room in which the heat<br>
generating object C is located.<br>
Cooling system 1 includes, at least one heat exchanger 2 through which a coolant fluid is<br>
passed. Heat exchanger 2 may be a cooling coil or other comparable device. Air is cooled by being<br>
directed through or in proximity to heat exchanger 2. According to the embodiment of the present<br>
invention shown in Figure 2, heat exchanger 2 is sized so that a length 1 and width w thereof are<br>
substantially larger than a height of heat exchanger 2. In this way, a sizeable amount of air is<br>
capable of passing in a transverse (vertical) direction through or in proximity to heat exchanger 2<br>
and cooled thereby. Heat exchanger 2 includes an inlet 2A and an outlet 2B for receiving and<br>
discharging coolant, respectively. Coolant temperature and flow rate within heat exchanger 2 may<br>
be controlled manually or automatically.<br>
Cooling system 1 further includes a frame member 3 to which heat exchanger 2 is attached.<br>
Frame member 3 is utilized for connecting various components of cooling system 1, as explained<br>
below. Cooling system 1 may be attached to or suspended from a ceiling or other object by<br>
connecting frame member 3 thereto. Frame member 3 may include fins 3A to facilitate air flow in<br>
a direction normal to heat exchanger 2.<br>
Cooling system 1 may be modular so that a plurality of cooling systems 1 may be positioned<br>
adjacent each other along a ceiling and/or above one or more heat generating objects C. In<br>
particular, frame member 3 may be shaped to engage with and/or securely attach to a frame member<br>
3 of another cooling system 1. As shown in Figure 8, frame member 3 may be shaped so that<br>
multiple cooling systems 1 may be positioned substantially flush against each other. In this way,<br>
an array or matrix of cooling systems 1 may effective cool an enlarged room having heat generating<br>
equipment C.<br><br>
Cooling system 1 includes one or more fan units 4 that connect to frame member 3 adjacent<br>
heat exchanger 2. Each fan unit 4 draws air through heat exchanger 2 when activated. Fan units 4<br>
occupy only a portion of the surface of heat exchanger 2, as shown by the bottom plan view of<br>
cooling system 1 (Figure 2). In this way, heated air from heating object C may be drawn through<br>
a first portion 2C of heat exchanger 2 and cooled thereby, drawn through a second portion 2D of heat<br>
exchanger 2 by fan units 4 and thereupon directed towards heating object C. Each fan unit 4<br>
may include one or more fans 40. The operating speed of fans 40 may be fixed, manually varied<br>
or automatically varied to provide the desired cooling capacity. Although each fan unit 4 is shown<br>
as including four fans 40 (Figure 3), it is understood that the number of fans 40 in each fan unit 4<br>
may vary depending upon the operating requirements of cooling system 1.<br>
Each fan unit 4 includes a bracket or flange member 41 that extends from opposed end<br>
panels thereof (Figures 3 and 4). In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, each<br>
bracket member 41 includes a substantially L-shaped member 42 (Figure 5), one side of which is<br>
secured to an end portion of fan unit 4. Bracket member42 may further include h diagonal support<br>
member 43 connected between the sides of L-shaped member 42 so as to strengthen bracket member<br>
41 and prevent deformation of L-shaped member 42. Bracket members 41 selectively engage with<br>
frame member 3 for connecting fan unit 4 thereto, as discussed in greater detail below.<br>
A hood assembly 5 is connected to frame member 3 and positioned substantially entirely<br>
over heat exchanger 2 so as to define and area A therewithin, as shown in Figure 1. When cooling<br>
system 1 is positioned over a heat generating object C, heated air generated therefrom is collected<br>
within area A through a portion of heat exchanger 2 that is not adjacent a fan unit 4, such as first<br>
portion 2C (Figure 2). The collected air within area A is subsequently drawn by fan units 4 through<br>
a portion of heat exchanger 2 that is adjacent fan unit 4, such as second portion 2D, and directed<br>
towards heat generating object C. By heat exchanger 2 cooling the air as it is collected into hood<br>
assembly 5 and subsequently discharged therefrom, the twice cooled air is recirculated around heat<br>
generating object C so as to maintain operating temperatures thereof within a desired temperature<br>
range.<br><br>
In a first embodiment of the present invention, hood assembly 5 is dome-shaped or otherwise<br>
includes tapered end portions, as shown in Figure 1. It is understood, however, that hood assembly<br>
5 may have other shapes.<br>
Cooling system 1 is preferably dimensioned so that cooling system 1 unobtrusively hangs<br>
from a ceiling or other structure, without interfering with objects or persons underneath cooling<br>
system 1. By way of one example, the combined height of hood assembly 5 and frame member<br>
3/heat exchanger 2 is approximately 18". It is understood, that the dimensions of cooling system 1,<br>
including the height thereof, may vary.<br>
Because the thermal characteristics of heat generating object C may vary over time, such as<br>
by moving heat generating object C relative to cooling system 1 or adding equipment to or removing<br>
equipment from heat generating object C, it is advantageous to modify the cooling and/or operating<br>
characteristics of cooling system 1 accordingly. According to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention, cooling system 1 allows fan units 4 to be selectively repositioned along the surface of heat<br>
exchanger 2 nearest heat generating object C. In particular, frame member 3. includes one or more<br>
tray or shelf members 6 (Figure 2) that are disposed substantially entirely along opposed end<br>
portions of frame member 3. Tray member 6 extends below heat exchanger 2 and is sized to receive<br>
fan units 4 therein. Fan units 4 may be disposed within tray member 6 at any of a plurality of<br>
locations substantially entirely along frame member 3 and/or tray member 6 thereof. In this way,<br>
fan units 4 are independently positionable along tray member 6/frame member 3. Figure 8 illustrates<br>
fan units 4 of each cooling system 1 being separated from each other. By separating fan units 4 from<br>
each other, the second portion 2D of heat exchanger 2 to which fan units 4 are adjacent may be split<br>
into a plurality of spaced-apart portions.<br>
Referring to Figure 5, each tray member 6 includes an extension member 7 that extends from<br>
frame member 3 and a ledge member 8 that extends from the unconnected end of extension member<br>
7 in a substantially perpendicular relation thereto. Extension member 7 and ledge member 8 form<br>
a shelf upon which the outwardly extending portion of bracket member 41 rests so as to attach fan<br><br>
unit 4 to frame member 3. A bulbous shaped engagement member 9 may be disposed on an inner<br>
surface of ledge member 8 for supporting bracket member 41 of fan unit 4 so as to provide stability<br>
and particularly to prevent fan unit 4 from vibrating relative to frame member 3.<br>
It is understood that fan units 4 may attach to frame member 3 in ways other than by<br>
engagement between bracket member 41 and tray member 6. For instance, fan units 4 may be<br>
removably attached to frame member 3 using screws, nuts and bolts, or clamp mechanisms.<br>
As stated above, coolant is passed through heat exchanger 2 so that air passing in proximity<br>
to heat exchanger 2 is cooled thereby. Inlet 2A of heat exchanger 2 is positioned above outlet 2B<br>
so that coolant from a cooling source (not shown) is initially forced through the portion of the heat<br>
exchanger 2 closer to hood assembly 5 and thereafter returned to outlet 2B through the portion of<br>
the heat exchanger 2 that is closer to heat generating object C. Noting that the cooler portion of heat<br>
exchanger 2 is the portion thereof that receives the coolant, heated air that is (drawn into hood<br>
assembly 5 remains cooler due to having more recently passed through the cooler portion of heat<br>
exchanger 2.<br>
Cooling system 1 may be disposed within a room so as to cool heat generating objects<br>
therein. In this regard, it is understood that cooling system 1 may be sized for substantially<br>
occupying the ceiling of the room. Alternatively, a plurality of cooling systems 1 may be adjacent<br>
each other along the ceiling. In this way, a plurality of fan units 4 from the cooling systems 1 may<br>
be positioned to be in proximity to each air intake of the heat generating objects C in the room.<br>
The operation of cooling system 1 will be described with reference to Figures 6 and 7.<br>
Initially, fan units 4 are positioned within tray member 6 of frame member 3 so as to be adjacent the<br>
desired portion 2D of heat exchanger 2. It-is understood that fan units 4 may be positioned adjacent<br>
each other (as shown) or separated from each other so that a plurality of second portions 2D of heat<br>
exchanger 2 exist. Next, heated air from heat generating object C is drawn therefrom along a first<br>
path of airflow 10 through a first portion 2C of heat exchanger 2 (Figure 6). The heated air naturally<br><br>
rises from heat generating object C and/or is drawn therefrom, and is collected into area A of hood<br>
assembly 5. The heated air is cooled by heat exchanger 2 a first time as the heated air passes through<br>
the first portion 2C of heat exchanger 2. The cooled air within hood assembly 5 is then drawn<br>
through a second portion 2D of heat exchanger 2 by activated fan units 4 adjacent thereto, and<br>
thereafter directed towards heat generating object C along a second path 11 of airflow. The cooled<br>
air drawn from hood assembly 5 is cooled a second time by heat exchanger 2 as the air passes<br>
through the second portion 2D of heat exchanger 2. The twice cooled air effectuates heat generating<br>
object C operating at desired operating temperatures.<br>
In the event it is desired to change the location of the first path of airflow 10 and second path<br>
of airflow 11, such as in response to a change in the heating characteristics of the heat generating<br>
object, the fan units 4 are disconnected from frame assembly 3 by disengaging bracket member 41<br>
of fan unit 4 from tray member 6 of frame assembly 3. Fan units 4 are then re-attached to frame unit<br>
4 along a different portion of tray member 6 so that fan units 4 are adjacent another portion of heat<br>
exchanger 2 other than second portion 2D thereof (Figure 7). Once fan units 4 are repositioned and<br>
activated, air heated by heat generating object C is drawn into and collected in hood assembly 5<br>
along a third path 12 of airflow and through heat exchange 2. The collected air is then drawn from<br>
hood assembly 5 by the repositioned fan units 4, passes through heat exchanger 2 a second time and<br>
is directed towards heat generating objects C along a fourth path 13 of airflow. As a result, the paths<br>
of circulated airflow are selectively redefined by reconfiguring cooling system 1 as desired.<br>
One advantage provided by the cooling system 1 according to the present invention concerns<br>
heat density. The cooling system 1 of the present invention are capable of possessing a heat density<br>
of approximately 200 w/ft2 or more. Relative to existing cooling systems, the cooling system 1 is<br>
more capable of meeting the cooling demands of tomorrow's heat generating equipment.<br>
In a second embodiment of the present invention, cooling system 100 includes fan units 4<br>
that are disposed between heat exchanger 2 and hood assembly 5 (Figure 9). In this embodiment,<br>
tray members 6 are disposed from one end of cooling system 1 to another: Fan units 4 engage with<br><br>
tray members 6 as described above so that each fan unit 4 is independently positionable along tray<br>
members 6. Fans 40 within fan units 4 are operable to blow air that was previously collected along<br>
airflow paths 20 within hood assembly 5. Fans 40 blow the collected air through heat exchanger 2<br>
and towards heat generating object C along airflow paths 21. The blown air is thus twice cooled by<br>
heat exchanger 2, a first time as the air is being collected and a second time as the air is blown from<br>
fan unit 4.<br>
The invention being thus described, it will be obvious that the same may be varied in many<br>
ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the<br>
