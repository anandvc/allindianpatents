				<td>CONTROL SYSTEM FOR ELECTRONIC RANGE SELECTION IN A DUAL CLUTCH TRANSMISSION<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/893,882, filed on March 8, 2007. The disclosure of the above<br>
application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002] The invention relates generally to a control system in a<br>
transmission, and more particularly to a control system for electronic<br>
transmission range selection in a dual clutch transmission.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may or may not constitute prior<br>
art.<br>
[0004] A typical multi-speed, dual clutch transmission uses a<br>
combination of two friction clutches and several dog clutch/synchronizers to<br>
achieve a plurality of forward and reverse gear or speed ratios, a Neutral, and a<br>
Park. Selection of speed ratios is typically accomplished by engaging a shift<br>
lever or other driver interface device that is connected by a shifting cable or other<br>
mechanical connection to the transmission. Alternatively, the selection of speed<br>
ratios may be controlled by an electronic transmission range selection (ETRS)<br><br>
system, also known as a "shift by wire" system. In an ETRS system, selection of<br>
speed ratios is accomplished through electronic signals communicated between<br>
the driver interface device and the transmission. The ETRS system reduces<br>
mechanical components, increases instrument panel space, enhances styling<br>
options, and eliminates the possibility of shifter cable misalignment with the<br>
transmission range selection levers. Accordingly, there is room in the art for a<br>
hydraulic control system having an internal ETRS system to control out-of-Park<br>
and return to Park functions in a dual clutch transmission.<br>

to initiate the first mode of operation and the third fluid flow received from the<br>
second outlet port activates the actuating assembly to initiate the second mode<br>
of operation.<br><br>
[0014] In yet another aspect of the embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the actuating assembly includes a servo mechanism having a piston<br>
disposed within a servo body, the servo body having a first inlet port in<br>
communication with the first outlet port of the valve assembly and an optional<br>
second inlet port in communication with the second outlet port of the valve<br>
assembly, wherein the third fluid flow moves the piston within the servo body to a<br>
first position when the third fluid flow is communicated from the first outlet port of<br>
the valve assembly to the first inlet port of the servo mechanism, and wherein the<br>
third fluid flow moves the piston within the servo body to a second position when<br>

within the servo body to a first position when the third fluid flow is communicated<br>
from the outlet port of the valve assembly to the inlet port of the servo<br>
mechanism, and wherein the biasing member moves the piston within the servo<br><br>
body to a second position when the third fluid flow is not communicated from the<br>
outlet port of the valve assembly to the inlet port of the servo mechanism, and<br>

second solenoid to open such that the second port of the second solenoid<br>
receives the second fluid flow and communicates the second fluid flow to the<br>
second inlet port of the valve assembly wherein the second fluid flow moves the<br>
valve to a second position. The third control signal activates the third solenoid to<br>
open if the first solenoid does not open such that the second port of the third<br>
solenoid receives the third fluid flow and communicates the third fluid flow to the<br>
third inlet port of the valve assembly wherein the third fluid flow moves the valve<br>
to the first position. The first position of the valve directs the fourth fluid flow to<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0031] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses.<br>
[0032] With reference to FIG. 1, a hydraulic control system for use in a<br>
dual clutch transmission in a motor vehicle is illustrated schematically and<br>
generally indicated by reference number 10. The hydraulic control system 10<br>
includes a plurality of subsystems including a line pressure subsystem 12, an<br>
actuator control subsystem 14, a torque converter clutch (TCC) control<br>
subsystem 16, a lubrication control subsystem 18, a clutch control subsystem 20,<br>
and an electronic transmission range selection (ETRS) subsystem 22. The<br>
hydraulic control system 10 is operable to control the dual clutch transmission, as<br>
will be described in greater detail below.<br>
[0033] The line pressure subsystem 12 is operable to provide and<br>
regulate pressurized hydraulic fluid, such as oil, throughout the hydraulic control<br>
system 10. Accordingly, the line pressure subsystem 12 may include various<br>
components (not shown) such as a hydraulic pump, a fluid source, a line<br>
pressure blow-off valve, a line pressure regulator valve, and/or a filter. In the<br>
example provided, the line pressure subsystem 12 includes a fluid<br>
communication channel or line passage, indicated by reference number 28,<br>
which directly provides pressurized hydraulic fluid to the actuator control<br>
subsystem 14, the ETRS subsystem 22, the TCC control subsystem 16, and the<br>
clutch control subsystem 20. The line passage 28 is illustrated schematically in<br><br>
FIG. 1 as a plurality of separate lines, however it should be appreciated that the<br>
line passage 28 may be a single continuous passage or a plurality of linked<br>
passages in series or in parallel without departing from the scope of the present<br>
invention.<br>
[0034] The actuator control subsystem 14 controls the actuation of a<br>
plurality of actuators 30 such as synchronizers, clutches, and/or brakes. The<br>
actuators 30 are operable to selectively engage a plurality of gear sets (not<br>
shown) within the dual clutch transmission to provide a plurality of forward and<br>
reverse speed ratios and a Neutral. Accordingly, the actuator control subsystem<br>
14 may include various components (not shown) such as solenoids and valves to<br>
actuate or control the actuators 30.<br>
[0035] The TCC control subsystem 16 controls the operation of a<br>
torque converter (not shown) in the dual clutch transmission. The TCC control<br>
subsystem 16 is in direct hydraulic communication with the ETRS subsystem 22<br>
through a fluid passage 34 and with the lubrication control subsystem 18 through<br>
a fluid passage 36. The fluid passages 34, 36 may be single channels or a<br>
plurality of linked channels in series or in parallel without departing from the<br>
scope of the present invention.<br>
[0036] The lubrication control subsystem 18 provides lubrication and<br>
cooling to a variety of components throughout the dual clutch transmission. For<br>
example, the lubrication control subsystem 18 may direct hydraulic fluid through<br>
a plurality of fluid passages (not shown) to components that generate heat.<br><br>
[0037] The clutch control subsystem 20 is operable to control a dual<br>
clutch assembly that includes a first clutch 38 and a second clutch 40. The<br>
clutches 38, 40 may be used to engage one or more countershafts (not shown)<br>
within the dual clutch transmission and provide dynamic or "power-on" shifts by<br>
alternating engagement between the clutches 38, 40 and the actuator control<br>
sub-system 14.<br>
[0038] The ETRS subsystem 22 is operable to control a park system<br>
42 upon receipt of electronic control signals, as will be described in further detail<br>
below. The park system 42 is operable to provide at least two modes of<br>
transmission operation including a first mode or out-of-Park mode and a second<br>
mode or Park mode. While in Park mode, the park system 42 prevents the<br>
transmission from moving the vehicle by preferably locking an output shaft (not<br>
shown) of the transmission. While in out-of-Park mode, the park system 42 is<br>
disengaged and the transmission may move the vehicle by engaging any of the<br>
forward or reverse speed ratios.<br>
[0039] Turning to FIG. 2, the ETRS subsystem 22 will now be<br>
described in further detail. The ETRS subsystem 22 generally includes a valve<br>
assembly 50, a first solenoid 52, a second solenoid 54, a servo mechanism 56,<br>
and a park release actuator 58 that all cooperate to control the park system 42.<br>
The valve assembly 50 includes a valve 60 located within a valve body 62. More<br>
specifically, the valve body 62 includes a bore 64 that defines a valve chamber<br>
66 and the valve 60 is slidably supported within the valve chamber 66. The<br>
valve body 62 is preferably formed as an integral component of the transmission.<br><br>
The valve 60 includes a central body 68 that extends along a length of the valve<br>
chamber 66. A plurality of lands 70 extend from the central body 68 and engage<br>
the bore 64 of the valve chamber 66. The lands 70 are spaced along the length<br>
of the central body 68 and cooperate with the bore 64 of the valve chamber 66 to<br>
define a plurality of fluid chambers 72. The valve 60 is moveable within the valve<br>
chamber 66 between a Park position, as illustrated in FIG. 2, and an out-of-Park<br>
position, as illustrated in FIG. 3. A biasing member 74, such as a spring, is<br>
located within the valve chamber 66 between the valve 60 and a seat 76. The<br>
seat 76 is fixed relative to the valve body 62. The biasing member 74 biases the<br>
valve 60 to the Park position.<br>
[0040] The valve body 62 further defines a plurality of ports that<br>
connect with a plurality of fluid communication channels or passages. In the<br>
example provided, the valve body 62 includes a first inlet port 75 that<br>
communicates with the valve chamber 66 at an end of the valve 60 opposite the<br>
end of the valve 60 engaged by the biasing member 74. The first inlet port 75<br>
communicates with a first fluid communication channel 80. A second inlet port<br>
77 communicates with the valve chamber 66 at an end of the valve 60 engaged<br>
by the biasing member 74. The second inlet port 77 communicates with a<br>
second fluid communication 82 channel. A third inlet port 79 communicates with<br>
the valve chamber 66 on an end of the valve 60 proximate or near the first inlet<br>
port 75. The third inlet port 79 communicates with a third fluid communication<br>
channel 84. A first outlet port 81 communicates with the valve chamber 66<br>
between the second and third inlet ports 77, 79. The first outlet port 81<br><br>
communicates with a fourth fluid communication channel 86. A second outlet<br>
port 83 communicates with the valve chamber 66 between the third inlet port 79<br>
and the first outlet port 81. The second outlet port 83 communicates a fifth fluid<br>
communication channel 88. The valve body 62 also defines a fourth inlet port 85<br>
located between the outlet ports 81, 83 that communicates with the line channel<br>
28. As described in FIG. 1, the line channel 28 is in communication with the line<br>
pressure control subsystem 12 and provides a third fluid flow to the fourth inlet<br>
port 85. Finally, a plurality of exhaust channels 90 communicate with the valve<br>
chamber 66 at various locations along the length of the valve chamber 66. It<br>
should be appreciated that various other arrangements of fluid communication<br>
channels and ports may be employed without departing from the scope of the<br>
present invention.<br>
[0041] The first solenoid 52, or out-of-Park solenoid, is employed to<br>
initiate the park system 42 to move to the out-of-Park mode, as will be described<br>
in further detail below. The first solenoid 52 generally includes a first fluid port 93<br>
in fluid communication with the pressure regulated line channel 92 and a second<br>
fluid port 95 in fluid communication with the first fluid communication channel 80.<br>
The pressure regulated line channel 92 delivers pressurized hydraulic fluid from<br>
the line pressure subsystem 12 (FIG. 1) to the first solenoid 52. The first<br>
solenoid 52 is operable to selectively open to allow a first fluid flow from the<br>
pressure regulated line channel 92 to pass from the first fluid port 93 through the<br>
first solenoid 52 to the second fluid port 95 and to enter the first fluid<br>
communication channel 80. The first solenoid 52 is preferably an on/off solenoid<br><br>
that either fully opens or closes and that is normally low or closed when not<br>
energized by a power source.<br>
[0042] The second solenoid 54, or return-to-Park solenoid, is employed<br>
to initiate the park system 42 to move to the Park mode, as will be described in<br>
further detail below. The second solenoid 54 generally includes a first fluid port<br>
97 in fluid communication with the pressure regulated line channel 92 and a<br>
second fluid port 101 in fluid communication with the second fluid communication<br>
channel 82. The pressure regulated line channel 92 delivers pressurized<br>
hydraulic fluid from the pump system 12 to the second solenoid 54. The second<br>
solenoid 54 is operable to selectively open to allow a second fluid flow from the<br>
pressure regulated line channel 92 to pass from the first fluid port 97 through the<br>
second solenoid 54 to the second fluid port 101 and to enter the second fluid<br>
communication channel 82. The second solenoid 54 is preferably an on/off<br>
solenoid that either fully opens or closes and that is normally low or closed when<br>
not energized by a power source.<br>
[0043] The servo mechanism 56 is operable to translate hydraulic fluid<br>
pressure communicated through the valve assembly 50 into mechanical<br>
movement or translation of the park release actuator 58. Accordingly, the servo<br>
mechanism 56 in the example provided is located within a cylinder 100 defined<br>
by a bore 103 of a servo body 105. The servo mechanism 56 preferably includes<br>
a servo pin 102 coupled to a piston head 104 slidably supported within the<br>
cylinder 100. The piston head 104 is sealingly engaged with the bore 103 of the<br>
servo body 105. The piston head 104 cooperates with the bore 103 to define a<br><br>
first fluid chamber 106 and to define a second fluid chamber 108 located on an<br>
opposite side of the piston head 104 than the first fluid chamber 106. The servo<br>
body 105 defines an inlet port 107 that communicates with the first fluid chamber<br>
106 and an inlet port 109 that communicates with the second fluid chamber 108<br>
The inlet port 107 communicates with the fifth fluid communication channel 88<br>
and the inlet port 109 communicates with the fourth fluid communication channel<br>
86. The piston head 104 and the servo pin 102 are slidable between a Park<br>
position, as illustrated in FIG. 2, and an out-of-Park position, as illustrated in FIG.<br>
4. A biasing mechanism 110, such as a spring, engages the piston head 104<br>
and biases the piston head 104 and servo pin 102 into the Park position.<br>
[0044] The park release actuator 58 is coupled to the servo pin 102 of<br>
the servo mechanism 56 and is operable to engage the park system 42.<br>
Movement of the servo pin 102 of the servo mechanism 56 in turn actuates the<br>
park release actuator 58, as will be described in further detail below. The park<br>
release actuator 58 may include switches and sensors employed to determine<br>
the operating mode of the park system 42 and may be in communication with the<br>
controller 120.<br>
[0045] The ETRS subsystem 22 further includes a fail-safe feature<br>
using a third solenoid 114 that generally includes a first fluid port 111 in fluid<br>
communication with the pressure regulated line channel 92 and a second fluid<br>
port 113 in fluid communication with the third fluid communication channel 84.<br>
The pressure regulated line channel 92 delivers pressurized hydraulic fluid from<br>
the pump system 12 to the third solenoid 114. The third solenoid 114 is operable<br><br>
to selectively open to allow a fourth fluid flow from the pressure regulated line<br>
channel 92 to pass from the first fluid port 111 through the third solenoid 114 to<br>
the second fluid port 113 and to enter the third fluid communication channel 84<br>
The third solenoid 114 is preferably a variable bleed, normally low or closed,<br>
torque converter clutch regulator solenoid that is part of the TCC control<br>
subsystem 16.<br>
[0046] A controller 120 is in electronic communication with various<br>
components of the hydraulic control system 10 including the solenoids 52, 54,<br>
114 and the park release actuator 58. The controller 120 may be a transmission<br>
control module or an engine control module and is preferably an electronic<br>
device having a preprogrammed digital computer or processor, control logic,<br>
memory used to store data, and at least one I/O peripheral. The control logic<br>
includes a plurality of logic routines for monitoring, manipulating, and generating<br>
data. However, various other types of controllers may be employed without<br>
departing from the scope of the present invention. The controller 120 receives<br>
input signals from a driver interface device 122 such as a shift lever. The input<br>
signals are indicative of the desired operating mode of the transmission. In the<br>
example of an automatic transmission, the desired operating modes may be<br>
Drive, Neutral, Reverse, Park, etc, or Park and out-of-Park. The controller 120<br>
then electronically communicates with the hydraulic control system 10, including<br>
the solenoids 52, 54, 114, using a plurality of control signals to initiate the desired<br>
transmission operating mode according to the signals communicated from the<br>
driver interface device 122.<br><br>
[0047] For example, FIG. 2 illustrates the ETRS subsystem 22 in a cold<br>
start Park mode or condition wherein the driver interface device 122 is in a Park<br>
condition, the park system 42 is in the Park mode, and the motor vehicle has just<br>
been started. In this condition, the valve 60 is in the Park position, and the third<br>
fluid flow from the line channel 28 pumped from the line pressure control<br>
subsystem 12 is directed through a fluid chamber 72 in the valve assembly 50,<br>
into the fifth fluid communication channel 88, and on into the first fluid chamber<br>
106. The third fluid flow in the first fluid chamber 106 acts against the piston 104<br>
along with the biasing member 110 to position the servo mechanism 56 to the<br>
Park position. The Park position of the servo mechanism 56 in turn mechanically<br>
positions the park release actuator 58 to keep the park system 42 in the Park<br>
mode.<br>
[0048] When the driver interface device 122 signals to the controller<br>
120 to move out-of-Park, the controller 120 electronically communicates with the<br>
out-of-Park solenoid 52 and signals the out-of-Park solenoid 52 to open. The<br>
return to park solenoid 54 remains closed. The first fluid flow passes through the<br>
out-of-Park solenoid 52 and into the first fluid communication channel 80 and into<br>
the valve assembly 50. The first fluid flow acts against the valve 60 and moves<br>
the valve 60 into the out-of-Park position, as is illustrated in FIG. 3. The third<br>
fluid flow from the line channel 28 is diverted by a land 70 in the valve assembly<br>
50 from the fifth fluid communication channel 88 to the fourth fluid communication<br>
channel 86. The third fluid flow travels through the fourth fluid communication<br>
channel 86 to the second fluid chamber 108 in the servo mechanism 56.<br><br>
Additionally, hydraulic fluid remaining in the fifth fluid communication channel 88<br>
exits the ETRS subsystem 22 through one of the exhaust channels 90<br>
[0049] The third fluid flow in the second fluid chamber 108 acts against<br>
the piston 104 and moves the servo mechanism 56 into the out-of-Park position,<br>
as illustrated in FIG. 4. The servo mechanism 56 mechanically engages the park<br>
release actuator 58 which mechanically actuates the park system 42 and moves<br>
the park system 42 from the Park mode to the out-of-Park mode. This allows the<br>
transmission to provide forward gear ratios, neutral, and/or reverse.<br>
[0050] When the driver interface device 122 signals to the controller<br>
120 to return to park, the controller 120 electronically communicates with the out-<br>
of-Park solenoid 52 and signals the out-of-Park solenoid 52 to close and<br>
electronically communicates with the return to Park solenoid 54 and signals the<br>
return to Park solenoid 54 to open. Accordingly, the second fluid flow passes<br>
from the pressure regulated line channel 92 through the return to Park solenoid<br>
54 and into the second fluid communication channel 82 and into the valve<br>
assembly 50. The second fluid flow acts against the valve 60 and moves the<br>
valve 60 back into the Park position, as illustrated in FIG. 5. The third fluid flow<br>
from the line channel 28 is diverted by a land 70 in the valve assembly 50 from<br>
the fourth fluid communication channel 86 back to the fifth fluid communication<br>
channel 88. The third fluid flow travels through the fifth fluid communication<br>
channel 88 to the first fluid chamber 106 in the servo mechanism 56.<br>
Additionally, hydraulic fluid remaining in the fourth fluid communication channel<br>
86 exits the ETRS subsystem 22 through one of the exhaust channels 90<br><br>
[0051] The third fluid flow in the first fluid chamber 106 acts against the<br>
piston 104 and moves the servo mechanism 56 back into the Park position, as<br>
illustrated in FIG. 6. The servo mechanism 56 mechanically engages the park<br>
release actuator 58 which mechanically actuates the park system 42 and moves<br>
the park system 42 from the out-of-Park mode to the Park mode. This prevents<br>
the transmission from providing forward gear ratios, neutral, and/or reverse.<br>
[0052] In the event of a failure of the out-of-Park solenoid 52, the<br>
controller 120 may signal the TCC regulator solenoid 114 to open such that the<br>
fourth fluid flow passes from the pressure regulated line channel 92 through the<br>
TCC regulator solenoid 114 and into the third fluid communication channel 84<br>
and into the valve assembly 50. The fourth fluid flow acts against the valve 60<br>
and is operable to move the valve 60 into the out-of-Park position.<br>
[0053] In an alternate embodiment of the ETRS subsystem 22, the<br>
servo mechanism does not contain the two fluid chambers 106 and 108, and<br>
instead utilizes a single fluid chamber 108. In this case, the inlet port 107 is<br>
connected directly to an exhaust thereby eliminating fluid communication channel<br>
88. Accordingly, a shorter valve 60 may be employed.<br>
[0054] The description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and variations that do not depart from the gist of the invention are intended to be<br>
within the scope of the invention. Such variations are not to be regarded as a<br>
departure from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br>
