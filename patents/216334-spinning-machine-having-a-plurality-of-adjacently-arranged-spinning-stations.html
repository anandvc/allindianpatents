				<td>Spinning machine having a plurality of adjacently arranged spinning stations<br>
The present invention relates to a spinning machine having a plurality of spinning stations<br>
arranged adjacent to one another, which each comprise a drafting unit having a front roller<br>
pair which forms a front nipping line as well as a condensing zone arranged downstream<br>
there of which condenses a drafted fibre strand, which condensing zone comprises an air-<br>
permeable transport belt which transports the fibre strand, and which transport belt is guided<br>
on a sliding surface comprising a suction slit, whereby the sliding surfaces for a plurality of<br>
transport belts are arranged on a suction tube extending over a plurality of spinning stations,<br>
and which project into the wedge-shaped gap formed by the respective front roller pair.<br>
The drafted fibre strand in a drafting unit of a spinning machine subsequently receives its<br>
spinning twist. If this spinning twist was applied directly after the drafting process, then a so-<br>
called spinning triangle would occur at the front roller pair of the drafting unit, which spinning<br>
triangle would comprise lateral fibres which were not properly bound into the twisted thread.<br>
In recent times, a so-called condensing zone has been arranged downstream of the drafting<br>
unit in order to avoid this disadvantage, in which condensing zone the drafted, but still twist-<br>
free fibre strand is bundled or condensed by means of lateral gathering of its single fibres, so<br>
that with the application of a further nipping line, the disadvantageous spinning triangle is no<br>
longer present. When the fibre strand, condensed in this way, then subsequently receives its<br>
spinning twist, a thread is produced which is less hairy, smoother and more tear-resistant.<br>
A spinning machine of the above mentioned type is prior art in German published patent<br>
application 199 03 113. The suction tube, extending over a plurality of spinning stations, for<br>
example one machine section, has a kidney-shaped cross section and extends into the<br>
wedge-shaped gap formed by the front roller pair. One reinforcement per spinning station is<br>
provided on the suction tube in the form of a thin metal foil measuring between 0.2 and 0.5<br>
mm, whereby the suction slit of each spinning station located in the suction tube also extends<br>
through the metal foil. The surfaces of the metail foil thus form the sliding surfaces in the<br>
condensing zones, which sliding surfaces follow the outer contour of the suction tube, but at<br>
a very slight distance therefrom. It has been shown to be practical when the sliding surfaces<br>
of the individual condensing zones begin directly in the wedge-shaped gaps of the front roller<br>
pairs. In the known spinning machine, there is, however, the disadvantage that even<br>
between two spinning stations, where no reinforcement is present, the suction tube also<br>
extends directly to the respective front bottom cylinder due to the thinness of the metal foil.<br>
This results in fibres, which for some reason were not bound into the fibre strand during<br>
condensing, being able to collect especially between the individual spinning stations. These<br>
stray single fibres can get, unwanted, into the fiber strand and/or can block the perforations<br>
of the air-permeable transport belt, which in time impairs the condensing effect.<br>
It is an object of the present invention, in a spinning machine of the above mentioned type, to<br>
remove stray fibres located between two spinning stations in an easy way.<br>
This object has been achieved in accordance with the present invention in that the suction<br>
tube is arranged at a distance from the front roller pairs and that the sliding surfaces<br>
comprising the suction slits are housed in single housings attached to the suction tube, which<br>
single housings bridge over the gap between the suction tube and the wedge-shaped gaps.<br>
This embodiment now provides a sufficiently large intermediate space between the suction<br>
tube and the front bottom cylinder. As a result of the large cleaning gap which occurs, stray<br>
fibres can fall through and thus be removed from the critical area, for example, by a travelling<br>
cleaner This feature of the present invention results in a sufficiently large clearance between<br>
the spinning stations, which feature aids the cleaning function. The single housings can be<br>
made compeletly from plastics and slid onto the suction tube, which is designed as a basic<br>
round tube. The housings must, however, be secured against lateral movement and rotation.<br>
Lateral guiding surfaces are applied to each individual housing for the respective transport<br>
belt. This has the advantage that the transport belt is exactly laterally guided in the actual<br>
condensing area.<br>
The suction tube is advantageously provided with relatively large suction openings in the<br>
individual spinning stations, which suction openings are covered after the single housings<br>
have been assembled and which act with the suction slits applied in the single housings. No<br>
great tolerances are required for the suction openings in the suction tube, while the<br>
technically significant suction slits located in the sliding surfaces can be applied to the single<br>
housings in a simple way during manufacture.<br>
The single housings can be designed as hollow profiles which are provided with lateral<br>
covers. The bore holes, with which the single housings are slid onto the suction tube, are<br>
then located in the covers. In this way the necessary sealing between the suction tube and<br>
the single housings is achieved.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention an idler pulley can be arranged to each single<br>
housing, which idler pulley is driven by a friction roller. This type of drive transfefs sufficient<br>
friction to the transport belt, without the transport belt being subjected to unusually great<br>
wear. A nipping roller, bordering the condensing zone on its exit side, which drives the<br>
transport belt as in the above mentioned prior art, no longer serves the drive function, but<br>
rather only the twist block between the condensing zone and the twisting element.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
These and further objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become<br>
more readily apparent from the following detailed description thereof when taken in<br>
conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein:<br>
Figure 1 is a partly intersectional side view of a spinning station of a spinning machine in the<br>
area of a condensing zone,<br>
Figure 2 is a view in the direction of the arrow II of Figure 1 of the area of the condensing<br>
zone, whereby several components, in particular pressure rollers located above the<br>
condensing zone, have been omitted.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
In the case of the sections of the spinning machine shown in Figures 1 and 2, a ring spinning<br>
machine is preferably involved. The spinning machine comprises in the usual way a plurality<br>
of spinning stations arranged adjacently in machine longitudinal direction, of which three<br>
spinning stations 1, 2 and 3 can be seen in Figure 2.<br>
Each spinning station 1,2,3 comprises a drafting unit 4, of which only the end area is shown<br>
in Figure 1, and also comprises a condensing zone 6 which bundles a drafted, but still twist-<br>
free fibre strand 5, and which condensing zone 6 is located downstream of the drafting unit 4.<br>
The remaining components of the spinning stations 1,2, 3 are not shown.<br>
Each drafting unit 4 comprises a front roller pair 7, as well as an apron roller pair 10,<br>
arranged upstream therefrom, which guides a bottom apon 8 and an upper apron 9. The<br>
remaining roller pairs of the drafting unit 4 are not shown.<br>
The front roller pair 7 comprises a driven bottom cylinder 11, which extends along a plurality<br>
of spinning stations 1,2 3......which driven bottom cylinder 11 has, in the known way, a<br>
corrugated area 12. At each spinning station 1, 2, 3 .... a pressure roller 13 is arranged to the<br>
corrugated area 12 of the bottom cylinder 11. The front roller pair 7 defines a front nipping<br>
line 14, at which the drafting zone of the drafting unit 4 comes to an end. In the drafting unit<br>
4, fed fibre material 15, for example a sliver or a roving, is drafted in the known way in<br>
transport direction A to the desired degree of fineness. The drafting process is essentially<br>
finished at the front nipping line 14.<br>
For the reasons mentioned above, a condensing zone 6 is arranged downstream of the<br>
drafting unit 4, in which condensing zone 6 the still twist-free fibre strand 5 is bundled or<br>
condensed by means of lateral gathering of its single fibres.<br>
Each condensing zone 6 comprises an air-permeable transport belt 16, which transports the<br>
fibre strand 5 to be condensed through the condensing zone 6. In the case of the transport<br>
belt 16, a thin, close-meshed woven belt is preferably involved here, which gives rise for<br>
obvious reasons to the air-permeability.<br>
Each transport belt 16 is guided over a sliding surface 17, which, in detail to be described<br>
below, is formed by the outer contour of a single housing 18, which single housing 18,<br>
together with further single housings 18, are arranged on a suction tube 19 which extends<br>
along a plurality of spinning stations 1,2,3. Low pressure prevails in the suction tube 19,<br>
which is connected via a low pressure conduit 20 to a low pressure source (not shown).<br>
A suction slit 21 is located in the sliding surface 17 of each spinning station 1,2, 3......which<br>
suction slit 21 is arranged slightly transversely to the direction of motion of the respective<br>
transport belt 16 and as a result of which is provided with a lateral fibre guiding edge 22,<br>
along which the fibre strand 5 to be condensed travels. On this fibre guiding edge 22, the<br>
fibre strand 5 is condensed by means of lateral gathering of its single fibres, whereby in<br>
addition a very slight false twist is applied which increases the condensing effect. The<br>
transport belt 16 is guided at a distance from the suction slit 21 over a deflecting guide 23 in<br>
the form of a tension roller.<br>
At the end of each condensing zone 6, a nipping roller 24 is arranged, which, together with<br>
the respective sliding surface 17, forms a delivery nipping line 25, to which the suction slit 21<br>
extends and which forms a twist block in relation to the spinning twist. Directly downstream of<br>
the delivery nipping line 25, the thread 26 is produced, whereby it is fed in delivery direction<br>
B to a twist element (not shown), for example a ring spindle. The nipping roller 24 prevents<br>
the spinning twist in the thread 26 retroacting back into the condensing zone 6.<br>
The driven bottom cylinder 11 as well as the remaining bottom cylinders (not shown or<br>
denoted) of the drafting unit 4 extend in the usual way in longitudinal direction of the spinning<br>
machine and are supported in drafting unit stands (not shown) which are arranged at<br>
practical intervals.<br>
The deflecting roller 23 is arranged in direct proximity to the bottom roller 11 and forms with<br>
same a wedge-shaped gap 27. A friction roller 28 is located in this wedge-shaped gap 27,<br>
which friction roller 28 is also supported in the drafting unit stands, thus being disposed,<br>
spring-mounted, at both the bottom roller 11 and the deflecting roller 23. The friction roller 28<br>
is driven hereby by the bottom cylinder 11 and drives in turn by means of friction the<br>
deflecting guide 23 and simultaneously the transport belt 16. For this purpose, the friction<br>
roller 28 is provided with a suitable coating. As can be seen in particular in Figure 1, there<br>
are two components moving simultaneously at the point of the friction drive, namely the<br>
friction roller 28 and the deflecting roller 23. For this reason, the transport belt 16 shows<br>
practically no wear, despite the heavy pressure required for the friction drive. The nipping<br>
roller 24, which is turn driven by the transport belt 16, need only be pressed against the<br>
sliding surface 17 in the area of the delivery nipping line 25 with enough force to ensure the<br>
desired twist block effect.<br>
As can be seen in particular in Figure 1, the front roller pair 7 forms, on its side facing the<br>
condensing zone 6, a wedge-shaped gap 29, into which the individual sliding surfaces 17<br>
project. Each sliding surface 17 should be positioned as near as is technically possible to the<br>
front nipping line 14 and to the bottom cylinder 11 without actually touching the latter and<br>
without deflecting to any great degree the fibre strand 5 to be condensed in the area of the<br>
wedge-shaped gap 29. It has been shown, that a placement of the parts of this kind results in<br>
a particularly good quality of the thread 26. The close positioning should be such that<br>
between the respective sliding surface 17 and the relevant front nipping line 14 and the<br>
bottom cylinder 11 only a very slight gap remains .<br>
Positioning the sliding surface 17 to the front roller pair 7 helps prevent stray fibres occuring,<br>
which then leave the fibre strand 5. Should any stray fibres occur, they must be prevented<br>
from reaching the fibre strand 5 again in an undesired way. For this reason, a feature of the<br>
present invention provides that between any two spinning stations 1,2,3..... there is a<br>
sufficiently large gap 30 between the bottom cylinder 11 and the suction tube 19. This gap 30<br>
is large enough for any stray fibres to fall through easily, and to thus be removed from the<br>
critical area between two spinning stations 1,2,3.<br>
The cleaning effect can be increased when the bottom cylinder 11 come into contact with the<br>
transport belt 16 at a point 31, where the bottom cylinder 11 and the transport belt 16 travel<br>
in opposite directions to one another. This provides an additional mechanical cleaning<br>
means for cleaning the transport belt 16.<br>
As already mentioned, the suction tube, extending along a plurality of spinning stations 1,2 3<br>
in the machine according to the prior art, is designed in such a way that it extends to the<br>
wedge-shaped gap 29. This is not the case in the embodiment of the present invention.<br>
According to the Figures 1 and 2 a single housing 18 is provided for each spinning station<br>
1,2,3 ..., which single housing 18 comprises the respective sliding surface 17 having a<br>
suction slit 21, and which single housing 18 is slid onto the suction tube 19 extending along a<br>
plurality of spinning stations 1,2,3......The single housings 18 are designed as hollow profiles<br>
32 having lateral covers 33,34. Bore holes are located in these covers 33,34, the diameter of<br>
said bore holes being adapted to the diameter of the suction tube 19. Thus a sealing can be<br>
achieved at the same time between the suction tube 19 and the respective single housing<br>
18.<br>
Because the individual sliding surfaces 17 are arranged to single housings 18, the suction<br>
tube 19 can be arranged at a distance from the front roller pairs 7. The single housings 18,<br>
containing the sliding surfaces 17 with the suction slits 21, bridge the gap between the<br>
suction tube 19 and the wedge-shaped gaps 29, which is not the case in prior art. This<br>
results in a relativing large gap 30 between two respective spinning stations 1,2,3......which<br>
gap 30 is bordered by the bottom cylinder 11 on the one side and on the other by the suction<br>
tube 19. This large gap 30 serves to keep the spinning machine clean between the spinning<br>
stations 1,2,3 ..... so that stray fibres cannot get into the condensed fibre strand 5 in an<br>
undesired way.<br>
The single housings 18 are advantageously made of plastic and can therefore be provided in<br>
a simple way with lateral guiding edges 35 and 36 for guiding the transport belt 16, in<br>
particular in the area of the condensing zone 6.<br>
The suction tube 19 is provided in the area of the individual spinning stations 1,2,3 with<br>
relatively wide suction openings 37, which in their dimensions have wide tolerances. These<br>
suction openings 37 are covered in a sealed way by the respective single housings 18 during<br>
assembly onto the suction tube 19 and act together with the individual suction slits 21 located<br>
in the single housings 18. The suction slits 21 located in the sliding surfaces 17 are more<br>
closely tolerated and are adapted to the special requirements of the condensing process.<br>
