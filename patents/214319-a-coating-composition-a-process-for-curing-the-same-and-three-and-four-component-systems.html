				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention pertains to a coating composition, a process for curing the same and  <br>
three and four component systems. The coating composition comprises a first compound comprising at least one bicyclo-orthoester group and a second compound comprising at least two isocyanines groups.<br>
The above-mentioned coating composition Is known from WO 97/31073  It has been found that with the application of such a coating composition as a clear coat on certain substrates foam formation is observed at relatively low film thickness.<br>
The Invention now provides a coating composition of the aforementioned type which is free of said drawback. For tiat reason the coating composition mentioned In the opening paragraph is characterised in that it comprises a third compound comprising at least one thiol group.<br>
The use of thiol-functional compounds In the coating composition of the present Invention provides coatings with little or no foam fomnatlon and a film thickness up to at least about 60  without film defects. Such a layer thickness of at least about 60 ^m will result In characteristics which, as known to a person sculled In the art, are preferred for a clear coat, such as good protection of the underlying coating layer(s), gloss, hardness. Furthennore, coating compositions according to the present Invention show a low VOC, a favourable pot llfe:drying time ratio, reduced sagging of the coating composition on the substrate, and a high build behaviour.<br>
A coating composition comprising a compound comprising at least one bicyclo-orthoester group (bicyclo-orthoester hereinafter is abbreviated to BOE) is a composition having latent hydroxyl groups. In the presence of water or moisture<br><br>
from the air the BOE groups will be hydroiysed, forming hydroxyl groups. This reaction is also known as deblocking. During deblocking few if any volatile components are released. When the BOE group is deblocked in this manner, it is not possible to obtain a homopolymer of BOE groups by cationic polymerisation. However, the deblocked hydroxyl groups can react with the isocyanate groups of the second compound to give a cross-linked polymer.<br>
US 4,78S,083 discloses a coating composition comprising a polyol polyisocyanate mixture and a molar excess of a thiol-functional compound t"- a tin catalyst. By molar excess is meant that sufficient thiol-functional compound is added to the tin catalyst for the pot life in an open can of the polyol polyisocyanate mixture to be at least twice as long as for the same mixture containing only the tin catalyst.<br>
Surprisingly, it has been found that the presence of a thiol-functional compound in the coating composition of the present invention does not increase the pot life at all, but in fact decreases it. Furthermore, the curing rate of the coating composition of the present invention is the same as of a coating composition which does not comprise a thiol-functional compound. Still, a decrease of Vne foam formation is obsen/ed when using the coating composition of the present invention.<br>
By BOE groups are meant groups having a structure according to formula I<br>
o	X<br>
R	c	O—Y	C	R2	(I)<br>
\      /<br>
o	z<br>
wherein<br><br>
X and Z may be the same or different and are selected from linear or branched alk(en)ylene groups with 1-4 carbon atoms optionally containing an oxygen or a nitrogen atom;<br>
Y is nothing or Is selected independently of X and Z from linear or branched alk(en)ylene groups with 1-4 carbon atoms optionally containing an oxygen or a nitrogen atom;<br>
Ri and R^ may be the same or different and are selected from the group of monovalent radicals comprising<br>
hydrogen, hydroxyl, alk(en)yl groups comprising 1-30 carbon atoms which groups may be linear or branched and may optionally contain one or more heteroatoms and groups selected from the group of oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur, phosphorus, sulphone, sulphoxy, and ester, optionally substituted with epoxy, cyano, amino, thiol, hydroxyl, halogen, nitro, phosphorus, sulphoxy, amido, ether, ester, urea, urethane, thioester, thioamide, amide, carboxyl, carbonyl, aryl, and acyl groups, and divalent radicals comprising<br>
alk(en)ylene groups having 1-10 cariDon atoms which groups may be linear or branched and may optionally contain one or more heteroatoms and groups selected from the group of oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur, phosphorus, sulphone, sulphoxy, and ester, optionally substituted with epoxy, cyano, amino, thiol, hydroxyl, halogen, nitro, phosphoms, sulphoxy, amido, ether, ester, urea, urethane, thioester, thioamide, amide, cariaoxyl, carbonyl, aryl, and acyl groups; ester groups; ether groups; amide groups; thioester groups; thioamide groups; urethane groups; urea groups; and a single bond.<br>
Preferably, X, Y, and Z are methylene. R, and Ra in that case are linked to a divalent 2,6,7-trioxabicyclo[2.2.2]octane radical.<br><br>
In the case of R, and Rj both being monovalent radicals, the BOE group as defined by formula I is the same as the BOE-functional compound. The monovalent radicals R, and Rj may be the same or different and preferably are selected from the group of hydrogen, hydroxyl, and linear or branched alk(en)yl groups having 1-20 carbon atoms, optionaiiy substituted with one or more hydroxyl groups and optionally comprising an ester group. Examples of such groups are; methyl, methylol, ethyl, ethylol, propyl, propylol, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, undecyl, a - CHj - CHa - O - CO - C1.20 alk(en)yl group, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Preferably, Ri is linear or branched alk(en)yl having 1-20 carbon atoms, optionally substituted with hydroxyl, while Rj is methyl or ethyl. Alternatively, R, can be methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, undecyl, and mixtures thereof, while Rj can be methylol, ethyl, ethylol or a - CHj - CH2 - 0 - CO - C1.20 alk(en)yl group.<br>
When a divalent radical is selected for either or both R, or R2 groups, high-molecular weight BOE-functional compounds can be formed. These may be adducts or polymers comprising several BOE groups. Thus two BOE groups can fomrt an adduct by the selection of a monovalent radical for one of the two Ri and Rg groups and a divalent radical for the other. The BOE groups will then be linked together via the divalent radical. BOE groups may also be linked via the divalent radicals to monomer or oligomer compounds. Such BOE-functional compounds are described, e.g., in the above-mentioned US 4,338,240. For example, two BOE groups may be linked to a dimer fatty acid, e.g., Pripol 1009 ex Unichema. Alternatively, in the aforementioned configuration the BOE groups can function as side groups or tenninal groups in a polymer chain. The polymers can be, e.g., polyesters, polyethers, polyacrylates, polyamides or polyurethanes. When the divalent radical is a single bond, the BOE group Is<br><br>
bonded directly to the polymer. When the R, and Rj groups are both divalent, the BOE groups can be incorporated Into the main chain of a polymer or they can serve to link two polymer chains together. Preferably, one or both R, and R2 groups are selected from the group of ester, ether, urethane, a single bond, and alk(en)ylene groups having 1-10 carbon atoms which may be linear or branched and may contain one or more ester, ether, or urethane groups.<br>
In addition to the BOE-functional compound the coating composition according to the invention comprises a second compound comprising at least two isocyanate groups. Examples of compounds comprising at least two isocyanate groups are aliphatic, alicyclic, and aromatic poiyisocyanates such as trimethylene diisocyanate, 1,2-propylene diisocyanate, tetramethylene diisocyanate, 2,3-butylene diisocyanate, hexamethylene diisocyanate, octamethylene diisocyanate, 2,4-trimethyl hexamethylene diisocyanate, 2,4,4-trimethyi hexamethylene diisocyanate, dodecamethyiene diisocyanate, a,a"-dipropyi ether diisocyanate, 1,3-cyclopentylene diisocyanate, 1,2-cyclohexylene diisocyanate, 1,4-cyclohexylene diisocyanate, 4-methyl-1,3-cydohexylene diisocyanate, 4,4"-dicycIohexylene diisocyanate methane, 3,3"-dimethyl-4,4"-dicyclohexylene diisocyanate methane^ m- and p-phenylene diisocyanate, 1,3-and 1,4-bis(isocyanate methyl) benzene, 1,6-dlmethyl-2,4-bls(isocyanate methyl) benzene, 1,3,5-triisocyanate benzene, 2,4- and 2,6-toluene diisocyanate, 2,4,6-toluene triisocyanate, a,a,a",a"-tetramethyl 0-, m-, and p-xylylene diisocyanate, 4,4"-diphenylene diisocyanate methane, 4,4"-dipheny[ene diisocyanate, 3,3"-dichloro-4,4"-diphenylene diisocyanate, naphthalene-1,5-diisocyanate, isophorone diisocyanate, and transvinylidene diisocyanate and mixtures of the aforementioned poiyisocyanates.<br>
Also, such compounds may be adducts of poiyisocyanates, e.g., biurets, isocyanurates, allophanates, uretdiones, and mixtures thereof. Examples of<br><br>
such adducts are the adduct of two molecules of hexamethylene diisocyanate or isophorone diisocyanate to a diol such as ethylene glycol, the adduct of 3 molecules of hexamethylene diisocyanate to 1 molecule of water, the adduct of 1 molecule of trimethylol propane to 3 molecules of isophorone diisocyanate, the adduct of 1 molecule of pentaerythritol to 4 molecules of toluene diisocyanate, the isocyanurate of hexamethylene diisocyanate, available from Bayer under the trade designations Desmodur® N3390 and Desmodur® N3600, the uretdione of hexamethylene diisocyanate, available from Bayer under the trade designation Desmodur® N3400, the allophanate of hexamethylene diisocyanate, available from Bayer under the trade designation Desmodur® LS2101, and the isocyanurate of isophorone diisocyanate, available from Htils under the trade designation Vestanat* T1890E. Furthermore, (co)polymers of isocyanate-functional monomers such as a,a"-dlmethyl-m-isopropenyl benzyl isocyanate are suitable for use. Finally, the above-mentioned isocyanates and adducts thereof may be present in the form of blocked isocyanates, as is known to the skilled man.<br>
In addition to the BOE-functional compound and the polyisocyanate compound the coating composition according to th,e invention comprises a third compound comprising at least one thiol group. Preferably, the thiol-ftjnctlonal compound comprises at least two thiol groups. Besides the thiol group the third compound may also contain other reactive groups, for instance hydroxyl and cariaoxyl groups. Thiol-functional compounds are described in US patent 4,788,083, which is incorporated herein by reference. Examples of the third compound comprising at least one thiol group include dodecyl mercaptane, mercapto ethanol, 1,3-propanedithiol, 1,6-hexanedithiol, methylthloglycolate, 2-mercaptoacetic acid, esters of 2-mercaptoacetic acid, 3-mercaptopropionic acid, esters of 3-mercaptopropionlc acid, 2-mercaptopropionic acid, esters of 2-mercaptoproplonic  acid,   11-mercaptoundecanoic  acid,  and  esters  of  11-<br><br>
mercaptoundecanoic acid. The esters can be derived from all types of hydroxyl-functional compounds, oligomers, and polymers. Preferably, trimethylol propane tri(3-mercaptoproplonate) and pentaerythrltol tetrakls(3-mercapto-propionate) are used.<br>
Alternatively, the compound comprising at least one thiol group may for example have a structure according to the following formula: T[(C3HeO)„CH2CHOHCH2SH]3, with T being a triol such as trimethylol propane or glycerol and n being 1-100. An example of such a compound is commercially available from Cognis under the trademark Capcure* 3/800.<br>
The thiol-functional compound is used in an amount of 0.1 to 10 wt.%, preferably 0.5 to 5 wt.%, more preferably in an amount of 1 to 3 wt.%, calculated on the BOE-functional compound.<br>
In addition to the disclosed BOE-functional, isocyanate-functional, and thiol-functional compounds, other compounds may be present in the coating composition according to the present invention. Such compounds may be main binders and/or reactive diluents comprising reactive groups which may be cross-linked with the aforesaid hydroxyl-functional, thiol-functional and/or Isocyanate-functional compounds. Exampfes include hydroxyl-functional binders, e.g., polyester polyols such as described in H. Wagner et al., Lackkunstharze, 5th ed., 1971 (Carl Hanser Veriag, Munich), polyether polyols, polyacrylate polyols, polyurethane polyols, cellulose acetobutyrate, hydroxyl-functional epoxy resins, alkyds, and dendrimeric polyols such as described in WO 93/17060. Also, hydroxyl-functional oligomers and monomers, such as castor oil and trimethylol propane, may be present Finally, ketone resins, aspargyl acid esters, and latent or non-latent amino-functional compounds such as oxazolidines, ketimines, aldimines, dlimines, secondary    amines, and<br><br>
polyamines may be present These and other compounds are known to the skilled person and are mentioned, int. al,, in US 6,214,086.<br>
The ratio of isocyanate groups to hydroxyl and thiol groups ranges from 50 to 300 eq.%, preferably from 70 to 250 eq.%<br>
The invention further encompasses a process for curing the present coating composition. More particularly, the latent hydroxyl groups of the BOE-functional compound have to be deblocked and the resulting hydroxyl groups and the thiol groups already present have to react with the isocyanate groups of the second compound to allow the present coating composition to be cured.<br>
The deblocking of the latent hydroxyl groups of the BOE compounds takes place under the influence of water in the form of, e.g., moisture from the air or added water. This deblocking is preferably catalysed by a first catalyst selected from the group of Lewis acids, such as AICI3, SbClj, BF3, BCI3, BeCIa, FeClg, FeBrg, SnCl4, TiCl4, ZnClj, and ZrCl4 and organic complexes thereof, e.g., BFgEtzO, BF3-2CH3COOH, BF3-2H2O, BF3-H3PO4, BF3-(CH3)20, BF3-THF, BF3-2CH3OH, BF3-2C2H6OH, and BFg-CeHgCHj, and Bronsted acids. Preferably, use is made of Bronsted acids having a pKa 
Said first catalysts may be blocked. If so desired, resulting in the release of the Lewis or Br0nsted acid under the influence of, e.g., electromagnetic in"adiatlon (light or UV), heat or moisture. Acid generating photoinitlators are described,<br><br>
int. al., In G. Li Bassi et al., "Photoin"rtiators for the Simultaneous Generation of Free Radicals and Acid Hardening Catalysts," Radcure "86 Proceedings, e.g., 2-methyl-1-[4-(methylthio)phenyl]-2-[4-methylphenylsulphonylI propan-1-one (MDTA) ex Fratelli Lambert! Spa, Varese, Italy. Alternatively, use may be made of Lewis acid generating compounds such as Irgacure® 261 ex Ciba Geigy and trimethyl silyl benzene suiphonic ester.<br>
The first catalyst can be used alone or as a mixture of catalysts in effective amounts. In principle, the hydrolysation of at least a portion of the BOE-functional compound will sufflce. Amounts of 0 to 10 wt.% relative to the BOE-functional compounds of the first catalyst may be sufficient Preferably, 0.3 to 8 wt.%, more specifically, 0.5 to 6 wt.%, will be present<br>
The reaction of the deblocked, hydroxyl groups of the BOE-functional compound, the isocyanate groups of the second compound, and the thiol groups of the third compound preferably takes place under the influence of a second catalyst. Such catalysts are known to the skilled person. The second catalyst is used in an amount of 0 to 10 wt.%, preferably 0.001 to 5 wt.%, more preferably in an amount of 0.01 to 1 wt.%, calculated on solid matter (i.e., the amount of BOE-functional compound,.the isocyanate-functional compound, the thiol-functional compound, and optionally other compounds having reactive groups).<br>
Examples of the second catalyst include dimethyl tin dilaurate, dibutyl tin dilaurate, dibutyl tin diacetate, tin octoate, zinc octoate, aluminium chelate, and dimethyl tin dichloride.<br>
The coating composition according to the invention may be part, jgf^a components system, for instance a three-component system may be employed.<br><br>
For example, one component may comprise the BOE-functional compound and the thiol-functional compound. A second component may comprise the isocyanate-functional compound. A third component may comprise the catalyst for the hydrolysis of the BOE-functional compound. Preferably, the first component also comprises the catalyst for the reaction between the isocyanate and the isocyanate-reactive groups.<br>
More preferred is a three-component sj/sternwh^ a first component may<br>
comprise the BOE-functional compound, a second component may comprise<br>
the isocyanate-functional compound, and a third component may comprise the<br>
catalyst for the hydrolysis of the BOE-functional compound and the thiol-<br>
functional compound. Preferably, tiie first component also comprises the<br>
catalyst for the reaction between the isocyanate and the isocyanate-reactive<br>
groups.	r / ^^<br>

Alternatively, the coating composition can be part of a foi^-cgmppnent system whereTn a first component may comprise the BOE-ftjnctlonal compound, a second component may comprise the isocyanate-functional compound, a third component may comprise the catalyst for the hydrolysis of the BOE-functional compound, and a fourth component comprises the thiol-functional compound. The catalyst for the reaction between the Isocyanate and the isocyanate-reactive groups may be present in the first, second, third or fourth component.<br>
In addition, a coating composition such as described may contain the usual additives such as solvents, pigments, fillers, levelling agents, emulsifiers, anti-foaming agents and rheology control agents, reducing agents, antioxidants, HALS-stabilisers, UV-stabilisers, water traps such as molecular sieves, and antisettling agents.<br><br>
Application onto a substrate can be via any method known to the skilled person, e.g., via rolling, spraying, bnjshing, flow coating, dipping, and roller coating. Preferably, a coating composition such as described Is applied by spraying.<br>
The coating composition of the present invention may be applied to any substrate. The substrate may be, for example, metal, e.g., iron, steel, and aluminium, plastic, wood, glass, synthetic material, paper, leather, or another coating layer. The other coating layer may be comprised of the coating composition of the current invention or it may be a different coating composition. The coating compositions of the current rnvention show particular utility as clear coats (over base coats, water borne and solvent bome), base coats, pigmented topcoats, primers, and fillers. The compositions are particularly suitable for refinishing motor vehicles and transportation vehicles and for finishing large transporiiation vehicles such as trains, trucks, buses, and aeroplanes.<br>
The applied coating composition can be cured very effectively at a temperature of, e.g., 0-50°C. If so desired, the coating composition may be baked, e.g., at a temperature in the range of 50-120°C.<br>
Preferred is the use of the coating composition of the present invention as a clear coat. Clear coats must be highly transparent and have good adherence to the base coat layer. It Is further required that the clear coat does not change the aesthetic aspect of the base coat by strike-in, i.e. discolouration of the base coat due to Its solvation by the clear coat composition, or by yellowing of tiie clear coat upon outdoor exposure. A clear coat based on the coating composition of the present invention does not have these drawbacks.<br><br>
If the coating composition is a clear coat, the base coat may be a conventional base coat known in the coating art. Examples are solvent borne base coats, e.g., Autobase® ex Akzo Nobel Car Refinishes BV, and water borne base coats, e.g., Autowave® ex Akzo Nobel Car Refinishes BV. Furthermore, the base coat may comprise pigments (colour pigments, metalllcs and/or pearls), wax, solvents, flow additives, neutralising agent, and defoamers. Also high solids base coats can be used. These are, for instance, based on polyols, imines, and isocyanates. The clear coat composition is applied to the surface of a base coat and then cured. An intemnediate curing step for the base coat may be introduced.<br>

The clear coats had a similar spraying viscosity (18 sec.) and were applied with an HPLV spray gun (Devilbiss 1.3, nozzle 110, 2.5 bar) over several coloured water borne base coats (Autowave*) which were dried for at least 15 minutes. The clear coats were applied in layers of increasing thickness. The clear coats were dried for 10 minutes at 60""C. The compositions of the water bome base coats based on commercially available Autowave® toners are listed in Tables 2 A and 2 B (weights are given in grams). The results for the obtained clear coats are summarised in Table 3. Foam characteristics are established by determining the minimum layer thickness of the clear coat at which foam appears. This was determined visually.<br><br>
