				<td>This invention relates to an improved process for the production of modified green coke useful for making high density monolithic graphite products.<br>
The high density monolithic graphite prepared by the improved process of the present invention, possesses a bulk density of more than 1.8 g/cm3 along with a homogeneous and fine isotropic micro structure. The main uses of this monolithic graphite prepared by the process of the present invention are:<br>
i) As electrodes for electric discharge machines, and as electrical brushes, electrical contacts<br>
and trolley wheels,<br>
ii) As heaters and crucibles for silicon production,<br>
iii) As seals, bearings, packings, jigs, hot-pressing dies,<br>
iv) As moulds for continuous casting of metals and alloys.<br>
In the prior art, there are three methods known for the production of high density graphite (T. Ishikawa and T. Nagaoki, "Recent Carbon Technology", JEC Press Inc., 1983; A. Oya, in Pro- ceedings of the Indo - Japanese Workshop on Pitch and Pitch-Based Products", edited by O. P. Bahl and L. M. Manocha, Indian Carbon Society, NPL, New Delhi, 1989, p.58). One method involves the use of two raw materials, i.e., a coke filler and a pitch binder, whereas the other two methods involve the use of single raw materials, namely, mesocarbon microbeads or green (raw) coke.<br>
In the first method (A. Oya, in Proceedings of the Indo-Japanese Workshop on Pitch and Pitch-Based Products", edited by O. P. Bahl and L. M. Manocha, Indian Carbon Society, National Physical laboratory, New Delhi, 1989, p.58), a coke filler such as petroleum coke, or needle coke is kneaded with a pitch binder, such as coal tar pitch to obtain a mixture, which is isostatically pressed and then carbonised to 1000°C, followed by repeated cycles of<br>
impregnation and recarbonisation to 1000°C, and finally graphitisation to around 2700°C. Here, the impregnation and recarbonisation of the carbon product is a very cumbersome, time consuming and expensive process. Further, even inspite of several cycles of impregnation and recarbonisation of the carbon product, the bulk density of the final graphite seldom touches a value of 1.8 g cm-3 and the bending strength a value of 40 MPa. This is because large amounts of volatiles are evolved from the binder and impregnating pitches during the carbonisation / recarbonisation operations creating porosity in the product. Thus, this method suffers from its own limitations.<br>
In the second method (H. Honda and Y. YamadaJ. Jpn. Petrol. Inst., 16(1973)392; K.<br>
Hagiwara, N. Fukuda and  k. Nagayama, Jpn. Patent, No. 14,173(1989);  G. Bhatia , R. K.<br>
Aggarwal, N. Punjabi   and 0. P. Bahl, J. Mater, sci., 29(1994), 4757; G. Bhatia , R. K.<br>
Aggarwal, N. Punjabi and 0. P. Bahl, "An improved process for the production of high<br>
density  monolithic graphite from  mesocarbon  microbeads" - co-pending  Indian  Patent<br>
(Application, no.757/DEL/94), a quinoline insolubles (QI) - free or low-QI coal tar pitch<br>
is heat treated at about   400-450°C   in   an   inert   atmosphere to generate the mesophase<br>
Sphemles   with    a    size   of   around 10 microns.    These   spherules, also    known    as<br>
mesocarbon  microbeads (MCMB), are  separated   out   of the heat-treated pitch by solvent<br>
extraction using a suitable solvent such as tar oil or quinoline, pressed and then carbonised<br>
to 1000°C, and finally graphitised to 2700°C to obtain the high density graphite. During the<br>
heat-treatment at 400-450 °C, polymerisation and condensation  reactions take place among<br>
the various constituent molecules of the precursor coal tar pitch leading to the formation of<br>
large planar polyaromatic molecules   which   aggregate   together to form the mesophase<br>
sphemles because of the van der Waal's interactions and surface tension. These mesophase<br>
sphemles grow in size with the severity of heat-treatment. Therefore, to restrict their size to<br>
the desired value of around 10 microns, one has to lose in terms of their yield by weight of the precursor pitch. Generally, one is able to achieve a yield of 15-40 % of such mesophase spherules. Thus, in   this  method   again, there   is encountered a serious   techno economic problem of getting high yield of the mesophase spherules of the requisite size of around 10 microns, i.e. a yield of more than 40 % of the microbeads by weight of the precursor coal tar pitch upon heat treatment. Therefore this method also is not cost-effective. In the third method  as described by I. Ogawa, H. Yoshida and K. Kobayashi,in J. Mater. Sci., 16(1981), 2181;  by I. Ogawa, K. Kobayashi, in J. Mater. Sci., 27(1992),1161; by  G. Bhatia,  R. K. Agarwal and  0. P. Bahl, in  Proceedings National  Conference on Carbon, Kanpur, Dec. 19-20, 1991, Indian Carbon society, National Physical Laboratory New Delhi, 1996, p. 182; by G. Bhatia and R. K. Aggarwal, a green (raw) coke prepared from a coal tar pitch by heat treatment to around   500°C is   pressed, carbonised   to 1000°C   and   finally graphitized to 2700°C to get the high density graphite. In this method, the preparation of the green   coke   having an optimum   amount   of the   binding   components (volatile   matter around 10%) is a highly critical step, since a slight excess of the binding components in the  green  coke  will result in the swelling and/or cracks in the product during the baking operation, and slight   deficiency   of the binding components   will result in an   improper binding of the green coke panicles leading to a relatively weak and low density product. In view of this .generally , the starting coal tar pitch is first subjected to a mild heat treatment such that the greeen coke obtained    contains  slightly excess amount of the binding components . Such a green coke is then modified so as to contain an optimum amount of binding components by way of solvent extraction as described in an earlier patent by G. Bhatia, and R K aggarwal (Pat Application No. 395/DEL/96 )or oxidation/chlorination as described by A. Oya in the Proceedings of the Indo Japanese Workshop on Pitch and Pitch<br>
Based Products Ed O P Bahl and L .M.Manocha, Indian carbon Society, National Physical Laboratory New Delhi, (1989) page 58. Here the solvent extraction is quite cumbersome and expensive as it involves the use of solvents in large quantities (in wt./vol. ratio ofl:5 or more)followed by their recovery by way of distillation in an inert atmosphere and/or under reduced pressure at a temperature of 200° C to 400 °C . The recovery of solvent involves losses also. The oxidation/chlorianation , in rum is a very sensitive process and difficult to be controlled, to an optimal level.<br>
• Thus, we find that all the   methods explained   above for the production of high density<br>
I monolithic graphite are associated with their own typical problems.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide an improved   process   for the<br>
production of modified green coke useful for making high density monolithic   graphite<br>
products,   obviating   the above mentioned drawbacks.<br>
Another objective of the     invention is to provide a process for making    products  from<br>
modified green coke based high density monolithic graphite.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the<br>
(production of high density monolithic graphite having a bulk density of more than 1.8 gm/cc<br>
and having a homogeneous and fine microstructure.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a simple and economical process<br>
for the production of high density monolithic graphite products.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide high density monolithic graphite<br>
with potential applications   such as   electrodes   for   electric discharge   machines, and as<br>
material for hot-pressing    dies, casting    moulds, mechanical seals, resistance heaters,<br>
crucibles.<br>
The   present   invention is   based on the third   method of the above mentioned prior art,<br>
wherein the green coke with a slight excessive amount of binding components is subjected to oxidation, and on our finding that the sensitivity of the oxidation of the green coke can be reduced by carrying out the oxidation of green coke on a coarser size of less than 75 urn. The control over the oxidation treatment is achieved by characterizing the modified green coke with respect to quinoline and toluene insoluble contents and volatile matter cone tent. The resulting green coke is then found to lead to a crack free high density monolithic graphite.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved process for the production of modified green coke useful for making high density monolithic graphite, which comprises; heating coal tar pitch having characteristics as herein described in the presence of an inert gas, such as herein described a temperature in the range of 350-550°C to obtain green coke possessing quinoline insoluble (QI) in the range of 80-95% and toluene insoluble (TI) in the range of 85-97%, grinding the said green coke to a powder with a particle size of below 75 µm, subjecting the powdered green coke to oxidation in air or oxygen at a temperature in the range of 150-200°C, grinding the oxidized green coke to a size in the range of 1-30 µm, to obtain the modified green coke having enhanced QI in the range of (95-99%) and TI in the range of (96-99.5%).<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the coal tar pitch used may be such as having softening point in the range of 70-90 deg.C.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the inert gas used for the treatment of the coal tar pitch may be selected from nitrogen, helium or argon.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention heat treatment of the above coal tar pitch may be for a period of 1 to 7 hrs.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the oxidation may be carried out for a period of 10-100 hours.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for making high density monolithic graphite products using the modified green coke prepared by the process of the present invention, which comprises, moulding modified green coke powder into a product using conventional methods, carbonising the product by heating to a temperature of around 1000°C in an inert atmosphere, followed by graphitising the product at a temperature of around 2700°C in an inert atmosphere to get the high density monolithic graphite product. In an embodiment of the present invention, moulding of the modified green coke may be done by compression techniques.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the pressure used for compression of the modified green coke may be in the range of 1000-2500Kg/cm<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the inert gas used may be selected from helium, nitrogen or argon.<br>
The following  examples are given by way of illustration    which should, however, not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
A coal tar pitch having a softening point of 82°C, quinoline insoluble (QI) contents of 0.2 % and a coking value of 48.6 % was heat-treated at 520 °C for 1.5 hours to get the green coke. This green coke was ground to pass through 200 B.S. mesh and was found to possess a quinoline insoluble content of 91.8 %,toluene insoluble content of 95.2 % and a volatile matter content of 9.2 % . This coke was then subjected to an oxidation treatment in air at 180 °C for 40 hours followed by fine grinding to obtain the modified green coke powder. The resulting material i.e. modified green coke, was found to have a quinoline insoluble content of 96.1 % ,toluene insoluble content of 99.7 % and a volatile matter content of 10.3 % . The as-such green coke and the modified green coke powder were moulded into<br>
rectangular plates using a conventional hydraulic press, and  the  plates   so   obtained were carbonised to a temperature of 1000 °C. It was found that the plates made out of the as-such green coke (without the oxidation treatment) got   swollen on this heat-treatment to 1000°C, whereas those made out of the modified green coke remained completely in-  tact. The carbonised plates based on the modified green coke were then further heat-treated (graphitised) to 2700°C in an inert atmosphere of argon to obtain the final monolithic graphite plates, which were  found to  possess a bulk  density of 1.92 g/cm3   along with a bending strength of 74 MPa, Shore hardness of 70 and an electrical resistivity of 1.5 m Ohm.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
A coal tar pitch having a softening point of 74°C, quinoline insoluble (QI) content of 0.1 % and a coking value of 47.3 % was heat-treated   at 530 °C  for 1.0 hour to get the green coke. This green coke was ground to pass through 200 B.S.mesh and was found to possess a quinoline insoluble content of 92.5 %, toluene insoluble content of 94.4 % and a volatile matter content of 8.8 %. This green coke was then subjected to an oxidation-treatment at 170 °C for 60 hours in air   followed by fine grinding to obtain the modified green coke powder. The resulting material, i.e. modified green coke, was found to have a quinoline insoluble   content of 95.8 %, toluene   insolubles content of 98.3 % and   a   volatile matter content of 9.8 %. The as such green   coke and the modified green coke powders were moulded into rectangular plates using   a conventional   hydraulic   press, and the plates so obtained were carbonised to a temperature of 1000°C. It was found that the plates made out of the as-such green coke (without oxidation treatment) got swollen on this heat-treatment to 1000oC, whereas those made out of the modified green coke remained completely intact. The   carbonised   plates based on the modified green coke were then further heat-treated<br>
(graphitised) to 2700°C in an inert atmosphere of argon to obtain the final monolithic graphite plates, which were found to possess a bulk density of 1.94 g/cm3 along with a bending strength of 76 MPa, Shore hardness of 72 and an electrical resistivity of 1.4 m Ohm cm.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
A coal tar pitch having a softening point of 77°C, quinoline insoluble (QI) content of 0.1 % and a coking value of 49.3 % was heat-treated at 530 °C for 1.75 hours to get the green coke. This green coke was ground to pass through 200 B.S.mesh and was found to possess a quinoline insoluble content of 94.5 %, toluene insoluble content of 96.0 % and a volatile matter content of 8.2 %. This green coke was then subjected to an oxidation treatment at 170 °C for 20 hours in air   followed by fine grinding to obtain the modified green coke powder. The resulting material, i.e. modified green coke, was found to have a quinoline insoluble   content of 96.2 %, toluene insolubles   content of 97.8 % and   a   volatile matter content of 9.0 %. The as-such green   coke and the modified green coke powders were moulded into rectangular plates using   a conventional   hydraulic   press, and the plates so obtained were carbonised to a temperature of 1000°C. It was found that the plates made out of the as-such green coke (without oxidation treatment) got swollen on this heat-treatment to 1000°C. whereas  those  made  out  of the  modified   raw  coke  remained completely intact. The   carbonised   plates based on the modified green coke were then further heat-treated (graphitised) to 2700°C in an    inert    atmosphere    of argon to obtain the final monolithic graphite plates, which were found to possess a bulk density of 1.91 g/cm3 along with a bending strength of 68 MPa, Shore hardness of 66 and an electrical resistivity of 1.6 m Ohm cm.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
A coal tar pitch having a softening point of 87°C, quinoline insoluble (QI) content of 0.2 % and a coking value of 52.3 %  was heat-treated at 515 °C for 2.5 hours  to get the green coke. This green coke was ground to pass through 200 B.S.mesh and was found to possess a quinoline insoluble content of 93.2 %, toluene insoluble content of 94.6 % and a volatile matter content of 9.5 %. This green coke was then subjected to an oxidation treatment at 170 °C for 10 hours in oxygen followed by fine grinding  to obtain the modified green ;coke powder. The resulting material, i.e. modified green coke, was found to have a quinoline insoluble content of 97.6 %, toluene insoluble   content of 98.8 % and a   volatile matter content of 10.3 %. The as-such green   coke and the modified green coke powders were moulded into rectangular plates using   a conventional   hydraulic   press, and the plates so obtained were carbonised to a temperature of 1000°C. It was found that the plates made out of the as-such green coke (without oxidation treatment) got swollen on this heat-treatment to 1000°C, whereas   those  made  out  of the  modified  raw   coke  remained completely intact. The   carbonised   plates based on the modified green coke were then further heat-treated (graphitised) to 2700°C in an    inert    atmosphere    of argon to obtain the final monolithic graphite plates, which were found to possess a bulk density of 1.90 g/cm3 along with a bending strength of 76 MPa, Shore hardness of 73 and an electrical resistivity of 1.6 m Ohm cm. A summary of the above three examples is given below in Table-1.<br>
TABLE-1<br>
SUMMARY OF PROCESSING DETAILS AND CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RESULTING HIGH DENSITY MONOLITHIC GRAPHITES IN THE ABOVE FOUR EXAMPLES<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
NOTE: The figures in parentheses refer to the values of the as-such (without oxidation treatment) green coke powders.<br>
The novelty of the present invention is in eliminating the swelling and/or crack formation in<br>
the product during carbonisation.<br>
The inventive step of the present invention is in the    grinding  and oxidation of the green<br>
coke.   The first grinding step is to get a powder of size less than 75 µm followed by an<br>
oxidation step. The second step is in grinding the oxidised ground coke to a particle size in<br>
the range of l-30µm.<br>
The main advantages of the present invention are:<br>
1.   The sensitivity of the  oxidation   treatment in the process of the   present   invention is<br>
reduced by way of fine grinding of the green coke after the oxidation treatment and the<br>
control over the oxidation treatment is achieved by characterising the modified green coke<br>
with respect to quinoline and toluene insoluble contents and volatile matter content.<br>
2.	The high density monolithic graphite produced by the process of the present invention has<br>
a bulk density of 1.80 - 1.95 g/cm3, which is comparable to that of the graphite made from<br>
the green coke or mesocarbon microbeads methods and significantly higher than the value<br>
of 1.70 - 1.80 g/cm" for the conventional high density graphite.<br>
3.	The    process    of   the    present    invention    does    not involve repeated    cycles    of<br>
impregnation and recarboaisation which are employed in the process of the conventional<br>
high density graphite. Thus, the present process is not cumbersome and time consuming,<br>
and is hence economical.<br>
4.	The process  of the present invention does not involve the solvent extraction operation<br>
which is employed in the process of mesocarbon microbeads based high  density graphice.<br>
Besides this, the yield of the mesocarbon microbeads from  the  precursor is low (15-40%)<br>
whereas the process of the present invention gives a much higher yield of (65 -70 %). Thus,<br>
the present process is simple and cost effective.<br><br><br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1.	An improved process for the production of modified green coke useful for making<br>
high density monolithic graphite, which comprises; heating coal tar pitch having<br>
characteristics as herein described in the presence of an inert gas such as herein<br>
described at   a temperature in the range of 350-550°C to obtain green coke<br>
possessing quinoline insoluble (QI) in the range of 80-95% and toluene insoluble<br>
(TI) in the range of 85-97%, grinding the said green coke to a powder with a<br>
particle size of below 75 µm, subjecting the powdered green coke to oxidation in<br>
air or oxygen at a temperature in the range of 150-200°C, grinding the oxidized<br>
green coke to a size in the range of 1-30 µm, to obtain the modified green coke<br>
having enhanced QI in the range of (95-99%) and TI in the range of (96-99.5%).<br>
2.	An improved process as claimed in claim 1 wherein the coal tar pitch used is such<br>
as having softening point in the range of 70-90 C.<br>
3.	An improved process as claimed in claims 1 and 2 wherein the inert gas used for<br>
the heat treatment of the coal tar pitch is selected from nitrogen, helium or argon.<br>
4.	An improved process as claimed in claims 1-3 wherein the heat-treatment of the<br>
coal tar pitch is done for a period of 1 to 7 hours.<br>
5.	An improved process as claimed in claims 1-4 wherein the oxidation is carried out<br>
for a period in the range of 10-100 hours.<br>
6.	An improved process for the production of modified green coke useful for making<br>
high density monolithic graphite substantially as described herein with reference<br>
to the examples.<br></td>
