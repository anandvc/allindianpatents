				<td>This invention relates to a fire extinguishing device for gas blow-outs.<br>
Gas blow out is a national loss. It is not merely the loss of precious gaseous fuel uncontrollably getting burnt out but also it causes the damage to the environment and thus enormous hardship is caused on to the people living nearby due to leaping flames. Natural gas mainly contains methane. The stoichiometric fuel air ratio for combustion is 0.103 by volume and the stoichimetric flame temperature is 1900 degree Celsius. A part of the energy released due to combustion of gas is radiated and the rest is convected to the environment. The energy that is radiated is doing all the harm to the environment.<br>
The strategy employed in vogue to cap the blow out is to cool the surrounding environment by providing water umbrella. Under the cover of such water umbrella the work force precariously reach around the mouth of the well to clear the debris before capping the well. The quantity of water needed for providing water umbrella depends on the rate of gas blow-out and the height of the flame.<br>
The amount of water required for such operations is generally enormous. When such huge quantity of water is not available, use of explosives is resorted to. However, it is necessary to cool the surroundings with water otherwise the gas is likely to catch fire even after the use of explosives. Normally it takes 30 to 60 days for putting off the blow out and capping the well.<br>
The main object of this invention is to propose such a novel device which is able to put off the fire of the gas blow-outs as quickly as possible by employing a radiation absorption screen and the absorbed heat is used to raise steam which in turn is used to put off the blow-out.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a fire extinguishing device which reduces/minimizes the damage to environment.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to propose a novel fire extinguishing device for gas blow-outs so as to reduce the time needed to put off the flame is as minimum as possible and thereby reduce the losses resulting out of such gas blow-outs.<br>
According to this invention there is provided a fire estinguish system, comprising a movable platform supported on the wheels being provided for supporting a main frame thereon, a radiation wall secured with said main frame being provided for supporting a plurality of riser tubes therewith, a steam drum secured at the top of said frame being provided for the separation of steam from the hot water, a plurality of nozzles connected to the respective steam and water headers being provided for providing steam and cold water towards the gas blow outs, a control cabine being provided on said     platform   to  stear  and  control  the   different<br>
	   In accordance  with  this   invention   the<br>
principle employed is to absorb radiation heat of blow out by water cooled pre~fabricated site mounted panels. Such panels are moved very near to the mouth of the well so that the flame is surrounded from all sides by the panels to almost half of the height of the flame. The absorbed heat is  used to produce steam at low pressure and  this<br>
steam is used to put off the flame of the blow-out. Water sprayers are also used along with the steam to reduce the gas temperature further. The system has the means of movable panels to check the air flow to the gas blow out. Also, as the radiation panels surround the flame and the dampers attached below the movable platforms are operated to check the air flow on to the flame. The flame temperature gets reduced due to incomplete burn out of gas and as a consequence the height of the flame comes down. Working personnel can go safely very near to the well of the blow out for crash operations as most of the heat in the lower vicinity of the flame is absorbed by the wall panels. The debris removal becomes easy and subsequently capping operation becomes safe and easy.<br>
A fire extinguishing device according to a preferred embodiment is herein described and illustrated in the accompanying drawings wherein:-<br>
Fig.lA shows the elevation view of the system;<br>
Fig. IB shows the top view of the system;<br>
Fig. 2   shows the schematic view of the water circulation means;<br>
Fig. 3   shows the schematic view of the steam nozzle means; Fig.4    shows the schematic view of the water nozzle means.<br>
Referring to the drawings particularly fig.l, the fire extinguishing device has a movable platform 13 supported on the wheels 13 A. The platform 13 is provided for supporting feed pump 1, water pump 2 and circulation pump 3 thereon provided for feeding water to the steam drum 4, providing cold water to the nozzle 5 and circulating hot water in the riser tubes 7 respectively. The riser tubes 7 are accommodated in the semi-circular grooves (not shown) provided in the radiation wall 6 secured with the main frame 8. The radiation wall 6 is made of panels like water wall panels (not shown). The steam drum 4 is provided on the top of the main frame 8. The circulation pump 3 is mounted on the platform 13 such that water is drawn from the steam drum 4 and is fed to the hot water header 9. This water is passed through the riser tube 7 which is then fed to the steam drum 4 wherein the steam and hot water are separated.<br>
s  8 : water.   A  control chamber 14 is provided on  the platform  14 in order to stear the movement of  the platform and to control the different functions of the  fire extinguisher.<br>
The top end of the riser tubes as shown in fig.2 are connected to the steam drum 4 . The lower end of the riser tubes are connected to the hot water header and which is connected to the circulation pump 3 provided for circulating the water into the riser tube 7 continuously. A control valves VI and V2 arr provided with the conveying pipes between the pump and steam drum 4 and between the pump and water header 11 in order to control the water circulation as per the requirements.<br>
As shown in fig.3 the steam nozzles 12 are connected to steam header 10 through a control valve v"4. The steam header 10 is connected to steam drum 4 through a valve V3. Further, a drain pipe having a control valve V7 is provided with the steam header 10 in order to drain the excess /extra steam therefrom.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
