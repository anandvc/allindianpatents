The present invention relates to fungiciclal detergent compositions and to the use of such compositions for the fungicidal treatment of hard surfaces and textile fibre materials.<br>
Under high humid conditions and warm temperatures, fungi develop damp and unpleasant odors on fabrics. Some fungi species as Chaetomium globosum are known to produce geosmin, a volatile organic compound with a distinct "earthy" odor.<br>
Some discoloration can occur due to the formation of masses of colored spores. Changes in the color fabric are caused by acids and other substances produced by fungi.<br>
Mildewed areas are colored from green to shades of brown and deep black. Chaetomium globosum, a very common fungus related with occurrence of mildew on fabrics, produces dark grayish green .stains on fabrics. The pigment formation is also caused by the acids produced by the action of mildew on cellulose, soil and other food substances present on the fabric.<br>
Enzymes produced by fungus can lead to the fabric deterioration and rot. Some species are known for being cellulose eaters like Chaetomium globosum.<br>
Cleaning and disinfectant compositions comprising fungicidal active ingredients, e.g. hand and machine dishwashing formulations, cleaning and disinfecting formulations for hard surfaces and liquid and solid textile washing formulations, are therefore becoming ever more widespread. The fungicidal action and dust mites growth control is more and more a required demand for such formulations.<br>
It has now surprisingly been found that detergent compositions comprising as fungicidal active the compound of formula (1)<br>
wherein <br>
Ri   is hydrogen; or C-rC5alkyl;<br>
exhibit strong fungicidal effects for hard surfaces and textile materials.<br><br>

proteases as given in US-B-6,242,405, column 14, lines 21 to 32; lipases as given in US-B-6,242,405, column 14, lines 33 to 46; amylases as given in US-B-6,242,405, column 14, lines 47 to 56; and cellulases as given in US-B-6,242,405, column 14, lines 57 to 64.<br>
The enzymes can optionally be present in the detergent. When used, the enzymes are usually present in an amount of 0.01-5% by weight, preferably 0.05-5% and more preferably 0.1-4% by weight, based on the total weight of the detergent.<br>
The composition according to the invention may additionally comprise<br>
(k)  an antimicrobial aqent selected from 2-hydroxy-diphenyl ether of formula<br>

Y is chlorine or bromine, Z is SO2H, NO2 or CrC4alkylt r   is from 0 to 3, o  is from 0 to 3,<br><br>
p  is 0, 1 or 2, m is 1 or 2 and n  is 0 or 1, and more especially a compound of formula<br><br>
The present invention therefore relates to a detergent composition, preferably for the fungicidal treatment of hard surfaces comprising<br>
(a)	0.01 to 90 % by weight of a compound of formula (1) according to claim 1;<br>

combinations of the mentioned substances;<br>
(f)	0 to 50 % by weight of one or more hydrotropic agents,<br>
(g)	0 to 50 % by weight of an alcohol,<br>
(k)  0.00 to 50 % by weight of an antimicrobial agent selected from 2-hydroxy-diphenyl<br>
â <br>
ether of formula (2); and (i)   tap water or deionized water ad 100 %.<br>
The compounds of formula (1) are preferably used as fungicidal agent in laundry compositions.<br>
Therefore, the present invention relates to a process for the domestic washing and fungicidal treatment of a textile fibre material wherein the textile fibre material is contacted with an aqueous solution of a detergent composition comprising a compound of formula (1).<br><br>
Preferably, the detergent composition contains at least one enzyme selected from the group consisting of cellulase, protease, amyiase and lipase, and the temperature of the solution is between 5Â°C and 40Â°C, preferably between 5Â°C and 30Â°C, throughout the process.<br>
Further preferred additives for the detergents according to the invention are polymers that, during the washing of textiles, inhibit staining caused by dyes in the washing liquor that have been released from the textiles under the washing conditions (dye fixing agents, dye transfer inhibitors). Such polymers are preferably polyvinylpyrrolidones, polyvinylimidazoles or polyvinylpyridine N-oxides which may have been modified by the incorporation of anionic or cationic substituents, especially those having a molecular weight in the range from 5000 to 60 000, more especially from 10 000 to 50 000. Such polymers are usually used in an amount of from 0.01 to 5 %, preferably 0.05 to 5 % by weight, especially 0.1 to 2 % by weight, based on the total weight of the detergent. Preferred polymers are those given in WO-A-02/02865 (see especially page 1, last paragraph and page 2, first paragraph).<br>
The detergents used will usually contain one or more auxiliaries such as soil suspending agents, for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose; salts for adjusting the pH, for example alkali or alkaline earth metal silicates; foam regulators, for example soap; salts for adjusting the spray drying and granulating properties, for example sodium sulphate; perfumes; and also, if appropriate, antistatic and softening agents; such as smectite clays; photobleaching agents; pigments; and/or shading agents. These constituents should, of course, be stable to any bleaching system employed. Such auxiliaries can be present in an amount of, for example, 0.1 to 20% by weight, preferably 0:5 to 10 % by weight, especially 0.5 to 5 % by weight, based on the total weight of the detergent.<br>
The detergent compositions can take a variety of physical forms including powder, granular, tablet and liquid forms. Examples thereof are conventional powder heavy-duty detergents, compact and supercompact heavy-duty detergents and tablets, like heavy-duty detergent tablets. One important physical form is the so-called concentrated granular form adapted to be added to a washing machine.<br>
Of importance are also the so-called compact (or supercompact) detergents. In the field of detergent manufacture, a trend has developed recently towards the production of compact detergents, which contain increased amounts of active substance. In order to minimize<br><br>
energy expenditure during the washing process, the compact detergents are required to operate efficiently at temperatures as low as 40Â°C, or even at room temperatures, e.g. at 25Â°C. Such detergents usually contain only low amounts of fillers or processing aids, like sodium sulfate or sodium chloride. The amount of such fillers is usually 0-10% by weight, preferably 0-5 % by weight, especially 0-1 % by weight, based on the total weight of the detergent. Such detergents usually have a bulk density of 650-1000 g/l, preferably 700-1000 g/l and especially 750-1000 g/l.<br>
The detergents can also be present in the form of tablets. Relevant characteristics of tablets are ease of dispensing and convenience in handling. Tablets are the most compact delivery of solid detergents and have a bulk density of, for example, 0.9 to 1.3 kg/litre. To enable fast disintegration laundry detergent tablets generally contain special disintegrants:<br>
Effervescents such as carbonate/hydrogencarbonate/citric acid;<br>
swelling agents like cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, cross-linked poly(N-vinylpyrro-<br>
Ilidone);<br>
quickly dissolving materials such as Na (K) acetate, or Na (K) citrate;<br>
rapidly dissolving water-soluble rigid coating such as dicarboxy acids.<br>
The tablets can also contain combinations of any of the above disintegrants.<br>
The detergent may also be formulated as an aqueous liquid comprising 5-50, preferably 16-35% water or as a non-aqueous liquid detergent, containing not more than 5, preferably 0-1 wt.% of water. Non-aqueous liquid detergent compositions can contain other solvents as carriers. Low molecular weight primary or secondary alcohols exemplified by methanol, ethanol, propanol, and isopropanol are suitable. Monohydric alcohols are preferred for solubilizing surfactant, but polyols such as those containing from 2 to about 6 carbon atoms and from 2 to about 6 hydroxy groups (e.g., 1,3-propanediol, ethylene glycol, glycerine, and 1,2-propanediof) can also be used. The compositions may contain from 5% to 90%, typically 10% to 50% of such carriers. The detergents can also be present as the so-called "unit liquid dose" form.<br>
This detergent treatment of textiles can be conducted as a domestic treatment in normal washing machines.<br><br>
The textile fibres treated with the process of the present invention may be natural or synthetic fibres or mixtures thereof. Examples of natural fibres include vegetable fibres such as cotton, viscose, flax, rayon or linen, preferably cotton and animal fibres such as wool, mohair, cashmere, angora and silk, preferably wool. Synthetic fibres include polyester, polyamide and polyacrylonitrile fibres. Preferred textile fibres are cotton, polyamide and wool fibres, especially cotton fibres. Preferably, textile fibres treated according to the method of the present invention have a density of less than 200 g/m2.<br>
According to this process usually an amount of 0.01 to 3.0% by weight, especially 0.05 to 3.0% by weight, based on the weight of the textile fibre material, of a the compound of formula (1).<br>
The process is usually conducted in the temperature range of from 5 to 100Â°C, especially 5 to 60Â°C. Preferred is a temperature range of 5 to 40Â°C, especially 5 to 35Â°C and more preferably 5 to 30Â°C.<br>
The detergent compositions herein will preferably be formulated such that, during use in aqueous cleaning operations, the wash water will have a pH of between about 6.5 and about 11, preferably between about 7.5 and 11. Laundry products are typically at pH 9-11. Techniques for controlling pH at recommended usage levels include the use of buffers, alkalis, acids, etc., and are well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
i'<br>
Machine laundry methods herein typically comprise treating soiled laundry with an aqueous wash solution in a washing machine having dissolved or dispensed therein an effective amount of a machine laundry detergent composition in accordance with the invention. By an effective amount of the detergent composition it is meant, e.g., from 20 g to 300 g of product dissolved or dispersed in a wash solution of volume from 5 to 85 litres, as are typical product dosages and wash solution volumes commonly employed in conventional machine laundry methods. Examples are<br>
top-loading, vertical axis U.S.-type automatic washing machines using about 45 to 83 liters of water in the wash bath, a wash cycle of about 10 to about 14 minutes and a wash water temperature of about 10 to about 50Â°C;<br><br>
front-loading, horizontal-axis European-type automatic washing machine using about 8 to 15 liters of water in the wash bath, a wash cycle of about 10 to about 60 minutes and a wash water temperature of about 30 to about 95Â°C;<br>
top-loading, vertical-axis Japanese-type automatic washing machine using about 26 to 52 liters of water in the wash bath, a wash cycle of about 8 to about 15 minutes and a wash water temperature of about 5 to about 25Â°C.<br>
The liquor ratio is preferably 1:4 to 1:40, especially 1:4 to 1:15. Highly preferred is a liquor ratio of 1:4 to 1:10, especially 1:5 to 1:9.<br>
Using the composition according to the invention it is possible to destroy fungi present on the washing material in the dilute liquor during the washing procedure. At the same time, antifungal properties are imparted to the washed textile material, that is to say bacteria that get on the textile material while it is being worn are destroyed.<br>
The formulations according to the invention exhibit strong fungicidal activity.<br>
The compositions according to the invention are also used as solid soaps, dishwashing formulations or all-purpose cleaners.<br>
A detergent has, for example, the following composition:<br>
0:01 to 5% by weight of a compound of the formula (1),<br>
3.0% by weight of octanol 4EO,<br>
1.3% by weight fatty alcphol C8-Ci0 polyglucoside,<br>
3.0% by weight isopropanol, and<br>
water to 100%.<br>
The detergent compositions of the present invention deliver to the laundry fungistatic and fungicidal properties that keeps your fabrics protected against mildew and mold.They prevent growth of molds and fungi on fabrics, protect garments against musty odor, damages in the fiber resistance and avoid formation of dark pigmented stains caused by fungi. They provide long lasting antifungal effects on fabrics even during storage under moist and warm conditions. Consequently, garments will keep their freshness.preserved much longer.<br><br>
Furthermore, the compounds of formula (1) are also useful active agents against dust mites.<br>
