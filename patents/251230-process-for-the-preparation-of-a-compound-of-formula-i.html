Alternative Procedures for the preparation of the product of preparation 6<br>
The product of preparation 6 can be prepared by stereoselective enzymatic reduction of N-[2-benzyloxy-5-(2-bromo-acetyl)-phenyl]-methanesulfonamide (Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 1967, 10, 462 and Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 1980, 23, 738), as described in the Journal of the American Oil Chemists' Society 1998, 75,1473 as well as in the examples below.<br>
A biotransformation can be achieved by those skilled in the art by contacting the substance to be transformed, and other necessary reactants, with the enzymes derived from a variety of living organisms under conditions suitable for a chemical interaction to occur. Subsequently, the products of the reaction are separated and those of interest are purified for elucidation of their chemical structure and physical and biological properties. The enzymes can be present as purified reagents, be in crude extracts or lysates, or be in intact cells and can be in solution, be in suspension (e.g., intact cells), be covalently attached to a supporting surface, or be embedded in a permeable matrix (e.g., agarose or alginate beads). The substrate and other necessary reactants (e.g., water, air, cofactors) are supplied as the chemistry dictates. Generally, the reaction is carried out in the presence of one or more liquid phases, aqueous and/or organic, to promote mass transfer of the reactants and products. The reaction can be conducted aseptically or not. The conditions for monitoring the progress of the reaction and the Isolation of the products of the reaction will vary according to the physical properties of the reaction system and the chemistry of the reactants and products.<br>
For whole-cell biocatalysis, a nutrient medium (e.g., IOWA Medium: dextrose, yeast extract, dipotassium hydrogen phosphate, sodium chloride, soybean flour, water; adjusted to neutral pH) is added to one or more culture vessels (e.g., fermentation tubes or flasks) that are then steam-sterilized. Each vessel is aseptically inoculated with growth from an agar culture, a suspension of washed cells or spores, or broth from a liquid nutrient medium culture of the biotransforming microorganism. The vessels are mounted on a shaker designed for fermentation and shaken (e.g., rotary operation at 100-300 rpm) at an appropriate temperature (e.g., 20-40°C) long enough to promote the growth of the microorganism to a suitable population size (e.g., 1-3 days). <br>
