(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R, R1 and n are as hereinbefore defined;<br>

(Formula Removed)<br>
to give a compound of formula (II)<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 wherein R, R1 and n are as hereinbefore defined, and<br>
(ii)	the reaction of a compound of formula (II) with	<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein L is a<br>
leaving group, to give the compound of formula (I).<br>
By the term "alkanediyl" and "alkanetriyl", we mean an alkane group having two or three free valancies respectively (i.e. two or three missing hydrogen atoms), suitably the free valancies being on different carbon atoms.<br>
By the term "alkenediyl" and "alkenetriyl", we mean an alkene group having two or three free valancies respectively, suitably the free valancies being on different carbon atoms.<br>

Step (i) is suitably performed in the temperature range of 50Â° to 150Â°C. The reaction can be performed in melt or in the presence of an inert solvent, for example toluene, xylene, chlorobenzene etc. The reaction temperature depends on the reactivity of the ester. To an ester of low reactivity like methylester, ethylester or benzylester, an alcohol of high reactivity like diethylaminoethanol, ethyleneglycol, triethanolamine or propargylalcohol can be added or the ester of the named alcohols directly used to decrease reaction temperature and avoid side reactions. The reaction temperature is normally between 70Â°C and 120Â°C. At higher temperatures the formation of by-products is increased.<br>
Step (ii) is suitably carried out in the most common polar and non-polar solvents (for example hydrocarbons e.g. toluene, xylene or chlorinated hydrocarbons e.g. chlorobenzene or ethers e.g. THF, dioxane, anisole or nitriles e.g. acetonitrile) or mixtures with water in the presence of a base like alkali metal hydroxides, alkaline earth metal hydroxides or carbonates. The solvent or solvent mixture is suitably inert against the compound (II) and the base. The base is suitably applied in a wide range, preferably in the range of 1-2 mole per mole of compound (II). The use of a phase transfer catalyst like ternary ammonium salts in the range of 0.5-10 mole% is of advantage.

Step (ii) to (v) are carried out as described above.<br>
Compounds of formulae (IV), (X), (XIV), (XV) and (XVI) are known in the art and processes for their preparation are readily available to the skilled person.<br>
Alternatively, compounds of formula (IV) may be prepared by a novel process according to the following reaction scheme:<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The prior art processes for preparing compounds of formula (IVA) generate a considerable quantity of aqueous waste and/or use expensive catalysts; the aqueous waste generated needs to be treated (destruction of cyanide with bleach or hydrogen peroxide), which is very expensive and generates waste waters, which still contain toxic components.<br><br>
In the above scheme, compound (IVB) is converted to compound (IVA) by one of the following process:<br>
(i)      reacting compound (IVB) with a cyanide e.g. sodium or potassium cyanide (preferably with a slight excess) at a pH of between 5 and 9, preferably between 6 and 7 and subsequently reducing the pH to below 3 or<br>
(ii)      reacting compound (IVB) with HCN in an organic or aqueous solvent; or<br>
(iii)     reacting compound (IVB) with acetone cyanohydrin in the presence of a catalytic amount of cyanide or an ordinary base.<br>
Compound (IVA) is then reduced using H2/Pd-C and H2SPO4MeOH. In a first method, the H2/Pd-C and H2SO4/MeOH are added together and the process proceeds via intermediate (IVA"); in a second method the H2SO4/MeOH is added first to give intermediate (IVA'), followed by reduction using H2/Pd-C.<br>
Thus, a further embodiment of the invention provides a process for the preparation of compound (IV), said process comprising:<br>
(i)      the reaction of compound (IVB)<br>
(a)	with a cyanide e.g. sodium or potassium cyanide (preferably with a slight-<br>
excess) at a pH of between 5 and 9, preferably between 6 and 7 and subsequently reducing the<br>
pH to below 3 or<br>
(b)	with HCN in an organic or aqueous solvent; or<br>
(c)	with acetone cyanohydrin in the presence of a catalytic amount of -    .<br>
cyanide or an ordinary base;<br>
to give compound (IVA), and<br>
(ii)     the reduction of compound (IV A) using H2/Pd-C and H2SO4/MeOH via intermediate (IVA') or (IVA") and its tautomers to give compound (IV).<br>
Intermediates (IVA') as well as (IVA") and its "hydroxyenamine" tautomer are also novel and form a further aspect of the invention.<br>
The preparation of a compound of formula (II) from a compound of formula (HI) is also a novel and inventive process and accordingly provides a further aspect of the present invention.<br>
Many of the intermediates of formula (II), (III), (V), (VI), (VII), (XI) or (XII), in particular where R1 is halo e.g. 4-chloro, are also novel and accordingly individually provide a further aspect of the invention.<br>
A reaction scheme depicting all the various reactions described above is given in Figure 1.<br><br>
