				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a substituted ecteinascidin compound and also the present invention relates to antitumoral compounds and in particular to antitumoral analogs of ecteinascidin 743, ET-743.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
European Patent 309,477 relates to ecteinascidins729,743,745, 759A. 759B and 770.  The ecteinascidin compounds are disclosed to have antibacterial and other useful properties.  Ecteinascidin 743 is now undergoing clinical trials as an antitumour agent.<br>
Ecteinascidin 743 has a complex tris(tctrahydroisoquinolinephenol) structure of the following formula (I):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Jn ecteinascidin 743, the 1,4 bridge has the structure of formula (TV):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Other known ecteinascidins include compounds with a different bridged cyclic ring system, such as occurs in ecteinascidin 722 and 736, where the bridge has the structure of formula (V):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
ecteinascidins 583 and 597, where the bridge has the structure of formula (VI):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
and ecteinascidin 594 and 596, where the bridge has the structure of formula (VII):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The complete structure for these and related compounds is given in J. Am. Chem.<br>
Soc. (1996) 118, 9017-9023. This article is incorporated by reference.<br>
The ecteinascidins are currently prepared by isolation from extracts of the marine tunicate Ecieinascidin turbinata. The yield is low, and alternative preparative processes have been sought.<br>
A synthetic process for producing ecteinascidin compounds is described in US Patent 5,721,362, see also WO 9812198.   The claimed method is long and complicated.   By way of illustration, there are 38 Examples each describing one or more steps in the synthetic sequence to arrive at ecteinascidin 743.<br>
Claim 25 of US 5,721,362 is directed at an intermediate phenol compound of a given formula (11), which we refer to also as Intermediate 11 or Int-11.   It has the following bis(tetrahydroisoquinolinephenol) structure (II):<br>
(Structure Removed)<br>
where MOM is a methoxymethyl substituent and TBDPS is a tert-butyldiphenylsilyl substituent.<br>
From Intermediate 11 it is possible to synthesise another interesting antitumour agent, phthalascidin, see Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 96, 3496-3501, 1999.   Phthalascidin is a    . bis(tetrahydroisoquinolinephenol) derivative of formula (III):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
generally, phthalascidin and related compounds are described in WO 0018233. Claim 1 is directed at compounds of formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein the substituent groups defined by R1, R2. R3, R4. R5. R6. R7. R8 and R9 are each independently selected from the group consisting of H, OH, OR', SH, SR'. SOR'. S02R', NO2, NH2, NHR', N(R')2, NHC(0)R', CN, halogen,=0, C(=O)H, C(=O)R", C02H, CO2R', C1-C12 alkyl, C2-C12 alkenyl, C2-C12 alkynyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, substituted or unsubstituted aralkyl, and substituted or unsubstituted heteroaromatic;<br>
wherein each of the R' groups is independently selected from the group consisting of H, OH, NO2, NH2, SH, CN, halogen, =0, C(=O)H, C(=O)CH3, CO2H, CO2CH3, CrC,2 alkyl, C2--C12 alkenyl, C2-C12 alkynyl, aryl, aralkyl, and heteroaromatic;<br>
wherein each dotted circle represents one, two or three optional double bonds; wherein R? and Rg may be joined into a carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring system;<br><br>
and wherein Xi and X: are each independently defined as above for RpRg and further include various permitted definitions.<br>
Further naturally occuring compounds are known which lack a bridged cyclic ring system.   They include the bis(tetrahydroisoquinolinequinone) antitumor-antimicrobial antibiotics safracins and saframycins. and the marine natural products renieramicins and xestomycin isolated from cultured microbes or sponges.   They all have a common dimeric tetrahydroisoquinoline carbon framework.   These compounds can be classified into four types, types I to IV, with respect to the oxidation pattern of the aromatic rings.<br>
Type I, dimeric isoquinolinequinones, is a system of formula (VIII) most commonly occurring in this class of compounds, see the following table I.<br>
Table I<br>

(Formula And Table Removed)<br>
" assignments are interchangeable. b where the group Q is of formula (IX):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Type I aromatic rings are seen in saframycins A, B and C; G and H: and S isolated<br>
from Streptomyces lavendulae as minor components.  A cyano derivative of saframycin A,<br>
; called cyanoquinonamine, is known from Japanese Kokai JP-A2 59/225189 and 60/084288.<br>
Saframycins Y3, Ydi, Adj, and Yd2 were produced by S. lavendulae by directed biosynthesis, with appropriate supplementation of the culture medium.  Saframycins Y2b and Y2b-d dimers formed by linking the nitrogen on the C-25 of one unit to the C-14 of the other, have also been produced in supplemented culture media of 5. lavendulae.  Saframycins ARi (=AH2,), a microbial reduction product of saframycin A at C-25 produced by Rhodococcus amidophilus, is also prepared by nonstereoselective chemical reduction of saframycin A by sodium borohydride as a 1:1 mixture of epimers followed by chromatographic separation<br>
[the other isomer AH| is less polar].   The further reduction product saframycin ARj. 21 -decyano-25-dihydro-saframycin A. (= 25-dihydrosaframycin B) was produced by the same microbial conversion.  Another type of microbial conversion of saframycin A using a Nocardia species produced saframycin B and further reduction by a Mycobacterhim species produced saframycin AH1 Ac.   The 25-0-acetates of saframycin AH: and AH1 have also been prepared chemically for biological studies.<br>
Type I compounds of formula (X) have also been isolated from marines sponges, see Table II.<br>

 (Formula And Table  Removed)<br>
Renieramycins A-D were isolated from the antimicrobial extract of a sponge, a Reniera species collected in Mexico, along with the biogenetically related monomeric isoquinolines renierone and related compounds. The structure of renieramycin A was<br>
initially assigned with inverted stereochemistry at C-3, C-l 1, and C-13.  However, careful examination of the 'H NMR data for new, related compounds renieramycins E and F, isolated from the same sponge collected in Palau. revealed that the ring junction of renieramycins was identical to that of saframycins.  This result led to the conclusion that the formerly assigned stereochemistry of renieramycins A to D must be the same as that of saframycins.<br>

Xestomycin was found in a sponge, aXesfospongia species collected from Sri Lancan<br>
waters.<br>
Type II compounds of formula (XI) with a reduced hydroquinone ring include<br>
saframycins D and F, isolated from 5. lavendulae, and saframycins MX- 1 and Mx-2, isolated<br>
from Myxococcus xanthus.  See table III.	~"<br>

The type III skeleton is found in the antibiotics safracins A and B, isolated from cultured Pseudomonasflnorescens.  These antibiotics of formula (XII) consist of a tetrahydroisoquinoline-quinone subunit and a tetrahydroisoquninolinephenol subunit.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
2 where R21 is -H in safracin A and is -OH in safracin B.<br>
Saframycin R, the only compound classified as the Type IV skeleton, was also isolated from S. lavendulae.  This compound of formula (XIII), consisting of a hydroquinone ring with a glycolic ester sidechain on one of the phenolic oxygens, is conceivably a pro-drug of saframycin A because of its moderate toxicity.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
All these known compounds have a fused system of five rings (A) to (£) as shown in the following structure of formula (XTV):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The rings A and £ are phenolic in the ecteinascidins and some other compounds, while in other compounds, notably the saframycins, the rings A and £ are quinolic.   In the known compounds, the rings B and D are tetrahydro, while ring C is perhydro.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides new compounds with the fused system of five rings (A) to (E).  In particular, it provides new compounds which can be made from intermediates described in WO 9812198 or by a new process which is part of this invention.  In this latter respect, we refer to our WO 0069862 published 23 November 2000, and which relates to hemisynthetic methods and new compounds.  The present application claims priority from that PCT filing, and we incorporate that text by reference to the extent that there is disclosure therein which is not in the present specification.<br>
In WO 0069862, various routes are described for the preparation of ecteinascidin compounds, including ecteinascidin 743, as well as ecteinascidin analogs including phthaliscidin.  The present invention is founded partly on the use of intermediates of WO 0069862 to prepare further analogs of the ecteinasacidins.<br>

The present invention also extends to the compounds of the invention for use in a method of treatment, and to the use of the compounds in the preparation of a composition for treatment of cancer.<br>
In one aspect of the invention, we make no claim to the compounds 2.3. 5. 8-OH-2. and 14 to 21 described in one or more of the GB priority patent applications for our PCT application published as 0069862.   In a related aspect, the present invention extends to compounds which differ in respect of one or more of the substituents present at C-l. C-5. C-7, C-8, or C-l 8 in the compounds of these GB priority patent applications.<br>
The compounds of this invention include compounds which do not have a hydroxy group at the C-18 position.  Furthermore, the compounds of this invention include compounds which do not have a dicarboximidomethyl substituent, such as phthalimidomethyl, at the C-l position.  In particular, we provide active compounds where the subsituent X\ is not as shown in the penultimate line at page 19 of WO0018233.<br>
In one aspect, the analogs of this invention are typically of the formula (XVIIa):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
or formula (XVIIb):<br>
where<br>
R1 is an optionally protected or derivatised aminomethylene group, an optionally protected or<br>
derivatised hydroxymethylene group;<br>
R4 is -H;<br>
R5 is -H or -OH ;<br>
R7 is -OCH3 and R8 is -OH or R7 and R8 together form a group -O-CH2-O-;<br>
Rl4a and R14b are both -H or one is -H and the other is -OH, -OCH3 or -OCH:CH:,. or RI4a<br>
and Rl4b together form a keto group; and<br>
R15 is -H or -OH;<br>
R21is-H,-OHor-CN;<br>
and derivatives including acyl derivatives thereof especially where R' is acetyloxy or other<br>
acyloxy group of up to 4 carbon atoms.<br>
In the present invention, a key class of products includes phthalascidin and has the general formula (XX):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where R1 is an amidomethylene group; R5 is a small oxy-sidechain; and R21 is a cyano group or a hydroxy group.   For phthalascidin, R1 is a phthalimidomethylene group; R5 an acetoxy group; and R21 is a cyano group.   Other groups for R1 include mono- and di-N-substituted amidomethylenes as well as other cyclic amidomethylenes, and other groups for R5 include further C1-C4 acyl groups, as well as C1-C4 alkyl groups.<br>
In the present invention, a key class of intermediates and analogs includes Intermediate 11 and has the general formula (XXI):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
where Prot1 and Prot2 are hydroxy protecting groups, preferably different.  For Intermediate 11 itself, the group Prot1 is a methoxymethyl group, and Prot2 is a t-butyldiphenylsilyl group.<br>
In the light of the preceding explanations, it can be seen that the present invention provides novel analogs and novel intermediate compounds.   Depending on ring A, the compounds include those of formula (XXIIa):<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
or of formula (XXIIb):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where:<br>
R1 is -CH2NH2 or -CH2OH, or a protected or derivatised version of such a group and R4 is -<br>
H;<br>
R5 is -OH or a protected or derivatised version of such a group;<br>
RI4a and R14b are both -H or one is -H and the other is -OH or a protected or derivatised<br>
version of such a group, -OCH3 or -OCH2CH3, or R14' and R14b together form a keto group;<br>
R12 is -H-, -CH3- or -CH2CH3-;<br>
R15 is -H, -OH or a protected or derivatised version of such a group; and<br>
R18 is -OH or a protected or derivatised version of such a group.<br>
In one embodiment, preferably at least of R1 . R5. Rl4a. RMb. R15 or R18 is a protected or derivatised group.<br>
In one variation of this invention, the group R1 is not a tert-buryldiphenylsilyl<br>
I fi<br>
substituent and/or the group R   is not a methoxymethyloxy group.<br>
Preferably R1 is -CHaNfy or -CHjOH, or a protected or derivatised version of such a group and R4 is -H.<br>
Preferably RI4a and R14b are both -H. Preferably R12 is -CH3.<br>
One preferred class of intermediates includes the compound which we identify as compound 25, of formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The preferred class is thus of the general formula where the group MOM is replaced by any other protecting group, and/or the allyl is replaced by any other protecting group.<br>
Other preferred intermediates includes the compounds which we identify as compounds 17, 43 and 45.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Other N-acyl derivatives may readily be made from compound 45 and are an important part of this invention.   Suitable acyl groups include those previously mentioned.   The corresponding 21-hydroxy compounds are also useful and are among the active compounds which we have found.<br>
From the activity data and other considerations, it can be seen that the active compounds of this invention include a preferred class of compounds of the general formula (XXIII):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where R1 is as previously defined for formula (XVJIb) and is preferably a derivatised aminomethylene group of moderate bulk;<br>
R5 is as previously defined for formula (XVIIb) and is preferably a derivatised hydroxy group of low bulk;<br>
R12 is as previously defined and is preferably -CHa-; and<br>
R21 is a hydroxy or cyano group.<br>
R1 is suitably a hydrophobic group and which thus lacks free amino, hydroxy or other hydrophilic function.  Typically R1 is a group -CHa-NHj-CO-R", where Ra is as defined but preferably has a linear chain length of less than 20 atoms, more preferably less than 15 or 10 atoms, where a 1,4-phenyl is counted as a chain length of four atoms and similar considerations apply to other cyclic groups (for example, 1,2-cycIohexyl is chain length of two), and the linear chain of less than 10,15 or 20 atoms can itself be substituted.  In particular, the data suggests there is a balance to be achieved between having no such group Ra-C0- and having a large, bulky group.<br>
In one variation, we prefer that R1 is free from cyclic groups, especially aromatic groups.   In a related variation, the present invention does not prepare the compounds which are described in the article Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 96, 3496-3501, 1999, incorporated by reference.  Our preferred groups for R1 exclude the corresponding substituents CHiR: shown in Table 1 of that article, specifically the groups A, B, C and D for Ra-<br>
Rs is preferably an acetyl group.<br>
In particularly preferred compounds, the group R1 is acylated on an -NH? group, and for example N-acyl derivatives can be formed from groups -CHiNHi and -CH^-NH-aa.  The acyl derivatives can be N-acyl or N-thioacyl derivatives thereof.  The acyl groups can be of formula -CO-Ra, where Ra is as defined and is chosen to meet the indicated criteria. Suitable acyl groups include alanyl, arginyl, aspartyl, asparagyl, cystyl, glutamyl, glutaminyl, glycyl, histidyl, hydroxyprolyl., isoleucyl, leucyl, lysyl, methionyl, phenylalanyl, prolyl, seryl, threonyl, thyronyl, tryptophyl, tyrosyl, valyl, as well as other amino acid acyl groups, which may be L- or D-.  Such amino acid acyi groups are preferred derivatised on the amino group to give hydrophobicity.<br>
In a variation, the group R1 is a derivatised hydroxymethylene group. Similar considerations apply as with the derivatised aminomethylene group.<br>
The invention extends to compounds where the various substituents around the ring are as defined in the WO 0018233, which we incorporate by reference.  Thus, as<br>
appropriate, substituents in the present compounds can be chosen, among other possibilites from H, OH, OR', SH, SR', SOR', S02R', N02, NH2, NHR', N(R')2, NHC(0)R', CN, halogen, =0, Ci-C6 alkyl, substituted or unsubstiruted aryl, substituted or unsubstiruted aralkyl, and substituted or unsubstiruted heteroaromatic;<br>
wherein each of the R' groups is independently selected from the group consisting of H, OH, NO2, NH2, SH, CN, halogen, =0, C(=0)H, C(=0)CH3, C02H, C02CH3. C,-C6 alkyl. phenyl. benzyl and heteroaromatic.<br>
Suitable halogen substituents in the compounds of the present invention include F. Cl, Br and I.<br>
Alkyl groups preferably have from 1 to about 12 carbon atoms, more preferably 1 to about 8 carbon atoms, still more preferably 1 to about 6 carbon atoms, and most prefereably 1,2,3 or 4 carbon atoms. Methyl, ethyl and propyl including isopropyl are particularly preferred alkyl groups in the compounds of the present invention.

In a related aspect, the present invention is directed at the use of a known compound, safracin B, also referred to as quinonamine, in hemisynthetic synthesis.<br>
More generally, the invention relates to a hemisynthetic process for the formation of intermediates, derivatives and related structures of ecteinascidin or other tetrahydroisoquinolinephenol compounds starting from natural bis(tetrahydroisoquinoline) alkaloids.   Suitable starting materials for the hemi-synthetic process include the classes of<br>
saframycin and safracin antibiotics available from different culture broths, and also the classes of reineramicin and xestomycin compounds available from marine sponges.<br>

R15 and R18 are independently chosen from -H or -OH. or R5 and R8 are both keto and the<br>
ring A is a p-benzoquinone ring; and<br>
R21 is -OH or -CM.<br>
A more general formula for these class of compounds is provided below:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein the substituent groups defined by R1,R2,R3,R4,R5,R6,R7,E8,R9,R10 RIO are each<br>
independently selected from the group consisting of H, OH, OCH3, CN, =0,<br>
wherein X are the different amide or ester functionalities contained in the mentioned natural<br>
products;<br>
wherein each dotted circle represents one, two or three optional double bonds.<br>
Thus, according to the present invention, we now provide hemisynthetic routes for the production of intermediates including Intermediate 11 and thus for the production of the ecteinascidin compounds as well as phthalascidin and additional compounds.  The hemisynthetic routes of the invention each comprise a number of transformation steps to arrive at the desired product.  Each step in itself is a process in accordance with this invention.  The invention is not limited to the routes that are exemplified, and alternative routes may be provided by, for example, changing the order of the transformation steps, as appropriate.<br>
In particular, this invention involves the provision of a 21-cyano starting material of general formula (XVI):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where R1. R5, R8. R14a, Rl4b R15 and R18 are as defined.<br>
Other compounds of formula (XVI) with different substituents at the 21-position may also represent possible starting materials.  In general, any derivative capable of production by nucleophilic displacement of the 21-hydroxy group of compounds of formula (XV) wherein R21 is a hydroxy group cis a candidate.  Examples of suitable 21-substituents include but are not limited to: a mercapto group;<br>
an alkylthio group (the alkyl group having from I to 6 carbon atoms); an arylthio group (the aryl group having from 6 to 10 carbon atoms and being unsubstituted<br>
or substituted by from 1 to 5 substituents selected from, for example, alkyl group having<br>
from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, alkoxy groups having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, halogen atoms,<br>
mercapto groups and nitro groups);<br>
an amino group;<br>
a mono-or dialkylamino (the or each alkyl group having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms):<br>
a mono-or diarylamino group (the or each aryl group being as defined above in relation to<br>
arylthio groups);<br>
an a-carbonylalkyl group of formula -C(Ra)(Rb)-C(=O)Rc, where<br>
Ra and Rb are selected from hydrogen atoms, alkyl groups having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms.<br>
aryl groups (as defined above in relation to arylthio groups) and aralkyl groups (in which an<br>
alkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms is substituted by an aryl group a defined above<br>
in relation to arylthio groups), with the proviso that one of Ra and Rb is a hydrogen atom;<br>
Rc is selected from a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, aryl<br>
groups (as defined above in relation to arylthio groups), an aralkyl group (in which an alkyl<br>
group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms is substituted by an aryl group a defined above in<br>
relation to arylthio groups), an alkoxy group having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, an amino<br>
group or a mono- or dialkylamino group as defined above.<br>
Thus, in a more general aspect, the present invention relates to processes where the first step is to form a 21 -deriviative using a nucleophilic reagent.   We refer to such compounds as 21-Nuc compounds.<br>
The presence of the 21-cyano group is required for some of the end-products, notably ecteinascidin 770 and phthalascidin, while for other end-products it acts as a protecting group which can readily be converted to another substituent, such as the 21-hydroxy group of ecteinascidin 743 or of 21 -hydroxyphthalascidin.   The adoption of the 21 -cyano compound as the starting material effectively stabilises the molecule during the ensuing synthetic steps, until it is optionally removed.  Other 21-Nuc compounds can offer this and other advantages.<br>
In one important aspect, the present invention consists in the use of a 21-cyano compound of the general formula (XVT) in the preparation of a bis- or tris-<br>
(tetrahydroisoquinolinephenol) compounds.   Products which may be prepared include intermediates such as Intermediate 11, and the ecteinascidins and phthalascidin, as well as new and known compounds of related structure.<br>
Preferred starting materials include those compounds of formula (XV) or (XVI) where R14a and R14b are both hydrogen.   Preferred starting materials also include compounds of formula (XV) or (XVI) where R15 is hydrogen.   Furthermore, the preferred starting materials include compounds of formula (XV) or (XVI) where ring £ is a phenolic ring. Preferred starting materials further include compounds of formula (XV) or (XVI) where at least one, better at least two or three of R5. R8, R15 and R18 is not hydrogen.<br>
Examples of suitable starting materials for this invention include saframycin A, saframycin B, saframycin C, saframycin G, saframycin H, saframycin S, saframycin ¥3, saframycin Yd1, saframycin Ad1, saframycin Yd1, saframycin AHj, saframycin AH2Ac, saframycin AH], saframycin AHjAc, saframycin ARs. renieramycin A, renieramycin B, renieramycin C, renieramycin D. renieramycin E, renieramycin F, xestomycin, saframycin D, saframycin F, saframycin Mx-1, saframycin Mx-2, safracin A, safracin B and saframycin R. Preferred starting materials have a cyano group in position 21, for the group R21.<br>
In a particularly preferred aspect, the invention involves a hemisynthetic process wherein the transformation steps are applied to safracin B:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Safracin B presents a ring system closely related to the ecteinascidins.  This<br>
compound has the same pentacycle structure and the same substitution pattern in the right-hand aromatic ring, ring E.  Also, safracin B presents very close similarities to some of the synthetic intermediates in the total synthesis of ET-743, particularly to the intermediate 11. Such intermediate can be transformed into Et-743 using a well established method. Synthetic conversion of safracin B into intermediate 11 will therefore provide an hemi-synthetic method to obtain ET-743.<br>
Thus, we provide Intermediate 11 made from this compound safracin B. and compounds derived from Intermediate 11, particularly ecteinascidin compounds.   We further provide phthalascidin made from safracin B.  The invention also relates to use of safracin B in the production of Intermediate 11, phthalascidin, ecteinascidin compounds and the other intermediates of the invention.  The invention also relates to compounds described herein derived from the other suggested starting materials, and use of those compounds in the production of such compounds.<br>
The more preferred starting materials of this invention have a 21 -cyano group. The currently most preferred compound of the present invention is the compound of Formula 2. This compound is obtained directly from safracin B and is considered a key intermediate in the hemisynthetic process.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
In a related aspect, we provide cyanosafracin B by fermentation of a safracin B-producing strain ofPseudomonasfluorescens, and working up the cultured broth using cyanide ion.  The preferred strain of Pseudomonas fluorescent is strain A2-2, PERM BP-14, which is employed in the procedure of EP 055,299.  A suitable source of cyanide ion is potassium cyanide.  In a typical work-up, the broth is filtered and excess cyanide ion is<br>
added.   After an appropriate interval of agitation, such as 1 hour, the pH is rendered alkaline, say pH 9.5, and an organic extraction gives a crude extract which can be further purified to give the cyanosafracin B.<br>
Safracin B includes an alanyl sidechain.   In one aspect of the invention, we have found that protection of the free amino group with a Boc group can give strong advantages.<br>
In general, the conversion of the 21-cyano starting compound to an ecteinascidin analog of this invention can be carried out in accordance with our copending PCT patent application, attorney reference wpp83894, which also claims priority from the PCT filing published as WO 0069862 published 23 November 2000, and which relates to hemisynthetic methods and new compounds.   We incorporate the text of the copending PCT application, attorney reference wpp83894, by reference to the extent that there is disclosure therein which is not in the present specification.<br>
Typically the hemisynthesis of an analog of this invention involves:<br>
a)	conversion if necessary of a quinone system for the ring E into the phenol system<br>
b)	conversion if necessary of a quinone system for the ring A into the phenol system;<br>
c)	conversion of the phenol system for the ring A into the methylenedioxyphenol ring;<br>
and<br>
d)	derivatisation as appropriate, such as acylation.<br>
Step (a), conversion if necessary of a quinone system for the ring £ into the phenol system, can be effected by conventional reduction procedures.   A suitable reagent system is hydrogen with a palladium-carbon catalyst, though other reducing systems can be employed.<br>
Step (b), conversion if necessary of a quinone system for the ring A into the phenol system is analogous to step (a), and more detail is not needed.<br>
Step (c), conversion of the phenol system for the ring ,4 into the<br>
methylenedioxyphenol ring, can be effected in several ways, possibly along with step (b). For example, a quinone ring A car* be demethylated in the methoxy substituent at the 7-<br>
position and reduced to a dihydroquinone and trapped with a suitable electrophilic reagent such as CH2Br2, BrCH2Cl, or a similar divalent reagent directly yielding the rnethylenedioxy ring system, or with a divalent reagent such as thiocarbonyldiimidazol which yields a substituted rnethylenedioxy ring system which can be converted to the desired ring.<br>
Derivatisation in step (d) can include acylation, for instance with a group Ra-C0- as well as conversion of the 12-NCHs group to 12-NH or U-NC^CHa. Such conversion can be effected before or after the other steps, using available methods.<br>
By way of illustration, it is now feasible to transform cyanosafracin B in a shorter and more straightforward way to make new analogs.   Cyanosafracin B can be transformed into Intermediate 25;<br>
 (Formula Removed)<br><br>
and from this derivative it is possible to introduce further analogs of this invention.<br>
One method of this invention transforms cyanosafracin B into intermediate 25 through a sequence of reactions that involves essentially (1) removal of methoxy group placed in ring A, (2) reduction of ring A and formation of methylene-dioxy group in one pot, (3) hydrolysis of amide function placed over carbon 1, (4) transformation of the resulting amine group into hydroxyl group.<br>

(Scheme Removed)<br>
The route described above to transform Intermediate 25 can be conveniently modified to form other derivatives.<br>
In more detail, the conversion of the starting 21-cyano compound to a related product of this invention, such as one of formula (XX). usually involves the following steps:<br>
a)	conversion if necessary of a quinone system for the ring E into the phenol system<br>
b)	formation of the -Rs group at the 5-position in ring A;<br>
c)	formation of the R1 group at the 1 -position in ring B; and<br>
d)	conversion if necessary of a quinone system for the ring A into the phenol system;<br>
e)	conversion of the phenol system for the ring A into the methylenedioxyphenol ring.<br>
These steps have many similarities with the steps given previously.   Step (c) typically involves forming a group -CH2NH2 at the 1 -position and acylating it.<br>
Phthlascidin can be made using Intermediates described in the conversion of cyanosafracin B into Intermediate 25.   For example, Intermediates 21 and 17 are suitable starting materials to make Phthlascidin and other analogs of this invention.<br>
As shown in scheme V, the process for the synthetic formation of phthlascidin starting from Intermediate 21 comprises the sequential steps of:<br>
transforming of 21 into the compound of Formula 27 by reaction with phthalic anhydride in dichloromethane and carbonyldiimidazole.<br>
converting of 27 into phthlascidin by reacting with triburyltin hydride and dichloro palladium-bis(triphenylphosphine) or basic media, followed by reaction with acetyl chloride.<br>
Scheme IV<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
As shown in scheme VI, the process for the synthetic formation of phthlascidin starting from Intermediate 17 comprises the sequential steps of:<br>
acerylation of the hydroxyl group of compound of formula 17 with acetyl chloride and pyridine to give the acetylated intermediate compound of formula 42;<br>
removal of the /erf-butoxycarbonyl and the methyloxymethyl protecting groups of 42 to afford the compound of Formula 43 by reacting with a solution of HC1 in dioxane. Also this reaction is achieved by mixing 42 with a solution of trifluoroacetic acid in dichloromethane;<br>
formation of the thiourea compound of Formula 44 by reacting 43 with phenylisothiocyanate;<br>
converting compound of Formula 44 into the amine compound of Formula 45 by reacting with a solution of hydrogen chloride in dioxane;<br>
transforming of 45 into phthlascidin by reaction with phthalic anhydride in dichloromethane and carbonyldiimidazole.<br>
Other analogs can be made for example from 43 or 45 by a similar manner.<br>
Scheme VI<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
The conversion of the 21-cyano compound to Intermediate 11 or a related intermediate of formula (XXI) usually involves the following steps:<br>
a)	conversion if necessary of a quinone system for the ring E into the phenol system<br>
b)	formation of the -OProt1 group at the 18-position, in ring £;<br>
c)	formation of the -CHa-OProt2 group at the 1 -position, in ring B; and<br>
d)	conversion if necessary of a quinone system for the ring A into the phenol system;<br>
e)	conversion of the phenol system for the ring A into the methylenedioxyphenol ring.<br>
Step (b), formation of the -OProt1 group at the 18-position in ring £, is a typicat protection reaction for a phenol group, and no special comments need to be made. Appropriate conditions are chosen depending on the nature of the protecting group.  The other steps are similar to the other reactions.<br>
Step (b), formation of the -CH2-OProt2 group at the 1-position in ring B, is normally<br>
carried out by forming a group -CH2NH2 at the 1 -position and then converting the amine function to a hydroxy function and protecting.  Thus, where the starting material has a group R1 which is -CH2-NH-CO-CR25aR:sbR25c then it is matter of removing the N-acyl group. Where the starting material has a group R1 which is -CH2-O-CO-R then no change may be needed for an ecteinascidin product where the substituent R1 is the same.   For other products, it is matter of removing the 0-acyl group.   Various procedures are available for such de-acylations.  In one variation, the deacylation and conversion to a hydroxy function are performed in one step.  Thereafter, the hydroxy group can be acylated or otherwise converted to give the appropriate R1 group.<br>

DMAP followed by hydrazine; such primary amine can be converted into the corresponding hydroxyl group (compound of Formula 11) by an oxidative conversion of the primary amine into the corresponding aldehyde with 4-formyl-l-methylpyridinium benzenesulphonate or other pyridinium ion, followed by DBU or other base treatment and further hydrolization, and followed by the reduction of the aldehyde to the corresponding hydroxyl group with lithium aluminium hydride or other reducing agent;<br>
forming the protected compound of Formula 26 by reacting with t-butyldiphenylsilyl chloride and dimethylaminopyridine in dichloromethane;<br>
transforming the silylated compound of Formula 26 into the intermediate 11 by deprotection of the OCH2R protecting group, by reacting under reductive conditions or acid conditions. Typical procedures are with palladium black under hydrogen atmosphere, or aqueous TFA, or tributyltin hydride and dichlorobis (triphenylphosphine palladium).<br>
