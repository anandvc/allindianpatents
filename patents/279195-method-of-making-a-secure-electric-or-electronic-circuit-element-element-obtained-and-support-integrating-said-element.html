				<td>Method of making a secure electric or electronic<br>
circuit element, element obtained and support<br>
integrating said element.<br>
The present invention relates to a method for<br>
making a secure electric or electronic circuit element<br>
with the aid of an authentication means associated with<br>
the circuit element. The invention also relates to the<br>
circuit element achieved and the secure support<br>
integrating such element.<br>
It more particularly concerns a method for<br>
securing a support having an electromagnetic<br>
communication interface and the support thus made<br>
secure.<br>
The invention has an application more<br>
particularly in the field of persons or objects<br>
identification supports of the contactless type, such<br>
as an identification card, a passport, a driving<br>
license, an health card, a certificate of car<br>
ownership, a certificate of authenticity, an electronic<br>
label, etc.<br>
 <br>
Such supports already comprise security elements<br>
directly associated with the support and represented as<br>
wires twisted with one or several color wires so as to<br>
reproduce a colored pattern which can be recognized by<br>
an authority or an entity wishing to check the<br>
authenticity of the support.<br>
In a passport, it is known to attach the sheets<br>
composing the page at the level of the page fold with<br>
one or several security wires of the above-mentioned<br>
type, having such authentication signs or marks and<br>
sewn with another wire for maintaining the sheets.<br>
This security wire is visible on the fold when opening<br>
the passport in the middle thereof. In some cases,<br>
such wires comprise radiation sensitive substances more<br>
particularly ultra-violet (UV) sensitive and/or<br>
fluorescent substances. In one country, a fluorescent<br>
blue and white code composes the security wire used in<br>
the fold of the passport.<br>
All the identification documents are in principle<br>
provided with means for meeting problems of forgery,<br>
however the inventors found out that there is no<br>
economical protection against the fraud of the<br>
technology realizing the passport electromagnetic<br>
communication function.<br>
As a matter of fact and more particularly in an<br>
electronic passport including an electromagnetic<br>
antenna connected to an electronic chip to form a radio<br>
frequency transponder, it is possible to substitute or<br>
to clone the chip and/or the antenna simply by<br>
delaminating or ungluing the transponder which is<br>
generally positioned on a support currently called an<br>
electromagnetic insert or inlay.<br>
 <br>
This physical substitution fraud or cloning<br>
operation can concern any support of the contactless<br>
type with a transponder (with a chip) or a theft<br>
security support (without chip) as well as any<br>
electronic label, or electronic module. The fraud may<br>
concern the substitution of a conductive element, an<br>
electric and/or electronic component.<br>
As regards the electronic components, it is known<br>
to integrate identification digital codes in memories<br>
such as cryptographic certificates, but these are not<br>
visible at first glance.<br>
The general aim of the invention is to provide<br>
the security of an electric and/or electronic circuit<br>
element which can easily be detected and implemented.<br>
Another object of the invention is also to<br>
provide the protection against the fraud of means<br>
participating in an electronic communication function<br>
including means sensitive to the reception and/or able<br>
to emit electromagnetic waves with the aid of an<br>
antenna.<br>
More particularly, one object of the invention is<br>
to provide a security solution with contactless<br>
inserts, also called inlays, intended to be used for<br>
contactless products such as electronic passports, some<br>
of which are more particularly compatible with the ISO<br>
14443 standard.<br>
For this purpose, the invention, in its design,<br>
consists in associating or attaching with the circuit<br>
element a security wire including an authentication<br>
means. A wire close to this security wire is used in<br>
the field of secure printing or for example in passport<br>
bindings;  it must however be adapted to the circuit<br>
 <br>
element to be protected and to the utilization<br>
conditions of this element.<br>
More precisely, the invention consists in<br>
interlacing or associating one or several security or<br>
safety wires with the conductive wire of the antenna.<br>
Security is achieved by using sensitive elements<br>
introduced for example by doping security wires, using<br>
UV, IR or fluorescent materials or using tracers and<br>
preferably but not necessarily using, for the detection<br>
thereof, wavelengths in the region which is not visible<br>
with the naked eye.<br>
For this purpose, the first object of the<br>
invention is a method for making a secure electric or<br>
electronic circuit element in which security is<br>
achieved with an authentication means associated with<br>
the element. The method can be distinguished in that<br>
it comprises a step of associating a security wire<br>
directly with the circuit element, the security wire<br>
including the authentication means.<br>
Contrary to the prior art in which the security<br>
wire is associated with a non electrically functional<br>
support, the invention directly associates this<br>
security wire with an electric conductive element.<br>
This association with a non conductive wire is not<br>
naturally obvious, since a priori it does not<br>
participate in the improvement of the electric and/or<br>
electronic function proper and thus it is not desired<br>
firstly. It does not ensure either a direct mechanical<br>
behavior function as in the connection of a passport<br>
sheets.<br>
In most cases of the invention, the association<br>
is direct because of a contact between the security<br>
 <br>
wire and the circuit element. In the best of cases, a<br>
melting or an assembling which is hardly dismountable<br>
is preferred.<br>
According to other characteristics of the method:<br>
-	the step of association is carried out on a<br>
conductive wire as the circuit element, by forming a<br>
hybrid  wire  including  the  security  wire  and  the<br>
conductive wire;<br>
-	the hybrid wire is achieved by downtwisting at<br>
least one security wire with at least one conductive<br>
wire;<br>
-	the hybrid wire is achieved by downtwisting at<br>
least one conductive wire about at least one core wire<br>
so that the conductive wire is helically wind about the<br>
core wire;<br>
the step of association is carried out by<br>
sewing or embroidering the circuit element on a support<br>
using a security wire participating in the sewing or<br>
the embroidery;<br>
-	the circuit element is an antenna and the step<br>
of association is carried out upon the realization of<br>
the antenna wire as a hybrid wire,  said hybrid wire<br>
including at least one security wire and one conductive<br>
wire.<br>
-	the circuit element includes or is connected to<br>
contact pads  or studs,  and in that the end of the<br>
security wire is attached or blocked by welding on the<br>
connection pad or stud.<br>
Another object of the invention is also a method<br>
for making a secure support, said support comprising at<br>
least one circuit element and a security wire<br>
associated with the support.<br>
 <br>
The method can be distinguished in that the<br>
securing of the support is carried out through a secure<br>
circuit element associated with the support, said<br>
secure circuit complying with the method according to<br>
one of the preceding claims.<br>
The method is particularly advantageous when<br>
making an antenna in that, when the same antenna is<br>
made on a support, security is achieved. The turns of<br>
the antenna are formed more particularly by sewing or<br>
embroidering an already secure conductive wire or a<br>
security wire used for example as a sewing or<br>
embroidery thread.<br>
When the already secure antenna has to attach or<br>
fix in addition a component such as a chip module,<br>
security is extended to the module and the secure<br>
antenna is used as an element for securing the module<br>
since the secure sewing thread is attached to the<br>
module.<br>
Another object of the invention is an electric or<br>
electronic circuit element made secure using an<br>
authentication means associated to the element. The<br>
circuit element is distinguished in that it includes a<br>
security wire attached to the circuit element, the<br>
security wire including said authentication means.<br>
According to other characteristics or embodiment:<br>
the  circuit  element  includes  a hybrid wire<br>
including the security wire and the conductive wire;<br>
-	the hybrid wire includes at least one security<br>
wire downtwisted with at least one conductive wire;<br>
-	the hybrid wire includes the conductive wire<br>
helically wound about at least one core wire;<br>
 <br>
-	the circuit element is fixed to a support using<br>
a sewing or embroidery technique with the aid of a<br>
security  wire  participating  in  the  sewing  or  the<br>
embroidery;<br>
the circuit element is selected among a<br>
conductive wire, an antenna, a connection pad or stud<br>
of an electronic component;<br>
-	the antenna is formed using a hybrid wire, said<br>
hybrid wire including at least one security wire and a<br>
conductive wire.<br>
Another object of the invention is a secure<br>
support, said support including at least one circuit<br>
element and one security wire including an<br>
authentication means.<br>
The support is characterised in that the circuit<br>
element is complying with the above characteristics.<br>
According to other characteristics or embodiment<br>
of the secure support including the hybrid wire<br>
antenna:<br>
-	at least one end of the antenna is fixed to at<br>
least one  connection pad or  stud of an electronic<br>
component,  so that the end of the security wire is<br>
fixed to the connection pad;<br>
-	the end on the security wire is locked or fixed<br>
by a welding on the connection pad or stud;<br>
-	the secure support including an electric or<br>
electronic circuit element constitutes the whole or a<br>
part of an contactless insert or inlay; it can be the<br>
whole or a part of an identification support such as a<br>
passport or an identification card.<br>
Other characteristics and advantages of the<br>
invention  will  appear  upon  reading  the  detailed<br>
 <br>

Fig.  8 illustrates a step of laminating an<br>

Fig.  9 illustrates a passport including the<br>
insert of Figure 8.<br>
In Fig. 1, a secure electric circuit element 1<br>
according to the embodiment of the invention is<br>
illustrated and it is exposed to the radiation of a UV<br>
lamp.<br>
In the example, this circuit element 1 first<br>
includes a basic conductive wire 7 more particularly<br>
made of copper or gold, which can be used as an<br>
electric connection element, a resistance, an antenna,<br>
etc. It also includes, according to the invention, a<br>
security wire 3 attached to the circuit element 7; the<br>
security wire includes an authentication means 5 as<br>
explained hereinunder.<br>
In the description, security wire means any wire<br>
used more particularly for securing the identification<br>
support such as a passport, a bank note. The security<br>
wire has the shape of a lengthy element extending on a<br>
given  length  with  a  generally  substantially  round<br>
 <br>
section but it can also have a deformable section more<br>
particularly when it is composed of fibers, or a<br>
rectangular section like that of a ribbon. The<br>
thread/wire can be made of various materials more<br>
particularly natural materials such as cotton or<br>
synthetic material more particularly polymer such as<br>
polyamide. The security wire 7 includes authentication<br>
means. In the example, the authentication means are<br>
sensitive elements or particles 5. They can also be<br>
doping agents comprising UV, IR sensitive or<br>
fluorescent materials or tracers. These authentication<br>
means emit a radiation 6, preferably under the effect<br>
of wavelengths belonging to the invisible region such<br>
as ultra-violet (UV) in order to increase the<br>
difficulty to fraud.<br>
In an alternative solution, the thread can also<br>
include a succession of colored threads which are wound<br>
together or not and which are presented in a determined<br>
order, so as to produce a visible color code which can<br>
be recognized with the naked eye.<br>
According to the preferred embodiment, the secure<br>
circuit element includes a hybrid wire including at<br>
least two wires, the security wire and the conductive<br>
wire. In the example of Fig. 1, the hybrid wire<br>
includes three threads/wires respectively a security<br>
wire 3 downtwisted with at least a conductive wire 7<br>
about a core wire, more particularly a polyamide thread<br>
9. The security wire is attached to the conductive<br>
wire through a downtwisting operation.<br>
Preferably, the conductive wire 7 is wound<br>
helically about at least one core wire 9 having more<br>
particularly rigidity characteristics and the capacity<br>
 <br>
to be fixed or attached in supports for example by a<br>
sewing method.<br>
The core can also be formed by the security wire<br>
which is then enclosed in the conductive wire. In an<br>
alternative, the conductive wire can also be used as<br>
the core and the security wire is then wound about it.<br>
The dimensions of the conductive wire are so as<br>
to meet the required characteristics for a radio<br>
frequency (RF) communication and the security wire is<br>
marked so as to be a security element. The security<br>
wire can be a structural wire or not in so far as it<br>
directly participates or not to the holding of the<br>
conductive wire on a support.<br>
In the case where the hybrid wire participates in<br>
a technology of the antenna sewn on a woven or non<br>
woven support, the weight of the security wire is<br>
preferably between 15% and 40% of the total weight of<br>
the hybrid wire and the total weight of the hybrid wire<br>
can vary from 400 to 600 dtex, 1 dtex being equal to<br>
lg/10,000m.<br>
The hybrid wire may include for example two<br>
security wires for a total together of about 80 to 160<br>
dtex, plus the copper wire.<br>
In a passport for example, the security wire<br>
alone is approximately equal to 3 times the weight in<br>
dtex of both security wires together contained in the<br>
hybrid wire.<br>
The above values of the hybrid wire results from<br>
a compromise optimizing the sewing or embroidering<br>
speed without breaking the thread, the radio frequency<br>
RF performances and/or the constraints imposed by the<br>
contactless transponder standard ISO 14443.<br>
 <br>
This security wire can be associated or added to<br>
a security wire by another means than downtwisting.<br>
The wire can be attached or assembled in any other way<br>
for example by a braid using at least three<br>
threads/wires. The threads/wires can also be parallel<br>
rather than in the form of spirals and/or assembled by<br>
a thermal gluing material or wire. Then, for example<br>
the conductive wire can be sheathed with an isolating<br>
material which can adhere directly to the security wire<br>
or through an adhesive agent. The adhesive agent can<br>
be more particularly introduced as a wire associated<br>
with other threads/wires.<br>
The security wire can advantageously be metallic<br>
and have one or several strands made of various metals<br>
(gold, silver, platinum, copper, aluminum). Thus, the<br>
welding can be carried out so as to best attach the end<br>
thereof to a circuit element.<br>
Under the effect of the UV lamp, the sensitive<br>
particles 5 of the security wire are activated and emit<br>
a visible radiation 6.<br>
In Fig. 2, the secure circuit element 1 similar<br>
to that in Fig. 1 is attached on the support 11 with<br>
the aid of a sewing technique using a thread 1<br>
participating in the sewing. The secure conductive<br>
wire made of copper 7 used as a sewing or embroidering<br>
thread is held with a bobbin thread 13.<br>
Other similar or equivalent techniques using<br>
attachment thread such as embroidery, knitting also<br>
make it possible to attach the circuit element. Thus,<br>
for example the bobbin thread 13 may become the<br>
embroidery thread.<br>
 <br>
Alternatively, the bobbin thread 13 can be<br>
exchanged with the secure conductive wire 1 for the<br>
embroidery or the sewing. At least one of the threads<br>
participating in the sewing or the embroidering or the<br>
knitting may be the security wire, whereas the other<br>
one can be or include the conductive wire. As a matter<br>
of fact, any combination of such wires is possible.<br>
To reinforce the security, the bobbin thread 13<br>
can also be a security wire with or without a<br>
conductive wire. Thus, it adds additional marking<br>
means to the already secure conductive wire 1.<br>
As an alternative, the circuit element 1 may not<br>
include a security wire but include a conductive wire<br>
alone or associated with a wire such as a core wire,<br>
with the security wire being brought through a<br>
subsequent assembling more particularly by sewing,<br>
embroidering or any other assembly means such as<br>
gluing, etc.<br>
This alternative solution makes it possible to<br>
uncouple the linear conductor 7 manufacturing technique<br>
from that of the security wire. Thus, for example, a<br>
metallized track is achieved by electrochemical etching<br>
on a support as a circuit element, whereas the<br>
attachment technique for the security wire is for<br>
example embroidery.<br>
The security wire can be attached or added using<br>
any thread/wire attachment technique on a support such<br>
as sewing, embroidery, ultrasound etching etc. The<br>
securing technique can also be chosen according to the<br>
desired advantages. For example, an implementation is<br>
easy with sewing or embroidery and gains in<br>
productivity can be achieved.<br>
 <br>
The circuit element 1 can also be embedded in the<br>
support more particularly of a plastic type with<br>
ultrasounds which thus makes the separation of the<br>
security wire from the conductive wire even more<br>
delicate. The separation can also be prohibited by<br>
means of a plastic coating, for example a transparent<br>
one around the circuit element, or even a melting of<br>
the wires together.<br>
The circuit element according to the invention<br>
may also be selected more particularly among an antenna<br>
or a connection pad or stud of an electronic component<br>
as described herein under.<br>
In the case of an antenna, the latter may be<br>
formed from the hybrid wire as previously described.<br>
Alternatively, the antenna can also be made in a<br>
known way by means of an ultrasound embedding<br>
technique. Preferably, the security wire is embedded<br>
with the security wire. The security wire may<br>
subsequently be added if need be, when the antenna is<br>
formed on a support. More particularly, the antenna<br>
can also be achieved by a metallization by etching or a<br>
deposition of a conductive material such as a<br>
serigraphy with a conductive ink.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates a secure support 15<br>
according to one embodiment of the invention. This<br>
support includes at least one circuit element and the<br>
security wire including authentication means. The<br>
circuit element is an antenna 17 which can be achieved<br>
from a conductive or a hybrid wire as previously<br>
described.<br>
In the example, the antenna is a hybrid wire and<br>
is fixed on a support using an embroidery technique.<br>
 <br>
Other attachment techniques mentioned hereabove may<br>
also be appropriate. At least one end 19 of the<br>
antenna is attached to at least one connection pad or<br>
stud 21 of an electronic component 23, so that the end<br>
of the security wire is locked or attached to the<br>
connection pad or stud.<br>
The electronic component is shown by a chip 25<br>
module 23 of the contactless type. It includes a chip<br>
on a support 27 carrying metallized contact studs 29.<br>
The chip pads 31 are connected to the contact studs by<br>
any known means such as a wire welding, a conductive<br>
material or a flip chip or chip technique (Fig. 7) etc.<br>
Figures 4 to 7 illustrate various ways to attach<br>
or fix the security wire to contact studs (or even<br>
pads) of an electronic component or connected thereto.<br>
Figure 4 is similar to Figure 3 in that the<br>
attachment is carried out by directly sewing the<br>
metallic studs 21, with the security wire going through<br>
alone or preferably with the conductive wire a<br>
connection stud 21. A coating 35 can protect the<br>
connections either of the chip alone or also of the end<br>
19 of the antenna.<br>
It can be noted that the invention makes it<br>
possible not only to secure the antenna itself when it<br>
is associated with the security wire, but also that the<br>
thus secured antenna also makes it possible to secure<br>
the electronic component which it is attached to and<br>
thus the support by being attached thereto as, for<br>
example, when it is sandwiched between two<br>
polycarbonate sheets welded together or a sewing with<br>
another security attachment wire to the support.<br>
 <br>
In Figure 5, the end 19 of the secure conductor<br>
is attached to connection studs 31 by a thermo-<br>
compression welding 33 (or any other connection means)<br>
carried out on the connection studs. A coating resin<br>
can cover the non conductive and conductive ends and<br>
thus lock the security wire. This embodiment or<br>
implementation is particularly advantageous to obtain<br>
secure interconnections of components on a support such<br>
as a contact stud module, a battery, a display system,<br>
etc. The hybrid wire can fix the support at least at<br>
some places and include sewing or embroidering or<br>
gluing points or any equivalent point.<br>
In Figure 6, two connection surfaces are<br>
connected by means of a secure conductive wire<br>
according to the invention. The welding is a thermo<br>
compressed welding. If need be, the hybrid wire 1 can<br>
be attached at some places of the isolating support 27,<br>
more particularly by sewing or embroidering.<br>
In Figure 7, the chip is mounted as a flip chip<br>
against connection studs. The ends 19 are attached by<br>
means of anisotropic conductive glue which locks the<br>
chip support and ends 19 of the hybrid wire together.<br>
Alternatively, each pad may receive a drop of isotropic<br>
conductive glue.<br>
The welding 33 on the embodiment in Figure 6 can<br>
be carried out using various techniques with or without<br>
an addition of material more particularly an addition<br>
of a conductive glue 35 for example an isotropic glue.<br>
In Figure 8, the support achieved 15 may be the<br>
whole or a part of an insert or an inlay 37 of the<br>
contactless type.  For this purpose, the insert 15 can<br>
 <br>
receive one or several protective additional laminated<br>
sheets or a cover 37, 39.<br>
In Figure 9, the support 15 may be the whole or a<br>
part of an identification support such as an electronic<br>
passport 43. The insert can be added to a cover 45 or<br>
preferably a passport sheet, the support or at least a<br>
coating covering it is transparent, so as to show the<br>
security wire. Transparency can be localized on at<br>
least a part of the antenna to allow a visual<br>
examination.<br>
In the case where the sheet is opaque, other<br>
sensitive agents can be used so as to be detected<br>
through the opaque sheet, such as magnetic, metallic<br>
agents which can be detected by a capacitive effect.<br>
The lamination method for an inlay, a card or a<br>
document makes it possible to enclose the antenna<br>
between the lower and higher layers and this method can<br>
be forged or duplicated in case the inlay is replaced.<br>
Using transparent layers during the lamination<br>
step will make it possible to see the antenna with the<br>
naked eye and to authentify it with a detection tool.<br>
