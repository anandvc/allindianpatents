				<td>HOLDER FOR  A WDRKPIECE  OR  TOOL   HAVINS   A TAPERED   COLLAR<br>
The invention relates to an apparatus for holding a workpiece or tool having a hollow tapered  collar  or the like,   the apparatus  having a pull-back rod  axially shift able in  a  body for actuating a chuck head cooperating with  jaws.<br>
The actuation  of   such  an  apparatus  is  carried  out   by axially moving the pull-back rod,   it   being tensioned for  holding and compressed for releasing the holding of the workpiece or tool and shifting again into the releasing position.      In  order to hold the axial  position a£  the pull-back rod in the holding position,   it is  common  according to prior  art  to prestress  it   by means   of   a tension   spring,   usually using a stack of   spring washers   or bolt disk  springs  that  press  the pull-back rod  into the holding position with great force and hold it  in place  even if  tension is  no longer applied to the pill-back rod.      However,   one disadvantage is that the balance of  the rotating spindle of the machine tool   supporting the apparatus  is  adversely affected  by the stack o£   spring washers.<br>
The invention is therefore based on the object    providing an  apparatus  of  the above-mentioned type in  such  a   manners that the abidance can  be improved.<br>
This   object  is  attained according to the invention in  an apparatus   of   the above mentioned type in  that  the axial  position  of the pull-back  rod  is   mEd.ntained  in the holding position  in  a  self-locking   manner  without  utilizing the force of   a tension   spring.<br>
Such  an  apparatus  provides  the advantage that   after the force has   been  applied,   the tension can  be released  and the stored<br><br>
force will   be stored  by the self--locking action in the pull-back rod without   requiring a tension  spring*      The balance of  the rotating spindle of  the machine tool  is   significantly improved  and higher  rotational   speeds  can  be achieved.      Furthermore,   this creates  the advantage that   essentially is  simplified  because the required components  can  be simply inserted into the body axially from the front  without   being obstructed  by the tension  spring*<br>
It  is   especially preferred within the scope of  the invention,   if   a holding  sleeve is  axially fixed  on the body and axially guides  a gripper whose inner face bears  on the pull-back rod,   and the pull-back rod has  a tapered head,   the gripper has   a wedge ring,   and the holding sleeve has  a tapered inner  surface The tapered heel,   the wedge ring,   and the tapered inner  surface, created the required high holding force by moue’s  of   axial   relative displacement   of  the components  involved to  maintain the required security to safely clanp the workpiece or the tool   at  high  rotation speeds.<br>
It  is  further  advantageous when the tapered head is stepped in toward the pull-back rod  at  a  shoulder,   the gripper has elm inner ridge for   engaging the shoulder,   mad the gripper can spread  and   move past the shoulder with its  inner  ridge in the axial region of  the tapered inner  surface of the holding sleeve      This configuration initially ensures  that  the axial displacement   of  the pull-back rod into the holding position is transmitted via the gripper  as   a large axial  displacement   of  the chuck head to press the jaws  against  the tapered collar  and produce the clasping effect   and   movement   of  the pill-back rod  along the wedge ring<br><br>
spreads  the grlpper  outward  and   engages  it  with the tapered  head. Although  axial  displacement  of  the grlpper is  reduced in this manner  with  a given  axial   stroke of  the pull-back  rod,    self-locking action  occurs,   however,   with Increasing force,   in that  the wedge ring is  literally wedged  between  the tapered  head  and the tapered inner  surface of  the holding sleeve      This position  of  the grlpper Is   maintained   even if   axial  tension  on the pull-back rod is released  so that the pull-back rod can rotate out   of   contact  with the spindle of  the machine tool   and any actuating  system<br>
It   is  further provided  within the scope of  the invention that the grlpper Is  coupled to the chuck head for  axial displacement thereof   via a threaded bolt,   as well   as  via a threaded ring.      In principle,   the possibility exists to allow the grlpper to directly act  upon the chuck head,   such       enibodiroent providing advantages with the use of  the threaded  bolt   and the threaded ring with regard to the  manufacture,   installation,   and c ool ant  throughput.<br>
In  order to avoid any rotation  of  the grlpper  relative to the chuck head’   which could lead to a lateral  off-center position of  the grlpper  resulting in the creation  of  an undefined holding force,   the grlpper is  guided in  a longitudinal   slot   of  the holding sleeve<br>
It  has proven  advantageous within the scope of  the<br>
invention,   if  the tapered  head  has   an  apex angle of   4E  to  8E,<br>
particularly of  6E,   since this  angle advantageously meets  the requirements  for  a  sufficient   axial  displacement   of   the grlpper during displacement   of  the pull-back rod when the grlpper  is<br><br>
pressed  against  the tapered inner  surface of  the holding  <br>
This  is facilitated;   if the tapered inner  surface of  the holding sleeve has  an  apex angle of   9E to 15E particularly of   12E, whereby in this  case the inner  surface of  the wedge ring purposefully has  an  angle corresponding to the apex angle of  the tapered head,   and the outer  surface of  the wedge ring has   an  angle corresponding to the apex angle of  the holding sleeve for   ensuring a large  engagement   surface<br>
Furthermore;   it  is  advantageous  if  the tapered  head  has an   engagement   surface that  comes   bears  on the threaded ring,   if  the inner  ridge of  the gripper   engages the shoulder  of  the tapered head.      This  configuration   ensures that the gripper is   moved  jointly with the pull-back rod without   any clearance from the releasing position into the holding position,   i. a    the gripper   engages the shoulder of  the pull-back rod flush with its  inner  ridge<br>
In the following the invention is   explained in  greater detail  with  reference to an   embodiment   shown in the drawing;   the sole FIG.    1   shows   a longitudinal   section through the apparatus according to the invention.<br>
The drawing  shows   an  apparatus   serving to hold  a workpiece 2   or a tool  having a frustoconically tapered collar 1,   to which   end the apparatus  has   a pull-back rod  4 that  is  axially   e in    body 3   and that  serves  for  actuating a chuck head 6   cooperating with  jaws  5,   namely by axial displacement   of  the pull-back rod  4   between  a releasing position  shown  in the drawing in the bottom half   and  a holding position  shown in the upper half<br><br>
of  the drawing.      For holding the workpiece 2  the pull-back rod  4  is pulled from the greasing position  back into the holding position by means  of   actuator not   shown in the drawing’   so that  the chuck head 6   is   axially displaced via a tong-like gripper 7,   a threaded bolt  8,    and  a threaded ring 9,   thus   radially outwardly displacing the outer   jaw   ends  10   of  the jaws  5   into   engagement  with  the tapered collar 1.<br>
It  is  important  in the apparatus   shown in the drawing that   a holding  sleeve 11   is   axially fixed  in the body 1   and  axially guides the gripper 7  that   bears with its  inner faces   on the pull-back rod  4 that  has  a tapered head 12,   the gripper 7  having a radially spread able wedge ring 13  and the holding  sleeve 11  having a frustoconical   inner  surface 14 that   on   movement   of  the pull-back rod  4 from the releasing position into the holding position creates a  self-locking action that   maintains the axial  position  of  the gripper  7   without   even having to   maintain  tension  on  the pull-back rod  4 with the actuator.      The force applied to the pull-back rod   4 by the actuator is therefore in   effect   stored  by means   o£  this self-locking  roechanisnv    and the safe holding of  the workpiece 2   at its tapered collar 1  is   ensured without  having to   exploit a tension spring that  has  to  maintain the axial  position  of  the pull-back rod 4 in the holding position with its tension  against  the body 3   or the holding sleeve 11*      Such  safe holding is therefore not compromised  by any fatigue on the part  o£  the tension  spring. Furthermore;   with the use of  the self-locking  mechanism provided  by the invention the pull-back rod  4  is  not   engaged by a tension spring  and  can  rotate with the spindle or  the body 3  without  having<br><br>
to be connected to its  actuator  so that  balance is  improved  and rotational   speed can be increased.<br>
The drawing further  shows  that  the tapered  head  12   is stepped  radially in  at   a shoulder 15  toward the pull-back  rod  4, the gripper 7  has  an inner ridge 16   for   engageznent  with the shoulder 15,   and the gripper 7   nay spread and pass  the shoulder 15 with the inner ridge 16   in the region  of  the tapered inner  surface 14  of  the holding sleeve 11.      In the embodiment   shown in the drawing the tapered head 12  has   an  apex audible of  6E,   while the tapered inner  surface 14  of  the holding sleeve 11   has  an  apex angle of  12E.      The angle of  the inner  surface’   as well   as that   of  the outer  surface of the wedge ring 13  correspond to the angle of  the respective confronting surfaces.<br>
The operation  of  the apparatus  is  briefly   below.      Based  on the releasing position  shown  in the bottom had-f, tension is  applied to the pill-back rod  4  by the unillustrat ed actuator,   by means  of  which the rod  4 is pulled back to the left  in the drawing.      This   covenant  causes the pull-back rod  4 to  engage the inner  ridges  16   of  the gripper  7   on the coiler  of  the pull-back bolt   4 first to  entrain the gripper 7  that,   in  order to avoid an unbalance are guided in two slots  17   of  the tightening  sleeve, and thus  via the threaded  bolt  8   and the threaded  ring 9   entrains the head 6   so that the outer   ends  10   of  the jaws  5  pivot   outward and   engage a  shoulder 18   of  the tapered collar 1.      The  engagement of  the shoulder  15  with the inner  ridge 16   effects   a rapid  axial movement  of  the chuck head 6   and  after  moving through a predetermined  short   axial   stroke the inner ridge 16   of  the gripper<br><br>
7   spreads   and   moves  axially past  the shoulder  15  while riding  on the inner  surface cC  the wedge ring 13  c’  the tapered head  and simultaneously the outer  surface of  the wedge ring presses  against the tightening sleeve 11.      With continued  axial   movement   of  the pull-back rod  4.    the gripper 7  is therefore entrained through  a very short  axial   stroke and then is wedged  between the tapered head 12   and the holding sleeve 11  with increased force’   until  the mechanism self-locks,   thereby providing the desired tension   even if the actuator is disconnected from the pull-back rod  4,<br>
If  the holding is  to be released,   the pull-back  rod   4  is pushed left  to right from the holding position into the releasing position,   thus  releasing the gripper 7  wedged between the tapered head 12   and the holding sleeve 11,   and the pull-back rod   4  also novas   relative to the gripper  7   until  it   engages  the threaded  ring 9 with its   end 19,   and the inner  ridge 16   can  again   engage behind the shoulder 15   of the pull-back rod  4,      Continued   movement   of  the pull-back rod  4 pushes the chuck head 6   so that  the jaws  5   release the workpiece 2  with their outer  jaw  ends  10.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
