(a)	Name : CTR Manufacturing Industries Ltd.<br>
(b)	Nationality :    Indian Company<br>
(c)	Address :  El, Chikalthana,<br>
AURANGAHAD-431210,  MAHARASHTRA,   INDIA<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing a plastic film capacitor and a plastic film capacitor manufactured thereof More particularly it relates to a method of Swaggjng done after welding/soldering of leads by spreading solder using a soldering iron on the welded ends of a wound capacitor coil, to increase the contact area, thereby reducing the band width of Tan delta exhibited and improving the electrical characteristics of aplastic film capacitor and eliminating lead breaking problem.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART DESCRIPTION<br>
Manufacture of the presently available plastic film capacitors involves the steps of: a  Winding of the capacitor coil;<br>
b.	End spray metallisation;<br>
c.	Welding of terminals on to the end sprayed (metallised) wond capacitor coil;<br>
d.  Encapulatin of the coil;<br>
e.	Sealing ofthe coil with welded/soldered leads by ©poxy<br>
It is observed in such a plastic film capacitor that after short period of use, the welded lead/terminal contacts get weakened and due to which the capacitor does not exhibit desired perameters. Generally following problems are observed in such capacitors:<br>
1.   Loose contact/weakened welded leads<br>
1   Arcing occurs at the loose contact/weakened lead wires<br>
3.	Possibibilityofcapacitorexhibiting open circuit<br>
4.	Poor electrical characteristics<br>
5.	Reduced current carrying capacity<br>
6.	 Wide tan delta bandwidth resulting in overheating Shortened life<br>
2<br><br>
It is observed that plastic film capacitior fails during operation due to above mentioned drawbacks.  In manufacturing of Plastic film capacitors after winding and  end spray metallisation, termination/leads are welded by current welding method or soldered After welding the coils are encapaulated and sealed with epoxy. It is observed that lead breaking in the main problem of welded capacitor coils and tan delta band width of such capacitor is very high and the electrical characteristics and Insulation Resistance are poor. Also cracking noise is heard during High Voltage testing.  It is therefore necessary to obviate the above mentioned drawbacks of the prior art capacitor and to improve accordingly.  All the above prior art systems discuss regarding welding/soldering on capacitor coil and are not disclosing disadvantages such as arcing at high voltage, loose contact, slowly becoming open circuit, less current carrying capacity and wide tan delta band width leading to overheating in a plastic film capacitor.  Hence it if necessary to provide a plastic film capacitor that will obviate all the problems as discussed<br>
above.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIBTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The above, and other object features and advantages of the invention will become  apparent from following description read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. <br>
Meaning of the reference numerals used in the drawings are as follows:<br>
l.-Wound capacitor coil<br>
2.- Electrodes<br>
3." Dielectric film<br>
4.- End spray metalisaition	<br>
S.-Leadwires<br>
6\- Welding contact<br>
7.- Solder material  <br>
8. Solder material spreaded area.<br>
According to present inventions, plastic film capacitors are manufactured by winding into a cylindrical<br>
shape any plastic dielectric film metallised on one side/both sides forming the electrode. Fig 1 shows n<br>
wounded capacitor coil( 1 ). Fig2 shows the cross sectional area of a wound capacitor coil( 1). As<br>
shown in figuere2 elctrodes( 2) are placed between dieelectric films (3) After winding, capacitor coils<br>
( 1) are kept in air ventilated oven for heat treatment up to 5 hrs. at upto 110°C and then end spray<br>
(metallisation)(4) is done for termination contact. Fig 3 shows a capacitor coil with end spray<br>
metallisation. Then the lead wires/termination ( 5) is welded to the ends of the sprayed coil for making<br>
termination contact Figure 4 shows the wound capacitor coil with end spray metallisation and<br>
termination welded. Basically the termination wires (5) and weldmg contacts ( 6 ) are shown in figure<br>
4. After this solder material (7) is spread by means of a soldering iron manually on welded leads (5) of<br>
the capacitor coil(l) to get large lead contact area. The soldering material (7) may be with flux or<br>
withoutflux.                                                                   6<br><br>
TH  the spreading step involves using a hot soldering iron  the capacity of which is dependent on the amount of solder to be melted to adequately cover the entire coil and face and spread easily.  This process is called swaging Such a capacitor coil is shown in figure 5. Then this capacitor coil is encapsulated and sealed.<br>
All these above mentioned steps are shown in flow chart form in figure 6. Example:<br>
Following examples will show how a plastic film caacitors manufactured by method of present invention is superior in respect of the tan delta bandwidth property compared to capacitors available in the prior art. These examples must be taken only for an explanation purpose and it does not to be taken as a restriction to the present invention. The examples have been illustrated by means of the Gaussian curves showing tan delta bandwidth for both prior art plastic film capacitors and plastic film capacitors according to present invention. Examples 1;<br>
- Example 1 is illustrated by means of figure 7a. Now referring to figure 7a shows the Gaussian curves showing tan delta bend width for prior art plastic film capacitors. On X-axis tan delta values is taken and on Y-axis number of capacitors is taken. For plotting this graph first the plurality of prior ait capacitors are taken. Then tan delta values are recorded for each capacitor at 1 KHz frequency using HelwetPackard LCR bridge or tan delta meter. Here tan delta means power loss angle. From these values the curve showing in figure 7a is drawn. As shown in figure 7a the tan delta bandwidth for the prior art capacitors obtained is in the range from 60xl04 to 95xl04.<br>
7<br><br>
Example 2:<br>
Now referring to figure 7b shows the Gaussian curve showing tan delta bandwidth for the plastic film capacitor manufactured by the method of the present invention. For plotting this curve same procedure is adopted which has been adopted in respect of the carve of the tan delta bandwidth of the prior ait capacitors. As shown in figure 7b the tan delta bandwidth for the capacitor obtained is ranges from 30x1-4* to 60x10-4. After going through example 1 and example 2 indicating the values of tan delta band width is respect of prior art capacitors and capacitors of the present mvention respectively that the value of tan delta bandwidth obtained in respect of the plastic fihn capacitors of the present invention is much lesser than the values obtained in respect of the prior art capacitors.<br>
These examples show how a plastic fihn capacitor manufactured by the method of the present invention are superior in respect of the tan delta bandwidth property than the capacitors available in prior art. ADVANTAGES OF THE INVENTION<br>
