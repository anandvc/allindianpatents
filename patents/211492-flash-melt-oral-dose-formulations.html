"FLASH-MELT ORAL DOSE FORMULATIONS"<br><br><br><br>
BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY, a Corporation of Delaware, P.O. Box 4000, Princeton, New Jersey 08543-4000, United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
FLASH-MELT ORAL DOSAGE FORMULATION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a formulation for solid pharmaceutical oral dosage forms that disperses in the mouth in under about 25 seconds.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
There are a number of varieties of solid pharmaceutical dosage forms that rapidly dissolve or disintegrate in a glass of water, in the mouth, or in the gastrointestinal tract. Such dosage forms have been known in the art for many years. The obvious advantages of the convenience of carrying dosage forms that will dissolve or effervesce in water to release medicaments are well known. Likewise, the therapeutic need of having an oral dosage form that will rapidly dissolve or disintegrate in the mouth for situations where immediate medication is necessary and water is not available has long been recognized.<br>
Initially, a distinction must be drawn between flash-melt dosage forms and rapidly disintegrating dosage forms. The former are intended to dissolve or disintegrate in the mouth of the patient in less than one minute whereas the latter are intended for primary dissolution or disintegration within 3 to 20 minutes in the acidic medium of the stomach or a container of water. The recognized test for rapidly disintegrating dosage forms is disintegration time in 0.1 N hydrochloric acid. Those of<br>
2<br><br>
ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the requirements for formulating dosage forms to meet these criteria must necessarily be different since the conditions, particularly pH, in the mouth and the stomach are quite different. More important, the time in which a dosage form must dissolve or disintegrate in the mouth is necessarily much shorter than in the stomach with the obvious exception of dosage forms, e.g. lozenges, that are specifically formulated to slowly dissolve in the mouth.<br>
Another consideration common to most if not all dosage form formulations intended for flash-melt or rapid disintegration is the need to take precautions in the preparation, packaging, handling and storing of the finished dosage forms since they tend to be both hygroscopic and friable. Dosage forms dependent on effervescence to promote their disintegration are particularly susceptible to moisture and must be packaged with special wrapping, stoppers, packets of drying agent and the like.<br>
Regardless of such potential problems, there is still an acute need for dosage forms that can rapidly dissolve or disintegrate for the obvious benefits of having a therapeutic dosage of the medicament contained therein available for absorption in a very short time. In addition to the benefits of rapid availability, flash-melt dosage forms are advantageous for administration of medicaments to patients such as the very young, the elderly, the non-compliant and those with a physical impairment that makes it difficult if not impossible to swallow an intact dosage form. Flash-melt dosage forms are further a convenience for situations where potable water may not be readily available or desirable. Medicaments amendable to such dosage forms would include sedatives, hypnotics, antipsychotics, motion sickness medication, mild stimulants such as caffeine and the like.<br>
Those of ordinary skill in the art are aware that there are two basic compounding concepts recognized for the preparation of rapidly<br>
3<br><br>
dissolving/disintegrating dosage forms. The first of these, particularly suited for the preparation of flash-melt dosage forms, is freeze drying wherein a cake or wafer is prepared from a freeze-dried solution or suspension of medicament and suitable excipients in water or other solvents. Such wafers dissolve very rapidly on the tongue, i.e. within about ten seconds, due to a combination of a high affinity for moisture resulting from the freeze drying process and a very high porosity, which promotes rapid ingress of saliva. While such dosage forms are capable of rapid disintegration/dissolution in the mouth, the freeze drying process suffers from several disadvantages, primary among which is the fact that a solution or a stable suspension of the medicament must be formed before it can be freeze dried. While not always the case, typically such solutions are aqueous and, therefore, not suited to formulating medicaments sensitive to water. The process itself is typically laborious and time-consuming. Finally, the resultant dosage forms, in addition to being hygroscopic, tend to be very soft and, therefore, require special moisture-and impact-resistant packaging and require careful handling prior to administration.<br>
The second major technology utilized in the manufacture of rapidly disintegrating dosage forms is based on special grades of sugars such as mannitol, sorbitol and the like in combination with superdisintegrants. The latter are excipients that are characterized by a special wicking capacity to channel water into the interior of the dosage form, or by rapid swelling in water, both of which act to hasten disintegration. It is also known to enhance dissolution of dosage forms by the inclusion of effervescent combinations, typically sodium bicarbonate and a weak acid, such as citric acid. As noted above, effervescent formulations require special moisture resistant packaging as even very small levels of moisture may be sufficient to initiate the effervescent reaction. Techniques, such as fluidized bed granulation, are recognized as being useful in the preparation of such formulations. Too often, however, such technologies<br>
4<br><br>
require a specific, very costly plant including special handling equipment, controlled-humidity environments and the like. In spite of such measures, dosage forms produced by such techniques typically require moisture resistant packaging, the need to include in the packaging packets or capsules of moisture absorbing agents and the like.<br>
An example of a teaching of the incorporation of super disintegrants in dosage form formulations to enhance dissolution is WO 98/030640, FMC Corporation. It is disclosed therein that, for cost considerations, up to 90% of a group of super disintegrants including cross-linked cellulose, cross-linked carboxymethyl cellulose, cross-linked starch, croscarmellose alkali metal salt, crospovidone, alkali metal starch glycolate and the like can be replaced by a co-disintegrant. included among the latter group are natural diatomaceous silica, a synthetic hydrous alkaline earth metal calcium silicate and a porous hydrophilic zeolite. The weight ratio of super disintegrant to co-disintegrant is stated as from 4:1 to 1:10, preferably 2-1:1. There is no indication of any recognition of benefits to be derived from the formulation other than the obvious consideration of cost savings since the co-disintegrants are less expensive and the combination is stated to accomplish the desired results.<br>
In contrast, Japanese patent 10114655, Kyowa Hakko Kogyo KK discloses a formulation intended for rapid dissolution in the stomach that can contain up to 30% by weight of a superdisintegrant, such as crospovidone or hydroxypropylcellulose, croscarmellose and the like and up to 30 % of a neutral or basic ingredient including magnesium aluminum metasilicate, calcium silicate, a phosphoric acid salt or a metal hydroxide. The dosage form is intended for medicaments that produce a gel at acidic pH.<br>
5<br><br>
There are numerous other examples of specific formulations that utilize one or more of the techniques or mechanisms discussed above. For the most part, however, they also possess one or more of the enumerated disadvantages to some degree, e.g. it is difficult or expensive to produce dosage forms by such techniques, the resulting dosage forms are friable or are sensitive to environmental factors such as moisture. There continues to be the need for a formulation that mitigates or eliminates these disadvantages, yet yields a flash-melt dosage form that will disintegrate in the mouth within about 25 seconds. Such formulations are provided in accordance with the present invention.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
A formulation is disclosed which is suitable for the preparation of granules without solvents that can be compressed on conventional equipment into pharmaceutical oral dosage forms, e.g. tablets, caplets, wafers and the like, that will disintegrate in the mouth in under about 25 seconds. The formulation is comprised of a suitable medicament and a four component excipient combination consisting of a superdisintegrant, a dispersing agent, a distributing agent, and binder that also functions as a wicking agent to promote ingress of fluids into the dosage form and may also include other conventional ingredients such as sweetening and flavoring agents. The preparation of the formulation of the invention is unique in that the combination of four excipients can be dry granulated with the medicament and suitable conventional ingredients, such as flavoring and sweetening agents, without the use of any solvent, to form stable granules that can be readily compressed into dosage forms on conventional equipment without the need for special handling techniques. In a particular embodiment, granules are formed containing the medicament and other ingredients and a majority of the excipient combination. The granules are then blended with the remaining<br>
6<br><br>
ingredients to form a final blend suitable for direct compression into dosage forms on conventional equipment.<br>
A three component excipient combination comprising of a superdisintegrant, a dispersing agent and a binder is provided as another object of the invention. This dosage form may be a tablet in which, the superdisintegrant is selected from the group consisting of crospovidone, croscarmellose sodium, sodium starch glycolate, low-substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose and pregelatinized starch, said dispersing agent is selected from the group consisting of ortho-, meta- and alpha triclinic-calcium silicate, ortho- and meta-magnesium trisilicate and silicic acid, and said binder is selected from the group consisting of microcrystalline cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, lactose, mannitol and calcium phosphate.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The formulation of the present invention and the process of preparing flash-melt dosage forms therefrom are based on a combination of four excipients. This unique combination of excipients may be formulated with other conventional adjuncts, particularly flavoring agents, sweetening agents, lubricants and the like and one or more active medicaments as will be discussed below. The active medicament may comprise up to about 30% by weight, preferably up to about 15% by weight, of the formulation, depending on the amount required for a therapeutically effective dosage and factors such as its capacity to be directly granulated, the amount of flavoring/sweetening agents required to mask the taste or bitterness thereof and the like. It is within the scope of the present invention to utilize medicaments that are coated for taste or other reason in the subject formulations provided that the coatings do not interfere with either the compounding or the disintegration of the tablets.<br>
7<br><br>
The excipient combination comprises, in total, up to about 85% by weight, preferably from about 50% to about 80% by weight, of the formulation.<br>
The excipient component of the formulations of the present invention is a combination of a superdisintegrant, a dispersing agent, a distributing agent, and a binder. Suitable superdisintegrants include crospovidone, croscarmellose sodium, sodium starch glycolate, low-substituted hydroxypropylcellulose, pregelatinized starch and the like. The preferred superdisintegrant for the subject formulations is crospovidone since it can be utilized in large amounts without causing a formulation containing it to have a propensity to gel.<br>
Suitable dispersing agents, also sometimes referred to in the art as anticaking agents, include calcium silicate-ortho, meta and alpha triclinic forms thereof, magnesium trisilicate-ortho and meta forms thereof and silicic acid. Calcium silicate is the preferred dispersing agent. Particularly preferred is a crystalline alpha triclinic calcium silicate, commercially available from Aldrich Chemical Company which meets the following specifications: 1.3 m2/gm surface area; 0.63 g/cc bulk density; 2.90 g/cc true density; and

Alpha triclinic calcium silicate is advantageously combined in the subject formulations with at least one other pharmaceutical grade of calcium silicate wherein the alpha triclinic form would comprise from about 10% to about 90% by weight of the combination. In contrast to its use in conventional tabletting formulations, it is considered unexpected that the dispersing agent, i.e. calcium silicate, is the primary constituent of the excipient combination of the subject formulations since it is generally recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art as being poorly compressible.<br>
Examples of suitable distributing agents for the excipient combination of the subject formulations include amorphous silica, fumed silica, diatomaceous earth, talc, kaolin, magnesium aluminum trisilicate and the like, with amorphous silica being especially preferred.<br>
9<br><br>
The final component of the excipient combination of the formulations of the invention is a binder. Suitable binders are those that also function as a wicking or distributing agent in that they act to promote water intake into dosage forms made therefrom. Suitable binders include carbohydrates such as, microcrystalline cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, starch, lactose, and also, mannitol and calcium phosphate. Microcrystalline cellulose is the preferred binder. Microcrystalline cellulose is commercially available as Avicel ® PH (pharmaceutical grade) from FMC Corporation, Philadelphia, Pa., particularly Avicel® PH 101, PH 102, PH 103, PH 112, PH 200, PH 301, PH 302 and Ceolus. Microcrystalline cellulose is also available from Mendell, Penwest Company, Patterson, N.Y., as Emcocel ® 90M and Emcocel ® 50M, which could be used satisfactorily. Particularly preferred in the present formulations is Avicel® PH 102 or a combination of Avicel® PH 102 and Avicel® PH 200 as will be described below.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the excipient combination of the present formulations comprises crospovidone as the superdisintegrant, calcium silicate as the dispersing agent, amorphous silica as the distributing agent and microcrystalline cellulose as the binder. The range of the members of the excipient combination of the subject formulations is from about 4 to about 8, preferably from about 5 to about 7, percent by weight of the superdisintegrant; from about 20 to about 70, preferably from about 35 to about 45, percent by weight of the dispersing agent; from about 1 to about 10, preferably from about 1.5 to about 3, percent by weight of the distributing agent; and from about 10 to about 50, preferably from about 12 to about 20, percent by weight of the binder, all based on the overall weight of the formulation including one or more medicaments. A particularly preferred excipient combination comprises about 7 percent by weight of the superdisintegrant, about 40 percent by weight of the dispersing agent, about 2 percent by weight of the<br>
10<br><br>
distributing agent and about 15 percent by weight of the binder, based on the total weight of the formulation including medicament(s).<br>
The formulations of the present invention may contain other conventional ingredients found in similar preparations known in the art and recognized as approved for use in preparations to be taken into the body. These would include, for example, natural and artificial flavors, polyols such as mannitol, sorbitol, maltitol and xylitol, artificial sweetening agents such as, N-a-L-Aspartyl-L-phenylalanine 1- methyl ester (aspartame) and 6-methyl-3,4-dihydro-1,2,3-oxathiazin-4(3H)-one-2,2-dioxide, particularly the potassium salt thereof (acesulfame K), flavor adjuncts such as tartaric acid, tabletting lubricants, such as magnesium stearate, and the like. Those skilled in the art of pharmaceutical compounding will appreciate that the amount of flavoring and sweetening agents, if any, present in the formulations of the present invention will be directly proportional to the taste or bitterness of the medicament. The flavoring and sweetening agents do not serve to coat the medicament, but are adequate to mask the objectionable taste of the medicaments in homogeneous admixture therewith. In general, the total of such conventional ingredients will not exceed about 32 percent, preferably from about 25 to about 30 percent by weight based on the total weight of the formulation.<br>
The medicament in the formulations of the present invention typically will not exceed about 30 percent by weight, preferably from about 1 to about 15 percent by weight of the formulation. Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the physical characteristics of the medicament itself, i.e. its particle size and morphology, will directly influence its limiting content in the subject formulations. Clearly, there has to be sufficient medicament in the dosage form produced form the subject formulations to provide a therapeutically effective dosage. While solid dosage forms can be prepared from the formulations of the present<br>
11<br><br>
invention by any recognized technique, including wet granulation, it is a particular advantage that the formulations can be dry granulated without the use of specialized equipment and conditions, thereby making them suitable for the formulation of medicaments that are sensitive to moisture and high temperatures.<br>
Examples of medicaments that can be formulated into flash-melt tablets in accordance with the present invention include, without intended limitation, antihistamines, anti-motion sickness agents, analgesics, anti¬inflammatory agents, antibiotics, cholesterol lowering agents, anti-anxiety agents, anti-hypertensives, anti-cancer agents, hypnotics, anti-ulcer agents, coronary dilators, antivirals, anti-psychotics, anti-depressants, neuromuscular agents, anti-diarrheals, hypoglycemic agents, thyroid suppressors, anabolic agents, antisposmodics, antimigraine agents, diuretics, stimulants, decongestants, uterine relaxants, antiarrhythmics, male erectile dysfunction compounds, Maxi-K channel openers or neuroprotective agents for the treatment of stroke or Alzheimer"s disease and therapeutically appropriate combinations thereof. Specific therapeutic agents falling into the foregoing categories include, again without intended limitation, aripiprazole, ibuprofen, aspirin, acetaminophen, chlorpheniramine maleate, psuedoephedrine, diphenhydramine HCI, ranitidine, phenylpropanolamine, cimetidine, loperamide, meclizine, caffeine, entecavir, cefprozil, melatonergic agonists, pravastatin, captopril, fosinopril, irbesartan, omapatrilat, gatifloxacin and desquinolone and therapeutically appropriate combinations thereof.<br>
As stated above, a decided advantage of the formulation of the present invention is that it can be dry-granulated into stable, fine granules that can be directly compressed into pharmaceuticaily elegant flash-melt oral dosage forms, e.g. tablets, caplets, wafers and the like. Preferably, the granules for flash-melt dosage forms in accordance with the present invention are formed in two steps. The process comprises initially forming<br>
12<br><br>
granules, referred to herein as the intragranulation, by blending all of the medicament, the dispersing agent, distributing agent, other conventional ingredients as described above and a portion of each of the superdisintegrant, binder and tabletting lubricant together in a suitable mixer to assure uniform distribution throughout. A conventional V-blender is a preferred apparatus for this step. While a minor portion of the dispersing agent may be omitted from the intragranulation, it is preferred that all be incorporated therein. The blended mixture is then compacted in a conventional roller compactor having an orifice such that the compacts thereof are in the form of ribbons. Alternately, a slugging process can be used. The compacts from the roller compactor or the slugs from the slugger are passed through a fine screen, e.g. a 30 mesh (600 microns) screen, thereby breaking them into granules between about 150 and 400 microns in size. The intragranulation granules thus-prepared are thereafter blended in a suitable mixer with the remaining ingredients, i.e., superdisintegrant, binder and lubricant, referred to herein as the extragranulation ingredients, to form a final blend that can be directly compressed into pharmaceutical dosage forms utilizing conventional equipment such as a tablet press. Rather than directly compress the final blend upon formation, since it is stable, it can be stored and subsequently pressed into dosage forms at a later time. It is a decided advantage of the subject invention that these operations are carried out without the need to resort to special handling such as taking precautions against any moisture coming in contact with the ingredients or the granules, and without the use of specially controlled temperature and humidity conditions.<br>
The intragranulation comprises from about 80 to 99, preferably from about 85 to 95, most preferably about 90, percent by weight of the final blend. Based on the weight of the final blend, the intragranulation preferably comprises up to about 30 percent by weight, preferably from about 6 to 20 percent by weight, of the binder, up to about 5 percent by weight, preferably from about 2 to 4 percent by weight, of the<br>
13<br><br>
superdisintegrant, and all of the dispersing agent and the distributing agent. The binder and superdisintegrant are divided between the intragranulation and the extragranulation ingredients in weight ratios of approximately 2:1 to 4:1 for the binder and 0.5:2.0 to 2.0:0.5 for the superdisintegrant. The conventional tabletting lubricant is divided approximately equally between the intragranulation and the extragranulation ingredients.<br>
The final blend is formed by mixing the intragranulation and the extragranulation components of the excipient combination, adding the remaining tabletting lubricant thereto and blending until uniform. Alternatively, a direct compression approach can be utilized in which all of the ingredients with the exception of the tabletting lubricant are mixed in a suitable blender, such as a conventional V-blender, by geometrically building the entire mass of the formulation via sequential blending for three minutes after each addition, and finally adding the lubricant to the mixture after all other ingredients have been blended.<br>
Tablets compressed on a conventional tablet press from the final blend obtained from either a one-step granulation or a direct compression blend, were pharmaceutically elegant and disintegrated in water within ten seconds. A tablet is considered as disintegrated when it has totally broken down to granules and there are no discernible lumps remaining. Since the medicament is not intimately bound to any of the ingredients of the formulation, it is released within the same time period. The most outstanding advantage of the subject formulations is that dosage forms can be manufactured therefrom which are robust and, hence, avoid the need for specialized unit dose packaging and careful handling during manufacture or use as is often the case with present dosage forms. The dosage forms prepared from the formulations of the present invention can be packaged in conventional blister packs or in HDPE bottles.<br>

Tablets compressed therefrom had a breaking force of 2.3 kP (3.5 SCU) and disintegrated in 10 seconds in 5 ml of water. The final blend formulation demonstrated excellent flow and was free of other problems such as chipping, capping and sticking. It has been found that utilizing Avicel® PH 102 for the intragranulation and Avicel® PH 200 for the extragranulation ingredient enhanced the quality of the resultant tablets.<br>
