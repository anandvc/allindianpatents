ARTICLE OF FOOTWEAR<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is concerned with an article of footwear, and in particular an article of footwear In which the climate therein can be more effectively controlled. The present invention is also concerned with components which may be used for constructing such a footwear article.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
During liie course of a day, a foot, trapped within the confines of a conventional article of footwear, has a tendency to become hot and sweaty. This can cause a number of issues inciudingb poor foot odour and fungal infections such as athlete's foot. In these situations, an article of footwear that is better ventilated can cool and help to remote moisture, thus improving the unhealthy conditions within the footwear.<br>
The prior art contains a number of examples of ventilated footwear both those that employ a selectively permeable membrane and those that are provided with a pump. In both cases, the conventional designs have their drawbacks.<br>
Footwear with selectively permeable membranes are limited in their effectiveness bec^iss the same qualities that make the membrane impervious to v;ater also limit the amount of air that can pass through them. These designs usually include a membrane that is mounted above a perforated outsole and are susceptible to blockage as mud and dirt build up on the bottom surface of the sole.<br><br>
Conventional pump-ventilated footwear is characterized by a pump mounted in a cavity within the sole and comprising a resilient chamber in communication with inlet and outlet chech valves . In particular, the inlet valve controls the supply of ait from outside the footwear while the outlet valve controls flow into one or more ilation passages for distributing the air through the footwear. Due to the wearer's weight, during walking the sole of the footwear tends to be downwardly pressed and this pressure acts to compress the chamber in the sole, forcing air through the outlet valve mto the shoe ca^/ity. When the footwear is raised &amp;om the ground, the chamber is restored by the inherent resilience of the pump such that is will return to its default undeftiimed state, drawing in another charge of air.<br>
US Patent No. 1,660,698 describes a prior art shoe where the pump chamber is formed as a resilient bellows or bladder received in a recess in a conventional relatively rigid heel, adjacent a flexible inner sole. US Patent No. 4,601,441 provides another example of prior art but where the pump chamber is formed as a cavity directly in a resilient sale.<br>
In conventional pump-ventilated footwear, such as the aforementioned examples, the wearer's weight is supported by an air chamber in the sole; and the amount of ventilation is largely dependent on the amount of deformation of the sole during walking. For increased ventilation, the air chamber must be made larger or be made to deflect more, and thus the vertical movement of the foot within the shoe body sole must be increased or the lateral (horizontal) size of the pump increased, or both. All of these factors disadvantageously decrease the stability of the shoe, particularly in the lateral direction. To avoid this lack of stability with this type of footwear article, the amount of deflection and the size of the chamber, and consequently the<br><br>
displacement of the pump, are often relatively small in designs that are commercially available. Figs, la and lb illustrate the operation of a pump mechanism in such a conventional footwear article in that a pump member of the pump mechanism oparates in response to the deformation of the shoe sole. Accordingly, it has been difficult to design inexpensive and reliable footwear of this type that provides good and practical ventilation for wearers with satisfactory stability.<br>
Another drawback assopiated with conventional pump-ventilated footwear articles is that they typically provide ventilation only when the wearer's body weight is forced against the heel; and not during any other part of the walking motion.<br>
A further disadvantage of conventional ventilated footwear is that they may not be sintable for wearing in cold climates. This is because external cold air would be undeEicably drawn ta tiis shoe cavity by the pump or through the selectively permeable membrane.<br>
The present invention seeks to address the aforementioned problems in ventilated footwear. Furthermore, the invention  seeks to take advantage of the air circulation in the footwear by introducing improvements which include means to circulate warm air, a deodorant, antiperspirant and/or fragrance.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to a first a^iect of the present invention, there is provided with an article of footwear comprising a shoe body including a shoe upper and a bendable sole winch together define a first cavity, wherein &amp;e sole is provided with a second cavity therein for housing at least one pxmip operable by means actuable thereon located<br><br>
inside the sole, wherein the mutation means contains at least one portion movable within the second cavity against said pump in response to bending or unbending of the sole.<br>

within said chamber ivhereby on movement of said barrier at least one of the cells expands while at least the other cell collapses, simultaneously drawing in air to the expanding cell from the first cavity and/or from the surroundings of the footwear article and pumping air from the collapsing cell to the first cavity and/or the surroundings of the footwear article.<br>
Preferably, the barrier may be in the form of a piston slidable within the chamber, causing the simultaneously expansion of one of the cells and the collapsing of the other of the cells. Alternatively, the banier may be in the form of a bladder contained in the chamber, and wherein the two cells define one cavity in the chamber but external to the bladder, and another cavity internal to the bladder, respectively.<br>

In particular, the footwear article may . comprise a temperature-regulating or substance dispensing member.<br><br>
Although three aspects of the present invention have been summarised above, the present invention can also be classified based on their charactraistics, to be explained as follows.<br>
The first characteristic "Leveraged displacement of a pump" is designed to address the stability problems found in pump-ventilated footwear in the prior art. This characteristic of the invention introduces the concept of amplifying a tiny displacement of the sole into a much more significantdisplacement of a pump through the use of leverage. Thus even in pump vendlated footwear actuated by weight, it can be envisaged that a small deformation of the support surface can be amplified into a large displacement of a pump thereby reducing the stability issues to a point where they are no longer a problem.<br>
The second characteristic "Pump actuated on bending force" is different from the prior art in that the prior art covers pump-ventilated foottwear actuated by the weight of a wearer against a support surface that deforms. All soles deform to some extent during walking, but the soles of conventional pump-ventilated footwear deform to a far greater extent than regular footwear as this deformation is relied on to actuals the pump,<br>
Thus the motivation for this characteristic of the invention is to introduce features that do not require the sole to deform any more than typical footwear thus preserving the stability of the footwear.<br>
The third characteristic "Dual-action pump" refers to a pump design that aims to maximize the efficiency of pumps of a given size. In a fixed space, there can be envisaged multiple airtight cells, each fitted with intake and outtake check valves. These airtights cells fusiction in complementary phases such that when a first cell, or<br><br>
group of cells, are depressed a second cell, or group of cells, are expanded. Thus because a first cell and a second cell are never fully expanded at the same time, they can occupy the same fixed space without interfering with the function of the other. There are certain  space limitanons, in footwear, if the general appearance of the footwear is to be preserved, so the motivation for this characteristic of the invention is to increase the araoimt of airflow that can be provided by a pump mechanism of a given size.<br>
Implentation of the above mentioned characteristics are described in the following:<br>
Weight Actuated Mechanisms<br>
According to this classincatian of embodiments, there is provided an article of footwear comprising a shoe body including a. shoe upper and a sole, wherein the shoe upper and the sole together define a first cavity, wherein the sole is provided with a second cavity for housing means for pumpting air into and/or out of the first cavity in response to changs of pressure on. the sole, and wherein the pumping means include at.least one pump member, and one pivoting member having a buckling or pivotal region and is buckling or pivotal on an increased pressure on the sole whereby the pump is acted on to pump air into and/or out of the fiarst cavity.<br>
From an alternate perspective, this aspect of the inventjon can be described as follows: there is provided a ventilated footwear article, comprising a sole defining a reference - portion and a moving portion, in which walking causes oscillating movement of the moving portion relative to the reference portion, a displacernent-amplifying mechanism within the sole for amplifying an input displacement to produce an output displacement, the input displacement being provided by the relative<br><br>
movemsni between the moving portion and the reference portion, a pump actuated by; the output displacement to supply an airflow for ventilating the footwear.<br>
The sole between the reference portion and moving portion may be resilient or an air gap and the relative oscillating  movement may be the result of compression of the sole between the wearer's foot and a support surface and expansion of the sole when tiie foot is raised from the support surface. The sole may be integrally formed or formed from one or more parts to provide the resiliency.<br>
According to a first embodiment of the invention the relative oscillatir^ movement may be the result of compression of the sole between a foot of the wearer and a support surface and expansion of the sole when the foot ijs raised away from the support surface and the displacement-amplifying  mechanism may include a spring member having op'posing ends joined by a buckling portion offset from a line joining the ends and presented toward the pump, the ends of the spring member being mounted between the reference portion and the moving portion such that the ends are substantially free to rotate, wbesreby movement of the moving portion with respect to the reference portion produces amplified displacement of the spring member at the budding portion for artuating the pump. Preferably the spring member has a shallow V-^ape biased towards strai^tening, the base of the V-sh^e constituting the buckling portion.<br>
The pump preferably may comprise a bellows or bladder received in a pump cavity in the sole. The bellows preferably may have a generally oblate shape. Optionally the walls may be pleated. Preferably a pair  of spring members may be mounted on either side of the bellows, each with its respective buclkling  portion presented towards opposing sides of the bellows such that the bellows is compressed<br><br>
herebetween . The spring member may comprise a torsion spring having a helical oil portion at the buckling portion. Alternatively, the spring member may comprise a pringboard or another mechanism with a bias for straightening. This example wcompasses designs where the spring members provide a horizontal compression of bladder as well as an angular compression of a bladder as may be the case in a ladies igh heel shoe or boot.<br>
A second embodiment is similar to the first but utilizes a lever as the isplacement-amplifying member in place of a spring  or spring member. In a second mbodiment - and second example of a leveraged, weight actuated mechanism ~ the displacement-amplifying mechanism may include one or more verticaliy arranged ■-vers fixed to the reference portion, the lever having a first part for engaging the ;tuating fece and a second part for engaging the bellows, whereby movement of the lOving portion with respect to the reference portion presses the actuating face to gage the first part and pivot the lever, producing amplified displacement of the-second part for actuating the pump.<br>
In a third embodiment - and third example of a leveraged, weight actuated echanism — there is a lever arranged along the length of an article of footwear, stead of the vertical arrangement as in the second embodiment A tiny movement of e lever close to the fulcrum is amplified to produce a larger angular displacement at . end of the lever in order to cause amplified'displacement of a pump.'<br>
The three embodiments may optionally include a temperature-regulating or bstance dispensing mechanism, wherein the chamber may be in fluid-mmunicable relationship with the first and/or second cavity.<br><br>
In lie first three embodimeats, the pump member may be enclosed in a chamber arranged in the sole. The chamber may serve a number of functions, one of which is to protect the relatively fragile pump member therein; a second which would provide support for the foot. Further, the chamber may be fitted with intake and outtake channels and check valves; and be made otherwise airtight except trough these channels. With this arrangement a "dual-action pump" is created, as air is forced out of the pump member when the pump is depressed simultaneously drawing ail into the chamber, and forces out air from the chamber when the pump returns to its non-depressed state.<br>
Bending .Actnated Mechanisms.<br>
In the fourth and preferred embodiment of the invention, there is provided an article of footwear comprising a shoe body including a shoe upper and a bendable sole which together define a first cavity, wherein said sole is provided with a second cavity for housing means for pumping air into and/or of the first cavity in response to bending or straightening of the sole. This is advantageous because this construction avoids the reliance on the defonnation of a rear end of the sole in response to the -change of pressure during walking in conventional pump-ventilated footwear.<br>
Preferably, the sole may include a front portion, a mid portion and a rear portion, and may be bendable. at or near the mid portion in response to or during walking. During walking, due to the anatomy of a human foot the mid-portion of the footwear article is typically being bended and the provision of a bendable nortion<br><br>
allows the footwear to bend more easily and consistently at a similar cegion. It is to be understood different persons withi a similar size of feet wiring the same footwear<br><br><br>
Suitably, the pump member may be enclosed in a chamber arranged in the sole. The chamber may serve a number of functions, one of which is to protect the relatively fragile pump member therein; a second which would provide support for the foot. Further, the chamber may be fitted with intake and outtake channels and check valves; and be made otherwise airtight except through these channels. With this airangement a "dual action" pump is created, as air is forced out of the pump member when the pump is depressed simultaneously drawing air into die chamber; and forces out air from the chamber when the pump returns to its non-depressed state.<br>
An alternative "dual action" pump could be created with two pump members placed on top of one another, in the second cavity, and divided in fee middle by an actuating member such as a springboard. The top and bottom of the cavity would be formed of relatively rigid walls. For an article of footwear in its default and. straightened form the position of the actuating member would ensure that the top of the two pumps is depressed against the ceiling of the cavity. Upon bending of the footwear, the aotuatii^ member depresses the lower pump and the i^iper pump starts to expand. When the footwear straightens, the upper pump is depressed and the lower pump expands.<br>
Preferably, the actuating means may be of an elongate profile, and may include a Qxtnt segment generally residing in the &amp;ont portion, a rear segment generally residing in the rear portion and a pivotal region, connecting the front segment and the rear segment, wherein the pivotal region may be arranged at or near ihs bendable mid portion. In particular the pivotal region may comprise a spring or springboard. A relatively rigid board may also be used but the use of this may not be ideal as it will restrict the arhount of bending.<br><br>
Suitably; the actuable means may be adapted to assume a first configuration in which  the actuabls means is straightened or generally straight, and/or not acting on a pump member under its rear segment.<br>
Vilien the article of footwear first bends during walking motJon the actuating means is able to stay straight but ^fts positions in the second chamb« depressing the pump member located under its tear segment thus assuming a second configuration. When the angular rotation of the rear segment of the sole relative to the fiont segment becomes so great that the pump is fully depressed, bending the shoe further would cause the actuating. means to bend as well so as to not restrict the walking characteristics of the wearer thus collating a third configuration.<br>
Suitably, the footwear article may further comprise a tube or passageway for connecting the first cavity and the second cavity and a tube or passageway for connecting the second cavity to the external  environment In particvdar, theie may be providing  with a one-vray valve adapted to control the direction of movement of air between the first cavity and the secoad cavity in the tube and another one-way valve in the passagevray to control the movement of air between the second cavity and the external enviromiient.<br>
As an additional feature, the anbodiment mi^t also include a temperature-regulating or substance dispensing mechanism, wherein the chamber may be in fluid-communicable relationship withfhe first and/or second cavity.<br>
In a fifth embodiment - and second incorporating a bending actuating pumping mechanism — there is a pump member enclosed in a chamber beneath the bendable mid portion of an article of footwear.  Beading of the shoe causes "finger-<br><br>
like" members to pivot and engage the pump member, the details of which will be explained in more detail herein.<br>
Bending Actuated Mechanisms with Dual-Action Pump<br>
In embodiments 4 and 5, the pump member may be enclosed in a chamber arranged in the sole. The chamber may serve a number of functions, one of which is to protect the relatively fragile pump member therein; a second which would provide support for the foot. Further, the chamter may be fitted with intake and outteke dianneis and checic valves; and be made otherwise airti^t except throu^ &amp;ese chamiels. With this arrangement a "dual action" pump is created, as air is fiarced out of the pump member when the pump is depressed simultaneously drawing air into the chamber, and forces out air from the chamber when the pump returns to its non-depressed state.<br>
An alternative "dual action" pump could be created with two pump members placed on top of one another, in the second cavity, and divided in the middle by an actuating member such as a springboard. The top and bottom of the cavity would be formed of relatively rigid walls. For an article of footwear in its default and straightened form, the position of the actuating member- would ensure that the top of the two pumps is depressed against the ceiling of the cavity. Upon bending of the footwear, the actuating member depresses the lower pimip and the upper pump starts to expand. When the footwear straightens, the upper pump is d^ressed and the lower pump expands <br><br>
In addition to the defining characteristics of the invention, there remain a number of suppiemetitary features that allow ihe invention to fimctibn more effectively and/or comfortahly than the prior art<br>
In one aspect of the invention there is pump-ventilated footwear comprising a pump for pumping air to an outlet for ventilation of the footwear and a recirculation valve connected to an iatate of ^ pump for controlling tiie ratio of air to be received from an internal tniet wiiiiia the footwear, and flie ratio of air to be received from an external inlet outside the footwear.<br>
Preferably Ihe recirculation valve is a modtdatiug tjfpe including a housing having an aperture with a first inlet port opposite a second inlet port and an outlet portj a valve member sealingly received for linear sliding movement in the aperture, tiie valve member having an iotemal passage for connecting either or both the first and second inlet ports to the outlet port.<br>
Additionally there are a number of different designs for various other components such as a springboard and a pump.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION Characterisitic#1: Amplified displacement of pomp<br><br>
In this characteristic we aim to show how a large volume of air flow can be achieved while preserving the walking stability and comfort of conventional footwear.<br>
In conventional pump-ventilated footwear articles, the opetation of ventilation and in particular the squeezing of the pump member is dependent to a large extent on the deformation of the shoe sole by the foot. A large pump and therefore estensive motion of compisssion would adversely affect the stability of the footwear. Figs, la and lb illustrate such a prior art pump-ventilated footwear sole in its expanded configuratinn and the same shoe sole in its compressed configuration, respectively- In the diagram it shows how the relative distance between the insole and outsole is significantly reduced during compression of fiie pump member (i-e., x = y + Ai) where  is fairly large.<br>
Alternatively Figs. 2a and 2b depict a pumping mechanism in which the relative distance betv/een an insole and outsole remain essentially constant or at least largely so a = b + A2) where A; is fairly small and A2 « Ai for the same amount of pumping. It can be envisaged that because the shoe sole avoids significant defonnation, the stability of the footwear is preserved.<br>
The concept of amplified displacement of a pump relies on a mechanism for translating a small movement, which which applied to an amplification mechanism, is translated into a large movement to more fully actuate or compress a pump. In this manner it is believed that the problem of stability is avoided because the size of deformation of the sole is too small to pose a problem.<br>
Fig, 3 illustrates a leveraged system 300 consisting of a lever 301 and a folcrum -302. In the conftguratio  the lever 301 is divided into two lengths L1 and Lo divided by a pivotmg point 303 at the fulcrum 302. According to the principle of<br><br>
leverage, the ratio betjveen an output displacement Do and an output dispiacement D1 is equal to the ratio between the two corresponcUng length Lo and Li as shown in the<br>
Fig.   5  illustrates two configurations of a spring member 500.     In  the configuration on the right when it is not subject to compression, the spring member<br>
500	is in its default configuration and is generally straight In the configuration of die left, when it is subject to compression the spring membra" 500 pivots at a coil portion<br>
501	in the central region thereof, causing it to buckle. Fig. 6 illustrates two sunilar configurations of an alternative spring member 600. This spring member 600 is however different in that there is no distinct coil portion similar to 'the coil pardon. Yet, the spring member 600 can generally still pivot and buckle at its central region.<br><br>
Characteristic  #2:Pump actuated on bending force<br>
Fig. 7 illustrates the faending of a shoe body during walking motion. In typical walking motion, when a wearer's foot strikes the ground, the wearer's body weight is typically forced against the heel as the wearer's foot decelerates. The lower leg then rotates over the shoe relative to the ground, and the forefoot strikes the ground. At this point, the shoe bends as the heel is lifted from the ground (where it is straightened) in preparation for the next step. In Fig. 7, during the bending and straightening action the angle 8 changes between the front part and back part of the sole. A pump or plurality of such can be actuated by the action driving the change in angle . For the purposes of this spscification, any change in the angle G, between different parts of the sole, is considered to be bending.<br>
In pump ventilated footweart actuated by bending, there is an actuating member fixed on one end but free to move in a cavity located on its other end. A change in the angls G, caused by the bending, bruags a pump member located in, the cavity into a state of eng^ement with the actualing member so that it is depressed. That is to say, dming bending of an article of footwear the &amp;ee end of flie actuating manber changes positions in the cavity and thereby actuate a pump member located at its firee enid.<br>
Figs. Sa, 3b, 8c, and 8d illustrate the concept of a spring member SOO that is fixed in position on the left side but free to move in a cavity 801 on the other end. As the angle 6 increases, caused by the raising of 803, a pump member 802 is compressed further and further by the spring  member SOO until a point where the pump member 802 is fully depressed and the pump member 802 strikes the bottom of<br><br>
the cavit;' 801 arid starts to bend as well. The motion of 803 in the figure is made to resemble the motion of the heel of an article of footwear during bending.<br>
Characteristic #3:Dual-Action Pump<br>
As previously mentioned, a "Dual-action" pump refers to a pump design tiiat aims to maximize the efficiency of pumps of a given size, hi a fixed space, there can be envisaged multiple airtight cells, each having passageways and valves in cominunicatioo "with the first cavity and flie exterior of the footwear.<br>
These airtight cells ftmction in complementary states such that when a first part of cell or cells are depressed a second part of cell or cells, are expanded. Fig. 9a and Fig. 9b illustrate an example of a dual-action pump in which a bladder 902"resides in an airtight chamber 901. In this example, the bladder serves as a first part while the airtight chamber serves as a second part<br>
For the purposes of this specification, a cell can be considered to be an airtight enolosure having passageways and valves in communication with the first cavity and the exterior of the footwear. Therefore being cells, both the chamber and the bladder are fitted with check valves controlling the flow of ah into and out of them. When the bladder or first part is depressed (i.e., pumping air out), it shrinks in size and air is sucked mto the chamber OT second part to fill the void left by it. As pressure is removed fi'om the bladder or first part, the resilience of it causes it to expand against the walls of the chamber or second part pushing air oat of the chamber. Thus air can be pumped into the footwear both when (he first part is depressed and when the first part expand.<br><br>
In a similar example Figs. 10a and 10b depict a pumping mechanism where two pumps (1002a, 1002b) are confined in a relatively tight space and separated by an actuating member 1000. The two pumps represent different cells. Due to the tight confine and the resilience of the actoating member 1000, one pump member remains largely compressed and a second largely expanded in its defeult configuration. In the top figure. Fig- 10a, the top pump 1002b is depressed while the lower pump 1002a is expanded. When the actuating member 1000 presses down on the lower pump 1002a, the top pump 1002b starts to expand. Each of the two pump members (1002a, 1002b) represents a different part.<br>
It should be noted that there can be multiple cells in a part but there must be at l^ist one cell in each of the two parts. Each part expands and contracts in trnison.<br>
In another example, Fig, 11a, lib and lie depict a pumping mechanism that resembles a piston. The pump mechanism comprises a movable barrier 1102 within the pimip member and dividing the cavity llOOa, 1100b into two airtight cells which also represent a first and a second part respectively. Fig. Ua shows the cavity 1100 with the lower cell 1100b fully expanded due to tie position of the movable barrier 1102 at the top of die savity 1100. Fig. lib shows the cavity 1100 with the movable barrier 1102 positioned partway within the cavity 1100. It is to be understood that when the purtip mechanism goes ■ftnou^ the transition from a first configvrration (Fig. Ila) to a second configuration (Fig. lib), air in the lower cell 1100b of Ihe cavity is compressed causing it to be pumped out of the lower cell 1 lOOb of the cavity and into or out of the article of footwear depending on the direction of the valves. Simultaneously to the pumping of air out of the lower cell 1100b of the cavity, air flows into the upper cell 1100a of the cavity. If the position of the barrier 1102 were<br><br>
to move further down (Fig. l1e) it would continue to pump air out of the lower cell (1100b) and the upper cell (llOOa) would continue to fill with air. If the barrier 1102 were to shift up, the reverse would happen with air being pumped out of tbe upper cell (1100a) and air sucked into the lower cell (1100b) of the cavity.<br>
Embodiment 1<br>
Figs. 12a and 12b illustrate a first embodiment of a footwear article 1200 to which a ventilated system is providcid. The footwear article 1200 has a shoe upper 1202 and a sole 1204 which together define a first cavity 1206 for accommodating the foot of a wearer. The sole 1204 comprises an insole 1208, a mid sole 1210 and an outsole 1220, and a pump mechanism resides in the midsole 1210. Alternatively the mid sole 1210 can be formed as part of the outsole 1220.<br>
The pump mechanism includes a pump member 1222 and is provided at the mid sole 1210 between the insole 120S and the outsole 1220. In particular, tiie sole 1204 has a fi-ont portion 1224 and a rear portion 1226. In this embodiment, the midsole 1210 is provided with a second cavity 1228in the form of an air-tight chamber housing the pump member 1222 at the rear portion 1226. The pump member 1222 includes inlel: check valve 1232 and outlet chk valve 1236 while the air-tight chamber 1228 includes inlet check valve 1230 and outlet check valve 1234. The inlet check valves 1230, 1232 are mounted in an inlet passage 1238 terminating in an opening 1240 external to the sole 1204. Outlet passages 1242, 1244 extend longitudinally from the ontlet check valves 1234, 1236 and terminate in outlet opening 1246 in the front portion 1224 of the sole 1204, for ventilating the shoe cavity 1206.<br><br>
Figs. 13a, I3b, 13c and 13d depict the pump mechanism in Embodiment 1. Figure 13a and 13b represent an expanded and compressed version, respectively, of a pimip actuated by a torsion spring with a helical coil. Figure 13c and 13d represent an expandedand compressed version, respectively, of a pump actuated by a resilient springboard. Figs. 13a, 13b, 13c and 13d illustrate a pump cavity 1350inaheel 1252 of the footwear article 1200 bounded by an upper movable portion 1354, a lower reference portion 1356 and opposite sidewalls 1358,1360. The pump cavity 1350 is expanded and contracted vertioally as show in Figs, 13a, 13b, 13c and 13d, the resihence of the heel 1252 being schematically represented by the spring 1362, biasing the pump cavity 1350 to its expanded position. It is understood that this resilience can be achieved in a number of ways, for instance by tiie appropriate selection o£ material (.e.g., spriag, elastomer) for an integrally formed heel 1252 or by joining resilient and relatively rigid parts. The relative movement 1363 between the moving portion 1354 and the reference portion 1356, models compression of the heel 1252 and corresponding compression of the pump cavity 1350 upon heel strike. It is to be imderstood that the terrcs "reference portion" and "moving portion" are used only to differentiate two portions between which there is relative movement and are not restricted to particular portions or speciBc relative movements based upon the context of the described embodiment.<br>
The pump cavity 1350 is provided with a piamp member 1364 and actually operates with a displacement-amplifying mechanism including a pair of displacement amplifying spring members 1366, 1368 elongated to extend generally v^rightly adjacent the side walls 1358, 1360 as show in Fig. 13a. Each spring member 1366, 3368 is a torsion spring having a shallow V-shape biased towards strai^teoing or a springboard.   At the base of the V-shape a helical coil portion 1370 constitutes a<br><br>
buckling portion which engages a side of the pump member 1364. The spring members 1366, '.368 are pivotal or bendable at the pivotal belical coil portion 1370. lowar ends of each spring member 1366, 1368 are mounted to the reference portion 1356, and upper ends to the moving portion 1354 such that they are offset from a line joining die ends of the fixed and free ends, 1372, 1374 and are free to rotate. Like buckiii^ columns loaded in compression, the telative vertical movement 1363 between the ends of spring membras 1366, 1368 is amplified as they are deflected from a shallow V-shape to a deeper V-shape, each producing an amplified output displacement 1376, Figures 13c and 13d depict the same mechanism with a spring member that consists of a sprir^board rather than a torsion spring 1366,1368.<br>
It can that be envisaged that with the heel 1252 of the sole 1204 being resilient, during walldug, specifically upon heel strike, the heel 1252 is compressed between the wearer's  abuts an mner surface 1278 and a support surface abuttii^ an outer surface 1280 The heel 1252 expands again when the foot is raised. The oscillating expansion and contraction produced in this way is used to actuate the pump manber 1364 drawing in fresh air and forcing it through the shoe for ventilation, in partioular the pump member 1364 is actuated on action of the pivoting or bending of the spring members 1366, 1368. The presence of the above mentioned displacement-amplifying meclianism is advantageous because the extent of performance of the pump member 1364 depends to a large extent on a relatively small compression of tiie shoe sole 1204. During normal walking motion this  small compression of the shoe sole 1204, means that the addition of a pump-ventilated mechanism will not affect the wearer's comfort or ankle support.<br><br>
In the ptessnt embodiment, the pump cavity 1350 is an air tight chamber surroundings the pump member and is fitted with intake  and outtake  check valves and pipes so as to serve as a second chamber In a "dual-action" pump; the details of which were described before. Thus when the pump member 1364 is depressed, the chamber 1350 fills with ail and when the pump member 1364 expands, air is pumped out of the chamber 1350.<br>
Optionally, this design may also incorporate a temperature-regulatir^ or substance dispensing chamber and member for circulating warm or perhaps a scented air through the first cavity 1206.<br>
The advantages of this embodiment are particularly prominent when ^plied to hi^-heeled footv/ears. Most high-hseled footwears (typically referred to footwears having a heel of at least 1.5 inches) are notoriously known to be uncomfortable for a number of reasons. Providing ventilation to high-heeled footwears has also been known to be difficult because they are typically smaller and with minimal space for accommodating a venniation device. Figures 14a and 14b illustrate how the first embodiment can be extended to encompass a high-heeled footwear 1400 (only cross-section of footwear around &amp;e heel is shown). From these figures, it is ^own ihat there is a mid sole 1404 including an area between the top and the bottom of a heel 1452. A similar pump cavity 1450 esnclosing a pump member 1464 similar to the pump ca^aty 1250 in tiie pre-wous example is illustrated, although it resides within a high-heel boot or footwear bounded by an iqjper moving portion 1454, a lower reference portion 1456 and side walls 1458,1460. The pump cavity 1450 is expanded and contracted vertically, as show m Figs. i4a and 14b, respectively, the resilience of the heel 1452 being schematically represented by the spring member 1466, 1468<br><br>
biasing the pump cavity 1450 to its expanded position. When the heel strikes the upper moving portion 1454, it engages the spring members 1466, 1468 causing them to budde and press an actuating face 1472, 1474 against the pump member 1464. When the heel is raised, the resilience of the spring members 1466, 1468 causes the upper moving portiois 1454 to return to its normal state.<br>
The springs are provided with a helical coil portion 1470, which, is preferred to be a buckling portion being able to perform a pivot function at a mid region thereof because it E^proximates a hinge thus providing a latter displacement. The sides of the V-^iape are relative straight aad the coil portion 1470 jffovides a distinct break, however this is not essential. The spring meanbra^ 1466, 1468 may have a central reduced section providing tiie budding portion or it may be of substantially umform section such that a general, rather than localized bowing occurs irpon compression as shown in Figs. 13a and 13b. It is envisaged that even though the heel of a high-heeled footwear is relatively small, it can still accommodate the pump and the displacement-amplifying mechanism. It is to bs noted that while in some embodiments like the above first example the spring members are vertically arranged in the sole, they may be arranged in a generally V-shaped manner, conforming to the general shape of the heel of atypical high-heeled footwear.<br>
Embodiment 2<br>
A second embodiment of a footwear article or shoe is generally similar to the first embodiment, except this embodiment adopts an alternative displacement amplifying mechanism. The pump mechanism comprises a pump member 1564 enclosed in an air-tight chamber 15S0. As shown in schematic Fi^. 15ato Figs. 15d, the alternative displacement-amplifying mechanism includes a pair of displacement-<br><br>
amplifying levers 1566, 1568. Please note that Figs. 15c and 15d are similar to those in Figs. 15a and 15b except that thJey depict the inclusion of an inlet 1582 and outlet valve 1584 for the chamber 1580 and an inlet 1586 and outlet valve 1588 for the pump member 1564.<br>
The levers 1566, 1568 are fixed by respective pivots 1570 towards an upper region on opposite side walls of the chamber. The chamber is enclosed in a larger chamber, and there is provided an actuating member 1572 having an actuation fece 1572a fixedly secured on the inner xipper opposite sides of the larger chamber located in the heel of the footwear article. The actuating fece 1572a is inclined relative to and is positioned above the levers 1566,1568. When the sole positioned above the heel is not subject to pressure, there is a certain clearance 1574 between the actuating face 1572a and the levers 1566,1568 (S^Fig. 15c). Although when the sole is subject to pressure the actusting member 1572 is pushed downwardly causing the levers 1566, 1568 to pivot towards the pump member 1564, calling it to collapse (see Figs. 15b and 15d). The location at which the actuating member 1572 is attached is a movable portion 1554 wliich represents a downward moving portion of an insole of the shoe in a foot strike. With the heel in its expanded state, the levers 1566, 1568 He generally parallel to the side^valls of the heel or chamber. Upon compression, the actuating fece 1572a engages tiie upper ends of the lever 1566, 1568 when the moving portion 1554 is displaced, thus rotating a second part or lower end ttiereof, causing it to engage the pump member 1564, as shown in Figs. 15b, 15d.<br>
As depicted, the pump member 1564 can enclosed in an airtight chamber 1580 fitted with intake 1582 and outtake 1584 check valves and pipes so as to serve as a second part of cell or cells in a "dual-action" pump; the details of which were<br><br>
described before, Thus when die pump member 1564 is dei^essed, the chamber 1580 fills with air and when the pump member 1564 expands, air is pumped out of the chamber 1580 and into the footwear cavity.<br>
Optionally,, this design may also incorporate a temperature-regulating or substance dispensing chamber and member for circulating warm or perhaps a scented air through the footwear cavity.<br>
Embodiment 3<br>
Figs. 16a and 16b depict a third embodiment of a footwear article 1600 which utilizes the concept of £ weight-based amplified displacement mechanism. As shown m 16a, Ihere is a footwear article 1600 with a bladder 1602 residing in the mid part or front part 16G3 on top of a lever 1604. At the back part 1605 of the footwear, and close to the fulcrum 1608 , there is an interfece 1606 that when pressed downward causes the lever 1604 to pivot and results in. an amplified displacement for actuating a bladder 1602 located at an end of the lever 1604 far from the fulcrum 1608. In this example, the resilience of the lever 1604 is provided by a spring 1610.<br>
In Pig. 17, we show various examples of lever systems that can be used for the implementation of a "tlnrd embodiment,<br>

Embodiments  4<br>
A fourth embodiment of a footwear article 1900 — as shown in Figs. 19a, 19b, 19c and 20 -operates based on the bending and straightening of a footwear body during walking motion. The footwear article 1900 comprises a footwear upper 1902 and a footwear sole 1904 which together define a first cavity 1906 for accommodating the foot of a user. The footwear sole 1904 includes an insole 1908 and an outsole 1910 and a second cavity 1912 is located between the insole 1908 and the outsole 1910. The footwear sole 1904 includes a front portion or a forepart 1914, a mid portion and a rear portion or a heel region 1916. The sole 1904 is pa3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ement of the foot causes the footvrear sole 1904 to bend at flie bendable region (or relative rotation between the front portion 1914 and the rear portion 191-6). The footwear article 1900 fiirther comprises a mechanism for effecting ventilation or circulation of ail through &amp;e first cavity 1906. The merfianism^ includes a pump member 1918 generally in the form of a bladder or bellows and enclosed in a chamber. Atube 1928<br><br>
serving as a passageway between the exterior of the footwear and the pump is provied. Furthermors a tube 1930 serving as a passageway betvtfeen the pump and the footwear interior (first cavity 1906) is provided. Valves (1932. 1934, 1936, 193S) are provided at the passageways in order to control the direction of movement of air through the Uibes. The eonbodiment incliKies an actuation mechanism 1920 for controlling the opsialion of the pump member 1918 and hence the ventilation of the footwear article 1900.<br>
As shown in Fig. 20, the actuation mechanism 1920 is generally elongate in shape and resides in the mid sole. In this embodiment it is fixed in the fore part but the back end is free to move from position to position in the second cavity in response to bending or unbending of the sole. Tbe actuation mechanism 1920 is provided with a pivotable or bending portion ,1922 located at the bendable region 1924 of the footwear sole 1904. On beading of the footwear sole 1904, the actuation mechanism 1920, because of its bias to straightening, tries to maintain its defeult form. However, when the bending angle 6 (as depicted in Pig. 7) becomes too great, the actuation mechanism 1920 is also caused to bend at the pivotable portion 1922. The pivotable portion 1922 is generally in the fonn of a torsion spring 2026 having a central helical portion and opposing elongate legs or ends extending either side thereof being biased in generally parallel aligment. The rear end of the actuation mechanism 1920 is received in a second cavity and is particularly arranged above the pump member 1918, iacilitating the exertion of a downward force and compression on the pimip member 1918 when the footwear sole 1904 is bent. To ensure that the actuating mechanism 1920 is effective in depressing the pump member, an actuating face 20Q2 is attached to the spring as shown in Fig. 20.<br><br>
Fig. 19a shows the sole when both the front portion 1914 and the rear portion l9l6 of the footwear article 1900 are both in contact with ibs ground; the pump member 1918 laying between the rear end of the actuation mechanism 1920 and the floor of the chamber. During walking, when the rear portion of the footwear article 1900 is lifted and the rear portion 1916 of the footwear sole 1904 rotates relative to the front portion, due to the resilience of the pivotable portion 1922, bending of the footwear sole 1904 causes the actuation mechanism 1920 to exert a downward force depressing the pump member 1918. Fig. 19b shows a diagram of the footwear in a partially rotated position, whereas the rotation is significant enough to drive the rear portion (or free end) of the actuation mechanism (pivotable member) 1920 against the pump member 1918 but the amount of rotation is not ^gnificant enough to cause a significant bending in the actuation mechanism 1920. Fig. 19c illustrates a configuration in which  the actuation mechanism 1920 is rotated or bended at the pivotal portion 1922 in response to the footwear being bended fiirther. The inclusion of a pivotable member as the actuation mechanism 1920 is to ensure that there is not restriction on the normal walking movement of a wearer. It is to be noted that although the spring 2026 can be used for performing the pivoting function of the pivotal region, it is not necessary. Any appropriate device which can provide feis pivotable or bendable fimclion, such as a springboard would work equally well. Even a rigid board would work, however the use of this may restrict the normal bending motion during walldog. After bending when fee sole 1904 is again straig;htened the resilience of fes pivotal member restores the actuation mechanism 1920 to a straightened manner, and feus also restoring fee pump member 1904 to its expanded configuration as shown in Fig. 19a.  in summary, bending causes the compression of<br><br>
the pump member 1918 providing an outflow of air via the tube 1930 to the first cavity 1906 for ventilating the footwear article.<br>
Preferably the second cavity 1912 enclosing the pump member 1918 is an airtight chamber provided with intake and outtake pipes and check valves (1934, 1938). Thus when the pump is depressed there is also an inflow of aii to fill the chamber surrounding the pump. when the bending of the footwear article 1900 conclude, the actuating mechanism 1920 straightens restoring the pump member 1918 to its expanded state, causing air to be pumped out of the chamber to ventilate the footvrear article similar to the "dual-action" pump described in previous sections.<br>
Optionally, this design may also incorporate a temperature-regulating or substance dispensing chamber and member for circulating warm or perhaps a scented air through "the footwea cavity.<br>
It should be noted that this embodiment does not involve Hie compression or deformation of the rear end of the footwear sole to function thus preserving  the stability of the footwear<br>
Fig. 21 shows a design for a sole incorporating the fourrth embodiment wherein there is a slot 2102 to fix a spring member, acavity 2104 to fix a pumping mechanism and a passageway 2106 to channel the air out of the pump or to otherwise fix a tube.<br>
Fig. 22 depicts a similar footwear article to that in Figs. 19a, 19b and 19c except where the pump member and cavity are now located in the firont portion of lie footwear and the actuating mechanism is fixed in the rear portion.<br>
Embodiment 5<br><br>
Figs. 23a TO 27 illustrate a fifth embodiment of a footwear article 2300 according to the present invention. The footwear article 2300 similarly comprises a shoe upper 2302 and a shoe sole 2304 which together define a first cavity. The shoe sole 2304 includes an insole 2306, a mid sole 2308 and an outsole 2310. The footwear article 2300 also comprises a mechanism primarily housed in the mid sole 2308 for effection  or circulation of air through the first cavity. The ventilation mechanism comprises a pump member 2312 enclosed in an airtight chamfaM^ 2314, -which, is Located at a bendable region of the shoe sole 2304, Preferably, there is a passageway between the pump member 2312 and the shoe cavlq' and a passageway beiween the airtight chamber 2314 and ttie shoe cavity. Similarly, there is a passageway between the exterior and the pump member 2312 and a passageway between tiie exterior and the airtight chamber 2314. Valves are provided .at the channels in order to control the direction of movement through the passageways.<br>
The chamber 2314 containing the pump member 2312 is located at a bendable region 2316 in the mid sole 2308. The chamber 2314 is provided with a resilient ceiling wall 2520 which is deformable when subjected to pressure, as best shovvn in simplified Figs. 25a and 25b. The actuation means includes a number of rib members. Only one end of each of the rib members 2422 is fixedly secured at a region to the ceiling 2520 while the opposite end (or the free end) thereof is movable or pivotable away from the ceiling wall 2520 on deformation thereof, as shown in Fig. 23b. Since the cavity defined by the chamber is occupied by the pump member 2312, on deformation of the ceiling wall 2520 the free ends of the rib members 2422 presses onto the pump member 2312, thus pumping air into the cavity. In particular, the rib members 2422 basically pivots at or near at the attachment region.<br><br>
The pump member 2312 is preferably enclosed in an airtight chamber 2314 provided with intaface and outtake pipes and check valves, so that when the pump member 2312 to ventilaie the first cavity the chamber 2314 sucks in air from the outside. When the bending of the footwear article concludes, the rib members return to their default fonn restoring the pump member 2312 to its expanded state, causing air to be pumped out of the chamber to ventilate ihs footwear article similar to the "dual-action" pump described in previous sections.<br>
Optionally, this design may also incorporate a temperature-regulating or substance dispensing chamber and member for circulatiag warm or perhaps a scented air through  the shoe cavity.<br>
The footw^ear article in this embodiment is similar to the fourth embodiment in that the operatian of rhe ventilation mechatusm primarily depends on the beading of-the shoe during v.'aiking motion. As shown in Fig. 24, the rib member 2422 may be . spaced apart ttatisveisely in an alternating maimer.  Figs. 26a and 26b illustrate an alternative construction of rib members.    Fig. 27 is another illustration of an alternative actuation means with rib like members.<br>
Note:<br>
In each of our embodimente 1-5, we pump air firom the exterior into the footwear cavity. - But we can also draw air firom the footwear cavity and vent it outside by reversing the direction of the valves.<br>
Feature: Recircuiation Control Vaive<br>
As one of the supplementary features that help to extend the benefits of the current invention, a recirculation valve is included to regulate the amount of external<br><br>
air allowed for circulation into the footwear. In particular, it is envisaged that in cold weather the wearer may not want to circulate cold air from outside within the footwear-Referring to Figs. 28a, 28b and 2Sc, a pump-ventilated footwear article includss a recirculation control valve mechanism that includes a housing 2802 having an elongate aperture 2804, a first inlet port 2806 transversely opposite a second inlet port 2808, an outlet port 2810 at a longitudinal end of the aperture 2804, an internal passage 2814 via which external air or re-circulated air can pass and a -valve member 2812 for controlling the passage of air via fee valve mechanism. The valve member 2812 is provided wife the internal passage 2814 sealingly received for linear sliding movement in the iqierture 2804. Fig. 28a shows fee valve member 2812 in a first position with the passageway 2814 connecting ports 2806 and 2810 where 2S06 represents port extending to an external source. Fig. 28c shows passageway 2814 connecting ports 2308 and 2810 for drawing in air from an internal source accessible through 2808 and Fig. 28b shows an intermediate position drawing air from bofe ports 2S06 and 2808.<br>
Feature; Pump Design<br>
Figs. 29a and 29b depict fee top and side views of a pump member 2902 that is particularly suitable for fee third and fourth embodiment. The pump is of an elongated design has a back part wife a pipe 2904 at the centre wife a fore part wife fee pipe 2906 situated to one side. By situating fee outtake pipe at one side, fee pump can be more efficiently depressed as fee outtake pipe will not block fee movement of the spring or springboard acting on it as in the third and fourth  embodiment.<br><br>
Figs. 30a and 30b depict a similar pump member to that in Figs. 29a and 29b but one in which the back of the pump is larger than the forepart. This design is particularly suitable for use in the third and fourth embodiment because the angular rotation of the spring member is greater the further away it is from the pivoting point. In turn, the greater angular rotation at the back part of the spring member also causes a greater angular displacement at the back of the pump member.<br>
Feature; Soring Board<br>
Figs. 31a and 31b depict a springboard that would be suitable for use in place of a spring, in the fourth, embodiment The springboard comprises two elongated and relatively rigid boards joined at their ends by one or more spring members biased towards straightening.  This design is advantageous over a traditional spring because<br>
of its relatively thin-profile.-	<br>
Figs. 32a and 32b depict an alternative springboard, made up of a resilient, yet relatively rigid materia!. This design is particularly suitable because it is thin and can be made up of a material other than metal thus rendering it airport safe.<br>
"Feature: Temperature-regulating or substance dispensing mechanism<br>
This feature (Fig. 33) includes a footwear article 3300. provided with a temperature-regulating chamber 3302 or else a chamber for holding a substance to be dispensed inside the footwear via a ventilation or air circulation system. The chamber 3302 is sized and shaped to accommodate a heat-regulating member or substance dispenser such as a beat pad or a deodorant. The 3302 is connected wit the shoe cavity via passageways (not shown), such that warm or scented air generated in the<br><br>
chamber can be drawr. to the shoe cavity. This feature may be applied to the previous embodiments such that the warm or scented air can actively be drawn to the" shoe cavity during walking motion.<br><br><br>
