				<td>[Detailed Description of the Present Invention] [0001]<br>
[Technical Field of the Invention]<br>
The present invention relates to a continuously variable transmission having a centrifugal mechanism for moving speed change control members in the axial line of an input shaft by a centrifugal force applied to the centrifugal mechanism rotated integrally with the input shaft, to thereby continuously variably transmit the rotational speed of the input shaft to an output shaft. [0002]<br>
[Related Art]<br>
Continuously variable transmissions of this type have been known, for example, from Japanese Patent Publication No. Hei 2-39667. Fig. 6 shows a centrifugal mechanism of the related art continuously variable transmission, which includes a fixed cam member 26 fixed on an input shaft 23, a movable cam member 54 axially slidably<br>
supported around the outer periphery of the input shaft 23, and centrifugal weights 55 disposed between both the cam members 26, 54. A fixed cam face 261 and a movable cam face 541 are respectively formed on opposed faces of both the cam members 26, 54 so as to be inclined radially<br>
outward in the direction where they are closed to each<br>
•<br>
other. When the centrifugal weights 55 are moved radially outward by the centrifugal force generated when the rotational speed of the input shaft 23 is increased, the movable cam member 54 is moved in the direction where it is separated from the fixed cam member 26. As a result, a speed change control member 56 connected to the movable cam member 54 via a ball bearing 58 is axially moved, so that the speed change ratio is shifted onto the TOP ratio side. [0003]<br>
[Problem to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
Incidentally, in the above-described related art continuously variable transmission, a stopper 263 is provided at the leading end of a fixed cam face 261 of the fixed cam member 26, and when the centrifugal weights 55 are brought in contact with the stopper 262 and are restricted in the radially outward movement thereof, the speed change ratio becomes the TOP ratio. However, even if the centrifugal weights 55 are restricted in the radial<br>
     outward jnovement thereof in the state that the speed change ratio becomes the TOP ratio, the movable cam member 54 can be further moved in the direction where it is separated from the fixed cam member 26, and consequently the centrifugal weights 55 are rattered in the axial direction, to cause the movable cam member 54 and the speed change control member 56 to be vibrated. This presents a problem in the reduced durability due to wear of these members and the like. [0004]<br>
In view of the foregoing, the present invention has been made, and an object of the present invention is to provide a continuously variable transmission, which is intended to prevent a movable cam member of a centrifugal mechanism from being vibrated in the axial direction when the speed change ratio of the continuously variable transmission becomes the TOP ratio. [0005]<br>
[Means for Solving the Problem]<br>
To achieve the above object, according to an invention described in claim 1, there is provided a continuously variable transmission having the following configuration. Namely, centrifugal weights of a centrifugal mechanism are moved radially outward along a<br>
fixed cam face and a movable cam face when the rotational speed of an input shaft is increased, so that a movable cam member is moved together with speed change control members in the direction where they are separated from the fixed cam member and thereby the speed change ratio is shifted<br>
from the LOW ratio side to the TOP ratio side. In this<br><br>
case, when the speed change becomes the TOP ratio, the movement of the movable cam member in the direction where it is separated from the fixed cam member is first restricted. At this time, since the centrifugal weights do not reach the radially outward movement ends of the fixed cam face and the movable cam face, the restriction of the movable cam member by the stopper, the movable cam member is biased still by the centrifugal forces applied to the centrifugal weights in the direction where it is separated from the fixed cam member, to thereby prevent the movable cam member from being loosened. [0006]<br>
According to an invention described in claim 2, there is provided a continuously variable transmission having the following configuration. Namely, when cone holders are moved along the axial line by the centrifugal mechanism, the contact portions between the double cones supported by the double cone supporting shafts of the cone<br>
holders and the drive face of the input shaft and between the double cones and the driven face of the output shaft are changed, so that the rotation of the input shaft is continuously variably transmitted to the output shaft. In this case, the contact portions among the drive face/ driven face and double cones, which are required to keep high accuracies, can be prevented from worn by reducing the looseness of the movable cam member at the TOP ratio, resulting in the enhanced durability.<br>

[Embodiments of the Invention]<br>
Hereinafter, one embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. [0008]<br>
Figs. 1 to 5 show a first embodiment of the present invention, wherein Fig. 1 is a vertical sectional view of a power unit for a vehicle; Fig. 2 is an enlarged view of an essential portion of Fig. 1; Fig. 3 is a sectional view taken on line 3-3 of Fig. 2; Fig. 4 is a sectional view taken on line 4-4 of Fig. 2; and Fig. 5 is an enlarged view of an essential portion of Fig. 2. [0009]<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, a power unit P, which is to be<br>
mounted on a motorcycle, includes an engine E and a casing 1 containing a continuously variable transmission T. The casing 1 is divided into three parts,a center casing 2, a left casing 3 connected to the left face of the center casing 2, and a right casing 4 connected to the right face of the center casing 2. A crank shaft 6, which is supported on the center casing 2 and the left casing 3 by means of a pair of ball bearings 5, 5, is connected via a connecting rod 9 to a piston 8 slidably fitted in a cylinder block 7 supported on the center casing 2 and the left casing 3. [0010]<br>
A power generator 10, provided at the left end of the crank shaft 6, is covered with a power generator cover 11 connected to the left face of the left casing 3. A drive gear 12 is relatively rotatably supported around the outer periphery of the right end of the crank shaft 6 extending in the right casing 4. The drive gear 12 is connectable to the crank shaft 6 by means of an automatic centrifugal clutch 13 provided at the right end of the crank shaft 6. [0011]<br>
As seen from Figs. 1 and 2, a transmission main shaft 21 of a continuously variable transmission T includes<br>
an inner side output shaft 22, and a sleeve-like input shaft 23 relatively rotatably fitted around the outer periphery of the output shaft 22 via a needle bearing 24. Both the ends of the output shaft 22 are hung between the left casing 3 and the right casing 4. A driven gear 25 meshing with the drive gear 12 is fixed on the input shaft 23. The driven gear 25 includes an inner gear half 26 spline-connected to the input shaft 23, and an outer gear half 27 slightly, relatively rotatably connected to the inner gear half 26 via a plurality of rubber dampers 28 and meshing with the drive gear 12. When an engine torque transmitted from the drive gear 12 to the input shaft 23 by way of the driven gear 25 varies, the rubber dampers 28 act to reduce shock due to variations in the engine torque by deformation thereof. [0012]<br>
A drive face 29 having an annular contact portion 291 directed radially outward is spline-connected around the outer periphery of the input shaft 23, and a driven face 30 having an annular contact portion 30j directed radially inward is relatively rotatably supported around the outer periphery of the output shaft 22. [0013]<br>
A first cone holder 31 formed in an approximately<br>
conical shape is supported around the outer periphery of a boss portion 302 of the driven face 30 via a needle bearing 32 in such a manner as to be relatively rotatable and to be axially slidable. As seen from Figs. 1 to 3, a torque cam mechanism 33 for stopping rotation of the first cone holder 31 with respect to the casing 1 includes a pin 34 radially planted in the outer periphery of the first cone holder 31, a roller 36 rotatably supported on the pin 34 via a ball bearing 35, and a guide groove 41 formed in the inner wall face of the right casing 4 for guiding the roller 36. The guide groove 4a is inclined by an angle a with respect to an axial line L of the transmission main shaft 21. [0014]<br>
A plurality of double cone supporting shafts 37 are provided in such a manner as to cross a plurality of a windows 311 formed in the first cone holder 31. A double cone 39 is rotatably supported on each double cone supporting shaft 37 via needle bearings 38. The double cone supporting shafts 37 are disposed along a cone generating line centered on the axial line L of the transmission main shaft 21, and pass through a gap between the contact portion 29i of the drive face 29 and the contact portion 30l of the driven face 30. Each double cone 39 includes a first cone 40 and a second cone 41 which<br>
have a common bottom face. The contact portion 29j of the drive face 29 is brought in contact with the first cone 40, while the contact portion 30i of the driven face 30 is brought in contact with the second cone 41. [0015]<br>
A window 312 is opened in the upper portion of the first cone holder 31 facing to the crank shaft 6. The tooth face of the driven gear 25 contained in the first cone holder 31 faces to the window 312, and the drive gear 12 meshes with the driven gear 25 through the window 312. [0016]<br>
A centrifugal mechanism 51 is provided on the right side of the driven gear 25 for changing the speed change ratio of the continuously variable transmission T by axially sliding the first cone holder 31 in accordance with the rotational speed of the input shaft 23. The centrifugal mechanism 51 includes a sleeve 52 fixed around the outer periphery of the input shaft 23, a movable cam member 54 slidably fitted around the outer periphery of the sleeve 52 via a bush 53, and a plurality of centrifugal weights 55 disposed between a fixed cam face 26i formed on the right face of the inner gear half (fixed cam member) 26 of the driven gear 25 and a movable cam face 541 formed on the left face of the movable cam member 54. The outer<br>
periphery of the second cam holder 56 covering the centrifugal mechanism 51 is fixed by a clip 57 at the right end of the first cone holder 31, and the inner periphery of the second cone holder 56 is supported on the cam member 54 by means of a ball bearing 58. [0017]<br>
As seen from Fig. 5, the fixed cam face 26x and the movable cam face 541. are formed such that the radially outer ends thereof are closed to each other and a stopper 262 axially extending to the movable cam face 541 is integrally formed at the radially outer end of the fixed cam face 261. A stopper 631 capable of being brought in contact with the right end of the second cone holder 56 supported by the movable cam member 54 via the ball bearing 58 is formed at the left end of a spring retainer 63 (which will be described later). Accordingly, the rightward movent ends of the movable cam member 54 and the second cone holder 56. are restricted by the contact between the second cone holder 56 and the stopper 631 of the spring retainer 63. [0018]<br>
The first and second cone holders 31 and 56 cooperate to define a space surrounding the transmission main shaft 21. The driven gear 25," drive face 29, and<br>
centrifugal mechanism 51 are contained in the space. The space is also communicated to the inner space of the casing 1 through the window 312 to which the tooth face of the driven gear 25 faces and through the windows 311 supporting the double cones 39. [0019]<br>
A stepped collar 59 fitted to the right end of the sleeve 52 is supported around the outer periphery of the right §nd of the output shaft 22 by means of a ball bearing 60, and the right face of the ball bearing 60 is fixed to the output shaft 22 by means of a cotter 61. The transmission main shaft 21 including the output shaft 22 and the input shaft 23 is supported on the right casing 4 by means of a ball bearing 62 fitted around the outer periphery of the input shaft 23. A spring 64 is provided in a contracted state between a spring retainer 63 supported by the ball bearing 62 and the second cone holder 56. The second cone holder 56 and the first cone holder 31 are biased in the left direction by an elastic force of the spring 64. [0020]<br>
When the rotational speed of the input shaft 23 is increased, the centrifugal weights 55 are moved radially outward by centrifugal forces applied to the centrifugal<br>
weights 55, and both the cam faces 26i, 54j are pressed by the centrifugal weights 55. As a result, the cam member 54 is moved in the right direction against the elastic force of the spring 64, so that the second cone holder 56 connected to the movable cam member 54 by means of the ball bearing 58 and the first cone holder 31 are moved in the right direction. [0021]<br>
 A pressure adjusting cam mechanism 67 is provided between the right end of an output gear 66 spline-connected to the left end of the output shaft 22 and fixed thereto by a cotter 65 and the left end of the driven face 30. As seen from Fig. 4, the pressure adjusting cam mechanism 67 is so configured that balls 68 are each held between a plurality of recessed portions 66! formed at the right end of the output gear 66 and a plurality of recessed portions 303 formed at the left end of the driven face 30, and a disc spring 69 for imparting a rightward biasing pre-load to the driven face 30 is interposed between the output gear 66 and the driven face 30. When the driven face 30 is applied with a toque and is rotated relative to the output gear 66, it is biased by the pressure adjusting cam mechanism 67 in the direction being separated from the output gear 66 (right direction, in the figure).<br>
[0022]<br>
Referring to again to Fig. 1, a third reduction gear 71 is rotatably supported on the left casing 3 by means of a ball bearing 70, and the left end of the output shaft 22 is coaxially supported on the third reduction gear 71 by means of a needle bearing and a ball bearing 73. A reduction gear 75 is supported on the left casing 3 and the center casing 2 by means of a pair of ball bearings 74, 74, and first and second reduction gears 76, 77 provided on the reduction shaft 75 mesh with the output gear 66 and the third reduction gear 71, respectively. A drive sprocket 79, around which an endless chain 78 is wound, is provided at the leading end of the shaft portion of the third reduction gear 71 projecting outward from the left casing 4. The rotation of the output shaft 22 is thus transmitted to a drive wheel via the output gear 66, first reduction gear 76, second reduction gear 77, third reduction gear 71, drive sprocket 79, and endless chain 78. [0023]<br>
An oil passage 42 formed in the right casing 4 is communicated to an oil passage 221 axially passing through the output shaft 22, and each portion of the continuously variable transmission T is lubricated by an oil supplied from the oil passage 221 to the inner space surrounded by<br>
the first and second cone holders 31, 56. [0024]<br>
Next, the function of this embodiment of the present invention having the above-described configuration will be described. [0025]<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, a distance A between the contact portion 291 of the drive face 29 and the axial line L of the transmission main shaft 21 is constant, while a distance B between the contact portion 291 of the drive face 29 and the double cone supporting shaft 37 is variable (BL, BT). A distance C between the contact portion 30i of the driven face 30 and the double cone supporting shaft 37 is variable (CL, CT), while a distance D between the contact portion 301 of the driven face 30 and the axial line L of the transmission main shaft 21 is constant. [0026]<br>
A speed change ratio R is given by R = NDR/NDN = (B/A)X(D/C)<br>
where NDR is a rotational speed of the drive face 29 and NDN is a rotational speed of the driven face 30. [0027]<br>
When the engine E is rotated at a low speed, the rotational speed of the driven gear 25 driven by the driven<br>
gear 12 is low. At this time, as shown on the upper half in Fig. 2, since centrifugal forces applied to the centrifugal weights 55 of the centrifugal mechanism 51 are low, the second cone holder 56 and the first cone holder 31 are moved in the left direction by the elastic force of the spring 64. As the first cone holder 31 is moved in the left direction, the contact portion 291 of the driven face 29 is moved on the bottom face side of the first cone 40 of the double cone 39 and thereby the distance B is increased to the maximum value BL, while the contact portion 30i of the driven face 30 is moved on the vertex side of the second cone 41 of the double cone 39 and thereby the distance C is decreased to the minimum value CL. [0028]<br>
When the distance B is increased to the maximum value BL and the distance C is decreased to the minimum value CL as described above (the distances A, D are constant), the speed change ratio R is increased into a LOW ratio. [0029]<br>
On the other hand, when the engine E is rotated at a high speed, the rotational speed of the driven gear 25 driven by the drive gear 12 is high. At this time, as shown on the lower half in Fig. 2, since centrifugal forces<br>
applied to the centrifugal weights 55 of the centrifugal mechanism 51 are high, the second cone holder 56 and the first cone holder 31 are moved in the right direction against the elastic force of the spring 64 by the action of the centrifugal weights 55 moved radially outward by the centrifugal forces. As the first cone holder 31 is moved in the right direction, the contact portion 291 of the drive face 29 is moved on the vertex side of the first cone 40 of the double cone 39 and thereby the distance B is decreased to the minimum value BT/ while the contact portion 30j of the driven face 30 is moved on the bottom face side of the second cone 41 of the double cone 39 and thereby the distance C is increased to the maximum value<br>
C  T<br>
[0030]<br>
When the distance B is decreased to the minimum value BT and the distance C is increased to the maximum value CT as described above (the distances A, D are constant), the speed change ratio R is decreased into a TOP ratio. [0031]<br>
In this way, the speed change ratio of the continuously variable transmission T can be continuously changed between the LOW and TOP sides in accordance with<br>
the rotational speed of the engine E. Furthermore, since the speed change ratio is automatically controlled by the centrifugal mechanism 51, it becomes possible to reduce the cost due to simplification of the structure and to make smaller the size of the continuously variable transmission T, as compared with the case of provision of a speed change controller for manually controlling speed change from the outside of the casing 1 or of provision of an electronic speed change controller. [0032]<br>
Incidentally, when each centrifugal weight 55 is moved radially outward in Fig. 5 and the speed change ratio is shifted onto the TOP side, the movable cam member 54 and the second cone holder 56 are pressed by the centrifugal weight 55 and moved rightward; however, when the speed change ratio reaches the TOP ratio, the second cone holder 56 is brought in contact with the stopper 63: of the spring retainer 63 to be restricted in its movement. At this time, the centrifugal weight 55 does not reach the stopper 262 at the leading end of the fixed cam face 261 yet, and accordingly, the centrifugal force applied to the centrifugal weight 55 biases still the movable cam face 541 in the direction of separating it from the fixed cam face 261, that is, in the direction where the second cone holder<br>
56 is brought in contact with the stopper 631. [0033]<br>
Consequently, at the TOP ratio, the second cone holder 56 can be positively fixed, and the first cone holder 31 connected thereto can be prevented from being loosened along the axial line L. The contact portions among the drive face 29, driven face 30 and double cone 39, which are required to keep high accuracies, can be prevented from being worn by reducing the looseness of the first cone holder 36 at the TOP ratio, resulting in the increased durability. [0034]<br>
The rotation of the drive face 29 is thus transmitted at a specified speed change ratio R to the driven face 30 via the double cones 39 and the rotation of the driven face 30 is transmitted to the output gear 66 via the pressure adjusting cam mechanism 67. At this time, when a relative rotation is generated between the driven face 30 and the output gear 66 by a torque applied to the driven face 30, the driven face 30 is biased in the direction where it is separated from the output gear 66 by the pressure adjusting cam mechanism 67. The biasing force generates, in co-operation with the biasing force by the disc spring 69, a face pressure for pressing the contact<br>
portion 29j of the drive face 29 to the first cone 40 of the double cone 39 and a face pressure for pressing the contact portion 301 of the driven face 30 to the second cone 41 of the double cone 39. [0035]<br>
Incidentally, while the biasing force by the pressure adjusting cam mechanism 67 presses the output gear 66 in the left direction, the leftward pressing force is transmitted to the output gear 22 because the left end of the output gear 66 is fixed to the left end of the output shaft 22 by the cotter 65. Furthermore, while the biasing force by the pressure adjusting cam mechanism 67 presses the driven face 30 in the right direction, the rightward pressing force is transmitted from the driven face 30 to the right end of the output shaft 33 by way of the double cones 39, drive face 29, inner gear half 26, sleeve 52, ball bearing 62, collar 59, ball bearing 60, the cotter 61. [0036]<br>
Accordingly, the load applied from the pressure adjusting cam mechanism 67 to the output gear 66 and the driven face 30 for respectively pressing them in the left and right directions, acts as a tensile load for the output shaft 22, and the tensile load is canceled by an internal stress of the output shaft 22: As a result, the pressing<br>
load of the pressure adjusting cam mechanism 67 is not transmitted to the casing 1. This eliminates the need of reinforcing the strength of the casing 1 to such an extent as to withstand the pressing load, thereby reducing the weight of the continuously variable transmission T. Also, since the drive face 29 and the driven face 30 are biased<br>
*<br>
only by one pressure adjusting cam mechanism 67, it is possible to reduce the number of parts and the cost, as compared with the case where they are biased by individual pressure cam mechanisms 67. [0037]<br>
Although the first cone holder 31 is intended to be rotated around the transmission main shaft 21 by a reaction force to the transmission torque of the drive face 29 upon speed change operation by the continuously variable transmission T, the reaction force to the transmission torque is received by engagement between the roller 36 of the torque cam mechanism 33 supported by the first cone holder 31 and the guide groove 4i formed in the right casing 4, and consequently the first cone holder 31 can be slid in the axial direction without any rotation. [0038]<br>
When an engine torque is rapidly increased for rapid acceleration during running of a vehicle, a reaction<br>
force to a transmission torque, which is applied to the first cone holder 31, is increased along with the rapid increase in the engine torque. Consequently, as shown in Fig. 3, the roller 36 is brought in press-contact with the wall face of the inclined guide groove 41 by a load F, and the first cone holder 31 is biased on the left side (on the LOW ratio side) in Fig. 2 by a component F! of the load F applied in the direction of the guide groove 4j. Namely, the speed change ratio is automatically changed on the LOW ratio side by the action of the torque cam mechanism 33, so that the so-called kick-down effect is exhibited and the vehicle can be effectively accelerated. [0039]<br>
Furthermore, the speed change ratio control upon kick-down can be automatically performed by the torque cam mechanism 33 in accordance with a change in engine torque without the need of provision of any special speed change controller, so that it is possible to reduce the cost due to simplification of the structure and to make smaller the size of the continuously variable transmission T. In addition, the change characteristic of the speed change ratio can be easily adjusted only by changing the shape of the guide groove 41 of the torque cam mechanism 33. [0040]<br>
Although the lower portions of the first and second cone holders 31, 56 of the continuously variable transmission T are immersed in oil stored in the bottom portion of the casing 1, a large amount of oil does not permeate from the bottom portion of the casing 1 into the inner space surrounded by the first and second cone holders 31, 56 because the windows 311 supporting the double cone 39 and the windows 322 to which the gear tooth of the driven"gear 25 faces are positioned higher than an oil level OL of the oil (see Fig. 2). Even if a lubricating oil is supplied from the oil passage 22j. passing through the output shaft 22 into the inner space surrounded by the first and second cone holders 31, 56, the oil is scattered outward by the centrifugal force generated by rotation of the driven gear 25. As a result, the minimum oil required for lubrication is held in the inner space surrounded by the first and second cone holders 31, 56. [0041]<br>
Since the driven gear 25 stirs only a small amount of oil as described above, it is possible to suppress a loss in power due to the stirring of unnecessary oil at minimum. Furthermore, since the oil permeation is prevented by the first and second cone holders 31, 56, it is possible to eliminate the heed of provision of any<br>
special oil. preventive member and hence to reduce the<br>
number of parts.<br>
[0042]<br>
As described above, the arrangement of the driven gear 25 in the space defined by the first and second cone holders 31, 56 makes it possible to reduce the oil stirring resistance as compared with the case of arrangement of the driven gear 25 outside the space. Furthermore, the arrangement of the drive face 29 and the centrifugal mechanism 51 on the right and left sides of the driven gear 25 makes it possible to make use of the capacity of the above space and hence to make compact the continuously variable transmission T. [0043]<br>
While the embodiments of the present invention have been described in detail, such description is for illustrative purposes only, and it is to be understood that changes and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. [0044]<br>
For example, the invention described in claim 1 can be applied to a belt type continuously variable transmission performing continuously variable transmission by changing the width of a groove of a pulley. Moreover,<br>
although in this embodiment, the stopper 63j is formed on the spring retainer 63, any member which can be fixed on the transmission main shaft 21 along the axial line may be used as the stopper. In addition, although in this embodiment, the movement of the second cone holder 56 connected to the movable cam member 54 is restricted by the stopper 631, it may be replaced with the direct restriction of the movement of the movable cam member 54 by a stopper. [0045]-<br>
[Effect of the Invention]<br>
As described above, according to the invention described in claim 1, since a stopper for restricting the movable cam member along the axial line is provided and the movement of the movable cam member is restricted before the centrifugal weights reach the radially outward ends of the fixed cam face and movable cam face, so that it becomes possible to restrict the movement of the movable cam member in the axial direction when the speed change ratio becomes the TOP ratio. This is effective to prevent the vibration of the movable cam member, and hence to improve the durability affected by the wear due to vibration. [0046]<br>
According to the invention described in claim 2, the contact portions among the drive face, driven face and<br><br>
double cones, which are required to keep high accuracies particularly for a cone type continuously variable transmission, can be prevented from being worn by reducing the looseness of the movable cam member when the speed change ratio becomes the TOP ratio, resulting in the enhanced durability.<br>
