				<td>Transport device for a motor vehicle or a partially assembled motor vehicle during the<br>
production process<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a transport device for a motor vehicle or a partially assembled motor<br>
vehicle during the production process, as described hereinafter.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Transport devices of this kind are known. DÃ¼rr Automation GmbH in Stuttgart offers a system<br>
of this kind, in which various kinds of transport devices can be supplied with electrical<br>
energy. This system, known as "MOVITRANS", is offered, for example, in the 2003/2004<br>
catalogue. The system permits the wired, yet contact-free transfer of power and information to<br>
the individual, movable transport devices. Transport devices include the vehicle suspension<br>
units in overhead rail conveyance systems as well as skillet conveyors and so-called AGVs<br>
(automated guide vehicle systems). The transport devices are configured to receive vehicles or<br>
partially assembled vehicles during the production process, the vehicles or partially assembled<br>
vehicles being conveyed by means of these transport devices to the various work stations<br>
along the assembly line. At these work stations, the vehicles or partially assembled vehicles<br>
undergo tests and/or further assembly operations. The MOVITRANS system is described, for<br>
example, on pages 22 and 23 of Durr Automation GmbH's 2003/2004 product catalogue.<br>
WO 00/78594 Al describes a transport device, where the transport device is movable between<br>
different defined points along a distance. To protect the goods which shall be transported<br>
with the transport device there is a cabin to protect the goods from the environment. The aim<br>
of this patent application is to avoid provision of protection foils for the goods to prevent the<br>
goods from the environment. At least at one of the said defined points along the distance, the<br>
transport device can be connected with a power supply, whereby it is possible to have<br>
electrical energy to open, for example, the doors of the cabin to unload the goods from the<br>
transport device. The matter of this prior art is not concerned in any way with the problem of<br>
the energy situation of a motor vehicle or a partially assembled motor vehicle which are<br>
transported, as goods, with the transport device.<br>
The main difference between the transport device of the present invention and that of WO<br>
0078594 Al is that in the device of the present invention, as described and claimed<br>
hereinafter, the on-board electrical system of the motor vehicle (or partially assembled motor<br><br>
vehicle) is supplied with power via the transport device. The source of the power is provided<br>
by a terminal, and the power of said terminal is supplied from the power supply of the<br>
transport device.<br>
The object of this invention is to propose a means for the flexible testing and configuration of<br>
vehicles during the production process.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This object is established according to the invention by providing the transport device with a<br>
terminal for supplying power to the on-board electrical system of the motor vehicle or<br>
partially assembled motor vehicle to be conveyed by the transport device, the on-board<br>
electrical system of the motor vehicle or partially assembled motor vehicle being connectable<br>
to said terminal, and said terminal being supplied with electrical energy via the transport<br>
device's contact-free power supply.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a transport device for a motor vehicle or partially<br>
assembled motor vehicle during the production process, the transport device being configured<br>
to receive a motor vehicle or partially assembled motor vehicle, said motor vehicle or partially<br>
assembled motor vehicle being conveyable by means of the transport device to the various<br>
work stations, and the transport device having a continuous and contact-free power supply<br>
during the production process ;<br>
characterized in that the transport device is provided with a terminal for supplying power to<br>
the on-board electrical system of the motor vehicle or partially assembled motor vehicle to be<br>
conveyed by the transport device, the on-board electrical system of the motor vehicle or<br>
partially assembled motor vehicle being connectable to said terminal and said terminal being<br>
supplied with electrical energy via the contact-free power supply to the transport device.<br>
The advantage of this is that the vehicle's on-board voltage is already available during the<br>
production process, which means that the vehicle's electrical and electronic components (e.g.<br>
controllers in the vehicle) can already be tested - in particular for their proper working order -<br>
during the production process.<br>
It is to advantage that power is supplied via an already existent system, with which a<br>
"circulating" power supply for the production hall and, in particular, the movable transport<br><br>
devices therein is organised, so that no additional contacts, rails and sliding contacts are<br>
needed for the external power supply to the vehicle or partially assembled vehicle.<br>
The on-board voltage is still available after the vehicle has passed through the work station at<br>
which the vehicle's battery is installed and connected up. Thanks to this invention, tests<br>
performed on the electrical components do not draw on the battery, thus preventing any<br>
significant discharging during the production process.<br>
This is of particular benefit in view of the increasing number of electrical components in<br>
vehicles and the resulting increase in the number of tests that are necessary. The fact that the<br>
vehicle can already be supplied externally with the on-board voltage while the vehicle is still<br>
in the transport device has the advantage that electrical components can already be tested<br>
during the production process.<br>
Of particular benefit is the fact that tests can be performed as soon as all the necessary<br>
components for the given function packages have been fitted and connected up at the work<br>
stations concerned. If faults are detected and the necessary corrective measures are not<br>
excessive, these faults can advantageously be ironed out at the work station in question. This<br>
obviates the necessity of removing the vehicle from the assembly line for purposes of<br>
corrective action.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the device according to the invention, the terminal can be<br>
activated and deactivated by a control unit. Preferably, the control unit is a centralised host<br>
computer.<br>
The advantage of this is that the on-board electrical system can be de-energized if this is<br>
necessary to ensure employee safety or to avoid damage to electrical components during<br>
assembly work at any one work station. Once the assembly work in question has been<br>
completed, the external power supply can be reactivated.<br>
The information transfer to the transport device may be realised by means of a local network.<br>
This may be effected, for example, by means of the MOVITRANS system described under the<br>
prior art. When the transport device approaches certain work stations, the host computer may<br><br>
thus specify that the terminal on the transport device be deactivated, thus interrupting the<br>
external power supply to the vehicle.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the invention, the control unit is a mobile control unit that<br>
can be attached removably to the transport device or to the motor vehicle or partially<br>
assembled motor vehicle being conveyed by the transport device; power can be supplied to<br>
said mobile control unit via the transport device.<br>
It is practical that the mobile control unit can also be supplied with power via the on-board<br>
system, independently of the terminal on the transport device. This means that the mobile<br>
control unit can still be supplied with power even if the external power supply to the vehicle<br>
has been deactivated. The mobile control unit thus remains fully functional even if the<br>
external power supply to the vehicle is interrupted.<br>
As an alternative to or in addition to having the mobile control unit activate and deactivate the<br>
external power supply to the vehicle, provision may be made for the centralised host computer<br>
to activate and deactivate the external power supply to the vehicle.<br>
If the external power supply can not be activated and deactivated by the centralised host<br>
computer but only by the mobile control unit, this function is a decentralised function.<br>
If the external power supply can be activated and deactivated by both the host computer and<br>
the mobile control unit, it is possible, for example, for the host computer to initially deactivate<br>
the external power supply as a work station is approached, so that the necessary assembly<br>
operations can be performed. Once these assembly operations have been completed, which<br>
can be established, for example, by way of an appropriate dialogue between the assembly<br>
worker and the mobile control unit, the mobile control unit can reactivate the external power<br>
supply so that, for example, the necessary functional tests can be performed on the<br>
components just fitted.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the invention, the mobile control unit can be linked up<br>
to a diagnostic connector in the vehicle.<br><br>
This makes it possible, for example, for the mobile control unit to learn, prior to the<br>
production process, which function package is to be realised in the vehicle to be produced.<br>
The software for the controllers needed in the vehicle for these functions can then be loaded<br>
from the mobile control unit via the diagnostic connector. The link-up with the vehicle's<br>
diagnostic connector also permits the appropriate tests to be carried out during the production<br>
process.<br>
In yet another preferred embodiment of the invention, a mobile control unit can be attached<br>
removably to the transport device or to the motor vehicle or partially assembled motor vehicle<br>
being conveyed by the transport device; power can be supplied to the mobile unit via the<br>
transport device or via the vehicle's electrical system, and the mobile unit can be linked up to<br>
a diagnostic connector in the vehicle.<br>
In contrast to the aforesaid preferred embodiments the transport device's terminal for<br>
supplying external power to the vehicle, is not caused to be activated and deactivated by any<br>
mobile control unit. In all other respects, this embodiment works in exactly the same way as<br>
previously explained.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the invention, the transport device is integrated in a<br>
network for wired data exchange with a host computer. When mounted, the mobile control<br>
unit is likewise integrated in the wired data-exchange network.<br>
This arrangement permits data exchange between the mobile control unit and the host<br>
computer. For example, the results of tests carried out can be transmitted from the mobile<br>
control unit to the host computer. Similarly, current software versions can be transmitted from<br>
the host computer to the mobile control units. It is to advantage that this can also be effected<br>
during the production process at times when the mobile control units are not in use. The wired<br>
network may, for example, be the "MOVITRANS" system described at the beginning.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the mobile control unit is equipped with a<br>
transmitter/receiver unit for wireless data exchange with a host computer or with other<br><br>
stationary or mobile control computers. These other control computers may, for example, be<br>
test stations along the assembly line or assembly workers' hand terminals.<br>
Provided it is equipped with the full range of functions, the mobile control unit thus<br>
constitutes a mobile test and configuration computer. Configuration is effected by transfer to<br>
the vehicle - by means of the mobile control unit - of the software needed for the vehicle's<br>
equipment package and by activating the various functions in the vehicle. This applies to a<br>
vehicle variant in which the hardware and the necessary components for defined equipment<br>
packages are installed, and the software that enables these components to work is activated by<br>
an appropriate control unit.<br>
The advantage of having the mobile control unit attached removably to the transport device or<br>
to the vehicle or partially assembled vehicle is that the mobile control unit can remain with the<br>
vehicle if the vehicle has to be removed from the assembly line because a fault has been<br>
detected. The mobile control unit can then be deposited expediently in the vehicle, and<br>
because the equipment package intended for the vehicle in question is stored in the mobile<br>
control unit, the vehicle can easily be re-integrated in the production process - for instance,<br>
when the fault has been rectified. As a result, no special preparations need be made before<br>
returning a vehicle that was removed from the assembly line, providing the fault has been<br>
rectified. The vehicle can be re-integrated in the production process without any problem at<br>
all.<br>
The drawing shows a transport device 1. A vehicle 2 is attached to this transport device 1. The<br>
vehicle 2 can be conveyed with the transport device 1 in the direction of the arrow, thus<br>
enabling it to pass through the various work stations during the production process.<br>
Assembly operations and also tests may be performed at the individual work stations. Via the<br>
suspension means for the transport device 1, voltage can be applied to a terminal 3 on the<br>
transport device 1. The on-board electrical system of the vehicle 2 can be connected to this<br>
terminal 3 with the cable 4 shown here.<br>
The terminal 3 on the transport device 1 can be activated and deactivated, with the advantage<br>
that by way of said terminal, the external power supply to the vehicle 2 can be switched on<br>
and off.<br><br>
The terminal 3 can, in the first instance, be activated/deactivated via a host computer 5. To<br>
this end, the transport device 1 is riot only supplied with electrical energy via the suspension<br>
means. In addition, a wired connection is provided for data exchange. Via this wired<br>
connection between the host computer 5 and the transport device 1 (and hence also the<br>
terminal 3), the external power supply to the vehicle 2 can be switched on and off.<br>
Alternatively, or in addition, the terminal 3 can be controlled via a mobile control unit 6. This<br>
option is illustrated by the dashed line 11. The mobile control unit 6 can likewise be supplied<br>
with power via the suspension means for the transport device 1 and, alternatively, via the on-<br>
board electrical system of the vehicle 7. This mobile control unit can also be linked with the<br>
host computer 5 via the wired data-exchange connection. The mobile control unit 6 can be<br>
supplied, for example, with the current software versions for the controllers in the vehicle 2<br>
via this data exchange connection.<br>
The mobile control unit is attached removably to the transport device 1. The advantage of this<br>
is that in the event of a test showing up a malfunction that necessitates removing the vehicle<br>
from the assembly line, the mobile control unit 6 can remain with the vehicle. The fact that the<br>
information concerning the detected fault is stored facilitates the necessary corrective action,<br>
which in itself is an advantage. An additional benefit is that the mobile control unit 6 contains<br>
the information as to which components have already been installed in the vehicle and to what<br>
extent the necessary software has already been loaded. As a result, the vehicle can easily be<br>
re-integrated into the production process.<br>
The drawing shows a connecting line 7 leading from the mobile control unit 6 to a diagnostic<br>
connector 8 in the vehicle 2. The mobile control unit 6 can initiate and monitor appropriate<br>
test steps via this diagnostic connector 8. In addition, software can be transferred from the<br>
mobile control unit 6 to the corresponding controllers in the vehicle via this diagnostic<br>
connector. Especially if the mobile control unit is not designed to activate/deactivate the<br>
terminal 3, the connecting line 7 can be configured such that, on external initiation, the mobile<br>
control unit 6 can also supply power to the on-board electrical system of the vehicle 2 via this<br>
connecting line 7.<br><br>
It can also be seen from the drawing that both the mobile control unit 6 and the host computer<br>
5 may be provided with a transmitter and receiver unit 9 and 10. These permit wireless<br>
communication between the mobile control unit 6 and the host computer 5 or other control<br>
computers, for example test stations along the production line or assembly workers' hand<br>
terminals.<br><br>
