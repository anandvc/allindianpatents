3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention, in general, relates to novel compounds and process for the preparation of the same. The present invention, in particular, relates to novel amido-amine based compounds, the process for their preparation and the use of these novel amido-amine compounds as cationic Gemini surfactants.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Gemini surfactants are known as dimeric surfactants, which contains two hydrophobic &amp; two hydrophilic groups in the molecule, connected by a linkage near to the hydrophilic groups. These surfactants have dual hydrophilic &amp; hydrophobic nature. They tend to concentrate at the interface of the solution. These compounds are classified as anionic, cationic, nonionic &amp; zwitterionic as per their ionic behavior in the solution. The cafjorwc surfactant dimers with simple structure are referred to as m-s-m, 2X. Where m is the head group, s is the spacer. Most of the work was focused on the length &amp; nature of alkyl chains. A number of Gemini surfactants are reported in the literature. E.g. F. M. Menger, C. A. Littau, et. al. Gemini Surfactants: a new class of self assembling molecule, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 115, 10083-10090 (1993). F. M. Menger, C. A. Littau, Gemini surfactants: Synthesis properties, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 113, 1451-1452 (1991). R. oda, I, Hac, S.

Geribaldi, Enhanced activity of fluorinated quaternary ammonium surfactants against pseudomonas aeruginosa, European journal of medicinal chemistry, 44, 1615-1622(2009).<br>
In the recent decades, several papers have been published addressing the synthesis of a<br>
2<br><br><br>
new type of cationic gemini surfactants. Diz, M.; Manresa A.; Pinazo, a; Erra, P.; (nfante, M R. J. Chem. Soc, perkin Trans.2, 1871 (1994). Fuhrhop, J. H.; SPiroski, D, D.; Boettcher, C. J. Am. Chem.

Currently these quarternary ammonium compounds (QACs) have attracted attention especially due to their unique solution properties such as very low cmc, high surface wetting capacity, high Solubilization, high detergency. Mahendra S Borse, Surekha Devi, Importance of head group polarity in controlling aggregation properties of cationic gemini surfactants, colloid and Interface Science 123-126 (2006). Many of these QACs are useful as a catalyst in regie-selective addition reactions, Jin RH, Nishikubo T. Synthesis 1: 28 (1993);. Katrizky AR, offerman RJ, wang Z. Langmuir; 5: 1087 (1989), as an antimicrobial agents, Davis b, Jordan p. In: karsa DR, editor, Industrial applications of surfactants; vol II. Cambridge: Royal society of chemistry; 195-216 (1990). Gemini surfactants are more surface active than the conventional monomeric surfactaints. The hydrophobic part of surfece chain molecules is generally derived from a hydrocarbon containing 11 to 21 carbon atoms.<br>
Gemini surfactants are remarkably superior to conventional surfactants in characteristic features. They have a much lower critical micellization concentration (cmc), much lower values of the concentration C20 required to lower the surface tension of water by 20 mN/m. In terms of concentration, they are about three orders of magnitude more efficient at reducing the surface tension of water and more than two orders of magnitude more efficient in interfacial performances than conventional surfactants. Therefore, a small quantity of gemini surfactant can have dramatic effects in applications. Gemini surfactants are of much interest to manufacturers of cosmetics, shampoos, lotions, and personal care products because of their mildness, soft feeling, and absence skin irritation. They may also used as a Corrosion Inhibition, Micellar Catalysis, Antimicrobial activite agents.<br>
There is a need to develop novel cationic Gemini surfactants which can be prepared by simple, economical and environmentally friendly process.<br>

In an embodiment of the process of the present inventidn, the organic solvent in step 1) is selected from any conventionally used aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylene, acetonitrile; preferably toluene is used, for around 16-18 hrs.<br>
The step 2 of the process is carried out in a solvent selected from organic solvents such as acetone, ethanol, acetonitrile, isopropanol, chloroform for around 60 - 80 hrs.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the process for the preparation of the novel amido-amine compounds of Formu\a I, is carried out in an inert atmospjiere.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention relates to an aqueous composition comprising the novel amido-amine compounds of Formula I in water or water miscible solvent.<br>
In a specific embodiment, the water miscible solvent can be selected from any of the conventionally used solvents such as lower ketones sucn as acetone, lower esters such as methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, lower alcohols such as methanol, ethanoi, etc.<br>
In another specific embodiment, the aqueous composition can optionally comprise additives selected from any of the conventionally used additives such as thickening agent, anti-foaming agent, viscocity modifying agent, flavoring agent, perfumes, sterilizing or disinfecting agent, pH modifying agents etc.<br><br>
Yet another embodiment of the invention involves the use of the novel amido-amine compounds of Formula I, as surfactants.<br>
These novel amido-amine compounds have excellent surface activity and are useful as emulsifiers, solubilizing agents, dispersing agents, foaming agents, dispersing agents etc. They can be used in compositions for fabric conditioning, detergent compositions, as washing agents, as adjuvants for agriculturally active compounds and pharmaceutically active compounds.<br>
Still another embodiment of the invention involves the use of the novel amido-amine compounds of Formula I, as anti-microbial agents.<br>
The graph of the surface tension (v) vs the molar concentration on a semi-logarithmic scale (log C), for the preparation of Cationic gemini surfactants at 25 °C are shown in Figures 1, 2, 3. The Critical micelle concentration (CMC) which is defined by a sharp break and static surface tension at cmc (surface tension at cmc , Ycmc) is obtained from Fig. 1, 2, 3. As expected, the gemini compound exhibits a cmc value far below that of the corresponding monomer (Gemini surfactants shows from 5 to 550 times approximately lower cmc value than that of corresponding monomer.)<br>
The values for the static surface tension at cmc are less for gemini surfactants with propyl group as a spacer, while in case of gemini surfactants with hexyl group as a spacer it is not meaningfully different on comparison between its corresponding monomers. As the chain length of carboxylic acid is increased, it was found that there is a decrease in the cmc value. Thus, longer the hydrophobic chain, lower is the cmc value.<br>
The surfactant concentration at which the surface tension of pure solvent is reduced by 20mN/m is called as C20 The C20 value for Gemini surfactants are from 1 to 100 times approximately lower than that of corresponding monomer.<br>

For testing the surface activity of the novel amido-amines, the equilibrium surface tension measurements were made by the Wilhelmy vertical plate technique with a sandblasted platinum blade. The instrument was calibrated against distilled water. Sets of measurements were taken until the change in surface tension occurs. The graphs were plotted against surface tension values versus concentration of surfactant solution. The CMC (Critical Micelle concentration) values were taken during the sharp drop in the surface tension values. vmin refers to Surface Tension at cmc.<br>

Antimicrobial activity Study:<br>
The antimicrobial activity of the synthesized compounds were determined by the Well-diffusion method. In this method, Escheria Coli (ATCC-25922), Bacillus cereus (ATCC-10702), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC-6538), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC-8027) were used to investigate the antimicrobial activities. The bacterial liquid cultures were prepared in infusion broth for their activity tests. The compounds were dissolved in methanol at concentration of 1 mg/ml. Antimicrobial activity of methanol against the test organism was investigated, and was found to be nil. Approximately 1cm3 of 24 h broth culture containing 106 cfu cm3 was placed in sterile petri dishes. Molten nutrient agar (15 cm3), kept at 45 °C, was then poured into the petri dishes and allowed to solidify. Six millimeter diameter holes were then punched carefully using sterile cork borer and completely filled with test solutions. The plate were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. After 24 hrs, the inhibition zone that appeared around the hole in each plate was measured. Antimicrobial activity was determined by measuring the diameter of inhibition zone. All the tests were performed in triplicate and the results were presented as an average. Activity of each compound was compared with CTAB standard. These results are summarized in table 2.<br><br>
