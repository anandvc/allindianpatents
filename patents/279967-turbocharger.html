Turbocharger<br>
Description<br>
The invention relates to a turbocharger according to the<br>
preamble of claim 1.<br>
Such a turbocharger is known from EP 1 398 463 A1 . In<br>
this turbocharger, a heat shield is provided around its<br>
shaft on the turbine side and serves to protect the<br>
bearing housing from damage due to elevated temperatures<br>
on account of the exhaust gases of the internal<br>
combustion engine which flow through the turbine. The<br>
known heat shield consists of a single-layer component,<br>
the heat insulation properties of which, however, are in<br>
need of improvement.<br>
A further arrangement is shown in EP 0 160 460 B1, a disk<br>
spring being used here which exerts an axial preloading<br>
force on the vane ; ring to be fixed axially. The<br>
functioning of the heat insulation is not necessary on<br>
account of the remoteness of the turbine wheel at this<br>
point.<br>
It is therefore the object of the present invention to<br>
provide a turbocharger of the type specified in the<br>
preamble of claim 1 which firstly ensures axial fixing of<br>
the cartridge of the variable turbine geometry in the<br>
vicinity of the turbine wheel by means of a disk spring<br>
and secondly permits improved heat insulation in the<br>
direction of the bearing housing via the heat shield.<br>
This object is achieved by the features of claim 1.<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/133793	- 2 - PCT/EP2006/004905<br>
The disk arrangement of the turbocharger according to the<br>
invention is formed from at least two material layers,<br>
but if need be from a plurality of material layers, and<br>
includes both the function of producing the preloading<br>
force and the improvement of the screening function by<br>
increasing the heat resistance. As a result, it is<br>
possible to ensure the functioning, especially at<br>
increased exhaust gas temperatures.<br>
In addition, liquid cooling of the bearing housing can<br>
possibly be advantageously dispensed with.<br>
Due to the provision of a plurality of material layers,<br>
it becomes possible to provide an air gap between the<br>
material layers in order to further improve the<br>
preloading force properties and/or the heat insulation<br>
properties.<br>
To this end, one of the material layers is provided with<br>
a bend which provides two regions arranged at a<br>
preferably obtuse angle to one another, while the other<br>
material layer is designed as a disk in accordance with a<br>
Belleville spring.<br>
The subclaims concern advantageous developments of the<br>
invention.<br>
The material layers form two separate parts, preferably<br>
shaped plates, which rest one on top of the other in the<br>
region of their outside diameter.<br>
Furthermore, it is in principle possible for the material<br>
layers to be made of the same material or for different<br>
materials to be selected.<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/133793	- 3 - PCT/EP2006/004905<br>
In claim 10, a disk arrangement for a turbocharger<br>
according to the invention is defined as object which can<br>
be sold separately.<br>
Further details, advantages and features of the present<br>
invention follow from the description below with<br>
reference to the drawing, in which:<br>
fig. 1 shows part of a turbocharger according to the<br>
invention with a disk arrangement according to the<br>
invention, and<br>
fig. 2 shows an enlarged illustration of the disk<br>
arrangement according to the invention.<br>
A section of a turbocharger 1 according to the invention<br>
is shown in fig. 1, since this illustration is sufficient<br>
for the explanation of the principles according to the<br>
invention. Of course, the turbocharger 1 has all the<br>
constructional elements normally provided, which,<br>
however, as stated, are omitted in fig. 1 in order to<br>
simplify the illustration.<br>
Therefore a turbine housing 2 of a turbine is shown in<br>
fig. 1, said turbine housing 2 being arranged adjacent to<br>
a bearing housing 3. This bearing housing 3 is arranged<br>
between the turbine housing 2 and a compressor housing<br>
(not shown) of a compressor wheel (likewise not<br>
depicted) . The bearing housing 3 has the bearing for a<br>
shaft, which in fig. 1 is symbolized by the dot-dash<br>
center line M, since fig. 1 only reproduces the top<br>
section of the turbocharger 1 according to the invention.<br>
The shaft W carries the turbine and the compressor wheel<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/133793	- 4 - PCT/EP2006/004905<br>
and is mounted in the bearing housing 3 via a suitable<br>
bearing arrangement.<br>
A disk arrangement 4 of multi-layer design is clamped in<br>
place between the bearing housing 3 and a cartridge K<br>
which is formed by a VTG disk 12 having an axial stop 14<br>
and a vane ring 15 and is arranged in the turbine housing<br>
2 in an axially displaceable manner. Here, in the<br>
example, there are two material layers 5 and 6, which are<br>
explained in more detail below with reference to fig. 2.<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates the disk arrangement 4 between the<br>
turbine housing 2 and the bearing housing 3, two<br>
supporting regions 10, 11 being obtained, with which the<br>
material layer or disk spring 5, as can be seen in detail<br>
from fig. 1, is supported on the corresponding parts of<br>
the vane ring of the cartridge of the variable turbine<br>
geometry of the bearing housing 3.<br>
The material layer or the inner heat shield 6 is clamped<br>
in place at the outside diameter by the disk spring 5<br>
relative to the vane ring 15.<br>
An embodiment of the disk arrangement 4 according to the<br>
invention is shown in fig. 2. In this embodiment, the two<br>
material layers 5 and 6 are of two-piece design. Fig. 2<br>
illustrates that the material layer or disk spring 5,<br>
which applies the axial preloading force, has a conical<br>
configuration. Furthermore, the material layer 5 has a<br>
center aperture 16, which is arranged coaxially to a<br>
center aperture 17 of the material layer 6, serving as<br>
heat shield for the material layer 5, and has an equally<br>
large diameter. Provided between the material layers 5<br>
and 6 is an air gap 7, which further improves the heat<br>
insulation properties. This air gap 7 is achieved by the<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/133793	- 5 - PCT/EP2006/004905<br>
provision of a bend 8 in the heat shield 6, which divides<br>
the latter into two regions 9, 9' , which are preferably<br>
arranged at an obtuse angle to one another.<br>
