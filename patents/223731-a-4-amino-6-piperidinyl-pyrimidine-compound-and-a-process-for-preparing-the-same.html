				<td>A subject of the present invention is new antagonist derivatives of the vitronectin receptor, their preparation process, their use as medicaments and the pharmaceutical compositions containing them.<br><br>
A subject of the invention is the compounds of formula (I):<br>
	G	0	R4<br>
	R2<br>
		H<br>
	N	N<br>
	(I)		NH<br>
		N .—N	R3<br>
	Ri<br><br>
in which R1, R2, R3, R4 and G have the meanings indicated below as well as their physiologically acceptable salts and their prodrugs. The compounds of formula (I) are compounds having a pharmacological activity and can therefore be used as medicaments. They are antagonists of the vitronectin receptor and cell adhesion inhibitors and they inhibit bone resorption mediated by the osteoc lasts. They are therefore useful for the therapeutic or prophylactic treatment of diseases which are caused at least in part by an undesirable increase in bone resorption, for example osteoporosis. A subject of the invention is also the processes for preparing the compounds of formula (I), their use, in particular as a medicament, and the pharmaceutical compositions containing them.<br><br>
Bone is constantly subjected to a dynamic process which includes bone resorption and bone formation. These processes are mediated via specialized cells. Bone formation is the result of the deposit of a mineral matrix by the osteoblasts and bone resorption is the result of the dissolution of this bone matrix by the osteoclasts. The majority of bone disorders are caused by a disturbed equilibrium between bone formation and bone resorption. Osteoporosis is characterized by a dry loss of this bone matrix. An activated mature osteoclast resorbs the bone after adhesion to the bone matrix via the secretion of proteolytic enzyme, and protons inside the adhesion zone, resulting in depressions or hollows in the bone surface which appear when the osteoclast detaches itself fro iii ihebone.<br><br>
Studies have shown that the fixation of the osteoclast on the bone is mediated by receptors: the integrins. Integrins are a superfamily of receptors mediating the cell/cell and more particularly cell/matrix adhesion process, including in particular cLLIbI33 as a blood platelet receptor (fibrinogen) and a~f33 as a vitronectin receptor. The peptides containing the RGD unit as well as the anti ci~f33 antibodies are known for their ability to inhibit resorption of dentin and prevention of osteoclast adhesion on the mineralized matrices (Horton et al. Exp. Cell. Res. (1991), 195, 368). The peptide Echistatine, isolated from snake venom also contains an RGD unit and is described as an inhibitor of the adhesion of osteoclasts to the bone and is a powerful inhibitor<br><br><br>
3,<br><br><br>
of bone resorption in tissues cultured in vitro (Sato et al. J. Cell. Biol. (1990), Ill, 1713) and in vivo in the rat (Fisher et al. Endocrinology (1993), 132, 1411).<br><br>
The UvI33 receptor is a transmembrane glycoprotein which is expressed in a large number of cells including endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, osteoclast and cancerous cells which thus leads to a pluripotentiality of the compounds of formula (I) according to the invention.<br><br>
In fact, the ct~~33 receptors expressed in the membrane of the osteoclasts are the basis of the adhesion/resorption process, contribute to the organization of the cell cytoskeleton, and are involved in osteoporosis. The a~f33 receptors expressed in thc smooth muscle cells of the aorta, stimulate their migration towards the neointima, which leads to the formation of arteriosclerosis and the occurrence of post~ angioplastic recurrence of stenosis (Brown et al., cardiovascular Res. (1994), 28., 1815). The endothelial cells secrete growth factors which are mitogens for the endothelium and can contribute to the formation of new blood vessels (Angiogenesis).<br><br>
The antagonists of cIVI33 integrin can therefore lead to a regression of cancerous tumors by inducing apoptosis of the angiogenic blood vessels. (Brook et al. Cell<br><br>
(1994) 79, 1157).<br><br>
Cheresh et al (Science 1995, 270, 1500) have described anti-u~r33 antibodies or antagonists of the Uvf33 receptor which inhibit the process of angiogenesis induced by bFGP in the rat eye, a property which can be used for the treatment of retinopathies, in particular in diabetics.<br><br>
The Patent Application WO-A-94/12181 describes aromatic or non-aromatic substituted systems and WO-A-94/08577 describes substituted heterocycles as antagonists of the fibrinogen receptor and inhibitors of platelet aggregation. EP-A528586 and EP-A-528587 describe phenylalanine derivatives substituted by an aminoalkyl or a heterocycle and WO-A-95/327 10 describes aryl derivatives as inhibitors of bone resorption by the osteoclasts. WO-A-96/00574 describes benzodiazepines and WO-A-96/00730 describes compounds which inhibit the fibrinogen receptor, in particular benzodiazepines which are linked to a ring with 5 nitrogenous members as antagonists of the vitronectin receptor. WO9800395, W099/32457 and W099/3 7621 describe tyrosine derivative antagonists of the vitronectin receptor. EP0820991 claims cycloalkyl derivatives as antagonists of the vitronectin receptor.<br><br>
Other investigations have made it possible to show that the derivatives of formula (I) show marked activity as antagonists of the vitronectin receptor and of bone resorption mediated via the osteoclasts.<br><br>

The optically active carbon atoms contained in the compounds of formula (I) can independently from one another show the R configuration or the S configuration.<br><br>
The compounds of formula (I) can be in the form of pure enantiomers or pure diastereoisomers or in the form of a mixture of enantiomers, for example in the form of racemates or mixtures of diastereoisomers.<br><br>
A subject of the present invention is therefore pure enantiomers, mixtures of these enantiomers, pure diastereoisomers and mixtures of these diastereoisomers.<br><br>
The invention relates to mixtures of two or more than two stereoisomers of formula (I) and all the ratios of these stereoisomers in said mixtures.<br><br>

The invention also relates to all the tautomer forms of the compounds of formula (I), relating for example to the form represented by formula (I), with G = R7R8N-C(=NR6)-NH-CO- the form in which acylguanidine is present in the form of a -CO-N=C(NHR1)-NR2R7 group, and all the other forms which differ by the different position of the hydrogen atom are considered.<br><br>
The diastereoisomers, including the E/Z isomers, can be separated into individual isomers, for example by chromatography. The racemates can be separated into two enantiomers by standard methods such as chiral phase chromatography or by resolution methods. <br>
The physiologically acceptable salts of the compounds of formula (I) are in particular salts which can be used pharmaceutically or non-toxic salts or salts which can be used physiologically.<br><br>
When the compounds of formula (I) contain an acid group such as carboxylic acid, they are for example salts of alkali or alkaline earth metals such as sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium salts, and also the salts formed with physiologically acceptable quatemary ammonium ions and the addition salts with acids such as ammonia and physiologically acceptable organic amines such as for example triethylamine, ethanolamine or tris-(2-hydroxyethyl)amine.<br><br>
When the compounds of formula (I) contain a basic group, they can form an addition salt with acids, for example with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, sulphuric, phosphoric acid or with organic carboxylic acids such as acetic,<br><br><br>
trifluoroacetic, citric, benzoic, maleic, fumaric, tartaric, methanesulphon ic or para toluene sulphonic acid.<br><br>
The compounds of formula (I) which comprise a basic group and an acid group, such as for example guanidino and carboxylic, can be present in the form of Zwitterions (betaines), which are also included in the present invention.<br><br>
When appropriate a physiologically acceptable Q anion can be contained in the compounds of formula (I) containing a charged ammonium group. It is preferably a monovalent anion or an equivalent of a polyvalent anion of an organic or inorganic non-toxic, physiologically acceptable and in particular pharmaceutically acceptable acid, for example the anion or an anion equivalent of one of the acids mentioned above, useful for the formation of the addition salts.<br><br>
can be for example one of the anions (or anion equivalent) of a group chosen from chlorine, sulphate, phosphate, acetate, trifluoroacetate, citrate, benzoate, maleate, fumarate, tartrate, methanesulphonate and paratoluenesulphonate.<br><br>
The salts of the compounds of formula (I) can be obtained by standard methods known to a person skilled in the art, for example by combining a compound of formula (I) with an organic or inorganic acid or a base in a solvent or a dispersant or from another salt by cation or anion exchange.<br><br>
The invention also includes all the salts of the compounds of formula (I) which, because of their low physiological acceptability, cannot be used directly as medicaments, but can be used as intermediate products to implement subsequent chemical modifications in the compounds of formula (I) or as starting products for the preparation of physiologically acceptable salts.<br><br>
The present invention also includes all the solvates of the compounds of formula (I) for example the hydrates, the solvates formed with alcohols, and all the derivatives of the compounds of formula (I), for example the esters, prodrugs and other physiologically acceptable derivatives, as well as the metabolites of the compounds of formula (I).<br><br>

A subject of the present invention is also a process for the preparation of the compounds of formula (I). The compounds can generally be prepared, for example during convergent synthesis by coupling two or more fragments which can be derived by retrosynthesis of the compounds of formula (I). In order to avoid the functional groups leading to undesirable or secondary reactions during each stage of synthesis, it can be advantageous or necessary during the synthesis of the compounds of formula (I), to introduce the functional groups in the form of precursors which are then converted into the desired functional groups or to temporarily block these functional groups by implementing a protective group strategy appropriate for the synthesis which is known to a person skilled in the art (Greene, Wuts Protective Group in Organic Synthesis, Wiley 1991).<br><br>

of the R3 radicals of—C02-R5 or -502-R5 structure, and/or if appropriate to the hydrolysis and optionally to esterification or to amidification and/or to salification.<br><br>
By way of a variant, a subject of the invention is also a process for the preparation of the compounds of formula (I) in which<br><br>
a) a compound of formula (II) as defined previously is reacted with a compound of formula (lila):<br><br>

in order to obtain the intermediate compound of formula (IV):<br><br><br>

b) then a compound of formula I-let-NH2 is reacted, in order to obtain the compounds of formula (I) with G representing a Het-NHCO- group,<br><br>
c) then the compound of formula (I) obtained is subjected, optionally with cleavage of the R3-NH- function in order to regenerate the free amine, followed by condensation of radicals R3 of—C02-R5 or -502-R5 structure, and/or if appropriate, to esterification or to amidification and/or to salification.<br><br>
Coupling of a compound of formula (II) with a piperidine derivative of formula (III) or (lila) can be carried out in the presence of a hindered strong base under reflux. In particular diisopropylethylamine is used. The reaction can vary from 4 to 12 hours under reflux.<br><br>
At the level of the compound of formula (IV), when OR is a hydroxyl, therefore if a guanidine of formula (Het-NH2) is reacted with a carboxylic acid of formula (IV), then the carboxylic acid is firstly activated.<br><br>
Activation can be carried out for example with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCI) or with the O-((cyano(ethoxycarbonyl)-methylene)amino)- 1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TOTU; K~5nig et al, Proc. 21st Europ. Peptide Symp. 1990 (Eds Giralt, Andreu), Escom, Leiden 1991, p.24K3) or another activation agent currently used in peptide synthesis.<br><br>
Apart from the free guanidines of formula (Het-NH2), the guanidine salts can also be used in the reaction with the compounds of formula (IV), the free guanidines being formed in situ or by a separate stage by means of a base.<br><br><br>
The reaction of an activated carboxylic acid derivative of formula (IV) with the guanidine (or derivative) of formula (Het-NH2) is preferably carried out in a manner known per se in an organic protic or aprotic but inert solvent. In this case, solvents are used such as methanol, isopropanol, tert-butanol, dimethylformarnide, dichloromethane or tetrahydrofuran at temperatures ranging from 00C to the reflux temperature of these solvents, in particular during the reaction of the methyl or ethyl esters (OR is a methoxy or an ethoxy) with guanidines.<br><br>
The reactions of the compounds of formula (IV) with the free guanidines are advantageously carried out in an inert aprotic solvent such as dimethylformamide, tetrahydrofuran, dimethoxyethane or dioxane, if appropriate by adding a base such as for example potassium tert-butoxide, sodium methoxide or an inorganic base such as N-methylmorpholine. However, water can also be used as a solvent in the reactions of the compounds of formula (IV) with the guanidines of formula (I-let-NH2), for example by using a base such as sodium hydroxide.<br><br>
The reaction mixture is then treated and if desired the reaction product is purified according to the methods known to a person skilled in the art.<br><br>
The protective groups optionally present in the compounds of formula (I) obtained from the compounds of formulae (IV) with the amines or guanidines of formula Het-NH2 or from the compounds of formula (II) with the compounds of formula (III) are then eliminated by standard processes ; for example the tert-butyl ester groups are converted to carboxylic acid by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid, the benzyl groups are eliminated by hydrogenation or also the fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl groups are eliminated in the presence of secondary amine and other reactions are carried out using standard processes, for example by acylation reactions.<br><br>
The hydrolysis reactions in order to obtain a derivative of acid (COR4 = CO2H), the esterification reactions in order to obtain an ester or a prodrug (particularly COR4 = alkyloxycarbonyl or aryloxycarbonyl starting from the corresponding acid) or the amidification reactions (COR4 = mono or disubstituted aminocarbonyl starting from the corresponding acid) are carried out according to the usual methods known to a person skilled in the art.<br><br>
In particular the hydrolysis is carried out in an acid medium, in the presence of trifluoracetic acid for example, in a halogenated organic solvent such as dichloromethane for example.<br><br>
If necessary, the conversion to physiologically acceptable salts is carried out by processes known to a person skilled in the art.<br><br>
The starting compounds of formula (II) can be prepared according to the processes described in the literature or also are accessible by analogy. The<br><br><br>
15<br><br><br><br>
preparation of the compounds of formula (II) is illustrated in the diagram described above, it being understood that the present invention is not restricted to these syntheses or these starting products. It is not a major difficulty for a person skilled in the art to envisage modifications to the syntheses described in our Application for the preparation of other compounds of formula (II) according to the invention.<br><br>
Therefore a subject of the invention is the process for the preparation of the compounds of formula (II) characterized in that a compound of formula (V):<br>
		R2<br>
	x	-~	x<br>
	(V)	N ..—N<br>

			0<br>
		H2N	R4<br>
	(VI)		HN R3<br><br>
in which R3 and R4 are as defined previously, in the presence of a strong base.<br><br>
In general, a hindered strong base is used such as diisopropylethylamine under reaction conditions known to a person skilled in the art for the implementation of nucleophilic substitution. Preferably the operation takes place in the presence of dimethylformamide and at reflux temperature. Moreover the COR4 group will preferably represent a hindered ester group such as the tertbutyloxycarbonyl group.<br><br>
According to another variant of the invention, the products of formula (I) can also be prepared according to the following diagram:<br><br><br><br><br>

b) then the product of formula (I) is subjected , optionally to cleavage of the R3-NH- function in order to regenerate the free amine, followed by condensation of the R3 radicals of—C02-R5 or -502-R5 structure, and/or if appropriate to hydrolysis and optionally to esterification or to amidification and/or to salification.<br><br>
The reaction of the pyrimidine of formula (Ila) with the amine of general formula (VI) is carried out under conditions similar to the conditions described<br><br><br>
'7<br><br><br>
previously for the reaction of a pyrimidine of formula (V) with the amine of general formula (VI). In particular, it is possible to operate in diisopropylethylamine in an organic solvent such as an amide (dimethylacetamide, dimethylformamide for example), at a temperature comprised between 900C and the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture. It is also possible to operate by catalysis with palladium (for example tris(dibenzylideneacetone) dipalladium) in the presence of cesium fluoride, at the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture. It is understood that the functions which could interfere with the reaction are protected. The protection and release of these functions is carried out according to the usual methods which do not alter the remainder of the molecule.<br><br>
The condensation of the R3 radicals of—C02-R5 or -502-R5 structure on the free amine, and the hydrolysis are carried out as described previously.<br><br>

The operation is carried out under the conditions described hereafter in the examples and in particular in the presence of a hindered amine such as diisopropylethylamine, in an amide such as dimethylacetamide for example. It is understood that the functions which could interfere with the reaction are protected. The protection and release of these functions is carried out according to the usual methods which do not alter the remainder of the molecule.<br><br>
The compounds of formula (I) are compounds having a pharmacological activity and can thus be used as medicaments in particular in the treatment or prevention of diseases of the bone, tumorous diseases as well as cardiovascular disorders.<br><br><br>
17'<br><br><br>
Therefore a subject of the present invention is the compounds of formula (I) and/or their physiologically acceptable salts as a medicament.<br><br>
The compounds of formula (I) as well as their physiologically acceptable salts and their prodrugs can be administered to animals, preferably mammals and in particular human beings as therapeutic or prophylactic medicaments.<br><br>
They can be administered as they are or in a mixture with one or more other compounds of formula (I) or also in the form of a pharmaceutical preparation (pharmaceutical composition) which allows enteral or parenteral administration and which contains an effective dose of at least one compound of formula (I) and/or its physiologically acceptable salts as active ingredient as well as current and pharmaceutically inert supports and/or additives.<br><br>
The pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention allow enteral or parenteral administration, containing an effective dose of at least one compound of formula (I) and/or its physiologically acceptable salts as active ingredient as well as one or more pharmaceutically inert supports and/or one or more usual additives.<br><br>
Therefore a subject of the invention is the pharmaceutical compositions containing a compound of formula (I) as defined previously as well as one or more excipients.<br><br>
The medicaments can be administered orally, for example in the form of pills, tablets, coated tablets, film-encased tablets, granules, gelatin capsules and soft capsules, solutions, syrups, emulsions, suspensions or aerosol mixtures.<br><br>
The administration can however be carried out by rectal route, for example in the form of suppositories, by parenteral route, for example in the form of injectable solutions, infusions, microcapsules or implants, by percutaneous route, for example in the form of an ointment, solutions, pigments or colorants, by transdermal route in the form of patches, or by other routes such as in the form of an aerosol or nasal spray.<br><br>
The pharmaceutical preparations according to the invention are prepared according to methods known per se, pharmaceutically inert organic or inorganic supports, being added to the compounds of formula (I) and/or their physiologically acceptable salts.<br><br>
For the production of pills, tablets, coated tablets and hard gelatin capsules, it is possible to use for example lactose, corn starch or its derivatives, talc, stearic acid or its salts, etc. Suitable supports for soft gelatin capsules or for suppositories are for example fats, waxes, semi-solid or liquid polyols, natural or modified oils, etc. Appropriate vehicles for the preparation of solutions, for example injectable solutions, emulsions or syrups are for example water, alcohols, glycerol, polyols, sucrose, inverted sugars, glucose, vegetable oils, etc. Suitable supports for<br><br><br>
microcapsules or implants are for example glyoxilic acid and lactic acid copolymers. The pharmaceutical preparations normally contain from 0.5 % to 90 00 by weight of the compounds of formula (I) and/or their physiologically acceptable salts.<br><br>
In addition to the active ingredients and supports, the pharmaceutical preparations can contain additives such as, for example, diluting agents, disintegration agents, binding agents, lubricants, wetting agents, stabilizers, emulsifiers, preservatives, sweetening agents, colouring agents, flavouring or aromatizing agents, thickeners, buffering agents, and also solvents or solubilizing agents or agents to obtain a delayed release effect and also salts for modifying the osmotic pressure, coating agents or antioxidants.<br><br>
They can also contain two or more compounds of formula (I) and/or their physiologically acceptable salts. Moreover, in addition to at least one or more compounds of formula (I) and/or their physiologically acceptable salts, they can contain at least one or more active ingredients which can be used for therapeutic or prophylactic uses.<br><br>
The pharmaceutical preparations (pharmaceutical compositions) normally contain 0.2 to 500 mg, and preferably 1 to 200 mg of the compound of formula (1) and/or their physiologically acceptable salts and/or their prodrugs.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) are quite particularly antagonists of the vitronectin receptors and are therefore capable for example of inhibiting the adhesion of osteoclasts on the surface of the bone and thus bone resorption by the osteoclasts.<br><br>
The action of the compounds of formula (I) can be demonstrated for example in a test in which the inhibition of the binding of vitronectin to the cells which contain the vitronectin receptor is determined. Further information about this test is given below. As antagonists of the vitronectin receptor, the compounds of formula (I) and their physiologically acceptable salts are in general suitable for the treatment or prevention of diseases linked to the interactions between the vitronectin receptors and their ligands, in the process of cell-cell or cell-matrix interaction or which can be influenced by the inhibition of interactions of this type, to relieve or cure when inhibition of interactions of this type is desired. As explained at the beginning, such an interaction plays an important role in bone resorption, in angiogenesis or in cell proliferation of the vascular smooth muscle cells.<br><br>
Bone diseases the treatment or prevention of which require the use of the compounds of formula (I) are in particular osteoporosis, hypercalcemia, osteopenia, for example caused by bony metastases, dental disorders for example parodontitis, hyperparathyroidism, periarticular erosions in rheumatoid arthritis, and Paget's disease. Moreover the compounds of formula (I) can be used to relieve, prevent or treat bone disorders which are caused by treatments with glucocorticoids, therapies<br><br><br>
linked to taking steroids or corticosteroids or male or female sex hormone deficiencies. All these disorders are characterized by bone loss, which is caused by a lack of equilibrium between bone formation and bone destruction and which can be favourably influenced by the inhibition of bone resorption by the osteoclasts. Besides this use as an inhibitor of bone resorption mediated via the osteoclasts, the compounds of formula (I) and their physiologically acceptable salts are used as inhibitors of tumorous growth or of cancerous metastases, in the treatment of inflammatory disorders, for the treatment or prevention of cardiovascular disorders. such as arteriosclerosis or restenosis, or the treatment or prevention of nephropathy or retinopathy such as for example diabetic retinopathy.<br><br>
The compounds according to the invention can also have an activity with respect to other integrmns which interact with their ligands via the tripeptide sequence RGD (a431, O.v~5, ~HbP3), giving them pharmacological properties which can be used to treat pathologies associated with these receptors.<br><br>
This activity vis-~-vis the integrins therefore makes the compounds of formula (I) of use in the prevention or treatment of numerous diseases such as those mentioned above or in the publication by Dermot Cox DN§P 8(4) May 1995, 197— 205 the content of which is incorporated in the present Application.<br><br>
Therefore a more particular subject of the present invention is a compound of formula (I) and/or its physiologically acceptable salts as defined above as a medicament having an antagonist activity on the vitronectin receptor.<br><br>
Therefore a more particular subject of the present invention is a compound of formula (I) and/or its physiologically acceptable salts and/or its prodrugs as defined above as a medicament having an inhibitory activity on bone resorption or for the treatment or prevention of osteoporosis.<br><br>
Therefore a more particular subject of the present invention is a compound of formula (I) and/or its physiologically acceptable salts as defined above as a medicament having an inhibitory activity on tumorous growth or cancerous metastases.<br><br>
Therefore a more particular subject of the present invention is a compound of formula (I) and/or its physiologically acceptable salts as defined above as a medicament having an anti-inflammatory activity or for the treatment or prevention of cardiovascular disorders, restenosis, arteriosclerosis, nephropathies or retinopathies.<br><br>
A subject of the present invention is also the use of the compounds of formula (I) and/or their physiologically acceptable salts as defined above for the preparation of medicaments intended for the prevention or treatment of osteoporosis.<br><br><br>
21<br><br><br>
A subject of the present invention is also the use of the compounds of formula (I) and/or their physiologically acceptable salts as defined above for the preparation of medicaments intended to inhibit tumorous growth or cancerous metastases.<br><br>
A subject of the present invention is also the use of the compounds of formula (I) and/or their physiologically acceptable salts as defined above for the preparation of medicaments intended for the prevention or the treatment of cardiovascular disorders, restenosis, arteriosclerosis, nephropathies or retinopathies.<br><br>
When the compounds of formula (I) are used, the doses can vary within broad limits and must be set according to the person treated. This depends for example on the compound used and the nature and severity of the disease to be treated, whether the conditions are serious or acute and if a prophylactic treatment is used.<br><br>
In the case of administration by oral route, the daily dose in general varies from<br><br>
0.01	to 100 mg/kg and preferably from 0.1 to 50 mg/kg, in particular from 0.1 to<br><br>
5 mg/kg. For example, for an adult weighing 75 kg, a daily dose can be envisaged<br><br>
varying from 0.3 to 0.5 mg/kg.<br><br>
In the case of administration by intravenous route, the daily dose varies approximately from 0.01 to 100 mg/kg and preferably from 0.05 to 10 mg/kg.<br><br>
The daily dose can be divided, in particular in the case of the administration of a large quantity of active ingredient, into several, for example 2, 3 or 4 parts. If appropriate, depending on individual behaviour, it may be necessary to administer different increasing or decreasing doses.<br><br>
Apart from the use of the compounds of formula (I) as medicaments, it is also possible to envisage their use as a vehicle or support for active ingredients in order to deliver these active compounds specifically towards the target (Drug targeting, see Targeted Drug Delivery, R.C. Juliano, Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology, Vol 100, Ed. Born, G.V.R. et al, Springer Verlag). The active ingredients which can be delivered are in particular those used for the treatment or prevention of the diseases mentioned above.<br><br>
The compounds of formula (I) and their salts can also be used as a diagnostic agent, for example for in vitro methods or as auxiliaries in biochemical studies in which blocking the vitronectin receptor or influencing cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions are desired. They can moreover be used as an intermediate for the preparation of other compounds, in particular other active ingredients, which are accessible from the compounds of formula (I), for example by modification or introduction of radicals or functional groups.<br><br><br>

EXAMPLES<br>
The products were identified by mass spectrum (MS), infrared (IR) and/or NMR spectrum. The compounds which were purified by chromatography using an eluent which contains for example acetic or trifluoroacetic acid, and which are then dried or in which, during the last synthesis stage, for example trifluoroacetic acid was used in order to eliminate a tert-butyl protective group, sometimes contain, depending on the manner in which the product was dried, the acid originating from the eluent or the last synthesis stage and are therefore found partially or completely in the form of the salt of the acid used, for example in the form of an acetic or trifluoroacetic acid salt. They can also be more or less hydrated.<br><br>
