				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
MODIFIED CONJUGATED DIENE POLYMER AND<br>
PROCESS FOR PRODUCING THEROF<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a modified conjugated diene polymer, a process<br>
for producing the polymer, and a composition using the polymer. More particularly,<br>
the present invention relates to a modified conjugated diene polymer having a<br>
modifying group in the molecule, a process for producing the modified polymer, a<br>
composition using the modified polymer, and a tire containing the composition of the<br>
modified polymer.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
With a recent demand for reducing fuel consumption of automobiles, there is a<br>
need for a conjugated diene polymer which exhibits low rolling resistance, excellent<br>
abrasion resistance and excellent tensile properties as a rubber material for tire, and<br>
ensures drivability represented by wet skid performance.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Problems to be solved by the Invention<br>
[0003]<br>
In order to reduce the rolling resistance of a tire, it is necessary to reduce the<br>
hysteresis loss of vulcanized rubber. As the evaluation indices for the hysteresis loss<br>
of vulcanized rubber, rebound resilience at 50 to 80째C, tan 8 at 50 to 80째C, Goodrich<br><br>
heat buildup, and the like are used. A rubber material with large rebound resilience at<br>
50 to 80째C and a small tan 5 at 50 to 80째C or small Goodrich heat buildup exhibits a<br>
small hysteresis loss. Examples of the rubber material with the low hysteresis loss<br>
may include natural rubber, polyisoprene rubber, polybutadiene rubber, and the like.<br>
However, these rubber materials exhibit poor wet skid performance. As a method for<br>
reducing hysteresis loss without impairing wet skid performance, a method of<br>
introducing a modifying group into the polymer terminal of a styrene-butadiene<br>
copolymer having various structures, obtained by polymerization in a hydrocarbon<br>
solvent using an organolithium initiator, has been proposed.<br>
[0004]<br>
WO 2001/023467 discloses a composition which is obtained by compounding<br>
silica into a modified polymer produced by reacting a poly functional compound having<br>
an epoxy group in the molecule with an active terminal of a rubber-like polymer.<br>
However, improvements of the hysteresis loss and abrasion resistance of the<br>
composition compounded with the silica were still insufficient.<br>
[0005]<br>
JP-A-11-29659 and JP-A-61-296001 disclose modified polymers produced by<br>
reacting a specific amide compound with an active terminal of a rubber-like polymer<br>
and a composition of the modified polymer. Although these compositions prepared by<br>
compounding carbon black or silica into the modified polymers exhibited improved<br>
hysteresis loss and improved abrasion resistance, the degree of the improvements in<br>
those properties were still insufficient.<br>
[0006]<br>
JP-A-7-233217 and WO 2003/087171 disclose diene rubbers into which a<br>
tertiary amino group and an alkoxysilyl group are introduced. By compounding silica<br>
or a mixture of silica and carbon black into the modified polymers, those properties can<br>
be improved in some degree. However, the composition into which silica is<br><br>
compounded exhibits inferior processability as compared with the composition into<br>
which carbon black is compounded, therefore, it causes the problem of an increased<br>
processing cost. Generally a polymer in which a functional group having affinity with<br>
silica is introduced tends to have poor processability in compounding and have a<br>
problem of a limitation in its use.<br>
[0007]<br>
JP-A-2004-18795 discloses a modified polymer having a primary amino group<br>
and an alkoxysilyl group. This patent document also discloses a modified polymer of<br>
which the polymer chain has a polyfunctional monomer copolymerized therewith or at<br>
least a part of the copolymer is coupled with a coupling agent having two or more<br>
functional groups. However, these modified polymers also have a problem of poor<br>
processability due to strong affinity of the primary amino group with fillers. In<br>
addition, the process for producing the modified polymers required to a complicated<br>
hydrolysis step for producing a primary amino group.<br>
[0008]<br>
JP-A-11-349632 discloses a diene rubber into which a methylene amino group<br>
and an alkoxysilyl group are introduced and a composition containing the modified<br>
diene rubber. Although the composition prepared by compounding carbon black and<br>
silica into the modified polymer exhibited an improved hysteresis loss and improved<br>
abrasion resistance, balanced improvement between the hysteresis loss and the wet skid<br>
performance was still insufficient.<br>
[0009]<br>
JP-A-2005-290355 discloses a modified polymer having a tertiary amino group<br>
and an alkoxysilyl group and a composition containing the modified polymer.<br>
Although the composition prepared by compounding silica into the modified polymer<br>
exhibited an improved hysteresis loss, the degree of the improvement was still<br>
insufficient.<br><br>
[0010]<br>
JP-A-11-189616 discloses a modified polymer produced by reacting a<br>
cycloaminoalkoxysilane compound with an active terminal of a rubber-like polymer and<br>
a composition of the modified polymer. Although the composition prepared by<br>
compounding carbon black and silica into the modified polymer exhibited an improved<br>
hysteresis loss and improved abrasion resistance, without impairing wet skid<br>
performance, the composition tends to exhibit poor processability.<br>

Means for Solving the Problems<br>
[0011]<br>
Objects of the present invention are to provide a modified conjugated diene<br>
polymer exhibiting an excellent balanced properties among wet skid performance, low<br>
hysteresis loss properties, abrasion resistance, and tensile strength when vulcanized,<br>
irrespective of the types and the combination of fillers being compounded to provide a<br>
process for producing the modified polymer and to provide a composition comprising<br>
the modified polymer. Another object of the present invention is to provide a tire<br>

Advantageous Effect of the Invention<br>
[0029]<br>
Due to the capability of homogeneously dispersing fillers in the form of fine<br>
particles, the modified conjugated diene polymer according to the present invention can<br>
produce a composition having a preferable viscosity which makes it possible to select a<br>
more wide range of kneading conditions than the conventional ones, when various<br>
fillers are compounded. In addition, since the filler is homogeneously dispersed in the<br>
form of fine particles in the matrix of the conjugated diene polymer, the resulting<br>
composition exhibits high performance constantly. As a result, the vulcanized rubber<br>
composition obtained by vulcanizing the modified conjugated diene polymer exhibits<br>
high performance, with excellent wet skid performance and low hysteresis loss<br>
properties, which are the characteristics in a trade-off relation, as well as abrasion<br>
resistance and tensile strength in a sufficiently balanced manner, when the vulcanized<br>
rubber composition is used for a tire. In addition to the application for a tire, the<br>
vulcanized rubber composition is also suitable for shoes, a damper, and the like.<br>
[0030]<br>
Furthermore, since fillers such as silica, carbon black, a metal oxide, and a metal<br>
hydride can be uniformly dispersed even in a case where the modified conjugated diene<br>
polymer composition according to the present invention is a thermoplastic elastomer,<br>
improvements in strength, flame retardancy, tensile strength, and transparency which<br>
have not been achieved by the conventional composition, can be achieved. For<br>
example, when the composition used in an asphalt composition, an improvement of<br>
aggregate grip and the like can be obtained. When the modified conjugated diene<br><br>
polymer according to the present invention is compounded with other polar resins, a<br>
high performance composition can be easily obtained due to the improved compatibility.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
[0031]<br>
Next, embodiments of the present invention will be described. The following<br>
embodiments are given in order to illustrate the present invention and should not be<br>
construed to be limiting of the present invention. The present invention can be<br>
implemented in a various manners to the extent not departing from the gist thereof.<br>
[0032]<br>
The modified conjugated diene polymer according to the present invention<br>
comprises a modifying group based on a low molecular weight compound having two<br>
or more tertiary amino groups and one or more alkoxysilyl groups in a molecule which<br>
bonds to a conjugated diene polymer obtained by polymerization of a conjugated diene<br>
compound or a conjugated diene polymer obtained by copolymerization of a conjugated<br>
diene compound and an aromatic vinyl compound. The modified conjugated diene<br>
polymer according to the present invention can exhibit the above-mentioned excellent<br>
effects due to having specific modifying groups in the molecule.<br>
[0033]<br>
The conjugated diene polymer which constitutes the modified conjugated diene<br>
polymer, is a homopolymer of a single conjugated diene compound, a copolymer of two<br>
or more different conjugated diene compounds, or a copolymer of a conjugated diene<br>
compound and an aromatic vinyl compound.<br>
[0034]<br>
Examples of the conjugated diene compound may include 1,3-butadiene,<br>
isoprene, 2,3-dimethyl-l,3-butadiene, 1,3-pentadiene, 3-methyl-l,3-pentadiene,<br>
1,3-heptadiene, 1,3-hexadiene and the like. These conjugated diene compounds may<br><br>
be used either alone or in combination of two or more. Preferable examples may<br>
include 1, 3-butadiene and isoprene.<br>
[0035]<br>
Examples of the aromatic vinyl compound may include styrene, p-methylstyrene,<br>
a-methylstyrene, vinyl ethylbenzene, vinyl xylene, vinyl naphthalene, diphenylethylene<br>
and the like. These aromatic vinyl compounds may be used either alone or in<br>
combination of two or more. Preferable examples may include styrene.<br>
[0036]<br>
In order to prevent cold flow of the conjugated diene polymer, polyfunctional<br>
aromatic vinyl compounds such as divinylbenzene can also be used from the viewpoint<br>
of controlling branches.<br>
[0037]<br>
The conjugated diene polymer may be either a random copolymer or a block<br>
copolymer. Examples of the random copolymer include a butadiene-isoprene random<br>
copolymer, a butadiene-styrene random copolymer, an isoprene-styrene random<br>
copolymer, a butadiene-isoprene-styrene random copolymer, and the like. As the<br>
compositional distribution of monomers in the copolymer chain, a complete random<br>
copolymer which is close to a statistical random composition, a tapered random<br>
copolymer in which the composition has a tapered distribution, and the like can be<br>
given. The bonding pattern of conjugated dienes, that is, the composition of 1,4-bond,<br>
1,2-bond, and the like may be exist either uniformly or having distribution in the<br>
composition.<br>
[0038]<br>
Examples of the block copolymers may include a 2-type block copolymer which<br>
consists of two blocks, a 3-type block copolymer which consists of three blocks, a<br>
4-type block copolymer which has four blocks, and the like. For example, when a<br>
block which consists of an aromatic vinyl compound such as styrene is indicated by S<br><br>
and a block which has a conjugated diene compound such as butadiene, isoprene, and<br>
the like and/or a block which has a copolymer of an aromatic vinyl compound and a<br>
conjugated diene compound is indicated by B, these polymers can be represented by an<br>
S-B 2-type block copolymer, an S-B-S 3-type block copolymer, an S-B-S-B 4-type<br>
block copolymer, and the like. In the block copolymers represented by the<br>
above-mentioned formulas, the boundary of each block does not necessarily need to be<br>
clearly distinguished. When the block B is a copolymer of an aromatic vinyl<br>
compound and a conjugated diene compound, the aromatic vinyl compound in the block<br>
B may be either uniformly distributed or distributed in a tapered form. In addition, the<br>
block B may contain a part in which an aromatic vinyl compound is uniformly<br>
distributed and/or a part in which an aromatic vinyl compound is distributed in a tapered<br>
form. Two or more of these parts may exist in the block B. Moreover, the block B<br>
may contain two or more segments, each having a content of aromatic vinyl compound<br>
differing from the other. When there are two or more blocks S and two or more blocks<br>
B in the copolymer, the molecular weight, the structure of the composition, and the like<br>
in these two or more blocks may be either the same or different from each other.<br>

The conjugated diene polymer which constitutes the modified conjugated diene<br>
polymer according to the present invention may be a hydrogenated conjugated diene<br>
copolymer obtained by converting all or a part of the double bonds of the conjugated<br>
diene polymer into saturated hydrocarbons. Since the modified conjugated diene<br>
polymer in which all or a part of the double bonds have been converted into saturated<br>
hydrocarbons has improved heat resistance and weather resistance, it is possible to<br>
prevent deterioration of the product when processed at a high temperature. In addition,<br>
it is possible to change mobility of molecules or to improve compatibility with other<br>
polymer compounds. As a result, such a hydrogenated modified conjugated diene<br>
polymer exhibits excellent performance in various applications such as application for<br>
automobiles.<br>

More specifically, the degree of hydrogenation of unsaturated double bonds<br>
based on the conjugated diene compounds in the conjugated diene polymer according to<br>
the present invention can be arbitrarily selected according to the objective, without any<br>
particular limitations. In order to obtain a polymer with good heat aging resistance and<br>
weather resistance, the degree of hydrogenation of unsaturated double bonds based on<br>
the conjugated diene compounds in the conjugated diene polymer is preferably more<br><br>
than 70%, more preferably 75% or more, still more preferably 85% or more, and<br>
particularly preferably 90% or more. In order to improve heat stability, molecule<br>
mobility, or compatibility with other resins, the degree of hydrogenation in the<br>
conjugated diene polymer is preferably from 3 to 70%, more preferably from 5 to 65%,<br>
and still more preferably from 10 to 60%. Although there are no particular limitations,<br>
the degree of hydrogenation of aromatic double bonds based on the aromatic vinyl<br>
compound in the copolymer of a conjugated diene compound and an aromatic vinyl<br>
compound is preferably 50% or less, more preferably 30% or less, and still more<br>
preferably 20% or less. The degree of hydrogenation can be measured by using a<br>

porous inorganic material; a homogeneous catalyst such as a catalyst produced by<br>
reacting a solubilized salt of nickel, cobalt, or the like with organoaluminum or the like;<br>
a catalyst using a metallocene such as titanocene, and the like. Among these, a<br>
titanocene catalyst with which mild hydrogenation conditions can be selected is<br>
particularly preferable. Hydrogenation of aromatic groups is possible by using a noble<br>
metal-supported catalyst.<br>
[0045]<br>
Examples of catalysts may include (1) a support-type heterogeneous<br>
hydrogenation catalyst with a metal such as Ni, Pt, Pd, Ru, or the like supported on<br>
carbon, silica, alumina, diatomaceous earth, or the like; (2) a Ziegler-type<br>
hydrogenation catalyst using a transition metal salt such as an organic acid salt of Ni,<br>

organoaluminum; and (3) an organic metal complex such as an organometallic<br>
compound of Ti, Ru, Rh, Zr, or the like. Specific examples may include hydrogenation<br>

In another embodiment according to the present invention, a part of the modified<br>
conjugated diene polymer may be coupled with a polyfunctional modifying agent. The<br>
modified conjugated diene polymer obtained in this manner was found to have<br>
improved cold flow properties, in addition to the above-mentioned effects. In the case<br>
of the modified conjugated diene polymer obtained by coupling with the polyfunctional<br>
modifying agent, the above effects can be particularly exhibited when the amount of the<br>
modified conjugated diene polymer component which the low molecular weight<br>
compounds bond to the conjugated diene polymer is preferably from 5 to 100 wt%,<br>
more preferably from 20 to 90 wt%, and still more preferably from 50 to 90 wt% in the<br>
polymer, and the amount of the polymer component which the conjugated diene<br>
polymer react with the polyfunctional modifying agent is preferably from 1 to 50 wt%,<br>
and more preferably from 10 to 30 wt% in the polymer. The content of the modified<br>
component can be measured by chromatography capable of separation of the component<br>
into modified one and unmodified one. Examples of the chromatographic method may<br>
include a method of analyzing the modifying group by using a GPC column packed<br>
with a filler of a polar substance such as silica, which can adsorb the modifying group<br>
component and using an internal standard of a non-adsorbing component for<br>
comparison.<br>
[0090]<br><br>
Although the polystyrene-based weight average molecular weight of the<br>
modified conjugated diene polymer should be controlled according to the application or<br>
the object, a range of from 100,000 to 2,000,000 is preferable taking processability and<br>
properties into consideration. When the modified conjugated diene polymer is a<br>
non-oil-extended polymer, a more preferable polystyrene-based weight average<br>
molecular weight is from 200,000 to 1,000,000. The molecular weight distribution<br>
(Mw/Mn) is preferably from 1 to 3, and more preferably from 1.1 to 2.5. When the<br>
modified conjugated diene polymer is a non-oil-extended polymer, a more preferable<br>
molecular weight distribution is from 1.1 to 2.0<br>

polymer according to the present invention has preferably a vinyl bond (1, 2-bond<br>
and/or 3, 4-bond) content of from 10 to 90%. From the viewpoint of mechanical<br>
strength, abrasion resistance, and the like, a more preferable vinyl bond content is from<br>
20 to 70%. The vinyl bond content here is a proportion of the amount of vinyl bonds<br>
to the amount of the conjugated diene monomer components. Details of measuring<br>
methods are described in Examples.<br>
[0092]<br>
A process for producing the modified conjugated diene polymer is described<br>

[0093]<br>
The modified conjugated diene polymer produced by any processes can be used.<br>
Preferable examples may include a process comprising reacting a low molecular weight<br>

polymer is obtained; and when a polyfunctional organolithium compound is used as an<br>

[0098]<br>
Organoalkali metal compounds disclosed in USP 5,708,092, BP 2,241,239, and<br>
USP 5,527,753 can also be used.<br>
[0099]<br>
Particularly preferable compounds are n-butyllithium or sec-butyllithium.<br><br>

more.<br>

Examples of other organoalkali metal compounds may include organosodium<br>
compounds, organopotassium compounds, organorubidium compounds, organocesium<br>
compounds, and the like . Specific compounds may include sodium naphthalene and<br>

of lithium, sodium, and potassium, or the like can be used. Also, the organoalkali<br>
metal compounds may be used together with other organometallic compounds.<br>

These organoalkaline earth metal compounds may be used together with an<br>
organoalkali metal initiator or other organometallic compounds.<br>
[0103]<br>
The conjugated diene polymer which constitutes of a modified conjugated diene<br>
polymer can be obtained by polymerizing the above-mentioned conjugated diene<br>
compounds and aromatic vinyl compounds, using the above-mentioned alkali metal<br>
initiator and/or alkaline earth metal initiator. As the polymerization method, an<br>
anionic polymerization reaction is preferable; particularly a method of obtaining active<br>
terminals by a growth reaction by living anionic polymerization is preferable. The<br>
polymerization is preferably carried out by batch polymerization or a continuous<br>
polymerization system with in which one reactor or two or more reactors connected are<br><br>
used. Although either increasing temperature polymerization in which the temperature<br>
is increased during the polymerization or constant-temperature polymerization can be<br>
used, the polymerization temperature is preferably from -20 to 200째C, more preferably<br>
from 0 to 150째C, and still more preferably from 10 to 120째C.<br>
[0104]<br>
It is also possible to add a small amount of a polar compound in order to<br>
randomly copolymerize an aromatic vinyl compound and a conjugated diene compound,<br>
to control the microstructure of a conjugated diene unit, and to improve the rate of<br>
polymerization, and the like.<br>
[0105]<br>
Examples of the polar compound may include ethers such as tetrahydroforan,<br>

used either alone or in combination of two or more.<br>
[0106]<br>
The amount of the polar compound used may be appropriately selected<br>
according to the object and the degree of the effect. Generally, an amount of from 0.01<br>
to 100 mols based on one mol of the initiator is preferable. Many polar compounds<br>
have a randomization effect in the copolymerization of a conjugated diene compound<br>
and an aromatic vinyl compound, as well as the effect of controlling the microstructure<br>
of a conjugated diene unit, and can be used as a control reagent of distribution of an<br>
aromatic vinyl compound and a control reagent of the amount of styrene blocks. As<br><br>
the method for randomization, a method of intermittently adding a part of 1, 3-butadiene<br>
during copolymerization, disclosed in JP-A-59-140211, may be used.<br>
[0107]<br>
A preferable process for producing a modified conjugated diene polymer is a<br>
process which comprises reacting the active terminals of the conjugated diene polymer<br>
obtained above with a low molecular weight compound of the above-mentioned general<br>
formulas (5) to (8).<br>
[0108]<br>
It is preferable to use the low molecular weight compound in an amount of from<br>
0.1 to 5 times mol based on one mol of the active terminal of the conjugated diene<br>
polymer. When the amount of the low molecular weight compound is less than 0.1<br>
time mol, the vulcanized rubber made from the resulting modified conjugated diene<br>
polymer composition obtained by the present invention cannot have excellently<br>
balanced properties of low hysteresis loss properties, abrasion resistance, and tensile<br>
strength. When the amount of the low molecular weight compound is more than 5<br>
times mol, not only modification cost increases, but also problems in removing<br>
unreacted materials and the like occur. A more preferable amount is from 0.2 to 4<br>
times mol, with a still more preferable amount is from 0.2 to 3 times mol.<br>
In order to exhibit excellent effects of the present invention, the content of the<br>
modified conjugated diene polymer component in which the low molecular weight<br>
compounds bond to conjugated diene polymer is preferably from 5 to 100 wt%, more<br>
preferably from 20 to 90 wt%, and still more preferably from 50 to 90 wt% in the<br>
polymer. The content of the modified component can be measured by chromatography<br>
capable of separation of the component into modified one and unmodified one.<br>
Preferable examples of the chromatographic method may include a method of<br>
quantatively analyzing the modifying group by using a GPC column packed with a filler<br>
of a polar substance such as silica, which can adsorb the modifying group component,<br><br>
and using an internal standard of a non-adsorbing component for comparison.<br>
Either a method of adding the low molecular weight compound to the<br>
polymerization reactor after the end of polymerization or a method of adding the low<br>
molecular weight compound to a pipe which transfer the polymer solution or<br>
transferring another reactor after the end of polymerization can be employed. The<br>
reaction temperature of modifying the conjugated diene polymer is preferably from 0 to<br>
150째C, more preferably from 10 to 100째C, and still more preferably from 20 to 90째C.<br>
The low molecular weight compound is preferably reacted promptly after the end of the<br>
polymerization of the conjugated diene polymer.<br>
A coupling reaction may be carried out in the present invention using a<br>
polyfunctional modifying agent. Coupling the conjugated diene polymer or a part of<br>
the conjugated diene polymer with a polyfunctional modifying agent improves cold<br>
flow properties. There are no specific limitations to the order of reacting the<br>
polyfunctional modifying agent. A method of coupling a polyfunctional modifying<br>
agent with the conjugated diene polymer, followed by reacting the low molecular<br>
weight compounds with the remaining active terminals, a method of reacting the low<br>
molecular weight compound with the conjugated diene polymer, followed by coupling a<br>
polyfunctional modifying agent with the remaining active terminals, or a method of<br>
reacting both the low molecular weight compound and the polyfunctional modifying<br>
agent can be used. The method of coupling a polyfunctional modifying agent with the<br>
conjugated diene polymer, followed by reacting the low molecular weight compounds<br>
with the remaining active terminals is particularly preferable in order to produce a<br>
polymer having a modifying group-containing polymer at a high ratio.<br>

As a raw-material rubber for vulcanized rubbers, the Mooney viscosity is<br>
controlled to 20 to 100 according to the objective. When the Mooney viscosity is too<br>
high, the Mooney viscosity is adjusted in this range by extending the rubber with oil,<br>
taking ease of finishing operation in the production process into consideration and in<br>

[0125]<br>
A modified conjugated diene random copolymer which is one of preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention, will now be explained in detail.<br>
[0126]<br>
A living conjugated diene homopolymer or a living random copolymer of a<br>
conjugated diene and styrene is obtained by using a conjugated diene or a mixture of a<br>
conjugated diene and styrene as a monomer, and an organic monolithium compound as<br>
an initiator in an inert solvent. The conjugated diene polymer has preferably a glass<br>
transition temperature of from -100째C to 0째C and the conjugated diene unit has a ratio of<br>

styrene content in the conjugated diene polymer is preferably in a range of from 0 wt%<br>
to 50 wt%. The chain distribution of styrene in the copolymer preferably has a<br>
complete random structure. Namely, it is preferable that the amount of isolated styrene<br>

and the amount of chain styrene (a chain consisting of eight or more styrenes) be<br>

In order to improve the random property of the conjugated diene and styrene, it is<br>

polymerization. Examples of the method for reacting a low molecular weight<br>
compound and a polyfunctional modifying agent to the conjugated diene polymer may<br>
include a method of adding a low molecular weight compound having two or more<br>
tertiary amino groups and one or more alkoxysilyl groups to the polymer solution after<br>

modifying agent to independently react with active terminals of the conjugated diene<br>
polymer obtained by polymerizing the conjugated diene compound or copolymerizing<br>
the conjugated diene compound and the aromatic vinyl compound.<br>

A particularly preferable effect is obtained when synthetic silicic acid with a primary<br>
particle diameter of 50 nm or less is used as the silica-based inorganic filler. The fine<br><br>

The silica-based inorganic filler can also be suitably used as a reinforcing filler<br>
in the case where the modified conjugated diene polymer of the present invention is<br>
used for the application of a vulcanized rubber such as auto-parts (e.g. tires, damper),<br>
shoes, and the like. In this case, synthetic silicic acid with a primary particle diameter<br>
of 50 nm or less is preferable. Preferable examples of the synthetic silicic acid may<br>
include wet silica and dry silica.<br>
[0131]<br>
Also, carbon black may be used as the reinforcing filler. There are no<br>
particular limitations on the carbon black used. Examples of the carbon black may<br>
include furnace black, acetylene black, thermal black, channel black, graphite, and the<br>
like. Of these, furnace black is particularly preferable.<br>
[0132]<br>
The modified conjugated diene polymer according to the present invention can<br>
be used as a vulcanized rubber by adding from 1 to 150 parts by weight of a silica-based<br>
inorganic filler and from 1 to 150 parts by weight of carbon black, either alone or in<br>
combination, based on 100 parts by weight of the polymer. Such a vulcanized rubber<br>
particularly allows excellent dispersion of silica and stably exhibits excellent<br>
performance. This is one of the excellent effects of the present invention.<br>
Specifically, when producing the vulcanized rubber, the inorganic filler and carbon<br>
black are homogeneously dispersed to obtain a rubber composition with small<br>
strain-dependability of storage modulus of elasticity.<br>
[0133]<br>
The modified conjugated diene polymer according to the present invention is<br>
compounded alone or in combination with another rubber, as required. When used in<br><br>
combination with another rubber, the effect of the improvement of the present invention<br>
is not sufficiently exhibited, if the amount of the modified conjugated diene polymer<br>
according to the present invention is too small. As a rubber component, a weight ratio<br>
of the modified conjugated diene polymer according to the present invention and<br>
another rubber is generally from 10/90 to 95/5, preferably from 20/80 to 90/10, more<br>
preferably from 30/70 to 80/20. Examples of other rubber may include natural rubber,<br>
polyisoprene rubber, emulsion polymerized styrene-butadiene copolymer, solution<br>
polymerized random SBR (bonded styrene: from 5 to 50 wt%, 1,2-bond content in the<br>
butadiene unit: from 10 to 80 wt%), high-trans SBR (1,4-trans bond content in the<br>
butadiene unit :from 70 to 95 wt%), low-cis polybutadiene rubber, high-cis<br>
polybutadiene rubber, high-trans polybutadiene rubber (1,4-trans bond content in the<br>
butadiene unit: from 70 to 95 wt%), styrene-isoprene copolymer, butadiene-isoprene<br>
copolymer, solution polymerized random styrene-butadiene-isoprene copolymer,<br>
emulsion polymerized random styrene-butadiene-isoprene copolymer, emulsion<br>
polymerized styrene-acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer, acrylonitrile-butadiene<br>
copolymer, and block copolymers such as high vinyl SBR-low vinyl SBR block<br>
copolymer and polystyrene-polybutadiene-polystyrene block copolymer. These may<br>
be selected suitably according to the desired properties.<br>
[0134]<br>
A silane coupling agent may be compounded to the modified conjugated diene<br>
polymer composition according to the present invention. In order to strengthen the<br>
coupling effect (a mutual bonding effect) between the reinforcing silica filler and raw<br>
material rubber, an organic silane coupling agent is added preferably in an amount of<br>
from 0.1 to 20 wt% based on the amount of the silica-based filler. The addition of the<br>
organic silane coupling agent in the amount of this range can provide the coupling effect<br>
without ruining the reinforcing effect. A more preferable amount of the organic silane<br>
coupling agent is from 0.1 to 6 wt% based on the amount of the silica-based filler.<br><br>
[0135]<br>
The organic silane coupling agent possesses a group having affinity with the<br>
surface of silica and a group capable of bonding with double bonds in the polymer<br>
molecule. Examples of the organic silane coupling agent may include<br>
bis-[3-(triethoxysilyl)propyl)-tetrasulfide, bis-[3-(triethoxysilyl)-propyl)-disulfide,<br>
bis-[2-(triethoxysilyl)ethyl]-tetrasulfide, 3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane,<br>
3-triethoxysilylpropyl-N,N-dimethylthiocarbamoyl tetrasulfide,<br>
3-triethoxysilylpropylbenzothiazole tetrasulfide, and the like. Since the modified<br>
conjugated diene polymer having a specific modifying group according to the present<br>
invention exhibits a strong bonding force with the silica-based filler, it is possible to<br>
omit the addition of an organic silane coupling agent or to add smaller amount of the<br>
organic silane coupling agent as compared with the case where other polymers were<br>
used. In this case, it is possible to obtain a rubber composition with higher<br>
performance.<br>
[0136]<br>
Furthermore, rubber additives such as reinforcing filler, a vulcanizing agent, a<br>
vulcanization accelerator, a vulcanization assistant, oil, and the like can be used.<br>
[0137]<br>
Although not particularly limited, examples of the vulcanizing agent may<br>
include sulfurs such as powdered sulfur, precipitated sulfur, colloidal sulfur, insoluble<br>
sulfur, and highly dispersible sulfur; halogenated sulfurs such as sulfur monochloride<br>
and sulfur dichloride; and organic peroxides such as dicumyl peroxide and di-tert-butyl<br>
peroxide. Of these, sulfurs are preferable, with particularly preferable sulfur being<br>
powdered sulfur.<br>
[0138]<br>
The amount of the vulcanizing agent is generally from 0.1 to 15 parts by weight,<br>
preferably from 0.3 to 10 parts by weight, and still more preferably from 0.5 to 5 parts<br><br>
by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the rubber components.<br>
[0139]<br>
Examples of the vulcanization accelerator may include a sulfene-amide<br>
vulcanization accelerator, a thiourea vulcanization accelerator, a thiazole vulcanization<br>
accelerator, a dithiocarbamic acid vulcanization accelerator, a xanthogenic acid<br>
vulcanization accelerator, and the like. The amount of the vulcanization accelerator is<br>
generally from 0.1 to 15 parts by weight, preferably from 0.3 to 10 parts by weight, and<br>
still more preferably from 0.5 to 5 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the<br>
rubber components.<br>
[0140]<br>
Although there are no specific limitations on the type of the vulcanization<br>
assistant, stearic acid, zinc oxide, and the like can be used.<br>
[0141]<br>
The reinforcing filler may be compounded into an amount of from 1 to 150 parts<br>
by weight based on 100 parts by weight of rubber components, and the vulcanizing<br>
agent and vulcanization accelerator may be added in total in an amount of from 0.1 to<br>
20 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of rubber components, for example.<br>
[0142]<br>
Examples of the oil may include an extender oil such as aromatic extender oil,<br>
naphthenic extender oil, paraffmic extender oil, and a silicone extender oil according to<br>
applications. The amount of the extender oil is generally from 1 to 150 parts by<br>
weight, preferably from 2 to 100 parts by weight, and more preferably from 3 to 60<br>
parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the rubber components. When the<br>
amount of the oil used is in this range, the dispersing effect of the reinforcing filler,<br>
tensile strength, abrasion resistance, heat resistance, and the like are excellently<br>
balanced.<br>
[0143]<br><br>
In addition to the above-mentioned components, the vulcanized rubber<br>
composition, in which the modified conjugated diene polymer according to the present<br>
invention is used, may comprise, according to the conventional method, required<br>
amounts of other additives like a filler such as calcium carbonate and talc, an<br>
amine-based or phenol-based antioxidant, an antiozonant, an activator such as<br>
diethylene glycol, a processing aid, a tackifier, wax, and the like.<br>
[0144]<br>
The vulcanized rubber composition, in which the modified conjugated diene<br>
polymer according to the present invention is used, can be produced by mixing the<br>
above-mentioned components using the known rubber-kneading machine such as a roll<br>
or a Bumbury's mixer.<br>
[0145]<br>
A masterbatch can be prepared by compounding various additives such as a<br>
silica-based filler and carbon black, as required, to the modified conjugated diene<br>
polymer according to the present invention. A rubber composition with good<br>
processability, high strength, low rolling resistance, excellent wet skid performance, and<br>
excellent abrasion resistance can be obtained by producing the masterbatch.<br>
[0146]<br>
The modified conjugated diene polymer according to the present invention can<br>
cause reinforcing fillers such as silica and carbon black to be homogeneously dispersed<br>
therein. A vulcanized rubber made from the resulting composition, if used for tires,<br>
can exhibit excellently balanced properties in the low rolling resistance and the wet skid<br>
performance as compared with the conventional one. The tires also exhibit improved<br>
the abrasion resistance and the strength. The modified conjugated diene polymer can<br>
be suitably used as a damper and footwear, for example. In addition to these<br>
characteristics, the capability of homogeneously dispersing the fillers can contribute to<br>
improvement of flame retarding properties, tensile strength, transparency, and the like.<br><br>
Furthermore, the modified conjugated diene polymer according to the present<br>
invention exhibits excellent aggregate grip when used as an asphalt composition.<br>
When the modified conjugated diene polymer according to the present invention<br>
is a thermoplastic resin, that resin can finely disperse polar particles and exhibits<br>
excellent compatibility with the polar resin. Therefore, the modified conjugated diene<br>
polymer according to the present invention can improve impact resistance of<br>
engineering plastic such as polyamide.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
[0147]<br>
The invention is described below in detail by way of examples. However, the<br>
invention should not be construed as being limited to the following examples. In the<br>
examples below, the samples were analyzed by the following methods.<br>
(1)	Bonded styrene content<br>
The bonded styrene content (wt%) was determined by dissolving the sample in<br>
chloroform and measuring absorbance of a 254-nm UV light by phenyl groups of<br>
styrene ("UV-2450" manufactured by Shimazu Corporation).<br>
(2)	Styrene chains<br>
The contents of styrene single chain having one styrene unit and a styrene long<br>
chain having eight or more connected styrene units were analyzed by gel permeation<br>
chromatography (GPC) after decomposition of styrene-butadiene copolymer with ozone,<br>
according to the method of Tanaka et al. described in Polymer, 22, 1721 (1981) .<br>
(3)	Microstructure of butadiene unit<br>
Measured by infrared spectrum of from 600 to 1000 cm"1 using an infrared<br>
spectrophotometer ("FT-IR230" manufactured by JASCO Corporation). The sample<br>
was dissolved in carbon disulfide and solution cells were used. The resultant<br>
absorbance was applied to the Hampton's equation to determine the microstructure of<br><br>
the butadiene unit, i.e., the content of 1, 2-bond.<br>
(4)	Mooney viscosity<br>
The sample was pre-heated at 100째C for one minute and the viscosity after four<br>
minutes was measured according to JIS-K6300-1.<br>
(5)	Molecular weight and molecular weight distribution<br>
Chromatogram of the sample and standard polystyrene were measured using<br>
GPC equipped with three columns packed with polystyrene gel (TSKgel, manufactured<br>
by Tosoh Corporation). A calibration curve was produced from the measurement<br>
result of standard polystyrene, and the molecular weight and the molecular weight<br>
distribution of sample was calculated. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) was used as an eluent.<br>
10 mg of a sample was dissolved in 20 mL of THF and the solution (200 uL) was<br>
injected into a column. The molecular weight and molecular weight distribution were<br>
measured using a RI detector ("HLC-8020" manufactured by Tosoh Corporation) under<br>
the conditions of an oven temperature at 40째C and a THF flow rate of 1.0 mL/min.<br>
(6)	Modification ratio<br>
The modification rate was measured by GPC column packed with silica gel as<br>
the filler using the characteristics of the modified component of being adsorbed in silica.<br>
Chromatograms of sample solutions containing a sample and a low molecular weight<br>
internal standard polystyrene were measured using the polystyrene gel GPC<br>
("HLC-8020" manufactured by Tosoh Corporation) described in (5) and a silica column<br>
("Zorbax" manufactured by E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company) GPC (Column<br>
oven "CO-8020", detector "RI-8021" manufactured by Tosoh Corporation, oven<br>
temperature: 40째C, THF flow rate: 0.5 mL/min). The adsorption amount to the silica<br>
column was determined from the difference of these measurements, based on which<br>
results the modification ratio was determined. 10 mg of a sample and a 5 mg of<br>
standard polystyrene were dissolved in 20 mL of THF, and 200 uL of the solution was<br>
injected into a column. The specific procedure was followed. The modification ratio<br><br><br>
(%) was determined using the formula, [1 - (P2 x P3)/(P1 x P4)] x 100, wherein the<br>
entire peak area of the chromatogram using a polystyrene column is assumed to be 100,<br>
P1 represents the peak area of the sample, P2 represents the peak area of the standard<br>
polystyrene, the entire peak area of the chromatogram using a silica column is assumed<br>
to be 100, P3 represents the area of the sample, and P4 represents the peak area of the<br>
standard polystyrene, provided that P1 + P2 = P3 + P4 = 100<br>
(7) Cold flow property<br>
The sample was cut into a 3 cm x 3 cm x 8 cm rectangular parallelepiped and a<br>
3 cm x 3 cm plane was secured to a table with an inclination of 30째 using a rubber<br>
cement The cold flow property was evaluated by observing the sample after being<br>
allowed to stand at 25째C for one hour. The results were evaluated as follows.<br>
[0148]<br>
Excellent: The sample maintained nearly the original form.<br>
Good: A part of sample was deformed.<br>
Bad: The sample was considerably deformed.<br>

Kneading was carried out by the following method according to JIS K6299.<br>
[0159]<br>
In first-stage kneading, a raw material rubber, fillers (silica and carbon black), an<br>
organosilane coupling agent, oil, zinc oxide, and stearic acid were kneaded under the<br>
conditions of a filling rate of 65% and a rotor rotation of 50/57 rpm, using a sealed<br>
kneader (internal volume: 0.3 L) equipped with a temperature controller. The<br>
temperature of sealed kneader was adjusted to obtain a composition at a discharge<br>
temperature of from 155 to 160째C. As second-stage kneading, an antioxidant was<br>
added to the composition obtained in the first stage and the mixture was again kneaded<br>
in order to improve dispersion of silica. The discharge temperature of the composition<br>
was also adjusted to from 155 to 160째C by controlling the temperature of the sealed<br>
kneader. Sulfur and a vulcanization accelerator were added to the composition<br>
obtained by the second-stage kneading, and the mixture was kneaded in an open roll of<br>
which the temperature was set at 70째C (third-stage kneading).<br><br><br>
[0160]<br>
The composition obtained in the third-stage kneading was molded and<br>
vulcanized at 160째C for a period of T90 plus 5 minutes. Properties of the resulting<br>
vulcanized rubber were measured according to the following methods.<br>
(1)T90<br>
After completion of the second-stage kneading, a vulcanization time required for<br>
vulcanizing 90% of the rubber (T90) was measured according to JIS K6300-1.<br>
(2)	bound rubber content<br>
About 0.2 g of the composition after the second-stage kneading was cut into<br>
about 1 mm cubes and placed in a Harris's basket (made of 100 mesh wire gauze) to<br>
measure the weight. The cubes were dipped in toluene for 24 hours and dried, and its<br>
weight was measured. From the amount of insoluble components in toluene, the<br>
amount of rubber bonded with the filler was calculated. The resulting value was<br>
regarded as the bound rubber content.<br>
(3)	Tensile test<br>
The tensile strength at the time of cutting a test specimen and the tensile stress at<br>
the time of 300% elongation (300% modulus) were measured according to JIS K6251.<br>
(4)	Viscoelasticity<br>
ARES viscoelasticity tester manufactured by Rheometric Scientific Co. was<br>
used. Tan 5 and modulus of elasticity (G') were measured in a torsion mode at a<br>
frequency of 10 Hz, while changing the strain at each measuring temperature (0째C and<br>
50째C).<br>
[0161]<br>
The Payne effect (AG') was shown by the difference between the maximum<br>
value and minimum value in the strain of from 0.1% to 10%. The smaller the Payne<br>
effect, the better the dispersibility of fillers such as silica.<br>
[0162]<br><br>
The higher tan 5 at the low-temperature (0째C), the better the wet skid (grip)<br>
performance. The lower tan 8 at the high-temperature (50째C), the smaller the<br>
hysteresis loss and the smaller the rolling resistance of tires, that is, the lower the fuel<br>
consumption.<br>
(5)	Rebound resilience<br>
The rebound resilience at 50째C was measured by the Lupke type rebound<br>
resilience tester according to JIS K6255.<br>
(6)	Heat build-up<br>
A Goodrich flexometer was used to measure the heat build-up at a rotation of<br>
1,800 rpm, a stroke of 0.225 inches, and a load of 55 pounds. The heat build-up was<br>
indicated by the difference of the temperature at the start (50째C) and the temperature<br>
after 20 minutes.<br>
(7)	Abrasion resistance<br>
An Akron abrasion tester was used to measure the amount of abrasion at a load<br>
of 6 pounds and a rotation of 3,000 rpm. The higher the index, the better the abrasion<br>
resistance.<br>
[0163]<br>

Comparative Examples 3 to 4 (Samples F and G) are shown in Table 2.<br><br><br>
