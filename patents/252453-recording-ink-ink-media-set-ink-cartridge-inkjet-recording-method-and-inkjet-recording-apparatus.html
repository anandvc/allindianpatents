RECORDING INK, INK/MEDIA SET, INK CARTRIDGE, INKJET<br>
RECORDING METHOD AND INKJET RECORDING APPARATUS<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a recording ink and an ink/media set<br>
which are suitable for inkjet recording, as well as an ink cartridge, an<br>
inkjet recording method and an inkjet recording apparatus which use the<br>
recording ink and the ink/media set.<br>
Background Art<br>
Inkjet recording apparatuses are known as a type of image recording<br>
apparatuses used in, for example, printers, facsimile machines and<br>
photocopiers. Such inkjet recording apparatus records images by<br>
ejecting ink on a recording medium. Because of its uncomplicated image<br>
forming process, the inkjet recording apparatus itself can be easily<br>
simplified. Moreover, the image forming process of the inkjet recording<br>
apparatus dose not require heating the recording medium, and thus it can<br>
save energy consumption, and thus it is desirable for the environment.<br>
It also has many advantages such as capability of quick recording of<br>
high-resolution images, low running cost, low noise level and capability of<br>
using a variety of color inks for recording images having a wide color<br>
gamut.<br>
Commonly used inks for the inkjet recording apparatus are<br>
water-based inks containing a colorant, wetting agents such as glycerine,<br><br>
penetrating agents for controlling permeability of ink to recording paper,<br>
surfactants and other additives.<br>
In the inkjet recording method, images are recorded on a recording<br>
medium from such liquid water-based ink absorbed on the recording<br>
medium. For this mechanism of forming images, variety of inkjet paper<br>
having better ink absorbency and capability of fixing and protecting<br>
coloring components has been developed. In terms of cost, however, as<br>
inkjet paper is produced by applying multiple coatings on a paper base,<br>
its production cost is high. And further, due to the large amount of<br>
chemical agents contained inkjet paper, it has a poor recyclability<br>
compared with regular paper. Thus, inkjet inks that can record high<br>
quality images not only on inkjet paper but also on regular paper have<br>
been desired.<br>
The obstacle to forming high quality images on regular paper is that<br>
is has a poorer ink absorbency than inkjet paper and it dose not provide<br>
surface coatings suitable to accept inkjet ink. Thus, it is important to<br>
solve the following problems to achieve high quality images on regular<br>
paper, the problems include (1) occurrence of feathering (2) occurrence of<br>
bleeding (3) reduction in image density (4) degradation of color gamut (5)<br>
degradation of water resistance (6) degradation of light resistance (7)<br>
degradation of gas resistance (8) degradation of ink fixation characteristic,<br>
and (9) passing through to the other side of a recording medium.<br>
In recent years, pigments having better dispersibility and smaller<br>
particle diameters have been developed, and such pigments have been<br><br>
started to be used in many inkjet inks. In addition to conventional<br>
approaches (including adding surfactants and/or water-soluble resins) to<br>
improve the dispersibility of pigments, methods of surface modification,<br>
including oxidation treatment on the surface of pigment particles,<br>
sulfonation treatment and graft polymerization, have been tried for<br>
obtaining hydrophilicity in the pigments to thereby improve dispersion<br>
stability thereof. Such pigments can solve (5), (6) and (7) of the above<br>
mentioned problems, however, there still exist problems in reliability of<br>
inks using the pigments that, because of poor density and color gamut of<br>
the pigments compared with dyes, the inks have poorer ejection stability,<br>
long term storage stability and redispersability than inks using dyes.<br>
Thus, the reliability, density and color gamut of the inks using the<br>
pigments have been important problems to be solved. In order to solve<br>
those problems, many techniques using colored polymer particles,<br>
particularly using emulsioned particles of a polyester or vinyl polymer in<br>
inks for inkjet recording have been proposed. Examples of such inks<br>
include those disclosed in Patent Literature 1 and non-Patent Literature<br>
1. Examples of such inks further include those containing dispersed<br>
compositions of a water-insoluble resin which internally contains a<br>
colorant. In addition, it is commonly known that conventional inks<br>
using organic pigments as colorants can provide better image density and<br>
better color reproducibility on regular paper than conventional pigment<br>
inks using water-soluble dispersants.<br>
Conventionally, techniques to obtain suitable permeability to paper<br><br>
in inks have been studied to thereby prevent ink from causing feathering<br>
and bleeding and from passing through to the other side of a recording<br>
medium, and to improve image density and color gamut. For example, a<br>
commercial available ink for inkjet recording has a surface tension of<br>
lower than 35 mN/m, and thereby the ink has a high permeability to<br>
paper. Such high permeable inks can effectively prevent the occurrences<br>
of bleeding and have a good drying characteristic on regular paper.<br>
However, the inks tend to cause feathering and record images with<br>
insufficient density and images/characters with vagueness.<br>
On the other hand, some commercial available inks have a surface<br>
tension of higher than 35 mN/m, and thereby the inks have a slow<br>
permeability to paper. Such slow permeable ink slowly permeates into<br>
paper to enable it to be accumulated on the surface area of paper. Thus,<br>
it can effectively prevent the occurrence of feathering, improve image<br>
density and color gamut and prevent it from passing through to the other<br>
side of paper. The disadvantages of such low permeable ink are that,<br>
because of its low permeability, the drying characteristic drastically<br>
degrades on regular paper, and it results in degradation of ink fixation<br>
characteristics and causing bleeding on multi-colored images.<br>
Thus, an ink-set which combines a low permeable ink with a high<br>
permeable ink has been studied. Such technique can prevent inter-color<br>
bleeding, and thus it enables to record high quality images. However,<br>
when such ink is used in two-sided printing, it brings low productivity<br>
because it requires a long drying time. Thus, some commercial available<br><br>
recording apparatuses are equipped with a heater to reduce the drying<br>
time of ink. In such apparatuses, paper is heated with the heater before<br>
and after ink is placed thereon. Examples of such apparatuses include<br>
the one disclosed in Patent Literature 2. Such disclosed apparatus,<br>
however, tends to be large and complicated as it contains a heater. And<br>
further, it consumes great amount of energy for heating paper. Thus, the<br>
apparatus has no advantages which an inkjet recording apparatus<br>
supposed to have.<br>
In addition to the above-stated inks for inkjet recording, many<br>
attempts have been made to develop inks which not only have reliability<br>
and but also can record high quality images. For example, many inks<br>
having as low a viscosity as possible have been developed to prevent them<br>
from blocking the nozzles of the inkjet head. Patent Literature 3<br>
proposes an ink that prevents the aggregation of pigment particles in<br>
order to prevent the ink from being spread, and can further prevent it<br>
from causing the generation fo blank spots in images. Patent Literature<br>
3 suggests such ink can be obtained by adjusting the change in its<br>
viscosity within 10 times higher than initial viscosity and particle<br>
diameters within 3 times larger than initial diameters when the ink is<br>
concentrated 2 times. With this technique, however, it is difficult to<br>
record high quality images on regular paper with the proposed ink.<br>
In the ink disclosed in Patent Literature 4, the remnant of the ink<br>
after its volatile compositions has evaporated is liquid, and the viscosity<br>
of the ink in that state is within 10 times higher than the initial viscosity.<br><br>
The disclosed ink has an excellent reliability, while the ink itself is a dye<br>
ink which is disadvantageous in terms of image quality compared with a<br>
pigment ink.<br>
Patent Literature 5 discloses an ink whose viscosity increases within<br>
600 times after water evaporates therefrom under 60 °C. The disclosed<br>
ink balances its durability with both reliability and image quality of the<br>
ink by adding a water-soluble polymer, while the ink itself is also a dye<br>
ink, and thus has a poor water resistance.<br>
Patent Literature 6 suggests that an ink that can record high quality<br>
images requires its viscosity be adjusted in the range of from 5 mPa.s to<br>
15 mPa.s. The disclosed technique suggests adjusting the initial<br>
evaporation rate of the ink to improve its reliability, and further suggests<br>
adding a certain sort of compounds as viscosity adjusters to obtain a<br>
desired viscosity in the ink. The disclosed technique thus can solve (3)<br>
and (4) of the above-stated problems. The problem of the disclosed<br>
technique is that the uniformity in the particle diameter of the used<br>
pigment is not taken into consideration. Thus, although it states that<br>
the ink has an excellent reliability after left 24 hours, the ink may not be<br>
reliable enough after left longer period of time, depending on the<br>
configuration of a head and the diameter of nozzles for ejecting ink drops.<br>
As described above, although it is necessary that inks have a high<br>
viscosity for rapidly forming high quality images, it is difficult to obtain<br>
reliability on such high viscosity inks.<br>
Patent Literatures 7 and 8 each propose adding a water-insoluble<br><br>
resin into a pigment ink to achieve better image quality. Patent<br>
Literature 9 proposes an ink that can improve the quality of images<br>
formed on regular paper. The disclosed ink has the ratio of a pigment to<br>
a resin emulsion in the range of 1-0.1 to 1-1 and an average diameter of a<br>
coloring component in the range of 0.3 urn to 1.2 µm. Such inks<br>
containing the resin emulsion can prevent the occurrences of bleeding and<br>
feathering, while it cannot provide a sufficient image density and<br>
reliability as an ink for inkjet recording.<br>
Patent Literature 10 proposes an ink containing a water insoluble<br>
resin and having its minimum film formation temperature at 40 °C or<br>
higher. Patent Literature 11 proposes an ink having an emulsion<br>
diameter of 50 nm or smaller. In those proposed techniques, however,<br>
the reliability and image quality are still insufficient and yet to be<br>
improved.<br>
Patent Literature 12 discloses an ink containing a pigment,<br>
saccharides or derivatives thereof, a polyol having 5 or more hydroxyl<br>
groups and a resin emulsion. It states that the ink can record clearer<br>
images/characters. But the ink has a low permeability to regular paper,<br>
and thus has problems in, for example, preventing inter-color feathering,<br>
bleeding and degradation in ink fixation characteristic and ink drying<br>
time.<br>
Patent Literature 13 proposes an ink having solid contents of a water<br>
dispersible resin and a selfdispersible pigment in the range of 1.0 % by<br>
mass to 16 % by mass. It states that the ink can provide better image<br><br>
quality on regular paper. Although the disclosed ink can provide better<br>
water resistance than dye inks, its water resistance is still insufficient to<br>
be used with maker pens which are commonly used on regular paper.<br>
Adding a dispersed pigment and a resin emulsion into inks increases<br>
the solid content thereof and thus increases the viscosity of the ink. This<br>
method to increase ink viscosity has been studied as a means to improve<br>
characteristics of ink. Patent Literatures 12 and 14 propose inks in<br>
which resin forming micelle-aggregate is added to increase the solid<br>
content thereof, while changes in the change in the viscosity of the inks is<br>
kept at a small increase. The proposed inks still have an insufficient<br>
permeability to regular paper, and thus the quality of images recorded<br>
with the ink is still to be improved. The permeability to paper is<br>
explained by capillarity represented by Lucas-Washburn equation.<br>
Higher viscosity of an ink requires the ink have a lower surface tension<br>
and the contact angle of ink drops to paper be arranged in order to obtain<br>
sufficient permeability of the ink.<br>
Patent Literatures 15 and 16 propose using polyalcohol alkylether in<br>
an ink with a high solid content to increase its permeability. In the<br>
proposed inks, however, the viscosity increases accompanied by increase<br>
in the solid content, and thus sufficient permeability may not be obtained<br>
in the inks, resulting in the degradation of image quality.<br>
That even small amounts of silicone surfactants and/or fluorinated<br>
surfactants can increase the permeability of an ink is known, and many<br>
attempts have been made to apply this means. For example, Patent<br><br>
Literatures 17 and 18 each propose an inkjet ink containing a fluorinated<br>
surfactant. And further, Patent Literatures 19 and 20 each propose an<br>
ink having a dispersed pigment and a fluorinated surfactant. Patent<br>
Literature 21 proposes an ink which contains a fluorinated surfactant<br>
and polymer particulates containing either a water-insoluble and/or<br>
hardly-soluble coloring material, and has polymer emulsion and a<br>
viscosity of 5 mPa.s or more.<br>
However, color phase changes with increase of the content of the<br>
solidified pigments in those proposed inks. Thus a high concentration<br>
pigment will not provide desirable color phase, while a self-dispersible<br>
pigment will not provide sufficient water resistance and ink fixation<br>
characteristic.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
(Recording Ink)<br>
The recording ink of the present invention contains at least a<br>
water-dispersible colorant, a water-dispersible resin, a wetting agent, a<br>
surfactant, water and a penetrating agent, and it further contains other<br>
components in accordance with necessity.<br>
In the present invention, the water-dispersible resin contains<br>
fluorine resin particulates, and the ratio A:B, where A is the solid content<br>
in the recording ink and B is the solid content of a pigment contained in<br>
the water-dispersible colorant in the recording ink, is in the range of 0.5<br>
to 8, and preferably is in the range of 2 to 6. When the ratio is in the<br>
ranges, the ink fixation characteristic and color gamut are improved.<br>
The solid content of the water-dispersible resin is preferably 3, 4 or more<br>
times higher than that of the pigment for improving the color gamut and<br>
the image density, while it is preferably within 8 times higher as the<br>
marginal improvements in the color gamut and image density diminish<br>
over the range. And when the ratio, A/B, is less than 0.5, ink fixation<br>
characteristic may be degraded in the image portions and/or ink may pass<br>
through to the other side of paper.<br>
The total content of the water-dispersible colorant and<br>
water-dispersible resin to the total mass of the recording ink is preferably<br>
in the range of from 12 % by mass to 40 % by mass, and more preferably<br><br>
in the range of from 15 % by mass to 35 % by mass. When the total<br>
content is in those ranges, the ink can record clear images/characters.<br>
When the total content is less than 12 % by mass, drying characteristics<br>
of the ink may be degraded on paper, and further, clear images/characters<br>
may not be recorded on regular paper. And when it is more than 40 % by<br>
mass, the ink may easily block the nozzles, causing ejection failures.<br>
Extracting only the colorant and waterdispersible resin from the ink<br>
is an example of means to measure the solid contents of the<br>
water-dispersible colorant, the pigment of the waterdispersible colorant<br>
and the water-dispersible resin. And when a pigment is used as the<br>
colorant, the proportion of the colorant and waterdispersible resin can be<br>
determined based on the mass reduction rate obtained by a thermal mass<br>
analysis. When the colorant is, for example, a pigment or a dye, and its<br>
molecular structure is known, the solid content of the colorant can be<br>
determined by the nuclear magnetic resonance analysis, or NMR. When<br>
the colorant is, for example, an inorganic pigment contained in heavy<br>
metal atom/molecular frame, a metal-containing organic pigment or a<br>
metalcontaining dye, and its molecular structure is known, the solid<br>
content of the colorant can be determined by the X-ray fluorescence<br>
analysis, or XRF.<br><water-dispersible colorant><br>
The waterdispersible colorant in the first structure is a pigment that<br>
has at least a hydrophilic group on its surface and shows<br>
water-dispersibility under the existence of no dispersant. Thus, the<br><br>
pigment may be hereinafter called self-dispersible pigment.<br>
The water-dispersible colorant in the second structure is a polymer<br>
emulsion composed of polymer particulates containing a water-insoluble<br>
and/or hardly-soluble colorant.<br>
The water-dispersible colorant in the third structure is a dispersed<br>
pigment containing a pigment, a pigment dispersant and a polymer<br>
dispersion stabilizer, wherein the polymer dispersion stabilizer is at least<br>
any one of selected from an alpha-olefin/maleic anhydride copolymer<br>
represented by the following structural formula 1, styrene(meta)acryl<br>
copolymer, water-soluble polyurethane resin and water-soluble polyester<br>
resin.<br><br>
Where R represents an alkyl group, and n represents an integer of 30 to<br>
100.<br>
- Pigment -<br>
As the above-stated pigment, organic pigments and inorganic<br>
pigments can be used. A dye can also be used as a pigment for adjusting<br>
color tones, while the content of the dye should be limited within a range<br>
in which durability of the ink will not degraded.<br>
Examples of the inorganic pigments include titanium oxides, iron<br>
oxides, calcium carbonates, barium sulfates, aluminium hydroxides,<br><br>
barium yellow, cadmium red, chromium yellow and carbon blacks.<br>
Among those organic pigments, the carbon black is preferable.<br>
Examples of the carbon black include those produced by known methods<br>
such as a contact method, a furnace method or a thermal method.<br>
Examples of the organic pigments include azo pigments, polycyclic<br>
pigments, dye chelates, nitro pigments, nitroso pigments and aniline<br>
blacks. Among those organic pigments, the azo pigments and polycyclic<br>
pigments are preferable. Examples of the azo pigments include azo<br>
lakes, insoluble azo pigments, condensed azo pigments and chelate azo<br>
pigments. Examples of the polycyclic pigments include phthalocyanine<br>
pigments, perylene pigments, perinone pigments, anthraquinone<br>
pigments, quinacridone pigments, dioxadine pigments, indigoid pigments,<br>
thioindigoid pigments, isoindolinone pigments and quinophtalone<br>
pigments. Examples of the dye chelates include basic dye chelates and<br>
acidic dye chelates.<br>
The color of the colorant is not particularly limited and can be<br>
appropriately selected depending on the purpose. Examples thereof<br>
include colorants used for an achromatic color and for variety of other<br>
colors. These may be used alone or in combination.<br>
Examples of colorants used for an achromatic color include carbon<br>
blacks (C.I. pigment black 7) such as furnace blacks, lamp blacks,<br>
acetylene blacks and channel blacks; metals such as copper, iron (C.I.<br>
pigment black 11) and titanium oxide; and organic pigments such as<br>
aniline black (C.I. pigment black 1).<br><br>
Examples of colorants used for colors include C.I. pigment yellow 1, 3,<br>
12, 13, 14, 17, 24, 34, 35, 37, 42 (yellow iron oxide), 53, 55, 74, 81, 83, 95,<br>
97, 98, 100, 101, 104, 408, 109, 110, 117, 120, 128, 138, 150, 151, 153 and<br>
183; C.I. pigment orange 5, 13, 16, 17, 36, 43, and 51, C. I. pigment red 1,<br>
2, 3, 5, 17, 22, 23, 31, 38, 48:2 and 48:2 (permanent red 2B (Ca)), 48:3,<br>
48:4, 49:1, 52:2, 53:1, 57:1 (brilliant carmin 6B), 60:1, 63:1, 63:2, 64:1, 81,<br>
83, 88, 101 (iron oxide red), 104, 105, 106, 108 (cadmium red), 112, 114,<br>
122 (quinacridone magenta), 123, 146, 149, 166, 168, 170, 172, 177, 178,<br>
179, 185, 190, 193, 209 and 219; C.I. pigment violet 1 (rhodamine lake), 3,<br>
5:1, 16, 19, 23, and 38, C.I. pigment blue 1, 2, 15 (copper phthalocyanine<br>
blue), 15:1, 15:2, 15:3 (copper phthalocyanine blue), 16, 17:1, 56, 60, the<br>
63; and C.I. pigment green 1, 4, 7, 8, 10, 17, 18, and 36.<br>
The self-dispersible pigment in the first structure is a<br>
surface-modified pigment to whose surface at least a hydrophilic group is<br>
bound either directly or through another atom group. The surface is<br>
modified by chemically binding a functional group (such as sulfone groups<br>
or carboxyl groups) to the surface of the pigment or by a wet-oxidation<br>
treatment using at least one of a hypohalous acid and a salt thereof. Of<br>
pigments obtained by those methods, a water-dispersed pigment to whose<br>
surface a carboxyl group is bound is particularly preferable. Such<br>
surface-modified pigments to which the carboxyl group is bound not only<br>
can improve the dispersion stability but also enable to record high quality<br>
and clear images/characters and provide a recording medium after<br>
printed with better water resistance.<br><br>
An ink using the pigments is excellent in redispersibility after drying.<br>
Thus, the ink will not block inkjet nozzles of an inkjet head even when the<br>
ink is kept in an inkjet recording apparatus without being used for a long<br>
time and water evaporates from ink existing around the nozzles. That is<br>
to say, simply cleaning will be enough for maintaining the ability of the<br>
inkjet head to record high quality images.<br>
The volume average particle diameter (D50) of the self-dispersible<br>
pigment in the ink is preferably in the range of from 0.01 urn to 0.16 µm .<br>
For example, self-dispersible carbon blacks having ionic property and<br>
charged anionically or cationically are preferably used.<br>
Examples of anionic hydrophilic group include -COOM, -SO3M,<br>
-PO3HM, -PO3M2, -SO2NH2 and -SO2NHCOR (where M represents a<br>
hydrogen atom, an alkali metal, an ammonium or an organic ammonium).<br>
In the formulas, R represents an alkyl group having 1 to 12 carbon atoms,<br>
a phenyl group which may have substituents, or a naphthyl group which<br>
may have substituents. With those groups, it is preferable to use color<br>
pigments to whose surface -COOM or -SO3M is bound.<br>
In the above-stated hydrophilic groups, M may be an alkali metal<br>
such as lithium, sodium or potassium. It may be an organic ammonium<br>
such as mono- and/or trimethyl ammonium, mono- and/or tri-ethyl<br>
ammonium or mono- and/or trrmethanol ammonium. The methods of<br>
obtaining the color pigment anionically charged include introducing<br>
-COONa onto the surface of the color pigment. Means to introduce<br>
-COONa include oxidation-treatment with sodium hypochlorite,<br><br>
sulfonation and reacting diazonium salt.<br>
As the cationic hydrophilic group, quaternary ammonium groups are<br>
preferable. The quaternary ammonium groups shown below are more<br>
preferable, and in the present invention, any one of the quaternary<br>
ammonium groups whose surface is bound to the surface of a carbon black<br>
is preferably used as a coloring material.<br><br>
The methods of producing the cationic selfdispersible carbon<br>
blacks to which the hydrophilic group is bound are not particularly<br>
limited, and can be appropriately selected depending on the purpose.<br><br>
Examples thereof include treating the carbon black with<br>
3-anuno-Nethylpyridium bromide as a means for binding N-ethylpyridyl<br>
group represented by the following structural formula.<br><br>
The hydrophilic group may be bound to the surface of the carbon<br>
black through another atomic group. Examples of the other atomic<br>
group include alkyl groups having 1 to 12 carbon atoms, phenyl groups<br>
which may have a substituent and naphthyl groups which may have a<br>
substituent. Specific examples of the hydrophilic group bound to the<br>
carbon black surface through the other atomic group include -C2H4COOM<br>
(where M represents an alkali metal or quaternary ammonium),<br>
-PhSO3M (where Ph represent a phenyl group, M represents an alkali<br>
metal or quaternary ammonium), and -C5H10NH3+.<br>
The waterdispersible colorant in the second structure can be, in<br>
addition to the above-stated pigments, a polymer emulsion composed of<br>
polymer participates containing a pigment. The polymer emulsion is a<br>
polymer participate in which a pigment is enclosed and/or a polymer<br>
particulate to whose surface a pigment is adhered. In such case, not all<br>
the pigment is necessarily enclosed and/or adhered, and the pigment may<br>
be dispersed in the emulsion within a certain amount in which the effect<br>
of the present invention will not be spoiled. The polymers for forming<br>
the polymer emulsion include vinyl polymers, polyester polymers and<br>
polyurethane based polymers. The polymers particularly preferably<br><br>
used are vinyl polymers and polyester polymers. Those polymers are<br>
disclosed in, for example, JP-A No. 200053897 and JPA No.<br>
2001139849.<br>
A complex pigment composed of particles of a known<br>
organic/inorganic pigment and covered with an organic pigment or carbon<br>
black can be preferably used. Such complex pigments can be obtained by,<br>
for example, extracting an organic pigment under the existence of<br>
particles of an inorganic pigment or by a mechanochemical method in<br>
which inorganic pigment and organic pigment are mechanically<br>
mixed/pulverized. Upon necessity, a layer of organosilane compound<br>
composed of polysiloxane or alkylsilane can be provided in between a<br>
layer of an inorganic pigment and a layer of organic pigment to enhance<br>
the binding of the two layers.<br>
Examples of the organic pigment include black pigments such as<br>
aniline black; and collar pigments such as anthraquinones,<br>
phthalocyanine blues, phthalocyanine greens, diazos, monoazos,<br>
pyranetrons, perylenes, heterocyclic yellows, quinacridones and<br>
(thio)indigoides. Among those, pigments of carbon blacks,<br>
phthalocyanines, quinacridones, monoazo yellows, disazo yellows and<br>
heterocyclic yellows are particularly preferable in terms of color gamut.<br>
Representative examples of the phthalocyanine blues include copper<br>
phthalocyanine blue and derivatives thereof (C.I. pigment blue 15:3, 15:4)<br>
and aluminum phthalocyanine. Examples of the quinacridones include<br>
C. I. pigment orange 48; C. I. pigment orange 49; C. I. pigment red 122; C.<br><br>
I. pigment red 192; C. I. pigment red 202; C. I. pigment red 206; C. I.<br>
pigment red 207; C. I. pigment red 209; C. I. pigment violet 19; and C. I.<br>
pigment violet 42. Representative examples of the monoazo yellows<br>
include C. I. pigment yellow 74, C. I. pigment yellow 109, C. I. pigment<br>
yellow 128 and C. I. pigment yellow 151. Representative examples of the<br>
disazo yellows include C. I. pigment yellow 14, C. I. pigment yellow 16,<br>
and C. I. pigment yellow 17. Representative examples of the heterocyclic<br>
yellows include C. I. pigment yellow 117 and C. I. pigment yellow 138.<br>
Other appropriate pigment can be found in The Color Index, the third<br>
edition (published by the Society of Dyers and Colorists, 1982).<br>
Examples of the inorganic pigments include titanic dioxides, silicas,<br>
aluminas, iron oxides, iron hydroxides and tin oxides. In terms of the<br>
shape of those particles, smaller aspect ratio is more preferred, and the<br>
particles are most preferably spherical. When a coloring material is<br>
adhered to the surface, the color of the inorganic pigment is preferably<br>
transparent or white. When a black colorant is adhered to the surface, a<br>
black inorganic pigment may be used. The primary particle diameter of<br>
the particles of the inorganic pigment is preferably 100 nm or smaller,<br>
and more preferably in the range of 5 nm to 50 nm.<br>
The mass ratio of the particles of the inorganic pigment and either<br>
the organic pigment (or a colorant) or a carbon black as a coloring<br>
material is preferably in the range of 3:1 to 1:3, and more preferably in<br>
the range of 3:2 to 1:2. When the amount of the coloring material is<br>
insufficient, the color gamut and coloring ability may be degraded. And<br><br>
when an excessive amount of the colorant is contained, the clarity and<br>
color tones may be degraded.<br>
Examples of such particles of inorganic pigment as a coloring<br>
material, covered with an organic pigment or carbon black, include<br>
silica/carbon black complex material, silica/phthalocyanine PB (15:3)<br>
complex material, silica/disazo yellow complex material and<br>
silica/quinacridone PR122 complex material (all manufactured by Toda<br>
Kogyo Corporation). They are preferable because of their small average<br>
primary diameter.<br>
When a particle of an inorganic pigment, having a primary particle<br>
diameter of 20 nm, is covered with an organic compound whose amount is<br>
equal to the particle, the resulted pigment particle will have a primary<br>
particle diameter of around 25 nm can be obtained. By using an<br>
appropriate dispersant to disperse the particles with the primary<br>
diameter, a fine pigment-dispersed ink composed of dispersed particles<br>
having a diameter of 25 nm. In such complex pigment, not only the<br>
organic pigment provided on the surface but also the inorganic pigment<br>
covered with the thin organic layer having thickness of around 2.5 nm<br>
affects the dispersed state. Thus, it is important to select a pigment<br>
dispersant that can stably disperse both the organic and inorganic<br>
pigments at the same time.<br>
The waterdispersible colorant in the third structure is a dispersed<br>
pigment which contains the inorganic pigment, organic pigment, complex<br>
pigment, pigment dispersant and polymer dispersion stabilizer, wherein<br><br>
the polymer dispersion stabilizer is preferably any one selected from an<br>
alphaolefin/maleic anhydride represented by the following structural<br>
formula 1, styrene(meta)acryl copolymer, water-soluble polyurethane<br>
resin and water-soluble polyester resin.<br><br>
Where R represents an alkyl group, and n represents an integer of 30<br>
to 100. The alkyl group preferably has 6 to 25 carbon atoms, and more<br>
preferably has 6 to 22 carbon atoms.<br>
The polymer dispersion stabilizer is an effective means to stably<br>
maintain the dispersed condition of the pigment uniformly dispersed in<br>
water with the pigment dispersant. The alphaolefin/maleic anhydride,<br>
styrene-(meta)acryl copolymer, water-soluble polyurethane resin and<br>
watersoluble polyester resin represented by the structural formula 1 is<br>
solid under room temperature and hardly dissolved in cold water. When<br>
dissolved in an alkali solution or an alkali water-solution having an<br>
alkalinity value equivalent to or higher than, or preferably 1.0 to 1.5<br>
times higher than, the acid value of the copolymer/resin, they function as<br>
a dispersion stabilizer.<br>
By heating and mixing the mixture of the copolymer/resin and the<br>
alkali solution/alkali water-solution, they can be easily dissolved in the<br>
solution. When the alpha-olefin/maleic anhydride copolymer contains a<br><br>
long olefin chain, it will not easily be dissolved and may generate an<br>
undissolved matter. In such case, the effect thereof as a dispersion<br>
stabilizer can be maintained by appropriately filtering out the<br>
undissolved matter.<br>
Examples of the base of the alkali solution or alkali water-solution<br>
include hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydrate and<br>
lithium hydroxide; basic substances such as ammonium, triethylamine<br>
and morpholine; and alcohol amines such as tryethanolamine,<br>
diethanolamine, N-methyldiethanolamine,<br>
2-amino-2ethyl- 1,3-propanediol and.choline.<br>
For the alp haolefin/maleic anhydride copolymer represented by the<br>
structural formula 1, either those appropriately synthesized or<br>
commercially available products may be used. Examples of the<br>
commercially available products include TYP112, T-YP115, TYP114 and<br>
TYP116 (all manufactured by SEIKO PMC Corporation).<br>
For the styrene-(meta)acryl copolymer, either those appropriately<br>
synthesized or commercially available products may be used. Examples<br>
of the commercially available products include JC-05 (manufactured by<br>
SEIKO PMC Corporation), and AEUFONUC-3900, ARUFONUC-3910<br>
and ARUFONUC-3920 (all manufactured by Tbagosei Co., Ltd.).<br>
For the water-soluble polyurethane resin, either those appropriately<br>
synthesized or commercially available products may be used. Examples<br>
of the commercially available products include TAKELAC®W-5025,<br>
TAKELAC®W-6010 and TAKELAC®W-5661 (all manufactured by<br><br>
MITSUI TAKEDA CHEMICALS, INC.).<br>
For the water-soluble polyester resin, either those appropriately<br>
synthesized or commercially available products may be used. Examples<br>
of the commercially available products include NICHEGO POLYESTER<br>
W-0030, NICHEGO POLYESTER W0005S30WO and NICHEGO<br>
POLYESTER WR961 (all manufactured by The Nippon Synthetic<br>
Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.), and PESRESIN A-210 and PESRESIN<br>
A-520 (all manufactured by TAKAMATSU OIL&amp;FAT CO., LTD.).<br>
The acid value of the polymer dispersion stabilizer is preferably in<br>
the range of from 40 mgKOH/g to 400 mgKOH/g, and more preferably in<br>
the range of from 60 mgKOH/g to 350 mgKOH/g. When the acid value is<br>
less than 40 mgKOH/g, the resolvability of the alkali solution may be<br>
degraded. And when the value is more than 400 mgKOH/g, the viscosity<br>
of the pigment increases, and it may result in causing ejection failures<br>
and/or degradation of the dispersion stability of the pigment.<br>
The mass average molecular weight of the polymer dispersion<br>
stabilizer is preferably 20,000 or less, and more preferably in the range of<br>
from 5,000 to 20,000. When the mass average molecular weight is less<br>
than 5,000, the dispersion stability of the dispersed pigment may be<br>
degraded. And when it is more than 20,000, the resolvability of the<br>
alkali solution may be degraded, and its viscosity may increase.<br>
The content of the polymer dispersion stabilizer to 100 parts by mass<br>
of the pigment is preferably in the range of 1 part by mass to 100 parts by<br>
mass, and more preferably in the range of 5 parts by mass to 50 parts by<br><br>
mass based on the solid content. When the content is less than 1 part by<br>
mass, the polymer dispersion stabilizer may not sufficiently stabilize the<br>
dispersion state. And when it is more than 100 parts by mass, the ink<br>
viscosity increases, and it may result in causing ejection failures and/or<br>
increase in its production cost.<br>
- Pigment Dispersant -<br>
The water-dispersible colorant in the third structure preferably<br>
contains a pigment dispersant. A preferred pigment dispersant is one<br>
selected from anion surfactants and nonionic surfactants that has an<br>
HLB value of 10 to 20.<br>
Examples of the anion surfactants include polyoxyethylene<br>
alkylether acetate; alkylbenzene sulfonates such as NH4, Na and Ca;<br>
alkyldiphenylether disulfonates such as NH4, Na and Ca; sodium<br>
dialkylsuccinate sulfonate; sodium naphthalene sulfonate formalin<br>
condensate; polyoxyethylene polycyclic phenylethersulfate esters such as<br>
NH4 and Na; lauryl chlorides; polyoxyethylene alkyl ether sulfate; and<br>
oleic acids. Among those salts, sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinate salt and<br>
polyoxyethylene styrene phenylether sulfosuccinate ammonium salt are<br>
particularly preferable.<br>
Examples of the nonionic surfactants having an HLB value of 10 to<br>
20 include polyoxyethylene alkylether, polyoxyalkylene alkylether,<br>
polyoxyethylene polycyclic phenylether, sorbitan fatty acid ester,<br>
polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid ester, alkylphenol ethoxylate,<br>
polyoxyethylene alkyl amine, polyoxyethylene alkylamide and acetylene<br><br>
glycol. Among those, polyoxyethylene laurylether,<br>
polyoxyethylene-p-naphthylether, polyoxyethylene sorbitan monoleate<br>
and polyoxyethylene styrene phenylether are particularly preferable.<br>
The content of the dispersant to 100 parts by mass of the pigment is<br>
preferably in the range of 1 part by mass to 100 parts by mass, and more<br>
preferably in the range of 10 parts by mass to 50 parts by mass. When<br>
the content of the dispersant is insufficient, the pigment may not be<br>
sufficiently miniaturized. And when the content of the dispersant is too<br>
large, its excess component which is surplus thereof not adhering to the<br>
pigment, may adversely affect the property of the ink, causing bleeding<br>
and degradations in the water resistance and abrasion-resistance.<br>
The dispersed pigment can be obtained by dissolving the pigment<br>
dispersant in an aquatic medium, adding the pigment, sufficiently<br>
moisturizing the mixture, and kneading/dispersing using a high-speed<br>
agitator such as a homogenizer, a dispersion machine such as a bead mill<br>
or ball mill, a mixing-dispersion kneader such as a roll mill using shear<br>
force, or an ultrasonic dispersion machine. Coarse particles are likely to<br>
exist after such kneading/dispersing process, and they often cause<br>
blocking of inkjet nozzles and/or ink supply routes. Thus, it is necessary<br>
that coarse particles having particle diameters of 1 µm or larger be<br>
removed using, for example, a filter or a centrifugal separator.<br>
The average particle diameter (D50) of the dispersed pigment in the<br>
ink is preferably 150 nm or smaller, and more preferably 100 nm or<br>
smaller. When the average particle diameter (D50) is larger than 150 nm,<br><br>
the ejection stability may be drastically degraded, resulting in blocking of<br>
the inkjet nozzles and/or distorting ink ejection directions. On the other<br>
hand, when the average particle diameter (D50) is 100 nm or smaller, the<br>
ejection stability as well as image saturation will be improved.<br>
The content of the water-dispersible colorant in the recording ink is<br>
preferably in the range of 2% by mass to 15% by mass and more<br>
preferably in the range of 3% by mass to 12 % by mass based on the solid<br>
content. When the content is less than 2 % by mass, the ink color gamut<br>
and image densities may be drastically degraded. And when it is more<br>
than 15 % by mass, ink viscosity increases, and it may result in the<br>
degradation of the ink ejection stability and increase in its production<br>
cost.<br>
- Water-Dispersible Resin -<br>
At least fluorine resin participates are used as the water-dispersible<br>
resin because of their excellent film formability, or image formability, as<br>
well as excellent water repellency, water resistance and durability, and<br>
because they are effective means to record high density images having<br>
excellent color gamut and water resistance.<br>
Preferred examples of the fluorine resin particulates include those<br>
having a fluoroolefin unit. Of such fluorine resin particulates,<br>
particulates of vinyl ether resins composed of fluoroolefin units and vinyl<br>
ether units are particularly preferably used.<br>
The fluoroolefin unit is not particularly limited and can be<br>
appropriately selected depending on the purpose. Examples thereof<br><br>
include -CF2CF2-, CF2CF(CF2)- and -CF2CFCl-<br>
The vinyl ether unit is not particularly limited and can be<br>
appropriately selected depending on the purpose. Examples thereof<br>
include the compounds represented by the following structural formulas.<br><br><br><br>
The particulates of the vinyl ether resins composed of fluoroolefin<br>
units and vinyl ether units are preferably alternating copolymers of the<br>
fluoroolefin units and vinyl ether units.<br>
For such fluorine resin particulates, either those appropriately<br>
synthesized or commercially available products may be used. Examples<br>
of the commercially available products include FLUONATE FEM-500 and<br>
FEM-600, DICGUARD F-52S, F-90, F-90M and F-90N, and<br>
AQUAFURFURAN TE5A (all manufactured by DAINIPPON INK AND<br>
CHEMICALS, INCORPORATED); LUMIFLON FE4300, FE4500 and<br>
FE4400, and ASAHICUARD AG-7105, AG-950, AG-7600, AG-7000 and<br>
AG-1100 (all manufactured by ASAHI GLASS CO., LTD.).<br>
The fluorine resin particulates may be used in combination with a<br>
waterdispersible resin. In such case, the content of the fluorine resin<br>
particulates in the water-dispersible resin is preferably 50 % by mass or<br>
more, more preferably 70 % by mass or more and further preferably 80 %<br>
by mass or more. And it is most preferred that the content substantially<br>
be 100 % by mass.<br>
The waterdispersible resin used in combination is not particularly<br>
limited, and can be selected according to the purpose. Examples thereof<br>
include condensed synthetic resins, polyaddition resins and natural<br>
polymer compounds.<br>
Examples of the condensed synthetic resins include polyester resins,<br>
polyurethane resins, polyepoxy resins, polyamide resins, polyether resins<br><br>
and silicon resins. Examples of the polyaddition resins include<br>
polyolefin resins, polystyrene resins, polyvinyl alcohol resins, polyvinyl<br>
ester resins, polyacrylic acid resins and unsaturated carboxylic acid<br>
resins. Examples of the natural polymer compounds include celluloses,<br>
rosins and natural rubbers.<br>
The water dispersible resin may be used as a homopolymer or may be<br>
copolymerized to be used as a complex resin. It can be formed into any<br>
one of single phase structures, core shell structures and power-feed<br>
emulsions.<br>
Such water-dispersible resin can be selected from those themselves<br>
have hydrophilic groups and self-dispersibility and those themselves have<br>
no self-dispersibility while dispersibility is provided thereto by a means of<br>
a surfactant or a resin having hydrophilic groups. Among them,<br>
emulsions of the resin particles obtained by emulsification and/or<br>
suspension polymerization of an ionomer of polyester resin or<br>
polyurethane resin or an unsaturated monomer are preferable. In the<br>
emulsification polymerization of the unsaturated monomer, it is<br>
emulsificationpolymerized in water in which the unsaturated monomer,<br>
a polymerization initiator, and the surfactant, a chain transfer agent, a<br>
chelating agent and a pH adjuster are added. Thus, the water<br>
dispersible resin can be easily obtained, and further, resin constitution<br>
can be easily changed, enabling to obtain desired property thereof.<br>
Examples of the unsaturated monomer include unsaturated<br>
carboxylic acids, (meth)acrylic acid ester monomers, (meth)acrylic acid<br><br>
amide monomers, aromatic vinyl monomers, vinyl cyano compound<br>
monomers, vinyl monomers, allyl compound monomers, olefin monomers,<br>
diene monomers, oligomers having unsaturated carbon atoms. Those<br>
can be used alone or in combination. By using those monomers in<br>
combination, it is possible to flexibly modify the property of the resulted<br>
monomers. And by a means of polymerization/graft-polymerization<br>
using an oligomer polymerization initiator, it is also possible to improve<br>
the property of the resin.<br>
Examples of the unsaturated carboxylic acids include acrylic acid,<br>
methacrylic acid, itaconic acid, fumaric acid and maleic acid.<br>

acid.<br><br>

oligomers having a methacryloyl group, methyl methacrylate oligomers<br>
having a methacryloyl group, methyl siloxane oligomers having a<br>
methacryloyl group and polyester oligomers having a acrylyl group.<br>
Since breakdowns of the molecular chain, including dispersion<br>
breaking and hydrolysis, are caused under a strong alkaline or acidic<br>
environment, pH of the water dispersible resin is preferably in the range<br>
of from 4 to 12, and more preferably in the range of from 6 to 11 in terms<br>
of miscibility with the water dispersible colorant. It is further preferably<br><br>
in the range of 7 to 9.<br>
The average-particle diameter (D50) of the water dispersible resin<br>
determines the viscosity of the dispersed liquid. Provided composition<br>
and the solid content of the dispersed liquid remain the same, particles<br>
having smaller diameters provide higher viscosity. The<br>
water-dispersible resin preferably has an average particle diameter (D50)<br>
of 50 nm or larger for preventing inks using the water-dispersible resin<br>
from having excessively high viscosity. On the other hand, when the<br>
water-dispersible resin has an average particle diameter of several dozen<br>
micrometers, it cannot be used because the diameter is larger than the<br>
diameter of inkjet nozzles. And even if the average particle diameter of<br>
water-dispersible resin is smaller than the nozzles, excessively large<br>
particles thereof in an ink degrade its ejection stability. Thus, for<br>
preventing the degradation of the ejection stability, the average particle<br>
diameter (D50) is preferably 200 nm or smaller and more preferably 150<br>
nm or smaller.<br>
The water-dispersible resin preferably functions as a means to fix the<br>
water-dispersible coloring material onto paper, and preferably improves<br>
the fixation characteristic of the colorant by filming under room<br>
temperature. Therefore, it is preferred that a minimum film formation<br>
temperature (MFT) of the water-dispersible resin be 30 °C or lower and<br>
more preferably 20°C or lower.<br>
And the glass transition temperature of the water dispersible resin is<br>
preferably -30 °C or higher, because when the temperature is -40 °C or<br><br>
lower, the viscosity of the resin film increases, resulting in the generation<br>
of wrinkles on printed paper.<br>
The content of the waterdispersible resin in the recording ink is<br>
preferably in the range of from 2 % by mass to 30 % by mass and more<br>
preferably in the range of 6 % by mass to 25 % by mass based on the solid<br>
content.<br>
- Wetting Agent -<br>
The recording ink of the present invention contains water as a liquid<br>
medium. To prevent the ink from drying, and to improve dispersion<br>
stability, the following wetting agent is used in the ink. The wetting<br>
agent is an effective means for preventing the degradations of the ink<br>
ejection stability and the resolvability, caused by water evaporation.<br>
The wetting agent is not particularly limited and can be<br>
appropriately selected in accordance with the purpose. Examples<br>
thereof include polyalcohols, polyalcohol alkylethers, polyalcohol aryl<br>
ethers, nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds, amides, amines,<br>
sulfur-containing compounds, propylene carbonates, ethylene carbonic<br>
acids and other wetting agents. These may be used alone or in<br>
combination.<br>
Examples of the polyalcohols include glycerine, diethylene glycol,<br>
1,3-butanediol, 3-methyM,3butanediol, triethylene glycol, propylene<br>
glycol, dipropylene glycol, trimethylol propane, trimethylol ethane,<br>
ethylene glycol, tripropylene glycol, tetraethylene glycol, hexylene glycol,<br>
polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, 1,5-pentadiol, 1,6-hexanediol,<br><br>
glycerol, 1,2,6-hexanetriol, 1,2,4-butanetriol, 1,2,4-butanetriol,<br>
1,2,3-butanetriol and petriol.<br>
Examples of the polyvalent alcohol alkyl ether compounds include<br>
ethylene glycol monoethyl ether, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether,<br>
ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether,<br>
diethylene glycol monobutyl ether, tetraethylene glycol monomethyl ether<br>
and propylene glycol monoethyl ether.<br>
Examples of the polyvalent alcohol aryl ethers include ethylene glycol<br>
monophenyl ether and ethylene glycol monobenzyl ether.<br>
Examples of the nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds include<br>
2-pyrrolidone, Nmethyl-2-pyrrolidone, Nhydroxyethyl-2-pyrrolidone,<br>
1,3-dimethyh'midazolidinone, e-caprolactam and γ-butyrolactone.<br>
Examples of the amides include formamide, N-methylformamide and<br>
N,N-dimethylformamide.<br>
Examples of the amines include monoethanolamine, diethanolamine,<br>
triethanolamine, monoethylamine, diethylamine and triethylamine.<br>
Examples of the sulfur-containing compounds include<br>
dimethylsulfoxide, sulfolane and thiodiethanol.<br>
Preferred examples of the other wetting agents include those having<br>
saccharides. Examples of the saccharides include monosaccharide,<br>
disaccharide, oligosaccharide (including trisaccharide and<br>
tetrasaccharide) and polysaccharide. Specific examples thereof include<br>
glucose, mannose, fructose, ribose, xylose, arabinose, galactose, maltose,<br>
cellobiose, lactose, sucrose, trehalose, and maltotriose. Herein, the term<br><br>
"polysaccharide" refers to saccharides in a broad sense, and it includes<br>
widespread natural saccharides such as acyclodextrins and celluloses<br>
Examples of derivatives of such saccharides include reducing sugars<br>
thereof, including sugar alcohols which are generally represented as<br>
HOCH2(CHOH)nCH2OH (where n is an integer of 2 to 5), oxidized<br>
saccharides such as aldonic acids and uronic acids, amino acids and thio<br>
acids. Of those saccharides, the sugar alcohols are preferable. Specific<br>
examples thereof include maltitol and sorbit.<br>
Of those wetting agents, glycerol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol,<br>
1,3-butanediol, 3-methyll,3butanediol, 2-pyrrolidone and<br>
N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone are preferable because they provide excellent<br>
storage stability and ejection stability.<br>
The mass ratio of the pigment to the wetting agent particularly<br>
relates to the stability of ejecting ink drops from inkjet nozzles. When<br>
the formulation amount of the wetting agent in an ink is low relative to<br>
the content of solidified pigment, water contained in the ink evaporates<br>
from ink nozzles and/or ink ejecting systems, and it may result in the<br>
blocking of the nozzles.<br>
The content of the wetting agent in the recording ink is preferably in<br>
the range of 20 % by mass to 35 % by mass and more preferably in the<br>
range of 22.5 % by mass to 32.5 % by mass. By adjusting the content in<br>
the ranges, it is possible to protect the ink from drying and improve the<br>
storage stability of the ink, and thus the reliability of the ink can be<br>
increased. When the content is less than 20 % by mass, the ink around<br><br>
the nozzles easily dries, causing the blocking of the nozzles. When it<br>
exceeds 35 % by mass, the drying characteristics on paper may degrade,<br>
and image quality may also degrade on regular paper.<br>
- Surfactants -<br>
The surfactant can be appropriately selected from those which will<br>
not impair the dispersion stability when used in combination with any<br>
colorant/wetting agent and have a low surface tension and a high leveling<br>
characteristic. It is preferably selected from one of silicone surfactants<br>
and fluorinated surfactants. Among them, the fluorinated surfactants<br>
are particularly preferable.<br>
The fluorinated surfactant preferably has 2 to 16, and more<br>
preferably 4 to 16 carbon atoms substituted with fluorine atoms. When<br>
the number of carbon atoms substituted with fluorine atoms is less than<br>
two, the effect of fluorine is not obtained in some cases. When it is more<br>
than 16, problems such as degradation in the storage stability of the ink<br>
may occur.<br>
Examples of the fluorinated surfactants include perfluoroalkyl<br>
sulfonic acid compounds, perfluoroalkyl carboxylic compounds,<br>
perfluoroalkyl phosphate ester compounds, perfluoroalkyl ethylene oxide<br>
adducts and polyoxyalkylene ether polymer compounds having<br>
perfluoroalkyl ether group at the side chain thereof. Among them, the<br>
polyoxyalkylene ether polymer compounds having perfluoroalkyl ether<br>
group at the side chain are particularly preferable for its low foaming<br>
property.<br><br>
Examples of the perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acid compounds include<br>
perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acid and perfluoroalkyl sulfonate salts.<br>
Examples of the perfluoroalkyl carboxylic compounds include<br>
perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acid and perfluoroalkyl carboxylate salts.<br>
Examples of the perfluoroalkyl phosphate ester compounds include<br>
perfluoroalkyl phosphate ester and salts of perfluoroalkyl phosphate<br>
ester.<br>
Examples of the polyoxyalkylene ether polymer compounds having<br>
perfluoroalkyl ether group at side chain include polyoxyalkylene ether<br>
polymers having perfluoroalkyl ether group at side chain, sulfates of<br>
polyoxyalkylene ether polymers having perfluoroalkyl ether group at side<br>
chain and salts of polyoxyalkylene ether polymers having perfluoroalkyl<br>
ether group at side chain.<br>
Examples of the counterions of the salts in these fluorinated<br>
surfactants include Li, Na, K, NH4, NH3CH2CH2OH, NH2(CH2CH2OH)2<br>
and NH(CH2CH2OH)3.<br>
The fluorinated surfactants can be selected from either those<br>
appropriately synthesized or commercially available products.<br>
Examples of the commercially available products include Surflon<br>

Asahi Glass Co., Ltd.), Fullard FC-93, FC-95, FC-98, FC-129, FC-135,<br>
FC-170C, FC-430, FC-431 (supplied from Sumitomo 3M Ltd.), Megafac<br>

Incorporated), Zonyl TBS, FSP, FSA, FSN-100, FSN, FSO-100, FSO,<br><br>
FS-300, UR(manufactured by DuPont), FT-110, FT-250, ET-251, FT-400S,<br>

(manufactured by DuPont), FT-110, FT-250, FT251, FT400S, FT-150,<br>
FT-400SW (manufactured by NEOS Company Limited) and PF-151N<br>
(manufactured by Omnova Inc.) are particularly preferable as they can<br>
provide excellent image quality, and particularly they can improve color<br>
gamut of recorded images and enable the ink to be uniformly absorbed in<br>
paper.<br>
Specific examples of the fluorinated surfactants include those<br>
represented by the following structural formulas.<br>
(1) Anionic fluorinated surfactants<br><br>
Where Rf represents a mixture of fluorine containing hydrophobic<br>
groups represented by the following structural formula. And where A<br>
represents -SO3X, COOX or -PO3X (X is counteranion, and specifically it<br>
may be a hydrogen atom, Li, Na, K, NH4, NH3CH2CH2OH,<br>
NH2(CH2CH2OH)2, or NH(CH2CH2OH)3).<br><br><br><br>
Where Rf represents a fluorine containing group represented by the<br>
following structural formula. Where X represents the same as described<br>
above. And where "n" represents an integer of 1 or 2, and "m" represents<br>
2-n.<br><br>
Where "n" represents an integer of 3 to 10.<br><br>

an integer of 5 to 20.<br><br>
Where Rf is the same as described above. And where "n" represents<br>
an integer of 1 to 40.<br><br>
(3)	Amphoteric Fluorinated Surfactant<br><br>
Where Rf is the same as described above.<br>
(4)	Oligomer-Type Fluorinated Surfactant<br><br>
Where Rf" represents a fluorine-containing group represented by the<br>
following structural formula, "n" represents an integer of 0 to 10, and X is<br>
the same as described above.<br><br>
Where "n" represents an integer of 1 to 4.<br><br>
Where Rf" is the same as defined above, and "I", "m" and "n" each<br>
represent an integer of 0 to 10.<br>
The silicone surfactant is not particularly limited, and can be<br>
appropriately selected in accordance with the purpose. It is preferred<br><br>
that it be selected from those which are not decomposed in a high pH<br>
environment. Examples of such surfactants include side chain modified<br>
polydimethylsiloxane, chain ends modified polydimethylsiloxane, chain<br>
end modified polydimethylsiloxane, and sidechain ends modified<br>
polydimethylsiloxane. Modifying groups having a polyoxyethylene<br>
group or a polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene group are particularly<br>
preferable because of their excellent characteristics as an aqueous<br>
surfactant.<br>
Such surfactants may be selected from those appropriately<br>
synthesized or commercially available products.<br>
Examples of the commercially available products include those<br>
manufactured by BYK Japan KK, Shin-Etsu Silicones Co., Ltd., and Dow<br>
Corning Tray Co., Ltd.<br>
The polyether modified silicone surfactant is not particularly limited<br>
and can be appropriately selected in accordance with the purpose.<br>
Examples thereof include compounds obtained by introducing the<br>
polyalkylene oxide structure represented by the following structural<br>
formula into Si side chain of dimethyl polysiloxane.<br><br>
Where "m", "n", "a" and "b" represent integers. And where R and R'<br><br>
represent an alkyl group and an alkylene group respectively.<br>
The polyether modified silicone compounds may be selected from<br>
commercially available products. Examples thereof include KF-618,<br>
KF-642 and KF643 (manufactured by Shin-Etsu Chemical Co., Ltd.).<br>
The content of the surfactant in the recording ink is preferably in the<br>
range of from 0.01 % by mass to 3.0 % by mass and more preferably in the<br>
range of from 0.5 % by mass to 2 % by mass.<br>
When the content is less than 0.01 % by mass, the effect of adding the<br>
surfactant may not be obtained. When it exceeds 3.0 % by mass, the<br>
permeability of the ink to a recording medium may excessively increase,<br>
resulting in reduction in the image density and causing the ink to pass<br>
through to the other side of the recording medium.<br>
- Penetrating Agent -<br>
It is preferred that at least a polyol compound having a solubility to<br>
20 °C water of 0.2 % by mass to 5.0 % by mass be contained in the ink as a<br>
penetrating agent. Examples of the polyol compound include aliphatic<br>
diols such as 2-ethyl-2-methyl-l,3-propanediol, 3,3-dimethyl-<br>
1,2-butanediol, 2,2-diethyll,3propanediol,<br>
2methyl-2-propyl-l,3-propanediol, 2,4-dimethyl-2,4-pentanediol,<br>
2,5-dimethyl-2,5hexanediol, 5hexene-l,2-diol and<br>
2ethyl-l,3hexanediol.<br>
Of those diols, 2ethyl-l,3hexanediol and<br>
2,2,4trimethyM,3-pentanediol are particularly preferable.<br>
The other penetrating agents which can be used in combination are<br><br>
not particularly limited, and can be appropriately selected in accordance<br>
with the purpose. They can be selected from those which are soluble to<br>
the ink and can have desired properties. Examples thereof include<br>
alkyls or arylethers of polyalcohols, including diethylene glycol<br>
monophenyl ether, ethylene glycol monophenyl ether, ethylene glycol<br>
monoallyl ether, diethylene glycol monobutyl ether, propylene glycol<br>
monobutyl ether and tetraethylene glycol chlorophenyl ether; and lower<br>
alcohols such as ethanols.<br>
The content of the penetrating agent in the recording ink is<br>
preferably in the range of 0.1 % by mass to 4.0 % by mass. When the<br>
content is less than 0.1 % by mass, the ink drying speed may be slowed,<br>
resulting in occurrence of bleeding. And when it is more than 4.0 % by<br>
mass, the dispersion stability of the colorant may be degraded, resulting<br>
in frequent occurrences of nozzle blocking and excessive increase of the<br>
permeability to a recording medium, which causes the degradation of the<br>
image density and the ink to pass through to the other side of the<br>
recording medium.<br>
The other components are not particularly limited, and can be<br>
appropriately selected in accordance with the necessity. Examples<br>
thereof include pH adjusters, preservatives/anti-fungal agents, chelate<br>
agents, antirusts, antioxidants, ultraviolet ray absorbers, oxygen<br>
absorbers and photo stabilizers.<br>
The pH adjuster is particularly limited provided it can adjust pH to a<br>
desired level in the range of 7 to 11 without adversely affecting the<br><br>
recording ink, and it can be appropriately selected in accordance with the<br>
purpose. Examples therefor include alcohol amines, alkali metal<br>
hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide, phosphonium hydroxide and alkali<br>
metal carbonate salts. When the pH level is lower than 7 or higher than<br>
11, the ink containing it excessively melts an inkjet had and ink supply<br>
unit, and that may result in the change in ink property, causing ink<br>
leaking and blocking ink nozzles.<br>
Examples of the alcohol amines include diethanolamine,<br>
triethanolamine and 2-amino-2-ethyl-l,3-propanediol.<br>
Examples of the hydroxide of alkali metal elements includes lithium<br>
hydroxide, sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide.<br>

Examples of the antirusts include acidic sulfite salts, sodium<br><br>
thiosulfate, ammonium thiodiglycolate, diisopropylammonium nitrate,<br>

The recording ink of the present invention is obtained by<br>
dispersing/melting a waterdispersible colorant, a water-dispersible resin,<br>
a wetting agent, a surfactant, water and other components in accordance<br>
with necessity in a water-based medium. They may further be<br>
stirred/mixed in accordance with necessity. Those components can be<br>
dispersed using, for example, a sand mill, a homogenizer, a ball mill, a<br>
paint shaker or an ultrasonic dispersing machine. The components can<br>
be stirred/mixed using, for example, a regular stirrer equipped with<br>
stirring wings, a magnetic stirrer or a high speed dispersing machine.<br>
The properties of the recording ink of the present invention is not<br>
particularly limited, and can be appropriately adjusted in accordance<br><br>
with the purpose, while it is preferred that its properties including<br>
viscosity, surface tension and pH be in the following ranges.<br>
The viscosity of the recording ink at 25 °C is preferably in the range<br>
of from 5 mPa.s to 20 mPa.s, and more preferably in the range of from 10<br>
mPa.s to 20 mPa.s . When the viscosity is 5 mPa.s or more, the ink can<br>
provide higher image density and better image quality. While excellent<br>
ejection stability is maintained by adjusting the ink viscosity at 20 mPa.s<br>
or lower.<br>
The viscosity at 25 °C can be measured with, for example, RL-500 (a<br>
viscometer manufactured by TOKI SANGYO CO., LTD.).<br>
The surface tension of the recording ink at 25 °C is preferably 35<br>
mN/m or lower and more preferably 30 mN/m or lower. When the<br>
surface tension is more than 35 mN/m, the levelling of the ink on the<br>
recording medium may be slowed, resulting in longer drying time.<br>
The coloration of the recording ink of the present invention is not<br>
particularly limited, can be appropriately selected in accordance with the<br>
purpose. Examples thereof include yellow, magenta, cyan and black.<br>
Multicolor images can be recorded using an ink set having two or more<br>
such colors in combination. Full color images can be recorded using an<br>
ink set having all the colors in combination.<br>
The recording ink of the present invention can be suitably used for<br>
printers having any types of inkjet heads. Examples of the inkjet heads<br>
include a so-called piezoelectric type inkjet head where ink drops are<br>
ejected by changing the volume of an ink flow path by deforming a<br><br>
vibration plate which forms a wall of the ink flow path and which is<br>
deformed using a piezoelectric element as a means to apply pressure to<br>
the ink in the ink flow path (see JP-A No. 0251734); or a so-called<br>
thermal inkjet head where bubbles are generated by heating the ink in<br>
the ink flow path using an exothermic resistive element (see JP-A No.<br>
61-59911); or an electrostatic inkjet head where the electrode and the<br>
vibration plate which forms the wall of the ink flow path are disposed in<br>
opposed positions, and the volume in the ink flow path is changed to eject<br>
the ink by an electrostatic power generated between the electrode and the<br>
vibration plate (see JP-A No. 0671882).<br>
The recording ink of the present invention can be suitably used as an<br>
ink for inkjet recording, as well as for variety of usages including fountain<br>
pens, ball-points, markers and felt pens. Particularly, it can be<br>
preferably used in inkjet image forming apparatuses such as printers that<br>
heat a recording medium and ink to 50 °C to 200 °C before/after printing<br>
as a means to promote fixing of a recorded image. The ink of the present<br>
invention can particularly preferably be used for the ink/media set, ink<br>
cartridge, ink recorded matter, inkjet recording apparatus and inkjet<br>
recording method of the present invention.<br>
(Ink/Media Set)<br>
The ink/media set of the present invention contains the recording ink<br>
and the recording medium of the present invention.<br><recording medium><br>
The recording medium is not particularly limited and can be<br><br>
appropriately selected in accordance with the purpose. Suitable<br>
examples thereof include regular paper, glossy coated printing paper,<br>
special paper, fabric, film, OHP sheet and regular printing paper.<br>
In order to obtain a recorded matter with excellent image quality, the<br>
recording medium should have a base and a coating which is provided on<br>
at least one side of the base, wherein the transfer amount of pure water to<br>
the recording medium should be in the range of from 2 ml/m2 to 35 ml/m2<br>
when measured at a contacting time of 100 ms and with a dynamic<br>
scanning absorptometer, and the transfer amount of pure water to the<br>
recording medium is in the range of from 3 ml/m2 to 40 ml/m2 when<br>
measured at a contacting time of 400 ms.<br>
The transfer amount of purified water to the recording medium at the<br>
contacting time of 100 ms is preferably in the range of 1 mL/m2 to 5<br>
mL/m2, and the transfer amount of purified water to the recording<br>
medium at the contacting time of 400 ms is in the range of 3 mL/m2 to 10<br>
mL/m2 mL/m.<br>
When the transfer amount of the ink and purified water at the<br>
contacting time of 100 ms is insufficient, the beading of the recording<br>
medium may easily occur. When it is too large, the diameter of dots<br>
forming recorded images on the recording medium may not be sufficient.<br>
When the transfer amount at the contacting time of 400 ms is<br>
insufficient, the recording medium cannot provide sufficiently fast drying<br>
speed, and thus spur marks may be easily generated and. On the other<br>
hand, when it is excessively large, the recording medium may not provide<br><br>
a excellent glossy surface on a dried recorded image.<br>
Here, the dynamic scanning absorptometer (stated in JPA's<br>
Voluntary Action Plan and Report of Energy Situation in the Pulp and<br>
Paper Industry in Japan vol. 48, 8892, May, 1994, Sigenori Kukan), or<br>
DSA, is a device capable of precisely measuring the liquid absorption in<br>
an extremely short period of time. With the dynamic scanning<br>
absorptometer, the liquid absorption rate of the recording medium can be<br>
automatically measured by directly measuring a liquid absorption rate<br>
from a movement of a meniscus in a capillary, by forming a sample into a<br>
disc form, spirally scanning a liquid absorption head, automatically<br>
changing the scanning rate in accordance with a predetermined pattern,<br>
and repeating the measurement procedure a desired number of times on<br>
only one sample. A liquid supply head to a paper sample is connected to<br>
the capillary through a Teflon (registered trade name) tube, and the<br>
position of the meniscus in the capillary is automatically read with an<br>
optical sensor. Specifically, using the dynamic scanning absorptometer<br>
(K350 series D type supplied from Kyowa Seiko Co., Ltd.), the transfer<br>
amount of purified water can be measured. The transfer amounts at the<br>
contact time of 100 ms and 400 ms can be calculated by interpolation<br>
based on measured values of the transfer amounts at contact time<br>
adjacent to each contact time.<br>
- Support -<br>
The support is not particularly limited, can be appropriately selected<br>
depending on the purpose, and includes, for example, paper whose major<br><br>
ingredient is wood fiber and sheet-shaped substances such as nonwoven<br>
fabrics whose major ingredients are wood fibers and synthetic fibers.<br>
The paper is not particularly limited and can be appropriately<br>
selected in accordance with the purpose. Examples thereof include wood<br>
pulps and used paper pulps. Examples of the wood pulps include broad<br>
leaved tree bleached kraft pulps (LBKP), needle leaved tree bleached<br>
kraft pulps (NBKP), NBSP, LBSP, GP and TMP.<br>
Raw materials of the used paper pulps include paper material used<br>
for super white paper, white paper with rule marks, cream white paper,<br>
card paper, super white paper, medium white paper, simili paper, color<br>
white paper, Kent paper, white art paper, special high cut paper, other<br>
high cut paper, and paper used for newspaper and magazines.<br>
Standards of those types of paper are specified in Used Paper Standard<br>
Quality Specification table issued by the Paper Recycling Promotion<br>
Center. More specific examples of those types of paper include variety of<br>
types of non-coated PC paper, printer sheets such as thermal paper and<br>
pressure-sensitive paper which are generally used in IT devices; variety<br>
of types of used OA sheets such as PPC sheets; variety of types of coated<br>
paper including art paper, coated paper, finely coated paper and mat<br>
paper; and variety of types of non-coated paper such as quality paper,<br>
color high quality paper, notepaper, letter paper, packing paper, facsimile<br>
paper, medium quality paper, newspaper, fancy-figured paper, super<br>
ceremony paper, structure paper, pure white rolling paper, milk cartons,<br>
chemical pulp paper and high process yield pulp-containing paper.<br><br>
These may be used alone or in combination.<br>
The used paper pulp is generally produced by a combination of the<br>
following 4 steps-<br>
(1)	a separating step in which used paper is crumbled into fibers by a<br>
mechanical force generated in a pulper and by a chemical reaction, and<br>
then printed ink is separated from the fibers;<br>
(2)	a cleaning step in which contained foreign matters (plastics and<br>
the like) and dusts are removed with a screen/cleaner;<br>
(3)	a deinking step in which the printed ink separated from the fibers<br>
using a surfactant is removed outside by a floatation method or a washing<br>
method; and<br>
(4)	a bleaching step in which fibers are treated with an oxidation<br>
reaction or a reduction reaction to make the fibers whiter.<br>
When the used paper pulp is mixed, the mixed amount of the used<br>
paper pulp per the total amount of the pulps is preferably 40% or less for<br>
preventing paper made of the pulps from curling after recorded.<br>
Examples of internally added fillers used in the support include<br>
known white pigments. Examples of the white pigments include white<br>
inorganic pigments such as light calcium carbonates, heavy calcium<br>
carbonates, kaolin, clays, talcs, calcium sulfates, barium sulfates,<br>
titanium dioxides, zinc oxides, zinc sulfides, zinc carbonates, satin whites,<br>
aluminium silicates, diatom earth, calcium silicates, magnesium silicates,<br>
synthetic silicas, aluminas, lithopones, zeolites, magnesium carbonates<br>
and magnesium carbonates; and organic pigments such as styrene based<br><br>
plastic pigments, acrylic plastic pigments, polyethylene, microcapsules,<br>
urea resins and melamine resins. These may be used alone or in<br>
combination.<br>
Examples of an internally added sizing agent used in making the<br>
support include neutral rosin sizing agents for neutral paper making;<br>
alkenyl succinic acid anhydrate (ASA); alkyl ketene (timers (AKD); and<br>
petroleum resin based sizing agents. Among those, the neutral rosin<br>
sizing agent and alkenyl succinic acid anhydrate are particularly<br>
preferable. Although a small amount of the alkyl ketene dimer is needed<br>
to provide sufficient size effect, it may not be preferable to added even the<br>
small amount thereof. This is because adding the alkyl ketene dimer<br>
decreases the friction coefficient of the surfaces of recording paper (or<br>
medium), making the medium easier to slip on a recording medium<br>
feeding device and feeding the medium difficult.<br>
The thickness of the support is not particularly limited and can be<br>
adjusted at an appropriate level in accordance with the purpose, while it<br>
is preferably in the range of 50 µm to 300 µm. The basis weight of the<br>
support is preferably in the range of 45 g/m2 to 290 g/m2.<br>
- Coating Layer -<br>
The coating layer contains a pigment and a binder, and it further<br>
contains a surfactant and other ingredients in accordance with necessity.<br>
As the pigment, inorganic pigments may be used alone or in<br>
combination with organic pigments.<br>
Examples of the inorganic pigments include kaolins, heavy calcium<br><br>
carbonates, light calcium carbonates, calcium sulfites, amorphous silicas,<br>
titanium whites, magnesium carbonates, titanium dioxides, aluminium<br>
hydroxides, calcium hydroxides, magnesium hydroxides, zinc hydroxides<br>
and chlorites. Among them, the kaolins are preferable for its capability<br>
to provide excellent gloss surfaces on recorded ink images. It enables to<br>
obtain a recorded image that is as excellent quality as an image printed<br>
by offset printing.<br>
Examples of the kaolins include delaminated kaolin, baked kaolin<br>
and engineered kaolin obtained by surface modification. In order to<br>
obtain desirable gloss surfaces, it is preferred that a kaolin having a<br>
particle diameter distribution in which particles having a diameter of 2<br>
mm or smaller is 80% by mass or more occupy 50% by mass or more in the<br>
entire kaolin.<br>
The added amount of kaolin is preferably 50 parts by mass or more<br>
per 100 parts by mass of the binden When the added amount is less<br>
than 50 parts by mass, excellent gloss surfaces may not be obtained. The<br>
upper limit of the added amount is not particularly provided, while it is<br>
more preferably 90 parts by mass or less when coating adequacies such as<br>
fluidity and, particularly, thickening property under high shearing force<br>
of the kaolin are taken into account.<br>
Examples of the organic pigments include water-soluble dispersions<br>
of, for example, styrene-acryl copolymer particles, styrene-butadiene<br>
copolymer particles, polystyrene particles and polyethylene particles.<br>
Two or more such organic pigments may be mixed in combination.<br><br>
The added amount of the organic pigment is preferably in the range<br>
of 2 parts by mass to 20 parts by mass relative to 100 parts by mass of all<br>
pigments contained in the coating layer. The organic pigment which can<br>
provide excellent gloss surfaces and its specific gravity relatively smaller<br>
than that of the inorganic pigment enables to obtain bulky and highly<br>
glossy coating layer having a good surface coating property. When the<br>
added amount is less than 2 parts by mass, the above-stated effects may<br>
not be obtained. When it exceeds 20 parts by mass, the fluidity of the<br>
coating solution may be degraded, resulting in the reduction of<br>
productivity of the coating layers and increase in its cost.<br>
The organic pigment may be in a form of a compact type, a hollow<br>
type and a doughnut type, while the hollow type preferably having an<br>
average particle diameter (D50) of 0.2 µm to 3.0 µm and more preferably<br>
having a void ratio of 40 % or more is preferable when the balance<br>
between gloss surface and coating ability and flowability of the coating<br>
liquid is taken into account.<br>
For the binder, it is preferable to use a water-based resin.<br>
For the water-based resin, at least one of water-soluble resins and<br>
water dispersible resins can be suitably used. The water-soluble resins<br>
are not particularly limited, and can be appropriately selected in<br>
accordance with the purpose. Examples thereof include polyvinyl<br>
alcohol, modified polyvinyl alcohols such as cation modified polyvinyl<br>
alcohol and acetal modified polyvinyl alcohol; polyvinyl pyrrolidone and<br>
modified polyvinyl pyrrolidone such as copolymers of polyvinyl<br><br>
pyrrolidone and vinyl acetate, copolymers of vinyl pyrrolidone and<br>
dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate, copolymers of quaternized vinyl<br>
pyrrolidone and dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate and copolymers of<br>
vinyl pyrrolidone and methcrylamidepropyl trimethyl ammonium<br>
chloride; celluloses such as carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose<br>
and hydroxypropylcellulose; modified cellulose such as cationized<br>
hydroxyethylcellulose; polyester, polyacrylic acid (ester), melamine resins<br>
or modified products thereof; synthetic resins such as copolymers of<br>
polyester and polyurethane; poly(meth)acrylic acid, poly(meth)acrylamide,<br>
oxidized starch, phosphate esterified starch, self-modified starch,<br>
cationized starch or various modified starch, polyethylene oxide, soda<br>
polyacrylate and soda alginate. These may be used alone or in<br>
combination.<br>
Among them, polyvinyl alcohol, cation modified polyvinyl alcohol,<br>
acetal modified polyvinyl alcohol, polyester, polyurethane, copolymers of<br>
polyester and polyurethane and the like are particularly preferable for<br>
improving the ink absorbency.<br>
The water-dispersible resins are not particularly limited, and can be<br>
appropriately selected in accordance with the purpose. Examples<br>
thereof include polyvinyl acetate, copolymers of ethylene and vinyl<br>
acetate, polystyrene, copolymers of styrene and (meth)acrylic acid,<br>
copolymers of (meth) acry late ester, copolymers of vinyl acetate and<br>
(meth)acrylate ester, styrene-butadiene copolymers, ethylene-propylene<br>
copolymers and silicone-acryl based copolymers. Crosslinking agents<br><br>
such as methylolized melamine, methylolized urea, methylolized<br>
hydroxypropylene urea and isocyanate may be contained. Copolymers<br>
having a unit such as N-methylol acrylamide and self cross-linking ability<br>
may also be used. Two or more such water-based resins can be used in<br>
combination.<br>
The added amount of the water-based resin per 100 parts by mass of<br>
the pigment is preferably in the range of 2 parts by mass to 100 parts by<br>
mass, and more preferably in the range of 3 parts by mass to 50 parts by<br>
mass. The added amount of the water-based resin is determined so that<br>
the absorbency property to the recording medium of the ink is adjusted in<br>
a desired range.<br>
When the waterdispersible colorant is used as the colorant, a<br>
cationic organic compound may also be used. The cationic organic<br>
compound is not particularly limited and can be appropriately selected in<br>
accordance with the purpose. Examples thereof include primary to<br>
tertiary amines, monomers, oligomers and polymers of quaternary<br>
ammonium salts which form insoluble salts by reacting with a sulfone<br>
group, carboxyl group or amino group in a direct dye or an acidic dye<br>
contained in a water-soluble ink. Among them, the oligomer or the<br>
polymer is preferable.<br>
Examples of the cationic organic compounds include dimethylamine<br>
epichlorohydrin polycondensates, dimethylamine ammonia<br>
epichlorohydrin condensates, poly(trimethylaminoethyl methacrylate<br>
methyl sulfate salt), diallylamine hydrochloride salts, acrylamide<br><br>
copolymers, poly(diallylamine hydrochloride salt sulfur dioxide),<br>
polyallylamine hydrochloride salts, poly(diallylamihe hydrochloride salt<br>
diallylamine hydrochloride salt), acrylamide diallylamine copolymers,<br>
polyvinylamine copolymers, dicyandiamide ammonium chloride urea<br>
formaldehyde condensates, polyalkylenepolyamine dicyandiamide<br>
ammonium salt condensates, dimethyldiallyl ammonium chloride<br>
polydiallylmethylamine hydrochloride salts, poly(diallyldimethyl<br>
ammonium chloride), poly(diallyldimethyl ammonium chloride sulfur<br>
dioxide), poly(diallyldimethyl ammonium chloride diallylamine<br>
hydrochloride salt derivative), acrylamide diallyldimethyl ammonium<br>
chloride copolymers, acrylate salts, acrylamide diallylamine<br>
hydrochloride salt copolymers, ethyleneimine derivatives such as<br>
polyethyleneimine and acrylamine polymers and modified<br>
polyethyleneimine alkylene oxide. These may be used alone or in<br>
combination.<br>
Among them, it is preferable to use the low molecular weight cationic<br>
organic compounds such as dimethylamine epichlorohydrin<br>
polycondensate and polyallylamine hydrochloride salt in combination<br>
with the cationic organic compound with a relatively high molecular<br>
weight, including polyCdiallyldimethyl ammonium chloride). By using<br>
those in combination, the image density is enhanced, and also it is<br>
possible to reduce the occurrence of feathering compared with using only<br>
one of them.<br>
The cation equivalent of the cationic organic compound, measured by<br><br>
a colloid titration technique using polyvinyl potassium sulfate and<br>
toluidine blue, is preferably in the range of 3 meq/g to 8 meq/g. When<br>
the cation equivalent is in that range, excellent ink properties can be<br>
obtained in the range of the dried adhesion amount mentioned below.<br>
When the cation equivalent is measured by the colloid titration<br>
technique, the cationic organic compound is diluted with distilled water<br>
so that the solid content is 0.1% by mass, while pH is not adjusted.<br>
The dried adhesion amount of the cationic organic compound is<br>
preferably in the range of 0.3 g/m2 to 2.0 g/m2. When the dried adhesion<br>
amount of the cationic organic compound is less than 0.3 g/m2, the image<br>
density may not be sufficiently improved and the occurrence of feathering<br>
may not be prevented.<br>
The surfactant is not particularly limited and can be appropriately<br>
selected in accordance with the purpose. It can be selected from any one<br>
of anionic surfactants, cationic surfactants, ampholytic surfactants and<br>
nonionic surfactants. Among those, the nonionic surfactants are<br>
particularly preferable. By adding the surfactant, the water resistance<br>
of the image can be enhanced, the image density can be improved and<br>
occurrence of bleeding can be prevented.<br>
Examples of the nonionic surfactants include higher alcohol ethylene<br>
oxide adducts, alkylphenol ethylene oxide adducts, fatty acid ethylene<br>
oxide adducts, polyvalent alcohol fatty acid ester ethylene oxide adducts,<br>
higher aliphatic amine ethylene oxide adducts, fatty acid amide ethylene<br>

the sub-tanks 135 through ink supplying tubes (not shown).<br>
As a means to supply paper 142 loaded on a paper loading section (or<br>
a pressuring plate) 141 which is located at the copy receiving tray 103,<br>
emilunar rollers (or paper supply rollers 143) and a separation pad 144<br>
are provided. The paper supply rollers 143 are to separate and feed a<br>
sheet of paper one-by-one from loaded paper 142. The separation pad<br>
144 is facing the paper supply rollers 143 and composed of a material<br>
having a large friction coefficient. The separation pad 144 is biased<br>
toward the paper supply rollers 143.<br>
Paper 142 supplied by the means to supply paper is fed under the<br><br>
recording head 134 with the following means; a feeing belt 151 for feeding<br>
paper 142 by electrostatic absorption; a counter roller 152 for feeding<br>
paper 142 from the means through a guide 145 by sandwiching paper<br>
with the feeding belt 151; a feeding guide 153 for rotating fed paper 90° so<br>
that its longitudinal direction is changed from substantially<br>
perpendicularly to parallel to the direction of feeding belt 151; and a<br>
tip-pressurizing roller 155 which is a part of pressuring section 154 and<br>
provided on the feeding belt 151. The feeding belt 151 is provided with a<br>
charge roller 156 as a charging unit for charging the surface of the belt.<br>
The feeding belt 151 is an endless belt, provided and tensioned<br>
between a feeding roller 157 and a tension roller 158, and capable of to be<br>
rotated in the paper feeding direction. The feeding belt 151 contains, for<br>
example, a resin surface layer which serves as a surface for transporting<br>
paper, has a thickness of around 40 µm and an uncontrolled resistance<br>
and is made of, for example, a copolymer of tetrafluoroethylene and<br>
ethylene, or ETFE, and a back layer (such as middle resistance layer or<br>
grounding layer) which is made of the same material as the resin surface<br>
layer and has a resistance controlled with carbon. A guide member 161<br>
corresponding to the printing region of the recording head 134 is provided<br>
on the back layer of the feeding belt 151. A separation claw 171, paper<br>
discharging rollers 172 and a paper discharging roller 173 are provided as<br>
means to discharge paper 142 on which an image has been recorded with<br>
the recording head 134. The separation claw 171 serves as a means to<br>
separate paper 142 from the feeding belt 151. And a copy receiving tray<br><br>
103 for discharged paper is provided under the paper discharging roller<br>
172.<br>
A both-sides paper feeding unit 181 is detachably attached to the<br>
backside of the body 101. The both-sides paper feeding unit 181 takes<br>
paper 142 which is returned from the feeding belt 151 by reversely<br>
rotating the belt, reverses that taken paper, and then feed the reversed<br>
paper in between the counter roller 152 and the feeding belt 151. A<br>
manual paper feeding section 182 is provided at the upper area of the<br>
both-sides paper feeding unit 181.<br>
In this inkjet recording apparatus, paper 142 is separated and fed<br>
one-by-one with the means to supply paper with its longitudinal direction<br>
directed to the substantially perpendicularly to the feeding direction,<br>
guided with the guide 145, and fed by sandwiched in between the feeding<br>
belt 151 and the counter roller 152. The edge of that paper is further<br>
guided with the feeding guide 153 to be mounted on the feeding belt 151<br>
by pressurizing it with the tip-pressurizing roller 155, and then its<br>
longitudinal direction is rotated about 90° against the feeding direction.<br>
At that time, the feeding belt 157 is charged by the charge roller 156,<br>
and paper 142 is electrostatically attached to the feeding belt 151 to be<br>
transported. The recording head 134 is driven in accordance with image<br>
signals while the carriage 133 moves, ejects ink drops onto paper 142,<br>
when whose moving is stopped to be provided with the ink drops, to<br>
record one line of letters, characters or images, and then paper 142 is fed<br>
by a predetermined distance to be ready for recording the next line. A<br><br>
recording operation is terminated when the inkjet recoding apparatus<br>
receives either a recording termination signal or a signal indicating that<br>
the bottom edge of paper 142 is reached in the recording region. Then,<br>
paper 142 is discharged to the copy receiving tray 103.<br>
When that the remaining amount of the recording ink in the sub-tank<br>
135 reaches close to empty is detected, a given amount of the recording<br>
ink is supplied from the ink cartridge 201 to the sub-tank 135.<br>
When the recording ink contained in the ink cartridge 201 of the<br>
inkjet recording apparatus is finished, only the ink bag in the ink<br>
cartridge 201 needs replacing. The ink bag can be taken out therefrom<br>
by opening the ink cartridge 201. The ink cartridge 201 can maintain its<br>
capability of stably supplying recording ink when it is vertically placed at<br>
the front area of the of the body 101. In that case, the ink cartridge 201<br>
can be easily replaced even when the space above the body 101 is not<br>
opened in its surrounding circumstance - such as when it is placed in a<br>
shelf or when something is on the body 101.<br>
