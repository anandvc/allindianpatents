				<td>METHOD OF MANUFACTURING HIGH PERFORMANCE GLASS FIBERS IN<br>
A REFRACTORY LINED MELTER AND FIBER FORMED THEREBY<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD AND INDUSTRIAL<br>
APPLICABILITY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is generally, directed to a method of manufacturing<br>
continuous glass fibers for use in high-strength applications and fibers made thereby.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The most common glass composition for making continuous glass fiber strands is<br>
"E-Glass." The liquidus temperature of E-Glass is approximately 2100° F (1149° C) or<br>
lower. One advantage of E-Glass is that its liquidus temperature allows operating<br>
temperatures for producing glass fibers to be approximately 1900° F to 2400° F (1038° C<br>
to 1316° C). The ASTM classification for E-glass fiber yarns used in printed circuit<br>
boards and aerospace applications defines the composition to be 52 to 56 weight % SiO2,<br>
16 to 25 weight % CaO, 12 to 16 weight % A12O3, 5 to 10 weight % B2O3, 0 to 5 weight %<br>
MgO, 0 to 2 weight % Na2O and K2O, 0 to 0.8 weight % TiO2, 0.05 to 0.4 weight % Fe2O3<br>
and 0 to 1.0 weight % Fluorine.<br>
Boron-free fibers are sold under the trademark ADVANTEX (Owens Corning,<br>
Toledo, Ohio, USA). Boron-Free fibers, such as are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,789,329,<br>
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, offer a significant improvement in<br>
operating temperatures over boron-containing E-glass. Boron-Free glass fibers fall under<br>
the ASTM definition for E-glass fibers for use in general-use applications.<br>
S-Glass is a family of glasses composed primarily of the oxides of magnesium,<br>
aluminum, and silicon with a chemical composition that produces glass fibers having a<br>
higher mechanical strength than E-Glass fibers. The composition for forming S-Glass<br>
includes approximately 65 weight % SiO2, 25 weight % A12O3, and 10 weight % MgO. S-<br>
glass has a composition that was originally designed to be used in high-strength<br>
applications such as ballistic armor.<br>
R-Glass is a family of glasses that are composed primarily of the oxides of silicon,<br>
aluminum, magnesium, and calcium with a chemical composition that produces glass<br>
fibers with a higher mechanical strength than E-Glass fibers. R-Glass has a composition<br>
that contains approximately 58 - 60 weight % SiO2, 23.5 - 25.5 weight % A12O3, 14-17<br><br>
weight % CaO plus MgO, 0 % B2O3, 0 % F2 and less than 2 weight % miscellaneous<br>
components. R-Glass contains more alumina and silica than E-Glass and requires higher<br>
melting and processing temperatures during fiber forming. Typically, the melting and<br>
processing temperatures for R-Glass are at least 160° C higher than those for E-Glass.<br>
This increase in processing temperature requires the use of a high-cost platinum-lined<br>
melter. In addition, the close proximity of the liquidus temperature to the forming<br>
temperature in R-Glass requires that the glass be fiberized at a viscosity lower than<br>
E-Glass, which is customarily fiberized at or near 1000 poise: Fiberizing R-Glass at the<br>
customary 1000 poise viscosity would likely result in glass devitrification, which causes<br>
process interruptions and reduced productivity.<br>
Tables IA- IE set forth the compositions for a number of conventional<br>
high-strength glass compositions.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
R-Glass and S-Glass are produced by melting the constituents of the compositions<br>
in a platinum-lined melting container. The costs of forming R-Glass and S-Glass fibers<br>
are dramatically higher than E-Glass fibers due to the cost of producing the fibers in such<br>
melters. Thus, there is a need in the art for methods of forming glass compositions useful<br><br>
in the formation of high performance glass fibers from a direct-melt process in a<br>
refractory-lined furnace and fibers formed by the method.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention, in part, is a method of manufacturing a glass composition for the<br>
formation of continuous glass fibers that are suitable for use in high-strength applications.<br>
The composition useful in the present invention may be inexpensively formed into glass<br>
fibers using low-cost, direct melting in refractory-lined furnaces due to the relatively low<br>
fiberizing temperature of the glass fibers. Once formed into fibers, the glass composition<br>
provides the strength characteristics of higher-priced glass fibers such as S-Glass. The<br>
composition of the present invention includes about 60.5 to about 70.5 weight % SiO2,<br>
about 10.0 to about 24.5 weight % A12O3, about 6.0 to about 20.0 weight % RO, where RO<br>
equals the sum of MgO, CaO, SrO and BaO, and about 0.0 to about 3.0 weight % alkali<br>
metal oxides. In a preferred embodiment, the glass composition is composed of about 61<br>
to about 68 weight % SiO2, about 15 to about 19 weight % A12O3, about 15 to about 20<br>
weight % RO, where RO equals the sum of MgO, CaO, SrO and BaO, and about 0 to<br>
about 3 weight % alkali metal oxides. The composition preferably does not contain more<br>
than about 4 weight % of oxides or halogens selected from the group consisting of ZnO,<br>
SO3, Fluorine, B2O3, TiO2, ZrO2 and Fe2O3. The desired properties of the high<br>
performance composite fibers manufactured by the present invention include a fiberizing<br>
temperature of less than about 2650 ° F and a liquidus temperature that is preferably below<br>
the fiberizing temperature by at least about 80° F, more preferably by at least about 120° F,<br>
and most preferably by at least about 150° F.<br>
The present invention includes a process for producing refined glass from a raw<br>
glass batch in a refractory lined glass melter. The process includes charging a raw glass<br>
batch to a melting zone of a glass melter, melts the raw glass batch within the melting<br>
zone and forming fibers from the melt. The present invention also includes fibers formed<br>
by such a method<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION AND PREFERRED<br>
EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Fiberizing properties of the glass composition used to form the glass fibers utilized<br>
in the method of the present invention include the fiberizing temperature, the liquidus, and<br>
delta-T. The fiberizing temperature is defined as the temperature that corresponds to a<br>
viscosity of about 1000 Poise. As discussed in more detail below, a lowered fiberizing<br>
temperature reduces the production cost of the fibers, allows for a longer bushing life,<br>
increases throughput, permits the glass to be melted in a refractory-lined melter, and<br>
reduces energy usage. For example, at a lower fiberizing temperature, a bushing operates<br>
at a cooler temperature and does not "sag" as quickly. Sag is a phenomenon that occurs in<br>
bushings that are held at an elevated temperature for extended periods of time. By<br>
lowering the fiberizing temperature, the sag rate of the bushing may be reduced and the<br>
bushing life can be increased. In addition, a lower fiberizing temperature allows for a<br>
higher throughput since more glass can be melted in a given period at a given energy<br>
input. As a result, production cost is reduced. In addition, a lower fiberizing temperature<br>
will also permit glass formed with the inventive composition to be melted in a refractory-<br>
lined melter since both its melting and fiberizing temperatures are below the upper use<br>
temperatures of many commercially available refractories.<br>
The liquidus is defined as the highest temperature at which equilibrium exists<br>
between liquid glass and its primary crystalline phase. At all temperatures above the<br>
liquidus, the glass is free from crystals in its primary phase. At temperatures below the<br>
liquidus, crystals may form.<br><br>
Another fiberizing property is delta-T (AT), which is defined as the difference<br>
between the fiberizing temperature and the liquidus. A larger AT offers a greater degree<br>
of flexibility during the formation of the glass fibers and helps to inhibit devitrification of<br>
the glass (that is, the formation of crystals within the melt) during melting and fiberizing.<br>
Increasing the AT also reduces the production cost of the glass fibers by allowing for a<br>
greater bushing life and by providing a wider process window for forming fibers.<br>
The glasses of the present invention are suitable for melting in traditional<br>
commercially available refractory-lined glass melters which are widely used in the<br>
manufacture of glass reinforcement fibers. Starting batch components typically include<br>
SiO2 (ground silica sand), and Al2O3 (calcined alumina), as well as chain modifiers from<br>
source materials such as MgCO3 (magnesite), CaCO3 (limestone), SrCO3 (strontianite),<br>
BaCO3 (witherite), ZrSiO4 (zircon), and Na2CO3 (natrite).<br>
FIGS 1-4 depict a glass melting furnace 10 useful in the method of forming the<br>
glass fibers described herein and set forth in the examples and claims below. The glass<br>
melting furnace 10 provides molten glass to a glass forehearth 12. The molten glass is<br>
preferably composed of about 60.5 to about 70.5 weight percent SiO2, about 10.0 to about<br>
24.5 weight percent Al2O3, about 6.0 to about 20.0 weight percent RO, where RO equals<br>
the sum of MgO, CaO, and SrO, and about 0.0 to about 3.0 weight percent alkali metal<br>
oxides. A fiber formed in accordance with the present invention will typically include<br>
small amounts of ZnO, SO3, Fluorine, B2O3, TiO2 and Fe2O3, preferably in an amount of<br>
less than about 4 weight percent. In addition, a fiber formed in accordance with the<br>
method and composition of the present invention will preferably having a fiberizing<br>
temperature of less than about 2650° F, a-ΔT of at least about 80° F, preferably a ΔT of at<br>
least about 120° F, and most preferably a ΔT of at least about 150° F, and a coefficient of<br>
thermal expansion (CTE) of about 2.28x10-6 in/in/° F to about 2.77 x10-6 in/in/° F. Further,<br>
the glass fibers manufactured by the method of the present invention preferably have a<br>
strength in excess of about 600 KPSI, preferably a strength in excess of about 630 KPSI,<br>
and most preferably a strength in excess of about 695 KPSI. Further, the glass fibers will<br>
desirably have a modulus greater than about 12.0 MPSI, preferably greater then about<br>
12.18 MPSI, and most preferably greater then about 12.6 MPSI. It will be appreciated that<br>
certain details of construction are not provided in view of such details being conventional<br>
and well within the skill of the art.<br><br>
The method of the present invention is preferably performed using the glass<br>
melting furnace 10, which includes an elongated channel having an upstream end wall<br>
14a, a downstream end wall 16, side walls 18, a floor 20, and a roof 22. Each of the<br>
components of the glass melting furnace 10 are made from appropriate refractory<br>
materials such as alumina, chromic oxide, silica, alumina-silica, zircon, zirconia-alumina-<br>
silica, or similar oxide-based refractory materials. The roof 22 is shown generally as<br>
having an arcuate shape transverse to the longitudinal axis of the composition the channel;<br>
however, the roof may have any suitable design. The roof 22 is typically positioned<br>
between about 3-10 feet above the surface of the glass batch composition 30. The glass<br>
batch material 30 is a mixture of raw materials used in the manufacture of glass in the<br>
accordance with the present invention. The glass melting furnace 10 may optionally<br>
include one more bubblers 24 and/or electrical boost electrodes (not shown). The bubblers<br>
24 and/or electrical boost electrodes increase the temperature of the bulk glass and<br>
increase the molten glass circulation under the batch cover.<br>
In addition, the glass melting furnace 10 may include two successive zones, an<br>
upstream melting zone 26 and a downstream refining zone 28. In the melting zone 26, the<br>
glass batch composition 30 may be charged into the furnace using a charging device 32 of<br>
a type well-known in the art.<br>
In one suitable melter configuration, the glass batch material 30 forms a batch<br>
layer of solid particles on the surface of the molten glass in the melting zone 26 of the<br>
glass melting furnace 10. The floating solid batch particles of the glass batch composition<br>
30 are at least partially melted by at least one burner 34 having a controlled flame shape<br>
and length mounted within the roof 22 of, the glass melting furnace 10.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, as shown in FIG. 1, the glass melting furnace 10<br>
includes three burners 34. A single burner 34 is positioned upstream of two adjacently<br>
positioned downstream burners 34. However, it will be appreciated that any number of<br>
burners 34 may be positioned at any suitable location in the roof 22 of the furnace 10 over<br>
the batch to melt the glass batch composition 30. For example, two burners 34 may be<br>
positioned in a side-by-side relationship (FIG. 3) or a single burner may be used (FIG. 4).<br>
Other conventional melters may be used without departing from the present<br>
invention. Conventional melters include Air-Gas melters, Oxygen-Gas melters,<br>
electrically fired melters, or any fossil fuel fired melter. It is possible to add electric boost<br>
or bubblers to any of the melting processes. It is also possible to include a separate<br><br>
refining zone (as shown in FIG.1 or incorporate the refining zone into the main tank of the<br>
melter.<br>
As shown in FIG. 5, a bushing assembly 100 includes a bushing 110 and a bushing<br>
frame 210. The bushing 110 includes a bushing main body 120 with sidewalls 122 and a<br>
tip plate 124 extending between the sidewalls 122. The main body 120 is positioned<br>
below a bushing block 300 that, in turn, is positioned beneath a forehearth 310. In<br>
practicing the method of the present invention, a stream of molten glass is received by the<br>
main body 120 from the forehearth 310. The forehearth 310 receives the molten glass<br>
from a melter 10 (shown in FIG. 1). A delivery channel 40 is positioned between the<br>
melter 10 and the forehearth 310 to deliver the molten glass batch composition 30 from the<br>
melter 10 to the forehearth 310. The forehearth 310 and bushing block 300 may be<br>
conventional in construction and may be formed from refractory materials.<br>
The tip plate 124 contains a plurality of nozzles 124a (also referred to herein as<br>
orifices) through which a plurality of streams of molten glass may be discharged. The<br>
streams of molten material may be mechanically drawn from the tip plate 124 to form<br>
continuous filaments 125 via a conventional winder device 400. The filaments 125 may<br>
be gathered into a single continuous strand 125a after having received a protective coating<br>
of a sizing composition from a sizing applicator 410. The continuous filaments 125a may<br>
be wound onto a rotating collet 402 of the winder device 400 to form a package 125b. The<br>
continuous filaments 125 may also be processed into other desired composite glass<br>
materials including, without limitation, wet used chopped strand fibers, dry use chopped<br>
strand fibers, continuous filament mats, chopped strand mats, wet formed mats or air laid<br>
mats.<br>
Having generally described this invention, a further understanding can be obtained<br>
by reference to certain specific examples illustrated below which are provided for<br>
purposes of illustration only and are not intended to be all inclusive or limiting unless<br>
otherwise specified.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The glasses in the examples listed in Tables IIA - IIC were melted in platinum<br>
crucibles or in a continuous platinum-lined melter for determining the mechanical and<br>
physical properties of the glass and fibers produced therefrom. The units of measurement<br>
for the physical properties are: Viscosity (° F), Liquidus temperature (°F) and ΔT (°F). In<br><br>
some examples the glasses were fiberized/and Strength (KPsi), Density (g/cc), Modulus<br>
(MPsi), Softening Point (° F) and coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) (in/in/(° F))<br>
were measured.<br>
The fiberizing temperature was measured using a rotating spindle viscometer. The<br>
fiberizing viscosity is defined as 1000 Poise. The liquidus was measured by placing a<br>
platinum container filled with glass in a thermal gradient furnace for 16 hours. The<br>
greatest temperature at which crystals were present was considered the liquidus<br>
temperature. The modulus was measured using the sonic technique on a single fiber of<br>
glass. The tensile strength was measured on a pristine single fiber. The CTE was<br>
measured with a dilatometer over the range of temperature from 25 to 600 degrees C. The<br>
softening point temperature was measured using the ASTM C338 fiber-elongation<br>
method.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
As is understood in the art, the above exemplary inventive compositions do not<br>
always total 100% of the listed components due to statistical conventions (such as,<br>
rounding and averaging) and the fact that some compositions may include impurities that<br>
are not listed. Of course, the actual amounts of all components, including any impurities,<br>
in a composition always total 100%. Furthermore, it should be understood that where<br>
small quantities of components are specified in the compositions, for example, quantities<br>
on the order of about 0.05 weight percent or less, those components may be present in the<br>
form of trace impurities present in the raw materials, rather than intentionally added.<br>
Additionally, components may be added to the batch composition, for example, to<br>
facilitate processing, that are later eliminated, thereby forming a glass composition that is<br>
essentially free of such components. Thus, for instance, minute quantities of components<br>
such as fluorine and sulfate may be present as trace impurities in the raw materials<br>
providing the silica, calcia, alumina, and magnesia components in commercial practice of<br>
the invention or they may be processing aids that are essentially removed during<br>
manufacture.<br><br>
As apparent from the above examples, glass fiber compositions of the invention<br>
have advantageous properties, such as low fiberizing temperatures and wide differences<br>
between the liquidus temperatures and the fiberizing temperatures (high AT values).<br>
Other advantages and obvious modifications of the invention will be apparent to the<br>
artisan from the above description and further through practice of the invention). The<br>
high-performance glass of the present invention melts and refines at relatively low<br>
temperatures, has a workable viscosity over a wide range of relatively low temperatures,<br>
and a low liquidus temperature range.<br>
The invention of this application has been described above both generically and<br>
with regard to specific embodiments. Although the invention has been set forth in what is<br>
believed to be the preferred embodiments, a wide variety of alternatives known to those of<br>
skill in the art can be selected within the generic disclosure. Other advantages and<br>
obvious modifications of the invention will be apparent to the artisan from the above<br>
