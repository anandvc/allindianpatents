				<td>BRUSHLESS DIRECT CURRENT MOTOR<br>
The invention relates to a brushless direct current motor comprising a rotor equipped with<br>
permanent magnets rotating in the magnetic field of a stator which alternates by way of<br>
commutation, which magnetic field can be created by a coil system of wire coils, provided on an<br>
insulating body in the circumferential direction and at a distance from each other, with a control<br>
system being provided to control the electric wire coils of the coil system, spaced apart from<br>
each other and provided inside the stator, allocated to the phases of the non-contact rotary-<br>
position sensors allocated to the coil system.<br>
It is already known to use brushless direct current motors as pump drives. Such brushless direct<br>
current motors are characterized in high effectiveness; while electric motors with brushes only<br>
have a life of 3000 to 4000 operating hours, the life of brushless electric motors is considerably<br>
longer. Due to the fact that the rotary impulses in brushless electric motors are introduced<br>
electronically such brushless direct current motors are almost completely free from wear and<br>
tear. Additionally, such direct current motors may be adjusted to the amperage of the national<br>
power grid using an integrated power supply.<br>
The brushless direct current motors of prior art usually operate with Hall sensors, which detect<br>
the rotor position such that the commutation of the electric motor can occur at the correct time.<br>
The torque of brushless direct current motors largely depends on the control of the Hall sensors<br>
used to control the stator coils are optimally positioned in reference to the rotor and the<br>
controlled coils. In the brushless direct current motors of prior art the Hall sensors are usually<br>
adhered to the stator at the predetermined positions, with the electric contacts of the hall sensors<br>
have to be soldered to the control electronic. The alignment, the adhesion, and the soldering of<br>
the hall sensors require considerable expenses, though.<br>
Therefore the object is to provide a brushless direct current motor of the type mentioned at the<br>
outset that can be produced cost-effectively with comparatively little expense.<br>
The object is attained according to the invention in the direct current motor of the type<br>
mentioned at the outset particularly in that the sensors for the rotary position are arranged on a<br>
sensor carrier, that the sensor carrier can be fastened at least at one face of the stator, and that<br>
positioning aids are arranged between the at least one sensor carrier and the adjacent stator face,<br>
cooperating with each other, which determine the relative position of the stator in reference to<br>
the at least one sensor carrier and the rotary position sensors arranged thereupon.<br>
The direct current motor according to the invention comprises a sensor carrier, on which the<br>
rotary position sensors of the control electronics are arranged. One such sensor carrier can be<br>
fastened at least at one face of the stator. Here, positioning aids cooperating with each other are<br>
provided between the at least one sensor carrier and the adjacent stator face, which positioning<br>
aids determine the relative position of the stator in reference to the at least one stator carrier and<br>
the rotary position sensors arranged thereupon. Due to the fact that therefore a manual alignment<br>
of the rotary positioning sensors in reference to the stator, the adhesion of said rotary position<br>
sensor inside the stator, and the soldering of the rotary position sensors to the other electric parts<br>
of the direct current motor are avoided, the direct current motor according to the invention can be<br>
produced with little expense, and this direct current motor, due to the always precise alignment<br>
of the rotary position sensors in reference to the wire coils provided at the stator, is characterized<br>
by a correspondingly high torque.<br>
In order to facilitate the connection of the rotary position sensors to the other electric parts of the<br>
direct current motor according to the invention it is particularly advantageous for at least one<br>
sensor carrier to be embodied as a sensor board carrying rotary position sensors.<br>
The rotary position sensors allocated to the control electronic may be arranged on different<br>
sensor carriers and there electrically connected to each other, with the sensor carriers may each<br>
be fastened at one of the two faces of the stator. In order to even further reduce the expense<br>
connected to the production of the direct current motor according to the invention it is<br>
particularly advantageous when the rotary position sensors allocated to the phases of the coil<br>
system are arranged on a common sensor plate.<br>
The low production expense additionally benefits from the control electronics being connected to<br>
the supply lines of the wire coils, spaced apart from each other, using electric contacts embodied<br>
as positioning aids.<br>
Here, the electric contacts embodied as positioning aids may be provided on the at least one<br>
sensor carrier and/or the stator.<br>
However, a preferred embodiment according to the invention provides for the contacts serving as<br>
positioning aids and provided on the at least one sensor carrier being embodied as cutting<br>
terminals. Without any additional expensive soldering process and perhaps even without any<br>
insulation of the electric wires, the cutting terminals provided at the sensor carrier may be<br>
connected to the other electric components of the direct current motor according to the invention<br>
by a simple plug connection.<br>
Here, a precisely positioned alignment of the stator, on the one side, and the sensor carrier with<br>
the rotary position sensor located thereupon, on the other side, is facilitated when the supply<br>
lines of the wire coils, spaced apart from each other, are held in the wire guides of the stator,<br>
defined in their position, by wire sections contacting the cutting terminals.<br>
A preferred further development according to the invention provides that each wire guide<br>
exhibits guide openings intersecting each other, with one guide opening thereof serving to accept<br>
a wire section contacting the cutting terminal and another guide opening, that is open at the face,<br>
serving to introduce one cutting terminal each.<br>
The supply lines allocated to the wire coils, spaced apart from each other, can be guided in a<br>
particularly easy fashion in the area of the stator housing and the sensor carrier can be fastened at<br>
the stator face with little expense when the guide openings of each wire guide, provided to<br>
receive the wire sections and/or to introduce the cutting terminals, are embodied in a slot-shaped<br>
fashion.<br>
A preferred embodiment according to the invention provides, at least at one face allocated to the<br>
sensor carrier, for the stator to comprise protrusions embodied in a crown-shaped fashion, with at<br>
least some protrusions being embodied as wire guides. By a meandering arrangement of the<br>
supply lines allocated to the wire coils, spaced apart from each other, around the individual<br>
protrusions the electric wires can be guided along the perimeter of the stator. When at least<br>
individual protrusions as well as wire guides are provided, the sensor carrier may be fastened at<br>
the stator in a simple fashion and simultaneously precisely positioned, with simultaneously the<br>
electric connection being created between the control electronic, on the one side, and the other<br>
electric parts of the direct current motor according to the invention, on the other side.<br>
An automated production process is promoted when the stator comprises a sheath-like stator<br>
housing, with one insulation cap being provided at each face, with at least one insulating cap<br>
being embodied to connect to a sensor carrier and with the insulating caps provided at both sides<br>
of the stator carrying between each other the wire, spaced apart from each other, of the multi-<br>
phase coil system allocated to the stator.<br>
Additional features of the invention are discernible from the claims in connection with the<br>
drawings and the description. In the following the invention is described in greater detail using a<br>
preferred exemplary embodiment:<br>
Shown in schematic illustration are:<br>
Fig. 1 the components of the stator of a brushless direct current motor shown in an<br>
exploded perspective illustration,<br>
Fig. 2 the stator housing of the direct current motor shown in Fig. 1 serving as the stator<br>
package, with the stator housing comprising grooves at its interior perimeter of the<br>
housing, separated from each other by coil protrusions projecting radially inwardly, each<br>
separated from each other by a groove insulation inserted into the grooves,<br>
Fig. 3 the stator housing of the stator shown in Figs. 1 and 2 carrying the groove insulations,<br>
with insulation caps being provided at the two faces of the stator housing and with one of<br>
the insulation caps can be connected to a sensor carrier,<br>
Fig. 4 the stator housing of the stator shown in Figs. 1 through 3, already preassembled to a<br>
stator package, with a sensor carrier fastenable at one of the faces of the stator, at which<br>
rotary position sensors project in the direction towards the stator,<br>
Fig. 5 the sensor carrier of Fig. 4 in a partially longitudinal cross-sectioned area of a cutting<br>
terminal serving as a positioning aid,<br>
Fig. 6 the sensor carrier of Figs. 4 and 5 in a partially cross-sectioned area of a cutting terminal.<br>
Fig. 7 the stator of Figs. 1 through 4 immediately prior to the precisely positioned plug<br>
connection of the sensor carrier being made,<br>
Fig. 8 the stator of a brushless direct current motor in an assembled state,<br>
Fig. 9 the coil system of the stator shown in Figs. 1 through 4 and 7 through 8 in a schematic<br>
illustration, and<br>
Fig. 10 the coil system of the wire coils provided in the stator and spaced apart from each other,<br>
also in a schematic illustration.<br>
Fig. 8 shows the stator 1 of a brushless direct current motor in a perspective illustration, with<br>
said direct current motor being useable, for example, as a pump drive, particularly for a<br>
diaphragm pump. The direct current motor is here allocated to a rotor, not shown in greater<br>
detail, which carries permanent magnets at its outer perimeter. The rotor is driven by way of<br>
commutation, i.e. the change of the direction of flow of the alternating magnetic field of the<br>
circular stator 1, with the rotor rotating inside the circularly surrounding stator 1. The magnetic<br>
field can be created by a multi-phase coil system 2 with wire coils 3 spaced apart from each other<br>
in the circumferential direction, which are wound onto an insulating body, in its entirety marked<br>
4.<br>
Control electronics are provided to control the wire coils of the wire system, spaced apart from<br>
each other and provided in the stator, comprising non-contact rotary position sensors 5 allocated<br>
to the phases of the coil system 2. These rotary position sensors 5 may be embodied as Hall<br>
sensors, for example.<br>
Figs. 1 through 7 shows the individual production steps for producing the stator 1 shown in Fig.<br>
8. The insulating body of the stator 1, in its entirety marked 4, comprises a solid, sheath-like<br>
stator housing 20, which carries coil protrusions 6 at its interior housing perimeter, which delimit<br>
the grooves 7 oriented in the longitudinal direction therebetween. The interior wall perimeter<br>
delimiting the grooves 7 is coated by a groove insulation 8, arranged in the grooves 7. Circular<br>
insulation caps 9 are put onto the faces of the stator housing 20, which show bag-shaped recesses<br>
10 at the interior side of the perimeter in the area of the grooves 7 and the groove insulation 8.<br>
These recesses 10 of the insulation caps 9 are also separated by coil protrusions 11, spaced apart<br>
from each other at the perimeter of the interior wall. The rotary position sensors 12 are arranged<br>
on a sensor carrier 13 and project in the direction towards the stator 1.<br>
The rotary position sensors 5 are arranged on a sensor carrier 13 and project in the direction<br>
towards the stator 1. The sensor carrier 13 is embodied as a sensor plate, preferably carrying all<br>
of the rotary position sensors 5. Positioning aids cooperating with each other are provided<br>
between the at least one sensor carrier 13 and the adjacent stator face, which determine the<br>
relative position of the stator 1 in reference to the sensor carrier 13 and the rotary position<br>
sensors 5 arranged thereupon.<br>
In the exploded illustration of the stator 1 for a brushless direct current motor in Fig. 4 it is easily<br>
discernible that the wire coils 3, spaced apart from each other, are wound inside the groove<br>
insulations 8 around the coil protrusions 6,11 projecting on the one side at the insulation caps 9<br>
and on the other side at the interior circumference of the stator housing 2.<br>
It is illustrated in Figs. 4 through 7 that the part of the control electronics located on the sensor<br>
carrier 13 and surrounding the rotary position sensors 5 is connected to the supply lines 15 of the<br>
wire coils 3, spaced apart from each other, via electric contacts embodied as positioning aids.<br>
Here, the electric contacts embodied as positioning aids are provided on the sensor carrier 13. In<br>
Figs. 5 and 6 it is discernible that the contacts provided at the sensor carriers 13 and serving as<br>
positioning aids are here embodied as cutting terminals 14.<br>
Figs. 5 and 6 show that the supply lines 15 of the wire coils 3, spaced apart from each other, are<br>
held by the wire sections contacting the cutting terminals 14 in wire guides 16 of the stator 1 in a<br>
defined position. Here, each wire guide 16 comprises guide openings 17, 18 embodied in a slot-<br>
shaped fashion and intersecting each other, with one guide opening 17 serving to accept a wire<br>
section contacting the cutting terminal 14 and with another one representing another guide<br>
opening 18, open at the face, for inserting a cutting terminal 14. Fig. 7 shows that by a simple<br>
plug connection of the cutting terminals 14. projecting from the sensor carrier 13, onto the wire<br>
guides 16 of the stator 1 and by inserting said cutting terminals 14 into the guide slots 17<br>
provided at the wire guides 16 they can be connected to the stator 1 in a simple fashion and<br>
electrically contacting.<br>
Here, it is discernible from figures 4 and 7 that the stator at least at one face comprises crown-<br>
shaped protrusions 16, 19 allocated to the sensor carrier 13, with at least individual protrusions<br>
being embodied as wire guides 16.<br>
By the meandered winding around these crown-shaped protrusions 16, 19, illustrated in Fig. 9,<br>
the wire coils 3, spaced apart from each other and allocated to the supply lines 15, can be<br>
securely and easily arranged at the housing perimeter of the stator 1.<br>
The stator 1 shown here comprises a sheath-like stator housing 20 with insulating caps 9 being<br>
provided at its faces. Here, the insulating cap 9 allocated to the sensor carrier 13 is embodied for<br>
connecting to the sensor carrier 13, with the insulating caps 9 provided at both sides of the stator<br>
1 carry the wire coils 3 of the stator 1, spaced apart from each other and allocated to the multi-<br>
phase coil system 2.<br>
By the use of the insulating caps 9 provided at both sides of the stator faces, a fully automated<br>
winding process is ensured during the production of the stator 1. Using the cutting terminals 14<br>
provided at the sensor carrier 13 and serving as positioning aids, an isolation of the wire ends<br>
allocated to the wire coils 3 can be omitted. Any soldering of the control electronic in the area of<br>
the rotary position sensors 5 is no longer necessary, either, because the electric contact can be<br>
achieved without soldering by a plug connection using the cutting terminals 14. Due to the fact<br>
that the rotary position sensors are protruding from the sensor carrier 13 in their correct position<br>
no additional fastening material is necessary to allow fastening the rotary position sensors 12 at<br>
their correct position in the area of the stator 1.<br>
The stator 1 shown here and intended for a brushless direct current motor can therefore be<br>
produced cost-effectively in an automated production process in a simple fashion.<br>
