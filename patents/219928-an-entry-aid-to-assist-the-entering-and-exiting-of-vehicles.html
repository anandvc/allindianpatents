Retractable step<br>
The invention relates to what is referred to as a<br>
retractable step. A retractable step is understood as<br>
meaning an entry aid for assisting the entering and<br>
exiting of vehicles, particularly rail vehicles, with a<br>
surface which can be walked upon being extended from<br>
the vehicle essentially in a linear direction in order<br>
to bridge the gap between the vehicle and the platform<br>
or the like.<br>
Depending in each case on the positioning between the<br>
vehicle box body and the platform, the retractable<br>
step, generally toward the end of its extension<br>
movement, comes into the region of the platform and<br>
there is the risk in this case of it moving laterally<br>
into the essentially vertically extending platform<br>
wall. This problem is overcome by means of sensors in<br>
the region of the leading edge of the retractable step.<br>
Another problem is that, in the case of an extended<br>
retractable step, a change in height of the retractable<br>
step may occur during the time the vehicle spends in<br>
the station. This may take place within a short period<br>
by the suspension yielding, by the vehicle load<br>
changing as passengers get in and out, by the wind load<br>
stressing changing, and by more of the same sort of<br>
reasons. The greatest possible change in height is<br>
defined here by various parameters of the vehicle (type<br>
of suspension, position of the stops, length of the<br>
lever arms of the retractable step relative to the<br>
pivot axis, etc. ) and is called maximum change in<br>
height below. The actual change in the height position<br>
within the context of this maximum change in height may<br>
result in luggage or passengers becoming trapped, or<br>
the retractable step being damaged if the retractable<br>
step is correspondingly lowered. Since the objects at<br>
risk generally do not extend over the entire width of<br><br>
WO 2004/085222	PCT/EP2004/001667<br>
- 2 -<br>
the retractable step and it cannot be predicted in<br>
which region of the retractable step they are located,<br>
detection has hitherto been impossible and the risk of<br>
body parts or objects becoming trapped or of the<br>
retractable step becoming damaged has had to be<br>
accepted.<br>
The invention aims to change this and to specify a<br>
device with which it is possible to carry out a<br>
detection of this type in a satisfactory and cost-<br>
effective manner.<br>
According to the invention, this is achieved in that a<br>
strip is connected movably to the retractable step,<br>
said strip extending essentially over the entire length<br>
of the retractable step and, in the activated state,<br>
being located essentially under the front edge of the<br>
retractable step, and by at least one sensor being<br>
provided which detects the position of the strip and/or<br>
the force transmitted by the strip to the retractable<br>
step.<br>
As a result, every impermissible approach toward the<br>
upper side of the platform can be detected as can the<br>
imminent risk of an object or body part becoming<br>
trapped. The positioning of the strip makes it<br>
possible, during the extension of the retractable step,<br>
also to detect the space (detection space) in which<br>
during the lowering operation, the retractable step<br>
could move, for example for one of the abovementioned<br>
reasons, and thus makes it possible to safeguard it.<br>
The activated state is taken up by the strip at least<br>
during the extension of the retractable step.<br>
The movable connection between strip and retractable<br>
step makes it possible to bring the strip into the<br>
desired position, if appropriate automatically, during<br><br>
WO 2004/085222	PCT/EP2004/001667<br>
- 3 -<br>
the extension of the retractable step. The monitoring<br>
of this position remains activated during the extension<br>
of the retractable step into its end position.<br>
If a change in the position of the strip is detected,<br>
the extension movement is stopped and the retractable<br>
step is moved back by a predetermined length by which a<br>
safe distance from the object is ensured. In addition,<br>
for example, an acoustic and/or optical alarm signal<br>
may be emitted. Of course, a different reaction is<br>
possible if this is desired by the operator.<br>
The strip itself may either execute an extension<br>
movement which is oblique with respect to the direction<br>
of extension of the retractable step but is essentially<br>
linear; it may also execute a rotational movement and<br>
be swung out, as it were.<br>
Depending in each case on the design and movement of<br>
the strip, a very wide variety of sensors, which can be<br>
designed as switches or strain gauges or are based on<br>
an electrodynamic or piezoelectric effect, are suitable<br>
as the actual sensor. The sensors may be arranged<br>
either directly in the strip and measure the force<br>
between underlying surface and strip, or they are<br>
accommodated in the region of the bearings of the strip<br>
and measure the forces between strip and retractable<br>
step, which forces originate from the first-mentioned<br>
forces.<br>
The transition of the strip from the passive position<br>
into the active position can take place by means of the<br>
dead weight of the strip, a slotted-guide mechanism and<br>
possibly a spring. Of course, it is also possible to<br>
provide a motor drive.<br>
In order to reach the objective of the invention and in<br><br>
WO 2004/085222	PCT/EP2004/001667<br>
-4-<br>
particular if the retractable step is to be retracted<br>
if a trapping risk is established, it is favorable<br>
that, during this retraction movement, the strip<br>
releases any objects already trapped as rapidly as<br>
possible without further loading and does not trap and<br>
keep hold of them.<br>
The invention is explained in more detail below with<br>
reference to the drawing, in which<br>
fig.  1 shows a front view of an entry aid designed<br>
according to the invention,<br>
fig.  2  shows a purely diagrammatic section  in the<br>
direction of the arrow II of fig. 1,<br>
fig. 3 shows a variant of a retractable step similar to<br>
that of fig. 2, on an enlarged scale,<br>
fig.  4  shows a view similar to  fig.  3 of another<br>
variant of the invention, and<br>
fig. 5 shows the variant of the invention according to<br>
fig. 4 in a different position between the vehicle and<br>
the platform.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a vehicle 1 with a two-wing door 2 and a<br>
retractable step 3. The "detection space" 4, i.e. that<br>
space which is to be monitored by the device according<br>
to the invention for risk of collision or trapping<br>
during the extension of the retractable step, is<br>
illustrated below the retractable step 3 by dashed<br>
lines.<br>
The positioning and significance of this detection<br>
space 4 are apparent from putting figs 1 and 2<br>
together: fig. 2 shows a platform 5 as it is intended<br>
normally to extend with its surface and its side wall<br>
in relation to the vehicle 1. Between the platform 5<br>
and the vehicle 1 there is unavoidably a gap 6,<br>
precisely the gap which in many cases, if platforms in<br>
curved track sections in the case of rail vehicles are<br><br>
WO 2004/085222	PCT/EP2004/001667<br>
- 5 -<br>
considered, may also be significantly wider than in the<br>
exemplary embodiment shown and for the safe overcoming<br>
or overclimbing of which the retractable step 3 is<br>
provided.<br>
Fig. 3 shows the situation in the region of the<br>
platform 5 on an enlarged scale, but likewise entirely<br>
schematically. In the exemplary embodiment shown, the<br>
strip 7 provided according to the invention comprises a<br>
rotatable flap which extends over the entire length L<br>
(fig. 1) of the retractable step 3 and is located<br>
essentially precisely below the leading edge 8 of the<br>
retractable step 3, when said flap is extended in its<br>
activated position, as illustrated in fig. 3.<br>
The dashed line below the retractable step 3 again<br>
indicates the detection space 4, i.e. the space over<br>
which the lower edge 9 of the strip 7 brushes during<br>
its extension in the direction A of the double arrow<br>
E-A. If, during the extension operation, the strip 9<br>
impacts at any point along the length L against an<br>
object, this is established by a sensor, which is<br>
arranged, in the exemplary embodiment, in the bearing<br>
10 between the strip 7 and the retractable step 3, and<br>
the measures provided for this purpose by the operator<br>
are taken. After reaching the end position of the<br>
retractable step, the strip has to fold away and<br>
release the detection space.<br>
Fig. 4 shows, likewise purely diagrammatically, another<br>
embodiment of a strip 7'; in this example, the strip is<br>
lowered downward about a joint 10' and a sliding<br>
movement would be possible in a similar manner. The<br>
movement of the strip 7 or 7' between the active<br>
position illustrated and the position in which it is<br>
placed against the retractable step or pushed into<br>
recesses in the contour of the retractable step 3 is<br><br>
WO 2004/085222	PCT/EP2004/001667<br>
- 6 -<br>
brought about by the dead weight and/or	by assistance<br>
by means  of  spring  force;  of course,	as mentioned<br>
above, an active movement by means of a	servomotor or<br>
the like is also possible.<br>
Fig. 5 shows the situation which arises in the case of<br>
a device according to the invention according to fig. 4<br>
if even during the extension of the retractable step 3,<br>
the height position of the vehicle 1 relative to the<br>
platform upper edge 11 is too low, with the result that<br>
the strip 7' impacts with its front edge 9' against the<br>
vertical front 12 of the platform 5 below the platform<br>
upper edge 11. This is also established by the position<br>
sensor in the joint 10' and results in the specified<br>
reaction, as mentioned above. The same happens if the<br>
strip 7' impacts against a different obstacle. Instead<br>
of the position sensor in the joint 10', a force sensor<br>
may be arranged directly on the front edge 9' of the<br>
strip 7'.<br>
The invention is not restricted to the exemplary<br>
embodiments outlined and described. It is possible to<br>
design the front edges 9, 9' themselves as sensors,<br>
whether by these edges carrying profiles which are<br>
designed as electric switching strips or which are<br>
filled with gas, in which case the rising gas pressure<br>
when running onto an object is measured and<br>
established, or whether the strips 7', 7' for their part<br>
comprise two parts which are movable with respect to<br>
each other and the movement of these parts with respect<br>
to each other is used as a measure of the striking<br>
against an obstacle.<br>
It is essential that a strip 7', 7' is arranged in the<br>
region below the leading edge 8 of the retractable step<br>
3 and over the entire length 11 of the retractable<br>
step, and that the load acting on this strip in its<br><br>
WO 2004/085222	PCT/EP2004/001667<br>
- 7 -<br>
entirety and/or the position of the strip is<br>
established by means of a sensor, and that, if a<br>
speci fied value is exceeded, the movement is stopped<br>
and, if appropriate, an alarm is triggered.<br><br>
