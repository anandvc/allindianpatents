				<td>FILED OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method of imparting rotational flow of stirring<br>
gas through the tuyeres at the bottom of top-and-bottom-blown converter vessel<br>
to achieve an enhanced mixing in the bath.<br>
BACKGROUD OF INVENTION<br>
A top-and-bottom blown converter vessel (henceforth referred to as vessel) 's<br>
used for steelmaking. A reactive gas is injected into the molten metal bath<br>
(henceforth referred as bath) through a top lance to refine the metal into steel.<br>
An inert gas, generally nitrogen or argon is blown into the bath to agitate the<br>
bath, from a plurality of tuyeres arranged at the vessel bottom. The injected gas<br>
thus provides mixing in the bath to bring about homogenization of temperature<br>
and concentration. A good and fast mixing dictates the refining efficiency of the<br>
process. It has been known through several studies that the arrangement of<br>
bottom tuyeres affects the mixing in the bath.<br>
Generally, a number of tuyeres are placed on a circle perimeter placed equi-<br>
distantly from adjacent tuyeres. An equal amount of gas is injected through each<br>
tuyere. This creates distinct zone of mixing by creating a symmetry plane<br>
between the two adjacent tuyeres. Mixing in the bath is delayed by this<br>
mechanism. To enhance the mixing, the zone corresponding to each tuyere<br>
should be delayed to interact with each other.<br>
 <br>
OBJECT OF INVENTION<br>
It is therefore the object of the invention to propose a method of imparting<br>
rotational flow of stirring gas through the tuyeres at the bottom of top-anc-<br>
bottom-blown converter vessel to achieve an enhanced mixing in the bath.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
According to the invention, to achieve an enhanced mixing in the top-and-bottom<br>
blown converter vessel, the number of tuyeres and its placement on a particular<br>
pitch circle diameter remains undisturbed. It is basically the flow rate which is<br>
distributed and rotated by means of which each tuyere experience a different<br>
level of flow rates making a pulsating kind of flow through the tuyeres with<br>
respect to time. A methodology of flow distribution and its rotation both<br>
clockwise and anticlockwise with varying rotation steps is devised that provides<br>
improved and faster mixing than that of the conventional constant flow rate<br>
through each tuyere.<br>
Such a flow - distribution improves the mixing through pulsation and changing<br>
flow positions which in turn creates a driving force for energy dissipation in the<br>
bulk fluid i.e. a better distribution of energy into the bath. The rotation is<br>
imparted to each flow through tuyeres at a step size of either an angle between<br>
two consecutive tuyeres (0) or a multiple of n (where n = 1,2,3,4) in either<br>
clockwise, anticlockwise or a combination of both. Taking as an example here, an<br>
arrangement can be made with a rotation step with an alternating clockwise and<br>
anticlockwise rotation.<br>
 <br>
Thus, the subject of the present invention constitutes a method of injecting a<br>
rotational flow through the bottom tuyeres via the bottom of a top-and-bottom<br>
blown converter used for steelmaking. In the present invention, the total number<br>
of tuyeres is divided into sets of tuyeres clubbed together with a flow through<br>
them in an ascending ratio. The total flow rate through the bottom tuyeres is<br>
kept constant. Such a of flow rate distribution is termed as distributed flow with<br>
an ascending flow rate from one set to another. This primarily helps in better<br>
distribution of energy within the bath by providing an energy gradient in the bulk<br>
phase that consequently gives better mixing. An unequal amount of the stirring<br>
gas flows through each of the tuyeres in the group. Furthermore, the distributed<br>
flow through the set of tuyeres gets rotated as a function of time and step size.<br>
The stirring gas can be an inert gas, such as nitrogen or argon, or an argon<br>
mixture, i.e. argon containing a little oxygen and obtaining no other gas except<br>
as traces.<br>
According to a particular characteristic of the invention, the step size between<br>
the adjacent time steps may change. The step size can always be a different<br>
combination of the above mentioned steps. Such an arrangement of rotation<br>
brings asymmetry into the stirring system and thus adds towards better mixing.<br>
According to another characteristic of the invention, the clockwise and<br>
anticlockwise combination which brings about an imaginary impeller kind of<br>
situation as practiced in chemical reactor for better mixing. This method is very<br>
effective in creating a direction for the energy to dissipate and get distributed<br>
 <br>
and homogeniozed throughout the vessel, and in turn improving the mixing<br>
efficiency of the bath.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
The above and other objects and features of the present invention will be more<br>
fully understood by reading the following description in conjunction with<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>
Fig. 1 - is the schematic of a converter vessel bottom with tuyeres on a pitch<br>
circle diameter according to the present invention.<br>
Fig. 2 - shows positions 9-11 of tuyeres 1-8 during a typical rotation of the<br>
converter vessel according to the invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the present innovative method the total flow is distributed among a sets of<br>
tuyeres clubbed from the total number of tuyeres. To make it understandable, an<br>
example is illustrated. A set of total 8 number of tuyeres as shown in Fig. 1 have<br>
been divided into 3 groups (3+2+3). The flow through the groups would be in<br>
an increasing order. However, the total flow through all of them remains<br>
constant. Rotation imparted with a rotation step size, rotation direction and<br>
rotation number. A typical rotation step can be either 45°, 90°, 135° and 180°<br>
between two consecutive tuyeres. Rotation direction can be chosen either<br>
 <br>
clockwise, anticlockwise or a combination of the both. The switching of the<br>
rotation can be determined by a time interval termed as the rotation number.<br>
It will be understood that the type of bottom blowing through the tuyeres<br>
arrangement is accordance with present invention has many advantages, some<br>
of which it shares with other type of arrangement presently used in the steel<br>
works, and others which are special to the present invention.<br>
1.	The arrangement of flow rate through bottom tuyeres in accordance with<br>
present invention ensures a better distribution of energy ensuring efficient<br>
mixing in the bath.<br>
2.	The intensity of fluid flow shear on tuyeres is reduced as a result of<br>
rotational strategy. Consequently, life of the bottom tuyeres improves as<br>
the tuyeres wear is expected to come down.<br>
3.	Another advantage of the invention is saving in amount of the blowing<br>
gas. Lesser amount of the blowing gas would be required for the same<br>
degree of mixing efficiency as per the present invention than in case of<br>
where equal amount of gas flow through all the tuyeres.<br>
The dimension of the tuyeres can be suitably designed as per the flow rate<br>
required through tuyeres depending upon the converter capacity.<br>
 <br>
