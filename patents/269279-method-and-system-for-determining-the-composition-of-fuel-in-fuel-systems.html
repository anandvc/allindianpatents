				<td>VIRTUAL FUEL SENSOR FOR DUAL FUEL TANK APPLICATIONS<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/972,337, filed on September 14, 2007. The disclosure of the<br>
above application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The present disclosure relates to fuel systems, and more<br>
particularly to methods and systems for determining the composition of fuel in<br>
fuel systems.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
nformation related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0004] An engine may generate power by combusting an air and fuel<br>
mixture within cylinders of the engine. The fuel and air may be controlled such<br>
that the engine maintains an air-to-fuel ratio at stoichiometry. The engine may<br>
operate using fuels with different stoichiometric values, such as a gasoline and<br>
ethanol blend. As the percentage of each fuel in the overall fuel mixture<br>
changes, the stoichiometric value may change.<br>
[0005] The stoichiometric value of a fuel mixture may be measured to<br>
allow for optimal operation of the engine based on the particular fuel mixture.<br>
The engine system may change the relative amounts of air and fuel delivered to<br><br><br>
the cylinders based on the stoichiometric value for the fuel mixture. In vehicles<br>
with a single fuel tank, the fuel mixture may undergo substantial change when<br>
the vehicle is refueled, as the new fuel introduced to the fuel tank may have a<br>
different fuel mixture than the fuel originally in the fuel tank. The new fuel<br>
composition may be measured by direct measurement using a hardware sensor.<br>
[0006] The fuel mixture may also be calculated from other measured<br>
parameters and known relationships in a manner such as that described in<br>
commonly-assigned U.S. Patent No. 7,159,623 (issued January 9, 2007), the<br>
disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Exhaust sensors such<br>
as oxygen sensors may measure the content of an exhaust flow from an engine.<br>
Based on measured values, the fuel and air supplied to the engine may be<br>
adjusted, i.e., trimmed, to correct for deviations from a desired air-to-fuel ratio.<br>
These fuel trim values may be stored in a memory structure such as a plurality of<br>
closed loop correction ("CLC") cells. The stored CLC values representing fuel<br>
trim over time may be used to calculate a fuel composition.<br>
[0007] Some vehicles have more than one fuel source. Each fuel<br>
source may have a different fuel composition. The fuel sources may intermix<br>
curing vehicle operation such that the fuel mixture supplied to the engine may<br>
change multiple times during normal vehicle operation rather than upon refueling.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0008] A method comprises detecting a status of a transfer pump for<br>
transferring fuel between a first fuel source and a second fuel source; receiving a<br><br>
fuel trim value and a vehicle operating parameter; and calculating a fuel<br>
composition of one of the first fuel source and second fuel source based on the<br>
fuel trim value, the transfer pump status and the vehicle operating parameter.<br>
[0009] A control module comprises a secondary pump transfer module<br>
detecting a status of a transfer pump for transferring fuel between a first fuel<br>
source and a second fuel source; and a fuel composition estimation module in<br>
communication with the secondary pump transfer module, receiving a fuel trim<br>
value and a vehicle operating parameter, and calculating a fuel composition of<br>
one of the first fuel source and second fuel source based on the fuel trim value,<br>
the transfer pump status, and the vehicle operating parameter.<br>
[0010] Further areas of applicability of the present invention will<br>
become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be<br>
understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating<br>
the preferred embodiment of the invention, are intended for purposes of<br>
illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0011] The present invention will become more fully understood from<br>
the detailed description and the accompanying drawings, wherein:<br>
[0012] FIG. 1 is a functional block diagram of an exemplary vehicle;<br>
[0013] FIG. 2 is a functional block diagram of a control module of the<br>
exemplary vehicle;<br><br>
[0014] FIG. 3 is a flowchart illustrating the operation of a virtual fuel<br>
sensor for dual fuel tank applications.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0015] The following description of the preferred embodiment(s) is<br>
merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its<br>
application, or uses. For purposes of clarity, the same reference numbers may<br>
be used in the drawings to identify the same elements. As used herein, the term<br>
module and/or device refers to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC),<br>
an electronic circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that<br>
execute one or more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic<br>
circuit, or other suitable components that provide the described functionality.<br>
[0016] Referring now to FIG. 1, an exemplary vehicle 10 is illustrated.<br>
The exemplary vehicle 10 includes engine 12, intake manifold 14, exhaust<br>
manifold 16, fuel injectors 18, fuel rail 20, exhaust sensors 22 and 24, throttle 26,<br>
catalytic converter 28, fuel system 30, control module 40 and ignition system 44.<br>
Fuel system 30 may include primary fuel reservoir 32, primary fuel pump 34,<br>
secondary fuel reservoir 36, secondary fuel pump 38, and balance pipe 42.<br>
[0017] Primary fuel reservoir 32 and secondary fuel reservoir 36 may<br>
be connected by balance pipe 42. Balance pipe 42 may prevent primary fuel<br>
reservoir 32 from overflowing during refueling, and may balance the amount of<br>
fuel between primary fuel reservoir 32 and secondary fuel reservoir 36. Primary<br>
fuel reservoir 32 and secondary fuel reservoir may receive fuels of varied<br><br>
composition, such as fuels with varying percentages of ethanol. For example,<br>
"gasohol" may be composed of 90 percent gasoline and 10 percent ethanol and<br>
'E85" may be composed of 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent gasoline.<br>
Although ethanol and gasoline may be mentioned for example purposes, it<br>
should be recognized that other fuels may be used.<br>
[0018] Primary fuel pump 34 and secondary fuel pump 38 may be fixed<br>
displacement pumps or variable displacement pumps. Secondary fuel pump 38<br>
may provide fuel from secondary fuel reservoir 36 to primary fuel reservoir 32.<br>
For example, secondary fuel pump 38 may provide fuel to primary fuel reservoir<br>
32 when primary fuel reservoir 32 is depleted to a certain level. This depletion<br>
may occur because primary fuel pump 34 provides pressurized fuel to fuel rail 20<br>
which is drawn from primary fuel reservoir 32. As fuel injectors 18 inject fuel into<br>
the respective cylinders of engine 12, primary fuel pump 34 may replenish the<br>
pressurized fuel within fuel rail 20.<br>
[0019] Fuel may be delivered to cylinders of engine 12 from primary<br>
fuel reservoir 32 by primary fuel pump 34 through fuel rail 20 and a plurality of<br>
fuel injectors 18. Air may be drawn into intake manifold 14 through throttle 26<br>
and distributed to cylinders of engine 12. The air and fuel may mix to form a<br>
combustion mixture within cylinders of engine 12 which may be ignited by ignition<br>
system 44. The combustion mixture may be provided at a desired stoichiometric<br>
ratio of air and fuel and may combust within the cylinder to reciprocally drive a<br>
piston (not shown) of engine 12, which in turn may drive a crankshaft (not shown)<br><br>
of engine 12. The fuel and air may be adjusted, or trimmed, to correct for<br>
deviations from a desired stoichiometric air-to-fuel ratio.<br>
[0020] Exhaust gas from combustion within engine 12 may exit engine<br>
12 through exhaust manifold 16. Exhaust sensors 22 and 24 may be oxygen<br>
sensors associated with a cylinder bank of engine 12. Exhaust sensors 22 and<br>
24 may sense whether the exhaust is lean or rich and may be monitored by<br>
control module 40. The output of exhaust sensors 22 and 24 may be used to<br>
control trim values, which in turn may provide information to calculate a fuel<br>
composition.<br>
[0021] Control module 40 may be in communication with engine 12,<br>
fuel injectors 18, exhaust sensors 22 and 24, primary fuel reservoir 32, primary<br>
fuel pump 34, secondary fuel reservoir 36 and secondary fuel pump 38. Control<br>
module 40 may monitor fuel levels of primary fuel reservoir 32 and secondary<br>
fuel reservoir 36. Control module 40 may monitor and control primary fuel pump<br>
34 and secondary fuel pump 38, including monitoring an ON or OFF status.<br>
Control module 40 may monitor exhaust sensors 22 and 24 to receive signals<br>
relating to exhaust content. Control module 40 may control engine 12 and fuel<br>
injectors 18 at a fuel trim level based on exhaust sensors 22 and 24. Control<br>
module 40 may include memory and algorithms such that changes in fuel trim<br>
may be used to estimate relative changes in stoichiometric air-to-fuel or fuel-to-<br>
air ratio and, accordingly, to estimate relative changes in fuel composition.<br>
[0022] Referring now to FIG. 2, a functional block diagram of control<br>
module 40 is shown. Control module 40 may include fuel composition estimation<br><br>
module 60, learn limit module 62, CLC module 64, secondary transfer pump<br>
module 66 and fuel trim control module 68.<br>
[0023] Fuel trim control module 68 may be in communication with fuel<br>
composition estimation module 60, CLC module 64, exhaust sensors 22 and 24,<br>
engine 12 and fuel injectors 18. Fuel trim control module 68 may monitor<br>
exhaust sensors 22 and 24 for an exhaust composition such as oxygen to<br>
determine whether engine 12 is being operated with a stoichiometric mixture of<br>
air and fuel. Fuel trim control module 68 may trim the fuel supplied to engine 12<br>
by fuel injectors 18 to achieve stoichiometry.<br>
[0024] Trim values used to make such corrections may be stored in<br>
memory locations of fuel trim control module 68 corresponding to a plurality of<br>
predefined closed loop air-to-fuel ratio control cells (also referred to as sub-<br>
regions) associated with operating regions of vehicle 10. Cell values may be<br>
used to provide closed-loop fuel, air and/or re-circulated exhaust control. For<br>
example, long-term multipliers (LTMs) may be used to provide long-term<br>
corrections to fuel commands to engine 12 in response to changing engine<br>
conditions. LTMs typically are stored in a memory lookup table in non-volatile<br>
memory. The fuel trim control module 68 may adjust LTMs periodically in<br>
accordance with a long-term time period, e.g., using a period that is longer than 1<br>
second such as ten seconds. Such adjustment may be referred to as "long-term<br>
learning".<br>
[0025] Additionally or alternatively, short-term integrators (STIs) may<br>
be used to provide short-term corrections to fuel commands to the engine 12 in<br><br>
response to engine conditions. The fuel trim control module 68 may adjust STIs<br>
periodically in accordance with a short-term time period, e.g., using a period that<br>
is less than one second such as every 6.25 milliseconds. Such adjustment may<br>
be referred to as "short-term learning". STIs may be stored in volatile memory<br>
and may be adjusted based on an active cell LTM and a signal of exhaust<br>
sensors 22 and 24. Fuel trim control module 68 may communicate fuel trim<br>
/alues (including STI and LTM values) to fuel composition estimation module 60<br>
and CLC module 64.<br>
[0026] CLC module 64 may receive fuel trim values from fuel trim<br>
control module 68 or fuel composition estimation module 60. CLC module 64<br>
may include a fuel trim memory structure for use in estimating fuel composition.<br>
A plurality of CLC cells may be associated with each cylinder bank of engine 12.<br>
For example, eight cells may be provided for each cylinder bank of engine 12.<br>
CLC cells may be defined based on mass air flow to the engine 12 and may be<br>
used to record a total closed-loop fuel trim of the engine 12 at various operating<br>
conditions. CLC module 64 may store baseline closed loop correction values for<br>
the engine operating regions in the CLC cells. The baseline CLC values may<br>
provide a basis for determining new fuel and air ratio estimates.<br>
[0027] CLC cell values may be stored in non-volatile memory. A CLC<br>
value may be obtained by multiplying LTM and STI corrections for an active<br>
closed-loop fuel control cell. In other configurations, CLC values may be<br>
combined in other ways. For example, a CLC value may be obtained in another<br>
configuration by adding LTM and STI corrections for an active closed-loop fuel<br><br>
control cell. CLC module 64 may use separate structures for closed loop fuel<br>
control and for fuel composition estimation or may use a single data structure for<br>
both operations. CLC module 64 may be in communication with secondary<br>
transfer pump module 66. Based on the input from secondary transfer pump<br>
module 66, CLC module 64 may not calculate or adjust CLC values.<br>
[0028] Learn limit module 62 may be in communication with secondary<br>
transfer pump module 66 and fuel composition estimation module 60. As will be<br>
described below, fuel composition estimation module 60 may utilize a change in<br>
fuel trim values over time to estimate fuel composition. Learn limit module 62<br>
may use a change in volume of fuel in a fuel tank to set maximum and minimum<br>
boundaries for the fuel trim valves that may be considered by fuel composition<br>
estimation module 60. For example, where a small volume of fuel has been<br>
added to a fuel tank, the overall change in fuel composition may be small even if<br>
the fuel composition of the added fuel is different from the fuel in the fuel tank.<br>
Conversely, when a large volume of fuel has been added, a greater change in<br>
overall fuel composition is possible. By setting fuel composition estimation learn<br>
limits based on the change in fuel volume, learn limit module 62 serves to filter<br>
air, fuel and other faults out of the fuel composition estimation calculations of fuel<br>
compensation estimation module 60. Learn limit module 62 may be disabled<br>
based on communication from secondary transfer pump module 66.<br>
[0029] Secondary transfer pump module 66 may be in communication<br>
with secondary pump 38 to receive a secondary pump status such as OFF or<br>
ON. Secondary transfer pump module 66 may monitor the secondary pump<br><br>
status and based on the secondary pump status communicate with fuel<br>
composition estimation module 60, learn limit module 62 and CLC module 64.<br>
[0030] Fuel composition estimation module 60 may be in<br>
communication with learn limit module 62, CLC module 64, secondary transfer<br>
pump module 66, fuel trim control module 68, primary fuel reservoir 32 and<br>
secondary fuel reservoir 36. Learn limit module 62 and fuel composition<br>
estimation module 60 may communicate fuel volumes, fuel composition<br>
measurements and fuel composition limits back and forth. Fuel composition<br>
estimation module 60 may receive CLC values from CLC module 64 and may<br>
provide fuel trim values to be stored in CLC module 64. Fuel composition<br>
estimation module 60 may receive a transfer pump status from secondary<br>
transfer pump module 66, fuel trim values from fuel trim control module 68, and<br>
fuel reservoir measurements from primary fuel reservoir 32 and secondary fuel<br>
reservoir 36. Fuel composition estimation module 60 may utilize these and other<br>
parameters to calculate a fuel composition as will be described in more detail<br>
below.<br>
[0031] Referring now to FIG. 3, a flowchart illustrating the operation of<br>
the control system is shown as control logic 100. At block 102 fuel composition<br>
estimation module 60 may determine whether a conventional refueling event has<br>
occurred. A conventional refueling event occurs while the vehicle 10 is turned off<br>
and fuel is added to the primary fuel reservoir 32. Fuel composition estimation<br>
module 60 may monitor the vehicle 10 ignition (not shown) or other parameters<br>
to determine whether the vehicle 10 was turned off and may monitor the primary<br><br>
fuel reservoir 32 to determine whether fuel was added while vehicle 10 was off.<br>
If a conventional refuel has occurred, control logic 102 may continue to block<br>
16. If a conventional refuel has not occurred, control logic 100 may continue to<br>
block 104.<br>
[0032] At block 104, secondary transfer pump module 66 may<br>
determine whether secondary fuel pump 38 has transferred from OFF to ON. An<br>
OFF to ON transition indicates that secondary fuel pump 38 is transferring fuel<br>
from secondary fuel reservoir 36 to primary fuel reservoir 32. The fuel<br>
transferred from secondary fuel reservoir 36 may have a different fuel<br>
composition than the fuel already in primary fuel reservoir 32. If secondary fuel<br>
pump 38 indicates an OFF to ON transition, control logic 100 may continue to<br>
block 106. If secondary fuel pump 38 does not indicate an OFF to ON transition,<br>
control logic 100 may continue to block 108.<br>
[0033] At block 106, secondary transfer pump module 66 may provide<br>
a signal to CLC module 64 indicating that certain CLC functions should be<br>
disabled. For example, CLC baseline values may not be updated once<br>
secondary fuel pump 38 begins to transfer fuel to primary fuel reservoir 32,<br>
although current CLC values may still be used by fuel trim control module 68 and<br>
fuel composition estimation module 60. It should be recognized that the<br>
disabling function described above may be applied to any operating parameters<br>
of vehicle 10, such as stored CLC values, that may operate under the<br>
assumption that large changes in fuel composition only occur during a<br>
conventional refueling event. Updating these parameters during a fuel transfer<br><br>
may result in skewed calculations and/or operation of vehicle 10. Control logic<br>
100 may continue to block 108.<br>
[0034] At block 108, secondary transfer pump module 66 may<br>
determine whether secondary fuel pump 38 has transferred from ON to OFF. An<br>
ON to OFF transition indicates that secondary fuel pump 38 has finished<br>
transferring fuel from secondary fuel reservoir 36 to primary fuel reservoir 32. If<br>
secondary fuel pump 38 indicates an ON to OFF transition, control logic 100 may<br>
continue to block 112. If secondary fuel pump 38 does not indicate an ON to<br>
OFF transition, control logic 100 may return to block 104.<br>
[0035] At block 112, fuel composition estimation module 60 may<br>
receive a signal from secondary transfer pump module 66 indicating that<br>
secondary transfer pump 38 has transferred from ON to OFF. Fuel composition<br>
estimation module 60 may determine whether a fuel composition estimation is<br>
already in progress. If so, control logic 112 may continue to block 118 and loop<br>
until the fuel composition estimate is complete as will be described below. If a<br>
fuel composition estimation is not already in progress, control logic 100 may<br>
continue to block 114.<br>
[0036] At block 114, secondary transfer pump module 66 may provide<br>
a signal to fuel composition estimation module 60 and/or learn limit module 62<br>
indicating that the fuel composition learn limits should not be utilized by fuel<br>
composition estimation module 60 to determine the fuel composition of primary<br>
fuel reservoir 32 after secondary fuel pump 38 has transferred fuel from<br>
secondary fuel reservoir 36. Utilizing fuel composition learn limits during fuel<br><br>
transfer may result in the exclusion of valid fuel trim values from the fuel<br>
composition estimation calculations. It should be recognized that the disabling<br>
function described above may be applied to any operating parameters of vehicle<br>
10, such as fuel composition learn limits, that operate under assumptions that are<br>
not applicable to an active refueling event during vehicle operation. Control logic<br>
100 may continue to block 116.<br>
[0037] At block 116, fuel compensation estimation module 60 may<br>
begin estimating the fuel composition of primary fuel reservoir 32. Fuel trim<br>
control module 68 will continue to trim the fuel supplied to engine 12 to maintain<br>
stoichiometry even as the fuel composition changes. Fuel trim changes may in<br>
turn be represented as CLC values as described above and compared to CLC<br>
baseline values during learn stages that occur at predetermined intervals. The<br>
predetermined intervals may be based on fuel consumption from primary fuel<br>
reservoir 32 as measured by fuel composition estimation module 60. The ratio of<br>
the current CLC value to the CLC baseline provides a percentage change in the<br>
fuel-to-air ratio. The fuel composition may be determined from the fuel-to-air<br>
ratio based on correlating between fuel composition stoichiometric ratios.<br>
[0038] At block 118, fuel composition estimation module 60 may<br>
determine if the fuel composition estimation is complete. Fuel composition<br>
estimation may be complete when a predetermined number of learn stages are<br>
successfully completed or if a predetermined number of learn stages result in the<br>
same fuel composition. If fuel composition estimation is not complete, control<br><br>
logic 100 may continue to loop back to block 118. If fuel composition estimation<br>
is complete, control logic 100 may continue to block 120.<br>
[0039] At block 120, fuel compensation estimation module 60 may<br>
communicate to learn limit module 62 and CLC module 64 that fuel composition<br>
estimation is complete. Learn limit module 62 and CLC module 64 may then re-<br>
enable fuel composition estimation learn limits and updating of CLC baseline<br>
values, as well as any other parameters that may have been disabled by control<br>
logic 100. Control logic 100 may then end.<br>
[0040] Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the foregoing<br>
description that the broad teachings of the present invention can be implemented<br>
in a variety of forms. Therefore, while this invention has been described in<br>
connection with particular examples thereof, the true scope of the invention<br>

vehicle operating parameter when the calculating is complete.<br><br>
6.	The method of claim 1, wherein the transfer pump status includes a<br>
transition from OFF to ON.<br>
7.	The method of claim 6, further comprising disabling the vehicle<br>
operating parameter.<br>
8.	The method of claim 7, wherein the disabled vehicle operating<br>
parameter includes updating of baseline closed loop correction cells.<br>
9.	The method of claim 7, further comprising enabling the disabled<br>
vehicle operating parameter when the transfer pump status includes a transition<br>
from ON to OFF.<br>
10.	The method of claim 1, wherein the fuel composition includes<br>
gasoline and ethanol.<br>
11.	A control module, comprising:<br>
a secondary pump transfer module detecting a status of a transfer<br>
pump for transferring fuel between a first fuel source and a second fuel source;<br>
and<br>
a fuel composition estimation module in communication with the<br>
secondary pump transfer module, receiving a fuel trim value and a vehicle<br>
operating parameter, and calculating a fuel composition of one of the first fuel<br><br>
source and second fuel source based on the fuel trim value, the transfer pump<br>
status, and the vehicle operating parameter.<br>
12.	The method of claim 11 wherein the transfer pump status includes<br>
a transition from ON to OFF.<br>
13.	The method of claim 12, further comprising a learn limit module<br>
including a fuel composition learn limitation.<br>
14.	The method of claim 13, wherein the fuel composition estimation<br>
module includes ignoring the fuel composition learn limitation.<br>
15.	The method of claim 14, wherein the fuel composition estimation<br>
module includes enabling the fuel composition learn limitation when the<br>
calculating is complete.<br>
16.	The method of claim 11 wherein the transfer pump status includes<br>
a transition from OFF to ON.<br>
17.	The method of claim 16, further comprising a closed loop correction<br>
(CLC) module including baseline CLC cells.<br><br>
18.	The method of claim 17, wherein the CLC module includes<br>
disabling updating of the baseline CLC cells.<br>
19.	The method of claim 18, wherein the CLC module includes<br>
enabling updating of the baseline CLC cells when the transfer pump status<br>
includes a transition from ON to OFF.<br>
20.	The method of claim 11, wherein the fuel composition includes<br>
gasoline and ethanol.<br><br>
A method comprises detecting a status of a transfer pump for transferring fuel<br>
between a first fuel source and a second fuel source; receiving a fuel trim value<br>
and a vehicle operating parameter; and calculating a fuel composition of one of<br>
the first fuel source and second fuel source based on the fuel trim value, the<br>
transfer pump status and the vehicle operating parameter. A control module<br>
comprises a secondary pump transfer module detecting a status of a transfer<br>
pump for transferring fuel between a first fuel source and a second fuel source;<br>
and a fuel composition estimation module in communication with the secondary<br>
pump transfer module, receiving a fuel trim value and a vehicle operating<br>
parameter, and calculating a fuel composition of one of the first fuel source and<br>
second fuel source based on the fuel trim value, the transfer pump status, and<br>
