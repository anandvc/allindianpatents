"WRITE-ONCE-TYPE RECORDING MEDIUM, RECORDING APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR THE SAME, AND REPRODUCING APPARATUS AND<br>
METHOD FOR THE SAME"1<br>
Pioneer Corporation, a company incorporated in Japan having its Registered Office at 4-1, Meguro 1-chome, Meguro-ku, Tokyo 153-8654, Japan.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br>
1034/nm^<br><br>
1<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
WRITE-ONCE-TYPE RECORDING MEDIUM, RECORDING APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR THE SAME, AND 5     REPRODUCING APPARATUS AND .METHOD FOR THE SAME<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a write-once-type recording medium, a recording apparatus for and a recording method of 10 recording record data which is to be recorded onto the write-once-type recording medium, and a reproducing apparatus for and a reproducing method of reproducing the record data recorded on the write-once-type recording medium.<br>
15      Background Art<br>
As a technique of improving the reliability of the recording and reading of record data on a high"density recording medium, such as an optical disc, a magnetic disc, and a magneto optical disc, there is defect management.    Namely, when there are scratches or<br>
20 dusts, or deterioration (which are collectively referred to as a "defect") on the recording medium, data to be recorded or already recorded at the position of the defect is recorded in another area on the recording medium (which is referred to as a "spare area"). As described above,  by evacuating to the  spare area the record data<br>
25      which   is   possibly   imperfectly   or   incompletely   recorded   or   read because of the defect, it is possible to improve the reliability of the<br><br>
2<br>
recording and reading of the record data (refer to Japanese Patent Application Laying Open NO. Hei 11* 185390).<br>
In general, a defect list is made to, perform the defect<br>
management. On the defect list, there are recorded address<br>
5 information for indicating the position of a defect on the recording<br>
medium, and address information for indicating a position in the<br>
spare area (e.g. a recording position in the spare area) to which the<br>
data to be recorded or already recorded at the position of the defect<br>
is evacuated.<br>
10	In general, the defect list is made when a recording medium<br>
is initialized or formatted.    It is also made when the record data is<br>
recorded  onto  the   recording  medium.     When  the  record  data  is<br>
recorded  and  rewritten  several times,   the  defect  list is  made  or<br>
updated every time the record data is recorded and rewritten.<br>
15	When the record data is recorded onto the recording medium,<br>
the defect list is referred to. This allows the recording of the record data onto the recording medium away from the position of a defect. On the other hand, the defect list is also referred to when the record data recorded on the recording medium is reproduced or 20 read. This makes it possible to surely read both the record data recorded in a normal recording area and the record data recorded in the spare area because of the presence of a defect, on the basis of the defect list.<br>
The defect list is generally recorded in a specific area on the<br>
25      recording medium, which is the object of the making or updating of<br>
the defect list.    The defect list is read from the recording medium<br><br>
3<br>
next time when the record data recorded on the recording medium is reproduced or when other record data is rewritten or additionally recorded. Then the defect list is referred to in a reading operation by a reading apparatus or in a reproduction operation by a 5     reproducing apparatus.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
The defect list is recorded in a specific area on the recording<br>
medium.     For example,  with respect to a rewritable  optical disc<br>
10      using a blue laser,  the defect list is recorded in a predetermined<br>
area  (which  is   hereinafter  referred   to   as   a   "defect   management<br>
area") reserved in a lead"in area or lead-out area on the disc.<br>
As described above, the defect list is updated every time the<br>
record   data  is   recorded  and   rewritten.     Then,   the   defect  list  is<br>
15      overwritten   in    the   defect   management   area   on    the    recording<br>
medium, which is the object of the recording and rewriting, every<br>
time the defect list is updated by the recording and rewriting of the<br>
record data.    Namely, the defect list in the defect management area<br>
is rewritten every time the defect list is updated.<br>
20	Such   updating   of the   defect   list   by   rewriting   it   can   be<br>
realized only in case that the recording medium is rewritable.    In<br>
case   that   the   recording  medium   is   a   so-called   "write-once-type<br>
recording medium", for example, a write-once-type optical disc, it is<br>
necessary  to  use  another  method  to   realize  the   updating  of the<br>
25      defect list.     For example,  a conceivable  method as  the  method  of<br>
realizing the updating of the defect list is such that every time the<br><br>
4<br>
defect list is updated, the updated defect list is recorded in a new unrecorded or blank area on the write-once-type recording medium.<br>
According to this method, however, every time the defect list<br>
is updated, it is necessary to reserve or ensure an area to record the<br>
5     updated defect list.    It is also necessary to estimate in advance the<br>
number of times the defect list is updated and to reserve in advance<br>
the defect management area large enough to record the defect list<br>
by  the   number  of times.     In  any case,   in  order  to   realize   the<br>
updating of the defect list on the write-once-type recording medium,<br>
10     it is necessary to reserve a larger area to record the defect list (i.e.,<br>
the   larger  defect management area),  as  compared  with  the  case<br>
where the defect list can be rewritten or overwritten.<br>
As    a   result,    the    data   structure    of   the    write-once-type<br>
recording   medium   is   different   from   that   of  the   rewritable-type<br>
15      recording medium, which causes the problem that they are mutually<br>
incompatible   regarding . the    reading   of   data    recorded   on    the<br>
recording media.    For example, enlarging the  defect management<br>
area.in  the lead-in  area  extends  the lead-in  area,  which  causes<br>
different ranges of the lead-in areas between  the  write-once-type<br>
20      recording   medium   and   the    rewritable-type    recording   medium.<br>
Consequently,   both   recording  media   become   incompatible,   which<br>
possibly causes the problem that a drive apparatus for the existing<br>
rewritable-type recording medium cannot reproduce the data on the<br>
write-once-type recording medium.<br>
25	It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide: a<br>
wvite-once-type recording medium which has a defect management<br><br>
i&gt;<br>
function and which is compatible with a rewritable-type recording medium," a recording apparatus for and a recording method of recording record data onto the write-once-type recording medium; and a reproducing apparatus for and a reproducing method of 5 reproducing the record data recorded on the write* once-type recording medium.<br>
The above object of the present invention can be achieved by<br>
a write-once-type recording medium provided with-" a. data area to<br>
record therein record data; a control information recording area to<br>
10      record therein information for controlling an operation of recording<br>
and/or reading in the data area, the control information recording<br>

5     Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
The embodiments of the present invention will be explained with reference to the drawings hereinafter. (Embodiment of Recording Medium)<br>
An embodiment of the recording medium of the present 10 invention will be explained with reference to the drawings. Incidentally, the drawings used for the explanation of the embodiments of the present invention embody constitutional elements or the like of the recording medium, recording apparatus or reproducing apparatus of the present invention only for the 15 purpose of explaining technical ideas thereof. The shape, size, position, connection relationship, and the like of various constitutional elements or the like are not limited to the drawings.<br>
FIG.   1   shows   the   structure   of data  or  information   to  be<br>
recorded or already recorded on a disc-shaped recording medium 10,<br>
20      which is  an embodiment of the recording medium of the  present<br>
invention.    The left side of FIG. 1 is the inner circumferential side<br>
of the disc-shaped recording medium 10.<br>
The recording medium 10 is a disc-shaped recording medium,<br>
such as an optical disc, a magnetic disc, a magneto optical disc, and<br>
25      a   dielectric   recording   disc.       The    recording   medium    10   is   a<br>
WVl("C-nr",Q""""""CI	l-O/iflPllirin       vn n/lin w\	nikiflli	n  1 1 
 <br>
12<br>
record data only once at each position, e.g. a write once recording disc.<br>
As shown in FIG.  1,  the  recording medium  10 is provided<br>
with- a data area  Hi a control information recording area   12;  a<br>
5     definite    defect    management    area    13    placed    in    the    control<br>
information recording area 12; and a temporary defect management<br>
area   14.     It  is   also  provided   with   another  control  information<br>
recording     area     (which     is    not     illustrated)     on     the     outer<br>
circumferential side of the data area 11.<br>
10	The data area 11 is intended to record or write-once therein<br>
the  "record data".     The  control  information  recording area   12  is<br>
intended to record or write-once therein the control information for<br>
controlling the recording and reading in the data area 11.<br>
Information   or   data   which   is   recorded   on   the   recording 15      medium  10 can be classified into the  record data and the  control information.    The record data is data which is mainly the object of reproduction or execution, e.g. image data; audio data; text data; contents data; a computer program; or the like.    On the other hand, the control information is information for controlling the recording 20     and reading in the data area 11, e.g. information for indicating the attribute   and  type  of the  recording  medium   10;  information  for managing the address of the record data; information for controlling the recording and reading operations of a drive apparatus; or the like.    The record data and the control information cannot be always 25     clearly classified in accordance with the content thereof.    However, the control information is mainly used directly for  LIJH operation<br><br>
13<br>
control of the drive apparatus, while the record data is mainly only the object of recording and reading and is mainly used in a data reproduction operation or in a program execution operation by a backend or a host computer. In response to such a difference of 5 their properties or the like, the record data is recorded in the data area 11 and the control information is recorded in the control information recording area 12.<br>
The definite defect management area 13 is included in the control   information    recording   area    12.       The    definite    defect 10     management   area   13   is   intended   to   record   therein   the   defect management information of the data area 11.<br>
The temporary defect management area 14 is placed between<br>
the  control information  recording area  12  and the  data  area   11.<br>
The    temporary    defect    management    area    14    is    intended    to<br>
15      temporarily record therein the  defect management  information  of<br>
the data area 11.<br>
The  defect  management  information  is  used  for  the  defect<br>
management.    The defect management is as follows.    When there<br>
is a defect, such as scratches, dusts, or deterioration, in or on the<br>
20      recording medium   10,  the record  data is recorded  into  a position<br>
away from the position of the_defect.    At the same time, the record<br>
data to be originally recorded or already recorded at the position of<br>
the defect is recorded into the spare area on the recording medium<br>
10.    Moreover, the following operations are also performed as a part<br>
25      of the defect management-" an operation of recognizing the position<br>
of  a   defect   upon   reproducing   the   record   data   recorded   on   the<br><br>
14<br>
recording medium 10; and an operation of reading from the spare area the record data to be originally recorded or already recorded at the position of the defect.<br>
A defect list is  used for the  defect management.    On the<br>
5     defect list, there are recorded address information for indicating the<br>
position    of   a   defect   on    the   recording   medium,   and   address<br>
information for indicating a position in the spare area at which the<br>
data to be originally recorded or already recorded at the position of<br>
the  defect is alternatively recorded.    The  defect list is made  or<br>
10      updated   when   the   record   data   is   recorded   onto   the   recording<br>
medium   10  (e.g.   upon  verifying).     Moreover,   a  defect changes  or<br>
increases  as the recording medium  10 is continuously used.    For<br>
example, fingerprints are often left on a recording surface during<br>
the use of the recording medium 10.    Thus, the defect list is made<br>
15      or updated at each opportunity of recording and/or reproducing with<br>
respect to the recording medium 10.    Such a defect list is included<br>
in the defect management information.<br>
As    shown   in    FIG.    1,   there   are   the    temporary   defect<br>
management area 14 and the definite defect management area 13 on<br>
20     the recording medium 10.    These two defect management areas are<br>
both   intended    to   record   the    defect   management   information.<br>
However, these two defect management areas are provided for their<br>
own different purposes, and their physical structures are different<br>
from each other.<br>
25	The  temporary defect management area   14  is  intended  to<br>
temporarily record the defect management information into it.    For<br><br>
15<br>
example,   the  temporary  defect  management  area   14  is   used   to<br>
record    therein   the   defect    management   information    until   the<br>
recording   medium   10   is   finalized.      Specifically,   if   the   defect<br>
management information is made upon initializing or formatting the<br>
5     recording   medium    10,    the    defect   management   information   is<br>
recorded  into the temporary defect management area  14.    If the<br>
defect   management   information   is   updated   upon   recording   the<br>
record data, the defect management information is recorded in the<br>
temporary defect management area 14.<br>
10	The temporary defect management area 14 is a larger area<br>
than the definite defect management area 13.    This purpose is to<br>
record a plurality of defect management information, responding to<br>
the number of the updating of the defect management information<br>
when it is updated several times.    This is based on the fact that the<br>
15      updated defect management information cannot be overwritten at<br>
the    same    position    because    the    recording    medium    10    is    a<br>
write-once-type recording medium, which allows recording only once<br>
at each position.    For example, the temporary defect management<br>
area 14 is large enough to record therein the defect management<br>
20     information twice or more.<br>
The temporary defect management area 14 is placed between the control information recording area 12 and the data area 11. As described above, the temporary defect management area 14 is relatively large. Thus if this area is desired to be placed in the 25 control information recording area 12, there is no choice to extend the  control  information  recording area   12.     In  this  embodiment,<br><br>
16<br>
however,   it   is   unnecessary   to   extend   the   control   information<br>
recording   area   12   to   reserve   or   ensure   the   temporary   defect<br>
management  area   14 because   the   temporary defect  management<br>
area 14 is placed out of the control information recording area 12.<br>
5     Moreover,     information     recorded     in     the     temporary     defect<br>
management area  14 is the  defect  management information, and<br>
this is not the record data but the control information in view, of its<br>
properties.    Therefore, it is not preferable to place the temporary<br>
defect management area 14 in the data area 11 which is intended to<br>
10     record the "record data".    In the embodiment, the temporary defect<br>
management area 14 is placed out of the data area 11, so that it is<br>
possible to avoid such an unprefarable situation.<br>
By placing the temporary defect management area 14 between the control information recording area 12 and the data area i5 11 as described above, the temporary defect management area 14 can be placed on the recording medium 10 without extending the control information recording area 12 and without placing it in the data area 11. This allows the compatibility between the write-once-type recording medium 10 and a general rewritable-type 20      recording medium.<br>
On the other hand, the definite defect management area 13 is intended to definitely record the defect management information into it. For example, when the recording medium 10 is finalized, so that the defect management information will be no longer updated 25 and the concent of the defect management information is determined,   the  definite   defect  management  area   13   is   used   to<br><br>
17<br>
record therein the defect management information.<br>
The definite defect management area 13 is a narrower area than the temporary defect management area 14. This is because all it needs is that at least one defect management information whose content is determined or fixed can be recorded in the area.<br>
The  definite  defect management  area   13  is  placed  in  the control   information   recording   area   12.       Most   rewritable-type recording media generally spread have  such a structure that the defect   management   area   is   placed   in   the   control   information recording area.     Moreover,  most rewritable*type  recording media which will be developed from now on will predictably have such a structure that the defect management area is placed in the control information recording area.    One of the reasons is as follows.     For example, the defect management information to be recorded in the defect management area belongs to the control information in view of its properties and is mainly used directly for the operation control of the drive apparatus.    Thus it is reasonable and efficient to record it    with    other    control   information    in    the    control    information recording area.    Another reason is as follows.    For example, in the case   of  a   rewritable-type   recording   medium,   even   if  the   defect -management information is updated  many times,  it is enough  to overwrite the updated defect management information at the same position  in  the  defect  management  area.     Thus  it  is  enough   to ensure the relatively narrow defect management area at which at least one set of the defect management information can be recorded, and it is unnecessary to extend the control information recording<br><br>
18<br>
area. In the embodiment, the same structure as that of such a general rewritable-type recording medium is adopted by placing the definite defect management area 13 in the control information recording area 12. This allows the compatibility between the 5 write-once-type recording medium 10 and a general rewritable-type recording medium.<br>
Now, one example of a method of using*the temporary defect<br>
management area 14 and the definite defect management area 13 is<br>
explained specifically.    When a user inserts or loads the recording<br>
10      medium 10 into a recording apparatus and starts recording in order<br>
to record the "record data" onto the recording medium 10, the record<br>
data is recorded by the recording apparatus into the data area 11 on<br>
the recording medium 10.    At that time, the record data is verified<br>
in  each predetermined block.    When  imperfection in  recording is<br>
15      detected by verifying,  it is estimated  that there is a defect at the<br>
recording  position.     On   the   basis   o£  this   estimation,   the   defect<br>
management information (the defect list) is made or updated.    Then,<br>
after a series of operation of recording the record data is ended, the<br>
made or updated defect management information is recorded by the<br>
20      recording apparatus into the temporary defect management area 14<br>
on the recording medium 10.<br>
The user can insert the recording medium 10 into or eject it<br>
from   the   recording   apparatus   many   times,   which   allows   the<br>
recording   of various   record   data   on   the   recording   medium   10.<br>
25      While the user does that many times,  in some cases,  new dirt is<br>
attached onto the recording medium 10.    Thus, at each opportunity<br><br>
19<br>
of recording the record  data onto the  recording medium  10,  the<br>
recording apparatus detects a defect existing in the data area 11,<br>
updates   the   defect   management   information,    and   records   the<br>
updated defect management information into the temporary defect<br>
5     management area 14.    At this time, because the recording medium<br>
10   is   write "once "type   (i.e.   not   rewritable),   it   cannot   overwrite<br>
information.    Thus, the updated defect management information is<br>
recorded  into   an   unrecorded   area  next   to   the   area  of the   last<br>
recorded defect management information in  the  temporary defect<br>
10     management   area    14,    for    example.        The    temporary    defect<br>
management    area    14    is    large    enough    to    record    the    defect<br>
management information several times in a row or parallel sequence<br>
in an unrecorded area.<br>
When fully recording the record data on the recording 15 medium 10, the user finalizes the recording medium 10. For example, because the recording apparatus has a function of finalizing, the user operates the recording apparatus to finalize the recording medium 10. By the finalize operation of the recording apparatus, the newest defect management information is read out of 20 a plurality of new and old defect management information recorded in the temporary defect management area 14 on the recording medium 10. This information is recorded into the definite defect management area 13 on the recording medium 10.<br>
After that,  the user inserts the finalized recording medium<br>
25      10   into   a   reproducing   apparatus   for   a   general   rewritable"type<br>
recording medium   to  reproduce  the  record  data  recorded  on  the<br><br>
20<br>
recording medium 10. At that time, the reproducing apparatus reads the defect management information recorded in the definite defect management area 13 on the recording medium 10, and reads and reproduces the record data recorded in the data area 11 on the recording medium 10 while referring to the read defect management information. This reproducing apparatus is for a general rewritable-type recording medium, not specially designed for the write-once-type recording medium 10. The recording medium 10, however, has the compatibility with a general rewritable-type recording medium, as described above, so that the record data recorded by the recording apparatus of the present embodiment on the recording medium 10 is accurately reproduced by the reproducing apparatus for the rewritable-type recording medium.<br>
As described above, according to the recording medium 10, the temporary defect management area 14 is placed between the control information recording area 12 and the data area 11: so that the recording medium 10 can ensure the compatibility with a general rewritable-type recording medium although the recording medium 10 is write"once"type. Therefore, the record data recorded on the recording medium 10 can be accurately reproduced by the reproducing apparatus for a general rewritable-type recording medium or the like. (Various Aspects in the embodiment of Recording Medium)<br>
On the recording medium 10 in FIG. 1, the temporary defect management area 14 is placed between the control information recording area  12 placed on the inner circumferential side of the<br><br>
21<br>
recording medium 10 and the data area 11. However, if there is the control information recording area on the outer circumferential side of the recording medium, the temporary defect management area may be placed between the control information recording area 5 placed on the outer circumferential side of the recording medium and the data area.<br>
Moreover, if there are the control information recording areas<br>
on the both inner and outer circumferential sides of the data area<br>
on the recording medium, a first temporary defect management area<br>
10      may   be   placed   between   the   control   information   recording   area<br>
placed on the inner circumferential side and the data area, and a<br>
second temporary defect management area may be placed between<br>
the    control    information    recording    area    placed    on    the    outer<br>
circumferential side and the data area.<br>
15	Furthermore, if the recording medium is a two-layer disc, it<br>
is   possible   to   provide   one   or   a   plurality   of   temporary   defect<br>
management areas for each layer.<br>
Incidentally, the definite defect management area may be<br>
placed not only in the control information recording area.placed on<br>
20 the inner circumferential side of the recording medium, but also in<br>
the control information recording area placed on the outer<br>
circumferential side of the recording medium. Moreover, in the<br>
case of the two-layer disc, it is possible to provide one or a plurality<br>
of definite defect management areas for each layer.<br>
25	Each temporary defect management area is preferably large<br>
enough to record the defect management information a plurality of<br><br>
22<br>
times   in   a   row   in   an   unrecorded   area,    as   described   above.<br>
Moreover,  if the  defect  management  information  with  the  same<br>
content can be recorded a plurality of times (e.g. twice) redundantly<br>
in a row in an unrecorded area in the temporary defect management<br>
5     area, it is possible to increase the recording robustness or certainty<br>
of the defect management information.    In order to realize this, the<br>
temporary defect management area is preferably large  enough to<br>
record the defect management information a plurality of times in a<br>
row or sequentially in an unrecorded area.<br>
10     (First embodiment of Recording Apparatus)<br>
The   first   embodiment   of  the   recording   apparatus   of   the<br>
present   invention   will   be   explained.      FIG.   2   shows   the   first<br>
embodiment of the recording apparatus of the present invention.    A<br>
recording  apparatus   20  in   FIG.   2   is   a   recording  apparatus   for<br>
15      recording   record   data   onto   a   write*once-type   recording   medium<br>
which  allows  the  recording of the  record data  only once  at each<br>
position, provided with: (i) a data area to record therein the record<br>
data;   (ii)   a  control  information  recording area   to   record  therein<br>
information for controlling the recording and reading in the data<br>
20     area,  the  control information  recording area  including  a definite<br>
defect   management   area   to   record   therein   defect   management<br>
information    of   the    data    area;    and    (iii)    a    temporary    defect<br>
management    area    to    temporarily    record    therein    the    defect<br>
management  information  of the  data  area,   the  temporary  defect<br>
5     management  area  being placed  between   the   control  information<br>
recording  area   and   the   data   area.     For  example,   the   recording<br><br>
23<br>
apparatus   20   is   intended   to   record   the   "record   data"  onto   the above-described recording medium 10.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, the recording apparatus 20 is provided with: a  first recording device  21; a  memory device 22; a second 5     recording device 23; and a third recording device 24.<br>
The first recording device 21 records the record data into the<br>
data area.    If the recording medium  is an optical disc,  the first<br>
recording device 21 can be realized by an optical pickup, a controller<br>
for controlling the optical pickup, and the like.    Incidentally, if the<br>
10     recording medium is an optical-type, the optical pickup is preferably<br>
used as a device for directly recording data or information onto the<br>
. recording   medium.     However,   if  the   recording   medium   is   other<br>
types, such as magnetic, magneto optical, and a tj"pe of using the<br>
change of a dielectric constant, it is possible to use a pickup, a head,<br>
15      a   probe,   or   the   like,   which   is   appropriate   for   the   type   of  the<br>
recording medium.<br>
The memory device 22 stores therein the defect management<br>
information.    The memory device 22 can be realized by a memory or<br>
the like, for example.<br>
20	The     second     recording     device     23     records     the     defect<br>
management information stored in the memory device 22, into the temporary defect management area. If the recording medium is an optical disc, the second recording device 23 can be realized by an optical pickup, a controller for controlling the optical pickup, and 25     the like.<br>
The third recording device 24 records the defect management<br><br>
24<br>
information stored in the memory device 22, into the definite defect<br>
management area.    If the recording medium is an optical disc, the<br>
third recording device 24 can be realized by an optical pickup, a<br>
controller for controlling the optical pickup, and the like.<br>
5	Incidentally, a plurality of sets of hardware, which constitute<br>
the first, second, or third recording device, may be provided individually, but usually, one set is enough. For example, it is enough to provide one optical pickup, one controller, and three software for controlling the controller corresponding to the relative 10      recording devices.<br>
Hereinafter, the operation of the recording apparatus 20 will<br>
be explained.    The first recording device 21 records the record data<br>
into the data area on the write-once-type recording medium.    In the<br>
recording apparatus 20, when the defect management information<br>
15      including the defect list for indicating the position of a defect on the<br>
write-once-type recording medium or the like is made or obtained<br>
through  the recording medium  or other communication  lines,  the<br>
memory    device    22    stores    therein    this    defect    management<br>
information.    The  second recording device  23  records  the  defect<br>
20      manageme-nt information stored in  the memory device 22, into the<br>
temporary   defect   management   area   on   the   recording   medium.<br>
There may be various choices of times the second recording device<br>
23 records the defect management information into the temporary<br>
defect management area.    For example, conceivable choices are as<br>
25     follows- e.g., immediately after the recording medium is initialized<br>
or formatted; immediately after one series of record data is recorded<br><br>
25<br>
onto the recording medium; or the like. The third recording device 24 records the defect management information stored in the memory device 22, into the definite defect management area on the recording medium. There may be various choices of times the third recording 5 device 24 records the defect management information into the definite defect management area. For example, a conceivable choice is when the recording medium is finalized, or the like.<br>
In the recording medium, which is the object of the recording<br>
by the recording apparatus 20: as is the case with the recording<br>
10     medium 10 described above, it is possible to reserve or ensure the<br>
temporary defect management area  without extending the control<br>
information recording area and without placing it in the data area,<br>
by  placing  the   temporary   defect  management  area   between   the<br>
control information recording area and the data area.    Thus,  it is<br>
15      possible   to  ensure   the   compatibility  between   the   write-once-type<br>
recording   medium    and    the   rewritable "type    recording   medium.<br>
Then, the second recording device 23 of the recording apparatus 20<br>
can record the defect management information into this temporary<br>
defect management area.    Therefore,  it is possible  to realize  the<br>
20      defect management in the write-once"type recording medium while<br>
maintaining    the     compatibility    between     the     write-once-type<br>
recording medium and the rewritable-type recording medium.<br>
Moreover,   as   is   the   case   with   the   recording   medium   10<br>
described above, the recording medium, which is the object of the<br>
2f&gt;     recording   by   the   recording   apparatus   20,    adopts   a   recording<br>
structure in common with the rewritable-type recording medium, by<br><br>
26<br>
placing   the   definite   defect   management   area   in   the   control<br>
information recording area.    Then, the third recording device 24 of<br>
the   recording   apparatus   20   can   record   the   defect   management<br>
information into this definite defect management area.    Therefore,<br>
5     it is possible to match the area in which the defect management<br>
information is  recorded on the write-once-type recording medium<br>
and   the   area   in   which   the   defect   management   information   is<br>
recorded   on   the   rewritable-type   recording   medium.     It   is   also<br>
possible   to  realize  the  compatibility  between  the  write-once"type<br>
10      recording medium and the rewritable-type recording medium.<br>
In    the    meanwhile,    the    defect    management   information includes the defect list at least including information for indicating the position of a defect in the data area on the recording medium. However, not only the information for indicating the position of a 15      defect in the data area, but also the following, information may be included   in   the   defect   management   information.       Namely,   (a) definition information for indicating the position of the data area; and (b)  a defect list including the defect position  information for indicating the position of a defect in the data area and the spare 20      area position information for indicating the  position of the  spare area at which the record data to be recorded at the position of the defect   is   alternatively  recorded,   may   be   included   in   the   defect management information.<br>
In general, position information for indicating the position of 25      the  data  area is  recorded  in  the  defect  management area  in  the control information recording area on the existing rewritable-type<br><br>
27<br>
recording     medium.	A     reproducing     apparatus     for     the<br>
rewritable-type recording medium reads this position information and   recognizes   the   position   of the   data   area   on   the   recording medium.      If so,   the   write-once-type   recording   medium   can   be 5     reproduced by the  reproducing apparatus  for  the  rewritable-type recording medium, by recording the information of the same type of this position information in the definite defect management area on the  write-once-type  recording medium, which is the object of the recording by the recording apparatus 20.    Thus, in the embodiment, 10     the definition information for indicating the position of the data area is included in the  defect management information,  and this defect management information is recorded by the third recording device 24 in the definite defect management area.    Therefore, the write-once-type recording medium for which the finalizing is ended 15      and on which the defect management information is recorded by the third recording device 24 in the definite defect management area, can    be     reproduced    by    the     reproducing    apparatus     for    the rewritable-type recording medium.<br>
The reproducing apparatus for the rewritable-type recording 20 medium reads the definition information recorded in the definite defect management area on the write-once-type recording medium and recognizes the position of the data area on the write-once"type recording medium on the basis of this definition information. Therefore, logically speaking, if the position information is 25 eventually recorded as the definition information in the definite defect management area, it is possible to arbitrarily set the position<br><br>
28<br>
of the data area on the write-once-type recording medium (although<br>
there are limitations by a standard or the like in practice).    If so,<br>
for   example,    when    the    write-once-type    recording   medium    is<br>
initialized or formatted,  it  is  possible  to reserve   the  temporary<br>
5     defect management area to be large, and by just much, the start<br>
address of the data area can be also shifted backward.    This makes<br>
it possible to reserve the temporary defect management area to be<br>
large while maintaining the compatibility about the reproduction of<br>
the   write-once-type   recording   medium   and   the   re writable-type<br>
10     recording medium.<br>
(Second Embodiment of Recording Apparatus)<br>
The second embodiment of the recording apparatus of the present invention will be explained. FIG. 3 shows the second embodiment of the recording apparatus of the present invention. A 15 recording apparatus 30 in FIG. 3 is provided with-" the first recording device 2L" the memory device 22; the second recording device 23," and the third recording device 24, as with the recording apparatus 20. The recording apparatus 30 is also provided with- a first defect-management-information generating device 31; and a 20      first recording control device 32.<br>
The  first defect-management-information  generating device<br>
31   generates  or  makes  the   defect  management information  with<br>
respect   to   the   recording   medium   on   which   the   record   data   is<br>
unrecorded,   and   lets   the   memory   device   22   store   therein   this<br>
25      information.<br>
The   first  recording  control  device   32  controls   the   second<br><br>
29<br>
recording device 23 to record the defect management information<br>
into   the   temporary   defect   management   area   when   the   defect<br>
management       information       is       generated       by       the       first<br>
defect-management-information generating device 31.<br>
5	Hereinafter, the operation of the recording apparatus 30 will<br>
be   explained.     For  example,   when  the  write-once-type   recording<br>
medium	is	initialized	or	formatted,	the	first<br>
defect-management-information generating device 31 generates the<br>
defect   management   information   with   respect   to   the    recording<br>
10     medium on which the record data is unrecorded.<br>
When the defect management information is generated by the<br>
first defect-management-information generating device 31, the first<br>
recording control device 32 controls the second recording device 23<br>
to   record  the  defect  management information  into  the  temporary<br>
15      defect management area.    The timing at which the first recording<br>
control device 32 controls the second recording device 23 to record<br>
the   defect   management   information   into   the   temporary   defect<br>
management   area   may   be   as   follows:   e.g.,   while   the   defect<br>
management     information     is     being     generated     by     the     first<br>
20      defect-management-information  generating device  31;  immediately<br>
after Ihe-generation of the defect management information is ended;<br>
or further, shortly after the generation of the defect management<br>
information is ended.<br>
As described above, according to the recording apparatus 30,<br>
25      it  can  record   and  maintain   the   defect  management  information<br>
generated upon initializing or formatting the recording medium, in<br><br>
30<br>
the temporary defect management area on the recording medium. (Third Embodiment of Recording Apparatus)<br>
The third embodiment of the recording apparatus of the present invention will be explained. FIG. 4 shows the third 5 embodiment of the recording apparatus of the present invention. A recording apparatus 40 in FIG. 4 is provided with- the first recording device 21; the memory device 22; the second recording device 23; and the third recording device 24, as with the recording apparatus 20. The recording apparatus 40 is also provided with- a 10 second defect"management-information generating device 41; and a second recording control device 42.<br>
The second defect-management-information generating device<br>
41  generates or updates the defect management information when<br>
the record data is recorded by the first recording device 21 into the<br>
15     data   area,   and   lets   the   memory   device   22   store   therein   this<br>
information.<br>
The  second recording control device  42 controls the second<br>
recording device 23 to record the defect  management information<br>
into   the   temporary   defect   management   area   when   the   defect<br>
20     management  information  is   generated  or  updated  by  the   second<br>
defect-management-information generating device 41.<br>
Hereinafter, the operation of the recording apparatus 40 will<br>
be explained.    For example, upon recording the record data into the<br>
data area, the recording apparatus 40 records the record data for<br>
25     each predetermined block and verifies at each time of recording in<br>
one  block.    The second de£ect*management*information generating<br><br>
31<br>
device 41 uses the result of the verifying, for example. It generates or updates the defect management information, and stores this information into the memory device 22. As described above, it can generate or update the defect management information upon 5 recording the record data, and reflect a defect in the data area to the defect management information upon reproducing.<br>
When  the  defect management information  is  generated or<br>
updated by the second defect-management-information  generating<br>
device 41, the second recording control device 42 controls the second<br>
10     recording device 23  to record the defect management information<br>
into the temporary defect management area.    The timing at which<br>
the second recording control device 42 controls the second recording<br>
device  23  to  record  the  defect  management  information  into  the<br>
temporary defect management area may be  as follows:  e.g.,  while<br>
15     the   defect   management   information   is   being   generated   by   the<br>
second     defect-management-information     generating     device     41&gt;"<br>
immediately   after   the    generation   of   the    defect    management<br>
information is ended; or further, shortly after the generation of the<br>
defect management information is ended.<br>
20	As described above, according to the recording apparatus 40,<br>
it can reflect a defect in the data area upon reproducing, record this<br>
defect     management     information    into    the     temporary    defect<br>
management area, and maintain this information.<br>
(Fourth Embodiment of Recording Apparatus)<br>
25	The  fourth  embodiment  of the  recording apparatus  of the<br>
present   invention   will  be   explained.     FIG.   5   shows   the   fourth<br><br>
32<br>
embodiment of the recording apparatus of the present invention. A recording apparatus 50 in FIG. 5 is provided with- the first recording device 21; the memory device 22; the second recording device 23; the third recording device 24; the second 5 defect-management-information generating device 41; and the second recording control device 42, as with the recording apparatus 40. The recording apparatus 50 is also provided with: a defect-management-information obtaining device 5_L<br>
The    defect-management-information    obtaining    device    51 10      reads the defect management information from the temporary defect management   area   en   the    recording   medium,    and   stores    this information into the memory device 22.<br>
Hereinafter, the operation of the recording apparatus 50 will<br>
be explained.     For example, if the defect management information<br>
15      is already recorded in the temporary defect management area on the<br>
recording   medium   inserted   in   the   recording   apparatus   50,   the<br>
defect-management-information obtaining device 51 reads the defect<br>
management information  from  the   temporary  defect  management<br>
area and stores this information into the memory device 22.    Then,<br>
20      the   second   defectum ana gement- information   generating   device   41<br>
updates the defect management information stored in the memory<br>
device 22 b}? the defect-management-information obtaining device 51<br>
when the record data is recorded into the data area by the first<br>
recording device 21.    Then, the second recording control device 42<br>
25      records   the   defect   management   information   into   the   temporary<br>
defect management area when the defect, management information<br><br>
33<br>
is updated.<br>
As described above, according to the recording apparatus 50,<br>
it can update this defect management information on the basis of<br>
the defect management information recorded and maintained in the<br>
5     temporary defect management area in the past.    It can also record<br>
and maintain the  updated defect management information in the<br>
temporary  defect  management  area.     This   makes   it  possible   to<br>
reflect   a   defect   newly   formed   in   the   data   area   to   the   defect<br>
management information, and to maintain this information in the<br>
10     temporary defect management area on the recording medium.<br>
(Fifth Embodiment of Recording Apparatus)<br>
The   fifth   embodiment   of  the   recording   apparatus   of  the<br>
present   invention   will   be   explained.      FIG.   6   shows   the   fifth<br>
embodiment of the recording apparatus of the present invention.    A<br>
15      recording   apparatus   60   in   FIG.   6   is   provided   with:   the   first<br>
recording device  211  the  memory device  22;  the  second  recording<br>
device 23; and the third recording device 24, as with the recording<br>
apparatus 20.    The recording apparatus 60 is also provided with: a<br>
finalize-command device 61&gt;" and a third recording control device 62.<br>
20	The    finalize-command    device    61    gives    a    command    for<br>
indicating   to   finalize  "the   recording   medium.       The   finalizing<br>
includes   an   operation   of maintaining   or   arranging   a   recording<br>
format on the recording medium after completing the recording of<br>
the record data on the recording medium on the basis of a recording<br>
25     state of the  record  data recorded at that stage.    la general,  the<br>
finalizing   is   performed   in   the   case   where   the   rewritable-type<br><br>
34<br>
recording medium is adapted to the recording format of a recording medium of a reproduce only type (i.e., ROM-type). The finalizing on the recording apparatus 60 is performed mainly to adapt the write-once-type recording medium to the recording format of the 5 rewritable-type recording medium or the recording medium of a reproduce only type.<br>
The   third   recording  control   device   62   controls   the   third<br>
recording device 24 to record the defect management information<br>
stored in the memory device 22, into the definite defect management<br>
10     area when the command for indicating to finalize is given by the<br>
finalize-command device 61.<br>
Hereinafter, the operation of the recording apparatus 60 will<br>
be  explained.     For example,  when a  user wants  to reproduce  the<br>
record data recorded on the recording medium with the reproducing<br>
15      apparatus     for     the     rewritable "type     recording     medium     or    a<br>
reproducing apparatus for the recoding medium of a reproduce only<br>
type, the user inputs an instruction for indicating to finalize to the<br>
recording    apparatus    60.        In    response    to    this    input,    the<br>
finalize-command   device   61   gives   a   command   for   indicating   to<br>
20      finalize the recording medium currently inserted in the  recording<br>
apparatus  60.     The  embodiment  may  be  constructed  as  follows:<br>
when the recording apparatus 60 judges that the data area of the<br>
recording medium is filled with the record data and that it is not<br>
preferable to record more record data, the recording apparatus 60<br>
25     performs  the  finalizing automatically.     If such  a  construction   is<br>
taken,    the   finalize-command   device   fil    gives   a   command   for<br><br>
35<br>
indicating  to  finalize   the   recording   medium  in  response   to   the judgment described above of the recording apparatus 60.<br>
The third recording control device 62 controls the third recording device 24 to record the defect management information stored in the memory device 22 into the definite defect management area when the command for indicating to finalize is given by the finalize-command device 61. As a result, the defect management information is recorded into the definite defect management area of the recording medium after the recording medium is finalized. This allows the compatibility between the write-once-type recording medium and the rewritable-type recording medium and allows the reproduction of the write-once-type recording medium with the reproducing apparatus for the rewritable-type recording medium.<br>
As described above, according to the recording apparatus 60,<br>
the defect management information can be recorded into the definite<br>
defect management area upon the finalizing, and this allows the<br>
compatibility between  the  write-once-type  recording medium  and<br>
the rewritable-type recording medium.    The finalizing is performed<br>
mostly when the  user thinks the  recording of the  record data is<br>
completed.    Therefore, by using the opportunity of finalizing and<br>
recording   the   defect   management   information   into   the   definite<br>
defect management area, it is possible to establish the compatibility<br>
between     the     write-once-type     recording     medium     and     the<br>
rewritable-type recording medium at a timing in line with the user"s<br>
intention or will.<br>
(Various Aspects in the Embodiments of Recording Apparatus)<br><br>
36<br>
Various aspects in the embodiments of the recording apparatus will be explained. The first generating device 31 for generating the defect management information or the second generating device 41 for generating the defect management 5 information may comprise: a defect-detecting device for detecting a defect in the data area," and a reserving device for reserving or ensuring the spare area corresponding to the defect in the data area. This allows the making of the defect list.<br>
Moreover,    the    finalize-command    device    61   may   give    a<br>
10     command for indicating to finalize in response to an eject command.<br>
When a user wants to reproduce  the  record data recorded on the<br>
recording  medium   with  another  reproducing apparatus,   the   user<br>
ejects the recording medium from the recording apparatus.     Thus,<br>
it is preferable to construct the embodiment such that the finalizing<br>
15      is  performed   in  response   to  the   eject  command   given   when   the<br>
recording medium is ejected from the recording apparatus and then<br>
the  defect  management information  is  recorded  into  the  definite<br>
defect management area.    This makes it possible to establish the<br>
compatibility  between  the   write-once-type  recording medium  and<br>
20     the rewritable-type recording medium in line with the user"s will.<br>
Moreover, the defect management information may be recorded by the second recording device 23 repeatedly at a plurality of times in an unrecorded area in the temporary defect management area. For example, at one opportunity of the recording operation, 25 the defect management information with the same content is recorded repeatedly at -A plurality of times in the unrecorded area in<br><br>
37<br>
the temporary defect management area. This makes it possible to surely maintain the defect management information on the recording medium before the finalizing, for example.<br>
Moreover, the defect management information may be recorded by the third recording device 24 repeatedly at a plurality of times in an unrecorded area in the definite defect management area. For example, at one opportunity of the recording operation, the defect management information with the same content is recorded repeatedly at a plurality of times in the unrecorded area in the definite defect management area. This makes it possible to surely maintain the defect management information on the recording medium after the finalizing, for example.<br>
Moreover,    the    defect    management    information    may    be<br>
recorded   by   the   second   recording   device   23   redundantly   in   a<br>
plurality   of   temporary   defect   management   areas   present   at   a<br>
plurality  of positions  on   the   recording  medium.     Namely,   in  the<br>
case where there are a plurality of temporary defect management<br>
areas on the recording medium, which is the object of the recording<br>
by the recording apparatus, e.g., the case where the areas are on the<br>
inner circumferential side and the outer circumferential side of a<br>
disc or the case where the areas are on relative layers of a two-layer<br>
disc, the defect management information with the same content is<br>
recorded redundantly in each of the plurality of temporary defect<br>
management areas.    This makes it possible to surely maintain the<br>
defect management information on the recording medium before the<br>
finalizing, for example.<br><br>
38<br>
Moreover, the defect management information may be recorded by the third recording device 24 redundantly in a plurality of definite defect management areas present at a plurality of positions on the recording medium. This makes it possible to 5 surely maintain the defect management information on the recording medium after the finalizing, for example.<br>
Furthermore, any one of the recording apparatuses 20 to 60<br>
may be further provided with an area setting device for setting the<br>
area (e.g., the areal size) of the temporary defect management area<br>
10     and setting the position of the data area depending on this set area<br>
of the  temporary defect management area.     For  example,   if the<br>
temporary defect management area is set to be large, more defect<br>
management information can be recorded in the  temporary defect<br>
management area.    Namely,  in  this case,  the  defect  management<br>
15     information can be recorded in a row in an unrecorded area many<br>
times, so that each defect management information can be recorded<br>
and   maintained  even   if the   updating  is  performed   many  times.<br>
Therefore, it is possible to maintain or increase the reliability of the<br>
recording   and   reproducing   of   the   record   data   even   when   the<br>
20      recording medium is used in a bad environment in which a defect<br>
occurs -often.    Moreover, if the temporary defect management area<br>
is set to be large, it is possible to increase the number of the defect<br>
management information with the same content which is recorded<br>
repeatedly or redundantly.    Therefore, it is possible to increase the<br>
25      robustness  or  certainty  of recording  and   maintaining  the   defect<br>
management   information.     On   the  other  hand,   if the  temporary<br><br>
39<br>
defect management area is set to be small or narrow, it is possible to ensure the data area to be large by just that much. Therefore, it is possible to increase the substantial recording capacity of the recording medium. If setting the range of the temporary defect 5 management area by the area setting device is entrusted to a user, it is possible to appropriately set the temporary defect management area depending on the user"s using aspects of the recording medium. (First Embodiment of Reproducing Apparatus)<br>
The first embodiment of the reproducing apparatus of the 10 present invention will be explained. FIG. 7 shows the first embodiment of the reproducing apparatus of the present invention. A reproducing apparatus 70 in FIG. 7 is a reproducing apparatus for reproducing record data recorded on the above described write-once-type recording medium of the embodiment of the present 15 invention. For example, the reproducing apparatus 70 reproduces the record data recorded on the above-described recording medium 10.<br>
As shown in FIG. 7, the reproducing apparatus 70 is provided with-"   a   memory   device   71."   a   first   reading   device   72;   and   a 20      reproducing device 73.<br>
The first reading device 72 reads the defect management information recorded in the temporary defect management area and stores this information into the memory device 22. For example, if the recording medium is an optical-type, the first reading device 72 25 is provided with an optical pickup and a controller for controlling the optical pickup.<br><br>
40<br>
The reproducing device 73 reproduces the record data recorded in the data area on the basis of the defect management information stored in the memory device 71. For example, if the record data is image data, the reproducing device 73 is provided 5 with a decoder for converting the image data to an image signal displayable on a display.<br>
Hereinafter,  the operation of the reproducing apparatus 70<br>
will be explained.    For example, when the write-once-type recording<br>
medium, like the recording medium  10, which is the object of the<br>
10      reproduction by the reproducing apparatus 70 is inserted or loaded<br>
in the reproducing apparatus 70, the first reading device 72 reads<br>
the   defect   management   information   recorded   in   the   temporary<br>
defect   management   area   and   stores   this   information   into   the<br>
memory device 71.    Upon recording, the record data is recorded so<br>
15      as  to   avoid  a  defect  in   the   data  area  of the  recording  medium.<br>
Therefore,  in order to reproduce the record data recorded in this<br>
manner, it is necessary to recognize the position of a defect in the<br>
data area upon the reproducing.    When reproducing the record data,<br>
the reproducing device 73 refers to the defect list included in the<br>
20     defect management information and  recognizes the  position of a<br>
defect in the  data  area on the basis  of this defect list.     It also<br>
recognizes the recording position of the record data recorded so as to<br>
avoid the defect and reproduces the record data.<br>
As described above, according to the reproducing apparatus<br>
25      70, it is possible to surely reproduce the record data recorded on the<br>
recording medium while performing the defect management using<br><br>
41<br>
the defect management information recorded in the temporary defect management area placed between the control information recording area and the data area.<br>
In    the   meanwhile,    the   defect   management   information 5     includes the defect list at least including information for indicating the position of a defect in the data area on the recording medium. However, not only the information for indicating the position of a defect in the data area, but also the following information may be included   in   the   defect   management   information.      Namely,   the 10      defect list including: (a) the definition information for indicating the position  of the  data  area;  (b)  the  defect  position  information  for indicating the position of a defect in the data area; and (c) the spare area position information for indicating the  position of the  spare area in which the record data to be recorded at the position of the 15      defect   is" alternatively   recorded,   may   be   included   in   the   defect management information. (Second Embodiment of Reproducing Apparatus)<br>
The second embodiment of the reproducing apparatus of the present invention will be explained. FIG. 8 shows the second 20 embodiment of the reproducing apparatus of the present invention. A reproducing apparatus 80 in FIG. 8 is provided with; the memory device 71; the first reading device 72; and the reproducing device 73. as with the reproducing apparatus 70. The reproducing apparatus 80 is also provided with- a finalize-detecting device 81; a second 25      reading device 82; and a reading control device 83.<br>
The finalize-detecting device 81 detects whether of not the<br><br>
42<br>
recording  medium   is   already  finalized.     Whether  or   not   to   be<br>
already finalized can be judged by checking the control information<br>
recorded in the control information recording area on the recording<br>
medium, for example.<br>
5	The second reading device 82 reads the defect management<br>
information recorded in the definite defect management area and<br>
stores this information into the memory device 71.    For example, if<br>
the recording medium is an optical-type, the second reading device<br>
82 is provided with an optical pickup and a controller for controlling<br>
10     the optical pickup.<br>
The reading control device 83 uses the second reading device<br>
82   to   read   the   defect   management  information   recorded   in   the<br>
definite defect management area and  stores this information into<br>
the memory device 71 when it is detected that the recording medium<br>
15     is   already   finalized   on   the   basis   of  a   detection   result   by   the<br>
finalize-detecting device 81.    The reading control device 83 uses the<br>
first reading device 72 to read the defect management information<br>
recorded in the temporary defect management area and stores this<br>
information into the memory device 71 when it is detected that the<br>
20      recording medium is not finalized yet.<br>
Hereinafter, the operation of the reproducing apparatus 80 will be explained. The reproducing apparatus 80 reads either the defect management information recorded in the temporary defect management area or the defect management information recorded in 25 the definite defect management area, stores this information into the   memory   device   71,   and   reproduces   the   record   data   while<br><br>
43<br>
performing   the   defect   management   on   the   basis   of the   defect management information stored in the memory device 71.<br>
Which  defect  management  information  is  read  out  of the defect management information recorded in the temporary defect management area or the defect management information recorded in the   definite   defect   management  area  is judged  on  the  basis  of whether or not the recording medium is already finalized.    In order to   realize  this judgment,  firstly,   the  finalize-detecting device  81 detects whether or not the recording medium is already finalized. Then, on the basis of this detection result, when it is detected that the   recording -medium   is   already   finalized,   the   reading  control device  83  uses  the  second  reading device  82  to  read  the  defect management     information     recorded     in     the      definite     defect management  area   and   stores   this   information   into   the   memory device   71.      On   the   other   hand,   when   it   is   detected   that   the recording medium is not finalized yet, the reading control device 83 uses the  first reading device  72  to  read  the  defect management information recorded in the temporary defect management area and stores this information into the memory device 71.<br>
As described above, before the recording medium is finalized, the defect management information is recorded -inrtlie temporary defect management area. Therefore, if the recording medium, which is the object of reproduction, is not finalized yet, the defect management information is read from the temporary management area, and this information is used for the defect management and the reproduction of the record data on the reproducing apparatus 80.<br><br>
44<br>
On the other hand, after the recording medium is finalized, the defect management information is recorded in the definite defect management area. Therefore, if the recording medium, which is the object of reproduction, is already finalized, the defect 5 management information is read from the definite management area, and this information is used for the defect management and the reproduction of the record data on the reproducing apparatus 80.<br>
As described above, according to the reproducing apparatus<br>
80,    it   is   determined    which   information    is    used,    the    defect<br>
10      management    information    recorded     in     the     temporary    defect<br>
management area or the defect management information recorded in<br>
the definite defect management area, on the basis of whether or not<br>
the recording medium is already finalized.    Thus, depending on the<br>
situation  of the  recording medium,   it is  possible   to  perform  the<br>
15      defect  management   and  reproduce   the  record   data  by   using  the<br>
newest   defect   management   information.       That   is   because,    as<br>
described above, the defect management information recorded in the<br>
definite   defect  management  area  by the  finalizing  is  the  newest<br>
defect    management    information    made    or    updated    upon    the<br>
20     finalizing or  immediately before   the  finalizing.     Therefore,  it  is<br>
possible to increase the reliability of the reproducing of the record<br>
data.<br>
Incidentally,   the  embodiments  of recording  apparatus   and reproducing   apparatus   described   above   may   be   realized   in   an 25     integral form with hardware as an exclusive apparatus or may be realized by making a computer read a proginm.<br><br>

(Embodiment of Recording Method)<br>
The   embodiment   of   a   recording   method   of  the   present<br>
invention will be explained.      The recording method of the present<br>
invention is a recording method of recording record data onto the<br>
5     above     described     write-once-type     recording     medium     of    the<br>
embodiment of the present invention, the recording method being<br>
provided with: a first recording process of recording the record data<br>
into  the   data  area,"   a  defect-management"information  generating<br>
process    of    generating    or     updating    the    defect    management<br>
10     information;   a   second   recording  process  of recording  the   defect<br>
management     information      generated      or      updated      in      the<br>
defect-management-information     generating     process,     into     the<br>
temporary defect management area; a finalize-command process of<br>
giving a command for indicating to finalize the recording medium,"<br>
15      and a third recording process of recording the defect management<br>
information	generated	or	updated	in	the<br>
defect-management-information     generating     process,     into     the<br>
definite   defect  management  area  in  case  that  the   command  for<br>
indicating to finalize is given in the finalize"command process.<br>
20	In the recording method in the embodiment, at a stage before<br>
the recording medium is finalized, the defect management<br>
information is recorded into the temporary defect management area<br>
m     the     second    recording    process.	The    temporary    defect<br>
management    area   is   placed    between   the   control   information 25     recording area and the data area  and is relatively large.    Thus, even if the defect management information is updated a plurality of<br><br>
46<br>
times, the updated defect management information can be recorded<br>
and maintained on the recording medium at each time.    When the<br>
recording medium is finalized, the defect management information<br>
is recorded into the definite defect management area in the third<br>
5     recording process.    The definite defect management area is placed<br>
in the control information recording area, and in this regard it is in<br>
common with the rewritable-type recording medium in this point.<br>
Therefore,   the   defect  management   information   recorded   in   the<br>
definite    defect   management   area   can    be   reproduced   by   the<br>
10     reproducing apparatus for the rewritable-type recording medium.<br>
As described above, according to the recording method in the embodiment, it is possible to realize the compatibility between the write-once-type recording medium and the rewritable-type recording medium. 15      (Embodiment of Reproducing Method)<br>
The   embodiment   of  a  reproducing   method   of the  present<br>
invention will be explained.    A reproducing method of reproducing<br>
record   data   recorded   on    the    above   described    write-once"type<br>
recording medium of the embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
20      reproducing  method  being  provided   with-   a   detecting  process   of<br>
detecting whether or not the recording medium is already finalized;<br>
a    first    reading   process    of   reading    the    defect    management<br>
information recorded in the temporary defect management area and<br>
storing this information into the  memory device in case that the<br>
lb     recording  medium   is   not  finalized;   a   second   reading  process   of<br>
reading the defect management information recorded in the definite<br><br>
47<br>
defect management area and storing this information into the memory device in case that the recording medium is finalized; and a reproducing process of reproducing the record data recorded in the data area on the basis of the defect management information stored 5     in the memory device.<br>
In the recording method described above, before the recording<br>
medium is finalized, the defect management information is recorded<br>
into the temporary defect management area.    On the other hand, if<br>
the    recording    medium    is    finalized,    the    defect    management<br>
10      information is recorded into the definite defect management area.<br>
In the reproducing method of reproducing the recording medium, if<br>
the recording medium is not finalized yet, the defect management<br>
information is read from the temporary defect management area in<br>
the   first  reading  process.     On   the  other  hand,  if the   recording<br>
15      medium is already finalized, the defect management information is<br>
read   from   the   definite   defect   management   area   in   the   second<br>
reading process.     In  the  reproducing process,   the  record  data  is<br>
reproduced with the defect management performed, on the basis of<br>
the defect management information which is read in any one of the<br>
20      reading processes and which is stored in the memory device.<br>
As described above, according to the reproducing method in the embodiment of the present invention, it is possible to perform the defect management and reproduce the record data by using the newest defect management information. 25      (Examples)<br>
Examples    of   the   present   invention    will   be   hereinafter<br><br>
48<br>
explained with reference to the drawings. The examples below show that the write-once-type recording medium of the present invention is applied to a write-once-type optical disc and that the recording apparatus and the reproducing apparatus of the present 5 invention are applied to a recording / reproducing apparatus for the write-once-type optical disc. (Example of Recording Medium)<br>
Firstly, the recording structure of the write-once-type optical disc in the example of the present invention, and information and 10 data recorded on the optical disc will be explained. FIG. 9 shows the write-once-type recording medium which is the example of the present invention. Incidentally, the left side of FIG. 9 is the inner circumferential side of a write-once-type optical disc 100, and the right side of FIG. 9 is the outer circumferential side of the optical 15     disc 100.<br>
As shown in FIG. 9; there are a lead-in area 101 which is the<br>
control information recording area on the inner circumferential side,<br>
a data zone 102 on the outer circumferential side of the lead-in area<br>
101,   and   a  lead-out   area   103   which   is   the   control  information<br>
20     recording area on the  outer circumferential side of the data zone<br>
102   on   a   recording   surface   of  the   optical   disc   100.      A   first<br>
temporary   defect   management   area   104   is   placed   between   the<br>
lead-in area 101 and the data zone 102.    A second temporary defect<br>
management area 105 is placed between the data zone 102 and the<br>
25     lead-out area 103.<br>
In   both   the   lead-in   area   101   and   the   lead-out  area   103,<br><br>
49<br>
control information for controlling and management information for managing the recording and reading of information or data on the optical disc 100 are recorded. The lead-in area 101 is provided with a definite defect management area 106. The lead-out area 103 5 is provided with a definite defect management area 107. In both the defect management areas 106 and 107, defect management information 120 (refer to FIG. 10) is recorded.<br>
The data zone  102 corresponds to the above-described data<br>
area 11 shown in FIG.  1.    The data zone  102 is provided with- a<br>
10     user data area 108; and spare areas 109 and 110 on the inner and<br>
outer circumferential sides of the user data area 108, respectively.<br>
The user data area 108 is a main area to record the ""record data".,<br>
such  as  image  data,  audio  data,   and  contents  data.     The  spare<br>
areas 109 and 110 are intended to evacuate the record data from a<br>
15      defect in the user data area 108.    Namely, when there is a defect in<br>
the  user data area  108,  the record data to be recorded or already<br>
recorded at the position of the defect is alternatively recorded into<br>
the spare area 109 or 110.<br>
In the both the temporary defect management areas 104 and 20 105, the defect management information 120 is recorded temporarily. Incidentally, the defect management information 120 is also recorded in the definite defect management areas 106 and 107. The difference between the definite defect management areas 106 and 107 and the temporary defect management areas 104 and 105 25      will be described later.<br>
Next,    the    defect   management   information    120    will    be<br><br>
50<br>
explained.    The defect management information 120 is used for the defect    management   performed    by    a   recording   /   reproducing apparatus  200  (refer  to   FIG.   14).     The  recording / reproducing apparatus 200 performs the defect management when recording the record data onto the optical disc 100 or when reproducing the record data   from   the   optical   disc   100.      In   the   example,   the   defect management is mainly as follows.    When there is a defect, such as scratches,   dusts,  or deterioration,  on  the  user  data  area  on  the optical disc 100, the record data is recorded away from the position of the defect.    At the same time,  the record data to be  originally recorded or already recorded at the position of the defect is recorded into the spare area 109 or 110.    Moreover, the following operations are also performed as a part of the defect management- an operation of recognizing the position of a defect upon reproducing the record data recorded in the user data area 108 and an operation of reading from the spare  area  109 or  110  the  record  data  to  be   originally recorded or already recorded at the position of the defect.     In order to perform such a defect management, the recording / reproducing apparatus 200 needs to recognize the position of a defect in the user data area 108.    The defect management information 120 is mainly used for the recording / re_p.roxLucing apparatus 200 to recognize the position of a defect.<br>
FIG. 10 shows the content of defect management information 120. As shown in FIG. 10, setting information 121 and a defect list 122 are included in the defect management information 120.<br>
The setting information 121 includes-" a start address of the<br><br>
51<br>
user data area 108; an end address of the user data area 108; the size of the inner spare area 109; the size of the outer spare area 110; and other information, as shown in FIG. 10.<br>
FIG. 11 shows the content of the defect list 122.    As shown 5     in FIG. 11, on the defect list 122, there are recorded an address for indicating the position of a defect in the user data area 108 (which is  hereinafter  referred  to  as  a  "defect  address"),   an address  for indicating the recording position in the spare area 109 or 110 of the record data to be recorded or already recorded at the position of the 10     defect (which is hereinafter referred to as a "spare address"); and other  information.     When there  are  a plurality of defects in the user data area 108, a plurality of defect addresses and spare areas corresponding to the defects are recorded on the defect list 122.<br>
Incidentally,   the  defect  management  can  be  performed  not 15      only for the user data area 108 on the optical disc 100 but also for the entire recording surface of the optical disc 100.<br>
Next, an aspect about recording of the defect management information 120 will be explained. The temporary defect management areas 104 and 105 on the optical disc 100 and the 20 definite defect management areas 106 and 107 are all intended to record therein the defect management information 120. However, The temporary defect management areas 104 and 105 on the optical disc 100 and the definite defect management areas 106 and 107 differ in their locations, sizes, and purposes for use. Hereinafter, 25      their differences will be specifically explained.<br>
FIG.  12 shows one example of the situation that the defect<br><br>
52<br>
management information  120 is recorded in the temporary defect management area 104 or 105.    The temporary defect management areas 104 and  105 are intended to record the defect management information 120 temporarily until the optical disc 100 is finalized. 5     The defect management information 120 is necessary for the defect management.    The presence or absence and the position of a defect are different for each optical disc, so that it is necessary to record and   maintain   the   defect   management  information   120  on   each optical disc.    In the example, at a stage before the finalizing, the 10      defect management information 120 is recorded and maintained in the temporary defect management area  104 or  105 on the optical disc 100.<br>
In the example, as shown in FIG. 12, the defect management information 120 is recorded twice repeatedly in an unrecorded area 15 in the temporary defect management area 104 or 105. Incidentally, FIG. 12 shows the four defect management information 120 in total because such a process of repeatedly recording the defect management information 120 is performed twice in an unrecorded area. This makes it possible to surely record and reproduce the 20      defect management information 120.<br>
Until the optical disc 100 is finalized, the defect management information 120 may be updated several times in some cases. For example, if dusts are attached on the optical disc 100 between the first recording and the second recording (i.e., additional or 25 postscript recording), the defect (or dusts) is detected upon the second recording.    On the basis of this detection, the defect list 12.2<br><br>
53<br>
is   updated.      When   the   defect   list   122   is   updated,   the   defect<br>
management information 120 including the updated defect list 122<br>
is recorded into the temporary defect management area 104 or 105.<br>
The optical disc 100 is a write-once-type recording medium but not a<br>
5     rewritable-type   recording   medium,   so   that   it   is   impossible   to<br>
overwrite the updated defect management information 120 on the<br>
existing defect management information  120.    Thus,  as shown in<br>
FIG.    12,    the   updated   defect   management   information    120   is<br>
recorded in series after the existing defect management information<br>
10      120.<br>
In order to realize such repeated and serial recording of the<br>
defect     management     information     120,     the     temporary    defect<br>
management areas 104 and 105 are larger than the definite defect<br>
management areas 106 and 107.<br>
15	FIG.  13 shows one example of the situation that the defect<br>
management   information   120   is   recorded   in   the   definite   defect<br>
management  area   106  or   107.     The   definite   defect  management<br>
areas  106 and  107 are intended to record the  defect management<br>
information 120 definitely when the optical disc  100 is finalized.<br>
20      Namely,    at   a   stage    before   the   finalizing,    the    definite   defect<br>
-management areas 106 and  107 are unrecorded (or blank).    When<br>
the optical disc 100 is finalized, the defect management information<br>
120 is recorded in the definite defect management areas  106 and<br>
107, and the recording situation is continued subsequently.<br>
25	In the example, as shown in FIG. 13, the defect management<br>
information 120 is recorded twice in a row in an unrecorded area in<br><br>
54<br>
the definite defect management area 106 or 107. This makes it possible to surely record and reproduce the defect management information 120.<br>
According   to   the   optical   disc   100   in   the   example,   the 5     temporary defect management area (104, 105) is placed between the control   information  recording  area  (the  lead-in  area   101  or  the lead-out   area   103),  which   allows  the   compatibility  between   the write-once-type  optical disc  100 and  a general rewritable optical disc.       In   order   to   realize    the   compatibility   with   a   general 10     rewritable-type  optical  disc,   the   write-once-type   optical  disc   100 needs to have the lead-in area, the data zone, and the lead-out area, and needs to maintain a basic recording structure, such as the order, position,   and   size   (area)   of   the   areas.      The   optical   disc   100 maintains such a basic recording structure although it is provided 15      with the  temporary defect management areas  104 and  105,  which allows    the    compatibility.        Namely,    if    the    temporary    defect management area 104 is placed in the lead-in area 101, because the temporary   defect   management   area    104   is   relatively   large    as described above, there is no choice to extend the size of the lead-in 20     area 101, which is unfavorable.    In this example, however, such a disadvantage    does    not    occur    because    the    temporary    defect management   area   104   is   placed   out   of   the   lead-in   area   101. Moreover, if the temporary defect management area 104 is placed in the data zone 102, the defect management information 120 having 25      properties of the control information is included in  the data zone 102 which is an area in which the record data is supposed  to be<br><br>
55<br>
recorded, causing the disadvantage that the control information and the record data, which is information having properties different from those of the control information, are mixed m the data zone 102. In this example, however, such a disadvantage does not occur 5 because the temporary defect management area 104 is placed out of the data zone 102. The same is true for the defect management area 105.<br>
The start address and end address of the user area 108, and the size information of the spare areas 109 and 110 are included in 10      the setting information 121 in the defect management information 120 (refer to FIG.  10).    This setting information 121 can be set by the recording / reproducing apparatus 200.    Namely, it is allowed to change the start address and end address of the user area 108, and the sizes of the spare areas 109 and 110 if they are clearly shown as 15      the   setting   information   121.      Even   if  they   are   changed,   it   is possible      to     maintain     the     compatibility     with      a      general rewritable-type   recording  medium.      Therefore,   it   is   possible   to ensure a space between the lead-in area 101 and the data zone 102 by shifting the start address of the user data area 108 backward (to 20      the   outer  circumferential  side),   and   it  is  possible   to   place   the temporary defect management area 104 in the space.    Depending on how to set the start address of the user data area 108, it is possible to reserve or ensure the relatively  wider (large-sized) temporary defect management area 104.    The same is true for the temporary 25      defect management area 105.<br>
According   to    the    optical   disc    100,    the    definite    defect<br><br>
56<br>
management areas 106 and 107 are placed in the lead-in area 101 and    the    lead-out    area    103,    respectively,    which    allows    the compatibility between the write-once-type optical disc  100 and a general   rewritable   optical   disc.      Namely,   a   general   rewritable 5     optical disc has areas to record the defect management information, the areas being placed in both the lead-in area and the lead-out area. The optical disc 100 also has the definite defect management areas 106 and  107 placed in the lead-in area 101 and the lead-out area 103, respectively.    At this point, their recording structures coincide. 10     Therefore,  it is possible  to  ensure  the compatibility between the write-once"type   optical   disc   100   and   a   general   re writable-type optical disc. (Example of Recording / Reproducing Apparatus)<br>
The structure of a recording / reproducing apparatus in the 15 example of the present invention will be explained. FIG. 14 shov/s the recording / reproducing apparatus 200, which is an example of the present invention. The recording / reproducing apparatus 200 is provided with" a function of recording the record data onto the optical disc 100; and a function of reproducing the record data 20     recorded on the optical disc 100.<br>
The recording / reproducing apparatus 200 is provided with- a disc drive 300; and a backend 400.<br>
FIG. 15 shows the inner structure of the disc drive 300.    The disc drive  300 records information onto the optical disc  100 and 25      reads the information recorded on the optical disc 100.<br>
As shown in FIG.  15, the disc drive 300 is provided with: a<br><br>
57<br>
spindle motor 351; an optical pickup 352; a Radio Frequency (RF) amplifier 353; and a servo circuit 354.<br>
The spindle motor 351 is a motor for rotating the optical disc<br>
100.<br>
5	The optical pickup 352 records the record data or the like<br>
onto the recording surface of the optical disc 100 by irradiating the<br>
recording surface with a light beam, and reads the record data or<br>
the like  recorded on  the recording surface by receiving reflected<br>
light of the light beam.    The optical pickup 352 outputs a RF signal<br>
10     corresponding to the reflected light of the light beam.<br>
The RF amplifier 353 amplifies the RF signal outputted from<br>
the optical pickup 352 and outputs it to a coder / decoder (CODEC)<br>
355.    Moreover, the RF amplifier 353 makes, from the RF signal, a<br>
wobble frequency signal WF, a track error signal TE,  and a focus<br>
15      error signal FE; and outputs them.<br>
The servo circuit 354 is a servo control circuit for controlling<br>
the driving of the optical pickup 352 and the spindle motor 351 on<br>
the basis of the track error signal TE, the focus error signal FE, and<br>
other servo control signals.<br>
20	As shown in FIG. 15, the disc drive 300 is provided with- the<br>
CODEC   355;   a   buffer  356;  an   interface   357;   and   a   light   beam driving device 358.<br>
The  CODEC 355 is a circuit,  provided with:  a  function of performing an error correction for the record data upon reading; and 25      a function of appending an error correction code  or mark  to  the record  data   upon  recording so   as  to   demodulate   and   decode   the<br><br>
58<br>
record data.    Specifically, the CODEC 355 demodulates and decodes the RF signal outputted from the RF amplifier 353 upon reading, performs an error correction for the decoded RF signal, and then outputs this to the buffer 356.    Moreover, if the error correction is 5     impossible  as a result of performing the error correction  for the decoded      RF      signal,       the      CODEC      355      generates      an error-correction-impossible signal for indicating that,  and outputs this signal to a defect detector 359.    Upon recording, the CODEC 355 appends the error correction code to the record data outputted 10     from the buffer 356, demodulates and decodes this data to have a code suited to the optical characteristics or the like of the optical disc 100, and then outputs the decoded record data to the light beam driving device 358.<br>
The buffer 356 is a memory circuit for storing the record data 15     temporarily.<br>
The   interface   357   is   a  circuit   for   controlling  the   input  /<br>
output or communication of the record data or the like between the<br>
disc drive 300 and the backend 400.    Specifically, upon reproducing,<br>
the interface 357 responds a request command from the backend 400,<br>
20      and outputs the record data outputted from the buffer 356 (i.e. the<br>
record .data- read from  the  optical disc  100) to the  backend 400.<br>
Upon recording, the interface 357 receives the record data which is<br>
inputted from the backend 400 to the disc drive 300, and outputs<br>
this data" to "the buffer 356.    The interface 357 responds a request<br>
25     command from the backend 400 and outputs ail or part of the defect<br>
lists    maintained    in    a    generator    360    for    generating    Defect<br><br>
59<br>
Management Information (DMI generator 360) to the backend 400.<br>
Upon recording, the light beam driving device 35S generates a light beam driving signal corresponding to the record data outputted from the CODEC 355, and outputs this signal to the 5 optical pickup 352. The optical pickup 352 modulates a light beam on the basis of the light beam driving signal, and irradiates the recording surface of the optical disc 100 with it. This causes the recording of the record data or the like on the recording surface.<br>
As shown in FIG. 15, the disc drive 300 is provided with: the 10     defect detector 359; and the DMI generator 360.<br>
The defect detector 359 is a circuit for detecting a defect on the  optical disc  100.     The  defect  detector  359  generates  a  defect detection signal for indicating the presence or absence of a defect, and outputs this signal.    The defect detector 359 detects a defect on 15      the basis of the result of the error correction of the record data upon reading information (upon verifying or reproducing).    As described above, if the error correction is impossible as a result of performing the   error  correction  for  the   decoded  RF  signal,   the   CODEC   355 generates the error correction impossible signal for indicating the 20      fact, and outputs this signal to the defect detector 359.    The defect detector 359 outputs the defect detection signal for indicating the presence of a defect when receiving this error correction impossible signal.<br>
The DMI generator 360 is a circuit for generating or updating<br>
25      the  defect management information  120 on the basis of the defect<br>
detection signal outputted from the defect detector 359.    The defect<br><br>
60<br>
management information 120 is rewritably stored into a memory circuit placed in the DMI generator 360. The DMI generator 360 responds to a request command from the backend 400 and outputs the defect management information 120 to the backend 400 through 5     the interface 357.<br>
As shown in FIG.  15, the disc drive 300 is equipped with a<br>
Central Processing Unit (CPU) 361.    The CPU 361 controls the disc<br>
drive   300  as  a  whole,  and  controls  the  exchange   of information<br>
among the elements in  the  disc drive  300 described above.    The<br>
10      CPU    361    also   controls    the    recording    operation    and   reading<br>
, operation of the record data and the defect management information<br>
120.     The  CPU 361  responds  to  a control command or a request<br>
commend   transmitted   from    the   backend   400   and   controls   the<br>
exchange of data between the disc drive 300 and the backend 400.<br>
15	FIG. 16 shows the inner structure of the backend 400.    The<br>
backend 400 is an apparatus for reproducing the record data read from the optical disc 100 with the disc drive 300, receiving the record data supplied from the outside in order to record it onto the optical disc 100, compressing and encoding this record data, and 20     transmitting it to the disc drive 300.<br>
The backend 400 is provided with" a drive controller 47L* a<br>
video decoder 472; an audio decoder 473; a video encoder 474; an<br>
audio    encoder    475;    a    system    controller    476;    and    a   defect<br>
management device 477.<br>
25	The   drive  controller   471   is   a   circuit   for   controlling   the<br>
reading processing and recording processing of the disc drive 300.<br><br>
61<br>
The backend 400 and the disc drive 300 cooperate and perform an operation of reading the record data from the optical disc 100 and reproducing it and an operation of receiving the record data from the outside and recording it onto the optical disc 100.    The drive 5     controller 471 realizes the cooperation of the backend 400 and the disc drive 300 by controlling the reading processing and recording processing of the disc drive 300.    Specifically, the drive controller 471 outputs to the disc drive 300 request commands about reading, recording,    outputting    the    record    data    from    the    buffer    356, 10      outputting the defect  management information  120 from the DMI generator 360, and so on.    The drive controller 471 also controls the input   and   output   of   the   record   data,   the   defect   management information 120, and other various information.<br>
The video decoder 472 and the audio decoder 473 are circuits<br>
15      for decoding the record data which is read from the optical disc 100<br>
by   the   disc  drive   300  and  which  is   supplied  through   the   drive<br>
controller  471  and  converting the  record  data  to  be  reproducible<br>
with a display, a speaker, or the like.<br>
The video encoder 474 and the audio encoder 475 are circuit 20 for receiving a video signal, an audio signal, or the like inputted from the outside for the purpose of recording them on the optical disc 100, compressing and encoding them by Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) compressing and encoding method or the like, and supplying them to the disc drive 300 through the drive controller 25      471.<br>
The  system  controller  47G  is  a  circuit  for  controlling-   the<br><br>
62<br>
drive controller 471; the video decoder 472; the audio decoder 473; and the defect management device 477, and reproducing the record data in cooperation with the devices.    Upon recording, the system controller 476 controls: the drive controller 471; the video encoder 474; the audio encoder 475; and the defect management device 477, to thereby record the record data in cooperation with the devices. Upon reproducing and recording, the system controller 476 controls the disc drive 300 (e.g. controls the generation and transmission of various request commands, the reception of a response signal, or the like) with the drive controller 471 in order to realize the cooperation of the disc drive 300 and the backend 400.<br>
The defect management device 477 has therein a memory circuit and has a function of receiving and maintaining all or part of the defect management information 120 made or updated by the DMI generator 360 in the disc drive 300. The defect management device 477 performs the defect management with the system controller 476.<br>
Next, an initial setting operation of the recording /<br>
reproducing apparatus 200 will be explained. FIG. 17 shows an<br>
initial setting operation of the recording / reproducing apparatus<br>
200. The recording / reproducing apparatus 200 performs the<br>
initial setting between (i) when the optical disc 100 is inserted or<br>
loaded in the drive unit 300 and (ii) when the record data is<br>
recorded or reproduced. The initial setting is processing for<br>
preparing for the recording or reproducing of the record data, and<br>
includes    various    processing.	Out    of    the    processing,     the<br><br>
63<br>
initialization of the optical disc 100, the generation of the defect management information 120, the transmission of the defect management information 120 to the backend 400, or the like will be explained below. The processing is performed mainly under the 5     control of the CPU 361 of the drive unit 300.<br>
As shown in FIG. 17, when the optical disc 100 is inserted or<br>
loaded into the drive unit 300, the CPU 361 of the drive unit 300<br>
judges whether or not the optical disc 100 is an unrecorded disc i.e.,<br>
a blank disc (step Sll).<br>
10	When the optical disc 100 is a blank disc (the step Sll: YES),<br>
the  CPU 361 initializes  the optical  disc  100 (step  S12).    In this initializing,     the     DMI     generator     360     generates     the     defect management information   120 (step  S13).     Specifically,  it  obtains the start address and end address of the user data area 108 and the 15      sizes   of  the   spare   areas   109   and    110,   which   are   set.   in   the initializing, and generates the setting information 121.    Moreover, it generates the defect list 122.    The defect list 122 generated at this time has only an outline, not having any content.    Namely, the defect address is not recorded in it, nor is the specific spare address. 20     A header, identification information, or the like are only recorded. The  generated  defect management information  120 is stored and maintained in the DMI generator 360.<br>
Then,    the    CPU   361   transmits    the    defect   management information 120 stored in the DMI generator 360 to the backend 400 25      (step S14).    The defect management information 120 is stored into the defect management device 477 of the backend 400.<br><br>
64<br>
Then, the CPU 361 records the defect management information 120 stored in the DMI generator 360 twice repeatedly in an unrecorded area in the temporary defect management area 104 or 105 of the optical disc 100 (step S15).<br>
On the other hand, when the optical disc 100 is not a blank disc (the step Sir NO), the CPU 361 judges whether or not the optical disc 100 is already finalized (step S16). The finalizing is processing for arranging a recording format so that the optical disc 100 can be reproduced by a reproducing apparatus for a general rewritable-type optical disc and a reproducing apparatus for a general optical disc of a reproduce only type. It is possible to. recognize whether or not the optical disc 100 is already finalized by referring to the control information recorded in the lead-in area or the like.<br>
When the optical disc 100 is not finalized yet (the step S16: NO), the CPU 361 reads the defect management information 120 from the temporary defect management area 104 or 105 of the optical disc 100 (step S17). Namely, when the optical disc 100 is not a blank disc, because the defect management information 120 already generated in the past is recorded in the temporary defect management area 104 or 105, this information is read in the step.<br>
Moreover, if a plurality of defect management information 120 is recorded in the temporary defect management area 104 or 105, the CPU 361 selects and reads the newest defect management information 120 among them (step S18). Namely, at a stage before the finalizing, the defect management information 120 is recorded<br><br>
65<br>
in the temporary defect management area 104 or 105 every time it is updated. The plurality of defect management information 120 is arranged in series in the updated order. Therefore, the defect management information placed at the end is the newest defect 5 management information in the temporary defect management area 104 or 105. The CPU 361 selects and reads the defect management information placed at the end.<br>
In order to specify the defect management information 120<br>
placed at the end (or the last defect management information 120),<br>
10     the   example   adopts  the   following  method.     Namely,  in  the  case<br>
where a plurality of defect management information 120 are already<br>
recorded sequentially in a row in the temporary defect management<br>
area  104 or 105, information is recorded from the start address of<br>
the   temporary   defect   management   area   104   or   105   to   the   end<br>
15      address    of   the    area    in    which    the    last    defect    management<br>
information 120 is recorded, and the subsequent area is unrecorded<br>
or blank.    The CPU 361 controls the optical pickup 352 and scans<br>
the temporary defect management area 104 or 105,  starting from<br>
the start address.    Then, it detects a position from which a blank<br>
20      condition    starts    and    scans    backward    the    temporary    defect<br>
management area  104 or  105 from  the position.    This is  how to<br>
specify the last defect management information 120.    By this type<br>
of method, it is possible to easily specify the last or latest defect<br>
management information 120 without using a pointer or the like.<br>
25	The   CPU" 361   stores   the   read   last   defect   management:<br>
information   120  into  the  DMT  generator  360   and  transmits   this<br><br>
66<br>
information to the backend 400 (step S19). The last defect management information 120 is stored into the defect management device 477 of the backend 400.<br>
On the other hand, when the optical disc 100 is not a blank 5 disc but is already finalized (the step S16: YES), the CPU 361 reads the defect management information 120 from the definite defect management area 106 or 107 (step S20), and transmits this information to the backend 400 (step S21). The defect management information 120 is stored into the defect management device 477 of 10     the backend 400.<br>
As described above, the defect management information 120 is generated, or is selectively read from the temporary defect management area 104 or 105, or is read from the definite defect -management area 106 or 107. Then, it is recorded into the DMI 15 generator 360 and is recorded into the defect management device 477 of the backend 400. This completes the preparation for the defect management and ends the initial setting.<br>
Next,  a recording operation  of the recording / reproducing<br>
apparatus 200 will be explained.    FIG.. 18 mainly shows a recording<br>
20      operation   of   the   recording   /   reproducing   apparatus   200.      The<br>
recording   /    reproducing   apparatus    200   performs    a    recording<br>
operation of recording the record data into the user data area 108 on<br>
the optical disc  100.    The recording / reproducing apparatus 200<br>
performs   the   recording   operation   while   performing   the   defect<br>
25     management.    The recording / reproducing apparatus 200 performs<br>
verifying during the recording operation and updates the defect list<br><br>
67<br>
122 on the basis of the verifying. The recording operation is realized by the cooperation of the CPU 361 of the disc drive 300 and the system controller 376 of the backend 400.<br>
As   shown   in   FIG.   18,   after   judging   whether   or   not   an<br>
instruction of ejecting,  finalizing or  reproducing the  record data<br>
from the optical disc 100 is given (steps S31, S32 and S33), when a<br>
user inputs an instruction of starting to record (step S34-" YES), the<br>
recording / reproducing apparatus 200 responds to this and records<br>
the record data (step S35).    The record data is recorded into each<br>
predetermined block.    The recording / reproducing apparatus 200<br>
refers  to the  defect management information stored in the defect<br>
management device 477 of the backend 400 and records the record<br>
data while performing the defect management on the basis of the<br>
information.<br>
The recording / reproducing apparatus 200 performs verifying<br>
at each time of the one block recording (step S36), and updates the<br>
defect management information 120 on the basis of the result of the<br>
verifying.     Incidentally,   the  defect  management  information   120<br>
which is updated is the defect management information stored in<br>
the DMI generator 360 of the drive unit 300.    Specifically, when it<br>
is recognized, as a result of the verifying, that the record data fails<br>
to be  record (step S3?: YES), the CPU 361 of the disc drive 300<br>
records the record data that fails to be recorded into the spare area<br>
109 or 110 (step S38).    Then, the CPU 361 estimates that there is a<br>
defect in a place in which the record data is supposed to be recorded,<br>
and  records  the  defect address  for  indicating the  place  and the<br><br>
68<br>
corresponding spare address onto the defect list 122 (step S39).<br>
When the above-described steps S35 to S39 ends with respect to a series of blocks of the record data to be recorded this time, the CPU 361 records the updated defect management information 120 twice repeatedly in the unrecorded area in the temporary defect management area 104 or 105 of the optical disc 100 (step S4l). Incidentally, the defect management information 120 recorded in the temporary defect management area 104 or 105 is the defect management information stored in the DMI generator 360. Then, the recording operation is completed.<br>
Next,   a   finalize   operation   of the   recording   /   reproducing<br>
apparatus   200   will   be   explained.       FIG.    19   shows   a   finalize<br>
operation   of   the   recording   /   reproducing   apparatus   200.       For<br>
example,   when  the   user  inputs  an  instruction  for   indicating   to<br>
finalize (the step S32 in FIG.  18: YES), as shown in FIG.  19, the<br>
recording / reproducing apparatus 200 confirms that the optical disc<br>
100 is not finalized yet (step S51- NO) and finalizes the optical disc<br>
100   (step   S52).      Upon   finalizing,   the   recording   /   reproducing<br>
apparatus 200 records the defect management information 120 twice<br>
repeatedly    in .  the    unrecorded    area    in    the    definite    defect<br>
management area  106 or  107 on the optical disc  100  (step  S53).<br>
Incidentally,  the  defect management information   120 recorded  in<br>
the   definite   defect   management  area   106   or   107   is   the   defect<br>
management information stored in the DMI generator 360.    Then,<br>
the finalizing is completed.<br>
Next, when the user inputs an instruction to eject the optical<br><br>
69<br>
disc 100 from the recording / reproducing apparatus 200 (the step<br>
S31   in   FIG.   IS-"  YES),   as   shown   in   FIG.   20,   the   recording  /<br>
reproducing apparatus 200 ejects the optical disc 100 immediately<br>
(step S61).<br>
5	Next, a reproduction operation of the recording / reproducing<br>
apparatus  200 will be  explained.    FIG.  21  shows  a reproduction operation of the recording / reproducing apparatus 200.<br>
When the user inputs an instruction of starting to reproduce<br>
(the step S33 in FIG. 18: YES), as shown in FIG. 21, the recording /<br>
10     reproducing apparatus 200 confirms that the optical disc 100 is not<br>
a blank disc (the step S 71: NG), and reproduces the record data<br>
recorded in the user data area 108 on the optical disc 100 (step S72).<br>
The recording / reproducing  apparatus 200 reproduces the record<br>
data while performing the defect management on the basis of the<br>
15      defect     management     information     120    stored     in     the    defect<br>
management device 477 of the backend 400.<br>
As described above, according to the recording / reproducing<br>
apparatus 200, it records the defect management information 120<br>
into  the   temporary  defect   management  area   104  or   105  on  the<br>
20     optical disc 100 before finalizing the optical disc 100, and it records<br>
the   defect  management  information   120  into   the   definite  defect<br>
management area 106 or 107 on the optical disc 100 when finalizing<br>
the optical disc 100.    With respect to the optical disc 100 which is<br>
not finalized yet, the recording / reproducing apparatus 200 reads<br>
25     the defect management information 120 from the temporary defect<br>
management area 104 nr 105 on the optical disc 100.    With respect<br><br>
70<br>
to the optical disc 100 which is already finalized, the recording / reproducing apparatus 200 reads the defect management information 120 from the definite defect management area 106 or 107 on the optical disc 100. This makes it possible to realize the 5 recording or reproducing of the record data while performing the appropriate defect management with respect to both the optical disc 100 which is not finalized yet and the optical disc 100 which is already finalized.<br>
According to the recording / reproducing apparatus 200 in the<br>
10 example, it is constructed to record the defect management<br>
information 120 into the definite defect management area 106 or<br>
107 on the optical disc 100 upon finalizing. Thus, it is possible to<br>
establish the compatibility between the write-once-type optical disc<br>
100 and a general rewritable optical disc.<br>
15	In    the    above-described    example,    the    case     where    the<br>
write-once-type    recording   medium    of   the   present   invention   is applied to a one-layer optical disc is taken as the example.    The present invention, however, is not limited to this example and can be  applied to  a two  or more  layer  optical disc.     FIG.   22  shows 20      another example in which the write-once-type recording medium of the present invention is applied to a two-iayer optical disc 150.    A first layer of the two-layer optical disc 150 in FIG. 22 (the upper part of FIG. 22) is provided with: a lead-in area  151J a data zone 152; and a lead-out area 153, as with the optical disc  100, with a 25     temporary defect management area 154 placed between the lead-in area   151   and   the   data   zone   152,   and   with   a   temporary   defect<br><br>
71<br>
management area  155 placed between the data zone  152 and the<br>
lead-out area 153.    The lead-in area 151 and the lead-out area 153<br>
are provided with definite defect management areas 156 and 157,<br>
respectively.    The data zone 152 is provided with: a user data area<br>
5      158; a spare area  159." and a spare area  160.    A second layer is<br>
provided with: a lead-in area 171," a data zone 1721 and a lead-out<br>
area  173,   as with  the  optical disc  100,  with  a  temporary  defect<br>
management area 174 placed between the lead-in area 171 and the<br>
data zone  172, and with a temporary defect management area 175<br>
10     placed between the data zone 172 and the lead-out area 173.    The<br>
lead-in   area   171   and   the   lead-out   area   173   are   provided   with<br>
definite defect management areas  176 and  177. respectively.    The<br>
data zone 172 is provided with: a user data area 178; a spare area<br>
179; and a spare area 180.<br>
