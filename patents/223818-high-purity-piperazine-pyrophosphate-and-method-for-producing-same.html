				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
HIGH PURITY PIPERAZINE PYROPHOSPHATE AND METHOD FOR<br>
PRODUCING SAME<br>
Technical Field:<br>
[0001]<br>
This invention relates to piperazine pyrophosphate having a reduced sodium<br>
content and a process of producing the same. More particularly, it relates to piperazine<br>
pyrophosphate useful as a component of a flame retardant composition added to<br>
synthetic resins and to a process of obtaining such piperazine pyrophosphate with high<br>
purity at low cost by dehydration condensation of piperazine diphosphate obtained by<br>
the reaction between phosphoric acid and piperazine.<br>
Background Art:<br>
[0002]<br>
Recently, piperazine pyrophosphate is attracting attention as a component<br>
developing an excellent effect in a flame retardant composition added to synthetic resins.<br>
A number of reports have been made on the preparation of piperazine pyrophosphate.<br>
[0003]<br>
For example, Patent Document 1 discloses a process in which piperazine<br>
hydrochloride and sodium pyrophosphate are allowed to react in an aqueous solution to<br>
give piperazine pyrophosphate as a sparingly water soluble precipitate. Patent<br>
Document 2 discloses a process in which anhydrous piperazine and anhydrous sodium<br>
pyrophosphate are allowed to react in an aqueous solution, and the reaction system is<br>
treated with hydrochloric acid to give piperazine pyrophosphate as a sparingly water<br>
Soluble precipitate. Patent Document 3 teaches a process in which sodiumV<br>
pyrophosphate is treated with hydrochloric acid, and the resulting pyrophosphoric acid<br>
is allowed to react with hydrazine in an aqueous solution to form piperazine<br>
pyrophosphate as a sparingly water soluble precipitate.<br>
[0004]<br>
In the processes disclosed in these references, however, it is difficult in practice<br>
to completely remove by-produced sodium chloride or sodium piperazine<br>
pyrophosphate by washing with water. It is known that, when piperazine<br>
pyrophosphate from a system containing a residual alkaline substance is applied to<br>
semiconductor devices, electronic equipment, etc., the alkaline substance generally<br>
gives adverse influences. Moreover, production by these processes involves high cost<br>
because (1) the production yield is low, (2) the raw materials are expensive, (3) waste<br>
disposal is costly, or (4) use of hydrochloric acid necessitates use of a glass-lined<br>
reaction vessel.<br>
[0005]<br>
Patent Document 1: JP-A-47-88791<br>
Patent Document 2: U.S. Patent 3,810,850<br>
Patent Document 3: U.S. Patent 4,599,375<br>
Disclosure of the Invention:<br>
Problems to be Solved by the Invention:<br>
[0006]<br>
Problems to be solved associated with use of piperazine pyrophosphate<br>
obtained by conventiona process as a component of a flame retardant composition<br>
consist in that a synthetic resin containing the flame retardant composition exhibits<br>
unsatisfactory physical properties by the influences of the impurity, that a flame<br>
refardant composition exhibiting excellent flame retardancy was not obtained by the<br>
influences of the impurity, and that the conventional processes were unable to produce<br>
piperazine pyrophosphate at low cost.<br>
[0007]<br>
Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide high purity<br>
piperazine pyrophosphate providing a flame retardant composition exhibiting excellent<br>
flame retardancy and a process of preparing such piperazine pyrophosphate at low cost.<br>
Means for Solving the Problems:<br>
[0008]<br>
The present inventors have conducted extensive investigations to solve the<br>
problems and as a result found that use of piperazine pyrophosphate having an impurity<br>
content controlled below a specific level provides a flame retardant composition<br>
exhibiting excellent flame retardancy and that such piperazine pyrophosphate can be<br>
provided by dehydration condensation of piperazine diphosphate. The present<br>
invention has been reached based on these findings.<br>
[0009]<br>
The present invention provides piperazine pyrophosphate represented by<br>
chemical formula (I) shown below and having a sodium content of 10 ppm or lower.<br>
[0010]<br>
[Chemical Formula 1]<br><br>
[0011]<br>
The present invention also provides a process of producing the piperazine<br>
pyrophosphate including dehydration condensation of piperazine diphosphate.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention:<br>
[0012]<br>
The piperazine pyrophosphate and the process of producing the same according<br>
to the present invention will be described in detail with particular reference to the<br>
preferred embodiments thereof.<br>
[0013]<br>
The piperazine pyrophosphate of the invention has a sodium content of 10 ppm<br>
or lower. Having a sodium content of 10 ppm or lower, the piperazine pyrophosphate<br>
of the invention provides a flame retardant composition exhibiting excellent flame<br>
retardancy without impairing the physical properties of a resin in which the composition<br>
is incorporated.<br>
[0014]<br>
Impurities that can be present in the piperazine pyrophosphate of the invention<br>
include sodium chloride, orthophosphoric acid, and triphosphoric acid. The total<br>
content of these impurities in the piperazine pyrophosphate of the invention is<br>
preferably not more than 5% by weight.<br>
[0015]<br>
The piperazine pyrophosphate of the invention which is represented by<br>
chemical formula (I) and has a sodium content of 10 ppm or less can be obtained<br>
through dehydration condensation of piperazine diphosphate. Dehydration<br>
condensation of piperazine diphosphate can be carried out by, for example, heating<br>
piperazine diphosphate at 120° to 320°C for 0.5 to 3 hours.<br>
[0016]<br>
Piperazine diphosphate is obtainable by allowing two equivalents of<br>
orthophosphoric acid and one equivalent of piperazine to react in accordance with the<br>
reaction scheme in Chemical Formula 2 shown below. The reaction can be performed<br>
by heating in a solvent, such as water or methanol, at 200° to 250°C for 0.5 to 1 hour.<br>
[0017]<br>
[Chemical Formula 2]<br>
[0018]<br>
Means for effecting the dehydration condensation reaction of piperazine<br>
diphosphate is not particularly limited as long as heating and dehydration may be<br>
conducted. Useful means include heating/kneading equipment, hot-air drying<br>
equipment, and a dehydration method by refluxing in a solvent.<br>
[0019]<br>
In the method using heating/kneading equipment, piperazine diphosphate is<br>
dehydrated and condensed at a heating temperature of 120° to 320°C, a raw material<br>
feed rate of 20 to 100 kg/h, and a number of revolutions of 60 to 1600 rpm. Common<br>
equipment for kneading can be employed with no particular restrictions as long as a<br>
desired piperazine pyrophosphate product can be produced in large quantities<br>
economically. Examples of the equipment include an extruder, a Henschel mixer, a<br>
flash mixer, a paddle mixer, a Banbury mixer, a grinding mixer, an SC processor, a<br>
Plastomill, a KRC kneader, a vacuum kneader, and a pressure kneader. Among them<br>
an extruder and a Henschel mixer are suited because the contact between the contents<br>
and the equipment is minimized to help the reaction proceed efficiently.<br>
[0020]<br>
In the method using hot air drying equipment, piperazine diphosphate is<br>
condensed with dehydration at a hot air temperature of 200° to 350°C. Common hot<br>
air drying equipment can be employed with no particular restrictions as long as a<br>
desired piperazine pyrophosphate product can be produced in large quantities<br>
economically. Examples of the equipment include a fluidized bed dryer, a vibrating<br>
dryer, a vibrating fluidized bed dryer, a stirring dryer, a flash dryer, a through-flow dryer,<br>
a shelf dryer, Dry Mystar, a drum dryer, an air dryer, a microwave dryer, a spray dryer, a<br>
disc dryer, a conical dryer, a paddle dryer, a hopper dryer, and a rotary dryer.<br>
[0021]<br>
The method of dehydration in a refluxing solvent is a method in which<br>
piperazine diphosphate is dehydrated and condensed in a high boiling inert solvent at<br>
120° to 320°C in the presence of 0 to 5% by weight, based on the piperazine<br>
diphosphate, of a catalyst.<br>
[0022]<br>
The high boiling inert solvent is a solvent having a boiling point at or above the<br>
boiling point of water and capable of vaporizing together with water. Examples of<br>
such solvents include IP2028 and IP1620 (both from Idemitsu Petrochemical Co., Ltd.),<br>
normal paraffin, liquid paraffin, xylene, cumene, BTX, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, n-<br>
undecane, n-dodecane, n-tridecane, n-tetradecane, decaline, dipentene, bicyclohexyl,<br>
ethylcyclohexane, p-menthane, camphor oil, turpentine oil, and pine oil. The high<br>
boiling inert solvent preferably has a boiling point of 100° to 350°C. Preferred of the<br>
examples are IP2028 and liquid paraffin because of their boiling points appropriate for<br>
producing high purity piperazine pyrophosphate with good efficiency. The high<br>
boiling inert solvent is preferably used in an amount of 50 to 500 parts by weight per<br>
100 parts by weight of piperazine diphosphate.<br>
[0023]<br>
The catalyst includes boron phosphate, phosphoric acid, zinc oxide, titanium<br>
oxide, and aluminum oxide, with boron phosphate and phosphoric acid being preferred<br>
for capability of accelerating the reaction. A catalyst is not always necessary.<br>
[0024]<br>
The piperazine pyrophosphate produced by dehydration condensation of<br>
piperazine diphosphate is substantially free from impurities and excellent in physical<br>
properties such as heat resistance and water resistance.<br>
[0025]<br>
Excellent in water resistance, the piperazine pyrophosphate obtained by the<br>
process of the present invention is suited for use as a flame retardant for resins.<br>
Excellent in heat resistance, it suffers from no change in composition when exposed to<br>
molding temperatures as a flame retardant of resins. The piperazine pyrophosphate of<br>
the invention can be applied to various resins. The resins include thermoplastic resins<br>
and thermosetting resins. The thermoplastic resins include polyolefins and olefin<br>
copolymers, such as a-olefin polymers, e.g., polypropylene, high-density polyethylene,<br>
low-density polyethylene, linear low-density polyethylene, polybutene-1, and poly-3-<br>
methylpentene, an ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, and an ethylene-propylene<br>
copolymer; halogen-containing resins, such as polyvinyl chloride, polyvinylidene<br>
chloride, chlorinated polyethylene, chlorinated polypropylene, polyvinylidene fluoride,<br>
chlorinated rubber, a vinyl chloride-vinyl acetate copolymer, a vinyl chloride-ethylene<br>
copolymer, a vinyl chloride-vinylidene chloride copolymer, a vinyl chloride-vinylidene<br>
chloride-vinyl acetate terpolymer, a vinyl chloride-acrylic ester copolymer, a vinyl<br>
chloride-maleic ester copolymer, and a vinyl chloride-cyclohexyl maleimide copolymer;<br>
petroleum resins, coumarone resins, polystyrene, polyvinyl acetate, acrylic resins;<br>
copolymers of styrene and/or a-methylstyrene and other monomer(s) (e.g., maleic<br>
anhydride, phenylmaleimide, methyl methacrylate, butadiene, and acrylonitrile), such as<br>
AS resins, ABS resins, MBS resins, and heat resistant ABS resins; polymethyl<br>
methacrylate, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl formal, polyvinyl butyral; linear polyesters,<br>
such as polyethylene terephthalate and polybutylene terephthalate; polyphenylene<br>
oxide; polyamides, such as polycaprolactam and polyhexamethylene adipamide;<br>
polycarbonate, polycarbonate/ABS resin, branched polycarbonate, polyacetal,<br>
polyphenylene sulfide, polyurethane, and cellulosic resins; and mixtures of these resins.<br>
The thermoplastic resins include phenol resins, urea resins, melamine resins, epoxy<br>
resins, and unsaturated polyester resins. Preferred of the recited resins are<br>
polypropylene resins.<br>
[0026]<br>
When the piperazine pyrophosphate of the invention is used as a flame<br>
retardant, it is preferably added in an amount of 20 to 60 parts by weight per 100 parts<br>
by weight of the resin. The piperazine pyrophosphate of the invention can be used in<br>
combination with other flame retardants, such as melamine pyrophosphate, piperazine<br>
polyphosphate, melamine polyphosphate, polyphosphoric acid amide, phosphoric esters,<br>
and phosphoric ester amides; and compounding additives, such as polysiloxane<br>
compounds, metal oxides, silicon dioxide, and higher aliphatic carboxylic acids. The<br>
amount of the other flame retardants to be used in combination is preferably 50 to 400<br>
parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the piperazine pyrophosphate of the<br>
invention. The amount of the compounding additives to be used in combination is<br>
preferably 0.05 to 20 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the resin. The other<br>
flame retardant and compounding additive may previously mixed with the piperazine<br>
pyrophosphate of the invention to prepare a flame retardant composition, which can be<br>
incorporated into the resin.<br>
Example:<br>
[0027]<br>
The present invention will now be illustrated in greater detail with reference to<br>
Examples, Comparative Examples, and Application Examples. It should be<br>
understood that the invention is not construed as being limited thereto, nevertheless.<br>
[0028]<br>
The purity, sodium content, and decomposition point of piperazine<br>
pyrophosphate products obtained in Examples and Comparative Examples were<br>
measured as follows.<br>
[0029]<br>
(1) Measurement of purity<br>
Purity was determined using an HPLC available from Senshu Scientific Co.,<br>
Ltd. (pump: SSC-3150; RI detector: ERC-7515A), a column oven CO-965 from JASCO<br>
Corp., and Shodex OH pak column SB-802.5 HQ under conditions of a temperature of<br>
40°C, a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min, and a sensitivity of 32 x 10-5 RIU/F.S.<br>
[0030]<br>
(2) Measurement of sodium content<br>
The sodium content was determined by elemental analysis with an ICP-AES<br>
instrument.<br>
[0031]<br>
(3) Measurement of decomposition point<br>
TG analysis was carried out. The temperature at 5% weight loss (the<br>
temperature at which the sample's weight reduced by 5 wt%) was read as a<br>
decomposition point.<br>
[0032]<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Piperazine diphosphate was kneaded under heat in an extruder (TEX44aII-<br>
52.5BW from The Japan Steel Works, Ltd.) under conditions of a cylinder temperature<br>
of 230° to 280°C, a raw material feed rate of 25 kg/h, and a screw rotation speed of<br>
60 rpm to give piperazine pyrophosphate as a white powder.<br>
[0033]<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Piperazine diphosphate weighing 40 kg was kneaded under heat in a Henschel<br>
mixer (FM150J/T from Mitsui Mining Co., Ltd.; capacity: 150 L) under conditions of<br>
190° to 250°C and 704 to 1000 rpm for 1 hour to give piperazine pyrophosphate as a<br>
white powder.<br>
[0034]<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Piperazine diphosphate weighing 5 kg and 100 g of 75 wt% phosphoric acid<br>
were mixed under heat in a Henschel mixer (FM150J/T from Mitsui Mining Co., Ltd.;<br>
capacity: 150 L) under conditions of 170° to 250°C and 990 to 1590 rpm for 1 hour to<br>
give piperazine pyrophosphate as a white powder.<br>
[0035]<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
In a four-necked flask equipped with a stirrer, a dropping runnel, a<br>
thermometer, and a Dean-Stark trap were put 30 g of piperazine diphosphate, 100 g of<br>
IP2028, and 0.9 g of 85 wt% phosphoric acid and mixed by heating at 210° to 230°C for<br>
2 hours to give 27.1 g (yield: 97%) of piperazine pyrophosphate as a white powder.<br>
[0036]<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
In a four-necked flask equipped with a stirrer, a dropping funnel, a<br>
thermometer, and a Dean-Stark trap were put 30 g of piperazine diphosphate, 100 g of<br>
IP2028, and 0.9 g of boron phosphate and mixed by heating at 210° to 230°C for 2<br>
hours to give 27.5 g (yield: 98%) of piperazine pyrophosphate as a white powder.<br>
[0037]<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
In a four-necked flask equipped with a stirrer, a dropping funnel, a<br>
thermometer, and a Dean-Stark trap were put 30 g of piperazine diphosphate and 100 g<br>
of IP2028 and mixed by heating at 240° to 250°C for 2 hours to give 26.2 g (yield:<br>
94%) of piperazine pyrophosphate as a white powder.<br>
[0038]<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
In a four-necked flask equipped with a stirrer, a dropping funnel, a<br>
thermometer, and a Dean-Stark trap were put 300 g of piperazine diphosphate and<br>
1000 g of normal paraffin H (from Nippon Oil Corp.) and mixed by heating at 230° to<br>
250°C for 0.5 hours to give 271.2 g (yield: 97%) of piperazine pyrophosphate as a white<br>
powder.<br>
[0039]<br>
EXAMPLE 8<br>
Piperazine diphosphate and melamine phosphate were mixed under heat at a<br>
weight ratio of 1:1 in an extruder (TEX44aII-52.5BW from The Japan Steel Works,<br>
Ltd.) under conditions of a cylinder temperature of 230° to 270°C, a raw material feed<br>
rate of 60 kg/h, and a screw rotation speed of 60 rpm to obtain a 1:1 (by weight) mixture<br>
of piperazine pyrophosphate and melamine pyrophosphate as a white powder, which<br>
was found to have a sodium content of 0 ppm. The 1% weight loss temperature of the<br>
mixture was 300°C.<br>
[0040]<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1<br>
In 300 g of water was dispersed 0.5 mol of sodium pyrophosphate. The<br>
dispersion was cooled to 10°C, and 1 mol of hydrochloric acid was added thereto. To<br>
the dispersion was added 0.5 mol of piperazine (purity: 97%) dissolved in 800 g of<br>
water at 20°C or lower, whereupon a white solid precipitated. The reaction system<br>
was stirred at 10°C for 3 hours. The white solid was collected by filtration and washed<br>
with water. To the filtrate was added 300 g of methanol, and the thus precipitated<br>
white solid was collected by filtration and washed with methanol and water. The<br>
combined white solid was dried to give 0.23 mol of piperazine pyrophosphate as a white<br>
powder.<br>
[0041]<br>
The purity, sodium content, and decomposition point of the piperazine<br>
pyrophosphate products obtained in Examples 1 to 7 and Comparative Example 1 were<br>
measured by the above-described methods. The results of measurements are shown in<br>
Table 1.<br>
[0043]<br>
APPLICATION EXAMPLE AND COMPARATIVE APPLICATION EXAMPLE<br>
A hundred parts by weight of a polypropylene (PP) resin (injection molding<br>
grade, available from Mitsui Chemicals, Inc.) was compounded with 0.1 part by weight<br>
of calcium stearate (lubricant), 0.1 part by weight of tetrakis[methylene-3-(3,5-di-tert-<br>
butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate]methane (phenol antioxidant), and 0.1 part by<br>
weight of bis(2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenyl) pentaerythritol diphosphite (phosphoric<br>
acid antioxidant) to prepare a PP resin composition. A flame retardant composition<br>
shown in Table 1 and an additive (SiO2) were mixed into the PP resin composition, and<br>
the mixture was extruded at 200° to 230°C to obtain pellets. The resulting pellets were<br>
injection molded at 220°C to prepare a 1.6 mm thick specimen, which was subjected to<br>
the UL 94V test according to the following procedure. The piperazine pyrophosphate<br>
as prepared was stored at 50°C under a load of 0.175 kg.cm-1 for one week before use as<br>
a flame retardant.<br>
[0044]<br>
UL Flammability 94V Test:<br>
The specimen of 12.7 mm in width, 127 mm in length, and 1.6 mm in thickness<br>
was positioned vertically, and a burner flame was applied to the lower end of the<br>
specimen for 10 seconds. After 10 seconds, the flame was removed, and the time<br>
required to self-extinguish (burning time) was recorded. As soon as the flame<br>
extinguished, the flame was immediately applied for another 10 seconds. Again the<br>
burning time was recorded. Ignition of the cotton layer put under the specimen by any<br>
drips of flaming particles from the specimen was also observed.<br>
[0045]<br>
The burning time after each flame application and the ignition of the cotton<br>
layer were interpreted into a UL-94 flammability rating. The V-0 rating is the lowest<br>
flammability. The V-l rating is less flame retardancy, and V-2 rating is still less flame<br>
retardancy. A specimen that was not interpreted into any of these ratings was rated<br>
"NR". Furthermore, the oxygen index was measured using the specimens.<br>
[0047]<br>
As is apparent from Table 1, the piperazine pyrophosphate obtained by the<br>
process of the present invention has a lower sodium content and achieves a much higher<br>
yield than the product obtained by a conventional process. As can be seen from Table<br>
2, the flame retardant compositions containing the piperazine pyrophosphate having a<br>
sodium content of 10 ppm or lower that was prepared by the process of the invention<br>
achieve satisfactory results in the UL flammability test and high oxygen indices.<br>
[0048]<br>
It is apparent from these results that use of high purity piperazine<br>
pyrophosphate with a sodium content of 10 ppm or lower provides a flame retardant<br>
composition exhibiting excellent flame retardancy and that such high purity piperazine<br>
pyrophosphate can be obtained by the process of the present invention.<br>
Industrial Applicability:<br>
[0049]<br>
The present invention provides high purity piperazine pyrophosphate and a<br>
process of producing such piperazine pyrophosphate at low cost. Use of the high<br>
purity piperazine pyrophosphate provides a flame retardant composition exhibiting<br>
excellent flame retardancy.<br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1. A process of producing piperazine pyrophosphate represented by chemical<br>
formula (I) which has a sodium content of 10 ppm or lower:<br>
