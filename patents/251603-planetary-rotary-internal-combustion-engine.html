	[0001]		This Application claims the benefit of U. S Provisional Application<br>
5	No. 60/500,117, filed September 4, 2003, and U.S. Provisional Application No.<br>
	60 / 510,204, filed October 10, 2003.<br>
STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR<br>
DEVELOPMENT<br>
	[0002]		Not Applicable<br>
10				BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
		1. Field of Invention<br>
	[0003]		This invention pertains to a rotary engine with planetary rotating<br>
	members. More particularly, this invention pertains to an internal combustion<br>
	engine with multivaned rotating members orbiting about a rotor in a chamber<br>
15	housing.<br>
		2. Description of the Related Art<br>
	[0004]		Rotary motors in the prior art fall into two categories: those that<br>
	are driven by steam and those that are internal combustion engines. Steam<br>
	driven rotary motors typically include an expansion chamber that applies force<br>
20	to a member, causing a rotor to rotate. Examples of such steam driven rotary<br>
	motors include United States Patent Number 949,605, titled "Rotary Motor,"<br>
	issued on February 15, 1910, to W. Taylor; United States patent Number<br>
	3,865,086, titled "Rotary Steam Engine," issued on February 11, 1975, to C.<br>
	Lee; United States Patent Number 5,039,290, titled "Rotary Expander," issued<br>
25	on August 13, 1991, to A. Nardi; and United States Patent Number 6,503,072,<br>
	titled "Pressure articulated positive displacement, single expansion rotary<br>
	engine," issued on January 7, 2003, to Nardi.<br><br>
	WO 2006/020483							PCT/US2005/027685<br>
2<br>
	[0005]		Through the years, attempts at developing a rotary internal<br>
	combustion engine have been made. The most successful of these attempts is<br>
	exemplified by the Wankel engine disclosed in United States Patent Number<br>
	4,926,816, titled "Rotary Piston Engine," issued on May 22, 1990, to Kita, et al.<br>
5	The conventional Wankel engine includes a rotor housing having an inner wall<br>
	of trochodial configuration, a triangular rotor disposed in a rotor cavity of the<br>
	rotor housing for rotation with its apex portions in sliding contact with the<br>
	inner wall of the rotor housing, and an eccentric shaft supporting the rotor.<br>
	[0006]		An early example of a different type of internal combustion rotary<br>
10	engine is disclosed in United States patent Number 2,454,006, titled "Internal-<br>
	Combustion Rotaiy Engine," issued on November 16, 1948, to C.E, Plummer,<br>
	This patent discloses an engine with a cylindrical easing 20 with two abutments<br>
	17,18 protruding into the annular chamber 14 formed by the casing 10 and<br>
	the rotar 13. The annular chamber 14 is divided into a power, firing and<br>
15	exhaust zone 15 and a compression and intake zone 16 that are diametrically<br>
	opposite each other. The rotor 13 has two spider type bladed rotatable vanes<br>
	23 that rotate when engaging the abutments 17, 18. Attached to the casing 10<br>
	is a housing 28 carrying a rotatable combined firing and compression cylinder <br>
	29. Diametrically opposite the housing 28 on the casing 10 are the intake and<br>
20	exhaust leads 21, 22, respectively.<br>
	[0007]		United States Patent Number 3,865,522, titled "Rotary Internal<br>
	Combusion Engine," issued on February 11,-1975, to A.Nardi. This patent<br>
	discloses an engine with a cylindrical casing 10 having a disc-shaped central<br>
	inner cavity 12 with eight radial recesses or notches 14 formed in the casing<br>
25	10. A main disc or rotor 16 is sized to fit into the inner cavity 12. The rotor 16<br>
	has partial circular cavities 20, 22 formed diametrically opposite each other.<br>
	The partial circular cavities 20, 22 receive lever wheels 26, 38 that rotate<br>
	within the partial circular cavities 20, 22. The lever wheels 26, 28 each have<br>
	three equally spaced radial arms 30 that engage the notches 14 as the rotor 16<br>
30	rotates within the casing 10. The fuel intake system includes ducts 34 formed<br>
	through the casing 10 adjacent the notches 14. Exhaust ports 38 are formed<br>
	through the body of the rotor 16 and communicate with an exhaust manifold<br>
	40 vented to the outside of the casing 10. United States Patent Number<br>
	|4,274,374, titled "Air-Cooled Rotary Internal Combustion Engine," issued on<br><br>

	June 23, 1981, to C, Lee, is an improvement on the Lee patent described above.<br>
	The improvement involved adding air-cooling to the engine.<br>
	[0008]		United States Patent Number 4, 481,920, titled "Rotary Internal<br>
	Combustion Engine, Fluid Motor and Fluid Pump Having Planetating Gear<br>
5	Pistons," issued on November 13, 1984, to Carr, et al., discloses an intake rotor<br>
	420 surrounded by three secondary rotors 440, all nested within reactor lobe<br>
	assembly 640. The value plates 330, 230, 240 and the front case cover 150<br>
	each amount forward of reactor lobe assembly 640 with shaft 430 of <br>
	exhaust/intake rotor 420 being journalled within the central hole of rotating<br>
10	valve plate 330, stationary exhaust valve plate 240 and front case cover 150.<br>
	Reactor lobe assembly 640 has nine internal reactor lobes 460 with spark plug<br>
	access holes 195 extending through the lobes 460. Also mounted within the<br>
	reactor lobe assembly 640 is a pressure seal 550 and spring 650 assembly<br>
	which is placed between each reactor lobe 460.<br>
15	[0009]		German Patent Application DE 42 42 966, dated December 18,<br>
	1992, discloses a rotary engine. A housing 13 encloses a cylindrically shaped<br>
	rotor 2, which has four niches 4 in the circumferential surface 3. The niches 4<br>
	receive piatones 5 that have a star-like shape with three lips 7 spaced about the<br>
	center of rotation 6 of the pistons 5. The inner surface 5 of the housing 13 has<br>
20	a wave-shape with troughts 18 and peaks 20. Each of the four peaks 20 have a<br>
	spark plug 14 flanked on the leading side by a exhaust valve 16 and on the<br>
	trailing, side by an intake valve 15.<br>
	[0010]		The pistons 5 rotate clockwise as they orbit the center 1 of the<br>
	rotor 2, which rotates counterclockwise and carries the pistons 5. One or more<br>
	25 of the lips 7 of each piston 5 continuously keeps in contact with the inner<br>
	surface 8 of the housing 13 as the rotor 2 rotates within the housing 13. The<br>
	German Patent Application does not disclose or teach the mechanism by which<br>
	the pistons 5 rotate as they orbit the center 1 of the rotor 2.<br>
	[0011]		Figures 1. and 3-9 of the German application illustrate the pistons<br>
30	5 moving toward the exhaust valves 16, which indicates that the engine uses a<br>
	decreasing volume to push the exhaust out of the exhaust valve 16, Likewise,<br>
	Figures 2 and 3-9 illustrate the pistons 5 moving away from the intake valves<br><br>
	WO 2005/024200							PCT/US 2004/028797<br>
4<br>
	15, which indicates that intake air is sucked into the engine by increasing the<br>
	volume of the chamber, thereby drawing the intake air into the engine.<br>
	[0012]		The operation of the German engine is illustrated in Figs. 4-9 with<br>
	Figs. 4 &amp; 5 showing the engine beginning to rotate. Figures 4-9 use Roman<br>
5	numerals to indicate the rotor 2 position as it rotates in the housing 13. The<br>
	pistons 5 operate in tandem, that is, opposing pistons 5, 5" at positions I, III<br>
	draw intake air-fuel through valves 15', 15" and exhaust combustion gas<br>
	through valves 16, 16". See Fig. 6. At the same time, the other two pistons s.<br>
	5'" at positions II, IV undergo combustion 25', 25" on one side and<br>
10	compression 24', 24'" on the other side. See Fig. 6. Figure 7 shows the<br>
	positions have rotated 90° with the positions rotated counterclockwise, but the<br>
	pistons 5 at those positions performing the same operations. That is, the piston<br>
	5, 5" at positions I, III are always performing intake and exhaust. See Figs. 6<br>
	9, Likewise, the piston 5, 5"' at positions II, IV are always undergoing<br>
15	compression and combustion.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
	[0013]		According to one embodiment of the present invention, a rotary<br>
	internal combustion engine with a plurality of rotating members is provided.<br>
	The rotating members orbit about the center of a rotor as the rotor rotates<br>
20	within a housing with a plurality of lobes. The tips, or apex, of the rotating<br>
	members engage the lobos and a circular cutout in the rotor as the rotor<br>
	rotates. As the rotating members move around the housing the four internal<br>
	combustion cycles (intake, compression, power, and exhaust) occur. As each<br>
	rotating member moves around the housing, the power and exhaust cycles<br>
25	occur on the side of the rotating member vane that is trailing and the intake<br>
	and compression cycles occur on the side of the rotating member that is<br>
	leading. In particular, as one side of the rotating member is compressing the<br>
	intake gas, another side of the rotating member is undergoing the power cycle.<br>
	[0014]		In one embodiment, a back plate attached to one end of the<br>
30	housing includes inlet and exhaust ports that are sequentially opened and<br>
	closed by the rotating members and rotor as they move within the housing. A<br>
	from plate rotates with the rotor and separates the combustion chambers from<br><br>
	WO 2005/024200							PCT/US 2004/028797<br>
5<br>
	a planetary gear assembly that ensures the alignment of the rotating members<br>
	as they orbit the rotor shaft.<br>
	[0015]		The intake gas aids in scavenging the combustion gas out the<br>
	exhaust ports. In one embodiment, the intake gas does not contain fuel, which<br>
5	Is injected after the compression cycle is initiated. In another embodiment, the<br>
	intake air passes through a carburetor and an air-fuel-mixture passes through<br>
	the inlet ports. In one embodiment, a spark plug initiates combustion. In<br>
	another embodiment, compression ignition initiates combustion.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
15	[0017]		An apparatus for a rotary engine is disclosed. The embodiment<br>
	illustrated in the figures is a fuel injected internal combustion engine with<br>
	rotating members that orbit around and drive the rotor. The rotary engine 10 is<br>
	adaptable to run on various fuels, including, but not limited to, gasoline and<br>
	diesel. The rotary engine 10 is adaptable burn any type of fluid fuel either with<br>
20	a conventional spark, compression ignition, or other type of ignition system.<br>
	[0018]		Figure 1 illustrates a perspective view of one embodiment of a<br>
	Rotary engine 10. A housing 102 has a front cover 104 and a back plate 106.<br>
	The front cover 104 and the back plate 106 are secured to the housing 102 by<br>
	through-bolts 122 and corresponding nuts 124. A rotor shaft 108 extends<br>
25	from the front cover 104. Visible behind the back plate 106 is a manifold 116<br>
	for the intake and exhaust ports 502, 504. Also illustrated on the side of the<br>
	housing 102 is one of the three spark plugs 112 and one of the three fuel<br>
	injectors 114.<br><br>
	WO 2005/024200							PCT/US 2004/028797<br>
7<br>
	[0019]		Figure 2 illustrates a perspective view of one embodiment of a<br>
	rotary engine 10 with the front cover 104 removed. An idler plate 204 is<br>
	attached to a front support plate 202 with fasteners 214. This assembly 202,<br>
	204 rotates with the rotor shaft 108 and supports the idler gear shafts to rotate<br>
5	with the rotor shaft 108. A sun gear mount 212 has an opening for the rotor<br>
	shaft 108 and fits within an opening in the idler plate 204. The sun gear<br>
	mount 212 is adapted to be fastened to the front cover 104 and is stationary<br>
	relative to the housing 102. In one embodiment, the sun gear mount 212<br>
	includes a bearing supporting the rotor shaft 108.<br>
10	[0020]		Visible in Figure 2 are the through-openings 322 for receiving the<br>
	engine fasteners 122. Also visible are openings 232 in the housing 102 that<br>
	correspond to openings 132 in the front cover 104. Alignment pins (not<br>
	 illustrated) inserted into the openings 232 aid in the assembly of the front cover<br>
	104 to the housing 1O2.<br>
15	[0021]		Figure 3 illustrates a perspective view of one embodiment of a<br>
	rotary engine 10 showing the planetary gear assembly. In this view, the idler<br>
	plate 204 axid sun gear mwint 212 have been removed, snowing the three<br>
	rotating member gears 206, the three idler gears 306, and the sun gear 308,<br>
	In the illustrated embodiment, all the gears 206, 306, 308 have the same<br>
20	number of teeth, The sun gear 30.8 is stationary relative to the housing 102,<br>
	and as the rotating member gears 206 orbit about the sun gear 308, the<br>
	rotating member gears 206 maintain the same orientation, that is, the teeth of<br>
	the rotating member gears 206 do not rotate relative to the teeth of the sun gear<br>
	308. In one embodiment, the sun gear 308 is secured to the sun gear mount<br>
25	212. In another embodiment where the number of rotating members 1006 are<br>
	not the same as the number of lobes 1112, the rotating member gears 206<br>
	rotate so as to ensure that the tips 1106 of the rotating members 1006<br>
	maintain contact with, the lobes 1112 as the rotating members 1006 orbit the<br>
	rotor shaft 108. Those skilled in the art will recognise that other mechanisms<br>
30	can be used to orbit the rotating members 1006 about the rotor 1002 without<br>
	departing from the scope or spirit of the present invention.<br>
	[0022]		A front support plate 202 rotates relative to the housing 102, but<br>
	the plate 202 is stationary relative to the rotor shaft 108. The front support<br><br>
	WO 2005/024200							PCT/US 2004/028797<br>
8<br>
	plate 202 has openings for the rotating member shafts 316, which carry the<br>
	rotating member gears 206. In one embodiment, the rotating member shafts<br>
	316 engage bearings in the front support plate 202 and idler plats 204.<br>
	[0023]		The plate 202 also supports the idler shafts 326, which carry the<br>
5	idler gears 306. In one embodiment, the idler shafts 326 are fixed in the front<br>
	support plate 202 and idler plate 204, and the idler gears 306 rotate on the<br>
	idler shafts 336. In another embodiment, the idler gears 306 are fixed to the<br>
	idler shafts 326 and the idler shafts 326 enage bearings in the front support<br>
	plate 202 and the idler plate 204.<br>
10	[0024]		Figure 4 illustrates an exploded view of one embodiment of the<br>
	rotary engine 10 showing the front cover 104, the idler plate 204, the planetry<br>
	gear configuration 206, 306, 308, the housing 102, the back plate 206, and<br>
	the manifold 116. In one embodiment, the bolts 122 extend through the<br>
	housing 102, connecting the front cover 104, the housing 102, and the back<br>
15	plate 106 by engaging the bolts 124. In other embodiments, the housing 102<br>
	includes studs or accepts bolts securing the front cover 104 and the back plate<br>
	106 to the housing 102.<br>
	[0025]		Figure 5 illustrates a perspective view of the rear of one<br>
	embodiment of a rotary engine 10 with the manifold 116 removed. In the<br>
20	Illustrated embodiment, the rotor shaft 108 extends through the back plate<br>
	106. Surrounding the rotor shaft 108 are the exhaust ports 302 and the inlet<br>
	ports 504. Figure 7 illustrates the back plate 106 and the arrangement of the<br>
	ports 502, 504.<br>
	[0026]		Figure 6 illustrates a perspective view of the rear of one<br>

	[0029]		The back plate 106 includes a channel 702 in which the back ring<br>

30	illustrates a front plan view of one embodiment of the rotating members 1006<br>
	and rotor 1002 of the rotary engine 10. The housing 102 has a flange 1014<br>

	The outside edge of front support plate 202 is adjacent the surface 1016, which<br>
5	is a radial surface between the flange 1014 and the seating surface 1012. In<br>
	the illustrated embodiment, the front surface of the front support plate 202 is<br>
	even with the front surface of the flange 1014.<br>
	[0033]		Fixed to the rotor shaft 108 is a rotor 1002. The rotor 1002, is<br>
	shown in detail in Figure 13. The rotor 1002 is fixed to the front support plate<br>
10	202, by fasteners inserted in openings 1102. The back side of the rotor 1002 is<br>
	similarly attached to the back ring mount 602, which rotates in the channel<br>
	702 in the back plate 106. Accordingly, the rotor 1002, the rotor shaft 108,<br>
	the front support plate 202, and the back ring mount 602 rotate as a unit.<br>
	[0034]		Fixed to the rotating member shafts 316 are the rotating members<br>
15	1006. The rotating members 1006 are shown in detail in Figure 14. The <br>
	rotating members 1006 revolve about the rotor shaft 108 and rotor 1002. In<br>
	the illustrated embodiment, the rotating members 1006 have three vanes<br>
	ending at points, or tips, 1116 that contact the inside surfaces, or lobes, 1112<br>
	of the housing 102. The back ring mount 602 is visible behind the rotor 1002<br>
20	and the rotating members 1006. The back ring mount 602 fits into the<br>
	channel 702 in the back plate 106.<br>
	[0035]		Visible in Figure 11 is the back plate 106 along with the exhaust<br>
	ports 502 and the intake ports 504. As the rotor 1002 rotates relative to the<br>
	sack plate 106, the aims of the rotor 1002 and the vanes, or arms, of the<br>
25	rotating members 1006 progressively expose the exhaust ports 502 and the<br>
	intake ports 504. The ports 502, 504 are discussed along with Figs. 15A-F,<br>
	which illustrate the operation of the engine 10. <br>
	[0036]		In one embodiment, where the three lobes 1112 of the housing<br>
	102 connect to each other, seals 1114 are positioned. These seals 1114 are<br>
30	discussed along with Fig. 12.<br>
	[0037]		Figure 12 illustrates a front plan view of one embodiment of the<br>
	housing 102 and back plate 106 of the rotary engine 10. The three lobes 1112<br><br>
	WO 2005/024200							PCT/US 2004/028797<br>
11<br>
	of the housing 102 are visible. Each lobe 1112 is joined to its adjacent lobe<br>
	1112 at a peak 1214,<br>
	[0038]		In the illustrated embodiment, where the three lobes 1112 of the<br>
	housing 102 connect to each other are the seals 1114 that engage the outside<br>
5	radial surface 1304 of the rotor 1002 and prevent fluid communication<br>
	between adjacent lobes 1112. The seats 1114 are formed by a slit in the<br>
	trailing side of the peak 1214, as seen by the rotor 1002 as it rotates about the<br>
	rotor shaft 108. The peaks 1214 are positioned from the center rotor shaft 108<br>
	such that the outer surface 1304 of the rotor 1002 contacts the peaks 1214.<br>
10	The slit allows the peak 1214 between the lobes 1112 to resiliently contact the<br>
	radial surface 13O4 of the rotor 1002. In one embodiment, the peaks 1214<br>
	have a concave surface that mates with the outer surface 1304 of the rotor<br>
	1002. Those skilled in the art will recognize that other types of seals can be<br>
	used to provide a seal between the rotor 1002 and the peaks 1214 without<br>
15	departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.<br>
	[0039]		Figure 13 illustrates a perspective view of one embodiment of the<br>
	rotor 1002 of the rotary engine 10. The rotor 1002 has a circular shape with<br>
	three circular cutouts 1302 that define three arms 1306A, 1306B, 1306C. The<br>
	portion of the circular shape not cutout forms three outer surfaces 1304. As<br>
20	the rotor 1002 rotates within the housing the three outer surfaces 1304 form a<br>
	seal intermittently with the peaks 1214 of the housing 102. In the illustrated<br>
	embodiment, the outer surfaces 1304 contact the peaks 1214 for a portion of<br>
	the rotation of the rotor 1002. The three circular cutouts 1302 are sized to<br>
	allow each rotating member 1006 to rotate within its respective cutout 1302.<br>
25	The three arms 1306 project radially from the center of the rotor 1002 and are<br>
	separated by 120o. Those skilled in the art will recognise that the number of<br>
	circular cutouts 1302 and areas 1306 can vary with the number of rotating<br>
	members 1006 without departing from the spirit and scope of the present<br>
	invention.<br>
30	[0040]		The front and back surface of the rotor 1002 have channels 1314<br>
	adjacent to the edge of the cutouts 1302 and the outer surfaces 1304. The<br>
	channels 1314 receive a wave spring member 1316 and a sealing member<br>
	1312. The wave spring member 1316 is positioned in the bottom of the<br><br>
	WO 2005/024200							PCT/US 2004/028797<br>
12<br>
	channel 1314 and the sealing member 1312 is positioned adjacent the wave<br>
	spring member. The sealing member 1312 has a rectangular cross-section and<br>
	hag a top surface extending above the respective surface of the rotor 1002. The<br>
	top surface of the sealing member 1312, by virtue of the wave spring member<br>
5	1316, has sliding contact with the front support plate 202 or the back plate<br>
	106. In one embodiment, the wave spring member 1316 is a sheet of spring<br>
	steel having wave shape, and the member 1316 conforms to the curve of the<br>
	channel 1314.<br>
	[0041]		Figure 14 illustrates a perspective view of one embodiment of a<br>
10	rotating member 1006 of the rotary engine 10. The rotating member 1006 has<br>
	a symmetrical three-vaned configuration. The outer surface 1412 of the<br>
	rotating member 1006, which forms the tip 1106, forms a portion of circle with<br>
	the rotating member shaft 316 at the center. The outer surface 1412 at the tip<br>
	1106 contacts the cutout 1302 in the retor 1002 as the rotating member 1006<br>
15	rotates within the cutout 1302.<br>
	[3042]		In the illustrated embodiment, each tip 1106 includes a seal.<br>
	formed by a pair of side lips 1406 with a slit 1404. The lip 1406 resiliently<br>
	deforms upon contact with the lobes 1112 by virtue of the slit 1404 allowing<br>
	the lip 1406 to deflect toward the rotating member shaft 316. Those skilled in<br>
20	the art will recognize that the type of seal at the tips 1106 can vary without <br>
	departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
	[0043]		Between the tips 1106 are the side surfaces 1402 of the rotating<br>
	member 1006. The side surfaces 1402 are arcuate surfaces and have a<br>
	contour to provide clearence from the peaks 1124 when the rotating members<br>
	35 1006 are in the position illustrated in Fig. ll. The shape of the contour<br>
	contributes to the combustion parameters, including compression ratio,<br>
	[0044]		The front and back surface of the rotating member 1006 have<br>
	channels 1416 along the rotating member sides 1402. The channels 1416<br>
	receive a wave spring member 1414 and a sealing member 1406. The wave<br>
30	spring member 1414 is positioned in the bottom of the channel 1416 and the<br>
	sealing member 1406 is positioned adjacent the wave spring member 1414.<br>
	The sealing member 1415 has a rectangular cross-section and has a top<br>
	surface extending above the respective surface of the rotating member 1006.<br><br>

	The top surface of the sealing member 1416, by virtue of the wave spring<br>
	member 1414, has sliding contact with the front support plate 202 or the back<br>
	plate 106 and back ring mount 602. In one embodiment, the wave spring<br>
	member 1414 is a sheet of spring steel having a wave shape, and the member<br>
5	1414 conforms to the curve of the channel 1416.<br>
	[0045]		Figures 15A-F illustrate the rotor 1002 and rotating members.<br>
	1006 rotating through one firing cycle. In the figures, the rotor 1002 rotates<br>
	clockwise and the rotating members 1006 do not rotate relative to the housing<br>
	102, but the rotating members 1006 orbit around the center of the rotor 1002.<br>
10	In the illustrated embodiment, each rotating member 1006 does not rotate<br>
	about its centerline, but remains oriented parallel to its starting position while<br>
	translating with the circular locus of the shaft 316 motion. Each rotating<br>
	member 1006 defines three fluid chambers 1504, 1506, 1508 corresponding to<br>
	one of the three side surfaces 1402 of each rotating member 1006. A reference<br>
15	line 1502 illustrates the top-dead-center position of the rotor 1002. Top-dead-<br>
	center is defined as the position of the rotor 1002 with any rotating member<br>
	1006 positioned such that a fluid chamber has its minimum volume. In Figure<br>
	15A, the rotating member 1006 fluid chamber 1504 is at its minimum volume<br>
	with the rotor 1002 in the illustrated position. For the illustrated embodiment,<br>
30	the rotor 1002 has three top-dead-center positions located 120° apart,<br>
	[0045]		The rotor 1006 rotates 120o between each top-dead-center<br>
	position. During that 120o rotation, one side of each of the three rotating<br>
	members 1006 undergoes a power cycle 1616. As the power cycle 1616<br>
	progresses on the side 1402 of the rotating member 1006 that is trailing, the<br>
25	intake cylic 1612 and the compression cycle 1614 are progressing on the side.<br>
	1402 of the rotating member 1006 that is leading. Accordingly, the following<br>
	discussion of Figs. 15A-F applies to each of the components that are illustrated<br>
	in triplicate, such as the three rotating members 1006, the three inlet ports<br>
	504, the three outlet, or exhaust, ports 502, the three spark plugs 112, and the<br>
30	three fuel injectors 114,<br>
	[0047]		Internal combustion engines require four cycles for operation an<br>
	intake cycle 1612, a compression cycle 1214, a power cycle 1616, and an<br>
	exhaust cycle 1618. Each stroke of a four stroke reciprocating piston internal<br><br>
	WO 2005/024200							PCT/US 2004/028797<br>
14<br>
	combustion engine accomplishes one of these cycles and requires four strokes<br>
	for every power cycle 1616. For a four stroke engine, the crankshaft rotates<br>
	twice for every power cycle 1616 for a single piston. A two-stroke reciprocating<br>
	piston internal combustion engine requires two strokes for every power cycle<br>
5	1616 and the crankshaft rotates once for every power cycle 1616 for a single<br>
	piston. The rotary engine 10 dues not have reciprocating pistons. Instead, the _<br>
	rotating members 1006 of the rotary engine 10 engage a rotor 1002, which<br>
	rotates with the rotating members 1006 in orbit about the rotor 1002. The<br>
	planetary motion of the rotating members 1006, in combination with the rotor<br>
10	1002 and the lobes 1112, accomplishes the four cycles 1612, 1614, 1616,<br>
	1618 with each rotating member 1006 having three power cycles 1616 for<br>
	every rotation of the rotor 1002. The following discussion begins with the<br>
	power cycle 1616 and describes the operation of the rotary engine 10.<br>
	[0048]		Figure 15A illustrates the rotor 1002 and rotating members 1006<br>
15	at top-dead-center. The rotor 1002 has three top-dead-center positions<br>
	separated by 120o. The first fluid chamber 1504 is adjacent the peak 1214<br>
	between two lobes 1112. The volume between the peak 1214 and the leading<br>
	tip 1116 of the rotating member 1006 is the leading fluid chamber 15041, and<br>
	the volume between the trailing tip 1116 of the rotating member 1006 and the<br>
20	peak 1214 is the trailing fluid chamber 1504T.<br>
	[0049]		In the illustrated, position, air has passed from the intake port 504<br>
	and has been compressed between the rotating number 1006 and the housing<br>
	102 in the leading fluid chamber I504L and the trailing fluid chamber 1504T,<br>
	In one embodiment, the fuel injector 114 injects the fuel into the compressed<br>
25	air in the leading fluid chamber 15O4L at top-dead-center, and the spark plug<br>
	112 then fires, igniting the fuel-air mixture in the leading fluid, chamber 1504L.<br>
	In another embodiment, the fuel injector 114 injects the fuel and the spark plug<br>
	112 fires within a few degrees of top-dead-center.<br>
	[0050]		Figure 158 illustrates the rotor 1002 after it rotates 20 degrees<br>
30	clockwise. The compressed inlet gas in the trailing fluid chamber 15D4T is<br>
	forced rapidly into the leading fluid chamber 1504L across the housing peak<br>
	1214, thereby causing turbulence in the leading fluid chamber 1504L. which<br>
	increases efficiency and promotes more rapid fuel combustion rates. The<br><br>
	WO 2005/024200							PCT/US 2004/028797<br>
15<br>
	combustion gas in the leading fluid chamber 1504L expands, causing the<br>
	rotating: member 1006 to force the rotor 1002 to rotate clockwise. It should be<br>
	noted that there is a positive torque vector generated at top-dead-center, unlike<br>
	a reciprocating piston engine or any engine designed with an eccentric<br>
5	crankshaft, such as the Wankel engine. This promotes higher efficiency due to<br>
	greatly reduced pumping in the engine prior to top-dead-center.<br>
	[0051]		Figure 15C illustrates the rotor 1002 after it rotates another 20<br>
	degrees clockwise. The gas in the trailing fluid chamber 1504T has combined<br>
	with the leading fluid chamber 1504L into a single fluid chamber 1504. The<br>
10	combustion gas continues expanding in fluid chamber I504, applying pressure<br>
	to the side wall 1402 of the rotating member 1006 and forcing the rotor 1002<br>
	to continue rotating clockwise.<br>
	[0052]		Figure 15D illustrates the rotor 1002 after it rotates another 20<br>
	degrees clockwise. The combustion gas continues expanding in fluid chamber<br>
15	1504.<br>
	[0053]		Figure 15E illustrates the rotor 1002 after it rotates another 20<br>
	degrees clockwise, and the power cycle started with the rotor 1002 at top-dead-<br>
	center begins to end. The rotor 1002 has uncovered the exhaust port 502 and<br>
	a gap will appear between the trailing edge of the rotor 1003 and the adjacent<br>
20	trailing rotating member 1005 after the rotor 1002 rotates a few more degrees.<br>
	This gap allows the combustion gas in fluid chamber 1504 to flow to the<br>
	exhaust port 502, thereby beginning the exhaust cycle.<br>
	[0054]		Figure 15F illustrates the rotor 1002 after it rotates another 20<br>
	degrees clockwise. The exhaust cycle continues and the intake cycle begins.<br>
25	The inlet port 804 is exposed by the rotor 1002, allowing fresh air to enter the<br>
	fluid chamber 1504. The intake air begins to scavenge the exhaust gas across<br>
	the fluid chamber 1504 to the fluid chamber 1506A of the adjacent rotating<br>
	member 1006.<br>
	[0055]		Referring back to Figure 15A, with the rotor 1002 in the top-dead-<br>
30	center position, the openings connecting the fluid chamber 1508 with the fluid<br>
	chamber 1506A are equal. The exhaust gas is being scavenged with the intake<br>
	gas flowing counterclockwise from the inlet port 504 in fluid chamber 1508 to<br><br>
	WO 2005/024200							PCT/US 2004/028797<br>
16<br>
	the exhaust port 502 in fluid chamber 1506A. With the rotor 1002 in this<br>
	position, the exhaust cycle 1616 and the intake cycle 1612 continue.<br>
	[0056]		Referring back to Figure 15B, the exhaust port 502 has just been<br>
	covered by the rotating member 1006. With the exhaust port 502 covered, the<br>
5	exhaust cycle 1618 is completed. The intake cycle 1612 is also coming to an<br>
	end as the rotor 1002 and the rotating member 1006 close the fluid<br>
	communication between the inlet port 504 and the fluid chamber 1506.<br>
	[0057]		Referring back to Figure 15C, the intake cycle 1612 is complete<br>
	and the compression cycle 1614 begins for the next power cycle 1618. The<br>
10	fluid chamber 1506 is now a closed chamber with a decreasing volume as the<br>
	rotor 1002 continue a clockwise. The fluid chamber 1508 is open to the<br>
	exhaust port 502 and is bounded by the rotor wall 1302 and the rotating<br>
	member side wall 1402. The gas in the fluid chsjnher 1508 provides cooling of <br>
	the rotor 1002 and the rotating member 1006.<br>
15	[0058]		Referring back to Figure 15D, the compression cycle 1614<br>
	continues as the volume of the fluid chamber 1506 continues to decrease. The<br>
	fluid chamber 1508 is open to both the exhaust port 502 and the inlet port<br>
	504. The glass to the fluid chamber 1508 provides cooling of the rotor 1002 and<br>
	the rotating member 1006.<br>
20	[0059]		Referring back to Figure 15E, the compression cycle 1614 is<br>
	almost complete. The inlet port 504 is covered by the rotating member 1006.<br>
	The exhaust port 502 is being uncovered by the rotor 1002 in the fluid<br>
	Chamber 1508.<br>
	[0060]		Referring back to Figure 15F, the compressed gas in the fluid<br>
25	chamber 1506 is divided between the trailing camber 1506T and the leading<br>
	Chamber 1506L, which are divided by the peak 1214. In one embodiment the<br>
	peak 1214 does not contact the side 1402 of the rotating member 1006 such<br>
	that the compressed gas is prevented from flowing between the chambers<br>
	1506T, 15061. The fluid chamber 1504 is about to connect to the fluid<br>
30	chamber 1506A after the rotating member tip 1106 loses contact with the rotor<br>
	wall 1302. The combustion gas in the fluid chamber 1504 will then move into<br>
	the fluid chamber 1506A where it will exhaust through the exhaust port 502.<br><br>
	WO 2005/024200							PCT/US 2004/028797<br>
17<br>
	The inlet ports 504 are not yet exposed. The rotor 1002 continues rotating<br>
	clockwise to the top-dead-center position, where the next sequence of cycles<br>
	begins again.<br>
	[0061]		As is apparent from the above discussion, for each, complete<br>
5	revolution of the rotor 1002, there are nine power cycles 1616. Each of the<br>
	three rotating members 1006 have three power cycles 1616 for every revolution<br>
	of the rotor 1002. Because the rotating members 1006 are equally spaced<br>
	about the rotor 1002, the forces developed during the power cycles 1616 are<br>
	balanced about the rotor 1002.<br>
10	[0062]		In operation, the rotor 1002 rotates clockwise, and the rotor outer<br>
	surfaces 1304, as they contact the peaks 1214, provide a seal between, adjacent<br>
	fluid chambers 1504, 1506, 1503. The rotating members 1006 rotate, relative<br>
	to the rotor 1002, counterclockwise. The tips 1106 of the rotating members<br>
	1006, as they contact the lobes 1112, provide a seal between adjacent fluid<br>
15	chambers 1504, 1506, 1508. The planetary gear assembly 206, 306, 308<br>
	ensures that the rotating members 1006 move with the proper relationship with<br>
	the rotor 1002.<br>
	[0063]		Figure 16 illustrates the four internal combustion cycles for a<br>
	single rotating member 1006 with three side surfaces 1402 as the rotating<br>
20	member 1006 orbits a full 360o around the rotor 1002. Three concentric rings<br>
	represent the cycles for each of the side surfaces 1402, 1402, 1402 of a<br>
	rotating member 1006. The four cycles include the intake cycle 1612, the<br>
	compression cycle 1614, the power cycle 1616, and the exhaust cycle 1618.<br>
	The exhaust cycle 1618 and the intake cycle 1612 are separated by a dead<br>
25	zone 1620 when the side surface 1402 of the rotating member 1006 faces the<br>
	cutout region 1302 of the rotor 1002. Figure 16 depicts the 360o rotation of<br>
	the rotor 1002, showing top-dead-center 1602, 1602, 1602" at 0o, 120%, and<br>
	240o. Referring to Fig. 15A, top-dead-center is with the rotor 1002 oriented<br>
	with the outer surfaces 1304 centered in the lobes 1112. The following<br>
30	discussion applies to a single side surface 1402 of a rotating member, which for<br>
	illustration purposes forms one boundary of the fluid chamber 1504. It should<br>
	be remembered that the four internal combustion cycles 1612, 1614, 1616,<br>
	1681 repeat far each, rotating member 1006 and that these cycles 1612, 1614,<br><br>
	WO 2005/024200							PCT/US 2004/028797<br>
18<br>
	1616, 1615 repeat for every 120o rotation of the rotor 1002 because each<br>
	rotating member 1006 has three side surfaces 1402 separated by 120°.<br>
	Accordingly, these cycles 1612, 1614, 1616, 1618 will repeat nine times for<br>
	each revolution of the rotor 1002:<br>
5	[0064]		The intake cycle 1612 begins approximately 140° before top-dead-<br>
	center. The intake cycle 1612 begins when the rotating member 1003 uncovers<br>
	the inlet ports 504, thereby allowing gas to enter the chamber. The inlet ports<br>
	504 are uncovered by the rotating members 1006 as the rotor 1002 rotates<br>
	from the position illustrated in Fig. 15F to the position illustrated in Fig. 15A.<br>
10	The intake cycle 1612 completes when the inlet ports 504 are covered by the<br>
	rotor 1002 as the rotor 1002 rotates from the position illustrated in Fig. 15A to<br>
	the position illustrated in Fig. 15B.<br>
	[0065]		After completion of the intake cycle 1612, the compression cycle<br>
	1614 begjns. The compression cycle 1614 is completed when the rotor 1002 is<br>
15	at or near top-dead-center 1602. At this point, the gas is compressed in a<br>
	chamber 1504 containing, in one embodiment, the fuel injector 114 and spark<br>
	plug 112, and in another embodiment, just the spark plug 112, and in still<br>
	another embodiment, without a spark plug 112 when the power cycle 1616 is<br>
	initiated with compressive ignition.<br>
20	[0066]		The power cycle 1616 begins, in various embodiments, near top-<br>
	dead-center 1602 and continues until the rotor 1002 rotates approximately 70o<br>
	from top-dead-center. At that point, the exhaust cycle 1518 begins. The<br>
	exhaust cycle 1618 continues until the rotor 1002 rotates approximately 140°<br>
	from top-dead-center. The exhaus cycle 1618 is completed when the exhaust<br>
25	port 502 is covered by the rotating member 1006 as the rotor 1002 rotates<br>
	from the position illustrated in Fig. 15F to the position illustrated in Fig, 15A.<br>
	The location of the exhaust ports 502 in relation to the inlet ports 504 are such<br>
	that the exhaust ports 502 are uncovered before the inlet ports 504 are<br>
	exposed. In this manner, the pressurized combustion gas can only flow out of<br>
30	the exhaust ports 502. As the rotor 1002 rotates, the inlet ports 504 are<br>
	exposed and the intake gas flows into the chamber. The inertia of the<br>
	combustion gas exiting the exhaust ports 502 helps draw the intake gas<br>
	through the inlet ports 504. The flow from the inlet ports 504 aids in<br><br>
	WO 2005/024200							PCT/US 2004/028797<br>
19<br>
	scavenging the combustion gas out the exhaust ports 502. Those skilled in the<br>
	art will recognize that the location of the exhaust and inlet ports 502, 504 can<br>
	vary, thereby changing the amount of rotation of the rotor 1002 for each<br>
	internal combustion cycle 1612, 1614, 1616, 1618 without departing from the<br>
5	spirit and scope of the present invention.<br>
	[0067]		The above discussion applies to a single side surface 1402. Figure<br>
	16 illustrates the four intenal combustion cycles 1612, 1614, 1616, 1618 for<br>
	each side surface 1402, 1402, I402 for a single rotating member 1006. The<br>
	rotating member has three side surfaces 1402, 1402', 1402" and each side<br>
10	surface 1402, 1402', 1402" experiences all four internal combustion cycles<br>
	1612, 1614, 1616, 1618 in sequence. During a portion of the time that a first<br>
	side surface 1402 is undergoing the intake cycle 1612, an adjacent second side<br>
	surface 1402' is undergoing the exhaust cycle 1618'. Because the two side<br>
	surfaces 1402, 1402' share connected fluid chambers 1508, 1504A,<br>
15	scavenging of the combustion gas draws intake air into the chamber 1508 while<br>
	the combustion gas is exhausted from chamber 1504A.<br>
	[0068]		After first side surface 1402 begins the power cycle 1616, the<br>
	adjacent second side surface 1402' completes its intake cycle 1612' and begins<br>
	a compression cycle 1614'. After the first side surface 1402 begins its exhaust<br>
20	cycle 1618, the adjacent third side surface 1402" begins its intake cycle 1612".<br>
	Each side surface 1402, 1402', 1402" sequentially undergoes an intake cycle<br>
	1612, 1612', 1612"; a compression cycle 1614, 1514', 1614"; a power cycle<br>
	1616, 1616', 1616"; and an exhaust cycle 1618, 1618', 1618". Because of the<br>
	relationship of the side surfaces 1402, 1402% 1402" to each other and to the<br>
25	rotor 1002 and housing 102, the intake cycles 16l2, 1612', 1612'and the<br>
	exhaust cycles 1618, 1618', 1618" overlap, thereby allowing scavenging to<br>
	occur.<br>
	[0069]		As can be seen in Figure 16, one side surface 1402 undergoes the<br>
	power cycle 1616 and the exhaust cycle 1618 while the adjacent side surface<br>
30	1402 undergoes the intake cycle 1612' and the compression cycle 1614', all<br>
	within a 120" rotation of the rotor 1002. If the power cycle 1616, 1616', 1616"<br>
	begins at top-dead-center of the rotor 1002, then the power cycle 1616 and the<br>
	exhaust cycle 1618 on one side surface 1402 and the intake cycle 1612' and<br><br>
	WO 2005/024200							PCT/US 2004/028797<br>
20<br>
	the compression cycle 1614 on the adjacent side surface 1402' occur as the<br>
	rotor 1002 travels from a first top-dead-center position 1602 to a second top-<br>
	dead-center position 1602'. In another embodiment, the power-cycle 1616,<br>
	1616', 1616" begins at a point other than top-dead-center, for example, when<br>
5	the spark is advanced or retarded.<br>
	[0070]		As the second side surface 1402' moves with rotor 1002 from one<br>
	top-dead-center position 1602, through a second top-dead-center position<br>
	1602, to a third top-dead-center position 1602", the second side surface 1402'<br>
	undergoes a portion of the in take cycle 1612', the compression cycle 1614', the<br>
10	power cycle 1616, and a portion of the exhaust cycle 1618'. That is, when the <br>
	rotor 1002 has an angular displacement equal to twice the displacement of the<br>
	adjacent top-dead-counter positions 1602, 1602', 1602", one side surface 1402<br>
	of the rotating member 1006 undergoes at least a portion of all four cycles<br>
	1612, 1614, 1616, 1618,<br>
15	[0071]		It bears noting that in the illustrated embodiment, fuel injectors<br>
	114 provide fuel to the compressed gas before combustion is initiated by the<br>
	spark plugs 112. Accordingly, scavenging of the combustion gas by air flow<br>
	from the inlet ports 504 does not involve any fuel. That is, air flowing into the<br>
	inlet ports 504 mixes with the combustion gas and exits the exhaust ports 502<br>
20	with the combustion gas as part of scavenging. Because the fuel has not yet<br>
	been injected at the time of scavenging, no fuel (other than that due to<br>
	incomplete combustion) exits through the exhaust ports 502. In another<br>
	embodiment, the inlet ports 504 receive an air-fuel mixture and a fuel injector<br>
	114 is not necessary.<br>
25	[0072]		The rotary engine 10 includes various functions. The function of<br>
	introducing fuel is implemented, in one embodiment, by the hid injectors 114.<br>
	In another embodiment, the function of introducing a fuel into the intake air is<br>
	implemented by the intake air passing through a carburetor that mixes fuel<br>
	with the intake air. The function of igniting the fuel is implemented, in one<br>
30	embodiment, by the spark plugs 112. In another embodiment, the function of<br>
	igniting the fuel is implemented by compresgive ignition when the rotating<br>
	member 1006 compresses the air-fuel mixture.<br><br>
	WO 2005/024200							PCT/US 2004/028797<br>
21<br>
	[0073]		The function of orbiting the rotating members 1006 about the<br>
	rotor 1002 while maintaining at least one tip 1106 of the rotating member<br>
	1006 in contact with the surface of the lobe 1112 is implemented, in one<br>
	embodiment, by the planetary gears 206, 307, 308. Those skilled in the art<br>
5	will recognize that other mechanisms can be used to orbit the rotating members<br>
	1006 about the rotor 1002 without departing from the scope or spirit of the<br>
	present invention.<br>
	[0074]		The function of sealing the tips 1406 of the rotating members<br>
	1006 is implemented, in one embodiment, by the pair of aide lips 1406 with a<br>
10	slit 1404, as illustrated in FIG. 14. The function of sealing the rotor 1002 is<br>
	implemented, in one embodiment, by the rotor 1002 having channels 1314 on<br>
	the front and back of the rotor 1002. Each channel 1314 receives a wave<br>
	spring member 1316 and a sealing member 1312. The function of sealing the<br>
	rotating members 1006 is implemented, in one embodiment, by each rotating<br>
15	member 1006 having channels 1416 on the front and back of the rotating<br>
	member 1006. Each channel 1416 receives a wave spring member 1414 and a<br>
	sealing member 1406. The function of sealing the peaks 1214 is implemented,<br>
	in one embodiment, by the seals 1114 formed by a slit protruding into the<br>
	trailing side of the peak 1214.<br>
20	[0075]		The function of drawing intake air is implemented, in one<br>
	embodiment, by the rotor 1002 and rotating members 1006 rotating in the<br>
	housing 102 such that the inlet ports 504 are exposed and intake air is drawn<br>
	into the housing 102. The intake air is drawn into the chamber 1508 through<br>
	the effects of scavenging. That is, as the combustion gas escapes through the<br>
25	exhaust ports 502, the inertia of the flowing combustion gas reduces the<br>
	pressure over the inlet ports 504, thereby drawing the intake air into the<br>
	chamber 1508. The intake cycle 1612 is described above with respect to FIG.<br>
	16.<br>
	[0076]		The function of compressing the air is implemented, in one<br>
30	embodiment, by the rotating member 1006 compressing the intake air against<br>
	the lobes 1112 of the housing 102. The compression cycle 1614 is described<br>
	above with respect to FIG, 16.<br><br>
	WO 2005/024200							PCT/US 2004/028797<br>
22<br>
	[0077]		The function of introducing a fuel into the intake air is<br>
	implemented, in one embodiment, by the fuel injectors 1l4 when the rotating<br>
	member 1006 has compressed the intake air. In another embodiment, the<br>
	function of introducing a fuel into the intake air is implemented by the intake<br>
5	air passing through a carburetor that mixes fuel with the intake air.<br>
	[0078]		The function of combusting the air and the fuel is implemented, in<br>
	one embodiment, by the spark plugs 112 igniting the air-fuel mixture. In<br>
	another embodiment combustion occurs then the air-fuel mixture is<br>
	compressed to the point where compressive ignition, occurs. The power cycle<br>
10	1616 is described above with respect to FIG. 16.<br>
	[0079]		The function of exhausting the combusted air and fuel is<br>
	implemented, in one embodiment, by the rotor 1002 and the rotating member<br>
	1006 rotating in the housing 102 such that the exhaust ports 502 are exposed<br>
	and the combustion gas is exhausted from the housing 102. The exhaust cycle<br>
15	1618 is described above with respect to FIG, 16.<br>
	[0080]		The function of obtaining rotary motion from the combustion is<br>
	implemented, in one embodiment, by the shaft 316 of the rotating member<br>
	1006 engaging the front support plate 202 and to the rear ring 602, which are<br>
	connected to the rotor 1002. Pressure from the combustion gas is applied to<br>
20	the side 1402 of the rotating member 1006 and this pressure is transferred to<br>
	the rotating member shaft 316, which transfers the force to the front support<br>
	plate 202 and to the rear ring 602, which causes the rotor 1002 to rotate.<br>
	[0081]		The function of scaling the rotary engine 10 is implemented, in<br>
	various embodiments, by the various seals. There is a seal 1114 between the<br>
25	rotor 1002 and the peak 1214. There is a seal 1312, 1316, 1314 between the<br>
	sides of the rotor 1002 and the back plate 106 and the front support plate 202.<br>
	There is a seal 1406, 1414, 1416 between the front and back of the rotating<br>
	member 1006 and the back plate 106 and the front support plate 202. There<br>
	is a seat 1404, 1406 at each tip 1106 of the rotating member 1006.<br>
30	[0082]		From the foregoing description, it will be recognized by those<br>
	skilled in the art that a rotary engine 10 has been provided. The illustrated<br>
	embodiment shows three rotating members 1006 interfacing with three lobes<br><br>
	WO 2005/024200							PCT/US 2004/028797<br>
23<br>
	1112 in the housing. In other embodiments, either or both, the number of<br>
	rotating members 1006 and the number of lobes 1112 varies.<br>
	[0083]		While the present invention has been illustrated by description of<br>
	several embodiments and while the illustrative embodiments have been<br>
