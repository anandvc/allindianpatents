				<td>The present invention relates to an improved lamellar clarifier.<br>
The document FR 2 754 733 discloses a lamellar clarifier of the type comprising:<br>
-	a) a tank for liquid to be clarified,<br>
-	b) means for conducting said liquid into a lower region of said tank,<br>
-	c) means for evacuating said liquid from an upper region of said tank,<br>
-	d) a plurality of clarifier plates mounted inside the tank, said plates being<br>
substantially  parallel  and  regularly spaced to  define  a  plurality of passages<br>
between said lower region and said upper region, and<br>
-	e)  means for calibrating the flow of said liquid between said passages and said<br>
upper region, said calibration means comprising :<br>
-	e1) first tubular members mounted inside said tank,<br>
-	e2) second tubular members disposed substantially in a quincunx arrangements<br>
relative to said first tubular members, and<br>
-	e3) means for varying the distance between said second tubular members and<br>
said first tubular members,<br>
-	Although   it  may   be   used  to  treat  most  liquids  charged  with   materials   in<br>
suspensions  relatively effectively,  a  clarifier of the  above  kind  has certain<br>
drawbacks.<br>
It will be noted in particular that the clarifier plates, on the one hand, and the first<br>
tubular members, on the other hand, must be mounted and demounted separately,<br>
which takes a long time and therefore adds to both fabrication and maintenance<br>
costs.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a clarifier that reduces the above<br>
drawbacks.<br>
That object of the invention is achieved with a lamellar clarifier of the type<br>
comprising:<br>
-	a)  a tank for liquid to be clarified,<br>
-	b)  means for conducting said liquid into a lower region of said tank,<br>
-	c)   means for evacuating said liquid from an upper region of said tank,<br>
-	d)  a plurality of clarifier plates mounted inside said tank, said plates being<br>
substantially parallel  and  regularly spaced to define  a  plurality of passages<br>
between said lower region and said upper region, and<br>
-	e)  means for calibrating the flow of said liquid between said passages and said<br>
upper region, said calibration means comprising:<br>
2<br><br>
e1) first tubular members mounted inside said tank,<br>
e2) second tubular members disposed substantially in a quincunx arrangement<br>
relative to said first tubular members, and<br>
e3) means for varying the distance between said second tubular members and<br>
said first tubular members, which clarifier is noteworthy in that said clarifier plates<br>
are fastened to said first tubular members.<br>
Each clarifier plate and the associated first tubular member from a one-piece assembly that can be mounted and demounted quickly, which considerably reduces fabrication and maintenance costs compared to the prior art.<br>
The present invention also provides a method of cleaning a ctarifier comprising step of lowering the level of the liquid in the tank to move the second tubular members away from the first tubular members in the direction of the bottom of the tank rendering accessibility of the clarifier plates from the top of the tank.<br>
Other features and advantages of the clarifier according to the invention will become apparent on reading the following description and examining the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
figure 1 is a perspective view of a first embodiment of the clarifier according to the<br>
invention,<br>
figure 2 is a partial view in section on the plane P in figure 1 of the clarifier in that<br>
figure when it is in an operating configuration,<br>
figure 3 is analogous to figure 2, when the clarifier is in a cleaning configuration,<br>
and<br>
figures 4 and 5 are respectively analogous to figures 2 and 3, for a second<br>
embodiment of the clarifier according to the invention.<br>
In these figures, the same reference numbers designate identical or analogous<br>
units or sets of units.<br>
Refer now to figure 1, in which it can be seen that a first embodiment of the clarifier 1 according to the invention comprises a tank 3 of liquid 5 to be clarified having, firstly, a liquid feed pipe 7 discharging into a lower region 9 of the tank 3 and, secondly, a liquid evacuation pipe 11 communicating with an upper region 13 of the tank 3, for example by way of a trough 15 for recovering the liquid 5.<br>
Inside the tank 3 is a plurality of clarifier plates Di, of which only the first clarifier plate D1 can be seen in figure 1.<br>
3<br><br>
The bars 17 are connected to each plate Di by a sliding pivot type link Li so that purely horizontal displacement of the bars (i.e. displacement thereof parallel to and at a constant distance from the bottom of the tank 3) varies the inclination of the plates Di, for example to change from an "operating" position depicted in figure 2, in which the plates Di are inclined to the vertical ZZ\ to a "cleaning" position depicted in figure 3, in which the plates Di are substantially parallel to that vertical.<br>
Refer now to figures 4 and 5, representing part of a second embodiment of the clarifier according to the invention.<br>
As is apparent in these figures, this embodiment differs from the previous one in that the second tubular members Tj are no longer suspended in a pendular manner from the walls of the tank 3 under the first tubular members Ti, and are instead suspended above the first tubular members in a rigid manner by means of a plurality of arms Bj connected to a manifold 19 above the first tubular members.<br>
The manifold 19 is mobile between an "operating" position depicted in figure 4, in which the second tubular members Tj bear in a substantially quincunx arrangement against the first tubular members Ti, and a "cleaning" position depicted in figure 5, in which the second tubular members Tj are moved away from the first tubular members Ti.<br>
As represented in figures 4 and 5, it is preferably inflatable membranes 21a, 21b disposed between the manifold 19 and the edges of the tank 3 that lower or raise the manifold into its operating and cleaning positions, respectively.<br>
The operation and the advantages of the clarifier according to the invention are described next.<br>
When the clarifier is operating, the path of the' liquid to be clarified is that indicated by the arrows in figures 1, 2 and 4.<br>
As can be seen in figure 1, the liquid 5 to be clarified first enters the lower region 9 of the tank 3 via the liquid feed pipe 7.<br>
Then, as can be seen in figures 2 and 4, the liquid 5 to be clarified rises in the passages  i, after which it infiltrates between the first tubular members Ti and the second tubular members ~j, thanks to the spaces maintained by the rings Cj.<br>
The liquid 5 to be clarified therefore reaches the upper region 13 of the tank 3, after which it is evacuated from the tank via the trough 15 and the pipe 11.<br>
As the liquid 5 flows upward along the plates Di, materials in suspension in the liquid are deposited on the plates Di, and most of these materials then slide toward the bottom of the tank 3.<br>
4<br><br>
However, a fraction of these materials remains stuck to the plates Di, forming a deposit known as sludge, making it necessary to halt the clarifying operation periodically and clean the plates Di.<br>
To this end, the bars 17 (see figure 2) may first be actuated to move the plates Di to a vertical position, as represented in figures 3 and 5.<br>
Once the plates Di are in the substantially vertical position, some of the sludge collected on the plates falls to the bottom of the tank 3 under its own weight.<br>
In the first embodiment (see figure 3), the level of the liquid 5 may then be lowered so that the second tubular members Tj, which float in the liquid, are moved away from the firs'i tubular members Ti in the direction of the bottom of the tank 3, the travel being limited by the fingers Aj, however.<br>
In the second embodiment (see figure 5), the membranes 21a, 21b may be inflated to raise the manifold 19 and thereby to move the second tubular members Tj away from the first tubular members Ti in the direction of the top of the tank 3.<br>
This frees up access to the plates Di from the top of the tank 3, so that a water jet may be used to detach the remaining sludge stuck to the plates.<br>
It will be noted that the step of lowering the level of the liquid 5 (first embodiment) or raising the second tubular members Tj (second embodiment) is optional, since the sludge stuck to the plates Di is not difficult to remove, so it may be sufficient to raise the plates to the vertical position to achieve the required cleaning effect.<br>
Conversely, to clean the plates directly with a water jet, it is also possible to lower the level of the liquid 5 (first embodiment) or raise the second tubular members Tj (second embodiment) without first modifying the incjination of the plates Di.<br>
Lumps of material known as floaters may become wedged in the passages  i during operation of the clarifter according to the invention.<br>
It is not necessary to halt operation of the clarifier to extract these floaters from the clarifier.<br>
This is because, in the first embodiment, it suffices to exert a downward pressure on the second tubular member Tj concerned to remove the wedged floater. Note that downward travel of the tubular member is allowed by its pendular articulation to the walls of the tank 3.<br>
In the second embodiment, it suffices to inflate the membranes 21a, 21b to raise the second tubular members Tj, to remove the wedged floater, and then immediately to deflate the membranes.<br>
S<br><br>
As will now be clear, calibration of the flow of liquid to be clarified at the outlet of the passages f|i defined by the clarifier plates Di may be achieved by simply moving the second tubular members Tj closer to the first tubular members Ti, the spacers Cj maintaining the spaces necessary for the liquid 5 to pass through.<br>
The second tubular members Tj being structurally separate from the first tubular members Ti the first and second members may be moved independently of each other for cleaning the clarifier, which does away with the heavy and costly actuation means of the prior art clarifier.<br>
Depending on the type of cleaning required, the inclination of the plates Di may be modified (and thus the first tubular members Di pivoted) and/or the second tubular members Tj may be moved vertically.<br>
Each clarifier plate Di and its associated first tubular member Ti from a one-piece assembly that can be mounted and demounted quickly, fabrication and maintenance costs may be considerably reduced compared to be prior art.<br>
It will be noted that, in both the embodiments described, the pendular articulation of the first tubular members Ti to the walls of the tank 3 reduces the friction that arises on pivoting of the plates of Di and thereby minimizes the weight of the structure for actuating the plates, namely the bars 17.<br>
This reduction of friction also makes it possible to use simple sliding pivot type links Li, thanks to which the bars 17 may be moved at a constant distance from the bottom of the tank 3.<br>
It will further be noted that rings Cj of greater or lesser thickness may be chosen, depending on whether the flow of liquid 5 between the passages | |i and the upper region 13 is required to be larger or smaller.<br>
It will also be noted that, in the first embodiment, the fingers Aj avoid the second tubular members Tj falling to the bottom of the tank 3 (into the sludge) when it is emptied.<br>
Of course, the present invention is not limited to the embodiments described and shown, which are provided by way of illustrative and non limiting example.<br>
For example, mounting the first tubular members Ti in a fixed manner to the interior of the tank 3 could be envisaged, in which case the clarifier plate Di would also be fixed.<br>
Thus a variant of the first embodiment could also be envisaged in which the lamellar clarifier would comprise actuation means such as rods adapted to come into<br>
6<br><br>
contact with the second tubular members and push them toward the bottom of the tank when it is required to clean the clarifier plates.<br>
In this variant, it would no longer be necessary to lower the level of the liquid in the tank to move the second tubular members toward the bottom of the tank.<br>
Thus a variant of the second embodiment could further be envisaged in which the second tubular members would be positioned under the first tubular members and connected to a manifold above the first tubular members, so that to move the second tubular members away from the first tubular members it would be necessary to lower the manifold.<br>
Thus the first and second tubular members having ncn-circular sections could also be envisaged.<br>
