 <br>
PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner<br>
in which it is to be performed.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to pneumatic tyres for automotive vehicles. The present invention more particularly relates to a testing apparatus and method for estimating strength of sidewall of a pneumatic tyre.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
In general, tyres can transmit power from a vehicle and its power plant to a ground-supporting surface. The tyres perform load carrying capacity, enveloping, cushioning, skid resistance, durability, transmission of braking forces, transmission of torque, torsional stability, flotation, mobility, cornering, abrasion resistance and low rolling resistance. In order to improve the tyre efficiency and durability, the strength of the pneumatic tyre should be tested during manufacturing. Such testing helps to estimate the strength of the tyres used for automobiles, in particular cars. The estimation of the tyre strength is generally conducted to find out the polymer construction strength of the pneumatic tyre. Such tests are performed on tread center of the tyre.<br>
During the test, the strength of the tyre is estimated by penetration of the plunger in normal direction to the tyre tread. Then, force is applied on the plunger and the penetration distance of the plunger is measured to derive the strength of the tyre. The applied force and the penetration of the plunger at break (or bottoming of the plunger against the rim) are measured at nearly five values equally spaced around circumference of the tyre. The arithmetic mean energy is absorbed and calculated from five energy values obtained at break using Equation (1).<br>
W =	*10 3		Equation(l)<br>
Where,<br>
W = Energy at break (or bottoming) in J (Joule); F = Force at break (or bottoming) in N; and P = Penetration at break (or bottoming) in mm.<br>
<br>
 <br>
Moreover, during the highway and rough road durability of the low cost tyres, it is observed that the sidewall region, which is of relatively low thickness, of the tyres tends to have failures such as extensive rubber wear, punctures and ply-cuts. Such failures can decrease the tyre lifespan even without the centre treads getting worn out. Even though the treads of the failure tyres are in good condition, the new tyres should be replaced due to these untimely side wall failures.<br>
With reference to the conventional methods, none of the prior arts can manage to overcome such sidewall failures in the vehicle tyre, because there is no test available to check and/or estimate the strength of the sidewall region of the tyre. In present scenario, the demand on higher production rate requires the industries to deliver robust product to save warranty cost and build goodwill for Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). Therefore, it is necessary to avoid such sidewall failures in the vehicle tyre. Hence, it is essential to provide a testing apparatus and method for estimating the strength of the sidewall of the pneumatic tyres.<br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a testing apparatus for estimating strength of sidewall of a pneumatic tyre, which facilitates accurate testing of the sidewall strength of the pneumatic tyre.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a testing apparatus for estimating strength of sidewall of a pneumatic tyre, which is simple in construction, cost effective and safe in operation.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a testing method for estimating strength of sidewall of a pneumatic tyre, which requires less time for testing various types of pneumatic tyres.<br>
<br>
 <br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
According to one aspect, the present invention, which achieves the objectives, relates to a testing apparatus for estimating strength of sidewall of a pneumatic tyre comprising a base plate arranged with a set of rails. A tyre mounting fixture is rigidly mounted on a base plate to slide on the rails of the base plate and is arranged with a gear box. A rotary shaft is connected to the gear box for providing rotary movement to a tyre assembly mounted on it. A load cell with a plunger is mounted on a movable slider. The plunger is penetrated into a sidewall section of the tyre assembly by sliding the movable slider on the rails of a vertical column, which facilitates accurate measurement of the sidewall strength of the pneumatic tyre in a simple and cost effective manner.<br>
According to another aspect, the present invention, which achieves the objectives, relates to a testing method for estimating strength of sidewall of a pneumatic tyre involving: conditioning an inflated tyre assembly at room temperature to adjust the tyre pressure to desired test inflation pressure. The inflated tyre assembly is mounted on top of a rotary shaft connected to a gear box. A plunger fitted to a load cell is penetrated into a sidewall section of the inflated tyre assembly. The force and penetration of the plunger is measured at break and ah energy value is calculated based on the measurement of the force and penetration of the plunger. The arithmetic mean energy absorbed is calculated from different energy values obtained from the measurement of the plunger at break.<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS<br>
The invention will be discussed in greater detail with reference to the accompanying Figures.<br>
FIG. 1 shows a perspective view depicting section details of a pneumatic tyre incorporating the present invention; and<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates a schematic view of a testing apparatus for estimating strength of sidewall of a pneumatic tyre, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
FIG. 1 shows a perspective view depicting section details of a pneumatic tyre incorporating the present invention. The pneumatic tyre includes a tread area, which exhibits a steel bead (a), filler (b), inner linear (c), nylon belt (d), treads rubber (e), steel belts (f), plies (g), and sidewall (h). The steel bead (a) may include a set of steel wires or cables, which fit around the rim flange of a wheel of a vehicle under tension. The filler (b) is arranged along with the steel bead (a) and the inner liner (c).<br>
<br>
 <br>
The radial body ply of the tyre can be wrapped circumferentially with the steel belts (f), which is covered by the nylon belt (d) and the plies (g).<br>
Furthermore, the treads rubber (e) contacting the road surface is formed outside of the steel belts (f). The treads rubber (e) can be connected to the steel bead (a) by a section of sidewall (h). The treads rubber (e) is disposed circumferentially around the radial body ply of the tyre. The sidewall extends from the treads rubber (e) to the beads (a), where a reinforcing layer is disposed between the carcass ply and the sidewall (h). The reinforcing layer is located beneath the rim flange of the wheel to provide additional stiffness to the sidewall (h) in the area, which avoids maximum deflection when the tire is inflated and the vehicle is loaded.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, a schematic view of a testing apparatus for estimating strength of sidewall of the pneumatic tyre is illustrated, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The testing apparatus comprises a load cell (2) with a plunger (3) mounted on a movable slider (1). The movable slider (1) can slide in ± Z direction on a vertical column (9) with rails, where the vertical column (9) is fixed on the ground with proper foundation. The sliding of the movable slider (1) on the vertical column (9) enables the plunger (3) to penetrate into a sidewall section (h) of an inflated tyre assembly (4), as shown in FIG. 1.<br>
Furthermore, the movement of the movable slider (1) in ± Z direction is achieved though a hydraulic cylinder connected to and/or controlled by a controller (not shown). The controller creates an interface between the operator and the rig for displaying the load and the displacement data, which is useful during operations and ensures safety. A base plate (8) is arranged with a set of rails. A tyre mounting fixture is rigidly mounted on a base plate (8) to slide on the rails of the base plate (8) in ± X direction. The tyre mounting fixture is arranged with a gear box (6), where the fixture includes a shaft (7) with a handle (10) fitted to the gear box (6). Moreover, the gear box (6) is arranged with a bevel gear arrangement (11) as shown in FIG. 2. The vertical bevel gear of the gear box (6) is connected to the shaft (7) of<br>
<br>
 <br>
the fixture and rotates when the handle (10) is rotated in the clockwise direction. The vertical bevel gear meshes with the horizontally placed bevel gear of the gear box (6), which provides the rotary movement to the tyre assembly (4) in Rz direction. The tyre assembly (4) is connected to a rotary shaft (5), which is connected to the gear box (6). This rotary movement is required to locate and adjust the points of penetration of the plunger (3) on the sidewall section (h) of the pneumatic tyre in order to facilitate mean and accurate measurement of the sidewall strength of the pneumatic tyre.<br>
Before testing the sidewall strength of the pneumatic tyre, the inflated tyre assembly (4) of the recommended size should be conditioned approximately at room temperature in which the test is to be conducted for at least 3 hours. After conditioning, the tyre pressure is adjusted, if necessary, to the specified test inflation pressure. The tyre mounting fixture is mounted on the base plate (8). Then, the gear box (6) is rigidly mounted and/or bolted to the base plate (8) to prevent any displacement, i.e. deflection or cantilever movement of the tyre, during penetration of the plunger (3).<br>
The inflated tyre assembly (4) is horizontally mounted on top of the rotary shaft (5) via bolts that are tightened to specified torque in order to set the inflated tyre assembly (4) in right position, which ensures no cantilever movement when the penetration of plunger (3) occurs. The plunger (3) is fitted to the load cell (2) for penetration on the sidewall (h) of the inflated tyre assembly (4) in the normal direction. The plunger (3) can be perpendicularly forced into the sidewall section (h) of the inflated tyre assembly (4), as described in FIG. 2. The rate of travel of the plunger (3) is maintained at constant value until the tyre breaks or unseating of the bead (a), as shown in FIG. 1, takes place.<br>
Thereafter, the tyre mounting fixture is rotated by the bevel gear arrangement (11) to locate and adjust the points of penetration of the plunger (3) on the sidewall section (h) of the inflated tyre assembly (4). Measurement of the force and penetration of the plunger (3) at break is done at four equally spaced points in the sidewall section (h)<br>
<br>
 <br>
of the tyre, so that the minimum strength of the plunger penetration is measured. In case of plunger penetration damages the sidewall (h) of the inflated tyre assembly (4), then the tyre assembly (4) is repaired and the measurement of next point of penetration is repeated. Finally, the arithmetic mean energy is absorbed by calculating the four energy values obtained from the measurement of the force and penetration of the plunger (3). Thus, it facilitates accurate testing of the sidewall strength of the pneumatic tyre in a simple and cost effective manner.<br>
The foregoing description is a specific embodiment of the present invention. It should be appreciated that this embodiment is described for purpose of illustration only, and that numerous alterations and modifications may be practiced by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. It is intended that all such modifications and alterations be included in. so far as they come within the scope of the invention as claimed or the equivalents thereof.<br>
