MAHINDRA &amp; MAHTNDRA LIMITED,<br>
Mahindra Towers,<br>
Wbrli,<br>
MUMBAI-400 018. Maharashtra Stale, India<br>
An Indian Company registered under the<br>
provisions of the Companies Act, 1956<br>
The following specification particularly desires the natiuire of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
ORIGINAL<br>
941/MUM/2002<br><br>
GRANTED<br>
29-4-2004<br><br>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for testing the decorative<br>
automotive components for their combined effects of chemicals and mechanical wiping and for the purpose of predicting the life of a decorative automotive component<br>
Following examples  illustrate the deterioration  of various  decorative automotive component.<br>
1. Automotiv vehicles are frequently washed with different solution such as<br>
detergents or soap and wiped with soft cloth. This action affects glazing of chrome plating on componentsp Such as name plates on  door handles and logos. this is the combined  effect of chemicals and mechanical wiping.<br>
2: when automotive vehicles are brought into garages for maintainance and<br>
repairs; some of the decorative components such as swiwith screen-<br>
printed or etched labels are smeared with oils/grease /brake<br>
fluids /thinner/diesel/petrol. As a result appearance of these<br>
components gets affected.<br>
3. Many  times components  (like knobs on combination switches, key heads and other  switches to operate power windows, hazard indicators) are operated  with hands smeared with oily eatables or soft drinks which are acidic or alkaline in nature This deteriorates the appearance of these components.<br>
In 'prior art, there exits no apparatus for such testing However testr processes in the form of standards are known for testing plastic material<br>
under the action of different chemicals.<br>
For examle the American standerd  ASTM 543-87 describes changes<br>
in properties like  weight and dimensions of polyproplylene or ABS plastic<br><br><br>
material strip when it is dipped in chemicals such Acetic acid, Ammonium Hydroxide, Aniline, Benzene, and Carbon  Tetrachloride:<br>
However the available Standerd does not described the combined effect of chemicals and mechanical wiping that happens in real life..<br>
Deficiencies of Prior  art: '<br>
No test procedure and apparatus is available forstudying the combined effect   of   chemical and mechanical wiping on decorative automotive components. <br>
The present invention aims to recently the deficiencies of the prior art by effect of chemicals and mechanical wiping on decorative  effect of chemicals and estimate the life of such decorative automative components before tart deteriorating in appearance.<br>
The Apparatus:<br>
The apparatus is described with  the help of  the figure 1,which  shows the front view of the apparatus. The apparatus for conducting the test consists of following main parts<br>
1	Base frarne<br>
2	Wiping rollers3	Containers<br>
4	Specimeih mounting plate<br>
The base frame consist of a mild steel rectangular plate (A) to which two vertical plates (B) are welded . The base frame is mounting on level bolts (M) to maintain the: level of the apparatus<br><br>
Wiping Rollers:<br>
Four wooden wiping rollers (D) are mbuhted oh a drive Shaft (C) supported between the vertical plates (B). The wiping rollers (D) are spaced away from each other by bushes (H). The distance between two rollers can be changed by using shorter or longer bushes, as required. A soft cotton cloth is wrapped around the wooden rollers. Sheet metal discs are provided on either side of each roller to avoid slipping of the cloth during wiping A D.C motor ( E ) mounted on one of the vertical plate (B). This drives the drive shaft (C) for rotating the wiping rollers. It is to be noted that the size of the specimen to be tested cannot be more than the length of the wiping roller. These wiping rollers may be replaced by wiping duster for linear movement.<br>
Containers:<br>
Four plastic: removable containers ?(F)are mounted oh the base plate (A) using bottom brackets (J). Chemicals are stored in  thesse removable containers.<br>
AD.C. motor  driven pumpp is provided to each container for pumping chemical on each roller through plastic tubes (L ) Plastic tubes are held in position by passing through a fabricated sheet metal channel. A wiping cloth on each rollers  is required to be kept tvet with the chemical. Flow of chemicals is controlled by changing the speed of the motor An electronic timer is provided to control the duration of chemical flow. The chemical falling down from' the roller during test is collected irf the contaner: The angle of the container is adjustable to facilitate collection  of chemical  falling down  from roller.<br>
Mounting of  the test specimen:<br>
Two mounting; plates (G) which are bolted to vertical plates (B) , are provided on either side of the wiping rolled (D). Provison is made so  that test specimen (N) is bolted to  the mounting plate. A Total Pf 8 specimens can be mounted on  these two plates'.<br><br>
Chemicals<br>
The chemicals which normally come in contact with automotive decorative components are:<br>
•	Detergent •   Soap<br>
•	Brake fluid<br>
•	Diessel<br>
•	Petrol<br>
•	Thinner<br>
•	Soft drink<br>
•	Edible oil<br>
•	Acetic acid<br><br>
•	Aniline<br>
•	Car1&gt;otiTetfacMoMdie ■   Benzene<br>
This is not an exhaustive list of chemicals. It is not intented to preclude the use of any other chemical pertinent to a particular requirements.<br>
Descriptiion of the process:<br>
1.     Duration : of test process<br>
Duration of test for a particular  specimen is to be worked out in the following manner<br>
A Logo  on a bonnet of an automobile may be wiped for 10 times a day, with each wiping lasting for2 (two) second .sl Hence in one year, the duration of wiping would be 7,300 seconds or 21.02 hours. The expected life of Logo of<br>
service vehicles is 10 years Therefore the duration of combined action of chemical and mechanical wiping is 2.02*10=20.2 hours . (say21 hrs)<br>
Thus the test duration of test for Logo  is decuded as 21 hours for combined effect of chemicals and mechanical wiping<br><br>
This  is the accelerated testing. Hence following stepsare necessary during the test prbeess:;<br>
a)	Mount  the specmien sucn that it comes in contact t with the wiping roller.<br>
b)	Inspect the  specimen   during test after every  l-hrs for its deterioration.<br><br>
2.	The face of the component is decided for combined effect of chemicalss and mechanical wiping.<br>
3.	The size of the cbmponent is decided oil the basis of the mounting arrangement on test rig The size has to be suitable for the wiping action on the rig Since the component is to be tested for various chemicals, there would  be a number of samples pf such component depending uponi the number of chemicals.<br><br>
4.	The test is carried out for the pre calculated life;<br>
5.	The test is repeated for different types of chemicals.<br>
6.	If the Sample component  does not pass the test, its design may be modified and the test process is repeated This process may be repeated till  the results obtained are satisfactory.<br>
Life Prediction<br>
Specemen with foiling or  chrome plating:<br>
If the specimen does not show any deterioration in appearance for 21 hours itmeans that the life of the decorative aspect of the  component is 10 years.<br>
If dot the other hand, the deteribratiPri'is"(observed at the end ofl(Say) 15 hrs then the life of tne component before it deteriorates in appearance is (15/21*10]) 7 yeatsr (approx)<br><br>
The specimen mounted on the test rig is evaluated for a particular chemical for combined effect of chemicals and mechanical wiping till the<br>
foil on the specimen vanishes This time to vanish can be converted back to actual years of use by the mrthod explained above. This will be the life of the component with the given foiling thickness and type of foil under the action of chemicals used .e g if the component runs for (say)40<br>
hrsafterwhich it vanishes this, means that the life  of this component (with<br>
 respect to its appearances)will be (40/20*10)=20 yeaers (approx) <br><br>
plastic component with screen printed or etched letters:<br>
Thespecimen is evaluated on the test rig for component effect of<br>
chemical and mechanical wiping till the test letter become unreadable.<br>
The duration of hrs of test bon test rig is converted to the useful life following<br>
the test process explained above.<br>
   the specimen may be tested for different chemicals and life predication<br>
may be done accordingly<br><br><br>

The above process is repeated for different chemicals<br>
* Acceptance  Criterion:<br>
♦	for bogi test  (conducted for specific duration ) the acceptable criterion is the<br>
deterioration in appearance of the specimen.<br>
♦ For the Ufe test, however, the criterion will be disappearance of Chrome plating or foiling or screen-printed letters as the case may be.<br>
EXAMPLES:<br>
Example 1:<br>
The test fig was used for testing of the foiled letter of the nameplate on<br>
door handle of the vehicle. The; plastic materials for  nameplate was ABS plastic.<br>
One type wasalumium foiled and the other was chrome plated. The<br>
thickness of foiling was 14 micron  The nameplate was tested for following<br>
chemicals:<br>
a) Detergent solution<br>
bj Diesel<br>
c) Brak fluid<br>
d) oil<br>
e) Thinner<br>
1.	The specimen  with aluminium foiling  as well as chrome plating  did not show any deterioration during testing with detergent solution diesel and oil This show  that the  appearance of these components will not deterorate in 10 years.<br>
2.	The specimen with aluminium foiling indicated deterioration during testing with Brake fluid. Black linings were observed on the specimen surface at the end of 20 hrs of test. This indicate  that the life df the alumiinium foil will he 10 year maximum beyond which it will not have acceptable appearance . However there was no such effect abserved on the chrome plated specimen during Brake fluid testing. This means that chrome plating will not suffer any deteroration in 10 years.<br>
3.	Aluminium foiling and chrome plating on the specimenh showed deterioration with thinner within 1 minute of testing. This shows that the<br><br><br>
appearance of thesecomponents will get deteriorated in 0.0079 years or 3 days<br>
Further tests showed that wheh the base material of the nameplate was changed from ABS to polyproplene the specimen with aluminium foiling did not show any deterioration during testing with any of above of the above chemicals for 21hrs.<br>
Esample2:<br>
The Logo- for the vehicle was also tested for the combined  effect of chemical  and mechanical  wiping for all the above chemicals and no deterioration waS observed after 21 hrs of test.<br>
These examples indicate the usefulness bf the apparatus and the test process for testing the decorative automotive components for combined effect of chemical and mechanical wiping.<br><br>
