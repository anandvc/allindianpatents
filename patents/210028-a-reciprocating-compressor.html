				<td>1 RECIPROCATING COMPRESSOR<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a reciprocating compressor that is capable of minimizing a vibration noise occurring in operation, accurately controlling the amount of a compressed gas to be discharged, simplifying assembly of a construction components, and minimizing the assembly tolerance..<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In general, a compressor is an instrument to compress a gas such as a coolant. There are several types of compressors including a rotary compressor, a reciprocating compressor, a scroll compressor.<br>
The general compressor includes a closed container having a space therein, an electronic mechanism unit installed inside the closed container and generating a driving force, and a compression mechanism unit for receiving the driving force from the electronic mechanism unit and compressing gas.<br>
Figure 1 is a sectional view of the rotary compressor in accordance with a conventional art.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, in the rotary compressor, as a rotor 2 of an electronic mechanism unit (M) installed in a closed container 1 is rotated, a rotational shaft 3 press-fit in the rotor 2 is rotated. According to the rotation of the rotational shaft 3, a rolling piston 5 inserted in an eccentric part 3a of the rotational shaft 3 positioned in the compression space (P) of a cylinder 4 linearly contacts the<br><br>
2<br>
inner circumferential surface of the compression space (P) of the cylinder and also linearly contacts a vane (not shown) inserted at one side of the cylinder 4 to divide the compression space (P) into a high pressure portion and a low pressure portion, so as to be rotated in the cylinder compression space (P) to compress a coolant gas sucked into a suction hole 4a formed at the cylinder 4 and discharge it through a discharge passage 4b. These processes are repeatedly performed. Figure 2 is a sectional view of a reciprocating compressor in accordance with a conventional art.<br>
As shown in Figure 2, in the reciprocating compressor, as a rotor 12 of an electronic mechanism unit (M) mounted in a cfosed container 11 is rotated, a crank shaft 13 press-fit to the rotor 12 is rotated. According to the rotation of the crank shaft 13, a piston 14 coupled to an eccentric part 13a of the crank shaft 13 makes a linear and reciprocal movement in the compression space (P) of the cylinder 15, to compress a coolant gas sucked through a valve assembly 16 coupled to the cylinder 15 and discharge the coolant gas through the valve assembly 16. These processes are repeatedly performed.<br>
Figure 3 is a sectionaf view of a scroll compressor in accordance with a conventional art.<br>
As shown in Figure 3, in the scroll compressor, as a rotor 22 of the electronic mechanism unit (M) mounted in the closed container 21 is rotated, a rotational shaft 23 having an eccentric part 23a press-fit to the rotor 22 is rotated. According to the rotation of the rotational shaft 23, an orbital scroll 24 connected to the eccentric part 23a of the rotational shaft 23 is engaged with a fixed scroll<br><br>
3 25 and revolved. Then, a plurality of compression pockets formed by wraps 24a and 25a having an invoiute curved line form respectively formed at the orbital scroll 24 and the fixed scroll 25 are reduced in size, to suck, compress and discharge a coolant gas continuously. This processes are repeatedly performed. The structural  and  reliability aspects of the  rotary compressor,  the reciprocating compressor and the scroll compressor of the conventional art each operated in a compression mechanism as described above will now be described.<br>
First, referring to the rotary compressor, in the structural aspect, since a plurality of balance weights 6 are used coupled to the rotor 2 to rotational balance between the rotational shaft 3 having the eccentric part 3a, the rolling piston 5 press-fit to the eccentric part 3a and the eccentric part 3a, there are many constructional components and its structure is somewhat complicated. In the aspect of a reliability, since the eccentric part 3a and the rolling piston 5 formed at the rotational shaft 3 are eccentrically rotated, a big vibration noise is generated.<br>
Referring to the reciprocating compressor, in its structural aspect, the balance weight 13b is used for a rotational balance between the crank shaft 13 having an eccentric part 13a, the piston 14 coupled to the crank shaft 13 and the crank shaft eccentric part 13a, resulting in that there are numerous components and its structure is complicated.<br>
In addition, in the aspect of a reliability, since the eccentric part 13a formed at the crank shaft 13 is eccentrically rotated, a vibration noise is generated, and since the valve assembly 16 is operated in sucking and discharging, the noise in<br><br>
4 sucking and discharging is made big.<br>
Referring to the scroll compressor, in the aspect of its structural aspect, the balance weight 26 is used for a rotational balance between the rotational shaft 23 having the eccentric part 23a, the orbital scroll 24 having a wrap formed in an involute curve form, the fixed scroll 25 and the eccentric part 23a, resulting in that there are many components and its structure is complicated. In addition, it is difficult to process the orbital scroll 24 and the fixed scroll 25.<br>
In addition, in the aspect of reliability, a vibration noise is generated due to the turning movement of the orbital scroll 24 and the eccentric movement in the eccentric part 23a of the rotational shaft.<br>
As stated above, in case of the rotary compressor, the reciprocating compressor and the scroll compressor, the compression mechanism unit compresses a gas upon receipt of a rotational force of the electronic mechanism unit. Thus, in order to control the amount of the compressed gas generated in the compressor, the number of rotations of the electronic mechanism unit should be reduced or the electronic mechanism unit should stop rotating, which makes it difficult to accurately control the amount of the compressed gas.<br>
In addition, since the eccentric parts 3a, 13a and 23a are provided at the shaft which is rotated upon receipt of the rotational force from the electronic mechanism unit, the balance weights 6, 13b and 26 are used, causing that a driving force is much consumed, and as the vibration noise is generated in operation, its reliability is degraded. In addition, since the structure is relatively complicate, the assembly productivity is degraded.<br><br>

The groove 311 of the cylinder is preferably formed to be positioned roughly at the middle portion of the overall length of the piston 320 when the piston 320 comes to the bottom dead point.<br>
At least one lubricant through hole 312 is provided within the groove 311 of the cylinder, having the smaller inner diameter than the width of the groove 311.<br>
It is preferred that the lubricant through hole 312 is formed both at the upper and the lower portions, so as to be positioned in the vertical line on the basis of the lubricant face.<br>
The middle support member 720 of the frame unit 700 includes a first step portion 722 formed at one side of the annular body 721 having a predetermined thickness and width and a second step portion 723 formed at the other side thereof.<br>

The middle support member 720 is insertedly coupled to the step portion<br><br>
12 212  of the outer stator of the  reciprocating  motor 200. At this time, the circumferential face h1 and the vertical face k1 (in the drawing) forming the first step portion 722 of the middle support member and a circumferential face d2 and a vertical face e2 forming the step portion 212 of the outer stator supportedly contact each other.<br>
The rear frame of the frame unit 700, formed in a cap form, includes a step portion 732 formed at one side and a through hole 732 formed at the other side thereof.<br>
The rear frame 730 is insertedly coupled to the second step portion 723 of the middle support member. At this time, a circumferential face m1 and a vertical face (in the drawing) forming the step portion 731 of the rear frame and a circumferential face h2 and a vertical face k2 forming the second step portion 723 supportedly contact each other, and the through hole 732 of the rear frame is positioned adjacent to the gas suction pipe 110.<br>

The piston 320 which makes a reciprocal movement linearly upon receipt of the driving force of the reciprocating motor 200 and the combining part to which the armature 230 of the reciprocating motor 200 is combined is preferably formed in a manner that the flange 322 of the piston, the plastic armature 230, that is, the magnet holder 231 made of plastic, and the spring base 610 supporting the resonance spring unit 600 are sequentially arranged to be engaged.<br>
That is, as they are engaged in the order of metal-plastic-metal, the armature made of plastic is prevented from deforming or damaging, helping maintain the rigidity of the engaging structure.<br>
Figure 5 is a partial sectional view showing a mass member of the reciprocating compressor in accordance with the first embodiment of the present<br><br>
14 invention.<br>
As shown in Figure 5, a mass member 900 is provided between the magnet holder 231 constructing the armature 230 of the reciprocating motor and the flange 322 of the piston 320 to which the magnet holder 231 is combined. The mass member 900 preferably has a disk form having a predetermined thickness. Thanks to the attachment of the mass member 900, the resonance frequency of the moving mass constructed by including the piston 320 which makes a reciprocal movement linearly together with the armature 230 of the reciprocating motor 200 upon receipt of the linear reciprocal movement of the armature 230 and the resonance spring unit 600 supporting the piston 320 can be accurately controlled.<br>
Accordingly, since the resonance frequency of the moving part of the reciprocating motor 200 can be roughly conformed to the frequency of the power source supplied to the reciprocating motor 200, the stroke of the reciprocating motor can be more accurately controlled.<br>
The suction unit 400 includes a gas flowing passage (F) formed inside the body part 321 of the piston 320 and a suction valve 410 coupled to the front end of the piston 320, for opening and closing the gas flowing passage (F) according to the pressure difference.<br>
The discharge unit 500 includes a discharge cover 510 combined to cover the cylinder 310, that is, the compression space (P), a discharge valve 520 positioned   inside  the  discharge  cover  510,   for  opening   and   closing   the compression space (P) of the cylinder 310, and a valve spring 530 for elastically<br><br>
15 supporting the discharge valve 520.<br>
The front frame 710 and the middle support member 720 supporting the both sides of the reciprocating motor 200 is engaged by a plurality of engaging bolts and nuts each having a predetermined length.<br>
Figure 6 is a schematic view showing a bolt engaging part of the reciprocating compressor in accordance with the first embodiment of the present invention.<br>
As shown in Figure 6, the bolt engaging portion 715 is extendedly protruded in a semi-circle form at the marginal portion of the body part 711 of the front frame, in which a screw hole is formed.<br>
The bolt engaging portions 715 are disposed at the upper and the lower sides on the basis of a horizontal line when the front frame 710 is vertically positioned, and the bolt engaging portions 715 are positioned at the left and the right sides on the basis of the central vertical line of the front frame 710.<br>
The bolt engaging portions of the middle support member 720, which is engaged along with the front frame 710 are disposed in the same form.<br>
A fillet portion (C) is formed at the corner portions of the front frame 710, the rear frame 730 and the middle support member 720 constructing the frame unit 700.<br>
The fillet portion (C) includes a relatively large portion and a relatively small portion to reduce the outer size of the compressor.<br>
The fillet (C) may be modified to a flat form chamfer.<br>
Since the front frame 710 constructing the frame unit 700 and the bolt<br><br>
16 engaging portion 715 engaging the middle support member 720 are positioned between the vertical line and the horizontal line rather than being positioned on the central vertical line and the horizontal line of the front frame 710 and the middle support member 720, and the fillet (C) is provided at the corner of the frame unit 700, the frame unit 700 is prevented from contacting the inner face of the container 100 and the distance to the inner face is minimized. Thus, its structure is compact.<br>
The support spring 800 includes a plurality of coil springs. One side of the support spring 800 is fixedly supported at the bottom of the container 100 and the other side thereof is fixedly supported by the frame unit 700.<br>
Figure 7 is a schematic view showing a support spring and a combining protrusion in accordance with the first embodiment of the present invention.<br>
As shown in Figure 7, in the structure in which the support spring 800 and the frame unit 700 are fixedly supported, a combining protrusion 910 is provided to be integrally formed at one side of the frame unit 700.<br>
A combing recess 911 is formed with a predetermined depth at a contact line where the outer circumference of the combining protrusion 910 and the frame unit 700 meet.<br>
The combining protrusion 910 is inserted to be fixedly combined into one side of the support spring 800.<br>
Figure 8 is a schematic view showing a power supply terminal and a fixing terminal of a first connector and a second connector in accordance with the first embodiment of the present invention, and Figure 9 is a front view showing the<br><br>
17 second connector in accordance with the first embodiment of the present invention.<br>

A second connector 920 is provided having two power supply terminal 921 connected to the power supply terminal 121 of the first connector 120 and withdrawn from the reciprocating motor 200 to supply a power to the reciprocating motor 200 and a fixing terminal 922 insertedly combined with the fixing terminal 122 of the first connector.<br>
When the first connector 120 and the second connector 920 are combined with each other, the power supply terminal 121 of the first connector 120 and the power supply terminal 921 of the second connector 920 are combined, and at the same time, the fixing terminal 122 of the first connector 120 and the fixing terminal 922 of the second connector 920 are insertedly combined with each other.<br>
As the power supply terminal 121 of the first connector and the power supply terminal 921 of the second connector 920 are connected to each other, an external power is supplied to the reciprocating motor 200, and as the fixing terminal 122 of the first connector 120 and the fixing terminal 922 of the second connector 920 are combined to each other, the first and the second connectors 120 and 920 are firmly combined and maintained.<br>
The operational effect of the reciprocating compressor constructed as described above will now be explained.<br><br>
18 When a power is supplied to the reciprocating motor 200, a current flows to the winding coil 240 which constructs the reciprocating motor 200, and accordingly, a flux is generated at the outer stator 210 and the inner stator 220. The interaction of the flux generated at the outer stator 210 and the inner stator 220 and the flux according to the permanent magnet 232 of the armature 230 renders the armature 230 to undergo a linear reciprocating movement.<br>
The linear and reciprocal driving force of the armature 230 is transmitted to the piston 320, and then, the piston 320 is linearly and reciprocally moved in the compression space (P) of the cylinder.<br>
At this time, the resonance spring unit 600 stores the linear and reciprocal movement force of the reciprocating motor 200 as an elastic energy and discharges it and induces a resonance movement.<br>
Due to the pressure difference caused when the piston 320 is linearly and reciprocally moved in the compression space (P) of the cylinder 310, the gas sucked into the gas suction pipe 110 is sucked into the compression space (P) of the cylinder of the compression unit 300 through the suction unit 400, compressed therein and discharged through the discharge unit 500.<br>
The high temperature and high pressure gas discharged through the discharge unit 500 is discharged through the discharge pipe 111 to outside the container 100.<br>
In the reciprocating compressor of the first embodiment of the present invention, since the piston 320 is linearly and reciprocally moved in the cylinder 310 upon receipt of the linear and reciprocal driving force of the reciprocating<br><br>
19 motor 200, to compress the gas, its driving is stably made.<br>
In addition, since the stroke of the piston 320 can be controlled by controlling the linear movement distance of the reciprocating motor 200, the amount of the compressed gas to be discharged can be accurately controlled.<br>
The step  portion 211   of the outer stator 210 which constructs the reciprocating motor 200 supportedly contacts to be combined with the first step portion 713 of the front frame 710 which constructs the frame unit 700, and the step portion 221 of the inner stator 220 of the reciprocating motor supportedly contacts to be combined with the second step portion 714 of the front frame 710, so that the concentricity of the outer stator 210 and the inner stator 220 can be accurately adjusted and the interval therebetween can be constantly maintained. In addition, the first step portion 722 of the middle support member 720 of the frame unit 700 supportedly contacts to be combined with the other step portion 212 of the outer stator 210 of the reciprocating motor, so that the assembly firmness can be increased.<br>
Moreover, since the front frame 710 of the frame unit 700 supports both the outer stator 210 and the inner stator 220 of the reciprocating motor 200 and the middle support member 720 supports only the outer stator 210, a leakage of flux formed at the outer stator 210 and the inner stator 220 can be reduced.<br>

29 bolt engaging portion 775 is extendedly protruded in a semi-circle form at the marginal portion of the body part 717 of the rear frame, in which a screw hole is formed.<br>
The plurality of bolt engaging portions 775 are disposed at the upper and the lower sides on the basis of a horizontal line when the rear frame 770 is vertically positioned, and the bolt engaging portions 775 are positioned at the left and the right sides on the basis of the central vertical line of the rear frame 770, that is, specifically, of the body part 771 of the rear frame 700.<br>

The operation mechanism of the reciprocating compressor in accordance with the second embodiment is similar to that of the first embodiment.<br>
In the reciprocating compressor of the second embodiment of the present invention, since the piston 320 is linearly and reciprocally moved in the cylinder 310 upon receipt of the linear and reciprocal driving force of the reciprocating motor 200, to compress the gas, the reciprocating compressor is stably driven. In addition, since the stroke of the piston 320 can be controlled by controlling the linear movement distance of the reciprocating motor 200, the amount of the compressed gas to be discharged can be accurately controlled.<br><br>
31 The step portion 211   of the outer stator 210 which  constructs the reciprocating motor 200 supportedly contacts to be combined with the first step portion 773 of the rear frame 770 which constructs the frame unit 700, and the step portion 221 of the inner stator 220 of the reciprocating motor 200 supportedly contacts to be combined with the second step portion 774 of the front frame 770, so that the concentricity of the outer stator 210 and the inner stator 220 can be accurately adjusted and the interval therebetween can be constantly maintained. In addition, the first step portion 762 of the middle support member 760 of the frame unit 700 supportedly contacts to be combined with the other step portion 212 of the outer stator 210 of the reciprocating motor, so that the assembly state is firm.<br>
The components constructing the frame unit 700, the reciprocating motor 200 and the compression unit 300 are combined by being contacted and supported by the step portions forming the concentric circle, so that the assembly tolerance is minimized and the assembly working is easy.<br>
Moreover, since the rear frame 770 of the frame unit 700 supports both the outer stator 210 and the inner stator 220 of the reciprocating motor 200 and the middle support member 760 supports only the outer stator 210, a leakage of flux formed at the outer stator 210 and the inner stator 220 can be reduced.<br>
As so far described, the reciprocating compressor of the present invention has many advantages.<br>
For example, first, since the stable driving is made in its operating, generation of a vibration and a noise can be minimized, heightening a reliability.<br><br>
32<br>
Secondly, since the gas discharge amount according to the stroke control can be accurately controlled, an unnecessary loss can be reduced.<br>
Thirdly, the assembly tolerance of the components can be minimized, the assembly working is easy, and thus, the compression performance is heightened and assembly productivity can be improved.<br>
It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the plasma polymerization on the surface of the material of the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.<br><br>
