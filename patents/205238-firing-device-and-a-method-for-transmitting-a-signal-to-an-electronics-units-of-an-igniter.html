PE1LLCE-FOR THE   INDUgPSey-eF- A -MAGNE^iC  EIELB--SSf~IHB MUZZ-BB-ftEQi0N--OE~A.^I JONG-BSVJ GB<br>
i i<br>
The invention relates to a device for generating a magnetic field in the muzzle region of a firing device corresponding to the preamble of the first claim.<br>
Electrical power can be generated with the aid of induction in an induction device, for example in a coil system, upon the firing of missiles, which can be, in particular, bullets, but also for example, rockets. This electrical power is used to supply power to electrically triggered igniters, but can also be used to supply control circuits so that, during the flight phase or when the target is reached, certain operations, such as safety-release procedures or ejection procedures, can be carried out.<br>
It is already known from US-PS 1,739,921 to arrange a coil at the muzzle of a gun barrel, the coil being arranged concentrically about the firing aperture of the gun barrel and being capable of having different voltages applied thereto.  This coil acts as a primary coil like a transformer on the secondary coil arranged<br>
in the bullet, in which secondary coil a voltage is<br>
i<br>
induced during passage through the magnetic field of the primary coil, which voltage is used for the control of the igniter with respect to time.  With this type of voltage generation in the ignition system, it is a disadvantage that a source of electrical power has to; be provided for supplying the magnetic coil in the muzzle region of the firing device.  The magnetic coil and its terminals are in danger of corroding due to the .firing gases which issue, and contact problems at the terminals can arise due to the vibrations.<br>
Known from DE-OS 27 06 168 is a device for generating an electrical igniting current in the igniter of a bullet.  The shell contains a permanent<br><br>
magnet is arranged in the muzzle region of the firing device to generate the magnetic field.Advantageous developments of the invention will be claimed in the subclaims.<br>
As a result of the invention, it is no longer necessary to provide electrical power in order to generate a magnetic field for the induction of a voltage in an induction device of a missile for the supply of electrically triggered primers and optionally of control circuits, and to provide a sensitive electrical installation in the muzzle region of a firing device.  The at least one permanent magnet in accordance with the invention does not require any power supply and can be embedded, protected against the aggressive discharge gases, in a housing consisting of a suitable material.<br>
The arrangement of the at least one permanent magnet is advantageously annular around the firing duct.  In this way a uniform assembly of the magnetic field and a uniform induction effect in the firing duct are achieved.<br>
So that the magnetic fields of the permanent<br>
magnets are neither influenced disadvantageously from<br>
the outside nor among themselves, it is an advantage to<br>
embed the permanent magnets in a non-magnetizable<br>
material.  These materials can be, for example, heat-<br>
resistant resins or plastics as well as non-<br>
magnetizable metals.  In this respect, as already<br>
explained, a complete encasing of the permanent magnets<br>
can be provided so that they are protected against any<br>
effects from the firing device.<br>
M	The magnetic field strength generated by the<br>
permanent magnet or magnets must be coordinated with the need for electrical power by the igniter or by a control circuit of the missile, a bullet or a rocket. It can therefore be advantageous if several permanent<br><br>
magnets are arranged one behind the other when seen in the firing direction.  The voltage induced in the induction device can be increased by means of multiple inductions in a coil.<br>
In order to induce a voltage at a certain level in a purposeful manner, it can be advantageous if several permanent magnets with different magnetic field strengths are combined.  The desired sequence.of different field strengths can be achieved with a corresponding arrangement of the permanent magnets.<br>
Moreover, the sequence of different field strengths, by means of which a succession of voltages each of a variable level is induced, and the level of the induced voltages in each case can be used in order to transmit a signal to an igniter or a control circuit, with the induction sequence being capable of being used as a code in order to undertake, for example, an adjustment of the ignition instant or of flight duration or of flight direction if'corresponding electronics are present in the bullet or the rocket. The sequence of inductions at different time<br>
intervals can likewise be used as a signal.  Such a !<br>
i<br>
signal sequence can be advantageously achieved if the magnets are arranged at specified distances from each<br>
other, with it being possible for these distances to be<br>
i<br>
of different lengths.<br>
The arrangement of the permanent magriets at specified distances is advantageous if the magnets are arranged in such a way that, as far as possible, the magnetic fields do not influence each other negatively. With permanent magnets with magnetic fields of variable field strength the distances can be selected to coordinate with the magnetic fields.<br>
A further possibility for transmitting signals to the igniter of a bullet or to the control circuit of a rocket consists in that permanent magnets with<br><br>
of view of the variable sequence of the inductions.  In this way an even greater number of codings is possible in order to be able, for example, to undertake a defined adjustment of the instant of ignition or of control circuits.  With the aid of the plurality of inductions, the temporal intervals and the variable level of the induction voltages, corresponding to the nanysd requirements, three different items of , information can be transmitted to the electronics of an igniter or to a control circuit, for example a guide system, of a missile, if they are appropriately set up.<br>
The invention will be explained in more detail with reference to examples of preferred embodiments. Figure 1  shows the arrangement of a permanent magnet<br>
in the muzzle region of a firing device. Figure 2 shows the arrangement of three permanent magnets in the muzzle region of a firing device, the magnets being arranged one behind the other when seen in the firing direction. Figure 3  shows the arrangement of three permanent<br>
magnets with different field strengths, which are arranged one behind the other at<br>
different distances.<br>
i<br>
Figure 1 shows a weapon barrel 1 of a! firing device.  Only the features which contribute to the understanding of the invention are shown and described. The device for generating a magnetic field is arranged in the muzzle region 2 of the firing device 1, the magnetic field generating device being denoted as a whole as 3.  The device 3 comprises a housing 4 which contains the permanent magnet 5.<br>
In the present exemplifying embodiment, the permanent magnet 5 is surrounded completely by a non-magnetizable material 4, for example a heat-resistant plastics material, which at the same time forms the housing for the magnet and in this way protects it from<br><br>
in the muzzle region 2 of the firing device 1, the '<br>
magnetic field generating device being denoted as a<br>
i<br>
whole as 3.  The device 3 comprises a housing 4 which<br>
i<br>
contains the permanent magnet 5.        !<br>
In the present exemplifying embodiment, the<br>
i<br>
permanent magnet 5 is surrounded completely by a non-magnetizable material 4, for example a heat-resistant plastics material, which at the same time: forms the housing for the magnet and in this way protects it from the issuing gases.<br>
The connection between the housing 4 and the firing barrel 1 takes place by way of a screw coupling 6.  The housing 4 is screwed on to the muzzle 2 of the weapon barrel 1.  A bullet 7 is just leaving the muzzle region 2 of the weapon barrel 1.  The weapon barrel 1, the device 3 for generating the magnetic field 9 and the bullet 7 are shown in section.<br>
In the present exemplifying embodiment, the permanent magnet 5 surrounds the firing channel 8 in an annular manner.  The magnetic field 9 which it generates has a specified magnetic field strength.  The bullet 7 moves through the firing duct 8, in the firing direction 10 and through the device 3 in accordance with the invention, which device has the permanent magnet 5.  In the course of this, the induction device 11 of the igniter Z of the bullet 7, in the present exemplifying embodiment an annular coil 11, moves through the magnetic field 9.  As a result of the change of the magnetic flux, a voltage is induced in the induction coil 11, with the voltage being determined by the specified magnetic field 9 and by the movement of the bullet 7.  The induced voltage is supplied by way of the conductors 12 of the electronics 13 of the bullet 7 and stored there in suitable form, for example in a capacitor 14, and kept ready for the ignition of the initiating explosive 25.  Furthermore,<br><br>
the induced voltage may be used in order t;o<br>
predetermine the ignition instant with th4 aid of<br>
electronics, not shown here in more detail.  The use of<br>
l the induced voltage is not the subject matter of the<br>
present invention and is already adequately known from<br>
the prior art cited.<br>
The exemplifying embodiment of Figure 2 shows a filing device 1, a weapon barrel, in the muzzle region 2 of which the device 31 for generating a magnetic field contains three permanent magnets 51, 52 and 53. These permanent magnets 51, 52 and 53 are arranged one behind the other when seen in the firing direction 10. The magnetic field strengths of the three magnets can be of the same magnitude but can also be of different magnitudes.<br>
If the bullet 7, seen in the firing direction 10, moves successively through the individual magnetic<br>
fields 91, 92 and 93, voltages are induced in turn<br>
i<br>
three times in the induction device 11 of the bullet 7, the voltage corresponding to the magnetic field strength at the time.  The total voltage available can be increased by appropriate switching of the coils.<br>
In the present exemplifying embodiment, the electronics 13 of the bullet 7 additionally contain a counting circuit 15 with which it is possible to count the number of inductions, that is to say the number of permanent magnets 91 to 93 passed through.  The counting circuit 15 can be used in order to make information available with the aid of the number of inductions of the electronics 13 of the bullet 7.  The information can be used, for example, to specify the1 *  ignition instant of the bullet.  In the present exemplifying embodiment, the housings 41, 42 and 43 of the permanent magnets 51 or 52 and 53 are connected to each other by means of screw threads 16.  The housings 41, 42 and 43 are formed in such a way that the<br><br>
distance 17 between the permanent magnet 51 and the<br>
i<br>
permanent magnet 52 and the distance 18 between the permanent magnet 52 and the permanent magnet 53 are respectively of the same size.<br>
The exemplifying embodiment according to Figure 3 shows, as device 32 for generating a magnetic field, likewise three permanent magnets which are arranged concentrically about the firing channel 8.  Viewed in the firing direction 10, two further permanent magnets 522 and 533 are connected to the permanent magnet 511. These permanent magnets have respectively magnetic fields 922 and 933, the respective magnetic field strength of which differs from the magnetic field 911 of the permanent magnet 511.  The magnetic field strengths of the magnetic fields 922 and 933 likewise differ.  Moreover, the distance 19 between the permanent magnet 511 and the permanent magnet 522 is greater than the distance 20 between the permanent magnet 522 and the permanent magnet 533.<br>
The electronics 13 of the bullet 7 contain a store 14 for the electrical power and a counting circuit 15 for the number of inductions which have taken place upon the passage of the bullet 7 through the magnetic fields 911, 922 and 933.  A voltage of variable level is induced, in each case, the passage through the individual magnetic fields with the level depending on the respective magnetic field strength of the field and being determined by an electronic circuit 24. Moreover, the inductions take place at incrementally different time intervals which depend on the distances 19 and 20 between the individual permanent magnets 511, 522 and 533.  For this reason the electronic circuit 13 of the bullet 7 additionally contains a circuit 21 by means of which the temporal intervals which lie between the individual inductions, that is to say between the individual passages of the induction device 11 through<br><br>
the successive magnetic fields 911, 922 and 933, are determined.<br>
The variable, intensity of the magnetic field strengths and therefore the different levels of the induced voltages and the temporally different intervals<br>
between the inductions can be used for the transmission<br>
i<br>
of information to the electronics 13 of the bullet 7. Compared with the preceding exemplifying embodiment,<br>
the possibilities of information transmission are<br>
i<br>
substantially increased due to the variable intensity of the magnetic fields and the variable distance between them.  In this way, different functions in the igniter Z, corresponding to the number of possible codings, can be activated.<br>
The housings 411 and 4'22 are connected to each other by way of screw threads 16.  In the present exemplifying embodiment, due to the' short; distances<br>
i<br>
between the two permanent magnets 522 and 533, the housings 422 and 433 each have an respective external<br>
thread 23 and are connected to each other by way of a<br>
i<br>
bushing 22.  Due to the screw connections the permanent magnets can be easily exchanged for each other and for other permanent magnets.  Due to different distances and the combination of permanent magnets With different<br>
magnetic field strengths, it is possible in this way,<br>
i<br>
to induce a respective voltage at a certain level in the induction device 11 of the bullet 7 and to vary the temporal intervals of the inductions.  In this way it is possible to transmit different items of information to the electronics 13 of the bullet 7.<br><br><br><br>
