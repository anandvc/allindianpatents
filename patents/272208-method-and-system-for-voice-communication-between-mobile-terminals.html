(2): The mobile terminal instant messaging server 2051 finds, according to the instant messaging number of the called user, that the called user is a log-on user of a mobile terminal and is now online, and returns a quer&gt;' result to the instant messaging user of the first mobile terminal 201. Based on user information privacy, the mobile terminal instant messaging server 2051 will not return the mobile terminal number registered by the 6alled inst»rMnessaging user to the instant messaging user of the calling mobile terminal (i.e., the calling user and the instant messaging user of the first mobile terminal 201).<br>
(3): If the called instant messaging user (that is, the instant messaging user corresponding to the second mobile terminal 203) is online, the instant messaging software in the first mobile terminal 201 calls the called instant messaging number by dialing the number. A call request is sent through a network such as a GSM network etc., and the dial-up information carries the called instant messaging number (i.e., the instant messaging number corresponding to the second mobile terminal 203) in a format such as an access number plus an instant messaging number.<br>
(4): After receiving the'^lfH request, the mobile communication gateway 202 converts the call request into a VoIP call request and sends the VoIP call request to the VoIP server 204.<br>
(5): The VoIP server 204 converts the VoIP call request to a caller ID message, and sends it to a computer instant messaging server 2052.<br>
(6): The computer instant messaging server 2052 checks whether the called instant messaging user is a mobile terminal instant messaging user or a computer instant messaging log-on user. Here, when it is determined that the called user is a mobile terminal instant messaging user, the computer instant messaging server 2052 queries the mobile terminal instant messaging server 2051 whether the user is online based on<br>
 <br>
the instant messaging number of the called user, and the mobile terminal instant messaging server 2051 returujvjjje online status of the called mobile terminal user as well as the mobile terminal number registered by the called mobile terminal user (i.e., the called instant messaging user or the instant messaging user corresponding to the second mobile terminal 203).<br>
(7): The computer instant messaging server 2052 returns back to the VoIP server 204 the mobile terminal number registered by the called user.<br>
(8): The VoIP server 204 sends a call request to the mobile communication gateway 202, wherein the called number is the mobile communication number bound with the called instant messaging user.<br>
(9): The mobile communication gateway 202 sends the call request to the second mobile terminal 203 through a network such as a GSM network etc.<br>
(10): After the user of the second mobile terminal 203 (i.e., the called user, the called instant messaging user, the called mobile terminal user, or the instant messaging user corresponding to the second mobile terminal 203) picks up the phone, a voice channel is successfully established and the call is started.<br>
To sum up, in the embodiments of the present invention, the first mobile terminal sends a dial-up request to the mobile communication gateway, wherein the dial-up request includes the instant messaging number of the second mobile tenninal. The mobile communication gateway converts the dial-up request to a VoIP signaling, and sends the signalling to the VoIP server. The VoIP server obtains the mobile communication number of the second mobile terminal from the instant messaging server according to the instant messaging number of the second mobile terminal, and sends a call request to the second mobile terminal via the mobile communication gateway. After that, the second mobile terminal responds to the call request, and has voice communication with the first mobile terminal. It can be seen that by applying the embodiments of the present invention, instant messaging users of mobile terminals can hide their own mobile terminal numbers during a voice chat with one another, so as to protect the users' personal privacy.<br>
 <br>
