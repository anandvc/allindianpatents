APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR MONITORING STRAIN AND/OR<br>
LOAD APPLIED TO A MAMMAL<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to apparatus and a method for monitoring strain and/or load applied to the body of a vertebral mammal. The present invention is particularly suitable for monitoring strain and/or load applied to the back of the mammal including the lumbar spine and it will be described herein in this context. Nevertheless, it is to be understood that the present invention is not thereby limited to such applications. In this document use of the words strain and/or load in relation to the body of a mammal includes a reference to movements, muscle forces and loads including gravitational loads acting on the body of the mammal.<br>
Preventing back injuries presents a major workplace safety challenge. According to the Bureau of Labour Statistics in the United States, more than one million workers suffer back injuries each year. Back injuries account for one in every five workplace injuries or illnesses. Moreover, one-quarter of compensation indemnity claims involve back injuries, costing industry billions of dollars on top of the pain and suffering borne by employees.<br>
A documented cause of compensable workplace injuries is due to manual handling tasks such as lifting, placing, carrying, holding and lowering of materials. Statistics show that four out of five injuries are to the lower back and three out of four of such injuries occurred while an employee was lifting. One difficulty in preventing and/or treating lower back injury is due to a lack of facility to objectively measure movements and stresses placed on the lower back over time and therefore the risks that are associated with use of the lower back when undertaking a task or activity that presents a risk of injury.<br>
The present invention may provide a mechanism for avoiding or at the very least minimizing incidence of back injuries and/or may assist rehabilitation of existing injuries by monitoring movements, associated muscle activities and loads experienced by the lumbar spine.<br><br>
Because preventing a back injury is far preferable to repairing the injury, the present invention may monitor toads placed on a person's back while that person is undertaking a task or activity and may assess whether that load presents a risk of injury. The monitoring may be performed in real time to provide useful feedback to the person so that the person may modify a task or activity being undertaken in a manner that may reduce the load. This may lead to a reduction of the load and a consequent reduction in risk or occurrence of an injury.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided apparatus for monitoring strain and/or load applied to the body of a vertebral mammal, said apparatus including:<br>
means for measuring position of said body relative to an inertial frame of reference and for providing first data indicative of said position, wherein said means for measuring includes at least one inertial sensor;<br>
means for measuring muscle activity and for providing second data indicative of said muscle activity;<br>
means for storing said data at least temporarily; and<br>
means for processing said data to provide a measure of strain and/or load to said body.<br>
According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of monitoring strain and/or load applied to the body of a vertebral mammal, said method including:<br>
measuring position of said body relative to an inertial frame of reference and providing first data indicative of said position, wherein said step of measuring is performed by at least one inertial sensor;<br>
measuring muscle activity and providing second data indicative of said muscle activity;<br>
storing said data at least temporarily; and<br>
processing said data to provide a measure of strain and/or load to said body.<br><br>
Throughout the description and claims an inertial frame of reference denotes a frame of reference in which Newton's laws of motion apply. When no force is being exerted on an object then the object will move inertially. A frame of reference that moves with such an object is an inertial frame of reference. An inertial sensor denotes a sensor that responds to inertial forces such as forces that relate to acceleration of a system or that give rise to a change in velocity.<br>
The means for measuring position may include at least one transducer for measuring displacement. Each transducer preferably includes an accelerometer. The or each accelerometer may include means for measuring acceleration simultaneously along one, two or three orthogonal axes. Displacement data may be derived from the or each accelerometer by a process of integration as is well known in the art. Alternatively or additionally data may be derived from one or more accelerometers to provide angular displacement or position relative to a reference such as a direction defined by gravity.<br>
Each accelerometer may detect a change in acceleration of a small mass mounted within a micro chip on a PCB board. As the PCB board, and the accelerometer move from one position to another, the mass experiences an acceleration at the start of the movement as well as a deceleration as the movement ceases. The accelerometer may convert movement of the mass into a voltage signal (typically in mV) that represents data in its most raw form. Span and offset adjustments may convert the voltage signal to a G force value, by way of calibration constants. A first calibration constant (p) is known as a 'multiplier' or 'gain' constant and may be derived by means of simultaneous equations wherein signal values equate to G force values. A second calibration constant (o) is known as an offset constant. Once calculated, the calibration constants (p) and (o) may be programmed into software and may become a oermanent fixture of the programming. There may be two calibration constants :or each channel and three channels per sensor.<br><br>
Angular displacement of the accelerometer may be calculated by multiplying the raw signal value by the gain constant (p) and adding the offset constant (o). The resulting value may represent the G force acting on one axis. For a resultant G force in three dimensions, three axes trigonometry may be used, wherein x is the horizontal axis, y is the vertical axis and z is the 'through page' axis. Using 3D Pythagoras and an inverse tangent formula, two angles may be derived to give a position for the accelerometer. One accelerometer in isolation may only give a direction of movement, but when there are two accelerometers, the difference between angles of the two accelerometers may represent a change in position (in degrees) of one accelerometer compared to the other accelerometer. This may allow the apparatus to calculate angular position of the lumbar spine, at any moment in time, within a three dimensional axis.<br>
The following expressions may be used to derive angular changes from accelerometers.<br><br><br>
Note: values for p and o should be calculated for each axis.<br><br>
The above 3 equations show for the 3 axes the span and offset adjustment which converts millivolts to g.<br>
The magnitude and tilt (forward/side) for the resultant vectors may be calculated as follows.<br><br>
The means for measuring position may measure displacement in a lateral or side to side flexion plane. The means for measuring position may also measure displacement in an extension or front to back flexion plane. The means for measuring position may include means for measuring rotation. A measure of rotation may be derived from one or more accelerometers, muscle activity and/or one or more gyroscopes.<br><br>
The means for measuring muscle activity may include means for measuring surface electromyography (EMG) to establish electrical activity within a muscle. A measure of EMG may be correlated with muscle activity and/or muscle force. The means for measuring muscle activity may be used to calculate muscle fatigue. The apparatus may include a muscle fatigue algorithm for calculating fatigue level.<br>
The means for measuring muscle activity may be adapted to measure activity of muscles in the lumbar back, the abdominal region or other muscles that correlate with load on the lumbar spine. In some embodiments activity of muscles may additionally be measured in the biceps of the subject. Measurement of activity in antigravity muscles in an upper limb such as the biceps may assist in resolving ambiguous readings of muscle activity from the back muscles particularly when performing a lifting operation from a fully bent over position. The activity of erector spinae/multifidus and biceps brachii muscles may be measured via recordings of EMG.<br>
The apparatus of the present invention may include means for measuring skin stretch. The means for measuring skin stretch may include a helical coil. When the coil extends, its impedance may change in a reliable and repeatable way. The change in impedance may be measured in any suitable manner and by any suitable means such as means of a bridge circuit.<br>
The means for storing may receive data from the or each measuring means. Each measuring means may include an analog to digital (A to D) converter. Alternatively, the or at least some of the measuring means may output analog data. The data storing means may include one or more A to D converters to convert the analog data to a digital domain prior to storing the data. The apparatus may include a digital processor for processing the data. The processor may process the data in real time to provide bio-feedback to the person being monitored. The digital processor may include an algorithm for evaluating risk of back injury. The algorithm may perform calculations based on risk assessment principles. The risk assessment may include an evaluation of risk components associated with individual data provided by each measuring<br><br>
means. The risk components may include profile data associated with the person being monitored. Profile data may include personal data and family history which may have a bearing on risk of back strain and/or injury. The cumulative evaluation may be used to provide bio-feedback by various means and may be used as a warning of impending risk and/or retraining system for rehabilitation of an existing injury. The risk components may be combined in accordance with risk assessment principles to provide a cumulative evaluation of risk of back strain and/or injury. The risk components may be combined in a linear or non-linear fashion, eg. weightings may be attributed to the risk components that reflect the contribution that each component makes to the overall assessment of risk. The data storing means may store data in digital format for later analysis and/or reporting. The data storing means may include a memory means such as card, stick or the like for storing the digital data. The memory means may be removable to facilitate downloading the data to a remote processing device such as a PC.<br>
The system of the present invention may include a user interface means. The user interface means may include a display screen and one or more controls such as buttons or the like to allow the user to interact with the data storing means.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Fig 1 shows a pair of transducer pads 10, 11 and an EMG electrode assembly 12. Pads 10, 11 and EMG assembly are connected to a data logger (not shown) via detachable plug in cables 13, 14. Transducer pads are positioned on the back of a person being monitored as described with reference to Figs. 2A and 2B.<br>
The transducer pads 10, 11 are attached to the skin in any suitable manner such as via adhesive tape. Each transducer pad 10, 11 incorporates one or more accelerometers. Preferably angular changes of lumbar spine orientation are measured by use of four accelerometers, two of which are placed at the upper lumbar spine and other two, at the lower lumbar spine.<br>
If one accelerometer is used in each transducer pad it should be mounted such that it is located centrally over the spine. Each transducer pad 10, 11 may be at least 10cm wide and may include a gyroscope to provide rotational data.<br>
EMG electrode assembly 12 includes a plurality of EMG electrodes 15-19. Electrodes 16, 17 are adapted to measure muscle activity on the left side of the person's back and electrodes 18, 19 are adapted to measure muscle activity on the right side of the person's back. Electrode 15 is a reference electrode for each circuit associated with EMG electrodes 16-18.<br>
Referring to Fig 2A use of the monitoring apparatus requires locating of landmarks on the lower back to ensure reliable readings. The landmarks may be located using the following procedure:<br><br>
The subject should be instructed to stand upright but relaxed;<br>
If hair on the lumbar region of the subject has not been clipped, hair<br>
clippers may be used to remove excessive hair from the region;<br>
An alcohol wipe may be used to clean the skin in the region thoroughly<br>
(to remove any oil on the skin);<br>
The PSIS (Posterior Superior Iliac Spine) should be located and marked<br>
on the left and right sides such that each is the size of an olive;<br>
A small horizontal line should be drawn across the middle of each PSIS<br>
'olive';<br>
The two horizontal marks should be joined with one extended horizontal<br>
line (Line "A") stretching across the spine;<br>
After confirming that the subject is in their starting position, a distance of<br>
150 mm up from line "A" should be measured with a soft measuring tape<br>
pressed against the subjects skin, gently following skin contours, and<br>
marked with a small horizontal line (Line "B");<br>
Two less prominent lines 'C and 'D' should be marked.   Line "D" should<br>
be 10 mm down from line "A" and Line "C" should be 10 mm up from Line<br>
"B'The subject should be instructed to stand with feet shoulder width apart<br>
and the distance between the lines "A" and "B" verified;<br>
The subject should be instructed to bend forward to their marker, keeping<br>
their knees straight.<br>
The subject should be instructed to return to their starting position.<br>
Adhesive sheets should be placed as follows:<br>
(a)	An adhesive sheet should be prepared by removing the backing;<br>
(b)	The subject should be instructed to bend forward to their marker.<br>
When the patient is in this position, the adhesive sheet should be placed<br>
such that it's top edge aligns with line "A" (see Fig. 2A).   The subject<br>
should be instructed to return to their starting position;<br>
(c)	When the subject is upright, the second adhesive sheet should be<br>
prepared and placed such that its bottom edge aligns with Line "B".<br>
The apparatus of the present invention should be accurately fixed to the back of the person being monitored to minimize reading errors.   Referring to Fig 2B<br><br>
care  should   be  taken  in  fixing  the  transducer pads  and   EMG  electrode assembly. Fixation preferably should adhere to the following precautions:<br>
Care should be taken not to rotate the accelerometers in relation to each<br>
other.   If the coil in between them is twisted, it's readings may become<br>
unstable.<br>
Accelerometer two should be placed lightly on the centre of the spine,<br>
with its bottom edge aligned with Line "B".  It should be pressed just hard<br>
enough to ensure it stays in position.<br>
Accelerometer one should be placed lightly on the centre of the spine,<br>
with its top edge aligned with Line "A".   It should be pressed just hard<br>
enough to ensure it stays in position.<br>
The subject should be instructed to bend forward to their marker and<br>
hold.      Whilst  the   patient   is   in   this   position,   placement   of   both<br>
accelerometers may be verified.    If okay, each accelerometer board<br>
should be pressed down firmly to ensure good adhesion.   The subject<br>
should be instructed to return to their starting position.<br>
The subject should be instructed to bend forward to their marker slowly,<br>
and return to their starting position.   When this is occurring, placement<br>
and adhesion of the accelerometer pads should be verified.<br>
The diagram shown in Fig. 3A includes accelerometer 30, low pass (averaging) filter 31 and analog to digital (A to D) converter 32. Accelerometer 30 preferably includes a 3D or 3 axes accelerometer such as a Kionix KXM52. Alternatively, accelerometer 30 may comprise a pair of 2D accelerometers such as a device type ADXLZ10E. Each transducer pad 10, 11 may include an accelerometer such as accelerometer 30. Each accelerometer 30 provides outputs that are proportional to acceleration being applied to its respective axes. As gravity provides a constant acceleration of 9.8 m/s2 directly downward, a stable point of reference can be used to determine inclination. By using a minimum of 3 axes, a 3 dimensional vector pointing in the direction of acceleration may be generated. By using two accelerometers, one in each transducer pad, the angle between the accelerometers may be calculated using appropriate software.<br><br>
Low pass filter 31 provides an averaging function for the accelerometer signal by removing sudden changes in acceleration which may cause aliasing errors. A to D converter 32 provides a digital representation of the accelerometer signal suitable for processing via a digital processor.<br>
The diagram shown in Fig. 3B includes gyroscope 33, low pass (averaging) filter 34 and A to D converter 32. Gyroscope 33 preferably includes a device type ADXRS300.<br>
The EMG diagram shown in Fig. 4 includes input amplifier 40, filter 41, precision rectifier 42, low pass (averaging) filter 43 and A to D converter 44. Amplifier 40 includes a plurality of inputs for receiving signals from EMG electrodes 15-19. Amplifier 40 includes highly sensitive inputs for amplifying the very small signals produced from electrodes 15-19. Low pass filter 43 removes unwanted portions of the frequency spectrum. Filter 41 may include a band pass filter. A to D converter 44 provides a digital representation of the EMG signal suitable for processing via a digital processor<br>
The flexion diagram shown in Fig 5 includes oscillator 50, resistor 51, amplifier 52, precision rectifier 53, low pass (averaging) filter 54 and A to D converter 55. Oscillator 50 provides an AC excitation voltage for a flexion sensor 56 such as a helical coil of wire. The coil of wire forms an inductor. Many variables affect the value of the inductance such as coil length. By stretching and contracting the coil the inductance is varied. The impedance of the coil is proportional to inductance according to the formula:<br>
XL=2TTfL wherein XL = impedance, f = oscillator frequency, and L = the coil inductance.<br>
Oscillator 50 should be stable in amplitude and frequency. Resistor 51 may be arranged to form with the flexion sensor 56, a voltage divider. As the value of resistor 51 is constant, the input voltage to amplifier 52 is controlled entirely by the changing impedance of the flexion sensor 56. Low pass filter 54 is an averaging filter and is used to remove sudden changes in the impedance of the<br><br>
flexion sensor 56. A to D converter 55 provides a digital representation of the flexion impedance signal suitable for processing via a digital processor.<br>
The diagram shown in Figs. 6a to 6d includes accelerometer package 30A. Accelerometer package 30A may be a device type KXM52 - L20 or equivalent. The output of each channel (x, y, z axes) of accelerometer 30A is connected to a respective low pass filter 31 A, 31B, 31C. The output of each filter 31 A, 31B, 31C is connected to a respective input of A to D converter 32A. A to D converter 32A may be a device type DS2450S. The diagram also includes a gyroscope circuit 33A including an angular rate sensor such as a device type ADXRS300. The gyroscope circuit 33A provides orientation reference data for calculating changes in body position. The output of gyroscope circuit 33A is connected via low pass filter 34A to an input of A to D converter 32A. The output of A to D converter 32A is in a digital format and is connected to a digital processing circuit (not shown) such as a microprocessor. The digital output may be connected to a PC via a suitable interface.<br>
The EMG circuit shown in Figs. 7a to 7d includes input amplifiers 40A and 40B. Each input amplifier 40A, 40B receives an input from a respective pair of electrodes 15-16 and 15-17 associated with EMG electrode assembly 12. The output of input amplifier 40A passes via low pass and high pass filters 43A, 41A to rectifier and integrator 42A. The output of rectifier and integrator 42A is applied to one input of A to D converter 44A. The output of input amplifier 40B passes via a similar low pass and high pass filter and rectifier and integrator and is applied to a respective input of A to D converter 44A. The output of A to D converter 44A is in a digital format and is connected to a digital processing circuit as described above. A second EMG circuit similar to that shown in Figs. 7a-7d is used to interface pairs of electrodes 15-18 and 15-19 associated with EMG electrode assembly 12 to the digital processing circuit.<br>
The flexion circuit shown in Figs. 8a to 8d includes crystal controlled oscillator 50A. The output of oscillator 50A is applied to respective inputs (In1 - In3) of flexion channels 81, 82, 83. Flexion channel 81 includes a resistive divider comprising resistors R6, R49.  One arm of the divider is connected to a channel<br><br>
of a flexion coil (not shown). An output of the divider is connected to amplifier 52A. The output of amplifier 52A is connected via rectifier circuit 53A to low pass filter 54A. The output of filter 54A is connected to one input of A to D converter 55A. Flexion channels 82, 83 are configured similarly to flexion channel 81 and will not be described in detail. The outputs of flexion channels 82, 83 are connected to respective inputs of A to D converter 55A. The output of A to D converter 55A is in a digital format and is connected to a digital processing circuit as described above.<br>
Digital data from the accelerometer, EMG and flexion circuits is processed in the digital domain via a digital processing engine such as a suitably programmed microprocessor or the like. The microprocessor may be included with the data logger or it may be located remotely from the data logger. Data may be processed in real time to provide real time feedback to the person being monitored. The feedback may include a measure or evaluation of risk of back strain and/or injury based on the data collected during a predetermined time frame(s). Alternatively, the data may be processed offline to provide an assessment of activities logged during a preceding time frame(s) such as a day's activities with respect of risk of back strain and/or injury.<br>
The digital processing engine may be programmed with suitable software for evaluating risk of back strain and/or injury. The software may determine risk components associated with data provided by the accelerometer, EMG, flexion and other circuits as appropriate. The risk components may be combined in accordance with risk assessment principles to provide a cumulative measure of risk of back strain and/or injury. The risk components may be combined in a specific algorithm to give a risk score that is accumulated per unit of time, such as per second, for an entire time that a monitoring device is worn by a person. The accumulated or aggregate score may be matched to the wearer's personalized preset thresholds. When the aggregate or accumulated score reaches personalized risk thresholds, biofeedback (vibrational, visual and/or auditory) may be triggered. There may be more than one theme of biofeedback. For example, feedback may be based on an hourly aggregate score and on a further aggregate score calculated over a shorter time frame<br><br>
such as a sliding five minute window. The different themes have regard to the fact that risk of injury may arise from a variety of contributing events including events associated with a short burst or bursts of relatively intensive activity as well as events associated with longer periods of less intensive activity that present significant risk when accumulated over a period such as an hour or more.<br>
Flow charts illustrating examples of software for processing data from the accelerometer, EMG and flexion circuits are shown in Figs. 9 to 17. The software may be adapted for calculating a cumulative score indicative of risk of back strain and/or injury.<br>
