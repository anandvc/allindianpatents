SPECIFICATION<br>
ARYL 5-THIO-p-D-GLUCOPYRANOSIDE DERIVATIVES AND THERAPEUTIC AGENTS FOR DIABETES CONTAINING THE SAME<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to 5-thio-|3-D-glucopyranoside compounds capable of inhibiting the activity of sodium-dependent glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2), which is specifically present in the kidney and is involved in glucose reabsorption. The present invention also relates to pharmaceutical preparations, particularly therapeutic agents for diabetes, which comprise such a compound as an active ingredient.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Chronic hyperglycemia is believed to reduce both insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity, which in turn will cause elevation of blood glucose levels and lead to exacerbation of diabetes. Drugs conventionally used as therapeutic agents for diabetes include biguanides, sulfonylureas, glycosidase inhibitors and insulin-resistance improving agents. However, adverse side effects of these drugs have been reported; for example, lactic acidosis for biguanides, hypoglycemia for sulfonylureas, and diarrhea for glycosidase inhibitors. It is therefore desirable to develop therapeutic agents for diabetes that depend on a new mechanism of action<br><br>
which is different from those conventionally proposed.<br>
Phloridzin, a glucose derivative isolated from nature, has been identified as having a hypoglycemic effect by inhibiting excessive glucose reabsorption in the kidney to accelerate the glucose excretion (J. Clin. Invest., vol, 80, p. 1037,1987; J, Clin, Invest,, vol, 87, p. 1510, 1987). There have been indications that this glucose reabsorption event is mediated by sodium-dependent glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) present at the SI site of renal proximal tubules (J. Clin, Invest,, vol. 93, p. 397, 1994) .<br>
Under these backgrounds, an increasing number of studies have been conducted to develop therapeutic agents for diabetes that depend on SGLT2 inhibition, and a large number of phloridzin derivatives have been reported.<br>
By way of example, there has been reported an aryl (3-D-glucopyranoside compound having the following formula:<br><br>
(European Patent Publication No. EP0850948),  In addition to this, other relevant compounds have also been disclosed (International Patent Publication Nos, WO0168660, WO0116147, WO0174834, WO0174835, WO0253573, WO0268439, WO0268440, WO0236602, WO0288157, WO0228872, WO0244192, WO0264606, WO0311880, WO0320737, WO0300712, etc.).<br><br>
When administered orally, phloridzin derivatives are hydrolyzed at glycosidic linkages by the action of glycosidase present in the small intestine, thus resulting in low absorption efficiency of unchanged form and a weak hypoglycemic effect- For this reason, various attempts have been made, for example, to increase absorption efficiency by administering phloridzin derivatives in the form of prodrugs and/or to prevent digestion by synthesizing compounds replaced by carbon-carbon linkages instead of glycosidic linkages (United States Patent Nos. US20010041674, US2002137903 and US20031143, International Patent Publication No- WO0127128 and International Patent Publication No. WO0283066).<br>
However, since no chemical synthesis technique has been developed for -β-selective glycosylation of 5-thioglucose derivatives in which the ring oxygen atom of glucose is replaced by a sulfur atom, there is no report on 5-thio-β-D-glucopyranoside compounds. Thus, there is also no report on the SGLT2-inhibiting effect of 5-thio-fi-D-glucopyranoside derivatives.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide novel compounds which have a hypoglycemic effect by inhibiting the activity of SGLT2 involved in glucose reabsorption in the kidney to accelerate excretion of urinary sugar.<br>
As a result of extensive and intensive efforts made<br><br>
to overcome the problems stated above, the inventors of the present invention have found a method of enabling selective synthesis of 5-thio-β-D-glucopyranosides. Using this method, they also have synthesized aryl 5-thio-β-D-glucopyranoside derivatives or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof (hereinafter referred to as "the compound of the present invention") and have found that these compounds have an SGLT2-inhibiting effect- These findings led to the completion of the present invention.<br>

The compound of the present invention allows inhibition of sodium-dependent glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) involved in glucose reabsorption in the kidney (J. Clin, Invest,, vol, 93, p* 397, 1994),<br>
Through inhibition of SGLT2, the compound of the present invention prevents sugar reabsorption and removes excess sugar from the body to thereby treat diabetes. Thus, the compound of the present invention corrects hyperglycemia without applying any load to pancreatic p cells, and improves insulin resistance.<br>
Thus, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical preparation for preventing or treating diseases or conditions which can be ameliorated by inhibition of SGLT2 activity, e.g,, diabetes, diabetes-related diseases and diabetic complications.<br>
As used herein, the term "diabetes" encompasses type I diabetes, type II diabetes, and other types of diabetes with specific etiology.<br>
As used herein, the term "diabetes-related diseases"<br><br>
includes adiposis, hyperlnsulinemia, abnormal carbohydrate metabolism, hyperlipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, abnormal lipid metabolism, hypertension, congestive heart failure, edema, hyperuricemia and gout.<br>
As used herein, the term "diabetic complications" can be classified into acute complications and chronic complications.<br>
The term "acute complications" includes hyperglycemia (e.g., ketoacidosis), infections (e,g., skin, soft tissue, biliary system, respiratory system and urinary tract infections), etc.<br>

Major complications are diabetic retinopathy, diabetic nephropathy and diabetic neuropathy.<br>
The compound of the present invention may also be used in combination with any therapeutic agent for diabetes, diabetic complications, hyperlipidemia or hypertension, which depends on a different mechanism of action other than inhibition of SGLT2 activity. When combined with other drugs, the compound of the present invention can be expected to produce an additive effect on these diseases, which is greater than either one alone.<br><br>

The compound of the present invention can be synthesized, for example, as shown in the production schemes below.<br>
A key intermediate 5-thio-D-glucopyranose (VII) can<br><br><br>
The penta-O-acetate derivative (V) (Tetrahedron Lett., vol. 22, p. 5061, 1981; J. Org. Chem., vol. 31, p. 1514, 1966) can be synthesized via 8 steps from D-glucofurano-3,6-lactone (IV).<br>
Next, Compound (V) may be treated in an appropriate solvent (e.g., DMF, THF, methanol, ethanol) using hydrazine acetate (Tetrahedron, Lett*, vol. 33, p. 7675, 1992) or benzylamine, preferably a 1:1 mixture of methylhydrazine and acetic acid, to effect selective deprotection of the 1-position acetyl group, thereby preparing Compound (VI). The reaction temperature ranges from room temperature to 80°C, while the reaction time ranges from 20 minutes to 24 hours.<br>
After the 1-position hydroxyl group of Compound (VI) is protected (e.g., with a tetrahydropyranyl group), the compound may be deprotected to remove the acetyl groups and treated with a C2-10 acyl chloride (e.g., a C2.6 alkanoyl<br><br>
chloride or benzoyl chloride) under basic conditions, thereby giving the 5-thio-D-glucopyranose derivative (VII) {wherein R21, R22# R23 and R24, which may be the same or different, each represent a C2-10 acyl group (e.g., a C2-6 alkanoyl group or a benzoyl group)} (Chem. Lett., p. 626, 2002).<br>
With respect to the intermediate Ar-YH corresponding to the aglycon, a compound of the following formula:<br><br>
(wherein R5, R6, R7, R8, R9 and Y are as defined above), which is an intermediate for the compound of Formula (I), can be synthesized by reference to the following official gazettes: International Patent Publication Nos. WO0168660, WO0174834, WO0174835, WO0228872, WO0244192, WO0264606 and WO0311880.<br>
In the case of an intermediate for the compound of Formula (II) wherein X is -CH2-, for example, phenol (IX) may be condensed with benzyl alcohol (X) under acidic conditions to prepare Compound (XI).<br>
Scheme 2<br><br><br>
(wherein R32 and R33, which may be the same or different, each represent a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom or a Ca_6 alkyl group, and R10, Rn, R12, R13 and R14 are as defined above.)<br>
An acid available for use in the condensation may be, for example, methanesulfonic acid or p-toluenesulfonic acid.  If a solvent is used, a high-boiling solvent such as nitrobenzene is preferred. The reaction temperature ranges from 100°C to 200°Cf while the reaction time ranges from 10 minutes to 150 minutes.<br><br><br>
(wherein the wavy line means containing any stereoisomer selected from D-form, L-form and a mixture thereof, and each substituent is as defined above.)<br>
Next, the 5-thio-D-glucopyranose derivative (VI) or (VII) may be condensed with Ar-YH under Mitsunobu reaction conditions using an azo reagent and phosphines (Org. Reactions, vol. 42, p. 335) to prepare Compound (XII).<br>
Solvents available for use in the Mitsunobu reaction include tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, toluene, methylene chloride, chloroform, acetonitrile, ethyl acetate, dimethyl sulfoxide and N,N-dimethylformamide. Preferred are tetrahydrofuran and toluene, and more preferred is toluene. Phosphines available for use include triphenylphosphine, tri-n-butylphosphine, tri-t-butylphosphine, tritolylphosphine and diphenyl-2-pyridylphosphine. Among them, preferred are triphenylphosphine and diphenyl-2-pyridylphosphine, and more preferred is triphenylphosphine. Azo reagents available for use include diethyl azodicarboxylate, diisopropyl azodicarboxylate and di-tert-butyl azodicarboxylate, as well as 1,1'-azobis(N,N-dimethylformamide) and 1,1'-(azodicarbonyl)dipiperidine. Among them, preferred are diethyl azodicarboxylate and diisopropyl azodicarboxylate. The reaction temperature preferably ranges from -20°C to room temperature.<br>
If necessary. Compound (XII) may further be deprotected to remove the protecting groups of sugar hydroxyl groups and/or optionally modified into a prodrug<br><br>
form, thus obtaining Compound (i) according to the present invention.<br>
The deprotection may be accomplished by using a base such as sodium methoxide, sodium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, cesium carbonate or triethylamine. Solvents suitable for the reaction include methanol, ethanol and aqueous methanol.<br>
Likewise, the modification into a prodrug form may be accomplished by using any protective agent for hydroxyl groups well known to those skilled in the art (e.g., acid anhydrides, chloroformate esters) to convert »0R21 to -OR24 (wherein R21 to R24 are as defined above) into -OR1 to -OR4 (wherein R1 to R4 each represent a group constituting a prodrug). Solvents suitable for the above reaction include collidine, pyridine and N,N-dimethylformamide.<br>
Examples of a "group constituting a prodrug" include protecting groups for hydroxyl groups which can be commonly used in prodrugs, such as a C2-10 acyl group {e.g., a C2_e alkanoyl group (preferably a C2-6 alkanoyl group) or a benzoyl group}, a C2-6 alkoxycarbonyl group, a C1-6 alkoxy-C2_10 acyl group (preferably a C1-6 alkoxy-C2-6 alkanoyl group) and a C1-6 alkoxy-C2.6 alkoxycarbonyl group.<br>
Alternatively, when controlling the reaction conditions, only -OR24 can be selectively reacted and converted into -OR4. In this case, preferred as R4 is a C2-6 alkanoyl group, a C2.6 alkoxycarbonyl group or the like.<br>
Alternatively, Compound (XV) according to the present invention can be prepared as follows.<br><br><br>
(wherein R1 to R4, R21 to R27f X and A1 are as defined above,)<br>
Compound (VII) may be condensed with Compound (XIII) through Mitsunobu reaction to prepare Compound (III). Next, the moiety X-A1 may be constructed through Suzuki coupling reaction, Stille coupling reaction, dehydration condensation, aldol condensation or the like, thereby preparing Compound (XIV).<br>
For example, in a case where R25 is an amino group, a hydroxyl group or a halogen atom, these groups may be coupled with an optionally substituted arylboric acid (e.g., phenylboric acid) or an optionally substituted heteroarylboric acid in the presence of a palladium catalyst (e.g,, Pd2(OAc)2, Pd(dba)2, dba:dibenzyliden acetone, Pd(PPh3)4) or a copper catalyst (e.g., Cu(OAc)2) to prepare a derivative in which A1 is an optionally<br><br>
substituted aryl or heteroaryl group and X is -NH-, -0- or a single bond. In this reaction, a copper catalyst such as Cu(OAc)2 is preferred.<br>
Alternatively, in a case where R25 is a halogen atom, this group may be coupled with an optionally substituted aryltributyltln (e.g., phenyltributyltin) or an optionally substituted heteroaryltributyltin in the presence of a palladium catalyst (e.g., Pd2(OAc)2, Pd(dba)2, Pd(PPh3)4) to prepare a derivative in which A1 is an optionally substituted aryl or heteroaryl group and X is a single bond.<br>
Alternatively, in a case where R25 is a C2.6 alkanoyl group, this group may be subjected to aldol condensation with A1-CH0 (wherein A1 is as defined above) (e.g., formylbenzofuran) . Alternatively, in a case where R25 is a formyl group, this group may be treated with Ax-MgBr or A*Li to prepare a synthetic intermediate in which X is -CHOH-.<br>
Alternatively, in a case where R25 is an amino group or a carboxyl group, these groups may be condensed with A1-(CH2)nCOzH or A1-(CHa)nNH2 (wherein n represents an integer of 0 to 3) in the presence of a dehydration condensing agent {e.g., N,N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), water-soluble carbodiimide hydrochloride (WSC-HC1), carbonyldiimidazole (CDI)} to prepare a compound in which X is -NHC0(CH2)n- or -C0NH(CH2)n- (wherein n represents an integer of 0 to 3).<br>
If necessary. Compound (XIV) may further be<br><br>
deprotected to remove the protecting groups of sugar hydroxyl groups and/or optionally modified into a prodrug form, thus obtaining Compound (XV) according to the present invention.<br>

Using the corresponding starting materials and reactants, the same procedures as shown in the above examples were repeated to give the following compounds according to the present invention, which are summarized in Table 1 below, along with the compounds obtained in the above examples.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Test Example<br>
According to the reported procedure (Aanal. Biochem., vol, 201# p. 301, 1984), a suspension of rat renal brush border membrane vehicles (BBMVs) was prepared (protein concentration: 4 mg/mL) . This suspension (50 \xL)  was pre-incubated at 37°C for 2 minutes, followed by addition of 150 \iL  reaction solution containing a test compound dissolved in DMSO (final DMSO content: 1%) as well as 100 mM mannitol, 100 mM NaSCN or KSCN, 10 mM HEPES/Tris (pH 7.4), D-glucose (final concentration: 0.1 mM) and 1 ^iCi D-[6-3H]glucose (Amersham) . After reaction at 37°C for 5 seconds, 1 mL ice-cold reaction stop solution (150 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES/Tris (pH 7.4), 0*3 mM phloridzin) was added to the reaction mixture to stop the reaction. The reaction mixture was immediately filtered by rapid filtration using a membrane filter (pore size: 0.45 nm, HAWP02500, Millipore) to separate BBMVs. This membrane filter was washed three times with 4.5 mL ice-cold reaction stop solution, dried sufficiently and then assayed for radioactivity using a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman) to determine the amount of glucose trapped inside the BBMVs on the membrane filter.<br>
Assuming that the amount of trapped glucose in the absence of a test compound was set to 100%, the concentration required for the test compound to cause 50% inhibition of the amount of trapped glucose was calculated (IC50 value),<br>
The results obtained were shown in Table 2 below.<br><br><br>
