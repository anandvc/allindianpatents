				<td>Flame-hydrolytically Produced Titanium Dioxide Powder<br>
The invention relates to flame-hydrolytically produced<br>
titanium dioxide powder, and its production and use.<br>
It is known that titanium dioxide can be produced by<br>
pyrogenic processes. Pyrogenic processes are understood to<br>
include flame oxidations or flame hydrolyses. In flame<br>
oxidation a titanium dioxide precursor, for example<br>
titanium tetrachloride, is oxidised with oxygen according<br>
to equation la. In flame hydrolysis the formation of<br>
titanium dioxide is effected by hydrolysis of the titanium<br>
dioxide precursor, the water necessary for the hydrolysis<br>
being derived from the combustion of a fuel gas, for<br>
example hydrogen, and oxygen (equation lb).<br><br>
EP-A-1231186 claims a titanium dioxide with a BET surface<br>
of between 3 and 200 m2/g with a weight-related D90 diameter<br>
of the particles of 2.2 urn or less. D90 diameters of between<br>
0.8 and 2.1 urn are mentioned in the examples of<br>
implementation. In addition, a titanium dioxide is<br>
obtained with a BET surface of between 3 and 200 m2/g and a<br>
distribution constant n of 1.7 or more, calculated<br>
according to the formula R = 100 exp(-bDn), where D denotes<br>
the particle diameter and b is a constant. The value n is<br>
obtained from the three values D10, D50 and D90, which are<br>
related to one another by an approximate straight line.<br>
The titanium dioxide is obtained by a flame oxidation of<br>
titanium tetrachloride and an oxidising gas, the starting<br><br>
materials being pre-heated to a temperature of at least<br>
500°C before the reaction. In preferred embodiments the<br>
velocity of the reaction mixture is 10 m/sec or more, and<br>
the residence time in the reaction space is 3 sec or less.<br>
In EP-A-778812 a process for the production of titanium<br>
dioxide by a combination of flame oxidation and flame<br>
hydrolysis is described. In this connection titanium<br>
tetrachloride in the vapour state and oxygen are mixed in a<br>
reaction zone and the mixture is heated in a flame that is<br>
generated by combustion of a hydrocarbon as fuel gas. The<br>
titanium tetrachloride is fed into the central core of the<br>
reactor, the oxygen is fed into a tubular sleeve<br>
surrounding the central core, and the fuel gas is fed into<br>
a tubular sleeve that surrounds those tubes that convey the<br>
titanium tetrachloride and oxygen.<br>
A laminar diffusion flame reactor is preferably employed.<br>
In this method it is possible to produce titanium dioxide<br>
powder of large surface area containing a large proportion<br>
of the anatase modification. In EP-A-778812 no information<br>
is given regarding the structure and size of the primary<br>
particles and aggregates. However, it is these quantities<br>
in particular that are important for many applications, for<br>
example in cosmetics applications or as an abrasive in<br>
dispersions for the electronics industry. The mechanism of<br>
the formation of the titanium dioxide according to EP-A-<br>
778812 includes both a flame oxidation (equation 1a) as<br>
well as a flame hydrolysis (equation lb). Although the<br>
different formation mechanisms enable the anatase fraction<br>
to be controlled, a specific distribution of the primary<br>
particles and aggregates cannot however be achieved. A<br>
further disadvantage of this method, as is mentioned in US-<br><br>
A-20002/0004029, is the incomplete conversion of titanium<br>
tetrachloride and fuel gas and the resultant grey<br>
colouration of the titanium dioxide.<br>
These problems are eliminated according to US-A-<br>
20002/0004029, by now using five tubes instead of the three<br>
tubes as described in EP-A-778812. For this, titanium<br>
tetrachloride vapour, argon, oxygen, hydrogen and air are<br>
simultaneously metered into a flame reactor. The<br>
disadvantage of this method is the use of the expensive<br>
noble gas argon and a low yield of titanium dioxide due to<br>
low concentrations of titanium tetrachloride in the<br>
reaction gas.<br>
A titanium dioxide powder produced by flame hydrolysis has<br>
for a long time been marketed by Degussa under the<br>
reference P 25.<br>
This is a finely particulate titanium dioxide powder with a<br>
specific surface of 50+15 m2/g, a mean size of the primary<br>
particles of 21 nm, a compacted bulk density (approximate<br>
value) of 130 g/1, an HC1 content of less than or equal to<br>
0.300 wt.% and a screening residue according to Mocker<br>
(45 urn) of less than or equal to 0.050%. This powder has<br>
good properties for many applications.<br>
The prior art demonstrates the wide interest in<br>
pyrogenically produced titanium dioxide. In this<br>
connection it is found that the common generic term<br>
"pyrogenic", i.e. flame hydrolysis and flame oxidation, is<br>
not an adequate description of titanium dioxide. On<br>
account of the complexity of the pyrogenic processes only a<br>
few substance parameters can be specifically adjusted.<br><br>
Titanium dioxide is employed in particular in catalysis,<br>
for example photocatalysis, in cosmetics, for example<br>
sunscreen agents, as an abrasive in the form of dispersions<br>
in the electronics industry, or for heat stabilisation of<br>
polymers. In these uses increasing demands are placed on<br>
the purity and structure of the titanium dioxide. Thus, it<br>
is for example important that, when using titanium dioxide<br>
as an abrasive in dispersions, the titanium dioxide has a<br>
good dispersibility and is as far as possible free from<br>
coarse particles that can scratch the surface to be<br>
polished.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
titanium dioxide powder that has a high purity, is easy to<br>
disperse, and is as far as possible free of coarse<br>
fractions.<br>
The object of the present invention is also to provide a<br>
process for the production of the titanium dioxide powder.<br>
In this connection the process should be able to be<br>
implemented on an industrial scale.<br>
The present invention provides a flame-hydrolytically<br>
produced titanium dioxide powder that is present in<br>
aggregates of primary particles, characterised in that<br>
it has a BET surface of 20 to 200 m2/g and<br>
the half width HW, in nanometers, of the primary<br>
particle distribution has values between<br><br><br>
the proportion of particles with a diameter of more<br>
than 45 urn is in a range from 0.0001 to 0.05 wt. %.<br>
The term primary particles in the context of the invention<br>
is understood to denote particles that are first of all<br>
formed in the reaction and that can coalesce to form<br>
aggregates during the further course of the reaction.<br>
The term aggregate within the context of the invention is<br>
understood to denote primary particles of similar structure<br>
and size that have coalesced together, and whose surface is<br>
smaller than the sum of the individual, isolated primary<br>
particles. Several aggregates or also individual primary<br>
particles may combine together further to form<br>
agglomerates. Aggregates or primary particles accordingly<br>
lie adjacent to one another in the form of point objects.<br>
Depending on their degree of coalescence, agglomerates may<br>
be broken up by application of energy.<br>
Aggregates on the other hand can be broken up only by a<br>
high input of energy or even cannot be broken up at all.<br>
Intermediate forms exist.<br>
The mean half width HW of the primary particle distribution<br>
(in numerical terms) is obtained by image analysis of TEM<br>
photographs. According to the invention the mean half<br>
width is a function of the BET surface with a constant f,<br>
where -1.3 ≤ f ≤ -1.0. Preferably the half width may lie<br>
in the range -1.2 ≤ f ≤ -1.1.<br><br>
It is the high BET surface, the narrow distribution of the<br>
primary particle distribution and the small proportion of<br>
aggregates with a diameter of more than 45 µm, which lies<br>
in a range from 0.0001 to 0.05 wt.%, that are relevant for<br>
the positive properties of the powder according to the<br>
invention, for example when polishing surfaces. No flame-<br>
hydrolytically produced titanium dioxide powders are known<br>
in the prior art that exhibit these features<br>
simultaneously. It is of course possible for example to<br>
remove to a large extent powders according to the prior art<br>
mechanically from aggregates with a diameter of more than<br>
45 urn, though the resultant powder would however not be<br>
able to achieve the ranges claimed by the present invention<br>
as regards BET surface and half width values of the primary<br>
particles.<br>
The BET surface of the titanium dioxide powder according to<br>
the invention lies in a wide range from 20 to 200 m2/g. It<br>
has proved advantageous if the BET surface lies in a range<br>
from 40 to 60 m2/g. A range of 45 to 55 m2/g may be<br>
particularly advantageous.<br>
For a titanium dioxide powder according to the invention<br>
with a BET surface between 40 and 60 m2/g, the 90% spread of<br>
the number distribution of the primary particle diameters<br>
may lie between 10 and 100 nm. As a rule the 90% spread of<br>
the number distribution of the primary particle diameters<br>
is between 10 and 40 nm.<br>
Furthermore, the equivalent circular diameter of the<br>
aggregates (ECD) of such a titanium dioxide powder may be<br>
less than 80 nm.<br><br>
The mean aggregate area of a titanium dioxide powder<br>
according to the invention with a BET surface of 40 to<br>
60 m2/g may be less than 6500 nm2 and the mean aggregate<br>
circumference may be less than 450 nm.<br>
In addition the BET surface of the titanium dioxide powder<br>
according to the invention may lie in a range from 80 to<br>
120 m2/g. A range of 85 to 95 m2/g may be particularly<br>
preferred.<br>
For a titanium dioxide powder according to the invention<br>
with a BET surface between 80 and 120 m2/g, a 90% spread of<br>
the number distribution of the primary particle diameters<br>
may have values between 4 and 25 nm. Furthermore, such a<br>
titanium dioxide powder may have an equivalent circular<br>
diameter of the aggregates (ECD) of less than 70 nm.<br>
The mean aggregate area of a titanium dioxide powder<br>
according to the invention with a BET surface of 80 to<br>
120 m2/g may be less than 6000 nm2 and the mean aggregate<br>
circumference may be less than 400 nm.<br>
The proportion of aggregates and/or agglomerates of the<br>
titanium dioxide powder according to the invention with a<br>
diameter of more than 45 jam lies in a range from 0.0001 to<br>
0.05 wt.%. A range from 0.001 to 0.01 wt.% may be<br>
preferred, and a range from 0.002 to 0.005 wt.% may be<br>
particularly preferred.<br>
The titanium dioxide powder according to the invention<br>
contains rutile and anatase as crystal modifications. In<br>
this connection the anatase/rutile proportion for a given<br>
surface may lie in a range from 2:98 to 98:2. The range<br>
from 80:20 to 95:5 may be particularly preferred.<br>
The titanium dioxide powder according to the invention may<br>
contain residues of chloride. The chloride content is<br><br>
preferably less than 0.1 wt.%. A titanium dioxide powder<br>
according to the invention with a chloride content in the<br>
range from 0.01 to 0.05 wt.% may be particularly preferred.<br>
The compacted bulk density of the titanium dioxide powder<br>
according to the invention is not limited. It has however<br>
proved advantageous if the compacted bulk density has<br>
values from 20 to 200 g/1. A compacted bulk density of 30<br>
to 120 g/1 may be particularly preferred.<br>
The present invention also provides a process for the<br>
production of the titanium dioxide powder according to the<br>
invention, which is characterised in that<br>
a titanium halide, preferably titanium tetrachloride,<br>
is vapourised at temperatures of less than 200°C, the<br>
vapours are transferred to a mixing chamber by means<br>
of a carrier gas with a proportion of steam in a range<br>
from 1 to 25 g/m3, and<br>
separately from this, hydrogen, primary air, which may<br>
optionally be enriched with oxygen and/or pre-heated,<br>
and steam are transferred to the mixing chamber,<br>
wherein the proportion of steam is in a range<br>
from 1 to 25 g/m3 primary air,<br>
the lambda value lies in the range from 1 to 9<br>
and the gamma value lies in the range from 1<br>
to 9,<br>
following which<br>
the mixture consisting of the titanium halide vapour,<br>
hydrogen, air and steam is ignited in a burner and the<br>
flame burns into a reaction chamber sealed from the<br><br>
ambient air, wherein<br>
a vacuum of 1 to 200 mbar exists in the reaction<br>
chamber,<br>
the exit velocity of the reaction mixture from<br>
the mixing chamber into the reaction space lies<br>
in a range from 10 to 80 m/sec,<br>
in addition secondary air is introduced into the<br>
reaction chamber, wherein<br>
the ratio of primary air to secondary air is<br>
between 10 and 0.5,<br>
following which the solid is separated from gaseous<br>
substances, and<br>
the solid is then treated with steam.<br>
An essential feature of the process according to the<br>
invention is that the titanium halide is vapourised at<br>
temperatures below 200°C and the vapours are conveyed to<br>
the mixing chamber by means of a carrier gas, for example<br>
air or oxygen, which has a defined carrier gas moisture<br>
content. It has been found for example that the product<br>
quality decreases at higher vapourisation temperatures.<br>
Moreover it has also been found that, within the claimed<br>
steam content of 1 to 25 g/m3 of gas, or primary air, there<br>
is no noticeable hydrolysis of the titanium halide in the<br>
form of caking, whereas on the other hand the steam content<br>
influences the subsequent primary particle and aggregate<br>
structure. Outside the claimed range, no powder according<br>
to the invention can be obtained. In a preferred<br>
embodiment the steam content is between 5 and 20 g/m3 of<br><br>
As carrier gas, air may also be used. This permits a<br>
higher space-time yield in the reaction chamber than when<br>
using an inert gas.<br>
Furthermore, the exit velocity of the reaction mixture from<br>
the mixing chamber into the reaction space lies in a range<br>
from 10 to 80 m/sec. In a preferred embodiment the exit<br>
velocity is between 15 and 60 m/sec, and in a particularly<br>
preferred embodiment is between 20 and 40 m/sec. At values<br>
below this no uniform powder is obtained, but instead a<br>
powder is obtained that contains particles of diameter<br>
45 urn or more in an amount of more than 0.05 wt.%.<br>
In addition the reaction must be carried out so that the<br>
lambda value lies in the range from 1 to 9 and the gamma<br>
value lies in the range from 1 to 9.<br>
Flame-hydrolytically produced oxides are normally obtained<br>
by taking the gaseous starting substances in a<br>
stoichiometric ratio with respect to one another so that<br>
the added hydrogen is at least sufficient to react with the<br>
halogen X present from the titanium halide TiX4 to form HX.<br>
The amount of hydrogen reguired for this purpose is termed<br>
the stoichiometric amount of hydrogen.<br>
The ratio of the added hydrogen to the stoichiometrically<br>
necessary hydrogen defined above is termed gamma. Gamma is<br>
defined as:<br>
Gamma = added hydrogen/stoichiometrically required<br>
hydrogen<br>
or<br>
Gamma = H2 fed in (moles)/H2 stoichiometric (moles) .<br><br>
With flame-hydrolytically produced oxides in addition an<br>
amount of oxygen (for example from the air) is normally<br>
used that is at least sufficient to convert the titanium<br>
halide into titanium dioxide and to convert excess hydrogen<br>
that may still be present into water. This amount of<br>
oxygen is termed the stoichiometric amount of oxygen.<br>
Similarly, the ratio of added oxygen to the<br>
stoichiometrically required oxygen is termed lambda, and is<br>
defined as follows:<br>
Lambda = added oxygen/stoichiometrically required oxygen<br>
or<br>
Lambda = O2 fed in (moles)/O2 stoichiometric (moles).<br>
Moreover, in the process according to the invention, in<br>
addition to the primary air in the mixing chamber air<br>
(secondary air) is directly introduced into the reaction<br>
chamber. It has been found that, without the addition of<br>
the additional air to the mixing chamber, no titanium<br>
dioxide powder according to the invention is obtained. In<br>
this connection it should be noted that the ratio of<br>
primary air to secondary air is between 10 and 0.5. The<br>
ratio is preferably in a range between 5 and 1.<br>
In order to be able accurately to meter in the amount of<br>
secondary air, it is necessary to cause the flame to burn<br>
back into a reaction chamber sealed from the ambient air.<br>
This enables the process to be accurately controlled, which<br>
is essential in order to obtain the titanium dioxide powder<br>
according to the invention. The vacuum in the reaction<br>
chamber is preferably between 10 and 80 mbar.<br>
An essential feature is also to treat the titanium dioxide<br>
powder after separation from gaseous substances with steam.<br><br>
This treatment is primarily intended to remove halide-<br>
containing groups from the surface. At the same time this<br>
treatment reduces the number of agglomerates. The process<br>
may be carried out continuously in such a way that the<br>
powder is treated, in counter-current or co-current, with<br>
steam, possibly together with air, in which connection the<br>
steam is always introduced from below into an upright,<br>
heatable column. The feed of the powder may take place<br>
from below or above into the column. The reaction<br>
conditions may be chosen so that a fluidised bed is formed.<br>
The temperature at which the treatment with steam is<br>
carried out between 250 and 750°C, values from 450 to 550°C<br>
being preferred. In addition it is preferred to carry out<br>
the treatment in counter-current in such a way that no<br>
fluidised bed is formed.<br>
Moreover it may be advantageous to introduce the steam<br>
together with the air into the mixing chamber.<br>
Fig. 1A shows diagrammatically an arrangement for carrying<br>
out the process according to the invention. In the figure:<br>
A = mixing chamber, B = flame, C = reaction chamber, D =<br>
solid/gaseous separation, E = post-treatment with steam.<br>
The substances used are identified as follows: a = mixture<br>
of titanium halide and carrier gas with defined moisture<br>
content, b = hydrogen, c = air, d = steam, e = secondary<br>
air, f = steam or steam/air. Fig. 1B shows a section of<br>
the arrangement of Fig. 1A. In this, the steam (d)<br>
together with the air (c) are introduced into the mixing<br>
chamber. Fig. 1C shows an open reaction chamber in which<br>
the secondary air e is aspirated from the surroundings.<br>
With the arrangement according to Fig. 1C no titanium<br>
dioxide powder according to the invention can be obtained.<br>
The invention also provides for the use of the titanium<br>
dioxide powder according to the invention for the heat<br>
protection stabilisation of silicones.<br><br>
The invention in addition provides for the use of the<br>
titanium dioxide powder according to the invention in<br>
sunscreen agents.<br>
The invention furthermore provides for the use of the<br>
titanium dioxide powder according to the invention as a<br>
catalyst, as a catalyst carrier, as a photocatalyst, and as<br>
an abrasive for the production of dispersions.<br><br>

160 kg/hr of TiCl4 are vapourised in an evaporator at 140°C.<br>
The vapours are transferred to a mixing chamber by means of<br>
nitrogen (15 Nm3/hr) as carrier gas with a carrier gas<br>
moisture content of 15 g/m3 of carrier gas. Separately from<br>
this, 52 Nm3/hr of hydrogen and 525 Nm3/hr of primary air<br>
are introduced into the mixing chamber. In a central tube<br>
the reaction mixture is fed to a burner and ignited. The<br>
flame burns in a water-cooled flame tube. In addition<br>
200 Nm3/hr of secondary air are added to the reaction space.<br>
The powder formed is separated in a downstream filter and<br>
then treated in countercurrent with air and steam at 520°C.<br>
The Examples A2 to A9 according to the invention are<br>
carried out similarly to A1. The parameters altered in<br>
each case are listed in Table 1.<br>
The physicochemical data of the powders from Examples Al to<br>
A9 are shown in Table 2.<br>
The comparison examples B1 to B3 and B5 to B8 are also<br>
carried out similarly to A1. The parameters altered in<br>
each case are listed in Table 1.<br>
The comparison example B4 is carried out using an open<br>
burner. The amount of secondary air is not determined.<br>
The physicochemical data of the powders from Examples Bl to<br>
B8 are shown in Table 2.<br>
Table 3 shows calculated half-width values of the primary<br>
particles depending on the BET surface with f = -1.0,<br>
-1.05, -1.15 and -1.3. The factor 10-9 serves for the<br>
conversion from metres into nanometres. Since the factor f<br><br>
can assume only negative values, the unit of BETf can<br>
be g/m2.<br>
Fig. 2 shows the half width of the primary particles of the<br>
titanium dioxide powders produced in the examples. In this<br>
connection the titanium dioxide powders according to the<br>
invention (identified as ■) lie within the claimed half<br>
width HW [nm] = a x BETf where a = 670x10-9 m3/g and<br>
-1.3 ≤ f ≤ -1.0, while the comparison examples (identified<br>
by +) lie outside.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Heat stabilisation of polymers<br>
Example C1: without titanium dioxide powder (comparison<br>
example)<br>
A two-component silicone rubber from Bayer, trade name<br>
Silopren® LSR 2040, is used as base component (addition<br>
crosslinking). After homogeneously mixing the two<br>
components with a dissolver the vulcanisation takes place<br>
at 180 °C for 10 minutes. Sample plates (ca. 10 x 15 cm)<br>
6 mm thick are produced. The sample plates are heated at<br>
80 °C in a furnace to constant weight (ca. 1 day). To<br>
check the thermal stability a hot storage test is carried<br>
out. For this, a sample strip of size 5 x 7 cm is kept in<br>
a circulating air oven at 275 °C. The weight loss is<br>
measured.<br><br>
Example C2: Addition of titanium dioxide powder according<br>
to the prior art (comparison example)<br>
A two-component silicone rubber from Bayer, trade name<br>
Silopren® LSR 2040, is used as base component (addition<br>
crosslinking). 1.5 wt.%, referred to the total batch, of<br>
titanium dioxide powder P 25 S (Degussa AG) is incorporated<br>
for 5 minutes into one of the components, using a<br>
dissolver. Following this the vulcanisation and production<br>
of the sample plates take place as described in Example 1.<br>
Sample strips of size 5 x 7 cm are stored at 275 °C. The<br>
weight loss is measured.<br>
The Examples C3-5 are carried out similarly to C1, but<br>
using the titanium dioxide powders A1 according to the<br>
invention in C3, A3 in C4 and A7 in C5, instead of P25 S.<br>
Table 4 shows the length changes of the samples stored at<br>
275°C for 1, 3 and 7 days. The results demonstrate the<br>
effective heat protection stabilisation of polymers<br>
achieved by using the titanium dioxide powder according to<br>
the invention.<br><br><br>
Photocatalytic activity<br>
Example D1: Titanium dioxide powder according to the prior<br>
art (comparison example)<br>
To determine the photocatalytic activity the sample to be<br>
measured is suspended in 2-propanol and irradiated for one<br>
hour with UV light. The concentration of acetone formed is<br>
then measured.<br>
Ca. 250 mg (accuracy 0.1 mg) of titanium dioxide powder<br>
P 25S (Degussa AG) are suspended using an Ultra-Turrax<br>
stirrer in 350 ml (275.1 g) of 2-propanol. This suspension<br>
is conveyed by means of a pump through a cooler<br>
thermostatically controlled to 24°C to a glass photoreactor<br>
equipped with a radiation source and flushed beforehand<br>
with oxygen. An Hg medium-pressure immersion lamp of the<br>
type TQ718 (Heraeus) with an output of 500 Watts serves for<br>
example as radiation source. A protective tube of<br>
borosilicate glass restricts the emitted radiation to<br>
wavelengths &gt;300nm. The radiation source is surrounded<br>
externally by a cooling tube through which water flows.<br>
Oxygen is metered into the reactor via a flow meter. The<br>
reaction is started when the radiation source is switched<br>
on. At the end of the reaction a small amount of the<br>
suspension is immediately removed, filtered, and analysed<br>
by gas chromatography.<br>
A photoactivity k of 0.68 x 10-3 mole kg-1min-1 is measured.<br>
This is taken as base value 1. The titanium dioxide powder<br>
according to the invention has a somewhat lower<br>
photocatalytic activity of 0.8 to 0.9.<br><br>
