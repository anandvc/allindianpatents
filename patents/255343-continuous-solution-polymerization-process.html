				<td>OLEFIN POLYMERIZATION CATALYST SYSTEM AND PROCESS<br>
FOR USE THEREOF<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001]	This invention relates to novel transition metal compounds and to<br>
processes to polymerize or oligomerize unsaturated monomers using these transition metal compounds and polymers or oligomers produced therefrom.<br>
Background of the Invention.<br>
[0002]	Various processes and catalysts exist for the homopolymerization<br>
or copolymerization of unsaturated monomers, particularly the polymerization of olefms. For many applications, it is desirable for a polyolefin to have a high weight average molecular weight while having a relatively narrow molecular weight distribution. Chiral bis-indenyl metallocene catalysts have been used to prepare highly crystalline isotatic polypropylene and copolymers of propylene and other monomers (Resconi, L. Chem. Rev. 2000, 100, 1253). Non-chiral metallocene catalysts have also been prepared which yield atactic polypropylene and copolymers (Resconi, L. in Metallocene Based Polyolefins, Eds. J. Schiers, W. Kaminsky; Wiley; NY, 2000; 467). While, there are chiral catalysts which operate between these extremes, yielding polypropylene with crystallinity less than highly crystalline and more than amorphous, generally these chiral catalysts give low molecular weight polymer. This is also true for copolymers prepared from propylene and other monomers, using such systems.<br>
[0003]	US 6,051,522 describes bridged chiral metallocenes as catalysts<br>
useful for olefm polymerization. WO2002/01745, US 2002/0004575Al, WO2002/083753A1, and US 6,525,157 disclose processes for the preparation of a propylene/ethylene copolymer containing tacticity within the propylene sequences using the chiral metallocene rac-Me2Si(l-indenyl)2HfMe2 and an ionizing activator. US 6,057,408 discloses a process for the preparation of high molecular weight propylene/ethylene copolymers with high crystallinity in the propylene sequences using chiral bis-indenyl metallocenes. The catalyst that yielded the<br><br>
highest molecular weight copolymer was rac-Me2Si(2-Me-4-(l-napthyl)-l-indenyl) 2ZrCl2.<br>
[0004]	S. Collins and coworkers reported (Organometallics 1992, 11,<br>
2115) a study of the effect of substituents in the 5,6-positions on a series of chiral<br>
ethylene bridged metallocenes, rac-(CH2CH2)(5,6-X2-l-indenyl)2ZrCl2, on<br>
solution ethylene and propylene polymerizations. In comparing X= H and X =<br>
Me, similar molecular weights were found for the preparation of polyethylene (X<br>
= H, Mn = 145 Kg/mol; X = Me, Mn = 127 Kg/mol) and polypropylene (X = H,<br>
Mn - 15.7 Kg/mol; X = Me, Mn = 16 Kg/mol).   Likewise, In US 5,455,365,<br>
chiral bis-indenyl metallocenes containing methyl groups in the 5 and 6 positions<br>
and metallocenes containing a phenyl group in the 5 or 6 position are disclosed.<br>
Polymerizations at 70 °C in liquid propylene gave moderately crystalline<br>
polypropylene, as evidenced by polymer melting points between 132 and 147 °C.<br>
The molecular weights (Mw) of these materials are between 100 and 200 Kg/mol.<br>
Copolymerization of propylene with ethylene, using rac-Me2Si(2,5,6-Me3-l-<br>
indenyl)ZrCl2/MAO, yielded a 2.8 wt % ethylene, 97.2 wt % propylene copolymer<br>
with a significantly lower molecular weight as evidenced by a drop in intrinsic<br>
viscosity from 155 mL/g (Mw = 143 Kg/mol) to 98 mL/g (Mw not recorded).<br>
This copolymerization also gave a decrease in melting point from 132 to 123 °C.<br>
[0005]	In US 6,084,115, a chiral bis-indenyl metallocene containing an<br>
annulated tetramethylated cyclohexyl ring attached at the 5 and 6 positions is disclosed. This metallocene, rac -Me2.Si(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2,5,5,8,8-pentaniethyl-benz[fjindenyl)2Zr(l,4-diphenylbutadiene), is reported to be in the +2 oxidation state. Propylene polymerization behavior was reported in alkane solution (24 wt % propylene) under a partial pressure of hydrogen at 70°C. Molecular weights obtained were ca. 60 Kg/mol and polymer melting points were 144.8-147 °C. These molecular weights were lower than the analogous complex with H in the 5 and 6 positions , rac -Me2Si(2-Me-l-indenyl)Zr(l,4-diphenylbutadiene), Mw = 79 Kg/mol. Similar results observed in ethylene/octene polymerizations with these two catalysts. No H2-free solution polymerizations were reported. Supported catalysts were also examined in this patent, however broad molecular weight distributions (&gt; 3.5) make comparisons between catalysts difficult. These results<br><br>
indicate that a molecular weight advantage is not expected for catalysts with large<br>
groups in the 5 and 6 positions. Thus, no meaningful increase in polymer<br>
molecular weight can be ascribed to these previous substitutions.<br>
[0006]	WO 2004/050724 discloses polymerization of butene with<br>
methylalumoxane and dimethylsilyl bis[2-methyl-5,6(tetramethyl-<br>
cyclotrimethylen)indenyl]zirconium dichloride and also described certain indenyl<br>
type compounds with annulated six membered rings; however, WO 2004/050724<br>
does not obtain higher molecular weights at higher temperatures.<br>
[0007]	Thus there is a need in the art to provide catalyst systems that can<br>
provide polymers having high molecular weight as well as good crystallinity preferably prepared at higher temperatures and productivities than otherwise possible.<br>
[0008]	US 6,479,424 discloses the preparation of unbridged species bis(2-<br>
(3,5-di-t-butylphenyl)-5,5,8,8-tetramethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobenz(f)indenyl)<br>
hafnium dichloride, bis(2-(3,5-di-t-butylphenyl)-5s5,8,8-tetramethyl-5,6,7,8-<br>
tetrahydrobenz(f)indenyl) zirconium dichloride, bis(2-(4-t-butylphenyl)-5,5,8,8-<br>
tetramethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobenz(f)indenyl) hafnium dichloride, and bis(2-(4-t-<br>
butylphenyl)-5,5,8,8-tetramethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobenz(f)indenyl) zirconium<br>
dichloride which are used to produce propylene polymers.<br>
[0009]	Other references of interest include: 1) US 6,034,022, (particularly<br>
example 17); 2) US 6,268,444, (particularly example 2); 3) US 6,469,188; and 4) EP 1 138 687, (particularly examples 8 and 9).<br>
[0010]	Further, there is a need in the art to provide processes to produce<br>
propylene based polymers having higher molecular weights at higher temperatures, preferably in solution processes. Likewise, there is a need in the art to provide processes to produce propylene based polymers having higher molecular weights at higher temperatures in solution processes using a non-coordinating anion activator, where the propylene concentration in the feed is lower.<br><br>

[0012]	This invention further relates to a process to polymerize<br>
unsaturated monomers using the above compositions, optionally combined with an activator.<br>
Detailed Description<br>
[0013]	This invention relates to a new class of catalyst compounds that<br>
may be combined with one or more activators to polymerize any unsaturated monomer.<br>
[0014]	For the purposes of this invention and the claims thereto when a<br>
polymer is referred to as comprising a monomer, the monomer present in the polymer is the polymerized form of the monomer. For the purposes of this invention and the claims thereto when a polymer is referred to as comprising an olefm, the olefm present in the polymer is the polymerized form of the olefin. In the description herein the transition metal catalyst compound may be described as a catalyst precursor, a pre-catalyst compound, a transition metal complex or a catalyst compound, and these terms are used interchangeably. A catalyst system is<br><br>
a combination of a transition metal catalyst compound and an activator. An activator is also interchangeably referred to as a cocatalyst.   In addition, a reactor is any container(s) in which a chemical reaction occurs.<br>
[0015]	As used herein, the numbering scheme for the Periodic Table<br>
Groups is the new notation as set out in CHEMICAL AND ENGINEERING NEWS, 63(5), 27 (1985).<br>
[0016]	Further for purposes of this invention Me is methyl, Ph is phenyl,<br>
Et is ethyl, Pr is propyl, iPr is isopropyl, n-Pr is normal propyl, Bu is butyl, iBu is isobutyl, tBu is tertiary butyl, p-tBu is para-tertiary butyl, Ph is phenyl, and TMS is trimethylsilyl.<br>
[0017]	This invention relates to the preparation of polyolefins in solution,<br>
slurry or gas phase processes using chiral metallocenes containing specifically substituted indenyl ligands, (such as those represented by Formula 1 above), in combination with an activator and optionally an additional cocatalyst. m one embodiment of this invention, polyalpha-olefins are prepared. In another embodiment, olefin copolymers, substantially free of diene are prepared. In a preferred embodiment of this invention, polypropylene with intermediate crystallinity and high molecular weight is prepared (intermediate crystallinity is defined to be having a percent crystallinity of 15 to 35% as measured by DSC procedure described below and high molecular weight is defined to be an Mw above 100,000 as measured by GPC using polystyrene standards). Such polymers are preferably for use in applications such as plasticizer and lubricant formulations, hot melt adhesive applications, coatings, seals, insulation, molding compositions or sound insulating materials. Another preferred embodiment of this invention is the preparation of propylene/ethylene copolymers containing tacticity within the propylene sequences as described in WO2002/01745, US 2002/0004575Al, WO2002/083753A1, US 6525157B2. Such propylene/ethylene copolymers have utility as thermoplastic elastomers, impact modifiers, compatibilizers in thermoplastic polyolefins, elastic fibers and films, dynamically vulcanizable alloys, curable elastomers, adhesives, PVC replacements and viscosity modifiers. Also, blends of such copolymers with polypropylene, upon orientation give significantly enhanced elastic recovery and tensile strength.<br><br>
Preferred catalyst systems comprising a metallocene represented by Formula 1, an<br>
activator and optionally an additional cocatalyst are particularly suited for<br>
preparing polyolefins of high molecular weight at industrially useful temperatures.<br>
[0018]	Differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) trace data is obtained<br>
using a TA Instruments model 2920 machine. Samples weighing approximately<br>
7-10 mg are sealed in aluminum sample pans. The DSC data are recorded by first<br>
cooling the sample to -50 °C and then gradually heating it to 200 °C at a rate of 10<br>
°C/minute. The sample is kept at 200 °C for 5 minutes before a second cooling-<br>
heating cycle is applied. Both the first and second cycle thermal events are<br>
recorded. Areas under the melting curves are measured and used to determine the<br>
heat of fusion and the degree of crystallinity. The percent crystallinity is<br>
calculated using the formula, [area under the curve (Joules/gram) / B<br>
(Joules/gram)] * 100, where B is the heat of fusion for the homopolymer of the<br>
major monomer component. These values for B are to be obtained from the<br>
Polymer Handbook, Fourth Edition, published by John Wiley and Sons, New<br>
York 1999. A value of 189 J/g (B) is used as the heat effusion for polypropylene.<br>
[0019]	This invention further relates to processes for preparing oligomers<br>
and/or polymers of unsaturated monomers, such as polar monomers and or olefins comprising contacting a transition metal compound (as described herein) and, optionally, an activator with the monomers. This invention also relates to a process for the preparation of olefin polymers and copolymers using metallocenes containing specifically substituted indenyl ligands as represented in Formula 1:<br>

Activators and Activation Methods for Catalyst Compounds<br>
[0040]	The bridged metallocene compounds according to this invention<br>
may be activated for polymerization catalysis in any mariner sufficient to allow coordination or cationic polymerization. This can be achieved for coordination polymerization when one ligand can be abstracted and another will either allow insertion of the unsaturated monomers or will be similarly abstractable for replacement with a ligand that allows insertion of the unsaturated monomer (labile ligands), eg. alkyl, silyl or hydride. The traditional activators of coordination polymerization art are suitable, those typically include Lewis acids such as alumoxane compounds, and ionizing, anion precursor compounds that abstract one so as to ionize the bridged metallocene metal center in to a cation and provide a counterbalancing noncoordianting ion.<br>
[0041]	Alkylalumoxanes and modified alkylalumoxane are suitable as<br>
catalyst activators, particularly for the invention metal compounds where R1 = halide or other functional group. Alkylalumoxanes and modified alkylalumoxane<br><br>
are also suitable as catalyst for the invention metal compounds where R1 = hydrocarbyl or substituted hydrocarbyl. In one embodiment, one or more alumoxanes are utilized as an activator in the catalyst composition of the invention. Alumoxanes, sometimes called aluminoxanes in the art, are generally oligomeric compounds containing -A1(R)-O- subunits, where R is an alkyl group. Examples of alumoxanes include methylalumoxane (MAO), modified methylalumoxane (MMAO), ethylalumoxane and isobutylalumoxane. Alkylalumoxanes and modified alkylalumoxanes are suitable as catalyst activators, particularly when the abstractable ligand is a halide. Mixtures of different alumoxanes and modified alumoxanes may also be used. For further descriptions, see U.S. Patents 4,665,208, 4,952,540, 5,041,584, 5,091,352, 5,206,199, 5,204,419, 4,874,734, 4,924,018,4,908,463, 4,968,827, 5,329,032, 5,248,801, 5,235,081, 5,157,137, 5,103,031 and EP 0 561 476 Al, EP 0 279 586 Bl, EP 0 516 476 A, EP 0 594 218 Al and WO 94/10180.<br>
[0042]	When the activator is an alumoxane (modified or unmodified),<br>
some embodiments select the maximum amount of activator at a 5000-fold molar<br>
excess Al/M over the catalyst precursor (per metal catalytic site). The minimum<br>
activator-to-catalyst-precursor is typically a 1:1 molar ratio.<br>
[0043]	Alumoxanes may be produced by the hydrolysis of the respective<br>
trialkylaluminum compound. MMAO may be produced by the hydrolysis of trimethylaluminum and a higher trialkylaluminum such as triisobutylaluminum. MMAO's are generally more soluble in aliphatic solvents and more stable during storage. There are a variety of methods for preparing alumoxane and modified alumoxanes, non-limiting examples of which are described in U.S. Patent No. 4,665,208, 4,952,540, 5,091,352, 5,206,199, 5,204,419, 4,874,734, 4,924,018, 4,908,463, 4,968,827, 5,308,815, 5,329,032, 5,248,801, 5,235,081, 5,157,137, 5,103,031, 5,391,793, 5,391,529, 5,693,838, 5,731,253, 5,731,451, 5,744,656, 5,847,177, 5,854,166, 5,856,256 and 5,939,346 and European publications EP-A-0 561 476, EP-B1-0 279 586, EP-A-0 594-218 and EP-B1-0 586 665, and PCT publications WO 94/10180 and WO 99/15534, all of which are herein fully incorporated by reference.   It may be preferable to use a visually clear<br><br>
methylalumoxane. A cloudy or gelled alumoxane can be filtered to produce a clear solution or clear alumoxane can be decanted from the cloudy solution. Another preferred alumoxane is a modified methyl alumoxane (MMAO) cocatalyst type 3A (commercially available from Akzo Chemicals, Inc. under the trade name Modified Methylalumoxane type 3A, covered under patent number US 5,041,584).<br>
[0044]        •     Aluminum alkyl or organoaluminum compounds which may be utilized as activators (or scavengers) include trimethylaluminum, triethylaluminum, triisobutylaluminum, tri-n-hexylaluminum, tri-n-octylaluminum and the like.<br>

[0058]	The term "non-coordinating anion" (NCA) means an anion which<br>
either does not coordinate to said cation or which is only weakly coordinated to<br>
said cation thereby remaining sufficiently labile to be displaced by a neutral Lewis<br>
base. "Compatible" non-coordinating anions are those which are not degraded to<br>
neutrality when the initially formed complex decomposes. Non-coordinating<br>
anions useful in accordance with this invention are those that are compatible,<br>
stabilize the metal cation in the sense of balancing its ionic charge, yet retain<br>
sufficient lability to permit displacement by an ethylenically or acetylenically<br>
unsaturated monomer during polymerization. These types of cocatalysts<br>
sometimes use tri-isobutyl aluminum or tri-octyl aluminum as a scavenger.<br>
[0059]	Invention process also can employ cocatalyst compounds or<br>
activator compounds that are initially neutral Lewis acids but form a cationic<br>
metal complex and a noncoordinating anion, or a zwitterionic complex upon<br>
reaction with the invention compounds. For example, tris(pentafluorophenyl)<br>
boron or aluminum act to abstract a hydrocarbyl or hydride ligand to yield an<br>
invention cationic metal complex and stabilizing noncoordinating anion, see EP-<br>
A-0 427 697 and EP-A-0 520 732 for illustrations of analogous Group-4<br>
metallocene compounds. Also, see the methods and compounds of EP-A-0 495<br>
375. For formation of zwitterionic complexes using analogous Group 4<br>
compounds, see U.S. Patents 5,624,878; 5,486,632; and 5,527,929.<br>
[0060]	Additional neutral Lewis-acids are known in the art and are suitable<br>
for abstracting amonic ligands. See in particular the review article by E. Y.-X. Chen and T.J. Marks, "Cocatalysts for Metal-Catalyzed Olefin Polymerization:<br><br>
Activators, Activation Processes, and Structure-Activity Relationships", Chem. Rev., 100, 1391-1434(2000).<br>
[0061]	When R1 is a functional group ligand, such as chloride, amido or<br>
alkoxy ligands, and the functional group ligands are not capable of discrete ionizing abstraction with the ionizing, anion pre-cursor compounds, these functional group ligands can be converted via known alkylation reactions with organometallic compounds such as lithium or aluminum hydrides or alkyls, alkylalumoxanes, Grignard reagents, etc. See EP-A-0 500 944, EP-A1-0 570 982 and EP-A1-0 612 768 for analogous processes describing the reaction of alkyl aluminum compounds with analogous dihalide substituted metallocene compounds prior to or with the addition of activating noncoordinating anion precursor compounds.<br>
[0062]	When the cations of noncoordinating anion precursors are Bronsted<br>
acids such as protons or protonated Lewis bases (excluding water), or reducible Lewis acids such as ferrocenium or silver cations, or alkali or alkaline earth metal cations such as those of sodium, magnesium or lithium, the catalyst-precursor-to-activator molar ratio may be any ratio. Combinations of the described activator compounds may also be used for activation. For example, tris(perfluorophenyl) boron can be used with methylalumoxane.<br>
[0063]	In general the combined metal compounds and the activator are<br>
combined in ratios of about 1000:1 to about 0.5:1. hi a preferred embodiment the metal compounds and the activator are combined in a ratio of about 300:1 to about 1:1, preferably about 150:1 to about 1:1, for boranes, borates, aluminates, etc. the ratio is preferably about 1:1 to about 10:1 and for alkyl aluminum compounds (such as diethylaluminum chloride combined with water) the ratio is preferably about 0.5:1 to about 10:1.<br>

It is recognized to one skilled in the art that the use of polar monomers in polymerization processes require the use of Lewis-acid cocatalysts, such as alkyl aluminum compounds, or an alternative protection method to effect polymerization (Boffa, L.S.; Novak, B.M. Chem. Rev. 2000, 1479 and references therein).<br>
[0076]	For purposes of this invention and the claims thereto, the term<br>
oligomer refers to compositions having 2-75 mer units and the term polymer refers to compositions having 76 or more mer units. A mer is defined as a unit of<br><br>
an oligorner or polymer that originally corresponded to the olefin(s) used in the<br>
oligomerization or polymerization reaction. For example, the mer of polyethylene<br>
would be ethylene.<br>
[0077]	In an embodiment herein, the process described herein is used to<br>
produce an oligomer of any of the monomers listed above. Preferred oligomers include oligomers of any €2 to €30 olefins, preferably Ca to Cu alpha-olefins, most preferably oligomers comprising ethylene, propylene and or butene are prepared.  A preferred feedstock for the oligomerization process is the alpha-olefln, ethylene. But other alpha-olefins, including but not limited to propylene and 1-butene, may also be used alone or combined with ethylene. Preferred alpha-olefins include any €2 to C4o alpha-olefin, preferably and C?. to C2o alpha-olefin, preferably any €2 to Cu alpha-olefin, preferably ethylene, propylene, and butene, most preferably ethylene. Dienes may be used in the processes described herein, preferably alpha, omega-dienes are used alone or in combination with mono-alpha olefins.<br>
Polymerization Processes<br>
[0078]	A preferred polymerization is a single stage, steady state,<br>
polymerization conducted in a well-mixed continuous feed polymerization reactor. The polymerization can be conducted in solution, although other polymerization procedures such as gas phase or slurry polymerization, which fulfill the requirements of single stage polymerization and continuous feed reactors, can also be used. The process can be described as a continuous, non-batch process that, in its steady state operation, is exemplified by removal of amounts of polymer made per unit time, being substantially equal to the amount of polymer withdrawn from the reaction vessel per unit time. By "substantially equal" we intend that these amounts, polymer made per unit time, and polymer withdrawn per unit time, are in ratios of one to other, of from 0.9:1; or 0.95:1; or 0.97:1; or 1:1. hi such a reactor, there is preferably a substantially homogeneous monomer distribution. At the same time, the polymerization is accomplished in substantially single step or stage or in a single reactor, as contrasted to multistage or multiple reactors (two or<br><br>
more). Multiple reactors where each of the above of reactors is of this description are also useful herein.<br>
[0079]	A preferred method of making polymer using the polymerization<br>
catalysts described herein comprise the following steps: a) feeding solvent and a set of monomers in predetermined proportions to a polymerization reactor, b) adding a soluble metallocene catalyst to said reactor, c) polymerizing the set of monomers in solution to produce an effluent containing a polymer wherein the first and second set of monomers are chosen from the group propylene, ethylene, alpha-olefin, non-conjugated diene. Likewise Polymers may be made by solution polymerization in a train of at least two continuous flow stirred tank reactors (CFSTR) connected in series with the addition of a metallocene catalyst. Each reactor should be capable of being fed independently with monomer and solvent, hi order to remove polar compounds that act as catalyst poisons, all solvent and monomer feeds are desirably purified over mole sieves, alumina beds, or other absorbents as known in the art. Heat removal from the reactor is by methods well known in the art such as auto-refrigeration, feed prechilling (adiabatic reactors), cooling coils, or various combinations of these techniques. Adiabatic reactors with prechilled feeds are preferred. Pressure is preferably sufficient to keep the reactor contents in solution at the reactor temperature. Polymerization may be carried out at temperatures in the range of -20°C or lower to 200 °C or higher, and preferably, at 0 °C to 160 °C. Most preferably polymerization is conducted in a range of 55 °C to 140 °C. The residence time per reactor is maintained at 1 to 180 minutes and preferably at 5 to 30 minutes. The polymer concentration in the effluent of the reactors is maintained in the range of 1 to 20% by weight and more preferably between 3 to 12 % by weight. The overall polymerization rate is set by the catalyst and monomer feed rates. Polymer composition is controlled by adjusting the monomer feed rate to a reactor. Polymer molecular weight is set by choosing the reactor temperature, (MW decreases with temperature increases), monomer concentration (MW increases with increasing monomer concentration), and by optionally adding chain transfer agents such as hydrogen. The polymer product can be conventionally recovered from the effluent by coagulation with a nonsolvent such as isopropyl alcohol, acetone, or n- butyl alcohol, or the polymer<br><br>
can be recovered by stripping the solvent or other media with heat or steam. One or more conventional additives such as antioxidants can be incorporated in the polymer during the recovery procedure. Useful antioxidants include phenyl-beta-naphthylamine, di-tert- butylhydroquinone, triphenyl phosphate, heptylated diphenylamine, 2,2'-m ethyl ene-b is (4- methyl-6- tert-butyl)phenol, and 2,2,4-trimethyl-6-phenyl-1,2-dihydroquinoline.<br>
[0080]	Polymerization may be conducted by any of the polymerization<br>
procedures known in the art, however, in a preferred embodiment the polymerization is conducted in a solution polymerization under conditions where the components are completely in solution. These polymerization conditions are obtained by the choice of a solvent, in sufficient quantity, common to both of the polymeric components as the polymerization medium at suitable reaction conditions, including temperature and pressure, such that all of the components of the polymer mixture are maintained in solution. Solvents useful in this invention include hydrocarbons such as aliphatics, cycloalphatics, and aromatic hydrocarbons. Preferred solvents are C12 or lower straight-chain or branched-chain, saturated hydrocarbons, and C5 to C9 saturated alicyclic or aromatic hydrocarbons. Examples of such solvents or reaction media are hexane, butane, pentane, heptane, cyclopentane, cyclohexane, cycloheptane, methyl cyclopentane, methyl cyclohexane, isooctane, benzene, toluene, xylene, with hexane being preferred.<br>
[0081]	Typically one or more transition metal compounds, one or more •<br>
activators, and one or more monomers are contacted to produce polymer. The components may be contacted in a solution, bulk, gas or slurry polymerization process or a combination thereof, preferably solution phase or bulk phase polymerization process.<br>
[0082]	In general the transition metal compound and the activator are<br>
combined in ratios of about 1:10,000 to about 1:1, in other embodiments the combined transition metal compounds and the activator are combined in ratios of 1:1 to 100:1. When alumoxane or aluminum alkyl activators are used, the combined pre-catalyst-to-activator molar ratio is from 1:5000 to 10:1, alternatively from 1:1000 to 10:1; alternatively, 1:500 to 2:1; or 1:300 to 1:1. When ionizing<br><br>
activators are used, the combined pre-catalyst-to-activator molar ratio is from 10:1 to 1:10; 5:1 to 1:5; 2:1 to 1:2; or 1.2:1 to 1:1. Multiple activators may be used, including using mixtures of alumoxanes or aluminum alkyls with ionizing activators.<br>
[0083]	One or more reactors in series or in parallel may be used in the<br>
present invention. Catalyst component and activator may be delivered as a<br>
solution or slurry, either separately to the reactor, activated in-line just prior to the<br>
reactor, or preactivated and pumped as an activated solution or slurry to the<br>
reactor. A preferred operation is two solutions activated in-line. Polymerizations<br>
are carried out in either single reactor operation, in which monomer, comonomers,<br>
catalyst/activator, scavenger, and optional modifiers are added continuously to a<br>
single reactor or in series reactor operation, in which the above components are<br>
added to each of two or more reactors connected in series. The catalyst<br>
components can be added to the first reactor in the series. The catalyst component<br>
may also be added to both reactors, with one component being added to first<br>
reaction and another component to other reactors.<br>
[0084]	Ethylene-alpha-olefin (including ethylene-cyclic olefin and<br>
ethylene-alpha -olefin-diolefin) polymers of high molecular weight and low crystallinity can be prepared utilizing the catalysts of the invention under traditional solution processes or by introducing ethylene gas into a slurry utilizing the alpha-olefin or cyclic olefin or mixture thereof with other monomers, polymerizable and not, as a polymerization diluent in which the catalyst suspension is suspended. Typical ethylene pressures will be between 10 and 1000 psig (69-6895 kPa) and the polymerization diluent temperature will typically be between -10 and 160 °C. The process can be carried out in a stirred tank reactor or a tubular reactor, or more than one reactor operated in series or in parallel. See the general disclosure of U.S. patent 5,001,205 for general process conditions. All documents are incorporated by reference for description of polymerization processes, ionic activators and useful scavenging compounds.<br><br>
Gas Phase Polymerization<br>
[0085]	The catalyst compounds described herein may be used in gas phase<br>
polymerization processes. Generally, in a fluidized gas bed process used for producing polymers, a gaseous stream containing one or more monomers is continuously cycled through a fluidized bed in the presence of a catalyst under reactive conditions. The gaseous stream is withdrawn from the fluidized bed and recycled back into the reactor. Simultaneously, polymer product is withdrawn from the reactor and fresh monomer is added to replace the polymerized monomer. (See for example U.S. Patent Nos. 4,543,399, 4,588,790, 5,028,670, 5,317,036, 5,352,749, 5,405,922, 5,436,304, 5,453,471, 5,462,999, 5,616,661 and 5,668,228 all of which are fully incorporated herein by reference.) The reactor pressure in a gas phase process may vary from about 10 psig (69 kPa) to about 500 psig (3448 kPa), preferably from about 100 psig (690 kPa) to about 500 psig (3448 kPa), preferably in the range of from about 200 psig (1379 kPa) to about 400 psig (2759 kPa), more preferably in the range of from about 250 psig (1724 kPa) to about 350 psig (2414 kPa). The reactor temperature in the gas phase process may vary from about 30°C to about 120°C, preferably from about 60°C to about 115°C, more preferably in the range of from about 70°C to 110°C, and most preferably in the range of from about 70°C to about 95 °C. In another embodiment when high density polyethylene is desired then the reactor temperature is typically between 70 and 105 °C.<br>
[0086]	The productivity of the catalyst or catalyst system in a gas phase<br>
system is influenced by the partial pressure of the main monomer. The preferred<br>
mole percent of the main monomer, ethylene or propylene, preferably ethylene, is<br>
from about 25 to 90 mole percent and the comonomer partial pressure is in the<br>
range of from about 138 kPa to about 517kPa, preferably about 517 kPa to about<br>
2069 kPa, which are typical conditions in a gas phase polymerization process.<br>
Also in some systems the presence of comonomer can increase productivity.<br>
[0087]	In a preferred embodiment, the reactor utilized in the present<br>
invention is capable of producing more than 500 Ibs of polymer per hour (227 Kg/hr) to about 200,000 Ibs/hr (90,900 Kg/hr) or higher, preferably greater than 1000 Ibs/hr (455 Kg/hr), more preferably greater than 10,000 Ibs/hr (4540 Kg/hr),<br><br>
even more preferably greater than 25,000 Ibs/hr (11,300 Kg/hr), still more preferably greater than 35,000 Ibs/hr (15,900 Kg/hr), still even more preferably greater than 50,000 Ibs/hr (22,700 Kg/hr) and preferably greater than 65,000 Ibs/hr (29,000 Kg/hr) to greater than 100,000 Ibs/hr (45,500 Kg/hr), and most preferably over 100,000 Ibs/hr (45,500 Kg/hr).<br>
[0088]	Other gas phase processes contemplated by the process of the<br>
invention include those described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,627,242, 5,665,818 and<br>
5,677,375, and European publications EP-A- 0 794 200, EP-A- 0 802 202 and EP-<br>
B- 634 421 all of which are herein fully incorporated by reference.<br>
[0089]	In another preferred embodiment the catalyst system in is liquid<br>
form and is introduced into the gas phase reactor into a resin particle lean zone. For information on how to introduce a liquid catalyst system into a fluidized bed polymerization into a particle lean zone, please see US 5,693,727, which is incorporated by reference herein.<br>
Slurry Phase Polymerization<br>
[0090]	The catalyst compounds described herein may be used in slurry<br>
phase polymerization processes. A slurry polymerization process generally operates between 1 to about 50 atmosphere pressure range (15 psi to 735 psi, 103 kPa to 5068 kPa) or even greater and temperatures in the range of 0°C to about 120°C. In a slurry polymerization, a suspension of solid, particulate polymer is formed in a liquid polymerization diluent medium to which monomer and comonomers along with catalyst are added. The suspension including diluent is intermittently or continuously removed from the reactor where the volatile components are separated from the polymer and recycled, optionally after a distillation, to the reactor. The liquid diluent employed in the polymerization medium is typically an alkane having from 3 to 7 carbon atoms, preferably a branched alkane. The medium employed should be liquid under the conditions of polymerization and relatively inert. When a propane medium is used the process should be operated above the reaction diluent critical temperature and pressure. Preferably, a hexane or an isobutane medium is employed.<br><br>
[0091]	In one embodiment, a preferred polymerization technique useful in<br>
the invention is referred to as a particle form polymerization, or a slurry process<br>
where the temperature is kept below the temperature at which the polymer goes<br>
into solution. Such technique is well known in the art, and described in for<br>
instance U.S. Patent No. 3,248,179 which is folly incorporated herein by<br>
reference. The preferred temperature in the particle form process is within the<br>
range of about 85°C to about 110°C. Two preferred polymerization methods for<br>
the slurry process are those employing a loop reactor and those utilizing a plurality<br>
of stirred reactors in series, parallel, or combinations thereof. Non-limiting<br>
examples of slurry processes include continuous loop or stirred tank processes.<br>
Also, other examples of slurry processes are described in U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,613,484, which is herein fully incorporated by reference.<br>
[0092]	In another embodiment, the slurry process is carried out<br>
continuously in a loop reactor. The catalyst, as a slurry in isobutane or as a dry free flowing powder, is injected regularly to the reactor loop, which is itself filled with circulating slurry of growing polymer particles in a diluent of isobutane containing monomer and comonomer. Hydrogen, optionally, may be added as a molecular weight control. The reactor is maintained at a pressure of 3620 kPa to 4309 kPa and at a temperature in the range of about 60 °C to about 104 °C depending on the desired polymer melting characteristics. Reaction heat is removed through the loop wall since much of the reactor is in the form of a double-jacketed pipe. The slurry is allowed to exit the reactor at regular intervals or continuously to a heated low pressure flash vessel, rotary dryer and a nitrogen purge column in sequence for removal of the isobutane diluent and all unreacted monomer and comonomers. The resulting hydrocarbon free powder is then compounded for use in various applications.<br>
[0093]	In another embodiment, the reactor used in the slurry process of the<br>
invention is capable of and the process of the invention is producing greater than 2000 Ibs of polymer per hour (907 Kg/hr), more preferably greater than 5000 Ibs/hr (2268 Kg/hr), and most preferably greater than 10,000 Ibs/hr (4540 Kg/hr). In another embodiment the slurry reactor used in the process of the invention is<br><br>
producing greater than 15,000 Ibs of polymer per hour (6804 Kg/hr), preferably<br>
greater than 25,000 Ibs/hr (11,340 Kg/hr) to about 100,000 Ibs/hr (45,500 Kg/hr).<br>
[0094]	hi another embodiment in the slurry process of the invention the<br>
total reactor pressure is in the range of from 400 psig (2758 kPa) to 800 psig (5516 kPa), preferably 450 psig (3103 kPa) to about 700 psig (4827 kPa), more preferably 500 psig (3448 kPa) to about 650 psig (4482 kPa), most preferably from about 525 psig (3620 kPa) to 625 psig (4309 kPa).<br>

concentration of predominant monomer in the reactor liquid medium is in the range of from about 1 to 10 weight percent, preferably from about 2 to about 7 weight percent, more preferably from about 2.5 to about 6 weight percent, most preferably from about 3 to about 6 weight percent.<br>
[0096]	Another process of the invention is where the process, preferably a<br>
slurry or gas phase process is operated in the absence of or essentially free of any<br>
scavengers, such as triethylaluminum, trimethylaluminum, tri-isobutylaluminum<br>
and tri-n-hexylaluminum and diethyl aluminum chloride, dibutyl zinc and the like.<br>
This process is described in PCT publication WO 96/08520 and U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,712,352y which are herein fully incorporated by reference.<br>
[0097]	In another embodiment the process is run with scavengers. Typical<br>
scavengers include trimethyl aluminum, tri-isobutyl aluminum and an excess of alumoxane or modified alumoxane.<br>
Homogeneous or Solution Phase Polymerization<br>
[0098]	The catalysts described herein can be used advantageously in<br>
homogeneous and or solution processes. Generally this involves polymerization<br>
in a continuous reactor in which the polymer formed and the starting monomer<br>
and catalyst materials supplied, are agitated to reduce or avoid concentration<br>
gradients. Suitable processes operate above the melting point of the polymers at<br>
high pressures, from 1 to 3000 bar (10-30,000 MPa), in which the monomer acts<br>
as diluent or in solution polymerization using a solvent.<br>
[0099]	Temperature control in the reactor is obtained by balancing the heat<br>
of polymerization and with reactor cooling by reactor jackets or cooling coils to<br><br>
cool the contents of the reactor, auto refrigeration, pre-chilled feeds, vaporization of liquid medium (diluent, monomers or solvent) or combinations of all three. Adiabatic reactors with pre-chilled feeds may also be used. The reactor temperature depends on the catalyst used. In general, the reactor temperature preferably can vary between about 0°C and about 160°C, more preferably from about 10°C to about 140°C, and most preferably from about 40°C to about 120°C. In series operation, the second reactor temperature is preferably higher than the first reactor temperature. In parallel reactor operation, the temperatures of the two reactors are independent. The pressure can vary from about 1 mm Hg to 2500 bar (25,000 MPa), preferably from 0.1 bar to 1600 bar (1-16,000 MPa), most preferably from 1.0 to 500 bar (10-5000MPa).<br>
[00100]	Each of these processes may also be employed in single reactor,<br>
parallel or series reactor configurations. The liquid processes comprise contacting<br>
olefin monomers with the above described catalyst system in a suitable diluent or<br>
solvent and allowing said monomers to react for a sufficient time to produce the<br>
desired polymers. Hydrocarbon solvents are suitable, both aliphatic and aromatic.<br>
Alkanes, such as hexane, pentane, isopentane, and octane, are preferred.<br>
[00101]	The process can be carried out in a continuous stirred tank reactor,<br>
batch reactor or plug flow reactor, or more than one reactor operated in series or parallel. These reactors may have or may not have internal cooling and the monomer feed my or may not be refrigerated. See the general disclosure of U.S. patent 5,001,205 for general process conditions. See also, international application WO 96/33227 and WO 97/22639.<br>
[00102]	In a particularly preferred embodiment, a continuous solution<br>
polymerization process is used with the catalyst compounds of this invention (preferably one or more of dimethylsilyl bis(2-(methyl)-5,5,8,8-tetramethyl-5)6,7,8-tetrahydrobenz(f)indenyl) hafnium dimethyl, diphenylsilyl bis(2-(methyl)-5,5,8,8-tetramethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobenz(f)indenyl) hafnium dimethyl, diphenylsilyl bis(5,5,8,8-tetramethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobenz(f)indenyl) hafnium dimethyl, diphenylsilyl bis(2-(methyl)-5,5,8,8-tetrarnethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobenz(t)indenyl) zirconium dichloride, and cyclo-propylsilyl bis(2-(methyl)-5,5,8,8-tetramethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobenz(f)indenyl) hafnium dimethyl.)<br><br>
to produce copolymers of ethylene/octene or ethylene/propylene or terpolymers of ethylene/propylene/diene, preferably copolymers of propylene and from 1 to 20 weight % ethylene. (By continuous is meant a system that operates (or is intended to operate) without interruption or cessation. For example a continuous process to produce a polymer would be one where the reactants are continually introduced into one or more reactors and polymer product is continually withdrawn.) An organoaluminum compound, namely, tri-n-octylaluminum, may be added as a scavenger to the monomer feed streams prior to introduction into the polymerization process. For production of more crystalline polymers, the catalyst is preferably used in combination with<br>
dimethylaniliniumtetrakis(pentafluorophenyl) borate.   Preferably the solution polymerization is conducted in a single, or optionally in two, continuous stirred tank reactors connected in series with hexane used as the solvent. In addition, toluene maybe added to increase the solubility of the co-catalyst. The feed is transferred to the first reactor where the exothermic polymerization reaction is conducted adiabatically at a reaction temperature between about 50° C to about 220° C. Hydrogen gas may also be added to the reactors as a further molecular weight regulator. If desired, polymer product is then transferred to the second reactor, which is also operated adiabatically at a temperature between about 50° C to 200° C. Additional monomers, solvent, metallocene catalyst, and activators can be fed to the second reactor. The polymer content leaving the second reactor is preferably from 8 to 22 weight percent. A heat exchanger then heats the polymer solution to a temperature of about 220° C. The polymer solution is then brought to a Lower Critical Solution Temperature (LCST) liquid-liquid phase separator which causes the polymer solution to separate into two liquid phases—an upper lean phase and a lower polymer-rich phase. The upper lean phase contains about 70 wt % of the solvent and the lower polymer rich phase contains about 30 wt. % polymer. The polymer solution then enters a low pressure separator vessel which operates at a temperature of about 150° C and a pressure of 4-10 barg (400 to 1000 Pa) and flashes the lower polymer rich phase to remove volatiles and to increase the polymer content to about 76 wt. %. A gear pump at the bottom of the flash vessel drives the polymer rich solution to a List devolatilizer. An extruder is<br><br>
coupled to the end of the List devolatizer whereby the polymer material is transferred to a gear pump which pushes the polymer material through a screen pack. Then the polymer is cut into pellets and fed to a water bath. A spin dryer dries the polymer pellets which have a final solvent content of less than about 0.5 wt. %.<br>
[00103]	In a preferred embodiment, the monomer (preferably propylene) is<br>
present in the feed into the reactor at 50 weight % or less, preferably between 5 and 40 weight%, preferably 5 and 30 weight %, preferably between 5 and 25 weight %, based upon the weight of the feed. Preferably the monomer is combined with a solvent (such as butane, isobutene, pentane, hexane, octane or the like, preferably hexane) just prior to entry into the reactor. In a preferred embodiment, the catalyst system converts at least 20% of the monomer to polymer, preferably at least 30%, preferably at least 35%, preferably at least 40%, preferably at least 50%, based upon the weight of the monomer introduced into the reactor, hi a preferred embodiment, the catalyst system converts at least 20% of the propylene to polypropylene, preferably at least 30%, preferably at least 35%, preferably at least 40%, preferably at least 50%, based upon the weight of the propylene introduced into the reactor.<br>

Propylene Copolymers<br>
[00109]	In another preferred embodiment the polymer produced herein is a<br>
copolymer of propylene and one or more €2 or €4 to €30 linear, branched or cyclic monomers, preferably one or more Ci or €4 to Cia linear, branched or cyclic alpha-olefins. Preferably the polymer produced herein is a copolymer of propylene and one or more of ethylene, butene, pentene, hexene, heptene, octene, nonene, decene, dodecene, 4-methyl-pentene-l, 3-methyl pentene-1, and 3,5,5-trimethyl hexene 1.<br>
[00110]	In another preferred embodiment the polymer produced herein is a<br>
copolymer of propylene and ethylene and optionally one or more €4 to C2o linear, branched or cyclic monomers, preferably one or more €2 or €4 to €12 linear, branched or cyclic alpha-olefins.<br><br>
[00111]	In another preferred embodiment the polymer produced herein is a<br>
copolymer of propylene and ethylene the copolymer includes from a lower limit of<br>
3% or 5% or 6% or 8% or 10% by weight to an upper limit of 20% or 25% by<br>
weight ethylene derived units, and from a lower limit of 75% or 80% by weight to<br>
an upper limit of 95% or 94% or 92% or 90% by weight propylene-derived units,<br>
the percentages by weight based on the total weight of propylene- and ethylene-<br>
derived units. Within these ranges, these copolymers are mildly crystalline as<br>
measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and are exceptionally soft,<br>
while still retaining substantial tensile strength and elasticity. At ethylene<br>
compositions lower than the above limits for the copolymer, such polymers are<br>
generally crystalline, similar to crystalline isotactic polypropylene, and while<br>
having excellent tensile strength, they do not have the favorable softness and<br>
elasticity. At ethylene compositions higher than the above limits for the<br>
copolymer component, the copolymer is substantially amorphous. The ethylene<br>
composition of a polymer is measured as follows. A thin homogeneous film is<br>
pressed at a temperature of about 150°C or greater, then mounted on a Perkin<br>
Elmer PE 1760 infrared spectrophotometer. A full spectrum of the sample from<br>
600 cm"1 to 4000 cm"1 is recorded and the monomer weight percent of ethylene<br>
can be calculated according to the following equation: Ethylene wt % = 82.585 -<br>
111.987X + 30.045 X2, wherein X is the ratio of <he peak height at cm and></he>
peak height at either 722 cm"1 or 732 cm"1, whichever is higher.<br>
[00112]	In one embodiment, the polymer is a random propylene copolymer<br>
having a narrow compositional distribution. The copolymer is described as random because for a polymer comprising propylene, comonomer, and optionally diene, the number and distribution of comonomer residues is consistent with the random statistical polymerization of the monomers. In stereoblock structures, the number of block monomer residues of any one kind adjacent to one another is greater than predicted from a statistical distribution in random copolymers with a similar composition. Historical ethylene-propylene copolymers with stereoblock structure have a distribution of ethylene residues consistent with these blocky structures rather than a random statistical distribution of the monomer residues in the polymer.<br><br>
[00113]	In various embodiments, features of the copolymers include some<br>
or all of the following characteristics, where ranges from any recited upper limit to<br>
any recited lower limit are contemplated:<br>
(i) a melting point ranging from an upper limit of less than 110 °C, or less than 90<br>
°C, or less than 80 °C, or less than 70 °C, to a lower limit of greater than 25 °C, or<br>
greater than 35 °C, or greater than 40 °C, or greater than 45 °C;<br>
(ii) a heat of fusion ranging from a lower limit of greater than 1.0 joule per gram<br>
(J/g), or greater than 1.5 J/g, or greater than 4.0 J/g, or greater than 6.0 J/g, or<br>
greater than 7.0 J/g, to an upper limit of less than 125 J/g, or less than 100 J/g, or<br>
less than 75 J/g, or less than 60 J/g, or less than 50 J/g, or less than 40 J/g, or less<br>
than 30 J/g;<br>
(iii) a triad tacticity as determined by carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (C13<br>
NMR) of greater than 75 %, or greater than 80 %, or greater than 85 %, or greater<br>
than 90 %;<br>
(iv) a tacticity index m/r ranging from a lower limit of 4 or 6 to an 5 upper limit of<br>
8 or 10 or 12;<br>
(v) an intermolecular tacticity such that at least X % by weight of the copolymer is<br>
soluble in two adjacent temperature fractions of a thermal fractionation carried out<br>
in hexane in 8 °C increments, where X is 75, or 80, or 85 or 90, or 95, or 97, or<br>
99;<br>
(vi) a reactivity ratio product r^2 of less than 1.5, or less than 1.3, or less than 1.0,<br>
or less than 0. 8;	-<br>
(vii) a molecular weight distribution Mw/Mn ranging from a lower limit of 1.5 or<br>
1.8 to an upper limit of 40 or 20 or 10 or 5 or 3;<br>
(viii) a molecular weight of from 15,000 - 5,000,000;<br>
(ix) an elasticity as defined herein of less than 30 %, or less than 20 %, or less than<br>
10 %, or less than 8 %, or less than 5 %; and or<br>
(x) a 500 % tensile modulus of greater than 0.5 MPa, or greater than 0.8 MPa, or<br>
greater than 1.0 MPa, or greater than 2. 0 MPa.<br><br>
Melting Point, Percent Crystallinity and Heat of Fusion<br>
[00114]	Melting point (second melt), percent crystallinity and heat of fusion<br>
are determined according to the following DSC procedure: Differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) trace data is obtained using a TA Instruments model 2920 machine. Samples weighing approximately 7-10 mg are sealed in aluminum sample pans. The DSC data are recorded by first cooling the sample to -50 °C and then gradually heating it to 200 °C at a rate of 10 °C/minute. The sample is kept at 200 °C for 5 minutes before a second cooling-heating cycle is applied. Both the first and second cycle thermal events are recorded. Areas under the melting curves are measured and used to determine the heat of fusion and the degree of crystallinity. The percent crystallinity is calculated using the formula, [area under the curve (Joules/gram) / B (Joules/gram)] * 100, where B is the heat effusion for the homopolymer of the major monomer component. These values for B are to be obtained from the Polymer Handbook, Fourth Edition, published by John Wiley and Sons, New York 1999. A value of 189 J/g (B) is used as the heat of fusion for polypropylene.<br>
Triad Tacticity<br>
[00115]	An ancillary procedure for the description of the tacticity of the<br>
propylene units of embodiments of the current invention is the use of triad tacticity. The triad tacticity of a polymer is the relative tacticity of a sequence of three adjacent propylene units, a chain consisting of head to tail bonds, expressed as a binary combination of m and r sequences. It is usually expressed for copolymers of the present invention as the ratio of the number of units of the specified tacticity to all of the propylene triads in the copolymer.<br>
[00116]        The mm triad tacticity (mm fraction) of a propylene copolymer can be determined from a 13C NMR spectrum of the propylene copolymer and the following formula:<br>
mm Fraction = •<br>
PPP(mm)<br>
PPP(mm) + PPP(mr) + PPP(rr)<br><br>
where PPP(mm), PPP(mr) and PPP(rr) denote peak areas derived from the methyl groups of the second units in the following three propylene unit chains consisting of head-to-tail bonds:<br><br>

[00117]	The 13C NMR spectrum of the propylene copolymer is measured<br>
and the triad tacticity determined as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,504,172 and references therein. The propylene copolymers of embodiments of our invention have an mm triad tacticity of three propylene units, as measured by 13C NMR, of greater than 75%, or greater than 80%, or greater than 82%, or greater than 85%, or greater than 90%.<br>
Tacticity Index<br>
[00118]	The tacticity index, expressed herein as "m/r", is determined by 13C<br>
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The tacticity index m/r is calculated as defined in H.N. Cheng, Macromolecules, 17, 1950 (1984). The designation "m" or "r" describes the stereochemistry of pairs of contiguous propylene groups, "m" referring to meso and "r" to racemic. An m/r ratio of 1.0 generally describes a syndiotactic polymer, and an m/r ratio of 2.0 an atactic material. An isotactic material theoretically may have a ratio approaching infinity, and many by-product atactic polymers have sufficient isotactic content to result in ratios of greater than<br><br>
50. Copolymers of embodiments of our invention can have a tacticity index m/r ranging from a lower limit of 4 or 6 to an upper limit of 8 or 12.<br>
Intermolecular Tacticity<br>
Molecular Structure: Homogeneous Distribution:<br>
[00119]	Homogeneous distribution is defined as a statistically insignificant<br>
intermolecular difference of both in the composition of the copolymer and in the tacticity of the polymerized propylene. For a copolymer to have a homogeneous distribution it must meet the requirement of two independent tests: (i) intermolecular distribution of tacticity; and (ii) interaiolecular distribution of composition, which are described below. These tests are a measure of the statistically insignificant intermolecular differences of tacticity of the polymerized propylene and the composition of the copolymer, respectively.<br>
Intermolecular Distribution of Tacticity:<br>
[00120]	Preferred polymer produced herein have a statistically insignificant<br>
intermolecular difference of tacticity of polymerized propylene between different<br>
chains (intermolecularly.). This is determined by thermal fractionation by<br>
controlled dissolution generally in a single solvent, at a series of slowly elevated<br>
temperatures. A typical solvent is a saturated hydrocarbon such as hexane or<br>
heptane. These controlled dissolution procedures are commonly used to separate<br>
similar polymers of different crystallim'ty due to differences in isotactic propylene<br>
sequences, as shown in the article in Macromolecules, Vol. 26, p2064 (1993).<br>
[00121]	hi embodiments of our invention, at least 75% by weight, or at least<br>
80% by weight, or at least 85% by weight, or at least 90% by weight, or at least 95% by weight, or at least 97% by weight, or at least 99% by weight of the polymer is soluble in a single temperature fraction, or in two adjacent temperature fractions, with the balance of the polymer in immediately preceding or succeeding temperature fractions. These percentages are fractions, for instance in hexane, beginning at 23° C and the subsequent fractions are in approximately 8° C increments above 23° C. Meeting such a fractionation requirement means that a<br><br>
polymer has statistically insignificant intermolecular differences of tacticity of the polymerized propylene.<br>
Intermolecular Distribution of Composition:<br>
[00122]	Preferred polymers produced herein have statistically insignificant<br>
intermolecular differences of composition, which is the ratio of propylene to ethylene between different chains (intermolecular). This compositional analysis is by infrared spectroscopy of the fractions of the polymer obtained by the controlled thermal dissolution procedure described above.<br>
[00123]	A measure of the statistically insignificant intermolecular<br>
differences of composition, each of these fractions has a composition (wt. %<br>
ethylene content) with a difference of less than 1.5 wt. % (absolute) or less than<br>
1.0 wt. % (absolute), or less than 0.8 wt. % (absolute) of the average wt. %<br>
ethylene content of the whole polymer. Meeting such a fractionation requirement<br>
means that a polymer has statistically insignificant intermolecular differences of<br>
composition, which is the ratio of propylene to comonomer (such as ethylene).<br>
[00124]	To produce a copolymer having the desired randomness and narrow<br>
composition, it is beneficial if (1) a single sited metallocene catalyst is used which allows only a single statistical mode of addition of the first and second monomer sequences and (2) the copolymer is well-mixed in a continuous flow stirred tank polymerization reactor which allows only a single polymerization environment for substantially all of the polymer chains of the copolymer.<br>
Molecular Weight and Molecular Weight Distribution<br>
[00125]	Mw, Mn, Mz and Mw/Mn are determined using an instrument<br>
containing columns packed with porous beads, an elution solvent, and detector in order to separate polymer molecules of different sizes. Molecular weights for ethylene propylene copolymers were measured by gel permeation chromatography using (1) an Alliance 2000 GPC3D equipped with differential refractive index (DRI) and viscometry detectors and an 18 angle light scattering detector or (2) a Polymer Labs 220 GPC 3D equipped with DRI, viscometry and an 3 angle light scattering detector. Detectors were calibrated using polystyrene standards Samples<br><br>
were run in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (135 °C) using three Polymer Laboratories PC<br>
Gel mixed B LS columns in series. A correlation of polystyrene retention volume<br>
obtained from the standards, to the retention volume of the polymer tested, yields<br>
the polymer molecular weight.<br>
[00126]	Average molecular weights M can be computed from the<br>
expression:<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
where Ni is the number of molecules having a molecular weight Mj. When n=0, M is the number average molecular weight Mn. When n=l, M is the weight average molecular weight Mw. When n=2, M is the Z-average molecular weight Mz. The desired MWD function (e.g., Mw/Mn or Mz/Mw) is the ratio of the corresponding M values. Measurement of M and MWD is well known in the art and is discussed in more detail in, for example, Slade, P. E. Ed., Polymer   .

column 17, line 19 to. line 49 of US 6,525,157.<br>
Tensile Modulus<br>
[00130]	Tensile Modulus is determined according to ASTM D 638 at 20<br>

Stereo- and Regio- Errors in Insertion of Propylene: 2,1 and 1.3 Insertions<br>
[00132]	In polyolefins prepared by polymerization of oolefins of three or<br>
more carbon atoms in the presence of a chiral metallocene catalyst, 2,1-insertion or 1,3-insertion takes place in addition to the usual 1,2-insertion, such that inversely inserted units such as a 2,1- insertion or a 1,3-insertion are formed in the olefin polymer molecule (see, Macromolecular Chemistry Rapid Communication, Volume 8, page 305 (1987), by K. Soga, T. Shiono, S. Takemura and W.<br>
Kaminski). Thus, the insertion of propylene can occur to a small extent by either 2,1 (tail to tail) or 1,3 insertions (end to end). The proportion of the 2,1-insertions to all of the propylene insertions in a propylene elastomer is calculated by the method described by Tsutsui, T. et. al. Polymer, 1989, 30, 1350. The extent of 1,3 insertions are determined according to the procedure described in US 5,504,172. In a preferred embodiment, the proportion of inversely inserted propylene units of polymers produced herein, based on the 2,1-insertion of a propylene monomer in all propylene insertions, as measured by 13C NMR, is greater than 0.5%, or greater than 0.6%. based on the 1,3-insertion of a propylene monomer, as measured by 13C NMR, is greater than 0.05%, or greater than 0.06%, or greater than 0.07%, or greater than 0.08%, or greater than 0.085 percent.<br>
[00133]	In a preferred embodiment, the polymers produced herein are<br>
random copolymers of propylene and ethylene having a heat of fusion as determined by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) of less than 50 J/g, a melt index (MI) of less than 5 dg/min, and containing stereoregular propylene crystallinity. Preferably the polymer is a random copolymer of propylene and at least one comonomer selected from ethylene, C4-Ci2 a-olefins, and combinations thereof, preferably the polymer comprises from 2 wt % to 25 wt% polymerized ethylene units, based on the total weight of the polymer.<br>
[00134]	In another preferred embodiment, the polymer produced herein<br>
comprises:<br>
a first monomer present at from 40 to 95 mole %, preferably 50 to 90 mole %, preferably 60 to 80 mole %, and<br>
a comonomer present at from 5 to 40 mole %, preferably 10 to 60 mole %, more preferably 20 to 40 mole %,and<br>
a termonomer present at from 0 to 10 mole%, more preferably from 0.5 to 5 mole%, more preferably 1 to 3 mole %.<br>
[00135]	Preferably the first monomer comprises one or more of any Ci to<br>
Cg linear branched or cyclic alpha -olefins, including propylene, butene, (and all isomers thereof), pentene (and all isomers thereof), hexene (and all isomers<br>

Preferred monomers include propylene, 1-butene, 1-hexene, 1-octene, cyclohexene, cyclooctene, hexadiene, cyclohexadiene and the like. Preferably the comonomer comprises one or more of any Ca to 040 linear, branched or cyclic alpha-olefins (provided ethylene, if present, is present at 5 mole% or less), including ethylene, propylene, butene, pentene, hexene, heptene, and octene, nonene, decene, un-decene, do-decene, hexadecene, butadiene, hexadiene, heptadiene, pentadiene, octadiene, nonadiene, decadiene, dodecadiene, styrene, 3,5,5- trimethylhexene-1, 3-methylpentene-l, 4-methylpentene-l, cyclopentadiene, and cyclohexene. Preferably the termonomer comprises one or more of any €2 to €40 linear, branched or cyclic alpha-olefins, (provided ethylene, if present, is present at 5 mole% or less), including ethylene, propylene, butene, pentene, hexene, heptene, and octene, nonene, decene, un-decene, do-decene, hexadecene, butadiene, hexadiene, heptadiene, pentadiene, octadiene, nonadiene, decadiene, dodecadiene, styrene, 3,5,5-trimethyl hexene-1, 3-methylpentene-l, 4-methylpentene-1, cyclopentadiene, and cyclohexene. In a preferred embodiment the copolymers described herein comprise at least 50 mole% of a first monomer and up to 50 mole% of other monomers.<br>
[00136]	In the measurement of properties ascribed to some polymers<br>
produced herein, there is preferably a substantial absence of a secondary or tertiary polymer or polymers to form a blend. By "substantial absence" we intend less than 10%, or 15 less than 5%, or less than 2.5%, or less than 1%, or 0%, by weight.<br>
Blends<br>
[00137]	The catalyst compositions of the invention can be used as described<br>
above individually for coordination polymerization or can be mixed to prepare polymer blends with other known olefin polymerization catalyst compounds. By selection of monomers, blends of coordination catalyst compounds, polymer blends can be prepared under polymerization conditions analogous to those using individual catalyst compositions. Polymers having increased MWD for improved<br>
processing and other traditional benefits available from polymers made with mixed catalyst systems can thus be achieved.<br>
[00138]	It is generally believed that in situ blending provides a more<br>
homogeneous product and allows the blend to be produced in one step. The use of mixed catalyst systems for in situ blending involves combining more than one catalyst in the same reactor to simultaneously produce multiple distinct polymer products. This method requires additional catalyst synthesis and the various catalyst components must be matched for their activities, the polymer products they generate at specific conditions, and their response to changes in polymerization conditions. In a preferred embodiment, polymers produced herein can be thermoplastic polymer compositions composed of a majority of propylene with a minor amount of ethylene or other alpha olefins having between 4 to 20 carbon atoms. These polymer compositions include a linear, single homogeneous macromolecular copolymer structure. These polymers have limited crystallmiry due to adjacent isotactic propylene units and have a melting point of between 25 and 110°C. They are preferably generally devoid of any substantial intermolecular heterogeneity in tacticity and comonomer composition. They are also devoid of any substantial heterogeneity in intramolecular composition distribution. In addition, these thermoplastic polymer compositions are soft and elastic.<br>
[00139]	In all previous embodiments including but not limited to ethylene<br>
polymers, ethylene copolymers , propylene polymers, other polymers and blends, the polymers described above may further comprise one or more dienes at up to 16 weight %, preferably at the lower limit of 0.00001 wt%, preferably at a lower limit of 0.002, preferably at a lower limit of 0.3 weight %, preferably to 0.5 weight %, even more preferably 0.75 wt% and to a higher limit of to 1.0 weight %, a higher limit of 3 wt% and a higher limit of 7 wt% and a higher limit of 15 wt% based upon the total weight of the composition. All of these percentages are by weight, based upon the weight of the copolymer. The presence or absence of diene can be conventionally determined by infrared techniques well known to those skilled in the art. Sources of diene include diene monomer added to the polymerization of ethylene and propylene, or use of diene in catalysts. Non-<br>
conjugated dienes useful as co-monomers are preferably straight chain, hydrocarbon di-olefins or cycloalkenyl-substituted alkenes, having 6 to 15 carbon atoms, for example: (a) straight chain acyclic dienes, such as 1,4- hexadiene and 1,6-octadiene; (b) branched chain acyclic dienes, such as 5 -m ethyl -1, 4-hexadi ene; 3,7-dimethyl- 1,6-octadiene; 3,7-dimethyl-l,7-octadiene; and the mixed isomers of dihydro-myricene and dihydro-ocinene; (c) single ring alicyclic dienes, such as C ID 1,3-cyclopentadiene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene; 1,5-cyclo-octadiene and 1,5- cyclododecadiene; (d) multi-ring alicyclic fused and bridged ring dienes, such as tetrahydroindene; nonboradiene; m ethyl -tetrahydro 1 ndene; dicyclopentadiene (DCPD); bicyclo-(2.2.1)-hepta-2,5-diene; alkenyl, alkylidene, cycloalkenyl and cycloalkylidene norbomenes, such as 5 -m ethyl ene-2-norbomen e (NM), 5-propenyl-2-norboraene, 5-isopropylidene-2-norbomene, 5-(4-cyclopentenyl)- 2-norbomene, 5-cyclohexylidene-2-norbornene, and 5-vinyl-2-norbornene (VNB); (e) cycloalkenyl-substituted alkenes, such as allyl cyclohexene, vinyl cyclooctene, allyl cyclodecene, vinyl cyclododecene. Of the non-conjugated dienes typically used, the preferred dienes are dicyclopentadiene, 1,4-hexadiene, 5- methylene-2-norbomene, and 5 -ethyl idene-2-norbomene, and tetracyclo (A-11,12) 5,8 dodecene. Particularly preferred diolefins are 5-ethylidene-2- norbomene (ENB), 1,4-hexadiene, dicyclopentadiene (DCPD), and 5-vinyl-2-norbomene (VNB).<br>
[00140]	Any of the polymers or oligomers produced by this invention, may<br>
be functionalized. Preferred functional groups include maleic acid and maleic s anhydride. By functionalized is meant that the polymer has been contacted with an unsaturated acid or anhydride. Preferred unsaturated acids or anhydrides include any unsaturated organic compound containing at least one double bond and at least one carbonyl group. Representative acids include carboxylic acids, anhydrides, esters and their salts, both metallic and non-metallic. Preferably the organic compound contains an ethylenic unsaturation conjugated with a carbonyl group (-C=0). Examples include maleic, fumaric, acrylic, methacrylic, itaconic, crotonic, alpha.methyl crotonic, and cinnamic acids as well as their anhydrides, esters and salt derivatives. Maleic anhydride is particularly preferred. The unsaturated acid or anhydride is preferably present at about 0.1 weight % to about<br>
10 weight %, preferably at about 0.5 weight % to about 7 weight %, even more preferably at about 1 to about 4 weight %, based upon the weight of the hydrocarbon resin and the unsaturated acid or anhydride.<br>

[00142]	Propylene polymers were prepared in examples A, B, and L.<br>
Molecular weights (weight average molecular weight (Mw) and number average molecular weights (Mn) and polydispersity indices (Mw/Mn) were determined, versus polystyrene, using high throughput gel permeation chromatography measurement techniques disclosed in US6475391. Where indicated, thermal analyses were done using a TA Instruments DSC (Model 2920) by first heating the sample from -50 to 220 °C at 10 °C/min, isotherm at 220 °C for 10 minutes, then cooling at 10 °C/min from 150 °C to -100 °C and finally again heating to 150 °C at 10 °C/min. The second heat results are reported.<br>
[00143]	Molecular weights for ethylene propylene copolymers prepared in<br>
examples C-K were measured by gel permeation chromatography using (1) an Alliance 2000 GPC3D equipped with differential refractive index (DRI) and viscometry detectors and an 18 angle light scattering detector calibrated using polystyrene standards or (2) a Polymer Labs 220 GPC 3D equipped with DRI, viscometry and an 3 angle light scattering detector. Samples were run in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (135 °C) using three Polymer Laboratories PC Gel mixed B LS columns in series.<br>
[00144]	Thermal analyses of the ethylene propylene copolymers prepared in<br>
examples C-K were conducted on a Pyris 1 instrument using the accompanying software available form Perkin Elmer Instruments, USA. Heat of fusion (AHfus in the tables herein) were measured by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)<br>
using the ASTM E-794-95 procedure. All measurements were conducted during the first heating cycle between -100 °C and +150 °C on a sample that had been molded at 200°C and allowed to anneal at room temperature for approximately 7 days. The first heating cycle was run at a temperature ramp rate of 20°C/min. The heat of fusion was measured from the total area under the peak curve in the region of room temperature to 105°C. The melting temperatures reported here are the peak melting temperatures from the second melt unless otherwise indicated. For polymers displaying multi-peak melting characteristics, the higher melting peak was taken as the principal melting point.<br>
[00145]	Composition measurements of the ethylene propylene copolymers<br>
prepared in examples C-J were conducted on a Perkin Elmer PE 1760 FTIR<br>
spectrophotometer. A thin homogeneous film of the copolymer was pressed at a<br>
temperature of about 150°C, or greater, then mounted on the spectrophotometer.<br>
A full spectrum of the sample from 600 to 4000 cm"1 was recorded and the<br>
monomer weight percent of ethylene calculated from the equation: Ethylene wt %<br>
- 82.585. -111.987X + 30.045 X2, wherein X is the ratio of the peak height at 1155<br>
cm"1 and peak height at either 722 or 732 cm"1, whichever is higher.<br>
[00146]	For example K, 13C NMR measurements with and without proton<br>
decoupling were used to determine the composition, propylene triad tacticities<br>
([mm]), regio error content, the reactivity ratio product (rlr2) and m/r ratios.<br>
Methods to determine these values are found in: Randall, J. Macromolecules<br>
1978, 11, 33; Cozewith, C. Macromolecules 1987, 20, 1237; Tsutsui, T. et. al.<br>
Polymer, 1989, 30, 1350; US 5,504,172 and references therein.<br>
[00147]	For example K, polymer samples for 13C NMR spectroscopy were<br>
dissolved in<br>
da -1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane and the samples were recorded at 125°C using a NMR spectrometer of 75 or 100 MHz. Polymer resonance peaks are referenced to mmmm=21.8 ppm. Calculations involved in the characterization of polymers by NMR follow the work of F. A. Bovey in "Polymer Conformation and Configuration" Academic Press, New York 1969 and J. Randall in "Polymer Sequence Determination, Carbon-13 NMR Method", Academic Press, New York, 1977. The percent of methylene sequences of two in length, %(CH2)2, were<br>
calculated as follows: the integral of the methyl carbons between 14-18 ppm (which are equivalent in concentration to the number of methylenes in sequences of two in length) divided by the sum of the integral of the methylene sequences of one in length between 45-49 ppm and the integral of the methyl carbons between 14-18 ppm, times 100. This is a minimum calculation for the amount of methylene groups contained in a sequence of two or more since methylene sequences of greater than two have been excluded. Assignments were based on H. N. Cheng and J. A. Ewen, Makromol. Chem. 1989, 190, 1931.<br>

Stress Strain Behavior of EP Copolymers Prepared in Continuous Solution Copolymerizations.<br>
[00186]	Polymer (&gt;72 g) prepared in the continues solution was<br>
homogenized in a Brabender intensive mixture for 3 minutes at a temperature controlled to be within 180-220 °C. High shear roller blades were used for the mixing and approximately 0.4 g of Irganox-1076, an antioxidant available from the Novartis Corporation, was added to the blend. At the end of the mixing, the mixture was removed and pressed out into a 6" x 6" mold into a pad 025" thick at 215 °C for 3 to 5 min. At the end of this period, the pad was cooled for 2.5 min and removed and allowed to anneal for 40-48 h. Test specimens of the required dumbbell geometry were removed from this pad and evaluated on an Instron tester to produce the data shown in Table 17. Young's Modulus, Ultimate elongation and Ultimate tensile were determined according to ASTM D638 and modulus data at 50%, 100%, 200% and 500% was recorded for the test done according to ASTM D638.<br>
Composition Distribution Determination of EP Copolymers Prepared in Continuous Solution Copolymerizations.<br>
[00187]	Composition distribution of the polymers as described above was<br>
measured as described below. About 30 g of the second polymer component was cut into small cubes about 1/8" on the side. This is introduced into a thick walled glass bottle closed with screw cap along with 50 mg of Irganoxl076, an antioxidant commercially available from Ciba - Geigy Corporation. Then, 425 mL of hexane (a principal mixture of normal and ISO isomers) is added to the contents of the bottle and the sealed bottle is maintained at about 23 °C for 24 h. At the end of this period, the solution is decanted and the residue is treated with additional hexane for an additional 24 h. At the end of this period, the two-hexane solutions are combined and evaporated to yield a residue of the polymer soluble at 23 °C. To the residue is added sufficient hexane to bring the volume to 425 mL and the bottle is maintained at about 31 °C for 24 h in a covered circulating water bath. The soluble polymer is decanted and the additional amount of hexane is added for another 24 hours at about 31 °C prior to decanting, hi this<br>
manner, fractions of the second polymer component soluble at 40, 48, 55, and 62 °C are obtained at temperature increases of approximately 8 °C between stages. Further, increases in temperature to 95 °C can be accommodated, if heptane, instead of hexane, is used as the solvent for all temperatures above about 60 °C. The soluble polymers are dried, weighed and analyzed for composition, as wt% ethylene content, by the IR technique described above. Soluble fractions obtained in the adjacent temperature increases are the adjacent fractions in the specification above. Results are reported in Table 18.<br>
