The most promising ecteinascidin is ecteinascidin 743, which is undergoing clinical trials for treatment of cancers.   Et 743 has a complex tris(tetrahydroisoquinolinephenol) structure of the following formula (I):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
It is currently prepared by isolation from extracts of the marine tunicate Ecteinascidin turbinata.  The yield is low, and alternative preparative processes have been sought. I<br>
The ecteinascidins include a fused system of five rings (A) to (E) as shown in the following structure of formula (XIV):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
In ecteinascidin 743, the 1,4 bridge has the structure of formula (IV):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Other known ecteinascidins include compounds with a different bridged cyclic ring system, such as occurs in ecteinascidin 722 and 736, where the bridge has the structure of formula (V):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
ecteinascidins 583 and 597, where the bridge has the structure of formula (VI):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
and ecteinascidin 594 and 596, where the bridge has the structure of formula (VII):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The complete structure for these and related compounds is given in J. Am. Chem. Soc. (1996)118,9017-9023.<br>
Further compounds are known with the fused five ring system. In general, they lack the bridged cyclic ring system which is present in the ecteinascidins. They include the bis(terrahydroisoquinolinequinone) antitumor-antimicrobial antibiotics safracins and saframycins, and the marine natural products renieramicins and xestomycin isolated from cultured microbes or sponges. They all have a common dimeric tetrahydroisoquinoline carbon framework. These compounds can be classified into four types, types I to IV, with respect to the oxidation pattern of the aromatic rings.<br>
Type I, dimeric isoquinolinequinones, is a system of formula (VIII) most commonly occuring in this class of compounds, see the following table I.<br>
Table I Structure of Type I Saframycin Antibiotics (Table Removed)<br>
 where the group Q is of formula (IX):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Type I aromatic rings are seen in saframycins A, B and C; G and H; and S isolated from Streptomyces lavendulae as minor components. A cyano derivative of safrarnycin A, called cyanoquinonamine, is known from Japanese Kokai JP-A2 59/225189 and 60/084288. Saframycins Y3, Yd1, Ad1 and Yd2 were produced by S. lavendulae by directed biosynthesis, with appropriate supplementation of the culture medium. Saframycins Y2b and Y2b-ddimers formed by linking the nitrogen on the C-25 of one unit to the C-14 of the other,have also been produced in supplemented culture medium of 5". lavendulae. Saframycins AR1 (=AH2), a microbial reduction product of saframycin A at C-25 produced by Rhodococcus amidophilus, is also prepared by nonstereoselective chemical reduction of saframycin A by sodium borohydride as a 1:1 mixture of epimers followed by chromatographic separation (the other isomer AH] is less polar). The further reduction product saframycin AR3, 21-decyano-25-dihydro-saframycin A, (= 25-dihydrosaframycin B) was produced by the same microbial conversion. Another type of microbial conversion of saframycin A using a Nocardia species produced saframycin B and further reduction by a Mycobacteriurn species produced saframycin AH1Ac. The 25-0-acetates of saframycin AH2 and AH1 have also been prepared chemically for biological studies.<br>
Type I compounds of formula (X) have also been isolated from marines sponges, see Table II.<br>
Table II Structures of Type I Compounds from Marine Sponges<br>
(Formula and Table Removed)<br>
Renieramycins A-D were isolated from the antimicrobial extract of a sponge, a Reniera species collected in Mexico, along with the biogenetically related monomeric isoquinolines renierone and related compounds. The structure of renieramycin A was initially assigned with inverted stereochemistry at C-3, C-11, and C-13. However, careful examination of the 1H NMR data for new, related compounds renieramycins E and F, isolated from the same sponge collected in Palau, revealed that the ring junction of renieramycins was identical to that of saframycins. This result led to the conclusion that the formerly assigned stereochemistry of renieramycins A to D must be the same as that of saframycins.<br>
Xestomycin was found in a sponge, a Xestospongia species collected from Sri Lankan waters.<br>
Type II compounds of formula (XI) with a reduced hydroquinone ring include saframycins D and F, isolated from S. lavendulae, and saframycins Mx-1 and Mx-2, isolated from Myxococcus xanthus. See table III.<br>
Table III Type II Compounds (Formula and Table Removed)<br>
The type III skeleton is found in the antibiotics safracins A and B, isolated from cultured Pseudomonasfluorescens. These antibiotics of formula (XII) consist of a tetrahydroisoquinoline-quinone subunit and a tetrahydroisoquinolinephenol subunit.<br>
Where R21 is -H in safracin A and is -OH in safracin B.<br>
Saframycin R, the only compound classified as the Type IV skeleton, was also isolated from 5". lavendulae. This compound of formula (XIII), consisting of a hydroquinone ring with a glycolic ester side chain on one of the phenolic oxygens, is conceivably a pro-drug of saframycin A because of its moderate toxicity.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
These known compounds include the fused system of five rings of the formula (XIV):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
In this text, we refer to this ring structure as the fused ecteinascidin five ring system, though it will be appreciated that the rings 'A and E are phenolic in the ecteinascidins and some other compounds, while in other compounds, notably the saframycins, the rings A and £ are quinolic. In the compounds, the rings B and D are tetrahydro, while ring C is perhydro.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides compounds having the fused ecteinascidin five ring system and related to ecteinascidins 583 and 597. In ecteinascidins 583 and 597 the 1,4 bridge has the structure of formula (VIa):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Certain compounds of this invention have the fused five ring system of ecteinascidins and the bridge structure of formula (VIa), with the -NH2 optionally derivatised. These compounds can be acylated on the  -CHNH2- group present in the formula (VI). Other derivative compounds of this invention comprise those where this -CHNH2- group is replaced by a group - CHNHX1 or -C(X2)2- where X1 or X2 are as<br>
defined. The remaining substiruents on the fused ecteinascidin five ring system can be the same as those on natural compounds, particularly natural ecteinascidins, or different.<br>
Other compounds of this invention have the fused five ring system of ecteinascidins and the bridge structure of formula (VIb) in which the -NH2 group on the bridge has been replaced with an -OH group which may be optionally derivatised. These compounds can be acylated on the -CHOH- group present in the formula (VIb). Other derivative compounds of this invention comprise those where this -CHOH- group is replaced by a group - CHOX1 or -C(X2)2- where X1 or X2 are as defined. The remaining substiruents on the fused ecteinascidin five ring system can be the same as those on natural compounds, particularly natural ecteinascidins, or different.<br>
In the compounds of this invention, the stereochemistry of the bridgehead carbon atom bearing the -OH or -NH2 group (or substituted derivatives thereof) can be the same as that of the natural compounds, particularly natural ecteinascidins, or different.<br>
In the compounds of this invention, the fused system of five rings (A) to (E) of formula (XIV) can be as in the ecteinascidins, or may be as in other related compounds. Thus the rings A and E can be phenolic or quinolic; the rings B and D are tetrahydro, and ring C is perhydro.<br>
Compounds of this invention exhibit antitumor activity, and the invention provides pharamaceutical compositions of the compounds, along with methods for preparing the compositions and methods of treatment using the compounds or compositions.<br>
The invention also provides new hemisynthetic and synthetic routes to the compounds of this invention.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED PROCESSES<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be synthetically prepared from the intermediate compounds 47 and 15 described in the U.S. Patent No 5,721,362, the compound 36 described in WO 00/69862 and from the secondary products (numbered here as 23 and 24) obtained in some deprotection steps using AlC^ of the compound 33 of WO 00/69862.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Compound (1) corresponds to the synthetic intermediate (47) described in the US patent No 5,721,362. Compounds 27 and 28 included in Table IV are described as 35 and 34 in WO 00/69862.<br>
Some of the preferred methods of producing the compound of formula I are described below in the following reaction schemes with examples of typical substituent groups. These typical substituents are not limiting of the invention, and the process is to be understood in the more general sense, without special regard to the identities indicated by the code letters.<br>
Numerous active antitumoral compounds have been prepared from this compounds and it is believed that many more compounds can be formed in accordance with the teachings of the present disclosure.<br>
SCHEME I<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
SCHEME II<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
The type of reactions are the following:<br>
Methods A, B, C, E and M include different acylation methods with acid chlorides, anhydrides, acids or sulfonyl chlorides, to obtain amide or ester bonds.<br>
Methods D and H involve reductive alkylation reactions between an aldehyde and 1 or an amine and 5 to give 2m or 3o.<br>
Method F transforms compound 1 to 2n by reaction with BnBr and Cs2CO3.<br>
Method G involves the deprotection of methoxymethyl group (MOM) or MOM/tert-butyloxy carbonyl groups or MOM/allyloxy carbonyl groups using trimethylchlorosilane (TMSC1) and sodium iodide.<br>
Methods I (AgNO3) and J (CuBr) convert CN into OH in position C-21.<br>
Method K involves the hydrolysis of a carbamate bond using aqueous trifluoroacetic acid.<br>
Method L converts a carbonyl group to an alcohol by reduction with NaCNBH3 in the presence of acetic acid. With this reaction a new chiral center is generated. Taking into account steric effects and spectroscopic data, it seem that the main compound (11) has R configuration at this center and the secondary product (12*) has S configuration. On this basis 13,15,17, 19, 21 will have R configuration and 14*. 18* and 22* will have S configuration. These assignments have been made based on the available spectral data and as such, in the absence of specific studies to confirm the assignments, should be considered as only tentative.<br>
Modified processes can be used to prepare other compounds of this invention. In particular the starting material and/or reagents and reactions can be varied to suit other combinations of the substituent groups.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention is directed at the use of a known compound, safracin B, also referred to as quinonamine, in hemisynthetic synthesis.<br>
More generally, the invention relates to a hemisynthetic process for the formation of intermediates, derivatives and related structures of ecteinascidin or other tetrahydroisoquinolinephenol compounds starting from natural bis(tetrahydroisoquinoline) alkaloids.<br>
Suitable preferred starting materials for the hemi-synthetic process include the classes of saframycin and safracin antibiotics available from different culture broths, and also the classes of reineramicin and xestomycin compounds available from marine sponges.<br>
A general formula (XV) for the starting compounds is as follows:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where:<br>
R1 is an amidomethylene group such as -CH2-NH-CO-CR25aR25bR25c where R25a and R25b<br>
form a keto group or one is -OH, -NH2 or -OCOCH3 and the other is -CH2COCH3, -H, -<br>
OH or -OCOCH3, provided that when R25a is -OH or -NH2 then R25b is not -OH, and R25c<br>
is -H, -CH3 or -CH2CH3, or R1 is an acyloxymethylene group such as -CH2-O-CO-R,<br>
where R is -C(CH3)=CH-CH3 or -CH3;<br>
R5 and R8 are independently chosen from -H, -OH or -OCOCH2OH, or R5 and R8 are<br>
both keto and the ring A is a p-benzoquinone ring;<br>
R14a and R14b are both -H or one is -H and the other is -OH, -OCH3 or -OCH2CH3, or R148<br>
and R14b together form a keto group;<br>
R15 and R18 are independently chosen from -H or -OH, or R5 and R8 are both keto and the ring A is a p-benzoquinone ring; and R21 is -OH or -CN.<br>
A more general formula for these class of compounds is provided below:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein the substituent groups defined by R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9, R10 are each independently selected from the group consisting of H, OH, OCH3 , CN, =0, CH3; wherein X are the different amide or ester functionalities contained in the mentioned natural products; wherein each dotted circle represents one, two or three optional double bonds.<br>
Thus, according to the present invention, we now provide hemisynthetic routes for the production of new and known compounds. The hemisynthetic routes of the invention each comprise a number of transformation steps to arrive at the desired product.   Each step in itself is a process in accordance with this invention.   The invention is not limited to the routes that are exemplified, and alternative routes may be provided by, for example, changing the order of the transformation steps, as appropriate.<br>
In particular, this invention involves the provision of a 21-cyano starting material of general formula (XVI):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where R1, R5, R8, R14a, R14b,R15 and R18 are as defined.<br>
Other compounds of formula (XVI) with different substituents at the 21-position may also represent possible starting materials.   In general, any derivative capable of production by nucleophilic displacement of the 21-hydroxy group of compounds of formula (XV) wherein R21 is a hydroxy group is a candidate.   Examples of suitable 21-substituents include but are not limited to: a mercapto group;<br>
an alkylthio group (the alkyl group having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms); an arylthio group (the aryl group having from 6 to 10 carbon atoms and being unsubstituted or substituted by from 1 to 5 substituents selected from, for example, alkyl group having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, alkoxy groups having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, halogen atoms, mercapto groups and nitro groups); an amino group;<br>
a mono-or dialkylamino (the or each alkyl group having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms); a mono-or diarylamino group (the or each aryl group being as defined above in relation to arylthio groups);<br>
an α-carbonylalkyl group of formula -C(R8)(Rb)-C(=0)Rc, where Ra and Rb are selected from hydrogen atoms, alkyl groups having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, aryl groups (as defined above in relation to arylthio groups) and aralkyl groups (in which an alkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms is substituted by an aryl group a defined above in relation to arylthio groups), with the proviso that one of Ra and Rb is a hydrogen atom;<br>
Rc is selected from a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, aryl groups (as defined above in relation to arylthio groups), an aralkyl group (in<br>
which an alkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms is substituted by an aryl group a defined above in relation to arylthio groups), an alkoxy group having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, an amino group or a mono- or dialkylamino group as defined above.<br>
Thus, in a more general aspect, the present invention relates to processes where the first step is to form a 21-deriviative using a nucleophilic reagent.   We refer to such compounds as 21-Nuc compounds. Preferred starting material 21-Nuc compounds have the structure of formula (XIV):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where at least one ring A or E is quinolic.<br>
Thus, in addition to the use of 21-cyano compounds, processes using other nucleophile-containing compounds, to produce similar compounds of formula (XVI) wherein the 21-position is protected by another nuclephilic group, a 21-Nuc group, are also envisaged. For example, a 21-Nuc compound of formula (XVI) with an alkylamino substituent at the 21-position can be produced by reacting the compound of formula (XV) wherein R21 is a hydroxy group with a suitable alkylamine. A 21-Nuc compound of formula (XVI) with an alkylthio substituent at the 21-position can also be produced by reacting the compound of formula (XV) wherein R21 is a hydroxy group with a suitable alkanethiol. Alternatively, a 21-Nuc compound of formula (XVI) with an α-carbonylalkyl substituent at the 21-position can be produced by reacting the compound of formula (XV) wherein R21 is a hydroxy group with a suitable carbonyl compound, typically in the presence of a base. Other routes are available for other 21-Nuc compounds.<br>
The presence of the 21-cyano group is required for some of the end-products, notably ecteinascidin 770 and phthalascidin, while for other end-products it acts as a protecting group which can readily be converted to another substituent, such as the 21-hydroxy group. The adoption of the 21-cyano compound as the starting material effectively stabilises the molecule during the ensuing synthetic steps, until it is optionally removed.   Other 21 -Nuc compounds can offer this and other advantages.<br>
Preferred starting materials include those compounds of formula (XV) or (XVI) where R14a and R14b are both hydrogen.   Preferred starting materials also include compounds of formula (XV) or (XVI) where R15 is hydrogen.   Furthermore, the preferred starting materials include compounds of formula (XV) or (XVI) where ring E is a phenolic ring.   Preferred starting materials further include compounds of formula (XV) or (XVI) where at least one, better at least two or three of R5, R8, R15 and R18 is not hydrogen.<br>
Examples of suitable starting materials for this invention include saframycin A, saframycin B, saframycin C, saframycin G, saframycin H, saframycin S, saframycin Y3, saframycin Yd1, saframycin Ad1, saframycin Yd2, saframycin AH2, saframycin AH2Ac, saframycin AH1, saframycin AH1Ac, saframycin ARa, renieramycin A, renieramycin B, renieramycin C, renieramycin D, renieramycin E, renieramycin F, xestomycin, saframycin D, saframycin F, saframycin Mx-1, saframycin Mx-2, safracin A, safracin B and saframycin R.   Preferred starting materials have a cyano group in position 21, for the group R21.<br>
In a particularly preferred aspect, the invention involves a hemisynthetic process wherein the transformation steps are applied to safracin B:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
SAFRACIN B<br>
Safracin B presents a ring system closely related to the ecteinascidins. This compound has the same pentacycle structure and the same substitution pattern in the right-hand aromatic ring, ring E.<br>
The more preferred starting materials of this invention have a 21-cyano group. The currently most preferred compound of the present invention is the compound of Formula 2. This compound is obtained directly from safracin B and is considered a key intermediate in the hemisynthetic process.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Cyanosafracin B by fermentation of a safracin B-producing strain of Pseudomonasfluorescens, and working up the cultured broth using cyanide ion.  The preferred strain of Pseudomonas fluorescens is strain A2-2, PERM BP-14, which is employed in the procedure of EP-A-055 299.  A suitable source of cyanide ion is potassium cyanide.   In a typical work-up, the broth is filtered and excess cyanide ion is<br>
added.  After an appropriate interval of agitation, such as 1 hour, the pH is rendered alkaline, say pH 9.5, and an organic extraction gives a crude extract which can be further purified to give the cyanosafracin B.<br>
In general, the conversion of the 21-cyano starting compound to an product of this invention involves:<br>
a)	conversion if necessary of a quinone system for the ring E into the phenol system<br>
b)	conversion if necessary of a quinone system for the ring A into the phenol system;<br>
c)	conversion of the phenol system for the ring A into the methylenedioxyphenol<br>
ring;<br>
d)	formation of the bridged spiro ring system of formula (IV), (VI) or (VII) across<br>
the 1-position and 4-position in ring B; and<br>
e)	derivatisation as appropriate, such as acylation.<br>
Step (a), conversion if necessary of a quinone system for the ring £ into the phenol system, can be effected by conventional reduction procedures.   A suitable reagent system is hydrogen with a palladium-carbon catalyst, though other reducing systems can be employed.<br>
Step (b), conversion if necessary of a quinone system for the ring A into the phenol system is analogous to step (a), and more detail is not needed.<br>
Step (c), conversion of the phenol system for the ring A into the<br>
methylenedioxyphenol ring, can be effected in several ways, possibly along with step (b). For example, a quinone ring A can be demethylated in the methoxy substituent at the 7-position and reduced to a dihydroquinone and trapped with a suitable electrophilic reagent such as CH2Br2, BrCH2Cl, or a similar divalent reagent directly yielding the methylenedioxy ring system, or with a divalent reagent such as thiocarbonyldiimidazol which yields a substituted methylenedioxy ring system which can be converted to the desired ring.<br>
Step (d) is typically effected by appropriate substitution at the 1-position with a bridging reagent that can assist formation of the desired bridge, forming an exendo quinone methide at the 4-position and allowing the methide to react with the 1-substituent to bring about the bridged structure. Preferred bridging reagents are of formula (XIX)<br>

where Fu indicates a protected functional group, such as a group -NHProt4a or OProt4b, Prot3 is a protecting group, and the dotted line shows an optional double bond.<br>
Suitably the methide is formed by first introducing a hydroxy group at the 10-position at the junction of rings A and B to give a partial structure of formula (XX):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
or more preferably a partial structure of formula (XXI):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where the group R" is chosen for the desired group of formula (IV), (V), (VI) or (VII). For the first two such groups, the group R" typically takes the form -CHFu-CH2-SProt3. The protecting groups can then be removed and modified as appropriate to give the desired compound.<br>
A typical procedure for step (d) is provided in US Patent 5,721,362 incorporated by reference.  Particular reference is made to the passage at column 8, step (1) and Example 33 of the US Patent, and related passages.<br>
Derivatisation in step (e) can include acylation, for instance with a group Ra-C0-as well as conversion of the 12-NCH3 group to 12-NH or 12-NCH2CH3.   Such conversion can be effected before or after the other steps, using available methods.<br>
By way of illustration, can be transformed into Intermediate 25;<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
and from this derivative it is possible to introduce a number of cysteine derivatives that can be transformed into compounds of this invention.  Preferred cysteine derivatives are exemplified by the following two compounds:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
One method of this invention transforms cyanosafracin B into intermediate Int-25 through a sequence of reactions that involves essentially (1) removal of methoxy group placed in ring A, (2) reduction of ring A and formation of methylene-dioxy group in one pot, (3) hydrolysis of amide function placed over carbon 1, (4) transformation of the resulting amine group into hydroxyl group, see scheme V.<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
The method avoids protection and de-protection of the primary alcohol function at the position 1 in ring B of compound Int-25 using directly a cysteine residue Int-29 to form intermediate Int-27.   Cysteine derivative Int-29 is protected in the amino group with p-p-p-trichloroethoxycarbonyl protecting group in order to have compatibility with the existing allyl and MOM groups.  Intermediate Int-27 is directly oxidized and cycled.

The conversion of the 2-cyano compound into Intermediate Int-25 usually involves the following steps (see scheme V):<br>
formation of the protected compound of Formula Int-14 by reacting Int-2 with tert-butoxycarbonyl anhydride;<br>
converting of Int-14 into the di-protected compound of Formula Int-15 by reacting with bromomethylmethyl ether and diisopropylethylamine in acetonitrile;<br>
selective elimination of the methoxy group of the quinone system in Int-15 to obtain the compound of Formula Int-16 by reacting with a methanolic solution of sodium hydroxide;<br>
transforming of Int-16 into the methylene-dioxy compound of Formula Int-18 by employing the next preferred sequence: (1) quinone group of compound Int-16 is reduced with 10% Pd/C under hydrogen atmosphere; (2) the hydroquinone intermediate is converted into the methylenedioxy compound of Formula Int-17 by reacting with bromochloromethane and caesium carbonate under hydrogen atmosphere; (3) Int-17 is transformed into the compound of Formula Int-18 by protecting the free hydroxyl group as a OCH2R group.   This reaction is carried out with BrCH2R and caesium carbonate, where R can be aryl, CH=CH2, OR'etc.<br>
elimination of the /er/-butoxycarbonyl and the methyloxymethyl protecting groups of Int-18 to afford the compound of Formula Int-19 by reacting with a solution of HC1 in dioxane.   Also this reaction is achieved by mixing Int-18 with a solution of trifluoroacetic acid in dichloromethane;<br>
formation of the thiourea compound of Formula Int-20 by reacting Int-19 with phenylisothiocyanate;<br>
converting compound of Formula Int-20 into the amine compound of Formula Int-21 by reacting with a solution of hydrogen chloride in dioxane;<br>
transforming compound of Formula Int-21 into the N-Troc derivative Int-22 by reacting with trichloroethyl chloroformate and pyridine;<br>
formation of the protected hydroxy compound of Formula Int-23 by reacting Int-22 with bromomethylmethyl ether and diisopropylethylamine;<br>
transforming compound of Formula Int-23 into the N-H derivative Int-24 by reacting with acetic acid and zinc;<br>
conversion of compound of Formula Int-24 into the hydroxy compound of Formula Int-25 by reaction with sodium nitrite in acetic acid.  Alternatively, it can be used nitrogen tetroxide in a mixture of acetic acid and acetonitrile followed by treatment with sodium hydroxide.  Also, it can be used sodium nitrite in a mixture of acetic anhydride-acetic acid, followed by treatment with sodium hydroxide.<br>
From intermediate Int-25 the conversion into final intermediate compounds Int-35 or Int-36 of this invention can then proceed as shown in Scheme VI: <br>

transforming compound of formula Int-24 into the derivative Int-30 by protecting the primary hydroxyl function with (S)-N-2,2,2-tricloroethoxycarbonyl-S-(9H-fluoren-9-ylmethyl)cysteine Int-29;<br>
converting the protected compound of formula Int-30 into the phenol derivative Int-31 by cleavage of the allyl group with triburyltin hydride and dichloropalladium-bis (triphenylphosphine);<br>
transforming the phenol compound of Formula Int-31 into compound of formula Int-32 by oxidation with benzeneseleninic anhydride at low temperature;<br>
transforming the hydroxy compound of formula Int-32 into the lactone Int-33 by the following sequence: (1) Reacting compound of formula Int-32 with 2 eq. of triflic anhydride and 5 eq. of DMSO. (2) followed by reaction with 8 eq. of diisopropylethylamine. (3) followed by reaction with 4 eq of t-butyl alcohol (4) followed by reaction with 7 eq of 2-tert-Butyl-l,l,3,3,tetramethylguanidine (5) followed by reaction with 10 eq of acetic anhydride;<br>
transforming the lactone compound Int-33 into hydroxyl compound Int-34 by removal of MOM protecting group with TMSI;<br>
cleaving the N-trichloroethoxycarbonyl group of the compound of formula Int-34 into compound Int-35 by reaction with Zn/AcOH;<br>
transforming the amino compound Int-35 into the corresponding α-keto lactone compound Int-36 by reaction with N-methyl pyridinium carboxaldehyde chloride followed by DBU;<br>
The conversion of the Intermediate compound Int-25 into ET-743 using cysteine derivative Int-37 can be made in a similar manner and with the same reagents than with cysteine derivative Int-29 with the exception of transformations (f) and (g).

CYTOTOXIC ACTIVITY<br>
Cell Cultures. Cells were maintained in logarithmic phase of growth in Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium, with Earle's Balanced Salts, with 2.0 mM L-glutamine, with non-essential amino acids, without sodium bicarbonate (EMEM/neaa); supplemented with 10% Fetal Calf Serum (PCS), 10-2 M sodium bicarbonate and 0.1 g/1 penicillin-G + streptomycin sulfate.<br>
A simple screening procedure has been carried out to determine and compare the antitumour activity of these compounds, using an adapted form of the method described by Bergeron et al (1984). The rumour cell line employed have been P-388 (suspension culture of a lymphoid neoplasm from DBA/2 mouse), A-549 (monolayer culture of a human lung carcinoma), HT-29 (monolayer culture of a human colon carcinoma) and MEL-28 (monolayer culture of a human melanoma).<br>
P-388 cell were seeded into 16 mm wells at 1x104 cells per well in 1 ml aliquots of MEM 5FCS containing the indicated concentration of drug. A separate set of cultures without drug was seeded as control growth to ensure that cells remained in exponential phase of growth. All determinations were carried out in duplicate. After three days of incubation at 37°C, 10% CO2 in a 98% humid atmosphere, an approximately ICso was determined by comparing the growth in wells with drug to the growth in wells control.<br>
A-549, HT-29 and MEL-28 were seeded into 16 mm wells at 2xl04 cells per well in 1 ml aliquots of MEM 10FCS containing the indicated concentration of drug. A separate set of cultures without drug was seeded as control growth to ensure that cells remained in exponential phase of growth. All determinations were carried out in duplicate. After three days of incubation at 37°C, 10% CO2 in a 98% humid atmosphere, the wells were stained with 0.1% Crystal Violet. An approximately IC50 was determined by comparing the growth in wells with drug to the growth in wells control.<br>
