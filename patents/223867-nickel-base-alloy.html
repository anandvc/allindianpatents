				<td>NICKEL-BASH ALLOY<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention generally relates to nickel-base alloys. More particularly, this<br>
invention relates to castable and weldable nickel-base alloys exhibiting desirable<br>
properties suitable for gas turbine engine applications.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
The superalloy GTD-222 (U. S. Patent No. 4.810.467) has a number of desirable<br>
properties for gas turbine engine applications, such as nozzles (vanes) in the latter<br>
(second and third) stages of the turbine section. The nominal composition of GTD-<br>
222 is, by weight, about 19% cobalt, about 22.5% chromium, about 2% tungsten,<br>
about 1.2% aluminum, about 2.3% titanium. Al+Ti of about 3.5%, about 0.8%<br>
columbium (niobium), about 1.0% tantalum, about 0.01% boron, about 0.01%<br>
zirconium, about 0.1% carbon, with the balance essentially nickel and incidental<br>
impurities. As with the formulation of other nickel-base alloys, the development of<br>
GTD-222 involved careful and controlled adjustments of the concentrations of certain<br>
critical alloying elements to achieve a desired mix of properties. For use in turbine<br>
nozzle applications, and particularly the latter stage nozzle for which GTD-222 is<br>
used, such properties include high temperature strength, castability. weldability. and<br>
resistant to low cycle fatigue, corrosion and oxidation. The thermal environment<br>
within the second stage of a turbine section is sufficiently severe to require an<br>
oxidation-resistant coating, a thermal barrier coating (TBC). and/or internal cooling<br>
for nozzles formed of the GTD-222 alloy. The properties of GTD-222 are sufficient<br>
to allow third stage nozzles to achieve the design life required of the nozzles without<br>
such additional measures.<br>
When attempting to optimize any one of the desired properties of a superalloy. other<br>
properties are often adversely affected. A particular example is weldability and creep<br>
resistance, both of which are of great importance for gas turbine engine nozzles.<br>
However, greater creep resistance results in an alloy that is more difficult to weld,<br>
which is necessary to allow for repairs by welding. A desirable combination of creep<br>
strength and weldability exhibited by GTD-222 is believed to be the result of the use<br>
of judicious levels of aluminum, titanium, tantalum and columbium in the alloy. Each<br>
of these elements participates in the gamma prime precipitation-strengthening<br>
phase (Ni3(Ti,Al)). Aluminum and titanium are the key elements in the formation of<br>
the gamma-prime phase, while the primary role of tantalum and columbium is to<br>
participate in the MC carbide phase. Tantalum and columbium remaining after MC<br>
carbide formation plays a lesser but not insignificant role in the formation of the<br>
gamma-prime phase.<br>
While GTD-222 has been proven to perform well as the alloy for latter stage nozzles<br>
of gas turbine engines, alternatives would be desirable. Of current interest is the<br>
reduction in tantalum used in view of its high cost. However, the properties of an<br>
alloy with a reduced tantalum content would preferably be closely match those of<br>
GTD-222. particularly for use as the alloy for second and third stage nozzles.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a nickel-base alloy that exhibits a desirable balance of<br>
strength (including creep resistance) and resistance to corrosion and oxidation suitable<br>
for nozzles of the latter stages of a gas turbine engine, particularly the second and<br>
third stage nozzles. The alloy is also castable, relatively easier to weld than GTD-<br>
222, and has acceptable heat treatment requirements. These desirable properties are<br>
achieved with an alloy in which tantalum is eliminated or at a relatively low level and<br>
a relatively high level of columbium is maintained to achieve properties similar to that<br>
of the GTD-222 alloy.<br>
According to the invention, the nickel-base alloy consists essentially of by weight,<br>
10% to 25% cobalt. 20% to 28% chromium 1% to 3% tungsten. 0.5% to 1.5%<br>
aluminum, 1.5% to 2.8% titanium, 0.8% to 1.45% columbium, tantalum in an amount<br>
less than columbium and Cb + 0.508Ta is 1.15% to 1.45%. 0.001 % to 0.025% boron,<br>
up to 0.05% zirconium. 0.02% to 0.15% carbon, with the balance essentially nickel<br>
and incidental impurities. The columbium content of the alloy is preferably at least<br>
0.9%, more preferably at least 1.25%, while the tantalum content of the alloy is<br>
preferably less than 0.5%, more preferably entirely omitted from the alloy.<br>
The alloy of this invention has properties comparable to those of the GTD-222 alloy,<br>
with potentially improved ductility and weldability and with no degradation in<br>
castability. Notably, improved weldability of the alloy is achieved without sacrificing<br>
creep resistance. These properties and advantages are achieved even though the<br>
relative amounts of tantalum and columbium are opposite those of GTD-222. namely,<br>
more columbium is present in the alloy than tantalum, with a preferred maximum<br>
level of tantalum being below the minimum amount of tantalum required for GTD-<br>
222. The desired properties are believed to be achieved by maintaining a substantially<br>
constant combined atomic percent of columbium and tantalum in the alloy, in which<br>
columbium contributes greater to the combined amount than does tantalum as a result<br>
of specifying the combined amount according to the formula Cb + 0.508Ta. Contrary<br>
to GTD-222 (U. S. Patent No. 4,810,467) second and third stage nozzles exhibit<br>
excellent properties when cast from the alloy in which tantalum is essentially absent<br>
i.e., only impurity levels are present. Consequently, the alloy of this invention<br>
provides an excellent and potentially lower-cost alternative to GTD-222 as a result of<br>
reducing or eliminating the requirement for tantalum.<br>
Other objects and advantages of this invention will be better appreciated from the<br>
following detailed description.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention was the result of an effort to develop a nickel-base alloy having<br>
properties comparable to the nickel-base alloy commercially known as GTD-222 and<br>
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4.810.467, incorporated herein by reference, but whose<br>
chemistry is carefully balanced to allow for the reduction or complete elimination of<br>
tantalum. The investigation resulted in the development of a nickel-base alloy whose<br>
properties are particularly desirable for nozzles used in the second or third turbine<br>
stages of a gas turbine engine. Therefore, particular properties of interest include<br>
creep strength, weldability. fatigue life, capability, metallurgical stability and<br>
oxidation resistance. The approach of the investigation resulted in the increase in<br>
columbium to substitute for the absence of tantalum, and as a result radically altered<br>
two of the minor alloying elements of GTD-222 that are known to effect the gamma-<br>
prime precipitation hardening phase.<br>
The high-temperature strength of a nickel-base superalloy is directly related to the<br>
volume fraction of the gamma-prime phase, which in turn is directly related to the<br>
total amount of the gamma prime-forming elements (aluminum, titanium, tantalum<br>
and columbium) present. Based on these relationships, the amounts of these elements<br>
required to achieve a given strength level can be estimated. The compositions of the<br>
gamma-prime phase and other secondary phases such as carbides and borides as well<br>
as the volume fraction of the gamma-prime phase can also be estimated based on the<br>
starting chemistry of the alloy and some basic assumptions about The phases which<br>
form. By such a procedure, it was concluded that an alloy having the desired level of<br>
creep strength for second and third stage nozzles should contain about 18 volume<br>
percent or more of the gamma-prime phase. However, other properties important to<br>
gas turbine engine nozzles, such as weldability, fatigue life, capability, metallurgical<br>
stability and oxidation resistance, cannot be predicted from amounts of these and<br>
other elements.<br>
Two alloys having the approximate chemistries set forth in Table I below were<br>
formulated and cast during the investigation. Castings of the GTD-222 alloy were<br>
also prepared having the following approximate chemistry by weight: 19% cobalt,<br>
about 22.5% chromium, about 2% tungsten, about 1.2% aluminum, about 2.3%<br>
titanium, about 0.8% columbium, about 1% tantalum, about 0.008% boron, about<br>
0.022% zirconium, about 0.1% carbon, with the balance essentially nickel and<br>
incidental impurities. Castings of each alloy underwent a heat treatment cycle that<br>
entailed a solution treatment at about 2100°F (about 1150°C) for about two hours,<br>
followed by aging at about 1475°F (about 800°C) for about eight hours. The<br>
specimens were then machined from the castings in a conventional manner.<br>
The above alloying levels were selected to evaluate the effect of substituting<br>
columbium for tantalum, but otherwise were intended to retain the GTD-222<br>
composition. Tensile properties of the alloys were determined with standard smooth<br>
bar specimens. The normalized data are summarized in Figures 1. 2 and 3, in which<br>
"222 baseline. Average" plots the historical average of GTD-222 for the particular<br>
property, "222Cb-Supplier 1" designates data for the B1 specimens, and "222Cb-<br>
Supplier 2" designates data for the B2 specimens. Also evaluated was a gas turbine<br>
engine nozzle cast from the same alloy as the B1 specimens. The data indicate that<br>
the tensile strength of the B1 and B2 specimens was about three to about five percent<br>
lower than the GTD-222 baseline, but ductility was much higher in the B1 and B2<br>
specimens - on the order of about 30% to 40% higher. The high ductility and similar<br>
tensile strength of the B1 and B2 alloys compared with GTD-222 indicated that the<br>
experimental alloys might be suitable alternatives to GTD-222.<br>
Figures 4 and 5 are graphs plotting low cycle fatigue (LCF) life at 1400°F (about<br>
760°C) and 1600°F (about 870°C), respectively, for the B1 and B2 alloys and GTD-<br>
222. In both tests, 0.25 inch (about 8.2 mm) bars were cycled to crack initiation. In<br>
Figure 4. 3s ("3S") is also plotted for the evaluated alloys (averaged) as well as GTD-<br>
222. The 3s plot indicates that the LCF life of the B1 and B2 alloys at 1400°F was<br>
essentially the same as the GTD-222 baseline at strain levels above about 0.5%, but<br>
was lower by about 15% to 25% at strains less than 0.5%. In Figure 5, the data for the<br>
1600°F LCF test evidence that the B1 and B2 alloys exhibited essentially the same<br>
LCF life as GTD-222.<br>
Figure 6 is a graph plotting creep life for the B1 and B2 alloys and GTD-222 at a<br>
strain level of about 0.5% and temperatures of about 1450°F (about 790°C) and<br>
1600°F (about 870°C). At the 1450°F test temperature, the B1 and B2 alloys<br>
exhibited a creep life that was essentially the same as GTD-222. At the 1600°F test<br>
temperature, the short-term life of the B1 and B2 alloys was lower than GTD-222 as<br>
predicted by the tensile data. However, Figure 6 evidences that the long-term creep<br>
life of the B1 and B2 alloys is essentially the same as GTD-222.<br>
Additional tests were performed on the B1 and B2 alloys to compare various other<br>
properties to GTD-222. Such tests included high cycle fatigue (HCF) and low cycle<br>
fatigue (LCF) testing, oxidation resistance, weldability. castability, diffusion coating<br>
characteristics, and physical properties. In all of these investigations, the properties of<br>
the B1 and B2 alloys were essentially identical to that of the GTD-222 baseline, with<br>
the exception of weldability in which the B1 and B2 alloys were surprisingly found to<br>
exhibit slightly better weldability than GTD-222 in terms of resistance to cracking.<br>
Furthermore, the LCF life of TIG welded joints in the B1 and B2 alloys was<br>
determined to be about two times longer than that of TIG welded joints formed in<br>
GTD-222, which was consistent with the results of the weldability study.<br>
On the basis of the above, an alloy having the broad, preferred and nominal<br>
compositions (by weight) and gamma prime content (by volume) summarized in<br>
Table II is believed to have properties comparable to GTD-222 and therefore suitable<br>
for use as the alloy for the latter stage nozzles of a gas turbine engine, as well as other<br>
applications in which similar properties are required.<br>
The formula Cb+0.508Ta was derived to maintain a constant atomic percent of<br>
combined tantalum and columbium in the alloy, though with a clear preference for<br>
columbium. Tantalum is preferably kept below levels allowed in GTD-222. and more<br>
preferably is entirely omitted from the alloy in view of the investigation reported<br>
above. The ranges established for columbium are believed to be necessary to<br>
compensate for the absence or reduced level of tantalum in order to maintain the<br>
properties desired for the alloy and exhibited by alloys B1 and B2 during the<br>
investigation. It is believed that the alloy identified above in Table II can be<br>
satisfactorily heat treated using the treatment described above, though conventional<br>
heat treatments adapted for nickel-base alloys could also be used.<br>
While the invention has been described in terms of a preferred embodiment, it is<br>
apparent that other forms could be adopted by one skilled in the art. Therefore, the<br>
scope of the invention is to be limited only by the following claims.<br>
