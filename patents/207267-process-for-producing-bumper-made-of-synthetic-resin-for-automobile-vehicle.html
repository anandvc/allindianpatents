PROCESS FOR PRODUCING BUMPER MADE OF SYNTHETIC RESIN FOR AUTOMOBILE VEHICLE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for producing a bumper made of a synthetic resin for an automobile vehicle, and particularly, to an improvement in a process for producing a bumper made of a synthetic resin for an automobile vehicle and having a sandwich structure comprised of a core and an outer layer covering the core, the process including a first step of injecting an outer layer forming material into a bumper forming cavity through a gate in a mold, and a second step of injecting a core forming material to allow the core forming material to flow into the outer layer forming material existing in the gate and the cavity and to allow the outer layer and core forming materials to flow within the cavity. DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
In the prior art, such a bumper includes a bumper main portion extending laterally from a central portion of a vehicle body, and a pair of bumper sides connected to opposite ends of the bumper main portion, and has a substantially uniform thickness in its entirety.<br>
Therefore, the cavity in the mold includes a main area for forming the bumper main portion, and a pair of side areas for forming the pair of bumper sides, and has a uniform distance<br><br>
in its entirety depending upon the thickness of the bumper. The gate opens, for example, into a section for forming an upper portion of the bumper main portion in the main area.<br>
In such a producing process, while the outer layer forming material is flowing within the cavity, the core forming material is allowed to flow into the outer layer forming material. However, after the outer layer forming material is filled into the cavity to stop its flowing, it is difficult to allow the core forming material to flow into the outer layer forming material.<br>
If the distance of the cavity is set substantially constant under such a situation as in the prior art, the following problem is encountered: a large difference is produced between the time taken for the outer layer forming material injected into the cavity at the first step to be filled in the main area into which the gate opens, and the time taken for such outer layer forming material to be filled in each of the side areas spaced apart from the gate. Due to this, it is difficult to produce a bumper having a sandwich structure in its entirety,<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a producing process of the above-described type, which is capable of producing a bumper of a synthetic resin having a sandwich structure in its entirety.<br><br>
To achieve the above object, according to the present invention, there is provided a process for producing a bumper made of a synthetic resin for an automobile vehicle and having a sandwich structure comprised of a core and an outer layer covering the core, the process comprising: a first step of injecting an outer layer forming material into a bumper forming cavity through a gate in a metal mold, the bumper forming cavity including a main area for forming a bumper main portion extending laterally from a central portion of a vehicle body, and a pair of side areas for forming a pair of bumper sides continuously formed to opposite ends of the bumper main portion, the main area being comprised of a first section for forming an upper portion of the bumper main portion, and a second section for forming a lower portion of the bumper main portion, the metal mold having relations, da &gt; d1 and d3 &gt; d2 established between a distance d1 determining the bumper thickness of the first section, a distance d2 determining the bumper thickness of the second section and a distance da determining the bumper thickness of each of the side areas, and the gate opening into the first section; and a second step of injecting a core forming material to allow the core forming material to flow into the outer layer forming material existing in the gate and the cavity and to allow the outer layer and core forming materials to flow to the cavity.<br>
If the distances of the cavity are set and the gate is disposed in the above manner, the outer layer forming material<br><br>
injected into the cavity at the first step flows from the first section into the second section of the main area and also actively flow into the opposite side areas of a small resistance to the flowing.<br>
Thus, the times taken for the filling of the outer layer forming material into the main area and the side areas to be completed are substantially equal to each other and moreover, such time is hastened in each of the side areas. Before the completion of the filling of the outer layer forming material, the core forming material can be allowed to flow into the flowing outer layer forming material, thereby producing a bumper having a sandwich structure in its entirety.<br>
Thus, a bumper made of a synthetic resin for an automobile vehicle and having a sandwich structure and a good quality can be produced by using the mold specified in the above manner.<br>
The above and other objects, features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following description of a preferred embodiment taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>

DETAILED DESCIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
The present invention will now be described by way of preferred embodiments with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
Referring to Fig.l, a bumper 1 made of a synthetic resin having a sandwich structure is mounted to a front portion of a vehicle body B of an automobile vehicle A. The sandwich structure includes a core 2 and an outer layer covering the core 2, as shown in Figs.2 and 3.<br>
The bumper includes a main bumper portion 41 extending laterally from a central portion a of a vehicle body, and a pair of bumper side portions 42 continuously formed to opposite ends of the bumper main portion 41.<br>
As best shown in Figs.l and 2, the bumper main portion 41 includes an upper portion 4a and a lower portion 4b. For the forming reason, the thickness t1 of the upper portion 4a<br><br>
is larger than the thickness ta of the lower portion 4b (t1 &gt; tz) . Likewise, for the forming reason, the thickness t3 of each bumper side portion 42 is larger than the thickness t1 of the upper portion 4a (t3  &gt;  t1) .<br>
Further, if a sectional factor of the bumper main portion 4i is represented by Zi, and the sectional factor of the bumper side portion 42 is represented by Z2, a relation, Z1 &gt; Z3 is established between both the sectional factors Z1 and Z2.<br>
If the bumper is constructed in the above manner, even if the main bumper portion 41 includes the lower portion 4b having the smaller thickness, the rigidity of the bumper main portion 41 can be insured, because it has upper and lower mounting portions 51 and bz for mounting to the vehicle body B. On the other hand, the rigidity of each of the bumper side portions 42 having no mounting portion for mounting to the vehicle body 3 is insured as a result of an increase in thickness thereof. The core 2 is formed from a main material which is produced by pulverizing a recovered bumper formed using a polypropylene (PP) modified by an ethylene-propylene rubber (EPR) and having a thermoplastic synthetic resin coating on a surface . The outer layer 3 is formed from, a main material which is a polypropylene modified by an ethylene-propylene rubber.<br>
Referring to Figs .4 and 5, an injection molding apparatus 6 used for producing the bumper 1 includes a first injection unit 8 having a screw 7 to inject an outer layer forming material, a second injection screw 10 having a screw 9 to inject a core<br><br>
forming material, a nozzle 11 which connects both the injection units 8 and 10 to each other, a hot runner block 12 connected to the nozzle 11, and a split metal mole 13 detachably mounted to the hot runner block 12.<br>
A supply passage 14 in the nozzle 11 communicates with a runner 16i in the metal mole 13 through a hot runner 15, and a film gate (gate) I62 extending from the runner I61 communicates with a bumper forming cavity 17 .  In Figures, Hi is a band heater, and H2 is a cartridge heater.<br>
The metal mole 13 includes a stationary die 131 on the hot runner block 12, and a plurality of movable dies 132 to 134 movable toward and away from the stationary die 131. The cavity 17 in the metal mole 13 includes a main area 171 for forming the main bumper portion 41, and a pair of side areas 172 for forming the pair of bumper side portions 42.<br>
The main area 171 includes a first section 17a for forming the upper portion 4a of the main bumper portion 41, and a second section 17b for forming the lower portion 4b of the main bumper portion 41.<br>
If a distance determining the bumper thickness t1 of the first section 17a is represented by d1, and a distance determining the bumper thickness t2 of the second section 17b s represented by d2, a relation, d1 &gt; d2 is established. If a distance determining the bumper thickness ta of the side area 172 is represented by d3, a relation, d3 &gt; d1 is established between the distance d3 and the distance d1 of the first section<br><br>
17a. Therefore, d3 &gt; d1 and d3 &gt; d2-<br>
The film gate I62 opens into an end of the first section 17a of the main area 171. In this case, as shown in Fig.l, the runner I61 extends over the laterally substantially entire length of the main bumper portion 4i, and the film gate I62 has substantially the same length as the runner 161.<br>
A hollow outer needle 18 and a solid inner needle 19 are disposed concentrically within the nozzle 11, In the outer needle 18, a valve portion 20 at a tip end of the needle 18 is opposed to the supply passage 14, and a piston 21 is provided at a base end of the needle 18 and slidably received in a cylinder 22. The piston 21 and the cylinder 22 constitute a supply passage opening/closing mechanism 23, In the inner needle 19, a valve portion 24 at a tip end is opposed to a valve bore 25 formed in the valve portion 20 of the outer needle 18, and a piston 26 is provided at a base end and slidably received in a cylinder 27 formed at the base end of the outer needle 18. The piston 2 6 and the cylinder 27 constitute a valve bore opening/closing mechanism 28.<br>
The outer needle 18 has a tapered outer peripheral surface connected to the valve portion 20, and an outer passage 29 is formed between the tapered outer peripheral surface and an inner peripheral surface of the nozzle 11. The outer passage 29 is adapted to communicate at one end thereof with the supply passage 14 and at the other end thereof with the first injection unit 8 through a through-hole 30 in the nozzle 11. The outer needle<br><br>
18 has a straight outer peripheral surface at its base end, so that the through-hole 30 can be closed by such outer peripheral surface.<br>
The inner needle 19 has a tapered outer peripheral surface connected to the valve portion 24 thereof, and an inner passage 31 is formed between such tapered outer peripheral surface and the inner peripheral surface of the outer needle 18. The inner passage 31 is adapted to communicate at one end thereof with the valve bore 25 and at the other end thereof with the second injection unit 10 through through-holes 32 and 33 in the outer needle 18 and the nozzle 11, The inner needle 19 has a straight outer peripheral surface at its base end, so that the through-hole 32 can be closed by such outer peripheral surface. A specific example of the production of the bumper 3 using the injection molding apparatus 6 will be described below.<br>
Referring to Figs.1 to 3, the dimensions of portions of the bumper 1 are as follows: on the basis of the vehicle body B, the lateral length b of the bumper main portion 4i == 1700 mm; the longitudinal length c of each bumper side portion 42 = 550 mm, the height e of the upper portion 4a = 320 mm; the height £ of the lower portion 4b = 320 mm; the height g, of each bumper side portion 42 - 300 mm; the thickness t1 of the upper portion 4a = 4 mm; the thickness t2 of the lower portion 4b = 3 mm; the thickness t3 of each bumper side portion 42 = 5 mm. In the bumper 3, the sectional factor Z2 of the bumper main portion 42 = 289.0, and the sectional factor Z2 of each bumper<br><br>
side portion 42 = 90.4 (thus, Z1 &gt; Z2) .<br>
The dimensions of portions of the cavity 17 are determined depending upon the shape of the bumper 1.  In this case, the lateral length h of the gates I62 = 1200 mm, and the longitudinal length k = 2 mm. A. Preparation of core forming material<br>
A recovered bumper molded using a polypropylene modified by an ethylene-propylene rubber and having a two-pack urethane coating on a surface thereof was selected. The composition of the recovered bumper is as follows:<br>
Polypropylene	64 % by weight<br>
Ethylene-propylene rubber    28 % by weight<br>
Talc	7 % by weight<br>
Coating	1 % by weight<br>
The recovered bumper was thrown into a pulverizer and pulverized therein. Then, the pulverized material was thrown into and molten and kneaded in a granulator. The resulting molten/kneaded material was passed through a filter of 80 to 100 mesh, whereby large particles were removed. Thereafter, the molten/kneaded material was passed through a capillary having an inside diameter of 1 mm to form a linear material. The linear material was cut into a length of 1 to several mm to provide a pellet-like core forming material. B. Preparation of outer layer forming material A mixture including<br><br>
Polypropylene	63 % by weight<br>
Ethylene-propylene rubber    30 % by weight<br>
Talc	7 % by weight<br>
to provide the same composition as the recovered bumper (however, the coating is excluded) was thrown into the granulator and subjected to the same procedure as in the above-described item A to produce a pellet-like outer later forming material* C. Production of bumper<br>
(i) In Fig. 4, the outer layer forming material was placed into the first injection unit 8 and maintained in a molten state of<br>
210°C. The core forming material was placed into the second<br>
injection unit 10 and maintained in a molten state of 200°C. The preheating temperatures of the stationary die 131 and the movable dies 132 to 134 are 40°C and 50°C, respectively.<br>
(ii) At a first step, in a condition in which the outer passage 29 was in a connected state and the inner passage 31 was in a disconnected state, the outer layer forming material Mi was injected into the bumper forming cavity 17 in the metal mole 13 through the supply passage 14, the hot runner 15, the runner 161 and the film gate I62 under operation of the first injection unit 8, as shown in Fig.6.<br>
(iii) At a second step, a portion of the outer passage 29 adjacent the supply passage 14 was throttled by the valve portion 20 under operation of the first injection unit 8, as shown in Fig. 7,  In a condition in which the inner passage 31 was in a<br><br>
12<br>
connected state, the core forming material M2 was injected under operation of the second injection unit 10, whereby the core forming material M2 was allowed to flow into the outer layer forming material M1 within the supply passage 14, the hot runner 15, the runner I61, the film gate I62 and the cavity 17, and the outer layer and core forming materials M1 and M2 were allowed to flow within the cavity 17 . Then, the operation of the second injection unit 10 was stopped.<br>
(iv) At a third step, as shown in Fig. 8, in the condition in which the outer passage 29 was in the connected state and the inner passage 31 was in the disconnected state, the outer layer and core forming materials Mi and M? of a double structure existing within the supply passage 14, the hot runner 15, the runner I61 and the film, gate I62 were pushed into the cavity 17 by the outer layer forming material M1 under operation of the first injection unit 8, thereby forming the core 4 and the outer layer 5. Then, the operation of the first injection unit 8 was stopped.<br>
(v) The metal mole 13 was moved away from the hot runner block 12 and then, the mold opening was conducted to provide a bumper 1.<br>
After the above-described producing process, the outer layer forming material M1 is retained in a molten state within the hot runner 15 and hence, the molding of the bumper 3 can be carried out continuously.<br><br>
Table 1 shows the injection time and the injection speed for the outer layer forming material M1 and the core forming material M2 relating to the first, second and third steps in the production of the bumper 1.<br><br>
Fig, 9 is based on Table 1 and show the relationship between the injection time and the injection speed. In this case, the injection speed was controlled at two stages for the outer layer forming material M1 at the first step; at one stage for the core forming material M2 and at three stages for the outer layer forming material Mi at the second step; and at one stage for the outer layer forming material M1 at the third step.<br>
In the metal mole 13, if the distances d1, d2 and d3 in the cavity 17 and the film gate I62 is disposed in the above manner, the outer layer forming material M1 injected into the cavity 17 at the first step reaches the first section 17a of the main area 171 in an early stage, because the distance d1 of the first section 17a is relatively wide and near the film<br><br>
gate I62, but because the distance d2 of the filling of the outer layer forming material M1 in the second section 17b is correspondingly retarded. This promotes the flowing of the outer layer forming material M1 into both the side areas 172 of a small resistance to the flowing.<br>
On the other hand, in each of the side areas 172, the flowing of the outer layer forming material M1 into and within the side areas 172 with the prom.otion of the flowing is activated, because of the relatively wide distance da of the side areas 172, and the filling of the outer layer forming material M1 into each of the side areas 172 is hastened, because the ends of the film gate I62 are located in the vicinity of the side areas 172. Thus, the times taken for the filling of the outer layer forming material M1 into the main area 171 and into the side areas 172 to be completed are substantially equal to each other, and moreover, such times in the side areas 172 are hastened. Therefore, before completion of the filling of the outer layer forming material M1, the core forming material M2 can be allowed to sufficiently flow into the flowing outer layer forming material M1 in the main area 171 and the side areas 172.<br>
If the injection speed Ve of the core forming material M2 at the second step is set higher than the injection speeds Va and Vb of the outer layer forming material M1 at the first step, as shown in Fig. 9, a front portion of the core forming material in the flowing direction can be allowed to exist within the front portion of the outer layer forming material M1 in the<br><br>
flowing direction at a time point when a front portion of the outer layer forming material M1 in the flowing direction reaches near the terminal end of the second section 17b, as shown in Fig. 7. In this case, if the injection speeds Vb, Vc and Vd of the outer layer forming material M1 are set lower than the highest injection speed Va at the first step, the difference between the inj ection speeds of the materials M1 and M2 can be increased, even if the injection speed Ve of the core forming material M2 is less high.<br>
If the injection speed Vd of the outer layer forming material M1 at the third step is set at a value equal to or lower than the final injection speed Vc of the outer layer forming material M1 at the second step, e.g., at Vd in the production of this bumper 1, the outer layer forming material M1 cannot flow into the core forming material M2 at the third step, whereby the film gate communication portion of the bumper 1 can be formed from only the outer layer forming material M1.<br>
In the above manner, the bumper 1 having the sandwich structure in its entirety could be produced. In this bumper 1, the filling rate of the core forming material M2 prepared from the recovered bumper is high, which is effective for providing a reduction in producing cost of the bumper 1 and a resources saving.<br>
For comparison, an attempt was made to produce a bumper 1 having thicknesses of portions set at 4 mm. The result made clear that the core forming material M2 did not flow into the<br><br>
lower portion 4b of the bumper main portion 41 and into the terminal ends of the bumper side portions 42-<br>
Table 2 shows the times taken for the front portion of the outer layer forming material M1 in the flowing direction to reach the end walls of the portions of the cavity 17.<br><br>
As can be seen from Table 2, in the present embodiment, time periods required by the outer payer forming material M1 to reach each of the end walls of the second section and each side area are close to each other, but in the comparative example, such time periods are largely different from each other.<br>
In addition to the those described above, the outer layer forming material M1 which may be used for the production of the bumper 1 includes the following examples: [Composition example 1]<br>
Polypropylene	63 % by weight<br>
Ethylene-propylene rubber      30 % by weight<br>
Talc	7 % by weight<br>
Weather-resistant stabilizer 1 phr<br>
Ultraviolet light absorber 1 phr<br>
Carbon black (pigment)	3 phr<br><br>
Coatability enhancing modifier    3 phr [Composition example 2]<br>
Polypropylene	60 % by weight<br>
Ethylene-propylene rubber      30 % by weight<br>
Talc	10 % by weight<br>
Weather-resistant stabilizer     1 phr<br>
Ultraviolet light absorber       1 phr<br>
Carbon black (pigment)	3 phr<br>
Coatability enhancing modifier    3 phr<br>
In addition to those described above, the core forming material M2 which may be used for the production of the bumper 1 includes the following examples:<br>
(1)	A forming material consisting of 93 % by weight of a<br>
combination of a polypropylene and 7 % by weight of talc. In<br>
this case, the polypropylene contains 30 % by weight of a<br>
ethylene-propylene based rubber simultaneously synthesized at<br>
a step of polymerization of the polypropylene. The talc was<br>
added to the polypropylene at a final step of the synthesis of<br>
the polypropylene. This forming material is more inexpensive<br>
than a forming material containing a polypropylene and an<br>
ethylene-propylene rubber separately produced and blended.<br>
(2)	A forming material containing the following components:<br>
Polypropylene	60 % by weight<br>
Ethylene-propylene rubber   30 % by weight<br>
Talc	10 % by weight<br><br><br><br>
