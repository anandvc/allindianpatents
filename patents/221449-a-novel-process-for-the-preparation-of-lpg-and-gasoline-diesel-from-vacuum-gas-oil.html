				<td>This invention relates to a novel process for the preparation of LPG and gasoline &amp; diesel from vacuum gas oil. In particular, the invention relates to a process for the cracking of hydrocarbon concentrates i.e. straight chain paraffins, iso+cycloparaffins and monoaromatics into LPG, gasoline and diesel. The invention more specifically relates to a process for the cracking of hydrocarbon concentrates in terms of hydrocarbon types i.e., straight chain paraffins, iso + cyclo paraffins and monoaromatics derived from Bombay high vacuum gas oil (VGO) of the hydrocarbon types given in Table-1 in presence of proven commercial cracking catalyst of the characteristics given in Table-2 into high value products like LPG, gasoline and diesel.<br>
Fluidized Catalytic Cracking (FCC) has proven to be a major process to convert vacuum distillates and residues into valuable products such as gasoline, diesel and LPG. FCC in its modern version is not only providing diesel and high octane gasoline, it is also meeting other challenges by providing building blocks for petrochemicals and antiknock extenders (MTBE, TAME, ETBE in the form of propylene, isobutylene and isomylene. Indian FCC Units are specifically geared to maximize light cycle oil (LCO) a diesel blending component.<br>
Projections of fuels demand in India shows that gasoline will become surplus in later years as refinery throughputs are increased. For the same period, diesel is expected to grow 37% and LPG consumption 41%. Therefore, values of products for Indian refiners increase continuously from distillate through gasoline to more olefinic LPG. Presently there is great pressure on FCC units to maximize middle distillates and olefmic LPG. The refiner can maximize these streams by using a novel catalyst, optimising process parameters within unit constraints and, hardware modifications through<br>
combined technologies as well as by revamp of existing units. The other variable i.e. the feedstocks characteristics can also influence the product yields and its pattern dramatically. The feedstock composition interms of hydrocarbon type distribution, such as straight-chain, iso+cycloparaffins and aromatics can completely alter the product slate. In cracking reactions a desired product can be maximized by using a feedstock having maximum number of precursors which will endup in forming that particular product. Refineries are generally faced with difficulties in the availability of feedstocks with desirable hydrocarbon types distribution. Due to this the refiners prefer to look for other variables such as selection of a right type of catalyst, hardwares and process parameters optimisation to suit the crackability of feedstocks to maximise a particular product in greater demand. To overcome these problems, the present invention suggests the use of hydrocarbon concentrates in terms of hydrocarbon types derived from the vacuum gas oil by the separation scheme presented in the following section. Thus the present invention provides a process for the cracking of hydrocarbon concentrates with identified and well defined requirements of hardwares and process parameters to maximise a particular product in greater demand. SEPARATION SCHEME<br>
A novel separation scheme which is experimentally convenient, less time consuming, repeatable and gives compound types with no chemical alteration has been used for the separation of hydrocarbon types from VGO. The well known SARA (saturates, aromatics, resins and asphaltenes) method was employed. Hydrocarbon were further separated into saturate and various aromatic concentrates on alumina. Saturates<br>
were further fractionated into normal paraffins and iso-paraffins plus cyclo paraffins using molecular sieve 5A°.<br>
The present invention provides a process for the conversion of various hydrocarbon concentrates prepared by using a separation scheme, discussed above into distillates and LPG fuel using commercially proven cracking catalyst. The novelty of the process lies in the cracking of hydrocarbon concentrates separated from vacuum gas oil, which is not known in the prior art.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a novel process for the preparation of LPG and gasoline &amp; diesel from vacuum gas oil which comprises<br>
(a)	separating vacuum gas oil into saturated compounds and aromatic compounds by<br>
well known SARA (saturates, aromatics, resins and asphalenes) method,<br>
(b)	fractionating the components into saturates and aromatics on alumina, then<br>
separating saturates in to normal paraffins, iso-paraffins &amp; cyclo paraffins using<br>
molecular sieve 5 A° by known methods,<br>
(c)	heating different fractions obtained in step (b)  at a temperature in the range of<br>
100-150°C and injected through a preheater maintained at a temperature of 600°C<br>
and cracked in a metallic reactor in presence of zeolitic cracking catalyst such as<br>
herein described at temperature 450-482°C at a weight hourly space velocity in<br>
the range of 16-160 h-1 and a reaction time of 50-75 seconds,<br>
(d)	collecting the resultant liquid product of step (c ) i. e. agasoline &amp; diesel in an ice<br>
cold receiver, regenerating the coke laid on catalyst surface at 650°C in a stream<br>
or air (50cm3 mm-1) for 20-40 minutes till the carbon dioxide content of outgoing<br>
flue gas was less than 0.1%.<br>
According to further embodiment of the invention catalyst used is zeolitic commercial cracking catalyst with surface area 90-100 m2/g, zeolite content 10-15%, rare earth loading with 1.25-1.5 %, pore volume 0.15-0.20 ml/g, unit cell size with 24.34 to 24.38 and acidity mmoles/g of 0.33 to 0.35. The reaction time ranges preferably 50-75 sec.<br>

DETAILS OF CONVERSION PROCESS<br>
The feed i.e. various hydrocarbon concentrates (1.33 gm ± 0.03) were heated in the range of 100-150°C and injected through a preheater (600°C) to the metallic reactor packed with 4 grams of catalyst and heated to 450- 482°C. After the reaction of the feed with the catalyst, product in the form of gas, liquid and coke is obtained. The liquid product was collected in an ice cooled receiver and analyzed by simulated distillation gas chromatograph. The gaseous products were analyzed by gas chromatography using squalane column at ambient temperature. The coke laden catalyst was regenerated at 650°C in a stream of air (50 cm3 min-1) for about 30 minutes till the carbon dioxide content of outgoing flue gas was less than 0.1%.<br>
Cracked products consists of the following useful products apart from others such as dry gas (DG) (H2, H2S, CH4, C2H6 and C2H4) and clarified oil regarded as unconverted and amount of material on distillation curve boiling above 370°C.<br>
LPG<br>
Comprises C3H8, C3H6, C4H10, C4H8 which are primary products important as domestic fuel and feedstock to downstream petrochemical industry. Gasoline<br>
Product which is quantitated as the amount of C5+ material in the reactor effluent gas plus the amount of liquid boiling upto 150°C on the distillation curve of effluent liquid. TCO<br>
Total cycle oil product, the yield is determined from distillation curve within the boiling range 150-370°C, a useful diesel blending component.<br>
Conversion<br>
Defined as fraction boiling below 216°C, including DG and coke yield. The following examples illustrates the process of invention and should not be construed to limit the scope of present invention.<br>
Example-1<br>

Data from a typical experiment having catalyst to feed ratio of 4.8, reaction temperature 482°C and reaction time of 75 seconds showed the following product selectivities.<br>
