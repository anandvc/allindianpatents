new class of flame retardants has been found,  namelv<br>
■organonitrogen  compounds  belonging  to  the  triazine<br>
family,  such as melamine or derivatives thereof,  for<br>
instance melamine cyanurate and more recently melamine<br>
phosphates, polyphosphates and pyrophosphates.<br>
The advantage of this! latter class of flame retardants<br>
lies j m the fact that the cornpounds' concerned do not<br>
contaiin any halogens or phosphorus. Specifically, flame<br>
\	ij<br>
retardants containing! halogens or red phosphorus mav<br>
If	'!<br>
generate toxic gases 6r vapors during the combust ion of<br>

certa'in  rnelamine-based  compounds  needed  to  obtain<br>

satisfactory flame retardancv are verv high, especiallv<br>
jl	!<br>
for compositions containing reinforcing fillers in the<br>
form|of fibers such as glass fibers, mineral fillers or heaty.stable organic \ fibers. The . cost of these compositions  due  to  the  large  amounts  of  certain<br>
melaiiiine-based    compounds,     especially    melamine<br>
\l<br>
polyphosphates,     makes    their    commercialization<br>
)\	I<br>
unattractive.  Furthermore,  this high concentration of<br>
jl	'i<br>
melamine   compounds \     presents   certain   drawbacks,<br>
especially during the manufacture of the composition, such! as  the  production  of  vapor  of  the  melamine<br>

 <br>
of<br>
mel pos<br>
thai: a. polyamide composition comprising a low content<br>
novolac resin and a relatively low content of amine cyanurate, i' a rnelamine derivative, makes it sible to obtain ^optimal results in terms of flame<br>
retardancy and water? uptake. Contrary to what was known hitherto,  novolac  resin does  not  impair  the  flame-rebardancy  properties  of  the  polyamide  composition ;omprising a rnelamine derivative,<br>
:)<br>
 <br>
Thos   Ann 1 leant<br>
 <br>
has<br>
 <br>
furthermore'<br>
 <br>
found,<br>
 <br>
entirely<br>
 <br>
3urp novo syne act<br>
 <br>
risirialv,  that  in  the  polvamide  composition  the lac   resin   and'  the   me 1 amine   cyanurate   act rgistically,  whereas  these two compounds  usually in  different  manners   as   flame   renardants.<br>
 <br>
Specifically,  novolac resin is known to be an aqent<br>
 <br>
t hat-<br>
 <br>
participates in - the formation ot a carbon layer<br>
 <br>
(char) that isolates the polyamide matrix from the flame. In contrast, melamlne cyanurate is known to act on the controlled breaking of the polvamide chains, causing  the  formation  of  drops  of molten  polvamide<br>
(dripping), which thus prevents propagation of the combustion.<br>
 <br>
The<br>
pol<br>
present invention thus relates to the use,  in a amide  matrix,  ;of  a  combination  of  mefamine<br>
cyarijurate and of novolac resin as, or in relation with, a flame   retardaiit.<br>
 <br>
One<br>
base-and<br>
rel The<br>
subject of the present invention is a polyamide-'d composition comprising at least: : from 0.1%   to 15% by weight of melamine cyanurate;<br>
f rom  0.1%  to  5%  by  weight  of  novolac.  resin; tive to the total weight of the composition.<br>
polvaniide is chosen    from the group comprising the<br>
polyamides obtained by polycondensation of a linear dicarboxylie acid with a linear or cyclic diamine, such as PA 6.6, PA 6.10, PA 6.12, PA 12.12, PA 4.6 or MXD 6, or between' an arornafic dicarboxylic acid and a linear or '} aromatic  diamine,  such  as  polyterephthalamides,<br>
poivisophthalamides,	polyaramides,    and    polymers<br>
obtained by polycondensation  of  an amino  acid  with itself,  the amino -acid possibly being  generated by<br>
hw-nlniwHr- onenina of a   lactam ring, for instance PA 6,<br>
 <br>
PA 7|, PA 11 and PA 12.<br>
The<br>
composition  of  the  invention mav  also  comprise copojly amides   derived   especially   from   the   above<br>
polyarnides,   or  mixtures  of  these  polyarnides  or copolyamides.<br>
The '  preferred   polyarnides	are   polyhexarnethylene<br>
adipamide,  polycaprolactam or	copolymers and mixtures<br>
between      polyhexarnethylene	adipamide      and<br>
po1y c a p r o1a c t am.<br>
Use is generally made of polyarnides whose molecular weights  are  suited  to  injection-molding  processes,<br>
although polyarnides ,;of.     lower viscosity may also be used .<br>
The  polyamide  matrix  may  especially  be  a  polymer comprising star or H- macromolecuiar chains and,  where<br>
appropriate,  linear ., macromolecuiar  chains.  Polymers<br>
comprising such star or H macromolecuiar chains are<br>
described,  for  example,  in documents  FR  2 7 4 3  0"?7,<br>

and EP 0 3 32 14 9.<br>
According to another particular variant of the invention, the polyamide matrix of the invention may be a polymer of statistical tree type, preferably a copolyamide having a statistical tree structure. These copolyamides of statistical tree structure and the process for obtaining them are especially described in document WO 9 9/03909.
