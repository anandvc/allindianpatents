COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See section 10 and rule 13)<br>
1.	TITLE OF THE INVENTION:<br>
"TELMISARTAN AND HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE COMPOSITION"<br>
2.	APPLICANT (S):<br>
(a) NAME: FDC Limited<br>
(b)NATIONALITY: Indian company incorporated under the Companies Act 1956<br>
(c) ADDRESS: 142-48, S.V. Road, Jogeshwari (West), Mumbai - 400 102, Maharashtra, India.<br>
3.	PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION:<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
 <br>
Field of the invention:<br>
The present invention is directed to a solid oral pharmaceutical composition comprising of angiotensin II receptor antagonist telmisartan or a salt thereof and thiazide diuretic hydrochlorothiazide. The invention further provides a method of producing such compositions.<br>
Background and prior art:<br>
Telmisartan is a non-peptide angiotensin II receptor antagonist. Its chemical name is 4'-[2-n-propyl-4-methyl-6-(l-methyLbenzimidazol-2-yl)-benzimida2ol-l-ylmethyl]-biphenyl-2-carboxylic acid. The molecular structure of Telmisartan is represented as:<br>
 <br>
Angiotensin II receptor blockers, which cause blood vessels to relax, has proven to be effective in lowering both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Telmisartan is a type of angiotensin II receptor blocker that is prescribed for the treatment of high blood pressure. Telmisartan is manufactured and supplied in its free acid form. It is characterized by very poor solubility in aqueous systems at the physiological pH range of the gastro-intestinal tract between pH 1 to 7.<br>
Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) is a first-line and widely prescribed diuretic, representative of the benzothiadiazine class sulfonamide derivatives, commonly known as thiazides. The thiazide class acts by inhibiting the kidneys' ability to retain water, which inturn decreases blood return to the heart and cardiac output, and by other mechanisms, is believed to<br>
 <br>
lower peripheral vascular resistance. The chemical name of hydrochlorothiazide is 6-chloro-1,1 -dioxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-1,2,4-benzothiadiazine-7-sulfonamide. The molecular structure of Hydrochlorothiazide is represented as<br>
 <br>
Hypertension is a multifactorial disease. The increased blood pressure can be reduced in several ways, and one of the commonest ways is by blocking the actions of angiotensin-U. Telmisartan is an angiotensin recentor blocker. The drug, acts by blocking the Angiotensin-Il receptor. Several clinical studies have shown Telmisartan to be safe and effective in the treatment of hypertension. However, over a period of time the controlled blood pressure starts showing 'escape' due to other compensatory mechanisms coming into play. At this point of time the physician has two options-either to increase the dose of antihypertensive or to use the combination. Increasing the dose of any antihypertensive including Telmisartan would lead to increased incidence of adverse effects, morbidity and mortality which would result into treatment failure. Combination of two antihypertensives acting by different mechanisms would obviate the need of increasing the dose, thus achieving blood pressure control using lower doses of the drug. Hydrochlorothiazide is a time tested diuretic. Clinical experience has shown hydrochlorothiazide to be highly effective in the treatment of hypertension. Both Telmisartan and Hydrochlorothiazide reduce blood pressure by different mechanisms. Several clinical trials have shown benefit of combination of Telmisartan and Hydrochlorothiazide. Telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide combination has complementary mechanism like reduction of peripheral resistance with angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and reduction of fluid volume with diuretics. ARB counteracts reactive increase in blood pressure related to diuretic induced rennin secretion; and<br>
 <br>
ameliorates diuretic induced potassium depletion. This combination is well tolerated and has fewer metabolic disturbances.<br>
WO2003059327 describes bilayer pharmaceutical tablet comprising first layer formulated for immediate release of telmisartan from a dissolving tablet matrix which contains telmisartan in substantially amorphous form and a second layer formulated for immediate release of a diuretic hydrochlorothiazide from a fast disintegrating tablet matrix. However, tablets with fast disintegrating matrix tend to be hygroscopic and therefore, need to be packaged using moisture proof packaging materials.<br>
CN101134032 describes compounded tablets for treating hypertension, which is composed of core layer and outer layer. The outer layer comprises (wt. parts): telmisartan (5-15), filler (18-50), pH regulator (0.5-5), surfactant (2-12), adhesive (3.5-10) and lubricant (1-3). The core layer comprises (wt. parts): diuretic (15-20), filler (15-20), disintegrant (1-3), adhesive (1-3), lubricant (0.5-2) and coating (0.3-1).<br>
WO2009/115301 discloses the combination therapy of a non-peptide angiotensin II receptor antagonist such as telmisartan or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof with a diuretic such as HCTZ.<br>
US20090202636 discloses a formulation of telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide having both substances in separate units. Both the units are either compressed into tablets or filled in capsules. The said US application also discloses the first telmisartan unit consisting of granules, pellets and tablets, to which coating of hydrochlorothiazide with appropriate polymer is applied.<br>
Indian Patent Application No. 1928/DELNP/2004 discloses bilayer pharmaceutical tablet comprising a first layer for immediate release of the angiotensin II receptor antagonist (Telmisartan) from a dissolving tablet matrix which contains telmisartan in substantially amorphous form, and a second layer formulated for immediate release of a diuretic like Hydrochlorothiazide from a fast disintegrating tablet matrix. A method of producing the bilayer tablet is also disclosed.<br>
 <br>
Indian Patent Application No. 4579/DELNP/2007 relates to a pharmaceutical composition for the treatment of hypertension comprising as active ingredients about 80 mg of the angiotensin II receptor antagonist telmisartan and about 25 mg of the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide and the method of manufacture of the said bilayer tablet.<br>
It is known from the literature that telmisartan has very poor aqueous solubility in the physiological pH range of the gastrointestinal tract between pH I and 7; and is soluble in strong base. On the other hand, hydrochlorothiazide degrades in alkaline conditions. It is advantageous to administer both telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide to treat hypertension, either concomitantly or even better to administer a composition comprising both. Difficulty results from the fact that both active substances need to be released from the composition simultaneously.<br>
In the aforementioned prior arts, it is provided that the formulation of telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide is either in bilayer or in two separate units to keep the two APIs well separated from each other, to prevent degradation of hydrochlorothiazide.<br>
The prior arts processes require either complex processes like separate granulation of the two drugs or coating of one drug over the core of other, or a process of preparing bilayer tablets, which need to have special machine and critical control of process parameters. Hence, the aforementioned prior arts suffer from one or more drawbacks.<br>
It was surprisingly found in the present invention that formulation of telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide can be prepared in a single unit or a single layer tablet by simple and cost effective process which will overcome the drawbacks of the aforementioned prior arts. Thus, the present invention provides a solid oral pharmaceutical composition of telmisartan or a salt thereof and hydrochlorothiazide, having good disintegration and dissolution properties which would further provide rapid and complete drug release.<br>
Object of the invention:<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide composition comprising telmisartan or a salt thereof and hydrochlorothiazide, free of binder and surfactant.<br>
 <br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a solid oral pharmaceutical composition of telmisartan or a salt thereof and hydrochlorothiazide, having good disintegration and dissolution properties which would further provide rapid and complete drug release.<br>
Yet another objective of the invention is to provide a process for preparing solid oral pharmaceutical composition of Telmisartan or a salt thereof and hydrochlorothiazide in a single unit using simple granulation process, thereby offering cost effective technology.<br>
Summary of the invention:<br>
In accordance with the above objectives, the present invention is directed to a solid oral pharmaceutical composition of Telmisartan or a salt thereof and hydrochlorothiazide, without the use of binder and surfactant, and yet having good disintegration and dissolution properties. The present invention further provides a solid oral pharmaceutical composition comprising telmisartan or a salt thereof, hydrochlorothiazide, an acidifier, basic agent (s) and pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. The present invention also provides process for manufacturing such composition, wherein both the drugs are in a single unit.<br>
