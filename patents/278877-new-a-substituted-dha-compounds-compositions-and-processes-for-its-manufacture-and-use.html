				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to compounds of the general formula (I):<br>
 <br>
and their use as medicaments, in particular for the treatment of diabetes mellitus, type 2, and pre-stages thereof. It also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising compounds of formula (I), as well as to a fatty acid composition comprising compounds of formula (I).<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART OF THE INVENTION The increasing incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus worldwide poses an immense public health and medical challenge for the implementation of successful preventive and treatment strategies. The concurrent rise in overweight and obesity, which is tightly correlated to type 2 diabetes, interferes with diabetes treatment and increases the likelihood of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and atherosclerosis related diseases. The pathophysiologic condition precluding the development of type 2 diabetes is related to reduced effects of insulin on peripheral tissues, called insulin resistance. These tissues are mainly muscle, fat and liver. Muscle tissue is the main tissue concerned by insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes. The syndrome characterized by insulin resistance, hypertension, dyslipidemia and a systemic proinflammatory state, is referred to as metabolic syndrome. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome in the adult population in developed countries is 22-39% (Meighs 2003).<br>
Currently the most promising approach to mitigate and deter the metabolic syndrome is lifestyle intervention with weight reduction, decreased consumption of saturated fat, increased physical activity in combination with appropriate pharmacotherapy. Healthy diets that avoid excess energy intake encompass substitution of mono and polyunsaturated fatty acids in exchange for saturated fat. In particular the long-chain omega-3 fatty acids from fatty fish, namely eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) have proven beneficial in prevention of type 2 diabetes. EPA and DHA have effects on diverse physiological processes impacting normal health and chronic disease, such as the regulation of plasma lipid levels, cardiovascular and<br>
 <br>
immune function, insulin action and neural development and visual function. Firm evidence exist for their beneficial role in the prevention and management of coronary heart disease, dyslipidemias, type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, and hypertension (Simonopoulos 1999; Geleijnse 2002; Stprlien 1998).<br>
Recent studies suggest that omega-3 fatty acids serve as important mediators of gene expression, working via nuclear receptors like the peroxisome proliferator- activated receptors (PPARs) controlling the expression of the genes involved in the lipid and glucose metabolism and adipogenesis (Jump 2002). PPARs are nuclear fatty acid receptors that have been implicated to play an important role in obesity-related metabolic diseases such as hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance, and coronary heart disease.<br>
The three subtypes, a, y? and 8, have distinct expression pattern and evolved to sense components of different lipoproteins and regulate lipid homeostasis based on the need of a specific tissue. PP ARa potentiates fatty acid catabolism in the liver and is the molecular target of the lipid-Iowering fibrates. PPARy on the other hand is essential for adipocyte differentiation and mediates the activity of the insulin- sensitizing thiazolidinedions (the glitazones) through mechanisms not fully understood. (Chih-Hao 2003; Yki-Jarvinen 2004)<br>
Recently, pharmaceuticals acting as ligands to the PPARy receptor have been introduced as treatment of type 2 diabetes (Yki-Jarvinen 2004). These compounds called thiazolidinediones or glitazones are drugs that reverse insulin resistance which is the pathophysiologic basis for development of the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. These compounds, of which rosiglitazone and pioglitazone have been launched as pharmaceuticals, lower fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations (which is being manifest as a pathologic glucose tolerance test), plasma insulin as well as free fatty acid concentrations. In this respect the glitazones act as insulin sensitizers. However, these improvements are generally accompanied by weight gain and an increase in the subcutaneous adipose-tissue mass (Adams 1997). The use of thiazolidinediones is not only associated with weight gain but a subgroup of patients also have fluid retention and plasma volume expansion, leading to peripheral oedema. The increase in body weight and oedema has been associated with an increase in the incidence of heart failure, which is the reason why the Food and Drug Administration has included a warning in the prescription information for rosiglitazone (provided by<br>
 <br>
Avandia) and pioglitazone (provided by Takeda). These adverse effects restrict the use of the glitazones especially in patients with coronary heart conditions. Clearly there is a potential for new drugs with positive effects on insulin resistance but with weight reduction activity and no fluid retention tendency.<br>
The effect of the poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on PPARs are not only a result of fatty acid structure and affinity to the receptor. Factors contributing to the composition of the intracellular non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) levels are also important. This NEFA pool is affected by the concentration of exogenous fatty acids entering the cell and the amount of endogenous synthesised fatty acids, their removal via incorporation into lipids as well as their oxidation pathways. (Pawar 2003).<br>
Although omega-3 fatty acids are weak agonists of PPARs, when compared with pharmacological agonists like the thioglitazones, these fatty acids have demonstrated improvement in glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity (Storlien 1987). It has been reported that adipocytes were more insulin sensitive and transported more glucose when the polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acid ratio in the diet was increased (Field 1990). Collectively, these data indicate that the 20- and 22-carbon fatty acids, namely EPA and DHA could play a preventive role in the development of insulin resistance. Due to their limited stability in vivo and their lack of biological specificity, PUFAs have not achieved widespread use as therapeutic agents. Chemical modifications of the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have been performed by several research groups in order to change or increase their metabolic effects.<br>
For example, the hypolipidemic effects of EPA was potentiated by introducing methyl or ethyl in a- or p-position of EPA. (Vaagenes 1999). The compounds also reduced plasma free fatty acid while EPA EE had no effect. In a recent work published by L. Larsen (Larsen 2005) the authors show that the a-methyl derivatives of EPA and DHA increased the activation of the nuclear receptor PP ARa and thereby the expression of L-FABP compared to EPA/DHA. EPA with an ethyl group in the a-position activated PP ARa with equal strength as a- methyl EPA. The authors suggest that delayed catabolism of these a-methyl FA may contribute to their increased effects due to decreased P-oxidation in mitochondria leading to peroxisomal oxidation. Alpha-methyl EPA has been shown to be a stronger inhibitor of platelet aggregation than EPAs both in vitro (Larsen 1998) and in vivo (Willumsen 1998).<br>

A fatty acid composition according to the present invention may further compR1se a pharmaceutically acceptable antioxidant, e.g. tocopherol. Within the scope of the present invention is also a fatty acid composition descR1bed above, for use as a medicament. In a further aspect, the present invention relates to the use of a compound according to formula (I) for the manufacture of a medicament for controlling body weight reduction and/or for preventing body weight gain; for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment and/or the prevention of obesity or an overweight condition; for the manufacture of a medicament for the prevention and/or treatment of diabetes in an animal, in particular type 2 diabetes; for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment and/or prevention of amyloidos-related diseases; for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment or prophylaxis of multiple R1sk factors for cardiovascular diseases, preferably for the treatment of elevated blood lipids for the manufacture of a medicament for prevention of stroke, cerebral or transient ischaemic attacks related to atherosclerosis of several arteR1es.<br>
In addition, the present invention relates to a method for controlling body weight reduction and/or for preventing body weight gain; a method for the treatment and/or the prevention of obesity or an overweight condition; a method for the prevention and/or treatment of diabetes, in particular type 2 diabetes; a method for the treatment and/or prevention of amyloidos-related diseases; a method for the treatment or prophylaxis of multiple R1sk factors for cardiovascular diseases; a method for the prevention of stroke, cerebral or transient ischaemic attacks related to atherosclerosis of several arteR1es, wherein a pharmaceutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I) is administered to a human or an animal. Suitably, the compound of formula (I) is administered orally to a human or an animal.<br>
In the research work leading to the present invention, novel DHA-deR1vatives were prepared, which showed excellent pharmaceutical activity. Fatty acids enter cells<br>
 <br>
passively or trough G-protein coupled transporter systems, such as fatty acid transport proteins. Well inside the cells they are temporaR1ly bound by binding proteins (Fatty acid binding proteins, FABP), which play an important role in directing fatty acids to vaR1ous intracellular compartments for metabolism and gene expression (Pawar &amp; Jump 2003). (Fig. 1 liver cell).<br>
EsteR1fication of fatty acids into tR1glyceR1des, polar lipids, and cholesterol esters and their beta-oxidation (mitochondR1al and peroxisomal) requires conversion of fatty acids to acyl CoA thioesters. Other pathways, like microsomal NADPH- dependent mono-oxidation and eikosanoids synthesis, utilise non-esteR1fied fatty acids as substrates. All these reactions are likely to influence cellular levels of free fatty acids (non-esterfified) and thereby the amount and type of fatty acids which could be used as ligands to nuclear receptors. Because PPARs are known to bind non-esteR1fied fatty acids it is reasonable to expect that the composition of the free fatty acid pool is an important determinant in the control of PPAR activity.<br>
The composition of the free fatty acid pool is affected by the concentration of exogenous fatty acids enteR1ng the cells, and their rate of removal via pathways listed above. Since short and medium chain fatty acids are effectively recruited to these pathways, in practice only the long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids will be available for liganding to nuclear receptors. In addition, fatty acid structure may also be an important determinant. Even if a seR1es of mono and polyunsaturated fatty acids demonstrated affinity to the PP ARa receptor, EPA and DHA demonstrated the highest binding capacity in expeR1ments with rat liver cells (Pawar &amp; Jump 2003). Searching for fatty acid candidates available for genetic modification of proteins by interaction with nuclear receptors like the PPARs, it is important to veR1fy that the respective fatty acids will be enR1ched in the free fatty acid pool. DHA which enter cells are rapidly converted to fatty acyl-CoA thioesters and incorporated into phospholipids and due to this, the intracellular DHA level is relatively low. These DHA-CoA are also substrate for P-oxidation pR1maR1ly in the peroxisomes that lead to retroconvertion of DHA to EPA, see Fig. 1. Because of the 5 rapid incorporation into neutral lipids and the oxidation pathway DHA will not stay long in the free fatty acid pool. Due to this the effect of DHA on gene expression is probably limited.<br>
 <br>
The present invention aims at achieving an accumulation of fatty acid deR1vatives in the free fatty acid pool, rather than incorporation into phosholipids. The 0 present inventors have surpR1singly found that the introduction of at least one substituent in the a-position of DHA will lead to a slower oxidation rate in addition to less incorporation into neutral lipids. This will lead to an increased effect on gene expression, since the DHA deR1vatives will accumulate in the tissue particular within liver, muscle, and adipose cells and tR1gger local nuclear receptor activity to a greater 5 extent than DHA. The different substituents according to the invention will give vaR1able affinities of the deR1vatives to fatty acids binding receptors. It is also possible that changes in affinity to fatty acids binding proteins lead to changes in the biological activity of these a-substituted DHA deR1vatives of formula (I). Altogether theses O changes lead to an increased therapeutic effect of the DHA deR1vatives according to the invention compared to DHA.<br>
EPA (all-Z)-5,8,l 1,14,17-eicosapentaenoic acid) has earlier been alkylated in a- and p-position to inhibit mitochondR1al p-oxidation. DHA is not oxidised in the mitochondR1a, but rather incorporated into phospholipids. In the peroxisomes though 5 some DHA is retroconverted to EPA. A substituent in the a-position of EPA and DHA will due to this affect different metabolic pathways. It has earlier been shown that a-methyl EPA and P-methyl EPA is incorporated into phospholipids and tR1glyceR1ds while a-ethyl EPA is not (Larsen 1998), In this study the deR1vatives were tested as substrates and/or inhibitors of enzymes involved in the eicosanoid cascade. O Since most of the substrates for these enzymes are fatty acids liberated from phospholipids it was desired that the deR1vatives were incorporated into phospholipids. In contrast to this, as mentioned before, we want deR1vatives that will not incorporate into lipids, but rather accumulate in the NEFA pool.<br>

formula (I),  pharmaceutically acceptable  salts,  solvates,  complexes or pro-drugs<br>
thereof, as hereinbefore defined, for use as a medicament and/or for use in therapy.<br>
Preferably, the novel compounds, or pharmaceutically acceptable  salts, solvates,<br>
complexes or pro-drugs thereof, of the invention may be used: - for the prevention<br>
and/or treatment of diabetes mellitus in humans or animals; for controlling body weight<br>
reduction and/or for preventing body weight gain;<br>
-	for the prevention and/or treatment of obesity or an overweight condition in humans or in an animal;<br>

There are two major forms of diabetes mellitus. One is type 1 diabetes, which is known as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), and the other one is type 2 diabetes, which is also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Type 2 diabetes is related to obesity/overweight and lack of exercise, often of gradual onset, usually in aduhs, and caused by reduced insulin sensitivity, so called peR1ferral insulin resistance. This leads to a compensatory increase in insulin production. This stage before developing full fetched type 2 diabetes is called the metabolic syndrome and characteR1zed by hypeR1nsulinemia, insulin resistance, obesity, glucose intolerance, hypertension, abnormal blood lipids, hypercoagulopathia, dyslipidemia and inflammation, often leading to atherosclerosis of the arteR1es. Later when insulin production seizes, type 2 diabetes mellitus develops.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the compounds according to formula (I) may used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The compounds according to formula (I) may also be used for the treatment of other types of diabetes selected from the group consisting of metabolic syndrome, secondary diabetes, such as pancreatic, extrapancreatic/endocR1ne or drug-induced diabetes, or exceptional forms of diabetes, such as lipoatrophic, myatonic or a disease caused by disturbance of the insulin receptors. The invention also includes treatment of type 2 diabetes. Suitably, compounds of formula (I), as hereinbefore defined, may activate nuclear receptors, preferably PPAR (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor) a and/or y.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) may also be used for the treatment and/or prevention of obesity. Obesity is usually linked to an increased insulin resistance and obese people run a high R1sk of developing type 2 diabetes which is a major R1sk factor for development of cardiovascular diseases. Obesity is a chronic disease that afflict an increasing proportion of the population in Western societies and is associated, not only with a social stigma, but also with decreasing life span and numerous problems, for instance diabetes mellitus, insulin resistance and hypertension. The present invention thus fulfils a long-felt need for a drug that will reduce total body weight, or the amount of adipose tissue, of preferably obese humans, towards their ideal body weight without significant adverse side effects.<br>
 <br>
The compounds according to formula (I) may also be used for the prevention and/or treatment of amyloidos-related diseases. Amyloidos-related conditions or diseases associated with deposition of amyloid, preferably as a consequence of fibR1l or plaque formation, includes Alzheimer's disease or dementia, Parkinson's disease, amyotropic lateral sclerosis, the spongiform encephalopathies, such as Creutzfeld- Jacob disease, cystic fibrosis, pR1mary or secondary renal amyloidoses, IgA nephropathy, and amyloid depostion in arteR1es, myocardium and neutral tissue. These diseases can be sporadic, inheR1ted or even related to infections such as TBC or HIV, and are often manifested only late in life even if inheR1ted forms may appear much earlier. Each disease is associated with a particular protein or aggregates of these proteins are thought to be the direct oR1gin of the pathological conditions associated with the disease. The treatment of a amyloidos-related disease can be made either acutely or chronically. The compounds of formula (I) may also be used for the treatment due to reduction of amyloid aggregates, prevention of misfolding of proteins that may lead to formation of so called fibR1ls or plaque, treatment due to decreasing of the production of precursor protein such as Ap-protein (amyloid beta protein), and prevention and/or treatment due to inhibiting or slow down the formation of protein fibR1ls, aggregates, or plaque. Prevention of fibR1l accumulation, or formation, by administeR1ng compounds of formula (I), as hereinbefore defined, is also included herein. In one embodiment, the novel compounds, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, complexes or pro-drugs thereof, as hereinbefore defined, are used for the treatment of TBC (tuberculosis) or HIV (human immunodeficiency virus).<br>
Further, the compounds of formula (I) may be administered to patients with symptoms of atherosclerosis of arteR1es supplying the brain, for instance a stroke or transient ischaemic attack, in order to reduce the R1sk of a further, possible fatal, attack. The compounds of formula (I) may also be used for the treatment of elevated blood lipids in humans. Additionally, the compounds of formula (I), as hereinbefore defined, are valuable for the treatment and prophylaxis of multiple R1sk factors known for cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension, hypertR1glyceR1demia and high coagulation factor VII phospholipid complex activity. Preferably, the compounds of formula (I) is used for the treatment of elevated blood lipids in humans. The compounds of formula (I) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, prodrugs  or complexes thereof may be used on their own  but will  generally be<br>
 <br>
administered in the form of a pharmaceutical composition in which the compounds of formula (I) (the active ingredient) are in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant, diluent or carR1er.<br>
The present invention thus also provides a pharmaceutical composition compR1sing a therapeutically effective amount of the compound of formula (I) of the present invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carR1er, diluent or excipients (including combinations thereof).<br>
This is a composition that compR1ses or consists of a therapeutically effective amount of a pharmaceutically active agent. It preferably includes a pharmaceutically acceptable carR1er, diluent or excipients (including combinations thereof). Acceptable carR1ers or diluents for therapeutic use are well known in the pharmaceutical art.

The pharmaceutical composition may also be formulated for administration through any other route where the active ingredients may be efficiently absorbed and utilized, e.g. intravenously, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, intranasally, rectally, vaginally or topically.<br>
In a specific embodiment of the invention, the pharmaceutical composition is shaped in form of a capsule, which could also be microcapsules generating a powder or a sachet. The capsule may be flavoured. This embodiment also includes a capsule wherein both the capsule and the encapsulated fatty acid composition according to the invention is flavoured. By flavouR1ng the capsule it becomes more attractive to the user. For the above-mentioned therapeutic uses the dosage administered will, of course, vary with<br>
 <br>
the compound employed, the mode of administration, the treatment desired a kd the disorder indicated.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition may be formulated to provide a daily dosage of 10 mg to 10 g. Preferably, the pharmaceutical composition is formulated to provide a daily dosage between 50 mg and 5 g of said composition. Most preferably, the pharmaceutical composition is formulated to provide a daily dosage between 100 mg and 1 g of said composition. By a daily dosage is meant the dosage per 24 hours. The dosage administered will, of course, vary with the compound employed, the mode of administration, the treatment desired and the disorder indicated. Typically, a physician will determine the actual dosage which will be most suitable for an individual subject. The specific dose level and frequency of dosage for any particular patient may be vaR1ed and will depend upon a vaR1ety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the metabolic stability and length of action of that compound, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, mode and time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the seveR1ty of the particular condition, and the individual undergoing therapy. The agent and/or the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may be administered in accordance with a regimen of from 1 to 10 times per day, such as once or twice per day. For oral and parenteral administration to human patients, the daily dosage level of the agent may be in single or divided doses. A further aspect of the present invention relates to a fatty acid composition compR1sing compounds of formula (I).

In a preferred embodiment the fatty acid composition further compR1ses tocopherol, or a mixture of tocopherols, in an amount of up to 4 mg per g of the total weight of the fatty acid composition. Preferably, the fatty acid composition compR1ses an amount of 0.2 to 0.4 mg per g of tocopherols, based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
Another aspect of the invention provides a fatty acid composition, or any pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, pro-drug or complex thereof, compR1sing compounds of formula (I), as hereinbefore defined, for use as a medicament and/or in therapy. Such a fatty acid composition may be used to prevent and/or treat the same conditions as outlined for the compounds of formula (I) above. When the fatty acid composition is used as a medicament, it will be administered in a therapeutically or a pharmaceutically active amount.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the fatty acid composition is administered orally to a human or an animal. The present invention also provides the use of a compound of formula (I),<br>
 <br>
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, pro-drug or complex thereof, as hereinbefore defined, for the manufacture of a medicament for controlling body weight reduction and/or for preventing body weight gain; for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment and/or the prevention of obesity or an overweight condition; for the manufacture of a medicament for the prevention and/or treatment of diabetes in a human or animal; for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment and/or prevention of amyloidos-related diseases; for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment and prophylaxis of multiple R1sk factors known for cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension, hypertR1glyceR1demia and high coagulation factor VII phospholipid complex activity; for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of TBC or HIV; for the manufacture of a medicament for prevention of stroke, cerebral or transient ischaemic attacks related to atherosclerosis of several arteR1es; for the manufactuR1ng of a medicament for loweR1ng tR1glyceR1des in the blood of mammals and/or evelating the HDL cholesterol levels in the serum of a human patients; or for the manufactuR1ng of a medicament for the treatment and/or prevention of the multi metabolic syndrome termed "metabolic syndrome".

The present invention also relates to a method for controlling body weight reduction and for preventing body weight gain, wherein a fatty acid composition compR1sing at least a compound of formula (I), as hereinbefore defined, is administered to a human or an animal.<br>
Further, the invention relates to a method for the treatment and/or the prevention of obesity or an overweight condition, wherein a fatty acid composition compR1sing at least a compound of formula (I), as hereinbefore defined, is administered to a human or an animal.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the present invention relates to a method for the prevenfion and/or treatment of diabetes mellitus, wherein a fatty acid composifion compR1sing at least a compound of formula (I), as hereinbefore defined, is administered to a human or an animal. Preferably, diabetes mellitus is a type 2 diabetes. Other aspects of the present invention relate to;<br>
 <br>
-a method for the treatment and/or prevention of amyloidos-related diseases;<br>

diseases;<br>
-a method for prevention of stroke, cerebral or transient ischaemic attacks related to<br>
atherosclerosis of several arteR1es; wherein a fatty acid composition compR1sing at least<br>
a compound of formula (I), as hereinbefore defined, is administered to a human or an<br>
animal.<br>
The fatty acid deR1vatives of formula (I) may be prepared most effectively from DHA.<br>
If the start mateR1al is not pure DHA (i.e. not 100% DHA) the final fatty acid<br>
composition will contain a mixture of DHA deR1vatives, as hereinbefore defined, and an<br>
amount of other fatty acids than DHA, wherein these fatty acids are substituted in the<br>
same way as the novel fatty acid analogous of formula (I). Such embodiments are also<br>
included herein.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the compounds of formula (I) are prepared<br>
from (all-Z)-4,7, 10,13, 16,19-docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), wherein said DHA is<br>
obtained from a vegetable, a microbial and/or an animal source, or combinations<br>
thereof. Preferably, said DHA is obtained from a maR1ne oil, such as a fish oil.<br>
The fatty acids in the composition may also be obtained from a vegetable, a microbial<br>
or an animal source, or combinations thereof. Thus, the invention also includes a fatty<br>
acid composition prepared from a microbial oil.<br>
The present invention provides processes for prepaR1ng novel fatty acid analogous of<br>
formula (I), as hereinbefore defined.<br>
DHA is produced from biological sources like maR1ne, microbial or vegetable fats. All<br>
possible raw mateR1als are mixtures of fatty acids on tR1glyceR1de form where DHA<br>
constitutes only a fraction of the fatty acids. Typical DHA concentrations are 40% in<br>
microbial fats and 10-25% in maR1ne fats. DHA-containing vegetable fats are<br>
duR1ng development and fats with high DHA concentrations are expected in the future.<br>
The first process step will always be conversion of the tR1glyceR1des to free fatty acids<br>
or monoesters. Preferable esters are methyl or ethyl esters, but other esters are possible.<br>
In this way the fatty acids bound together three by three on tR1glyceR1des are separated<br>
from each other and thereby making separation possible. Several methods of separating<br>
DHA from other fatty acids are available, the most common ones being short path<br>
distillation separating the fatty acids by volatility, and urea precipitation separating the<br>
 <br>
fatty acids by degree of unsaturation. Other methods reported are silver nitrate complexation also separating the fatty acids on degree on unsaturation, esteR1fication reactions catalysed by fatty acid selective lipases in combination with short path distillation and countercurrent extraction with supercR1tical carbon dioxide. The most important challenges connected to production of pure DHA is to separate it from the other C20-22 highly unsaturated fatty acids present in all available sources. These fatty acids have properties so similar to DHA that none of the methods mentioned above provide sufficient degree of separation. For some microbial high DHA fats, which have very low levels of C20-22 highly unsaturated fatty acids, short path distillation alone or in combination of other methods mentioned may provide more that 90% puR1ty.<br>
Most DHA containing fats also contain considerable amounts of C20-22 highly unsaturated fatty acids, e.g. EPA (20:5n-3), n-3DPA (22:5n-3), HPA (21 :5n-3) and others. The only available method for separating DHA from such fatty acids is preparative High Performance Liquid Chromatography, the stationary phase being silica gel or silver nitrate impregnated silica gel, the mobile phase being selected organic solvents or supercR1tical carbon dioxide. With this method DHA with more than 97% puR1ty is available. However, it has to be noted that the production costs increases strongly with concentration, as an example is production cost for 97% DHA more 5 times higher than for 90% DHA.<br>
DHA having a puR1ty of 90, 95 eller 97% contains small amounts of other fatty acids. As an example, DHA having a puR1ty of 97% contains n-3DPA (22:5n-3), but also long chain fatty acids, e.g. EPA (20:5n-3), HPA (21:5n-3), and others. However, the other fatty acids will react in a way similar to DHA and provide alpha-substituted deR1vatives. Organic synthesis may provide a puR1fication method since DHA and n-6DP A (and 22:5n-6 which normally is present in very low concentrations) are the only known fatty acids that can provide gamma-lactones by cyclisation with the first double bond. Lactonisation followed by puR1fication and hydrolysis back to DHA may be a possibility, but it is expected that this pathway is even more expensive than HPLC. In one embodiment, the compounds of formula (I) where R1 (or R2) is a hydrogen are prepared through the following processes (Scheme 1). Suitably adapted, these processes can alsoe be used for prepaR1ng compounds represented by the general formula (I)<br>
 <br>
where both R1 and R2 are e.g. a C1-C7 alkyl group, a benzyl, a halogen, a benzyl, an alkenyl, or an alkynyl.<br>
Compounds represented by the general formula (I) where R1 is a hydrogen and R2 denotes a C1-C7 alkyl group, a benzyl, a halogen, a benzyl, an alkenyl, an alkynyl are prepared by reacting a DHA ester with a strong non-nucleophilic base like lithium diisopropylamine or potassium/sodium hexamethyldisilazideane in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, diethylether at temperatures of —60 to —78 ^C, to provide the ester enolate (process 1).<br>
 <br>
This ester enolate is reacted with an electrophilic reagent like an alkylhalide exemplified by ethyliodine, benzylcloR1de, an acyl halide exemplified by acetyl chloR1de, benzoyl bromide, a carboxylic anhydR1de exemplified by acetic anhydR1de or a electrophilic halogenation reagent exemplified by N-fluorobenzene sulfonimide (NFSI), etc. to provide the monosubstitued deR1vative (process 2). The ester is further hydrolysed in a solvent like ethanol or methanol to the carboxylic acid deR1vative by addition of a base like lithium/sodium hydroxide in water at temperatures between 15-40 °C.<br>
Claisen condensation of the DHA EE occurs duR1ng the treatment of DHA EE with a strong base. This condensation product might possess interesting biologically activity.<br>
 <br>
Thus, in one embodiment of the invention the condensation (intermediate) product mentioned above, as well as the use of this product for treatment and/or prevention of diseases according to the present invention, are disclosed.<br>
In a further embodiment, compounds represented by the general formula (I) are synthesised through following processes (Scheme 2). (Scheme 2)<br>
 <br>
Compounds represented by the general formula (I) where R1 is a hydrogen and R2 denotes a hydroxy, an alkoxy group, an acyloxy are prepared by reacting a DHA ester with a strong non-nucleophilic base like lithium diisopropylamine or potassium/sodium hexamethyldisilazideane in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, diethylether at temperatures of -60 to -78 ^Cs to provide the ester enolate (process 4). This ester enolate is reacted with an oxygen source like dimethyldioxirane, 2- (phenylsulfonyl)-3-phenyloxaziR1dine, molecular oxygen with different additives like tR1methylphosphite or different catalysts like a Ni(II) complex to provide alpha- hydroxy DHA ester(process 5). Reaction of the secondary alcohol with a base like sodiumhydR1de in a solvent like THF or DMF generates an alkoxide that is reacted with different electrophilic reagents as alkyliodide for example; methyl iodide, ethyl iodide, benzylbromide or an acyl<br>
 <br>
halide, for example; acetyl chloR1de, benzoyl bromide (process 6). The ester is hydrolysed in a solvent like ethanol or methanol to the carboxylic acid deR1vative by addition of a base like lithium/sodium hydroxide in water at temperatures between 15-40 °C (process 7).<br>
The hydroxy-DHA ester is a useful intermediate for the introduction of other functional groups in the a-position according to the invention. The hydroxyl function can be activated by conversion to a halide or tosylate pR1or to reaction with different nucleophiles like ammonia, amines, thiols, etc. The Mitsunobu reaction is also useful for the conversion of a hydroxylgroup into other functional groups. (Mitsunobu, O, Synthesis, 1981, 1).<br>
Compounds represented by the general formula (I), as hereinbefore defined, can also be synthesised by combinations of the different processes previously descR1bed. The present invention includes the processes mentioned above. The invention further provides a process for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition of the invention, with compR1ses mixing of at least a compound of formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, complex or pro-drug thereof, as hereinbefore defined, with a pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant, diluent or a carR1er. The enantiomeR1c pure compounds can be prepared by resolving a racemic compound of formula (I), as hereinbefore defined. The resolution of a compound of formula (I) may be carR1ed out using known resolution procedures, for example by reacting the compound of formula (I) with an enantiomeR1cally pure auxiliary to provide a mixture of diastereomers that can be separated by chromatography. Thereafter the two enantiomers of compound (I) may be regenerated from the separated diastereomers by conventional means, such as hydrolysis.<br>
There is also a possibility to use stochiometR1c chiral auxiliaR1es to effect an asymmetR1cintroduction of the substituents, as hereinbefore defined, in the a-position of DHA. The use of chiral oxazolidin-2-ones has proved to be a particularly effective methodology. The enolates deR1ved from chiral iV-acyloxazolidines can be quenched with a vaR1ety of electrophiles in a highly stereoregulated manner (Ager, Prakash, Schaadl996).<br>
 <br>
The technology of the instant Application is further elaborated with the help of<br>
following examples. However, the examples should not be construed to limit the<br>
scope of the invention.<br>
Examples<br>
In the examples the structures were veR1fied by Mass Spectrometry (MS). It should be<br>

An  overview  of the  models  and  methods  used   in  the  present   invention   for<br>
demonstrating effects on the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes are presented in<br>
Fig. 2: Five blocks of expeR1ments have been performed in order to elucidate the effects<br>
of DHA deR1vatives for reduction of insulin resistance and/or alleviating the metabolic<br>
syndrome. The invention shall not be limited to the shown embodiments and examples.<br>
Example!. Analysis of intracellular free fatty acids (non-esteR1fied fatty acids) in<br>
liver cells (block 1 in Fig. 2)<br>
Background<br>
In the first block of expeR1ments (see Fig. 2) liver tissue from animals fed PRB-1, 2,5,<br>
and 7 was analysed with respect to free unesteR1fied fatty acids. The animals were<br>
recruited from the fifth block of expeR1ments (pharmacodynamic effects of DHA<br>
deR1vatives in an animal model of metabolic syndrome). The animals had been given<br>
DHA (15% of fat content of the diet) or the DHA-deR1vatives (1, 5% of the fat content<br>
in their diet) for 8 weeks and were supposed to be in a steady-state situation with stable<br>
levels of DHA and the DHA-deR1vatives intracellulaR1ly. Liver tissue was chosen due to<br>
the fact that the metabolisation rate is very high in liver.<br>
Method<br>
The liver samples were homogenized in cold PBS buffer, and extracted immediately<br>
with chloroform: methanol (2:1) containing 0.2mM butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT)<br>
using cis-10-heptadecenoic acid as internal standard. The organic phases were dR1ed<br>
under nitrogen, re-dissolved in acetonitR1le with 0.1% acetic acid and 10|xM BHT for<br>
RP-HPLC MS/MS analysis. Total protein content was measured using Bio-Rad method<br>
after homogenization.<br>
Agilent 1100 system was used for reverse phase column (Supelco Ascentis Cis column,<br>
25cm x 4.6mm, i.d. 5|xm) separation of DHA and its PRB deR1vatives within 22min.<br>
 <br>
The flow phase was iso-gradient acetonitR1le-HaO (87+13, v/v) containing 0.1% acetic<br>
acid. The column oven temperature was set at 35°C. The column elute was identified<br>
and quantified in the negative electrospray ionisation applying multiple reaction<br>
monitoR1ng mode by tR1ple tandem quadrapole mass/mass (ABI Qtrap-4000). The<br>
parent-daughter ion pairs were 327.3/327.3 (DHA)3 341.3/341.3 (PRB-I), 355.3/355.3<br>
(PRB-2 and PRB-5), 387.3 /387.3 (PRB-7), 267.2/267.2 (LS. FA 17:1) respectively<br>
under unit resolufion. The signal collection dwell time was all 100 msec except for FA<br>
17:1 which was set at 200msec. Accurate veR1fication of isomeR1c PRB compounds was<br>
done by combination of the retention time and characteR1stic mass/charge ratio. The<br>
quadratic regression standard curve was used for quantification after internal standard<br>
calibration.<br>
Results<br>
Concentration of the different DHA-deR1vatives and the concentrations of DHA was<br>
given as |ig per g of total amount of protein in the liver cells. Fig, 3 depicts the<br>
concentrations of the different PRBs from animals given PRB-I, 2, 5 and 7 in a<br>
concentration of 1.5% of total fat content in the high fat diet.<br>
The highest intracellular concentration of the PRBs was obtained for PRB-2. Also<br>
PRB-5 was enR1ched intracellulaR1ly, although not to the same extent as PRB-2. This<br>
finding is unexpected.<br>
Fig. 4 depicts the intracellular concentrations of DHA in liver tissue from animals given<br>
the different PRBs. DHA reached a significantly higher level in the animals given PRB-<br>
7 compared to the other three DHA-deR1vatives. Animals given PRB-2 had the lowest<br>
concentration of DHA. It seems that PRB-7 is to some extent converted back to DHA.<br>
PRB-2 reached the highest intracellular concentration. This means that PRB-2 will be<br>
more available as a ligand to nuclear receptors, a pattern which could be translated into<br>
therapeutic effects in handling of blood glucose and blood lipids.<br>
Example 2 Computer based affinity testing (block 2 in Fig. 2)<br>
Background<br>
Nuclear receptors have been sequenced and the amino acid sequence is known for the<br>
PPARs and other relevant receptors engaged in the genetic control of glucose and fat.<br>
X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy of the PPAR receptors are available and<br>
computeR1sed affinity testing of fatty acids liganding to the receptors can be used to<br>
estimate binding kinetics. The binding geometR1es, often called binding modes or poses,<br>
 <br>
include both positioning of the ligand relative to the receptor and the conformational<br>
state of the ligand and the receptor. Effective ligand docking can therefore be analysed.<br>
Affinity of the ligand to the receptor is defined by two different parameters: docking of<br>
the ligand (DHA deR1vative) into the binding site of the receptor and electrostatic<br>
bonding between certain amino acids of the receptor and the carboxyl group or side<br>
chains in the head of the fatty acid. (KrumR1ne).<br>
As previously known, the PP ARa receptor is more promiscuous compared to PPARy,<br>
meaning that PP ARa will accept more fatty acids as ligands compared to PPARy.<br>
However, since patients with metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes are usually obese<br>
or overweight and have pathologic blood lipids, mainly elevated tR1glyceR1des and low<br>
High-Density Cholesterol (HDL-chol) activation of the PP ARa receptor is important.<br>
An ideal drug for treatment of metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes should act as<br>
ligand to both these receptors, preferably with the highest affinity to the PPARy<br>
receptor.<br>
Method<br>
Ranking of the different DHA-deR1vatives according to their binding affinity was<br>
calculated and given as lowest binding affinity (LBA) and average binding affinity<br>
(ABE).<br>
A total of 15  DHA deR1vatives (PRB-I through PRE-15) were tested with the<br>
computeR1zed docking method. Some of the deR1vatives, such as PRB-I, PRB-2, PRB-<br>
7, PRB-9, PRB-IO, PRB-11, PRB-12, PRB-13, PRB-14 and PRB-15, are presented as r<br>
and s enantiomeres and in this case both were tested. The PPARy ligands rosiglitazone<br>
and pioglitazone, both in the r and s form, were also tested for compaR1son. These<br>
compounds are registered pharmaceuticals for treatment of diabetes.<br>
Results<br>
The results are shown in Table 1, presenting the parameters Lowest binding energy of<br>
single confirmation (LBE), average binding energy (ABE) of the correctly posed<br>
confirmation and fraction of correctly posed confirmation of the ICM-saved 20 lowest<br>
energy confirmation (Abound) of the compounds tested. Affinity to the RXRa was<br>
tested in the same setting. The RXRa receptor interacts with the PPAR receptor<br>
forming a heterodimer by liganding of a fatty acid.<br>
Fig. 5 depicts the binding affinities for the PPARy receptor, which is mainly engaged in<br>
the transcR1ption of proteins engaged in handling of blood glucose. Clearly PRB-2 both<br>
 <br>
in the r and the s stereoisomer forms had a good affinity to the PPARy receptor. PRB-5 scored somewhat poorer while PRB-8 had the highest ABE score. These findings are highly unsuspected and could be translated into a more effective transcR1ption of the respective PPARy activated gene responsible for handling of blood glucose. Fig. 6 depicts the binding affinities to the nuclear receptor PPARa which is mainly responsible for metabolisation of fat, blood lipids, fat tissue biology and weight control. Several DHA-deR1vatives had high binding affinity but.PRBS had the highest score. This is also highly unsuspected. Fig. 7 depicts the binding affinities to the nuclear receptor RXRa. The physiologic consequence of binding to the RXRa receptor has not been firmly established. It is known that RXR binds to the PPAR receptors thereby forming a heterodimer which then, subsequently, initiates transcR1ption of the defined gene.<br>

ND- Not docked, c = the double bonds in all-cis form. r= R enantioisomer, s= S<br>

Several of the PRBs have a high LBE and ABE score for the PPARa and<br>
PPARy receptors even compared to the mother compound DHA but also to the PPARy<br>
ligands rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, both in the r and s form. This is an interesting<br>
observation indicating that several of the PRBs could be promising competitors to the<br>
established anti-diabetics rosiglitazone and pioglitazone. Ethyl deR1vativates in alfa<br>
position of the same fatty acids, both the r and the s form, did not improve affinity. This<br>
was especially true for the PPARy receptor. As mentioned previously the PPARa<br>
receptor is more promiscuous binding a long seR1es of fatty acids.<br>
In conclusion, many of the DHA-deR1vatives tested demonstrated interesting affinities<br>
to the PP ARa and PP ARy receptors with binding affinities better than rosiglitazone<br>
and pioglitazone.<br>

Example 3<br>
Affinity testing in transfected cells (block 3 in Fig. 2)<br>
Background<br>
Release of luciferase is correlated to transcR1ption of genes. Binding of a ligand to a nuclear receptor such as PP ARy induces transcR1ption of the respective gene thereby releasing luciferase. This technique therefore provides a measure of ligand affinity to the receptor as well as activation of the responsible gene. Method<br>
Transient transfection of COS-I cells was performed in 6-well plates as descR1bed by Graham and van der Eb (Graham). For full length PPAR transfection studies, each well received 5 |ag reporter construct, 2.5 |xg pSV-P-galactosidase as an internal control, 0.4 |xg pSG5-PPARy2. The cells were harvested after 72 h, and the luciferase activity was measured according to the protocol (Promega). The luciferase activity was normalised against P-galactosidase activity. The adipocytes were transfected at Dl 1 of differentiation using 16 |J,1 LipofectaminPlus reagent, 4 |j,l Lipofectamine (Life Technologies Inc.), 0.2 ^g pSGS-PPARy, and 100 ng pTK Renilla luciferase as control of transfection afficiency. Three hours after transfection, cells were cultured in serum containing medium and incubated for 48 hours in the same medium containing appropR1ate agents. The luciferase activities were measured as recommended by the manufacturer (Dual Luciferase assay, Promega). All transfections were performed in tR1plicate.<br>
Fatty acids (BRL or DHA) and PRBs (stock solutions) were solubilized to 0.1 M final concentration in DMSO. Then, Fatty solubilized to lOmM in DMSO and stored in 1.5 ml tubes (homoplymer, plastic tubes) flushed with argon and stored at - 20^C. 10 |LIM of PRBs or fatty acids and DMSO (control) was added to the media 5h after transfection. Transfected cells were maintained for 24h before lysis by reporter lysis buffer. Binding of PRBs or fatty acids to the LBD of PPAR activates GAL4 binding to UAS, which in turn stimulates the tk promoter to dR1ve luciferase expression. Luciferase activity was measured using a luminometer (TD-20/20 luminometer; Turner Designs, Sunnycvale, CA) and normalized against protein content. Results<br>
 <br>
Fig. 8 depicts the release of luciferase from transfected cells treated with different<br>
PRBs. The results indicate that PRB- 1,2,6,7 and 14 have a significantly higher release<br>
of luciferase compared to PRB-3,5,9,10,11,12, and 16.<br>
Example 4<br>
Affinity testing in adipose prone animals with metabolic syndrome (block 4 in Fig.<br>
2) Background<br>
An animal model of the metabolic syndrome using the adipose prone mice of the C57BL/6J strain was used to test affinity of PRB-2,5, and 8 compared to 97% DHA and the antidiabetic compound rosiglitazone to PPARy, by measuR1ng the release of luciferase from adipose celles taken from these animals. The animals (n^S in each group) were fed high fat diet (fat constituting 60% of total caloR1es, the same diet as used in Block 5) for 8 weeks. Thereafter they were given the PRBs in a dose of 1.5% of the fat content of the diet for another two weeks. The rosiglitazone group was given an amount of 100 mg/KG diet. The control groups continued with either only high fat diet or standard chow. Fig. 9 shows the study design. Method<br>
After sacR1fice adipose tissue (epididymal and subcutaneous) was cleared from other structures and cut into millimeter-size pieces. Fat tissue was R1nsed in 0,9% NaCl and digested in 5 mL of Krebs-R1nger solution containing Hepes, fatty-acid free bovine serum albumin, 20OnM of adenosin, 2 nM of glucose, and 260 U/mL of collagenase for 1,5 h at 37 degrees C in a shaking water bath. After collagensae digestion, adipocytes were separated from tissue debR1s by filteR1ng. Cells were then washed in Krebs-R1nger solution containing Hepes, fatty-acid free bovine serum albumin, 20OnM of adenosin, 2 nM of glucose and kept in a shaking water bath at 37 degrees for a maximum of 30 min until electroporation.<br>
Isolated pR1mary adipocytes were transfected by electroporation to measure the specific PPAR gamma response element (PPRE) activity. In this case we incorporated a plasmid encoding firefly luciferase cDNA under control of a PPRE from the acyl-CoA-oxidase gene. The cells were also co-transfected with a plasmid containing cDNA for Renilla luciferase controlled by a constitutively active promoter. The PPRE inducible firefly luciferase activity was normalised according to Renilla luciferase, thus correcting for potential differences in the amount of transfected cells. To measure<br>
 <br>
luciferase signal we used the Dual-Luciferase® Reporter assay System (Promega,USA).<br>
Pooled epidydimal fat tissue was enough to isolate adipocytes for running duplicates. Each of groups was sacR1ficed in two separated days, and 4 independent transfections for each dietetic group were obtained. Results<br>
DuR1ng first 8 weeks of feeding with HF diet (33,7% of fat, w/w), there was a gradual increase of body weight in compaR1son to control mice fed with chow diet (4,5% w/w). DuR1ng last 2 weeks of feeding with expeR1mental diets high fat diet animals and animals given high fat diet in combination with Rosiglitazon continued gaining weight, approximately with the same rate as before. In case of PRB-8 and PRB-5 enR1ched HF diet the weight gain was reduced. However, in case of PRB-2 and DHA (5% w/w) the diet completely stopped the weight gain and even led to reduction of body weight (Fig. 10). Food consumption was recorded occasionally (4x). There were no differences between the HF and the intervention groups.<br>
In case of high fat in combination with Rosiglitazon, the endogenous activity of PPARy was approximately 2-fold higher than in all the others diet groups (Fig. 11). Furthermore, these fat cells became more sensitive to additional in vitro stimulation with 5uM Rosiglitazon (5, 12- fold stimulation) in compaR1son to i.e. HF diet itself (1, 5-fold stimulation). This rosiglitazon - sensitizing effect was also recorded in the PRB-2 and the PRB-5 diet group (2, 6-fold stimulation).<br>
Data from this study clearly demonstrates activity on the nuclear PPAR receptors, in particular with the effects on weight which was most prominent for the groups given PRB-2. Even animals given PRB-5 and PRB-8 did not increase in weight as did the high fat diet group. Interestingly animals given rosiglitazone increaed in weight to the same extent as animals given only the high fat diet. This clearly demonstrates the negative effects of giving only a PPARy ligand, like the glitazones, with the R1sk of weight increase even if insulin resistance is reduced. However, when it comes to PPARy activation measured as luciferase activity in this expeR1ment, rosiglitazone scores higher compared to any of the PRBs. Within the PRB groups PRB-2 and PRB-5 had a higher score compared to PRB-8 and DHA only (Fig. 12).<br>

Pharmacodynamic effects of DHA deR1vatives in an animal model of metabolic<br>
syndrome (block 5 in Fig. 2)<br>
Background<br>
An animal model of the metabolic syndrome using the adipose prone mice of the C57BL/6J strain was used to document effects on typical laboratory and pathological anatomical features common for the metabolic syndrome. When given a high fat diet containing about 60% of fat, the animals are getting obese developing high insulin plasma levels, pathological glucose tolerance test, elevated serum tR1glyceR1des and non-esteR1fied fatty acids, and fat liver. Example 5a<br>
Effect of DHA deR1vatives in adipose prone mice duR1ng 4 months of dietary interventions Method<br>
All expeR1ments were performed on male C57BL/6 mice, either a substrain C57BL/N (supplier: Charles R1ver, Germany, n = 160, expeR1ments A-C, see below), or a substrain C57BL/6J (supplier: the Jackson laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA, n = 32, expeR1ment D). Total numbers of animals used were higher (n = 170 and 36, respectively), because of culling. In the latter case, animals were bred for several generations (
 <br>
Animals weree fed 3 types of expeR1mental diets:<br>
(i) Chow diet (ssniff RM-H from SSNIFF Spezialdieten Gmbh, Soest, Germany; see<br>
also http://ssniff.de) with protein, fat and carbohydrate forming 33, 9, and 58 energy %,<br>
respectively<br>
(ii)  High-fat  diet  prepared  in the  laboratory  (cHF  diet)  with  protein,  fat  and<br>
carbohydrate forming 15, 59, and 26 energy %, respectively, and well characteR1zed<br>
fatty acid composition (with most of the lipids coming from com oil; see Ruzickova<br>
2004) (iii) cHF diets in which 0.15, 0.5, and 1.5 % of fat (specifically the corn oil<br>
constituent) was replaced by vaR1ous PRB-compounds, namely PRBl, PRB2, PRB5,<br>
PRB7, and PRB8, or by DHA. AU these compounds were in the form of ethyl esters,<br>
provided by Pronova Biocare a.s. in sealed containers. Chemical composition of the<br>
PRB-compounds was unknown to the laboratory performing the expeR1ments (Institute<br>
of Physiology, Academy of Sciences Prague, Czech Republic).<br>
After arR1val, the PRB-compounds were stored in a refR1gerator in oR1ginal containers.<br>
The containers were opened just before preparation of the expeR1mental diets. Diets<br>
were kept in plastic bags flushed by nitrogen and stored at -70V in small aliquots<br>
sufficient for feeding animals for one week. Fresh ratios were given in 2-day intervals<br>
or daily.<br>
Outline of the study<br>
The study was based on 4 individual expeR1ments. In each of the expeR1ments, different<br>
PRB-compounds (or DHA, respectively) admixed to cHF diet in three different<br>
concentrations (0.15, 0.5, and 1.5 % of the fat content) were tested. In each expeR1ment,<br>
a subgroup of plain cHF diet-fed mice was included and served as a control. Mice were<br>
caged in groups of 4 and fed standard chow diet until 3 mo of age, when animals (n =<br>
8-13) were randomly assigned to the different test diets. After 2 mo on this new diet (at<br>
5 mo of age), animals were fasted overnight and in the morning, intrapeR1toneal<br>
Glucose Tolerance Test (GTT) was performed. Animals were sacR1ficed after 4 months<br>
on the expeR1mental diets, at 7 mo of age, and the end- point analysis were performed.<br>
Study parameters.<br>
The parameters in the study were: Body weight gain (grams), area under the curve<br>
(AUC) from intrapeR1toneal glucose tolerance tests (mMol x 180 min), plasma insulin<br>
(ng/ml), serum tR1glyceR1des (TAGss mmol/1), and non-esteR1fied fatty acids (NEFA5<br>
mmol/1).<br>
 <br>
Fig. 13 shows a typical blood glucose elimination curve before and after animals with<br>
insulin resistance are given a compound with insulin resistance reducing effect.<br>
Reduction of the area under the curve means that blood glucose is eliminated more<br>
effectively due to reduced insulin resistance.<br>
Results<br>
The results are shown in the following tables 2, 3 and 4. (* = significant differencies<br>
compared to cHF diets (P
Table 2 shows the effects in animals given 1.5% concentration of the PRB test<br>
compounds compared to animals given standard chow (STD), composite high fat diet<br>
(cHF) or 97% DHA. Body weight gain was significantly reduced in animals given<br>
PRB-2 compared to animals given high fat diet (cHF). Food intake was somewhat<br>
lower in this group. The most pronounced reduction in AUC from glucose tolerance<br>
tests was seen in the same group and even in animals given PRB-I .Plasma insulin was<br>
significantly lower in the PRB-2 group compared to the cHF controls even if the PRB-I<br>
and PRB-5 treated animals showed some effect on this parameter too. The PRB-2<br>
group showed the biggest reduction in tR1glyceR1des (TAGs) and non-esteR1fied fatty<br>
acids (NEFA).<br>
Table 3 shows the effects in animals given a lower concentration, 0.5%, of the PRB test<br>
compounds compared to animals given standard chow (STD), composite high fat diet<br>
(cHF) or 97%» DHA. Body weight gain was somewhat lower in animals given PRB-2<br>
and PRB-5. AUC from the glucose tolerance test as well as plasma insulin, however,<br>
was significantly lower only in the PRB-2 group.<br>
Table 4 shows the rsults from the lowest PRB concentration given, 0.15%. Here, the<br>
differences were small. Weight gain was somewhat lower in the PRB-I and PRB-2<br>
groups while AUC was significantly lower only in the PRB-2 group. Plasma insulin<br>
was lower in PRB-1, 2 and 7.<br>

<br>
In conclusion, testing of PBR-1, 2,5, and 7 duR1ng 4 months in adipose prone animals<br>
with insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome demonstrated a clear and unsuspected<br>
effect of the PRBs tested, in particular the DHA- deR1vative PBR-2, on insulin<br>
resistance and symptoms of the metabolic syndrome such as weight reduction, reduced<br>
AUC in the intrapeR1toneal glucose tolerance test, lower insulin/plasma levels as well as<br>
reduced tR1glyceR1de and non-esteR1fied free fatty acids. Effects were observed in the<br>
dose of 1.5% as well as in the 0.5% group. Some effects were even noticed in the<br>
lowest concentration group of 0.15%.<br>
Testing of the PRB-8 compound was started later, therefore only data from 2 months<br>
intervention in three dose groups (1.5%, 0.5% and 0,15%) are given. In the group given<br>
1.5%, body weight (BW) was 28.0 ±0.7 grams compared to controls 29.6±0.9, AUC<br>
1031 ±104  compared to   1074±91.  These  differences are  small  but the trend  is<br>
interesting. There were no differences between intervention and controls.for the lower<br>
doses of 0.5% and 0.15%). The data regarding PRB-8 data from 2 months medication<br>
showing a trend towards weight reduction and AUC.<br>
Example 5b<br>
Effect of DHA  deR1vatives  on  established  metabolic syndrome  and  insulin<br>
resistance<br>
Method<br>
In another expeR1ment, PRB-2, PRB-5, and PRB-7 were tested in the same breed of<br>
animals. In this expeR1ment, animals were initially fed high fat diet (the same as in the<br>
previous expeR1ment 5 a) for 8 weeks developing insulin resistance and the metabolic<br>
syndrome, and then given the PRBs. The start dose was to substitute 15%) of the fat<br>
content with the PRBs but the animals did not tolerate this dose. After a peR1od of<br>
another two weeks the animals were given 1.5%) of PRB-2, 5%) andl.5%&gt; of PRB-5, and<br>
1.5%and0.5%ofPRB-7.<br>
Results<br>
Weight reduction was very good in the animals given PRB-2. Even the animals given<br>
PRB-5 showed some weight reduction but in the higher dose of 5%&gt;. TR1glyceR1des were<br>
reduced with all deR1vatives tested compared to the control animals fed composite High<br>
Fat diet. Reduction of non-esteR1fied fatty acids was most pronounced with PRB-2 and<br>
PRB-5, however in different doses. (See Fig. 14)<br>
 <br>
Blood cholesterol was reduced in animals given PRB-2 and PRB-5. Blood glucose was not affected due to the fact that these animals are in a pre-diabetic state with normal glucose due to a high insulin production. However, more importantly, plasma insulin was significantly reduced in the PRB-2 group in a much lower concentration compared to the second best DHA-deR1vative PRB-5. Even PRB-7 showed some effects on the insulin concentration. (See Fig. 15).<br>
PRB-2 showed a statistically significant reduction of the AUC blood glucose at all time points of the curve compared to the baseline values. This means that blood glucose was more effectively removed after treatment of 1,5% of PRB-2. PBR-5 and PBR-7 showed some effect but not to the same extent. (See Fig. 16).<br>
These effects are highly unsuspected and very relevant for a positive effect in metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. These patients are almost exclusively overweight or obese and a weight reductive effect of a drug is highly positive. The mostly used remedies used for treatment of type 2 diabetes today, the thiazolidinedions, which are potent PPARy ligands thereby reducing insulin resistance, often result in weight increase which is highly negative for these subset of patients (Yki-Jarvinen 2004). Reduction of serum tR1glyceR1des is another very important effect that was demonstrated in the expeR1ments. Patients with metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes usually have elevated tR1glyceR1des. The tR1glyceR1de loweR1ng effects of the DHA-deR1vatives is a positive finding and again PRB-2 demonstrated the most potent effect with the lowest dose given. The very positive effects on plasma insulin and glucose tolerance test are very promising and highly unsuspected. Taken together the effects obtained with the DHA-deR1vatives in particular PRB-2 are very promising forming a good basis for development of an antidiabetic drug. Example 5c<br>
Testing of DHA deR1vatives on liver fat Method<br>
Tissue samples from animals in the expeR1ments with DHA deR1vatives was histologically analysed. After paraffmation, tissue samples from liver, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, pancreas, and kidney were stained with eosin-hematoxylin.<br>
 <br>
Results<br>
There were no pathological findings in the tissues examined with exception from liver. Control animals fed high fat diet had developed fat liver (liver steatosis). Fat droplets in the liver can easily be distinguished from normal liver cells. Animals treated with PRB-I, 5, and 7 had low degree of fat liver. However, animals treated with 1.5% of PRB-2 had completely normal liver cells with no trace of steatosis. This is an extremely important finding and very relevant for treatment of patients with insulin resistance, obesity and type 2 diabetes. Liver steatosis is a common finding in these patients which is usually related to an overload of fatty acids and tR1glyceR1des, biological markers present in the development of insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome. DHA-deR1vatives reduce liver steatosis, and PRB-2 was the most efficient compound showing this effect. Discussion and conclusions<br>
The present application clearly identifies a new group of compounds which are activating nuclear receptors, especially PP ARy and PP ARa, thereby offeR1ng a seR1es of therapeutic effects in the treatment of insulin resistance, the metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and other atherosclerotic related diseases. Members of this group are DHA deR1vatives with side chains of different kind in the alfa position of the molecule. A large number of alfa-substituted DHA deR1vatives have been tested and compared with controls as well as pure DHA and EPA. Several of the compounds tested have demonstrated interesting biological effects very relevant for a potential anti-diabetic drug.<br>
Interestingly, and not conceivable on beforehand, alfa-ethyl DHA ethyl ester (PRB-2) was significantly more effective in the battery of tests used to demonstrate effects related to insulin resistance and thereby diseases mainly caused by this pathophysiologic condition such as the metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and other atherosclerotic related diseases. Alfa-ethyl DHA ethyl ester was enR1ched in liver tissue from animals given the different DHA deR1vatives tested (Block 1) indicating that this compound was not utilised for synthesis of tR1glyceR1des, eikosanoids or other metabolic intermediates. Indirectly this would mean that alfa-ethyl DHA would be available for liganding to nuclear receptors like the PPARs.<br>
 <br>
In testing of affinity to PPAR y and PP ARa using computeR1zed docking technology a large number of the DHA-deR1vatives showed affinities to both receptors, not least PPAR y which probably is the most important nuclear receptor engaged in the activation of genes responsible for metabolisation of blood glucose. In particular alfa-ethyl DHA (PRB-2) as well as alfa-diethyl DHA (PBR-8) possessed excellent affinity to these nuclear receptors. Compared to alfa-diethyl DHA alfa-ethyl DHA has two stereoisomers, the r and the s form. Using the docking technology both stereoisomers possessed about the same affinity to PPAR y and PP ARa meaning that neither the r or the s form should have advantages compared to the racemic form. In fact the racemic form may have advantages over each one of the stereoisomers. When affinity was tested in transfected cells carrying the nuclear receptor and the subsequent DNA response element, several of the PRBs demonstrated good affinity measured as release of luciferase. Alfa-ethyl DHA (PRB-2) together with PRB-6,7 and 14 demonstrated the best effects.<br>
Five of the DHA deR1vatives have been extensively tested in the C57BL/6 mouse model developing insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome when fed high fat diet. Alfa-ethyl DHA (PRB-2) has been tested in three individual expeR1ments while PRB- 1,5, and 7 were tested in two and alfa-diethyl DHA (PRB-8) was tested in one expeR1ment. All deR1vatives demonstrated significant biological effects. However, alfa-ethyl DHA (PRB-2) showed the most promising effects with a consistent reduction in body weight, AUC from intrapeR1toneal glucose tolerance testing, plasma insulin as well as serum tR1glyceR1des and non-esteR1fied fatty acids. The effects were obtained on the doses 1.5% and 0.5%. The lowest tested dose 0.15% did not perform convincingly. Alfa-ethyl DHA (PRB-2) in a dose of 1.5% has also demonstrated a normalisation of fat liver, an important pathological finding in patients and animals with insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome.<br>
CompaR1ng with pure DHA, alfa-ethyl DHA (PRB-2) seems to be 10-30 times as potent as DHA. All in all these findings and the potency compared to the mother molecule DHA are not predictable and highly unexpected.<br>
Since alfa-ethyl DHA (PRB-2) seems to work by simultaneous liganding to the nuclear receptors PP ARa and PPARy the compound would not only possess therapeutic interesting effects on glucose and lipid metabolism, not least in patients with insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes but also have weight reduction as<br>
 <br>
well as a general anti-inflammatory effect. Directly or through positive intervention on<br>
R1sk  factors  alfa-ethyl  DHA  (PRB-2)  would  have  a  preventive   effect  on  the<br>
development of cardiovascular disease such as myocardial infarction and cerebral<br>
stroke as well as having a preventive effect on cardio-vascular mortality.<br>
Pharmaceuticals acting as PPARy ligands are already on the market but even if these<br>
compounds are having positive effects on glucose metabolism, they are hampered by<br>
adverse effects such as elevated tR1glyceR1des, weight increase and oedema. The alfa-<br>
substituted DHA deR1vatives presented in this application are having a combined<br>
PPARy and PP ARa effect which is probably both relevant and advantageous for<br>
patients with insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Furthermore,<br>
these  combinative  actions  should  have  important  effects  also  on  blood  lipids,<br>
inflammatory events, atherosclerosis, and thereby cardiovascular disease.<br>
