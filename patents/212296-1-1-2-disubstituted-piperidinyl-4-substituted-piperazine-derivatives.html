This invention concerns l-(l,2-disubstituted piperidinyl)-4-substituted piperazine derivatives having tachykinin antagonistic activity, in particular substance P antagonistic activity, and their preparation; it further relates to compositions comprising them, as well as their use as a medicine.<br>
Substance P is a naturally occurring neuropeptide of the tachykinin family. There are ample studies showing that substance P and other tachykinins are involved in a variety of biological actions, and therefore, play an essential role in various disorders (Regoli et al., Pharmacological Reviews 46(4), 1994, p. 551-599, "Receptors and Antagonists for Substance P and Related Peptides"). The development of tachykinin antagonists has led to date to a series of peptide compounds of which might be anticipated that they are metabolically too labile to be employed as pharmaceutically active substances (Longmore J. et al., DN&amp;P 8(1), February 1995, p. 5-23, "Neurokinin Receptors"). The present invention concerns nonpeptide tachykinin antagonists, in particular nonpeptide substance-P antagonists, which in general are metabolically more stable, and hence, may be more appropriate as pharmaceutically active substances.<br>
Several nonpeptide tachykinin antagonists are disclosed in the art. For instance, EP-0,532,456-A, published on March 17, 1993 by Ciba-Geigy Corp., discloses 1-acylpiperidine compounds, in particular 2-arylalkyl-l-arylcarbonyl-4-piperidinamine derivatives, and their use as substance-P antagonists. EP-0,655,442-A, published on May 31,1995 by Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., discloses piperazine derivatives having tachykinin antagonistic activity.<br>
The present compounds differ therefrom in that they invariably contain a 4-substituted-(piperazine or homopiperazine)-moiety in the 4-position of a piperidine- or homopiperidine group or in the 3-position of a pyrrolidine group, and by their favourable farmacological properties.<br>

Particularly interesting stereoisomeric forms are<br>
(+)-(B)-trans-4-[l-[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)benzoyl]-2-(phenyimethyl)-4-piperidinyl]-N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl)-l-piperazine acetamide; and<br>
(-)-(B)-cis-4-[i-[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)-benzoyl]-2-(phenylmethyl)-4-piperidinyl]-N-(2,6-dimethyIphenyl)-l-piperazine acetamide, and the pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts thereof, especially the (L)-malic acid form.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) can be prepared by reductively N-alkylating an intermediate of formula (III) with an intermediate of formula (IT). Said reductive N-alkylation may be performed in a reaction-inert solvent such as, for example, dichloromethane, ethanol, toluene or a mixture thereof, and in the presence of an appropriate reducing agent such as, for example, a borohydride, e.g. sodium borohydride, sodium cyano-borohydride or triacetoxy borohydride. In case a borohydride is used as a reducing agent, it may be convenient to use a complex-forming agent such as, for example, titanium (I V)isopropylate as described in J. Org. Chem, 1990,55, 2552-2554. Using said complex-forming agent may also result in an improved cis/trans ratio in favour of the trans isomer. It may also be convenient to use hydrogen as a reducing agent in combination with a suitable catalyst such as, for example, palladium-on-charcoal or platinum-on-charcoal. In case hydj'ogen is used as reducing agent, it may be advantageous to add a dehydrating agent to the reaction mixture such as, for example, aluminium rerf-butoxide. In order to prevent the undesired further hydrogenation of certain functional groups in the reactants and the reaction products, it may also be advantageous to add an appropriate catalyst-poison to the reaction mixture, e.g., thiophene or quinoline-sulphur. Stirring and optionally elevated temperatures and/or pressure may enhance the rate of the reaction.<br><br>
In this and the following preparations, the reaction products may be isolated from the reaction medium and, if necessary, further purified according to methodologies generally known in the art such as, for example, extraction, crystallization, trituration and<br><br>
-11-<br>
chromatography.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) can also be prepared by reacting an intermediate of formula (IV) wherein W1 is an appropriate leaving group such as, for example, a halogen, e.g. chloro or bromo, or a sulfonyloxy leaving group, e.g. methanesulfonyloxy or benzenesulfonyloxy, with an intermediate of formula (V). The reaction can be performed in a reaction-inert solvent such as, for example, a chlorinated hydrocarbon, e.g. dichloromethane, an alcohol, e.g. ethanol, or a ketone, e.g. methyl isobuty Ike tone, and in the presence of a suitable base such as, for example, sodium carbonate, sodium hydrogen carbonate or triethylamine. Stirring may enhance the rate of the reaction. The reaction may conveniendy be carried at a temperature ranging between room temperature and reflux temperature.<br><br><br>
The compounds of formula (I) may also be converted into each other following art-known transformations. In particular, the compounds of formula (I) wherein L is other than hydrogen, said L being represented by L" and said compounds being represented by formula (I-a), can also be prepared by reacting a compound of formula (I) wherein L is hydrogen, said compounds being represented by formula (I-b), with an intermediate of formula (VI) wherein W2 is an appropriate leaving group such as, for example, a halogen, e.g. chloro or bromo, or a sulfonyloxy leaving group, e.g. methanesulfonyloxy or benzenesulfonyloxy, at reaction conditions which are similar to those for the reaction between intermediates of formula (IV) and (V).<br>
The compounds of formula (I) may also be converted into each other following art-known iransformations. In particular, the compounds of formula (I) wherein L is other than hydrogen, said L being represented by L" and said compounds being represented by formula (I-a), can also be prepared by reacting a compound of formula (I) wherein L is hydrogen, said compounds being represented by formula (I-b), with an intermediate of formula (VI) wherein W^ is an appropriate leaving group such as, for example, a halogen, e.g. chloro or bromo, or a sulfonyloxy leaving group, e.g. methanesulfonyloxy or benzenesulfonyloxy, at reaction conditions which are similar to those for the reaction between intermediates of formula (IV) and (V).<br><br><br>
Compounds of formula (I-b) may be prepared by reductively N-alkylating a piperazine derivative of formula (VII) wherein pi is a protective group such as, for example, benzyl, with an intermediate of fonnula (II). Said reaction may be performed in a similar way as described hereinabove for the reductive N-alkylation using intermediates (II) and (III). The thus formed compound of formula (l-c) may then be deprotected using art-<br><br>
-12-<br>
known deprotection techniques. Depending on the nature of the protective group P1 compounds of formula (I-c) may be part of the scope of the compounds of formula (I).<br><br>
Alternatively, compounds of formula (I-b) may be prepared by first reductively N-alkylating a piperazine derivative of formula (VII) wherein P1 is a protective group such as, for example, halo, with an intermediate of fonnula (VIII) using the same procedure as described hereinabove for the reductive N-alkylation using intermediates (II) and (in).   The thus formed intermediate of formula (XI) may then be reacted with an intermediate of formula (IV) in a reaction-inen solvent and optionally in the presence of a suitable base such as, for example, triethylamine, to fonn a compound of formula (I-c), which may then be deprotected using an-known deprotection techniques.<br><br>
The compounds of formula (I-b) are deemed to be of particular use in the synthesis of other compounds of formula (I).<br>
The compounds of formula (I) may also be converted to the corresponding N-oxide<br><br>
-13-<br>
forms following art-known procedures for converting a trivalent nitrogen into its N-oxide form. Said N-oxidation reaction may generally be carried out by reacting the starting materiai of formula (I) with an appropriate organic or inorganic peroxide. Appropriate inorganic peroxides comprise, for example, hydrogen peroxide, alkali metal or earth alkaline metal peroxides, e.g. sodium peroxide, potassium peroxide; appropriate organic peroxides may comprise peroxy acids such as, for example, benzenecarboperoxoic acid or halo substituted benzenecarboperoxoic acid, e.g. 3-chlorobenzenecarboperoxoic acid, peroxoalkanoic acids, e.g. peroxoacetic acid, alkylhydroperoxides, e.g. tert-butyl hydroperoxide. Suitable solvents are, for example, water, lower alkanols, e.g. ethanol and the like, hydrocarbons, e.g. toluene, ketones, e.g. 2-butanone, halogenated hydrocarbons, e.g. dichloromethane, and mixtures of such solvents.<br>
The starting materials and some of the intermediates are known compounds and are commercially available or may be prepared according to conventional reaction procedures generally known in the art. For example, intermediates of formula (IH), (IV) and (VI) may be prepared according to an-known procedures.<br>
Intermediates of formula (II) may be prepared by condensing an intermediate of formula (IV) with an intermediate of formula (VIII) analogous to the procedure described in EP-0,532,456-A.<br><br>
The preparation of intermediates of formula (VIII) is also described in EP-0,532,456-A. However, intermediates of formula (VIII) wherein R1 is optionally substituted Ar1C1-6alkyl or di(Arl)C1-6alkyl, said R1 being represented by -CH(Rla)2 and said intermediates being represented by formula (VIII-a), may also be prepared as depicted in scheme 1.<br><br>
-14-<br><br>
In scheme 1, the intermediates of formula (IX-b) may be prepared by reacting an intermediate of formula (IX-a) with an aldehyde or a ketone of formula (X). The C1-6alkylcarbamate moiety in the intermediates of formula (IX-b) may be converted into a fused oxazolone which in turn may be reduced to an intermediate of formula (IX-d). Said intermediate (IX-d) may in turn be deprotected, thus forming an intermediate of formula (VIII-a). Subsequently, intermediates of formula (VIII-a) may be reacted with an intermediate of formula (IV) to prepare intermediates of formula (II) wherein R1 is defined as -CH(R1a)2, said intermediates being represented by formula (Il-a).<br>
Said intermediates of formula (II-a) may also be prepared by first reacting intermediate (IX-d) with intermediate (IV) in the presence of a suitable base to form an intermediate of formula (XII), which may subsequently be deprotected. These reactions and those performed in scheme 1 may all be conducted following conventional methods that are generally known in the art.<br><br><br>
-15-<br>
Intermediates of formula (V) may suitably be prepared by reacting an intermediate of formula (VIII-1), being a protected intermediate of formula (VIII) with a protecting group p2 such as, for example, a C1-6alkyloxycarbonyl group, with an intermediate of formula (III) according to the previously described reductive N-alkylation procedure, and subsequently deprotecting the thus formed intermediate.<br><br>
In particular, intermediates of formula (V) wherein R1 is -CH(R1a)2, said intermediates being represented by formula (V-a), may be prepared as is depicted in scheme 2.<br><br>
The ketalized intermediate of formula (IX-c) may be transformed to the corresponding ketone of formula (IX-e) which subsequently may be reductively aminated with a piperazine- or homopiperazine derivative of formula (III). The thus obtained intermediate may then be reduced with a suitable reducing agent to an intermediate of formula (V-a).<br>
Pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I) may be obtained by the application of art-known procedures. Diastereomers may be separated by physical methods such as selective crystallization and chromatographic techniques, e.g., counter-current distribution, liquid chromatography and the like.<br><br>
-16-<br>
The compounds of formula (1) as prepared in the hereinabove described processes are generally racemic mixtures of enantiomers which can be separated from one another following art-known resolution procedures. The racemic compounds of formula (I) which are sufficiently basic or acidic may be converted into the corresponding diasiereomeric salt forms by reaction with a suitable chiral acid, respectively chiral base. Said diastereomeric salt forms are subsequently separated, for example, by selective or fractional crystallization and the enantiomers are liberated therefrom by alkali or acid. An alternative manner of separating the enantiomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I) involves liquid chromatography, in particular liquid chromatography using a chiral stationary phase. Said pure stereochemically isomeric forms may also be derived from the corresponding pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate starting materials, provided that the reaction occurs stereospecifically. Preferably if a specific stereoisomer is desired, said compound will be synthesized by stereospecific methods of preparation. These methods will advantageously employ enantiomeric ally pure starting materials.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) have valuable pharmacological properties in that they interact with tachykinin receptors and they antagonize tachykinin-induced effects, especially substance P-induced effects, both in vivo and in vitro and are thus of use in the treatment of tachykinin-media ted diseases, and in particular in substance P-mediated diseases.<br>
Tachykinins, also referred to as neurokinins, are a family of peptides among which substance P (SP), neurokinin A (NKA), neurokinin B (NKB) and neuropeptide K (NPK) may be identified. They are naturally occurring in mammals, including human beings, and are distributed throughout the central and peripheral nervous system, where they act as neurotransmitters or neuromodulators. Their actions are mediated through several subtypes of receptors, such as, for example, NK1, NK2 and NK3 receptors. Substance P displays highest affinity for NKj receptors, whereas NKA preferendally binds to NK2 receptors and NKB preferentially binds to NK3 receptors. However, the selectivity of these tachykinins is relatively poor and under physiological conditions the action of any of these tachykinins might be mediated by activation of more than one receptor type.<br>
Substance P and other neurokinins are involved in a variety of biological actions such as pain transmission (nociception), neurogenic inflammation, smooth muscle contraction, plasma protein extravasation, vasodilation, secretion, mast cell degranulation, and also in<br><br>
-17-<br>
activation of the immune system. A number of diseases are deemed to be engendered by activation of neurokinin receptors, in particular the NK1 receptor, by excessive release of substance P and other neurokinins in panicular cells such as cells in the neuronal plexi of the gastrointestinal tract, unmyelinated primary sensory afferent neurons, sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons and nonneuronal cell types (DN&amp;P 8(1), February 1995, p. 5-23, "Neurokinin Receptors" by Longmore J. et al.; Pharmacological Reviews 46(4), 1994, p. 551-599, "Receptors and Antagonists for Substance P and Related Peptides" by Regoli et al.)-<br>
The compounds of the present invention are potent inhibitors of neurokinin-mediated effects, in particular those mediated via the NK1 receptor, and may therefore be described as tachykinin antagonists, especially as substance P antagonists, as indicated in vitro by the antagonism of substance P-induced relaxation of pig coronary arteries which is described hereinafter. The binding affinity of the present compounds for the human, guinea-pig and gerbil neurokinin receptors may be determined in vitro in a receptor binding test using 3H-substance-P as radioligand. The subject compounds also show substance-P antagonistic activity in vivo as may be evidenced by, for instance, the antagonism of substance P-induced plasma extravasation in guinea-pigs, or the antagonism of drug-induced emesis in ferrets (Watson et al., Br. J. Pharmacol. 115, 84-94, 1995).<br>
In view of their capability to antagonize the actions of tachykinins by blocking the tachykinin receptors, and in particular antagonizing the actions of substance P by blocking the NK1 receptor, the subject compounds are useful in the prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of tachykinin-mediated diseases such as, for example, -   pain, in particular traumatic pain such as postoperative pain; traumatic avulsion pain such as brachial plexus; chronic pain such as arthritic pain such as occurring in osteo-, rheumatoid or psoriatic arthritis; neuropathic pain such as post-herpetic neuralgia, trigeminal neuralgia, segmental or intercostal neuralgia, fibromyalgia, causalgia, peripheral neuropathy, diabetic neuropathy, chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, AIDS-related neuropathy, occipital neuralgia, geniculate neuralgia, glossopharyngeal neuralgia, reflex sympathetic dystrophy, phantom limb pain; various forms of headache such as migraine, acute or chronic tension headache, temperomandibular pain, maxillary sinus pain, cluster headache; odontalgia; cancer pain; pain of visceral origin; gastrointestinal pain; nerve entrapment pain; sport's injury pain; dysmennorrhoea; menstrual pain; meningitis; arachnoiditis; musculoskeletal pain; low back pain e.g. spinal stenosis; prolapsed disc; sciatica; angina; ankylosing<br><br>

The compounds of the present invention have a favourable metabolic stability and exhibit good oral availability. They also have an advantageous onset and duration of action. The compounds of formula (I) also have the ability to penetrate the central nervous system as may be demonstrated in vivo by their inhibitory effect on the change in behaviour induced by intracerebroventricular-applied substance P in the gerbil.<br>
In view of the utility of the compounds of formula (I), there is provided a method of treating warm-blooded animals, including humans, suffering from tachykinin-mediated diseases as mentioned hereinabove, in particular, pain, emesis or asthma. Said method comprises the systemic admini.stration of an effective tachykinin antagonizing amount of a compound of formula (T), a TV-oxide form, a pharmaceutically acceptable addition salt or a possible stereoisomeric form thereof, to warm-blooded animals, including humans. Hence, the use of a compound of formula (F) as a medicine is provided, and in particular a medicine to treat pain, emesis or asthma.<br>
For ease of administration, the subject compounds may be formulated into various pharmaceutical forms for administration purposes. To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, a therapeutically effective amount of the particular compound, optionally in addition salt form, as the active ingredient is combined in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. These pharmaceutical compositions are desirably in unitary dosage form suitable, preferably, for administration orally, rectally, percutaneously, or by parenteral injection. For example, in preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as suspensions, syrups, elixirs and solutions; or solid carriers such as starches, sugars, kaolin, lubricants, binders', disintegrating agents and the like in the case of powders, pills, capsules and tablets. Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the most<br><br>
-20-<br>
advantageous oral dosage unit form, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. For parenteral compositions, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, at least in large pan, though other ingredients, for example, to aid solubility, may be included. Injectable solutions, for example, may be prepared in which the carrier comprises saline solution, glucose solution or a mixture of saline and glucose solution. Injectable solutions containing compounds of formula (I) may be formulated in an oil for prolonged action. Appropriate oils for this purpose are, for example, peanut oil, sesame oil, cottonseed oil, corn oil, soy bean oil, synthetic glycerol esters of long chain fatty acids and mixtures of these and other oils. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed. In the compositions suitable for percutaneous administration, the carrier optionally comprises a penetration enhancing agent and/or a suitable wettable agent, optionally combined with suitable additives of any nature in minor proportions, which additives do not cause any significant deleterious effects on the skin. Said additives may facilitate the administration to the skin and/or may be helpful for preparing the desired compositions. These compositions may be administered in various ways, e.g., as a transdermal patch, as a spot-on or as an ointment. Acid or base addition salts of compounds of formula (I) due to their increased water solubility over the corresponding base or acid form, are obviously more suitable in the preparation of aqueous compositions.<br>
In order to enhance the solubility and/or the stability of the compounds of formula (I) in pharmaceutical compositions, it can be advantageous to employ a-, ^ or y-cyclo-dextrins or their derivatives, in particular hydroxyalkyi substituted cyclodextrins, e.g. 2-hydroxypropyl-P-cyclodextrin. Also co-solvents such as alcohols may improve the solubility and/or the stability of the compounds of formula (I) in pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used in the specification and claims herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. Examples of such dosage unit forms are tablets (including scored or coated tablets), capsules, pills, powder packets, wafers, injectable solutions or suspensions, teaspoonfuls, tablespoonfuls and the like, and segregated multiples thereof.<br><br>
-21-<br>
Those of skill in the treatment of tachykinin mediated diseases could determine the effective therapeutic daily amount from the test results presented hereinafter. An effective therapeutic daily amount would be from about 0.001 mg/kg to about 40 mg/kg body weight, more preferably from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 5 mg/kg body weight. It may be appropriate to administer the therapeutically effective dose once daily or as two, three, four or more sub-doses at appropriate intervals throughout the day. Said sub-doses may be formulated as unit dosage forms, for example, containing 0.05 mg to 500 mg, and in particular, 0.5 mg to 50 mg of active ingredient per unit dosage form.<br>
The exact dosage and frequency of administration depends on the particular compound of formula (I) used, the particular condition being treated, the severity of the condition being treated, the age, weight and general physical condition of the particular patient as well as other medication the patient may be taking, as is well known to those skilled in the art. Furthermore, it is evident that said effective daily amount may be lowered or increased depending on the response of the treated patient and/or depending on the evaluation of the physician prescribing the compounds of the instant invention. The effective daily amount ranges mentioned hereinabove are therefore only guidelines.<br>
The following examples are intended to illustrate and not to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>

Example C.2 : Antagonism of substance P induced plasma extravasation in guinea-pigs Plasma extravasation was induced by injection of substance P (2 mg/kg) in the femoral artery of female guinea-pigs. Evans Blue dye (30 mg/kg) was injected simultaneously. The test compound or solvent was administered 1 hour prior to substance P injection.  10 minutes after challenge, the animals were checked for blue colouring (a direct measure for plasma extravasation) of the nose, the forepaws, and the conjunctiva. 30 minutes after challenge, the animals were sacrificed by CO2 gas inhalation and checked for blue colouring of the trachea and the urinary bladder. Doses which actively inhibit substance<br><br>

P-induced plasma extravasation are defined as thoses doses at which only 1/3 or less of the total surface area of the nose, forepaws, conjunctiva, trachea or urinary bladder are coloured blue by an intensive exuavasation. Table 7 lists the lowest active doses (LAD) in mg/kg for the tested compounds.<br>
