application Serial No. 60/383,200, filed May 24, 2001, both of which are<br>

Government Funding<br>
The invention described herein was made with government support<br>
under Grant Number (R01-HL37942), awarded by the National Science<br>
Foundation. The United States Government has certain rights in the invention.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The inflammatory response serves the purpose of eliminating harmful<br>
agents from the body. There is a wide range of pathogenic insults that can<br>
initiate an inflammatory response including infection, allergens, autoimmune<br>
stimuli, immune response to transplanted tissue, noxious chemicals, and toxins,<br>
ischemia/reperfusion, hypoxia, mechanical and thermal trauma. Inflammation<br>
normally is a very localized action which serves in expulsion, attenuation by<br>
dilution, and isolation of the damaging agent and injured tissue. The body's<br>
response becomes an agent of disease when it results in inappropriate injury to<br>
host tissues in the process of eliminating the targeted agent, or responding to a<br>
traumatic insult.<br>
As examples, inflammation is a component of pathogenesis in several<br>
vascular diseases or injuries. Examples include: ischemia/reperfusion injury (N.<br>
G. Frangogiannis et al., in Myocardial Ischemia: Mechanisms, Reperfusion,<br>
Protection, M. Karmazyn, ed., Birkhuser Verlag (1996) at 236-284; H. S.<br>
Sharma et al., Med, of Inflamm., 6,175 (1987)), atherosclerosis (R. Ross,<br>
Nature, 362. 801 (1993)), inflammatory aortic aneurysms (N. Girardi et al, Ann.<br>
Thor. Surg.. 64, 251 (1997); D. I. Walker et al., Brit. J. Surg., 59, 609 (1972); R.<br><br>
L. Pennell et al., J. Vase. Surg., 2, 859 (1985)), and restenosis following balloon<br>
angioplasty (see, R. Ross cited above). The cells involved with inflammation<br>
include leukocytes (i.e., the immune system cells - neutrophils, eosinophils,<br>
lymphocytes, monocytes, basophils, macrophages, dendritic cells, and mast<br>
cells), the vascular endothelium, vascular smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and<br>
myocytes.<br>
The release of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-<br>
alpha (TNFα) by leukocytes is a means by which the immune system combats<br>
pathogenic invasions, including infections. TNFα stimulates the expression and<br>
activation of adherence factors on leukocytes and endothelial cells, primes<br>
neutrophils for an enhanced inflammatory response to secondary stimuli and<br>
enhances adherent neutrophil oxidative activity. See, Sharma et al., cited above.<br>
In addition, macrophages/dendritic cells act as accessory cells processing antigen<br>
for presentation to lymphocytes. The lymphocytes, in turn, become stimulated<br>
to act as pro-inflammatory cytotoxic cells.<br>
Generally, cytokines stimulate neutrophils to enhance oxidative (e.g.,<br>
superoxide and secondary products) and nonoxidative (e.g., myeloperoxidase<br>
and other enzymes) inflammatory activity. Inappropriate and over-release of<br>
cytokines can produce counterproductive exaggerated pathogenic effects through<br>
the release of tissue-damaging oxidative and nonoxidative products (K. G.<br>
Tracey et al., J. Exp. Med.. 167. 1211 (1988); and D. N. Mannel et al., Rev.<br>
Infect. Pis.. 9 (suppl. 5), S602-S606 (1987)). For example, TNFα can induce<br>
neutrophils to adhere to the blood vessel wall and then to migrate through the<br>
vessel to the site of injury and release their oxidative and non-oxidative<br>
inflammatory products.<br>
Although monocytes collect slowly at inflammatory foci, given<br>
favorable conditions, the monocytes develop into long-term resident accessory<br>
cells and macrophages. Upon stimulation with an inflammation trigger,<br>
monocytes/macrophages also produce and secrete an array of cytokines<br>
(including TNFa), complement, lipids, reactive oxygen species, proteases and<br>
growth factors that remodel tissue and regulate surrounding tissue functions.<br>
For example, inflammatory cytokines have been shown to be<br>
pathogenic in: arthritis (C. A. Dinarello, Semin. Immunol.. 4,133 (1992));<br><br>
It has been suggested that there is more than one subtype of adenosine<br>
receptor on neutrophils that can have opposite effects on superoxide release (B.<br>
N. Cronstein et al., J. Clin. Invest., 85, 1150 (1990)). The existence of A2A<br>
receptor on neutrophils was originally demonstrated by Van Calker et al. (D.<br>
Van Calker et al, Eur. J. Pharmacology, 206, 285 (1991)).<br>
There has been progressive development of compounds that are more<br>
and more potent and/or selective as agonists of A2A adenosine receptors (AR)<br>
based on radioligand binding assays and physiological responses. Initially,<br>
compounds with little or no selectivity for A2A receptors were developed, such as<br>
adenosine itself or 5'-carboxamides of adenosine, such as 5'-N-<br>
ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA) (B. N. Cronstein et al., J. Immunol, 135,<br>
1366 (1985)). Later, it was shown that addition of 2-alkylamino substituents<br>
increased potency and selectivity, e.g., CV1808 and CGS21680 (M. F. Jarvis et<br>
al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther.. 251, 888 (1989)). 2-Alkoxy-substituted adenosine<br>
derivatives such as WRC-0090 are even more potent and selective as agonists at<br>
the coronary artery A2A receptor (M. Ueeda et al., J. Med. Chem., 34,1334<br>
(1991)). The 2-alklylhydrazino adenosine derivatives, e.g., SHA 211 (also<br>
called WRC-0474) have also been evaluated as agonists at the coronary artery<br>
A2A receptor (K. Niiya et al., J. Med. Chem., 35,4557 (1992)).<br>
There is one report of the combination of relatively nonspecific<br>
adenosine analogs, R-phenylisopropyladenosine (R-PIA) and 2-chloroadenosine<br>
(CI-Ado) with a phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor resulting in a lowering of<br>
neutrophil oxidative activity (M. A. Iannone et al., Topics and Perspectives in<br>
Adenosine Research. E. Garlach et al., eds., Springer-Verlag, Berlin, pp. 286-<br>
298 (1987)). However, R-PIA and Cl-Ado analogs are actually more potent<br>
activators of A1 adenosine receptors than of A2A adenosine receptors and, thus,<br>
are likely to cause side effects due to activation of A1 receptors on cardiac<br>
muscle and other tissues causing effects such as "heart block."<br>
R. A. Olsson et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,278,150) disclose selective<br>
adenosine A2 receptor agonists of the formula:<br><br>
ischemia (A. Seekamp et al., Agents-Actions-Supp., 41, 137 (1993)); septic<br>
shock (D. N. Mannel et al., Rev. Infect. Pis.. 9 (suppl. 5), S602-S606 (1987));<br>
asthma (N. M. Cembrzynska et al., Am. Rev. Respir. Pis., 147, 291 (1993));<br>
organ transplant rejection (P. K. Imagawa et al., Transplantation, 51, 57 (1991);<br>
multiple sclerosis (H. P. Hartung, Ann. Neurol.. 33, 591 (1993)); ADDS (T.<br>
Matsuyama et al., AEDS, 5, 1405 (1991)); and in alkali-burned eyes (F.<br>
Miyamoto et al., Opthalmic Res., 30,168 (1997)). In addition, superoxide<br>
formation in leukocytes has been implicated in promoting replication of the<br>
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (S. Legrand-Poels et al, AIPS Res. Hum.<br>
Retroviruses. 6, 1389 (1990)).<br>
It is well known that adenosine and some analogs of adenosine that<br>
nonselectively activate adenosine receptor subtypes decrease neutrophil<br>
production of inflammatory oxidative products (B. N. Cronstein et al., Ann. N.Y.<br>
Acad. Sci„ 451. 291 (1985); P. A. Roberts et al., Biochem. J.. 227.669 (1985);<br>
P. J. Schrier et al., J. Immunol.. 137. 3284 (1986); B. N. Cronstein et al.,<br>
Clinical Immunol, and Immunopath., 42, 76 (1987); M. A. Iannone et al., in<br>
Topics and Perspective in Adenosine Research, E. Gerlach et al., eds., Springer-<br>
Verlag, Berlin, p. 286 (1987); S. T. McGarrity et al., J. Leukocyte Biol.. 44,<br>
411421 (1988); J. Pe La Harpe et al, J. Immunol.. 143, 596 (1989); S. T.<br>
McGarrity et al., J. Immunol.. 142,1986 (1989); and C. P. Nielson et al., Br. J.<br>
Pharmacol.. 97, 882 (1989)). For example, adenosine has been shown to inhibit<br>
superoxide release from neutrophils stimulated by chemoattractants such as the<br>
synthetic mimic of bacterial peptides, f-met-leu-phe (fMLP), and the<br>
complement component Csa (B. N. Cronstein et al., J. Immunol., 135,1366<br>
(1985)). Adenosine can decrease the greatly enhanced oxidative burst of PMN<br>
(neutrophil) first primed with TNF-a and then stimulated by a second stimulus<br>
such as f-met-leu-phe (G. W. Sullivan et al., Clin. Res.. 41,172A (1993)).<br>
Additionally, it has been reported that adenosine can decrease the rate of HIV<br>
replication in a T-cell line (S. Sipka et al., Acta. Biochim. Biopys. Hung.. 23, 75<br>
(1988)). However, there is no evidence that in vivo adenosine has anti-<br>
inflammatory activity (G. S. Firestein et al., Clin. Res.. 41, 170A (1993); and B.<br>
N. Cronstein et al., Clin. Res.. 41, 244A (1993)).<br><br><br>
wherein Rib is ribosyl, R1 can be H and R2 can be cycloalkyl. The compounds<br>
are disclosed to be useful for treating hypertension, atherosclerosis and as<br>
vasodilators.<br>
Olsson et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,140,015) disclose certain adenosine A2<br>
receptor agonists of formula:<br><br>
wherein C(X)BR2 can be CH2OH and Rj can be alkyl- or alkoxyalkyl. The<br>
compounds are disclosed to be useful as vasodilators or an antihypertensives.<br>
Linden et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,877,180) is based on the discovery that<br>
certain inflammatory diseases, such as arthritis and asthma, may be effectively<br>
treated by the administration of compounds which are selective agonists of A2A<br>
adenosine receptors, preferably in combination with a Type IV<br>
phosphodiesterase inhibitor. An embodiment of the Linden et al. invention<br>
provides a method for treating inflammatory diseases by administering an<br>
effective amount of an A2A adenosine receptor of the following formula:<br><br><br>
wherein R and X are as described in the patent.<br>
In one embodiment, the Linden et al. invention involves the<br>
administration of a Type IV phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor in combination<br>
with the A2A adenosine receptor agonist. The Type IV phosphodiesterase (PDE)<br>
inhibitor includes racemic and optically active 4-(polyalkoxyphenyI)-2-<br>
pyrrolidones of the following formula:<br><br>
wherein R', R18, R19 and X are as disclosed and described in U.S. Pat.<br>
No. 4,193,926. Rolipram is an example of a suitable Type IV PDE inhibitor<br>
included within the above formula.<br>
G. Cristalli (U.S. Pat. No. 5,593,975) discloses 2-arylethynyl,<br>
2-cycloalkylethynyl or 2-hydroxyalkylethynyl derivatives, wherein the riboside<br>
residue is substituted by carboxy amino, or substituted carboxy amino<br>
(R3HNC(0)-). 2-Alkynylpurine derivatives have been disclosed in Miyasaka et<br>
al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,956,345), wherein the 2-alkynyl group is substituted with<br>
(C3-C16)alkyl. The '975 compounds are disclosed to be vasodilators and to<br>
inhibit platelet aggregation, and thus to be useful as anti-ischemic, anti-<br>
atherosclerosis and anti-hypertensive agents.<br>
Recently, U.S. Patent 6,232,297 to Linden, et al. disclosed compounds<br>
having the general formula:<br><br><br>
wherein each R is H, X is ethylaminocarbonyl and Rl is 4-<br>
carboxycyclohexylmethyl (DWH-146a), R1 is 4-<br>
methoxycarbonylcyclohexylmethyl (DWH-146e) or R1 is 4-acetoxymethyl-<br>
cyclohexylmethyl (JMR-193). These compounds are reported to be A2A<br>
agonists.<br>
However, a continuing need exists for selective A2 adenosine receptor<br>
agonists useful for therapeutic applications, that have reduced side effects.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention comprises compounds and methods of their use<br>
for the treatment of inflammatory activity in mammalian tissue. The<br>
inflammatory tissue activity can be due to pathological agents or can be due to<br>
physical, chemical or thermal trauma, or the trauma of medical procedures, such<br>
as organ, tissue or cell transplantation, angioplasty (PCTA), inflammation<br>
following ischemia/reperfusion, or grafting. The present compounds comprise a<br>
novel class of 2-alkynyladenosine derivatives, substituted at the ethyn-2-yl<br>
position by substituted cycloalkyl and heterocycle (heterocyclic) moieties.<br>
Preferably, the riboside residue is substituted at the 5'-position by an N-alkyl-(or<br>
cycloalkyl)carboxyamino ("aminocarbonyl") moiety ("X"). Thus, the present<br>
invention provides a method for inhibiting the inflammatory response in a<br>
mammal, such as a human subject, and protecting the tissue subject to the<br>
response, by administering an effective amount of one or more compounds of the<br>
invention.<br>

allergy, trauma or ischemia/reperfusion injury, as well as the use of a compound<br>
of formula I for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of an<br>
inflammatory response due to a pathological condition or symptom in a<br>
mammal, such as a human, which is associated with inflammation.<br>
Although certain A2A adenosine receptor agonists have been reported to<br>
be vasodilators, and thus to be useful to directly treat hypertension, thrombus,<br>
atherosclerosis and the like, the tissue-protective anti-inflammatory activity of<br>
the compounds of formula (I) is not suggested by the prior art.<br>
The invention also includes the use of a combination of these<br>
compounds with type IV phosphodiesterase inhibitors to preferably cause<br>
synergistic decreases in the inflammatory response mediated by leukocytes.<br>
The invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising<br>
an effective amount of the compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt thereof, in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
diluent or carrier, and optionally, in combination with a Type IV<br>
phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor. Preferably, the composition is presented as a<br>
unit dosage form.<br>
Additionally, the invention provides a therapeutic method for<br>
preventing or treating a pathological condition or symptom in a mammal, such as<br>
a human, wherein the activity of A2A adenosine receptors is implicated and<br>
agonism of said receptors is desired, comprising administering to a mammal in<br><br>
need of such therapy, an effective amount of a compound of formula I, or a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. It is believed that activation of A2A<br>
adenosine receptors inhibits inflammation by affecting neutrophils, mast cells,<br>
monocytes/macrophages, platelets T-cells and/or eosinophils. Inhibition of these<br>
inflammatory cells results in tissue protection following tissue insults.<br>
Among the inflammatory responses that can be treated (including<br>
treated prophylactically) with a compound of formula I, optionally with a Type<br>
IV PDE inhibitor, are inflammation due to:<br>
(a)	autoimmune stimulation (autoimmune diseases), such as lupus<br>
erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, infertility from endometriosis, type I diabetes<br>
mellitus including the destruction of pancreatic islets leading to diabetes and the<br>
inflammatory consequences of diabetes, including leg ulcers, Crohn's disease,<br>
ulcerative colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, osteoporosis and rheumatoid<br>
arthritis;<br>
(b)	allergic diseases such as asthma, hay fever, rhinitis, poison<br>
ivy, vernal conjunctivitis and other eosinophil-mediated conditions;<br>
(c)	skin diseases such as psoriasis, contact dermatitis, eczema,<br>
infectious skin ulcers, open wounds, cellulitis;<br>
(d)	infectious diseases including sepsis, septic shock, encephalitis,<br>
infectious arthritis, endotoxic shock, gram negative shock, Jarisch-Herxheimer<br>
reaction, anthrax, plague, tularemia, ebola, shingles, toxic shock, cerebral<br>
malaria, bacterial meningitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), lyme<br>
disease, HIV infection, (TNFα-enhanced HIV replication, TNFα inhibition of<br>
reverse transcriptase inhibitor activity);<br>
(e)	wasting diseases: cachexia secondary to cancer and HIV;<br>
(f)	organ, tissue or cell transplantation (e.g., bone marrow, cornea,<br>
kidney, lung, liver, heart, skin, pancreatic islets) including transplant rejection,<br>
and graft versus host disease;<br>
(g)	adverse effects from drug therapy, including adverse effects<br>
from amphotericin B treatment, adverse effects from immunosuppressive<br>
therapy, e.g., interleukin-2 treatment, adverse effects from OKT3 treatment,<br>
contrast dyes, antibiotics, adverse effects from GM-CSF treatment, adverse<br><br>
effects of cyclosporine treatment, and adverse effects of aminoglycoside<br>
treatment, stomatitis and mucositis due to immunosuppression;<br>
(h) cardiovascular conditions including circulatory diseases<br>
induced or exasperated by an inflammatory response, such as ischemia,<br>
atherosclerosis, peripheral vascular disease, restenosis following angioplasty,<br>
inflammatory aortic aneurysm, vasculitis, stroke, spinal cord injury, congestive<br>
heart failure, hemorrhagic shock, ischemia/reperfusion injury, vasospasm<br>
following subarachnoid hemorrhage, vasospasm following cerebrovascular<br>
accident, pleuritis, pericarditis, and the cardiovascular complications of diabetes;<br>
(i) dialysis, including pericarditis, due to peritoneal dialysis;<br>
(j) gout; and<br>
(k) chemical or thermal trauma due to burns, acid, alkali and the<br>
like.<br>
Of particular interest and efficacy is the use of the present compounds<br>
to limit inflammatory responses where the ischemia/reperfusion injury caused by<br>
angioplasty or throbolysis. Also of particular interest and efficacy is the use of<br>
the present compounds to limit inflammatory responses due to organ, tissue or<br>
cell transplantation, i.e., the transplantation of allogeneic or xenogeneic tissue<br>
into a mammalian recipient, autoimmune diseases and inflammatory conditions<br>
due to circulatory pathologies and the treatment thereof, including angioplasty,<br>
stent placement, shunt placement or grafting. Unexpectedly, it was found that<br>
administration of one or more compounds of formula (I) was effective after the<br>
onset of the inflammatory response, e.g., after the subject was afflicted with the<br>
pathology or trauma that initiates the inflammatory response.<br>
Tissue or cells comprising ligand bound receptor sites can be used to<br>
measure the selectively of test compounds for specific receptor subtypes, the<br>
amount of bioactive compound in blood or other physiological fluids, or can be<br>
used as a tool to identify potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of<br>
diseases or conditions associated with receptor site activation, by contacting said<br>
agents with said ligand-receptor complexes, and measuring the extent of<br>
displacement of the ligand and/or binding of the agent, or the cellular response to<br>
said agent {e.g., cAMP accumulation).<br><br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The following definitions are used, unless otherwise described. Halo is<br>
fluoro, chloro, bromo, or iodo. Alkyl, alkoxy, aralkyl, alkylaryl, etc. denote both<br>
straight and branched alkyl groups; but reference to an individual radical such as<br>
"propyl" embraces only the straight chain radical, a branched chain isomer such<br>
as "isopropyl" being specifically referred to. Aryl includes a phenyl radical or<br>
an ortho-fused bicyclic carbocyclic radical having about nine to ten ring atoms in<br>
which at least one ring is aromatic. Heteroaryl encompasses a radical attached<br>
via a ring carbon of a monocyclic aromatic ring containing five or six ring atoms<br>
consisting of carbon and one to four heteroatoms each selected from the group<br>
consisting of non-peroxide oxygen, sulfur, and N(X) wherein X is absent or is H,<br>
O, (C1-C4)alkyl, phenyl or benzyl, as well as a radical of an ortho-fused bicyclic<br>
heterocycle of about eight to ten ring atoms derived therefrom, particularly a<br><br>
benz-derivative or one derived by fusing a propylene, trimethylene, or<br>
tetramethylene diradical thereto.<br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the compounds of<br>
formula (I) have more than one chiral center and may be isolated in optically<br>
active and racemic forms. Preferably, the riboside moiety of formula (I) is<br>
derived from D-ribose, i.e., the 3',4'-hydroxyl groups are alpha to the sugar ring<br>
and the 2' and 5' groups is beta (3R, 4S, 2R, 5S). When the two groups on the<br>
cyclohexyl group are in the 1- and 4-position, they are preferably trans. Some<br>
compounds may exhibit polymorphism. It is to be understood that the present<br>
invention encompasses any racemic, optically-active, polymorphic, or<br>
stereoisomeric form, or mixtures thereof, of a compound of the invention, which<br>
possess the useful properties described herein, it being well known in the art how<br>
to prepare optically active forms (for example, by resolution of the racemic form<br>
by recrystallization techniques, or enzymatic techniques, by synthesis from<br>
optically-active starting materials, by chiral synthesis, or by chromatographic<br>
separation using a chiral stationary phase) and how to determine adenosine<br>
agonist activity using the tests described herein, or using other similar tests<br>
which are well known in the art.<br>

Heteroaryl denotes a radical of a monocyclic aromatic ring containing five or six<br>
ring atoms consisting of carbon and 1, 2, 3, or 4 heteroatoms each selected from<br>
the group consisting of non-peroxide oxygen, sulfur, and N(Y) wherein Y is<br>
absent or is H, O, (C1-C8)alkyl, phenyl or benzyl, as well as a radical of an<br>
ortho-fused bicyclic heterocycle of about eight to ten ring atoms derived<br>
therefrom, particularly a benz-derivative or one derived by fusing a propylene,<br>
trimethylene, or tetramethylene diradical thereto.<br>
The term "heterocycle" generally represents a non aromatic<br>
heterocyclic group, having from 3 to about 10 ring atoms, which can be saturated<br>
or partially unsaturated, containing at least one heteroatom {e.g., 1, 2, or 3)<br>
selected from the group consisting of oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur. Specific,<br>
"heterocycle" groups include monocyclic, bicyclic, or tricyclic groups<br>
containing one or more heteroatoms selected from the group consisting of<br><br>
oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur. A "heterocycle" group also can include one or<br>
more oxo groups (=O) attached to a ring atom. Nonlimiting examples of<br>
heterocycle groups include 1,3-dioxolane, 1,4-dioxane, 1,4-dithiane, 2H-pyran,<br>

hydrocarbon chain (e.g. ethylene -CH2CH2-).<br>
The term "aryl(C1-C8)alkylene" for example includes benzyl,<br>
phenethyl, naphthylmethyl and the like.<br>
The carbon atom content of various hydrocarbon-containing moieties is<br>
indicated by a prefix designating the minimum and maximum number of carbon<br>
atoms in the moiety, i.e., the prefix Cj-Cj indicates a moiety of the integer "i" to<br>
the integer "j" carbon atoms, inclusive. Thus, for example, (C1-C8)alkyl refers to<br>
alkyl of one to eight carbon atoms, inclusive.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are generally named according<br>
to the IUPAC or CAS nomenclature system. Abbreviations which are well<br>
known to one of ordinary skill in the art may be used (e.g., "Ph" for phenyl,<br>
"Me" for methyl, "Et" for ethyl, "h" for hour or hours and "rt" for room<br>
temperature).<br>

Compounds of the invention can generally be prepared as illustrated in<br>
Schemes 1A and 1B below. Starting materials can be prepared by procedures<br><br>
described in these schemes, procedures described in the General methods below<br>
or by procedures that would be well known to one of ordinary skill in organic<br>
chemistry. The variables used in Schemes 1A and Scheme 1B are as defined<br>
herein or as in the claims.<br>
The preparation of alkynyl cycloalkanols is illustrated in Scheme 1A.<br>
A solution of an appropriate cycloalkanone (where j is from 0-5) is prepared in a<br>
solvent such as THF. A solution of a suitable ethynylmagnesium halide<br>
compound in a solvent is added to the cycloalkanone. After additioin, the<br>
solution is allowed to stir at about 20°C for about 20 hours. The reaction is<br>
monitored via TLC until the starting material is consumed. The reaction is<br>
quenched with water, filtered over a plug of sand and silica, washed with a<br>
solvent, such as EtOAc, and evaporated to provide the product. Typically, two<br>
products are formed, the isomers formed by the axial/equatorial addition of the<br>
alkyne (where m is as defined above, and the sum of ml and m2 is from 0 to<br>
about 7) to the ketone. The compounds are purified via flash chromatography<br>
using EtOAc/Hexanes to provide the product.<br><br>
The preparation of 2-alkynyladenosines is illustrated in Scheme 1B. A<br>
flame-dried round bottom under nitrogen is charged with 5-(6-Amino-2-iodo-<br>
purin-9-yl)-3,4-dihydroxytetrahydrofuran-2-carboxylic acid ethylamide (NECA<br>
2-Iodoadenosine) and a solvent such as DMF. The appropriate alkyne, wherein<br><br>
R is a -(CR1-iR2)mZ group, is dissolved in acetonitrile followed by TEA, 5 mole %<br>
Pd(PPh3)4, and Cul. All solvents are thoroughly degassed.<br>
The solution is allowed to stir for about 24 hours at room temperature,<br>
and monitored until complete by HPLC. If the reaction is not complete after this<br>
time, additional catalyst, Cul, and TEA are added. After the reaction is<br>
complete, the solvents are removed under high-vacuum and the residue taken up<br>
in a small amount of DMF. This product is isolated using preparative silica<br>
TLC. The product is purified by RP-HPLC.<br><br>
Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts are organic acid<br>
addition salts formed with acids which form a physiological acceptable anion,<br>
for example, tosylate, methanesulfonate, malate, acetate, citrate, malonate,<br>
tartarate, succinate, benzoate, ascorbate, -ketoglutarate, and<br>
-glycerophosphate. Suitable inorganic salts may also be formed, including<br>
hydrochloride, sulfate, nitrate, bicarbonate, and carbonate salts.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be obtained using standard<br>
procedures well known in the art, for example by reacting a sufficiently basic<br>
compound such as an amine with a suitable acid affording a physiologically<br>
acceptable anion. Alkali metal (for example, sodium, potassium or lithium) or<br>
alkaline earth metal (for example calcium) salts of carboxylic acids can also be<br>
made.<br>
The compounds of formula I can be formulated as pharmaceutical<br>
compositions and administered to a mammalian host, such as a human patient in<br><br>
a variety of forms adapted to the chosen route of administration, i.e., orally or<br>
parenterally, by intravenous, intramuscular, topical or subcutaneous routes.<br>
Thus, the present compounds may be systemically administered, e.g.,<br>
orally, in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle such as an<br>
inert diluent or an assimilable edible carrier. They may be enclosed in hard or<br>
soft shell gelatin capsules, may be compressed into tablets, or may be<br>
incorporated directly with the food of the patient's diet. For oral therapeutic<br>
administration, the active compound may be combined with one or more<br>
excipients and used in the form of ingestible tablets, buccal tablets, troches,<br>
capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, and the like. Such compositions<br>
and preparations should contain at least 0.1% of active compound. The<br>
percentage of the compositions and preparations may, of course, be varied and<br>
may conveniently be between about 2 to about 60% of the weight of a given unit<br>
dosage form. The amount of active compound in such therapeutically useful<br>
compositions is such that an effective dosage level will be obtained.<br>
The tablets, troches, pills, capsules, and the like may also contain the<br>
following: binders such as gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin;<br>
excipients such as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent such as corn<br>
starch, potato starch, alginic acid and the like; a lubricant such as magnesium<br>
stearate; and a sweetening agent such as sucrose, fructose, lactose or aspartame<br>
or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, or cherry flavoring<br>
may be added. When the unit dosage form is a capsule, it may contain, in<br>
addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier, such as a vegetable oil or<br>
a polyethylene glycol. Various other materials may be present as coatings or to<br>
otherwise modify the physical form of the solid unit dosage form. For instance,<br>
tablets, pills, or capsules may be coated with gelatin, wax, shellac or sugar and<br>
the like. A syrup or elixir may contain the active compound, sucrose or fructose<br>
as a sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and<br>
flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor. Of course, any material used in<br>
preparing any unit dosage form should be pharmaceutically acceptable and<br>
substantially non-toxic in the amounts employed. In addition, the active<br>
compound may be incorporated into sustained-release preparations and devices.<br><br>
The active compound may also be administered intravenously or<br>
intraperitoneally by infusion or injection. Solutions of the active compound or<br>
its salts can be prepared in water, optionally mixed with a nontoxic surfactant.<br>
Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols,<br>
triacetin, and mixtures thereof and in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage<br>
and use, these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of<br>
microorganisms.<br>
The pharmaceutical dosage forms suitable for injection or infusion can<br>
include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions or sterile powders comprising the<br>
active ingredient which are adapted for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile<br>
injectable or infusible solutions or dispersions, optionally encapsulated in<br>
liposomes. In all cases, the ultimate dosage form must be sterile, fluid and stable<br>
under the conditions of manufacture and storage. The liquid carrier or vehicle<br>
can be a solvent or liquid dispersion medium comprising, for example, water,<br>
ethanol, a polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, liquid polyethylene<br>
glycols, and the like), vegetable oils, nontoxic glyceryl esters, and suitable<br>
mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the<br>
formation of liposomes, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the<br>
case of dispersions or by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of<br>
microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and antifungal<br>
agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal,<br>
and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for<br>
example, sugars, buffers or sodium chloride. Prolonged absorption of the<br>
injectable compositions can be brought about by the use in the compositions of<br>
agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.<br>
Sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the active<br>
compound in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various of the<br>
other ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filter sterilization.<br>
In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions,<br>
the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and the freeze drying<br>
techniques, which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional<br>
desired ingredient present in the previously sterile-filtered solutions.<br><br>
For topical administration, the present compounds may be applied in<br>
pure form, i.e., when they are liquids. However, it will generally be desirable to<br>
administer them to the skin as compositions or formulations, in combination<br>
with a dermatologically acceptable carrier, which may be a solid, a liquid or in a<br>
dermatological patch.<br>
Useful solid carriers include finely divided solids such as talc, clay,<br>
microcrystalline cellulose, silica, alumina and the like. Useful liquid carriers<br>
include water, alcohols or glycols or water-alcohol/glycol blends, in which the<br>
present compounds can be dissolved or dispersed at effective levels, optionally<br>
with the aid of non-toxic surfactants. Adjuvants such as fragrances and<br>
additional antimicrobial agents can be added to optimize the properties for a<br>
given use. The resultant liquid compositions can be applied from absorbent<br>
pads, used to impregnate bandages and other dressings, or sprayed onto the<br>
affected area using pump-type or aerosol sprayers.<br>
Thickeners such as synthetic polymers, fatty acids, fatty acid salts and<br>
esters, fatty alcohols, modified celluloses or modified mineral materials can also<br>
be employed with liquid carriers to form spreadable pastes, gels, ointments,<br>
soaps, and the like, for application directly to the skin of the user.<br>
Examples of useful dermatological compositions, which can be used to<br>
deliver the compounds of formula I to the skin are disclosed in Jacquet et al.<br>
(U.S. Pat. No. 4,608,392), Geria (U.S. Pat. No. 4,992,478), Smith et al. (U.S.<br>
Pat. No. 4,559,157) and Wortzman (U.S. Pat. No. 4,820,508).<br>
Useful dosages of the compounds of formula I can be determined by<br>
comparing their in vitro activity, and in vivo activity in animal models. Methods<br>
for the extrapolation of effective dosages in mice, and other animals, to humans<br>
are known to the art; for example, see U.S. Pat. No. 4,938,949. Useful dosages<br>
of Type IV PDE inhibitors are known to the art. For example, see, U.S. Pat. No.<br>
5,877,180, Col. 12.<br>
Generally, the concentration of the compound(s) of formula (I) in a<br>
liquid composition, such as a lotion, will be from about 0.1-25% wt-%,<br>
preferably from about 0.5-10 wt-%. The concentration in a semi-solid or solid<br>
composition such as a gel or a powder will be about 0.1-5 wt-%, preferably<br>
about 0.5-2.5 wt-%.<br><br>
The amount of the compound, or an active salt or derivative thereof,<br>
required for use in treatment will vary not only with the particular salt selected<br>
but also with the route of administration, the nature of the condition being<br>
treated and the age and condition of the patient and will be ultimately at the<br>
discretion of the attendant physician or clinician.<br>
In general, however, a suitable dose will be in the range of from about<br>
0.5 to about 100 µg/kg, e.g., from about 10 to about 75 fig/kg of body weight per<br>
day, such as 3 to about 50 µg per kilogram body weight of the recipient per day,<br>
preferably in the range of 6 to 90 µg/kg/day, most preferably in the range of 15<br>
to 60 µg/kg/day.<br>
The compound is conveniently administered in unit dosage form; for<br>
example, containing 5 to 1000 µg, conveniently 10 to 750 µg, most conveniently,<br>
50 to 500 µg of active ingredient per unit dosage form.<br>
Ideally, the active ingredient should be administered to achieve peak<br>
plasma concentrations of the active compound of from about 0.1 to about 10 nM,<br>
preferably, about 0.2 to 10 nM, most preferably, about 0.5 to about 5 nM. This<br>
may be achieved, for example, by the intravenous injection of a 0.05 to 5%<br>
solution of the active ingredient, optionally in saline, or orally administered as a<br>
bolus containing about 1-100 µg of the active ingredient. Desirable blood levels<br>
may be maintained by continuous infusion to provide about 0.01-5.0 µg/kg/hr or<br>
by intermittent infusions containing about 0.4-15 µg/kg of the active<br>
ingredient(s).<br>
The desired dose may conveniently be presented in a single dose or as<br>
divided doses administered at appropriate intervals, for example, as two, three,<br>
four or more sub-doses per day. The sub-dose itself may be further divided, e.g.,<br>
into a number of discrete loosely spaced administrations; such as multiple<br>
inhalations from an insufflator or by application of a plurality of drops into the<br>
eye. For example, it is desirable to administer the present compositions<br>
intravenously over an extended period of time following the insult that gives rise<br>
to inflammation.<br>
The ability of a given compound of the invention to act as an A2A<br>
adenosine receptor agonist (or antagonist) may be determined using<br><br>
pharmacological models which are well known to the art, or using tests<br>
described below.<br>
The invention will be further described by reference to the following<br>
detailed examples, which are given for illustration of the invention, and are not<br>
intended to be limiting thereof.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
All melting points were determined with a Thomas Hoover capillary<br>
melting point apparatus and are uncorrected. Nuclear magnetic resonance<br>
spectra for proton (1H NMR) were recorded on a 300 MHz GE<br>
spectrophotometer. The chemical shift values are expressed in ppm (parts per<br>
million) relative to tetramethylsilane. For data reporting, s = singlet, d =<br>
doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet, and m = multiplet. Mass spectra were measured<br>
on a Finnigan LcQ Classic. High resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) data<br>
was provided by the Nebraska Center for Mass Spectrometry. Analytical HPLC<br>
was done on a Waters 2690 Separation Module with a Waters Symmetry C8 (2.1<br>
x 150 mm) column operated at room temperature. Compounds were eluted at<br>
200 µL/min with 70:30 acetonitrile:water, containing 0.5% acetic acid, with UV<br>
detection at 214 nm using a Waters 486 Tunable Detector. Preparative HPLC<br>
was performed on a Shimadzu Discovery HPLC with a Shim-pack VP-ODS C18<br>
(20 x 100 mm) column operated at room temperature. Compounds were eluted<br>
at 30mL/min with a gradient 20-80% of water (containing 0.1% TFA) to<br>
methanol over 15 minutes with UV detection at 214 nm using a SPD10A VP<br>
Tunable detector. All final compounds presented here were determined to be<br>
greater than 98% pure by HPLC. Flash chromatography was performed on<br>
Silicyle 60A gel (230-400 mesh) or using reusable chromatography columns and<br>
system from RT Scientific, Manchester NH. Analytical thin-layer<br>
chromatography was done on Merck Kieselgel 60 F254 aluminum sheets.<br>
Preparative thin-layer chromatography was done using 1000 micron Analtech<br>
Uniplate with silica gel. All reactions were done under a nitrogen atmosphere in<br>
flame-dried glassware unless otherwise stated.<br><br><br>
To a solution of about 10 mmol of the appropriate cyclohexanone in<br>
about 50 mL of THF is added to about 60 mL (30 mmol) of 0.5 M<br>
ethynylmagnesium bromide in THF. The solution is allowed to stir at about<br>
20°C for about 20 hours. After the starting material had been consumed,<br>
monitored by TLC, the reaction is quenched with about 5 mL of water, filtered<br>
over a plug of sand and silica, washed with EtOAc, and evaporated to yield a<br>
yellow oil. Usually the oil contained two spots on TLC with 20%<br>
EtOAc/Hexanes, which are visualized with Vanillin. Usually these two products<br>
are the different isomers formed by the axial/equatorial addition of the alkyne to<br>
the ketone. The compounds are purified via flash chromatography using 10%<br>
EtOAc/Hexanes to provide clear oils or white solids in a yield of about 50-80 %.<br><br>
To a solution of of the appropriate piperazine/piperadine(about 10.0<br>
mmol), in about 20 mL acetonitrile, is added about 12.0 mmol of propargyl<br>
bromide (80% stabilized in toluene) and about 50.0 mmol of anhydrous<br>
potassium carbonate. The reaction mixture is filtered, and evaporated to<br>
dryness. The resiude is taken up in about 50 mL of dichloromethane/water and<br>
the organic layers removed. The aqueous layer is washed with an additional 3 x<br>
25 mL dichloromethane. The organic layer is dried using anhydrous sodium<br>
sulfate, filtered, and concentrated to provide the crude product, which is purified<br>
using column chromatography.<br><br><br>
To about 100 mg of the appropriate Boc-protected<br>
piperazine/piperadine is added 2-4 mL of neat TFA. The solution is allowed to<br>
stir for 6 hours. The TFA is removed under reduced pressure to yield a yellow<br>
oil. This oil is taken up in about 10 mL of dichloromethane to which is added<br>

ethylamide (2-Iodoadenosine) (about 40 mg) (X = CH3CH2NHC(O)-) and<br>
dissolved in about 2 mL of DMF. The appropriate alkyne (approx. 0. 1mL) is<br>
then added followed by about 4mL of acetonitrile and about 0. 1mL of TEA. All<br>
three solvents had been degassed with nitrogen for at least 24 hours. To this<br>
solution is added 5 mole percent Pd(PPh3)4 and 6 mole % copper iodide. The<br>
yellowish solution is allowed to stir for 24 hours at room temperature, or until<br>
complete by HPLC. If the reaction is not complete at this time, additional<br>
catalyst, CuI, and TEA are added. After the reaction is complete, the solvents<br><br>
are removed under high-vacuum and the red/black residue taken back up in a<br>
small amount of DMF. This solution is added to a preparative silica TLC plate<br>
(Analtech 1000 microns, 20cm x 20cm) and eluted first with 120 mL of 40%<br>
Hexanes/CH2Cl2, and then again after addition of 40 mL of MeOH. The UV<br>
active band (usually yellow in color) in the middle of the plate is collected,<br>
slowly washed with 4 x 25 mL 20% MeOH/CH2Cl2, and concentrated. This<br>
product is then purified by RP-HPLC.<br><br>

A solution of N-Boc-4-piperidinemethanol, 5.0 g (23.2 mmol) in<br>
chloroform, 50 mL, was prepared. Toluene sulfonyl chloride, 5.75 g (30.2<br>
mmol), in 5.6 mL of pyridine (69.6 mmol) was added. The solution was stirred<br>
under nitrogen allowed to stir for 24 hours. Standard workup and<br>
chromatographic purification provided the title compound. Yield 6.0g<br><br>
To a solution of 1.0 g (8.9 mmol) (R)-(+)-3-methyl-cyclohexanone in<br>
50 mL of THF was added 54 mL (26.7 mmol) of 0.5 M ethynylmagnesium<br>
bromide in THF. The solution was allowed to stir at 20 °C for 20 hours.<br>
Analysis by TLC indicated that the starting material had been consumed. The<br>
reaction was quenched with 5 mL of water, filtered over a plug of sand and<br>
silica, washed with EtOAc, and evaporated to yield 1.15 g of a yellow oil<br>
containing two spots (r.f.'s 0.33 (minor, JR3217A) and 0.25 (major, JR3217B),<br>
20% EtOAc/Hexanes) which were visualized with Vanillin. The compound was<br>
purified via flash chromatography using 10% EtOAc/Hexanes (225 mL silica) to<br>
provide JR3217A and JR3217B.<br><br><br>
To a solution of methyl isonipecotate 3.5g (24.4 mmol, 3.30 mL) in<br>
100 mL dichloromethane was added TEA (1.5 eq, 36.6 mmol, 5.1 mL),<br>
propargyl bromide (3.0eq, 73.2 mmol, 6.5 ml), at room temperature for 36 hrs.<br>
The reaction was quenched with 35 mL water to yield to provide a clear solution.<br>
The solution was extracted with dichloromethane 2x25 mL, dried with Na2S04,<br>
and the solvent evaporated to provide a yellow oil. r.f. (40% EtOAc/Hexanes)<br>
0.26 stains faint white with Vanillin, starting material r.f. 0.05 stains yellow with<br>
Vanillin. The product appeared pure after extraction.<br><br><br>
To a solution of 10.0 g (54.8 mmol) of tert-butyl-1-piperazine<br>
carboxylate in 60 mL acetonitile was added 5.20 mL (60.4 mmol) propargyl<br>
bromide and 37.9 g (274 mmol) anhydrous potassium carbonate. Additional<br>
propargy bromide, 1.5mL, was added after stirring for 36 hours at room<br>
temperature. The residue was evaporated to dryness. Dichloromethane, 50 mL,<br>
and water, 50 mL, were added. The reaction mixture was extracted with CH2Cl2,<br>
4 x 40 mL, dried over magnesium sulfate, and evaporate to provide a brown oil.<br>
The oil was dissolved in dichloromethane and purify with a RT Scientific system<br>
using hexane/ethyl acetate gradient to yield 5.5 g (46%) of yellow oil, which<br>
ultimately crystallized upon standing.<br><br><br>
To a solution of 3g (19.0 mmol) of ethyl N-piperazinecarboxylate in 25<br>
mL of CH3CN was added 1.57g (1.32 mL 20.1mmol) of 2-chloroacetonitrile and<br>
15.6g (95mmol) K2CO3●11/2H2O. The suspension was stirred at room<br>
temperature for 16 hours. The reaction was analyzed using TLC (35% Ethyl<br>
acetate/Hexanes, product r.f. 0.38 vs. sm r.f. of 0.02). The analysis indicated the<br>
reaction was complete. The golden yellow solution was evaporated to dryness.<br>
The residue was extracted with CH2Cl2/H2O, dried with MgSO4, and<br>
concentrated.<br><br>
The title compound was prepared starting with 500 mg (2.52mmol) of<br>
2,5-Diaza--bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2-carboxylic acid tert-butyl ester according to<br>
general method 2.<br><br><br>
To a flame-dried 25 mL round bottom flask under nitrogen was added<br>
2.1 g of 4-Prop-2-ynyl-piperazine-l-carboxylic acid tert-butyl ester. To this<br>
solid was added 5 mL of 98% TFA in 1 mL portions. The solution turned wine<br>
red, bubbled and smoked. The additional portions of TFA were added when this<br>
activity subsided. After the third portion of TFA had been added only minimal<br>
bubbling occurred. The solution was allowed to stir under nitrogen at room<br>
temperature for an additional hour and evaporated under reduced pressure to<br>
yield the product as a thick red syrup. Assumed quantitative yield of 1.16 g.<br>
The residue was suspended in 20 mL dichloromethane and used immediately<br>
without further purification for the preparation of compounds JR4031, JR4033,<br>
and JR4035.<br><br><br><br><br>
To a solution of piperidine-4-carboxylic acid (10 g, 77.5 mmol) and<br>
potassium carbonate (21.4 g, 155 mmol) in 150 mL of water was prepared. A<br>
solution of di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (16.9g, 77.5 mmol) in 40 mL of THF was<br>
added dropwise via addition funnel at 0 °C. The reaction was allowed to warm<br>
to room temperature gradually over 30 minutes and stirred for an additional 4<br>
hours. The THF was removed under reduced pressure and the aqueous phase<br>
extracted with 50 mL of ether. The aqueous phase was then adjusted to pH 2<br>
with 10 % HC1 and extracted with EtOAc, 4 x 50 mL. The combined organic<br>
layers were dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated in<br>
vacuo to yield 17.2 g (97%) of JR3183 as a white solid. Rf = 0.2 (35%<br>

Example 52: Cell culture and membrane preparation.<br>
Sf9 cells were cultured in Grace's medium supplemented with 10%<br>
fetal bovine serum, 2.5 µg/ml amphotericin B and 50 µg/m.1 gentamycin in an<br>
atmosphere of 50% N2/50% O2. Viral infection was performed at a density of<br>
2.5xl06 cells/mL with a multiplicity of infection of two for each virus used.<br>
Infected cells were harvested 3 days post-infection and washed twice in insect<br>
PBS (PBS pH 6.3). Cells were then resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES<br>
pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 3mM MgCl2, ImM p-mercaptoethanol (BME), 5µg/mL<br>
leupeptin, 5µg/mL pepstatin A, 1 ug/mL aprotinin, and O.lmM PMSF) and snap<br>
frozen for storage at - 80°C. Cells were thawed on ice, brought to 30 mL total<br>
volume in lysis buffer, and burst by N2 cavitation (600 psi for 20 minutes). A<br>
low-speed centrifugation was performed to remove any unlysed cells (1000 x g<br>
for 10 minutes), followed by a high-speed centrifugation (17,000 x g for 30<br>
minutes). The pellet from the final centrifugation was homogenized in buffer<br>
containing 20 mM HEPES pH 8, 100mM NaCl, 1% glycerol, 2 µg/mL<br>
leupeptin, 2 µg/mL pepstatin A, 2 ug/mL Aprotinin, 0.1 mM PMSF, and 10 pM<br>
GDP using a small glass homogenizer followed by passage through a 26 gauge<br>
needle. Membranes were aliquoted, snap frozen in liquid N2, and stored at<br>
-80°C. Membranes from cells stably expressing the human Ai AR (CHO Kl<br>
cells) or A3 AR (HEK 293 cells) were prepared as described (Robeva et al.,<br>
1996).<br>
Example 53:Radioligand Binding Assays.<br>
Radioligand binding to recombinant human A2A receptors in Sf9 cell<br>
membranes was performed using either the radiolabeled agonist, I-APE<br>
(Luthin et al, 1995) or the radiolabeled antagonist, 125I-ZM241385 (125I-ZM).<br>
To detect the high affinity, GTPyS-sensitive state of A1 and A3 AR, we used the<br>
agonist, I25I-ABA (Linden et al, 1985;Lindenef al., 1993). Binding<br>
experiments were performed in triplicate with 5 pg (A2A) or 25 pg (A1 and A3)<br>
membrane protein in a total volume of 0. lmL HE buffer (20 mM HEPES and 1<br>
mM EDTA) with1 U/mL adenosine deaminase and 5 mM MgCl2 with or without<br>
50 µM GTPS. Membranes were incubated with radioligands at room<br>
temperature for three hours (for agonists) or two hours (for antagonists) in<br><br>
Millipore Multiscreen® 96-well GF/C filter plates and assays were terminated by<br>
rapid filtration on a cell harvester (Brandel, Gaithersburg, MD) followed by 4 x<br>
150 µl washes over 30 seconds with ice cold 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM<br>
MgCl2. Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 50 µM NEC A.<br>
Competition binding assays were performed as described (Robeva et ai, 1996)<br>
using 0.5-1 nM 125I-APE, 125I-ZM241385, or l25I-ABA. We found that it was<br>
sometimes important to change pipette tips following each serial dilution to<br>
prevent transfer on tips of potent hydrophobic compounds. The Ki-values for<br>
competing compound binding to a single site were derived from IC50 values with<br>
correction for radioligand and competing compound depletion as described<br>
previously (Linden, 1982).<br>

Chemiluminescence Methods: Luminol enhanced chemiluminescence,<br>
a measure of neutrophil oxidative activity, is dependent upon both superoxide<br>
production and mobilization of the granule enzyme myeloperoxidase. The light<br><br>
is emitted from unstable high-energy oxygen species such as hypochlorous acid<br>
and singlet oxygen generated by activated neutrophils.<br>
Purified human neutrophils (2 X 106/ml) suspended in Hanks balanced<br>
salt solution containing 0.1% human serum albumin (HA), adenosine deaminase<br>
(1U/mL) and rolipram (100 nM) were incubated (37C) in a water bath for 15<br>
min with or without rhTNF(10U/ml). Following incubation 100 L aliquots of the<br>
PMN were transferred to wells (White walled clear bottom 96 well tissue<br>
culture plates Costar #3670; 2 wells /condition) containing 501 HA and luminol<br>
(final concentration 100M) with or without adenosine agonist (final agonist<br>
concentrations 0.01-1000nM). The plate was incubated 5 min (37C) and then<br>
fMLP (50 1 in HA; final concentration 1M) was added to all wells.<br>
Peak chemiluminescence was determined with a Victor 1420<br>
Multilabel Counter in the chemiluminescence mode using the Wallac<br>
Workstation software. Data are presented as peak chemiluminescence as percent<br>
of activity in the absence of an adenosine agonist. The EC50 was determined<br>
using PRISM software. All compounds were tested with PMNs from three<br>
separate donors. The results are summarized in Table 8.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Example 54: Effect of A2A Agonists on Neutrophil Oxidative Activity<br>
A.	Materials.<br>
f-met-leu-phe (fMLP), luminol, superoxide dismutase, cytochrome C,<br>
fibrinogen, adenosine deaminase, and trypan blue were obtained from Sigma<br>
Chemical. Ficoll-hypaque was purchased from ICN (Aurora, OH), and Cardinal<br>
Scientific (Santa Fe, NM) and Accurate Chemicals and Scientific (Westerbury,<br>
NY), endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide; E. coli K235) was from List Biologicals<br>
(Campbell, CA). Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS), and limulus amebocyte<br>
lysate assay kit were from BioWittaker (Walkersville, MD). Human serum<br>
albumin (HS A) was from Cutter Biological (Elkhart, IN). Recombinant human<br>
tumor necrosis factor-alpha was supplied by Dianippon Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.<br>
(Osaka, Japan). ZM241385 (4-(2-[7-ammo-2-(2-furyl)[ 1,2,4]-<br>
triazolo[2,3-a][1,3,5]triazin-5-yl amino]ethyl)phenol) was a gift from Simon<br>
Poucher, Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, Cheshire, UK. Stock solutions (1 mM and 10<br>
mM in DMSO) were made and stored at -20°C.<br>
B.	Human neutrophil preparation<br>
Purified neutrophils (-98% neutrophils and &gt;95% viable by trypan<br>
blue exclusion) containing 
endotoxin (limulus amebocyte lysate assay) were obtained from normal<br>
heparinized (10 U/ml) venous blood by a one step Ficoll-hypaque separation<br>
procedure (A. Ferrante et al., J. Immunol. Meth., 36, 109 (1980)).<br>
C.	Release of inflammatory reactive oxygen species from primed and stimulated<br>
human neutrophils Chemiluminescence<br>
Luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence, a measure of neutrophil<br>
oxidative activity, is dependent upon both superoxide production and<br>
mobilization of the lysosomal granule enzyme myeloperoxidase. The light is<br>
emitted from unstable high-energy oxygen species generated by activated<br>
neutrophils. Purified neutrophils (5-10 x 105/ml) were incubated in Hanks<br>
balanced salt solution containing 0.1% human serum albumin (1 ml) with the<br>
tested A2A agonist with or without rolipram and with or without tumor necrosis<br>
factor-alpha (1 U/ml) for 30 minutes at 37°C in a shaking water bath. Then<br>
luminol (1 x 10-4 M) enhanced f-met-leu-phe (1 mcM) stimulated<br>
chemiluminescence was read with a Chronolog® Photometer (C1-ono-log Corp.,<br><br>
Havertown, PA) at 37°C for 2-4 minutes. Chemilurninescence is reported as<br>
relative peak light emitted (= height of the curve) compared to samples with<br>
tumor necrosis factor-alpha and without agonist or rolipram.<br>
Example 55. In vivo rat blood pressure experiments.<br>
Sprague-Dawley rats (mean weights, 250-300 grams) were<br>
anthesthetized and jugular and carotid catheters are implanted ipsilaterally and<br>
the animals are allowed to recover 24-48 hours. Prior to each experiment a<br>
baseline blood pressure reading is established for 30 minutes with each drug<br>
injection being preceeded by a vehicle control. Drags are injected bolus I.V.<br>
through a jugular catheter in a 200 microliter volume of saline and the catheter is<br>
flushed with an additional 300 microliters of saline. To measure blood pressure,<br>
a central line from the carotid catheter is attached to the pressure transducer of a<br>
Digi-Med Blood Pressure Analyzer. Systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, mean<br>
pressure, and heart rate are all recorded in real time at 30-60 second intervals.<br>
Data is recorded until mean blood pressure has returned to baseline and<br>
remained constant for 20 minutes. The data is presented as a fraction of the<br>
mean blood pressure averaged over the 10 minutes immediately prior to drug<br>
injection. The blood pressures are recorded and plotted over time as a means of<br>
determining potency of the compounds as well as biological half-life.<br>
The results are illustrated in Figures 1-6.<br>
EXAMPLE 56. In vivo Coronary Dog Flow Experiments<br>
Fasted, adult mongrel dogs (mean weight, 24.8+0.6 kg; range, 20.9 to<br>
28.2 kg) were anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (30 mg-kg"1), tracheally<br>
intubated, and mechanically ventilated with room air on a respirator (model 613,<br>
Harvard Apparatus) with positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cm H2O. The<br>
surgical preparation and instrumentation of the animals has been thoroughly<br>
described previously (Glover D.K. et al., Circulation 1996,94, pages<br>
1726-1732). Throughout each experiment, heart rate, mean arterial and left<br>
atrial pressures, ulrrasonically measured LCx flow, and dP/dt were continuously<br>
monitored and recorded on a 16-channel thermal array chart recorder (K2-G,<br>
Astro-med, Iac) and digitised and stored on an IBM-compatible personal<br>
computer. All experiments were performed with the approval of the University<br>
of Virginia Animal Care and Use Committee and were in compliance with the<br><br>
position of the American Heart Association on the use of research animals. The<br>
compounds tested were intravenously administered by bolus injection and the<br>
parameters above were measured and recorded.<br>
The results are illustrated in Figures 7-16.<br>
Example 57: Liver I/R injury protocol.<br>
Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine 100<br>
mg/kg and xylazine 10 mg/kg. Glycopyrrolate (Robinul-V) 0.05 mg/kg was<br>
delivered subcutaneously before the operation. The ambient temperature was<br>
controlled in the range of 24°C to 26°C. Mice were placed on a 37°C heat pad<br>
with their core temperature monitored by a TH-S Thermalert Monitoring<br>
Thermometer (Physitemp) and maintained at 36-37°C by a TCAT-1A<br>
Temperature Control and Alarm Unit (Physitemp) during the entire procedure.<br>
After midline laparotomy, a microaneurysm clip was applied to the hepatic triad<br>
above the bifurcation to clamp the flow of the hepatic artery, portal vein, and<br>
bile duct. The peritoneum was closed after superfusion of 200 u.1 of warm saline.<br>
After 60 minutes of ischemia, the peritoneum was reopened and the<br>
microaneurysm clip was removed. Immediately after reperfusion was initiated,<br>
each mouse received a loading dose of ATL-146e (1 ug/kg) or vehicle in 200 uL<br>
warm saline, and a primed Alzet osmotic minipump was placed<br>
intraperitoneally. The surgical wound was closed with metal staples. Mice were<br>
maintained on the heat pad to monitor and maintain body temperature until the<br>
anesthetic wore off.<br>
Drug Administration.<br>
Alzet osmotic minipumps (model 1003D; Alza Corp., Palo Alto, CA,<br>
USA) were primed according to the manufacture's instruction in order to release<br>
compounds shortly after implantation. A solution containing ATL146e was<br>
prepared in normal saline and placed in osmotic minipumps to deliver 10<br>
ng/kg/min. Minipumps containing vehicle or ATL146e were implanted during<br>
operation.<br>
Example 58: Serum enzyme determination<br>
Serum GPT (ALT) levels were measured using a Transaminase kit<br>
(505, Sigma). Briefly, 20 uL serum sample was mixed with 100 (L pre-heated<br><br>
Alanine-a-KG substrate and incubated in a 37 °C water bath for 30 minutes.<br>
Then we added 100 (L Sigma Color Reagent to the reaction and left it at room<br>
temperature for 20 minutes. We stopped the reaction with 1.0 ml 0.4N sodium<br>
hydroxide solution. Absorbance of each sample at 505 nm was measured and<br>
converted into SF unit/ml.<br>
Example 59: Tissue myeloperoxidase measurement<br>
Mouse livers were removed after 24 hours reperfusion. The tissue was<br>
immediately submerged in 10 volumes of ice-cold 50 mM KP04 buffer, pH 7.4<br>
and homogenized with a Tekmar tissue grinder. The homogenate was<br>
centrifuged at 15,000 x g for 15 minutes at 4oC, and the supernatant was<br>
discarded. The pellet was washed twice, resuspended in 10 volumes of ice-cold<br>
50 mM KP04 buffer pH 7.4 with 0.5% hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide<br>
and then sonicated. The suspension was subjected to three freeze/thaw cycles.<br>
Samples were sonicated for 10 seconds, and centrifuged at 15,000 x g for 15<br>
minutes at 4oC. The supernatant was added to an equal volume of a solution<br>
consisting of o-dianisidine (10mg/ml), 0.3% H202, and 50 mM KP04, pH 6.0.<br>
Absorbance was measured at 460 nm over a period of five minutes.<br>
Figure 17 illustrates the longer duration of action of JR3223 vs. a<br>
control compound and ATL146e for liver tissue protection after an<br>
ischemia/reperfusion injury. The test compounds were administered 6 hours<br>
prior to I/R injury. Tissue protection is measured by amount of Serum GPT<br>
present in the in a serum sample 24 hours later, with smaller GPT concentrations<br>
indicating better liver function.<br>
