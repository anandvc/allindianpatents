				<td>WIRE/WIRELESS KEYBOARD WITH POINTING DEVICE ATTACHABLE THERETO AND COMPUTER SYSTEM FOR USE WITH THE SAME<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a data input system with a pointing device attachable thereto and for use in a computer system, and more particularly, to a wire/wireless keyboard which allows wire and wireless communication with a computer system and reduces battery power consumption of during the wireless communication, and a computer system for use with the same.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Fig. l isa perspective view of a prior art computer system having a wire keyboard and a pointing device which are connected to the computer. In this figure, the computer system is based on a computer 20 and includes a set of user interface devices to allow the user to provide data to and receive information from the computer system. In particular, the computer system includes a monitor 15, which is the primary output interface component from the computer 20 to the user. For user-to-computer interfacing, a wire keyboard 30 is connected through a DIN (Deutch Industrie Norm) connector cable 50 to the computer 20 to allow the user to enter data and direct the execution of the software. When keys on the keyboard 15 are struck, the keyboard 15 generates a set of signals that indicate which keys have been depressed. As the user enters data into the computer 20, the data is displayed on the monitor 10. The computer system includes a mouse 40 as a pointing device for data manipulation. The mouse 40 is used to designate data for manipulation, although any type of electronic pointing device used for designating data in computer systems may be used. Although not shown, the computer system also includes a printer, a plotter, etc.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, however, since a length of the DIN connector cable 50 has been standardized and thereby limited within a definite range, the wire keyboard 30 cannot be moved over the definite range. If the DIN connector cable 50 having a length of more than the definite range is used between the wire keyboard 30 and the computer<br><br>
20, a noise may be introduced through the cable 50 and thereby data entering from the keyboard to the computer may be instable.<br>
So as to eliminate the above-mentioned problem, a wireless keyboard has been proposed. Fig. 2 is a perspective view of another prior art computer system having a wireless keyboard and a pointing device which are connected to the computer. In this figure, the computer system includes a wireless keyboard 30a which allows a user to enter data and direct the execution of the software as in the wire keyboard 30 of Fig. 1. The wireless keyboard 30a converts a key code, which is generated when a key is struck, into a wireless signal, and transmits the converted wireless signal through a wireless signal receiver 70 to the computer 20. Since the wireless keyboard 30a operate with a battery voltage from a battery located therein, there arises a problem in that a battery should be inevitably frequently changed.<br>
Also, the wireless keyboard 30a includes key pads which are used to perform specific key functions such as a number lock, a caps lock, a scroll lock function and the like. The keyboards 30a further includes a key function indicator 35 having several indicating elements, for example, LEDs. When one of the specific function key pads is struck, the keyboard 30a generates a corresponding key function signal and at the same time a corresponding LED of the key function indicator 35 is enabled to be turned on. The LED elements are relatively high in power consumption as compared with the other elements of the keyboard 30a. Thus, when the keyboard 30a operates with wireless communication and by a battery voltage, the battery voltage is rapidly lowered due to, particularly, the key function indicator 35 having relatively high power-consumption LED elements.<br>
As shown Figs. 1 and 2, the mouse 40 is directly connected to the computer 20. In this case, if a user enters data into the computer 20 using the wireless keyboard 30a as shown in Fig. 2, it is very inconvenient for the user to use both of the mouse 40 and the wireless keyboard 30a.<br>

Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiments<br>
Referring to Figs. 3 and 6, a novel wire/wireless keyboard 200 according to the present invention has a connector with which a pointing device, for example, a mouse 250 is removably connected directly, so that output information of the pointing device 250 can be provided through the keyboard 200 to a computer 100 in wire or wireless form. The keyboard 200 also provides a key input information, for example, commands and data to the computer 100 in wire/wireless form. Hereinafter, wire and wireless communication mean that signal transmission between the keyboard 200 and the computer 100 is performed in wire and wireless form, respectively. The pointing device 250 may be a touch pad, a joy stick, a track ball, etc. in addition to the mouse. For simplicity, a mouse is hereinafter described as an example of the present invention to which a pointing device is adapted.<br>
Referring again to Fig. 3, the wire/wireless keyboard 200 is connected through a cable 252 with the mouse 250, and an upper panel thereof has a set of keys, a key function indicator 270 and a driver 260 for transmitting information in wireless form, for example, a light signal, a RF (radio frequency) signal, or an infrared signal. The key function indicator 270 is provided to indicate which specific function keys such as a number lock, a caps lock key, and a scroll key are depressed.<br>
As shown in Fig. 6, the keyboard 200 is also connected through a cable 280 to the computer 100. An additional key function indicator 120 is mounted on a front vessel 110 of the computer 100 so as to indicate which one of the specific function keys is depressed, as in the key function indicator 270 provided on the keyboard 200. The indicator 120 has three LEDs (light emitting displays) as in the indicator 270. In this embodiment, the indicator 120 is located on the front vessel 110 of the computer 100, but it may be located<br><br>
on a front panel of a monitor 10. Also, two key function indicators may be located on both of the computer 100 and the monitor 10.<br>
When the wire/wireless keyboard 200 operates with wireless communication, or when it communicates with the computer 100 in wireless form, the key function indicator 270 on the keyboard 200 is turned off and the key function indicator 120 on the computer 100 is turned on. Thus, during the wireless communication, it is possible to reduce power consumption of a battery (not shown in Figs. 3 and 6) mounted in the keyboard 200. The battery may be a rechargeable battery.<br>
Turning to Fig. 3, a reference numeral 190 is an infrared window which receives an information generated from the driver 260 and transmits it in an infrared signal to the computer 100. When the keyboard 200 operates with wireless communication, a corresponding LED of the key function indicator 120 on the computer 100 is turned on so as to indicate which a specific function key is depressed. For example, the number lock function is indicated by a first LED element LSI, the caps lock function by a second LED element LS2, and the scroll lock function by a third LED element LS3.<br>
Also, the mouse 250 can be connected to the keyboard 200 so as to remotely enter a pointing information, and thereby the pointing information can be transmitted through the keyboard 200 to the computer 100. Herein, the "pointing information" terminology means a sort of pointer data for designating data for manipulation by means of the mouse 250.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a circuit of the computer 100 when the wire/wireless keyboard 200 operates with wireless communication therebetween. As shown in Fig. 4, a CPU (central processing unit) 150 is connected to a host bus so as to perform a data processing function. System controller 520 is provided to control data transmission between the host bus and PCI bus and to control access to a memory 530. Video interface 550 is connected with the PCI bus so as to display video data on the monitor. Keyboard controller 570 and I/O controller 560 are connected with ISA bus so as to control data transmission between the computer 100 and its peripheral devices. The I/O controller 560 is provided to control data transmission between the CPU 510 and the peripheral devices, for example, a floppy disk driver, a hard disk driver, a CD-ROM driver etc. The keyboard controller 570 is provided to control data transmission between the CPU 510 and the data input devices, for example, the mouse MSI and the wire keyboard KB which are respectively connected<br>
through cables to the connectors CN1 and CN2 of the computer 100.<br>
Also, wireless signal processor 580 is connected to the keyboard controller 570 so as to control data transmission between the CPU 510 and a remote data input device, for example, a remote controller device RC, the wire/wireless keyboard 200, or the mouse 250 connected direct to the keyboard 200. Wireless signals from the remote data input device are processed by the wireless signal processor 580 to enter the processed data into the computer 100. Pointing data from the mouse 250 is transmitted through the wire/wireless keyboard 200 to the computer 100.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a circuit of the computer 100 when the wire/wireless keyboard 200 operates with wire communication therebetween. In this figure, it is illustrated that a wire signal from the keyboard 200 or the mouse 250 is transmitted through the cable 280 to the computer 100. The computer circuit of Fig. 5 has the same as that of Fig. 4 and thus description thereof is omitted below.<br>
Fig. 6 shows that the keyboard 200 is connected through the cable 280 to the computer 100 so as to perform wire communication. The cable 280 has two ends, one of which is connected to a single plug PL3 to be connected to the wire/wireless keyboard 200, and the other of which is divided and connected to two plugs PL1 and PL2. These plugs PL1 and PL2 are connected to a keyboard input port CN1 and a mouse input port CN2 of the computer 100, respectively. Through the cable 280, a key input information from the wire/wireless keyboard 200 or a pointing information the mouse 250 is applied to the computer 100. An expanded view of the cable 280 is shown in Fig. 7 A.<br>
Figs. 7B and 1C show the plugs PL1 (PL2) and PL3. Each of the plugs PL1 and PL2 is comprised of a DIN plug having six pins CP1 through CP6 as shown in Fig. 7B. CP1 is a data transmission pin, CP2 and CP6 are non-connection pins, CP3 is a ground pin, CP4 is a Vcc supply pin, and CP5 is a clock transmission pin. The plug PL3 has eight pins PI through P8 as shown in Fig. 1C. The pins PI through P4 are provided for the wire/wireless keyboard 200 and the pins P5 through P8 for the mouse 250. PI and P5 are data transmission pins, P2 and P6 are clock transmission pins, P3 and P7 are ground pins, and P4 and P8 are Vcc supply pins.<br>
Fig. 8 is a block diagram showing a circuit diagrams showing the combination of the wire/wireless keyboard and the computer system associated therewith. In this figure, the wire/wireless keyboard 200 has six main components, a key matrix 230, a<br>
wire/wireless keyboard controller 220, a wireless transceiver 210, a pointer interface 240 and a key function indicator 260. The keyboard controller 220 is substantially constituted by a microcomputer which is connected with a DIN jack 202 so as to communicate with the computer 100 through the cable 280. This DIN jack 202 is coupled with the DIN plug PL3 (refer to Fig. 5).<br>
Referring again to Fig. 8, the key matrix 230 has a set of keys for entering data and command. The keyboard controller 220 provides a scanning signal to the key matrix 230 and senses a signal corresponding to the key input. The sensed signal is provided to the wireless transceiver 210 and the DIN jack 202. Then the wireless transceiver 210 converts the signal into a wireless signal, i.e., an infrared signal and transmits the wireless signal to the computer 100. If the keyboard 200 is coupled via the cable 280 with the computer 100, it operates with a power source voltage applied from the computer 100, and If not, or when the keyboard 200 operates with wireless communication, it operates with a battery voltage from a battery 204 which is located therein.<br>
As mentioned above, when the power source voltage generated by a power supply (not shown) of the computer 100 is applied through the power supply pins Vcc and GND of the cable 280 to the keyboard 200, this keyboard can use the power source voltage from the computer 100. This can be achieved by detecting whether the keyboard 200 is coupled through the plugs PL1 to PL3 to the computer 100. In detail, the wire/wireless keyboard controller 220 detects whether the DIN plug PL3 of the cable 280 connected to the computer 100 is inserted into the DIN jack 202. If the DIN plug PL3 is inserted into the DIN jack 202, the keyboard controller 220 allows the keyboard 200 to operate using the power source voltage applied through the power pins of the plug PL3 but not using a battery voltage. This detection is substantially accomplished by the keyboard controller 220 which operates with the battery voltage from the battery 204, and after this time the keyboard controller 220 can operates with the power source voltage from the computer 100. Even though the DIN plug PL3 is inserted into the DIN jack 202, the keyboard controller 220 continues to operate with the battery voltage.<br>
Also, the keyboard controller 220 controls operations of the keyboard 200 in response to a control signal provided from the computer 100 through the wireless signal processor 580. The keyboard 200 senses a pointing signal generated from the mouse 250 through the pointer interface 240. The pointing signal sensed thus is converted into a<br>
wireless signal by means of the wireless transceiver 210 and provided to the computer 100.<br>
The wireless signal processor 580 of the computer 100 receives the wireless signal from the keyboard. The signal received through the wireless transceiver is transformed into a preset format data and provided to the keyboard controller 570 (refer to Figs. 4 and 5) of the computer 100. Then it is determined in the signal processor 582 whether the received signal is a key input data from the keyboard 200, a pointing data from the mouse 250, or a data from the remote controller RC. If the received signal is the key input data, the signal processor 582 determines whether the key input data is a signal corresponding to a specific key function. If so, the signal processor 582 generates a control signal to the key function indicator 120 so that the LEDs of the indicator 120 are turned on in response to the control signal.<br>
The circuit of Fig. 9 has the same construction as that of Fig. 8 except that a rechargeable battery is used as a battery located in the keyboard 200 and a battery charger (or battery charging circuit) is further included in the circuit of Fig. 8, and description of identical components is omitted.<br>
As shown in Fig. 9, when the keyboard 200 operates with a power source voltage Vin from the computer 100 by connecting the keyboard to the computer 100 through the cable 280, the rechargeable battery 204a is charged by means of a battery charger 206 receiving the voltage Vin. If the keyboard 200 does not operate with the power source voltage Vin from the computer 100, it operates with the battery voltage from the rechargeable battery 204a. If the power source voltage Vin from the computer 100 is supplied, however, the keyboard 200 operates with the voltage Vin and at the same time the battery 204a is charged.<br>
The circuit of Fig. 10 has the same construction as that of Fig. 8 except that a wire/wireless keyboard controller 220a incorporates an interfacing function capable of processing a pointing data provided directly from the mouse 250, and description of identical components is omitted. In the circuit of Fig. 10, an additional pointer interface is not located for the mouse 250.<br>
On the other hand, even though an additional key function indicator is located on a front panel of the monitor, the indicator can be turned on/off in response to the control signal which is generated from the signal processor 582 of Figs. 7 to 10 and supplied<br>
from the computer 100 to the monitor. Accordingly, even a monitor can display a specific key function.<br>
In Figs. 8 to 10, it is shown that the mouse is connected directly to the wire/wireless keyboard controller or the pointer interface, but the direct connection therebetween is accomplished through the plug and jack serving as PS2 connector, as in Figs. 7A and 7B.<br>
Figs. 11A and 1 IB show that the controller 220 or 220a of the keyboard detects whether a power source voltage is supplied from either a battery or the computer. It is shown from, particularly, Fig. 1 IB that the battery 204a may be charged by the battery charger 206. In Figs. 11A and 1 IB, a power source voltage Vin supplied from the computer 100 is applied to through a diode Dl to a power terminal VP of the keyboard controller 220 or 220a, and directly to the a power detection terminal DP thereof. A battery voltage from the battery 204 is supplied through a diode D2 to the power terminal VP. Particularly, in Fig. 1 IB, the power source voltage Vin is also supplied through the battery charger 206 to the battery 204a. Thus, the keyboard controller 220 or 220a may detect whether the voltage Vin is supplied through the power detection terminal DP.<br>
Hereinafter, operations of the wire/wireless keyboard and the computer associated therewith according to the present invention will be described with reference to Figs. 11 and 12. Flow chart shown in Fig. 12 is a control program to be performed in the keyboard controller 220 or 220a of the keyboard 200.<br>
At step S10, the keyboard controller 220 or 220a determines that the keyboard 200 operates with wire or wireless communication by detecting whether a power source voltage Vin from the computer 10 is applied to the power detection terminal DP of the keyboard controller or not. If the keyboard 200 operates with the wire communication, the control proceeds to step SI 4, and if it operates with the wireless communication, the control proceeds to step SI2. At step SI4, the key function indicator 260 on the keyboard 200 is enabled to be turned on so that a specific key function can be displayed when a specific function key is depressed, and the control proceeds to step S24 wherein it is determined whether a key input data from the keyboard 200 or a pointing data (or pointer data) from the mouse 250 is inputted. At step S24, if a data is inputted, the control proceeds to step S26 wherein a corresponding data (i.e., a key code or a pointing information) is generated. After generation of the corresponding data, the control<br>
proceeds to step S28 wherein the data is delivered through the cable 280 to the keyboard controller 570 of the computer 100.<br>
On the other hand, at step SI 2, the key function indicator 260 of the keyboard 200 is disabled. Then, even though a specific function key is depressed, a specific key function is not displayed by the indicator 260. This is because the indicator 260 is turned off. The control proceeds to step SI6 wherein it is determined whether a key input data from the keyboard 200 or a pointing data from the mouse 250 is inputted. At step SI6, if a data is inputted, the control proceeds to step SI8 wherein a corresponding data (i.e., a key code or a pointing information) is generated. After generation of the corresponding data, the control proceeds to step S20 wherein the data is delivered to the wireless transceiver 210. Then the transceiver 210 converts the data delivered thus into a wireless signal, for example, a radio frequency signal, an infrared signal or an optical signal. The control proceeds to step S22 wherein the wireless signal converted thus is transmitted to the computer 100.<br>
The transmitted wireless signal is received and processed by the wireless signal processor 580 of the computer 100. The received wireless signal is converted into an electrical signal by means of the wireless transceiver 584 of the processor 580, and then delivered to the signal processor 582 to be processed in accordance with the control program shown in Fig. 13.<br>
At step SI20, the signal processor 582 determines whether there is a received data or not. If there is a received data, the control proceeds to step S200 wherein it is checked whether a wire keyboard is used. At step S200, if the wire keyboard is not used, the control proceeds to step SI30 wherein it is checked whether a channel (i.e., a frequency) of the transmitted signal is identical to a channel (i.e., a frequency) of the received signal. If so, the control proceeds to step SI40 wherein it is determined whether the transmitted signal is provided from the remote controller RC. At step SI40, if so, the control proceeds to step S150 wherein a scan code for the remote controller RC is generated. At step SI 40, if not, the control proceeds to step SI 60 wherein it is determined whether the transmitted signal is provided from the keyboard 200. At step SI 60, if so, the control proceeds to step S170 wherein a scan code for the keyboard 200 is generated. At step SI 60, if not, the control proceeds to step SI 80 wherein it is determined whether the transmitted signal is provided form the mouse 250. At step SI 80, if so, the control<br>
proceeds to step SI90 wherein a mouse sensing data is generated.<br>
At steps SI50, SI70 and SI90, after generating the scan codes and the mouse sensing data, the control proceeds to step S210 wherein it is determined whether a specific function key is depressed. If so, the control proceeds to step S220 wherein a control signal is delivered to the key function indicator. The control signal is used to enable the key function indicator 120 of the computer 100 to display a corresponding specific key function. If not, the control proceeds to step S230 wherein the scan code or data generated thus is delivered to the keyboard controller 570 of the computer.<br>
As described immediately above, when the wire/wireless keyboard 200 operates with wire communication, it operates with the power source voltage from the computer 100 and the key function indicator of the keyboard is enabled to display a specific key function. And when the keyboard 200 operates with wireless communication, it operates with the battery voltage from the battery located therein and the key function indicator of the computer or the monitor is enabled to display a specific key function. Accordingly, when the keyboard 200 operates with wireless communication, since the key function indicator thereof is disabled and the key function indicator of the computer or the monitor is enabled, a power consumption of the battery can be reduced considerably.<br>
Also, since the keyboard 200 can connect directly with a pointing device such as mouses, etc., a pointing data can be delivered to the computer 100 in wire or wireless signal.<br>
Fig. 14 shows an inside structure of the computer 100 having the key function indicator 120 controlled by the keyboard. In this figure, the key function indicator 120 may indicate a number lock function, a caps lock function and a scroll lock function.<br>
As shown in Fig. 14, the key function indicator 120 is located on a front vessel 110 of the computer 100. LED board 150 constituting an electrical circuit of the key function indicator 120 is electrically connected with a computer main board 170 inside the computer 100. The LED board 150 receives a control signal from the wireless signal processor 580 mounted on the main board 170. The control signal is used to allow the keyboard 200 to display a specific key function. The LED board 150 is provided with a connector Cl for connecting with a connector C2 of the main board 170. The LED board 150 and the main board 170 are connected with each other by a cable 155 having sockets 155A and 155B at both ends thereof. The LED board 150 receives the control signal<br>
from the wireless signal processor 580 on the main board 170.<br>
So as to emit lights generated from LEDs LED1 to LED3 of the LED board 150 outside of the computer, the LED board 150 has a lens portion 140 having three LED receiving members LS1 to LS3 for receiving the LEDs respectively. The LED receiving members LSI to LS3 are not interferenced by the lights generated from the LEDs.<br>
As shown in Fig. 15, the LED receiving members LSI to LS3 are projected outward through holes 130 on the front vessel 110 and mounted to the computer by a supporting case 160 which supports the LED board 150 and the lens portion 140.<br>
Fig. 16 is a detailed circuit diagram of the key function indicator 120. In this figure, the indicator 120 has three LEDs corresponding to the number, caps and scroll lock functions. A power source voltage Vcc is commonly applied to anodes of the LEDs LED1 to LED3. Cathodes of the LEDs are connected through resistors Rl to R3 to terminals T2, T3 and T4 of the connector Cl. When the control signal of low level from the signal processor 582 of the computer 100 is applied to the terminal T2, T3 or T4 of the connector Cl, a LED is turned on. So, when a specific function key of the keyboard is depressed, a corresponding specific key function is indicated by the turned-on LED. The terminals T1-T4 of the connector Cl are connected to the wireless signal processor 580.<br>
The structure of Fig. 15 has the same as that of Fig. 14 except that a speaker phone 180 and a number of holes 130 therefor are provided on the front vessel 110, and description thereof is omitted herein.<br>
As described above, a keyboard according to the present invention operates with a power source voltage from a computer during wire communication and allows a key function indicator on the keyboard to be enabled and a key function indicator. Also, the keyboard operates with a battery voltage from a battery located therein during wireless communication and allows the key function indicator on the keyboard to be-disabled and an additional key function indicator on the computer and/or a monitor to be enabled. Thus, when a specific function key is depressed during the wireless communication, the key function indicator on the computer is turned on to display a corresponding specific key function. During the wireless communication of the keyboard with the computer, since the keyboard operates with the battery voltage, but the key function indicator on the keyboard does not operate, power consumption of the batter can be reduced considerably.<br>
In addition, since the keyboard can connect directly with a pointing device such as mouses, etc., a pointing data from the pointing device can be delivered to the computer in wire or wireless signal. Accordingly, whenever the keyboard operates with the wireless communication, it is very convenient for a user to use the pointing device as well as the keyboard.<br><br><br><br><br>
