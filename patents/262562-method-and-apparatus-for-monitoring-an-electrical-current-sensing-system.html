				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MONITORING AN ELECTRICAL<br>
CURRENT SENSING SYSTEM<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] This disclosure is related to electrical current sensing systems.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0001] Electric and hybrid powertrain architectures utilize electric machines<br>
to generate motive torque transmitted to a vehicle driveline. The electrical<br>
machines are operatively connected to an electrical energy storage device for<br>
interchanging electrical power therebetween. The electrical machines are<br>
further operable to transform vehicle kinetic energy, transmitted through the<br>
vehicle driveline, to electrical energy potential that is storable in the electrical<br>
energy storage device. A control system monitors various inputs from the<br>
vehicle and the operator and provides operational control of the powertrain<br>
system including controlling the torque-generative devices and regulating the<br>
electrical power interchange between the electrical energy storage device and<br>
the electrical machines.<br>
[0002] Vehicles employing such powertrain architectures benefit from a<br>
robust method to determine a state-of-charge of the electrical energy storage<br>
device, in that operation and management of the powertrain system can be<br>
optimized based thereon. Determining a parametric value for state-of-charge<br>
requires an accurate determination of electrical current flow in and out of the<br><br>
electrical energy storage device. However, current flow can range from under<br>
1.0 ampere to as high as 300 amperes in an integrated electrical energy storage<br>
device operative to supply electrical power to electrical torque-generative<br>
machines and meet other electrical needs in the vehicle. Therefore, it is<br>
beneficial to have an electrical current monitoring device that is accurate over<br>
the range of operation.<br>
[0002] A fault occurring in the electrical current monitoring device leads<br>
to the system not operating as intended, resulting in customer dissatisfaction.<br>
Furthermore, state and federal regulations impose requirements to monitor<br>
operation of devices such as the electrical current monitoring device, including<br>
diagnosing presence of a fault and informing a vehicle operator of the<br>
presence of the fault, under regulated conditions. Monitoring conditions can<br>
include presence of open or short circuits, out-of-range/rationality checking,<br>
and proper functional response to inputs.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0003] A method and article of manufacture monitor electrical current in a<br>
transmission line between an electrical storage device and an electrical<br>
machine. The sensing system includes a first sensor operative to monitor a<br>
first range of electrical current and a second sensor operative to monitor a<br>
second range of electrical current. The method includes determining outputs<br>
of the first and second sensors are valid, and comparing outputs of the first and<br>
second sensors when current in the transmission line is substantially zero. The<br>
method also includes comparing magnitudes of the outputs of the first and<br><br>
second sensors when the monitored electrical current is within a monitoring<br>
range common to the first and the second sensors, and monitoring polarity of<br>
each of the outputs of the first and second sensors.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0004] One or more embodiments will now be described, by way of<br>
example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
[0005] Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram of an exemplary architecture for a<br>
control system for a powertrain, in accordance with the present disclosure;<br>
and,<br>
[0006] Fig. 2 is a logic flowchart, in accordance with the present<br>
disclosure.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0007] Referring now to the drawings, wherein the showings are for the<br>
purpose of illustrating certain exemplary embodiments only and not for the<br>
purpose of limiting the same, Fig. 1 depicts a schematic drawing of a system<br>
comprising an engine 14 connected via shaft 12 to electrically variable<br>
transmission 10, which is connected via shaft 64 to a driveline, and distributed<br>
control module system, which has been constructed in accordance with an<br>
embodiment of the present disclosure. The engine 14 preferably comprises a<br>
conventional internal combustion engine with engine control module ('ECM')<br>
23 operably connected. The ECM 23 functions to acquire data from a variety<br><br>
of sensors and control a variety of actuators, respectively, of the engine 14<br>
over a plurality of discrete lines collectively shown as aggregate line 35.<br>
[0008] The exemplary transmission preferably comprises a two-mode,<br>
compound-split, electro-mechanical hybrid transmission including a<br>
compound planetary gear arrangement and four torque-transmitting clutches<br>
controlled by an electro-hydraulic control system. The transmission control<br>
module ('TCM') 17 is operably connected to the transmission 10 and<br>
functions to acquire data from a variety of sensors and provide command<br>
signals to the electro-hydraulic control system of the transmission. The<br>
transmission incorporates a pair of electrical machines 56, 72 which comprise<br>
motor/generator devices, and are referred to as MG-A 56 and MG-B 72. The<br>
transmission 10 receives input motive torque from the torque-generative<br>
devices, including the engine 14 and the MG-A 56 and MG-B 72, as a result<br>
of energy conversion from fuel, or from electrical potential stored in an<br>
electrical energy storage device ('ESD') 74. The ESD 74 typically comprises<br>
one or more batteries capable of storing and transmitting high electrical power<br>
levels. Other electrical energy and electrochemical energy storage devices that<br>
have the ability to store electric power and dispense electric power may be<br>
used in place of the batteries without altering the concepts of the present<br>
disclosure. The ESD 74 is preferably sized based upon factors including<br>
regenerative requirements, application issues related to typical road grade and<br>
temperature, and propulsion requirements such as emissions, power assist and<br>
electric range. The ESD 74 is high voltage DC-coupled to transmission power<br>
inverter module ('TPIM') 19 via electrical transmission line 27.<br><br>
[0009] The TPIM 19 is operable to generate torque commands for MG-A<br>
56 and MG-B 72 based upon input from a hybrid control module ('HCP') 5,<br>
which is driven by operator input through User Interface ('UP) 13 and other<br>
system operating parameters. The motor torque commands for MG-A and<br>
MG-B are implemented by the control system, including the TPIM 19, to<br>
control MG-A and MG-B. The electrical energy storage device 74 is high-<br>
voltage DC-coupled to the TPIM 19 via electrical transmission line 27<br>
Electrical current is transferable to or from the TPIM 19 in accordance with<br>
whether the ESD 74 is being charged or discharged. The TPIM 19<br>
communicates with the first electrical machine 56 by transfer conductors 29,<br>
and the TPIM 19 similarly communicates with the second electrical machine<br>
MG-B 72 by transfer conductors 31.<br>
[0010] TPIM 19 includes the pair of power inverters and respective motor<br>
control modules configured to receive motor control commands and control<br>
inverter states therefrom for providing motor drive or regeneration<br>
functionality. In motoring control, the respective inverter receives DC<br>
electrical current from ESD 74 via the transfer line 27 and provides AC<br>
current to the respective electrical machine, i.e. MG-A and MG-B, over<br>
transfer conductors 29 and 31. In regeneration control, the respective inverter<br>
receives AC electrical current from the electrical machine over transfer<br>
conductors 29 and 31 and supplies DC electrical current to the ESD 74 via<br>
electrical transmission line 27. A current monitoring system 30 is mechanized<br>
to monitor current flow through transmission line 27. The net DC current<br>
provided to or from the inverters determines the charge or discharge operating<br><br>
mode of the electrical energy storage device 74. Preferably, MG-A 56 and<br>
MG-B 72 are three-phase AC machines and the inverters comprise<br>
complementary three-phase power electronics.<br>
[0011] Other elements of the control system depicted with reference to<br>
Fig. 1 comprise distributed control module architecture comprise a subset of<br>
an overall vehicle control architecture operable to provide coordinated system<br>
control of the vehicle powertrain system. The control system is operable to<br>
synthesize pertinent information and inputs, and execute algorithms to control<br>
various actuators to achieve control targets, including such parameters as fuel<br>
economy, emissions, performance, driveability, and protection of hardware,<br>
including batteries of ESD 74 and MG-A and MG-B 56, 72. The distributed<br>
control module architecture includes the engine control module ('ECM') 23,<br>
the transmission control module ('TCM') 17, battery pack control module<br>
('BPCM') 21, and the Transmission Power Inverter Module ('TPIM') 19. The<br>
hybrid control module ('HCP') 5 provides overarching control and<br>
coordination of the aforementioned control modules. The UI 13 operably<br>
connected to a plurality of devices through which a vehicle operator typically<br>
controls or directs operation of the powertrain through a request for torque,<br>
including the transmission 10. Exemplary vehicle operator inputs to the UI 13<br>
include an accelerator pedal, a brake pedal, transmission gear selector, and,<br>
vehicle speed cruise control. Each of the aforementioned control modules<br>
communicates with other control modules, sensors, and actuators via a local<br>
area network ('LAN') bus 6. The LAN bus 6 allows for structured<br>
communication of control parameters and commands between the various<br><br>
control modules. The specific communication protocol utilized is application-<br>
specific. The LAN bus and appropriate protocols provide for robust<br>
messaging and multi-control module interfacing between the aforementioned<br>
control modules, and other control modules providing functionality such as<br>
antilock brakes, traction control, and vehicle stability.<br>
[0012] The HCP 5 provides overarching control of the hybrid powertrain<br>
system, serving to coordinate operation of the ECM 23, TCM 17, TPIM 19,<br>
and BPCM 21. Based upon various input signals from the UI 13 and the<br>
powertrain, including the battery pack, the HCP 5 generates various<br>
commands, including: operator torque, engine torque, clutch torque for the<br>
clutches of the transmission 10; and motor torque commands for MG-A and<br>
MG-B. The BPCM 21 is signally connected one or more sensors operable to<br>
monitor electrical current or voltage parameters of the ESD 74 to provide<br>
information about the state of the batteries to the HCP 5.<br>
[0013] Each of the aforementioned control modules is preferably a<br>
general-purpose digital computer generally comprising a microprocessor or<br>
central processing unit, storage mediums comprising read only memory<br>
(ROM), random access memory (RAM), electrically programmable read only<br>
memory (EPROM), high speed clock, analog to digital (A/D) and digital to<br>
analog (D/A) circuitry, and input/output circuitry and devices (I/O) and<br>
appropriate signal conditioning and buffer circuitry. Each control module has<br>
a set of control algorithms, comprising resident program instructions and<br>
calibrations stored in ROM and executed to provide the respective functions of<br><br>
each computer. Information transfer between the various computers is<br>
preferably accomplished using the aforementioned LAN 6.<br>
[0014] Algorithms for control and state estimation in each of the control<br>
modules are typically executed during preset loop cycles such that each<br>
algorithm is executed at least once each loop cycle. Algorithms stored in the<br>
non-volatile memory devices are executed by one of the central processing<br>
units and are operable to monitor inputs from the sensing devices and execute<br>
control and diagnostic routines to control operation of the respective device,<br>
using preset calibrations. Loop cycles are typically executed at regular<br>
intervals, for example each 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 100 milliseconds during<br>
ongoing engine and vehicle operation. Alternatively, algorithms may be<br>
executed in response to occurrence of an event.<br>
[0015] The electrical transmission line 27 between the ESD 74 and TPIM<br>
27 is mechanized with the current monitoring system 30, comprising first and<br>
second current sensors. Each sensor is operative to monitor magnitude and<br>
direction of current flow to the ESD. Signal outputs from the current sensors<br>
of current monitoring system 30 are input to the TPIM, and are used to<br>
facilitate operations for monitoring the ESD 74, e.g. state-of-charge<br>
estimations. The first and second current sensors each preferably comprise<br>
known open-loop Hall-effect sensors operative to generate an electrical<br>
voltage output that is substantially proportional to the magnitude of current.<br>
The first sensor is preferably an open-loop Hall-effect sensor adapted to<br>
provide a linear output over a low current range of+/- 30 amperes with an<br>
accuracy of about 1%, or 0.3 amperes. The second sensor is preferably an<br><br>
open-loop Hall-effect sensor adapted to provide a linear output over a high<br>
current range of+/-300 amperes with an accuracy of about 1%, or 3.0<br>
amperes. In the control system mechanized with first and second current<br>
monitoring sensors, the control system preferably uses signal information from<br>
the first current sensor when the current level is between -30 amperes and<br>
approximately +30 amperes, and transitions to use signal information from the<br>
second current sensor when the current level is between approximately 30<br>
amperes and 300 amperes. Sources of error in reading from the sensors<br>
include magnetic hysteresis at zero amperes and temperature drift. It is<br>
understood that the specifically described Hall-effect sensors are meant to be<br>
exemplary and not limiting. The substance of the disclosure is applicable to<br>
various types of current sensors.<br>
[0016] Referring now to Fig. 2, a flowchart is provided comprising a<br>
description of actions executed in the control system to monitor operation of<br>
the electrical current sensing system 30. The actions described herein are<br>
preferably executed as one or more algorithms resident in one of the<br>
distributed control modules, using predetermined calibrations. The disclosure<br>
is with reference to the aforementioned powertrain and control system,<br>
although it is understood that the disclosure is applicable to numerous systems<br>
which have a need to monitor operation of an electrical current monitoring<br>
device.<br>
[0017] Initially, output signals from the first and second current sensors of<br>
the sensing system 30 are read, preferably through an I/O device of one of the<br>
control modules, e.g. the TPIM (Block 102). The output signals are analyzed<br><br>
to determine whether either output signal has been shorted to ground, or has an<br>
open electrical circuit due, e.g. to a break in an electrical wire (Block 104).<br>
This is preferably accomplished by the comparing the signal outputs to a<br>
system ground voltage and a system operating voltage. When it is determined<br>
that there is no open circuit or short circuit in the electrical system for the<br>
current sensors, the output signals are deemed valid (Block 106) and<br>
monitored during ongoing operation. Under a circumstance wherein it is<br>
determined that the output signals are not valid, e.g. presence of a short circuit<br>
or open circuit is found, then a fault is identified, a sensoroutputinvalid flag<br>
is set (Block 122), and monitoring of the current sensing system is<br>
discontinued (Block 124).<br>
[0018] Monitoring the output signals includes monitoring sensor output at<br>
zero current (Block 108). This can include measuring an initial value for zero<br>
current through the first and second sensors at initial key-on and startup of<br>
vehicle operation, prior to any command for electrical current. Furthermore, a<br>
zero-current output can be measured at other opportune times during operation<br>
when it is known that there is zero current flowing, such as when a circuit<br>
contactor is commanded opened. Each time a zero-current output is measured,<br>
the signals for zero-current output from the first and second sensors are<br>
compared (Block 110). When the output from one of the sensors is<br>
substantially different from the output from the other sensor, e.g. greater than<br>
a value of sensor error or measurement accuracy (1% of full-scale in this<br>
embodiment), a fault in sensor rationality is identified and captured (Block<br>
126), and monitoring is discontinued (Block 128).<br><br>
[0019] During ongoing operation of the vehicle, outputs from the first and<br>
second current sensors are regularly monitored and captured, in this<br>
embodiment at a sample rate of about 20 milliseconds (Block 112). When the<br>
magnitude of the current is within the linear monitoring ranges common to<br>
both the first sensor and the second sensor, i.e. between zero and thirty<br>
amperes in this embodiment, the magnitudes of the outputs of the first and<br>
second current sensors are compared (Block 114). A difference is determined<br>
between the outputs of the first and second sensors, and evaluated compared to<br>
measurement accuracies of the first and second sensors, which are<br>
predetermined and pre-calibrated in the control module. In this example, the<br>
measurement accuracy of the first sensor is 0.3 amperes and the measurement<br>
accuracy of the second sensor is 3.0 amperes. Therefore, a difference between<br>
of the outputs of the first and second current sensors that is less than 3.3<br>
amperes is deemed acceptable in the exemplary system described herein. A<br>
difference greater than 3.3 amperes is deemed unacceptable, leading to<br>
identification of a fault, and, discontinuing further monitoring.<br>
[0020] The polarities of the outputs from the first and second current<br>
sensors are determined and correlated (Block 116) Determining polarities of<br>
current outputs from the first and second current sensors preferably comprises<br>
monitoring current sensor output signals and voltage of the ESD 74 over an<br>
elapsed period of time. A direction of change in ESD voltage correlates to a<br>
knowable direction of change in sensed current. When the direction of change<br>
in sensed current from the first or second current sensor correlates to the<br>
change in ESD voltage, it can be determined that the current sensor has passed<br><br>
the polarity check (Block 118). When the direction of change in sensed<br>
current from the first or second current sensor does not correlate to the direct<br>
of change in ESD voltage, it can be determined that the current sensor has not<br>
passed the polarity check (Block 116), and there is a fault in the system. The<br>
fault in sensor rationality is identified and captured (Block 126), and<br>
monitoring is discontinued (Block 128).<br>
[0021] When a fault is identified in the system, the control system is<br>
operable to act, such action including illuminating a malfunction indicator<br>
lamp in a vehicle instrument panel, disabling other related diagnostic<br>
algorithms, and implementing appropriate corrective actions in the control<br>
system, including such actions as necessary to prevent harm to other<br>
components.<br>
[0022] The disclosure has described certain preferred embodiments and<br>
modifications thereto. Further modifications and alterations may occur to<br>
others upon reading and understanding the specification. Therefore, it is<br>
intended that the disclosure not be limited to the particular embodiment(s)<br>
disclosed as the best mode contemplated for carrying out this disclosure, but<br>
that the disclosure will include all embodiments falling within the scope of the<br>
appended claims.<br><br>
