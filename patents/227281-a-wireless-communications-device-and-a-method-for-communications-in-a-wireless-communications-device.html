				<td>A WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS DEVICE AND A METHOD FOR COMMUNICATIONS<br><br>
IN A WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS DEVICE.<br><br>
Field Of The Invention<br>
The present invention generally relates to a system and a method for receiving and<br>
transmitting information using wireless networks and, more specifically, to an antenna system<br>
and a method for receiving and transmitting information in a wireless multipara environment<br>
Background Of The Invention<br>
A signal that is received or transmitted by a conventional wireless communication device<br>
in a wireless communications network is influenced by the surrounding environment. In theory,<br>
a conventional wireless communications device that has a single antenna 200 would have a<br>
radiation pattern as shown in a polar plot illustrated in FIG. 3. The single antenna 200 has an<br>
isotropic radiation pattern 210 illustrated with an isotropic gain line 220 or; for example, 0 dBi.<br>
Although radiation patterns are three dimensional, it is understood that the polar plots are merely<br>
two-dimensional representations. Thus, a polar plot may represent, for example, a cross section<br>
of a three-dimensional radiation pattern, hi addition, the phrase "radiation pattern" is to be<br>
defined as including at least transmission patterns or reception patterns. The isotropic radiation<br>
pattern 210 is a theoretical, ideal model occurring, for example, tn the remote vacuum of space<br>
with a point source of radiation.<br>
In practical settings, for example, in an urban environment, multipara and other<br>
considerations create nonuniformities in the radiation patterns. A signal may bounce off, for<br>
example, the ground, buildings, walls or other reflecting structures before reaching the single<br>
antenna 200 of the conventional wireless cornmunicattons device. Furthermore, since (. signal<br>
may be scattered simultaneously across a plurality of paths in space and time before reaching the<br>
single antenna, the signal may interfere constructively and destrucovery with itself. FIG. 4 shows<br>
another polar plot illustrating ah example of a multipart radiation pattern 260 including a gain<br>
line 230 generated from the single antenna 200. The gain line 230 has been distorted due to<br>
multipath interference. Thus, for example, points 240,250, although equidistant from the single<br>
antenna, effectively see different radiation patterns in which the point 240 sees greater signal gain<br>
than the point 250.<br><br>
Therefore, a user of the conventional wireless communications device, that is suffering<br>
from poor reception or transmission due to multipath conditions, typically may need to physically<br>
move around in a random search for an improved signal (e.g., move from the point i:50 to the<br>
point 240 without knowledge of the shape of the radiation pattern 260). Such physical<br>
translations of the conventional wireless communications device are not convenient and may not<br>
even be available under certain conditions such as, for example, when the user may not be free to<br>
move around.<br>
In addition, since multipath effects result, in part, from constructive and destructive<br>
interference of signals, multipath effects differ at different signal frequencies. Thus, for example,<br>
as shown in a polar plot illustrated in FIG. 5, a first gain line 270 is generated by the single<br>
antenna 200 at a first frequency f1 and a second gain line 2S0 is generated by the single antenna<br>
200 at a second frequency f1.<br>
The conventional wireless communications device may transmit and receive signals at<br>
different frequencies. Thus, for example, via the single antenna, the conventional wireless<br>
communications device may transmit at the first frequency f1 and receive at the second fequency<br>
f2. The conventional wireless communications device effectively experiences, for example, a<br>
radiation pattern for transmission as represented by the gain line 270 and a radiation pattern for<br>
reception as represented by the gain line 280. The consequences during, for example, two-way<br>
wireless communications between the single antenna 200 and a point 290 (e.g., a base stt tion) are<br>
further illustrated in FIG. 5. The point 290 and the antenna 200 effectively experience disparate<br>
radiation patterns depending upon whether the single antenna 200 is transmitting or receiving. In<br>
this case, the single antenna 200 effectively experiences substantially more gain in receiving<br>
signals from the point 290 than in transmitting signals to the point 290. Thus, it is possible, for<br>
example, that although the signal from the point 290 is successfully received, the signal<br>
transmitted to the point 290 may be lost.<br>
Summary Of The Invention<br>
The present invention alleviates to a great extent the disadvantages of conventional<br>
apparatus and methods for receiving and transmitting information in wireless communications<br>
system.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the present invention provides a system and a method for<br>
receiving and transmitting information in a multipath environment including a first antenna, a<br><br><br>
second antenna, a switching module, a receiver module and a transmitter module. Hie switching<br>
module is adapted to couple the receiver module to one of the first antenna or the second antenna<br>
as a function of reception characteristics of the first antenna and the second antenna. The<br>
switching module is also adapted to couple the transmitter module to one of the first antenna or<br>
the second antenna as a function of transmission characteristics of the 'first antenna ind the<br>
second antenna.<br>
The present invention has an advantage in that the wireless communications device<br>
provides the first antenna and the second antenna from which the wireless communications<br>
device can select to optimize transmission characteristics or reception characteristic. The<br>
present invention has an advantage in that the wireless communications device can automatically<br>
couple the transmitting module to the antenna that provides the best transmission characteristics.<br>
The present invention also has an advantage in that the wireless communications device can<br>
automatically couple the receiving module to the antenna mat provides the best reception<br>
characteristics.<br>

Detailed Description Of The Invention<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates an exemplary embodiment of a wireless communications system<br>
including a wireless communications device 100 according to the present invention. The wireless<br><br><br>
communications device 100 may include, for example, a handheld wireless communications<br>
device, a mobile phone, a car phone, a cellular or a personal communications services (PCS)<br>
phone, a cordless phone, a laptop computer or other computing device with a wireless modem, a<br>
pager or a personal digital assistant (PDA). The wireless device 100 may be digital or analog or<br>
some combination thereof. Indeed, the present invention also contemplates other forms of<br>
wireless communications devices known to one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
The wireless communications device 100 may include, for example, a first antenna 110, a<br>
second antenna 120, a switching module 130, a transmitter module 140, a receiver module 150<br>
and a main controller 160. The switching module 130 may include, for example, a receiver<br>
switch 170 and a transmitter switch 180. The main controller 160 may include, for e xample, a<br>
mobile station modem (MSM) or other processor that is programmable. The wireless<br>
communications device 100 may also include other components (e.g., duplexers, diplexers,<br>
amplifiers, mixers, filters, oscillators, etc.) which are known to one of ordinary skill in the art and<br>
not shown or described further herein.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 2A and 2B, the wireless communications device 100 is shown in<br>
one possible arrangement. In this example, the wireless communications device 100 includes<br>
two antennas: the first antenna 110 in a first orientation, and the second antenna 120 oriented in a<br>
second orientation. Preferably, the first antenna 110 will be positioned in an orthogonal<br>
relationship or in another relationship that accentuates differing gain patterns from the first<br>
antenna 110 and the second antenna 120. Also, in this example, the first antenna 110 is mounted<br>
such that the antenna extends, at least in part, outside the housing of the wireless communications<br>
device 100, while the second antenna 120 is mounted inside the housing. It will be appreciated<br>
that other antenna mounting orientations and locations may be selected to support specific<br>
applications and aesthetic considerations.<br>
In the illustrated example, the wireless communications device 100 transmits at frequency<br>
f1 as shown in FIG. 2A and receives at frequency f2 as shown in FIG. 2B. As previously<br>
described, it is likely that each antenna 110, 120 will have a different gain line at the frequency f1<br>
as compared to the gain line at the frequency f1. For example, the first antenna 13 0 has a<br>
radiation pattern with a gain line 115 when operating at the frequency f1 as illustrated in FIG. 2A<br>
and a radiation pattern with a gain line 116 when operating at frequency f3 as illustrated in FIG.<br>
2B. In a similar manner, the second antenna 120 has a radiation pattern with a gain line 125<br>
when operating at frequency f| as illustrated in FIG. 2A and a radiation pattern with a gain line<br><br>
126 when operating at frequency f2 as illustrated in FIG. 2B.<br>
The wireless communications device 100 advantageously uses the difference in gain lines,<br>
such as, for example, between the gain line 115 and fee gain line 125 or between the gain line<br>
116 and the gain line 126, to enhance operation of the wireless communications device 100. For<br>
example, the wireless communications device 100 may determine which of the first antenna 110<br>
or the second antenna 120 is better for transmitting or receiving a communications signal and<br>
may select the better antenna for current communications. In such a manner, more consistent<br>
signal quality may be obtained, which may, for example, reduce dropped calls, enable lower<br>
power usage, or permit faster data transmission. Since gain lines may vary in response, for<br>
example, to movements of the wireless communications device 100 or to changes in the<br>
environment, the wireless communications device 100 may continually determine and se lect the<br>
better antenna. Accordingly, the wireless communications device 100 may maintain i more<br>
consistent signal quality even when moving or when operated in an active, dynamic enviro nment<br>
Referring again to FIG. 1, the wireless communications device 100 is described in more<br>
detail. The main controller 160 is coupled to the transmitter module 140, the receiver nodule<br>
150 and the switching module 130. The transmitter module 140 is coupled to the transmitter<br>
switch 180 of the switching module 130. Via the transmitter switch 180, the transmitter nodule<br>
140 can be coupled to one of the first antenna 110 or the second antenna 120. The receiver<br>
module 150 is coupled to the receiver switch 170 of the switching module 130. Via the re ceiver<br>
switch 170, the receiver module 160 can be coupled to one of the first antenna 110 or the second<br>
antenna 120.<br>
Although illustrated as being in generally in the same direction, the first antenna 110 and<br>
the second antenna 120 can be disposed at an angle to each other. For example, the first antenna<br>
110 is preferably disposed in a direction that is approximately orthogonal to the second antenna<br>
120. Since the orientation of an antenna affects its radiation pattern, the first antenna 110 and the<br>
second antenna 120 may have different radiation patterns. Thus, the second antenna 123 may<br>
provide an alternative radiation partem for the wireless communications device 100.<br>
In operation according to an exemplary embodiment, the main controller 160 receives a<br>
signal from a base station of a wireless communications network via the first antenna 110 or the<br>
second antenna 120. Based on the signal, the main controller 160 sets the transmitting module<br>
140 to transmit, for example, at a frequency f1 and the receiving module 150 to receive at a<br>
frequency f2. The main controller 160 can evaluate which antenna 110, 120 provides the best<br><br><br>
reception characteristics at the frequency f2 in the present environment, which my include<br>
multiple paths. The main controller 160 can also evaluate which antenna 110,120 provides the<br>
best transmission characteristics (e.g., signal strength, clarity, bit error rate, etc.) at the frequency<br>
f1 in the present environment The evaluations can take place periodically or aperiodic ally (e.g.,<br>
triggered by a particular condition). Based on the evaluations, the main controller 160 can<br>
control the switching module 130 to switch the transmitter module 140 or the receiver module<br>
150 to the appropriate antenna 110,120.<br>
For example, during two-way communications between the wireless communications<br>
device 100 and a base station in a wireless communications network (e.g., a two-way<br>
conversation between connected callers), the main controller 160 may determine, for example,<br>
that for the assigned channel at frequency f2, the first antenna 110 provides superior reception to<br>
the second antenna 120 in the present environment. Thus, the main controller 160 sends a<br>
control signal to the switching module 130 that causes the first switch 170 to couple the receiver<br>
module 150 to the first antenna 110. The main controller 160 may also determine, for example,<br>
that for the assigned channel at frequency f1, the first antenna 110 provides superiortranimission<br>
in the present environment. Thus, the main controller 160 sends a control signal to the switching<br>
module 130 that causes the second switch 180 to couple the transmitter module 140 to the first<br>
antenna 110.<br>
In operation according to another exemplary embodiment, the receiver module 150 is<br>
coupled to, for example, the first antenna 110 via the first switch 170 of the switching module<br>
130. The main controller 160 monitors the reception characteristics of the first antenna 110. If<br>
the reception characteristics become poor (e.g., the bit error rate exceeds or is nearing an<br>
applicable error threshold), then the main controller 160 tests the reception characteristics of the<br>
second antenna 110. For example, the main controller 160 may control the switching module<br>
130 such that the first switch 170 couples the receiver module 150 to the second antenna 120 in<br>
order to evaluate the reception characteristics of the second antenna 120. This can be<br>
accomplished relatively quickly. For example, if the reception characteristic of the second<br>
antenna 120 ia evaluated based on, for example, the error bit rate of the second antenna 120, then<br>
an evaluation can be determined even on a bit-by-bit basis.<br>
If the main controller 160 determines that the second antenna 120 has better reception<br>
characteristics (e.g., a lower bit error rate), then the main controller 160 may keep the receiver<br>
module 150 coupled to the second antenna 120. The main controller 160 then monitcrs the<br><br><br>
reception characteristics of the second antenna 120. On the other hand, if the main controller 160<br>
determines that the second antenna 120 does not have (he better reception characteristics, then the<br>
main controller 160 may control the switching module such that the first switch main ains the<br>
coupling between the receiver module 150 and the first antenna 110.<br>
A similar procedure may be implemented by the main controller 160 in monitoring the<br>
transmission characteristics of the antennas 110,120. For example, the main controller 160 may<br>
monitor transmission characteristics (e.g., signal strength) via feedback from the base station.<br>
Thus, if the transmission characteristics become poor(e.g.,signal strength is nearing or is below<br>
a particular strength threshold) for the antenna presently in use for transmission, for exanple, the<br>
second antenna 120, then the main controller 160 can test the transmission characteristics of the<br>
other antenna, for example, the first antenna 110, by coupling the transmitter module 1-10 to the<br>
first antenna 110. In evaluating the transmission characteristic of the antennas 110,120, he main<br>
controller 160 may use feedback information from the base station (e.g., closed loop power<br>
control). If, in this example, the first antenna 110 has the better transmission characteristics, then<br>
the main controller 160 maintains the coupling between the transmitter module 140 and the first<br>
antenna 110. The main controller 160 then monitors the transmission characteristics of the first<br>
antenna 110. On the other hand, if the main controller 160 determines that the first antenna 110<br>
does not have the better transmission characteristics, then the main controller 160 may control the<br>
switching module such mat the second switch 180 couples the transmitter module 140 to the<br>
second antenna 120.<br>
In another exemplary embodiment, after the main controller 160 has, for example,<br>
switched antennas from the first antenna 110 to the second antenna 120 to improve, for example,<br>
transmission characteristics, the main controller 160 can then attempt to match the reception<br>
characteristics with the new transmission characteristics. In this example, if the second antenna<br>
120 has a transmission characteristic which includes a strength parameter of a particular quantity,<br>
then the main controller 160 tests the reception characteristics of the first antenna 110 and the<br>
second antenna 120 to evaluate which one has the reception characteristic, in particular, for this<br>
example, the strength parameter, closest to the particular quantity. The antenna 110,120 selected<br>
does not necessarily have, for example, the largest strength parameter, but only the closest<br>
matched strength parameter.<br>
In yet another exemplary embodiment, the main controller 160 maintains a list of base<br>
stations in range for at least one of the first antenna 110 and the second antenna 120. This list<br><br><br>
can be compiled when the wireless communications device 100 receives signals from all the base<br>
stations in range of the wireless communications device 100 during, for example, a registration<br>
process or other initial process. Furthermore, the list can be updated periodically or aparodically<br>
(e.g., triggered by a particular condition or event). Accordingly, if me transmission<br>
characteristics of the antenna presently being used for transmission becomes poor, the 1 the main<br>
controller 160 can test the transmission characteristics for each of the antennas with each of the<br>
base stations on the list Based upon such tests, a switch in antenna or base station may follow.<br>
If the reception characteristics of the antenna presently being used for reception becomes poor,<br>
then the main controller 160 can test the reception characteristics for each of the antennas with<br>
each of the base stations on the list. Based upon such tests, a switch in antenna or base station<br>
may follow.<br>
Thus, it is seen that systems and methods for receiving and transmitting information in<br>
multipath environments are provided. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the present<br>
invention can be practiced by other than the preferred embodiments which are presented in this<br>
description for purposes of illustration and not of limitation, and the present invention is limited<br>
only by the claims that follow. It is noted that equivalents for the particular embediments<br>
discussed in this description may practice the present invention as well.<br><br>
