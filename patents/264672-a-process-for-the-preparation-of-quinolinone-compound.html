SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0010]	The present invention provides methods of synthesizing heterocyclic<br>
compounds useful in the synthesis of amino substituted benzimidazolyl quinolinone compounds.<br>
[0011]	In one aspect, the present invention provides a method of<br>
synthesizing a compound of Formula VIH:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The method includes reacting 1-methylpiperazine with 5-halo-2-nitroaniline at an internal temperature sufficient to provide the compound of Formula VIH. In such aspects of the method, the 1-methylpiperazine and the 5-halo-2-nitroaniline are reacted in a solvent that comprises water. The water may be present in an amount greater than 50 percent by volume based on the amount of the solvent. In some embodiments, the 5-halo-2-nitroaniline is 5-chloro-2-nitroaniline, and in other embodiments is 5-fluoro-2-nitroaniline.<br>
[0012]	In some embodiments, the solvent comprises water in an amount<br>
greater than 80 percent by volume based on the amount of the solvent. In some such embodiments, the solvent comprises water in an amount greater than 90 percent by volume based on the amount of the solvent. In still further such embodiments, the solvent comprises water in an amount greater than 98 percent by" volume based on the amount of the solvent. In still further such embodiments, the solvent consists essentially of or consists of water. In still other such embodiments, the solvent consists essentially of or consists of de-ionized or distilled water.<br>
[0013]	In some embodiments, the solvent is an aqueous solution comprising<br>
a salt such as NaCI. In some such embodiments, the concentration of the salt in the aqueous solutions ranges from about 1 to about 5 M. In some such embodiments, the concentration of the salt ranges from about 2 to about 5 M, in other embodiments ranges from about 3 to about 4.5 M, and in other embodiments ranges from about 3.5 to about 4.2M. In still other embodiments, the aqueous solution is saturated with a salt such as NaCI.<br>
[0014]	In some embodiments of methods for synthesizing a compound of<br>
Formula VIH, the solvent comprises a salt and an inorganic base. As in other methods described herein, the salt can be NaCI, but is not so limited. The<br>
concentration of the salt in the aqueous solution can range from about 1 to about 5 M, from about 2 to about 5 M, from about 3 to about 5 M, or as described above. Suitable inorganic bases for use in the methods include NaOH, KOH, Ca(OH)2, Mg(OH)2, Na2CO3, K2CO3, K3PO4, or mixtures of any two or more thereof. The amount of inorganic base used in some embodiments can range from about 0.5 to about 4 equivalents based on the amount of 5-halo-2-nitroaniline. In other embodiments, the amount of inorganic base is about 1 to about 4 equivalents, about 1 to about 3 equivalents, about 1.5 to about 2.5 equivalents or about 2 equivalents.<br>
[0015]	In some embodiments, the internal temperature is greater than about<br>
95°C. In various such embodiments, the internal temperature ranges from about 99°C to about 115°C, from about 100°C to about 110°C, from about 105°C to about 115°C, or from about 105°C to about 110°C.<br>
[0016]	In some embodiments, the 1-methylpiperazine and the 5-halo-2-<br>
nitroaniline are reacted at the internal temperature for a reaction time of less than 20 hours. In some such embodiments, the reaction time is less than 10 hours. In some such embodiments, the reaction time is less than 8 hours.<br>
[0017]	In some embodiments, the molar ratio of the 1 -methylpiperazine to<br>
the 5-halo-2-nitroaniline ranges from about 2:1 to about 10:1 at the start of the reaction. In some such embodiments, the molar ratio of the 1-methylpiperazine to the 5-halo-2-nitroaniline ranges from about 3:1 to about 4.5:1 at the start of the reaction. In still other such embodiments, the molar ratio of the 1-methylpiperazine to the 5-halo-2-nitroaniline ranges from about 4:1 to about 4.3:1 at the start of the reaction. An advantage of those methods utilizing a salt and an inorganic base is that less 1-methylpiperazine is needed to produce high yields of the product VIH than is needed without the inorganic base. For example, 1-methylpiperazine and 5-halo-2-nitroaniline can be present at a molar ratio ranging from about 1.5:1 to about 3:1.<br>
[0018]	In some embodiments, the yield of the compound of Formula VIH<br>
based on the amount of 5-halo-2-nitroaniline is greater than 90 percent. In other<br>
embodiments, the yield is greater than 93 percent. In still other embodiments, the yield is greater than 96 percent.<br>
[0019]	In another aspect, there are provided methods for synthesizing a<br>
heterocyclic compound, including reacting a mixture of 1-methylpiperazine and 5-halo-2-nitroaniline in a first solvent and at a first temperature sufficient to provide a compound of Formula VIH in the first solvent, wherein the first solvent is an organic solvent; adding to the mixture a volume of a second solvent, different from the first solvent; and forming a slurry of the compound of Formula VIH. The first solvent can comprise an alcohol. For example, the first solvent can comprise, consist essentially of, or consist of ethanol. In some embodiments, the first; temperature sufficient to provide the compound of Formula VIH can range from about 90°C to about 110°C. In certain embodiments, the 1-methylpiperazine and the 5-halo-2-nitroaniline are present at a molar ratio ranging from about 2:1 to about 5:1. In some embodiments, the 5-halo-2-nitroaniline is 5-chloro-2-nitroaniline, and in other embodiments, is 5-fluoro-2-nitroaniline.<br>
[0020]	In some embodiments of methods for synthesizing a heterocyclic<br>
compound, the second solvent comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of water. Such methods may further include cooling the mixture containing the compound of Formula VIH to a second temperature not less than 80% of the first temperature before the volume of water is added, and wherein the water is heated to about the second temperature before addition. For example, the second temperature can range from about 85°C to about 95°C. In some embodiments, the slurry is formed by cooling the reaction mixture to a third temperature (e.g., from about 15°C to about 25°C) to induce formation of a slurry of the compound of Formula VIH.<br>
[0021]	In other embodiments of methods for synthesizing a heterocyclic<br>
compound, the second solvent is an organic solvent, the second solvent comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of heptane. In some embodiments, the methods further comprise cooling the mixture containing the compound of Formula VIH to a second temperature not less than 70% of the first temperature, e.g. about 70°C to about 85°C, before the volume of second solvent is added. As<br>
above, the slurry is formed by cooling the reaction mixture to a third temperature such as from about 15°C to about 25°C to induce formation of a slurry of the compound of Formula VIH. The methods may further include adding a second volume of a second organic solvent during cooling to the third temperature to form crystals of the compound of Formula VIH. The crystals of compound VIH may be collected and washed with water.<br>
[0022]	In another aspect, the invention provides methods for synthesizing a<br>
heterocyclic compound through more efficient use of 1-methylpiperazine by separating the product from the reaction solution and reusing the remaining reaction solution.

The first reaction mixture may be cooled and filtered to give a first filtered solid comprising the compound of Formula VIH and a first filtrate comprising the solvent. . The reaction may be carried out a second time by adding to the first filtrate 1-methylpiperazine, 5-halo-2-nitroaniline, and an amount of a base sufficient to neutralize any HCI in the first filtrate, to give a second reaction mixture, at a temperature sufficient to provide the compound of Formula VIH. Again, the second reaction mixture is cooled and filtered to provide a second filtered solid comprising the compound of Formula VIH and a second filtrate comprising the solvent. The methods may further include adding to the second filtrate, 1-methylpiperazine, 5-halo-2-nitroaniline, and an amount of a base sufficient to neutralize any HCI in the second filtrate, to give a third reaction mixture, at a temperature sufficient to provide the compound of Formula VIH. The third reaction mixture may be cooled and filtered to give a third filtered solid comprising the compound of Formula VIH and a third filtrate comprising the solvent. In some embodiments, the salt is NaCI. In other embodiments, the base is NaOH or KOH. Temperature for the reaction solution my range, e.g., from'about 95°C to about 120°C. In some embodiments, the 5-halo-2-nitroaniline is 5-chlorb-2-nitroaniline, and in other embodiments, is 5-fluoro-2-nitroaniline.<br>
[0023]	In another aspect, the present invention provides a method of<br>
synthesizing a compound of Formula VIH, including reacting 1-methylpiperazine<br>
with 5-halo-2-nitroaniline at an internal temperature sufficient to provide the compound of Formula VIH. The 1-methylpiperazine and the 5-halo-2-nitroaniline are reacted in a solvent that comprises an organic solvent component that has a boiling point of greater than about 100°C at atmospheric pressure. In some embodiments, the 5-halo-2-nitroaniline is 5-chloro-2-nitroaniline, and in other embodiments, is 5-fluoro-2-nitroaniline.<br>
[0024]	In some embodiments, the solvent is a compound of Formula HO-<br>
(CH2)q-OH or HO-CH2CH2OCH2CH2-OH, wherein q is selected from 2,3, or 4. In some such embodiments, the solvent comprises propylene glycol or ethylene glycol. In still further such embodiments, the solvent consists essentially of or consists of propylene glycol or ethylene glycol. In still further such embodiments, the solvent consists essentially of or consists of ethylene glycol.<br>
[0025]	In some embodiments, the internal temperature is greater than about<br>
95°C. In various such embodiments, the internal temperature ranges from about 99°C to about 130°C, from about 115°C to about 130°C, or from about 120°C to about125°C.<br>
[0026]	In some embodiments, the 1-methylpiperazine and the 5-chloro-2-<br>
i<br>
nitroaniline are reacted at the internal temperature for a reaction time of less than 20 hours. In some such embodiments, the reaction time is less than 10 hours. In some such embodiments, the reaction time is less than 8 hours. In still other embodiments, the reaction time ranges from 3-6 hours, and in some embodiments ranges from 4-5 hours.<br>
[0027]	In some embodiments, the molar ratio of the 1 -methylpiperazine to<br>
the 5-halo-2-nitroaniline ranges from about 2:1 to about 10:1 at the start of the reaction. In some such embodiments, the molar ratio of the 1-methyipiperazine to the 5-halo-2-nitroaniline ranges from about 3:1 to about 4.5:1 at the start of the reaction.

[0045]         The phrase "unsubstituted alky!" refers to alkyl groups that do not contain heteroatoms. Thus the phrase includes straight chain alkyl groups such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, undecyl, dodecyl and the like. The phrase also includes branched chain isomers of straight chain alkyl groups, including but not limited to, the following which are provided by way of example: -CH(CH3)2, -CH(CH3)(CH2CH3), -CH(CH2CH3)2, -C(CH3)3l -C(CH2CH3)3, -CH2CH(CH3)2, -CH2CH(CH3)(CH2CH3), -CH2CH(CH2CH3)2, -CH2C(CH3)3, -CH2C(CH2CH3)3, -CH(CH3)CH(CH3)(CH2CH3), -CH2CH2CH(CH3)2, -CH2CH2CH(CH3)(CH2CH3), -CH2CH2CH(CH2CH3)2l -CH2CH2C(CH3)3, -CH2CH2C(CH2CH3)3, -CH(CH3)CH2CH(CH3)2l -CH(CH3)CH(CH3)CH(CH3)2, -CH(CH2CH3)CH(CH3)CH(CH3)(CH2CH3), and others. The phrase also includes cyclic alkyl groups such as cycloalkyl groups such as cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl,<br>
cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl, and cyclooctyl and such rings substituted with straight and branched chain alkyl groups as defined above. The phrase also includes polycyclic alkyl groups such as, but not limited to, adamantyl norbornyl, and bicyclo[2.2.2]octyl and such rings substituted with straight and branched chain alkyl groups as defined above. Thus, the phrase unsubstituted alkyl groups includes primary alkyl groups, secondary alkyl groups, and tertiary alkyl groups. Unsubstituted alkyl groups may be bonded to one or more carbon atom(s), oxygen atom(s), nitrogen atom(s), and/or sulfur atom(s) in the parent compound. Preferred unsubstituted alkyl groups include straight and branched chain alkyl groups and cyclic alkyl groups having 1 to 20 carbon atoms. More preferred such unsubstituted alkyl groups have from 1 to 10 carbon atoms while even more preferred such groups have from 1 to 5 carbon atoms. Most preferred unsubstituted alkyl groups include straight and branched chain alkyl groups having from 1 to 3 carbon atoms and include methyl, ethyl, propyl, and -<br>
[0046]         The phrase "substituted alkyl" refers to an unsubstituted alkyl group as defined above in which one or more bonds to a carbon(s) or hydrogen(s) are replaced by a bond to non-hydrogen and non-carbon atoms such as, but not limited to, a halogen atom in halides such as F, Cl, Br, and I; an oxygen atom in groups such as hydroxyl groups, alkoxy groups, aryloxy groups, and ester groups; a sulfur atom in groups such as thiol groups, alkyl and aryl sulfide groups, sulfone groups, sulfonyl groups, and sulfoxide groups; a nitrogen atom in groups such as amines, amides, alkylamines, dialkylamines, arylamines, alkylarylamines, diarylamines, N-oxides, imides, and enamines; a silicon atom in groups such as in trialkylsilyl groups, dialkylarylsilyl groups, alkyldiarylsilyl groups, and triarylsilyl groups; and other heteroatoms in various other groups.

Preferred substituted alkyl groups include, among others, alkyl groups in which one or more bonds to a carbon or hydrogen atom is/are replaced by one or more bonds to fluorine atoms. One example of a substituted alkyl group is the trifluoromethyl group and other alkyl groups that contain the trifluoromethyl group. Other alkyl<br>
groups include those in which one or more bonds to a carbon or hydrogen atom is replaced by a bond to an oxygen atom such that the substituted alkyl group contains a hydroxyl, alkoxy, aryloxy group, or heterocyclyloxy group.

some embodiments, any of the reactions of the method are followed by HPLC and are conducted for a period of time until the starting materials are observed to no longer be present in any appreciable amounts.<br>
[0090]	Improved methods for synthesizing a compound of Formula VIH have<br>
been discovered:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 The methods can be used to synthesize heterocyclic compounds other than VIH. For example, a 5-halo-2-nitroaniline compound such as 5-chloro-2-nitroaniline may be reacted with a N-containing heterocycle such as a substituted or unsubstituted pyrrolidine, a substituted or unsubstituted piperazine such as an N-alkyI piperazine, or a substituted or unsubstituted piperidine to form desired compounds of formula VIHa where Het is a N-containing heterocycle, and a N atom of the heterocycle is bonded to the benzene ring. In some embodiments, the heterocycle is a saturated heterocycle such as a piperazine, piperidine, or pyrrolidine.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 In some embodiments, the halo group of the 5-halo-2-nitroaniline compound used in the synthesis is a fluorine or a chlorine such that the compound is 5-fluoro-2-nitroaniline or 5-chloro-2-nitroaniline. Thus, some methods include reacting a mixture of 1-methylpiperazine and a 5-halo-2-nitroaniline compound such as 5-chloro-2-nitroaniline at an internal temperature sufficient to provide a compound of<br>
Formula VIH. Excess amounts of the heterocycle may be used to force the reaction to completion.<br>
[0091]	For example, the methods include reacting a mixture of<br>
1-methylpiperazine and 5-halo-2-nitroaniline in a first solvent and at a first temperature sufficient to provide a compound of Formula VIH in the first solvent, e.g., at from about 70° to about 140°C, at from about 80° to about 120°C, at from about 90° to about 110°C, more typically from about 90° to about 100°C, or even from about 95° to abput 100°C. The first solvent is an organic solvent, e.g., an alcohol such as ethanol. The 1-methylpiperazine and 5-halo-2-nitroaniline may be present at a molar ratio ranging from about 0.5:1 to about 10:1. In some embodiments, excess 1-methylpiperazine versus nitroaniline may be used to force the reaction to completion. For example, the 1-methylpiperazine and 5-halo-2-nitroaniline can be present at a molar ratio ranging from about 2:1 to about 5:1, from about 3:1 to about 5:1, or from about 3.5:1 to about 4.5:1. To isolate the compound of Formula VIH from the reaction mixture, a volume of a second solvent, different from the first solvent, is added to the reaction mixture, and forming a slurry of the compound of Formula VIH.<br>
[0092]	In some embodiments, the second solvent comprises water. In other<br>
embodiments, the second solvent consists of or consists essentially of water. In some embodiments, the mixture containing the compound of Formula VIH is cooled to a second temperature not less than 80% of the first temperature (e.g., about 85° to about 95°C) before the volume of water is added. In still other embodiments, the mixture is cooled to a temperature not less than 90% of the first temperature. Before addition to the mixture, the water is heated to about the same temperature as the mixture, i.e., about the second temperature. The slurry is then formed by cooling the reaction mixture to a third temperature, e.g., about 15° to about 25°C. Overtime, the slurry thickens and uniform crystals of VIH are obtained.<br>
[0093]	In other embodiments, the second solvent is an organic solvent such<br>
as heptane. The reaction mixture can be cooled to a second temperature not less than 70% of the initial temperature before adding the second solvent to the mixture (e.g., about 70°C io about 85°C). The reaction mixture containing the second<br>
solvent is cooled to a third temperature (e.g., about 15°C to about 25°C) to form a slurry of the compound of Formula VIH. A second volume of the second solvent may be added during cooling to aid in the formation of crystals of the compound of Formula VIH . As above, the reaction mixture is cooled further to a temperature of, e.g., about 15 to about 25°C, to form crystals of VIH. The crystals of compound VIH may be collected and washed with water by, e.g., filtration. It is advantageous, but not required, that the crystals be substantially free of ethanol before washing with water to avoid production of fine particles that are difficult to handle. After the water wash, the crystals may optionally be washed again with an organic solvent such as heptane and subsequently dried. Drying may be performed in vacuo with or without heating above ambient temperature. The compound of Formula VIH has a purity equal to or greater than 90 percent in some embodiments, equal to or greater than 95 percent in other embodiments, and equal to or greater than 99 percent in yet other embodiments.<br>
[0094]	In some embodiments, the improved methods for synthesizing a<br>
compound of Formula VIH are conducted in a solvent that comprises water in an amount greater than about 50 percent by volume based on the amount of the solvent and/or are reacted in a solvent that comprises an organic solvent component that has a boiling point of greater than about 100°C at atmospheric pressure. Although compounds of formula VIH may be readily synthesized by reaction of 1-methylpiperazine with 5-halo-2-nitroaniline in ethanol, it has been discovered that reaction times are significantly shortened and excellent yields obtained when these reactions are conducted in water or in a solvent that includes an organic solvent component with a boiling point of about 100°C or greater. For example, when the reaction is performed in an aqueous solution with a salt such as NaCI (other salts such as KCI may be used as will be apparent to those skilled in the art) at a concentration ranging from about 0 to about 5 M, the reaction is typically complete (as determined using HPLC) within about 5 to about 6 hours as opposed to 36-40 hours when conducted in ethanol at 97°C. The improved time-efficiency gained by performing the reaction in water or in an aqueous salt solution provides significant cost benefits during manufacturing. When the reaction is conducted in an aqueous NaCI solution at about 100°C to about 110°C, the product<br>
compound was isolated in 94% yield with 99.4% purity by HPLC. This compares favorably with the yield ranging from 90-100 percent when the reaction is performed in ethanol.<br>
[0095]	In addition to the shortened reaction time, the reaction work up is<br>
typically simpler when the formation of VIH is accomplished using the improved methods of the invention. For example, when the synthesis is carried out in an aqueous salt solution at about 100°C to about 110°C, the workup typically involves adding water to the reaction mixture at about 90°C to about 105°C, inducing product crystallization. Granular crystals were typically observed at this stage which is desirable as this positively impacts filterability and drying time. After cooling to room temperature (about 20°C to about 25°C), the desired product (VIH) may be filtered, washed, and dried in a vacuum oven. Shortened reaction times were also obtained when the reaction of 1-methylpiperazine with 5-chloro-2-nitroaniline was conducted in a solvent that includes an organic solvent component, such as ethylene glycol, that has a boiling point of about 100°C or greater. When the reaction is conducted in water at about 100°C to about 108°C, the reaction is typically complete within about 6 to about 7 hours. When the reaction is conducted in ethylene glycol at about 120°C to about 125°C, the reaction is typically complete within 4-5 hours. In some embodiments the temperature range is from about 95 to about120°C.<br>

In still other such embodiments, the solvent consists essentially of or consists of de-ionized or distilled water.<br>
[0098]	In some embodiments, the solvent is an aqueous solution comprising<br>

In some embodiments, the reaction is conducted at atmospheric pressure whereas in other embodiments, the reaction is conducted at a pressure up to about 2 atm.<br>
[0100]	In some embodiments, the 1 -methylpiperazine and the 5-halo-2-<br>
nitroaniline are reacted at the internal temperature for a reaction time of less than about 20 hours. In some such embodiments, the reaction time is less than about 10 hours. In some such embodiments, the reaction time is less than about 8 hours.<br>
[0101]	it has been discovered that the use of inorganic bases can reduce the<br>
amount of excess 1-methylpiperazine needed to drive the reaction toward product. Use of inorganic bases in some embodied methods results in high yields and high purities of the compound of Formula VIH in less time than the same reaction without the inorganic bases. Thus, in some embodiments, the methods include reacting a mixture of 1-methylpiperazine and 5-halo-2-nitroaniline in a solvent at a temperature sufficient to provide a compound of Formula VIH, the solvent is an aqueous solution comprising a salt and an inorganic base.

[0124]         Scheme 1 depicts one exemplary synthetic route for the synthesis of a compound of a benzimidazolyl quinolinone compound and should not be interpreted to limit the invention in any manner. As shown below, the reaction of a first compound with a second compound is believed to proceed via an uncyclized intermediate. However, this will be understood to not limit the invention in any manner. The potassium salt of the resulting compound having the formula III produced on cyclization of the intermediate has been found to have reduced solubility resulting in precipitation of the product from the reaction. This was surprising and unexpected given that precipitation was not observed when a lithium salt such as LiHMDS was used rather than a potassium salt such as KHMDS. The use of the potassium salt rather than a lithium salt provides a greatly enhanced yield of compounds having the formula III such as compounds having the formula' NIB as shown in Scheme 1 especially when a base such as a potassium alkoxide such as potassium t-butoxide is employed. The reaction of the first compound with the second compound was also found to provide significantly higher yields of compounds having the formula III when the reaction was conducted with solvents and reactants with jow water contents. For example, the yield was found to improve significantly when the second compound was dried as described herein<br>
such as by azeotropic evaporation from absolute ethanol or in the reaction vessel<br>
by repeated addition of THF followed by distillation. The yield of the compound having the formula VI, such as a compound having the formula VIH, produced by the reaction of an N-alkyl piperazine such as N-methyl piperazine with the compound having the formula VII, was increased when the temperature was lowered and the amount of the compound having the formula HR7 was increased with respect to the compound having the formula VI. The temperatures of the reaction were lowered and the reaction was diluted with ethanol during scale up. For example, good yields were obtained when the reaction was conducted at a temperature of 90°C to 100°C, and the compound having the formula HR7, such as N-methyl piperazine, was present in an amount of greater than 2.5 equivalents with respect to the amount of the compound having the formula VI, such as 5-chloro-2-nitroaniline. In some such embodiments, the compound having the formula HR7 is present in an amount of greater than 2.8, greater than 2.9, greater than 3.0, or from 2.5 to 5 equivalents with respect to the amount of the compound having the formula VI.<br>
(Scheme  Removed)<br>
 [0125]	Scheme 2 depicts a method for synthesizing a compound having the<br>
formula VA and shows the general application of the method of the invention. Those skilled in the art will understand that the selection of a substituted or unsubstituted diaminobenzene and a substituted or unsubstituted anthranilonitrile allows for the synthesis of a wide variety of compounds having the formula III. Those skilled in the art will also recognize that certain groups may need protection using standard protecting groups for the final cyclization reaction. The extremely versatile synthetic route allows a plethora of compounds having the formula III to be readily prepared by a highly convergent and efficient synthetic route.<br>

(871 g, 8.693 mol) were placed in a 2000 mL flask fitted with a condenser and<br>
purged with N2. The flask was placed in an oil bath at 100°C and heated until the 5-chloro-2-riitroaniline was completely reacted (typically overnight) as determined by HPLC. After HPLC confirmed the disappearance of the 5-chloro-2-nitroaniline, the reaction mixture was poured directly (still warm) into 2500 ml of room temperature water with mechanical stirring. The resulting mixture was stirred until it reached room temperature and then it was filtered. The yellow solid thus obtained was added to 1000 ml of water and stirred for 30 minutes. The resulting mixture was filtered, and the resulting solid was washed with TBME (500 mL, 2X) and then was dried under vacuum for one hour using a rubber dam. The resulting solid was transferred to a drying tray and dried in a vacuum oven at 50°C to a constant weight to yield 670 g (97.8%) of the title compound as a yellow powder.<br>
Procedure B<br>
[0131]	5-Chloro-2-nitroaniline (308.2 g, 1.79 mol) was added to a 4-neck<br>
5000 ml round bottom flask fitted with an overhead stirrer, condenser, gas inlet, addition funnel, and thermometer probe. The flask was then purged with N2. 1-Methylpiperazine (758.1 g, 840 ml, 7.57 mol) and 200 proof ethanol (508 ml) were added to the reaction flask with stirring. The flask was again purged with N2, and the reaction was maintained under N2. The flask was heated in a heating mantle to an internal temperature of 97°C (+A 5°C) and maintained at that temperature until the reaction was complete (typically about 40 hours) as determined by HPLC. After the reaction was complete, heating was discontinued and the reaction was cooled<br>
to an internal temperature of about 20°C to 25°C with stirring, and the reaction was<br>
/<br>
stirred for 2 to 3 hours. Seed crystals (0.20 g, 0.85 mmol) of 5-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-2-nitroaniline were added to the reaction mixture unless precipitation had already occurred. Water (2,450 ml) was added to the stirred reaction mixture over a period of about one hour while the internal temperature was maintained at a temperature ranging from about 20°C to 30°C. After the addition of water was complete, the resulting mixture was stirred for about one hour at a temperature of 20°C to 30°C. The resulting mixture was then filtered, and the flask and filter cake were washed with water (3 x 2.56 L). The golden yellow solid product was dried to a constant weight of 416 g (98.6% yield) under vacuum at about 50°C in a vacuum oven. <br>

The flask was again purged with N2, and the reaction was maintained under N2. The flask was heated in a heating mantle to an internal temperature of 97°C (+/- 5°C) and maintained at that temperature until the reaction was complete (typically about 40 hours) as determined by HPLC. After the reaction was complete, heating was discontinued and the reaction was cooled to an internal temperature of about 80°C with stirring, and water (3.15 L) was added to the mixture via an addition funnel over the. period of 1 hour while the internal temperature was maintained at 82°C (+/- 3°C). After water addition was complete, heating was discontinued and the reaction mixture was allowed to cool over a period of no less than 4 hours to an internal temperature of 20-25°C; The reaction mixture was then stirred for an additional hour at an internal temperature of 20-30°C. The resulting mixture was then filtered, and the flask and filter cake were Washed with water (1 x 1 L), 50% ethanol (1 x 1L), and 95% ethanol (1 x 1L). The golden yellow solid product was placed in a drying pan and dried to a constant weight of 546 g (99% yield) under vacuum at about 50°C in a vacuum oven.<br>
Procedure D<br>

3000 m|_ round bottom flask fitted with an overhead stirrer, condenser, gas inlet, addition funnel, and thermometer probe. The round bottom flask was then purged with N2. 1-Methylpiperazine (550 g, 552 mL, 4.98 mol) and de-ionized water (330 ml) were added to a 1000 ml Erlenmeyer flask. The aqueous solution of 1-methylpiperazine (~ 880 mL) was added in a steady stream to the round bottom flask over a period of about 5 minutes. The flask was again purged with N2, and the reaction was maintained under N2. The flask was stirred at about 800 rpm and heated in a heating mantle to an internal temperature of 110°C (+/- 5°C) and maintained at that temperature until the reaction was complete (typically about 7 hours) as determined by HPLC. De-ionized water (170 mL) and isopropanol (500<br>
mL) were added to an Erlenmeyer flask. The heating of the reaction mixture was discontinued and the aqueous isopropanol mixture was then added to the reaction mixture, in a steady stream. This caused the temperature of the reaction mixture to drop to an internal temperature of about 66.5 °C. The mixture crystallized and was held overnight with stirring at a temperature of 40-50 °C. The resulting mixture was then filtered, and the flask and filter cake were washed twice with an aqueous isopropanol solution (3:1 waterisopropanol; 2 x400 mL) at about 15-20 °C. The orange solid product was dried to a constant weight of 267.3 g (97.6 % yield) under vacuum at about 50°C in a vacuum oven.<br>

[0134]	5-Chloro-2-nitroaniline (150.0 g, 0.87 mol) was added to a 4-neck<br>
3000 mL round bottom flask fitted with an overhead stirrer, condenser, gas inlet, addition funnel, and thermometer probe. The round bottom flask was then purged with N2. Sodium chloride (57.87 g) and de-ionized water (250 mL) were added to a 500 mL Erlenmeyer flask. The resulting 4M sodium chloride solution was added in a steady stream to the round bottom flask. 1-Methylpiperazine (348 g, 386 mL, 3.48 mol) was added to the round bottom flask in a steady stream over a period of about 20 seconds. The flask was again purged with Na, and the reaction was maintained under N2. The flask was heated in a heating mantle to an internal temperature of 110°C (+/- 5°C) and maintained at that temperature until the reaction was complete (typically about 5-6 hours) as determined by HPLC. De-ionized water (500 mL) was added drop wise to the reaction mixture while maintaining an internal temperature of 108-110 C°. The resulting slurry was stirred for about 30 minutes. The heating of the reaction mixture was discontinued, an additional 500 mL of water was added to the reaction mixture over a period of about 1 minute, and the reaction mixture was cooled to about 22 °C. The resulting mixture was then filtered, and the flask and filter cake were washed with water (750 mL) and with an aqueous ethanol solution (1:1 waterethanol; 750 mL). The solid product was dried to a constant weight of 192.8 g (93.9 % yield) under vacuum at about 50°C in a vacuum oven.<br>
Procedure F<br>
[0135]	5-Chloro-2-nitroaniline (100.0 g, 0.58 mol) was added to a 3-neck<br>
2000 ml round bottom flask fitted with an overhead stirrer, condenser, gas inlet, addition funnel, and thermometer probe. The round bottom flask was then purged with N2. Ethylene glycol (100 ml) was added to the round bottom flask and the mixture was stirred under N2. 1-Methylpiperazine (232 g, 257 ml, 2.32 mol) was then added to the round bottom flask. The flask was again purged with N2, and the reaction was maintained under N2. The flask was heated in a heating, mantle to an internal temperature of 122°C (+/- 5°C) and maintained at that temperature until the reaction was complete (typically about 4-5 hours) as determined by HPLC. The heating of the reaction mixture was discontinued and water (800 mL) was added to the reaction mixture over a period of about 6 minutes. The resulting slurry was heated to an internal temperature of about 103 °C and stirred for about 30 minutes. The slurry was then cooled to an internal temperature of 20-25 "C'with stirring overnight (~ 14 hours). The resulting.mixture was then filtered, and the flask and filter cake were washed twice with water (2 x 500 ml) and once with an aqueous ethanbl solution (1:1 watenethanol; 500 ml). The resulting solid product was dried to a constant weight of 126.9 g (92.7 % yield) under vacuum at about 50°C in a vacuum oven.<br>
Procedure G<br>
[0136]         A1-L, 4-neck round bottom flask was equipped with a heating mantle, an overhead stirrer, condenser, nitrogen inlet, and thermocouple. The flask was charged with 5-chloro-2-nitroaniline (150 g, 869 mmol, 1 equiv), 1-methylpiperazine (348 ml, 386 g, 3.48 mol, 4 equiv) and 4M aqueous NaCI (247 mL). The contents of the flask were stirred and purged with N2 for at least 15 min. The reactor was then heated until an internal temperature of 110-112°C was reached. The contents were stirred for 7-8 h until the reaction was complete as determined by HPLC. After completion, the reaction mixture was cooled to 20°C over 2h to precipitate the product as a slurry, and stirring was continued for an additional 16 h. The solid was vacuum filtered, and the mother liquor collected in the original reaction vessel. The solids were washed on the filter with H20 (2 x 250 mL), followed by soaking in heptane (200 mL) for 0.5 h. The slurry was again filtered via vacuum, and dried in<br>
vacua (50°C, 30 in. Hg) to yield 5-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-2-nitroaniline (197.8 g, 96.3% yield). Residual N-methylpiperazine was not detected by 1H NMR.<br>
[0137]	The mother liquor of the reaction was recycled by the addition of<br>
NaOH pellets (34.9 g, 869 mmol, 1 equiv) to the mother liquor, followed by stirring until the NaOH was dissolved. 1-Methylpiperazine (96.5 ml, 869 mmol, 1 equiv) and 5-chloro-2-nitroaniline (150 g, 869 mmol) were charged to the vessel. Purging, followed by heating to completion, cooling, filtration, and washing with heptane was repeated as above to yield 5-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-2-nitroaniline (203.2 g, 98.9% yield). Residual N-methylpiperazine was not detected by 1H NMR.<br>
[0138] The mother liquor was recycled a second time according to the above procedure to yield 5-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-2-nitroaniline (203.43 g, 99.0% yield). Less than 1 % residual N-methylpiperazine was detected by 1H NMR.<br>
Procedure H<br>
[0139]	A 4-neck, 5-L round bottom flask in a heating mantle was equipped<br>
with an overhead stirrer, condenser, N2 inlet, and thermocouple. 5-Chloro-2-nitroaniline (365.3 g, 2.11 mol) and 1-methylpiperazine (848.6 g, 8.46 mol, 4 equiv) were charged to the flask along with 200-proof EtOH (595 mL). This mixture was stirred and purged with N2 for not less than 15 min. The reaction mixture was then heated, with stirring, until an internal temperature of 97°C±5°C was reached. Stirring was continued while maintaining a temperature of 97°C±5°C until the reaction was complete (ca. 41 h), as determined by HPLC. De-ionized H2O (1900 ml) was pre-heated to ca. 90°C in a separate vessel. The reaction mixture was cooled to 90°C and the pre-heated H20 (1900 mL) was transferred to the reaction vessel over 2-3 min. The entire the reaction mixture was then cooled to 25°C over 4 h. When the temperature reached about 80°C, the product precipitated as a thin slurry that continued to thicken as the suspension cooled. The crude product was then collected by vacuum filtration on a Buchner funnel. The mother liquor was recycled though the reaction Vessel to transfer residual solids to the filter. The crude product was washed with fresh de-ionized H20 (2 x 900 mL). The product was dried in vacua (80°C, 28-30 in. Hg) until constant weight was reached (ca.<br>
21 h). The product was collected in 94.1 % yield (471g). Residual N-methylpiperazine was not detected by 1H NMR.<br>
Procedure I<br>
[0140]         A 4-neck, 5-L round bottom flask in a heating mantle was equipped with an overhead stirrer, condenser, combination gas inlet/thermocouple (via a Claissen adapter), and addition funnel. 5-chloro-2-nitroaniline (500 g, 2.90 mol) was charged to the reactor and purged with N2, followed by the addition of 1-methylpiperazine (1160 g, 1.28 L, 11.58 mol) and 200 proof EtOH (811 ml) to the reactor. The mixture was stirred and the N2 purge continued for not less than 15 min. The reaction mixture was heated to 97°C±5°C. The stirring was continued and the temperature held at 97°C±5°C until the reaction was complete by HPLC (ca. 40 h).<br>
[0141]         The reaction mixture was then cooled to 75-80°C and heptane (375 ml) was added over 5-10 min. Following heptane addition, the reaction mixture was cooled to 65°C±3°C to precipitate the product. (If precipitation has not occurred, the solution may be seeded with 5-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-2-nitroaniline and held for 20-30 min. Additional heptane (125 ml) may be added to aid in precipitation). After cooling the reaction mixture to 65°C, additional heptane (1.63 L) was added to the slurry, over 30-45 min while maintaining the temperature at 65°C±3°C. After heptane addition, the slurry was cooled to 17-22°C over 1 h and held at that temperature for not less than 1 h. The product was filtered on a 3L, coarse-fritted, vacuum funnel. The mother liquor was recycled though the reaction vessel to transfer residual solids.' De-ionized H2O (2.00 L) was added to the funnel and held in the funnel for not less than 5 minutes.  The water was then removed by vacuum filtration. The solid was washed with fresh de-ionized H2O (2 x 1.1 L) on the filter. Heptane (1.5 L) was added to the funnel and allowed to penetrate the cake for not less than 30 min, after which time the vacuum was applied to remove the heptane. The product was dried in vacuo (75-80°C, 28-30 in. Hg) until constant weight was reached. 5-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-2-nitroaniline was obtained in 92.9% yield (636 g). Residual N-methylpiperazine was not detected by 1H NMR.<br>

[0142]	To a 4-dram vial was added 5-chloro-2-nitroaniline (0.5 g, 2.90 mmol,<br>
1 equiv.), NaOH (0.229 g, 5.71 mmol, 1.98 equiv.), 4 M NaCI (0.82 ml, aq.), and 1-methylpiperazine (0.643 g, 0.71 ml, 5.79 mmol, 2 equiv.). The mixture was heated on a hot plate to 105°C for 22 h. De-ionized H20 (6 mL) was added to the mixture, which was cooled to room temperature, and the precipitate collected on a Buchner funnel. The precipitate was then washed with de-ionized HaO (5 mL) and heptane (5 mL). After drying in a vacuum oven (80°C, 30 in. Hg) overnight, the product (0.624 g, 91.1 %) was collected. According to HPLC analysis, the sample had a purity of 99.6 %.<br>

(Formula Removed)<br><br>
Procedure A<br>
[0144]         A 5000 mL, 4-neck flask was fitted with a stirrer, thermometer, condenser, and gas inlet/outlet. The equipped flask was charged with 265.7 g (1.1-2 mol. 1.0 eq) of 5-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-2-nitroaniline and 2125 mL of 200<br>
proof EtOH. The resulting solution was purged with N2 for 15 minutes. Next, 20.0 g of 5% Pd/C (50% H2O w/w) was added. The reaction was vigorously stirred at 40-50°C (internal temperature) while H2 was bubbled through the mixture. The reaction was monitored hourly for the disappearance of 5-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-2-nitroaniline by HPLC. The typical reaction time was 6 hours.<br>
[0145]	After all the 5-(4-methyl-piperazin-1 -yl)-2-nitroaniline had disappeared<br>
from the reaction, the solution was purged with N2 for 15 minutes. Next, 440.0 g (2.25 mol) of ethyl 3-ethoxy-3-iminopropanoate hydrochloride was added as a solid. The reaction was stirred at 40-50°C (internal temperature) until the reaction was complete. The reaction was monitored by following the disappearance of the diamino compound by HPLC. The typical reaction time was 1-2 hours. After the reaction was complete, it was cooled to room temperature and filtered through a pad of Celite filtering material. The Celite filtering material was washed with absolute EtOH (2 x 250 mL), and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure providing a thick brown/orange oil. The resulting oil was taken up in 850 , ml of a 0.37% HCI solution. Solid NaOH (25 g) was then added in one portion, and a precipitate formed. The resulting mixture was stirred for 1 hour and then filtered. The solid was washed with H20 (2 x 400 mL) and dried at 50°C in a vacuum oven providing 251.7g (74.1%)of [6-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl]-acetic acid ethyl ester as a pale yellow powder.<br>
Procedure B<br>
[0146]         A 5000 mL, 4-neck jacketed flask was fitted with a mechanical stirrer, condenser, temperature probe, gas inlet, and oil bubbler. The equipped flask was charged with 300 g (1.27 mol) of 5-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-2-nitroaniline and 2400 mL of 200 proof EtOH (the reaction may be and has been conducted with 95% ethanol and it is not necessary to use 200 proof ethanol for this reaction). The resulting solution was stirred and purged with N2 for 15 minutes. Next, 22.7 g of 5% Pd/C (50% H2O w/w) was added to the reaction flask. The reaction vessel was purged with N2 for 15 minutes. After purging with N2, the reaction vessel was purged with H2 by maintaining a slow, but constant flow of H2 through the flask. The reaction was stirred at 45-55°C (internal temperature) while H2 was bubbled<br>
through the mixture until the 5-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-2-nitroaniline was<br>
completely consumed as determined by HPLC. The typical reaction time was 6 hours.<br>
[0147]         After all the 5-(4-methyl-piperazin-1 -yl)-2-nitroaniline had disappeared' from the reaction, the solution was purged with N2 for 15 minutes. The diamine intermediate is air sensitive so care was taken to avoid exposure to air. 500 g (2.56 mol) of ethyl 3-ethoxy-3-iminopropanoate hydrochloride was added to the reaction mixture over a period of about 30 minutes. The reaction was stirred at 45-55°C (internal temperature) under Na until the diamine was completely consumed as determined by HPLC. The typical reaction time was about 2 hours. After the reaction was complete, the reaction was filtered while warm through a pad of Celite. The reaction flask and Celite were then washed with 200 proof EtOH (3 x 285 mL). The filtrates were combined in a 5000 mL flask, and about 3300 mL of ethanol was removed under vacuum producing an orange oil. Water (530 mL) and then 1M HCL (350 mL) were added to the resulting oil, and the resulting mixture was stirred. The resulting solution was vigorously stirred while 30% NaOH (200 mL) was added over a period of about 20 minutes maintaining the internal temperature at about 25-' 30°C while the pH was brought to between 9 and 10. The resulting suspension was stirred for about 4 hours while maintaining the internal temperature at about 20-25°C. The resulting mixture was filtered, and the filter cake was washed with H2O (3 x 300 mL). The collected solid was dried to a constant weight at 50°C under vacuum in a vacuum oven providing 345.9 g (90.1%) of [6-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl]-acetic acid ethyl ester as a pale yellow powder. In an alternative work up procedure, the filtrates were combined and the ethanol was removed under vacuum until at least about 90% had been removed. Water at a neutral pH was then added to the resulting oil, and the solution was cooled to about 0°C. An aqueous 20% NaOH solution was then added slowly with rapid stirring to bring the pH up to 9.2 (read with pH meter). The resulting mixture was then filtered and dried as described above. The alternative work up procedure provided the light tan to light yellow product in yields as high as 97%.<br>

ester (120.7 grams) that had been previously worked up and dried to a water content of about 8-9% H20 was placed in a 2000 ml round bottom flask and dissolved in absolute ethanol (500 ml_). The amber solution was concentrated to a thick oil using a rotary evaporator with heating until all solvent was removed. The procedure was repeated two more times. The thick oil thus obtained was left in the flask and placed in a vacuum oven heated at 50°C overnight. Karl Fisher analysis results indicated a water content of 5.25%. The lowered water content obtained by this method provided increased yields in the procedure of Example 4. Other solvents such as toluene and THF may be used in place of the ethanol for this drying process.<br>

ester (250 g, 820 mmol) (dried with ethanol as described above) was dissolved in THF (3800 ml_) in a 5000 ml flask fitted with a condenser, mechanical stirrer, temperature probe, and purged with argon. 2-Amino-6-fluoro-benzonitrile (95.3 g, 700 mmol) was added to the solution, and the internal temperature was raised to 40°C. When all the solids had dissolved and the solution temperature had reached 40°C, solid KHMDS (376.2 g, 1890 mmol) was added over a period of 5 minutes. When addition of the potassium base was complete, a heterogeneous yellow solution was obtained, and the internal temperature had risen to 62°C. After a<br>
period of 60 minutes, the internal temperature decreased back to 40°C, and the reaction was determined to be complete by HPLC (no starting material or uncyclized intermediate was present). The thick reaction mixture was theri quenched by pouring it into H20 (6000 mL) and stirring the resulting mixture until it had reached room temperature. The mixture was then filtered, and the filter pad was washed with water (1000 ml 2X). The bright yellow solid was placed in a drying tray and dried in a vacuum oven at 50°C overnight providing 155.3 g (47.9%) of the desired 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-1 H-benzimidazol-2-yl]-1 H-quinolin-2-one.<br>
Procedure B<br>
[0150]         A 5000 ml 4-neck jacketed flask was equipped with a distillation apparatus, a temperature probe, a N2 gas inlet, an addition funnel, and a mechanical stirrer. [6-(4-Methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]-acetic acid ethyl ester (173.0 g, 570 mmol) was charged into the reactor, and the reactor was purged with N2 for 15 minutes. Dry THF (2600 mL) was then charged into the flask with stirring. After all the solid had dissolved, solvent was removed by distillation (vacuum or atmospheric (the higher temperature helps to remove the water) using heat as necessary. After 1000 mL of solvent had been removed, distillation was stopped and the reaction was purged with N2. 1000 mL of dry THF was then added • to the reaction vessel, and when all solid was dissolved, distillation (vacuum or atmospheric) Was again conducted until another 1000 mL of solvent had been removed. This process of adding dry THF and solvent removal was repeated at least 4 times (on the 4th distillation, 60% of the solvent is removed instead of just 40% as in the first 3 distillations) after which a 1 mL sample was removed for Karl Fischer analysis to determine water content. If the analysis showed that the sample contained less than 0.20% water, then reaction was continued as described in the next paragraph. However, if the analysis showed more than 0.20% water, then the drying process described above was continued until a water content of less than 0.20% was achieved.<br>
[0151]	After a water content of less than or about 0.20% was achieved using<br>
the procedure described in the previous paragraph, the distillation apparatus was<br>
replaced with a reflux condenser, and the reaction was charged with 2-amino-6-<br>
fluoro-benzonitrile (66.2 g, 470 mmol)( in some procedures 0.95 equivalents is used). The reaction was then heated to an internal temperature of 38-42°C. When the internal temperature had reached 38-42°C, KHMDS solution (1313 g, 1.32 mol, 20% KHMDS in THF) was added to the reaction via the addition funnel over a period of 5 minutes maintaining the internal temperature at about 38-50°C during the addition. When addition of the potassium base was complete, the reaction was stirred for 3.5 to 4.5 hours (in some examples it was stirred for 30 to 60 minutes and the reaction may be complete within that time) while maintaining the internal temperature at from 38r42°C. A sample of the reaction was then removed and analyzed by HPLC. If the reaction was not complete, additional KHMDS solution was added to the flask over a period of 5 minutes and the reaction was stirred at 38-42°C for 45-60 minutes (the amount of KHMDS solution added was determined by the following: If the IPC ratio is  20), the reactor was cooled to an internal temperature of 25-30°C, and water (350 ml) was charged into the reactor over a period of 15 minutes while maintaining the internal temperature at 25-35°C (in one alternative, the reaction is conducted at 40°C and water is added within 5 minutes. The quicker quench reduces the amount of impurity that forms over time). The reflux condenser was then replaced with a distillation apparatus and solvent was removed by distillation (vacuum or atmospheric) using heat as required. After 1500 ml of solvent had been removed, distillation was discontinued and the reaction was purged with N2. Water (1660 mL) was then added to the reaction flask while maintaining the internal temperature at 20-30°C. The reaction mixture was then stirred at 20-30°C for 30 minutes before cooling it to an internal temperature of 5-10°C and then stirring for 1 hour. The resulting suspension was filtered, and the flask and filter cake were washed with water (3 x 650 ml). The solid thus obtained was dried to a constant weight under vacuum at 50°C in a vacuum oven to provide<br>
103.9 g (42.6% yield) of 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]-1H-quinolin-2-one as a yellow powder.<br>

ester (608 g, 2.01 mol) (dried) and 2-amino-6-fluoro-benzonitrile (274 g, 2.01 mol) were charged into a 4-neck 12 L flask seated on a heating mantle and fitted with a condenser, mechanical stirrer, gas inlet, and temperature probe. The reaction vessel was purged with N2, and toluene (7.7 L) was charged into the reaction mixture while it was stirred. The reaction vessel was again purged with N2 and maintained under ISk. The internal temperature of the mixture was raised until a temperature of 63°C (+/- 3°C) was achieved. The internal temperature of the mixture was maintained at 63°C (+/- 3°C) while approximately 2.6 L of toluene was distilled from the flask under reduced pressure (380 +/-10 torr, distilling head t = 40°C (+/- 10°C) (Karl Fischer analysis was used to check the water content in the mixture. If the water content was greater than 0.03%, then another 2.6 L of toluene was added and distillation was repeated. This process was repeated until a water content of less than 0.03% was achieved). After a water content of less than 0.03% was reached, heating was discontinued, and the reaction was cooled under N2 to an internal temperature of 17-19°C. Potassium t-butoxide in THF (20% in THF; 3.39 kg, 6.04 moles potassium t-butoxide) was then added to the reaction under N2 at a rate such that the internal temperature of the reaction was kept below 20°C. After addition of the potassium t-butoxide was complete, the reaction was stirred at an internal temperature of less than 20°C for 30 minutes. The temperature was then raised to 25°C, and the reaction was stirred for at least 1 hour. The temperature was then raised to 30°C, and the reaction was stirred for at least 30 minutes. The reaction was then monitored for completion using HPLC to check for consumption of the starting materials (typically in 2-3 hours, both starting<br>
materials were consumed (less than 0.5% by area % HPLC)). If the reaction was not complete after 2 hours, another 0.05 equivalents of potassium t-butoxide was added at a time, and the process was completed until HPLC showed that the reaction was complete. After the reaction was complete, 650 mL of water was added to the stirred reaction mixture. The reaction was then warmed to an internal temperature of 50°C and the THF was distilled away (about 3 L by volume) under reduced pressure from the reaction mixture. Water (2.6 L) was then added drop wise to the reaction mixture using an addition funnel. The mixture was then cooled to room temperature and stirred for at least 1 hour. The mixture was then filtered, and the filter cake was washed with water (1.2 L), with 70% ethanol (1.2 L), and with 95% ethanol (1.2 L). The bright yellow solid was placed in a drying tray and dried in a vacuum oven at 50°C until a constant weight was obtained providing 674 g (85.4%) of the desired 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]-1 H-quinolin-2-one.<br>

In some cases an 8:1, solvent ratio is used. The suspension was then heated to a gentle reflux (temperature of about 76°C) with stirring over a period of about 1 hour. The reaction was then stirred for 45-75 minutes while refluxed. At this point, the heat was removed from the flask and the suspension was allowed to cool to a temperature of 25-30°C. The suspension was then filtered, and the filter pad was washed with water (2 x 500 ml). The yellow solid was then placed in a drying tray and dried in a vacuum oven at 50°C until a constant weight was obtained (typically 16 hours) to obtain 97.2 g (96.2%) of the purified product as a yellow powder.<br>

The reaction vessel was purged with Na for at least 1,5 minutes and then charged with 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]-1H-quinolin-2-one (484 g, 1.23 mol). A solution of D,L-Lactic acid (243.3 g, 1.72 mol of monomer-see the following paragraph), water (339 ml), and ethanol (1211 mL) was prepared and then charged to the reaction flask. Stirring was initiated at a medium rate, and the reaction was heated to an internal temperature of 68-72°C. The internal temperature of the reaction was maintained at 68-72°C for 15-45 minutes and then heating was discontinued. The resulting mixture was filtered through a 10-20 micron frit collecting the filtrate in a 12 L flask. The 12 L flask was equipped with an internal temperature probe, a reflux condenser, an addition funnel, a gas inlet an outlet, and an overhead stirrer. The filtrate was then stirred at a medium rate and heated to reflux (internal temperature of about 78°C). While maintaining a gentle reflux, ethanol (3,596 ml) was charged to the flask over a period of about 20 minutes. The reaction flask was then cooled to an internal temperature ranging from about 64-70°C within 15-25 minutes and this temperature was maintained for<br>
a period of about 30 minutes. The reactor was inspected for crystals. If no crystals<br>
were present, then crystals of the lactic acid salt of 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]-1H-quinolin-2-one (484 mg, 0.1 mole %) were added to the flask, and the reaction was stirred at 64-70°C for 30 minutes before again inspecting the flask for crystals.<br>
[0155]	Once crystals were present, stirring was reduced to a low rate and the<br>
reaction was stirred at 64-70°C for an additional 90 minutes. The reaction was then cooled to about 0°C over a period of about 2 hours, and the resulting mixture was filtered through a 25-50 micron fritted filter. The reactor was washed with ethanol (484 ml) and stirred until the internal temperature was about 0°C. The cold ethanol was used to wash the filter cake, and this procedure was repeated 2 more times. The collected solid was dried to a constant weight at 50°C under vacuum in a vacuum oven yielding 510.7 g (85.7%) of the crystalline yellow lactic acid salt of 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methyl-piperazin-1 -yl)-1 H-benzimidazol-2-yl]-1 H-quinolin-2-one. A rubber dam or inert conditions were typically used during the filtration process. While the dry solid did not appear to be very hygroscopic, the wet filter cake tends to pick up water and become sticky. Precautions were taken to avoid prolonged exposure of the wet filter cake to the atmosphere.<br>
[0156]	Commercial lactic acid generally contains about 8-12% w/w water,<br>
and contains dinners and trimers in addition to the monomeric lactic acid. The mole ratio of lactic acid dimer to monomer is generally about 1.0:4.7. Commercial grade lactic acid may be used in the process described in the preceding paragraph as the monolactate salt preferentially precipitates from the reaction mixture.<br>
