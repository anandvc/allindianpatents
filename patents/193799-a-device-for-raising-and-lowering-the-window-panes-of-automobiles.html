This invention relates to a device for raising and lowering the window panes of automobiles.<br>
The device is an electronic control system -for control ling power window systems in automobiles. It makes power window operation fully automatic and inc lodes safety -features for avoiding injury to passengers.<br>
The device proposed enables a window pane to be raised or lowered by momentarily touching the "up" switch or "down" switch.<br>
After momentarily touching the "up" or "down" switch, the motion of the window pane is automat¬ic . The window pane continues to move up or down. as the case may be, to the end of its travel at which point the motor is de-energized by a micro-controller.<br>
During the upward travel of the window pane if an obstacle„ such as the hand of a passenger, ob¬structs the motion (this is sensed by the micro-<br><br>
controller as a -force exerted on the pane) the pane stops and reverses motion, thus allowing the passenger to withdraw his hand and avoid injury.<br>
Various other features of this invention will be apparent from the following further description thereof.<br>
The device for raising and lowering the window panes of automobiles, according to this invention, comprises a reversible motor provided for drive means coupled to one window pane; at least two manually operable switches and at least one raicroswitch operable Uv the drive means; a micro-control leer activatable on operation of one or more of the said switches s an amplifier and comparator provided in the motor circuit for amplifying the motor current and comparing it with<br>
a preset voltage reference, the comparator acti¬vating the microcontraller whenever the motor current exceeds the preset voltage reference, said microcontraller,  in its activated  state,   <br><br>
Energising, de-penergising, reversing or dishing the reversal of, the motor to rat* the drive means to rise, lower, reverie or arrest the movciBpnt of, the said pant* or panting.<br>
This invention will now be described with preference to the accompanying drawings which illustrate, by may of example, one of various* possible pmbodiwBnta of the device proponed here¬in, wherein<br>
Fig- 1 illustrates the circuitry of the embodiment Fig. 1 illustrates the. layout of the major compo¬nent« of the embodiment  and<br>
Figs. 3 to 7 illustrate operational flow charts of the embodiment.<br>
In the embodiment  lustrated, the electronic module ironsmiths; of a microcontroller simultaneous-ly control 1 ing two windows. This two microtone stroller modules are required to control all four<br><br>
doors in a car. This arrangement is dictated by convenience since a microcontroller<br>
module can also be made to control one or more windows, if necessary.<br>
The microcontroller is compatible with the central locking system. A one touch button can be used to raise al1 the window panes in the car. This feature is useful while parking and locking the vehicle.<br>
The device is protected against electrostatic discharge at the input terminals and also against surges and transients in power supply.<br>
In the drawings UP1 and DN1 indicate the "up"	and<br>
"down" switches which are manually operable,	that<br>
is,  operable  by the passenger. for  raising	and<br>
lowering the window panes on the le-ft side o-f	the<br>
vehicle.  Similarly, UP 2 and DN2 srs   the "up"	and<br>
"down"  switches  for the right side door  of	the<br>
vehicle.<br>
A third manually operable switch is CLS.  This  is<br><br>
operable by the driver for raising all the	window<br>
panes (on the left as wel1 as on the right	side of<br>
the vehicle)- This input can also be	coupled<br>
directly to the central locking system.<br>
The manually operable switches wi11 preferably be of the pushbutton type.<br>
USl and US2 are micraswitches which are operable by the drive mechanisms coupled to the window panes on the left side and on the right Bide of the vehicle, respectively.<br>
The embodiment illustrated will now be described in further detai1 mainly with regard to the left side of the vehicle. The same description wil1 be applicable to the right side of the vehicle also.<br>
A reversible motor Ml such as a dc motor is pro¬vided for the drive means coupled to window panes on the left side of the vehicle for raising and lowering the panes depending upon the direction of rotation of the motor.<br><br>
Two manual 1v operable 
by the drive means connected to a microcon--stroller MC. The microcontroller is activatable on operation of one or more of the said switches,<br>
An amplifier and comparator Al provided in the motor circuit amplifies the motor current carried by the cupro-nickel alloy wire shunt SI and com¬pares it with a preset voltage reference, the comparator activating the microcontroller whenever the motor current exceeds the preset voltage reference.<br>
It is noteworthy that the device is current, sensi¬tive. The motor current is a direct indication of the force against which the window panes move. Thus any load on the motor Ml larger than what is normal ly encountered -for moving the window panes up and down (e.g. when the hand of a passenger obstructs the upward movement of a window pane) draws a correspondingly larger motor current  than<br><br>
normal and if this current exceeds the preset reference, the comparator output is a signal 1 activating the microcontroller, in the manner hereinafter described.<br>
The said microcontroller, in its activated state, is programmed to energise, de-energise, reverse or disable the revereal of„ the motor to cause the drive means to raise, lower. reverse or arrest the movement of, the ©aid pane or panes. This is explained hereunder with reference to the embodi¬ment i1 lustrated -<br>
The motor circuit includes a dual relay system comprising the relay driver Dl and the relays Rl with energising coils RC11 RC12. By energising coi1 RC11 the motor rotates in one direction j by energising coil RC12, the motor rotates in the other direction. If neither coil is energised, the motor is off. The microcontroller MC is thus enabled to run the motor Ml in either direction or to switch it off  depending upon its activation.<br><br>
The microswitches US1 and UB2 are switched on whenever the window panes reach a predetermined point in their upward travel, say, 1/4 to 1 inch ■from the end of upward travel of each pane. When the microswitch US1 or US2 is switched on, it activates the microcontroller which disables the reversing -function of the microcontroller beyond this point.<br>
The flow charts illustrated in Figs.3 to 7 indi¬cate the sequence of operations and &amp;re self-explanatory.<br>
As  soon as the device is switched on,  it  enters the "start" state.  The microcontroller then performs  a  power -on -se 1 f test 
If the UP1 switch is now operated <pressed> by a passenger, the microcontroller energizes the motor in  the  appropriate direction so as to  move  the<br><br>
window panes upwards on the left side of the vehicle.   After  a  delay   of  600  ms   the microcontroller   checks  for a DN1  switch  press (operation )  and if this switch is operated,  the motor direction is reversed by the microcon trol1er and the window pane is lowered.<br>
If the USI switch is operated by the window pane drive means and at the same time if the motor current is higher than the preset reference, motor Ml is de-energised, hence stopping the window pane at the end of its travel.<br>
If the window pane* on the left side are* moving up and the switch US1 is not depressed (not operated) and the motor current is higher than the preset reference, the microcontroller reverses the motor direction for a period of 620 ms and then de-energizes the motor.<br>
If the window panes on the left side are moving up and  the UP1 switch is pressed (operated) for  the<br><br>
second time, the microcontroller de-energises the motor. Similarly, if the DN1 switch is pressed for the second time after the window panes start moving downwards, the motor is de-energised.<br>
As already stated above, what has been stated with respect to the left side door of the vehicle is applicable at the right side door of the vehicle.<br>
At the end of the loop  see flow charts) the microcontroller checks if the Cuts key is pressed (operated). If this is so, the microcontroller energises both left side and right side motors Ml and M2 to raise al1 windows. The control is passed back the beginning of the lap as shown in the flow charts and the entire process is repeated again.<br>
The circuit incorporates an input buffer stage to isolate the microcontroller for protection against electrostatic  discharge.   The  circuit  is  also protected  against  over voltage  conditions,  high voltage transients and battery reversal.<br><br>
