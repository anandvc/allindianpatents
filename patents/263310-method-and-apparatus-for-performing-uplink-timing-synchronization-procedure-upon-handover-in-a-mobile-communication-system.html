METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR PERFORMING UPLINK TIMING SYNCHRONIZATION PROCEDURE UPON HANDOVER IN A MOBILE<br>
COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
5	BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention generally relates to handover implementation in a<br>
mobile communication system. More particularly, the present invention relates to<br>
10       a method  and  apparatus  for performing  an uplink timing synchronization<br>
procedure (UL timing sync procedure) in a User Equipment (UE), upon handover<br>
to a target cell.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
15	Multiple access schemes are used in wireless communication systems.<br>
Among the principal multiple access schemes are Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), and Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM). OFDM is a special case of MultiCarrier Modulation (MCM) in which a serial symbol sequence is converted to parallel<br>
20 symbol sequences and modulated to multiple orthogonal subcarriers (or subcarrier channels), prior to transmission.<br>
As a substitute for a 3G mobile communication standard, Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS),a 3rd Generation Partnership Project 25        (3GPP) Long Term Evolution (LTE),  a major OFDM system, is a future-generation   mobile   communication   system  under   discussion  in  the   3GPP. standardization body"<br>
FIG 1 illustrates the configuration of a 3 GPP LTE system. 30<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, a UE 110 is a 3GPP LTE terminal. An Evolved-Radio<br>
Access Network (E-RAN) 140 performs the functionalities of a Node B and a<br>
Radio Network Controller (RNC) of the conventional 3GPP system. Node B is a<br>
radio device that directly participates in communications with a UE and manages<br>
35        cells. The RtSFC controls a plurality of Node Bs and radio resources.<br><br>
WO 2007/091866<br><br>
PCT/KR2007/000722<br><br>
-2-<br>
As with the conventional 3GPP system where Node B and RNC are configured as separate nodes, E-RAN 140 can be configured as separate physical nodes, Evolved-Node B (E-Node B or E-NB) 120 and Evotved-RNC (E-RNC) 130, or can merge E-NB 120 and E-RNC 130 therein. E-NB 120 and E-RNC 130 5 are physically merged into the E-RAN 140. Yet, the following description also holds true in the former case.<br>
An Evolved-Core Network (E-CN) 350 can be a node combining a Serving General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) Support Node (SGSN) and a 10 Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) of the conventional 3GPP system. E-CN 150, which is located between a Packet Data Network (PDN) 160 and E-RAN 140 allocates an Internet Protocol (IP) address to UE 110 and functions as a gateway that connects UE 110 to PDN 160.<br>
15	FIG. 2 is a UL timing sync procedure in the 3 GPP LTE system.<br>
Referring to FIG 2, a first UE (UE 1) is relatively near an E-NB and a second UE (UE 2) is relatively remote from the E-NB.<br>
20	T_prol denotes the propagation delay time of radio transmission from the<br>
E-NB to UE I, and T_pro2 denotes the propagation delay time of radio transmission from the E-NB to UE 2. Because UE 1 is nearer the E-NB than UE 2, T_prol is shorter than T_pro2. In the illustrated case of FIG. 2, it is assumed that T_prol and T_pro2 are 0.333us and 3.33Î¼s, respectively.<br>
25<br>
When UE 1 and UE 2 are at different distances from the E-NB but within the cell of the E-NB and UE 1 and UE 2 are powered-on or placed in idle mode, there may be a mismatch among the uplink timing of UE 1, the uplink timing of UE 2, and the uplink timings of UEs within the cell that the E-NB detects.<br>
30 UL@UE# 1 201 denotes the uplink transmission timing of an OFDM symbol from UE 1, and UL@UE#2 202 denotes the uplink transmission timing of an OFDM symbol from UE 2. A timing gap or delay exists between UL@UE#1 and UL@UE#2.<br>
35	The E-NB receives the OFDM symbols UL Framet@EN-B. at timings<br><br>
WO 2007/091866<br><br>
PCT/KR2007/000722<br><br>
-3-<br>
212 and 213, with the propagation time delays of uplink transmission from UE 1 and UE 2 as shown. Specifically, the uplink symbol transmitted at the uplink timing UL@UE#1 from UE 1 arrives at E-NB at the timing UL Frame@E-NB 212 and an uplink symbol transmitted at the uplink timing UL@UE#2 from UE 2 5 arrives at E-NB at the timing UL Frame@E-NB 213. Since UE 1 and UE 2 are not yet synchronized, the timing of starting to decode uplink OFDM symbols, UL Frame@E-KB 211 in the E-NB, the timing of receiving the OFDM symbol from UE 1, UL Frame@E-NB 212, and the timing of receiving the OFDM symbol from UE 2, UL Frame@E-NB 213 are not aligned. Orthogonality is not 10 kept between the uplink symbols from UE 1 and UE2, resulting in mutual interference. The interference and timing discrepancies make it difficult for the E-NB to successfully decode the uplink symbols received from UE 1 and UE 2.<br>
UL timing synchronization is a process of synchronizing uplink timings 15 among UE 1, UE 2 and.E-NB. Therefore, when the UL timing synchronization is acquired, the decoding timing, the reception timing from UE 1, and the reception timing from UE 2 are all aligned, as denoted by reference numerals 215, 216 and 217. Thus, the E-NB can succeed in decoding the uplink symbols received from UElandUE2. 20<br>
A description will be made below of a UL timing sync procedure among a UE in active mode, a source E-NB that controls a source cell before handover, and a target E-NB that controls a target cell in the LIE system.<br>
25	Active mode is a mode in which a Radio Resource Control (RRC)<br>
connection is kept between a UE and an E-NB. The E-NB can transmit and receive service data to and from the UE as well as signaling for the UE in the active mode. The UE transmits and receives data to and from the E-NB using time resources and radio resources (e.g. frequency) allocated by scheduling<br>
30 information from the E-NB. Handover is a process of enabling the UE to continue receiving on-going dedicated data/signaling when it moves from one cell to another in the active mode.<br>
FIG 3 is a signal flow diagram for a UL timing sync procedure among 35        aUE in active mode, a source E-NB, and a target E-NB, upon handover.<br><br>
WO 2007/091866<br><br>
PCT/KR2007/000722<br><br>
-4-<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, a UE 301 located in a source cell under control of a source E-NB 302 sends a MEASUREMENT REPORT message to the source E-NB 302 in step 311. The source cell is a cell in which UE 301 is located and which serves UE 301 before handover, and source E-NB 302 controls the source 5 cell. A target cell is a cell to which UE 301 is to move by handover, and a target E-NB 303 controls the target cell. The MEASUREMENT REPORT message notifies the network of radio measurements about the serving cell and neighbor cells to support handover.<br>
10	By the MEASUREMENT REPORT, UE 301 informs source E-NB 302<br>
that a neighboring cell (i.e. a target cell) in a better radio channel environment than the serving cell .(i.e. the source cell) has been discovered. Source E-NB 302 then decides to hand UE 301 over to the target cell based on the information included in the MEASUREMENT REPORT message.<br>
15<br>
In step 313, a handover procedure is performed between source E-NB 302 and target E-NB 303 to support the handover from the source cell to the target cell. The handover procedure may involve reservation of radio resources for UE 301 in the target cell, allocation of a UE Identification (ED) for use in the<br>
20 target cell, forwarding of a UE context and a service context associated with UE 301 from source E-NB 302 to target E-NB 303, and setup of a data transmission path between source E-NB 302 and target E-NB 303.<br>
When the network has completely prepared for the handover, source E-<br>
25        NB 302 sends a HANDOVER COMMAND message to UE 301, commanding<br>
UE 301 to move to the target cell in step 315. The HANDOVER COMMAND<br>
message may provide UE 301 with information about the configuration of a radio<br>
channel to be used in the target cell.<br>
30	Upon receipt of the HANDOVER COMMAND message, UE 301 selects<br>
a preamble code for use in a UL timing sync procedure with the target cell in step 321. The preamble code is a bit sequence of a predetermined pattern. Preamble code patterns are preset between UE 301 and target E-NB 303 for use in the UL timing sync procedure. UE 301 selects one of the preamble code patterns.<br><br>
WO 2007/091866<br><br>
PCT/KR2007/000722<br><br>
-5-<br>
UE 301 sends a UL SYNC REQ message including the selected preamble code to target E-NB 303 in step 323. Target E-NB 303 can find out by the preamble code how far the uplink transmission timing of UE 301 is from the uplink reception timing of target E-NB 303. Hence, target E-NB 303 calculates 5 riming adjustment information (referred to as timing adjustment info) to match the uplink transmission timing of UE 301 to the uplink reception timing of target E-NB 303.<br>
In step 325, target E-NB 303 replies to UE 301 with a UL SYNC RES<br>
10        message on the downlink. The UL SYNC RES message includes the timing<br>
adjustment info and a preamble code ID. The preamble code ID identifies that the<br>
UL SYNC RES message is a response for the UL SYNC REQ message sent from<br>
UE301.<br>
15	UE 301  adjusts the uplink transmission timing based on the timing<br>
adjustment info included in the UL SYNC RES message in step 331 and sends a UL SYNC REQ message including a preamble code to the target E-NB 303 in step-333. This preamble code may have a different pattern from that of the preamble code sent in step 323.<br>
20<br>
In step 335, the target E-NB 303 replies with a UL SYNC RES message including timing adjustment info and a preamble code ID.<br>
The procedure for adjusting the uplink transmission timing of UE 301 by 25        transmitting and receiving preamble codes between UE 301 and target E-NB 303 can be repeated until UE 301 acquires the UL timing synchronization.<br>
Upon acquisition of the UL timing synchronization, in other words, if the timing adjustment info included in the UL SYNC RES message in step 335 is 30 made inactive (e,g. 0), UE 301 can send uplink signaling/data to target E-NB 303 in step 341. For example, a HANDOVER COMPLETE message can be sent to target E-NB 303, notifying successful completion of the handover to the target cell in step 341.<br>
As described above with reference to FIG. 3, the UL tirning sync 35        procedure performed in the target cell upon handover to the target cell creates<br><br>
WO 2007/091866<br><br>
PCT/KR2007/000722<br><br>
-6-<br>
uplmk/downlink signaling overhead and causes a service delay until the UE starts to send uplink signaling/data in the target cell in the conventional mobile communication system.<br>

PCT/KR2007/000722<br><br>

Preferred embodiments of the present invention provide a handover procedure that minimizes the time delay involved in a UL timing sync procedure performed in a target cell, upon handover. While the following description is made in the context of an OFDM system based on UMTS, 3GPP LIE, it is to be 5 appreciated that the present invention is applicable to other mobile communication systems with a similar technological background and channel configuration.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, in active mode, a UE 401 sends a MEASUREMENT 10 REPORT message including radio measurements about a source cell and neighboring cells to a source E-NB 402 that controls the source cell in step 411. For example, upon detection of at least one neighboring cell in a better radio channel environment than the source cell, UE 401 sends radio measurements about the source cell and the neighboring cell in the MEASUREMENT REPORT 15 message. For another example, UE 401 informs source E-NB 402 that a neighboring cell (i.e. a target cell) in a better radio channel environment than the source cell has been discovered by the MEASUREMENT message.<br>
E-NB 402 then decides to hand UE 301 over to the target cell being one 20 of neighboring cells included in the MEASUREMENT REPORT message and a handover procedure is performed between the source cell and the target cell. The handover procedure may involve reservation of radio resources to be used for UE 401 in the target cell, allocation of a UE ID to be used in the target cell, forwarding of a UE context and a service context associated with UE 401 from 25 source E-NB 402 to a target E-NB, and setup of a data transmission path between source E-NB 402 to the target E-NB.<br>
When  the  handover procedure  is  completed,  E-NB   402   sends   a<br>
HANDOVER COMMAND message to UE 401, commanding UE 401 to move to<br>
30       the target cell in step 413. The HANDOVER COMMAND message may provide<br>
UE 401 with information about the configuration of a radio channel to be used in<br>
the target cell and other handover information.<br>
Especially the HANDOVER COMMAND message includes an indicator 35        indicating "no need for UL timing sync procedure" in the target cell. The message<br><br>
WO 2007/091866<br><br>
PCT7KR2007/000722<br><br>
-10-<br>
"no need for UL timing sync procedure" is sent to UE 401 by setting the explicit indicator in the HANDOVER COMMAND message or by the HANDOVER COMMAND message in an implicit rule.<br>
5	In the  absence of the indicator in the HANDOVER COMMAND<br>
message, UE 401 performs the UL timing sync procedure with the target cell in the manner described in FIG. 4. If the timings of the source cell and the target cell are identical or almost identical, the UL timing sync procedure before initial transmission of uplink signaling/data from UE 401 in the target cell increases<br>
10 service delay and causes unnecessary uplink/downlink signaling overhead. To avert these problems, E-NB 402 determines whether UE 401 needs to perform the XJL timing sync procedtire with the target cell, when it decides to handover UE 401 to the target cell. If the UL timing sync procedure is not required, E-NB 402 includes the indicator in the HANDOVER COMMAND message.<br>
15<br>
In the following scenarios, the UL timing sync procedure with the target cell is not required after handover.<br>
1)	The target cell and the source cell are managed by the same E-NB (i.e.<br>
20        inter-E-NB handover) and thus the E-NB receives uplink symbols from the source<br>
cell and the target cell at the same timing.<br>
2)	Even though the source cell and the target cell are managed by<br>
different E-NBs, the uplink reception timings from the source cell and the target<br>
25        cell are virtually identical as their difference is below a predetermined threshold.<br>
In the above scenarios, E-NB 402 sends the indicator to UE 401, notifying that the UL timing sync procedure is not required in the target cell, upon handover to the target cell in active mode. 30<br>
In step 421, UE 401 does not perform the UL timing sync procedure in<br>
the target cell according to the indicator, considering that the uplink timing in the<br>
source cell can be maintained also in the target cell. "Without the unnecessary UL<br>
riming sync procedure, therefore, an unnecessary service delay is reduced and<br>
35        signaling overhead and/or radio resource consumption are avoided.<br><br>
WO 2007/091866<br><br>
PCT7KR2007/000722<br><br>
-11-<br>
As an example of explicitly indicating that the UL timing sync procedure<br>
is not needed, E-NB 402 includes a one-bit indicator indicating "no need for UL<br>
timing sync procedure" in the HANDOVER COMMAKD message in step 413.<br>
When detecting the indicator from the HANDOVER COMMAND message, the<br>
5	UE determines not to perform the UL timing sync procedure in the target cell.<br>
Alternatively, E-NB 402 instructs UE 402 not to perform the UL timing sync procedure upon handover by an implicit rule rather than by the HANDOVER COMMAND  message with explicit information such as the<br>
10 indicator. An example of the implicit rule is to use system information broadcast within a cell. When UE 401 finds out from system information broadcast from the source cell that the target cell indicated by the HANDOVER COMMAND message and the source cell are under control of the same E-NB, it determines to maintain the uplink timing of the source cell in the target cell rather than to<br>
15        perform the UL timing sync procedure.<br>
Another example of the implicit rule is to use the radio channel configuration information typically included in the HANDOVER COMMAND message. The HANDOVER COMMAND message contains parameters by which<br>
20 UE 401 performs the UL timing sync procedure in the target cell. The parameters can be an initial uplink transmission timing in the target cell, an uplink timing difference between the source cell and the target cell, a preamble code, and information about the configuration of a radio channel to deliver the preamble code, for use in the UL timing sync procedure in the target cell.<br>
25<br>
If these parameters are included in the HANDOVER COMMAND message, UE 401 performs the UL timing sync procedure using the parameters. On the other hand, if the HANDOVER COMMAND message does not include the parameters, UE 401 determines to maintain the uplink timing of the source<br>
30 cell in the target cell rather than to perform the UL timing sync procedure in the target cell.<br>
A third example of the implicit rule is to use a particular one of the<br>
parameters associated with the UL timing sync procedure included in the<br>
35        HANDOVER COMMAND message. For example, if the uplink timing difference<br><br>
WO 2007/091866<br><br>
PCT7KR2007/000722<br><br>
-12-	-        "<br>
between the source cell and the target cell is included in the HANDOVER COMMAND message and is set to a predetermined value (e.g. 0), UE 401 determines to maintain the uplink timing of the source cell in the target cell rather than to perform the UL timing sync procedure in the target cell. 5<br>
If UE 401 determines to maintain the uplink timing of the source cell in the target cell in step 421, it sends uplink signaling/data to the target cell at the uplink timing of the. source cell, after the handover to the target cell in step 423. The uplink signaling/data, which can be a HANDOVER COMPLETE message<br>
10 indicating successful completion of the handover to the network. In the illustrated case of FIG. 4, the source cell and the target cell are under the same E-NB 402. Hence, E-KB 402 delivers the uplink signaling/data to the target cell. The uplink timing means system time information used for communications between UE 401 and the source cell, such as a system frame number.<br>
15<br>
The following description is made with the appreciation that whether the UL timing sync procedure with the target cell is required is indicated to the UE by explicit signaling; it is obvious that the present invention can also be implemented by other explicit methods or implicit rules.<br>
20<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, UE 401 receives a HANDOVER COMMAND message indicating handover to the target cell from E-NB 402 in step 501 and checks whether an indicator indicating "no need for UL timing sync procedure" is included in the HANDOVER COMMAND message in step 511. In the presence<br>
25 of the indicator, UE 401 maintains the uplink tirning of the source cell without a UL timing sync procedure in the target cell in step 531 and sends uplink signaling/data to the target cell at the uplink tirning of the source cell after the handover in step 533.<br>
30	In  the  absence  of the  indicator,  UE  401   acquires  uplink timing<br>
synchronization to the target cell by the UL timing sync procedure in step 521 and sends uplink signaling/data to the target cell at the uplink timing of the source cell after the handover in step 533. .<br>
35	Referring to FIG. 6, a UL sync acquirer 601 is activated or deactivated<br><br>
WO 2007/091866<br><br>
PCT/KR2007/000722<br><br>
-13-<br>
under the control of a UL sync controller 621. When the UL sync controller 621 decides that the UL timing sync procedure is not needed, the UL sync acquirer 691 does not perform the UL timing sync procedure. On the contrary, if UL sync controller 621 decides that the UL timing sync procedure is needed, UL sync 5 acquirer 601 performs the UL timing sync procedure using parameters associated with the UL timing sync procedure, including a preamble code set by UL sync controller 621.<br>
UL sync controller 621 makes a decision as to whether the UL timing 10 sync procedure is required in the target cell depending on whether a HANDOVER COMMAND message received from E-NB 402 through a control message transceiver 611 includes an indicator indicating "no need for UL timing sync procedure". Specifically upon receipt "of the HANDOVER COMMAND message from E-NB 402 at the control message transceiver 611, UL sync 15 controller 621 determines whether the HANDOVER COMMAND message includes the indicator.<br>
In the presence of the indicator, UL sync controller 621 controls UL sync<br>
acquirer 601 not to perform the UL timing sync procedure with the target cell. In<br>
the absence of the indicator, UL sync controller 621 provides parameters<br>
20        associated with the UL timing sync procedure to UL sync acquirer 601 and<br>
controls the UL sync acquirer 601 to perform the UL timing sync procedure.<br>
Control message transceiver 611 sends uplink signaling/data, particularly a HANDOVER COMPLETE message at an uplink timing that the UL sync 25        acquirer 601 tells E-NB 402.<br>
Referring to FIG. 7, after receiving a MEASUREMENT REPORT message from UE 401, E-NB 402 starts a handover procedure in step 701. It can be further contemplated as another preferred embodiment of the present invention that the handover procedure is triggered by a factor such as the load balance of 30 the network, other than the reception of the MEASUREMENT REPORT message from UE 401.<br>
In step 711, E-NB 402 determines whether UE 401 needs to perform the<br>
UL-timing sync procedure with the target cell, i.e. whether UE 401 has to adjust<br>
35        its uplink timing for communications with the target cell by the UL timing sync<br><br>
WO 2007/091866<br><br>
PCT/KR2007/000722<br><br>
-14-<br>
procedure or has to maintain the uplink timing of the source cell in the target cell without the UL timing sync procedure.<br>
Determining that the UL timing sync procedure is not required, E-NB 402<br>
5        includes an indicator indicating "no need for UL timing sync procedure" in a<br>
HANDOVER COMMAND message in step 721 and sets handover information in<br>
the HANDOVER COMMAND message in step 723. In step 725, E-NB 402<br>
sends the HANDOVER COMMAND message to UE 401.<br>
10	On the other hand, if detennining that the UL timing sync procedure is to<br>
be performed in the target cell, E-NB 402 skips step 721 and includes sets handover information in the HANDOVER COMMAND message without the indicator in step 723. In step 725, E-NB 402 sends the HANDOVER COMMAND message to UE 401.<br>
15<br>
Referring to FIG 8, a handover decider and controller 801 is responsible for deciding or controlling handover for the UE. A UL sync decider 821 determines whether the UE needs to perform the UL timing sync procedure in the target cell, when handover to the target cell is decided. Specifically, UL sync<br>
20 decider 821 determines that the UL timing sync procedure is not required in the target cell, in the case where the target cell and the source cell are under the same E-NB or the uplink timings of the source cell and the target cell are virtually identical.<br>
25	Handover decider and controller 801 sets handover-related parameters in<br>
a HANDOVER COMMAND message, and includes or does not include an indicator indicating "no need for UL timing sync procedure1" in the HANDOVER COMMAKD message depending on the decision result of UL sync decider 821. A control message transceiver 811 sends the HANDOVER COMMAND message to<br>
30 the UE, and sends a response message, if the UE has requested uplink synchronization. If the source cell and the target cell are under the same E-NB, control message transceiver 811 receives a HANDOVER COMPLETE message from the UE in response to the HANDOVER COMMAND message.<br>
As is apparent from the above description, a UE is instructed not to<br>
35        perform an unnecessary UL timing sync procedure upon handover in the present<br><br>
WO 2007/091866<br><br>
PCT/KR2007/000722<br><br>
-15-<br>
invention. Therefore, unnecessary uplink/dovralink signaling overhead after handover is prevented and a service delay until a UE starts to send uplink signaling/data is reduced.<br>

certain preferred embodiments, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as further defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.<br><br>
