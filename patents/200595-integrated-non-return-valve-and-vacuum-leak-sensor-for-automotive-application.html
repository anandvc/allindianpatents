Integrated Non Return Valve and Vacuum Leak Sensor for<br>
Automotive Application<br>
Field of Invention<br>
This invention in general relates to automobile industry. More particularly this invention relates to integrated Non-Return Valve and Vacuum Leak Sensor for automobile brake application.<br>
Prior Art Disclosure<br>
A Non Retum Valve is an unit, which allows flow of fluid only in one direction. To ensure the presence of vacuum, a Non Retum Valve is generally fixed in a booster unit. This prevents air from entering inside the booster.<br>
A Vacuum Leak Sensor is an unit, which senses a drop in vacuum level. During a vacuum leak in the booster unit, to provide a warning indication to the driver, a Vacuum Leak Sensor is used.<br>
Vacuum Leak Sensor as known in the art and which is available today, as a separate unit, is connected either in the line between the vacuum source and the booster assembly or in the booster assembly itself. The instant invention integrates the Vacuum Leak-Sensing feature in the Non-Retum Valve assembly itself.<br>
It is well known in the art that vacuum booster assembly is an unit designed to provide power assistance to the effort applied by the driver on the brake pedal. The booster assembly provides assistance by differential pressure concept. Vacuum created in the engine inlet manifold (in case of petrol engine) or vacuum pump (in case of diesel engine) is sent to the rear chamber and front chamber. A mbber diaphragm and a diaphragm plate separate these two chambers. There are various parts on either side of the<br><br>
diaphragm, which are not explained here in detail, since they are not directly related to the invention. Vacuum is applied to both sides of the diaphragm through the Non Return Valve. During a brake application, atmospheric air is admitted to collapse the vacuum on the rear chamber, thereby a differential pressure is created between the chambers and thus power assistance is obtained. Should a drop occur in the vacuum level in the front chamber, or in the Non Return Valve or in the line connecting the booster assembly and the vacuum source, the power assistance will drop down. Hence a Vacuum Leak Sensor is required to indicate that there is a drop in vacuum. The device according to the invention will signal the driver about the deficiency.<br>
Accordingly what is needed in the art is an improvement that overcomes the above mentioned deficiency of the prior art.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTiON OF AN EMBODIMENT OF INVENTION<br>
The device consists of two major components:-<br><br>
1.	A Non Return Valve (NRV) Assembly<br>
Non Return Valve consists of a housing (1) and a flap valve (2) as shown in Fig.3. The vacuum flow direction is shown in the Fig. 3 The flap valve (2) prevents air from entering inside the booster, thereby ensuring the existence of vacuum for assistance during brake application. The vacuum is collapsed during brake application to effectively assist / boost the driver's input brake pedal force.<br>
2.	A Vacuum Leak Sensor (VLS) Assembly<br>
Vacuum Leak Sensor consists of a Base (3), an 0-Ring (4), a flexible disc (5) with contact a button (6). a spring (7). a spring guide (8), two terminals (9), and an outer cover (10). When vacuum is present in the booster, the flexible disc (5) is pulled down due to the presence of the vacuum and hence there is no contact between the two terminals (9). During vacuum leak in the front chamber (12) - (Shown in Fig.1), the flexible disc (5) is pushed up due to the spring (7) and the contact button (6) comes in contact with both the terminals (9) and thus continuity is established between the two terminals (9), thereby giving an electrical indication. The indication can be visual or audible based on customer requirement.<br>
The booster assembly, shown in Fig.1, is an unit designed to provide power assistance to the effort applied by the driver on the brake pedal. The booster assembly provides assistance by differential pressure concept. Vacuum created in the engine inlet manifold (in case of petrol engine) or vacuum pump (in case of diesel engine) is sent to the rear chamber (11) and front chamber (12). A rubber diaphragm (13) and a diaphragm plate (14) separate these two chambers. There are various parts on either side of the diaphragm, which are not explained here in detail, since they are not directly related to the invention. Vacuum is applied to both sides of the diaphragm through the Non Return Valve (15). During a brake application, atmospheric air is admitted to collapse the vacuum on the rear chamber (11), differential<br><br>
pressure is created between both the chambers (11 &amp; 12) and thus power assistance is obtained. Should a drop occur in the vacuum level in the front chamber (12). or in the Non Retum Valve or in the line connecting the booster assembly and the vacuum source or in the source itself, the power assistance will drop down. Hence a Vacuum Leak Sensor is required to indicate that there is a drop in vacuum.<br>
When the brake is applied, the vacuum maintained in the rear chamber (11), Is collapsed to create the differential pressure. For the booster assembly to effectively function and provide power assistance during the braking cycle, presence of required vacuum is very important. The Non Retum Valve is either fixed in the booster assembly or in the line between vacuum source and the booster assembly and maintains the vacuum level in the chambers. This prevents air from entering inside the booster assembly. To provide a warning indication to the driver, during a vacuum leak in the booster, a Vacuum Leak Sensor feature is integrated with the Non Retum Valve. The booster assembly with the integrated Non Return Valve and Vacuum Leak Sensor (16) device is shown in Fig.2.<br>
The objective of the invented device is to provide a safe braking system using a vacuum assisted booster and additionally signals the leakage of vacuum to the driver. The said device, shown in Fig.3, according to the invention is a Non-Return Valve integrated with the features of a Vacuum Leak Sensor for a Vacuum assisted booster assembly. A flap valve (2) assembled in the housing (1), ensures that vacuum is always retained in the booster assembly which is used during the brake application. Though it is not confined to a particular location within the housing, it is generally positioned below the Vacuum Leak Sensor. The flap valve (2) does not allow air at atmospheric pressure or more to enter into the booster assembly. In case there is a leak, it has to be indicated to the driver, so that the driver can take care of pedal load during further brake applications. This indication is done by<br><br>
the Vacuum Leak Sensor assembly, which consists of a base (3), an 0-Ring (4), a flexible disc (5) with a contact button (6), a spring (7), a spring guide (8), two terminals (9), and an outer cover (10). When vacuum is present in the booster, the flexible disc (5) is pulled down due to the presence of the vacuum and hence there is no contact between the two terminals (9). If there is a vacuum leak, the flexible disc (5) is pushed up due to the spring (7) and the contact button (6) presses against both the terminals (9) and thus continuity is established between the two terminals (9), thereby giving an electrical indication. Any type of output can be connected to the terminals (9) for leak indication - Either Visual or audible.<br>
The Vacuum Leak Sensor spring (7) is designed to offer a load to the flexible disc (5) to attain contact between the two terminals (9), till the cut-off vacuum level is reached. (Below which, is considered as leak or collapse of vacuum). The fitted load of the spring (7) can be modified suitably to have indication at any desired Vacuum level.<br>
The critical components in this assembly are the flap valve, flexible disc with contact button and the spring. If the flap valve fails, there will be a leak in the vacuum level. If the deflection of the flexible disc varies or the spring deflection varies, then the vacuum level at which the driver gets the waming will vary.<br>
ADVANTAGES OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention is primarily intended as a safety measure for the driver to indicate the leakage of vacuum, which will enable the driver to take appropriate action. The driver will have the foreknowledge that he has to apply more pedal load to get the required pressure. Further the vacuum leak indication will demand the service of the required parts.<br><br>
The invention has been explained in relation to specific embodiment. It is inferred that the foregoing description is only illustrative of the present invention and it is not intended that the invention be limited or restrictive thereto. Many other specific embodiments of the present invention will be apparent to one skilled in the art from the foregoing disclosure. All substitution, alterations and modification of the present invention, which come within the scope of the following claims are to which the present invention is readily susceptible without departing from the spirit of the invention.<br>
The scope of the invention should therefore be determined not with reference to the above description but should be determined with reference to appended claims along with full scope of equivalents to which such claims are entitled.<br><br><br><br>
