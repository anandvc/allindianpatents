				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a fine-particle, bright, and highly opaque rutile-based pigment without<br>
the addition of impurities by reactive metal components and to a method for the production of<br>
such pigments.<br>
Nickel antimony titanium yellow pigments are by nature pale yellow pigments with high opacity.<br>
Overdyeing with high quality organic pigments makes it possible to obtain highly saturated full-<br>
tone colors with which the entire color spectrum can be covered, with the exception of blue and<br>
violet hues. This overcoloring results in a synergy between the relatively high opacity of the<br>
cost-effective nickel antimony titanium yellow and the great color intensity of the organic<br>
overcoloring pigments, which are generally quite expensive.<br>
This effect can also be obtained using titanium white; however, overcoloring always leads to<br>
greater brightening, that is, to less saturation, due to the high whitening power of titanium white<br>
pigments. Another disadvantage of titanium white overcoloring is the photocatalytic effect of<br>
titanium white pigments, which leads to a sharp decrease in the light-fastness and weather-<br>
fastness of the expensive organic color components. Consequently, full hues based on titanium<br>
white "age" some four-times faster than mixtures of the same organic color components with<br>
nickel antimony titanium yellow.<br>
In the past, this decisive use of nickel antimony titanium yellow was seldom used because the<br>
nickel titanium pigments currently available on the market are abrasive (grain-hard and sharp-<br>
edged), have poor gloss, and are inferior in terms of covering capacity compared to titanium<br>
white. Moreover, the following economic background should be considered:<br>
Nickel antimony titanium yellows account for relatively small market shares among titanium<br>
pigments, as the following figures demonstrate: titanium white world market: 4,000,0001,<br>
titanium yellow world market: 20,000 t, of which chromium antimony titanium yellow: 16,000<br>
t, of which nickel antimony titanium yellow: 4,000 t.<br><br>
The annual tonnage of chromium antimony titanium yellow is disproportionate to that of nickel<br>
antimony titanium yellow. As colored pigments, nickel antimony titanium yellows offer merely<br>
an unsatisfactory option for replacing the 100,000 annual tons of lead sulfochromate and<br>
molybdate red pigments pursuanttorthe hazardous materials laws and environmental protection<br>
laws that have become increasingly stringent since 1980. The reason for this is the deficiencies,<br>
considered unchangeable, that are manifested in particular by the inadequate opacity, compared<br>
to titanium white and to chromium and cadmium yellows and by inadequate gloss and high<br>
abrasiveness.<br>
These three deficiencies are the result of one and the same cause, specifically a mean particle,<br>
size, primarily of the nickel antimony titanium yellow, that is too large and that is an average of<br>
1000 - 2000 nm in the best qualities found on the market, while the optimum opacity of a<br>
pigmentary coloring agent is attained with a particle size of 300 nm and with optimized grain<br>
shape and surface. A pigment loses about 20% of its opacity when the mean particle diameter is<br>
greater than 500 nm. Finer commercial type according to the prior art are regularly slightly<br>
doped and greatly whitened, and in addition due to their high grinding costs expensive, highly<br>
doped, high-fired products are unknown because they are inconsistent in terms of color.<br>
Surface enlargement when the mean particle diameter is 300 nm should be avoided for color<br>
 pigments because they become transparent when they drop below a particle diameter of about<br>
 half the wavelength of the light reflected by them, which is undesirable for applications for<br>
nickel antimony titanium yellow pigments. When the hardness of the particles is high,<br>
abrasiveness increases for spiky and sharp-edged particles. The goal is therefore also to produce<br>
isometric particles (rhombi) that are chamfered or have beveled flattened or rounded areas on the<br>
corners. This cannot be obtained using a coating in accordance with DE-A-2 936 746 that acts in<br>
cooperation with surfactant agents such as a slip agent and which additionally requires its own<br>
processing step and the use of auxiliary agents as the subject matter of the invention.<br><br>
Nevertheless, for avoiding color effects under different types of illumination (metamerism), a<br>
relatively smooth surface and also approximate uniformity of the (projected) edge lengths should<br>
be obtained; a spherical shape is unattainable under any conditions, however.<br>
Talcing the aforesaid into account, the relevant prior art shall be addressed:<br>
In the past, a mean particle size of 300 nm has not been reached by any manufacturer with<br>
satisfactory results for highly doped and/or fully annealed nickel or chromium antimony rutile<br>
yellow pigments (TiO2 
antimony titanium yellows. In fact, thelsmali dopings described therein inter alia with antimony<br>
and chromium at low firing temperatures 
lead to a pigment with a narrow grain size distribution and corresponding fineness, sometimes<br>
also due to the softer grain of the mixed phase oxide pigments described therein. However, there<br>
are still also limits for hue creation in terms of how the reactive iron content can assume<br>
uncontrollable amounts if a non-metallic mill with resistant lining is not used as it is inventively<br>
in this case. Still, with a product according to the prior art in DE-A-3 202 158, increased<br>
photoactivity, and with appropriate very fine grinding, a high degree of whitening must be<br>
accepted. If iron abrasion is permitted in the milling process, the material grays and leads inter<br>
alia to disturbances in PVC-based matrices. This is true even for mixed phase rutile-based oxide<br>
pigments that contain iron bound as a non-reactive component in the crystal lattice of the rutile,<br>
as in example 3 of DE-A-3 202 158,<br>
In accordance with the teaching of DE-A-3 202 158, a coloristically favorable grain size<br>
distribution is attained when low doping, relatively low firing temperature, and wet milling are<br>
combined. However, this application does not provide any information on grain size distribution<br>
and specifies the type of milling only imprecisely.<br>
In the case of titanium dioxide, synthesis during the chloride method with the adjustment of the<br>
TiCl4 burner and mixing in of agglomeration-preventing sand in the subsequent cooling and<br>
conveying process<br><br>
has already found a practical path for adjusting optimized particle size distributions (d50 =<br>
approx. 280 nm for light of 550 nm wavelength) (see inter alia: Winkler, J: "Titanium Dioxide",<br>
Hannover: Vincentz, 2003; ISBN 3-87870-148-9; pp. 35 - 37;51-58). Although in this<br>
method small quantities of aluminum chloride are metered to the titanium tetrachloride for<br>
"rutilization", it being unresolved how many lattice places in the rutile are really occupied by<br>
aluminum ions, this method is not promising e.g. using the addition of antimony and nickel<br>
chlorides to titanium tetrachloride upstream of the burner. Separation and inhomogeneous<br>
volatility of metal chlorides and metal oxychlorides prior to the lattice insertion of the metal ions<br>
is observed. A lengthy afterglow period leads to reagglomeration.<br>
The Ishihara Company is particularly active in the prior art. This is demonstrated by worldwide<br>
patent applications. These include for instance EP 1245 646 (Al, corresponds to US-A-6 576<br>
052), in which a fine-particle TiO2 obtained from the chloride process, already 100 to 400 nm<br>
mean grain size, is re-ground to a corresponding fine primary grain size during a siloxane post-<br>
treatment and coating with aluminum phosphate using a jet mill. According to EP-A-1 273 555<br>
(corresponds to US 6 616 746), the same grain fineness of the raw pigment for coating is used<br>
with multivalent alcohols and hydrolyzed amino silanes and/or aluminum hydroxide. The<br>
procedure is the same as the foregoing. Good dispersibility of the photostabilized products is<br>
claimed. For grinding, the pigment is comminuted after or during addition of the coating and<br>
stabilization reagents at a temperature of 120 to 300 °C in a jet mill or a similar "fluid energy<br>
mill" that permits a hydrolysis reaction of the amino siloxanes and other reactive components<br>
and prevents any reagglomeration during the coating process. This patent relates only to TiO2 in<br>
rutile modification (which is preferably formed by the additions of aluminum). After working up<br>
the batch, the coating is principally to act in a manner that prevents agglomeration and is<br>
photostabilizing, i.e. lastingly moderates the photocatalytic effects of the pigment.<br>
Wet grinding of rutiles, that is also rutile yellow pigments, in high-intensity bead mills is prior<br>
art e.g. in accordance with DE-A-3 930 098. These are sold by a number of different specialty<br>
companies.	<br>
The option provided e.g. in DE-A-4 106 003 to obtain an a priori finer grain structure and thus<br>
save a grinding process by "alloying" the firing batch for a rutile brown pigment with small<br>
quantities of cerium, inter alia, cannot be performed with chromium and nickel titanium<br>
pigments due to the brighter hues that are more sensitive to fluctuations in doping.<br><br>
Basically many companies seem to prefer wet precipitation to the actual synthesis of the pigment<br>
and thus create a "wet precursor" which is imprinted with the grain distribution and thus the<br>
fineness, which is maintained even until after calcination and final fine grinding. The hydroxyl<br>
groups on the surface of the freshly precipitated oxides and hydroxides represent a good<br>
precursor for the diffusive penetration of the rutile lattice, which also has numerous vacancies,<br>
with foreign metal ions after evaporating the water above 150 °C. However, the finer grain sizes<br>
possible due to the lower firing temperature are not of reproducible color intensity. The diameter<br>
still fluctuates between 800 and 1200 nm.<br>
Proceeding from the prior art described in the foregoing, the object of the invention was to<br>
suggest a fine-particle, bright, and highly opaque rutile-based pigment that is distinguished by<br>
superior opacity, gloss, and lower abrasiveness. Moreover, it should have the smallest possible<br>
or no iron content, for instance in the ppm range in any case. Moreover, the invention should<br>
suggest a method with which such a pigment can be produced in a particularly economical<br>
manner.<br>
This object is inventively attained using a fine-particle, bright, and highly opaque rutile-based<br>
pigment that is characterized in that it has a grain size distribution with particle diameters<br>
between 50 and 1000 nm and for mono-, bi-, tri-, or oligomodal frequency distribution has a<br>
primary maximum between 230 and 400 nm, whereby for a bi- or multimodal frequency<br>
distribution where necessary a secondary maximum occurs, at less than 25% of the primary<br>
maximum, between 400 and 1000 nm, in particular between about 400 and 900 nm. It is<br>
particularly preferred when the claimed primary maximum is between 280 and 340 nm and/or<br>
the secondary maximum is between 480 and 800 nm. Furthermore, it is<br><br>
preferred when the mean particle diameter of the pigment is between 80 and 1000 nm, in<br>
particular between 80 and 900 nm. The range of 120 to 600 nm is very particularly preferred.<br>
Moreover, in individual cases it is advantageous when the pigment has an asymmetrically shaped<br>
monomodal frequency distribution for the particle diameter with a maximum between 250 and<br>
390 nm, in particular between 280 and 340 nm.<br>
As is consequently evident, the particle size for the type described should be considered an<br>
essential feature of the present invention. This shall be explained in greater detail in terms of the<br>
technology. Surprisingly, it has been demonstrated that the sharp grain size distribution must sit<br>
on a "base", which as needed can also have secondary maximums in the amount of up to 15%,<br>
primarily 5%. Without this explanation being limiting or exhaustive, this special embodiment of<br>
a sharply asymmetrical, bi- or oligomodal grain distribution or a "deep drag" for attaining<br>
optimum brightness and saturation can be traced back to the need for providing optimum space<br>
filling in the matrix by approaching a specific portion of the pigment on the "Fuller curve". As<br>
long as they remain the minority, the finest portions in small diameters (150 nm 
themselves can certainly cause the absorption edge of the pigment to be steeper due to stronger<br>
absorption, which likewise causes intensification of the Raleigh scattering, resulting in improved<br>
brightness.<br>
The grain shape must also receive the required "polishing" in order to be able to work itself<br>
optimally into a matrix, improve the gloss, and protect the normal application tools. This can be<br>
done effectively and in the same work step in the inventive method, which will be described in<br>
the following, by adding auxiliary agents. The grain surface is abraded, using the selected<br>
method and appropriate additives and coatings, to the round shape, which helps to moderate the<br>
abrasiveness of the particles and to improve the flowability of highly-pigmented preparations in<br>
later use. The tendency of fine rutile pigments to agglomerate is now effectively addressed<br>
during creation, i.e., in the grinding batch, which will be described in greater detail.<br>
In the abstract, the invention includes in particular the following pigments: a highly doped, fully<br>
annealed nickel antimony rutile yellow, a<br><br>
chromium antimony rutile yellow that is just as highly doped and fully annealed, and a titanium<br>
dioxide, preferably made of synrutile precursors, each in rutile structure, that is just annealed and<br>
only weakly doped with foreign parts.<br>
The inventive fine-particle, bright, and highly opaque rutile-based pigments also result in<br>
excellent gloss values. A pigment in accordance with the invention is distinguished in that it has<br>
a 20° reflectometer gloss value of at least 42 according to DIN 67 530 and a 60° reflectometer<br>
gloss value of at least 80, in particular a 20° reflectometer gloss value of at least 50, in particular<br>
55 to 70 , and a 60° reflectometer gloss value of at least 83, in particular 83 to 93. The excellent<br>
covering power of the claimed pigments is particularly valuable. These are distinguished in that<br>
the covering power in accordance with DIN 55 987 is greater than 100% relative to a standard<br>
rutile pigment comparison substance, in particular is greater than 110%, and in particular is<br>
between 115 and 130%. Neither dry grinding used today as the state of the art nor conventional<br>
sand/bead mills are suitable for producing the inventive pigment of the type characterized.<br>
These known methods attain only mean particle sizes of 600 to 1200 nm, which results from the<br>
curves in enclosed Fig. 1. In the figure, the ribbed line represents a conventional commercial<br>
product A that was dry jet-milled, while the dashed line represents a conventional commercial<br>
nickel antimony titanium yellow, "TY70", from the Ishihara Company, that was milled in a<br>
conventional manner by means of a bead or jet mill. The uniform solid line represents a pigment<br>
in accordance with the invention. It demonstrates covering power improved by 25% and<br>
substantially improved gloss. The type of production shall be described in greater detail in the<br>
following, although it should be stated that a micromedia mill with 1.2 mm diameter grinding<br>
bodies was employed. The uniform solid line in Fig. 1 that represents the invention<br>
demonstrates a clear leap in quality compared to the ribbed and dashed lines. The optimum grain<br>
size distribution in terms of the primary maximum, between about 230 and 400 nm, could be one<br>
reason for the improved properties observed.<br>
Figs. 2 through 5 should also be mentioned in connection with Fig. 1. Figs. 2, 3, and 4 each<br>
represent an electron-microscopic image of the products represented in Fig. 1 in terms of particle<br>
size. Fig. 2 is TY70, the Ishihara conventional commercial pigment,<br><br>
Fig. 3 is the conventional commercial product A Get-milled), and Fig. 3 [sic] is the inventive<br>
nickel antimony rutile yellow pigments. The comparison demonstrates that the inventive<br>
pigment has a clearly smaller particle size.<br>
The present invention also proves to be valuable because it no longer has any regular increase in<br>
remission across all wavelengths, due to the sharpness of the grain size distribution, but rather<br>
has a maximum in the yellow range of the spectrum (about 570 to 600 nm). This simultaneously<br>
prevents the b* values from decreasing excessively because then the brightness (that is, the non-<br>
wavelength-specific remission) would increase excessively.<br>
Fig. 5 represents nickel antimony rutile yellow products in the CIELab color space. It is evident<br>
from this that the inventive products include a new color location compared to the products<br>
according to the prior art. First, this demonstrates that this is a product that differs from the prior<br>
art products. On the other hand, the invention expands the spectrum of stable pigments with a<br>
yellow hue. It is therefore of particular advantage for nickel antimony rutile yellows that the<br>
CIELab color location has a color saturation C* of 52 to 55 at a color hue angle h of 96 to 98°<br>
according to DIN 5033.<br>
The subject matter of the present invention is also a method for producing the pigments in<br>
accordance with the invention. It is characterized in that an inorganic mixed phase oxide<br>
pigment with rutile structure is treated by means of high-speed grinding in an aqueous<br>
suspension in an agitator ball mill with resistant lining until the grab size distribution described<br>
in the foregoing has been attained. Preferably the grinding unit and the grinding tools have a<br>
wear-resistant and inert coating. Preferably the resistant lining material for the (high-speed)<br>
agitator ball mill is an inert and wear-resistant ceramic material, in particular in the form of a<br>
heat-conductive ceramic material for assisting in cooling. Alternatively, it is preferred that the<br>
resistant lining material for the agitator ball mill is an inert and wear-resistant plastic, e.g.<br>
polyurethane.<br><br>
Additional information regarding the method. It is preferred that resistant grinding pearls with a<br>
diameter of about 0.2 to 1.7 mm, in particular from about 0.5 to 1.2 mm, are used in the milling<br>
unit in an analogous manner for coating. The temperature during fine grinding is preferably<br>
between about 20 and 90 °C, in particular between about 40 and 60 °C. Moreover, it is useful<br>
that the fine grinding is performed in the framework of the inventive method using a<br>
recirculation method, the mean dwell time of the ground material in the agitator ball mill being 4<br>
to 44 min, in particular 10 to 18 min. It is useful that the circumferential speed of the rotor in the<br>
agitator ball mill is 5 to 19 m/s, in particular 10 to 12 m/s. In addition, in the framework of the<br>
invention the fill level is usefully planned to be advantageous. It is preferred that the fill level of<br>
the agitator ball mill with grinding bodies is about 60 to 90 vol.%, in particular about 70 to 80<br>
vol.%.<br>
In an exceptional case, it is preferred that pre-comminution occurs upstream of the inventive<br>
method. This usefully occurs in a ball mill, likewise made of resistant material, metal contact<br>
with the ground material being largely prevented. This is one reason that iron content is largely<br>
prevented in the inventive pigments. In other words, this means that the iron content is<br>
determined solely by the parameters of the raw materials and is thus in any case in the ppm<br>
range.<br>
Regarding the history of the inventive method it should be stated: After initial experiments with<br>
highly doped and fully annealed nickel titanium yellow as for the teaching of DE-A- 3 202 158<br>
with high-speed agitator ball mills failed due to unsatisfactory color consistency, it was<br>
surprisingly found that the grinding efficiency improved dramatically in connection with<br>
chemically and mechanically resistantly lined agitator ball mills and ceramic fine grinding<br>
bodies. Preferably the lining should be non-metallic. It could comprise plastic, but it could also<br>
comprise ceramic. Therefore a sharp grain size distribution with about 320 nm mean particle<br>
diameter, close to the optimum, can be attained with relatively low grinding complexity, the<br>
grain size distribution additionally also having a steep course that conforms to the objective.<br><br>
The refitting of the agitator ball mill, mentioned in the foregoing in terms of the metal-free<br>
lining, was thus extremely important for conducting the new inventive wet milling method<br>
successfully. The inventive pigments and also the inventive method have particular value, which<br>
is evidenced by numerous advantages: for instance, the grinding efficiency can be promoted<br>
using the surfactant polymers, mentioned in the foregoing, specifically using differently<br>
substituted polysiloxane compounds and polar substituted long-chain alkanes. The polysiloxanes<br>
primarily effect hydrophobization of the per se polar surface of the inorganic pigment particle.<br>
During subsequent working in into nonpolar binding agents (solvent-containing resin) or other<br>
polymer materials (polyolefins), the hydrophobization of the pigment surface leads to clearly<br>
more rapid rewetting and thus to less wear. Under the selected grinding conditions, highly<br>
disperse oxides of silicon or aluminum prove to be the solution to hydrodynamic problems, in<br>
addition to adjusting an optimal ion strength and therefore viscosity with a salt of an oxygen acid<br>
of for instance sulfur or phosphorus. Using the aforesaid compounds it is therefore possible to<br>
obtain particularly advantageous controllability when optimizing the inventive method.<br>
The present invention overcomes the aforesaid deficiencies of prior art nickel antimony titanium<br>
yellow pigments and leads, optionally using a modified finish process, to yellow pigments with<br>
substantially improved opacity and substantially improved gloss that is the equivalent of that of<br>
titanium white; at the same time the color intensity is improved compared to low-doped rutiles<br>
that are annealed at lower reaction temperatures, which is clearly evidenced in Fig. 5. In<br>
accordance with the object, the invention thus includes a new application area for highly doped<br>
rutile pigments.<br>
In summary, the advantages of the inventive pigment can be depicted as follows: It is<br>
distinguished from the prior art product by improved gloss, low whiteness/less brightening,<br>
relatively high color saturation, and extremely high covering power, not usable in the past in this<br>
class of material, with low photoactivity for fine-particle rutiles compared to the prior art.<br>
Furthermore, in practice it does not<br><br>
demonstrate any disadvantageous abrasivity or any interaction of any grinding residues with the<br>
application matrix. In particular it is essentially free of reactive metals or metal compounds, in<br>
particular reactive iron compounds.<br>
The invention shall be explained in the following in greater detail using various examples,<br>
although this shall not be construed as a limitation.<br>
Example 1: Step 1: Pre-comminution<br>
It is advantageous to have a conventional pre-comminution step upstream of fine grinding in<br>
order to limit the duration of grinding. This can occur according to the following variations, and<br>
the ground material is then fed directly to the inventive process (these are actually processes in<br>
accordance with the prior art, which are only included for the sake of completeness and to<br>
demonstrate the general applicability of the invention):<br>
Ball mill/roller block<br>
40% suspension (4 kg pigment and 6 L water) of the raw pigment: is ground with 25-mm ceramic<br>
balls on the roller block for 60 to 90 min.<br>
Sand mill:<br>
Horizontal PU-lined sand mill with Ottawa sand or zircon silicate grinding beads (Rimax) with a<br>
diameter of 2.5 to 2.8 mm. There are 1 to 2 passes with 600 to 800 kg 40% suspension per hour.<br>
The temperature must be kept below 60 °C.<br>
Although a jet mill for dry pre-comminution with subsequent slurrying of the raw pigment to the<br>
40% suspension is very effective and does not cause any wear, it is very complex and time-<br>
consuming to manage and is therefore expensive.<br>
Corundum disc mill: Pre-comminution of the raw pigment particles into a 40% suspension has a<br>
throughput that is too low, but can be used trial-wise.<br><br>
Example 2: Step 2: Inventive wet grinding<br>
The 10 kg of the 40% suspension of the nickel titanium raw pigment from Example 1 are<br>
adjusted to a pH of 6 - 6.5 with 10% sulfuric acid, and if necessary adjusted to conductivity of<br>
2000 to 2500 µS/cm by adding sodium sulfate solution, in order to obtain a stable, pumpable<br>
suspension having a viscosity of 600 - 700 mPa*s. A Lehmann "FM 20" mill lined with a<br>
special heat-conductive ceramic material for cooling is used.<br>
Example 2a: Pass grinding<br>
The suspension is pumped through the mill 3 times, passes 1 and 2 with grinding balls (cerium-<br>
stabilized zircon oxide balls, bulk density 3.7 kg/L) 1.7 to 2.4 mm, the third pass with grinding<br>
balls 0.7 to 1.2 mm (cerium-stabilized zircon oxide balls, bulk density 3.7 kg/L) at a throughput<br>
of 600 g suspension per minute; this is equal to a dwell time of 130 to 150 sec per pass, that is, a<br>
total dwell time of 10 min. The mill is set to a circumferential speed of 12 m/sec. The grinding<br>
temperature is no more than 45 °C.<br>
Example 2b: Circulatory grinding<br>
1 pass with grinding balls (cerium-stabilized zircon oxide balls, bulk density 3.7 kg/L) 1.7 to 2.4<br>
mm (72 vol.% of the grinding space), then circulatory grinding for 30 to 60 min with a<br>
throughput of 900 g suspension per min, which equals total dwell time of 6 to 12 min and 4 to 8<br>
theoretical passes. It is necessary to check the pH after each pass or every 30 min during<br>
circulatory grinding. If the pH rises above 6.5, it must be corrected by adding sulfuric acid. The<br>
mill is set for a circumferential speed of 11 m/sec.<br>
After 45 minutes have elapsed, 20 g (0.2%) Nuosperse 2008, a fatty amine salt of an ethoxylated<br>
and partially phosphatized polymer oleyl alcohol are added for conditioning and grinding<br>
continues for an additional 15 min. If the suspension becomes thin, the viscosity must be raised<br>
by adding no more than 50 g sodium dihydrogen phosphate, and if necessary<br><br>
more additional sulfuric acid. The grinding temperature is no more than 45 °C.<br>
Example 3: Adding additives<br>
After fine grinding in accordance with Example 2b, the pigment is washed until the conductivity<br>
of the excess liquid is 500 to 800 µS/cm. The suspension is concentrated by means of centrifuge<br>
decanter or filter press to a solid content of 55 to 65%. Then additional 2.5% sodium sulfate is<br>
added to the slurry, the viscosity is adjusted to 620 Pa*s with equal parts by weight of sodium<br>
phosphate and sulfuric acid, an additional quick pass (dwell time 
performed with grinding balls (cerium-stabilized zircon oxide balls, bulk density 3.7 kg/L) 1.7 to<br>
2.4 mm.<br>
An excellently covering yellow pigment is obtained that has optimum gloss in the coating. There<br>
are no detectable differences between the pigment in accordance with the method in Example 2A<br>
and in accordance with the method in Example 2B.<br>
Example 4: Adding additives:<br>
After fine grinding in accordance with Example 2b, the pigment is washed until the conductivity<br>
of the excess liquid is 500 to 800 µS/cm. The suspension is concentrated by means of centrifuge<br>
decanter or filter press to a solid content of 60%. Then additional 3% non-ionic, modified fatty<br>
acid derivative (commercial product) and 100 g "Aerosil" are added to the slurry, and an<br>
additional quick pass (dwell time 
(cerium-stabilized zircon oxide balls, bulk density 3.7 kg/L) 1.7 to 2.4 mm (same filling as<br>
before).<br>
An excellently covering yellow pigment is obtained that has optimum gloss in the coating. It is<br>
not possible to detect a feared matting effect from the Aerosil There are no detectable<br>
differences between the pigment in accordance with the method in Example 2A and in<br>
accordance with the method in Example 2B.<br><br>
Example 5: Adding additives<br>
After fine grinding in accordance with Example 2b, the pigment is washed until the conductivity<br>
of the excess liquid is 500 to 800 µS/cm. The suspension is concentrated by means of centrifuge<br>
decanter or filter press to a solid content of 60%. Then additional 2% a [sic] polydimethyl<br>
siloxane (aqueous emulsion) is added to the slurry to reduce abrasivity, in addition 35 g<br>
"aluminum oxide C" from the Degussa Company (commercial product), an additional quick pass<br>
(dwell time 
oxide balls, bulk density 3.7 kg/L) 1.7 to 2.4 mm (same filling as before).<br>
After separation, an excellently covering, bright yellow pigment is obtained that has optimum<br>
gloss in the coating. There are no detectable differences between the pigment in accordance with<br>
the method in Example 2A and in accordance with the method in Example 2B.<br>
Example 6: Variations in the auxiliary agents<br>
To illustrate how independent the pigment properties are in accordance with this invention,<br>
deviating from the wording of these examples the following auxiliary agents are used in<br>
variations that are reasonable to experts in the field without this having a significantly further<br>
improving effect on the result, in contrast to DE-A-2 936 746:<br>
Modified fatty acid derivatives<br>
1.	Fatty amine salt of a polymer oleyl alcohol, ethoxylated and phosphatized, and<br>
2.	Non-ionic, modified fatty acid derivative<br>
Polysiloxane compounds<br>
1.	With polyether group-modified siloxane<br>
2.	Alkylaryl-modified polysiloxane<br>
Nanodisperse aluminum oxide or silicic acids<br>
Aluminum oxide C (Degussa)<br>
Aerosils<br><br>
The following can be used as grinding balls:<br>
1.7 to 2.4 mm cerium-stabilized zircon oxide balls, bulk density 3.7 kg/L<br>
0.7 to 1.2 mm cerium-stabilized zircon oxide balls, bulk density 3.7 kg/L<br>
0.6 to 0.8 mm yttrium-stabilized zircon oxide balls, bulk density 3.6 kg/L<br>
0.8 to 1.0 mm yttrium-stabilized zircon oxide balls, bulk density 2.8 kg/L<br>
2.5 to 2.8 mm zircon silicate balls, bulk density 2.4 kg/L<br>
Example 7: Evaluation<br>
After filtration and drying, a bright, highly opaque, and fine-particle yellow pigment is obtained.<br>
In comparison, the pigment in accordance with Example 4 is as follows (Table 1):<br><br>
See Fig. 1 enclosed in the attachment with regard to the particle size in the products compared in<br>
the foregoing. The described commercial product A was obtained according to common<br>
multistage jet-milling methods until no more improvement could be attained. Grain shape and<br>
particle size can be seen and compared in enclosed Figures 2, 3, and 4 in raster electron-<br>
microscope images. The round polished shape that is responsible for some of the favorable<br>
application technology properties is evident.<br>
Example 8: Non-voluntary confirmation of success for inventive improved nickel antimony<br>
titanium yellow pigment<br><br>
The efficacy of the invention is documented primarily by the following incident, highlighted<br>
briefly and without any disturbing effects (the pigment is also resistant to leaching), during the<br>
development of the product, even though it may seem to be an unorthodox example:<br>
Pilot production began after preliminary results from Examples 1 - 6 were evaluated. Because<br>
of an error in handling, small quantities of very fine nickel antimony rutile yellow pigment<br>
traveled out of the mill into the receptacle for the waste water basin (clear side). The pigment<br>
was deposited as an extremely well covering, uniform, and intensely luminous lemon yellow<br>
coating on the walls and fittings of the waste water preparation system. The "result" looked like<br>
it had been applied with a roller or sprayed on in a clean, covering manner. The bright green<br>
substrate of the building and the various pipes, fixtures, and cables did not have any more yellow<br>
hue nuances in the midday sunlight. The color effect initially led one to think of doped bismuth<br>
vanadate or even lead chromate, which could not be disproved without chemical analysis. If one<br>
is mindful that all of this occurred without auxiliary agents, the practical value of the<br>
improvement from the invention becomes quite clear.<br>
Example 9: Variation of the ground substance: other rutile-based pigments<br>
Trial as in Examples 1 and 2A, but, instead of with nickel antimony rutile yellow, with "off-<br>
white" titanium dioxide, obtained from a synrutile using the method according to DE-A-101 03<br>
977, which according to the method described therein, but in contrast to Example 3 of DE-A-3<br>
202 158, is obtained directly and does not contain any more "reactive iron". A batch is produced<br>
according to Examples 1 and 2A, but a "synrutile" with 97% TiO2 is used instead of a synthetic<br>
mixed phase color pigment. Similarly significant improvements result, in this case with regard<br>
to improved brightness, opacity, and gloss, which include the use of a "synrutile" in a direct<br>
manner (i.e. without refining methods, using the chloride or sulfate process, that are otherwise<br>
usual for TiO2) for pigment applications in the sector of pastel white colors.<br>
In the context of this invention, the qualitative evaluation furthermore leads to the conclusion<br>
that the inventive method is applicable to all grain-hard or highly<br><br>
agglomerated pigments that are based on titanium dioxide in a rutile structure, without having to<br>
pay for these advantages with weak color for lack of adequate doping, with sharply increased<br>
photoactivity, with a significantly increased expenditure of energy and/or non-specific graying<br>
due to metal abrasion of the grinding aggregate.<br>
Example 10: Comparison of measured gloss values for commercial product A, inventive nickel<br>
antimony rutile yellow, and Ishihara TY70 commercial pigment, which were compared in the<br>
foregoing.<br>
The measured gloss values are determined according to DIN 67 530. An alkyd melamine<br>
stoving enamel (55% solid content) was used for the testing system. For this, 80 g resin, 20 g<br>
pigment, and 120 g glass beads (2 mm) were weighed into a polypropylene beaker and shaken<br>
for 20 minutes on a Scandex shaker. The pigmented resin was applied to a white testing chart<br>
(Leneta Form WH) with a wet film thickness of 200 um using a film drawing device (Erichsen<br>
Company, model 509 MCIII) and fired for 30 min at 130 °C. Then the reflectometer values were<br>
determined with standard illuminant D 65.<br><br>
Example 11: Determining covering power<br>
Covering power was determined according to DIN 55 97 using standard light D65 (daylight,<br>
northern hemisphere, corresponding to emission radiation of the black body heated to 6504 K),<br>
using an oxidatively drying alkyd resin. For this, 70 g resin, 30 g pigment, and 120 g glass beads<br>
(2 mm) were weighed into a polypropylene beaker<br><br>
and shaken for 20 min on a Scandex shaker. The pigmented resin was applied to black/white<br>
contrast cards with wet film thicknesses of 60 to 400 µm using a film drawing device (Erichsen<br>
Company, model 509 MCIII) with a type 421/II Erichsen Company step rake. After the resin<br>
film was dried, the color spacing DE was determined over black and white substrates according<br>
to DIN 6174 and applied graphically against the reciprocal value of the film thickness at which<br>
the color spacing is DE = 1. This was determined both for the described nickel titanium<br>
pigments and for a titanium dioxide pigment for the rutile modification. The covering power in<br>
Table II is provided relative to titanium dioxide. The concentration of the tested pigments was<br>
less than the critical pigment volume concentration (CPVK).<br><br><br>
