				<td>The present application claims priority from U.S. provisional application number 60/052,535, filed July 15, 1997, which is herein incorporated by reference.<br>
Technical Field The present invention pertains to improvements to a Stirling cycle heat engine or refrigerator cued more particularly to improvements relating to mechanical and thermal components of a Stirling cycle heat engine or refrigerator which contribute to increased e operating efficiency and lifetime, and to reduced size, complexity and cost.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Stilling cycle machines, including engines and refrigerators, have a long technological heritage, described in detail in Walker, Stirling Engines, Oxford University Press (1980), incorporated herein by reference. The principle underlying the Stirling cycle engine is the mechanical realization of the Stirling thermodynamic cycle: isovolumetric heating of a gas within a cylinder, isothermal expansion of the gas (during which work is performed by driving a pision), isovolumetric cooling, and isothermal compression. The Sliding cycle refrigerator is also the mechanical realization of a thcnnodynamic cycle which approximates the ideal Stirling thermodynamic cycle. In an ideal Stirling thermodynamic cycle, the working fluid undergoes successive cycles of isovolumetric heating, isothermal expansion, isovolumetric cooling and isothermal compression. Practical realizations of the cycle, wherein the stages are neither isovolumetric nor isothermal, arc with the scope of the present invention and may be referred to within the present description in the language of the ideal case without limitation of the .scope of the invention as claimed.<br>
Various aspects of the present invention apply to both Stirling cycle engines and Stirling cycle refrigerators, which are relx"-rred to collectively as Stirling cycle machines in the present description and in any appended claims. Additional aspects of Stirling cycle machines ibid<br><br>
improvements thereto are discussed in a co-pending U.S. patent application entitled "Stirling Cycle Machine Improvements/" filed July 14,1998, and incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The principle of operation of a Stirling cycle engine is readily described with reference to FIGS, la-If, wherein identical numerals iu:e used to identify the same or similar parts. Many mechanical layouts of Stirling cycle engines are known in the art, and the particular Stirling engine designated generally by numeral 10 is shown merely for illustrative purposes. In FIGS, la to Id, a piston 12 (otherwise referred to herein as a "compression piston") and a second piston (also known as an "expansion piston") 14 move in phased reciprocating motion within cylinder 16. Compression piston 12 and expansion piston 14 may also move within separate, interconnected, cylinders. Piston seals 18 prevents the flow of a working fluid contained within cylinder 16 between piston 12 and piston 14 from escaping around either piston 12. The working fluid is chosen for its theraiodynamic properties, as discussed in the description below, and is typically helimn at a pressure of several atmospheres. The volume of fluid governed by the position of expansion piston 14 is referred to as expansion space 22. The volume of fluid governed by the position of compression piston 12 is referred to as compression space 24. In order for fluid to flow between expansion space 22 and compression space 24. whether in the configuration shown or in anotlicr contigurauon of Stirling engine 10, the fluid passes through regenerator 26. Regenerator 26 is a matrix of material having a large ratio of surface airâ€™s to volume which sieves to absorb heat from the working fluid when the fluid enters hot from expansion space 22 and to heal the lluid when it passes from compression space 24 returning to expansion space 22.<br>
During the first phase of the engine cycle, the starting condition of which is depicted in FIG. la, piston 12 compresses the tluid in compression space 24. The compression occurs at a constant temperature because heat is extracted from the fluid to the ambient environment. In practice, a cooler 68 (shown in FIG. 2) is provided, as will be discussed in the description below. The condition of engine 10 after compresjston is depicted in FIG. 1 b. During the second phase of [he cycle, expansion piston 14 mo\"es in .synchrony with compression piston 12 lo maintain a constant volume of fluid. As the fluid is transferred to expan.sion space 22, it flows through regenerator 26 and acquires heat from regenerator 26 such thai the pressure of the tluid increases.<br><br>
At the end of the transfer phase, the fluid is at a higher pressure and is contained within expansion space 22, as depicted in FIG. Ic.<br>
During the third (expansion) phase of the engine cycle, the volume of expansion space 22 increases as heat is drawn in from outside engine 10, thereby converting heat to work. In practice, heat is provided to the fluid in expansion space 22 by means of a heater 64 (shown in FIG. 2) which is discussed in greater detail in the description below. At the end of the expansion phase, the hot fluid fills the full expansion space 22 as depicted in FIG. Id. During the fourth phase of the engine cycle, the fluid is transferred from expansion space 22 to compression space 24, heating regenerator 26 as the fluid passes through it. At the end of the second transfer phase, the fluid is i|i compres.sion .space 24, as depicted in FTG. la, and is ready for a repetition of the compression phase. The Stirling cycle is depicted in a P-V (pressure-volume) diagram as shown in FIG. le and in a T-S (temperature -entropy) diagram as shown in FIG. If. The Stirling cycle is a closed cycle in that the working fluid is typically not replaced during the course of the cycle.<br>
The principle of operation of a Stirling cycle refrigerator can also be described with reference to FIGS. la-ic, wherein identical numerals arc used lo identify the same or similar parts. The differences between the engine described above and a Stirling machine employed as a refrigerator are that compression volume 22 is typically in thermal communication with ambient temperature and expansion volume 24 is connected to an external cooling load (not shown). Refrigerator operation requires net work input.<br>
Stirling cycle engines have not generally been used in practical applications, and Stirling cycle refrigerators have been limited to the specialty field of cryogenics, due to several daunting engineering challenges to their development. These involve such practical considerations as efficiency, vibration, lifetime, imd cost. The instant invention addresses these considerations.<br>
As used in this description and in any appended claims, the term "harmonic drive" will refer to a drive arrangement employing a gear set to intcrconvcrt rotary and sinusoidal linear motion, A harmonic crank drive has been applied lo a diesel engine (as described by Moeller, "Prime Movers for Series Hybrid Vehicle.^," (Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc., 1997) and 10 a single piston of a Stirling engine, as described by Bariolini and Caresana, *"A New Small Stirling Engine Prototype for Auxiliar&gt;" Eraployements fsicl Aboard," (ASME, 1995), both of<br><br>
which publications are incorporated herein by reference. Tlie single-piston embodiment of Bartolini and Caresana, however, suffers from a dynamic imbalance that may lead to inefficient operation and wear.<br>

Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiments Referring now to FIG. 2, a Stirling cycle engine, shown in cross-section, is designated generally by numeral 28. While the invention will be described generally with reference to the Stirling engine shown in FIG. 2, it is to be understood that many engines as well as refrigerators may similarly benefit from various embodiments and improvements which are subjects of the present invention. The configuration of Stirling engine 28 shown in FIG. 2 is referred to as an alpha configuration, characterized in that compression piston 30 and expansion piston 32 tmdcrgo linear motion within respective and distinct cylinders: compression piston 30 in compres.sion cylinder 34 and expansion piston 32 in expansion cylinder 36.<br>
In addition to compression piston 30 and expansion piston 32, the main componenLs of Stirling engine 28 include healer 64, regenerator 66, and cooler 68. Compression piston 30 and expansion piston 32, referred to collectively as pistons, are constrained to move in reciprocating linear motion within respective vnlume.s 38 and 40. A cylinder lincr 42 may line the respective cylinder surfaces. The volumes of the cylinder interior proximate to the heater 64 and cooler 68 will be referred to, herein, as hot and cold sections, respectively, of engine 28, The relative phase (the "phase angle") of the reciprocating linear motion of compression piston 30 and expansion<br><br>
piston 32 is governed by their respective coupling to drive mechanism 44 housed in crankcase 46. Drive mechanism 44, discussed in greater detail below, is one example of various mechanisms known in the art of engine design which may be employed to govern the relative timing of pistons and lo interconveri linear and rotary motion. Compression piston 30 and expansion piston 32 ai-e coupled, respectively, to drive mechanism 44 via a first connecting rod 48 and a second connecting rod 50. The volume 38 of compression cylinder 34 is coupled to cooler 68 via duct 45 to allow cyclic cooling of working fluid. Duct 45, more particularly, couples compression volume 38 to the annular heat exchangers comprising cooler 68, regenerato 66, and heater 64. Branching of flow between duct 45 and annular plenum 47 is discussed below with reference to Fig. 9.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, rods 48 and 50 may be fabricated with flexibility with respect to bending sd as to accommodate drive misalignments (such as may arise due to prcssurization and healing of the engine structure) while providing sufficient tensile and contractile stiffness to carry the requisite compressive loads without buckling. Rods 48 and 50 arc preferredly fashioned from a high-strength metal, such as S-7 tool steel, for example, and are advantageously of ellipsoidal cross-section, although rods of any cross-section are within the scope of the present invention.<br>
The operation of drive mechanism 44 is now discussed with reference to Fig. 3. In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a novel linkage (which may be referred to as an "Iv-drive" linkage) is provided for coupling two members undergoing sinusoidal linear motion with a relative phase lag. An cpicycJic gear set is designated generally by numeral 70. Epicyclic gear set 70 may be employed in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention for coupling the reciprocating linear motions of pistons 12 and 14 (shown in FIG. 1), referred to alternatively as compression pLston 12 and expansion piston 14. Epicyclic gear set 70 consists of an internal gear 72 and a pinion gear 74, with the pitch diameter of internal gear 72 equal to twice the pitch diameter of pinion gear 74. When internal gear 72 remains fixed and pinion gear 74 is allowed to turn inside internal gear 72, each point on perimeter 76 of pinion gear 74 travels along a straight line with pure sinusoidal motion with respect to a fiducial point on the line.<br><br>
FIGS. 4a-4h show the respective linear travel of pistons 12 and 14 coupled via coimeciing rods 48 and 50 to opposite sides of pinion gear 74 turning with respect to fixed internal gear 72 as described in reference to FIG. 3. Pistons 12 and 14 move at an angle to each other, preferentially an angle within approximately 10" of perpendicular. Pistons 12 and 14 sweep out pure vsinusoidal linear motion in a phase-angle relation substantially equal to the angular orientation of the axes of piston motion with respect to each other. Thus, for example, for piston travel oriented precisely orthogonally, pistons 12 and 14 move substantially in quadrature (90"" out-of-phasc) with respect to one another. Successive phases of the motion of pistons 12 and 14 with rotation of pinion gear 74 are shown in FIGS. 4a-4h.<br>
Rcfening now to FIG. 5a, tlie use of a counterweight 78 rotating 180Â° out of phase with pinion gear 74 aUows the engine to be dynamically balanced. Referring to the cross-sectional view of the drive shown in FIG. 5b, it is not necessary to load the drive symmetrically about its center line provided that a set of "torsional counterweights" 80 sue added about the axis of eccentric crankshaft 86. The set of two opposing counterweights 80, provided in addition to primary counterweight 78, may balance tlic moments created by the offset pistons while primary counterweight 78 balance the engine in translation. In the embodiment of the invention depicted in perspective in FIG. 5a and in cross-sectional top and side views in FIGS. 5b, 6a and 6b, counterweights 78 are provided to rotate in countciphase to compression piston bearings 82 and expansion piston beating 84 respectively. The linkage drive embodiments of the present invention require far fewer parts than a rhombic drive mechanism, described in further detail below. Additionally, the volume displaced by the no\"el linkage drive is smaller than the volume of the displacement of a rhombic drive with the same piston stroke. Additionally, the sinusoidal motion of the two perpendicular pistons may be perfectly balanced with a simple counterweight, and does not put side loads on the piston seals, thereby reducing friction, increasing engine lifetime, and allowing dry operation.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 7a, a cross-sectional view is shown of Stiriing engine 28 taken along cut AA of FIG. 2. Eccentric compression pi.ston bearings 82 and expansion piston bearing 84 are disposed about eccentric crankshaft 86 a.s cantilevcred from main bearing set 88 which supports primaiy (or "outer") crankshaft 90 with respect to the housing 92 of engine 28.<br><br>
Eccentric crankshaft 86 rotates about an axis eccenlric to primary crankshaft 90, driving primary crankshaft 90 in an opposite sense of rotation, at the same speed of rotation, by virtue of pinion gear 94 and internal gear 96, together comprising cpicyclic gear set 98. as described with reference to FIG. 3, The position of primaiy crankshaft 90 with respect to an arbitrary point fixed with respect to the engine defines a "crank angle." Crankshafts configui-ed in this manner may be referred to as "harmonic crankshafts."<br>
The cantilcvcred crankshaft configuration advantageously allows lubrication of geai- set 98 without contamination of the Stirling engine working fluid which must be kept clean so as not to contaminate tlie regenerator and compromise the efficient operation of the engine. Primary crankshaft 90, in turn, may irapait torque to a mechanical load. An example of a mechanical load is generator rotor 100, rotationally driven with respect to generator stator 102 for generating electrical energy. Eccentric flywheel 104 and linear comitcrweight 106 arc coupled to eccentric crankshaft 86 and thus canlilevered about main bearing set 88. Eccentric flywheel 104 is provided in order that the net angular momentum, including the rotational momentum of the forwai"d rotating components and that of the backward-rotating components, is zero. Thus, vibration of the engine due to variations in engine speed are advantageously avoided. Eccentric flywheel 104 may, within the scope of the invention, be otherwise disposed than as shown in FIG. 7a. For example, reigning to FIG. 7b, an alternate embodiment of the Stirling engine of Fig. 2 is shown in cross-section, wherein eccentric flywheel 104 is disposed at the end 105 of eccentric crankshaft 86 distal to the location of piston bearings 82 and 84. Referring again to FIG. 7a, eccentric crankshaft 86 is supported with respect to primary crankshaft 90 by bearings 108 and 110. A primary counterweight 112 and lorsional counterweight 114 are provided for dynamic balance of primary crankshaft 90 with rcspeci to the whole eccentric crankshaft assembly, including the pistons.<br>
The load on primary crankshaft 90 preferentially does not change direction over the course of a cycle of the engine. Fn this way, by virtue of the balance of forward and backward inertia, torque reversal on epicyclic gear .set 98 is advantageously prevented, thereby preventing noise and wear associated with gear backlash. If the load on the primary axle 90 is constant, the torque on epicyclic gear set 98 is imidirectional and is also minimized for a given net power<br><br>
output. If the applied load is an electric generator, constant torque operation also results in the highest generator efficiency. Additionally, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention, the current load on the generator may be regulated, such as by load regulator 103 which may be a processor, as known in the electrical arts, for providing a constant torque on epicyclic gear set 98 for realizing the described advantageous operation. Additionally, generator rotor 100 may provide all or part of the mass of a flywheel, and the generator may also function as a starter for starting the engine.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 8a and 8b, a novel structure is depicted, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, for transferring large amounts of heat from the combustion source to tlie interior of Stirling cycle engine 28, shown in cross section. In order to increase the efficiency of heat transfer from hot gases 300, generated by burner 150, to the working fluid contained in tlie interior volume 306 of the engine, a large wetted surface area, on either side of healer head 64 is required. To achieve tlie high surface area, a large number of metal pins 310 are fabricated on both the interior suiface 312 and exterior surface 314 of heater head 64. Fabrication may be accomplished at low cost, such as by invesanent casting. Metal pins 310 not only increase the wetted surface ai-ea on either side of heater head 64 but also create turbulent wakes that increase fluid mixing and thereby further increase the flow of heat. Tiiis structure may also be employed for heat transfer at the cooler 68 (shown in FIG. 2) or in any application where efficient heat u-an.sfer is required between volumes of gases.<br>
Referring to FIG. 9a, a perspective view is shown of a system of header ducts 400 providing for the flow of working fluid between compression volume 38 and the annular region of fluid flow through the heat exchange network, namely past cooler head 68, through regenerator 66 (shown in FIG. 2), and past heater head 64 (shown in FIG. 2). The aimular flow of working fluid culminates at annular header 47 to which branching ducts 400 are coupled for creating equal-length flow passages between cylinder volume 38 and the entire annular region of header 47. By substantiiUly equalizing the flow impedance between every portion of the annular flow region and the cylinder volume, losses due to flow non-uniformities through the heat exchangers may be advantageously reduced, and. additionally, the now of working fluid within a loop confined to the heat exchange region and thereby lost for puiposes of mechanical work may<br><br>
be minimized. FIG. 9b vShows a schematic of the system of branching ducts 400 of FIG. 9a, "unwrapped" into a planar view, showing the fluid communication via branching ducts 400 between compression space 38 and annular header 47.<br>
While Stirling engines are capable of providing high thermal efficiency and low emission of pollutants, these objectives impose requirements of thermal efficiency, in particular, on a burner employed to heat heater head 64 (shown in FIG. 2) of the Stirling engine. Components of such thermal efficiency include the efficient pumping of oxidant (typically, air, and, referred to herein and in any appended claims, without limitation, as "air") through the burner to provide combustion, and the recovery of hot exhaust leaving the heater head. In many applications, air (or other oxidant) is pre-heated, prior to combustion, neai"ly to the temperature of the heater head, so as to achieve the stated objectives of thermal efficiency.<br>
In order to achieve low emissions, the fuel and air must be well-mixed with sufficient amounts of oxygen to limit the emission of carbon monoxide (CO) and. additionally, must be buraed at low enough flame temperatures to limit the formation of oxides of nitrogen (NOJ. The high temperature of preheated air, desirable for achieving high thermal efficiency, complicates achieving low-emission goals by making it difficult to premix the fuel and air and requiring large amounts of excess air in order to limit the flame temperature.<br>
As used herein and in any appended chiims, the term "auto-ignition temperature" is defined as the temperdture at which a fuel will ignite without a temperature-decreasing catalyst under existing conditions of air and fuel pressure. The typical preheated air temperature exceeds the auto-ignition temperature of most fuels, potentially causing the fuel-air mixture to ignite before entering the combustion chamber. One solution to this problem is to use a non-premixed diffusion flame. However, smce such diffusion tlames are not well-mixed, higher than desirable emissions of CO and NO^ result. A detailed discussion of flame dynamics is provided by Turns. An Introduction to Combustion: Concepts and Applications, (McGraw-Hill, 1996), which is incorporated herein by reference. Any increased airflow provided to limit flame temperatures typically increases the power consmncd by an air pump or blower, thereby degrading overall engine cificieiicy.<br>
Iti accordance with the present invention, low emissions and high efficiency may be<br><br>
provided by producing a pre-mixed flame even in the presence of air heated above the auto-ignition temperature of the fuel, and, additionally, by minimizing the pressure drop between the air inlet imdpe flame region, thereby minimizing blower power consumption, as now discussed.<br>
The term "flame speed" is defined as the speed at which a flame front will propagate through a particular fucl-air mixture. Within the specification and the following claims, the term "combustion axis" shall refer to the direction of predominant fluid flow upon combustion of the fluid.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 10a-lOc, an intake manifold 599 is shown for application to a Stirling cycle engine or other combustion application in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, fuel is pre-mixed with air.that may be heated above the fuel"s auto-ignition temperature and a flame is prevented from forming until the fuel and air arc well-mixed. FIG. 10a shows a preferred embodiment of the apparatus including an intake manifold 599 and a combustion chamber 610. The intake manifold 599 has an axisymmetrical conduit 601 with an inlet 603 for receiving air 600. Air 600 is pre-heatcd to a temperature, typically above 1000 K, which may be above the auto-ignition temperature of the fuel. Conduit 601 conveys air 600 flowing inwai-d radially with respect to combustion axis 620 to a swirler 602 disposed within the conduit 601.<br>
Fig. 10b shows a cross sectional view of the conduit 601 including swirler 602 in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. In the embodiment of FIG. lOb, swirler 602 has several spiral-shaped vanes 702 for directing the flow of air 600 radially inward and imparling a rotational component on the air. The diameter of the swirler section of the conduit decreases from the inlet 704 to the outlet 706 of swirler 602 as defined by the length of swirler vanes 702. The decrciise in diameter of swirler vanes 702 increases the flow rate of air 600 in substantially inverse proportion to the diameter. The flow rate is increased so that it is above the &gt;"    flame speed of the fuel. At outlet 706 of swirler 602, fuel 606, which in a preferred embodiment is propane, is injected into the inwardly flowing air.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, fuel 606 is injecied by fuel injector 604 through a series of no/zlcs 800 as shown in FIG. 10c. More particularly, FIG. lOc shows a cro.ss .sectional view of conduii 601 and includes the fuel jet nozzles 800. Each of the nozzles 800 is positioned ai the<br><br>
exit of the swirler vanes 702 and is centralized between two adjacent vanes. Nozzles 800 are positioned in this way for increasing the efficiency of mixing tlie air and fuel. Nozzles 800 simultaneously inject the fuel 606 across the air flow 600. Since the air flow is faster than the flame speed, a flame will not form at that point even though the temperature of the air and fuel mixture is above tlie fuel"s auto-ignition temperature. In a preferred embodiment, where propane is used, the preheat temperature, as governed by tlie temperature of the heater head, is approximately 1000 K.<br>
Referring again to FIG. 10a, the air and fuel, now mixed, referred to hereafter as "air-fuel mixture" 609, is transitioned in direction through a tliroat 608 which has a contoured fairing 622 and is attached to the outlet 607 of the conduit 601. Throat 608 has an inner radius 614 and an^ outer dimension 616. The transition of the air-fuel mixture is from a direction which is substantially transverse and radially inward with respect to combustion axis 620 to a direction which is substantially parallel to the combustion axis. The contour of the fairing 622 of throat 608 has the shape of an inverted bell such that the cross sectional ai"ca of throat 608 with respect to the combustion axis remains constant from the inlet 611 of the throat to outlet 612 of the throat. The contour is smooth without steps and maintains the flow speed from the outlet of the jiwirler to the outlet of the throat 608 to avoid separation and the resulting recirculation along any of the surfaces. The constant cross sectional area allows the air and fuel to continue to mix without decreasing (he flow speed and causing a pressure drop. A smooth and constant cross section produces an efficient swirler, where swirler efficiency refers to the fraction of static pressure drop across the swirler that is converted to .swirling flow dynamic pres.surc. Swirl efficiencies of better tlian 80% may typically be achieved by practice of the invention. Thus, the parasitic power drain of the combustion air fan may be minimized.<br>
Outlet 612 of the throat flares outward allowing the air-fuel mixture 609 to disperse into the chamber 610 slowing the air-fuel mixture 609 thereby localizing and containing the flame and causing a toroidal flame to form. The rolfitional momcnium generated by the swirler 602 produces a flame stabilizing ring vortex as well known in the art.<br>
The devices and methods described herein may be applied in other applications besides the Stirling engine in terms of which the invention has been described. The described<br><br>
embodiments of the invention are intended to be merely exemplary and numerous variations and modifications will be apparent to those skilled in the art. All such variations and modifications are intended to be within the scope of the present invention as defined in the appended claims.<br><br><br>
