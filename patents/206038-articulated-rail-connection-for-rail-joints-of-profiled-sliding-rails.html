PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br>
7-12-2005<br><br>
ORIGINAL/357/MUMNP/2005<br><br><br>
Description:<br>
The invention relates to an articulate rail connection for rail sections of profile running rails, wherein at least in the upper section area of the neighboring rail sections an articulate connection with at least one bearing cheek bridging the section area is provided.<br>
Such kind of articulate rail connection is described with example in the scope of the DE 198 54 937 C1 or also DE 196 16 937 C1. In both the cases the suspension equipment is integrated in the top articulate connection.<br>
For this purpose within the scope of DE 198 54 937 C1 bearing cheeks bridging the related section area along with retaining adapter between them have been provided. For the end side suspending mounting of one of the joint rails during the course of pre-erection the bearing cheek fixed here can be firmly placed on to the retaining adapter through a rotary locking connection. In the course of the final erection the neighboring other joint rail is placed around the rotary axis located in the lower section area with its other bearing cheek at the retaining adapter as suspended and connected with this<br>
The known measures have proved themselves, but are, what the easy handling and simple erection is concerned, capable of improvement.<br>
The same applicable also for the further status of technology as per DE 196 16 937 C1. Because also here the bearing cheeks bridging the section area have been provided for. A bearing cheek has an oblong hole, which follows a suspension movement of both the profile running rails around suspension axis arranged orthogonal to the rail lengthwise direction in the section area of the lower flange of both the profile running rails. Between both the bearing cheeks a suspension hook is arranged with a guiding bolt grabbing in the aforesaid oblong hole.<br><br><br>
Also at this stage the handling can be improved. Because the said articulate rail connections are deployed normally for guiding and supporting the mono rail suspended trains in underground mining and tunneling work. Suspension chains fixed to individual frames of a headway timbering have the task of bearing the weight of the profile running rails as well as that of transported materials and to transfer on the headway timbering.<br>
In the course of erection it is not only necessary, to couple the individual profile running rails or the rail sections with the help of articulate rail connection to each other, but the rail stretch built up in this manner must be additionally connected through the suspension chains with the headway timbering.<br>
This happens by means of suspension device, which in the simplest case can be a bore for admitting a shackle, a bolt or something similar. That means, the said bore serves normally the purpose of guiding of a suspension element, for example of a chain link or also an interlinked rocker.<br>
Since as per the state of technology on the one hand the articulate connection and on the other hand the suspension devices are clubbed together, during the erection problems can occur. Here the invention intends to create help.<br>
The technical problem is the basis for the invention, an articulate rail connection according to its grouping for rail sections of profile running rails is to be developed further in such a way, that the handling while connecting individual rail sections as well as while suspending track sections built up in this manner at the headway timbering or for equivalent equipment is improved.<br>
For resolving this technical problem the invention suggests for an articulate rail connection of same type, that in addition to the already mentioned bearing cheek at least one bearing cheek is implemented and fixed on one rail section and at least one bearing cheek on another rail section, wherein for linking both the bearing cheeks the flexible interacting third bearing cheek or the strip serves, which - as said earlier -, bridges the section area. In the top section area of neighboring profile running rails also<br><br><br>
two or even all three bearing cheeks bridging the section area can be implemented, wherein two pocket cheeks form one pocket for admitting the third - independent sheet cheek to be fitted subsequently. Critical is the fact, that three bearing cheeks (or more) that form the top articulate connection, of which at least two bearing cheeks are fixed at the rail sections, whereas the third bearing cheek (initially) can move freely and ensures the flexible connection of other two bearing cheeks.<br>
An optional suspension device may assume a position at a distance from the section<br>
area and the articulate connection on the top flange of at least one of the two<br>
neighboring rail sections. That means, at least every second rail section or every second<br>
profile running rail is equipped with the concerned suspension device.<br>
Here the suspension device may be built up independent of and separated from the<br>
articulate connection. However, it is also possible, that the suspension device along<br>
with the articulate connection forms an integral component.<br>
Finally the invention recommends to build up the suspension device as connecting<br>
eyelet for joining an optional extension web and/or a rocker.<br>
As a result an articulate rail connection is created for rail sections of profile running rails, which are - to begin with - characterize themselves through improved handling and erection-friendliness as compared with the current state of technology. Because, based on the suspension device position distancing from the section area and the articulate connection the process of suspension or clamping of profile running rail built up from individual rail sections can be separated time-wise and location-wise from the actual process of connecting of rail sections among themselves. This means, either the rail sections can be first coupled with each other through the respective articulate connection and then suspended or first a rail section can be suspended and then can be connected with the neighboring rail section. This way or that way the invention facilitates a high degree of flexibility and erection-friendliness.<br>
Especially, there is contribution by the fact, that a rail joint can already be hanged and only then it is connected through articulate connection with the neighboring rail joint. This means, the weight of a rail section and then that of the connected neighboring rail<br><br>
section will be borne together by the suspension device, so that the loads to be in comparison to previously known level of technology are considerably reduced.<br>
In all there can be three or more bearing cheeks can be implemented, of which (at a time) two pocket cheeks at a rail section form as a pair in front view a pocket for admitting the third sheet cheek or bearing cheek or strip. In this case the pocket cheeks can be connected with each other on the head side and/or on the toe side through a connecting web. This connecting web may have on its surface facing the pocket a guiding surface for the sheet cheek sliding along. Normally, both the pocket cheeks are further equipped each with a oblong hole, which is penetrated by a guiding bolt, which is carried by the sheet cheek. This guiding bolt protrudes on both sides of the pocket cheeks and is retained with regular fixing methods in the sheet cheek or in both the oblong holes. It is possible, to equip the guiding bolt on the one side with a head and on the other side with a nut. Similarly, single or duel sided securing pins or similar securing arrangements can also be used.<br>
Complementing through this variant of the invention the erection-friendliness vis-a-vis the state of technology as per DE 196 16 937 C1 is increased. Because for connecting the neighboring rail sections in the top section area it is merely necessary, to insert the sheet cheek or the third bearing cheek (which bridges the section area) in or between the pocket cheeks and to insert the guiding bolt through the bore in the sheet cheek aligning with both the oblong holes and to lock the same.<br>
Here the guiding surface at the connecting web ensures, that movements of the rail sections with respect to each other can be admitted smoothly and in guided manner. In addition the oblong holes contribute to this, one of the guiding surface has following contour.<br>
Such movements of the rail sections with respect to each other must be controlled, because the headway timbering is not static and as a result changes in distance and/or angle of rail sections with respect to each other can result from this. Within the scope of this variant it is especially easy and effective, wherein the erection is also simplified.<br><br><br>
Basically in this design arrangement the approach is adopted such, that at least one bearing cheek or one bearing cheek pair or one bearing cheek pair are implemented at one rail section and at least one bearing cheek or one bearing cheek pair is implemented at the other rail section, wherein for connecting both the bearing cheeks (pairs) another bearing cheek (third) or strip serves, which grabs in flexible manner. Here both the respective bearing cheeks or bearing cheek pairs can be formed in fork shape. Also it-has proved to be of advantage, if the additional third cheek or strip is equipped at least on one side with an oblong hole, in order to admit the described articulate movements.<br>
This further design arrangement is equipped with the advantage of an especially economical and erection-friendly manufacturing. Also the additional cheek or strip can be fixed permanently for the transport at one bearing cheek pair or rail section, and that too in such a manner, that there is no projection over the edge of the rail joint. As far as the profile running rails have at least one U shaped lower flange with recess arranged between the U legs; then beyond this at least in the lower section area of neighboring rail sections with a drag bearing shell and drag bearing leaf grabbing herein can be implemented. Herein the drag bearing shell arranged in the recess in the lower flange, so that the drag bearing shell is fixed without machining in the recess. For this purpose the drag bearing shell may have a recess for a swiveling nose arranged on the drag bearing leaf. The drag bearing shell preferably also has stoppers protruding in the recess and back-grabbed by the swiveling nose in the installation condition.<br>
These stoppers can define the above said recess together with a limiting block, wherein stoppers and limiting blocks are coupled with each other through connecting webs, so that the necessary stability of the drag bearing shell is set.<br>
Further, the drag bearing shell can be designed as split in lengthwise direction and can consist of two in installation condition connected - especially welded - drag bearing shell halves, what/however, is not compulsory. It is also thinkable, also the drag bearing leaf to be designed as split in lengthwise direction and to admit it un-machined in the lower section area of the other neighboring rail section. Then two drag bearing leaf halves are implemented, which are united during the installation with each other.<br><br>
These measures as per the invention are linked with further advantage, that in contrast to the state of technology as per DE 198 54 937 C1 and also DE 196 16 937 C1 obligatory machining of the lower flange of the respective rail section to be equipped with the drag bearing shells not necessary (any more). Rather, the drag bearing shell built up as based on invention can be directly added and welded there especially in the recess existing as it is in the I-profile running rails between the U-leg of the U-shaped lower flange. This amounts to a enormous ease during erection and cost saving.<br>
Even then the efficiency of the described drag bearing shell is not impaired in any manner, but is equal to that, as is described in the category building state of technology as per DE 198 54 937 C1 or DE 196 16 937 C1. Here the stoppers back-grabbed by the swiveling nose in conjunction with the limiting block ensure a smooth making of an articulate connection.<br>
Because for this purpose it is merely essential, to insert the drag bearing leaf in the drag bearing shell, so that the swiveling nose grabs in the recess and back-grabs the stoppers. To allow movements of rail sections with respect to each other to be compensated, swiveling nose and stoppers have in the area of lower articulate connection guiding surfaces matching each other and sliding along each other. Thereby, in conjunction with a conventional or with - as described previously - a built up top articulate connection movements of rail sections with respect to each other can be adopted without any problems. The point of rotation in this context is always below the running surface in the lower flange. At the top flange the suspension device already mentioned can be guided in the form of a rocker, which has at least one bore for unloading. This articulate and previously known rail connection through the DE 198 54 937 CI characterizes itseK by the fact, that in addition to the bore for unloading an erection aid equipment has been provided.<br>
This erection aid facility can be in the form of an erection aid bore for admitting an erection aiding bolt long with erection aids located on it, e. g. chain, rope etc.. in this context the erection aid device can be arranged on a symmetry level on head side of the<br><br>
rocker. The rocker itself has normally two flanges, which are spaced out from each other by means of one or more spacer pieces.<br>
In this manner a rocker is made available, which can be fitted easily along with the rail section/s fitted to it with the headway timbering. Because, in the core the erection aid device takes care of it, which allows, to lift the respective rail section or the rail sections already connected with each other to the desired level in the headway timbering and only then to undertake the unloading. This can be done for example with rope winches, chain lifters or other lifting devices, which grab at the erection aid facilities or which form these. In the easiest case this is an erection aid bore with erection aid bolt or a shackle admitted in it, to which an erection aid device is connected, which can be - just to give an example - a chain, a rope etc..<br>
Through the arrangement of the erection aid facility at the symmetry level on the head side of the rocker it is achieved, that the lifting personnel grab normally in or near the section area of the rail sections, because the rocker is mounted mostly symmetrical in comparison to this section area, that means symmetry level of the rocker and section area coincide. At the end, the two-flange build-up of the rocker ensures, that there is particular torsion rigidity and also changing tensile forces due to changes of the headway timbering are admitted without any problems.<br>
At the end, the profile running rails normally have in the cross section fork shaped top flange and in the reverse case fork shaped bottom flange. These can have an I-shaped cross section. Thereby, high resistance torque at reduced production costs and simplified manipulation in the rail erection can be implemented. Implement manipulation at the time of rail erection. The individual rail sections of the profile running rail are made available as rolled steel profile and have specifications, as these have been described in the scope of DE 296 04 431 The leaf cheek or the third bearing cheek or strip may be fixed in transport position of the rail sections at both the pocket cheeks of a pocket cheek pair at one rail section. Thereby, the leaf cheek or the third bearing cheek or strip is permanently connected with the concerned rail section. Both the pocket cheeks and bearing cheeks can be connected mainly in V shape with their<br><br>
foot at the top flange. It is understood that the top flange and the foot of pocket cheeks are suitably designed, so that in place of this a welded joint can be planned.<br>
The third leaf cheek or bearing cheek or strip is normally fixed at a rail section and grabs with a hook a stopper at other rail section. For this purpose the concerned third leaf cheek or the bearing cheek or strip is equipped with a fixing area and a grabbing area. The fixing area serves for fixing of bearing cheek or strip, whereas the grabbing area has a hook, which interacts with the stopper at the other rail section.<br>
This is resolved in detail such a way, that the bend recess limited through the hook slides along the concerned stopper under definition of a maximum possible swiveling angle of both the rail sections with respect to each other. For this purpose a sliding surface of bend recess has been allocated to the hook.<br>
The described articulate rail connection always characterizes itself by the fact, that first a profile running rail or a rail section is suspended and only then the erection of another rail section is undertaken with the implementation of the rail connection. Here the second rail section can be advantageously joined via the lower articulate connection first with the lower rail section and receives then a permanent joint with the help of additional third cheek or strip.<br>
In the following the invention is explained more in detail on the basis of a drawing merely representing a design version; the figures show as follows:<br>

In the figures a rail connection for rail sections la, lb of profile running rails has been shown. The rail sections la, lb have been designed within the scope of the execution example in I shaped execution form with a top flange 2 and a bottom flange 4 forming a running surface 3. On the running surface 3 wheels of individual carriages of monorail suspended train are guided and moved forward. This is, however, not compulsory.<br>
As evident from the Fig. lb, 2b, 3b and 15 the top flange 2 as well as the bottom flange 4 have in the transverse section one each of pocket shaped recess 5. In this manner, the I-shaped rail sections la, lb have been executed with a top flange 2 mainly in U form with U legs 6 and recess 5 arranged between them. The same is applicable for the bottom flange 4, which has a reverse U-shaped profile with relevant U-legs 6, which admit between themselves the recess 5.<br>
On the basis of Fig. 1, 6, 7 and 13, 14 one can find, that at the top flange 2 of the one profile running rail la at least one 6, 7 and 13, 14 one recognizes, that on one profile running rail la at least one suspension device 7 has been planned. Beyond this the top as well as the lower section area S of the neighboring rail sections la, lb each have articulate connections 8, 9.<br>
The suspension device 7 assumes a position distancing from the section area S and the articulate connection 8, 9 at the top flange 2. Here the suspension device 7 is arranged on at least one of the two neighboring rail sections la,lb.<br><br>
Within the scope of the execution example the suspension device 7 is on a rail section la. Basically the suspension device 7 could be additionally (or alternatively) fixed also at the other rail section lb.<br>
After an initial design, as is shown in the Fig. 1 and 13, 14, the suspension device 7 is executed independent and separate from the articulate connection 8, 9 - in the represented It is, however, also example of the top articulate connection 8.possible, that the suspension device 7 together with the articulate connection 8, 9, ahead of the top articulate connection 8, forms an integral component. This is shown by the Fig. 6 and 7 to 10.<br>
In detail the suspension device 7 is connecting eyelet 7, to which an optional extension web 10 and a rocker 11 can be connected(refer Fig. 1, 6, 7 and 13, 14). It is understood, that the extension web 10 and the rocker 11 are connected in hinge arrangement with each other, so that movements of the rail sections la, lb with respect to each other can be received. Similarly, it is also thinkable and will also be covered by the invention thoughts, if extension web 10 and rocker 11 are executed as a single piece. That means, merely the suspension device 7 or the connecting eyelet 7 takes care of the necessary hinge movement. Because rocker 11 and extension web 10 then form a unit.<br>
On the basis of Fig. lb one recognizes, that the recess 5 in the top flange 2 receives the connecting eyelet 7 between the U-legs 6. For this purpose the connecting eyelet 7 is component of a fixing web 12, which is connected in the recess 5 or between the legs 6 at the top flange 2. This is usually done through welding.<br>
The fixing web 12 with the connecting eyelet 7 is now grabbed by two flanges 13 of the extension web 10. A hinge pin grabbing through aligned bores serves in place of this as described hinged joint. Within the scope of the variant as per Fig. 6 the fixing web 12 there forms together with two pocket cheeks and bearing cheeks 14 an integral component; as is described below with more details.<br><br><br>
In the design as per Fig. 7 to 10 and 13,14 both the pocket cheeks and bearing cheeks 14 are connected with the rail section la, whereas the extension web 10 grabs between the pocket cheeks 14. This is also applicable for a third leaf cheek 15 and strip 15, as is described below with more details.<br>
Within the scope of the variant as per Fig. 1 to 6 in the top section area S of neighboring rail sections la, lb in all three bearing cheeks 14, 15 bridging the section area S are implemented. These three bearing cheeks 14, 15 are on the one hand already referred both the pocket cheeks 14, which in the front view (compare especially Fig. 3b) for a pocket 16 for admitting and on the other hand the third leaf cheek 15. Here, within the scope of the variant as per Fig. 1 to 5 the leaf cheek 15 is brought at a section rail la, whereas the other rail section lb carries both the pocket cheeks 14. In this case both the cheeks 14, 15 form one each of the bearing cheek 15 at one rail section la and one bearing cheek 14 or first pocket cheek 14 at the other rail section lb. Further, the third bearing cheek 14 appears in form of second pocket cheek 14, which bridges the top section area S.<br>
In the variant as per Fig. 6 there is a reverse arrangement. That means both the pocket cheeks 14 are fitted at one section rail la, whereas the other rail section lb carries the third leaf cheek or bearing cheek 15. In turn both the bearing cheeks 14,15 are on the one hand at a rail section la and at other rail section lb, wherein on the other hand additionally the third bearing cheek 14 is implemented in the shape of "the second pocket cheek 14. Both the pocket cheeks 14 form in the representation as per Fig. 6along with fixing web 12 also implemented there with the connecting eyelet 7 an integral component, whereas the other rail section lb carries the leaf cheek 15.<br>
Finally, in the design as per Fig. 7 to 10 and 13 to 15 the third or additional leaf cheek 15 is designed as independent component and is admitted on the one hand between both the pocket cheeks 14 and on the other hand between two additional cheeks or pocket cheeks 34 at the other rail section lb. One recognizes, that the respective bearing cheeks or bearing cheek pairs 14, 34 are built-up in fork shape (compare Fig. 8 and 10,15). The strip or other leaf cheek 15 has at least on one side an oblong hole 35 or an arch shaped<br><br>
recess, which at this place ensures the required hinge movement (compare Fig. 9 and 12).<br>
Especially on the basis of Fig. 3a, 3b one recognizes, that both the pocket cheeks 14 are connected on the head side with each other through a connecting web 17. This connecting web 17 forms on its surface directed to the pocket 16 a guiding surface 18 for the leaf cheek 15 sliding along here with its head. Oblong holes 19 in both the pocket cheeks 14 ensure, that both the pocket cheeks 14 can have hinge connection with the leaf cheek 15, namely a merely indicated guiding pin 20 penetrates both the oblong holes 19 in the  pocket cheeks 14 and a bore 21 in the leaf cheek 15.<br>
In the Fig. 3a one can best recognize, that the guiding surface 18 and both the oblong holes 19 have a slightly bent contour matched with each other. Thereby, it is ensured, that the top articulate connection 8 built up mainly from both the pocket cheeks 14 and leaf cheek 15 grabbing between these can compensate relative movements of the rail sections la, lb with respect to each other.<br>
The bottom articulate connection 9 and its detail structure is described now with reference to especially the Fig. 3a and 3b. It can be recognized in the bottom section area S of the neighboring rail sections la, lb that first a drag bearing shell or drag bearing pocket 22 interacts with a drag bearing leaf 23 grabbing in this and shown in the figures 2a und 2b. Herein the drag bearing shell 22 is placed in the recess 5 of the other profile section lb between both the U legs 6 at the lower flange 4. This is done without any machining, i.e., without requiring the U leg 6 to be processed in any manner prior to welding of drag bearing shell 22. The respective rail section lb with I shape profile according to DE 296 04 431 Ul remains, therefore, un-machined.<br>
The same is applicable also for the drag bearing leaf 23, which is also fitted without machining in the recess 5 between both the U legs 6, and that means - like the drag bearing shell 22 - at the bottom flange 4, however, now at one rail section la and on the profile section la. In this manner, the respective rail sections or profile sections la, lb with the U shape top flange 2 and the reverse U shape bottom flange 4 can be equipped<br><br>
after rolling without rework with the respective articulate connections 8, 9,which influences the finishing costs especially in positive way.<br>
The drag bearing shell 22 - as can be seen from Fig. 3 and 5 - has a recess 24 for a swiveling nose 25 arranged on the drag bearing leaf 23. In addition the drag bearing shell 22 possesses in the recess 24 stoppers 26 projecting and which have been grabbed by the swiveling nose 25 in the installation condition. These stoppers 26 define together with one limiting block 27 the recess 24. The stoppers 26 and the limiting block 27 are coupled through connecting web 28.<br>
Especially on the basis of Fig. 3b and 5 it can be recognized, that the drag bearing shell 22 is overall structured in mirror image symmetry to an axis A and is composed of two drag bearing shell halves. Both these drag bearing shell halves are connected on the one hand with U leg 6 and on the other hand with another U leg 6, it is welded with this within the scope of execution example. The same is applicable for the drag bearing leaf 23, which is also structured as symmetric in mirror image to axis A, however, possesses a single piece execution form and is connected at both the U legs 6(compare Fig. 2b).<br>
Because the outer contour of the drag bearing shell 22 is matched with the inner contour of the recess 5 between both the U legs 6 of the bottom flange 4, (compare Fig. 3b) the drag bearing shell 22 is inserted without machining in the concerned recess 5 and is connected with the legs 6. The stoppers 26 at the drag bearing shell 22 and the swiveling nose 25 at the drag bearing leaf 23 have corresponding arch shape guiding surfaces 29, which ensure, that also the bottom articulate connection 9 can follow all kinds of movements of the rail sections or section rails la, lb with respect to each other without any problems and can be guided herein.<br>
As has been detailed in the introductory portion, the top flange 2 of the represented articulate rail connection with both the articulate connections 8, 9 has at least one suspension device in the form of rocker 11 (compare Fig. 6, 7 and 13,14). This rocker 11 has now within the scope of the execution example at least one anchoring hole 30, which serves the purpose, to couple the rocker 11 with the help of a chain or an<br><br>
equivalent connecting means with the track extension. Within the scope of the execution example the rocker 11 is executed overall in symmetry in comparison with a Symmetry axis B, wherein two anchoring holes 30 have been realized, which, however, is not compulsory. In addition to this anchoring hole 30 there is one more erection aid equipment 31.<br>
This erection aid equipment 31 is within the scope of representation an erection aid bore 31 for receiving a merely indicated erection aid bolt along with erection aid device 32 located on it. This erection aid device can be a chain, a rope or a similar lifting device.<br>
On the basis of Fig.6 it can be recognized, that the erection aid facility 31 is arranged at the symmetry level B on the head side of the rocker 11. Thereby, lifting forces act in direct extension of guiding point of the rocker 11, which is the connecting eyelet 7 at the fixing web 12.<br>
It is, further, to be noted, that the rocker 11 has two flanges 11a, l1b, which are spaced out from each other by means one or more spacer 33. In this manner the rockerll can be designed torsion-free, and that too at relatively low weight. Here rockers 11 of totally variable design and with changing distance of the respective anchoring bores 30 can be implemented and deployed, as this is made clear by the exploded image of a rocker 11 and its change form marked by the dotted line. In both the cases the position of the erection aid facility 31 is retained in most of its form.<br>
In the variant as per Fig. 7 to 10 and 13 to 15 - as already executed - two bearing cheek pairs 14 and 34 are planned in fork shaped design, which admit between themselves another bearing Cheek or strip 15.<br>
This strip or additional cheek 15 ensures with its oblong hole 35 and the arch shaped recess 38, that swiveling movements in the section area S can be received without problems between both the rail sections la, lb. Because the oblong hole 35 is penetrated like the relevant bearing cheek pair 14 by the bolt 20.<br><br>
The establishment of the rail connection is mostly undertaken such a way, that the bearing cheeks 14 or the bearing cheek pair 14 connected with a rail section la is first-suspended by means of suspension device 7, extension web 10 and the rocker 11. Thereafter, the other rail section lb can be suspended at the already fixed rail section la, by drag bearing shell 22 and drag bearing leaf 23 grabbing in each other. Basically, at this point, of course another bottom articulate connection 9 can be implemented.<br>
Thereafter, the additional cheek or strip 15 between both the cheek pairs, on the one hand 14 and on the other hand 34 can be positioned and fixed by means of bolts penetrating corresponding bores. Here an optional and not compulsory nose 36 at the cheek or strip 15 can ensure, that the cheek 15 assumes its required position. Because the nose 36 grabs in a related recess 37 in the other rail section lb (compare Fig. 7 and 9). In all these processes the additional cheek or strip 15 retains its independence. It can be fixed at a rail section la, lb. Normally, however, at this place a clamp or screw connection with the bearing cheek pair 14 or 34, as is shown in the Fig. 13, 14 is sufficient.<br>
Within the scope of Fig. 11 and 12 a modification of execution form according to Fig. 7 to 10 is shown. Because, there the bearing cheek or strip 15 is not equipped with an oblong hole 35, in order to receive swiveling movements in the section area S between both the rail sections la, lb without any problems. Actually at this place the arch shaped recess 38 ensures, that the described swiveling movements can be controlled. Besides, the bearing cheek or strip 15 on its die facing both the rail sections la, lb is equipped with an arch shaped leg 39, which is received in correspondingly shaped pockets 40 in the bearing cheek pair 14 and 34 respectively.<br>
The Figures 13 to 15 show another variant of the invention. Also in this case two bearing cheek pairs 14, 34 are provided in fork shaped form, which take up between themselves another third bearing cheek or leaf cheek or strip 15.<br>
This means, two each of bearing cheeks or pocket cheeks 14, 34 form the bearing cheek pair 14, 34 already referred to. For the transport of both the rail sections la, lb another bearing cheek or strip 15 is permanently fixed to a rail section la, lb, within the scope of<br><br>
the execution example to the rail section lb. In this case the bearing cheek 15 does not protrude, as a result it cannot be removed (compare dotted line drawing in Fig. 14). Like in case of other execution examples the respective pocket cheeks 14 and 34 respectively are connected mainly in V-shape with their leg at the top flange 2 of the concerned rail section la, lb.<br>
On the basis of representation in the Fig. 12 and 14 it can be recognized, that the strip or third bearing cheek 15 has a fixing area 15a and a grabbing area 15b or it is divided in both the areas 15a, 15b. The fixing area 15a ensures, that the strip 15 is fixed at the rail section lb. Along with the grabbing area 15b the bolt or guiding bolt 20 interacts, which in this context acts a stopper. This guiding bolt 20 connects both the pocket cheeks 14 with each other.<br>
In contrast to the execution example as per Fig. 6, however, the leaf cheek 15 is not penetrated.<br>
It can be recognized, that the arch shaped recess 38 of the strip 15 changes over to a sliding surface 41 and has this surface. With the sliding surface 41 interacts a hook 42, which limits this. Additionally one more stopper 43 is implemented, which overall limits the possible swiveling angle of both the rail sections la, lb through the interaction of hook 42 and stopper 43 with each other. This is expressed through the comparison of Fig. 13 and 14. Actually, both the rail sections la, lb can counter move around a point of rotation D below the run surface 3 of the bottom flange 4, wherein swiveling angle a of overall up to about 10 to 150 are possible.<br>
This kind of swiveling movements between the rail sections la, lb are expressly permitted, because the guiding bolt 20 can move back and forth between the hook 42 and the stopper 43 along the slide surface 41. Here the sliding surface 41 additionally ensures, that the horizontal counter sweep of both the rail sections la, lb continues. For this purpose the sliding surface 41 has a bend, which is defined by the gap between the point of rotation D. That means the bend in the sliding surface 41 corresponds a circular<br><br>
bend with a radius, which is equal to the distance between the point of rotation D and the guiding bolt 20.<br>
On the basis of the supplementary representations in the Fig.l6a, b und c it becomes clear, how both the rail sections la, lb can have horizontal counter sweep, and that under consideration of the point of rotation D, which is arranged below the run surface 3 of the bottom flange 2. Here the maximum passable swiveling angle a corresponds to the fact that the drag bearing leaf 23 or the corresponding guiding surfaces 29 of the swiveling nose 25 can also pass over a corresponding swiveling angle 13 vis-a-vis the stoppers 26 at the drag bearing shell 22.<br>
Like in case of slide surface 41, also here the radiuses of guiding surfaces 29 and stoppers 26 are matched with the distance from the point of rotation D, in order to be able to complete a jamming-free swiveling motion. Both the angles α and β are mostly same.<br><br>
