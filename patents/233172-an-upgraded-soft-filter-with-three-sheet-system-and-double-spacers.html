The other end of this tubing which is at right angle to this, will have a small sheet (fig 4b) which is an integral part of it. The bore of this tubing will be opening in this sheet (Fig 4b). This may be made by injection moulding. The sheet part (Fig 4b) of the inlet port (fig 4) is RF welded to the inlet chamber soft PVC sheet ( fig 8). Outlet port: An out let port (fig 5) is made by injection moulding of medical grade soft PVC. The internal diameter of the outlet port ( fig. 5) will be suitable for fixing the tubing of the blood bag system for inline or the tubing of the bed side filtration system. The outlet port (fig 5) will be RF welded on the periphery at the lowest/ bottom most level of the filter to enable free outflow of the filtered blood/ its components.<br>
Three sheet system: In the present invention, a three number medical grade soft PVC sheet system is introduced to make the filter device. Three numbers medical grade soft PVC sheets will comprise of one inlet chamber sheet (Fig 1), one blanked middle sheet (Fig 2) and one out let chamber sheet (fig 3).<br>
The blanked middle soft PVC sheet (fig 2) enables on one side the independent RF sealing of the inlet chamber soft PVC sheet (fig 8) sandwiching the filter media (fig 7) and the blanked middle soft PVC sheet (fig 2) and on the other side, the independent RF sealing of the blanked middle soft PVC sheet (fig 2) and outlet chamber soft PVC sheet (fig 3). This independent RF sealing minimizes the leakage from the filter. It also enables sealing of inlet chamber on to the periphery of the outlet chamber with the filter media sandwiched in between, there by exposing maximum filter area for higher recovery of leukoreduced blood or its components and reducing the time of filtration. The provision of the middle sheet enables the outlet port to be sealed on the periphery enabling in to easy/ user-friendly maximum removal of filtered blood/ its components from the outlet chamber , resulting in to higher yields in lesser time and giving higher outputs per unit area of the filter media.<br>
Spacers: The two number spacers introduced in this invention, may be made in the form of mesh (6b) or beads chain (6a) or any other shape. One spacer (fig 6a/6b) is provided in the inlet chamber (fig 12a) between the filter media (fig 7) and the inlet chamber sheet (fig 8) and the second spacer (fig 6a/6b) is provided in the out let chamber (fig 12b) between the filter media (fig 7) and the out let chamber sheet (fig 3). The spacers may be soft/ rigid, flexible or non flexible or semi flexible. The material for the construction of the spacers can be<br>
metals or their alloys for example stainless steel, titanium etc. The stainless steel grade can be SS 316-L, SS-316 or SS 304. For plastic, soft flexible plastic for example medical grade soft PVC or rigid plastic Polypropylene or Polycarbonate may be used. The material of the construction will be capable of bearing, without any deformation, the autoclaving/ sterilization conditions.<br>
The spacers may be soft or rigid in metal or plastic and in mesh or bead or any other form. In the case of bead chain spacer (6a), the two ends may be connected together with two connecting rings provided at the ends (Fig 6a). This may be injection moulded using soft PVC or any other suitable material. The spacer one (Fig 6) in between the filter media (fig 7) and the inlet chamber sheet (fig 8) provide enough flow space without any constriction and expose entire filter area of filter membrane set for filtration to enhance the leukocyte reduction efficiency per unit area of the filtration membrane. The spacer two in between the filtration media (fig 7) and the out let chamber sheet (fig 3) provide enough space for the entry of filtered blood or its components in to the outlet chamber and to get collected and flow out of the outlet port (fig 5) provided at the periphery of the outlet chamber (fig 12b) and give high yields / recovery of filtered leukoreduced blood or its components. The outlet port provided at the periphery results in to easy flow out of the filtered blood or its components there by making it more convenient and user friendly. The spacers also reduce the time of filtration and minimize the<br>
clogging or chocking of the filter membranes. With the space in both the inlet chamber and the out let chamber provided by the spacers, the flow of the blood is more uniform over the entire area of the filter media and the leukocyte reduction efficiency per unit area of the filter membrane is higher. In addition, the design of the spacer is such that there is no constriction to the flow of blood or its components as a result of which a combination of the filter membranes non woven or other wise can be used for effective leukocyte reduction. The spacer also provides higher flow rates of blood / its components during the filtration there by completing the process in lesser time.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
