This invention relates to a method and device for the continuous automatic monitoring and control of the tension to which yarn is subjected during its winding in a textile machine, in particular in an automaiic bobbin winding unit.<br>
It is known that in the textile industry each package of yarn spun in a ring spinning machine is fed in the next production stage to an automatic bobbin winding unit, where it is rewound to form a bobbin of substantially cylindrical or frusto-conical shape. The yarn is firstly extracted from the underlying package by pulling, to then pass through a tensioning device to subject the yarn to a constant tension necessary for correct winding onto the bobbin under formation.<br>
In a bobbin winding unit with a grooved drive toller, the tendency to increase winding speed to advantageously achieve increased production results in a considerable increase in yarn tensioning, to the extent that the yarn can undergo breakage.  Moreover in practice, as is well known to the expert of the art, when a yarn tension level has been set its average value does not remain<br><br>
constant.  It is well known that during the to-and-fro travel of the yarn as it distributes itself along the surface of the bobbin under formation, small short-lasting oscillations in the yarn tension can occur, but generally these are innocuous because they settle about an average value, it being necessary only to control the yarn tension at a preset constant average value.  The reasons why the average tension does not remain constant include the increase in the diameter of the wound yarn on the bobbin under formation, the unwinding of the last part of the yarn wound on the feed package, and the presence of dust and trash on the slide guides at the various support points along the path of the yarn being transferred from the underlying package to the overlying bobbin.  In addition the average tension is influenced by the type and nature of the yarn being wound and the temperature of the surrounding atmosphere, so that the yarn has to be tensioned taking account of the aforesaid operating parameters in order to establish tension values such that the yarn is always in an elastically taut condition.  Otherwise, each time the yarn breaks by separation due to excessive tensioning, the winding operation has to be interrupted to effect a yarn joining process, the winding efficiency of the bobbin winding unit hence undergoing a considerable decrease.  At the same time a poor quality bobbin is formed because of the presence of frequent knots, which give rise to difficulties in further operations involving the bobbin. Yarn braking washers are known which operate with brake shoes to generate, by means of a structure of known construction, a preliminary set tension in the travelling yarn.  These known<br><br>
devices have various drawbacks.  The yarn-braking washers acting on the yarn exert on them a braking force which cannot be exactly defined, and a change in the yarn tension cannot be easily achieved because of the aforesaid reasons.  Moreover the known devices require constant and periodic maintenance. The present invention eliminates these drawbacks by providing a method for monitoring and controlling the tension to which the yarn in an automatic bobbin winding unit is subjected along its travel path in which the clamping force exerted by the braking 'ashers on the yarn is continuously and automatically controliec .t a value depending on predetermined quantities defining both the ype of yarn being wound and the operational, technical and ;eonietrical characteristics of the unwinding of the package and .hose of the bobbin under formation.<br>
n the method of the invention the type of yarn being wound is .efined by values indicating its irregularities, its average .iameter and the nature of its constituent fibres.  In addition, ccording to the method the operational, technical and geometrical haracteristics of the unwinding of the package are defined by the velocity of extraction of the yarn from the feed package and the dimensions and shape of the package itsslf.<br>
The operational, technical and geometrical characteristics of the bobbin under formation are defined by the yarn tension measured by a sensor along the travel path, the quantity of yarn wound on the bobbin, and the bobbin dimensions and shape.<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a device for monitoring and controlling the tension of a yarn in a yam path from a feed package to a bobbin in an automatic bobbin winding unit, comprising; opposable braking washers in the yam path which impress a clamping action on the yam a shaft having a first end and a second end, herein said first end is connected to one of said washers characterized in it has a magnetic cylinder connected to said second end of said shaft a rectilinear hollow s(^Â«ioid having an electrical wiiuiing at least partiaUy surroundii^ said magnetic cylinder for generating a magnetic field, said magnetic cylinder being positioned at one end of said electrical winding u^ierein said magnetic field is substantially linear and its force acting on said magnetic cylinder is substantially constant regardless of yam irregularities; and electrical means having an output connected to said electrical winding Soi regulating the current thereto in accordance with predetermined criteria for adjusting the amount of tension applied to the yam independent of the distance between said opposable braking washers.<br>
The invention will now be described in more detail with reference to embodiments given by way of example and shown in the accompanying drawings, in which;<br>
Figure 1 is an overall schematic view of the device of the present<br><br>
invention incorporated into an individual bobbin winding station,<br>

sensors, the monitoring probes, the drive source for the grooved<br>
roller, the known devices along the path of the yarn unwinding<br>
from the underlying package and the keyboard are all in operation<br>
and are connected to the control unit;<br>

yarn to be inserted or extracted or to allow the washers to be<br>

tensioning device of the present invention at the moment in which<br>
the moving yarn present between the braking washers is<br>
advantageously subjected to a clamping force;<br>
Figure 4 is a graph showing the axial movement of the magnetic<br>
cylinder within the rectilinear hollow solenoid as a function of<br>
the magnetic field within the solenoid;<br>
Figure 5 is a schematic enlarged view showing the lines of<br>
magnetic force involved in the linkage between the magnetic<br>
cylinder and the rectilinear solenoid.<br>
In the figures, equal elements or elements of equal or equivalent<br>
function carry the same reference characters for simplicity.<br>
Those devices and mechanisms operating in mutual cooperation with<br>
the device of the present invention are not shown, neither is<br>
their operation described, in that these are already known and do<br>
not concern the operation of the invention.<br><br>
In an automatic bobbin winding unit shown schematicaliy in Figure 1, the yarn 2 extracted from a package 1 is drawn upwards by known devices to be joined in perfect continuity to the end of the yarn wound on the the bobbin 5, to commence the known rewinding of the yarn 2, ie the transfer of the yarn 2 from the underlying package<br>
1	to the overlying bobbin 5.  As it unwinds from the package 1, the yarn 2 drawn upwards by the drive roller 4 results in 3 gradual and continuous reduction in the wound yarn until the yarn<br>
2	has been completely unwound from the feed package I.  The state of the unwinding is monitored by the photoelectric cell 10, which generates an electrical position signal which is fed through the cable 20 to the control unit 24.<br>
The yarn 2 leaving the package 1 travels rapidly upwards through a series of devices, including the yarn tensioning washers 12 and 13 of the device of the present invention, a tension sensor 9 and the electronic yarn clearer 3, which acts as a device for automatically monitoring yarn presence and actively controlling the cleaning function of an electronic yarn cleaner in the individual bobbin winding station of Figure 1.<br>
The electronic clearer 3 can be of conventional construction and can contain an electrical or capacitive sensor-transducer as the yarn feeling or exploration device.  The yarn 2 is wound onto the bobbin 5 under formation by the drive source 7, preferably a three-phase electric motor, which via a variable frequency inverter rotates the drive roller 4 to provide the to-and-fro transverse movement to the yarn 2 unwound from the underlying package 1, and to rotate the bobbin 5 under formation.  During the<br><br>
unwinding the disc probes 8 and 6 sense the rotation of the drive roller 4 and bobbin 5 to generate electrical pulses which are fed to the control unit 24- via cables 23 and 22.  The control unit 24 uses said rotation pulses to exactly control the rotational speed of the roller 4 during its various predetermined operating stages and to measure the quantity of yarn 2 wound on the bobbin 5 under formation.  The tension sensor 9 which moment by moment measures the tension of the yarn travelling between the package and the bobbin continuously transmits said value, in the form of an electrical signal, to the control unit 24 via the electric cable 19.<br>
Said electrical signals entering the control unit 24 are amplified and compared with reference values fed into said unit 24 via the keyboard 11 and the connection cable 21.<br>
The control unit 24 is based on a miniprocessor able to memorize the operator's instructions and transform said instructions into a program for execution by its computing and processing centre to provide the numerical and graphical results required during the entire winding process.  Said numerical and graphical results are then stored in the memory of said control unit 24, which specifically controls the yarn tensioning device of the present invention.  Each time the electrical signals originating from the tension sensor 9 and entering the control unit 24 differ from the reference values of the range of allowable values, the control unit 24 generates output electrical signals which via the electric cable 18 actuate and control the clamping force of the braking washers 12 and 13 on the yarn 2, provided by the electromagnet 15,<br><br>
The range of allowable tension values of the travelling yarn is established by a processing operation by the miniprocessor of the unit 24, which uses both the operator's instructions fed in via the keyboard 11 regarding the type of yarn being wound, and the values of the electrical pulses generated by the sensor 10 and by the disc probes 6 and 8.  The said input electrical pulses continuously provide the operational, technical and geometrical characteristics of the unwinding of the package 1 and those of the bobbin 5 under formation.<br>
The said electrical signals leaving the control unit 24 via the cable 18 activate and control an electrical power unit 17 which generates an electric current flow, advantageously stabilized and smoothed by the amplifier 16, passing through the energization winding 28 acting on the magnetic cylinder 29, which generates a thrust proportional to the current through the solenoid 28.  The thrust is transmitted via the shaft 30 to the movable washer 13, which advances axially to impress a clamping action on the travelling yarn 2.  The clamping action is controlled and set continuously by the current intensity through the winding 28, which when traversed by current generates a magnetic field substantially linear at its ends (see Figures 4 and 5) because of its rectilinear configuration.<br>
The magnetic cylinder 29, which during clamping is positioned at one end of the rectilinear hollow solenoid 28, is subjected to a virtually constant force.  In the application claimed herein, the force acting on the magnetic cylinder 29 will therefore be constant about the end of the rectilinear solenoid.<br><br>
As the magnetic field produced within the solenoid is proportional to the traversing current, the force on the magnetic cylinder is also proportional to the current.  The direction of the force on the cylinder 29 depends on the direction of the magnetic force within the solenoid 28, which is protected by the cover 27.  An opposite force can hence be achieved on the magnetic cylinder 29 such as to generate a movement which withdraws the braking washers 12 and 13 from each other sufficiently to facilitate the insertion or extraction of the yarn 2 between or from the washers (see Figure 2).<br>
The washer 12 is advantageously rigidly mounted on the shaft 31 and the entire yarn tensioning device is rigidly connected to the structure of the winding station by support elements 25 and 26. While the magnetic cylinder 29 is within the end region of the solenoid the yarn tensioning device of the invention is not influenced by variations in the diameter of the yarn 2 being wound, the presence of the damping disc?advantageously contributing to nullifying any oscillation caused by more or less accentuated irregularities in the yarn undergoing the bobbin winding process.<br>
