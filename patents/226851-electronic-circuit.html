Electronic circuit<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
Technical field<br>
The present invention is concerned with the field of power electronics. It relates to an electronic circuit and a power semiconductor module according to the preamble of patent claims 1 and 6, respectively.<br>
Prior art<br>
In conventional power semiconductor modules, two or more, generally identical, power semiconductor switches are often connected in parallel in order to achieve a desired total current capacity. In this case, it must be ensured that a total current flowing through the power semiconductor module at any point in time is distributed as uniformly as possible between the individual power semiconductor switches in order to prevent a current capacity of an individual power semiconductor switch from being exceeded. Switching operations, in particular, are critical in this context since during these operations a feedback from output sides to driving sides of the power semiconductor switches may lead to a nonuniform dynamic current division. This is explained below with reference to figure 1. Figure 1 shows a circuit diagram of a power semiconductor module having three power semiconductor switches connected in parallel according to the prior art, which is produced for example in the case of an asymmetrical layout of three insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBT) Ta, T2 and T3. In this case, parasitic emitter-side inductances LE,i, Ls,2 and LE,3 have different values on account of different geometries of corresponding electrically conductive connections between the respective emitter terminal Elt<br><br>
E2 or E3 and a node C. During a switching operation, different voltages are induced across the inductances LE,I, LE/2 and LE/3 on account of the different values of said inductances. In the present case where LE,I = LBf3 &gt; LE/2, this results in a dynamic circulating current, that is to say a current flow from emitter terminal Ex or E3 to emitter terminal E2, as is illustrated by broken arrows in figure 1. This current flow in turn generates different voltage drops URtl, UR/2 and URf3 across emitter resistances RE/'i, RE,2 and REi3 and thus different gate voltages UG/1, UG,2 and UG/3 at the IGBTs Ti, T2, and T3. The different gate voltages UGtl/ UG/2 and UG,3 finally effect oscillations, circulating currents and the abovementioned nonuniform dynamic current division, which leads to a reduction of a switching capacity relative to a theoretically possible value ("derating").<br>
Various methods are known which enable this nonuniform dynamic current division to be counteracted.<br>
Firstly, separate driving in conjunction with output-side decoupling by means of additional inductive or resistive components, by means of which the different values of the inductances LEflf LE/2 and LE/3 are compensated for, is taken into consideration. However, such a solution leads to an increased space requirement, also to increased costs in the case of large currents on account of requirements made of the components.<br>
It is also conceivable in each case to effect a hard, direct connection both of the output sides and of the driving sides, the driving sides preferably being decoupled by means of decoupling resistances. If a steady-state as well as dynamic symmetry can be achieved, this is a useful and cost-effective solution. However,   since   this   generally   necessitates   in<br><br>
particular a geometrical symmetry of the power semiconductor modules or at least a mutually identical or mirror-inverted embodiment of driving and power leads, such a procedure generally cannot be employed, or at most can be employed with a high outlay, in the case of power semiconductor modules having more than two power semiconductor switches. Moreover, the solution described generally cannot be employed if power semiconductor switches situated in separate submodules or even complete power semiconductor modules are intended to be connected in parallel.<br>
A further variant likewise uses the hard, direct connection of the output sides but decouples the driving sides by using separate drive units. However, this imposes stringent requirements with regard to synchronicity and affinity of the drive units, which in turn leads to increased production costs.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
Consequently, it is an object of the invention to specify an electronic circuit having at least two power semiconductor switches connected in parallel, in the case of which a dynamic current division between the at least two power semiconductor switches which is as uniform as possible is achieved.<br>
These and further objects are achieved by means of an electronic circuit of the type mentioned in the introduction having the features of the independent patent claim. Further advantageous refinements of the invention are specified in the dependent claims.<br>
In the case of the electronic circuit according to the invention, in particular for use as a power switch, provision is made of a drive unit, which generates at least  one  drive  signal,  and  two  or  more  power<br><br>
semiconductor switches each having a first and a second main terminal, which power semiconductor switches can be switched synchronously by the drive signal, the first and the second main terminals of the power semiconductor switches in each case being electrically connected in parallel among one another- For each of the power semiconductor switches a first and a second electrically conductive connection for connection to the drive unit are provided, a first inductance being provided in each of the first electrically conductive connections and a second inductance being provided in each of the second electrically conductive connections, and the first inductance being coupled to the second inductance for each of the power semiconductor switches. According to the invention, a respective common-mode rejection inductor is provided in each pair of first and second electrically conductive connections, that is to say that a respective common-mode rejection inductor is provided for each of the power semiconductor switches. Here, in each case a first winding of the common-mode rejection inductors forms the first inductance and a second winding of the common-mode rejection inductors forms the second inductance.<br>
The coupled inductances reduce coupling and crosstalk problems during switching operations. Dynamic circulating currents are minimized and oscillations between the power semiconductor switches are effectively suppressed. The electronic circuit according to the invention has both the advantages of output sides that are directly connected in parallel and the advantages of separate driving of the power semiconductor switches, without necessitating synchronization of a plurality of separate control units or costly circuitry in the output circuit, which enables cost-effective production. A balancing of the output sides can be optimized for a direct-current<br><br>
behavior, in particular by means of a uniform division of a gate resistance between gate and emitter of the power semiconductor switches. The common-mode rejection inductors decouple the pairs of first and second electrically conductive connections from the power circuit which runs through the power semiconductor switches between cathode terminals and a common node of the power semiconductor switches. The decoupling furthermore ensures a uniform dynamic current division between corresponding paths in the power circuit.<br>
These and further objects, advantages and features of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of a preferred exemplary embodiment of the invention in conjunction with the drawing.<br>

electronic   circuit   according   to   the invention.<br>
The reference symbols used in the drawing and their meanings are summarized in the List of reference symbols. In principle, identical parts are provided with identical reference symbols in the figures. The embodiments described represent the subject matter of the invention by way of example and do not have a restrictive effect.<br>
Ways of embodying the invention<br>
Figure 2 shows an electronic circuit according to the invention having three IGBTs T1, where ie{l,2,3}, connected in parallel as power semiconductor switches. The latter can be switched synchronously by means of a common drive unit 20. For this purpose, a drive signal generated by the common drive unit 2 0 can be fed to each of the IGBTs T1 via a respective pair of driving leads. However, it is also conceivable for the synchronously switchable power semiconductor switches Ti to be unipolar insulated gate field effect transistors (MOS-FET). In accordance with figure 2, each pair of driving leads comprises a first driving lead, which is provided between node Ai and auxiliary emitter terminal Hi, and a second driving lead, which is provided between node Bi and gate terminal Gi. According to the invention, a respective common-mode reduction inductor Di is provided in each pair of first and second electrically conductive connections (pairs of driving leads) , that is to say that a respective common-mode rejection inductor Di is provided for each of the power semiconductor switches Ti. In accordance with figure 2, here in each case a first winding of the common-mode rejection inductor Di forms the first inductance LDi(i and a second winding of the common-mode rej ection inductor Di forms the second inductance LD2,i.<br><br>
The common-mode rejection inductors Di decouple the pairs of driving leads, that is to say the pairs of first and second electrically conductive connections, from a power circuit that runs through the IGBTs Ti between cathode terminals Ki and a common node C. The decoupling ensures a uniform dynamic current division between paths Ki-C, K2-C and K3-C in the power circuit. In this case, a gate resistance is preferably divided such that for ie{l, 2,3} RG/i ~ RE,± holds true, where a value of half the nominal gate resistance RG,nom of the IGBT is preferably chosen for RGfi and RE/±, that is to say RG/i   = RB/i  = 1/2 R^nom-<br>
In this case, series inductances L%\ of the common-mode rejection inductors Di are preferably chosen to be as small as possible, preferably less than or equal to 200 nH. In this case, the series inductance of the common-mode rejection inductor Di is that inductance which is measured if both turns of the common-mode rejection inductor Di are connected in series. Figure 3a shows a circuit diagram of a measuring arrangement for measuring the series inductance of the common-mode rejection inductor Di.<br>
In this  case,  common-mode  inductances  L j^  of  the<br>
common-mode rejection inductors Di are preferably chosen at least approximately as follows: on the basis of a maximum ALE of the differences LE,i - LE,j between two emitter inductances where i&amp;je{l,2,3} and a predetermined maximum permissible difference AUGE between two gate-emitter voltages UGE/i and UGE/j which are present between auxiliary emitter terminals Hi and Hj, respectively, and gate terminals Gi and Gj, respectively, of two IGBTs Ti and Tj, respectively, where i#je{l,2,3}, it is possible to calculate a minimum common-mode inductance L ^ . Since the IGBTs Ti<br>
are voltage-controlled components in which a collector<br><br>
current can be set by way of the gate-emitter voltage UGE,i, it is necessary to read out the maximum permissible voltage difference AUGE by way of a maximum permissible collector current difference in a region of interest from a transfer characteristic of the IGBTs Ti.<br>
A permissible difference in a gate charge AQGE is produced by multiplying the maximum permissible voltage difference AUGE by a gate-emitter capacitance CGE in accordance with AQGE = AUGE -CGEf<br>
it having been assumed that the gate-emitter capacitance CGEt± has the same value CGE for all three IGBTs Ti.<br>
A maximum permissible difference AlG between gate currents Ii and Ij where i#je{l, 2,3} can then be calculated by dividing the maximum permissible difference in the gate charge AQGE by a relevant time tR during which the voltage builds up across the various emitter inductances, that is to say<br><br>
The voltage-time integral over the maximum ALE of the differences in the emitter inductances LEt± - LE/j can be calculated by multiplying ALE by a maximum current, the short-circuit current ISc of the IGBTs:<br>
UAt=ALE'Isc.<br><br><br>
In this case, the common-mode inductance of the common-mode rejection inductors Di is that inductance which is measured if both turns of the common-mode rejection inductor Di are connected in parallel- Figure 3b shows a circuit diagram of a measuring arrangement for measuring the common-mode inductance of the common-mode rejection inductor Di.<br>
Figure 4 shows a preferred configuration of the electronic circuit according to the invention. In this case, a resistor RD is provided between the node A2 and the auxiliary emitter terminals H2 in parallel with the common-mode rejection inductor D2 in order to minimize peak values UD between the drive unit 2 0 and the power circuit. A value of a few ohms to a few tens of ohms is preferably chosen for RD.<br>
A power semiconductor module according to the invention comprises a module housing of a type known per se and an electronic circuit according to the invention such as has been described in this section. In this case, both the power semiconductor switches and the drive unit 20 and/or the first and second inductances are preferably accommodated in the module housing. However, the drive unit 2 0 and/or the first and second inductances may advantageously also be provided outside the module housing, in particular be screwed on or plugged on.<br>
In a preferred development of the power semiconductor module according to the invention, this module comprises two or more submodules, and the at least two<br><br>
power semiconductor switches driven by the control unit are not all situated in the same submodule. In this case, the invention can be used particularly advantageously since a mutually identical or mirror-inverted embodiment of driving and power leads generally cannot be realized in power semiconductor switches situated in different submodules and, consequently, known makeshift solutions described in the prior art are not available.<br><br>
