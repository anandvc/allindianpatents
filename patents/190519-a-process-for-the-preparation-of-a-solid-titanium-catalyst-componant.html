				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a solid titanium catalyst<br>
component and an olefin polymerization catalyst prepared<br>
from the same. More particularly, the invention relates to<br>
a process for preparing a solid titanium catalyst component,<br>
such a catalyst component as prepared by the process, a<br>
preliminary olefin polymerization catalyst and an olefin<br>
polymerization catalyst both pepared from such a catalyst<br>
component, and a process for producing polyolefins using<br>
such ca talysts.<br>
Description of the Prior Art<br>
A Ziegler-Natta catalyst comprising a titanium<br>
catalyst component and an organoaluminum compound have been<br>
in wide use as an olefin polymerization catalyst. It is<br>
already known that a catalyst which is prepared from a solid<br>
titanium catalyst component comprising a titanium compound<br>
supported on a solid carrier has high polymerization<br>
activity. In particular, it is also known that a catalyst<br>
which is prepared from a solid titanium catalyst component<br>
comprising a titanium compound supported on a solid<br>
halogenated magnesium compound has high polymerization<br>
activity, but also the catalyst provides highly<br>
stereospecific polyolefins in high yields when it is used<br>
for the polymerization of alpha-olefins having at least<br>
three carbon atoms such as propylene or 1-butene.<br>
The solid titanium catalyst component comprising a<br>
titanium compound supported on a solid halogenated magnesium<br>
compound may be prepared by contacting a halogenated<br>
magnesium compound, a titanium compound and an electron<br>
donor with each other.<br>
A process for an olefin polymerization using such a<br>
solid titanium catalyst component is known, as disclosed<br>
in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 58-83006.<br>
According to the prior art, a solid titanium catalyst<br>
component is prepared by use of a hydrocarbon solution of<br>
a magnesium compound, a titanium compound which is per se<br>
liquid such as titanium tetrachloride and an electron donor.<br>
An olefin polymerization catalyst is then prepared from the<br>
solid titanium catalyst component, an organometallic catalyst<br>
component and an organosilicone catalyst component. The<br>
prior art uses a certain compound such as an acid anhydride<br>
in combination with a polybasic carboxylic acid ester or a<br>
polyhydric alcohol ester as an electron donor when the solid<br>
titanium catalyst component is prepared.<br>
The hydrocarbon solution of a magnesium compound is<br>
prepared usually by solubilizing a magnesium compound<br>
which is solid at normal temperatures such as magnesium<br>
chloride with a solubilizing agent, if necessary, in a<br>
hydrocarbon solvent. A preferred example of the solubilizing<br>
agent is an alcohol such as 2-ethylhexanol.<br>
More specifically, according to the prior art, the<br>
solid titanium catalyst component is prepared by firstly<br>
contacting a solution of a magnesium compound with titanium<br>
tetrachloride in the presence of an electron donor to form<br>
a suspension which contains the resultant solid material;<br>
the solid material is separated from the suspension; and<br>
then the solid material is again contacted with titanium<br>
tetrachloride under heating.<br>
As mentioned above, the polymerization of olefins in<br>
the presence of a catalyst prepared from the solid titanium<br>
catalyst component together with an organometallic catalyst<br>
component and an organosilicone catalyst component provides<br>
polyolefins in high yields. In particular, the<br>
polymerization of alpha-olefins having at least three carbon<br>
atoms provides highly stereospecific polyolefins in high<br>
yields. In addition, the resulting polyoefins have a small<br>
content of finely divided polymer powder as well as narrow<br>
particle distribution and high bulk density.<br>
The known olefin polymerization catalyst which is<br>
prepared by a method as described above and contains the<br>
solid titanium catalyst component has a high performance<br>
in many respects, that is, in respect of polymerization<br>
activity, and stereospecificity and particle properties of<br>
the resulting polymers, as above set forth. However, in<br>
recent years, there is a strong demand for a solid titanium<br>
catalyst component for use in the preparation of an olefin<br>
polymerization catalyst which reduces the amount of finely<br>
divided polymer powder produced.<br>
Therefore, it is an object of the invention to<br>
provide a solid titanium catalyst component for use in an<br>
olefin polymerization catalyst which has high olefin<br>
polymerization activity, and in particular, for use in an<br>
alpha-olefin polymerization catalyst which provides<br>
polyolefins having high stereospecificity and bulk density<br>
in high yields with a reduced amount of finely divided<br>
polymer powder produced when alpha-olefins having at least<br>
three carbon atoms are polymerized.<br>
It is a further object of the invention to provide<br>
such a solid titanium catalyst component, a preliminary<br>
olefin polymerization catalyst and an olefin polymerization<br>
catalyst both comprising the solid titanium catalyst<br>
component and a process for the polymerization of olefins<br>
using such catalysts.<br>

titanium catalyst component and for the polymerization of<br>
olefins according to the invention; and<br>
Fig. 2 shows an example of arrangement of apparastus<br>
for the preparation of solid titanium catalyst component<br>
of the invention.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The preparation of the solid titanium catalyst component<br>
of the invention will be first described. As illustrated in<br>
Fig. 1, the solid titanium catalyst component is prepared<br>
by carrying out the following steps:<br>
(1) a step wherein a suspension is prepared which<br>
contains a solid material prepared by contacting a magnesium<br>
compound with a first titanium compound and having a<br>
polybasic carboxylic acid ester supported thereon;<br>
(2) a step wherein the solid material is separated<br>
from the suspension; and<br>
(3) a step wherein the solid material is contacted<br>
with a second titanium compound under heating;<br>
wherein while the solid material is separated from<br>
the suspension in the step (2) and the solid material is<br>
supplied to the step (3), the solid material is maintained<br>
at a temperature in the range of 70-130°C .<br>
(Step(l) - magnesium compound)<br>
It is preferred that a magnesium compound is made<br>
into a solution and is then contacted with a first titanium<br>
compound. When a magnesium compound is soluble in a solvent,<br>
the magnesium compound is dissolved in the solvent to<br>
form a solution. When a magnesium compound is prepared as<br>
a solution, for example, as in the case of a Grignard<br>
reagent, the resulting solution may be used as it is. When<br>
a magnesium compound is solubilized with a solubilizing<br>
agent, the magnesium compound may be dissolved in the<br>
solubilizing agent as a solvent. The magnesium compound<br>
may be dissolved in a solvent such as a hydrocarbon solvent<br>
in the presence of the solubilizing agent.<br>
However, when a magnesium compound is used which is<br>
solid at normal temperatures and is not soluble in common<br>
solvents inclusive of the solubilizing agent, the magnesium<br>
compound may be dispersed in a solvent to form a suspension,<br>
and the suspension may be contacted with the first titanium<br>
compound.<br>
The magnesium compound used in the invention may or<br>
may not have a reducing ability. The magnesium compound<br>
having a reducing ability includes an organomagnesium<br>
compound which may be represented by the formula:<br>
XnMgR2-n<br>
wherein n is a numeral which fulfils the condition of<br>
0=n=2; R is a hydrogen, or an alkyl, an aryl or a<br>
cycloalkyl of 1-20 carbons; when n is 0, the two R's may<br>
be the same or different from each other; X is a halogen<br>
a torn.<br>
Illustrative of the magnesium compound having a<br>
reducing ability are dialkyl magnesiums such as dimethyl-<br>
magnesium, diethylmagnesium, dipropylmagnesiurn, dibutyl-<br>
magnesium, diamylmagnesium, dihexylmagnesiurn, didecyl-<br>
magnesium, octylbutylmagnesium or ethylbutylmagnesium;<br>
alkyl magnesium halides such as ethylmagnesium chloride,<br>
propylmagnesium chloride, butylmagnesium chloride, hexyl-<br>
magnesium chloride or amy 1magnesium chloride; and alkyl<br>
magnesium alkoxides such as butylethoxymagnesium, ethyl-<br>
butoxymagnesium or octylbutoxymagnesium. In addition,<br>
alkyl magnesium hydrides such as butylmagnesium hydride are<br>
one of further examples of the magnesium compound having a<br>
reducing ability.<br>
In turn, illustrative of the magnesium compound having<br>
no reducing ability are magnesium halides such as magnesium<br>
chloride, magnesium bromide, magnesium iodide or magnesium<br>
fluoride; alkoxy magnesium halides such as methoxymagnesium<br>
chloride, ethoxymagnesium chloride, isopropoxymagnesium<br>
chloride, butoxymagnesium chloride or octoxymagnesium<br>
chloride; aryloxy magnesium halides such as phenoxymagnesium<br>
chloride or me thylphenoxymagnesium chloride; alkoxy<br>
magnesiums such as ethoxymagnesium, isopropoxymagnesium,<br>
butoxymagnesium, n-octoxymagnesium or 2-ethylhexoxymagnesium;<br>
aryloxy magnesiums such as phenoxymagnesium or dimethyl-<br>
phenoxymagnesium; and magnesium carboxylates such as<br>
magnesium laurate or magnesium stearate.<br>
Beside the above mentioned, magnesium hydride may be<br>
used as a magnesium compound. Metallic magnesium may also<br>
be used in place of the magnesium compound.<br>
The magnesium compound having no reducing ability<br>
may be derived from the magnesium compound having a reducing<br>
ability or may be prepared when the catalyst component is<br>
prepared. In order to prepare a magnesium compound having<br>
no reducing ability from a magnesium compound having a<br>
reducing ability, for example, the latter may be put into<br>
contact with polysiloxane compounds, halogen-containing<br>
silane compounds, halogen-containing aluminum compounds,<br>
esters, alcohols, halogen-containing compounds, or compounds<br>
having hydroxyl groups or active carbon-oxygen bonds in<br>
the molecule.<br>
The magnesium compound, whether it has a reducing<br>
ability or it has not, may be in the form of complex<br>
compounds with organometallic compounds such as of aluminum,<br>
zinc, boron, beryllium, sodium or potassium which will be<br>
hereinafter mentioned, or in the form of mixtures wuth other<br>
metal compounds. The magnesium compound may be used singly<br>
or as a mixture of two or more.<br>
The magnesium compound used in the invention is not<br>
limited to those as exemplified as above, however, it is<br>
preferred that the magnesium compound exists in the form<br>
of halogen-containing magnesium compounds in the solid<br>
titanium catalyst component prepared. Accordingly, when a<br>
magnesium compound containing no halogens is used, it is<br>
desirable that the magnesium compound be contacted with a<br>
halogen-containing compound during the preparation process<br>
of solid titanium catalyst component.<br>
Among the magnesium compounds mentioned above, those<br>
having no reducing ability are preferred, inter alia,<br>
halogen-containing magnesium compounds. In particular,<br>
magnesium chloride, alkoxy magnesium chlorides or aryloxy<br>
magnesium chlorides are most preferred.<br>
When magnesium compounds which are solid at normal<br>
temperatures are used, some of such magnesium compounds<br>
can be solubilized with a solubilizung agent in such a<br>
solubilizung agent, thereby forming a solution.<br>
The solubilizung agent usable includes, for example,<br>
alcohols, phenols, ketones, aldehydes, ethers, amines,<br>
pyridines and metal acid esters. More specifically, the<br>
solubilizung agent may be exemplified by alcohols of 1-18<br>
carbons such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol,<br>
pentanol, hexanol, 2-ethylhexanol, octanol, dodecanol,<br>
octadecyl alcohol, oleyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol,<br>
phenylethyl alcohol, cumyl alcohol or isopropylbenzyl<br>
alcohol; halogen-containing alcohols of 1-18 carbons such<br>
as trichloromethanol, trichloroethanol or trichlorohexanol ;<br>
phenols of 6-20 carbons which may carry lower alkyl groups<br>
as substituents thereon such as phenol, cresol, xylenol,<br>
ethylphenol, propylphenol, nonylphenol, cumylphenol or<br>
naphthol; ketones of 3-15 carbons such as acetone, methyl<br>
ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, ethyl n-butyl ketone,<br>
acetophenone, benzophenone, benzoquinone or cyclohexanone;<br>
aldehydes of 2-15 carbons such as acetaldehyde,<br>
propionaIdehyde, octyl aldehyde, benzaldehyde, tolualdehyde<br>
or naphthoaIdehyde; ethers of 2-20 carbons such as methyl<br>
ether, ethyl ether, isopropyl ether, butyl ether, amyl ether,<br>
tetrahydrofuran, ethyl benzyl ether, ethylene glycol<br>
dibutyl ether, anisole or diphenyl ether; amines such as<br>
trimethy lamine, trie thylamine, tributylamine, tribenzyl amine,<br>
tetramethylenediamine or hexamethylenediamine; pyridines<br>
such as pyridine, me thy 1 pyridines, ethylpyridines,<br>
propylpyridines, dimethy 1 pyridines, ethylmethylpyridines,<br>
trimethylpyridines, phenylpyridines, benzylpyridines or<br>
chloropyridines; and metal acid esters such as tetraethoxy-<br>
titanium, tetra-n-propoxytitanium, tetraisopropoxytitanium,<br>
tetrabutoxytitanium, tetrahexoxytitanium, tetraethoxy-<br>
zirconium or tetrabutoxyzirconium.<br>
Among the variety of solubilizing agents as mentioned<br>
above, alcohols or metal acid esters are preferred, and in<br>
particular, alcohols of not less than 6 carbons are most<br>
preferred. In order to solubilize a magnesium compound<br>
with an alcohol of not less than 6 carbons, the alcohol is<br>
used usually in an amount of not less than 1 mole part,<br>
preferably in an amount of not less than 1.5 mole parts,<br>
per mole part of magnesium compound. There is no specific<br>
upper limit in the amount of the solubilizing agent used,<br>
however, it is preferred that the solubilizing agent is used<br>
in an amount of not more than 40 mole parts per mole part<br>
of the magnesium compound used from the economical stand-<br>
point. On the other hand, when a lower alcohol of not more<br>
than 5 carbons is used as a solubilizing agent to solubilize<br>
a magnesium compound, it is necessary to use the<br>
solubilizing agent in an amount of not less than about 15<br>
mole parts per mole part of the magnesium compound used.<br>
A solid magnesium compound is solubilized with a<br>
solubilizing agent by admixing the magnesium compound with<br>
the agent, if necessary followed by heating the mixture.<br>
The magnesium compound is solubilized in this way at a<br>
temperature usually in the range of 0-200ºC, preferably<br>
in the range of 20-180ºC , most preferably in the range of<br>
50-150ºC .<br>
A solid magnesium compound may be dissolved in a<br>
solvent such as a hydrocarbon solvent in the presence of<br>
the solubilizing agent. The hydrocarbon solvent includes,<br>
for example, aliphatic hydrocarbons such as pentane, hexane,<br>
heptane, octane, decane, dodecane, tetradecane or kerosene;<br>
alicyclic hydrocarbons such as cyclopentane,<br>
me thylcyclopentane, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane,<br>
cyclooctane or cyclohexene; halogenated hydrocarbons such<br>
as dichloroethane, dichloropropane, trichloroethylene or<br>
chlorobenzene; and aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene,<br>
toluene or xylene.<br>
According to the invention, it is especially preferred<br>
that a magnesium compound, preferably a halogenated<br>
magnesium, inter alia, magnesium chloride, is used in the<br>
form of a solution in a hydrocarbon solvent in the presence<br>
of an alcohol as a solubilizing agent. However, it is also<br>
preferred that a dialkoxy magnesium such as diethoxymagnesium<br>
is dispersed in a hydrocarbon solvent and the resulting<br>
suspension is used for contact with the first titanium<br>
compound.<br>
The solubilizing agent solublizes a solid magnesium<br>
compound presumably on account of formation of complexes<br>
with the magnesium compound. However, when the lower<br>
aliphatic alcohol is used as a solubilizing agent in an<br>
insufficient amount, it may form coplexes with a magnesium<br>
compound, but it does not solubilizes the magnesium compound<br>
therein. In this case, however, it is possible to prepare<br>
a suspension which contains a solid material having a<br>
polybasic carboxylic acid ester supported thereon by the<br>
following process in the step (1). Namely, the lower<br>
alcohol is reacted with the magnesium compound in a hydro-<br>
carbon solvent in the presence of a surfactant to form<br>
complexes with the magnesium compound to provide a<br>
suspension which contains the complex, and the suspension<br>
is then cooled to provide a suspension which contains a<br>
solid product, followed by supporting a polybasic carboxylic<br>
acid ester thereon.<br>
(Step (1) - first titanium compound)<br>
According to the invention, a titanium compound which<br>
is tetravalent and is per se liquid at notmal temperatures<br>
is preferably used as the first titanium compound. The<br>
first titanium compound preferebly used in the invention<br>
has the formula:<br><br>
wherein R is a monovalent hydrocarbon group, preferably an<br>
alkyl of 1-18 carbons; X is a halogen atom, preferably a<br>
chlorine or bromine atom; m is an integer of 0-4.<br>
The first titanium compound as mentioned above<br>
includes, for example, tetrahalogenated titaniums such as<br>
titanium tetrachloride, titanium tetrabromide or titanium<br>
tetraiodide; trihalogenated alkoxy titaniums such as<br>
trichloromethoxytitanium, trichloroethoxytitanium,<br>
trichloro-n-butoxytitanium, tribromoethoxytitanium or<br>
tribromoisobutoxytitanium; d i ha 1 ogena ted dialkoxy titaniums<br>
such as dichlorodimethoxytitanium, dich1orodiethoxytitanium,<br>
dichlorodi-n-butoxytitanium or dibromodiethoxytitaniurn;<br>
monohalogenated trialkoxy titaniums such as<br>
chlorotrimethoxyti tanium, chlorotriethoxyti tanium,<br>
chlorotri-n-butoxytitanium or bromotriethoxytitanium; and<br>
tetraalkoxy titaniums such as tetramethoxytitanium,<br>
tetraethoxytitanium, tetra-n-butoxytitanium,<br>
tetraisobutoxytitanium or tetra (2-ethylhexyloxy)titanium.<br>
The first titanium compound may be used singly or as a<br>
mixture of two or more. Among the first titanium compounds<br>
as above, a tetraalkoxy titanium is preferred with titanium<br>
tetrachloride being most preferred.<br>
The first titanium compound is per se liquid at normal<br>
temperatures, and may be used as it is. However, if<br>
necessary, the first titanium compound may be used as a<br>
solution in a hydrocarbon solvent. The hydrocarbon solvent<br>
includes, as mentioned hereinbefore, for example, aliphatic<br>
hydrocarbons such as pentane, hexane, heptane, octane,<br>
decane, dodecane, tetradecane or kerosene; alicyclic<br>
hydrocarbons such as cyclopentane, me thy lcyclopentane,<br>
cyclohexane, me thylcyclohexane, cyclooctane or cyclohexene;<br>
halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichloroethane,<br>
dichloropropane, trichloroethylene or chlorobenzene; and<br>
aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene or xylene.<br>
The first titanium compound is used usually in an<br>
amount of 0.01-1000 mole parts, preferably in an amount of<br>
0.1-200 mole parts, per mole part of the magnesium compound<br>
used.<br>
(Step (1) - electron donor)<br>
When a magnesium compound in the form of a solution<br>
is contacted with the first titanium compound to form a<br>
solid product, it is desirable that the magnesium compound<br>
is contacted with the first titanium compound in the<br>
presence of an electron donor so that the finally obtained<br>
solid titanium catalyst component having a uniform shape<br>
and particle size.<br>
The electron donor usable includes, for example,<br>
organic carboxylic acid esters preferably of 2-18 carbons<br>

According to the invention, there is prepared in the<br>

phthalate, diethyl naphthalenedicarboxylate, dibutyl<br>
naphthalenedicarboxylate, triethyl trimellitate or<br>
dibutyl trimellitate.<br>
According to the invention, as the polybasic carboxylic<br>
acid ester, an aromatic ortho-dicarboxylic acid monoester<br>
or diester which has the formula (I):<br><br>
wherein Ar is a divalent aromatic hydrocarbon group of 6-<br>
14 carbons; R is a monovalent hydrocarbon group of 1-20<br>
carbons; and R' is a hydrogen or a monovalent hydrocarbon<br>
group of 1-20 carbons, is in particular preferred, which<br>
will be for simplicity referred to as the aromatic<br>
dicarboxylic acid esters herein after.<br>
In the above formula, Ar is preferably phenylene or<br>
naphthylene which may carry thereon alkyl substiuents.<br>
When R and R' are hydrocarbon groups, they may be the same<br>
or different from each other. The hydrocarbon group<br>
includes, for example, an alkyl or a cycloalkyl of 1-20<br>

Among the above exemplified aromatic dicarboxylic acid<br>
esters, phthalic acid dialkyl esters are particularly<br>
preferred.<br>
(Step (1) - preparation of solid material)<br>
According to the invention, in the step (1), the<br>
suspension which contains a solid material having the<br>
polybasic carboxylic acid ester supported thereon may be<br>
prepared either by contacting the magnesium compound with<br>
the first titanium compound in the presence of the<br>
polybasic carboxylic acid ester, or by contacting the<br>
magnesium comound with the first titanium compound, and<br>
then contacting the resulting soild product with the<br>
polybasic carboxylic acid ester, the latter being preferred.<br>
The contact of the magnesium comound with the first titanium<br>
compound in the step (1) may be often referred to as the<br>
first titanation hereinafter.<br>
Further according to the invention, it is in particular<br>
preferred that a solution of the magnesium comound is<br>
contacted with the first titanium compound in the presence<br>
of the electron donor to carry out the first titanation<br>
thereby to form a solid product, and the solid product is<br>
then contacted with the polybasic carboxylic acid ester to<br>
support the ester on the solid product thereby to form a<br>
suspension which contains the resultant solid material.<br>
The preparation of the suspension which contains the solid<br>
material in this manner provides a solid titanium catalyst<br>
component which is uniform in shape and particle size.<br>
Alternatively, as set forth hereinbefore, such a suspension<br>
which contains the solid material may be prepared by<br>
contacting the magnesium comound with the first titanium<br>
compound in the presence of the polybasic carboxylic acid<br>
ester. The preparation of the suspension which contains<br>
the solid material in this manner also provides a solid<br>
titanium catalyst component which is uniform in shape and<br>
particle size.<br>
According to the invention, there are further<br>
processes for preparing the suspension which contains the<br>
solid material on which a polybasic carboxylic acid ester<br>
is supported.<br>
(1) There is prepared a suspension of a dialkoxymagnesium<br>
represented by the formula:<br><br>
wherein R1 is an alkyl of 1-20 carbons, in a hydrocarbon<br>
solvent, and the suspension is contacted with the first<br>
titanium compound to provide a solid product. While or<br>
after the contact, a polybasic carboxylic acid ester is<br>
supported on the solid product.<br>
(2) There is prepared a solution of an organic magnesium<br>
compound represented by the formula:<br><br>
wherein Rz and R3 are independently an alkyl of 1-20 carbons<br>
and the solution is contacted with the first titanium<br>
compound to provide a solid product. While or after the<br>
contact, a polybasic carboxylic acid ester is supported<br>
on the solid product.<br>
(3) There is prepared a suspension of solid complexes of<br>
a halogenated magnesium compound with an aliphatic lower<br>
alcohol of five carbons or less in a hydrocarbon solvent<br>
in the presence of a surfactant. The suspension is then<br>
cooled to provide a solid product. While or after the<br>
cooling, a polybasic carboxylic acid ester is supported<br>
on the solid product.<br>
According to the invention, the suspension which<br>
contains the solid material having the polybasic carboxylic<br>
acid ester supported thereon may be prepared in the<br>
presence of a porous carrier material so that the resulting<br>
solid material is supported on the porous carrier material.<br>
The porous carrier material usable includes, for<br>
example, inorganic oxides such as alumina, silica, boron<br>
oxide, magnesium oxide, calcium oxide, titanium oxide, zinc<br>
oxide, tin oxide, barium oxide or thorium oxide, and resins<br>
such as a styrene-divinyl benzene copolymer resin. Among<br>
these carrier materials, alumina, silica or a styrene-<br>
divinylbenzene copolymer resin is preferred.<br>
The temperature at which the magnesium comound is<br>
contacted with the first titanium compound and the polybasic<br>
carboxylic acid ester is then supported thereon to form<br>
the suspension which contains the solid material, or the<br>
magnesium comound is contacted with the first titanium<br>
compound in presence of the polybasic carboxylic acid ester<br>
to form the suspension which contains the solid material,<br>
is usually in the range of — 70ºC to 200ºC, preferably<br>
in the range of — 50°C to 150°C, most preferably in the<br>
range of -30ºC to 130ºC .<br>
The polybasic carboxylic acid ester is supported on<br>
the solid product prepared from the magnesium comound and<br>
the first titanium compound usually in an amount of 0.01-<br>
5 mole parts, pfeferably in an amount of 0.02-0.5 mole parts,<br>
per mole part of the magnesium comound used.<br>
(Step (2))<br>
In the step (2), the solid material is separated from<br>
the suspension prepared in the step (1) and the solid<br>
material is supplied to the step (3). According to the<br>
invention, while the solid material is separated from the<br>
suspension and the solid material is supplied to the step<br>
(3), the solid material is maintained at a temperature in<br>
the range of 70-130 ºC , preferably in the range of 75-125ºC.<br>
More specifically, as illustrated in Fig. 2, as the<br>
step (1), the suspension is prepared in a first reactor 1,<br>
and after the reaction, as the step (2), the suspension is<br>
supplied to a first filter 2 through a first pipe A where<br>
the solid material is separated from the suspension by<br>
filtration. The resulting solid material is then supplied<br>
to a second reactor 3 through a second pipe B where the<br>
solid material is contacted with a second titanium as the<br>
step (3) which will be set forth in detail hereinafter.<br>
The contact of the solid material with the second titanium<br>
compound in the step (3) may be often referred to as the<br>
second titanation hereinafter. The step (1) to the step<br>
(3) via the step (2) is carried out in this manner.<br>
The solid material is contacted with the second<br>
titanium compound in the second reactor 3 to carry out the<br>
second titanation to provide a suspension as set forth above,<br>
and the suspension is then supplied to a second filter 4<br>
through a third pipe C where the solid material is separated.<br>
The solid material is then supplied to a washing apparatus<br>
5 through a pipe D where the solid material is washed with,<br>
for example, a hydrocarbon such as hexane repeatedly until<br>
no titanium is detected in the washing. The solid material<br>
is finally supplied to a drying apparatus 6 through a pipe<br>
E where the solid material is dried thereby providing the<br>
solid titanium catalyst component of the invention.<br>
When the step (1), step (2) and step (3) are carried<br>
out in a manner as above, all the first pipe A, the first<br>
filter 2 and the second pipe B should be maintained at a<br>
temperature in the range of 70-130ºC so that the solid<br>
material is maintained at the temperature according to the<br>
invention.<br>
When the suspension which contains the solid material<br>
is supplied from the first reactor 1 to the first filter 2<br>
through the first pipe A to separate the solid material<br>
from the suspension, the liquid may be decanted from the<br>
suspension and the residual may be supplied to the first<br>
filter 2, if necessary.<br>
If necessary, the second titanation may be repeated.<br>
In particular, when a magnesium compound is used in the<br>
form of suspension in the step (1), it is preferred that<br>
the second titanation is repeated. By way of example, as<br>
illustrated in Fig. 2, after the second titanation is carried<br>
out in the second reactor 3, the resultant suspension is<br>
again supplied to the first filter 2 through the pipe B'<br>
where the solid material is separated from the suspension<br>
by filtration, and the solid material is then again supplied<br>
to the second reactor 3 through the pipe B where the solid<br>
material is contacted with the second titanium compound to<br>
carry out the second titanation again. When the second<br>
titanation is repeated in this manner, the pipe B' and the<br>
solid material therein should be maintained at the<br>
temperature in the range hereinbefore defined as well.<br>
The second titanation may be repeated in another<br>
manner. Although not shown in the drawing, a further filter<br>
is provided in addition to the first filter 2 to which the<br>
suspension is supplied from the first filter 2, and the<br>
suspension is filtrated with the further filter, and the<br>
resulting solid material is then supplied to the second<br>
reactor 3 through a further pipe. When the second titanation<br>
is repeated in this manner, the solid material should be<br>
maintained at the temperature in the range hereinbefore<br>
defined within the further pipe.<br>
As set forth in detail as above, while the solid<br>
material is separated from the suspension in the step (2)<br>
and the solid material is supplied to the step (3), the<br>
solid material is maintained at the temperature as herein-<br>
before defined. This makes it possible to provide a solid<br>
titanium catalyst component which in turn forms an olefin<br>
polymerization catalyst which makes it possible to produce<br>
polyolefins with a reduced amount of finely divided polymer<br>
powder.<br>
The solid material separated from the suspension in<br>
the step (2) may be washed with a hydrocarbon solvent, if<br>
necessary, before it is supplied to the step (3). The<br>
hydrocarbon solvent usable may be the same as the<br>
hydrocarbon solvents which are used as a diluent for the<br>
first titanium compound. In particular, aliphatic<br>
hydrocarbon solvents such as hexane, heptane or decane, or<br>
aromatic hydrocarbon solvents such as toluene or xylene<br>
are preferred. Furthermoe, when the solid material<br>
separated from the suspension in the step (2) is supplied<br>
to the step (3), a small amount of a titanium compound,<br>
which may be the same as either the first or the second,<br>
may be added to the solid material.<br>
The infrared absorption specrum of the solid material<br>
which is produced in the step (1) in an industrial scale<br>
as exemplified in examples which will be hereinafter<br>
described shows an absorption peak which, however, is not<br>
found in the infrared absorption specrum of the solid<br>
material prepared in a laboratory scale. On the other hand,<br>
the reaction of titanium tetrachloride with diisobutyl<br>
phthalate at a temperature of not more than 70 ºC provides<br>
a solid product which has the same infrared absorption<br>
peak as above. Accordingly, it is likely that while the<br>
solid material is separated from the suspension in the<br>
step (2) and the solid material is supplied to the step (3),<br>
if the solid material is placed at a temperature not more<br>
than 70ºC, undesirable reactions take place between the<br>
titanium compound and the polybasic carboxylic acid ester,<br>
adversely affecting the finally obtained solid titanium<br>
catalyst component. It is also found, as seen in Reference<br>
Examples 2 and 4 which will be described hereinafter, that<br>
when the solid material prepared in the step (1) is placed<br>
at a temperature of more than 13 5 ºC , the finally obtained<br>
solid titanium catalyst component has a tendency to support<br>
a smaller amount of titanium thereon.<br>
(Step (3) - preparation of solid titanium catalyst component)<br>
According to the invention, the solid material<br>
prepared in the step (2) is contacted with a second titanium<br>
compound in the step (3) under heating. The second titanium<br>
compound may be the same as or different from the first<br>
titanium compound used in the step (1) if it is per se<br>
liquid at normal temperatures. As in the case with the<br>
first titanium compound, the second titanium compound is<br>
preferably a titanium tetrachloride, and most preferably<br>
it is titanium tetrachloride. The contact of the solid<br>
material with the second titanium compound may be carried<br>
out in the presence of such a hydrocarbon solvent as is<br>
exemplified as the diluent for the first titanium compound.<br>
In the step (3), the second titanium compound is used<br>
in an amount of 5-200 mole parts, preferably 10-100 mole<br>
parts, per mole part of the magnesium compound used.<br>
The solid material is contacted with the second<br>
titanium compound usually at a temperature of 40-200ºC,<br>
preferably 50-180ºC, more preferably 60-160ºC, for a period<br>
of one minute to 10 hours, preferably 10 minutes to 5 hours.<br>
It is believed that the reaction of the solid material with<br>
the second titanium compound under heating forms a solid<br>
titanium catalyst component of the invention.<br>
After the solid material is contacted with the second<br>
titanium compound for a time as mentioned, the resulting<br>
solid titanium catalyst component is recovered from the<br>
suspension by filtration. It is desirable that the thus<br>
recovered solid titanium catalyst component is washed with<br>
a hydrocarbon solvent such as hexane repeatedly until no<br>
free titanium is detected from the washing.<br>
The thus obtained solid titanium catalyst component<br>
of the invention contains magnesium, titanium, halogen atoms<br>
and the polybasic carboxylic acid ester, and in addition,<br>
the electron donor if it has been used.<br>
According to the invention, the solid titanium<br>
catalyst component contains magnesium in an amount of 5-35%<br>
by weight, preferably 8-30% by weight, more preferably 10-<br>
28% by weight, most preferably 12-25% by weight; titanium<br>
in an amount of 0.3-10% by weight, preferably 0.5-8% by<br>
weight, more preferably 0.8-6% by weight, most preferably<br>
1-5% by weight; halogen atoms in an amount of 30-75% by<br>
weight, preferably 35-75% by weight, more preferably 38-72%<br>
by weight, most preferably 40-70% by weight; and the<br>
polybasic carboxylic acid ester, and if used, the electron<br>
donor, in an amount of 0.5-30% by weight, preferably 1-27%<br>
by weight, more preferably 3-25% by weight, most preferably<br>
5-23% by weight.<br>
Further according to the invention, the solid titanium<br>
catalyst component has a halogen/titanium (atomic ratio)<br>
usually of 2-200, preferably 4-90; a magnesium/titanium<br>
(atomic ratio) usually of 1-100, preferably 2-50; and an<br>
electron donor/titanium (molar ratio) usually of 0.01-100,<br>
preferably 0.05-50.<br>
The solid titanium catalyst component as defined as<br>
above mentioned, when it is used as a component of an olefin<br>
polymerization catalyst, provides polyolefins in high yields,<br>
and in addition, when it is used as a polymerization<br>
catalyst for alpha-olefins having at least three carbon<br>
atoms, it provides highly stereospecific polyolefins in<br>
high yields with a reduced amount of finely divided polymer<br>
powder (for example, having a particle size of not more<br>
than 100 micron meters).<br>
(Preparation of olefin polymerization catalyst)<br>

comprises the solid titanium catalyst component, an<br>
organometallic compound and a silane compound having Si-O-C<br>
bond in the molecule. The organometallic compound usable<br>

1-pentene, 4-methy 1 -1-pentene, vinylcyclohexane,<br>
dimethylstyrenes, allyltrialkylsilanes or allylnaphthalenes.<br>
(Process for polymerization of olefins)<br>
The process for the polymerization of olefins<br>
according to the invention comprises polymerizing an olefin<br>
or copolymerizing two or more olefins in the presence of<br>
the olefin polymerization catalyst as mentioned above which<br>
comprises the solid titanium catalyst component, the<br>
organometallic compound and the silane compound having<br>
Si-O-C bond in the molecule.<br>
A small amount of diene compounds may be copolymerized<br>
with the olefins as above mentioned. The diene compound<br>
includes, for example, butadiene, isoprene, 1,3-pentadiene,<br>

1,9-decadiene, ethy 1idenenorbornene, vinylnorbornene or<br>
dicyclopen tadiene.<br>
The polymerization of olefins may be carried out by<br>
any process; such as liquid phase polymerization, e.g.,<br>
solution or suspension polymerization, or gas phase<br>
polymerization. When the polymerization is carried out in<br>
a slurry, such an inert hydrocarbon solvent as mentioed<br>
hereinbefore may be used as a reaction solvent, or an<br>
olefin which is liquid at a temperature at which the<br>
reaction is carried out may also be used as a reaction<br>
solvent.<br>
The resulting polyolefins can be controlled in their<br>
molecular weight by using a molecular weight controlling<br>
agent such as hydrogen thereby to provide polyolefins<br>
having high melt indexes.<br>
The polymerization of olefins is carried out usually<br>
at a temperature of about 20-300ºC, preferably at about 50-<br>
150°C , usually under a pressure of normal to 100 kg/cmz,<br>
preferably about 2-50 kg/cmz, although somewhat depending<br>
on the individual olefins used or manners by which olefins<br>
are polymerized. The polymerization of olefins is carried<br>
out either batchwise, semi -batchwise or continuously. If<br>
necessary, the polymerization may be carried out in two or<br>
more stages under different reaction conditions.<br>
The use of a single olefin provides a homopolymer of<br>
the olefin, while the use of two more olefins provides a<br>
random or block copolymer of the olefins.<br>
(Preparation of preliminary olefin polymerization catalyst)<br>
According to the invention, a preliminary olefin<br>
polymerization catalyst may be prepared and then the olefin<br>
polymerization catalyst may be prepared therefrom.<br>
The preliminary olefin polymerization catalyst is<br>
prepared by polymerizing an olefin or two or more olefins<br>
preliminarily in the presence of catalyst components<br>
comprising:<br>
(A) the solid titanium catalyst component as prepared<br>
as mentioned above;<br>
(B) the organometallic compound as mentioned above;<br>
and optionally<br>
(C) the silane compound having Si-O-C bond in the<br>
molecule as mentioned above.<br>
For the preparation of the preliminary olefin<br>
polymerization catalyst, any alpha-olefin having at least<br>
two carbons may be used with no limitation. The alpha-<br>
olefin usable includes, for example, ethylene, propylene,<br>
1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 3-methyl-1-butene, 3-methyl-<br>
1-pentene, 3-ethyl-1-pentene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, 4,4-<br>
dimethyl-1-pentene, 4-methyl-1-hexene, 4,4-dimethyl-1-hexene,<br>
4-ethyl-l-hexene, 3-ethyl-1-hexene, 1-octene, 1-decene,<br>
1-dodecene, 1-tetradecene, 1-hexadecene, 1-octadecene or<br>
1-eicosene. Other vinyl compounds or polyene compounds<br>
mentioned hereinbefore may be used in place of the olefins<br>
above, or may be preliminarily polymerized togeter with the<br>
olefins above. The olefin, vinyl compound or polyene<br>
compound may be used singly or as a mixture of two or more.<br>
The olefin used in the preparation of preliminary olefin<br>
polymerization catalyst may be the same as or different<br>
front the oefin which is polymerized in a full scale later.<br>
There is no limitation in the method for preliminary<br>
polymerization of olefins. By way of example, the olefin<br>
may be polymerized in the liquid phase, if necessary in<br>
the presence of an inert reaction solvent, or in the gas<br>
phase. However, among these methods, it is preferred that<br>
the preliminary polymerization is carried out in an inert<br>
reaction solvent in the presence of the catalyst components<br>
under relatively mild reaction conditions. The resulting<br>
polymer thus preliminarily polymerized may be soluble or<br>
not in the solvent, with the latter being preferred.<br>
The preliminary polymerization of olefins is carried<br>
out either batchwise, semi -batchwise or continuously at a<br>
temperature in the range of about —20ºC to 100ºC,<br>
preferably at about — 20ºC to 80ºC, more preferably at about<br>
-10ºC to 40 ºC .<br>
In the preliminary polymerization of olefins, the<br>
catalyst may be used in a concentration higher than in the<br>
later full scale polymerization. Although depending upon<br>
the individual catalyst components used, the solid titanium<br>
catalyst component (A) is used in terms of titanium atom in<br>
an amount of about 0.001-5000 millimole parts, preferably<br>
about 0.01-1000 millimole parts, more preferably about 0.1-<br>
500 millimole parts, per liter of the volume of reactor,<br>
while the organometallic compound (B) is used in such an<br>
amount that prelinary (co)polymers are formed usually in<br>
an amount of 0.01-2000 g, preferably 0.03-1000 g, more<br>
preferably 0.05-200 g, per gram of the solid titanium<br>
catalyst component (A). Accordingly, the organometal 1 ic<br>
compound (B) is used usually in an amount of about 0.1-<br>
1000 mole parts, preferably about 0.5-500 mole parts, more<br>
preferably about 1-100 mole parts, per mole part of titanium<br>
of the solid titanium catalyst component.<br>
In the preliminary polymerization of olefins, the<br>
silane compound (C) may be used, if necessary, usually in<br>
an amount of 0.01-50 mole parts, preferably about 0.05-30<br>
mole parts, more preferably about 0.1-10 mole parts, per<br>
mole part of titanium atom of the solid titanium catalyst<br>
component (A). A molecular weight controlling agent such<br>
as hydrogen may also be used when the preliminary<br>
polymerization of olefins is carried out.<br>
When the preliminary olefin polymerization catalyst<br>
is obtained as a slurry or suspension, the catalyst may be<br>
used as it is in a later full scale polymerization of<br>
olefins, or alternatively the catalyst may be separated<br>
from the suspension and then used in the full scale<br>
polymerization.<br>
The preliminary olefin polymerization catalyst is<br>
used usually to prepare an olefin polymerization catalyst<br>
of the invention in combination with the beforementioned<br>
organometallic compound and the silane compound. However,<br>
the preliminary olefin polymerization catalyst alone may<br>
be used as an olefin polymerization catalyst as the case<br>
may be. When a silane compound has not been used in the<br>
preparation of preliminary olefin polymerization catalyst,<br>
an olefin polymerization catalyst of the invention may be<br>
prepared from the preliminary olefin polymerization catalyst<br>
and the silane compound.<br>
As set forth above, the solid titanium catalyst<br>
component of the invention provides an olefin polymerization<br>
catalyst which has high olefin polymerization activity and<br>
provides polyolefins having high stereospecificity and a<br>
high bulk density with a reduced anount of finely divided<br>
polymer powder produced.<br>
(Examples)<br>
The invention will be described with reference to<br>
examples, however, the examples are illustrative only and<br>
the invention is not limited thereto.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>

and 24 kg of magnsium chloride were placed in a 0.5 m3<br>
capacity vessel, and the mixture was heated to 14 0 °C to<br>
prepare an even solution. 5.6 kg of phthalic anhydride<br>

provide a colorless and even solution. The solution was<br>
then cooled to room temperatures to prepare a solution of<br>
the magnesium compound.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, 0.3 m3 of recovered titanium<br>
tetrachloride having the composition below was placed in<br>
a one cubic meter capacity first reactor 1, and was cooled<br>
to — 2 0 ºC , whereupon 103.2 kg of the solution of the<br>
magnesium compoud was added to the titanium tetrachloride.<br>
The recovered titanium tetrachloride was composed of 95.4%<br>

followed by stirring for two hours at the temperature.<br>
The resulting suspension was sent to a first filter 2 from<br>
the first reactor 1 under nitrogen pressure through a first<br>
pipe A where the suspension was filtrated to separate the<br>
resulting solid material. A small amount of titanium<br>
tetrachloride was added to the solid material and was then<br>

meter capacity washing apparatus 5 through a pipe D. The<br>
solid material was washed three times each with 0.4 m3 of<br>
hexane at 60 ºC and then further washed repeatedly with<br>
hexane at normal temperatures until no titanium was detected<br>
in the supernatant. After the washing in ths way, the solid<br>

together with 0.75 millimole of triethylaluminum, 0.075<br>
millimole of cyclohexylmethyldimethoxysilane (CMMS) at a<br>
temperature of 40ºC under a propylene atmosphere.<br>
200 ml of hydrogen was then fed into the autoclave<br>
at a temperature of 60 ºC, followed by heating to 70 ºC and<br>
maintaining at the temperature for two hours to carry out<br>
the polymerization of propylene while the pressure in the<br>
autoclave was maintained at 7 kg/cmz G (gage).<br>
After the polymerization, the slurry which contained<br>
the resulting polypropylene was filtrated to separate<br>
while powder, followed by drying under reduced pressures<br>

placed in a one cubic meter capacity first reactor 1<br>
together with 0.32 m3 of toluene to prepare a suspension.<br>
80 liters of titanium tetrachloride was added to the<br>

available magnesium chloride, 24.2 kg of ethanol and 3 kg<br>
of a surfactant, sorbitan distearate (Emasol 320 available<br>
from Kao Atlas K.K.), were placed in the agitator. The<br>
resulting mixture was heated to a temperature of 120 ºC<br>
with stirring and was then stirred at a rate of 800 rpm<br>
at the temperature for 30 minutes, thereby providing a<br>
suspension which contained particles of complex of magnesium<br>
chloride and ethanol.<br>
The suspension was transferred to a two cubic meter<br>
capacity reactor provided with a stirrer in which a cubic<br>
meter of purified kerosene kept at —10ºC had been placed<br>
with effective stirring through a polytetraf1uoroethylene<br>
tube having an inside diameter of 5 mm to provide solid<br>
products. The solid product was fully washed with purified<br>
kerosene.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, 0.4 m3 of titanium tetrachloride<br>
and 20 kg of the solid product were placed in a one cubic<br>
meter capacity first reactor. The resulting mixture was<br>
heated to 120 ºC in 2.5 hours. When the mixture reached a<br>
