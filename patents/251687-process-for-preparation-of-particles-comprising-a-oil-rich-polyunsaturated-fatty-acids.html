				<td>Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of particles comprising an<br>
oil rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), a particle comprising an oil rich in PUFAs<br>
dispersed in a carbohydrate material and a method for preventing oxidation and/or for<br>
increasing stability of PUFAs in oils at temperatures above 70°C. The invention further<br>
relates to food products comprising the particles.<br>
Background of the Invention and Problem to be Solved<br>
The beneficial effects of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on human health have been<br>
confirmed repeatedly. Amongst the PUFAs, especially long-chain omega-3 fatty acids<br>
such as eicosapentanoic acid (EPA) or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), for example, were<br>
shown to keep serum cholesterol levels low, stabilise irregular heart beat, reduce blood<br>
pressure, improve autoimmune diseases, improve depression disorders, and to prevent<br>
cancer of the colon.<br>
Given these and other health benefits, it becomes a general interest to provide PUFAs as a<br>
functional additive to orally ingestible matter, such as food, nutritional supplements,<br>
beverages, pills, for example.<br>
The addition of PUFAs to elements of human diet or supplements, however, is<br>
problematic due to the susceptibility of PUFAs to oxidation. In the presence of the<br>
ubiquitous oxygen, oils comprising PUFAs become quickly rancid and develop repellent<br>
odours and tastes, thus posing a hindrance to carefree consumption even in non-oxidised<br>
state.<br>
At elevated temperatures the oxidation of PUFAs is even accelerated for reaction-kinetic<br>
reasons, which explains the difficulty of using PUFAs in food manufacturing or<br>
encapsulating processes that involve heat treatments.<br><br>
Basic solutions to address the above problems propose the addition of antioxidants to oils<br>
rich in PUFAs. Daeseok et al, "Solubilisation of Vitamin C in Fish Oil and Synergistic<br>
Effect with Vitamin E in retarding Oxidation", JOACS, Vol. 68, No. 10, (October 1991)<br>
found synergistic effect of combined antioxidants vitamin E and C at ambient<br>
temperatures. Many prior art solutions for providing storable and stable preparations of<br>
PUFAs have, therefore, exploited the synergistic interaction of vitamin C and vitamin E<br>
in oils containing PUFAs.<br>
Ock-Sook et al "Synergistic Antioxidative Effects of Tocopherol and Ascorbic Acid in<br>
Fish oil/Lecithin/Water system" conclude that at least 0.01-0.02% added ascorbic acid is<br>
required to obtain a considerable synergistic effect with added 8-tocopherol in stabilizing<br>
fishoil. These references, however, are silent on the behaviour of PUFAs at temperatures<br>
above 80°C, and, in addition, they are basically theoretical and not related to practical and<br>
more complex systems involving processing PUFAs in manufacturing processes for<br>
providing a medium- or long-term storable form of PUFAs.<br>
In combination to the addition of antioxidants, oils rich in PUFAs have been encapsulated<br>
with the intention to prevent contact with oxygen and to provide a material that can easily<br>
be processed and combined with foods or other consumable matter. Preferred<br>
encapsulation systems include spray drying.<br>
US 2003/00444490 Al discloses a dry, stable oil composition comprising PUFAs, starch<br>
hydrolysate, converted starch and further, optional components, obtained by freeze- or<br>
spray drying emulsions based on the ingredients just mentioned. The process disclosed in<br>
this prior art document, however, seems to be very energy consuming due to the drying of<br>
emulsions having up to 60% water contents. In addition, this reference does not address<br>
the problem of oil remaining on the surface of the obtained spray dried particles, still<br>
prone to oxidation. Furthermore, spray-dried particles are often very small and porous<br>
and oxygen can quickly diffuse through them and get in contact with the PUFAs.<br>
US 6,048,557 discloses water-soluble, porous carrier particles onto which PUFAs have<br>
been coated or absorbed. Coating or absorption of porous carriers, however, results in<br>
unprotected PUFAs on the surface of the particles, which exposes the PUFAs of this<br><br>
teaching to oxygen and thus makes this PUFA-preparation unsuitable for storage at<br>
ambient temperature.<br>
A method for fixing a labile material in an extruded, glassy, moisture-stable substrate is<br>
taught in US 5,972, 395. Accordingly, a homogeneous substrate without any added<br>
moisture consisting of carbohydrates, sugar alcohols, and other ingredients in specified<br>
amounts is processed in a screw-extruder. However, screw-extruders operate at high<br>
pressures and under shear forces of the screws, which is generally detrimental to sensitive<br>
PUFAs. It would thus be advantageous to have a process avoiding the use of high<br>
pressures and shear forces in the preparation of capsules rich in PUFAs. In addition, the<br>
examples of this reference it emerges, however, that only low amounts (11% and less) of<br>
labile material could be encapsulated, if the labile material is not miscible in the other<br>
components. In view of this prior art it is desirable to provide a stable, powdered<br>
preparation comprising higher loads of PUFAs.<br>
In view of the prior art there is a need for providing PUFAs in a form that warrants<br>
stability of the PUFAs over a time range of several months at room temperature. In other<br>
words, the PUFAs should be encapsulated in way to allow their application to shelf-stable<br>
products. More particularly, there is a need to provide encapsulated PUFAs, wherein<br>
capsules provide a significant barrier to oxygen and have higher loads of oil rich in<br>
PUFAs to be encapsulated than comparable systems of the prior art. On the other hand, it<br>
is an objective to provide a possibility of encapsulating PUFAs in methods entailing high-<br>
temperature exposure to the PUFAs, preventing oxidation during the encapsulation<br>
process and the consequent development of off-tastes. In view of the many propositions<br>
for encapsulating PUFAs of the prior art, it is a further objective to provide a different<br>
method for encapsulating PUFAs, preferably being more cost efficient.<br>
Furthermore, it is an objective to provide capsules having a sufficiently high glass<br>
transition temperature (To) to warrant stability at room temperature. Advantageously, TG<br>
of a powder comprising encapsulating particles should be above 25°C, or even above<br>
30°C.<br><br>
Moreover, it is an objective to provide a process in which the above advantages are<br>
maintained on a pilot plant and/or industrial scale.<br>
Furthermore, it is an objective of the invention to provide food products with PUFAs<br>
without modifying the organoleptic properties of the food product over storage time<br>
and/or shelf life.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Remarkably, the inventors of the present invention found a way to encapsulate an oil rich<br>
in PUFAs in a process entailing temperatures above 70°C and, if desired, even above<br>
100°C. Surprisingly, the oil encapsulated by this process remains shelf stable over<br>
several months without developing malodours or off-tastes. The method of the invention<br>
provides advantageous capsules having relatively high loads of encapsulated oil but<br>
negligible amounts of residual oil on the surface of the capsules. In addition, the capsules<br>
surprisingly provide an efficient oxygen barrier and make them suitable to encapsulate<br>
oxidation-susceptible material.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides, in a first aspect, a process for the preparation<br>
of a particles comprising an oil comprising polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), the<br>
method comprising the steps of:<br>
-	adding water to at least one carbohydrate material to obtain an aqueous mixture;<br>
-	heating the aqueous mixture to form a concentrated syrup;<br>
-	emulsifying the oil rich in PUFAs, optionally comprising antioxidants, in the<br>
concentrated syrup to obtain an emulsion;<br>
-	extruding the emulsion through a die to obtain an extruded emulsion;<br>
-	cooling the extruded emulsion by putting or dropping it into a cold liquid to form<br>
a solid extruded material;<br>
-	washing the solid extruded material with a solvent liquid, and,<br>
-	drying it.<br><br>
In a second aspect, the present invention provides a particle comprising an oil rich in<br>
PUFAs dispersed in a carbohydrate material, characterised in that the particle has a<br>
residual surface oil content being ≤ 0.2 % of the total weight of the particles.<br>
In a third aspect, the present invention provides a method for preventing oxidation and/or<br>
for increasing stability of PUFAs in oils at temperatures above. 70°C, the method<br>
comprising the step of adding to the oil at least 0.6 % by weight of lecithin prior to<br>
exposure of the oil to the temperature above 70°C.<br>
In a further aspect, the present invention provides a food product comprising the particles<br>
of the present invention.<br>
The particles of the invention have the advantage to develop less or no fish-taste during a<br>
prolonged shelf-life, due to the very limited amount of surface oil. At the same time, it<br>
shows that the capsules of the present invention provide an effective barrier against<br>
oxygen, unlike other particles such as spray dried or screw-extruded ones.<br>
Description<br>
Within the context of this specification the word "comprises" is taken to mean "includes,<br>
among other things". It is not intended to be construed as "consists only of.<br>
In the context of the present invention, percentages are percentages by weight of dry<br>
matter, unless otherwise indicated. Similarly, if proportions are indicated as parts, parts of<br>
weight of dry matter are meant.<br>
The term "oil rich in PUFAs" refers to an oil comprising at least 5wt.-% of PUFAs.<br>
Preferably, it is an oil comprising at least 10wt.-%, preferably at least 25wt.-% of PUFAs.<br>
For example, it is an oil comprising DHA and/or EPA.<br>
Some of the basic process steps of the present invention have been reported from the prior<br>
art, without showing their suitability for encapsulation of oils rich in PUFAs. For<br>
example, US 4,707,367 illustrates a process for encapsulating an essential oil flavour<br><br>
composition including the steps of preparing an aqueous mixture, preparing an emulsion<br>
and extruding the same into a cold solvent. Therefore, this patent is explicitly<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The process of the present invention comprises the step of adding water to at least one<br>
carbohydrate material to obtain an aqueous mixture. On the other hand, the particle of the<br>
present invention comprises an oil rich in PUFAs dispersed in a carbohydrate material.<br>
As the carbohydrate material in the process and the particle of the present invention, any<br>
carbohydrate or carbohydrate derivative, which can be processed through extrusion<br>
techniques to form a dry extruded solid can be used.<br>
Preferably, the carbohydrate material comprises at least one water-soluble carbohydrate.<br>
The term "water-soluble carbohydrate" means that the carbohydrate is at least 50%<br>
soluble according to the method described by L. Prosky et al., J. Assoc. Off. Anal. Chem.<br>
71, 1017-1023 (1988).<br>
Particular examples of suitable materials include those selected from the group consisting<br>
of sucrose, glucose, lactose, levulose, fructose, maltose, ribose, dextrose, isomalt,<br>
sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol, lactitol, maltitol, pentatol, arabinose, pentose, xylose,<br>
galactose, hydrogenated starch hydrolysates, maltodextrin, agar, carrageenan, other gums,<br>
polydextrose, cyclodextrin, synthetic polymers such as polyvinyl alcohol, semi-synthetic<br>
polymers such as succinylated starch, for example, alkenyl succinylated starch, cellulose<br>
ethers, and derivatives and mixtures thereof.<br>
Preferably, maltodextrin or mixtures of maltodextrin and at least one material selected<br>
from the group consisting of sucrose, glucose, lactose, levulose, maltose, dextrose,<br>
maltotriose, fructose, isomalt, sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol, lactitol, maltitol and<br>
hydrogenated starch hydrolysates will be used. Preferably, the maltodextrin has a dextrose<br>
equivalent (DE) of ≤20) and more preferably a DE of about 18.<br>
Preferably, the carbohydrate material comprises from 30 to 70%, more preferably from 40<br>
to 60% of maltodextrin.<br><br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the carbohydrate material comprises from 30<br>
to 70%, more preferably from 40 to 60% by weight of carbohydrates having a molecular<br>
weight of &gt;950.<br>
Preferably, the carbohydrate material comprises from 40 to 60%, more preferably from 30<br>
to 49% of sucrose.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the carbohydrate material of the particle of the<br>
invention, or used in the process of the present invention, comprises from 30% to 49% of<br>
carbohydrates having a molecular weight of 
The above mentioned carbohydrate materials are hereby given by way of example and<br>
they are not to be interpreted as limiting the invention. Although different carbohydrates<br>
are mentioned above as specific examples, it is clear that any material which is extrudable<br>
and currently used as a matrix material in the production of extruded solids appropriate<br>
for applications comprising oils rich in PUFAs is adequate for the aim of the invention<br>
and is therefore hereby included in the latter.<br>
Water is added to the carbohydrate material to obtain an aqueous mixture. Preferably, the<br>
aqueous mixture comprises about 12-40%, more preferably 18-30% of water. Taking into<br>
account that carbohydrate materials are generally hygroscopic and have residual water of<br>
about 2-4%, the actually added water may be less than the above indicate values.<br>
The step of obtaining an aqueous mixture may be performed in a pressure resistant stirred<br>
vessel, to which both, the carbohydrate material and the water have been added.<br>
The present invention further comprises the step of heating the aqueous mixture to form a<br>
concentrated syrup. Preferably, the aqueous mixture is heated sufficiently to allow water<br>
to evaporate from it. For example it may be heated to a temperature in the range of 110-<br>
135°C in a pressure resistant stirred vessel.<br><br>
Water may be evaporated from the aqueous mixture until a concentrated syrup having<br>
from 3 -15%, preferably 4 -12% water is obtained.<br>
The present invention provides particles comprising oils rich in PUFAs. Furthermore, the<br>
process of the present invention includes a step of emulsifying an oil rich in PUFAs in the<br>
concentrated syrup to obtain an emulsion.<br>
Oils rich in PUFAs are commercially obtainable. Such oils may be of different origins<br>
such as fish or algae. It is also possible that these oils are enriched in the PUFA content<br>
via different methods such as molecular distillation, a process through which the<br>
concentration of selected fatty acids may be increased.<br>
In an embodiment of the process or the particles according to the present invention, the<br>
oil rich in PUFAs comprises PUFAs selected from the group consisting of<br>
eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), Arachidonic acid (ARA),<br>
and a mixture of at least two of them.<br>
The oil rich in PUFA may, optionally, be supplemented with an antioxidant. For example,<br>
the antioxidant-supplemented oil may comprise added ascorbic acid (vitamin C),<br>
tocopherol (vitamin E), or both of them Tocopherol may be α-, γ-, or δ-tocopherol, or<br>
mixtures including two or more of these, and is commercially available.<br>
Tocopherols are soluble in oils and may be easily added at amounts in the range of 0.05-<br>
2%, preferably 0.1-0.9%, of the supplemented oil comprising the antioxidant.<br>
Ascorbic acid may be added at amount of 0.05-5% of the supplemented oil, for example.<br>
Ascorbic acid is not readily soluble in oils, but may be solubilised therein, for example<br>
via reversed micelles using lecithin or phosphatidyl choline as a surfactant and water. See<br>
Han and Shin, "Antioxidative effect of Ascorbic Acid olubilized in Oils via Reversed<br>
Micelles", Journal of Food Science, Vol 55, No. 1, 1990, 247-249.<br><br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the oil comprising PUFAs contains less than<br>
1% by weight of added ascorbic acid. Preferably, the oil comprises less than 0.5% of<br>
added ascorbic acid. More preferably, the oil comprises less than 0.05% of added ascorbic<br>
acid. Most preferably, the oil is free of ascorbic acid.<br>
Surprisingly, the inventors of the present invention found that the stability of the oil<br>
comprising PUFAs could be maintained, even at elevated temperatures, although no or<br>
only very little ascorbic acid was added. Equally, the stability of the oil comprising<br>
PUFAs could be maintained, although no or only little tocopherol (0.1 - 0.9 wt.-% of oil)<br>
was added. Without wishing to be bound by theory, the present inventors believe that by<br>
adding sufficient amounts of lecithin, no or only little amounts of antioxidants needs to be<br>
added to protect the oil rich in PUFAs from oxidation. It was hypothesised that lecithin, if<br>
added in sufficient amounts, could work itself as an antioxidant and/or sufficiently<br>
enhance the antioxidant properties of residual tocopherol, that is, tocopherol naturally<br>
present in the oil rich in PUFAs or added in amounts of 0.1 - 0.9 wt.%. This is an<br>
important advantage, also due to the fact that lecithin is more easily available than<br>
ascorbic acid or tocopherol and thus much less expensive.<br>
Therefore, the present invention provides, in an aspect, a method for preventing oxidation<br>
and/or for increasing stability of PUFAs in oils at temperatures above 70°C, more<br>
preferably above 90°, above 100°C, above 110°C, even above 120°C and up to 135°C,<br>
the method comprising the step of adding to the oil at least 1.5% of lecithin by weight of<br>
the oil rich in PUFAs prior to exposure of the oil to the temperatures given above.<br>
Preferably, at least 2% by weight of lecithin is added, and more preferably even more, as<br>
indicated by the ranges given below.<br>
Therefore, in an embodiment of the particle and the process of the present invention, the<br>
oil rich in PUFAs further comprises 1.5-15% of added lecithin. Preferably, the oil<br>
comprises 3-12%, more preferably 4-10% of added lecithin, by weight of the oil rich in<br>
PUFAs optionally supplemented with ascorbic acid and/or tocopherol.<br>
Preferably, the oil rich in PUFAs is mixed with the concentrated syrup under relatively<br>
low shear forces to uniformly disperse the oil rich in PUFAs throughout the concentrated<br><br>
syrup. For example a stirred vessel may be used to perform this step. However, any other<br>
way of preparing the emulsion may be suitable for example preparing a microemulsion<br>
with the oil rich in PUFAs and mixing it into the concentrated syrup.<br>
Therefore, in an embodiment of the particle of the present invention, the oil rich in<br>
PUFAs, during the preparation of the particle, has been exposed to temperatures above<br>
100°C, more preferably above 110°C, and even more preferably above 120°C.<br>
The extruding step comprises the forcing of the emulsion through the holes of the die,<br>
thus forming strands of the extruded emulsion, which may later fall into a cold liquid, for<br>
example a cold solvent bath. Extrusion may be forced using gas or mechanical pressure.<br>
The extrusion pressure is preferably in the range of from 1.5 to 7x105 Pa, preferably 1.5 to<br>
3x105 Pa The force for extruding may be supplied by a pump, for example a gear-pump<br>
operating at a fixed speed resulting in a constant extrusion rate, or by pressurized air or a<br>
gas, such as pressurized nitrogen, for example.<br>
The holes in the die plate may have a diameter adjusted to the final application of the<br>
capsules of the present invention. Preferably, the holes have a diameter of 0.3 - 5mm,<br>
more preferably, 0.5 - 2mm, for example.<br>
In an embodiment of the process of the present invention, the emulsion, when leaving the<br>
die and before being cooled in the cool liquid, is characterised in that it has a temperature<br>
of 100 to 135°C, preferably 110 to 130°C, more preferably 115-130° and most preferably<br>
120-130°C. Actually, this temperature was already obtained within the extrusion vessel<br>
and expresses the fact that the oil rich in PUFAs within the emulsion is exposed to<br>
temperatures above 100°C and up to 130°C, or even up to 135°C.<br>
In a further step, the present invention provides the cooling by putting or dropping it into<br>
a cold liquid to form a solid extruded material. Preferably, the extruding step results in<br>
vertically extruded strands that are guided by gravity to a beneath-placed bath of a cold<br>
liquid. The cold liquid is preferably present within a vessel suitable to withhold liquids in<br>
the range of -200 to 100°C. The vessel may contain a blade impeller allowing the stirring<br>
of the cold liquid, and, at the same time, the disintegration of the strands of the extruded<br><br>
emulsion reaching the cold liquid In the cold liquid, the strands are thus chilled and<br>
broken into smaller particles.<br>
The cold liquid may be a cold organic solvent, such as hexane, for example. Preferably,<br>
the organic solvent is isopropanol. Alternatively, the cold liquid may be liquid nitrogen.<br>
Alternatively, the cold liquid may be limonene, and/or a plant extract of citrus-fruits<br>
comprising high amounts of limonene. The cold liquid is preferably held in a stirred<br>
vessel. In addition, the cold liquid may me a mixture of several solvents. Preferably, the<br>
cold liquid comprises limonene and isopropanol. More preferably, the cold liquid<br>
comprises 5-30% isopropanol and 95-70% limonene.<br>
Preferably, the cold liquid has a temperature in the range of 20 to -200°C, more<br>
preferably 15 to -80°C, most preferably 5 to - 20°C. Generally, the temperature is<br>
sufficiently low as to permit the forming of a solid, glassy state from the extruded<br>
emulsion. Preferably, the temperature is below the boiling point of the cold liquid. This<br>
temperature preferably is the temperature of the cold liquid before the extruded emulsion<br>
is dropped into it.<br>
During cooling, the particles are forming a solid extruded material. In particular, the<br>
cooling occurs so quick that the extruded emulsion immediately transforms into a solid,<br>
glassy state.<br>
Thereafter, the particles are removed from the cold liquid, for example by centrifugation<br>
or sieving. Therefore, in an embodiment, the process of the present invention comprises a<br>
step of separating the solid extruded material from the cold liquid. This step may be easily<br>
carried out by providing an outlet valve and a sieve located upstream the outlet valve<br>
within the vessel containing the cold liquid. In this case, after having sufficiently cooled,<br>
the solid extruded material may be separated from the cold liquid by simply emptying the<br>
vessel by letting the cold liquid leave through the outlet valve.<br>
In a further step, the present invention provides washing the solid extruded material.<br>
Preferably, the solid extruded material, which preferably has the form of particles, is<br><br>
washed in a solvent liquid. Preferably, the solvent liquid is suitable to substantially<br>
remove surface oil, located on the surface of the particles formed by the glassy material.<br>
Preferably, the solvent liquid is an extract from citrus fruits rich in limonene. Limonene is<br>
present in the rind of citrus fruits. During production of juices, the oil of the rind is<br>
separated, and, valuable flavours are fragranced are recovered. The bulk of the oil,<br>
however, is limonene, which traditionally is disposed off. Surprisingly, this abundantly<br>
and inexpensively available waste product of citrus-oil production is particularly suitable<br>
to remove surface oil from the solid extruded material. In this way, the present inventors<br>
found a very useful and advantageous use for limonene. Therefore, in an embodiment of<br>
the process according to present invention the solvent liquid comprises terpenes obtained<br>
from citrus fruits.<br>
Therefore, the particles that have been separated from the cold liquid above may be<br>
transported into vessel containing a solvent, preferably limonene. The washing takes<br>
preferably place under agitation or stirring in a way that the particles are not further<br>
disintegrated or broken apart, for example, by slowly stirring the solvent with a blade<br>
impeller not getting into contact with the particles. After the washing step, the solvent<br>
liquid may be removed as described above for the cold liquid.<br>
In an embodiment of the process of the present invention, the cooling step and the<br>
washing step are both performed in the same cold solvent liquid. The inventors of the<br>
present invention have thus surprisingly found that during the step of cooling the extruded<br>
material to form a solid glassy material, the surface oil can be effectively removed at the<br>
same time.<br>
Even more surprisingly, the cooling and the washing step can both be conducted in<br>
solvents comprising plant extracts rich in limonene mentioned before. This has the<br>
particular advantage that only a natural cold solvent liquid is used, which does not have to<br>
be totally removed subsequently and which is unproblematic from a handling and<br>
regulatory point of view. In addition, the use of natural plant extracts rich in limonene in<br>
the process of the present invention is far less expensive than the use of traditional<br><br>
solvents. Preferably, the limonene, or the solvent comprising limonene has a temperature<br>
as the cold liquid defined above.<br>
However, the cooling and the washing step may be performed within the same process<br>
step in a cold solvent liquid which may also be isopropanol, liquid nitrogen, hexane,<br>
others, or mixtures of two or more of these, for example. For example, the cold solvent<br>
liquid may be free of limonene.<br>
This embodiment, where the cooling and washing step are performed in the same cold<br>
solvent liquid has a substantial advantage over prior art process for encapsulating oils rich<br>
in PUFAs, for example by prior art screw-extrusion processes, because the use of a cold<br>
solvent directly after extrusion first results in a denser matrix, resulting in a more<br>
effective oxygen barrier and thus increased stability, while at the same time (and in the<br>
same step) effectively removing surface oil and thus preventing off-flavours based on<br>
oxidised surface oil<br>
In a further step, the process of the present invention comprises drying the washed, solid<br>
extruded material. This step may be performed to remove residual solvent from the<br>
particles. Suitable drying apparatuses could be multiple tray type dryers, rotary drum<br>
driers or fluidised bed dryers, for example, with typical residence times of 1-8 hours<br>
(rotary drum) or 30 - 60 minutes (fluidised bed), respectively.<br>
Preferably, particles of the washed solid extruded material are dried to achieve a water<br>
content in the range of 2 - 7% by weight of the capsules including the water.<br>
During the drying step an anticaking agent may be added. Once the particles have been<br>
dried, they may further be mixed with a free-flowing agent and subsequently sifted to<br>
meet size specification.<br>
The particles of the present invention are found to have a low surface content of residual<br>
oil, which is ≤ 0.2% of the total weight of the particles, preferably, the surface oil is<br>
≤	0.1%,-more preferably ≤ 0.08, even more preferably ≤ 0.05, and most preferably<br>
≤	0.04% by weight of the total weight of the particles. The residual oil on the surface, also<br>
called surface oil hereinafter, is determined by the following protocol:<br><br>
1) Solutions<br>
For preparing a calibration curve: estimate the residual surface oil content, establish<br>
solutions of the oil rich in PUFAs in hexane including the expected content. If possible,<br>
use the same oil used in the encapsulation system. If not possible, use oil that has the<br>
same or very close properties.<br>
21 Standards<br>
5.0000g of particles are put into an Erlenmeyer.<br>
15 mL of hexane are added and the Erlenmeyer is immediately stirred for 20 minutes<br>
(without magnetic bar to avoid breaking the particles).<br>
The solvent-powder mix is filtered into a 25 mL measuring flask<br>
The Erlenmeyer is washed with 2 x 5 mL of hexane, the filter is washed with 1 x 2 mL of<br>
hexane, the volume is adjusted to exactly 25 mL.<br>
3) Injection conditions<br>
HPLC MERCK<br>
Diode array detector MERCK L-7450<br>
Column thermostst L-5020<br>
Autosampler AS-4000<br>
Loop: 20 µl<br>
Use the pump isocratically at 1,0 ml/min flow rate<br>
Solvent B : hexane (50)<br>
Solvent C : tetrahydrofuran (50)<br>
Pressure limit:<br>
min: 2 bars<br>
max: 250 bars<br>
Run: 5 min<br>
4) Calculation<br>
A calibration curve is determined based on the information obtained in point 1) above.<br>
The percentage of surface oil of the samples can be calculated based on the calibration<br>
curve.<br><br>
The particles of the present invention are, surprisingly, found to provide an effective<br>
barrier to oxygen, which may be explained, without wanting to be bound by theory, by<br>
the relatively high density of the amorphous matrix built up by the carbohydrate material<br>
during the step of cooling the extruded emulsion in the cold liquid. The particles of the<br>
present invention differentiate from those obtained by screw extrusion, because in the<br>
latter usually higher pressures are used, resulting in greater expansion of the extruded<br>
emulsions immediately after the extrusion holes. In these processes, particles with lower<br>
densities of the carbohydrate glassy material are obtained, providing a less efficient<br>
oxygen barrier.<br>
Therefore, in an embodiment, the particle of the present invention has a density of ≥ 1.3<br>
g/cm3, preferably ≥ 1.35 g/cm3 based on an oil content of 10%. The density is determined<br>
based on the dry weight of the particles.<br>
In an embodiment, the particle of the present invention is obtainable by the process of the<br>
present invention. More preferably, it is obtained by this process.<br>
Preferably, the particles according to the present invention have a glass transition<br>
temperature (TG) above 20°C, more preferably above 25°C, even more preferably above<br>
30°C and most preferably above 37°C. TG was determined with a Perkin-Elmer DSC 7.<br>
Samples (about 10 mg each) were cooled to -20°C and held for 5 minutes. Temperature<br>
was ramped at 10°C/min to 120°C followed by quenching at -20°C. After a 5-minute<br>
hold, the temperature was ramped to 120°C at a rate of 10°C/minute. TG was determined<br>
by the inflection of the heat flow curve of the rescan. Duplicate samples of each product<br>
were run.<br>
The present invention provides a food product comprising the particles of the invention.<br>
In an embodiment, the food product has a water activity of below 0.5. Preferably, the food<br>
product has a water activity below 0.45, below 0.4, below 0.35 or even below 0.3. Most<br>
preferably, the water activity is below 0.25, 0.2, 0.15 or even below 0.1. With relatively<br>
low availability of free water in a food product, as is the case with the parameter of water<br>
activity as set out above, the matrix of the particles of the invention remains intact for a<br>
longer time and thus better protects the oil rich in PUFAs from oxygen.<br><br>
Water activity is preferably measured with an Aqualab CX-2 apparatus (Decagon<br>
Devices, Inc., Pullman, Washington, USA). The apparatus is to be used according to the<br>
user's manual. In particular the thermostatic water bath connected to the apparatus is<br>
"adjusted to 20°C Start the procedure once the sample has been made thermostatic in the<br>
chamber foreseen for this. At the end of the procedure, check that temperature still is at<br>
20 ±0.5 °C.<br>
In an embodiment, the food product of the invention is selected from the group consisting<br>
of an instant soup, a breakfast cereal, a powdered milk, a baby food, a powdered junior<br>
drink, a powdered chocolate drink, a spread, a powdered cereal drink, a chewing gum, an<br>
effervescent tablet, a cereal bar, and a chocolate bar.<br>
The powdered milks or drinks are products, which are usually consumed after<br>
reconstitution of the product with water, milk and/or a juice, or another aqueous liquid.<br>
The baby food may be an infant formula, for example.<br>
The food product of the invention preferably is a particulate or powdery food, and the<br>
particles of the invention may easily be added thereto by dry-mixing. Preferably, the<br>
particles are added in an amount, which provides 10-100%, preferably 20-80% of the<br>
recommended daily allowance (RDA) of PUFAs per serving size of the food product.<br>
More preferably, a serving of the food product provides the above percentages of RDA of<br>
DHA.<br>
The following examples represent particular embodiments of the present invention<br>
without limiting its general scope.<br>
Example 1<br>
Preparation of Particles Comprising Fish-Oil<br>
A 20wt.-% aqueous solution of gum arabic is prepared. 3.166kg of the solution is mixed<br>
with 3.66kg of water in a tank suitable to withstand pressures of up to 10 bars and having,<br>
on its bottom, an outlet valve with die holes. The tank is equipped with a mechanical<br>
stirrer.<br><br>
To this solution, 7.5 kg of maltodextrin with DE = 18, 9.96 kg of sucrose and 16 g of<br>
lecithin (=10% of total lecithin) are added.<br>
The resulting aqueous mixture of carbohydrates is heated under stirring until a<br>
concentrated syrup having about 8-10% water content is obtained. This occurs at about<br>
115°C.<br>
In parallel, 140 g of lecithin are dissolved in 1.7 kg of fish oil rich in polyunsaturated fatty<br>
acids. The resulting oil is emulsified in the concentrated syrup under stirring. Thus, an<br>
emulsion is obtained.<br>
The emulsion is then heated to about 130°C and the tank is pressurized with nitrogen up<br>
to 5 bars. Thereafter, the outlet bottom valve is opened and the emulsion is thus pushed<br>
through the die and forms long thin strands, which are falling into a vessel equipped with<br>
a blade-impeller and containing isopropanol at -4°C.<br>
The strands of the extruded emulsion, when dropping into the agitated cool isopropanol,<br>
solidify and are subsequently disintegrated into a glassy material having the form of small<br>
rods.<br>
The Isopropyl alcohol is removed from the disintegration reactor through an outlet valve.<br>
The small rods are retained in the vessel thanks to a fine sieve located before the outlet<br>
valve.<br>
One half of all of the glassy material is retained in the vessel and the other half is<br>
removed and dried as described further below.<br>
Two parts of limonene are added to the vessel containing one part of rods. The agitation is<br>
again initiated in a way that the rods in the reactor are not further disintegrated. This<br>
process is referred to as washing process.<br>
The washing process lasts for 10min. After this time the limonene is evacuated through<br>
the vessel outlet valve.<br><br>
The small rods washed with limonene are placed in a drum drier and 1wt.-%g of an anti-<br>
caking agent (SiO2) are added. Drying is performed at 80°C for 8 hours.<br>
The rods that were recovered from the disintegrator reactor before the addition of<br>
limonene are also placed in a drum drier, supplied with an anti-caking agent and dried as<br>
described above.<br>
Once the drying process is terminated a 10 grams sample of rods from each drum drier is<br>
taken to analyse the total oil content as well as the surface oil content. It was found that<br>
the glassy material in the form of rods comprised 10wt.-% of fish oil, in the washed as<br>
well as in the non-washed sample.<br>
For assessing the surface oil, the method according to the description is used.<br>
Accordingly, the oil that remains on the surface of the glassy material in the non-washed<br>
rods is in the range of 0.1-0.5% of the total weight of the glassy material. The sample that<br>
has been further washed with limonene had a surface oil content in the range of 0.01-<br>
0.05% of the total weight of the glassy material.<br>
Example 2<br>
Particles having a load of oil rich in PUFAs of 15%by weight of the total capsules are<br>
prepared. Accordingly, the ingredients in the table below were processed according to the<br>
protocol of Example 1.<br><br><br>
Example 3<br>
The particles obtained in Examples 1 and 2 were stored at 30°C for 6 months. At regular<br>
intervals, the particles were tested by sniffing. During the period of six months, no fish-<br>
odour or typical rancid smell could be noticed.<br>
Examples 4-34<br>
Food Product Comprising the Encapsulated Fish Oil<br>
Commercially obtainable food products having a water activity below 0.5 were dry-mixed<br>
with varying quantities (2-5g) of the particles obtained in example 1. Effervescent<br>
tablets, compressed tablets were made following standard recipes and procedures devoid<br>
of active principles (only standard filler materials). Similarly, cereal bars were made with<br>
state of the art procedures and ingredients. Two (2) grams of these particles correspond to<br>
30% of the Recommended Daily Intake of DHA.<br>
The products were tested, after reconstitution or short cooking if applicable, for fishy taste<br>
by sniffing (10-30 persons). Table 1 below lists the commercially obtainable food<br>
products and the food-category to which they belong. In addition, the table lists the water<br>
activity of the respective food products, the amount of particles added per quantity of the<br>
respective food product and the summarized outcome of the sensory evaluation.<br>
In all products having a water activity below 0.5, no fishy taste was observed upon<br>
consumption.<br>
