"PROCESS FOR HYDROLYTICALLY OBAINING<br>
CARBOXYLIC ACID AND ALCOHOL FROM THE <br>
CORRESPONDING CARBOXYLATE"<br>
SULZER CHEMTECH AG, of Hegifeldstrasse 10, CH-8404 Winterthur, Switzerland and WACKER CHEMIE GMBH, of Hans-Seidel-Platz 4, D-81737 Munchen, Germany,<br>
The   following  specification   particularly   describes   the   nature   of  the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to a process and to a device for the simultaneous hydrolycic cleavage of a carboxylate into the corresponding, carboxylic and al¬cohol.<br>
Background of the  Invention<br>
[0002]  Carboxylates, especially low molecular weight carboxylates, occur in the chemical industry during various reactions as by-products or main products. For example, methyl acetate is a typical by-product in the production of - purified polyvinyl alcohol. Methyl ace¬tate mixtures from polyvinyl alcohol plants, besides a small amount of low-boiling substances 'such as acetal- dehyde. contain an azeotropic mixture of methyl acetate and methanol.<br>
[0003] For chemical companies, where methyl acetate as a by-product occurs in relatively small quantities, methyl acetate is not an economically interesting prod¬uct, since it cannot be profitably sold on the market. A better price can be obtained if methyl acetate is hy-drolysed into acetic acid and methanol. The hydrolysis can be carried out either as a batch process or con¬tinuously, by using either a reactor in conjunction with conventional .distillation or a single reactive . distillation column.<br>
[0004] The use of a reactor in conjunction with a dis¬tillation column for the hydrolysis of methyl acetate is described, for example, in US 4,352,940. This type of hydrolysis of methyl acetate has several disadvan-<br><br><br>
tages; (a) since the reaction is an equilibrium reac¬tion with a small equilibrium constant, the yield of reaction product is small, (b) because of the aniso¬tropic mixture which is sec up in the reaction mixture between methyl acetate/water, on the one hand, and methyl acetate/methanol, on the other, several distil¬lation stages are needed after the reaction. This leads to high investment and running costs, (c) corrosion problems occur because homogeneous catalysts such as sulphuric and hydrochloric acid are used in the known conventional processes.<br>
[0005] "US 5,113,015 discloses a process for obtaining<br>
acetic acid from methyl acetate, in which methyl ace¬<br>
tate and water are brought into contact in the presence<br>
of catalyse packing in a distillation column. In this<br>
case, the methyl acetate is hydrolysed into acetic acid<br>
and methanol. The resulting reaction mixture is in this<br>
case partially separated at the same time in the sepa¬<br>
ration column.	<br>
[0006] US 5,770,770 likewise discloses a process for the hydrolysis of a methyl acetate mixture in a reac¬tive distillation column. The hydrolysis of a methyl acetate flow, which contains more than 50% methyl ace¬tate, takes place in a reaction zone   in which ion ex¬change packing is present. The methyl acetate mixture is supplied from below to the ion exchange packing/ and water from above onto the ion exchange packing. The un-reacted methyl acetate and water vapour are collected and condensed in the upper part of the reaction zone, and are then recycled back to the reaction 2one. At the same time, the base is collected and separated into the hydrolysis products and impurities. The impurities are then returned to the reaction zone.<br><br>
[0007]  Both aforementioned US patents, 5,113,015 and 5,770,770, teach the use of strongly acid ion exchang¬ers as catalysts. In US 5,770,770. it is proposed to put the ion exchange material in the form of Raschig rings, by adding a plastic as binder to the ion ex¬changer and pressing the mixture into appropriate shapes. In US 5,113,015, the catalyst material is con¬served in glass wool, and the mat formed therefrom is rolled up with a wire mesh between the layers, in order to promote circulation of the fluids. The catalyst packing material may be a compliant open-mesh sub¬stance, e.g. a metal cloth. Another usable material is a more rigid cellular monolith, which can be produced from steel, polymers or ceramic material. The catalyst packing material may, however, also be produced from corrugated metal sheets or corrugated plastic or ce¬ramic plates.<br>
(0 008]  The processes described above, which use only a single reactive distillation column, suffer from the fact that methyl acetate is only partially converted to methanol and acetic acid. The amount of methyl acetate in the product flow makes the use of at least one addi¬tional purification stage necessary, which leads to ad¬ditional investment and running costs. A further prob¬lem is that the methyl acetate feed flow often contains metal ions, which poison the catalyst in the reactive distillation column. The replacement of the catalyst material in the distillation column by fresh material, however, is laborious and expensive. Furthermore, it is desirable for the hydrolysis process to be controlled -independently of the methyl acetate concentration in the feed flow - in such a way that, as required by the operator e.g. of a polyvinyl alcohol plant, the acetic<br><br>
acid obtained has a specific water content or is virtu¬ally anhydrous.<br>
[0009] The object of the present invention is therefore to provide an improved process for the hydrolysis of a carboxylate, especially methyl acetate, methyl formate and allyl acetate, by using a reactive distillation column. In  particular, it is desirable to improve the conversion ratio of carboxylates into alcohol and car-boxylic acid. A further object is to prevent poisoning of the catalyst used in the distillation column. An¬other object is to optimise the energy budget of the process. It is also intended to offer a process and a hydrolysis device, which allow great flexibility in terms of composition and quantity of the feed. The com¬position of the product flows is also intended to be controllable in a large range by the process. A further object is to improve the conversion ratio of methyl acetate into acetic acid and methanol.<br>
Discription<br>
[0010] According to the invention, this is achieved in the case of a process according to the precharacteris-ing clause of Claim 1,   in that the feed containing the carboxylate is firstly fed into a pre-reactor, in which the carboxylate is brought into contact with a first catalyst in the presence of water, by means of which, the carboxylate is partially cleaved into the hydroly¬sis products. The reaction mixture from the pre-reactor is fed into the reactive distillation column, and is brought into contact with a second hydrolysis catalyst for at least partial conversion of the remaining car¬boxylate into the corresponding carboxylic acid and al¬cohol. The process according to the invention has the surprising advantage that a substantially higher con-<br><br>
version ratio can be achieved Chan with known proc¬esses. A further advantage is that, by the use of a pre-reactor, the working life of the reactive distilla¬tion column can be substantially lengthened,  since catalyst poisons, e.g. metal ions, are predominantly trapped in the pre-reactor. A further advantage is that, by the pre-reactor, differences or fluctuations in the feed quantity or in the mixture composition can be compensated. Yet another advantage is that the par¬ticle size of the catalyst material used in the pre-reactor plays a less important role than in the case of the catalyst packings advantageously used in the reac¬tive distillation column. Batches with a specific par¬ticle size are normally used for catalyst packings, since the catalyst material could not otherwise be fully retained by the partially permeable packing walls.<br>
[0011] Advantageously, at least the head flow of the reactive distillation column or the base flow is deliv¬ered to at least one further separation stage, and is at least partially separated into the components. One or more downstream separation stages are preferably used if the resulting reaction mixture is to be sepa¬rated as fully as possible into the individual compo¬nents.<br>
[0012] Advantageously, the carboxylate flow is mixed with at least an eguimolar amount of water, and the carboxylate/water mixture is fed into the pre-reactor. The molar ratio between carboxylate and water is expe¬diently between approximately 1:1 and. 1:15, preferably between 1:2 and 1:10, and more particularly preferably between 1:4 and 1:7. The hydrolysis proceeds particu¬larly well if the carboxylate/water ratio in the feed flow is between 1:3 and 1:5.<br><br>
[00133 Although the hydrolysis reaction can actually be carried out at room temperature, the caarboxylate/water mixture is preferably heated to a temperature of be¬tween 30 and ioo°C, preferably from 40 to 90°C, and more particularly preferably between 50 and 80 °C, since the reaction proceeds well and quickly at these tem¬peratures. The reaction mixture from the pre-reactor is expediently fed into the reactive distillation column in the region either where the catalyst is arranged, or slightly above or below this region. The head flow con¬taining alcohol, water, carboxylate and volatile compo¬nents may be delivered to a further separation stage, preferably a distillation column, in which the mixture is further separated.<br>
[0014]  Particularly advantageously, the reactive dis¬tillation column is operated in such a way that the carboxylic acid and at least one part of the water re¬main in the base of the reactive distillation column. In this case, the reaction mixture from the pre-reactor is preferably introduced into the reactive distillation column at a point above the catalyst 2one centre. The base flow produced, which essentially contains alcohol, water and carboxylic acid, may be delivered to a fur¬ther separation stage, preferably a distillation col¬umn, in which the mixture is further separated. It is also conceivable for both the head flow and the base flow of the reactive distillation column to be deliv¬ered to further separation stages, e.g. distillation columns, and separated. As a variant, the head product may be delivered partially to the pre-reactor or to the feed flow of the reaction column, in order to further convert carboxylate contained in the head flow. Such recycling of the head flow of the reactive distillation<br><br>
column allows the capacity of the plant to be increased substantially.<br>
[0015] Advantageously, the reactive distillation column is operated in such a way that the added water and the volatile components are essentially contained in the head flow. This has the advantage that the carboxylic acid is produced in the base with a proportion by weight &gt; 95%, preferably &gt; 99%. The highest conversion ratio can in this case be achieved if the reaction mix¬ture from the pre-reactor is introduced into the reac¬tive distillation column at a point below the catalyst zone centre.<br>
[0016] The process according to the invention is advan¬tageously operated continuously, i.e. carboxylate and water or a mixture thereof, respectively, are continu¬ously fed into the pre-reactor, and the resulting reac¬tion mixture is drawn off continuously from the pre-reactor and fed into the reactive distillation column, where unreacted carboxylate is for the most part con¬verted into its hydrolysis products, the hydrolysis products being drawn off continuously as a head flow or as a bottom fraction (base flow), and optionally deliv¬ered to a further separation stage. The volume flow de¬livered per unit volume of catalyst is advantageously between 0-15 h-1, preferably 0.5-8 h"1 and particularly preferably between 1-4 h-1.<br>
[0017] The present invention also relates to a reaction and separation device according to the precharacteris-ing clause of claim 16, characterised by at least one pre-reactor having at least one inlet and one outlet for respectively supplying and discharging a fluid flow comprising  the carboxylate or the carboxylate mixture into the pre-reactor and therefrom, respectively, a first catalyst, which is arranged or deposited in the<br><br>
pre-reactor, a connecting line, which connects the out¬let of the pre-reactor to the inlet of the reactive distillation column, and first heating means for heat¬ing the fluid flow or the pre-reactor. The advantages of this device according to the invention have already-been mentioned in connection with the description of the process. Advantageous refinements of the device are described in the dependent claims.<br>
[0018] As a result of the fact that the pre-reactor is arranged approximately vertical, and the inlet, is lo¬cated at the top and the outlet at the bottom, the catalyst material in the pre-reactor experiences vor-texing, since the flow direction of the reaction flow and gravity keep the catalyst material at the bottom of the pre-reactor. It is thereby possible to prevent un-desired attrition of the catalyst material. It is also conceivable for the inlet and outlet to be provided laterally on opposite sides above or below the catalyst zone, respectively. It is in principle also conceivable for the inlet to be arranged at the bottom and the out¬let at the top.<br>
[0019]  In a particularly preferred embodiment, two pre-reactors or one pre-reactor having two reaction cham¬bers are used, and means are provided for making it possible to send the feed flow respectively through one of the pre-reactors or one of the reaction chambers, so that the other pre-reactor or the other reaction cham¬ber, respectively, can be provided with fresh catalyst. This has the advantage that the device can be operated continuously for a long period of time. It is also con¬ceivable to arrange the two pre-reactors one behind the other. Such an arrangement has the advantage that dif¬ferent temperatures can be maintained in the two reac¬tors, in order to positively exploit the dependency of<br><br>
the equilibrium reaction on temperature (e.g. 1st reac¬tor is operated at a higher temperature than 2nd reac¬tor) . According to an advantageous processor variant, the flow leaving the pre-reactor may be partially re¬turned to the pre-reactor. This has the advantage that the pre-reactor can be dimensioned smaller than if no recycling line is provided around the pre-reactor, and the capacity of the plant is. variable in a larger range. Yet another advantage is that phase separation in the feed to the pre-reactor can be avoided by a re¬cycled flow.<br>
[0020]  Expediently, the reactive distillation column has a catalyst zone and one lower and one upper recti¬fication zone, the upper rectification 2one being pro¬vided above the catalyst zone and the lower rectifica¬tion 2one being provided below the catalyst zone. The rectification zone may have separating stages, Raschig rings, structured material exchange packings etc. £0021]  The pre-reactor is advantageously designed as a tube, in which the first catalyst is deposited. Expedi¬ently, the first and second catalysts are acid solid-state catalysts, the first catalyst having a particle size of between approximately 0.3S and 3 mm and the second catalyst having one between approximately 0.5 and 1.5 mm, preferably 0.63 and l mm, and more particu¬larly preferably between 0.7 and 1 mm. While the first catalyst is preferably present as a bed in the pre-reactor in the form of spheres, rings, extrudates etc., the second catalyst is advantageously introduced into the reactive distillation column as so-called struc¬tured catalyst packing. Suitable structured catalyst packings are described, for example, in US 5,417,939 (Shelden), US 5,470,542 (Stringaro) and US 5,536,699 (Ghelfi), the content of which is hereby included by<br><br>
reference. The term structured catalyst packing should be understood to mean a structure having retaining de¬vices (e.g. bags) for solid catalyst material and hav¬ing flow channels, which are present in the structure. It is also conceivable to use such structured catalyst packings both in the pre-reactor and in the reactive distillation column.<br>

Figure 5 diagrammatically shows a fifth embodiment of a device for the catalytic hydrolysis of carboxylates, with two, pre-reactors, the feed from the pre-reactors being fed into the reactive distillation column at dif¬ferent points.<br>
[0023] The device 11 for the simultaneous catalytic hy¬drolysis of a carboxylate, especially methyl acetate, methyl formate or allyl acetate, into the hydrolysis products and ac least partial separation of the reac-<br><br>
tion mixture, comprises essentially a pre-reactor 13 and a reactive distillation column 15, which are con¬nected to one another by a connecting line 1?. [0024] The pre-reactor 13 has an inlet 19 for feeding a fluid flow into the reactor space and an outlet 21 for drawing off the reaction mixture. The connecting line 17 connects the outlet 21 of the reactor to an inlet 23 on the reactive distillation column 15. The pre-reactor 13 is preferably tubular, the inlet 19 and the inlet [sic] 21 being arranged on opposite end sides of the tube. The pre-reactor 13 has a catalyst bed 25 of a solid first catalyst material.<br>
[0025] The reactive distillation column 15 has a cata¬lyst zone 27 and an upper and lower rectification zone 29, 31, which are provided respectively below and above the catalyst zone 27. A second solid-state catalyst 33, preferably contained in so-called catalyst packing, is provided in the catalyst zone 27. The rectification zones are formed in a known way e.g. by Raschig rings, column stages, structured (material exchange) packings etc. A line 35 for drawing off the base flow is pro¬vided at the column foot, and a line 37 for drawing off the head flow of the reactive distillation column 15 is provided at the column head. The line 3 5 is in connec¬tion by means of a line 3 9 with a heat exchanger 41, which is connected via a line 43 in turn to the column foot. The heat exchanger 41 is used to heat the column base. By means of a branch line 44, part of the base can be removed as a base or base [sic] flow from the hydrolysis and separation device.<br>
[0026] The line 37 for the head flow leads to a con¬denser 45, by which the gaseous head flow can be lique¬fied. By means of a recycling line 47 connected to the condenser, part of the distillate can be returned as<br><br>
recycle to the reactive distillation column 15. Part or all of the distillate from the reactive distillation column 15 can be removed via the line 49. [0027] The carboxylate compound to be hydrolysed can be delivered into the pre-reactor 13 via a line 51, which is connected to the inlet 19. water can be added to the line 51 via a line 53. The carboxylate/water mixture can be heated by a heat exchanger 55, which is in con¬nection with the line 51.<br>
[0028] The second illustrative embodiment (Fig. 2) dif¬fers from the first in that a distillation column 57 is connected to the line 44, which is in connection with the column foot. For the sake of simplifying the de¬scription, the same reference numbers as in the de¬scription of the first illustrative embodiment are therefore used for identical parts, and the description is limited to the additional features of the second il¬lustrative embodiment.<br>
[0029] Like the reactive distillation column 15, the distillation column 57 also has a heat exchanger 61, integrated in a circulation line 59, in order to heat the base of the distillation column 57. Part of the distillation base can be removed from the hydrolysis device by a branch line 63.<br>
[0030] At the head of the distillation column 57, a condenser 65 is connected by means of a line 67 to the column. The condensate can be returned via the line 69 into the distillation column, or can be removed via the line 71 from the hydrolysis and separation device. [0031] The illustrative embodiment in Figure 3 differs from that in Figure 2 in that the distillation column 57 is connected to the line 49, which is in connection with the condenser 45 of the reactive distillation col¬umn. By means of the distillation column,  the head<br><br>
flow, which may be a compound mixture, can be separated at least partially into the components. A further dif¬ference is that a recycling or recirculation line 73 is provided around the pre-reactor 13, in order to make it possible for part of the flow leaving the pre-reactor 13 to be delivered newly thereto. Depending on the separation problem, an extraction column may also be used instead of the distillation column. f0032] The illustrative embodiment in Figure 4 has the distinguishing feature of two pre-reactors 13a and 13b, which can be used simultaneously or alternately. The reaction flow can in this case be fed through valves (not represented in further detail) either through the pre-reactor 13a or pre-reactor 13b. The use of two pre-reactors has the advantage of that, in the event that it is necessary to replace the catalyst material in one pre-reactor, operation need not be interrupted since the process flow can be fed through the other pre-reactor.<br>
[00333 The illustrative embodiment in Figure 5 differs from that in Figure 4 in that the pre-reactors 13a and 13b are connected by means of separate lines 17a and 17b to the reactive distillation column 15. The line 17a is connected to an inlet 23a, and the line 17b to an inlet 23b. The inlet 23a is arranged in the region of the reaction zone or below the latter, and the inlet 23b in the region of the reaction zone or above the latter. The composition of the feed can be adjusted in¬dividually for each pre-reactor. The reaction conver¬sion and the productivity can thereby be improved. In the case of using pure components, i.e. only water or only carboxylate,   the use of a second pre-reactor may also be omitted.<br><br>
[0034] The hydrolysis of a carboxylate will be de¬scribed below with reference to the hydrolysis of methyl acetate as an example of other carboxylates. Methyl acetate flow having a proportion by weight of ac least 50* methyl acetate is mixed with an amount of wa¬ter at least equimolar with respect to methyl acetate, preferably a 4 to 7 times molar excess of water. The mixture is then heated by the heat exchanger 55, pref¬erably to a temperature between 30 and 10Q*C, prefera¬bly 50 and 80oC, and fed into the preferably vertically arranged pre-reactor 13.<br>
{00353 The pre-reactor 13 is packed with an acid solid-state catalyst, e.g. a cationic ion exchanger. The catalyst preferably has a particle size between ap¬proximately 0.35 to 3 mm. Such a catalyst material is available, for example, under the name Amberlyst 15 from the company Rohm and Haas. Alternative catalysts are, for example, zeolites, aluminium oxide, silicon oxide etc.<br>
[0036] The methyl acetate/water mixture flows through the pre-reactor 13 in cocurrent from top to bottom, and comes into contact with the catalyst material during this. In this case, partial hydrolysis of the methyl acetate takes place. The conversion of the methyl ace¬tate in the pre-reactor is between 20 and 100%, pref¬erably between 50 and 80%, of the equilibrium conver¬sion. The resulting reaction mixture is introduced via the line 17 into the catalyst zone 27 of the reactive distillation column 15, although the introduction may also take place above or below the catalyst zone. As a variant, part of the reaction mixture may be recycled back to the pre-reactor 15 (Fig. 3).<br>
[0037] The reactive distillation column 15 is prefera¬bly operated in such a way that the more volatile<br><br>
methyl acetate rises in the catalyst zone, and the less volatile water flows down over the catalyst as reflux. In this case, intense contact between catalyst mate¬rial, water and methyl acetate takes place, in the course of which methyl acetate is cleaved into acetic acid and methanol.<br>
[003 8] Depending on the desired purity and/or composi¬tion of the acetic acid, the reactive distillation col¬umn may be operated in such a way that unreacted water collects together with the acetic acid in the base of the column (case 1) or is essentially contained in the head flow of the reactive distillation column (case 2). In the first case, an acetic acid/water/methanol mix¬ture is produced, which can be further separated e.g. by a downstream separation stage (Fig. 2) . In the sec¬ond case, aqueous or essentially anhydrous acetic acid with a purity &gt; 99% can be obtained.<br>
C0039] The temperature of the pre-reactor, or of the reactive distillation column, respectively, may be es¬tablished as a function of pressure, a certain over¬pressure making it possible to operate at a higher tem¬perature.<br>
[00403 In the process utilising the device in Figure 2, the head flow of the reactive distillation column con¬tains methyl acetate, methanol, water and low-boiling components. The base, which contains methanol, water, acetic acid and traces of methyl acetate, is removed as a so-called base flow. The volume ratio between the head flow 37 and the base flow 35 varies between 1:1 and 1:1000, preferably 1:30 to 1:200, The reflux ratio of the reactive distillation column is between 1 and 300, and preferably between 80 and 200. The base flow 35 of the reactive distillation column can be further separated in the distillation column 57. The head flow<br><br>
of the distillation column 57, exiting through the line 67, contains methanol and traces of methyl acetate, and the base flow (line 59) consists essentially of aqueous acetic acid.<br>
[0041]  In the process utilising the device in Figure 3, the head flow of the reactive distillation column 15 contains methyl  acetate,  methanol,  water and low-boiling components. The base flow contains either pure acetic acid, i.e. acetic acid at more than 99% propor¬tion by weight, or aqueous acetic acid. The volume ra¬tio between the base flow 35 and the head flow 37 pref¬erably varies between 1:1 and 1:10, and more particu¬larly preferably between 1:1 to 1:4. The reflux ratio of the reactive distillation column is between 1 and 100, and preferably between 5 and 50. The head flow of the reactive distillation column can be further sepa¬rated in the distillation column 57. The head flow of the distillation column 57, exiting through the line 67, contains methanol, methyl acetate, water and low-boiling components. The base flow (line 59) contains essentially water. [0042]    Examples:<br>
In the following experimental examples, a cationic solid-state catalyst from the company Rohm and Haas, Germany was used (Amberlyst CSP  2), In the reaction distillation column, the catalyst was introduced into structured catalyst cracking. [0043]  1st Experiment (Prior Art)<br>
A single reactive distillation column was used. The base flow contained a mixture of methyl acetate, methanol, acetic acid and water, which was separated in an additional purification column into a methyl ace-tate/methanol mixture and an acetic acid/water mixture.<br><br>

acetic acid: 99.9% [0046] The process according to the invention is suit¬able, in particular, for the hydrolysis of low molecu¬lar weight esters (esters with Cl to C4 or higher alco¬hols) , e.g. methyl acetate, methyl formate and allyl acetate.<br>
[0047] Allyl alcohol can inter alia be produced by the hydrolysis of allyl acetate. The hydrolysis is in this case carried out according to known conventional meth¬ods in the presence of mineral acids or ion exchangers as catalyst.<br>
[0048] The production of formic acid likewise takes place by a hydrolysis reaction. In this case, methyl formate is reacted with excess water to give formic acid and methanol. The reaction can in this case be carried out autocatalysed by formic acid (DE-A-44 449 79) or in the presence of acid catalyst, e.g. ion ex¬changer (DE-A-42 373 3 9) , The processing of the hy¬drolysis products conventionally takes place with sepa¬ration methods such as distillation, extraction, etc.<br><br>

Process for hydrolytically obtaining a carboxylic acid and alcohol from the corresponding carboxylate and water, in which process a flow containing carboxylate is brought into contact with a hydrolysis catalyst in the presence of water at elevated temperature in a reactive distillation column (15), by means of which the carboxylate is at least partially hydrolysed into the carboxylic acid and alcohol, and the resulting reaction mixture is simultaneously separated into the components in the reactive distillation column, the more volatile compounds, e.g. alcohol, being drawn off from the head of the reactive distillation column (15) as a so-called head flow and the less volatile compounds, e.g. carboxylic acid, collecting in the base of the column (15) as a bottom fraction, which is drawn off as a so-called bottom or base flow, characterised in that<br>
the flow containing the carboxylate is firstly fed to a pre-reactor (13), in which the carboxylate is brought into contact with a first catalyst in the presence of water, by means of which the carboxylate is partially cleaved into the hydrolysis products;<br>
the reaction mixture is drawn off from the prereactor (13) and fed into the reactive distillation column (15) and is brought into contact with a second hydrolysis catalyst for conversion, of the remaining carboxylate into carboxylic acid and alcohol.<br>
2         Process as claimed in claim 1, wherein at least the head flow of<br><br>
           the reactive distillation column (15) or the base flow is delivered<br>
           to at least one  separation stage, and is separated into  the<br>
          components.</td>
