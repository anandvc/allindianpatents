OPTICALLY ACTIVE HALOHYDRIN DERIVATIVE AND PROCESS FOR PRODUCING<br>
OPTICALLY ACTIVE EPOXY ALCOHOL DERIVATIVE FROM THE DAME<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a novel process for<br>
producing an optically active epoxy alcohol derivative that is<br>
an important intermediate compound for use inmany fields including<br>
pharmaceuticals. In addition, the present invention relates to<br>
a novel optically active halohydrin derivative that is an important<br>
intermediate material for synthesizing the epoxy alcohol<br>
derivative. Furthermore, the present invention relates to a<br>
process for producing an intermediate for a triazole antifungal<br>
agent by allowing an optically active halohydrin to react with<br>
a triazole sulfonamide.<br>
Background Art<br>
It has been known that<br>
2-aryl-3-methyl-2-[(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)methyl]oxirane<br>
compounds and<br>
2-aryl-3-methyl-1-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)-2,4-butanediol<br>
compounds, in particular, the compounds in each of which the aryl<br>
group at the 2-position is 2,4-difluorophenyl group or<br>
2,5-difluorophenyl group are important intermediates for<br>
triazole antifungal agents (Japanese Unexamined Patent<br>
Application Publication Nos. 2-191262, 3-128338, 10-306079, and<br>
8-165263 and US 6,300,353).<br>
Examples of processes for producing a<br>
2-aryl-3-methyl-2-[(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)methyl]oxirane<br>
compound include:<br>
(1) a production process including 3 steps using<br>
stereoselective osmium oxidation of an optically active allyl<br>
chloride derivative as a key reaction, the allyl chloride<br>
derivative being prepared through 4 steps from L-lactic acid and<br>
1,3-difluorobenzene (Japanese Unexamined Patent Application<br>
Publication No. 2-191262);<br>
(2) a production process including a stereoselective<br>
addition reaction of a Grignard reagent to an optically active<br>
a-keto alcohol derivative and further 3 to 9 steps, the a-keto<br>
alcohol derivative being prepared through 6 steps from L-lactic<br>
acid and 1,3-difluorobenzene (Japanese Unexamined Patent<br>
Application Publication Nos. 2-191262 and 10-212287);<br>
(3) a production process including stereoselective<br>
epoxidation of an optically active a-keto alcohol derivative and<br>
further 3 steps, the a-keto alcohol derivative being prepared<br>
through 3 steps from D-lactic acid (Japanese Unexamined Patent<br>
Application Publication No. 10-306079 and US 6,300,353); and<br>
(4) a production process including asymmetric oxidation<br>
of an allyl alcohol derivative as a key reaction and further 2<br>
steps, the allyl alcohol derivative being prepared through 7 steps<br>
from chloroacetic chloride and 1,3-difluorobenzene, the<br>
asymmetric oxidat ion being developed by Sharplessetal. (Synlett,<br>
1110-1112, 1995).<br>
A 2-aryl-3-methyl-1-(1H-l,2,4-triazol-1-yl)-2,4-butanediol<br>
compound is prepared, by stereoselective dihydroxylation of a<br>
3-aryl-4-butene-4-alkoxy-1-butene compound as a key reaction and<br>
further 3 steps, the 3-aryl-4-butene-4-alkoxy-1-butene compound<br>
being prepared through 5 steps from an optically active<br>
3-hydroxy-2-methylpropionate compound (Japanese Unexamined<br>
Patent Application Publication No. 8-165263) .<br>
A1,2-epoxy-2-arylbutan-3-ol, which is an optically active<br>
1,2-epoxy alcohol, used as an important material for the<br>
above-described<br>
2-aryl-3-methyl-2-[(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)methyl]oxirane<br>
intermediate is produced by a known process of stereoselectively<br>
oxidizing an allyl alcohol derivative using tert-butyl<br>
hydroperoxide in the presence of a metal catalyst, the allyl<br>
alcohol derivative being prepared through at least 4 steps from<br>
L-lactic acid and an aromatic compound (Japanese Unexamined Patent<br>
Application Publication No. 2-191262) .<br>
However, a process for producing a<br>
(2R,3S)-2-aryl-3-methyl-1-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)-2,4-butane<br>
diol has problems with safety and cost because an osmium oxide<br>
and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide that are known expensive and highly<br>
toxic must be used. Furthermore, the process requires 9 steps<br>
starting from an easily available material. That is, there has<br>
been no simple process.<br>
The process for producing the optically active 1,2-epoxy<br>
alcohol must use a peracid as an oxidant, thus disadvantageously<br>
resulting in difficulty in mass production in view of industrial<br>
safety. Furthermore, the oxidation is a diastereoselective<br>
reaction induced by hydroxy group attached to an asymmetric carbon<br>
originated from L-lactic acid. Although there are 2 types of<br>
diastereomers (threo-diastereomer and erythro-diastereomer) , a<br>
compound that can be produced by the process is only the<br>
erythro-diastereomer. Therefore, to obtain the<br>
threo-diastereomer required for producing an intermediate for<br>
a triazole antifungal agent, further 2 steps are required to<br>
convert the erythro-diastereomer into the threo-diastereomer of<br>
the optically active epoxy alcohol.<br>
The above-described known processes for producing the<br>
2-aryl-3-methyl-2-[(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)methyl]oxirane<br>
compound serving as an intermediate for a triazole antifungal<br>
agent have many industrial practical problems as described below:<br>
in process (1) , an osmium oxide, which is expensive and highly<br>
toxic, must be used; in process (2) , an osmium oxide must be used<br>
as in process (1) , and 10 to 15 steps are required starting from<br>
a commercially available material; in process (3), a<br>
diastereomeric oxirane compound is prepared by the<br>
stereoselective epoxidation of an optically active a-keto alcohol<br>
derivative, but column chromatography is used for purifying the<br>
resulting diastereomer; and in process (4), the Sharpless<br>
asymmetric oxidation must use tert-butyl hydroperoxide, which<br>
is a peracid, as an oxygen source.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
With respect to a process for producing an optically active<br>
epoxy alcohol derivative, which is an important intermediate in<br>
the pharmaceutical field or the like, in view of the<br>
above-described problems of the known processes, the present<br>
inventors have conducted intensive studies on a process that can<br>
be safely operated even in mass production using only a material<br>
and an agent that are easy to handle industrially and available<br>
inexpensively. Asaresult, the present inventors have developed<br>
a novel process of subjecting an optically active haloketone<br>
derivative that can be efficiently prepared through 2 steps from<br>
an optically active lactate to highly stereoselective addition<br>
reaction with an aryl-metal compound to prepare a structurally<br>
novel optically active halohydrin derivative, and subsequently<br>
performing 1 or 2 steps to produce an optically active epoxy alcohol<br>
derivative. The stereoselectivity in the addition reaction of<br>
the aryl-metal compound to the haloketone derivative can be<br>
controlled by changing a substituent at the a-position of the<br>
haloketone derivative. That is, the production process can<br>
produce any desired diastereomer of the optically active<br>
halohydrin derivative and is thus widely applicable. Furthermore,<br>
by using a haloketone derivative having one more carbon atom than<br>
the number of carbon atoms in the above-described haloketone<br>
derivative, the production process is more widely applicable.<br>
The epoxy alcohol is allowed to react with triazole to<br>
produce a<br>
2-aryl-3-methyl-2-[(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)methyl]oxirane<br>
serving as an intermediate for a triazole antifungal agent.<br>
Similarly, an epoxy alcohol obtained from the haloketone<br>
derivative having one more carbon atom is also allowed to react<br>
with triazole to produce<br>
2-aryl-3-methyl-1-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)-2,4-butanediol<br>
serving as a useful intermediate for a triazole antifungal agent.<br>
Furthermore, a process for producing a<br>
2-aryl-3-methyl-2-[(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)methyl]oxirane<br>
serving as an intermediate for a triazole antifungal agent in<br>
one step of allowing an optically active halohydrin that can be<br>
prepared in the present invention to react with triazole<br>
sulfonamide was also developed.<br>
The present invention can be widely applied to produce<br>
various known intermediates for triazole antifungal agents and<br>
is thus useful.<br>

will be described. The step includes allowing a propionate compound<br>
represented by general formula (2) :<br>
to react with an enolate which is prepared by reaction of a<br>
haloacetic acid derivative represented by general formula (3)<br>
with a base, and then subjecting the resulting compound to acid<br>
treatment.<br>
A commercially available L-lactate or D-Lactate may be<br>
directly used, as the propionate derivative (2) used in this step.<br>
Alternatively, according to need, an L-lactate or D-lactate in<br>
which the hydroxy group is replaced with a substituent by a general<br>
method known as a typical technique (for example, a method<br>
described in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, third<br>
edition) may also be used.<br>
In the formula, R2 represents an alkyl group, an aryl group,<br>

number of carbon atoms described in this specification does not<br>
include the number of carbon atoms in a substituent.<br>
Examples of the alkyl group include substituted or<br>
unsubstituted alkyl groups having 1 to 18 carbon atoms, for example,<br>
methyl group, ethyl group, n-propyl group, isopropyl group,<br>
n-butyl group, isobutyl group, sec-butyl group, tert-butyl group,<br>
n-pentyl group, isopentyl group, and n-hexyl group. Examples<br>
of the aryl group include substituted or unsubstituted aryl groups<br>
having 6 to 2 0 carbon atoms, for example, phenyl group, 1-naphthyl<br>
group, 2-naphthyl group, 4-methylphenyl group, 3--methylphenyl<br>

group, 4-methoxyphenyl group, 3-methoxyphenyl group,<br>
2 -methoxyphenyl group, 4 -nitrophenyl group, 4 -phenylphenyl group,<br>
4-chlorophenyl group, and 4-bromophenyl group. Examples of the<br>

having 7 to 2 0 carbon atoms, for example, benzyl group,<br>
4 -methylbenzyl group, 3 -methylbenzyl group, 2 -methylbenzyl group,<br>

group, 1-phenylethyl group, 2-phenylethyl group,<br>
1-(4-methylphenyl) ethyl group, 1-(4-methoxyphenyl) ethyl group,<br>
3-phenylpropyl group, and. 2-phenylpropyl group. Among these,<br>
an alkyl group is preferable, and methyl group or ethyl group<br>
is more preferable.<br>
