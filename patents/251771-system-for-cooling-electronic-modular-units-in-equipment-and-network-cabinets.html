				<td>Field of Invention<br>
The invention relates to a system for cooling electronic modular units in<br>
equipment and network cabinets, particularly server cabinets, in an<br>
installation area which has a simple design and stable construction and<br>
ensures the necessary accessibility to the reception area and an extremely<br>
efficient removal of the heat loss of the electronic modular units.<br>
Background of the Invention and Prior Art<br>
DE 195 15 121 C2 discloses a housing structure for electrical and/or electronic<br>
equipment installable outdoors. The outdoor housing structure comprises an<br>
inner cabinet and an outer cabinet spaced there from. A cooling air fan placed<br>
in the bottom of the outer cabinet sucks a cooling air flow out of the<br>
environment and into the outer cabinet, which is provided with upper outlets.<br>
An air heat exchanger in the inner cabinet to which is supplied the cooling air<br>
from the outer cabinet and circulating fans ensure a recycled inside air flow. In<br>
addition, the electrical and electronic equipment are placed on cooling<br>
elements, which are held in the wall openings of the inner cabinet and are<br>
connected to the interior of the inner cabinet.<br>
DE 102 10418A1 discloses a switch cabinet with a cooling device constructed<br>
as a rear wall and which has an air-to-water heat exchanger and blower. The<br>
partial hot air flows from the interior of the switch cabinet are subject to<br>
suction action and returned as cooled air via a ventilating duct placed beneath<br>
the interior and an air retaining chamber on the front to the interior of the<br>
cabinet.<br>
A modular switch cabinet system according to DE 198 25 602 C2 is provided<br>
with a set of doors, which in each case have at least one fan, are replaceable<br>
and constructed for the reception of a cooling module, e.g. a compressor cooler,<br>
an air-to air heat exchanger or an air-to-water heat exchanger in accordance<br>
with the given requirements.<br>
DE 20 2004 006 552.5 U1 discloses an equipment and network cabinet,<br>
particularly a server cabinet, with electronic modular units, particularly servers<br>
located in the interior and an air-to-water heat exchanger placed in the lower<br>
cabinet area and which is connected to the cold water supply of the building.<br><br><br>
As a result of an air circulation with air paths of equal length and<br>
therefore identical flow resistances for the individual modular units and due<br>
to an aer-technical separation between the cold supply air and the heated<br>
exhaust air, it is possible to supply to the individual modular units cold<br>
supply air with an almost uniform supply air temperature. The removal of the<br>
heat loss of the electronic modular units received in a housing with a fan,<br>
takes place by means of a closed cooling air circuit, which has a supply air<br>
duct, particularly at the front and extending over the arrangement of the<br>
electronic modular units for the supply air cooled in the bottom air-to-water<br>
heat exchanger, as well as an exhaust air duct, which has behind the<br>
electronic modular units a first duct section for a rising exhaust air flow<br>
and a second duct section for a falling exhaust air flow and which is located<br>
in the rear door of the cabinet. The deflection of the exhaust air flow<br>
takes place with the aid of fans in the upper area of the rear door and<br>
advantageously the latter has a right-hand and a left-hand falling exhaust<br>
air duct through which exhaust air is supplied to the air-to-water heat<br>
exchanger.<br>
US 6 819 563 Bl discloses an equipment cabinet installable in a room for<br>
electronic equipment or components provided with a blower. Air conditioned<br>
ambient air is supplied for cooling the electronic components in this indoor<br>
equipment cabinet. The ambient air is cooled by means of an entrance heat<br>
exchanger located in the equipment cabinet and which is supplied with cooling<br>
water, then passes into the superimposed, stacked electronic equipment and is<br>
then returned as heated exhaust air to the installation room. In addition,<br>
an exit heat exchanger can be located in the equipment cabinet and cools the<br>
heated exhaust air before the latter is delivered to the ambient air.<br>
In the equipment cabinet of US 2004/0100770 Al the heat loss of superimposed<br>
electronic components is removed with the aid of blowers and a combined air-<br>
liquid cooling. On at least one cabinet side are installed an air-to-liquid<br>
heat exchanger and the blowers are located in a separate housing and<br>
connected to the reception area. Alternatively the air-to-liquid heat<br>
exchanger units can be arranged in the form of a front and rear door. A<br>
closed cooling air circuit is made possible by the formation of a supply or<br>
removal area in the doors, as well as a connecting area below and/or above<br>
the stack arrangement and additional fans can be located in the supply and<br>
removal areas. The heat exchanger doors are articulated to the cabinet body<br>
for accessing the reception area and electronic components and equipment.<br>
DE 102 10 417 B4 describes an arrangement for cooling a switch cabinet in<br>
which the heat loss of superimposed, heat-generating components is removed<br>
with the aid of a heat exchanger rear wall or a rear wall heat exchanger<br>
cabinet and a cooling air flow of a central cooling installation. The<br>
cooling air flow of the central cooling installation passes from a double<br><br>
bottom below the switch cabinet into a more particularly frontally<br>
constructed supply air shaft and the heated exhaust air is cooled with the<br>
aid of downstream fans in the heat exchanger rear wall or rear wall heat<br>
exchanger cabinet using more particularly an air-to-water heat exchanger and<br>
is either returned to the double bottom below the switch cabinet or to the<br>
switch cabinet ambient air. The central cooling installation supplies both<br>
the switch cabinet ambient air and the double bottom and consequently the<br>
interior of the switch cabinet with cooling air, so that a relatively<br>
complicated control arrangement is necessary to achieve the in each case<br>
necessary cooling capacity.<br>
WO 01/72099 A2 and US 2001/0042616 Al disclose a cooling system for equipment<br>
and network cabinets serving to flexibly and effectively remove the heat loss<br>
of high power, densely packed, electronic modular units in a plurality of<br>
strung together cabinets in an installation area ore room. The cooling<br>
system is intended to supplement the room air conditioning and make it less<br>
expensive, in that the exhaust air heated in a cabinet is supplied by fans to<br>
an air-to-fluid heat exchanger, cooled to ambient temperature and delivered<br>
to the ambient air. The fans and heat exchanger are housed in an additional<br>
housing fixed to the rear of the cabinet. The exhaust air from the cabinet<br>
passes via an opening in the cabinet rear wall or door and a complementary<br>
opening in the engaging heat exchanger fan housing into the interior of said<br>
housing and is guided by means of the air-to-fluid heat exchanger in the<br>
vicinity of the housing opening by means of downstream fans and via the<br>
housing outer wall is delivered to the environment.<br>
According to a data sheet of the applicant of WO 01/7209912 and US<br>
2001/0042616 Al, Messrs. Liebert, Columbus, Ohio 43229, USA: RackCooler,<br>
System Configuration Guide, drawing number 171439, rev. 07, 6/12/2002, pp 1<br>
to 8 and the associated installation manual SL-16810 (9/01), pp 1 to 10, the<br>
so-called RackCooler, i.e. the housing unit with an air-to-water heat<br>
exchanger and superimposed fans is fixed externally to the rear door of<br>
cabinets, and cooling water delivering the absorbed heat loss outside the<br>
cabinet installation area, is supplied to each RackCooler by means of a<br>
ground-installed pipe system and connecting hoses between said pipe system<br>
and each RackCooler. Disadvantages of said retrofitting of existing doors<br>
are system downtimes during retrofitting, possible overloading of existing<br>
closure and hinge elements, low efficiency relative to the space requirement<br>
due to the restriction of the areas available for cooling purposes due to<br>
taking account of existing closure and hinge means and a relatively small<br>
opening angle of the retrofitted door.<br>
The connecting hoses extending from the bottom-side connection points to the<br>
connections on each RackCooler must, due to the placing of the RackCooler on<br>
the rear doors, have a relatively flexible construction and must be able to<br><br>
follow the swinging movement of the doors. Therefore the disadvantages arises<br>
of the connecting hoses only having an inadequate mechanical stability and<br>
robustness, whilst also lacking the necessary gas tightness, so that due to gas<br>
diffusion corrosion of the heat exchanger pipes can take place.<br>
Objects of the Invention<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a system for cooling electronic modular<br>
units in equipment and network cabinets, particularly cabinet rows in an<br>
installation area or room, which has a simple design and stable construction<br>
and ensures the necessary accessibility to the reception area and an extremely<br>
efficient removal of the heat loss of the electronic modular units.<br>
According to the invention the object is achieved by the features disclosed in<br>
the description and appropriate and advantageous developments appear in the<br>
description relative to the drawings.<br>
A fundamental idea of the invention is to construct a rear cooling arrangement<br>
with an air-to fluid heat exchanger and fans in such a way that there is no<br>
need for a pivoting movement of the heat exchanger or heat exchanger unit and<br>
therefore the need for flexible connecting hoses and simultaneously access to<br>
the rear of the cabinet is ensured. The term air-to-fluid heat exchanger is<br>
understood to mean an air-to-liquid heat exchanger.<br>
According to the invention a system with an air-to-fluid heat exchanger,<br>
particularly an air-to-water heat exchanger, which is connected to the cold<br>
water supply of the building and removes the heat loss to outside the cabinet<br>
installation area is design-separated from a fan arrangement, which supplies<br>
the air-to-fluid heat exchanger the exhaust air of the electronic modular units<br>
of a cabinet. According to the invention the fans are integrated into a door,<br>
preferably a rear door of a cabinet. Such a fan door preferably extends over the<br>
entire cabinet height and at least over the height of the reception area for the<br>
electronic modular units, e.g. servers and allows access to the servers, also<br>
from the rear. Such a rear access is particularly advantageous when blade<br>
servers are used and which are generally received in a stack arrangement so as<br>
to be extractable rearwards instead of forwards.<br>
According to the invention, design-separated from the fan door, the air-to-fluid<br>
heat exchanger is placed in fixed manner on the rear of the cabinet whilst<br>
covering a residual area of the cabinet rear, i.e. at least the area not covered by<br>
the fan door.<br>
The advantage of a rigid, appropriately dismantlable arrangement of the air-to<br>
fluid heat exchanger longitudinally and preferably vertically alongside<br><br>
the fan door and adjacently connected thereto preferably by means of hinges<br>
is that there can be rigid pipes for connecting the pipe system for the<br>
cooling fluid laid under the floor with each air-to-fluid heat exchanger of a<br>
cabinet. There is no longer a need for flexible connecting hoses, because<br>
the air-to-fluid heat exchanger is fixed in stationary and not pivotable<br>
manner to the cabinet rear. The rigid pipes can be made from a gas<br>
diffusion-tight material, which are in principle known from heating<br>
engineering. Through excluding gas diffusion in the vicinity of the<br>
connecting pipes, there is no or only a greatly reduced corrosion risk in the<br>
vicinity of the heat exchanger leading to a longer service life.<br>
It is advantageous that the fan door and longitudinally adjacent air-to-fluid<br>
heat exchangers are constructed as a retrofittable unit and can replace a<br>
conventional cabinet rear wall or door if there is a need for a much more<br>
efficient heat loss removal.<br>
The possible retrofitting also gives the advantageous possibility of<br>
providing with relatively low capital and operating costs a high-power<br>
cooling, particularly in commercial computer centres with up to 100 cabinets,<br>
of individual cabinets in planned manner with the inventive fan door and the<br>
adjacent, fixed air-to-fluid heat exchanger. This makes it possible to<br>
optimize the equipping of the cabinets and also the filling of the room or<br>
area with such cabinets, whilst simultaneously reducing costs for the air<br>
conditioning thereof.<br>
Appropriately in the fan door fans, preferably centrifugal fans, are arranged<br>
in uniformly spaced and in particular superimposed manner and are directly or<br>
indirectly fixed to an inside and outside of the housing-like fan door. For<br>
removing the exhaust air from the reception area of the cabinet,<br>
complementary openings are provided on the inside of the fan door and, after<br>
deflecting by approximately 90°, the air passes through an at least zonally<br>
air-permeable connection side of the fan door into the adjacent air-to-fluid<br>
heat exchanger. An entrance side of the heat exchanger housing can<br>
advantageously be made air-permeable or perforated in the same way as the<br>
connection side of the fan door, and a parallel, air-permeably constructed<br>
exit side of the heat exchanger housing permits the discharge of the cooled<br>
air into the cabinet environment.<br>
The supply of cooling air from the environment of the cabinets in the<br>
reception area or room generally takes place in the vicinity of the front<br>
cabinet door and the electronic modular units particularly in a stack<br>
arrangement can in each case have a fan in their housings.<br>
The fan door is appropriately articulated by means of hinges to the heat<br>
exchanger and can be pivoted from a closed into an open position. A 180°<br><br>
open position is particularly advantageous, because it allows an advantageous<br>
access to the electronic modular units and to the cabling area on the back of<br>
the cabinet. Appropriately there are corresponding seals in the vicinity of the<br>
cabinet rear and/or the adjacent fan door and between the fan door and the<br>
heat exchanger housing, so that in the operating position, i.e. with the fan door<br>
closed, there is an efficient removal of the heated exhaust air, whilst cooling<br>
and delivering the same to the ambient air.<br>
It is advantageous that the fan door and/or the air-to-fluid heat exchanger can<br>
be constructed for cabinets and rear access of different widths. For cabinets<br>
with a width of approximately 750 mm and a heat exchanger unit with a width<br>
of approximately 210 mm, an access area approximately 665 mm wide can be<br>
obtained through a laterally projecting heat exchanger arrangement. If the<br>
outside of the fan door is bevelled adjacent to the closing side of the fan door<br>
an advantageous pivoting movement of the rear fan door of the adjacent<br>
cabinet is made possible.<br>
It is also advantageous with a cabinet e.g. having -a width of 600 mm and<br>
preferably intended for blade servers, that the same heat exchanger unit can be<br>
fixed to the rear of the cabinet, more particularly aligned with a side wall. The<br>
fan door then has a smaller width, e.g. approximately 350 to 400 mm, but this<br>
is adequate for operating the blade server from the rear. The fan door can be<br>
articulated to the outer wall of the heat exchanger by means of hinges and can<br>
be pivoted into an open position by 180° using a vertical pivot pin. The<br>
superimposed fans are fixed to the inside of the door in the vicinity of e.g.<br>
nozzle-shaped insertion openings and preferably extend to the outer wall of the<br>
fan door, it being possible to provide a spacing retention. The fan door closing<br>
device is appropriately adapted to the door construction and is located on the<br>
closing side of the fan door facing the heat exchanger side.<br>
It falls within the scope of the invention to provide further construction<br>
variants for the inventive system of a rigidly fixed air-to-fluid heat exchanger<br>
and a fan arrangement constructed as a fan door. For example the fan door<br>
can be articulated to the cabinet rear wall on its side opposite to the heat<br>
exchanger. The closing side of the door would then be on the heat exchanger<br>
side. The advantages of such a construction are that the fan door does not<br>
have to be carried by the heat exchanger unit and the loads are symmetrically<br>
distributed over the cabinet to be retrofitted. It can also be expected that it is<br>
easier to control sealing at the joining point between the fan door and heat<br>
exchanger module, in that with the prestressing of the seal decreasing the<br>
sealing action is not dependent on the rotation angle and also the contact<br>
pressure can be influenced by the closing device. It is also advantageous that<br>
with such a construction the free flow cross-section between fan door and heat<br>
exchanger unit can be made larger, which leads to lower pressure losses.<br><br>
In a variant the hinge jointing of the fan door can be located on an additional<br>
structure, so that the pivot pin is spaced from the cabinet rear. By placing the<br>
fulcrum of the fan door at a distance from the cabinet rear, there are more<br>
degrees of freedom regarding the opening angle of the fan door.<br>
According to a further development of the invention the heat exchanger is<br>
positioned rigidly, but its housing is at least partly pivotable. This avoids the<br>
disadvantages of a pivotable arrangement of the heat exchanger.<br>
Simultaneously the heat exchanger module can be provided with a heat<br>
exchanger door, which is articulated to a vertical pivot pin and allows access to<br>
the heat exchanger. The separating plane between fan door and heat exchanger<br>
door is determined by the system and space requirement of the fans and the<br>
heat exchanger. Through both doors being pivotable about lateral, facing<br>
rotation axes, there can be an advantageous sealing action in the vicinity of the<br>
adjacent separating or sealing plane. An advantageous greater access to the<br>
cabinet from the rear is possible if both doors are opened.<br>
A rigid system of at least one heat exchanger and a pivotable fan door can, in a<br>
further variant, also be achieved in that the cabinet rear has two door halves<br>
and fans and a heat exchanger are located in each half. According to the<br>
invention, each heat exchanger is positioned rigidly and each door or half-door<br>
with the fans, e.g. two fans, is pivotably articulated about an axis, e.g. in the<br>
vicinity of the heat exchanger. This design variant also gives good access to the<br>
cabinet. A redundancy exists, because the separating plane between the door<br>
halves is free, so that the fans can act on both heat exchangers. There is a<br>
uniform heat removal on the back of the electronic modular units when the<br>
doors are open.<br>
According to a development the at least one heat exchanger and the fans can<br>
be located in a door leaf, which essentially covers the entire cabinet back. The<br>
heat exchanger is fixed rigidly and the fan door is pivotably arranged about a<br>
longitudinal axis. Essential additional advantages of this system are good<br>
access from the cabinet rear and a cooling capacity even when the doors are<br>
open.<br>
The cooling system according to the invention is preferably provided for an air<br>
circulation in which the exhaust air from the cabinet reception area passes into<br>
the fan door and then into the fixed installed heat exchanger. It falls within the<br>
scope of the invention to pass the exhaust air flow from the cabinet firstly<br>
through the heat exchanger and then via the fan door to the environment.<br><br>
An advantageous esthetic overall impression arises if the heat exchanger<br>
housing and the fan door, at least in the vicinity of the fan arrangement, have<br>
virtually the same depth.<br>
The essential advantages of the cooling system according to the invention are<br>
the retrofittability and the use of gas-tight, rigid connecting pipes for the<br>
cooling medium made possible by the rigid fixing of the heat exchanger unit.<br>
As a result of the rigid arrangement of the heat exchanger there is also an<br>
advantageous possibility of making rigid the interface with different cabinet<br>
constructions, e.g. using screw connections, and the hinges and pivot bearings<br>
necessary for the pivoting movement of the movable part, particularly the fan<br>
door, can be made uniform for all cabinet types and sizes. This significantly<br>
simplifies the retrofitting of existing equipment of network cabinets.<br>
The invention is described in greater detail hereinafter relative to the attached<br>
drawings.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Figs 1 to 5 show a cabinet 2, particularly a server cabinet, with the cooling<br>
arrangement according to the invention on the rear thereof. For cooling the<br>
electronic modular units, particularly the not shown servers in a stacked<br>
arrangement located in a reception area 3, in the vicinity of the rear of the<br>
cabinet are provided a fan door 6 and an air-to-fluid heat exchanger 7, which<br>
in longitudinally adjacent manner extending over the entire cabinet height<br>
replace a conventional rear wall or door.<br>
In this embodiment the fan door 6 has four superimposed fans 5 (cf. fig.2),<br>
which extend from an inside 16 to an outside 18 of fan door 6 and suck<br>
exhaust air 10 from the reception area 3 of cabinet 2 via openings 17 in the<br>
inside 16 and subject it to a roughly 90° deflection (cf. also fig.4). Consequently<br>
the exhaust air 10 passes into an exhaust air area or room 15 of the fan door 6<br>
formed by the inside 16 and outside 18, together with a closing side 19 and<br>
connecting side 20. On the closing side 19 is provided a closing device 29 with<br>
which the fan door 6 can be closed in the operating position shown in fig.4. The<br>
reception area 15 of the fan door 6 is connected by means of a sealed and at<br>
least zonally air-permeable or perforated connecting side 20 to the air-to-fluid<br>
heat exchanger 7, whereby an entrance side 21 of a heat exchanger housing 11<br>
constructed in air-permeable or perforated manner is directly adjacent to the<br>
connecting side 20 of the fan door (cf. fig.4). The exhaust air 10 entering the<br>
heat exchanger 7 is cooled and by means of an exit side 22 parallel to entrance<br>
side 21 is delivered as cooled exhaust air 30 to the ambient air of the<br>
installation room of cabinets 2, preferably at ambient temperature.<br>
Due to the fact that the fans 5 are uniformly spaced and extend over the entire<br>
height of the cabinet or reception area 3 (cf. fig. 2) an efficient exhaust air<br>
cooling adaptable to the requirements is ensured. The air-to-fluid heat<br>
exchanger 7 which, in this embodiment, is a finned heat exchanger and has a<br>
pipe-fin package 12 of vertically oriented pipes 13, e.g. copper pipes and<br>
cooling fins, through the connection to the building cooling water supply<br>
makes it possible to remove the heat loss to the outside of the cabinet reception<br>
area or room.<br>
As the heat exchanger 7 with its heat exchanger housing 11 is arranged in<br>
fixed, but dismantlable manner in the vicinity of the rear of cabinet 2 and is<br>
not involved in the pivoting environment of fan door 6, rigid connecting pipes<br>
can be used between heat exchanger 7 and b'uilding-side cold water supply<br>
pipe system (not shown). Such rigid connecting pipes are constructed in gas-<br>
tight manner and prevent corrosion of pipes 13, which is generally unavoidable<br><br>
with the flexible connecting hoses required for pivotably located heat<br>
exchangers.<br>
The articulation of the fan door 6 to the fixed air-to-fluid heat exchanger 7<br>
takes place by means of hinges 14 located in the vicinity of the outside 18 of<br>
fan door 6 and the outer wall 23 of heat exchanger housing 11 and ensure a<br>
pivoting about a vertical pivot pin 25.<br>
The cabinet of figs. 1 to 5 has a width of approximately 750 mm and the fan<br>
door 6 is provided with a bevel 27 between closing device 29 and fans 5. This<br>
bevel is advantageous for a generous open position (cf. fig. 5) with access via an<br>
access area 8. The relatively wide access area 8 is also brought about by a<br>
projecting arrangement of the air-to-fluid heat exchanger 7 (cf. figs. 4 and 5).<br>
An adjacent cabinet is then positioned in correspondingly spaced manner and<br>
the beveled construction of the fan door 6 also permit access to an adjacent<br>
cabinet, even if the fan doors 6 of both cabinets are opened according to fig. 5.<br>
The projecting air-to-fluid heat exchanger 7 only covers a relatively narrow<br>
residual area 9 of the back of cabinet 2.<br>
In an alternative system shown in figs 6 to 8, the substantially identically<br>
constructed air-to-fluid heat exchanger 7 is flush with a side wall 26 of cabinet<br>
2 (cf. figs 7 and 8). Therefore the heat exchanger 7 covers a wider residual area<br>
9 of the rear of cabinet 2 and the access area 8 closed by a fan door 6 in the<br>
closed position is narrower. However, this access area 8 still permits the<br>
extraction of electronic modular units when the fan door 6 according to fig. 8 is<br>
open, particularly in the case of a not shown blade server.<br>
Also in the fan door 6 of cabinet 2 of figs. 6 to 8 there are four superimposed<br>
fans 5 which suck exhaust air 10 from reception area 3 into door exhaust air<br>
area 15. Following a roughly 90° deflection the exhaust air 10 passes into heat<br>
exchanger 7 and is delivered to the environment after cooling by the cooling<br>
liquid, particularly cooling water in pipes 13, using an exit side 22.<br>
In figs. 6 to 8 identical reference numerals are used for identical features. The<br>
cooling arrangement manufacturable as a modular unit from a pivotable fan<br>
door 6 and a fixed exchanger 7 is able to replace a rear side or door of a<br>
cabinet. The fan door 6 of figs. 6 to 8, which is narrower than that of figs. 1 to<br>
5, has a correspondingly adapted closing device 29 and can be brought about a<br>
vertical pivot pin 25 into an open position pivoted by 180° (fig.8).<br>
Figs. 9 to 13 shows alternative constructions to the arrangement of the<br>
retrofittable cooling system. Unlike in figs. 6 to 8, in fig.9 the fan door 6 is<br>
articulated at the rear to cabinet 2 instead of to the air-to-fluid heat exchanger<br>
7 or heat exchanger housing 11. Fan door 6 and air-to-fluid heat exchanger 7<br>
extend over the rear of cabinet 2 and the connection side 20 of fan door 6 is<br><br>
bevelled in complimentary manner to the entrance side 21 of heat exchanger<br>
housing 11, so that the cross-section for air transfer is increased.<br>
Fig. 10 shows a fan door 6 which is articulated on the side opposite to the air-<br>
to-fluid heat exchanger 7. However, the pivot pin 25 is not located directly on<br>
cabinet 2 or in the vicinity of a side wall 28 of cabinet 2 and is instead<br>
positioned on an auxiliary structure 32, e.g. side wall 28, and therefore spaced<br>
from the cabinet rear. Due to the resulting larger opening angle there is a<br>
better accessibility to the cabinet.<br>
In fig. 11 fan door 6 about the externally located pivot pin 25 and heat<br>
exchanger housing 11 about the acing vertical pivot pin 35 can be pivoted<br>
outwards, so that the access width is virtually unrestricted. In the vicinity of<br>
the adjacent connection side 20 and entrance side 21a corresponding seal is<br>
provided, which can advantageously be assisted by the closing device (not<br>
shown) to be located here.<br>
Fig. 12 shows a further development in which the inventive system of fans and<br>
rigidly positioned heat exchangers (not shown) is implemented in a left-hand<br>
door 40 and a right-hand door 41, which e.g. in the manner shown can be<br>
constructed as door halves. The exhaust air from the cabinet 2 can be supplied<br>
by means of not shown fans to each heat exchanger in each door 40, 41, so<br>
that a particularly uniform heat removal is ensured.<br>
In the alternative construction according to fig. 13 there is only one door 44 on<br>
the rear of cabinet 2. In the vicinity of said door 24, which can be brought into<br>
an open position about a pivot pin 45, there is once again a heat exchanger<br>
(not shown) which is rigidly positioned and with said door 44 are only pivoted<br>
the fans located therein.	A<br><br>
