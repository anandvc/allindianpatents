				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a bone plate system with bone screws locked by set screws with<br>
controlled secondary compression. More particularly, this invention relates to systems for<br>
locking bone screws relative to bone plates.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
For various fractures of bones of the body, plating is a well known technique to impart the<br>
stabilization desirable for proper healing. In plating, a rigid, typically metal plate is placed on<br>
the outer surface of the bone across the fracture, and screws extend through the plate and<br>
are secured into the bone on either side of the fracture in a manner which permits the rigid<br>
plate to offer support to the bone during healing.<br>
The screws include threads along a shaft adapted to engage cortical bone. Most commonly,<br>
the head portion of the screw is a standard screw head which provides a compressive force<br>
about a corresponding round screw hole of the plate as the fixator is threaded into the<br>
bone, thereby causing compression of the plate against the bone.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. Re. 28,841 to Allgower describes a plate that is used with generally standard<br>
screws having heads with a convex undersurface. The plate includes oblong screw holes<br>
which each define at one end an upper ramped portion and a generally smaller radius of<br>
curvature about the ramped portion. In use, a hole is drilled into the bone through the<br>
screw hole adjacent the ramp and a screw is inserted into the drilled hole and rotated until<br>
the head of the screw contacts the ramp. Upon such engagement, there is displacement of<br>
the bone plate irr a direction to move the ramped portion away from the screw and to cause<br>
the plate to apply pressure to maintain the bone parts together about the fracture in tight<br>
engagement.<br><br>
More recently, particularly at the metaphysis of long bones though not limited thereto,<br>
there have been desirable results with threaded screws with threaded heads which threadably<br>
engage in threads in the plate to lock the screws relative to the plate and thereby limit<br>
compression of the plate relative to the bone. However, such systems do not provide the<br>
necessary control of compression between the plate and bone. Control over compressive<br>
forces is lost as soon as the threads of the head of the screw lock relative to the plate.<br>
Therefore, such a system provides sub-optimal stability.<br>
Certain plates sold by Synthes of Paoli, PA are designed with a hole called a COMBI-<br>
HOLE™. The COMBI-HOLE™ is an elongated screw hole including two joined circular<br>
sections, each extending through approximately 250°. One of the circular sections is threaded<br>
and thus adapted to receive a screw with a threaded head at a fixed angle. When used as such,<br>
the system has the same lack of control over compression as discussed above. The other<br>
circular section is non-threaded and thus adapted to receive a standard non-threaded head and<br>
provide compression against the plate. In such section a screw can be angled slightly relative<br>
to the hole. However, the angle of the screw cannot be fixed.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,549,612 to Yapp et al. teaches a system in which the angle of a screw<br>
can be fixed by use of a rotatable cam which contacts the head of the screw. However,<br>
because the cam is permanently mounted in an aperture in the plate and must be shaped to<br>
permit access for the bone screw, the cam cannot provide any downward force against the<br>
screw head, thereby limiting potential fixation. As such, if the cam rotates just a small amount<br>
from a locking angle, the fixation provided by the cam may be lost. Moreover, the shape of<br>
the cam (as shown in Figs. 4 and 4A of the patent) suggests that the cam applies an upward<br>
force against the screw head which disadvantageously counters the compressive force of the<br>
screw against the plate.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a plate and screw system whereby<br>
the amount of compression between the plate and bone can be controlled completely by the<br>
surgeon.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a plate and screw system in which each<br>
hole may be used in a fixed angle or variable angle manner with a screw.<br>
It is a further object of the invention to provide a plate and screw system wherein when<br>
a screw is inserted in a variable angle mode, it can thereafter be locked in a desired angle.<br>
It is also an object of the invention to provide a plate and screw system which is<br>
adapted to provide displacement of a plate in a direction which applies pressure to maintain the<br>
bone parts together in tight engagement about a fracture.<br>
It is an additional object of the invention to provide a plate and screw system which<br>
permits conventional screw-plate fixation. In accord with these objects, which will be<br>
discussed in detail below, a bone plating fixation system includes a plate, variable and fixed<br>
angle bone screws, and corresponding set screws for each type of bone screw. In accord with<br>
the invention, the plate includes common openings adapted to receive the variable and fixed<br>
angle bone screws, both of which can be locked relative to the plate. More particularly,<br>
the plate includes a hole system for the bone screws and set screws. The hole system defines a<br>
threadless bone screw hole and an adjacent set screw hole. While the upper ends of the bone<br>
screw hole and set screw hole define a common opening in the upper end of the plate, the<br>
lower ends of the respective holes define distinct openings in plate. The bone screw hole<br>
includes an upper larger cylindrical portion, a central spherical portion, and a lower smaller<br>
cylindrical portion. In one embodiment, adjacent the set screw hole, the bone screw hole<br>
includes an upper ramp portion for imparting compression across a fracture and a lower<br>
portion with a smaller radius of curvature. In the same embodiment, the set screw hole<br>
includes an upper conical portion, a central cylindrical portion, a shelf, and a lower threaded<br>
portion. As the screw is seated, the head of the set screw is forced against the head of the bone<br>
screw to lock to the bone screw in position.<br><br>
The bone screws preferably include both variable angle and fixed angle screws. Each<br>
variable angle screw has a head portion with a spherical curve. A set screw for use therewith<br>
includes a spherically-concave head matched in radius to the head of the bone screw. In use, a<br>
hole is drilled for the bone screw at a desired angle through the bone screw hole of the plate,<br>
and the bone screw is driven into the bone. Once the desired amount of the compression is<br>
created between the plate and bone, as determined by the surgeon and not by limitation of the<br>
system, the position of the bone screw relative to the plate can be fixed by insertion of the set<br>
screw into the set screw hole. The set screw is driven until sufficient compressive forces are<br>
developed (both downward and radial) between the spherically concave portion of the set<br>
screw and the spherically concave portion of the opposite wall of the bone screw hole so as to<br>
lock the head of the bone screw therebetween relative to the plate. Thus, the variable angle<br>
bone screw can be used to compress the plate against the bone and can then be locked at such<br>
variable angle without later loosening, as the bone screw is held in relation to the plate by the<br>
set screw.<br>
Each fixed angle bone screw has a head with upper and lower cylindrical portions and a<br>
central spherical portion that matches the dimensions and radius of the bone screw hole. In<br>
addition, the upper edge of the head is provided with a conical taper. The set screw for use<br>
with the fixed angle bone screw includes a lower cylindrical portion and an upper conical lip.<br>
In use, a hole is drilled through the bone screw hole of the plate and into bone substantially<br>
concentric with the circular center defined by the upper and lower cylindrical portions of the<br>
bone screw hole. A fixed angle bone screw is then driven into the bone to effect a desired<br>
compression of the plate against the bone. Then, to fix the level of compression and to prevent<br>
any loosening that may occur through micromotion, the set screw is inserted into the set screw<br>
hole until the conical lip creates sufficient force (downward and radial) against the head of the<br>
bone screw to prevent any backing off of the bone screw.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention, a locking washer is provided in a<br>
common opening of the plate. When the set screw is inserted into the plate, the set screw<br>
causes the washer to be longitudinally forced against the head of the bone screw to lock the<br>
bone screw in the plate. The side of the washer contacting the head of the bone screw may be<br><br>
spherically concave to provide maximum surface area contact to heads of such shape. In addition,<br>
the contact surfaces of the both the washer and the bone screw head may be provided with high<br>
friction textured surfaces to aid in locking the bone screw relative to the plate.<br>
In accord with another mode of use of the plate and the variable angle screw, a hole is drilled for<br>
the screw along an axis which is offset towards the ramp and away from the circular center defined<br>
by the upper and lower cylindrical portions of the screw hole. The bone screw is driven into the<br>
hole until the head of the screw contacts the ramp portion which causes displacement of the plate<br>
by the distance required to seat the head in the concave spherical portions. This displacement<br>
applies pressure to maintain the bone parts together in tight engagement about a fracture. The set<br>
screw, and washer where provided, are then used to fix the level of compression and prevent<br>
loosening.<br>
The plate and screws also allow conventional screw-plate fixation. That is, surgeons frequently<br>
desire to use different holes in different modes; i.e., either fixed angle or variable angle. Screws<br>
can be quickly inserted on each side of the fracture in a free-hand manner during fracture<br>
reduction. Thereafter, using other holes in the plate the surgeon can implant fixed angle screws<br>
and optionally other variable angle screws.<br>
Additional objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art<br>
upon reference to the detailed description taken in conjunction with the provided figures.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Turning now to Figs. 1 and 2, a bone plating system 10 according to the invention<br>
includes a plate 12, and one or both of bone screws 14, 114, and set screws 16, 116. The plate<br>
12 can be any orthopedic plate which has application in providing compression or other<br>
stabilization to bone, including but not limited to, plates for fractures of the diaphysis and/or<br>
metaphysis of long bones, plates for placement on the mandible or other portions of the skull,<br>
and plates for osteosynthesis, particularly along the vertebrae.<br>
Referring to Figs. 3 and 4, the plate 12 includes a plurality of a hole systems 18 for the<br>
bone screws and set screws. Depending upon the application, such hole systems can reside on<br>
each side of a fracture. More particularly, each hole system 18 defines a threadless bone screw<br>
hole 20 and an adjacent threaded set screw hole 22. While the upper ends of the bone screw<br>
hole 20 and set screw hole 22 define a common opening 24 in the upper surface 26 of the plate<br>
12, the lower ends of the respective holes preferably define distinct openings 28, 30 in the<br>
lower surface 32 of the plate.<br>
Referring to Figs. 1 and 3, the bone screw hole 20 includes an upper larger cylindrical<br>
portion 34, a central spherical portion 36, and a lower smaller cylindrical portion 38. The<br>
cylindrical portions 34 and 38 alternatively may be frustoconical in shape. Adjacent the set<br>
screw hole 22, the bone screw hole 20 includes an upper ramp portion 40 for imparting<br>
compression across a fracture, as discussed below, and a lower portion 42 with a smaller radius<br>
of curvature than cylindrical portion 38. The set screw hole 22 includes an upper conical<br><br>
portion 44, a central cylindrical portion 46, a shelf 48, and a lower portion 50 provided with<br>
machine threads.<br>
The bone screws preferably include both variable angle screws 14 and fixed angle<br>
screws 114. Referring to Fig. 1, each variable angle screw 14 has a head portion 60 which is<br>
spherically curved and includes an upper recess 62, e.g., hex slot, for a driver, and a threaded<br>
shaft 64 preferably including a self-drilling fluted tip 66. The set screw 16 for use with the<br>
variable angle screw 14 includes a head 70 having an upper spherically concave portion 72,<br>
matched to the radius of curvature of head portion 60, and a lower cylindrical portion 74. The<br>
set screw 16 also includes a shaft 76 with machine threads sized to engage in threads 50 of the<br>
set screw holes. The set screw further includes an upper recess 78, e.g., a hex slot for<br>
rotationally driving the set screw. In accord with an aspect of the invention, it is preferable<br>
that upper recesses 62 and 78 have the same shape and dimension such that each can be driven<br>
by the same tool.<br>
In use, a hole is drilled in a desired angle through the bone screw hole of the plate 12<br>
and into bone for the variable angle screw 14. The bone screw 14 is then driven into the bone<br>
80, e.g., the diaphyseal bone shown, through the hole. Alternatively, the bone screw is driven<br>
at the desired angled without pre-drilling. Once the head 60 of the screw 14 reaches the plate<br>
12, the screw 14 is driven until the desired amount of the compression is created between the<br>
plate 12 and bone 80. This generally requires at least 180° of rotation, and often several<br>
complete rotations of the screw. The bone screw 14 then can be fixed relative to the plate 12<br>
by insertion of the set screw 16 into the set screw hole 22. The set screw 16 is driven until<br>
sufficient compressive forces are developed between the spherically concave portion 72 of the<br>
set screw 16 and the spherically concave portion 36 of the opposite wall of the bone screw hole<br>
20 so as to lock the head 60 of the bone screw 14 therebetween relative to the plate 12. Thus,<br>
the variable angle bone screw 16 can be used to compress the plate 12 against the bone 80 at a<br>
desired angle and can then be locked at such angle and positioning without later loosening, as<br>
the bone screw 14 is held in relation to the plate 12 by the set screw 16.<br>
Referring back to Fig. 2, each fixed angle bone screw 114 is substantially similar to the<br>
variable angle bone screw 14, with distinction in the shape of the head 160. The head 160<br><br>
includes upper and lower cylindrical portions 192, 194, and a central spherical portion 196 that<br>
matches the dimensions and radius of the bone screw hole. In addition, the upper edge of the<br>
head 160 is provided with a conical taper 198. The set screw 116 for use with the fixed angle<br>
bone screw 114 is substantially similar to the set screw 16, with distinction to the shape of its<br>
head 200. The head 200 of the set screw 116 includes a lower cylindrical portion 202 and an<br>
upper conical lip 204.<br>
In use, the fixed angle bone screw 114 is driven (with or without pre-drilling a pilot<br>
hole) at a location substantially concentric with the circular center defined by the upper and .<br>
lower cylindrical portions 34, 38, of the bone screw hole 20 (Fig. 3). The head 160 of the<br>
screw 114 seats within the space defined by portions 34, 36, 38 and as head 160 is driven<br>
toward the bone, the plate is compressed against the bone. The bone screw 114 can be driven<br>
until a desired compression is effected. The bone screw is maintained in a fixed angle (i.e.,<br>
normal to the plate) by being subject to three points of fixation. Upon insertion of the set<br>
screw 116 into screw hole 22, upper and lower cylindrical portions 34, 38 of the screw hole 20<br>
and cylindrical portion 202 of the set screw 116 provide the three points of fixation. In<br>
addition, to fix the level of compression and to prevent any loosening that may occur through<br>
micromotion, the set screw 116 is driven until the conical lip 204 creates sufficient force<br>
against the head 160 of the bone screw 114 at taper 198 so as to prevent any backing off of the<br>
bone screw 114. That is, the set screw 116 locks the bone screw 114 in place.<br>
Turning now to Fig. 5, in accord with another mode of using the plate and the variable<br>
angle screw 14, a hole is drilled for the screw 14 along an axis normal to the plate which is<br>
offset towards the ramp 40 and generally concentric with cylindrical portion 42; i.e., away<br>
from the circular center defined by the upper and lower cylindrical portions 34, 38 of the screw<br>
hole 20. The bone screw 14 is then driven into the hole until the lower portion 60a of the<br>
spherical head 60 of the screw contacts the ramp 40 and thus causes displacement of the plate<br>
12 in the direction of the arrow by the distance required to seat the head 60 in the concave<br>
spherical portion 36. This displacement applies pressure which maintains bone parts together<br>
about a fracture in tight engagement. The set screw 16 is then used, as previously described, to<br>
fix the level of compression and lock the screw to the plate 12 to prevent loosening.<br><br>
The plate and screws can also be used in a manner which is known to those familiar to<br>
screw-plate fixation. That is, surgeons frequently desire to use different holes in different<br>
modes; i.e., either fixed angle or variable angle. By way of example, screws can be quickly<br>
inserted on each side of the fracture in a free-hand variable angle manner during fracture<br>
reduction. Thereafter, using other holes in the plate and careful alignment, e.g., drilling pilot<br>
holes with a drill guide, the surgeon can implant fixed angle screws.<br>
Turning now to Figs. 6 and 7, a second embodiment of the invention is shown. The<br>
system includes a plate 312 having a hole system 318 which include a threadless bone screw<br>
hole 320, a slot 350 for a washer 352, and a set screw hole 322 for set screw 316. The bone<br>
screw hole 320, as described above, includes an upper larger cylindrical portion 334, a central<br>
spherical portion 336, and a lower smaller cylindrical portion 338. A bone screw, e.g., screw<br>
14 described above, can be provided in the screw hole 320. The slot 350 includes a rear<br>
camming ramp 354. The washer 352 includes a cam surface 356 which rides on the camming<br>
ramp 354, a substantially spherically concave contact face 358 directed toward the bone screw<br>
hole 320, and an oblong slot 360 for the head 370 and shaft 372 of the set screw 316. The set<br>
screw hole 322 in the plate 312 is preferably uniform in diameter. The set screw head 370 is<br>
preferably cylindrical, and the shaft 372 of the set screw 316 threadably engages the set screw<br>
hole 322. The washer 352 and set screw 316 are preferably pre-installed in the slot 350 and set<br>
screw hole 322 (as shown in Fig. 6) prior to positioning the plate 312 on the bone (e.g., at the<br>
factory or by an operating room technician).<br>
In use, a hole is drilled in a desired angle through the bone screw hole 320 and into<br>
bone for the variable angle screw 14. The bone screw 14 is then driven into the bone through<br>
the hole. Alternatively, the bone screw is driven at the desired angled without pre-drilling. As<br>
yet another alternative, a fixed angle screw 114 (Fig. 2) may be inserted into a hole drilled<br>
concentric with the bone screw hole 320.<br>
Once the head 60 of the screw 14 reaches the plate 312, the screw 14 is driven until the<br>
desired amount of the compression is created between the plate and bone. The relation of the<br>
bone screw 14 relative to the plate, including its angular position, can then be fixed relative to<br>
the plate 312 by rotating the set screw 316 into the set screw hole 322 to cause the washer 352<br><br>
to be forced down and forward, along rear camming ramp 354. Referring to Figs. 8 and 9, this<br>
results in contact face 358 being driven toward and into the head 60 of the screw. The set<br>
screw 16 is rotated until sufficient compressive forces are developed between the contact face<br>
358 of the washer and the spherically concave portion 336 of the opposite wall of the bone<br>
screw hole 320 so as to lock the head 60 of the bone screw 14 therebetween. The amount of<br>
rotation is generally at least 180° which provides suitable travel for the head 370 of the set<br>
screw and sufficient engagement between the shaft 372 of the set screw and the plate. In<br>
addition, the bone screw hole may 320 be slightly eccentric or the contact face 358 may be<br>
slightly aspheric so as to cause three points of circumferential contact when the washer is<br>
driven toward the bone screw for even greater stability. It is appreciated that by driving a<br>
washer 352 toward the bone screw head 60 significantly greater surface area is available to<br>
develop larger compressive forces relative to the use of a set screw. Further, by longitudinally<br>
driving the washer, the contact face 358 and outer surface of the bone screw head 60 can be<br>
provided with a textured high friction surface, discussed below, which is not generally<br>
practical when two surfaces must be rotated relative to each other. The above system can<br>
similarly be used with a fixed angle bone screw 114 (Fig. 2).<br>
It is also noted that upper edge 374 of the of contact face 358 may be further beveled<br>
and/or contoured to function as a ramp to enable displacement of the plate 312; i.e., to function<br>
similarly to ramp 40, described above.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 10, a third embodiment of the invention, similar to the second<br>
embodiment, is shown. The plate 412 includes a hole system defining a bone screw hole 420,<br>
a washer slot 450, and a set screw hole 422. The washer slot 450 includes upper and lower<br>
portions 476, 478 with a step or ramp 480 therebetween. The washer 452 includes a<br>
spherically concave textured contact face 458 (e.g., with knurls), an opening 460 defined by a<br>
circular upper rim 492, and front and rear walls 494, 496 of equal height. The front wall 494<br>
has lower portion 500 with a constant radius which is approximately 80% of the height of the<br>
front wall and an upper conically beveled portion 502 which extends approximately 10% of the<br>
height of the front wall. The rear wall 496 has a lower portion 504 with the constant radius<br>
which is approximately 25% of the height of the rear wall and an upper conically beveled<br>
portion 506 which extends approximately 65% of the height of the rear wall. Lower portions<br><br>
500 and 504 have the same radius, though their radial centers are longitudinally offset along<br>
the longitudinal axis of the hole system. In addition, beveled portions 502 and 506 are beveled<br>
at the same angle. The set screw 416 includes a head 470 with a conically sloped undersurface<br>
which functions as a cam, as described below. The bone screw 414 is similar to screw 14, but<br>
the head 460 of the screw includes a textured surface, e.g., with circumferential grooves 510.<br>
In use, the system is operated in a substantially similar manner to that described above<br>
with respect to Figs. 6-9. The distinctions are as follows. In the initial positions of the set<br>
screw 416 and washer 452, shown in Fig. 10, the shaft 472 of the set screw 416 abuts lower<br>
portion 500 of the front wall 494 and the conical undersurface of the head 470 of the set screw<br>
contacts the edge of the rim 492. Referring to Figs. 11 and 12, as the set screw 416 is driven<br>
into the hole 422, the slope on the undersurface of the head 470 forces the washer 452 toward<br>
the head 460 of the bone screw 414. Once the washer has moved toward the head of the bone<br>
screw, the top of head 470 of the set screw fully seats within the circumferential rim 492,<br>
locking the washer 452 in place. In addition, the textured surfaces on the contact face 458 and<br>
head 460 operate to create a secure interlock.<br>
Referring now to Figs. 13 and 14, a fourth embodiment of the invention, substantially<br>
similar to the third embodiment, is shown. The distinctions are as follows. The slot 650 is<br>
shorter and includes a rear wall 654 which is sloped to correspond to the conical shape of the<br>
undersurface of the head 670 of the set screw 616. The washer 650 does not include a rear<br>
wall, and preferably terminates at or forward to the diameter D of the set screw head which is<br>
transverse to the longitudinal axis A of the hole system. This construction permits a relatively<br>
smaller washer and smaller overall locking system, but functions substantially the same as the<br>
previous embodiment.<br>
Turning now to Fig. 15, a fifth embodiment of the invention similar to the embodiment<br>
shown in Fig. 2 is provided. The set screw hole 722 includes an upper frustoconical (or<br>
cylindrical) portion 746, a shelf 748, and a lower portion 750 provided with machine threads<br>
(but no upper conically flared portion in distinction from the embodiment of Fig. 2). The set<br>
screw 716 includes a head 770 with an upper lateral lip 775.<br><br>
After insertion of a fixed angle bone screw 114 into the bone screw hole 720 as<br>
described above, the set screw 716 is inserted in the set screw hole 722.<br>
The bone screw 114 can be driven until a desired compression is effected. The bone screw 114<br>
is maintained in a fixed angle by the corresponding shapes of the 160 head of the bone screw<br>
and the above described contour of the bone screw hole 720 (see description with respect to<br>
bone screw hole 20). In order to lock the bone screw 114 within the bone screw hole 720, the<br>
set screw 116 is driven until the lateral lip 775 provides compression against the top surface<br>
161 of the head 160 of the bone screw 114.<br>
While various bone screw holes have been described that can accommodate both fixed<br>
angle and variable angle screws, it is appreciated that bone screw holes may be provided than<br>
can accommodate only a fixed angle or variable angle screw which is then locked to the plate.<br>
For example, for a fixed angle screw, the screw hole may be a single frustoconical hole which<br>
prevents travel of a frustoconical bone screw head through the hole. Alternatively, the hole<br>
may be a stepped cylinder which provides similar advantage to a correspondingly shaped head<br>
of a bone screw.<br>
There have been described and illustrated herein embodiments of a bone plating system<br>
and method of using the same. While particular embodiments of the invention have been<br>
described, it is not intended that the invention be limited thereto, as it is intended that the<br>
invention be as broad in scope as the art will allow and that the specification be read likewise.<br>
It will therefore be appreciated by those skilled in the art that yet other modifications could be<br>
made to the provided invention without deviating from its scope as claimed.<br><br>
