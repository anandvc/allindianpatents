				<td>IMMUNE STIMULATORY INFANT NUTRITION	<br>
Description<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION		<br>
 The present invention relates to a nutritional composition containing a fat component and a carbohydrate component and comprising whey and casein and to the use<br>
of said composition<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Breastfeeding optimally supports the development of the infant and<br>
protects against infections. However, not all infants are in the position to<br>
receive human milk. It is therefore a continuing aim to provide infant<br>
formula, which simulates the functions of human milk. In addition to the<br>
desired compositional similarity between infant formula and human milk,<br>
it is also particularly desirable to mimic the protective effects of human<br>
milk. Human milk has for example been shown that human milk protects<br>
against infections and allergies.<br>
In current infant formulas, the casein to whey ratio resembles that of<br>
human milk as closely as possible. It is believed that this ratio results in<br>
optimal growth for the infant. However, there are still several downsides<br>
attached to the use of bovine, whey dominant protein sources. These<br>
whey dominant formulas do not optimally protect against infections.<br>
Administration of such formula results in an impaired development of the<br>
intestinal flora of the infant compared infants fed with human milk,<br>
particularly in the first three to four weeks of life. The flora of infants fed<br>
with the whey dominant formula contains more or less the same bacterial<br>
genera as the human milk fed infants, however, the quantity of beneficial<br>
bacteria is reduced in infants receiving the whey dominant formula<br>
compared to infants receiving human milk. Moreover, the flora of infants<br>
fed with formulas containing whey dominant bovine protein source<br>
contain increased amounts pathological bacteria such as Clostridia and<br><br>
enterobacteria. Hence, feeding an infant with whey dominant formula<br>
results in the formation of a "suboptimal intestinal flora".<br>
As the very young infants have an immature immune system and an<br>
immature intestinal tract, development of the suboptimal intestinal flora<br>
may result in infection, diarrhea, allergy and inflammation. Especially<br>
infants with the age between 0 and 30 days and fed with bovine whey-<br>
dominant protein containing formula suffer from these risk as their faecal<br>
flora is most different from those infant fed human milk.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide a nutritional or<br>
pharmaceutical composition which reduces the risks attached to feeding<br>
whey dominant infant formula.<br>
This object is solved by a composition according to claim 1.<br>
The composition of the present invention is characterized in that<br>
the weight ratio of casein to whey is 1:1 to 1:2.4 and<br>
that the composition contains:<br>
a)	at least 3 grams arginine per 100 grams protein;<br>
b)	at least 10 wt.% linoleic acid (LA) based on total fatty acids,<br>
c)	at least 1 wt.% alpha linolenic acid (ALA) based on total fatty acids;<br>
d)	at least one long chain-polyunsaturated fatty acid (LCPUFA) in an<br>
amount exceeding 0.1 wt.% based on total fatty acids, said long chain-<br>
polyunsaturated fatty acid (LCPUFA) being selected from the group<br>
consisting of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), arachidonic acid (ARA) and<br>
eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA);<br>
e)	5 to 25 wt.% of at least one polyunsaturated fatty acid based on total<br>
fatty acids; and<br>
f)	2 to 12 grams indigestible oligosaccharides having a degree of<br>
polymerisation of 2 to 100 per 100 gram dry weight of the composition.<br>
The present composition stimulates the maturation of the immune system<br>
and the maturation of the intestinal tract. The composition of the<br><br>
invention is particularly suitable for preventing and/or treating<br>
inflammatory disorders in infants, such as infection, diarrhea and allergy.<br>
The present composition:<br>
•	stimulates the development of a "optimal intestinal flora" (i.e. a flora<br>
similar to the flora resulting by feeding human milk);<br>
•	stimulates the maturation the gastrointestinal tract, thereby preventing<br>
entry of allergens such as pathological bacteria, toxins and food<br>
allergens into the systemic circulation;<br>
•	stimulates the maturation of the immune system, resulting in a better<br>
defense in case an allergen, pathogen or toxin crosses the intestinal<br>
barrier and/or enters the systemic circulation;<br>
•	while providing optimal nutrition to the infant.<br>
It is believed that physiological processes underlying the development of<br>
a "low risk intestinal flora", the maturation of the gut and the maturation<br>
of immune system are highly inter-related and co-dependent. Hence,<br>
infant formula should include all those ingredients, in a proper balance,<br>
which stimulate the maturation of the gut, the maturation of the immune<br>
system and the development of a low risk intestinal flora. With the<br>
optimal combination of ingredients, the infant is better protected from<br>
allergens. The present composition provides such optimal combination of<br>
ingredients. Because the ingredients often act on different mechanisms,<br>
the ingredients of the present composition act synergistically, providing<br>
the infant with an improved resistance and reducing the incidence of<br>
inflammatory disorder, particularly allergy.<br>
The present composition comprises oligosaccharides with a low degree of<br>
polymerization. The oligosaccharides stimulate the formation of a low risk<br>
intestinal flora, particularly reducing the count of (potentially) pathological<br>
intestinal bacteria such as Clostridia, enterobacteriae and/or enterococci;<br>
and stimulating the colonization by bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. The<br>
bifidobacteria and lactobacilli stimulate the maturation of the gut e.g. by<br><br>
stimulating the synthesis of fuco-oligosaccharides by intestinal epithelial<br>
cells. Optimal stimulation is achieved by inclusion of a mix of different<br>
oligosaccharides, particularly a mix of oligosaccharides including both<br>
neutral and acidic oligosaccharides. The oligosaccharides also have a<br>
"direct" effect on the immune system through lowering the Th2 response<br>
and increasing the Th1 response. It was found that the present<br>
composition which includes oligosaccharides can be advantageously<br>
used to restore disbalance in the Th1/Th2 responses and for the<br>
treatment and prevention of disorders which are associated with Th1/Th2<br>
disbalance, such as autoimmunity and allergy.<br>
However, even when combining oligosaccharides with non-human whey<br>
dominant protein, the infants receiving this composition are suffering from<br>
increased risks of infections during the first month of life. Hence it is<br>
desirable to further improve immune system and/or gut maturity.<br>
It has been surprisingly found that LCPUFA's effectively reduce epithelial<br>
paracellular permeability. In contrast to what Usami et al (Clinical<br>
Nutrition 2001, 20(4): 351-359) have reported, it has been found that C18<br>
and C20 polyunsaturated fatty acids, particularly eicosapentaenoic acid<br>
(EPA; C20:5 n3) docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; C22:56 n3) and<br>
arachidonic acid (AA; C20:4) are capable of effectively reducing<br>
intestinal tight junction permeability, thereby stimulating the maturation of<br>
the gut. Hence, the present composition advantageously includes<br>
LCPUFA's. In addition the essential fatty acids linoleic acid (C18:2 n6)<br>
and alpha linolenic acid (C18:3 n3) are indispensable for both maturation<br>
of the immune system as well as for maturation of the intestinal tract. In a<br>
further particularly preferred embodiment, the present composition also<br>
contains gamma-linolenic acid (GLA; C18:3 (n-6)). The present<br>
composition therefore contains linoleic acid and alpha linolenic acid.<br>
Optionally, but highly preferably the present composition also comprises<br>
nucleotides and/or nucleosides. Nucleotides stimulate the maturation of<br>
the intestinal tract, reduce the incidence of diarrhea and stimulates the<br>
immune system. Infants fed nucleotide supplemented versus non-<br><br>
supplemented formula have increasing antibody titers following exhibition<br>
to antigen and stimulating antigen natural killer cell activity. (Carver et al<br>
Acta Paediatrica, (1999) Vol. 88, No. Sup 430, pp. 83-88).<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The composition of the present invention comprises a whey dominant<br>
non-human protein source, long chain-polyunsaturated fatty acids and<br>
oligosaccharides.<br>
As already said above the present invention provides a composition<br>
comprising whey and casein in a weight ratio casein to whey of 1:1 to<br>
1:2.4 and at least 3 grams arginine per 100 grams protein.<br>
The range of 1:1 to 1:2.4 for the casein/whey ratio comprises all values<br>
lying in this range and therefore for instance the following ratios of casein<br>
to whey: 1:1, 1:1.1, 1:1.2, 1:1.3, 1:1.4, 1:1.5, 1:1.6, 1:1.7, 1:1.7, 1: 1.9,<br>
1:1.2, 1:1.3, 1:1.4, 1:1.5, 1:1.6, 1:1.7, 1:1.8, 1:1.9, 1:2.0, 1:2.1, 1:2.2,<br>
1:2.3, and 1:2.4. In a preferred embodiment the casein:whey ratio is 1:<br>
1.4 - 1.6, even more preferably about 1:1.5 (40:60)<br>
The arginine is preferably present in an amount of 3 to 8 grams arginine<br>
per 100 grams protein component. This range discloses all values and in<br>
particular all integer values lying in this range such as 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8<br>
grams. The composition contains preferably 4 to 5 grams arginine per<br>
100 gram protein.<br>
The LCPUFA's present in the composition are selected from the group<br>
consisting of DHA, AA and EPA. This means that one or two or three of<br>
said long chain-polyunsaturated fatty acids can be present.<br>
The range of 5 to 25 wt.-% given for the polyunsaturated fatty acids<br>
discloses all values falling in this range.<br>
The present composition does not include a composition consisting of<br>
human milk. The present method does not include a method comprising<br>
the administration of a composition consisting of human milk. Hence,<br><br>
preferably the present method includes the administration of a<br>
composition comprising a substance of non-human origin, preferably a<br>
fiber carbohydrate, fat and/or protein of non-human origin, preferably<br>
from plant, animal, bacterial or synthetic origin. Preferably all off the<br>
components and constituents out of which the composition of the<br>
invention is prepared originate from non-human sources.<br>
Macronutrients<br>
The present composition can be advantageously used as an infant<br>
formula. Such infant formula preferably contains a lipid component, a<br>
protein component and a carbohydrate component and is preferably<br>
administered to the infant in liquid form.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the present invention relates to a composition<br>
and in particular to an infant formula which comprises 30 to 60 en% lipid;<br>
5 to 15 en% protein; and 25 to 75 en% carbohydrate. Preferably the<br>
composition comprises 5 to 15 en% protein, 30 to 60 en% fat and 25 to<br>
65 en% carbohydrate. More Preferably, the present composition contains<br>
43 to 53 en% lipid; 7 to 11 en% protein; and 43 to 53 en% carbohydrate<br>
(en% is short for energy percentage and represents the relative amount<br>
each constituent contributes to the total caloric value of the preparation).<br>
The protein component of the present infant formula contains casein and<br>
whey in a weight ratio mentioned above. The casein and/or whey are<br>
preferably derived from non-human mammalian milk. For providing<br>
optimal nutrition to the infant, the composition contains arginine in the<br>
specified amount, The term "protein" or protein component in this context<br>
is the cumulative of protein, polypeptides, peptides and amino acids.<br>
Arginine is indispensable in the present composition. It reduces the<br>
incidence of inflammatory conditions of the intestine (Amin et al Journal<br>
of Pediatrics, (2002) Vol. 140, No. 4, pp. 425-431). Furthermore, arginine<br>
stimulates the immune system, and is required for maintenance of a<br>
healthy immune system (Niever et al, Biomedicine &amp; Pharmacotherapy,<br>
(2002) Vol. 56, No. 10, pp. 471-482). Casein and whey contain arginine,<br><br>
but for most milk sources (e.g. bovine whey and casein) the casein and<br>
whey provide an insufficient arginine. Preferably at least part of the<br>
arginine supplemented to the composition in the form a free amino acid<br>
base, e.g. as L-arginine, or in the form of a salt or ester thereof whereby<br>
the free amino acid is preferred The present composition preferably<br>
comprises between 75 and 500 mg arginine in the form of free amino acid<br>
per 100 gram of the dry infant formula, more preferably with between 150<br>
and 400 mg arginine in the form of free amino acid per 100 gram of the<br>
dry infant formula.<br>
The carbohydrate in the present composition is preferably provided<br>
largely by lactose, i.e. preferably at least 75 wt.% of total digestible<br>
carbohydrate is provided by lactose, preferably at least 90 wt.%.<br>
Low threonine protein<br>
Whey dominant infant formulas from non-human protein source typically<br>
have a high content of bioavailable threonine compared to human milk.<br>
Human milk contains relatively small amounts of bioavailable threonine.<br>
Hence, processes for the reduction of the threonine content of whey<br>
dominant formulas are provided for in the art (see for example<br>
EP1048226, WO0111990 and EP741522). Administering reduced<br>
threonine whey dominant infant formula gives in vivo threonine profiles,<br>
which are comparable to those of breast fed infants. The present<br>
composition preferably is a low-threonine composition, i.e. composition<br>
which comprises 2 to 6 grams threonine per 100 gram protein. The low-<br>
threonine content can for example be accomplished by using whey<br>
products prepared by ultrafiltration or certain acidic whey products.<br>
Essential fatty acids content<br>
The present composition contains at least 10 wt.% linoleic acid (LA)<br>
based on total fatty acids, preferably between 11 and 20 wt.%, more<br>
preferably between 12 and 15 wt.%. The present composition preferably<br>
contains at least 1 wt.% alpha linolenic acid (ALA) based on total fatty<br><br>
acids, preferably between 1.5 and 4 wt.% ALA, even more preferably<br>
between 2 and 2.5 wt.%. To reduce intestinal stress, the weight ratio<br>
LA/ALA is preferably between 2 and 10, preferably between 5 and 7.5.<br>
The present composition preferably includes between 0.05 and 5 wt%<br>
gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) based on total fatty acids, preferably<br>
between 0.1 and 1 wt.%.<br>
Long chain-polyunsaturated fatty acid content<br>
The present composition comprises at least one long chain-<br>
polyunsaturated fatty acid with 20 or 22 carbon atoms (LCPUFA) in an<br>
amount exceeding 0.1 wt.% based on total fatty acids, selected from the<br>
group consisting of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), arachidonic acid (AA)<br>
and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Preferably the composition contains<br>
DHA in an amount exceeding 0.1 wt.% based on total fatty acids; and AA<br>
in an amount exceeding 0.1 wt.% based on total fatty acids.<br>
Preferably at least one LCPUFA of this group is included in an amount<br>
between 0.15 and 1 wt.% based on total fatty acid content of the<br>
composition. Preferably at least two of these LCPUFA's are present in an<br>
amount of between 0.15 and 1 wt.% based on total fatty acid content of<br>
the composition. Preferably the composition contains AA and DHA, even<br>
more preferably AA, DHA and EPA.<br>
The AA content preferably does not exceed 5 wt.%, more preferably does<br>
not exceed 1 wt.%, most preferably between 0.1 and 0.6 wt.% of the total<br>
fatty acids. In the present composition, EPA and/or DHA are<br>
advantageously added to balance the action of AA, e.g. reduce the<br>
potential pro-inflammatory action of AA metabolites. Excess metabolites<br>
from AA may cause inflammation. Hence, the present composition<br>
preferably comprises AA, EPA and/or DHA, wherein the weight ratio<br>
AA/DHA preferably is above 0.25, preferably above 0.5, even more<br>
preferably above 1. The ratio AA/DHA is preferably below 25, preferably<br>
below 10. The weight ratio AA/EPA is preferably between 1 and 100,<br><br>
more preferably between 5 and 20. The weight ratio EPA/DHA is<br>
preferably 1 or lower, more preferably below 0.5.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the content of LCPUFA does not exceed 3<br>
wt.% of the total fatty acids as it is desirable to mimic human milk as<br>
closely as possible. For the same reason, the present composition<br>
preferably contains less than 1 gram omega-3 LCPUFA per 100 gram<br>
fatty acids, more preferably between 0.1 and 0.75 gram per 100 gram<br>
fatty acids. The omega-6 LCPUFA content preferably does not exceed 2<br>
gram per 100 gram fatty acids and is preferably between 0.1 and 0.75<br>
gram per 100 gram fatty acids.<br>
The LCPUFAs and the other fatty acids may be provided as free fatty<br>
acids, in triglyceride form, in phospholipid form, or as a mixture of one of<br>
more of the above. The present composition advantageously comprises<br>
at least one of AA and DHA in phospholipid form, as these reduce the<br>
incidence of inflammatory disorders of the intestine. The present<br>
composition preferably comprises between 0.1 and 5 mg AA from<br>
phospholipid per gram total fat and between 0.1 and 5 mg DHA from<br>
phospholipid per gram total fat. Preferably the AA and/or DHA are at<br>
least partly present in the form of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and/or<br>
phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), e.g. AA and/or DHA containing PE<br>
and/or PC.<br>
Monounsaturated fatty acid<br>
The present nutritional composition preferably also contains omega-9 (n-<br>
9) fatty acid (preferably oleic acid, 18:1), to provide sufficient nutrition.<br>
Preferably the present composition provides at least 15 wt.% n-9 fatty<br>
acid based on the weight of the total fatty acids, more preferably at least<br>
25 wt.%. The content of n-9 fatty acids is preferably below 80 wt.% based<br>
on the weight of the total fatty acids. To provide sufficient nutrition, the<br>
present composition preferably has a weight ratio saturated fatty<br>
acid/polyunsaturated fatty acid between 2 and 5. The weight ratio<br><br>
monounsaturated fatty acid/saturated fatty acid is preferably between 0.5<br>
and 2.<br>
The present composition preferably comprises between 5 and 25 wt.%<br>
polyunsaturated fatty acids based on total fatty acids, preferably between<br>
10 and 20 wt.%.<br>
The present composition can be even further improved by inclusion of<br>
stearidonic acid (C18:4n3). The composition preferably contains between<br>
0.05 and 2 wt.% stearidonic acid based total fatty acids, even more<br>
preferably between 0.1 and 1 wt.%.<br>
Oligosaccharides<br>
The present composition comprises 2 to 12 grams indigestible<br>
oligosaccharides with a degree of polymerisation (DP) of 2 and 100 per<br>
100 gram dry weight of the composition, preferably between 3 and 8<br>
grams, more preferably between 5 and 7.5 grams. After reconstitution of<br>
the powder in liquid and administration of the liquid formula to the infant,<br>
these amounts of indigestible oligosaccharides provide the desired<br>
effects without causing intestinal discomfort. Suitable indigestible<br>
oligosaccharides are not or only partially digested in the intestine by the<br>
action of acids or digestive enzymes present in the human upper<br>
digestive tract (small intestine and stomach), but are fermentable by the<br>
human intestinal flora. The oligosaccharides are preferably water-soluble<br>
(exceeding a solubility of 1 gram oligosaccharide per liter water). The<br>
average DP of the present oligosaccharide is preferably below 40, even<br>
more preferably below 20. Optimally, the present composition comprises<br>
between 2 and 12 grams oligosaccharides with a DP of 2 to 60, more<br>
preferably with a DP of 2 to 10 (i.e. the sum of the weights of those<br>
oligosaccharides with a DP of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10).<br>
According to a further embodiment at least one of the oligosaccharides of<br>
the present composition is selected from the group consisting of inulin,<br>
fructooligosaccharides, indigestible dextrins, galactooligosaccharides<br><br>
(including	transgalactooligosaccharides),	xylooligosaccharides,<br>
arabinooligosaccharides,	glucooligosaccharides,	mannooligo-<br>
saccharides, lacto-N-neotetraose, fucooligosaccharides (containing at<br>
least one fucose saccharide unit), acidic oligosaccharides (see below,<br>
e.g. uronic acid oligosaccharides such as pectin hydrolysate) and<br>
mixtures thereof.<br>
Preferably the present composition comprises at least one selected from<br>
the group consisting of inulins and fructooligosaccharides and at least<br>
one selected from the group consisting of galactooligosaccharides<br>
(including transgalactooligosaccharides) and pectin hydrolysate. In a<br>
particularly preferred embodiment, the present composition comprises 2<br>
to 12 grams oligosaccharides with a DP of 2 to 10 and piinked galactose<br>
and glucose saccharides, more preferably transgalactooligosaccharides<br>
(i.e. [gal]n -glu, wherein n is 2 to 10). In a particularly preferred<br>
embodiment,	the	present	composition	comprises<br>
transgalactooligosaccharides (i.e. [gal]n -glu, wherein n is 2 to 10), pectin<br>

Zinc<br>
Zinc is an essential micronutrient for growth and development of the<br>
immune function. Zinc deficiency impairs overall immune function and<br>
resistance to infection. Hence the present composition advantageously<br>
comprises zinc, preferably in an amount 2 to 100 mg zinc per 100 gram<br>
dry weight of the present composition, even more preferably at least 4-<br>
25 mg zinc per 100 g dry weight of the present composition. The weight<br>
of zinc is calculated as elementary zinc.<br>
Liquid<br>
The present composition is preferably in powder or liquid form or an<br>
tablet form, wherein said tablet has a weight between 5 and 25 grams.<br>
Preferably, the present composition is provided in powered form as this<br>
increases shelf life. The present composition is preferably administered<br>
orally in liquid form. Prior to the administration of the present<br>
composition, it is preferably admixed with a liquid, preferably water. As<br>
the liquid composition is preferably administered while having a<br>
temperature of 35-40°C (preferably about 37°C), the liquid formula is<br>
preferably prepared by:<br>
Process a: mixing water with a temperature below of 30°C and the<br>
composition according to any one of claims 1-10, in a weight ratio water:<br>
composition of 1-10:1; and heating the mixture obtained in step a) to a<br>
temperature between 35 and 50 °C; or<br>
Process b: mixing water with a temperature below of 60°C and the<br>
composition according to any one of claims 1-10, in a weight ratio water:<br>
composition of 1-10:1; and cooling the mixture obtained in step a) to a<br>
temperature between 35 and 40 °C. Process a) is more suitable for<br>
preparation of liquid formula from powder, while process b) is more<br>
suitable for preparing ta liquid formula from the tablet.<br>
Stool irregularities (e.g. hard stools, insufficient stool volume, diarrhea) is<br>
a major problem in many babies and ill subjects that receive liquid foods.<br><br>
It was found that stool problems may be reduced by administering the<br>
present composition in liquid form, having an osmolality between 50 and<br>
500 mOsm/kg, more preferably between 100 and 400 mOsm/kg, most<br>
preferably between 220 and 300 mOsm/kg.<br>
In view of the above diarrhea problem, it is also important that the liquid<br>
food does not have an excessive caloric density as this causes significant<br>
intestinal stress. However, the formula needs to provide sufficient<br>
calories to feed the infant. Hence, the liquid food preferably has a caloric<br>
density between 0.5 and 0.9 kcal/ml, preferably between 0.6 and 0.8<br>
kcal/ml.<br>

Experimental setup<br>
The effect of diets comprising acid oligosaccharides, optionally combined<br>
with neutral oligosaccharides were tested on the delayed-type<br>
hypersensitivity (DTH) response, which is a parameter for Th1<br>
immunological response and is determined by measuring the increase in<br>
ear swelling after local antigen challenge.<br>
Acid oligosaccharides (AcOl) used, with an average DP between 2 and 10, were<br>
obtained by the method described in WO 02/42484 (see example 1). Diets<br>
containing 1 wt.%, 2.5 wt.%, 5 wt.% and 10% wt.% AcOl based on total weight of<br>
the diet were tested. Neutral oligosaccharide mixture (GF) containing<br>
galactooligosaccharides (GOS) (Vivinal-GOS™ (Borculo Domo Ingredients,<br>
Netherlands) and fructooligosaccharides (FOS) (Raftiline HP™, Orafti, Tienen,<br>
Belgium) were used in a weight ratio GOS:FOS of 9:1. Diets containing 1, 2.5 and 5<br>
wt.% GF based on total weight of the diet were tested. The effects of a combination<br>
of acid and neutral oligosaccharides (GF and AcOl) was tested in a diet containing 1<br>
wt.% GF and 1 wt.% AcOl based on total weight of the diet.<br><br>
All data is presented as percentages relative to control values, i.e. the<br>
relative values of the oligosaccharide supplemented group compared to<br>
the group receiving the control diet (without oligosaccharides).<br>
Animals and diets<br>
Female, 6 weeks old C57BI/6 mice (Harlan Nederland BV, Horst, the<br>
Netherlands) were group-housed under a regular 12 hours light/dark<br>
regime. Group size was 10 animals per group and 3 animals in the<br>
negative control groups. The animals were given semi-synthetic diets<br>
(Research Diet Services, Wijk bij Duurstede, the Netherlands). Control<br>
diets were made to the AIN93G specifications (Reeves et al (1993)<br>
Development and Testing of the AIN93 purified diets for rodents: results<br>
on growth kidney calcification and bone mineralisation in rats and mice. J<br>
Nutrition 123(11): 1923-31), oligosaccharide supplemented diets were<br>
based on these specifications. Carbohydrate content of the supplemented<br>
diets were kept constant by the exchange of total carbohydrates for the<br>
oligosaccharides on a weight basis. The separate carbohydrate<br>
components were substituted respective to their normal ratio in the diet.<br>
The carbohydrates in the normal diet consist of cornstarch (40% of total<br>
weight), dextrinized cornstarch (13.2%), sucrose (10%) and cellulose<br>
(5%).<br>
Vaccination protocol<br>
Vaccinations were started after a period of two to four weeks of<br>
adaptation to the new housing and diets. At day 0, a blood sample was<br>
collected prior to vaccination. At day 1, the first vaccination was<br>
administered subcutaneously. After three weeks, a blood sample was<br>
collected (day 21) and a booster vaccination was given (day 22). Nine<br>
days after booster injection (day 31), basal ear thickness was measured<br>
with a Digimatic outside micrometer (Mitutoyo, Veenendaal, the<br>
Netherlands) and a delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response was<br><br>
induced by injecting antigen solution i.e. (intracutaneous) in the mouse<br>
ear pinnae. 24 h therafter (day 32), the DTH response was measured, a<br>
bloodsample was taken and the mice were sacrificed. Spleens were<br>
isolated and prepared for ex-vivo restimulations.<br>
The vaccinations consisted of a 100 µl i.e. (intracutaneous) injection of a<br>
1:1 mix of antigen solution and Stimune adjuvant (Specol, Cedi-<br>
diagnostics BV, Lelystad, the Netherlands). The antigen solution was a<br>
1:100 dilution of Influvac 2002/2003 (Solvay Pharmaceuticals, Weesp,<br>
the Netherlands) in PBS . Influvac is a trivalent protein vaccine,<br>
containing 3x30 pg/ml haemagglutinin of three different influenza strains.<br>
For the DTH responses, mice were i.e. injected with 25 µl dialysed<br>
Influvac in both ears as a DTH challenge.<br>
Cell cultures<br>
Splenocytes were isolated from the spleens using fine-mesh cell strainers<br>
(Becton Dickinson, Erembodegem, Belgium). Red blood cells were lysed<br>
by 5 minutes incubation on ice. After washing with culture medium<br>
without phenol red, cells were counted (Coulter Counter, Beckman<br>
Coulter, the Netherlands) and kept on ice. Cultures were set up using 0.1<br>
pg/ml dialysed Influvac as a stimulus. Cells were seeded in 96-well<br>
culture plates at 1*106 cells per well. The culture medium consisted of<br>
RPMI-1640 with HEPES buffer and 2 mM L-Glutamine (Invitrogen,<br>
Merelbeke, Belgium) with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Cultures were<br>
incubated for 5 days at 37°C at 5% CO2. Thereafter supernatants were<br>
harvested and frozen at -80°C until analysis. Cell proliferation was<br>
measured in parallel cultures by 3H-thymidine incorporation, which was<br>
added to the cultures for the last 18 hours at 0.4 µCu/well. After 5 days,<br>
the cells were harvested using a Filtermate harvester (Perkin Elmer,<br><br>
Zaventem, Belgium) and counted on a Micro-Beta counter (Perkin Elmer,<br>
Zaventem, Belgium). Radioactive decay was measured for 1 minute per<br>
well and the counts per minute (cpm) were recorded as a measure for<br>
proliferation speed.<br>
Cytokines were analysed in supernatants of Influvac stimulated cultures. IL-2, IL-5,<br>
IL-10 and IFN-gamma were measured using the Bio-Plex system with a custom<br>
mixed beadset for the cytokines mentioned (Bio-Rad, Veenendaal, the<br>
Netherlands). Cytokines were measured according to the manufacturer's<br>
specifications. IL-4 was measured by ELISA using the Pharmingen OptEIA mouse<br>
IL-4 kit (Becton Dickinson, Erembodegem, Belgium), according the manufacturer's<br>
specifications.<br>
Results<br>
DTH response acid oligosaccharides<br>
The diets containing dosages of 1 wt.%, 2.5 wt.% and 5 wt.% AcOl<br>
induced a statistically significant increase in the DTH response, showing<br>
a dose-dependent increase (see Table 1). The observed effect is<br>
indicative for the advantageous use of acid oligosaccharides in the<br>
present method.<br><br><br><br>

DTH response acid and neutral oligosaccharides<br>
The combination of 1 wt.% GF, 2.5 wt.% GF and the mixture of 1 wt.% GF<br>
and 1 wt.% AcOl induce a statistically significant increase in the DTH<br>
(see Table 2). The observed effect is indicative for the advantageous use<br>
of a indigestible oligosaccharides, particularly the combination of acid<br>
and neutral oligosaccharides in the present method.<br><br>
* indicates significantly different (P
 <br>
Influvac specific proliferation of acid oligosaccharides<br>
Administration of diets containing 2.5 wt% and 5 wt.% acid<br>
oligosaccharides (AcOl) induced a significant lowering effect on the<br>
influvac specific proliferation ex vivo (see Table 3). The observed effect<br>
is indicative for the advantageous use of acid oligosaccharides in the<br>
present method.<br>
Influvac specific proliferation of a combination of acid and neutral<br>
oligosaccharides<br>
Administration of a combination of 1 wt.% GF and 1 wt.% AcOl induced<br>
significant lowering effects on the antigen specific proliferation (see<br>
Table 3). As the effect is significantly improved over the DTH responses<br>
from diets containing the acid or neutral oligosaccharides alone, these<br>
results are indicative for the synergistic effect provided by the<br>
administration of acid and neutral oligosaccharides. The observed effect<br>
is indicative for the advantageous use of a combination of acid and<br>
neutral oligosaccharides in the present method. Reduced proliferation is<br>
indicative for the reduction of Th2 response, and the Th1/Th2 balancing<br>
effect of the present method.<br><br><br><br>

Th1/Th2 balance: Cytokine profiles after administration of acid<br>
oligosaccharides<br>
Cytokine profiles were measured in the culture supernatants of the<br>
influvac specific splenocytes. Data are presented as percentage relative<br>
to values of the vaccinated control group (i.e. receiving no<br>
oligosaccharides). Compared to controls, diets containing 2.5 wt.% and 5<br>
wt.% AcOl resulted in a decrease in the Th2-related cytokines IL-4 , IL-5<br>
and IL-10, while the Th1-related cytokines IL-2 was increased and IFN-y<br>
was not significantly lowered (see Table 4). These results are indicative<br>
for the Th1/Th2 balancing effect of acid oligosaccharides and indicative<br>
for the advantageous use of acid oligosaccharides in the present method,<br>
e.g. for the treatment and/or prevention of diseases with relatively low<br>
Th1 immunity.<br>
Th1/Th2 balance: Cytokine profiles after administration of acid and neutral<br>
oligosaccharides<br>
Compared to controls, administration of a combination of 1 wt.% GT and<br>
1 wt.% AcOl resulted in a decrease in the Th2-related cytokines IL-4, IL-<br>
5 and IL-10, while the Th1-related cytokines IL-2 and IFN-y were not<br>
lowered (see Table 4, wherein data are presented as percentage relative<br>
to values of the vaccinated control group (i.e. receiving no<br>
oligosaccharides)). These results are indicative for the Th1/Th2 balancing<br><br><br>

Th2/Th1 balance. In other words, a lower ratio is indicative for stimulation<br>
of Th1 and/or inhibition of Th2, and in any case indicative for the Th1-<br>

ABSTRACT<br><br>
The invention provides a nutritional or pharmaceutical composition containing a fat<br>
component, a protein component and a carbohydrate component and comprising whey<br>
and casin Said composition is characterized in that, the weight ration of casin to whey<br>
is 1:1 To 1:24 and that the composition contains: 1) at least 3 grams arginine per 100<br>
grams protein; b) at least 10 wt% linoleic acid based on total fatty acids; c) at least 1<br>
wt% alpha linolenic acid based on total fatty acids; d) at least one long chain<br>
polyunsaturated fatty acid in an amount exceeding 0.1 wt.% based on total fatty acids,<br>
said long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid being selected from the group consisting of<br>
docosahexaenoic acid, arachidonic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid; e) 5 to 25 wt.% of at<br>
least one polyunsaturated fatty acid based on total fatty acids; and f) 2 to 12 grams<br>
indigestible oligosaccharides having a degree of polymerization of 2 to 100 per 100 gram<br>
dry weight of the composition. The composition of the invention reduces among others<br>
the risks attached to feeding whey dominant infant formula.</td>
