cross member 6 and a second cross member 7 which extend in the leftward and rightward directions of the vehicle body, respectively. [0015]<br>
A body B made of a synthetic resin and supported on the frame F is formed from a leg shield front member 8 which covers a front face of the head pipe I, a leg shield rear member 9 coupled to a rear face of the leg shield front member 8 and covering a rear face of the head pipe 1, a step floor 10 connected to a lower end of the leg shield rear member 9, an under cover 11 connected to a lower end of the leg shield front member 8 and covering a lower face of the step floor 10, a rear cover 12 which covers a rear portion of the vehicle body, and a pair of left and right side covers 13, 13 extending from left and right front portions of the rear cover 12 to rear ends of the step floor 10 and the under cover 11. [0016]<br>
A front wheel Wf covered at an upper portion thereof with a front fender 15 is supported for rotation at a lower end of a front fork 14 which is supported for rotation on the head pipe 1. A central portion of a<br>
handlebar 18 in the leftward and rightward directions is coupled to an upper face of a handle post 17 which extends upwardly from an upper panel 16 which covers over an upper end opening of the leg shield front member 8 and the leg shield rear member 9. A head lamp 19 and a speedometer 20 are supported on the handle post 17, and a handle locking apparatus 21 having an ignition switch integrally thereon is supported on a right side face of the head pipe 1. [0017]<br>
A front end of a power unit P having a rear wheel Wr supported for rotation at a rear end thereof is supported for upward and downward rocking motion on the first cross member 6, and the power unit P and the second cross member 7 are connected to each other by a rear cushion 22. A seat 23 on which a rider is to be seated is provided on an upper face of the rear cover 12. [0018]<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, a pair of recessed portions 131, 131 which are recessed toward the inner side of the vehicle body are formed on the left and right side covers 13, 13, and a pair of auxiliary steps 31, 31 for a pillion rider extend toward the outside of the vehicle body through<br>
openings 132, 132 formed at the centers of the recessed portions 13i, 13i. The auxiliary steps 31, 31 are supported on the vehicle body in the following manner. In particular, a pair of step stays 33, 33 are secured by means of bolts 34, ... to power unit supporting brackets 32, 32 welded to the left and right main frames 4, 4, and the opposite left and right ends of a step bar 35 which is disposed in the leftward and rightward directions of the vehicle body are welded to the step stays 33, 33 to reinforce them. Then, the auxiliary steps 31, 31 described above are secured to the left and right step stays 33, 33 and the opposite left and right ends of the step bar 35. [0019]<br>
Subsequently, the structure of an intake system of the power unit P will be described with reference to FIGS. 3 to 6. [0020]<br>
An air cleaner 37 is supported on an upper face of a transmission case 30 of the power unit P by a bolt 36. A rear end of an air intake duct 38 which extends forwardly of the vehicle body is connected to an entrance portion 371 of the air cleaner 37, and a front end of the air intake<br>
duct 38 is connected to an intake air chamber 40 secured to an inner face of the side cover 13 on the left side of the vehicle body via a boot 39 made of rubber and formed like bellows. Meanwhile, an exit portion 372 of the air cleaner 37 is connected to a crankcase of an engine E via a carburetor 41 and an intake air pipe 42. [0021]<br>
The intake air chamber 40 made of a synthetic resin is divided into two parts of an upper half 51 and a lower half 52, and the upper half 51 and the lower half 52 are coupled integrally to each other by engaging a plurality of projections 513, ... formed on the upper half 51 with a<br>
plurality of engaging holes 523 formed on the lower half 52 in a condition wherein an outer periphery of the upper half 51 is fitted with an inner periphery of the lower half 52. Mounting brackets 514 514 are provided projectingly at a front portion and a rear portion of the upper half 51, and the intake air chamber 40 is secured to the inner face of the side cover 13 by screwing screws 43, 43, which extend through the mounting brackets 514, 514, into hub portions 133, 133 formed on the inner face of the side cover 13. While the securing portion by the mounting bracket 514 at<br>
the rear portion is shown in FIG. 5, also the securing portion by the mounting bracket 514 at the front portion has a similar structure. [0022]<br>
The upper half 51 has, at an upper portion thereof, an exit opening 511 which is opened rearwardly, and has, at a lower portion thereof, a communication hole 512 which is opened downwardly. Meanwhile, the lower half 52 has, at a side portion thereof, an entrance opening 521. which is opened leftwardly, and has, at a lower portion thereof, a pressure discharging opening 522 which is opened downwardly. As can be seen apparently from FIG. 6, the height of the communication hole 512 is disposed at a<br>
position lower by a distance a from the height of a lower end of the entrance opening 52j. Meanwhile, the pressure discharging opening 522 is formed such that the area thereof is smaller than the area of the entrance opening 52 j and the area of the communication hole 512. [0023],<br>
When the intake air chamber 40 is mounted on the side cover: 13, the entrance opening 52a thereof is opposed<br>
to a rear portion of the opening 132 of the side cover 13,<br>
and a front end of the boot 39 is fitted with the upper half 51 and the intake air chamber 40 is secured to the side cover 13 by a band 44. As can be seen apparently from FIG. 2, since the opening 132 of the side cover 13 is utilized not only for introduction of intake air but also for extension of the auxiliary step 31 to the outside of<br>
the side cover 13, the number of the openings 132 can be<br>
i<br>
suppressed to a minimum number to secure the strength of the side cover 13 and eliminate deterioration of the beautiful appearance. [0024]<br>
The air intake duct 38 is molded as a unitary member from a synthetic resin, and a rear end thereof is force fitted in and secured to the entrance portion 371 of the air cleaner 37 while a tubular portion 381 provided at a front end of the air intake duct 38 is force fitted in a rear end of the boot 39 and fitted loosely in the inside of the boot 39. Further, a hanger 47 secured to the intake air pipe 42 by two bolts 46, 46 has a tongue 471 extending in a transverse direction of the vehicle body, and an intermediate portion of the air intake duct 38 in the forward and backward directions is suspended and supported<br>
by arresting the tongue 401 in a slit 382 formed in the air intake duct 38. A resonator 48 is provided at an upper portion of the air intake duct 38 in order to reduce noise by intake air, and an annular flange 383 is formed integrally on the tubular portion 381 in order to intercept<br>
mud or water splashed by the rear wheel Wr. [0025]<br>
The exit portion 372 of the air cleaner 37 and the carburetor 41 are fitted with each other and fastened to each other by a band 45. Further, the carburetor 41 and the intake air pipe 42 are fastened together with each other to the intake air pipe 42 by the two bolts 46, 46 for securing the hanger 47. And, the intake air pipe 42 is secured to the engine E by four bolts 49, ... [0026]<br>
Subsequently, operation of the embodiment of the present invention having the construction described above will be described. [0027]<br>
Intake air taken into a lower chamber 54 through the entrance opening 521 of the intake air chamber 40 opposed to the opening 132 of the side cover 13 flows from<br>
the communication hole 512 into an upper chamber 53 as indicated by an arrow mark a in FIG. 6, and is supplied from there to the air cleaner 37 via the exit opening 511 and the air intake duct 38. The intake air cleaned by the air cleaner 37 is mixed with fuel by the carburetor 41 and then supplied to the engine E via the intake air pipe 42. [0028]<br>
In this instance, the opening 132 of the side cover 13 to which the intake air chamber 40 is opposed is positioned such that the front thereof is covered by the leg shield front member 8 and the leg shield rear member 9 and the lower portion thereof is covered by the step floor 10, the amount of mud or water splashed by the front wheel Wf or the rear wheel Wr and sucked into the intake air chamber 40 can be suppressed to the minimum. Besides, since the air flow path between the entrance opening 521 and the exit opening 511 has a configuration like a labyrinth and besides the entrance opening 521 is provided at a position lower than the exit opening 511, dust or the like included in intake air can be dropped to a bottom portion of the intake air chamber 40 by the weight of it while only clean intake air can be supplied to the engine<br>
E. [0029]<br>
Further/ if a strong transverse wind coming to the side cover 13 blows into the lower chamber 54 of the intake air chamber 40 through the entrance opening 521, then since the height of the communication hole 512 is disposed at a position lower than the height of the lower end of the entrance opening 521, the pressures in the inside of the upper chamber 53 and the air intake duct 38 connected to the upper chamber 53 can be prevented from varying suddenly, and stable operation of the engine E can be maintained. In this instance, since the air flowing into the lower chamber 54 is escaped to the outside of the intake air chamber 40 through the pressure discharging opening 522 as indicated by an arrow mark c in FIG. 6, a sudden variation in pressure of the intake system can be prevented further effectively. [0030]It is to be noted that, in an ordinary state wherein a strong transverse wind is not received by the entrance opening 521, most air is taken into the lower chamber 54 as indicated by the arrow mark a through the<br>
entrance opening 521, but the amount of air taken in through the pressure discharging opening 522 as indicated by an arrow mark b is small. Consequently, dust or the like splashed by the rear wheel Wr is prevented from being taken into the rear cover 12 or the side cover 13 through the pressure discharging opening 522. This is because, since the pressure discharging opening 522 is formed such that the area thereof is smaller than the area of the entrance opening 52 j and the distance between the entrance opening 521 and the communication hole 512 is shorter than the distance between the pressure discharging opening 522 and the communication hole 512,the circulation resistance to air taken in through the entrance opening 521 is lower than the circulation resistance of air taken in through the pressure discharging opening 522. [0031]<br>
Further, since the air intake duct 38 which connects the intake air chamber 40 to the air cleaner 37 is formed so that it has a very short overall length and is disposed substantially in a straight condition in the forward and backward directions of the vehicle body without having a sharp bent portion, the intake resistance of the<br>
air intake duct 38 to intake air can be minimized to increase the output power of the engine E. Furthermore, the temperature of the intake air can be lowered to increase the output power of the engine E by taking in air on the outside of the body B whose temperature has not been raised by the heat of the engine E. [0032]<br>
When the power unit P supported for pivotal motion on the vehicle body is rocked upwardly and downwardly as the scooter type motorcycle V runs, relative motion between the air intake duct 38 which is rocked upwardly and downwardly integrally with the power unit P and the intake air chamber 40 secured to the vehicle body side is absorbed by resilient deformation of the boot 39 which interconnects the air intake duct 38 and the intake air chamber 40. [0033]<br>
FIGS. 7 and 8 show a second embodiment of the present invention, and FIG. 7 is a side elevational view of an intake air chamber and FIG. 8 is a sectional view taken along line 8-8 of FIG. 7. [0034]<br>
An intake air chamber 40 in the second embodiment<br>
is composed of an intake air chamber body 55 and a pipe member 56, and the intake air chamber body 55 is secured to an inner face of a side cover 13 by two mounting brackets 551, 551. A lower portion of the pipe member 56 bent in an L-shape extends downwardly in the inside of the intake air chamber body 55, and an upper portion of the pipe member 56 extends rearwardly upwardly through an exit opening 552 formed in a rear wall of the intake air chamber body 55 and is connected to a tubular portion 381 of an air intake duct 38 through a boot 39. [0035]<br>
An entrance opening 553 formed in a side face of a lower portion of the intake air chamber body 55 is opposed to an opening 132 of the side cover 13, and a lower end of the pipe member 56 which is opened in the proximity of a lower end of a central portion of the entrance opening 553<br>
is disposed lower by a distance a than the lower end of the central portion of the entrance opening 553. Meanwhile, a pressure discharging opening 554 is formed at an upper end of the intake air chamber body 55, and a draining opening 55s is formed at a lower end of the intake air chamber body 55.<br>
[0036]<br>
Thus, since the entrance opening 553 is located at<br>
a position lower than the exit opening 552, naturally dust or the like included in intake air can be dropped to a bottom portion of the intake air chamber 40 by the weight of it while only clean intake air can be supplied to the engine E. Further, even if a strong transverse blows into the intake air chamber 40 through the entrance opening 553/ since the height of the lower end of the pipe member 56 is disposed at a position lower than the lower end of the central portion of the entrance opening 553, the pressure in the air intake duct 38 can be prevented from varying suddenly, and stable operation of the engine E can be maintained. Further, since the air flowing into the intake air chamber body 55 is escaped to the outside through the pressure discharging opening 554, a sudden variation in pressure of the intake system can be prevented further effectively. Furthermore, water accumulated on the bottom portion of the intake air chamber body 55 is discharged to he outside through the draining opening 55s. Besides, since the intake air chamber 40 is reduced in upward and downward dimension comparing with the intake air chamber 40<br>
in the first embodiment, the minimum height of the intake air chamber 40 above the ground can be increased. [0037]<br>
While the embodiments of the present invention are described in detail above, the present invention can be modified in various forms without departing from the subject matter of it. [0038]<br>
For example, while, in the embodiment, the intake air chamber 40 and the side cover 13 are formed from separate members, they may be formed from a single member. Further, while, in the embodiment, the opening 13i is formed in the side cover 13, it may be formed in some other arbitrary body cover. [0039]<br>
[Effects of the Invention]<br>
As described above, according to the invention recited in claim 1, since an opening is formed in a body cover which covers over a side portion of the vehicle body rearwafdly of a step floor below a seat and the air intake duct is connected to an intake air chamber provided on an inner face of the body cover in such a manner as to be<br>
opposed to the opening, the air intake duct which interconnects the air cleaner located above a transmission case of a power unit and the intake air chamber can be disposed linearly with a minimum distance, and the resistance to intake air can be reduced to increase the output power of an engine. Besides, since the opening of the body cover opposed to the intake air chamber is provided rearwardly of the step floor below the seat, not only it is made difficult for the opening to admit dust or muddy water splashed by the front wheel or the rear wheel, but also air of a low temperature which has not been heated by the engine can be taken in to increase the output power of the engine. [0040]<br>
Meanwhile, according to the invention set forth in claim 2, since the intake air chamber has an entrance opening provided at a side portion thereof and an exit opening provided at an upper portion thereof and the entrance opening is opposed to the opening of the body cover while the exit opening is connected to the air intake duct, dust or the like included in air taken into the intake air chamber can be dropped to a bottom portion of<br>
the intake air chamber and consequently can be prevented<br>
from being admitted into the air cleaner.<br>
[0041]<br>
Meanwhile, according to the invention set forth in claim 3, since the intake air chamber is partitioned into a lower chamber provided with the entrance opening and an upper chamber provided with the exit opening and a communication hole for communicating the lower chamber and the upper chamber with each other is disposed at a position lower than a lower end of the entrance opening of the intake air chamber, a sudden variation in pressure in an air intake system can be prevented when a strong transverse wind blows to the opening of the body cover. [0042]<br>
Meanwhile, according to the invention set forth in claim 4, since a pressure discharging opening is provided at a lower portion of the lower chamber, when a transverse wind acts upon the opening of the body cover, the pressure in the lower chamber can be escaped through the pressure discharging opening thereby to prevent a sudden variation in pressure in the air intake system further effectively. [0043]<br>
Meanwhile, according to the invention set forth in claim 5, since the intake air chamber includes an intake air chamber body and a pipe member connected at an upper end thereof to the air intake duct and opened at a lower end thereof in the intake air chamber body and the lower end opening of the pipe member is disposed at a position lower than a lower end of the entrance opening of the intake air chamber, when a strong transverse wind acts upon the opening of the body cover, a sudden variation of the pressure in the air intake system can be prevented. [0044]<br>
Meanwhile, according to the invention set forth in claim 6, since a pressure discharging opening is provided at an upper portion of the intake air chamber body while a draining opening is provided at a lower portion of the intake air chamber body, not only the pressure in the intake air chamber body can be escaped to the outside through the pressure discharging opening to prevent a sudden variation in pressure of the intake system further effectively, but also water accumulated in the intake air chamber body can be discharged to the outside through the draining opening.<br>
[0045]<br>
Meanwhile, according to the invention set forth in claim 7, since an auxiliary step for a pillion rider extends outwardly of the body cover through the opening of the body cover, there is no necessity for forming a special opening for the auxiliary step, and consequently, the strength of the body cover can be raised and the beautiful appearance can be augmented.<br><br>
