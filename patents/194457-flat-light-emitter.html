Technical Field<br>
The invention relates to a flat radiator.<br>
At issue here, in particular, are flat radiators as described in EP 0 363 832 and in DE-A 195 26 211. Such radiators have at least one electrode separated from the discharge chamber of the radiator by dielectric material. Such electrodes are also designated as "dielectric electrodes" below for short<br>
The designation "flat radiator" is understood here to mean radiators having a flat geometry and which emit light that is to say visible electromagnetic radiation, or ultraviolet (UV) or vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) radiation<br>
Depending on the spectrum of the emitted radiation, such radiation sources are suitable for general and auxiliary lighting, for example home and office lighting or background lighting of displays, for example LCDs (Liquid Crystal Displays), for traffic lighting and signal lighting, for UV irradiation, for example sterilization or photolysis.<br>
Prior Art<br>
EP 0 363 832 discloses an UV high-power radiator having elongated electrodes connected in pairs to me two terminals of a high-voltage source. In this case, the electrodes are separated from one another and from the discharge chamber of the radiator by dielectric material. Furthermore, the elongated electrodes are arranged alternately next to one another with different polarity (anodes and cathodes), it being possible in this way to realize planar-like discharge configurations with relatively flat discharge vessels<br>
WO 94/23442 discloses a method for operating an incoherently emitting radiation source, in particular a discharge lamp, by means of dielectrically impeded discharge The operating method provides for a sequence of voltage pulses, the individual voltage pulses<br><br>
-2-<br>
being separated from one another by dead tunes. Here, in the case of unipolar pulses a multiplicity of individual delta-shaped discharges lined up along the elongated electrodes are formed. The advantage of this pulsed mode of operation is a high efficiency in the generation of radiation.<br>
If, now, the method of WO 94/23442 is applied to the flat radiator of EP 0 363 832 - as already described in DE-A 195 26 211 5 -, it is found that the individual discharges are formed only between the anodes and one of the two respectively directly neighbouring cathodes It cannot be predicted by which of the two neighbouring cathodes the discharges will be formed in each case Discharges which burn from neighbouring cathode strips onto one and the same anode are not observed Referring to the flat radiator as a whole this results in a non-uniform discharge structure A further disadvantage is the fact that the power density is limited by the phenomenon outlined.<br>
Representation of the Invention<br>
ft is the object of the present invention to eliminate the said disadvantages and to provide a flat radiator and having an increased power density and improved luminance distribution.<br>
This object is achieved by means of the characterizing features of the invention<br>
Starting from the prior art, the invention proposes the separation into in each case two anodes of those anodes which have equally spaced cathodes as direct neighbours. In other words, an additionally anode is arranged between each such cathode pair.<br>
Reference is made to Figures 1 and 2 for the further explanation of this inventive principle. By way of example, one section each of a flat radiator according to the invention and of a conventional one are represented diagrammatically. For the sake of simplicity and clarity, the lengths of the electrodes are limited approximately to the extent<br><br>
-3-<br>
of a delta shaped individual discharge In a concrete design of a flat radiator, the electrodes are typically much longer, with the result that during operation a multiplicity of individual discharges burn along electrodes However, the length of the electrodes does not play a decisive role in explaining the inventive principle Figures 1 and 2 represent, as it were, in principle the conditions per unit of length of the electrodes.<br>
According to the invention, an anode pair A , A is arranged between at least one, preferably between each cathode pair K 1, K 1+1,i = 1, 2, ... n and n denotes the number of cathodes (in Figures 1 and 2, n = 4 is selected, for example). As a result of this measure, each anode A;, A ,' have at most one cathode K, or Ki+1, respectively, as a direct neighbour<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
Consequently - assuming sufficient electric input power - during operation the individual discharges i, 1' form from each anode Ai., A1' to the respectively directly neighbouring cathode K1 and K1+1, respectively. The disadvantage of the prior art, specifically that individual discharges burn at most to one of two neighbouring cathodes (compare Figure 2) is thereby avoided.<br>
Whereas in the example of Figure 1 with four cathodes K1-K4 it is possible according to the invention assuming an adequate electric input power - to achieve a total of up to six individual discharges 1,1'-3,3' per unit of length of the electrodes, in the case of a comparable arrangement in accordance with the prior art (see Figure 2) the figure is only four individual discharges 1-4. Moreover, the arrangement according to Figure 2 has the disadvantage, already mentioned, that it is not possible to predict to which of the neighbouring cathodes Kl, K1+1 the discharge l will ignite. Figure 2 thus shows only one of a plurality of possible discharge structures.<br>
The mutual spacing of each anode pair A1,,	A1' is smaller<br>
than the spacing between a respective anode A1 or A1' and a directly neighbouring cathode K1 or K1+1, respectively. The area between the anode pairs which cannot be used for the discharge is thereby kept relatively small. A favourable value for the mutual spacing is the approximate width of the anode strips.<br>
In one embodiment, the two anodes A1 , A1' are constructed as a fork-shaped double anode. For this purpose, the double anode has a respectively elongated first and second region, which are arranged at a predetermined spacing from one another. The first and the second region are connected to one another by a third region to form a unit.<br><br>

Description of the Accompanying Drawings<br>
The invention is to be explained below in more detail with the aid of an exemplary embodiment In the drawings:<br>
Figure 1 shows a diagrammatic representation of the principle of the invention,<br>
Figure 2 shows a diagrammatic representation of the principle of the prior art,<br>
Figure 3a shows a diagrammatic representation of the top view of an exemplary embodiment of a flat radiator according to the invention, and<br>
Figure 3b shows a diagrammatic representation of the cross-section of the flat radiator of Figure 3a.<br>
Figures 3a, 3b respectively show, in a diagrammatic representation, a top view and a cross-section along the line BB of a UV/VUV flat radiator 4, that is to say a flat "discharge lamp", which is designed for the efficient emission of UV or VUV radiation, respectively. The flat radiator 4 comprises a flat discharge vessel 5 with a rectangular base face, four strip-shaped metallic cathodes 6 (-) and three elongated, fork-shaped double anodes 7 (+). The discharge vessel 5 comprises, for its part, a rectangular base plate 8 and a trough-like cover 9 (not represented in Figure 3a), both made from glass. The base plate 8 and the cover 9 are connected to one another in a gas-tight fashion in the region of their circumferential edges, and thus enclose the gas filling of the flat radiator 4. The gas filling consists of xenon with a filling pressure of 10 kPa. The double anodes 7 respectively comprise two mutually parallel strips 7a, 7b, which are combined at one of their ends to form a common broad strip 7c. The length of the third region (7c) is shorter than approximately a tenth of the length of the first region (7a) or of the second region (7b). The cathodes 6 and double anodes 7 are mounted parallel to one another on the<br><br>
-6-<br>
inner wall of the base plate 8. The wide end strips 7c of the double anodes 7 and the ends of the cathodes 6 are guided outwards in a gas-tight fashion from the discharge vessel 5 and serve there as terminals for a voltage source. By contrast with the cathodes 6, the double anodes 7 are covered completely in each case inside the discharge vessel 5 by a dielectric material such as glass layer 10 whose thickness is approximately 150 µm. The respective spacing d between the cathode 6 and the directly neighbouring strip 7a or 7b of the double anode 7 is approximately 10 mm. The mutual spacing (g) is in the region between approximately half the width and double the width of the anodes of the two parallel strips 7a, 7b is approximately 3 mm. A multiplicity of individual discharges (not represented in Figures 3a, 3b) form during operation by means of unipolar voltage pulses. These individual discharges burn between the respective cathode 6 and the corresponding directly neighbouring strip 7a or 7b, respectively, of the associated double anode 7. By comparison with arrangements without a double anode (and the same geometrically dimensions of the discharge vessel) which have been used previously, the gain achieved in power density which can be injected is nearly 75%.<br>
In one variant (not represented), the inner wall of the discharge vessel is coated completely with a fluorescent material or mixture of fluorescent materials, which converts the UV/VUV radiation generated by the discharge into visible light Further more, one light-reflecting layer each made from Al2O3 or TiO2, respectively, is applied to the inner wall of the base plate. They serve to increase the luminous density on the top side of the radiator. This variant is a flat fluorescent lamp which is suitable for general lighting or background lighting of displays, for example LCD (Liquid Crystal Display).<br><br>
