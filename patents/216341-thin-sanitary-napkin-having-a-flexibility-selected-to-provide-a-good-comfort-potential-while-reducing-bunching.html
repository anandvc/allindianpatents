				<td>Thin Sanitary Napkin Having A Flexibility Selected To Provide A Good<br>
Comfort Potential While Reducing Bunching<br>
Field Of The Invention<br>
The present invention relates to the art of manufacturing structures for<br>
absorbing body exudate, more particularly to a sanitary napkin that is thin,<br>
absorbent and has a flexibility selected to provide a good comfort potential<br>
and at the same time reduce the likelihood, of uncontrolled deformation in<br>
use.<br>
Background Of The Invention<br>
In the past recent years, the sanitary protection industry has<br>
developed improved sanitary napkins that are highly absorbent and at the<br>
same time they are thin which significantly enhances their comfort potential.<br>
The conventional wisdom dictates that the comfort potential of the sanitary<br>
napkin is directly related to its flexibility, in particular the flexibility in the<br>
lateral direction. Hence, in order to improve the comfort, sanitary napkin<br>
designers have almost universally tried to create a product which is as<br>
flexible as possible. The idea behind this approach is that the flexible<br>
product will create less discomfort to the user particularly when the sanitary<br>
napkin is compressed between the thighs of the wearer.<br>
However, sanitary napkins that are highly flexible are known to suffer<br>
from high failure rates. This can be traced to the inability of the sanitary<br>
napkin to maintain firm contact with the vaginal opening of the user. As a<br>
consequence, the menstrual fluid discharged from the vaginal opening<br>
cannot be captured immediately into the sanitary napkin and leakage that<br>
can stain the user" undergarment may occur. This is somewhat paradoxical<br>
since a sanitary napkin that is highly flexible should, at least in theory adapt <br>
well to the anatomy of the user and maintain the condition of close contact <br>
against the skin even when the user is moving or performing another <br>
physical activity.<br>
However, studies have demonstrated that sanitary napkins that are<br>
highly flexible when in place in the crotch, portion of the user and when<br>
compressed by the user"s thighs deform laterally according to a random or<br>
uncontrolled manner. This results into the so-called "bunching" problem. A<br>
sanitary napkin that bunches is compressed in a way to significantly reduce<br>
its fluid absorption area and prevent close conformation with the vaginal<br>
opening. This may explain the high incidence of failure rates observed in<br>
connection with sanitary napkins that are very flexible.<br>
One possible manner to increase the lateral rigidity of a sanitary<br>
napkin that is taught by the prior art is to calendar the napkin between a pair<br>
of rolls. This operation stiffens the entire product by the effect of<br>
compaction. A drawback of this operation, however, is to negatively affect<br>
the absorption capacity of the sanitary napkin. The compaction effectively<br>
reduces the amount of void volume in the absorptive layers of the sanitary<br>
napkin, thus reducing its ability to store liquid.<br>
Thus, there exists in the industry a need to provide a sanitary napkin<br>
that is thin, highly absorbent and has good comfort potential and at the same<br>
time is capable of reducing the incidence of bunching in use.<br>
Summary Of The Invention<br>
The present invention provides a sanitary napkin that has a thickness<br>
less than about 5 mm, a test capacity of more than about 8 g, a total<br>
capacity of more than about 14 g and a flexural resistance in the range from<br>
about 400g to about 800g. This sanitary napkin has excellent absorption<br>
characteristics and at the same time reduces the incidence of bunching.<br>
These two characteristics contribute to provide a sanitary napkin that<br>
reduces the likelihood of failures.<br>
In a specific example, the sanitary napkin according to the invention <br>
has a cover layer, an absorbent system underneath the cover layer and a<br>
barrier layer underneath the absorbent system. The absorbent system is<br>
preferably a two-layer structure and includes a first absorbent layer and a<br>
second absorbent layer. The. second absorbent layer includes a blend of<br>
celluosic fibres and superabsorbent material. In a very specific<br>
embodiment, the second absorbent layer has been air-laid as a bottom layer<br>
of pulp, a middle layer of pulp and superabsorbent disposed in amongst the<br>
pulp and a top layer containing at least some pulp. <br>
Other aspects and features of the present invention will become<br>
apparent to those ordinarily skilled in the art upon review of the following<br>
description of specific embodiments of the invention in conjunction with the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
Referring to Figures 1 and 2, there is shown an embodiment of the<br>
present invention, a feminine sanitary napkin 20.<br>
The sanitary napkin 20 has a main body 22 with a first transverse side<br>
26 defining a front portion thereof and a second transverse side 28 defining<br>
a rear portion thereof. Each of these sides is arcuate or of any other suitable<br>
shape. The main body also has two longitudinal sides, namely a longitudinal<br>
side 30 and a longitudinal side 32. The sanitary napkin 20 has a thickness<br>
not exceeding about 5 mm. Preferably, the thickness is less than 3 mm and<br>
more preferably is less than 2 mm. In one particular preferred embodiment,<br>
the sanitary napkin 20 has a thickness of about 2.8 mm.<br>
The sanitary napkin 20 has a longitudinal centerline 34 that is an<br>
imaginary line bisecting the sanitary napkin 20 in two identical halves.<br>
The sanitary napkin 20 shown in the drawings has flaps 38, 40. The<br>
flaps 38, 40 project laterally outward from each of the longitudinal sides 30,<br>
32. The flaps 38, 40 are in the shape of an isosceles trapezoid with the top<br>
adjoining the longitudinal side and the base at the distal end. This is an<br>
example only as other flap shapes can also be used without departing from<br>
the spirit of the invention. Furthermore, the present invention is not limited to<br>
a sanitary napkin with flaps as the present inventive concept can also be<br>
embodied in a sanitary napkin without flaps.<br>
The main body 22 also has an imaginary transverse centerline 36<br>
perpendicular to the longitudinal centerline 34 and simultaneously bisecting<br>
the flaps 38,40.<br>
As depicted in Figure 4, the main body 22 is of a laminate<br>
construction and preferably comprises a fluid-permeable cover layer 42, an<br>
absorbent system 44, and a fluid-impervious barrier layer 50. The absorbent<br>
system has preferably two components, namely a first absorbent layer 46<br>
(commonly known as "transfer layer") and a second absorbent layer 48<br>
(commonly known as "absorbent core"). Alternatively, a single layer, namely<br>
the second absorbent layer 48, can form the absorbent system 44. Each of<br>
these layers is described hereinbelow.<br>
Main Body-Cover Layer<br>
The cover layer 42 may be a relatively low density, bulky, high-loft<br>
non-woven web material. The cover layer 42 may be composed of only one<br>
type of fiber, such as polyester or polypropylene or it may be composed of<br>
bi-component or conjugate fibers having a low melting point component and<br>
a high melting point component. The fibers may be selected from a variety of<br>
natural and synthetic materials such as nylon, polyester, rayon (in<br>
combination with other fibers), cotton, acrylic fiber and the like and<br>
combinations thereof. An example is the non-woven cover layer of sanitary<br>
napkins sold by Johnson &amp; Johnson Inc. of Montreal, Canada under the<br>
trademark Stayfree Ultra-Thin Cottony Dry Cover.<br>
Bi-component fibers may be made up of a polyester core and a<br>
polyethylene sheath. The use of appropriate bi-component materials results<br>
in a fusible non-woven fabric. Examples of such fusible fabrics are described<br>
in U.S. Patent 4,555,446 issued November 50, 1985 to Mays. Using a fusible<br>
fabric increases the ease with which the cover layer may be mounted to the<br>
adjacent first absorbent layer and/or to the barrier layer.<br>
The cover layer 42 preferably has a relatively high degree of<br>
wettability, although the individual fibers comprising the cover may not be<br>
particularly hydrophilic. The cover material should also contain a great<br>
number of relatively large pores. This is because the cover layer 42 is<br>
intended to take-up body fluid rapidly and transport it away from the body<br>
and the point of deposition. Advantageously, the fibers which make up the<br>
cover layer 42 should not lose their physical properties when they are<br>
wetted, in other words they should not collapse or lose their resiliency when<br>
subjected to water or body fluid. The cover layer 42 may be treated to allow<br>
fluid to pass through it readily. The cover layer 42 also functions to transfer<br>
the fluid quickly to the other layers of the absorbent system 44. Thus, the<br>
cover layer 42 is advantageously wettable, hydrophilic and porous. When<br>
composed of synthetic hydrophobic fibers such as polypropylene or bicomponent <br>
fibers, the cover layer 42 may be treated with a surfactant to<br>
impart the desired degree of wettability<br>
Alternatively, the cover layer 42 can also be made of polymer film<br>
having large pores. Because of such high porosity, the film accomplishes the<br>
function of quickly transferring body fluid to the inner layers of the absorbent<br>
system. Apertured co-extruded films such as described in U.S. Patent<br>
4,690,679 and available on sanitary napkins sold by Johnson &amp; Johnson Inc.<br>
of Montreal, Canada could be useful as cover layers in the present invention.<br>
The cover layer 42 may be embossed to the remainder of the<br>
absorbent system 44 in order to aid in promoting fluid transport by fusing the<br>
cover to the next layer. Such fusion may be effected locally, at a plurality of<br>
sites or over the entire contact surface of cover layer 42 with absorbent<br>
system 44. Alternatively, the cover layer 42 may be attached to the<br>
absorbent system 44 by other means such as by adhesive.<br>
Main Body-Absorbent System -First Absorbent Laver<br>
Adjacent to the cover layer 42 on its inner side and bonded to the<br>
cover layer 42 is a first absorbent layer 46 that forms part of the absorbent<br>
system 44. The first absorbent layer 46 provides the means of receiving<br>
body fluid from the cover layer 42 and holding it until an underlying second<br>
absorbent layer has an opportunity to absorb the fluid.<br>
The first absorbent layer 46 is, preferably, more dense than and has a<br>
larger proportion of smaller pores than the cover layer 42. These attributes<br>
allow the first absorbent layer 46 to contain body fluid and hold it away from<br>
the outer side of the cover layer 42, thereby preventing the fluid from rewetting <br>
the cover layer 42 and its surface. However, the first absorbent layer<br>
46 is, preferably, not so dense as to prevent the passage of the fluid through<br>
the layer 46 into the underlying second absorbent layer 48. These types of<br>
absorbent layers are commonly known as fluid transfer layers or acquisition<br>
layers.<br>
The first absorbent layer 46 may be composed of fibrous materials,<br>
such as wood pulp, polyester, rayon, flexible foam, or the like, or<br>
combinations thereof. The first absorbent layer 46 may also comprise<br>
thermoplastic fibers for the purpose of stabilizing the layer and maintaining<br>
its structural integrity. The first absorbent layer 46 may be treated with<br>
surfactant on one or both sides in order to increase its wettability, although<br>
generally the first absorbent layer 46 is relatively hydrophilic and may not<br>
require treatment/The first absorbent layer 46 is preferably bonded on both<br>
sides to the adjacent layers, i.e. the cover layer 42 and an underlying second<br>
absorbent layer 48. An example of a suitable first absorbent layer is a<br>
through air bonded pulp sold by BUCKEYE of Memphis Tennessee under<br>
the designation VIZORB 3008. <br>
Main Body - Absorbent System—Second Absorbent Layer<br>
Immediately adjacent to and bonded to the first absorbent layer 46 is<br>
the second absorbent layer 48.<br>
In one embodiment, the first absorbent layer 46 has a central width<br>
that is at least about the same as the central width of the second absorbent<br>
layer 48. In a specific embodiment, this central width is greater than about<br>
64mm. In another embodiment, the first absorbent layer 46 has a central<br>
width that exceeds the central width of the second absorbent layer 48. The<br>
term "central width" refers to a specific area of a layer, such as an absorbent<br>
layer determinable as follows. A reference point on the sample layer that is<br>
disposed beneath the center of the vaginal orifice, when worn, is located. A<br>
plane parallel to the transverse centerline 36 and 3.75 centimeters forward<br>
from the reference point in the direction of the wearer"s mons pubis is<br>
located. Another plane parallel to the lateral centerline 36 and 5.0<br>
centimeters rearward from the reference point in the direction of the wearer"s<br>
buttocks is also located. The greatest flat-out, uncompressed,<br>
unmanipulated, lateral width of the sample layer between the two planes is<br>
the absorbent width of the sample layer.<br>
The central width of the absorbent system, when the absorbent<br>
system includes a plurality of absorbent layers is the central width of the<br>
layer of the absorbent system that has the largest central width. In a<br>
specific example, the central width of the absorbent system exceeds 64 mm.<br>
In one embodiment, the second absorbent layer 48 is a blend or<br>
mixture of cellulosic fibers-and-superabsorbent.<br>
In a specific example, the second absorbent layer 48 is a material<br>
containing from about 40 weight percent to about 95 weight percent<br>
cellulosic fibers; and from about 5 weight percent to about 60 weight percent<br>
SAP (superabsorbent polymers). The material has a water content of less<br>
than about 10 weight percent. As used herein, the phrase "weight percent"<br>
means weight of substance per weight of final material. By way of example,<br>
10 weight percent SAP means 10 g/m2 SAP per 100g/m2 basis weight of the<br>
material.<br>
Cellulosic fibers that can be used in the second absorbent layer 48<br>
are well known in the art and include wood pulp, cotton, flax and peat moss.<br>
Wood pulp is preferred. Pulps can be obtained from mechanical or chemi-<br>
mechanical, sulfite, kraft, pulping reject materials, organic solvent pulps, etc.<br>
Both softwood and hardwood species are useful. Softwood pulps are<br>
preferred. It is not necessary to treat cellulosic fibers with chemical<br>
debonding agents, cross-linking agents and the like for use in the present<br>
material.<br>
The second absorbent layer 48 can contain any superabsorbent<br>
polymer (SAP), which SAPs are well known in the art. For the purposes of<br>
the present invention, the term "superabsorbent polymer" (or "SAP") refers to<br>
materials which are capable of absorbing and retaining at least about 10<br>
times their weight in body fluids under a 0.5 psi pressure. The<br>
superabsorbent polymer particles of the invention may be inorganic or<br>
organic crosslinked hydrophilic polymers, such as polyvinyl alcohols,<br>
polyethylene oxides, crosslinked starches, guar gum, xanthan gum, and the<br>
like. The particles may be in the form of a powder, grains, granules, or fibers.<br>
Preferred superabsorbent polymer particles for use in the present invention<br>
are crosslinked polyacrylates, such as the product offered by Sumitomo<br>
Seika Chemicals Co., Ltd. Of Osaka, Japan, under the designation of SA60N<br>
Type II, and the product offered by Chemdal International, Inc. of Palatine,<br>
Illinois, under the designation of 2100A*.<br>
In a specific example the second absorbent layer 48 is a material<br>
containing from about 50 to about 95 weight percent cellulosic fibers and,<br>
more specifically from about 60 to about 80 weight percent cellulosic fibers.<br>
Such a material may contain from about 5 to about 60 weight percent SAP,<br>
preferably from about 20 to about 55 weight percent SAP, even more<br>
preferably from about 30 to about 45 weight percent SAP, and most<br>
preferably about 40 weight percent SAP.<br>
The second absorbent layer 48 can be manufactured by using air-<br>
laying means well known in the art (See Figure 5). In accordance with Figure<br>
5, cellulosic fibers (e.g., pulp) are processed using a hammer mill to<br>
individualize the fibers. The individualized fibers are blended with SAP<br>
granules in a blending system 1 and pneumatically conveyed into a series of<br>
forming heads 2. The blending and distribution of fibers and SAP granules<br>
can be controlled separately for each forming head. Controlled air circulation<br>
and winged agitators in each chamber produce uniform mixture and<br>
distribution of pulp and SAP. The SAP can be thoroughly and<br>
homogeneously blended throughout the material or contained only in<br>
specific strata by distributing it to selected forming heads. Fibers (and SAP)<br>
from each forming chamber are deposited by vacuum onto a forming wire 3<br>
thus forming a layered absorbent web. The web is subsequently compressed<br>
using calenders 4 to achieve desirable density. The densified web is wound<br>
into a roll 5 using conventional winding equipment. The forming wire 3 can<br>
be covered with tissue paper to reduce the loss of material. The tissue paper<br>
layer can be removed prior to calendering or incorporated into the formed<br>
material. In a possible variant, the first absorbent layer 46 can be formed<br>
integrally with the second absorbent layer 48 to provide a unitized absorbent<br>
system 44. This can be achieved by providing the apparatus depicted in<br>
Figure 5 with an additional forming head (not shown in the drawings) to<br>
deposit on the second absorbent layer 48, by air laying and prior to<br>
calendering, a layer of material to form the first absorbent layer 46.<br>
The second absorbent layer 48 of the present invention is of high<br>
density and in a specific example has a density of greater than about 0.25<br>
g/cc. Specifically, the second absorbent layer 48 may have a density in the<br>
range of from about 0.30 g/cc to about 0.50 g/cc. More specifically, the<br>
density is from about 0.30 g/cc to about 0.45 g/cc and, even more<br>
specifically from about 0.35 g/cc to about 0.40 g/cc.<br>
Air-laid absorbents are typically produced with a low density. To<br>
achieve higher density levels, such as the examples of the second absorbent<br>
layer 48 given above, the air-laid material is compacted using calenders as<br>
shown in Figure 5. Compaction is accomplished using means well known in<br>
the art. Typically such compaction is carried out at a temperature of about<br>
100 degrees C and a load of about 130 Newtons per millimeter. The upper<br>
compaction roll is typically made of steel while the lower compaction roll is a<br>
flexroll having a hardness of about 85 SH D. It is preferred that both the<br>
upper and lower compaction rolls be smooth, although the upper roll can be<br>
engraved.<br>
In one embodiment the second absorbent layer 48 has a ratio of<br>
Gurley stiffness, measured in milligrams (mg) to density, measured in grams<br>
per cubic centimeter (g/cc), of less than about 3700. In a specific example,<br>
that ratio of Gurley stiffness to density is less than about 3200 and, more<br>
specifically, less than about 3000.<br>
Gurley stiffness is one of many indices of softness. Gurley stiffness<br>
measures the bendability or flexibility of absorbent materials. The lower the<br>
Gurley stiffness value, the more flexible the material. The Gurley stiffness<br>
values are measured using a Gurley Stiffness Tester (Model No. 4171E),<br>
manufactured by Gurley Precision Instruments of Troy, N.Y. The instrument<br>
measures the externally applied moment required to produce a given<br>
deflection of a test strip of specific dimensions fixed at one end and having a<br>
concentrated load applied to the other end. The results are obtained in<br>
"Gurley Stiffness" values in units of milligrams.<br>
The second absorbent layer 48 is strong in light of its softness. Pad<br>
integrity is a well-known measurement of absorbent material strength. In a<br>
specific embodiment the second absorbent layer 48 demonstrates strength<br>
(high pad integrity) over a wide range of densities. In a specific example the<br>
second absorbent layer 48 has a pad integrity, measured in Newtons (N), to<br>
density (g/cc) ratio of greater than about 25.0. In a more specific example,<br>
that ratio is greater than about 30.0 and, could even be greater than about<br>
35.0. The pad integrity is a test performed on an Instron Universal Testing<br>
Machine. Essentially, the test measures the load required to pierce through<br>
the test sample, as described in the PFI Method of 1981. A test sample<br>
having dimensions of 50 mm by 50 mm is clamped on the Instron with a<br>
suitable fastening device. A 20 mm diameter piston traveling at the rate of 50<br>
mm/min punctures the stationary sample. The force required to puncture the<br>
sample is measured in Newtons (N).<br>
The second absorbent layer 48 can be prepared over a wide range of<br>
basis weights. The second absorbent layer 48 can have a basis weight in the<br>
range of from about 100 g/m2 to about 700 g/m2: In a specific example, the<br>
basis weight ranges from about 150 g/m2 to about 350 g/m2. Preferably the<br>
basis weight ranges from about 200 g/m2 to about 300 g/m2 and, more<br>
preferably, to about 250 g/m2.<br>
The second absorbent layer 48 can be formed as three or four lamina<br>
or strata. Those strata include a bottom layer, one or two middle layers and a<br>
top layer. Specific examples of three and four layer material are set forth<br>
below. The SAP can be included in any or all of the layers. The<br>
concentration (weight percent) of SAP in each layer can vary as can the<br>
nature of the particular SAP.<br>
An interesting characteristic of the second absorbent layer 48 is its<br>
ability to retain SAP when subjected to mechanical stress. The second<br>
absorbent layer 48 retained over 85 percent by weight of its SAP content<br>
when subjected to 10 minutes of rigorous shaking. Specifically, a material of<br>
this invention retains over 90 percent, more specifically over 95 percent and,<br>
even more specifically over 99 percent of its SAP under these mechanical<br>
stresses. The percent of SAP retained was determined by shaking the<br>
material in a Ro-Tap Sieve Shaker manufactured by W. S. Tyler Co.,<br>
Cleveland Ohio. More specifically the sample is placed in a 28-mesh (Tyler<br>
series) sieve. Additional sieves of 35-mesh and 150-mesh were attached to<br>
the first sieve forming a column of increasingly fine sieves. The column of<br>
sieves was capped on either end to prevent the loss of fiber and/or SAP. The<br>
sieve column was placed in the shaker and agitated for 10 minutes. The<br>
amount of SAP granules shaken loose from the sample, "free SAP", was<br>
determined by combining the residue contained in each of the sieves and<br>
separating the cellulosic fiber from the SAP.<br>
Even where prepared as from multiple layers, the final thickness of<br>
the formed second absorbent layer 48 is low. The thickness can vary from<br>
about 0.5 mm to about 2.5 mm. In a specific example, the thickness is from<br>
about 1.0 mm to about 2.0 mm and, even more specifically from about 1.25<br>
mm to about 1.75 mm.<br>
One embodiment of the second absorbent layer 48 particularly well<br>
suited for use in the sanitary napkin 20 is depicted in Figure 6. Such second<br>
absorbent layer 48 has a basis weight of from about 200 g/m2 to about 350<br>
g/m2 and a density between about 0.3 g/cc and 0.5 g/cc. In a specific<br>
example, the density is from about 0.3 g/cc to about 0.45 g/cc and, more<br>
specifically about 0.3 g/cc to about 0.4 g/cc.<br>
The second absorbent layer 48 depicted in Figure 6(a) is air-laid as<br>
three strata: a bottom layer of pulp (without superabsorbent) with a basis<br>
weight of about 25 g/m2; a middle layer with a basis weight of about 150<br>
g/m2and which contains from about 10 to about 30 g/m2 superabsorbent and<br>
from about 120 g/m2 to about 140 g m2pulp; and a top layer of pulp (without<br>
superabsorbent) with a basis weight of about 25 g/m2. Relative to the total<br>
basis weight of the second absorbent layer 48, the level of superabsorbent<br>
ranges from about 5 to about 15 weight percent (g/m2 of superabsorbent per<br>
g/m2 material). In a specific example, the level of superabsorbent s from<br>
about 7.5 weight percent to about 12.5 weight percent of the material. More<br>
specifically, the material contains about 10 weight percent of<br>
superabsorbent. Thus, the middle layer of the material could contain from<br>
about 15 g/m2 to about 25 g/m2 superabsorbent and from about 125 g/m2 to<br>
about 135 g/m2 pulp and, more specifically about 20 g/m2 superabsorbent<br>
and about 130 g/m2 pulp. The middle layer containing pulp and<br>
superabsorbent can be laid down as a homogeneous blend or as a<br>
heterogeneous blend wherein the level of superabsorbent varies with<br>
proximity to the bottom layer.<br>
In another embodiment depicted in Figure 6(b), the second absorbent<br>
layer 48 is air-laid as four strata. In this embodiment, the middles layer<br>
referred to above is replaced with two middle layers: a first middle layer<br>
adjacent the top layer and a second middle layer adjacent the bottom layer.<br>
Each of the first and second middle layers independently comprises from<br>
about 10 to about 30 g/m2 superabsorbent and from about 40 g m2 to about<br>
65 g/ m2 pulp. When it is desired to keep absorbed fluid away from the cover<br>
layer 42 the amount of superabsorbent in the first and second middle layers<br>
is adjusted such that there is a higher level of superabsorbent in the second<br>
middle layer. The superabsorbent in the first and second middle layers can<br>
be the same or a different superabsorbent.<br>
In one embodiment, the cellulosic fiber for use in the second<br>
absorbent layer 48 is wood pulp. There are certain characteristics cf wood<br>
pulp that make it particularly suitable for use. Cellulose in most wood pulps<br>
has a crystalline form known as Cellulose I which can be converted to a form<br>
known as Cellulose II. In the second absorbent layer 48, wood pulp with a<br>
substantial portion of the cellulose as Cellulose II could be used. Similarly,<br>
pulps having an increased fiber curl value are advantageous. Finally, pulps<br>
having reduced levels of hemicellulose are preferred. Means for treating<br>
pulps so as to optimize these characteristics are well known in the art. By<br>
way of example, treating wood pulp with liquid ammonia is known to convert<br>
cellulose to the Cellulose II structure and to increase the fiber curl value.<br>
Flash drying is known to increase the fiber curl value of pulp. Cold caustic<br>
treatment of pulp decreases hemicellulose content, increases fiber curl and<br>
converts cellulose to the Cellulose II form. Thus it could be advantageous<br>
that the cellulosic fibers used to produce the material of this invention<br>
contain at least a portion of cold caustic treated pulp.<br>
A description of the cold caustic extraction process can be found in<br>
U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/370,571, filed on Jan. 18, 1995, pending<br>
which application is a continuation-in-part application of U.S. patent<br>
application Ser. No. 08/184,377, now abandoned filed on Jan. 21, 1994. The<br>
disclosures of both of these applications are incorporated in their entirety<br>
herein by reference.<br>
Briefly, a caustic treatment is typically carried out at a temperature<br>
less than about 60 degree C, but preferably at a temperature less than 50<br>
degree C, and more preferably at a temperature between about 10 degree<br>
C. to 40 degree C. A preferred alkali metal salt solution is a sodium<br>
hydroxide solution newly made up or as a solution by-product in a pulp or<br>
paper mill operation, e.g., hemicaustic white liquor, oxidized white liquor and<br>
the like. Other alkali metal salts such as ammonium hydroxide and<br>
potassium hydroxide and the like can be employed. However, from a cost<br>
standpoint, the preferable salt is sodium hydroxide. The concentration of<br>
alkali metal salts is typically in a range from about 2 to about 25 weight<br>
percent of the solution, and preferably from about 6 to about 18 weight<br>
percent. Pulps for high rate, fast absorbing applications are preferably<br>
treated with alkali metal salt concentrations from about 10 to about 18 weight<br>
percent.<br>
For further details on the structure and the method of construction of<br>
the second absorbent layer 48 the reader is invited to refer to the US patent<br>
5,866,242 granted on February 2, 1999 to Tan et al. The contents of this<br>
document are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Main Body-Barrier Layer<br>
Underlying the absorbent system 44 is a barrier layer 50 comprising<br>
liquid-impervious film material so as to prevent liquid that is entrapped in the<br>
absorbent system 44 from egressing the sanitary napkin and staining the<br>
wearer"s undergarment. The barrier layer 50 is made preferably of polymeric<br>
film.<br>
The cover layer 42 and the barrier layer 50 are joined along their<br>
marginal portions so as to form an enclosure or flange seal that maintains<br>
the absorbent system 44 captive. The joint may be made by means of<br>
adhesives, heat-bonding, ultrasonic bonding, radio frequency sealing,<br>
mechanical crimping, and the like and combinations thereof. The peripheral<br>
seal line is shown in Figure 1 by the reference numeral 52.<br>
Flaps<br>
The flaps 38 and 40 are preferably made as integral extensions of the<br>
cover layer 42 and the barrier layer 50. These integral extensions are joined<br>
to one another along their marginal seal portions by adhesives, heat-<br>
bonding, ultrasonic bonding, radio frequency sealing, mechanical crimping,<br>
and the like and combinations thereof. Most preferably, such joining is made<br>
at the same time the cover layer 42 and the barrier layer 50 are bonded to<br>
one another to enclose the absorbent system 44. Alternatively, the flaps<br>
may include absorbent material between the cover layer and the barrier layer<br>
extensions. Such absorbent material may be an extension of the first<br>
absorbent layer 46, the second absorbent layer 48 or both.<br>
Adhesive system<br>
Referring to Figures 2 and 3, in order to enhance the stability of the<br>
sanitary napkin, the garment facing surface of the barrier layer is provided<br>
with positioning adhesive material 58, typically hot-melt adhesive material<br>
capable of establishing a temporary bond with the undergarment material. A<br>
suitable material is the composition designated HL-1491 XZP commercially<br>
available from H.B. Fuller Canada, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The<br>
positioning adhesive 58 may be applied to the garment-facing surface of the<br>
barrier layer 50 in various patterns, including complete adhesive coverage,<br>
parallel longitudinal lines, a line of adhesive following the perimeter of the<br>
structure, transverse lines of adhesive or the like.<br>
Standard release paper 82 (shown only in Figure 3) covers the<br>
positioning adhesive 58 before the napkin is used to prevent the unwanted<br>
adherence of the napkin to itself or foreign objects. The release paper is of<br>
conventional construction (e.g. silicone coated wet-laid Kraft wood pulp) and<br>
suitable papers are available from Tekkote Corporation (Leonia, New Jersey,<br>
USA), and bear the designation FRASER 30#/61629.<br>
Method of manufacture<br>
The above-described embodiment of the sanitary napkin 20 is<br>
fabricated in a conventional manner in accordance with conventional<br>
techniques. Specifically, a laminate structure, sometimes referred to in the<br>
art as a web, is created. This laminate structure comprises an expanse of<br>
the materials from which the napkin will be created. I.e. the laminate<br>
structure comprises the following layers of material in a top-to-bottom order:<br>
an expanse of cover layer material; an expanse of first absorbent layer<br>
material; an expanse of second absorbent layer material (manufactured as<br>
described above); and finally an expanse of barrier layer. Some of the<br>
materials are necessarily not continuous within the laminate structure, and<br>
where such is the case, they are positioned precisely, one with respect to<br>
another, in the relationship they will occupy in the final products. The cover<br>
layer material and the barrier layer material are then bonded together by<br>
applying pressure in the appropriate positions, and what will become the<br>
peripheral seal is created. (The seal may also be made by means of heat-<br>
bonding, ultrasonic bonding, radio frequency sealing, mechanical crimping,<br>
and the like and combinations thereof.) The sealed structure is then severed<br>
by conventional means (i.e. die-cutting, fluid-jet cutting, or by laser) from the<br>
web to create a discrete article.<br>
The positioning adhesive material is then applied to the barrier layer<br>
in the appropriate positions, and release paper is applied to cover the<br>
positioning adhesive. Alternatively, the positioning adhesive, or the<br>
positioning adhesive and the release paper may be applied to the web<br>
before the individual articles are severed therefrom.<br>
As indicated earlier, the sanitary napkin 20 has a thickness of about 5<br>
mm or less. The apparatus required to measure the thickness of the sanitary<br>
napkin is a footed dial (thickness) gauge with stand, available from Ames,<br>
with a 2" diameter foot and a readout accurate to 0.001". A digital type<br>
apparatus is preferred. If the sanitary napkin sample is individually folded<br>
and wrapped, the sample is unwrapped and carefully flattened by hand. The<br>
release paper is removed from the sample and it is repositioned back gently<br>
across the positioning adhesive lines so as not to compress the sample,<br>
ensuring that the release paper lies flat across the sample. Flaps (if any) are<br>
not considered when taking the thickness reading of the sample.<br>
The foot of the gauge is raised and the sample is placed on the anvil<br>
such that the foot of the gauge is approximately centered to the sample (or in<br>
the location of interest on the sample of interest). When lowering the foot,<br>
care is taken to avoid allowing the foot to "drop" or that undue force is not<br>
applied. A load of 0.07 p.s.i.g. is applied to the sample and the read out is<br>
allowed to stabilize for approximately 5 seconds. The thickness reading is<br>
then taken. The thickness of the release paper covering the positioning<br>
adhesive is deducted from the total thickness.<br>
The sanitary napkin 20 is characterized by excellent absorption<br>
properties and at the same time it has a level of flexgral resistance sufficient<br>
to reduce the incidence of bunching in use. More particularly, the sanitary<br>
napkin 20 has a test capacity of more than about 8 g of fluid and a total<br>
capacity of more than about 14 g of fluid. The test and total capacities of a<br>
sanitary napkin are determined as follows. Any panty adhesive release<br>
paper is removed from the napkin to be tested. To determine test capacity, a<br>
4.75 cm by 14.0 cm portion of the sanitary napkin is cut from the portion of<br>
the sanitary napkin which would be centered under the vaginal orifice when<br>
the sanitary napkin is worn. Total capacity is determined using the entire<br>
napkin minus any release paper. The article is weighed to the nearest 0.1<br>
gram. The article is then submerged in a beaker of sterile saline (obtainable<br>
from the Baxter Travenol Company of Deerfield, III.), such that the article is<br>
totally submerged and is not bent or otherwise twisted or folded. The article<br>
is submerged for 10 minutes. The article is removed from the saline and<br>
suspended for two minutes in a vertical position to allow the saline to drain<br>
out of the article. The article is then placed body-facing surface down onto<br>
an absorbent blotter, such as the filter paper #631 available from the<br>
Filtration Science Corp., Eaton-Dikeman Division of Mount Holly Springs, Pa.<br>
A uniform 17.6 grams per square centimeter load is placed over the article to<br>
squeeze excess fluid out. The absorbent blotter is replaced every 30<br>
seconds until the amount of fluid transferred to the absorbent blotter is less<br>
than 0.5 grams in a 30 second period. Next, the article is weighed to the<br>
nearest 0.1 gram and the dry weight of the article is subtracted. The<br>
difference in grams is the test or total capacity of the article, whichever the<br>
case may be.<br>
The flexural resistance of the sanitary napkin is preferably in the<br>
range from about 400g to about 800 g. The flexural resistance of a sanitary<br>
napkin is measured by peak bending stiffness. Peak bending stiffness is<br>
determined by a test that is modeled after the ASTM D 4032-82 CIRCULAR<br>
BEND PROCEDURE, the procedure being considerably modified and<br>
performed as follows. The CIRCULAR BEND PROCEDURE is a<br>
simultaneous multi-directional deformation of a material in which one face of<br>
a specimen becomes concave and the other face becomes convex. The<br>
CIRCULAR BEND PROCEDURE gives a force value related to flexural<br>
resistance, simultaneously averaging stiffness in all directions.<br>
The apparatus necessary for the CIRCULAR BEND PROCEDURE is<br>
a modified Circular Bend Stiffness Tester, having the following parts:<br>
1. A smooth-polished steel plate platform which is 102.0 mm by 102.0 by<br>
6.35 mm having an 18.75 mm diameter orifice. The lap edge of the orifice<br>
should be at a 45 degree angle to a depth of 4.75 mm;<br>
2. A plunger having an overall length of 72.2 mm, a diameter of 6.25<br>
mm, a ball nose having a radius of 2.97 mm and a needle-point<br>
extending 0.88 mm therefrom having a 0.33 mm base diameter and a<br>
point having a radius of less than 0.5 mm, the plunger being mounted<br>
concentric with the orifice and having equal clearance on all sides. Note<br>
that the needle-point is merely to prevent lateral movement of the test<br>
specimen during testing. Therefore, if the needle-point significantly<br>
adversely affects the test specimen (for example, punctures an inflatable<br>
structure), than the needle-point should not be used. The bottom of the<br>
plunger should be set well above the top of the orifice plate. From this<br>
position, the downward stroke of the ball nose is to the exact bottom of<br>
the plate orifice;<br>
3. A force-measurement gauge and more specifically an Instron inverted<br>
compression load cell. The load cell has a load range of from about 0.0 to<br>
about 2000.0 g;<br>
4. An actuator and more specifically the Instron Model No. 1122 having an<br>
inverted compression load cell. The Instron 1122 is made by the Instron<br>
Engineering Corporation, Canton, Mass.<br>
In order to perform the procedure for this test, as explained below,<br>
five representative sanitary napkins are necessary. From one of the five<br>
napkins to be tested, some number "Y" of 37.5 mm by 37.5 mm test<br>
specimens are cut. Specimens having portions in which a cover layer is<br>
joined directly to a barrier layer or which are a laminate of a cover layer, and<br>
a barrier layer without any component of the absorbent system, should not<br>
be tested. This test is more concerned with the overall flexibility of the<br>
sanitary napkin and not merely the peripheral portions thereof and, therefore,<br>
the flexibility of the present invention is more concerned with the flexibility of<br>
the absorbent portions of the sanitary napkin.<br>
The test specimens should not be folded or bent by the test person,<br>
and the handling of specimens must be kept to a minimum and to the edges<br>
to avoid affecting flexural-resistance properties. From the four remaining<br>
sanitary napkins, an equal number "Y" of 37.5 mm by 37.5 mm specimens,<br>
identical to the specimens cut from the first napkin, are cut. Thus, the test<br>
person should have "Y" number of sets of five identical specimens.<br>
The procedure for the CIRCULAR BEND PROCEDURE is as follows.<br>
The specimens are conditioned by leaving them in a room that is 21 degree<br>
Celsius plus or minus 1 degree Celsius and 50% plus or minus 2.0 %<br>
relative humidity for a period of two hours. The test plate is leveled. The<br>
plunger speed is set at 50.0 cm per minute, per full stroke length. A specimen<br>
is centered on the orifice platform below the plunger such that the cover<br>
layer 42 of the specimen is facing the plunger and the barrier layer 50 of the<br>
specimen is facing the platform. The indicator zero is checked and adjusted,<br>
if necessary. The plunger is actuated. Touching the specimen during the<br>
testing should be avoided. The maximum force reading to the nearest gram<br>
is recorded. The above steps are repeated until all five of the identical<br>
specimens have been tested-.<br>
CALCULATIONS<br>
The peak bending stiffness for each specimen is the maximum force<br>
reading for that specimen. Remember that "Y" number of sets of five<br>
identical specimens were cut. Each set of five identical specimens is tested<br>
and the five values received for that set are averaged. Thus, the test person<br>
now has an average value for each of the "Y" sets tested. The flexural<br>
resistance for a sanitary napkin is the greatest of these average peak<br>
bending stiffnesses.<br>
Applications of the product and methods of the present invention for<br>
sanitary and other health-care uses can be accomplished by any sanitary<br>
protection, incontinence, medical and absorbent methods and techniques as<br>
are presently or prospectively known to those skilled in the art. Thus, it is<br>
intended that the present application covert the modifications and variations of<br>
this invention provided that they come within the scope of the appended claims<br>
and their equivalents. <br>
