				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
IONTOPHORETIC PREPARATION FOR TREATMENT OF BREAST CANCER<br>
AND/OR MASTITIS<br>
Technical Field [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to an iontophoretic preparation for the treatment of breast cancer and/or mastitis.<br>
Background Art [0002]<br>
Breast cancer is a cancer which occurs in mammary gland tissues and is classified into lobular carcinoma arising from acinus and breast ductal carcinoma arising from breast ducts. The state of cancer limited within lobules or breast ducts and not disseminating to surrounding tissue is called noninfiltrating cancer whereas the state in which cancer cells proliferating in breast ducts destroy basement membrane and develop metastasis to the neighboring tissues is called infiltrating cancer. As a treatment method for breast cancer, adjuvant chemotherapy is common, in which an anticancer agent is administered by instillation after surgery operation for excising affected parts or without surgery operation. However, many of anticancer agents<br>
have problems that they may cause side effects such as nausea, loss of appetite and alopecia when administered by instillation. [0003]<br>
Meanwhile, it has been reported that activities of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) increase upon the development of breast cancer (Non-patent Documents 1 to 5) .  Furthermore, it is known that non-steroidal antiinflammatory analgetic agents are effective for inhibiting COX-1 and COX-2.<br>
Mastitis is classified into stagnation mastitis and acute suppurative mastitis. Stagnation mastitis develops just after the puerperium in the state that milk stagnates within breast ducts. On the other hand, acute suppurative mastitis develops by infection of bacteria such as staphylococcus, Escherichia coli and streptococcus. Of these, treatment with an antiinflammatory analgetic agent is performed for acute suppurative mastitis (Non-patent Document 6).<br>
However, there has been a problem that non-steroidal antiinflammatory analgetic and/or anticancer agents cannot be administered topically since breast cancer and mastitis occur or develop within the breast. [0004]<br>
As attempts to treat breast diseases such as breast cancer by topical administration of a medicinal agent, methods of percutaneously administering adriamycin,<br>
danazol or progesterone to the breast have been reported (Non-patent Document 7, 8 and Patent Document 1). [Patent Document 1] W02004/060322 (Description) [Non-patent Document 1] Igaku no Ayumi (Journal of Clinical and Experimental Medicine), 204 (1), 10-19, 2003 [Non-patent Document 2] Journal of the National Cancer Institute, 90 (21), 1609-1620, 1998<br>

Disclosure of the Invention Problems to be Solved by the Invention [0005]<br>
When non-steroidal antiinflammatory analgetic agents and/or anticancer agents were administered by conventional topical administration means, their delivery rate to the location of breast cancer or affected parts<br>
of mastitis is extremely low and accordingly, such an approach has not come into practical use.<br>
Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide means to treat breast cancer and/or mastitis by topically administering a non-steroidal antiinflammatory analgetic agent and/or an anticancer agent and allowing them efficiently to arrive into the mammary gland. Means for Solving the problems [0006]<br>
The present inventors have directed attention to iontophoresis known as an enhancing method of percutaneous absorption and conducted studies thereon, and consequently, have found that when a donor of an iontophoretic preparation which contains a non-steroidal antiinflammatory analgetic agent and/or an anticancer agent is applied on a nipple part and to which electric potential is applied, the delivery rate of these active ingredients to the mammary gland is drastically enhanced as compared with a case in which the donor is applied on normal skin such as breast parts and electric potential is applied, and therefore such an approach is useful as a method to treat breast cancer and/or mastitis by topical administration. Thus, the present invention has been accomplished on the basis of this finding. [0007]<br>
That is, the present invention provides an iontophoretic preparation for treating breast cancer<br>
and/or mastitis which contains a non-steroidal antiinflammatory analgetic agent and/or an anticancer agent as an active ingredient and has a donor to be applied on a nipple part for topical administration of the active ingredient from the nipple part to the mammary gland by application of electric potential.<br>
In addition, the present invention also provides an iontophoretic therapeutic method comprising applying a donor which contains a non-steroidal antiinflammatory analgetic agent and/or an anticancer agent as an active ingredient on a nipple part and. topically administrating the active ingredient from the nipple to the mammary gland by application of electric potential.<br>
Further, the present invention provides use of a non-steroidal antiinflammatory analgetic agent and/or an anticancer agent for the production of an iontophoretic preparation for treating breast; cancer and/or mastitis which contains a donor to be applied on a nipple part for topical administration of the active ingredient from the nipple to the mammary gland by application of electric potential.<br>
Effects of the Invention [0008]<br>
The present invention enables non-steroidal antiinflammatory analgetic agents and/or anticancer agents which are active ingredients to be specifically absorbed in the mammary gland, and accordingly, treatment<br>
of breast cancer and/or mastitis becomes possible with lower doses than conventional methods, thereby reducing side effects.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention [0011]<br>
With the iontophoretic preparation for breast cancer and/or mastitis treatment of the present invention, a donor is applied to "a nipple part and an active ingredient is topically administrated from the nipple part into the mammary gland by application of electric potential.  It has been utterly unexpected that permeability is enhanced remarkably in administration from the nipple part by application of electric potential as compared with administration from normal skin such as breasts. <br>
[0012] <br>
Examples of the non-steroidal antiinflammatory analgetic agent which is the active ingredient of the therapeutic agent for breast cancer and/or mastitis of the present invention include indomethacin, acemetacin, salicylic acid, sodium salicylate, aspirin, acetaminophen, diclofenac sodium, anfenac sodium, ibuprofen, sulindac,<br>
naproxen, ketoprofen, flufenamic acid, ibufenac, fenbufen,<br>
alclofenac, phenylbutazone, mefenamic acid, bendazac,<br>
piroxicam, flurbiprofen, pentazocine, buprenorphine hydrochloride, butorphanol tartrate, celecoxib, rofecoxib, valdecoxib, etoricoxib, Lumiracoxib, parecoxib Na, etodolac, NS-398 and meloxicam. Of these, indomethacin and celecoxib are preferable at a point of absorption efficiency from the nipple part to the mammary gland, and indomethacin is particularly preferable. [0013]<br>
Examples of the anticancer agent include alkylating agents such as ifosfamide and cyclophosphamide; platinum compounds such as carboplatin, cisplatin, nedaplatin and oxaliplatin,- vegetable anticancer agents such as irinotecan hydrochloride, etoposide, docetaxel hydrate, vincristine sulfate, vinblastine sulfate, paclitaxel and vinorelbine ditartrate; hormones such as tamoxifen citrate, fadrozole hydrochloride hydrate, flutamide and medroxyprogesterone acetate; ariticancerous antibiotics such as doxorubicin hydrochloride, idarubicin hydrochloride, zinostatin stimalamer, daunorubicin hydrochloride, bleomycin hydrochloride, epirubicin hydrochloride, mitoxantrone hydrochloride, pirarubicin hydrochloride and mitomycin C; antimetabolites such as carmofur, cytarabine, doxifluridine, hydroxycarbamide, methotrexate, mercaptopurine, gemcitabine hydrochloride, fluorouracil and capecitabine,- linear surfactin having a lactone type cyclohepta peptide structure and monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab. Of these, alkylating agents such as cyclophosphamide and antimetabolites such as fluorouracil are preferable at a point of absorption efficiency from the nipple part to the mammary gland, and cyclophosphamide and fluorouracil (in particular, 5-FU) are particularly preferable. [0014]<br>
When the donor of the iontophoretic preparation of the present inventor is applied on the nipple part and an<br>
active ingredient is topically administered from the nipple part to the mammary gland by application of electric potential, migration of an anticancer agent and a non-steroidal antiinflammatory agent from the nipple part to the mammary gland is drastically enhanced as compared with application of electric potential on the normal skin, as demonstrated in the after-mentioned Examples, although the degree of migration properties are different depending upon the kind of drugs. The transfer properties are particularly remarkable in indomethacin, cyclophosphamide and fluorouracil. [0015]<br>
An iontophoretic preparation usually consists of a donor and a receptor, but as for the iontophoretic preparation of the present invention for breast cancer and/or mastitis treatment, at least the donor is applied on the nipple part. The donor may have an electrode and a pad containing the aforementioned active ingredient, and the pad containing the active ingredient may contain an electrolyte. The iontophoretic preparation generally consists of a power supply, an anode (an electrode and a pad) and a cathode (an electrode and a pad). Examples of the shape of electrodes include a pairing structure in which the anode and the cathode make an opposing pair,-and a surrounding structure in which the anode and/or the cathode is located inside while the cathode and/or the anode is located outside (Biological Pharmaceutical<br>
Bulletin, 26(4), 518-522, 2003). Here, inananionic drug, the cathode is used as a donor, and in a cationic drug, the anode is used as a donor, and as for a nonionic drug, the anode is used as a donor using a principle of electroosmosis (Biological Pharmaceutical Bulletin, 24, 278-283, 2001; Biological Pharmaceutical Bulletin, 24, 671-677, 2001; and Pharmaceutical Research, 18, 1701-1708, 2001). [0016]<br>

One kind of<br>
these or two or more kinds of these in combination can be used. [0019]<br>
Sodium chloride, potassium chloride, sodium bromide, potassium bromide, calcium chloride, calcium bromide and the like may be used as an electrolyte constituting the pad of the present invention. [0020]<br>
Base materials, thickening agents, preservatives, pH adjusters, oil ingredients, flavoring agents, stabilizers, surfactants, curing agents and chemical enhancers can be also added to the pad. [0021]<br>
Examples of the base material include sodium alginate, ethyl cellulose, carrageenan, carmellose sodium, agar, xanthan gum, gelatine, kaolin, bentonite, montmorillonite, zinc oxide, titanium oxide, silicic anhydride, D-sorbitol, talc, terpene resins, hydroxypropylcellulose and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose. [0022]<br>

[0030]<br>
The content of the active ingredient in the pad is preferably 0.01 to 20 mass%, more preferably 0.1 to 10 mass% from a point of migration of the active ingredient from the nipple to the mammary gland. [0031]<br>
In the meantime, the receptor of the iontophoretic preparation for breast cancer and/or mastitis treatment of the present invention is basically constituted of a support 1, an electrode 2, a pad 3 and a liner 4 as shown in Fig. 1 as well. The support, the electrode and the liner are made of materials similar to those of a donor, and the pad does not contain an active ingredient but contains an electrolyte. [0032]<br>
Furthermore, the preparation may form a surrounding structure in which a power supply, a donor and a receptor are incorporated as in WO98/35722, or may form a pair structure in which a power supply, a donor and a receptor are separated. [0033]<br>
It is preferable in present invention to apply a donor to the nipple part and place a receptor on the breast part at a point of allowing a non-steroidal antiinflammatory analgetic agent and/or an anticancer agent to selectively and efficiently migrate from the nipple to the mammary gland.  In this case, it is preferable that the donor is a donor having a size to cover up the whole nipple part. On the other hand, it is preferable that the receptor is a receptor having a size to wrap up at least the affected area of the breast. The shape of the donor is not limited, but a circle or an oval form is preferable in that it may cover the nipple,<br>
and the shape of the receptor is preferably a circle, an oval form, a disk or an oval disk in that it may cover at least the affected area of the breast (Figs. 2 and 3). The receptor particularly preferably has a shape which covers up the whole breast except the nipple part, for example, forms like a disk or an oval disk (Fig. 3). [0034]<br>
The iontophoretic preparation for breast cancer and/or mastitis treatment of the present invention has an electrode and a pad containing an active ingredient as a donor and has an electrode and a pad containing an electrolyte as a receptor, and when the active ingredient is an anionic drug such as indomethacin, for example, an electronic flow from the donor (cathode) to the receptor (anode) occurs by applying the donor onto the nipple part and the receptor onto the breast part and applying an electric potential and this flow allows indomethacin in the donor to absorb into the mammary gland.  In the case of a nonionic drug such as carmofur or fluorouracil, the drug is absorbed into the mammary gland through an aquatic flow associated with the transfer of the other cations from the donor (anode) to the receptor (cathode). Examples [0035]<br>
Hereinbelow, the present invention will next be described in more detail by way of examples, but the<br>
present invention is not limited to these examples by any means. [0036] Example 1<br>
A permeation experiment (in vitro) through a skin excised from a beagle by iontophoresis was performed using a indomethacin-containing solution.<br>
As for the excised skin, the abdominal skin of a beagle (male, 3-year old) was subjected to dehairing treatment and then a skin area containing a nipple and a skin area not containing a nipple were excised and used. Idomethine Kowa Sol (produced by Kowa Co., Ltd., lot number QF45) was used as a donor solution just as it was. A mixed solvent of macrogol 400 and saline (mass mixing rate; macrogol 400 /normal saline solution = 6:4) was used as a receptor solution. Two kinds of the excised skin were attached on Franz cells with the surface thereof on the donor side and the cells were filled with I mL of the donor solution and 19 mL of the receptor solution. A silver chloride electrode was inserted in the donor (cathode) side whereas a silver electrode was inserted in the receptor (anode) side so that they might be sufficient contact with the liquid and an electric potential at 0 or 3V was applied by a DC voltage current generator for 100 minutes. When 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 minutes passed after the start of the application of electric potential, 1 mL of the receptor liquid was<br>
sampled from a sampling port of the receptor side and I mL of a. new receptor liquid was supplemented.  The indomethacin concentration in the sampled receptor liquid was measured by HPLC method. Here, since the skin including the nipple (0.196 cm2) included the skin (0.589 cm2) other than the nipple, the permeated amount was corrected based on the whole permeation area (0.785 cm2) to indicate a value only through the nipple part. [0037]<br>
The time change course of the accumulated permeated amount of indomethacin and the increase rate after 100 minutes are shown in Table 1. The permeability of indomethacin through normal skin increased only by about 2 times when electric potential was applied at 3V whereas the permeability of indomethacin from the nipple increased by about 10 times than that through normal skin without application of electric: potential and by about 17 times when electric potential was applied at 3V. [0038] [Table 1] Table for permeated amount (ug/cm2) of indomethacin and increase rate thereof<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
[0039] Example 2<br>
A permeation experiment (in vitro) through a skin excised from a beagle by iontophoresis was performed using a cyclophosphamide-containing solution .<br>
As for the excised skin, the skin on the abdomen of a beagle (male, 3-year old) was subjected to dehairing treatment and then a skin area containing a nipple and a skin area not containing a nipple were excised and used. A buffer solution containing 25 mM cyclophosphamide (25 mM HEPES buffer containing 133 mM NaCl, pH 3) was used as a donor solution. A 25 mM HEPES buffer containing 133 mM NaCl (pH 3) was used as a receptor solution.<br>
Two kinds of the excised skin were attached on Franz cells with the surface thereof on the donor side and the cells were filled with 3 mL of the donor solution and 31 mL of the receptor solution. Aluminum foil was attached to donor (anode) side and receptor (cathode) side electrodes and the electrodes were inserted so that they might be sufficient contact with the liquid and an electric potential at 0 or 0.1 mA/cm2 was applied by a DC voltage current generator for 180 minutes.  When 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 minutes passed after the start of the application of electric potential, 1 mL of the receptor liquid was sampled from a sampling orifice of the receptor side and 1 mL of a new receptor liquid was<br>
supplemented. The cyclophosphamide concentration in the sampled receptor liquid was measured by HPLC method. Here, since the skin including the nipple (0.629 cm2) included the skin (2.511 cm2) other than the nipple, permeated amount was corrected based on the whole permeation area (3.14 cm2) to indicate a value only through the nipple part. [0040]<br>
The time change course of the accumulated permeated amount of cyclophosphamide and the increase rate after 180 minutes are shown in Table 2. The permeability of cyclophosphamide through normal skin hardly changed even when an electric potential was applied (at 0.1 mA/cm2) and the permeability of cyclophosphamide from the nipple was not enhanced as compared with the permeability through normal skin. Nevertheless, the permeability from the nipple when an electric potential (at 0.1 mA/cm2) increased by about 7.1 times as compared with the permeability through normal skin without application of electric potential. [0041]<br>
 [Table   2] Table for permeated amount (p,g/cm2) of cyclophosphamide and increase rate thereof<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
[0042] Example 3<br>
A permeation experiment (in vitro) through a skin excised from a beagle by iontophoresis was performed using a 5-fluorouracil-containing solution.<br>
As for the excised skin, the skin on the abdomen of a beagle (male, 3-year old) was subjected to dehairing treatment and then a skin area containing a nipple and a skin area not containing a nipple were excised and used. A buffer solution containing 1% 5-fluorouracil (25 mM HEPES buffer containing 133 mM NaCl, pH 8.5) was used as a donor solution. A normal saline solution was used as a receptor solution.<br>
Two kinds of the excised skin were attached on Franz cells with the surface thereof on the donor side and the cells were filled with 1 mL of the donor solution and 19 mL of the receptor solution. Aluminum foil was attached to donor (cathode) side and receptor (anode) side electrodes and the electrodes were inserted so that they might be sufficient contact with the liquid and an electric potential at 0 or 3 V was applied by a DC voltage current generator for 360 minutes. When 60, 120, 180, 240, 300 and 360 minutes passed after the start of the application of electric potential, 1 mL of the receptor liquid was sampled from a sampling orifice of the receptor side and 1 mL of a new receptor liquid was supplemented. The 5-fluorouracil concentration in the<br>
sampled receptor liquid was measured by HPLC method. Here, since the skin including the nipple (0.385 cm2) included the skin (0.4 cm2) other than the nipple, permeated amount was corrected based on the whole permeation area (0.785 cm2) to indicate a value only through the nipple part. [0043]<br>
[Table  3] Table for permeated amount (u.g/cm2) of 5-fluorouracil and increase rate thereof<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
[0044]<br>
The time change course of the accumulated permeated amount of 5-fluorouracil and the increase rate after 360 minutes are shown in Table 3. The permeability of 5-fluorouracil through normal skin increased by about 3000 times when an electric potential was applied (at 3V) and the permeability of 5-fluorouracil from the nipple increased by about 40 times compared with the permeability without application of electric potential, and increased by about 10000 times than that through normal skin when electric potential applied (at 3V). [0045] Example 4<br>
One (1) g of polyvinyl alcohol (partially saponified substance) was added to 40 g of a normal saline solution, heated to 50°C and dissolved. After cooling to room temperature, 0.1 g of sodium edetate and 1.3 g of tartaric acid were added and dissolved, and then 20 g of concentrated glycerin was added (aqueous phase). Separately, 3.5 g of carmellose sodium, 5 g of partially neutralized polyacrylic acid (NP-700), 5 g of partially neutralized polyacrylic acid (NP-800) and 0.2 g of dihydroxy aluminum acetate were added to 20 g of macrogol 400, and uniformly suspended (oily phase). The oily phase was added to the aqueous phase and, furthermore, a normal saline solution was addend thereto to adjust the total amount to 100 g. This mixture was uniformly<br><br>
kneaded with a kneader and extended with an extender to a thickness of 1 mm and thus pads of the composition of Table 4 were prepared. [0046] [Table 4]<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
 [0047]<br>
One (1) g of indomethacin was dissolved in the oily phase of Table 4 to prepare a pad containing indomethacin. An aluminum electrode was attached to the pad and a donor having a circular form shown in Fig. 3 was prepared.  In the meantime, an aluminum electrode was attached to a pad<br>
(not containing indomethacin) of Table 4 to obtain a receptor having a shape of Fig. 3.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1.	An iontophoretic preparation for treating breast cancer and/or mastitis characterized in that it contains a non-steroidal antiinflammatory analgetic agent of the kind such as hereinbefore described and/or an anticancer agent of the kind such as hereinbefore described as an active ingredient in an amount of from 0.01 to 20 mass % and has a donor comprising an electrode and a pad containing the active ingredient to be applied on a nipple part and a receptor to be applied on the breast part for topical administration of the active ingredient from the nipple to a mammary gland by application of electric potential at 3 V.<br>
2.	The preparation as claimed in claim 1, wherein the non-steroidal antiinflammatory analgetic agent is indomethacin.<br>
3.	The preparation as claimed in claim 1, wherein the anticancer agent is cyclophosphamide or fluorouracil.<br>
4.	The preparation as claimed in claims 1 to 3, wherein the donor has a size to cover the nipple and the receptor has a size to cover at least an affected part of the breast.<br>
5.	The preparation as claimed in claim 4, wherein the receptor is in a form of a disk or an oval disk which covers up the whole breast except the nipple part.</td>
