				<td>DOUBLE ENDED INVERTER SYSTEM FOR A VEHICLE HAVING TWO<br>
ENERGY SOURCES THAT EXHIBIT DIFFERENT OPERATING<br>
CHARACTERISTICS<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION(S)<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of United States provisional<br>
patent application serial number 60/952,754, filed July 30, 2007 (the entire<br>
content of which is incorporated by reference herein).<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002] Embodiments of the subject matter described herein relate<br>
generally to an electric traction system. More particularly, embodiments of<br>
the subject matter relate to methods and apparatus for utilizing multiple energy<br>
sources for the electric traction system, where the energy sources have<br>
different operating characteristics.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] In recent years, advances in technology, as well as ever evolving<br>
tastes in style, have led to substantial changes in the design of automobiles.<br>
One of the changes involves the power usage and complexity of the various<br>
electrical systems within automobiles, particularly alternative fuel vehicles,<br>
such as hybrid, electric, and fuel cell vehicles.<br>
[0004] Batteries are typically used to provide electric power storage in<br>
most electric and hybrid electric vehicles. Battery technology is known and its<br>
deficiencies are well understood. One practical deficiency is that a given type<br>
of battery may only be suitable for certain operating conditions. For example,<br>
some batteries are suitable for operation at low temperatures and unsuitable<br>
for operation at high temperatures, while others are suitable for operation at<br><br>
high temperatures and unsuitable for operation at low temperatures. Thus, it is<br>
a technological challenge to have a single battery that performs well at very<br>
low temperatures and at relatively high temperatures that are usually<br>
associated with the operation of electric and hybrid electric vehicles.<br>
[0005] As another example, some batteries perform best when delivering<br>
quick bursts of high power, while other batteries perform best when delivering<br>
lower power over a longer period of time. In this regard, lithium ion batteries<br>
are sufficient for high energy applications that require continuous power over<br>
a period of time, but they have difficulty providing bursts of power over a<br>
short time period. Thus, in an electric or hybrid vehicle application, lithium<br>
ion batteries can adequately provide power once the vehicle is cruising, but<br>
they struggle to deliver power for short duration events such as acceleration,<br>
and cold starting. On the other hand, as an alternative to lithium ion batteries,<br>
nickel metal hydride (NiMH) and lead acid batteries have been explored for<br>
hybrid electric vehicles. While these batteries can provide enough power to<br>
handle peak loads, using them in this manner lessens their cycle life<br>
dramatically. Thus, it is also a technological challenge to have a single battery<br>
that demonstrates both energy and power characteristics for electric and hybrid<br>
electric vehicle applications.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY<br>
[0006] A double ended inverter system is provided for an AC electric<br>
traction motor of a vehicle. The double ended inverter system includes a first<br>
energy source having first operating characteristics associated therewith, and a<br>
second energy source having second operating characteristics associated<br>
therewith, wherein the first operating characteristics and the second operating<br>
characteristics are different. The system also includes a first inverter<br>
subsystem coupled to the first energy source, and a second inverter subsystem<br>
coupled to the second energy source. The two inverter subsystems are<br>
configured to drive the AC electric traction motor. The system also includes a<br>
controller coupled to the first inverter subsystem and to the second inverter<br><br>
subsystem. The controller is configured to influence operation of the first<br>
inverter subsystem and the second inverter subsystem to manage power<br>
transfer among the first energy source, the second energy source, and the AC<br>
electric traction motor.<br>
[0007] A double ended inverter system for a vehicle is also provided. The<br>

set of windings, where each winding in the set of windings has a first end and<br>
a second end; a low temperature energy source having a relatively low<br>
nominal operating temperature range; a first inverter subsystem coupled to the<br>
low temperature energy source and configured to drive the AC electric traction<br>
motor, wherein the first end of each winding in the set of windings is coupled<br>
to the first inverter subsystem; a high temperature energy source having a<br>
relatively high nominal operating temperature range; and a second inverter<br>
subsystem coupled to the high temperature energy source and configured to<br>
drive the AC electric traction motor, wherein the second end of each winding<br>
in the set of windings is coupled to the second inverter subsystem.<br>
[0008] Another embodiment of a double ended inverter system for a<br>
vehicle is also provided. This system includes an AC electric traction motor<br>
having a set of windings, where each winding in the set of windings has a first<br>
end and a second end. The system also includes a power battery subsystem<br>
having a relatively high voltage and a relatively low amp-hours rating, and an<br>
energy battery subsystem having a relatively medium-to-high voltage and a<br>
relatively high amp-hours rating. The system employs a first inverter<br>
subsystem coupled to the power battery subsystem and configured to drive the<br>
AC electric traction motor, wherein the first end of each winding in the set of<br>
windings is coupled to the first inverter subsystem, and employs a second<br>
inverter subsystem coupled to the energy battery subsystem and configured to<br>
drive the AC electric traction motor, wherein the second end of each winding<br>
in the set of windings is coupled to the second inverter subsystem.<br>
[0009] This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a<br>
simplified form that are further described below in the detailed description.<br><br>
This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of<br>
the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in<br>
determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0010] A more complete understanding of the subject matter may be<br>
derived by referring to the detailed description and claims when considered in<br>
conjunction with the following figures, wherein like reference numbers refer<br>
to similar elements throughout the figures.<br>
[0011] FIG. 1 is a schematic representation of an exemplary vehicle that<br>
incorporates an embodiment of a double ended inverter system;<br>
[0012] FIG. 2 is a schematic circuit representation of a first embodiment<br>
of a double ended inverter system suitable for use with an electric or hybrid<br>
electric vehicle; and<br>
[0013] FIG. 3 is a schematic circuit representation of a second<br>
embodiment of a double ended inverter system suitable for use with an electric<br>
or hybrid electric vehicle.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0014] The following detailed description is merely illustrative in nature<br>
and is not intended to limit the embodiments of the subject matter or the<br>
application and uses of such embodiments. As used herein, the word<br>
"exemplary" means "serving as an example, instance, or illustration." Any<br>
implementation described herein as exemplary is not necessarily to be<br>
construed as preferred or advantageous over other implementations.<br>
Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any expressed or implied<br>
theory presented in the preceding technical field, background, brief summary<br>
or the following detailed description.<br>
[0015] Techniques and technologies may be described herein in terms of<br>
functional and/or logical block components, and with reference to symbolic<br>
representations of operations, processing tasks, and functions that may be<br><br>
performed by various computing components or devices. For the sake of<br>
brevity, conventional techniques related to inverters, AC motor control,<br>
electric and hybrid electric vehicle operation, and other functional aspects of<br>
the systems (and the individual operating components of the systems) may not<br>
be described in detail herein. Furthermore, the connecting lines shown in the<br>
various figures contained herein are intended to represent exemplary<br>
functional relationships and/or physical couplings between the various<br>
elements. It should be noted that many alternative or additional functional<br>
relationships or physical connections may be present in an embodiment of the<br>
subject matter.<br>
[0016] The following description refers to elements or nodes or features<br>
being "connected" or "coupled" together. As used herein, unless expressly<br>
stated otherwise, "connected" means that one element/node/feature is directly<br>
joined to (or directly communicates with) another element/node/feature, and<br>
not necessarily mechanically. Likewise, unless expressly stated otherwise,<br>
"coupled" means that one element/node/feature is directly or indirectly joined<br>
to (or directly or indirectly communicates with) another element/node/feature,<br>
and not necessarily mechanically. Thus, although the schematic shown in<br>
FIG. 1 depicts one exemplary arrangement of elements, additional intervening<br>
elements, devices, features, or components may be present in an embodiment<br>
of the depicted subject matter.<br>
[0017] With reference to FIGS. 1-3, an exemplary embodiment, which is a<br>
doubled ended inverter, permits a single electric motor to be driven from two<br>
different power sources. This can be useful when there are two power sources<br>
with different operating characteristics, ratings, optimized operating condition<br>
ranges, temperature ranges, or the like. One example would be a lithium ion<br>
battery pack with a limited temperature range that requires the battery pack to<br>
be cabin mounted in the vehicle. Using the double ended inverter with an<br>
additional wider temperature range power source permits operation beyond the<br>
limits of the lithium ion battery pack, especially during cold or hot starts<br>
where the battery pack has been thermally soaked for a long time and cabin<br><br>
heating/cooling has not moved the temperature of the battery pack into its<br>
normal operating range.<br>
[0018] Thus, the double ended inverter can be used to combine two<br>
batteries with different operating temperature ranges. For example, a lithium<br>
ion battery pack with a relatively high nominal operating temperature range of<br>
-20°C to + 80°C can be used with a lead acid battery with a relatively low<br>
nominal operating temperature range of -40°C to +95°C. During cold starts<br>
below -20°C the lead acid battery can operate the motor until the lithium ion<br>
battery warms up. In alternate embodiments, the double ended inverter system<br>
could be utilized with other energy storage devices having different operating<br>
temperature ranges, such as different types of ultra capacitors.<br>
[0019] By combining a wider temperature range battery with a limited<br>
temperature range battery, the overall operating temperature range of the<br>
system can be extended. The double ended inverter is a very good way to<br>
combine two power sources at low cost and also provide battery charging and<br>
state of charge (SOC) regulation at no additional cost.<br>
[0020] In accordance with another exemplary embodiment, a double<br>
ended inverter is configured to permit a single electric motor to be driven from<br>
two different power sources having different energy discharge/charge<br>
characteristics. This can be useful when it is desirable to employ two different<br>
batteries rather than compromising performance with a single battery. Thus,<br>
an energy battery can be coupled with a power batteiy through the double<br>
ended inverter topology.<br>
[0021] For example, a lithium ion battery can handle continuous load<br>
requirements (which occur when the vehicle is cruising at a somewhat steady<br>
speed). Using a double ended inverter with a lead acid battery as the<br>
secondary power source will deliver power for short duration peak power<br>
events like acceleration. This will significantly reduce or eliminate the need<br>
for a single battery with combined energy and power characteristics.<br>
[0022] This embodiment has numerous benefits. For example, it<br>
combines two types of batteries, manages both battery packs, significantly<br><br>
reduces or eliminates the need for a single battery with combined energy and<br>
power characteristics, and allows for use of existing battery technologies.<br>
[0023] Referring more specifically to FIG. 1, a schematic representation of<br>
an exemplary vehicle 100 is depicted. Vehicle 100 preferably incorporates an<br>
embodiment of a double ended inverter system as described in more detail<br>
below. The vehicle 100 generally includes a chassis 102, a body 104, four<br>
wheels 106, and an electronic control system 108. The body 104 is arranged<br>
on chassis 102 and substantially encloses the other components of vehicle 100.<br>
The body 104 and chassis 102 may jointly form a frame. The wheels 106 are<br>
each rotationally coupled to chassis 102 near a respective corner of body 104.<br>
[0024] The vehicle 100 may be any one of a number of different types of<br>
automobiles, such as, for example, a sedan, a wagon, a truck, or a sport utility<br>
vehicle (SUV), and may be two-wheel drive (2WD) (i.e., rear-wheel drive or<br>
front-wheel drive), four-wheel drive (4WD), or all-wheel drive (A WD). The<br>
vehicle 100 may also incorporate any one of, or combination of, a number of<br>
different types of engines and/or traction systems, such as, for example, a<br>
gasoline or diesel fueled combustion engine, a "flex fuel vehicle" (FFV)<br>
engine (i.e., using a mixture of gasoline and alcohol), a gaseous compound<br>
(e.g., hydrogen and natural gas) fueled engine, a combustion/electric motor<br>
hybrid engine, and an electric motor.<br>
[0025] In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1, vehicle 100 is a<br>
fully electric or a hybrid electric vehicle, and vehicle 100 further includes an<br>
electric motor (or traction motor) 110, a first energy source 112 having first<br>
operating characteristics associated therewith, a second, energy source 114<br>
having second operating characteristics associated therewith, a double ended<br>
inverter system 116, and a radiator 118. For the embodiments described here,<br>
first energy source 112 and second energy source 114 are batteries of different<br>
type, class, category, rating, etc. Indeed, double ended inverter system 116 is<br>
suitably configured such that the first operating characteristics of first energy<br>
source 112 can be different than (and possibly incompatible with) the second<br>
operating characteristics of second energy source 114. As shown, first energy<br><br>
source 112 and second energy source 114 are in operable communication<br>
and/or electrically connected to electronic control system 108 and to double<br>
ended inverter system 116. It should also be noted that vehicle 100, in the<br>
depicted embodiment, does not include a direct current-to-direct current<br>
(DC/DC) power converter as an integral part of the vehicle's traction<br>
propulsion system.<br>
[0026] The motor 110, in one embodiment, is a three-phase alternating<br>
current (AC) electric traction motor. As shown in FIG. 1, motor 110 may also<br>
include or cooperate with a transmission such that motor 110 and the<br>
transmission are mechanically coupled to at least some of the wheels 106<br>
through one or more drive shafts 120. The radiator 118 is connected to the<br>
frame at an outer portion thereof and although not illustrated in detail, includes<br>
multiple cooling channels that contain a cooling fluid (i.e., coolant), such as<br>
water and/or ethylene glycol (i.e., antifreeze). The radiator 118 is coupled to<br>
double ended inverter system 116 and to motor 110 for purposes of routing the<br>
coolant to those components. In one embodiment, double ended inverter<br>
system 116 receives and shares coolant with motor 110. In other<br>
embodiments, the double ended inverter system 116 may be air cooled.<br>
[0027] The electronic control system 108 is in operable communication<br>
with motor 110, first energy source 112, second energy source 114, and<br>
double ended inverter system 116. Although not shown in detail, electronic<br>
control system 108 includes various sensors and automotive control modules,<br>
or electronic control units (ECUs), such as an inverter control module (i.e., the<br>
controller shown in FIG. 2 and FIG. 3) and a vehicle controller, and at least<br>
one processor and/or a memory which includes instructions stored thereon (or<br>
in another computer-readable medium) for carrying out the processes and<br>
methods as described below.<br>
[0028] FIG. 2 is a schematic circuit representation of an embodiment of a<br>
double ended inverter system 200 suitable for use with an electric or hybrid<br>
electric vehicle. In certain embodiments, double ended inverter system 116<br>
(shown in FIG. 1) can be implemented in this manner. As depicted in FIG. 2,<br><br>
double ended inverter system 200 is coupled to, and cooperates with, an AC<br>
electric traction motor 202, a low temperature battery subsystem 204, and a<br>
high temperature battery subsystem 206. Double ended inverter system 200<br>
generally includes, without limitation: a first inverter subsystem 208 coupled<br>
to low temperature battery subsystem 204; a second inverter subsystem 210<br>
coupled to high temperature battery subsystem 206, and a controller 212<br>
coupled to first inverter subsystem 208 and to second inverter subsystem 210.<br>
Although not shown in FIG. 2, respective capacitors may be coupled in<br>
parallel with low temperature battery subsystem 204 and high temperature<br>
battery subsystem 206 to smooth current ripple during operation.<br>
[0029] Double ended inverter system 200 allows AC electric traction<br>
motor 202 to be powered by different battery types having disparate nominal<br>
operating temperature ranges. This topology enables the vehicle to take<br>
advantage of better performance characteristics of different battery types<br>
without having to compromise by using a single battery. For this particular<br>
embodiment, low temperature battery subsystem 204 is realized as a low<br>
temperature battery pack that has a relatively low nominal operating<br>
temperature range. In other words, the low temperature battery pack can<br>
provide reliable operating power to double ended inverter system 200 under<br>
low temperature conditions that might adversely affect the operation of high<br>
temperature battery subsystem 206.<br>
[0030] In one embodiment, low temperature battery subsystem 204<br>
includes a lead acid battery pack having a nominal operating temperature<br>
range of about -40°C to +95°C, and a nominal DC voltage of about 200-350<br>
volts (typically, about 300 volts). In contrast, high temperature battery<br>
subsystem 206 is realized as a high temperature battery pack that has a<br>
relatively high nominal operating temperature range. Thus, the high<br>
temperature battery pack can provide reliable operating power to double ended<br>
inverter system 200 under high temperature conditions that might adversely<br>
affect the operation of low temperature battery subsystem 204. In one<br>
embodiment, high temperature battery subsystem 206 includes a lithium ion<br><br>
battery pack having a nominal operating temperature range of about -20°C to<br>
+80°C, and a nominal DC voltage of about 200-350 volts (typically, about 300<br>
volts). Notably, a lithium ion battery pack is not appropriate for temperatures<br>
below about -20°C and, therefore, the lead acid battery pack is more suitable<br>
for such extremely low temperatures. Although not a requirement, in the<br>
preferred embodiment the voltage of the low temperature battery pack is<br>
approximately equal to the voltage of the high temperature battery pack.<br>
[0031] In certain embodiments, a lithium ion battery pack is located within<br>
a cabin of the vehicle (e.g., inside the passenger cabin) such that it can be<br>
subjected to cabin heating and/or cooling. Accordingly, even in extremely<br>
cold environments, the temperature of the lithium ion battery pack can be<br>
brought into its nominal operating temperature range using the onboard<br>
heating system of the host vehicle. In addition, operation of double ended<br>
inverter system 200 will raise the temperature of the lithium ion battery pack<br>
after the vehicle is started in cold environments.<br>
[0032] The AC electric traction motor 202, in one embodiment, is a three<br>
phase motor that includes a set of three windings (or coils) 214, each<br>
corresponding to one phase of AC electric traction motor 202, as is commonly<br>
understood. In one embodiment, the neutral point of AC electric traction<br>
motor 202 is opened up to make it a six terminal, three phase motor. Although<br>
not illustrated, AC electric traction motor 202 includes a stator assembly<br>
(including the coils) and a rotor assembly (including a ferromagnetic core), as<br>
will be appreciated by one skilled in the art.<br>
[0033] For this embodiment, first inverter subsystem 208 and second<br>
inverter subsystem 210 each includes six switches (e.g., semiconductor<br>
devices, such as transistors) with antiparallel diodes (i.e., the direction of<br>
current through the transistor switch is opposite to the direction of allowable<br>
current through the respective diode). As shown, the switches in a section 216<br>
of first inverter subsystem 208 are arranged into three pairs (or legs): pairs<br>
218, 220, and 222. Similarly, the switches in a section 224 of second inverter<br>
subsystem 210 are arranged into three pairs (or legs): pairs 226, 228, and 230.<br><br>
A first winding in the set of windings 214 is electrically coupled, at opposing<br>
ends thereof, between the switches of pair 218 (in section 216) and the<br>
switches of pair 226 (in section 224). A second winding in the set of windings<br>
214 is coupled between the switches of pair 220 (in section 216) and the<br>
switches of pair 228 (in section 224). A third winding in the set of windings<br>
214 is coupled between the switches of pair 222 (in section 216) and the<br>
switches of pair 230 (in section 224). Thus, one end of each winding is<br>
coupled to first inverter subsystem 208, and the opposite end of each winding<br>
is coupled to second inverter subsystem 210.<br>
[0034] First inverter subsystem 208 and second inverter subsystem 210 are<br>
configured to drive AC electric traction motor 202, individually or collectively<br>
(depending upon the particular operating conditions). In this regard, controller<br>
212 is suitably configured to influence the operation of first inverter<br>
subsystem 208 and second inverter subsystem 210 to manage power transfer<br>
among low temperature battery subsystem 204, high temperature battery<br>
subsystem 206, and AC electric traction motor 202. The controller 212 is<br>
responsive to commands received from the driver of the vehicle (e.g., via an<br>
accelerator pedal) and provides control signals or commands to section 216 of<br>
first inverter subsystem 208 and to section 224 of second inverter subsystem<br>
210 to control the output of sections 216 and 224. High frequency pulse width<br>
modulation (PWM) techniques may be employed to control sections 216 and<br>
224 and to manage the voltage produced by sections 216 and 224.<br>
[0035] Referring also to FIG. 1, vehicle 100 is operated by providing<br>
power to wheels 106 via the AC electric traction motor, which receives its<br>
operating energy from low temperature battery subsystem 204 and/or high<br>
temperature battery subsystem 206. In order to power the motor, DC power is<br>
provided from low temperature battery subsystem 204 and high temperature<br>
battery subsystem 206 to first inverter subsystem 208 and second inverter<br>
subsystem 210, respectively, which convert the DC power into AC power, as<br>
is commonly understood in the art. In certain embodiments, if the motor does<br>
not require the maximum power output of low temperature battery subsystem<br><br>
204, the extra power from low temperature battery subsystem 204 may be<br>
used to charge high temperature battery subsystem 206. Similarly, if the<br>
motor does not require the maximum power output of high temperature battery<br>
subsystem 206, the extra power from high temperature battery subsystem 206<br>
may be used to charge low temperature battery subsystem 204. Of course,<br>
under certain operating conditions, controller 212 can be utilized to drive the<br>
motor using energy from both energy sources.<br>
[0036] In operation, controller 212 receives a torque command for AC<br>
electric motor 202, and determines how best to manage the flow of power<br>
between low temperature battery subsystem 204 and first inverter subsystem<br>
208, and between high temperature battery subsystem 206 and second inverter<br>
subsystem 210. In this manner, controller 212 also regulates the manner in<br>
which first inverter subsystem 208 and second inverter subsystem 210 drive<br>
AC electric motor 202. Double ended inverter system 200 may utilize any<br>
suitable control methodology, protocol, scheme, or technique. For example,<br>
certain aspects of the techniques and technologies described in United States<br>
Patent numbers 7,154,237 and 7,199,535 (both assigned to General Motors<br>
Corporation) may be employed by double ended inverter system 200. The<br>
relevant content of these patents is incorporated by reference herein.<br>
[0037] For the embodiment described here, controller 212 is also suitably<br>
configured to regulate whether low temperature battery subsystem 204 is the<br>
primary energy source, high temperature battery subsystem 206 is the primary<br>
energy source, or whether both contribute energy to drive AC electric traction<br>
motor 202. For instance, under certain circumstances controller 212 operates<br>
to drive AC electric traction motor 202 primarily with low temperature battery<br>
subsystem 204 until high temperature battery subsystem 206 reaches its<br>
normal operating temperature range. This situation occurs when the<br>
temperature of high temperature battery subsystem 206 is below its normal<br>
operating range, and when the temperature of low temperature battery<br>
subsystem 204 is within its normal operating range After high temperature<br>
battery subsystem 206 reaches its normal operating temperature range (e.g., by<br><br>
heating of the vehicle cabin or by internal operating heat), controller 212 can<br>
drive AC electric traction motor 202 primarily with high temperature battery<br>
subsystem 206.<br>
[0038] In practice, the vehicle may include a battery controller, which may<br>
be separate from or integrated with controller 212. (typically, it will be<br>
separate). The battery controller is suitably configured to monitor the<br>
temperature and state of charge information (along with other information,<br>
such as cell balancing). The battery controller can analyze and/or process<br>
such information and provide a power capability to the vehicle controller. The<br>
vehicle controller processes the information obtained from the battery<br>
controller, along with driver commands, to determine how best to meet the<br>
driver's request and satisfy any subsystem requests such as power balancing<br>
between the two energy sources.<br>
[0039] FIG. 3 is a schematic circuit representation of an alternate<br>
embodiment of a double ended inverter system 300 suitable for use with an<br>
electric or hybrid electric vehicle. In certain embodiments, double ended<br>
inverter system 116 (shown in FIG. 1) can be implemented in this manner. As<br>
depicted in FIG. 3, double ended inverter system 300 is coupled to, and<br>
cooperates with, an AC electric traction motor 302, a power battery subsystem<br>
304, and an energy battery subsystem 306. Double ended inverter system 300<br>
generally includes, without limitation: a first inverter subsystem 308 coupled<br>
to power battery subsystem 304; a second inverter subsystem 310 coupled to<br>
energy battery subsystem 306, and a controller 312 coupled to first inverter<br>
subsystem 308 and to second inverter subsystem 310. Double ended inverter<br>
system 300 is similar to double ended inverter system 200 and, for the sake of<br>
brevity, common elements, features, and functions will not be redundantly<br>
described here in the context of double ended inverter system 300.<br>
[0040] Double ended inverter system 300 allows AC electric traction<br>
motor 302 to be powered by different battery types having disparate<br>
power/energy delivery characteristics. This topology enables the vehicle to<br>
take advantage of better performance characteristics of different battery types<br><br>
without having to compromise by using a single battery. For this particular<br>
embodiment, power battery subsystem 304 has a relatively high voltage and a<br>
relatively low amp-hours rating, while energy battery subsystem 306 has a<br>
relatively medium-to-high voltage and a relatively high amp-hours rating. In<br>
practice, power battery subsystem 304 is suitably configured to provide energy<br>
needed to support short duration peak power events, such as acceleration of<br>
the vehicle. Conversely, energy battery subsystem 306 is suitably configured<br>
to provide energy needed to sustain continuous and somewhat steady load<br>
conditions, such as "cruising" of the vehicle at a somewhat constant speed.<br>
Thus, power battery subsystem 304 can support effective operation of AC<br>
electric traction motor 302 under some conditions, and energy battery<br>
subsystem 306 can support effective operation of AC electric traction motor<br>
302 under other conditions.<br>
[0041] In one embodiment, power battery subsystem 304 includes a lead<br>
acid or NiMH battery pack having a nominal DC voltage of about 200-350<br>
volts (typically, about 300 volts), and having a typical energy rating of about<br>
1-2 kWh. In contrast, energy battery subsystem 306 can be realized as a<br>
lithium ion battery pack having a nominal DC voltage of about 200-350 volts<br>
(typically, about 300 volts), and having a typical energy rating of about 10-20<br>
kWh. Although not a requirement, in the preferred embodiment the voltage of<br>
power battery subsystem 304 is usually higher than the voltage of energy<br>
battery subsystem 306. In practice, the voltage of power battery subsystem<br>
304 is typically no greater than twice the voltage of energy battery subsystem<br>
306.<br>
[0042] For the embodiment described here, controller 312 is suitably<br>
configured to regulate whether power battery subsystem 304 is the primary<br>
energy source, energy battery subsystem 306 is the primary energy source, or<br>
whether both contribute energy to drive AC electric traction motor 302. For<br>
instance, under certain circumstances controller 312 operates to drive AC<br>
electric traction motor 302 primarily with energy battery subsystem 306<br>
during continuous loading events associated with operation of the vehicle.<br><br>
Such continuous loading events include, without limitation: operation of the<br>
vehicle at a constant speed; operation of the vehicle while stationary;<br>
contributing some energy during acceleration; or accepting some energy<br>
during braking events. In addition, controller 312 is configured to drive AC<br>
electric traction motor 302 primarily with power battery subsystem 304 during<br>
short duration peak power events associated with operation of the vehicle.<br>
Such short duration peak power events include, without limitation:<br>
acceleration of the vehicle; initial startup of the vehicle; braking (during which<br>
it may be desirable to use regenerative braking energy to recharge power<br>
battery subsystem 304); or a rapid charge event associated with an external<br>
charger.<br>
[0043] In practice, the vehicle controller would determine how best to<br>
operate the vehicle to meet driver requests while maximizing fuel economy. It<br>
receives input from other control subsystems on the vehicle. Controller 312<br>
provides some of this information, such as what the motor can provide, based<br>
on temperature, speed, and voltage available. The vehicle controller can then<br>
process this information in an appropriate manner and then instruct controller<br>
312 as needed. In this manner, the double ended inverter can be controlled to<br>
accommodate different modes of operation and, in turn, determine which<br>
battery is more appropriate.<br>
[0044] The double ended inverter topologies described above can be<br>
employed to interface two different energy sources (e.g., batteries) having<br>
different and disparate operating characteristics for controlled and managed<br>
operation in combination with an AC traction motor of an electric or hybrid<br>
electric vehicle. These double ended inverter topologies facilitate the use of<br>
existing and available batteries in a manner that takes better advantage of the<br>
individual performance capabilities of each battery.<br>
