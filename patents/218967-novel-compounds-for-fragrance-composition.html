This invention relates to novel compounds having musk characteristics, their manufacture and their use in fragrance compositions.<br>
Conventional compounds having musk characteristics have been selected from nitro arenes, polycyclic aromatics and macrocyclic compounds. However, in recent years there has been great activity to find novel compounds having musk characteristics to replace these conventional musks, the use of which is becoming more restricted because of, e.g. environmental concerns.<br>
Already more than ten years ago the first alicyclic compounds having musk characteristics have been described, exemplified by the product HelvetolideÂ® (4-(3,3-dimethyl-1-cyclohexyl)-2,2-dimethyl-3-oxapentyl propionate, trademark of Firmenich SA, Switzerland).<br>
Surprisingly, we now found certain aliphatic carbonyl compounds that have musk characteristics and a high impact in perfume formulations. This new class of    , / compounds has not been described beford in the literature.<br>
Thus, the present invention refers in a first aspect to a compound of formula I<br><br>
wherein<br>
R1 and R3 are independently hydrogen, methyl, or ethyl;<br>
R2 is hydrogen, methyl, ethyl, methylene, or ethylidene;<br>
R4 is C1 to C4 alkyl, for example methyl, ethyl, /-propyl, n-propyl, cyclopropyl, sec- butyl,<br>
n-butyl, tert-butyl, or cyclobutyl; or<br><br>
R4 is vinyl or a linear, branched or cyclic C3 to C4 alkenyl, for example propen-1-yl,<br>
propen-2-yl, prop-2-en-1-yl, cyclobut-1-en-1-yl, butenyl, e.g. but-1-en-1-yl, or butadiene;<br>
X is carbonyl or a divalent radical -(CMe2)-;<br>
Y is oxygen or a divalent radical -(CH2)-;<br>
the bond between C-2 and R2is a single bond, and the bond between C-2 and C-3<br>
together with the dotted line represents a double bond; or<br>
the bond between C-2 and C-3 is a single bond, and the bond between C-2 and R2<br>
together with the dotted line represents a double bond; or<br>
the bond between C-2 and R2is a single bond and the bond between C-2 and C-3 is a<br>
single bond.<br>
The compounds according to the present invention comprise one or more chiral centres and as such may exist as a mixture of stereoisomers, or they may be resolved as isomerically pure forms. Resolving stereoisomers adds to the complexity of manufacture and purification of these compounds and so it is preferred to use the compounds as mixtures of their stereoisomers simply for economic reasons. However, if it is desired to prepare individual stereoisomers, this may be achieved according to methodology known in the art, e.g. preparative HPLC and GC or by stereoselective syntheses.<br>
Preferred compounds are unsaturated aliphatic carbonyl compounds of formula I, i.e. compounds of formula I wherein the bond between C-2 and R^is a single bond, and the bond between C-2 and C-3 together with the dotted line represents a double bond; or the bond between C-2 and C-3 is a single bond, and the bond between C-2 and R^ together with the dotted line represents a double bond, e.g. acetic acid 2'-methyl-2'-(1",2",4"-trimethylpent-2"-enyloxy)propyl ester, propionic acid 2"-methyl-2'-(1",2",4"-trimethylpent-2"-enyloxy)-propyl ester, cyclopropanecarboxylic acid 2'-methyl-2'-(1",2",4"-trimethylpent-2"-enyloxy)propyl ester, butyric acid 2'-methyl-2'-(1",2",4"-trimethylpent-2"-enyloxy)propyl ester, isobutyric acid 2'-methyl-2'-(1",2",4"-trimethylpent-2"-enyloxy)propyl ester, 2-methylacryHc acid 2'-methyl-2'-(1",2",4"-trimethylpent-2"-enyloxy)propyl ester, but-2-enoic acid 2'-methyl-2'-(1 ",2",4"-trimethylpent-2"-enyloxy)propyl ester, but-3-enoic acid 2'-methyl-2'-(1",2",4"-trimethylpent-2"-enyloxy)propyl ester, propionic acid (1",2",4"-trimethylpent-2"-enyloxy)carbonylmethyl ester, 6-methyl-6-(1 ',2',4'-trimethylpent-2'-enyloxy)heptan-3-one, propionic acid 2'-methyl-2'-(1",4",4"-trimethylpent-2"-enyloxy)-propyl ester.<br><br>
f<br>
cyclopropanecarboxylic acid 2'-methyl-2'-(1 ",4",4"-trimethylpent-2"-enyloxy)propyl ester, butyric acid 2'-methyl-2'-(1",4",4"-trimethylpent-2"-enyloxy)propyl ester, 4-oxopentanoic acid 1',4',4'-trimetliylpent-2'-enyl ester, propionic acid 2'-(1",4"-dimethylpent-2"-enyloxy)-2'-methylpropyl ester and cyclopropanecarboxylic acid 2'-(1 ",4"-dimethylpent-2"-enyloxy)-2'-methylpropyl ester.<br>
Particular preferred compounds of formula I are represented by the general formula<br><br>
wherein<br>
R1 and R2 are independently hydrogen or methyl;<br>
R4 is C1 to C4 alkyl, for example methyl, ethyl, /-propyl, n-propyl, cyclopropyl, sec- butyl,<br>
n-butyl, tert-butyl, or cyclobutyl; or<br>
R4 is vinyl or a linear, branched or cyclic C3 to C4 alkenyl, for example propen-1-yl,<br>
propen-2-yl, prop-2-en-1-yl, cycloprop-1-en-1-yl, cycloprop-2-en-1-yl, cyclobut-2-en-1-<br>
yl, butenyl, e.g. but-1-en-1-yl, or butadiene.<br>
Compounds of formula I wherein the bond between C-2 and R2is a single bond, and the bond between C-2 and C-3 together with the dotted line represents a double bond are preferred in their (2"E)-configuration. As illustrated in the examples the compounds in their (2"E)-configuration possess a more intense odour than the compounds in the corresponding (2"Z)-configuration.<br>
Thus, the present invention refers in a further aspect to compound of formula I wherein the bond between C-2 and R2 is a single bond, and C-2 and C-3 together with the dotted line represents a double bond, enriched in one of the double bond isomers, i.e. (E)- or (Z)-configurated double bond.<br>
The term "enriched" is used herein for a compound having an isomeric purity of over 1:1 in favour of the selected double bond isomer. Compounds are preferred having a purity of about 55:45 or greater, e.g. about 70:30.<br><br><br>
The compounds according to the present invention may be used alone or in combination with known odourant molecules selected from the extensive range of natural and synthetic molecules currently available, such as essential oils, alcohols, aldehydes and ketones, ethers and acetals, esters and lactones, macrocycles and heterocycles, and/or in admixture with one or more ingredients or excipients conventionally used in conjunction with odourants in fragrance compositions, for example carrier materials, and other auxiliary agents commonly used in the art.<br>
The following list comprises examples of known odourant molecules, which may be combined with the compounds of the present invention:<br>
-	ethereal oils and extracts, e.g. castoreum, costus root oil, oak moss absolute,<br>
geranium oil, jasmine absolute, patchouli oil, rose oil, sandalwood oil or ylang-ylang<br>
oil;<br>
-	alkohols, e.g. citronellol, Ebanolâ¢, eugenol, geraniol. Super Muguetâ¢, linalool,<br>
phenylethyl alcohol, Sandaloreâ¢, terpineol or Timberolâ¢.<br>
-	aldehydes and ketones, e.g. a-amylcinnamaldehyde, Georgywoodâ¢,<br>
hydroxycitronellal, Iso E SuperÂ®, IsoraldeineÂ®, HedioneÂ®, maltol, methyl cedryl<br>
ketone, methylionone or vanillin;<br>
-	ether and acetals, e.g. Ambroxâ¢, geranyl methyl ether, rose oxide or Spirambreneâ¢.<br>
-	esters and lactones, e.g. benzyl acetate, cedryl actetate, y-decalactone, HelvetolideÂ®, y-undecalactone or vetivenyl acetate.<br><br>
-	macrocycles, e.g. ambrettolide, ethylene brassylate or ExaltolideÂ®.<br>
-	heterocycles, e.g. isobutylchinoline.<br>
However, due to their unique character, the compounds of formula I are especially well suited for use in fresh musky accords, woody-spicy or floral-hesperidic compositions as is more specifically illustrated in the Example.<br><br><br>
The compounds of the present invention may be used in a broad range of fragrance applications, e.g. in any field of fine and functional perfumery, such as perfumes, household products, laundry products, body care products and cosmetics. The compounds can be employed in wide ranging amounts depending upon the specific application and on the nature and quantity of other odourant Ingredients that may be, for example, from about 0.001 to about 20 weight percent. In one embodiment compounds of the present invention may be employed in a fabric softener in an amount of about 0.001 to 0.05 weight percent. In another embodiment compounds of the present invention may be used in an alcoholic solution in amounts of about 0.1 to 20 weight percent, more preferably between about 0.1 and 5 weight percent. However, these values should not be limiting on the present invention, since the experienced perfumer may also achieve effects or may create novel accords with lower or higher concentrations.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be employed into the fragrance application simply by direct mixing the fragrance composition with the fragrance application, or they may, in an earlier step be entrapped with an entrapment material, for example, polymers, capsules, microcapsules and nanocapsules, liposomes, precursors, film formers, absorbents such as for example by using carbon or zeolites, cyclic oligosaccharides and mixtures thereof, or they may be chemically bound to substrates which are adapted to release the fragrance molecule upon application of an exogenous stimulus such as light, enzyme, or the like, and then mixed with the application.<br>
Thus, the invention additionally provides a method of manufacturing a fragrance application, comprising the incorporation of a compound of formula I as a fragrance ingredient, either by directly admixing the compound of formula I to the application or by admixing a fragrance composition comprising a compound of formula I, which may then be mixed to a fragrance application, using conventional techniques and methods.<br>
As used herein, "fragrance application" means any product, such as fine perfumery, e.g. perfume and Eau de Toilette; household products, e.g. detergents for dishwasher, surface cleaner; laundry products, e.g. softener, bleach, detergent; body care products, e.g. shampoo, shower gel; and cosmetics, e.g. deodorant, vanishing creme, comprising<br>

an odourant. This list of products is given by way of illustration and is not to be regarded as being in any way limiting.<br>
Compounds of formula I wherein X is a divalent radical -(CMe2)-, and Y is oxygen, i.e. oxa esters, may be synthesized by etherification of an appropriately substituted allylic alcohol with isobutylene oxide and subsequent esterification with an appropriately substituted carboxylic acid. The resulting compounds may be hydrogenated in a known manner to give further compounds of formula I.<br>
Compounds of formula I wherein X is carbonyl and Y oxygen, i.e. diesters, may be synthesized by esterification of an appropriately substituted allylic alcohol with chloroacetic acid, followed by further esterification with an appropriately substituted carboxylic acid. The resulting compounds may be hydrogenated in a known manner to give further compounds of formula I.<br>
Compounds of formula I wherein X is carbonyl and Y is a divalent radical -(CH2)-, i.e. 0x0 esters, may be prepared by esterification of an appropriately substituted allylic alcohol with an appropriately substituted 0x0 carboxylic acid, e.g. laevullnic acid.<br>
Compounds of formula I wherein X is a divalent radical -(CMe2)- and Y is a divalent radical -(CH2)-, i.e. oxa ketones, may be prepared by etherification of an appropriately substituted allylic alcohol with isobutylene oxide, subsequent oxidation to the aldehyde, followed by Wittig-Horner-Emmons reaction under conditions known to the skilled person and selective hydrogenation of the formed double bond. The resulting compounds may be further hydrogenated in a known manner to give further compounds of formula I.<br>
The aforementioned substituted allylic alcohol starting material is accessible by â eduction of an aldol-condensation product, as known in the art.<br>
=urther particulars as to reaction conditions are provided in the examples.<br>
There now follows a series of examples that illustrate the invention.<br><br>
Example 1: (2"E/Z) Acetic acid 2'-methvl-2'-(1".2".4"-trimethvlDent-2"-envloxv)DrQDvl ester<br>
Within a period of 90 min., a solution of triethyl 2-phosphonopropionate (238 g, 1.00 mol) in dimethoxyethane (DME, 150 ml) was added dropwise with stirring under an atmosphere of N2 to a solution of NaH (43.6 g, 1.00 mol) in DME (600 ml). The mixture was then heated to reflux, and after 15 mIn. at reflux temp., isobutyric aldehyde (72.1 g, 1.00 mol) was added dropwise. After a further 30 min. stirring at reflux, the mixture was poured into ice/water (1:1,1 L). AcOH (60 ml) was added, and the product was extracted with Et2O (2x 200 ml). The combined organic extracts were washed with water (400 ml) and brine (100 ml), dried (Na2SO4), and concentrated in a rotary evaporator. The resulting residue was distilled to provide at 86-75 Â°C / 27 mbar 117 g (75 %) of 2,4-dimethylpent-2-enoic acid ethyl ester.<br>
A mixture of 2,4-dimethylpent-2-enoic acid ethyl ester (116 g, 742 mmol) and KOH 85% (147 g, 2.23 mol) in water/ EtOH (1:1, 2.0 L) was refluxed for Id. The EtOH was stripped off on a rotary evaporator, and the remaining mixture was washed with Et20. The combined ethereal washings were extracted with 2 N aq. NaOH (100 ml), and all aqueous solutions were combined. Under cooling with an ice/water bath, cone. aq. H3PO4 (200 ml) was added to adjust the combined aqueous solutions to pH 3, and the product was extracted with Et20 (200 ml). The ethereal solution was washed with water (200 ml) and brine (25 ml). After drying (Na2SO4), the solvent was evaporated in a rotary evaporator to furnish 94.2 g (99%) of 2,4-dimethyl-pent-2-enoic acid.<br>
Under an atmosphere of N2, a 1.6 M solution of MeLI in Et20 (500 ml, 800 mmol) was added during 105 min. dropwise with stirring between 0-10 Â°C to a solution of 2,4-dimethylpent-2-enoic acid (41.0 g, 320 mmol) in Et20 (1.6 L). The reaction mixture was heated to reflux for 1 h, and then between 5-15 Â°C 5 N HCI (200 ml) was added dropwise. The organic layer was separated, the aqueous one extracted with Et20 (200 ml). The combined organic solutions were washed with water (200 ml) and brine (100 ml), dried (Na2S04) and concentrated in a rotary evaporator to afford crude 3,5-dimethylhex-3-en-2-one, which was taken up in Et20 (160 ml). Under N2 at room temp., this solution was added dropwise with stirring to a suspension of LAH (3.34 g, 880 mmol) in Et20 (320 ml) during 1 h. The reaction mixture was refluxed for 2 h, and then quenched between 0-5 Â°C by addition of water (10 ml) and brine (20 ml). The organic<br><br>
layer was separated and the aqueous one extracted with Et2O (100 ml). The combined ethereal extracts were washed with water (100 ml) and brine (50 ml), dried (Na2SO4), and concentrated under reduced pressure. Silica-gel FC (pentane/EtzO, 4:1, R, = 0.40) of the resulting residue provided 34.7 g (85% over 2 steps) of 3,5-dimethylhex-3-en-2-ol.<br>
At CC under N2, a 1 M solution of MeAICl2 (50 ml, 50 mmol) in hexane was added dropwise with stirring during a period of 1 h to a solution of 3,5-dimethylhex-3-en-2-ol (12.8 g, 100 mmol) and isobutylene oxide (8.65 g, 120 mmol) in cyclohexane (100 ml). The cooling bath was removed, and stirring was continued for 16 h, prior to pouring the mixture into ice/water (1:1, 100 ml). The resulting slurry was dissolved by addition of cone. aq. H3PO4, and the product extracted with Et2O (2x 100 ml). The combined organic extracts were washed with water (100 ml) and brine (25 ml), dried (Na2SO4) and concentrated in a rotary evaporator. The resulting residue was purified by silica-gel FC (pentane/EtsO, 19:1, Rf = 0.12 ) to afford 3.10 g (15%) of 2-methyl-2-(1',2',4'-trimethylpent-2'-enyloxy)propan-1-ol.<br>
At 0 "C under N2, /\/,A/-Dicyclohexylcarbodlimide (DCC,1.03 g, 5.00 mmol) was added to a stirred solution of 2-methyl-2-(1',2',4'-trimethylpent-2'-enyloxy)propan-1-ol (830 mg, 4.14 mmol), acetic acid (250 mg, 4.14 mmol) and 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine (DMAP, 50 mg, 410 mmol) in CH2CI2 (10 ml). After stirring for 1 h at room temp., the precipitate was vacuum filtrated and washed with CH2CI2. The combined filtrates were concentrated under reduced pressure, and the resulting residue was purified by silica-gel FC (pentane/Et20, 19:1, Ri = 0.36) to furnish 710 mg (71%) of the odouriferous title compound.<br>
