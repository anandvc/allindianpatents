				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a tangential indexable cutting insert<br>
and a milling cutter for use in metal cutting processes in general and for milling a<br>
square shoulder in a workpiece in particular.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Tangential cutting inserts, also known as on-edge, or lay down,<br>
cutting inserts, are oriented in an insert holder in such a manner that during a<br>
cutting operation on a workpiece the cutting forces are directed along a major<br>
(thicker) dimension of the cutting insert. An advantage of such an arrangement<br>
being that the cutting insert can withstand greater cutting forces than when<br>
oriented in such a manner that the cutting forces are directed along a minor<br>
(thinner) dimension of the cutting insert.<br>
There is disclosed in EP 0 769 341 a face milling cutter employing a<br>
double-sided indexable tangential cutting insert having a prismoidal shape with<br>
two opposed generally rectangular rake surfaces connected by side surfaces. The<br>
cutting insert has a basic "negative" geometry and therefore in order to provide<br>
the necessary clearance between the cutting insert and the workpiece, when<br>
mounted in a face-mill, the cutting insert is oriented with a negative axial rake<br>
angle. However, negative axial rake angles are disadvantageous, e.g., they have<br>
been found to be deficient in cutting efficiency for applications involving<br>
difficult to machine materials.<br>
There is disclosed in WO 96/35536 a double-sided indexable<br>
tangential cutting insert which when mounted in a face-mill has a positive axial<br>
rake angle, even when the necessary clearance between the cutting insert and the<br>
workpiece is provided. This cutting inserts presents two peripheral cutting edges<br>
for a right-hand face mill and two peripheral cutting edges for a left-hand face<br>
mill.<br>
A double-sided indexable tangential cutting insert for a boring tool<br>
head is disclosed in US 5,333,972. The insert is provided at each end with a<br>
protruding flat island. Each long cutting edge is inclined at an angle of 3°<br>
relative to the protruding flat island, defining an "insert axial rake angle".<br>
Rearward of each cutting edge is a descending land surface that merges with an<br>
increasing incident angle surface to form a chip breaker groove. Each increasing<br>
incident angle surface extends from its associated descending land surface to an<br>
adjacent island, at either the top or the bottom of the cutting insert. The cutting<br>
insert is left or right handed. It is manufactured to be right-handed and, when<br>
flipped around, is left-handed. It will be appreciated that the magnitude of the<br>
insert axial rake angle is limited for practical reasons. Any increase in the insert<br>
axial rake angle will result in an increase in the "vertical" extent of the increasing<br>
incident angle surface (see Fig. 3 of US 5,333,972) that will have an adverse<br>
effect on chip development and evacuation.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a double-sided<br>
indexable tangential cutting insert that substantially overcomes the above-<br>
mentioned problems.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a double-sided<br>
indexable tangential cutting insert having four main cutting edges, for a given<br>
direction of rotation of the milling cutter, each main cutting edge having a<br>
positive axial rake angle when mounted as an operative cutting edge in a milling<br>
cutter.<br>
It is yet a further object of the present invention to provide a double-<br>
sided indexable tangential cutting insert capable of milling a square shoulder in a<br>
workpiece.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Attention is first drawn to Figs. 1 to 6C, showing a cutting insert 10 in<br>
accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention. The cutting insert<br>
10 is tangential and indexable. The cutting insert 10 is typically manufactured by<br>
form-pressing and sintering carbide powders. The cutting insert 10 is generally<br>
rectangular in an end view and has two identical opposing end surfaces 12. Each<br>
end surface 12 has 180° rotational symmetry about a first axis A1 passing<br>
through the two end surfaces 12.<br>
A peripheral side surface 14 extends between the two opposing end<br>
surfaces 12 and comprises two opposed identical minor side surfaces 16, two<br>
opposed identical major side surfaces 18, and four opposed corner side surfaces<br>
22. Adjacent minor and major side surfaces 16, 18 merge at a common corner<br>
side surface 22. The two identical opposing major side surfaces 18 each have<br>
180° rotational symmetry about a second axis A2 passing through the opposing<br>
major side surfaces 18. The second axis A2 is perpendicular to the first axis A1.<br>
Similarly, the two identical opposing minor side surfaces 16 each have 180°<br>
rotational symmetry about a third axis A3 passing through the opposing minor<br>
side surfaces 16. The third axis A3 is perpendicular to the first axis Al and to<br>
the second axis A2. A minor plane P1 defined by the first axis A1 and the<br>
second axis A2, a major plane P2 defined by the first axis A1 and the third axis<br>
A3 and a median plane M is defined by the second axis A2 and the third axis A3.<br>
Each end surface 12 has four corners, two lowered corners 24 and two<br>
raised corners 26. The lowered corners 26 being closer to the median plane M<br>
than the raised corners 24. Each corner side surface 22 extends between a given<br>
raised corner 26 of one of the two opposing end surfaces 12 and a given lowered<br>
corner 26 of the other of one of the two opposing end surfaces 12. Each end<br>
surface 12 is provided with a projecting abutment member 28 having a projecting<br>
abutment surface 30, wherein in a side view of either major side surface 18, the<br>
projecting abutment member 28 is generally concave in form. The projecting<br>
abutment surface 30 comprises three generally flat portions, two outer portions<br>
32 with an inner portion 34 therebetween. Therefore, in a side view of either<br>
major side surface 18, each projecting abutment surface 30 lies on a concave<br>
surface S which is generally V-shaped in form.<br>
Referring to Fig. 3, it can be seen that in an end-view of the cutting<br>
insert 10 the projecting abutment surface 30 is generally rectangular in shape<br>
having two parallel long edges 36 extending between two short edges 38.<br>
Therefore, each outer flat portion 32 of the projecting abutment surface 30,<br>
extends from a respective short edge 38 to the inner flat portion 34.<br>
A peripheral edge 40 is formed at the intersection of each end surface<br>
12 and the peripheral side surface 14. For each end surface 12, the peripheral<br>
edge 40 comprises two major edges 42, formed by the intersection of the major<br>
side surfaces 18 with the end surface 12; two minor edges 44, formed by the<br>
intersection of the minor side surfaces 16 with the end surface 12; and two corner<br>
edges 42, formed by the intersection of the corner side surfaces 22 with the end<br>
surface 12.<br>
At least two sections of each peripheral edge 40 the cutting insert 10<br>
constitute cutting edges 52. Each cutting edge 52 comprises a major cutting edge<br>
54, extending along substantially the whole length of its associated major edge<br>
42; a minor cutting edge 56, extending along at least half of the length of its<br>
associated minor edge 44; and a corner cutting edge 58, associated with a raised<br>
corner 24 and at which the major and minor cutting edges 54, 56 merge.<br>
Adjacent each cutting edge 52 in the end surfaces 12 is a rake surface 60 along<br>
which chips, removed from a workpiece during a milling operation, flow.<br>
Between the rake surface 60 and the projecting abutment member 28 there is a<br>
chip groove 62. The portion of the projecting abutment member 28 adjacent the<br>
chip forming groove 62 constitutes a chip deflector 64.<br>
Referring to Fig. 3, it is seen that each minor side surface 16 is divided<br>
into two minor side sub-surfaces 70 by a join 72 where the major plane P2<br>
intersects the minor side surface 16. Each minor side sub-surface 70 extends<br>
away from the join 72 at an angle a with respect to a plane P3 passing through<br>
the join 72 and parallel to the minor plane P1. In accordance with a specific<br>
application this angle is approximately 1.5°. The cutting insert is provided with a<br>
through bore 74 extending between the major side surfaces 18 and having a bore<br>
axis B coinciding with the second axis A2.<br>
As will become apparent below, with reference to the milling cutter in<br>
accordance with the present invention, the section of the major cutting edge 54<br>
adjacent the raised corner 24 constitutes a leading end 66 of the major cutting<br>
edge 54 whereas, the section of the major cutting edge 54 adjacent the lowered<br>
corner 26 constitutes a trailing end 68 of the major cutting edge 54. As can be<br>
seen in Fig. 4, in a side view of the cutting insert 10, the projecting abutment<br>
member 28 in the region of the leading end of the major cutting edge 54 and up<br>
to and a little beyond the region of the minor plane P1, does not protrude by<br>
much above the major cutting edge 54. As a consequence, chips in this region<br>
are completely formed during a milling process. However, in the region of the<br>
trailing end 68 of the major cutting edge 54, the chip deflector 64 protrudes much<br>
further than it does in the region of the leading end 66, which can disturb the<br>
development of the chips. In order to reduce the influence of the protruding chip<br>
deflector 64 in the region of the trailing end 68, the chip deflector 64 is designed<br>
to be more distant from the major cutting edge 54 in the region of the trailing end<br>
68 than it is in the region of the leading end 66. Consequently, as can be seen in<br>
Fig. 3, in an end-view of the cutting insert 10 in accordance with the first<br>
embodiment of the present invention the long edges 36 of the projecting<br>
abutment member 28 are oriented at a small angle ß with respect to the major<br>
plane P2. In accordance with a specific application this angle is 2°. Although<br>
the shape of the major cutting edge 54 is shown in Fig. 4 to be generally straight<br>
in a side view, apart from section adjacent the trailing end 68, the major cutting<br>
edge 54 can have any desired shape. Further with reference to Fig. 4, it can be<br>
seen that in a side view of the major side surface 18, the major cutting edge 54<br>
generally slopes downwardly from the raised corner 24 to the lowered corner 26.<br>
With reference to Fig. 2, it can be seen that in a side view of the minor side<br>
surface 16, the minor edge 44 is clearly divided into two sections, a first section<br>
46 extending from the raised corner 24 to approximately the major plane P2 and<br>
a second section 48 extending from the major plane to the lowered corner 26.<br>
The first section 46 is approximately straight and is perpendicular to the major<br>
side surface 18 in a side view, see Fig. 2, and is oriented at the angle a with<br>
respect to a plane P3 in an end view, see Fig. 3. The second section 48 extends<br>
from approximately the major plane P2 slopingly towards the lowered corner 26<br>
in an end view, see Fig. 2, and is oriented at the angle a with respect to a plane<br>
P3 in an end view, see Fig. 3. It is the first section 46 of the minor edge 44 that<br>
forms the minor cutting edge 56.<br>
Attention is now drawn to Fig. 7, showing the cutting insert 10 in<br>
accordance with the present invention, in which the major side surface comprises<br>
a primary relief surface 76 adjacent the major cutting edge 54 and a secondary<br>
relief surface 78 adjacent the primary relief surface 76. This arrangement gives<br>
more flexibility in the design of the major cutting edge 54 and is particularly<br>
important when designing the major cutting edge 54 to mill a true 90° shoulder in<br>
a workpiece. The primary relief surface 76 can have a constant relief angle along<br>
the major cutting edge 54, or a variable relief angle along the major cutting edge<br>
54.<br>
Attention is now drawn to Fig. 8, showing a milling cutter 80 with an<br>
axis of rotation R, having a cutter body 82 provided with a plurality of insert<br>
pockets 84. In each insert pocket 84 a cutting insert 10 in accordance with the<br>
present invention is clamped by means of a clamping screw (not shown). The<br>
axial rake angle will generally be in the range of 5° to 20°. As can be seen, each<br>
cutting insert is seated so that there will be a clearance between a workpiece (not<br>
shown) and the cutting insert"s minor side surface 16 adjacent the milling cutter"s<br>
face 86. The structure of the insert pocket 84 is shown in detail in Fig. 9. The<br>
insert pocket 84 comprises adjacent side and rear walls 88, 90 generally transverse<br>
to a base 92. The rear wall 90 is generally convex and the side wall 88 is provided<br>
with an axial location surface 94 for abutting a given minor side surface 16 of the<br>
cutting insert 10 at an axial abutment region 96. The rear wall 90 is provided with<br>
two tangential location surfaces, a upper tangential location surface 98, adjacent the<br>
pocket side wall 88 and a lower tangential location surface 100 adjacent the<br>
milling cutter"s face 86. The two tangential location surfaces 98, 100 project<br>
outwardly from the rear wall 90 and are located on either side of a central region<br>
102 of the rear wall 90, which is correspondingly recessed relative to the<br>
tangential location surfaces 98,100. The upper tangential location surface 98 abuts<br>
an upper tangential abutment surface 104 located on the projecting abutment<br>
surface 30 of the cutting insert 10. The lower tangential location surface 100 abuts<br>
a lower tangential abutment surface 106 located on the projecting abutment surface<br>
30. Clearly, the terms "lower" and "upper" used here with respect to the projecting<br>
abutment surface 30 are used only when the cutting insert 10 is mounted in the<br>
milling cutter 80, and with respect to the orientation shown in Figs. 8 and 9.<br>
Similarly, with respect to Figs. 8 and 9, the axial abutment region 96 is located on a<br>
forward region 108 of a radially outer minor side sub-surface 110, the forward<br>
region being distal the rear wall of the insert pocket 90. As can be seen in Fig. 3,<br>
the two tangential abutment surfaces 104,106 on each projecting abutment surface<br>
30 are located on opposite sides of the minor plane. As can be seen in Fig. 2, each<br>
minor side sub-surface 70 is provided with one axial abutment region 96 adjacent<br>
a lowered corner 26. The base 92 of the insert pocket 84 is provided with a<br>
threaded bore 112 for receiving a clamping screw in order to secure the cutting<br>
insert 10 in the insert pocket 84. When the cutting insert 10 is secured in the<br>
insert pocket 84, a radially inner major side surface 20 will abut the base 92 of<br>
the insert pocket 84. Preferably, the major side surfaces 18 of the cutting insert<br>
10 are ground. Further preferably, the minor side sub-surfaces 70 are ground.<br>
With these surfaces ground, good positioning of the cutting insert 10 in the insert<br>
pocket 84 is ensured.<br>
Attention is now directed to Figs. 10 to 12C showing a cutting insert<br>
10" in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention. The<br>
cutting insert 10" in accordance with the second embodiment is almost identical<br>
to the cutting insert 10 in accordance with the first embodiment. The main<br>
difference between the two cutting inserts is in the shape 6f the projecting<br>
abutment member 28, 28". As can be seen from comparing Figs. 4 and 11, in<br>
both embodiments the projecting abutment members 28, 28" are concave in shape<br>
in a side view of the cutting insert 10, 10", that is, each projecting abutment<br>
surface 30, 30" lies on a concave surface S which is generally V-shaped in form<br>
in a side view of the cutting insert 10, 10". The difference between the two<br>
projecting abutment members 28, 28" being in their shape in an end view. Like<br>
the projecting abutment member 28 of the cutting insert 10 in accordance with<br>
the first embodiment, the projecting abutment member 28" of the cutting insert<br>
10" in accordance with the second embodiment has a projecting abutment surface<br>
30" comprising three generally flat portions, two outer flat portions 32" with an<br>
inner flat portion 34" therebetween. However, unlike the cutting insert 10 in<br>
accordance with the first embodiment, the shape of the projecting abutment<br>
member 28" in an end view of the cutting insert 10" in accordance with the<br>
second embodiment is not straight. As can be seen in Fig. 10, in an end view of<br>
the cutting insert 10" each of the two outer flat portions 32" has a median line L1,<br>
L2 that is parallel to, but offset from, the major plane P2", One median line L1<br>
being offset to one side of the major plane P2" and the other median line L2<br>
being offset to the other side of the major plane P2", with the inner flat portion<br>
34" being transverse to the major plane P2". Clearly then, in an end view of the<br>
cutting insert 10", the median lines L1, L2 of the two flat outer portions 32" are<br>
parallel, non-adjacent, and spaced apart from each other. In other words, the<br>
median lines L1, L2 of the two flat outer portions 32" are parallel, do not overlap<br>
and do not lie on a common straight line. As a consequence of this structure, the<br>
distance between the chip deflector 64" and the adjacent major cutting edge 54"<br>
remains constant along each outer flat portion 32". This is advantageous in<br>
regions where the chip deflector 64" is high above the adjacent major cutting<br>
edge 54" as shown on the right hand side in Fig. 12A.<br>
As already stated, the cutting inserts 10, 10" in accordance with the<br>
first and second embodiments are almost identical. In particular, being tangential<br>
inserts each cutting insert 10, 10" has a first major dimension D1, measured<br>
between the end surfaces 12, 12" that is greater than a minor dimension D2<br>
measured between the major side surfaces 18, 18". A second major dimension<br>
D3, measured between the minor surfaces 16, 16" is also greater than the minor<br>
dimension D2.<br>
The cutting insert 10" in accordance with the second embodiment is<br>
clamped in the milling cutter 80 in a similar way to which the cutting insert 10 in<br>
accordance with the first embodiment is clamped in the milling cutter 80. That<br>
is, the upper tangential location surface 98 of the insert pocket 84 abuts an upper<br>
tangential abutment surface 104" located on the projecting abutment surface 30" of<br>
the cutting insert 10" and the lower tangential location surface 100 of the insert<br>
pocket 84 abuts a lower tangential abutment surface 106" located on the projecting<br>
abutment surface 30". In both the first and second embodiments the upper<br>
tangential abutment surface 104, 104" and the lower tangential abutment surface<br>
106, 106" are generally flush with the projecting abutment surface 30, 30".<br>
As can be seen in Fig. 10, in an end view of the cutting insert 10" in<br>
accordance with the second embodiment, the projecting abutment member 28"<br>
has an elongated, or stretched out, "S-shape". However, as described above, the<br>
cutting insert 10" in accordance with the second embodiment is clamped in the<br>
milling cutter 80 in a similar way to which the cutting insert 10 in accordance<br>
with the first embodiment is clamped in the milling cutter 80. Clearly, other<br>
variations in the shape of the projecting abutment member 28 are acceptable in<br>
accordance with the present invention, provided that in a side view, as in Figs. 4<br>
and 11, the projecting abutment members 28, 28" are concave. This, is due to<br>
fact that the projecting abutment members 28, 28" are designed to reduce the<br>
disturbance caused to the development of the chips during a milling operation,<br>
and the rear wall 90 of the insert pocket 84 is designed correspondingly convex<br>
with two protruding abutment members 104, 106, 104", 106" in order to support<br>
the concave projecting abutment surface 30, 30".<br>
Attention is now directed to Figs. 13 to 16C showing a cutting insert<br>
10" in accordance with a third embodiment of the present invention. The cutting<br>
insert 10" in accordance with the third embodiment is almost identical to the<br>
cutting inserts 10, 10" in accordance with the first and second embodiments.<br>
The difference between the cutting insert 10" in accordance with the third<br>
embodiment and the cutting inserts 10, 10" in accordance with the first and<br>
second embodiments is in the structure of the projecting abutment member. In<br>
accordance with the third embodiment, each end surface 12" of the cutting insert<br>
10" is provided with two projecting abutment members 28"A, 28"C separated<br>
by a central recessed region 28"B. Each projecting abutment member 28"A,<br>
28"C has a projecting abutment surface 30A, 30C, wherein in a side view of<br>
either major side surface 18" of the cutting insert 10" the projecting abutment<br>
surfaces 30A, 30C at each end surface 12" lie on a concave surface S which is<br>
generally V-shaped in form.<br>
The two projecting abutment members 28"A, 28"C are located on<br>
opposite sides of the minor plane P1 of the cutting insert 10". As seen in Fig.<br>
15, a major portion of one of the projecting abutment members 28"A is located<br>
on one side of the major plane P2 of the cutting insert 10", whereas a major<br>
portion of the other one of the projecting abutment members 28"C is located on<br>
the other side of the major plane P2.<br>
The cutting insert 10" in accordance with the third embodiment is<br>
clamped in the milling cutter 80 in a similar way to which the cutting inserts 10,<br>
10" in accordance with the first and second embodiments are clamped in the<br>
milling cutter 80. That is, the upper tangential location surface 98 of the insert<br>
pocket 84 abuts an upper tangential abutment surface 104" located on one of the<br>
projecting abutment surfaces 30A of the cutting insert 10" and the lower tangential<br>
location surface 100 of the insert pocket 84 abuts a lower tangential abutment<br>
surface 106" located on the other one of the projecting abutment surfaces 30C.<br>
The upper and lower tangential abutment surfaces 104", 106" are generally flush<br>
with their respective projecting abutment surfaces 30A, 30C.<br>
Although the present invention has been described to a certain degree<br>
of particularity, it should be understood that various alterations and modifications<br>
could be made without departing from the scope of the invention as hereinafter<br>
