It has now surprisingly been found that the compounds of general formula I are CRF receptor antagonists. Compounds of formula I are distinguished by having valuable therapeutic properties. They can be used in the treatment or prevention of CRF receptor mediated disorders.<br>
Corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) or hormone (CRH) is one of several neurohormones synthesized by specific hypothalamic nuclei in the brain where it activates the transcription of the pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) gene resulting in release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and beta-endorphin from anterior pituitary cells (Vale et al, Science 213, 1394-1397 (1981)). The fundamental role of CRF is to prepare the organism for an appropriate response to various stressors such as physical trauma, insults of the immune system and social interactions. CRF also has CNS effects by acting at higher centers in the brain, particularly cortical regions where there is a widespread distribution of CRF neurons. CRF is believed to be a key intermediary in communication between the immune, central nervous, endocrine and cardiovascular systems (Sapolsky et al, Science 238, 522-524 (1987)). The role played by CRF in integrating the response of the immune system to physiological, psychological and immunological stressors has been described in the art, e.g. J.E. Blalock, Physiological Reviews 69, 1 (1989) and J.E. Morley, Life Sci-. 41, 527 (1987).<br>
CRF is a primary hormone controlling the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. CRF exerts it pharmacological activity through at least two distinct G-protein coupled receptor subtypes which differ in their anatomical distribution and in their response to peptide ligands. Various splice modifications of these two subtypes have been observed (J. Saunders and J. P. Williams New Developments in the Study of Corticotropin Releasing Factor, Ann. Rep. Med, Chem. 2001 36:21-30).The first CRF receptor antagonists were peptides (see, e.g., Rivier et al, U.S. Pat. No. 4,605,642; Rivier et al, Science 1984 224:889). While these peptides established that CRF receptor antagonists can attenuate the pharmacological responses to CRF, peptide CRF receptor antagonists suffer from the usual drawbacks of peptide therapeutics including lack of stability and limited oral activity. More recently, small molecule CRF receptor antagonists have been reported (Saunders and Williams, supra; D. E. Grigoriadis et al, The CRF Receptor: Structure,<br><br>
Function and Potential for Therapeutic Intervention, Cum Med. Chem. -Central Nervous System Agents 2001 1:63-97; D. A. Gutman et al Corticotropin-releasing factor antagonists as novel psychotherapeutics, Drugs of the Future 2000 25(9):923-31).<br>
CRF antagonists are effective in the treatment of a wide range of stress-related illnesses, mood disorders such as depression, major depressive disorder, single episode depression, recurrent depression, child abuse induced depression, postpartum depression, dysthemia, bipolar disorder and cyclothymia; chronic fatigue syndrome; eating disorders such as obesity, anorexia and bulimia nervosa; generalized anxiety disorder; panic disorder; phobias; obsessive-compulsive disorder; post-traumatic stress disorder; pain perception such as fibromyalgia; headache; stress-induced gastrointestinal dysfunction such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), colonic hypersensitivity or spastic colon; hemorrhagic stress; ulcers; stress-induced psychotic episodes; inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis; asthma; psoriasis; allergies; premature birth; hypertension; congestive heart failure; sleep disorders; neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, senile dementia, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease; head or spinal cord trauma; ischemic neuronal damage; excitotoxic neuronal damage; epilepsy; stroke; psychosocial dwarfism; chemical dependencies and addictions; drug and alcohol withdrawal symptoms; stress-induced immune dysfunctions; immune suppression and stress-induced infections; cardiovascular or heart related diseases; fertility problems; and /or human immunodeficiency virus infections. Accordingly clinical data suggests that CRF receptor antagonists may represent novel antidepressants and/or anxiolytic drugs that may be useful in the treatment of the neuropsychiatric disorders manifesting hypersecretion of CRF.<br>
5,8-Dihydro-6H-pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-7-ones have been reported with a variety of pharmacological activities. WO 200259083 (J. L. Adams etal) discloses 5,8-dihydro-6H-pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-7-one compounds which are p38 kinase. WO2001055148 (R. J. Booth et al) and WO 98 33798 (D. H. Boschelli et al) report related compounds with cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitory activity. WO 98 01428 (C. Dominguez etal) disclose amidinoindoles, amidinoazoles and analogs as inhibitors of Factor Xa and of thrombin.<br>
While significant strides have been made toward achieving CRF regulation by administration of CRF receptor antagonists, there remains a need in the art for efficacious and selective small molecule CRF receptor antagonists. There is also a need for pharmaceutical compositions containing such CRF receptor antagonists, as well as<br><br>
methods relating to the use thereof to treat, for example, stress-related disorders. The present invention fulfills these needs, and provides other related advantages.<br>

Moreover, the invention also relates to a medicament containing one or more compounds of the invention and pharmaceutically acceptable excipients for the treatment and prevention of CRF receptor mediated disorders such as phobias, stress-related illnesses, mood disorders, eating disorders, generalized anxiety disorders, stress-induced gastrointestinal dysfunctions, neurodegenerative diseases, and neuropsychiatric disorders.<br>

[4-Methyl-7-(l-propyl-butyl)-6,7-dihydrO"5H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-2-yl]-(2,4,6-trimethyl-phenyl)-amine (VIII) is prepared by se C1-6uentially elaborating a substituted pyrimidine ring containing the elements re C1-6uired for subse C1-6uent formation of the fused dihydropyrrole ring. The Principal Synthesis provides and extremely general approach to  preparing the pyrimidine ring. The Principal synthesis entails condensation of two three-<br><br>
atom fragments. One fragment is a Î²-dicarbonyl compound. The carbonyls may be composed of ketones, aldehydes, carboxylic acid derivatives or nitriles. The second three atom segment is amidine which can be replaced by a urea, thiourea or guanidine. The range of e C1-6uivalents capable of undergoing this reaction affords significant flexibility in the preparation of substituted pyrimidines. (D. J. Brown Pyrimidines and their benzo Derivatives in Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry, A. J. Boulton and A. McKillop (ed) vol. 3 part 2b, chap. 2.13, Pergamon Press, Oxford 1984 pp. 57-157; D. J. Brown, The Pyrimidines, Supplement II in The Chemistry of Heterocyclic Compounds, A. Weissberger and E. C. Taylor (ed), Wiley Interscience, New York 1985, pp. 21-62)<br>
In the present case the 2 arylamino-substituted pyrimidines can be directly prepared by utilization of an aryl guanidine in the cyclization step. Aryl guanidines are readily prepared from aryl amines (I. A. Cliffe Functional Groups Containing an Iminocarbonyl Group and Any Element Other than A Halogen or Chalogen in Comprehensive Functional Group Transformations, Vol 6, T. L. Gilchrist (ed) Pergamon Press, Oxford, 1995, pp. 640-42) In step (i) an appropriately substituted aryl amine is converted to the corresponding guanidinium hydrochloride salt by condensation with cyanamid.<br>
Step (b) exemplifies the Principal pyrimidine synthesis wherein a 2-arylaminopyrimidine is prepared by cyclization of the guanidine and 2-acetylbutyrolactone which introduces the desired 2-arylamino and 4-methyl substituents onto the pyrimidine ring in addition to the hydroxy ethyl moiety and the 6-hydroxy group which ultimately is cyclized to produce the fused pyrrolidine. One skilled in the art will readily appreciate that 2-acetylbutyrolactone formally is simply a 2-substituted acetoacetic acid derivative and the pyrimidine synthesis can be accomplished with variety of side chains which can alter the sized and substitution on the heterocyclic ring fused to the pyrimidine.<br>
Hydroxy pyrimidines can be converted to halopyrimidines by treating the pyrimidinone with a phosphoryl halide, a phosphorus pentahalide, a phosphorus trihalide or mixtures thereof. Tertiary amine bases are sometimes used as catalysts for the halogenation. The halogenation reaction can be run in the presence of a variety of functional groups without interference (Brown Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry, supra pl39-140). In step (b) two chlorinations are carried out by se C1-6uential treatment of the diol VI with (a) thionyl chloride at room temperature which converts the hydroxyethyl side chain to the corresponding chloroethyl side chain and (&amp;) phosphorus oxychloride at reflux which<br><br>
results in the conversion of the heteroaryl hydroxy substituent to the heteroaryl chloro moiety.<br>
Amine substituents are readily introduced into a pyrimidine by displacement of leaving groups on the pyrimidine (Brown Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry, supra p. 129-133). Among the leaving groups which can be employed are halogen, mercapto, alkylthio, alkylsulfonyl, alkylsulfinyl and alkoxy. Halogen and alkylsulfonyl are the most efficient leaving groups. Reactivity is generally 4 or 6 halo , 2-halo Â» 5-halo. In step (d) the dichloro intermediate is treated with a primary amine which capable of displacing both the aliphatic chloride and the heteroaryl chloride thereby resulting in closure of the pyrrolidine ring.<br>
Optionally in step (e) the secondary amine can be converted to a tertiary amine by formation of the amine salt and alkylation with the desired alkyl halide (J. March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York 1992, pp. 411-413). The product can either be a free base or an acid addition salt.<br>
The following compounds were prepared as described in Scheme 1 by selection of the appropriate aryl amine in step (a) and the appropriate primary amine in step (e).<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-7-ones were prepared as shown in Scheme 2. In step (b) the Principal Synthesis was carried out with diethyl 2-acetylglutarate to incorporate a three-carbon carborylic acid side chain at the 5-position of the pyrimidine XI. After conversion of the 6-hydroxy to a 6-chloro analogue with phosphorus oxychloride in step (c), condensation with a primary amine proceeds to afford a pyrimidone XIII.<br>
In step (e) the lactam was reduction with BH3-THF to afford the corresponding tertiary amine XIV. In addition to BH3-THF, reduction of amides to amines can be carried out with lithium aluminum hydride diisobutylaluminum hydride or other hydride reducing agents. Sodium borohydride is less generally useful. Reductions with hydride reducing agents are usually run in aprotic solvents such as diethyl ether, THF and dimethoxyethane. Catalytic hydrogen also may be utilized for the reduction of amides but high temperature and pressure are typically re C1-6uired. (J. March, supra p.1212-13).

When desired, formulations can be prepared with enteric coatings adapted for sustained or controlled release administration of the active ingredient. For example, the compounds of the present invention can be formulated in transdermal or subcutaneous      drug delivery devices. These delivery systems are advantageous when sustained release of the compound is necessary and when patient compliance with a treatment regimen is crucial. Compounds in transdermal delivery' systems are fre C1-6uently attached to an skin-<br><br>
adhesive solid support. The compound or interest can penetration enhancer, e.g., Azone (l-dodecylaza-cydoheptan-2-one). Sustained release delivery systems are inserted subcutaneously into to the subdermal layer by surgery or injection. The subdermal implants encapsulate the compound in a lipid soluble membrane, e.g., silicone rubber, or a biodegradable polymer, e.g., polylactic acid.<br>
Suitable formulations along with pharmaceutical carriers, diluents and excipients are described in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy 1995, edited by E. W. Martin, Mack Publishing Company, 19th edition, Easton, Pennsylvania. A skilled formulation scientist may modify the formulations within the teachings of the specification to provide numerous formulations for a particular route of administration without rendering the compositions of the present invention unstable or compromising their therapeutic activity.<br>
The modification of the present compounds to render them more soluble in water or other vehicle, for example, may be easily accomplished by minor modifications (salt formulation, esterification, etc.), which are well within the ordinary skill in the art. It is also well within the ordinary skill of the art to modify the route of administration and dosage regimen of a particular compound in order to manage the pharmacokinetics of the present compounds for maximum beneficial effect in patients.<br>
The term "therapeutically effective amount" as used herein means an amount re C1-6uired to reduce symptoms of the disease in an individual. The dose will be adjusted to the individual re C1-6uirements in each particular case. That dosage can vary within wide limits depending upon numerous factors such as the severity of the disease to be treated, the age and general health condition of the patient, other medicaments with which the patient is being treated, the route and form of administration and the preferences and experience of the medical practitioner involved. For oral administration, a daily dosage of between about 0.01 and about 100 mg/kg body weight per day should be appropriate in monotherapy and/or in combination therapy. -A preferred daily dosage is between about 0.1 and about 500 mg/kg body weight, more preferred 0.1 and about 100 mg/kg body weight and most preferred 1.0 and about 10 mg/kg body weight per day. Thus, for administration to a 70 kg person, the dosage range would be about 7 mg to 0.7 g per day. The daily dosage can be administered as a single dosage or in divided dosages, typically between 1 and 5 dosages per day. Generally, treatment is initiated with smaller dosages which are less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small increments until the optimum effect for the individual patient is<br><br>
reached. One of ordinary skill in treating diseases described herein will be able, without undue experimentation and in reliance on personal knowledge, experience and the disclosures of this application, to ascertain a therapeutically effective amount of the compounds of the present invention for a given disease and patient.<br>
The term "disease state" means any disease, condition, symptom, or indication. "Treating" or "treatment" of a disease state includes: (i) preventing the disease state, i.e. causing the clinical symptoms of the disease state not to develop in a subject that may be exposed to or predisposed to the disease state, but does not yet experience or display symptoms of the disease state; (ii) inhibiting the disease state, Le., arresting the development of the disease state or its clinical symptoms, or (iii) relieving the disease state, ie.y causing temporary or permanent regression of the disease state or its clinical symptoms.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations are preferably in unit dosage forms. In such form, the preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate  C1-6uantities of the active component. The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package containing discrete  C1-6uantities of preparation, such as packeted tablets, capsules, and powders in vials or ampoules. Also, the unit dosage form can be a capsule, tablet, cachet, or lozenge itself, or it can be the appropriate number of any of these in packaged form.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions in Example 8 are given to enable those skilled in the art to more clearly understand and to practice the present invention. They should not be considered as limiting the scope of the invention, but merely as being illustrative and representative thereof.<br><br>

EXAMPLE 6<br>
CRF Receptor Binding Assay<br>
Human IMR-32 neuroblastoma cells are grown to 80% confluence in MEM medium containing 10% heat-inactivated PBS, ImM sodium pyruvate, and O.lmM nonessential amino acids. Cell membranes are prepared according the method of Dieterich and DeSouza (1996). The cells (-5E+9) are resuspended in 10 volumes of wash buffer (5 mM Tris HC1, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM EGTA, pH 7.4 at RT)&gt; homogenized with a Polytron, and then centrifuged at 45,000 G for 20 min at 4Â°C. The membrane pellets are washed twice with wash buffer (45,000 G for 20 min at 4Â°C) and then resuspended (50 mM Tris HC1, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM EGTA, pH 7.4 at RT). Protein concentration is determined using Pierce reagents and BSA as standard. Aliquots of 1-1.5 mL are stored at -80Â°C until binding assay.<br>
The competition binding assay is performed in a final volume of 250 jil, which contains assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM EGTA, 0.2% BSA, O.lmM bacitracin and 100 klU/mL aprotinin pH 7.2 at R.T.), 0.05 nM [I25I]TyrÂ°-ovine CRF (Du Pont New England Nuclear), 50 \xg of membrane protein, and test compound at various concentrations. Non-specific binding is determined with 1 uM hCRF. Binding reactions are terminated after 2 hr incubation at 25Â°C by filtering through 96-w GP/C filter plate using a Packard Harvester (Filtermate 196). The 96-w filter plate is pre-treated,with 0.3% polyethyleneimine and pre-washed with washing buffer (50 mM TrisrHCl, 10 mM MgCl2&gt; 2 mM EGTA, 0.2% BSA, pH 7.2 at 4Â°C). Unbound radioactivity is removed by four rapid washes (0.8 ml/well) with wash buffer. The radioactivity is quantified using a<br><br>
Packard TopCount Data are analyzed using non-linear iterative curve fitting to obtain IC50 and Hill slope values. pKi values are derived from pIC50 values (-log of IC50).<br><br>
EXAMPLE 7 Intracellular cAMP Stimulation Assay Human Y-79 retinoblastoma cells are grown in RPMI 1640 medium with 15% FBS. Measures of cAMP accumulation are performed by using NEN Adenylyl Cyclase FlashPlate kit (SMP004). The cells are separated from culture medium, washed twice with PBS (150 Xg, 8 min), resuspended (2E+6 cells/ml) in Stimulation Buffer (provided in the kit), and then added to 96-well FlashPlates, (50,000 cells per well). Various concentrations of test compounds are incubated with the cells for 20 min prior to the addition of hCRF (30 nM). The total assay volume is 100 |ik The assay is terminated after 20 min after addition of the hCRF by addition of Detection Buffer and [125I]cAMP. After 2 hr at room temperature the mixtures are aspirated and the bound radioactivity is measured with a Packard TopCount. The potency (IC50 values) of test compounds in inhibiting the hCRF-stimulated accumulation of cAMP is determined by nonlinear regression analyses with interactive curve-fitting procedures.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
All of the ingredients, except water, are combined and heated to about 60Â°C with stirring. A sufficient  C1-6uantity of water at about 60Â°C is then added with vigorous stirring to emulsify the ingredients, and water then added  C1-6.s. about 100 g.<br>
Nasal Spray Formulations (G) Several a C1-6ueous suspensions containing from about 0.025-0.5 percent active compound are prepared as nasal spray formulations. The formulations optionally contain inactive ingredients such as, for example, microcrystalline cellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, dextrose, and the like. Hydrochloric acid may be added to adjust pH. The nasal spray formulations may be delivered via a nasal spray metered pump typically delivering about 50-100 microliters of formulation per actuation. A typical dosing schedule is 2-4 sprays every 4-12 hours.<br>
