This invention relates to a quick release and locking device for the bowl guard and housing of the filter or lubricator of a filter-regulator-lubricator assembly fitted in an air line for use with pneumatic equipment.<br>
Pneumatic lines incorporate a filter-regulator-lubricator assembly for the purpose of filtering the air in the air line, for regulating the pressure and for lubricating the air in use.<br>
Conventionally, the filter or lubricator has a bowl and housing. The bowl has to be detached from the filter or lubricator assembly for purposes of maintenance and repair.<br>
The bowl has internal or external threads which can be engaged with the threads on the housing, to enable the bowl to be screwed on to, or unscrewed from, the housing.<br>
Alternatively, the bowl is disposed within a bowl guard. The bowl guard is threadedly engageable with,  and disengageable from,  the housing,  to<br><br>
enable the former to be screwed on to, or unscrewed from, the latter.<br>
In the above two cases, maintenance and repair operations entail avoidable loss of time in unscrewing and screwing the bowl guard in the process of opening and closing the filter or lubricator.<br>
This invention, therefore, proposes a device which enables the bowl guard (with bowl) to be quickly detached from, and as quickly, attached to, the housing, thereby not only saving man hours but also otherwise providing a facile manner of attending to maintenance and repair operations. The use of heavy hand tools, such as, pipe wrenches, which may damage the bowl/bowl guard while unscrewing and screwing, is also obviated.<br>
The quick release and locking device for the bowl guard and housing of the filter or lubricator of a filter-regulator-lubricator assembly fitted in an air line for use with pneumatic equipment, according to this invention, wherein the  filter<br><br>
and lubricator each comprise a bowl guard (with bowl) and a housing, the bowl guard being attachable to, and detachable from, the housing, is characterised in that the exterior of the bowl guard is provided with a plurality of first stepped flanges and a spring-loaded latch with a latch piece; and the interior of the housing is provided with an equal number of second stepped flanges, co-operating with the first stepped flanges, together with one or more slots for receiving the said latch piece.<br>
This invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings which illustrate, by way of example, one of the various possible embodiments of the device proposed herein,<br>
Fig.l illustrating the said embodiment assembled (part view) with the bowl guard attached to the housing;<br>
and<br>
Fig.2 illustrating the said embodiment with the housing and bowl guard detached from each other.<br><br>
The transparent bowl B is housed in the bowl guard G. The bowl guard G has, on its exterior, four first stepped flanges Fl and a spring-loaded latch L with a latch piece P. The latch piece P, normally, protrudes out of the latch L, towards the flanges Fl.<br>
The housing H, on its interior, has four coÂ¬operating second stepped flanges F2 and four slots S.<br>
After housing the bowl B inside the bowl guard G, to lock the bowl guard G to the housing H, all that has to be done is to push the bowl and bowl guard assembly into the housing, while slightly rotating the former to enable the first and second stepped flanges to engage with each other and also to enable the latch piece P to align with a slot S in the housing, so that under spring tension, the latch piece P enters the slot S in the housing and arrests any rotation of the bowl guard with respect to the housing.<br>
Each of the first stepped flanges has a detent D<br><br>
which, while carrying out the above procedure, simultaneously engages with a detent slot E in the housing.<br>
A similar procedure enables quick release of the bowl guard from the housing. In this case, the the latch piece P is first retracted by pressing the latch down. The bowl guard is then slightly lifted to disengage the detents D from the detent slots E; next, the bowl guard is rotated to disengage the first and second stepped flanges. The bowl guard can now be pulled out of the housing.<br>
The terms and expressions in this specification are of description and not of limitation, there being no intention in the use of such terms and expressions of excluding any equivalents of the features illustrated and described, but it is understood that various other embodiments of the device proposed herein are possible without departing from the scope and ambit of this invention.<br><br><br>
We Claim:<br>
l.A quick release and locking device for the bowl guard and housing of the filter or lubricator of a filter-regulator-lubricator assembly fitted in an air line for use with pneumatic equipment, wherein the filter and lubricator each comprise a bowl guard (with bowl) and a housing, the bowl guard being attachable to, and detachable from, the housing, characterised in that the exterior of the bowl guard is provided with a plurality of first stepped flanges and a spring-loaded latch with a latch piece; and the interior of the housing is provided with a an equal number of second stepped flanges, co-operating with the first stepped flanges, together with one or more slots for receiving the said latch piece.<br>
2.A device as claimed in Claim 1 wherein each of the first stepped flanges has a detent and a corresponding detent slot in the housing.<br>
3.A device as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2 wherein the said latch piece normally protrudes<br><br>
out of the latch under spring tension and is retractable on pressing the latch.<br>
4.A quick release and locking device for the bowl guard and housing of the filter or lubricator of a filter-regulator-lubricator assembly fitted in an air line for use with pneumatic equipment, substantially as herein described with reference to, and as illustrated by, the accompanying drawings.<br><br></td>
