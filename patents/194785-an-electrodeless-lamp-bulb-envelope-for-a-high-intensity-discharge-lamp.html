				<td>SPECIFICATION BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.         Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a lamp^  frit sealed ceramic housing that produces a beam of light using a fill contained under pressure within the lamp housing interior that is energized with externally placed electrodes for vaporizing the gas to form a plasma. More particularly, the present invention relates to a projecting system that features a high temperature electrodeless lamp in which light energy is generated by a plasma contained inside a frit sealed ceramic body or housing that has a concave reflector surface surrounding the lamp body interior.<br>
2.        Description of the Related Art<br>
High power lamps are used for illumination applications beyond typical incandescent, and fluorescent lamps. One type of lamp known as a high intensity discharge (HID) lamp consists of a glass envelope which contains electrodes and a fill which vaporises and becomes a gas when the lamp is operated.<br>
Recently, a patent issued for a high power lamp that utilizes a lamp fill containing sulfur or selenium or compounds of these substances. U.S. Patent 5,404,076, issued to Dolan, et al, and entitled "Lamp Including Sulfur" discloses an electrodeless lamp utilizing an excited fill. The Dolan, et al, patent 5,404,076 is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Projecting systems are used to display images on large surfaces, such as movie or television screens and computer displays. For example, in a front projection system, an image beam is projected from an image source onto the front side of a reflection-type angle transforming screen, which then reflects the light toward a viewer positioned in front of the screen In a rear projection system, the image beam is projected onto the rear side of a transmission-type angle transforming screen and transmitted toward a vicwer located in front of the screen.<br>
In prior co-pending U.S. patent application serial no 08/581,108, entitled "Projecting Images," to Knox, filed December 29, 1995, there is disclosed a method of displaying an optical<br>
-l A-<br><br>
image by projecting the image along an optical path and at an optical device interposed across the optical path, at one time reflecting the image from the optical device and at a different time permitting the image to pass through the optical device to be displayed. U.S. patent application serial no. 08/581,108, filed December 29, 1995, is incorporated herein by reference. A projection system for such a display is disclosed in U.S, application serial no. 03/730,818, entitled "Image Projection System Engine Assembly," to Knox, filed October 17, 1996, which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
The image source for a projection system employs a light that must be of high intensity and preferably very efficient. - Such a light is disclosed in U.S. patent application serial no. 08/747,190, entitled "High Efficiency Lamp Apparatus for Producing a Beam of Polarized Light," to Knox, et al., filed November 12, 1996, which is hereby incorporated by reference. If an optical image is to be displayed by projection, it sometimes passes through an optical device interposed across the optical path. In the projection system of prior co-pending application serial no. 08/581,108, filed December 29, 1995, one or more optical devices reflect the image at one time from the optical device and at a different time permit the image to pass through the optical device to be displayed. There will be a decrease in light intensity once the optical image strikes the optical device interposed across the optical path. Therefore, in projection systems where an optical device is interposed across the optical path there is a need for a projection engine with a high intensity light of improved efficiency,<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides an improved high efficiency lamp apparatus for producing an intense beam of light using a plasma light source. The apparatus includes an electrodeless lamp body, preferably of ceramic or like heat resistant material. The lamp body has a concavity that surrounds a lamp interioi.<br>
A clear glass plate seals one end portion of the housing. A fill is contained within the lamp body interior. The fill is preferably sulfur or selenium or a combination thereof that can be excited to form a plasma light source.<br>
The lamp body provides a concavity-with a reflective surface thereon. Electrodes are positioned externally of the lamn body for nroducino radio freanency for <br>
energy that enables the gas in the lamp body cavity to be excited and form the plasma light source that generates intense heat (about 80°C to 1200°C) and an intense light beam. As used herein,<br>
2<br><br><br><br><br><br>
the'term radio frequency means a frequency range sufficient to excite a fill in the bulb (e.g., about 150 MegaHertz to about 10 GigaHertz, or other suitable frequency.<br>
The clear (e.g., glass, quartz, sapphire, or any optically clear material) plate seals the gas within the  interior of the housing and allows light to escape the housing.<br>
A frit seal can.be used for a connection between the lamp body at its peripheral edge and the periphery of the glass lens. The glass lens is preferably a quartz plate or like material that is clear and which can withstand high temperature.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Figure 1 shows generally the first embodiment of the apparatus of the present invention designated generally by the numeral 10. Lamp apparatus 10 includes housing or body 11 having inner concave surface 12 and outer convex surface 13. Housing 11 provides an open end portion surrounded by annular flange 14 having inner flat surface 15 and outer surface 16.   Annular<br>
3<br><br>
shoulder 17 extends from annular flange 14. Annular shoulder 17 has inner surface 18 and outer surface 19. Housing 11 is preferably ceramic.<br>
Clear circular plate 20 is preferably of an optically clear material that is heat resistant such as glass, quartz,, or sapphire. Plate 20 is connected to lamp housing 11 at annular flange 14 and annular shoulder 17. Circular plate 20 has inner surface 21 and outer surface 22.<br>
The connection between lamp housing 11 and circular plate 20 is perfected using frit seal 23 that is positioned in between annular flange 14 at surface 15 and circular plate 20 as shown in Figure 1, A frit seal is a seal made by fusing together glass powders with a glass binder. However, Seal 23 can also be a brazing seal or a direct bond type seal 120 (see Figure 8A), melting the glass or a clear ceramic such as sapphire to the ceramic. Seal 23 could also be formed by metalizing that portion of the ceramic housing 11 and that portion of the plate 20 at the joint, then welding metal 121 to metal 122 at the metalized coatings (see Figure 8B). A connection 30 is formed between plate 20 and housing 11.<br>
An interior space 24 is defined by the concavity of housing 11 and circular plate 20. Interior 24 contains a fill medium such as a sulfur or selenium fill, or compounds of these substances. The gas contained within interior 24 is a fill that can be excited using radio frequency energy; for example, to form a plasma light source 25.<br>
Electrodes 27 and 28 are shown in Figure 1, positioned externally of lamp housing 11 and spaced away from the outer surface 13 of housing 11. Electrodes 27, 28 are thus not subjected to the intense heat of plasma light source 25.<br>
Reflecting surface 12 can be a high reflectivity ceramic surface, preferably a diffuse reflection (esg., white ceramic). This produces a collimating lamp apparatus 10 that generates light rays 29 that are generally parallel. A variety of shapes are possible other than the curved shape of housing 11 and square shape of housing 32 of Figure 2. Different shapes can be employed to force the plasma itself into different shapes or to provide different sealing properties between the clear material and the ceramic.<br>
Figure 2 discloses a second embodiment of the lamp apparatus of the present invention, designated generally by the numeral 31. Lamp apparatus 31 provides a housing 32 that has cylindrically shaped side wall 33 and flat circular end wall 34 that are integrally formed.

Lamp housing 32 has an open end 39 that is covered with a circular filter 40, such as a polarizing filter. Circular filter 40 has a peripheral surface 41 that forms a connection at 42 with lamp housing 32. Filter 40 has an inside surface 43 and an outer surface 44. Inside surface 43 connects to peripheral surface 41 of housing 32 at connection 42. Connection 42 preferably includes a frit seal. However, seal 42 can also be a brazing seal of a direct bond type seal, melting the glass to the ceramic. Seal 42 could also be formed by metalizing that portion of the ceramic housing 32 and that portion of the filter 40 at the joint, then welding metal to metal at the metalized coatings. A connection 30 is formed between filter 40 and housing 32.<br>
A second plate 45 is positioned in between a plasma light source 47 and a filter 43. Plate 45 is preferably an optically clear plate of high temperature resistant material, such as quartz, sapphire, or the like. Connection 46 designates a connection between plate 45 and cylindrical inner surface 36 of housing 32.<br>
Plasma light source 47 is formed within an interior 51 of housing 32. Interior 51 contains a fill (such as sulfur, selenium, or compounds thereof) that can be excited to form plasma light source 47. Plasma light source 47 ts not a well defined ball, but occupies the central area of interior 51.<br>
A pair of electrodes 49, 50 provide radio frequency energy that can excite the gas with interior 51 to form plasma light source 47. Interior 52 of housing 32 is that space between filter 43 and glass plate 45. Interior 52 is filled with a gaseous substance that forms an insulation layer between plate 45 and plate 43.<br>
Plate 43 can be a polarizing film filter that may not be able to withstand the intense heat generated within interior 51 of lamp housing 32. Therefore, insulating gaseous layer 52 is provided in between plates 43 and 45 to prevent heat damage to film plate 43. Light rays 53 are shown in Figure 2 as being emitted from lamp housing 32, passing through glass plate 45 and filter 43. In the embodiment of Figure 2, the light 53 is polarized having passed through the polarizing filter 43.<br>
In Figure 3, a third embodiment of the apparatus of the present invention is shown, designated by the numeral 54. Lamp apparatus 54 has cylindrical housing 55, that includes flat circular end wall 56, inside flat surface 57, inside cylindrical surface 58, and outer surface 59. The surfaces 57, 58 define with circular plate 62 an interior 60 for containing a fill that can be excited (such as oulfur or aolonium gas or compounds thereof) to form plasma light source 73. Lamp housing 55 has open end 61 that is covered by circular plate 62. Plate 62 has inner surface 70 and outer surface 71.<br>
