A LYOCELL PERFUMED FIBER AND A METHOD OF<br><br><br>
MAKING THEREOF<br>
ADITYA BIRLA SCIENCE &amp; TECHNOLOGY CO. LTD.<br>
an Indian Company of Aditya Birla Center, 2nd floor, C Wing, S. K. Ahire Marg, Mumbai 400 025,<br>
Maharashtra, India<br><br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br><br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to textile fibers.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
The term "fiber" or "textile fiber" means a substance which is capable of being spun into a yarn or made into a fabric by bonding or by interlacing in a variety of methods including weaving, knitting, braiding, felting, twisting, or webbing, and which is the basic structural element of textile products.<br>
Fibers are classified on the basis of their length such as short fibers or staple fiber and long fibers or filament fiber. The fibers can also be classified on the basis of their origin such as natural fibers and man-made fibers. The term natural fibers means any fiber that exists as such in the natural state e.g. vegetable fibers or wood fibers. The other type of fibers is obtained from chemical substances. These are called man made fibers. They are rayon, polyester, nylon, acrylic (cashmilon) etc.<br>
For centuries, mankind has relied upon various plants and animals to provide raw materials for fabrics and clothing. In recent times, the industrialization and scientific advancement has provided several improved materials having far superior properties, particularly suitable for clothing.<br>
Lyocell is a manmade fiber derived from cellulose. Though it is related to rayon, lyocell is obtained by a solvent spinning technique. The solvent spinning technique, which is simpler and more environmentally sound, since it uses a non-toxic solvent chemical that can be recycled in the manufacturing process.<br>
2<br><br>
It is an extremely strong fabric with industrial uses such as in automotive filters,<br>
ropes,  abrasive  materials,  bandages  and  protective  suiting  material.  It  is<br>
primarily found in the garment industry, particularly in women's clothing.<br>
Lyocell fibers are prepared by following process steps:<br>
The raw cellulose is dissolved into heated, pressurized vessel filled with an<br>
amine oxide solvent.<br>
After soaking for a short time in the solvent, the cellulose forms a clear solution<br>
and then it is filtered.<br>
The solution is then pumped through spinneret which is pierced with small holes<br>
to obtain long strands of fibers. The fibers are then immersed in another dilute<br>
solution of amine oxide. This helps to set the fiber strands. Then, they are<br>
washed with de-mineralized water.<br>
The lyocell fibers are then led to a drying area, where the water is evaporated<br>
from it. The strands are led to a finishing area, where the lubricant is applied.<br>
The dried, finished fibers are at this stage are called as a tow, which is a large<br>
untwisted bundle of continuous length filaments. The bundles of tow are taken<br>
to a crimper, a machine which compresses the fiber, giving it texture and bulk.<br>
The crimped fiber is then carded by mechanical carders, which perform an<br>
action like combing, to separate and order the strands. The carded strands are cut<br>
and baled for shipment to a fabric mill.<br>
The amine oxide used to dissolve the cellulose and set the fiber after spinning is<br>
recovered and re-used in the manufacturing process.<br>
From the spun or filament yarn, fabric is formed by knitting or weaving operations. Knitted fabrics can be made by using hooked needles to interlock one or more sets of yarns through a set of loops. The loops may be either loosely or closely constructed, depending on the purpose of the fabric. Knitted fabrics<br>
3<br><br>
can be used for hosiery, underwear, sweaters, slacks, suits, coats, rugs and other home furnishings. Knitting is performed using either weft or warp processes.<br>
Some typical preparations that are involved in the weaving operations are warping, slashing or sizing. Sizing agents are added to the yarn by solution or pad/dry techniques. Differences in raw materials, processing chemicals, fiber diameter, post treatments and blend ratios can be manipulated to produce a fiber having customized properties suitable for desired application. It is often desired that the lyocell fabrics possess typical properties such as thermal stability, ability to retain perfumes, antibacterial properties and the like. These properties are essential in several industrial as well as household applications. There has been a considerable interest in developing such materials. In order to impart various desirable properties to the fabric as mentioned above to the fabric, several additives are added. Such additives include antimicrobial agents, deodorizing agents, antistatic agents, perfumes. Besides such specific additives, generic additives for improving overall quality of the fabric, such as sizing agents, additives for increasing yarn softness and pliability are also added.<br>
Prior Art<br>
US 7012053 discloses a process for producing treated fabric which involves application of composition, comprising fabric care additive, perfume, color restoring agent and antimicrobial agent by means of spraying, soaking or dipping.<br>
Another method of imparting multiple properties to the fabric is disclosed in US 6806213 which involves incorporation of aqueous solution comprising fragrance material, moisturizing agent and surfactant into the fiber.<br>
4<br><br>
Earlier known processes of incorporating such additives, as reported in the above mentioned patents/applications, mainly involved conventional methods like spraying, encapsulating, solvent spinning the additives on the fabric. However, these methods suffer from several disadvantages which include non¬uniform and improper adhesion of additives onto the fiber material, fading, waning and gradual washing out of the additives over a period of time and which further affects the feel and texture of the fabric.<br>
There is thus felt a need for a process of incorporating additives to fabric which overcomes these shortcomings.<br>
Objects of the Invention<br>
It is an object of this invention to provide perfumed lyocell fibers, wherein at least one perfume constituent is incorporated in the body of the fiber.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a process of incorporating perfume constituents into lyocell fibers which ensures uniform distribution of the perfume constituent throughout the fiber length.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide perfumed lyocell fibers wherein the perfume constituents are retained in the lyocell product over a prolonged period of time.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide a process of incorporating perfume constituents to lyocell fibers which does not alter the feel and texture of the fabric.<br>
5<br><br>
Still another object of this invention is to provide a process of incorporating perfume constituents to lyocell fibers such that inherent properties of the lyocell fibers such as fiber strength, linear density, tenacity, heat resistance, dyeability and drying properties are not altered.<br>

The perfumed lyocell contains uniformly dispersed micro-reservoirs throughout the body of the fibers. The micro-reservoirs are discrete, nano-sized structures without any definite geometrical shape.<br>
Typically, the average mean size of the micro-reservoir is in the range of 5 nm to 2000 nm.<br>
The invention also extends to a perfume lyocell fiber, yarn and fabric manufactured from a formulation in accordance with this invention.<br>
17<br><br>
In accordance with this invention there is also provided a process for preparation of a perfume lyocell formulation meant for manufacture of lyocell products comprising the following steps :<br>
•	admixing a water-insoluble perfume constituent with a non-aqueous solvent followed by heating the resulting admixture upto 95 C to obtain non-aqueous phase ;<br>
•	dissolving and stirring a surfactant, optionally with a co-surfactant, in water to obtain an aqueous phase;<br>
•	heating the aqueous-phase;<br>
•	mixing the aqueous phase with the non-aqueous phase in the liquid state to form a admixture and homogenizing to obtain a micro-emulsion;<br>
•	mixing together cellulosic pulp and NNMO to form a slurry;<br>
•	dispersing the micro-emulsion in the slurry to obtain a preform mass wherein the antimicrobial constituent is embedded in evenly dispersed micro-reservoirs;<br>
•	vaccumising the preform mass to remove water under 7 to 10 mm of Hg and at temperature over 100°C to obtain the formulation.<br>
Typically, the pH of the aqueous phase is in the range of 7 to 13.<br>
Typically, the amount of non-aqueous phase in the micro-emulsion is in the range of 0.1 to 40% of the mass of the micro-emulsion.<br>
Typically, the amount of surfactant in the micro-emulsion is in the range of 0.1 to 20% of the mass of the micro-emulsion.<br>
18<br><br>
Typically, the proportion of perfume constituent in the lyocell product is in the range of 0.001 to 10% with respect to the mass of the lyocell product.<br>
Before arriving at the optimum concentration of the surfactant to be used, cloud point of the aqueous phase is determined. Furthermore, alkalinity of the aqueous phase matches with that of the viscous polymer dope thereby avoiding any drastic change in the alkalinity during the emulsification and homogenization step.<br>
Typically, the melted non-aqueous phase containing perfume constituent in a non-aqueous solvent along with aqueous phase containing surfactants is emulsified using high speed mixers such as Ultraturrex or a mechanical emulsifier; a colloid mill; a high pressure homogenizer and an ultrasonic emulsifier to form a micro-emulsion. The micro-emulsion may contain further additional perfume constituents, if desired.<br>
The active ingredients are released from the micro-reservoir into the lyocell matrix. The structure of micro-reservoir, lyocell and surrounding conditions determine the release rate of the perfume constituent. The molecules of the volatile perfume constituents migrate from micro-reservoirs to the surrounding primarily by diffusion. The perfume constituent is released from the matrix in a controlled release manner.<br>
Conventional method for in manufacture of lyocell involves following major steps :<br>
19<br><br>
Step 1. Creating a solvent solution from wood pulp<br>
The wood pulp is obtained from a variety of sources, such as wood chips or even large rolls of paper that have been finely shredded, is the basic starting material for manufacture of lyocell fibers. In case of manufacture of lyocell no further chemical treatment of the wood pulp is needed thereby making the process environment friendly.<br>
The wood pulp solution is produced in a straight solvation process by dissolving wood pulp at high temperatures and pressure in a recyclable non-toxic organic solvent solution of amine oxide, particularly N-methylmorpholine N-oxide,(NNMO).<br>
Lyocell is manufactured by a "closed loop" spinning process which conserves energy and water.<br>
Step 2. Spinning lyocell fiber from the solvent solution<br>
Before being formed into fibers, the lyocell polymer dope, is in a thick liquid state. In the spinning process this liquid is forced through a spinneret, which resembles a large shower head.<br>
The clear, viscous resultant solution is filtered and extruded into an aqueous bath of dilute amine oxide, and coagulated into fiber form.<br>
Step 3. Washing lyocell fiber to remove solvents.<br>
The fiber is then washed before it is dried and twisted or spun into yarns, which are woven or knitted into fabrics and garments.<br>
20<br><br>
Step 4. Drying fiber and producing yarns.<br>
When the filament dries or solidifies, it forms what is called a continuous filament fiber. Many continuous filaments of specific thicknesses collected in a large bundle called a "tow". A tow may contain over a million continuous filaments. The tow bundle is then crimped, is then mechanically cut into staple fibers, usually ranging in length from 1 to 6-1/2 inches, depending how they are to be used.<br>
Strands of continuous filament fibers are then twisted together to form a continuous filament yarn, which is then woven or knit into fabric.<br>
Step 5. Finishing to produce lyocell fabric.<br>
The fabric is treated with an enzyme that attacks cellulose fibers. Home laundry detergents containing such enzymes are also used for treatment of the fabric for better finishing purposes. This enzyme dissolves the split-end hairs from the fiber surface. The fiber is then washed and agitated again. The resulting fabric is similar in texture and drape to sueded silk or sueded rayon found in fashion apparel. Fabrics processed this way can usually be machine washed and line dried successfully.<br>
Alternatively, the filaments so obtained are stretched to straighten out the fibers which are further blended using standard equipment. The blended fibers are laid in to a web followed by Consolidation of the web to obtain Non-woven Lyocell Fabric.<br>
21<br><br>
The lyocell product made from the formulation in accordance with this invention contains uniformly dispersed micro-reservoirs throughout the mass which is shown in Fig. 2.<br>
A typical perfumed lyocell fiber as obtained by the process of this invention contains the releasable perfume constituent entrapped in the form of pockets. Said pockets are uniformly distributed throughout the length of the fiber. Upon microscopic examination, perfume constituent enriched lyocell fiber shows uniform distribution of pockets along the length of the lyocell fiber as shown in Fig. 2.<br>
The resultant perfumed lyocell fabric is tested. Linear Density (Denier) of the lyocell Fibers is determined by using standard ASTM Test Method (D 1577). The denier of the standard lyocell fiber (lyocell fiber without any perfume constituents) and perfume enriched lyocell fiber remains the same. Thus addition of perfume does not change the linear density of the lyocell fibers. Tensile strength and Young's modulus of lyocell fiber sample is tested on an Instron tensile testing machine as per the ASTM CI557-03 procedure at ambient temperature.<br>
Visual appearance of the perfume enriched fiber is evaluated by methods as prescribed in AATCC 124. As far as parameters like % Loss in Dry Tenacity and % loss in dry elongation are concerned, these remain the same in the perfume enriched lyocell fiber and the standard fiber. Incorporation of perfume constituent in accordance with this invention does not affect the visual appearance of the fiber.<br>
22<br><br>
Feel of the fiber: The perfume enriched lyocell fiber as prepared in accordance with this invention offers the same feel effect as is observed in case of plain lyocell fiber without any perfume constituent (Also referred as standard). Another important concern in textile industry is dye-ability of the fabric, which is tested by comparing the dyeability of the perfume constituent enriched fabric and the standard lyocell fabric. Dyeability of the perfume enriched lyocell fibers as prepared in accordance with this invention remains the same as that of the standard lyocell fiber.<br>
Perfume retention test:<br>
Perfumed lyocell fabric before and after washes is tested for aroma or fragrance by using an expert human panel. Fragrance of the perfumed lyocell fibers as prepared in accordance with this invention remains the same even after repeatedly washing the fabric and exposing it to sunlight and / or varying temperatures.<br>
The invention will now be described with the help of the following non-limiting examples.<br>
