The present invention relates to a storage box structure for a n-iotorcycle which includes a storage box under an occupant seat.<br>
[Background Art] [0002]<br>
In the related art, the upper portion of a rear cushion for suspending a rear wheel is mounted to a pair of body frames provided on both sides of a motorcycle.  The upper portion of the rear cushion is fixed to a boss provided on each of the opposing inner sides or outer sides of the body frames (see, for example, Patent Document 1).<br>
Also, in some of scooter-type motorcycles, in particular, a storage box is provided between a  pair of body frames and under a seat.<br>
[Patent Document 1] International Publication No. 200'9/071858 [Disclosure of the Invention] [Problem to be Solved by the Invention] [0003]<br>
The above-described storage box is required to provide an enlarged storage space. However, in a case where the upper portion of the rear cushion is fixed onto each of the opposing inner sides of the body frames, the storage space of the storage box disposed between the body frames is reduced to avoid interference with the fixing portion of the rear cushion.<br><br>
Also, it is desired to store a piece of luggage such as an attache case in the storage space in a substantially horizontally laid position. [0004]<br>
The present invention has been niade in view of the above-described circumstances, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a storage box STiructure for a motorcycle which iTiinimizes a cecrease in storage space even in a case where the upper portion of a rear cushion is fixed onto the inner sides of body frames, and which allows effective use of the storage space,<br>
[Means for Solving the Problem] [0005]<br>
To address the above-described problem, according to the present invention, there is provided a storage box structure for a motorcycle, in which a pair of left and right body frames are provided below a seat, a storage box is arranged under the seat and between the pair of body frames, and an upper portion of a cushion for suspending a rear wheel is mounted to one or both of opposing inner side surfaces of the body frames, wherein recesses for avoiding interference with the upper portion of the cushion are provided on both outer sides of the storage box, a first storage space is formed by forming flat surfaces, which are flat in a vehicle's lateral direction, in the recesses and inside the storage box, and a second storage space is formed by forming an inclined surface between the recesses on the left and right.<br>
According to this configuration, a piece of luggage such as an attache case can be stored in the first storage space in a<br><br>
_ubstantially horizontally laid position. Also, a long piece of luggage can be stored in the second storage space along the inclined surface. ;0006]<br>
Also, the upper portion of the cushion may  be mounted to a rear side cf each of the body frames, and the recesses ir.av be provided in a rear side of the storage box.<br>
According to this configuration, no constraint is imposed on the space in the front side and at the central portion of the storage box by the recesses. [0007]<br>
Further, the inclined surface may be inclined toward a front-side bottom surface of the storage box.<br>
According to this configuration, a long piece of luggage can be stored along the inclined surface from the bottom surface of the storage box. [0008]<br>
Also, the flat surfaces may be formed at the same height. .According to i:his configuration, the flat side of an attache case or the like can be placed in more intimate contact with the flat surfaces. [0009]<br>
Also, the seat may be formed integrally in a stepped shape so as to project upward in its rear portion, a rear portion of a bottom plate of the seat may be raised upward along this seat shape, and the rear portion may be arranged in an upper portion of the first storage space. [Effect of the Invention]<br><br>
[0010]<br>
In the storage box structure for a motorcycle according to the present inven-ion, recesses for avoiding interference with the upper portion of the cushion are provided on both outer sides of the storage box, a first storage space is formed by forming flat surfaces, which are flat in a vehicle's lateral direction, in the recesses and inside the storage box, and a second storage space is formed by forming an inclined surface between the recesses on the left and right. Therefore, a piece of luggage such as an attache case can be stored in the first storage space in a horizontally laid state, and effective use of the storage space can be made by optimizing the shape of the recesses. Also, a long piece of luggage can be stored in the second storage space along the inclined space, and a decrease in the storage space of the storage box can be minimized by optimizing the shape of the portion between the recesses. [0011]<br>
Also, the upper portion of the cushion is mounted to a rear side cf each of the body frames, and the recesses are provided in a rear side of the storage box. Thus, no constraint is imposed on the space in the front side and at the central portion of the storage box by the recesses. Therefore, it is possible to make effective use of the storage space of the storage box, and convenience is not impaired. [0012]<br>
Further, the inclined surface is inclined toward a front-side bottom surface of the storage box. Thus, a long piece of luggage can be stored along the inclined surface from the bottom<br><br>
surface of the storage box. Therefore, effective use of the storage space can be made, thus eliminating the inconvenience of not being able ro fir a long piece of luggage in the storage space even when the recesses are formed. :0C13]<br>
Also, the flat: surfaces are formed at the sarrie height, so the flat side of an attache case or the like can be placed in intimate contact wizh the flat surfaces.  Therefore, the attache case or the like can be stored in a stable position, thereby enhancing the convenience of storage. [0014]<br>
Also, the seat is formed integrally in a stepped shape so as to project upward in its rear portion, a rear portion of a bottom plate of the seat is raised upward along this seat shape, and the rear portion is arranged in an upper portion of the first storage space. Thus, the first storage space can be extended upward to increase the storage volume. [Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention] [0015]<br>

The space located above the upper flat surfaces 102L, 102B and extending up to the opening 24k is referred to as a first storage space SI,<br>
In the first storage space SI, a piece of luggage having a flat surface on the outer side of a rectangular storage item 203 of about A5 size (for example, an attache case; see Fig. 8) can be placed. By placing the flat surface of this attache case on both the upper flat surfaces 102L, 102R (or on one of the upper flat surfaces 102L, 102R), the above-mentioned attache case or the like can be stored in a stable position without being tilted obliquely. [0G39]<br><br>
Also, an inclined bottom surface 104 (inclined surface) that is inclined diagonally downward to the front from the rear side of the vehicle is formed between the inner vjall surfaces lOlL, lOlR (^between the relief portions iOOL, lOOR) that are opposed to each other so £S to face toward the inner side of the vehicle body.  The inclined bottomi surface 104 is inclined toward a bottom surface 24b located in the front side of the storage box 24. Also, the angle of inclination of the inclined bottom surface 104 is so determined as to avoid interference with the movable range of the rear wheel 41 located below the inclined bottom surface 104 (the range in which the rear wheel 41 can be moved vertically by the rear cushion units 27L, 27R). [0040]<br>
The space located above the inclined bottom surface 104 is referred to as a second storage space.<br>
A long piece of luggage 204 (for example, a folding umbrella; see Fig. S) can be placed in this second storage space S2.  By placing this piece of luggage along the inclination of the inclined bottom surface 104, or by placing this piece of luggage along this inclination all the way to the bottom surface 24b on the front side, a long piece of luggage can be stored in the storage space of the storage box 24. [0041]<br>
In the storace box structure for a motorcycle according to the embodiment of the present invention, relief portions IOOL, lOOR for avoiding interference with upper portions of the rear cushion units 27L, 2'7R are provided on both sides of the storage box 24, and the first storage space SI is formed by forming the<br><br>
upper flat surfaces 102L, 102R in upper surfaces of the relief portions lOOL, lOOR.  Thus, the rectangular storage item 203 cf about A5 size (for example, an attache case or a small laptop (notebook) personal computer) can be stored in the firsr storage space SI in a horizcntally laid state.  That is, it is possible tc make effective use ci the storace space of the storage box 24 bv optimizing the shape of the relief portions lOOL, IGOR.<br>
Also, the second storage space S2 is formed by forming the inclined bottom surface 104 between the left and right relief portions lOOL, lOOR.  Thus, the long piece of luggage 204 (for example, a folding umbrella) can be stored along the inclined bottom surface 104.  That is, a decrease in the storage space of the storage box 24 can be minimized by optimizing the shape of the portion between the relief portions IDOL, IGOR. [0042]<br>
Also, the upper portions of the rear cushion units 27L, 27R are mounted to the rear side of the rear frames 21L, 21R, and the relief portions lOCL, lOOP, are provided in the rear side of the storage box 24.  Thus, no constraint is imposed on the space in the front side and az  the central portion of the storage box 24 by the relief portions lOOL, lOOR. Therefore, it is possible to make effective use of the storage space of the storage box 24, and convenience is not impaired. [0043]<br>
Further, the inclined bottom surface 104 is inclined toward the bottom surface 24b in the front side of the storage box 24, so a long piece of luggage can be stored along the inclined bottom surface 104 from the bottom surface 24b of the storage box<br><br>
24.     Therefore, effective use of the storage space can be made, ^hus eliiTiinating the inconvenience of net being able to fit a Icng piece cf luggage in rhe s-orage space even when the relief portions lOOL, lOOR ere foriried.<br>
Also, the uppier flat surfaces 102L, 102R are icrmed at ihe same height, so the flat side of an attache case or the like can be placed in intimace contact with the upper flat surfaces 102L, 102R. Therefore, the attach^ case or the like can be stored in a stable position, thereby enhancing the convenience of storage. {0045]<br>
While an embodiment of the present invention has been described above, various modifications and changes are possible on the basis of the technical scope of the present invention.<br>
For example, while in this embodiment the rear cushion units 27L, 27R are provided on both side portions of the vehicle, the rear cushion units 27L, 27R may be provided on only one side. In this case as well, by forming the relief portions lOOL, lOCR on both sides, the storage box 24   used can only be of a single kind (or a common part) irrespective of the number of the rear cushion units 27L, 27R installed, and also an attache case or the like can be stored in a stable manner on the left and right upper flat surfaces 102L, 102R.
