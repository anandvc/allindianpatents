Description of the Background &amp; Prior art<br>
Valganciclovir is a mono- L- valyl ester prodrug of the antiviral compound ganciclovir.<br>
Valganciclovir is represented by chemical formula I, wherein Z is Hydrogen, is chemically, a L-valyl ester of 2-(2- amino-1,6-dihydro-6-oxo-purine-9-yl)-methoxy-3-hydroxy-1 -propane.<br><br>
Ganciclovir of Formula II, where Pi and P 2 are hydrogen, is disclosed in US Patent No.4,355,032.<br>
3<br><br><br>
Ganciclovir inhibits replication of human cytomegalovirus both in vitro and in vivo.<br>
When administered orally, Ganciclovir has a very low rate of absorption. Ganciclovir is mostly used as an intravenous infusion.<br>
Antiviral Purine derivatives with an acyclic chain in the 9 position, such as acyclovir (INN name ) &amp; Ganciclovir (INN name ) have been disclosed in British Patent 1523865 &amp; U.S. Patent 4,355,032 respectively.<br>
Antiviral compounds with better water solubility as compared to ganciclovir have been disclosed in British Patent Application GB 2 122 618, without mention of mono- or bis L-valyl esters of ganciclovir.<br>
Though Bis-L-valyl ester prodrug of ganciclovir with a better biavailability profile is mentioned in European Patent Application 0375 329, it does not disclose any details as to utility or preparation for mono L-valyl ester of ganciclovir.<br>
Mono- and diacyl esters of ganciclovir are disclosed by John C. Martin et. al. in J. Pharm. Sci. 76(2), p. 180-184. Various mono and diacyl esters of ganciclovir are disclosed with their methods of preparation. However,<br>
4<br><br>
L-valyl ester of ganciclovir and their process of preparation are not mentioned in this article.<br>
5<br>
European Patent Application 0 694 547 A discloses an antiviral compound with improved oral absorption and low toxicity which is a L-monovaline ester derived from 2-(2-amino-l,6-dihydro-6-oxo-purin-9-yl)methoxy-l,3-propanediol and its pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts. The process typically described in the said European Patent Application is:<br><br><br>
U.S.Patents5700936,5756736,5840890,5856481,5840891,6083953,61039 01,6040446,6215017,6218568 and US patent application 2002/042424 provide processes for preparation of mono L-valyl ester of ganciclovir of formula I , wherein Z is hydrogen or an amino protecting group or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof which involves protection of either of the two hydroxy groups of optionally amino protected ganciclovir and treating the monohydroxy protected ganciclovir of formula II, wherein P i is an amino protecting group and P 2 is hydroxy protecting group with protected L valine of formula III , wherein Z is amino protecting group , to get protected monovalyl ester of ganciclovir of formula IV.<br><br>
The compound is deprotected to get valganciclovir of formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in crystalline form.<br>
Thus, the above mentioned prior art processes involve various protected and partially protected ganciclovir derivatives as intermediates. For example,U.S.Patents 5700936, 5756736, 5840890, 5856481 involve divalinate, N,0-bistrityl, monocarboxylate-monovalinate, bis(L-valinate) intermediates . While U.S.Patents 6040446,6215017&amp;6218568 involve persilyl guanine or glycerol derivatives as intermediates.<br>
6<br><br>
These various above-mentioned intermediates are then subsequently deprotected and converted to valganciclovir of Formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in crystalline form.<br>
Again W097/27197 discloses a process explained in the scheme:<br><br>
Patent application WO2005/092891 details a process for the preparation of the optically pure from of valganciclovir or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof by using a solvent or a solvent system characterized in that ganciclovir is soluble in it. Examples of such solvents disclosed include dimethylsulphoxide and sulpholane.<br>
7<br><br>
However none of these above mentioned processes mention triacetyl ganciclovir as a starting material for preparing valganciclovir.<br>
Brief Description of the Present Invention<br>
The present invention discloses an improved process for the preparation of mono-L-valine ganciclovir, in which protection or deprotection of hydroxy groups of the ganciclovir moiety is not required.<br>
A further object of this invention is to provide a scheme that does not use ganciclovir for synthesis of valganciclovir.<br>
The process of the present invention involves the selective hydrolysis of 2(2-acetamido, 1,6-dihydro-6-oxo purine-9-yl)-methoxy-l,3-propane diol diactate (triacetyl ganciclovir) to 2-(2-aminol,6 dihydro-6oxo-purine -9-yl)-methoxy -3 acetoxy-1- propanol (mono acetyl ganciclovir). Selective hydrolysis in the context of this invention means the content of mono acetyl ganciclovir in the hydrolysed product is greater than 50%.<br>
This invention provides a process for preparing the compound of formula (I) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, which is named 2-(2-amino-1,6-dihydro-6-oxo-purin-9-yl)methoxy-3-hydroxy-1 -propyl-L-valinate or mono-L-valine ganciclovir.<br>

CBZ Valine ,with a coupling agent and a second solvent to give<br>
compound	of	formula	VI;<br><br>
c)hydrolysis under basic conditions of compound of Formula VI; using an amine to give N- Benzyloxy carbonyl valganciclovir, and<br>
d)hydrogenolysis in the presence of a catalyst, under acidic conditions of N- Benzyloxy carbonyl valganciclovir to give valganciclovir.<br>

Typically, the basic conditions for hydrolysis are created using an amine.<br>
Typically, the catalyst is selected from a group of catalysts consisting of palladium on carbon, platinum and palladium hydroxide on carbon.<br>
Typically, acidic conditions are created with at least one acid selected from a group of acids consisting of hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, acetic acid, ascorbic acid and citric acid.<br>
This process involves selective hydrolysis of triacetyl ganciclovir to monoacetyl ganciclovir. Triacetyl ganciclovir is a relatively cheaper starting material as compared to ganciclovir.<br>
Selective hydrolysis is carried out typically using piperidine or piperazine at a temperature range of 25 to 80 °C.<br>
Monoacetyl ganciclovir is subsequently esterified with activated form of valine with a coupling agent typically using dicyclohexyl carbodiimide with a mixture of dichloromethane and DMF.<br>
10<br><br>
The monocarboxylate ester from the above step is hydrolysed under basic conditions typically using piperidine at 25 to 30 °C.<br>
N-Benzyloxy carbonyl Valganciclovir is subjected to hydrogenolysis in presence of a catalyst typically using Palladium on Carbon under acidic conditions typically using Hydrochloric acid to give valganciclovir.<br>

Valganciclovir is used for the treatment for an AIDS-related complication called CMV-retinitis. This is caused by a virus called CMV (Cytomegalovirus), which infects the eye. If left untreated, CMV retinitis can cause people with HIV /AIDS (PHAs) to go blind.<br>
Valganciclovir is used for prophylaxis of CMV infection and disease in high-risk solid organ transplant recipients for example, in heart, renal and bone marrow transplants.<br>
Valganciclovir is also useful for the treatment of certain carcinomas or lymphomas caused by, or related to, viral infections, such as nasopharyngeal cancer, immunoblastic lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, and hairy leukoplakia.<br>
