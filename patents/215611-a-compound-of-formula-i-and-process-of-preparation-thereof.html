"A COMPOUND OF FORMULA I AND PROCESS OF PREPARATION<br>
THEREOF"<br>
ASTRAZENECA AB,  a  Swedish  company,  of S-151   85  Sodertalje, SWEDEN,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br>
granted<br><br>
29-06-2007<br><br>
       original<br>
in/pct/2002/420/mum<br><br><br><br><br>
The -present invention relates to- a compound of formula I and process of preparation thereof .<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to novel pharmaceutically useful compounds, in particular compounds which are useful in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias.<br>
10     Background and Prior Art<br>
Cardiac arrhythmias may be defined as abnormalities in the rate, regularity, or site of origin of the cardiac impulse or as disturbances in conduction which causes an abnormal sequence of activation. Arrhythmias may be 15 classified clinically by means of the presumed site of origin (i.e. as supraventricular, including atrial and atrioventricular, arrhytrirnias and ventricular arrhythmias) and/or by means of rate (i.e. bradyarrhythmias (slow) and tachyarrhythmias (fast)).<br>
20   In the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, the negative outcome in clinical trials (see, for example, me outcome of the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST) reported in New England. Journal of Medicine, 321, 406 (1989)) with "traditional" antiarrhythmic drugs, which act primarily by slowing the conduction velocity (class I antiarrhythmic drugs), has prompted<br>
25 drug development towards compounds which selectively delay cardiac repolarization, thus prolonging the QT interval. Class III antianhythmic drugs may be defined as drugs which prolong the trans-membrane action potential duration (which can be caused by a block of outward K+ currents<br><br><br><br>
or from an increase of inward ion currents) and refractoriness, without affecting cardiac conduction.<br>
One of the key disadvantages of hitherto known drugs which act by 5    delaying repolarization (class III or otherwise) is that they all are known to exhibit a unique form of proarrhythmia known as torsades de pointes (turning of points), which may, on occasion be fatal. From the point of view of safety, the minimisation of this phenomenon (which has also been shown to be exhibited as a result of administration of non-cardiac drugs 10 . such as phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, antihistamines and antibiotics) is a key problem to be solved in the provision of effective antiarrhythmic drugs.<br>
*	*      ■<br>
Antiarrhythmic drugs based on bispidines (3,7-diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonanes), 15   are known from inter alia international patent applications WO 91/07405 and WO 99/31100, European patent applications 306 871, 308 843 and 665 228 and US patents 3,962,449, 4,556,662, 4,550,112, 4,459,301 and 5,468,858, as well as journal articles including inter alia J. Med. Chem. 39, 2559, (1996), Pharmacol. Res., 24, 149 (1991), Circulation, 90, 2032 (1994) 20  and Anal. Sci. 9, 429, (1993). Oxabispidine compounds are neither disclosed nor suggested in any of these documents.<br>
Certain oxabispidine compounds are disclosed as chemical curiosities in Chem. Ber., 96, 2827 (1963).   That these compounds may be used in the 25     treatment of arrhythmias is neither mentioned nor suggested.<br>
We have surprisingly found that a novel group of oxabispidine-based compounds   exhibit   electrophysiological   activity,   preferably   class   III electrophysiological activity, and are therefore expected to be useful in the 30     treatment of cardiac arrhythmias.<br>

Diastereoisomers may be separated using conventional techniques, e.g. chromatography or fractional crystallisation.    The various stereoisomers may be isolated by separation of a racemic or other mixture of the compounds using conventional, e.g. fractional crystallisation or HPLC, 20     techniques.    Alternatively the desired optical isomers may be made by reaction  of the  appropriate  optically   active  starting  materials  under conditions which will not cause racemisation or epimerisation, or by derivatisation, for example wim a homochiral acid followed by separation of the   diastereomeric    esters   by    conventional    means    (e.g.    HPLC, 25     chromatography over silica).    All stereoisomers are included within the scope of the invention.<br>

Preferred bases mclude sodium hydroxide and preferred solvents include water. The reaction is advantageously performed with compounds of formula XLIV wherein Rla represents -S(0)2R9 (e.g. wherein R9 represents optionally substituted phenyl, such as 2- or 4-fluorophenyl, 2- or 4-chlorophenyl, 4-bromophenyl, 4-methylphenyl, 4-methoxyphenyl, 2- or 4-nitrophenyI, 2,4,6-trimethylphenyl). The use of such ring-substituted benzenesulfonyl derivatives may have the advantage that purification of the resulting compound of formula XLII may be made more straightforward (e.g. requiring only a simple recrystallisation step).<br>
Compounds of formulae XLIII and XLIV may also be reacted together in this way in the presence of water in order to give a direct, "one-pot" process providing a compound of formula XXXIX. Such "one-pot" reactions may be carried out, for example, by using a biphasic reaction mixture comprising a solution of XLIII and XLIV in an organic solvent (e.g. toluene), and an aqueous solution of a base (e.g. sodium hydroxide). Alternatively, the aqueous solution of base may, after the formation of the intermediate compound of formula XLII is complete, be exchanged for an aqueous solution of an acid (e.g. either a protic or a Lewis acid).   Any of<br>
44<br><br><br>
the reaction steps in such biphasic mixtures may be carried out in the presence of a suitable phase transfer catalyst.<br>

20    capable of forming a peroxide adduct, such as methyltrioxorhenium(VII) or a combination of sodium tungstate and (aminomethyl)phosphonic acid), and/or further appropriate additives (for example: in the case of oxidations carried out with methyltrioxorhenium(Vt[) and hydrogen peroxide, a basic additive such as pyridine or pyrazole; and in me case of oxidations with<br>

When the oxidation is carried out in the presence of both a<br>

Compounds of formula I may also be prepared, advantageously, by dehydrative cyclisation of compound of formula XLVII,<br><br><br><br><br><br>
wherein A, B, G, R\ R2, R3, R4 and R41 to R46 are as hereinbefore defined, for example in the presence of a suitable dehydrating agent (such as: a strong acid (e.g. sulfuric acid (e.g. concentrated sulfuric acid), methanesulfonic acid (e.g. anhydrous methanesulfonic acid) and the like; an acid anhydride such as acetic anhydride or trifluoromethane-sulfonic anhydride; P205 in methanesulfonic acid; a phosphorous-based halogenating agent such as P(0)C13, PC13 or PC15; and thionyl chloride).<br>
This cyclisation process may be carried out in the presence of a suitable organic solvent system, which solvent system should not significantly react chemically with, or significantly give rise to stereochemical changes in, the reactants or product once formed, or significantly give rise to other side reactions. Preferred solvent systems include aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g. toluene or xylene).<br>
47<br><br><br>
PC^SEeWflS94<br>
This cyclisation process may be carried out at elevated temperature (e.g. up to the reflux temperature of the relevant solvent system, or higher if a pressurised system is employed). Clearly, appropriate reaction times and reaction temperatures depend upon the solvent system that is employed, as well as the reactants that are used and the compound that is to be formed, but these may be determined routinely by the skilled person.<br>
Compounds of formula XLVII may advantageously be prepared by reaction of a compound of formula XLVIII,<br><br><br>
wherein the wavy bonds indicate optional R-, S- or mixed R- and S-stereochemistry at the asymmetric carbon atoms, and R1 and R41 to R46 are as hereinbefore defined, with a compound of formula XXIV as hereinbefore defined.   This reaction may be carried out at between room<br>
15     temperature and the reflux temperature of any solvent that is employed. Suitable solvent systems that may be employed include organic solvent systems, which system should not significantly react chemically with, or significantly give rise to stereochemical changes in,  the reactants or product once formed, or significantly give rise to other side reactions.<br>
20  Preferred solvent systems include lower alkyl alcohols (particularly primary alcohols (e.g. ethanol)) optionally in the presence of water, IMS, aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g. toluene) or mixtures thereof.<br>
Compounds of formula XXIV may be prepared as described herein. 25     Compounds of formula XLVIII may be prepared according to or by<br>
48<br><br><br>
analogy with the procedures described herein in relation to the preparation of compounds of formula XLII.<br>
The formation of compounds of formula XLVII may be also be performed 5 using compounds of formula XL VIII having enantiomeric (or diastereomeric) enrichment at the chiral centres identified hereinbefore. The use of such enantiomericaHy- (or diastereomerically-) enriched compounds of formula XLVII in the formation of compounds of formula XLVII may have the advantage that a greater proportion of the product diol 10 is obtained in a form (e.g. the trans-form) which facilitates the subsequent cyclisation, leading to a higher yield of compounds of formula I.<br>
The formation of compounds of formula XLVII is preferably carried out using compounds of formula XLVTII in which R1 represents Rla, wherein<br>
15   Rla is as hereinbefore defined. The formation of compounds of formula XLVII is more preferably carried out using compounds of formula XLVin in which R1 represents -S(0)2R9 (e.g. wherein R9 represents optionally substituted phenyl, such as 2- or 4-fluorophenyl, 2- or 4-chlorophenyl, 4-bromophenyl, 4-methylphenyl, 4-methoxyphenyl, 2- or 4-nitrophenyl,<br>
20     2,4,6-trimethylphenyl and, especially, unsubstimted phenyl).<br>
Preferred compounds of formula XXIV include those in which: G represents CH; A represents a direct bond; 25     B represents a direct bond; R2 represents H or C1-6 alkyl; R3 represents H or C1-6 alkyl;<br>
49<br><br><br>
R4 is absent or represents one to three halo, methyl, methoxy or nitro groups, especially 2- or 4-fluoro, 2- or 4-chloro, 4-bromo, 4-methyl, 2,4,6-trimethyl, 4-methoxy, or 2- or 4-nitro.<br>
We have found, surprisingly, that, when compounds of formula I are formed using this process (i.e. via compounds of formula XLVII), the employment of derivatives of formula XLVEI in which R1 represents Rla (e.g. wherein Rla represents optionally-substituted benzenesulfonyl, such as described above), and benzylamine-type derivatives of formula XXIV (such as those described above), may have the advantage that, in the resultant compound of formula I, the presence of the Rla (e.g. S(O)R9) group and/or the benzylamine-type group allows for direct and facile replacement of that/those group(s) with other R1 groups, and/or<br><br>
fragments, as appropriate, for example by employing reactions that are akin to "deprotection" reactions (see below), and subsequently performing coupling reactions (see, for example process steps (a), (c), (d) and (e)). We have found, if that benzenesulfonyl derivatives of formula XLVIII, and benzylamine-type derivatives of formula XXIV are employed, subsequent replacement steps may be made more straightforward (e.g. enabling the use of milder reaction conditions).<br>

The skilled person will appreciate that, if desired, the above steps may be performed in a different order to those that stated above, to provide the relevant compounds of formula I. For example, steps (iii) and (iv) may be carried out prior to steps (i) and (ii). Alternatively, steps (i) and (iii) (in either order) may be completed before steps (ii) and (iv) (in either order)<br>
54<br><br><br>
are carried out. However, we prefer that the steps are performed in the above-stated order.<br>
The process of making the compounds of formula I from compounds of formulae XLIII and XXTV (i.e. via compounds of formula XLVII) may have the advantage that oxabispidine ring systems may be formed using fewer steps than methods described in the prior art, and, particularly, avoids the use of mercury-containing compounds (thereby eliminating the production of toxic, mercury-containing waste). This process offers a convenient synthetic route to key oxabispidine compounds, and allows differential protection at me nitrogen atoms.<br>
Further, this process may have the advantage that compounds comprising me oxabispidine ring may be prepared in less time, more conveniently, and/or at a lower cost, than when prepared in processes described in the prior art.<br>
Compounds of formulae III, V, VI, XI, XII, XIII, XVI, XVII, XVHI, XIX, XXI, XXII, XXIV, XXV, XXVII, XXVIII, XXIX, XXX, XXXA, XXXB, XXXC, XXXD, XXXE, XXXF, XXXG, XXXI, XXXII, XXXIHA, XXXIIIB, XXXTVA, XXXIVB, XXXV, XXXVI, XLI, XLIII, XLIV and XLVI and derivatives thereof, are either commercially available, are known in the literature, or may be obtained either by analogy with the processes described herein, or by conventional synthetic procedures, in accordance with standard techniques, from readily available starting materials using appropriate reagents and reaction conditions.<br>
Substituents on the aryl (e.g. phenyl), and (if appropriate) heterocyclic, group(s) in compounds defined herein may be converted to other claimed<br>
55<br><br><br>
substituents using techniques well Known to those skilled in the art. For example, hydroxy may be converted to alkoxy, phenyl may be halogenated to give halophenyl, nitro may be reduced to give amino, halo may be displaced by cyano, etc?<br>
5<br>
The skilled person will also appreciate that various standard substituent or functional group interconversions and transformations within certain compounds of formula I will provide other compounds of formulae I. For example, carbonyl may be reduced to hydroxy or alkylene, and hydroxy 10    may be converted to halo.<br>
The compounds of, the invention may be isolated from their reaction mixtures using conventional techniques.<br>
15  It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that, in the process described above, the functional groups of intermediate compounds may be, or may need to be, protected by protecting groups.<br>
Functional groups which it is desirable to protect include hydroxy, amino 20   and carboxylic acid. Suitable protecting groups for hydroxy include trialkylsilyl and diarylalkylsilyl groups (e.g. te/T-butyldimethylsilyl, tert- ■ butyldiphenylsilyl or trimethylsilyl), tetrahydropyranyl and alkylcarbonyl groups (e.g. methyl- and ethylcarbonyl groups). Suitable protecting groups for amino include benzyl, sulfonamido (e.g. benzenesulfonamido), tert-25  butyloxyearbonyl, 9-fluorenyl-methoxycarbonyl or benzyloxycarbonyl. Suitable protecting groups for amidino and guanidino include benzyloxycarbonyl. Suitable protecting groups for carboxylic acid include  alkyl or benzyl esters.<br>
56<br><br><br>
The protection and deprotection of functional groups may take place before or after any of the reaction steps described hereinbefore.<br>
Protecting groups may "be removed in accordance with techniques which are 5  well known to those skilled in the art and as described hereinafter. For example, we have found that removal of an -S02R9 group from an oxabispidine ring may take place conveniently by employment of an appropriate strong acid, such as a hydrohalic acid (especially HBr) e.g. as described hereinbefore. 10<br>
The use of protecting groups is fully described in "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry", edited by J.W.F. McOmie, Plenum Press (1973), and "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", 3rd edition, T.W. Greene &amp; P.G.M. Wutz, Wiley-Interscience (1999).<br>
15<br>
Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that, in order to obtain compounds of the invention in an alternative, and, on some occasions, more convenient, manner, the individual process steps mentioned herein may be performed in a different order, and/or the individual reactions may be performed at a<br>
20   different stage in the overall route (i.e.- substituents may be added to and/or chemical transformations performed upon, different intermediates to those associated hereinbefore with a particular reaction). This will depend inter alia on factors such as the nature of other functional groups present in a particular substrate, the availability of key intermediates and the protecting<br>
25 group strategy (if any) to be adopted. Clearly, the type of chemistry involved will influence the choice of reagent that is used in the said synthetic steps, the need, and type, of protecting groups that are employed, and the sequence for accomplishing the synthesis.<br>
57<br><br><br>
It will also be appreciated by those skilled in the art that, although" certain protected derivatives of compounds of formula I, which may be made prior to a final deprotection stage, may not possess pharmacological activity as such, they may be administered parenterally or orally and thereafter 5 metabolised in the body to form compounds of the invention which are pharmacologically active. Such derivatives may therefore be described as "prodrugs". Moreover, certain compounds of formula I may act as prodrugs of ouier compounds of formula I.<br>

Biological Tests<br>
Test A<br>
Primary Electrophysiological Effects In Anaesuietised Guinea Pigs<br>
Guinea pigs weighing between 660 and 1100 g were used.   The animals<br>
were housed for at least one week before the experiment and had free access<br>
to food and tap water during that period.<br>
Anaesthesia was induced by an intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital (40 to 50 mg/kg) and catheters were introduced into one carotid artery (for blood pressure recording and blood sampling) and into one jugular vein (for 15   drug infusions). Needle electrodes were placed on die limbs for recording of ECGs (lead II). A thermistor was placed in the rectum and the animal was placed on a heating pad, set to a rectal temperature of between 37.5 and 38.5°C.<br>
20    A tracheotomy was performed and the animal was artificially ventilated with room air by use of a small animal ventilator, set to keep blood gases within the normal range for the species. In order to reduce autonomic influences both vagi were cut in the neck, and 0.5 mg/kg of propranolol was given intravenously, 15 minutes before the start of the experiment.<br>
25<br>
The left ventricular epicardium was exposed by a left-sided thoracotomy, and a custom-designed suction electrode for recording of the monophasic action potential (MAP) was applied to the left ventricular free wall. The electrode was kept in position as long as an acceptable signal could be<br>
63<br><br><br>
recorded, otherwise it was moved to a new position. A bipolar electrode for pacing was clipped to the left atrium. Pacing (2 ms duration, twice the diastolic threshold) was performed with a custom-made constant current stimulator. The heart was paced at a frequency just above the normal sinus rate during 1 minute every fifth minute throughout the study.<br>
The blood pressure, the MAP signal and the lead II ECG were recorded on a Mingograph ink-jet recorder (Siemens-Elema, Sweden). All signals were collected (sampling frequency 1000 Hz) on a PC during the last 10 seconds of each pacing sequence and the last 10 seconds of the following minute of sinus rhythm. The signals were processed using a custom-made program developed for acquisition and analysis of physiological signals measured in experimental animals (see Axenborg and Hirsch, Comput. Methods Programs Biomed.41, 55 (1993)).<br>
The test procedure consisted of taking two basal control recordings, 5 minutes apart, during both pacing and sinus rhythm. After the second control recording, the first dose of the test substance was infused in a volume of 0.2 mL into the jugular vein catheter for 30 seconds. Three minutes later, pacing was started and a new recording was made. Five minutes after the previous dose, the next dose of test substance was administered. Six to ten consecutive doses were given during each experiment.<br>
Data analysis<br>
Of the numerous variables measured in this analysis, three were selected as the most important for comparison and selection of active compounds. The three variables selected were the MAP duration at 75 percent repolarization during pacing, the atrio-ventricular (AV) conduction time (defined as the<br>
64<br><br><br>
interval between the atrial pace pulse and the start of the ventricular MAP) during pacing, and the heart rate (defined as the RR interval during sinus rhythm). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were measured in order to judge the haemodynamic status of the anaesthetised animal. Further, the ECG was checked for arrhythmias and/or morphological changes.<br>
The mean of die two control recordings was set to zero and the effects recorded after consecutive doses of test substance were expressed as percentage changes from this value. By plotting these percentage values against the cumulative dose administered before each recording, it was possible to construct dose-response curves. In this way, each experiment generated diree dose-response curves, one for MAP duration, one for AV-conduction time and one for the sinus frequency (RR interval). A mean curve of all experiments performed with a test substance was calculated, and potency values were derived from the mean curve. All dose-response curves in tiiese experiments were constructed by linear connection of the data points obtained. The cumulative dose prolonging the MAP duration by 10% from the baseline was used as an index to assess the class III electrophysiological potency of the agent under investigation (D10).<br>
Test B<br>
Glucocorticoid-treated mouse fibroblasts as a model to detect blockers of<br>
the delayed rectifier K current.<br>
IC50 for K channel blockade was determined using a microtitre plate<br>
based   screen   method,   based   on   membrane   potential   changes   of<br>
glucocorticoid-treated mouse fibroblasts.     The membrane potential of<br>
glucocorticoid-treated mouse Fibroblasts was measured using fluorescence<br>
of the bisoxonol dye DiBac4(3), which could be reliably detected using a<br>
fluorescence laser imaging plate reader (FLIPR).  Expression of a delayed<br><br><br>
                                                        65 <br><br><br>
rectifier potassium channel was induced in mouse fibroblasts by 24 hours exposure to the glucocorticoide dexamehasone (5 uM). Blockade of these potassium channels depolarised the fibroblasts, resulting in increased fluorescence of DiBac4(3)<br>
5 <br>
Mouse ltk fibroblasts (L-cells) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassa, VA), and were cultured in Dulbeccos modified eagle medium supplemented with fetal calf serum (5 % vol/vol), penicillin (500 units/mL), streptomycin (500 fig/mL) and 10    L-alanme-L-glutamine (0.862 mg/mL). The cells were passaged every 3-4 days using trypsin (0.5 mg/mL in calcium-free phosphate buffered saline, Gibco BRL). Three days prior to experiments, cell-suspension was pipetted out into clear-bottom, black plastic, 96-weIl plates (Costar) at 25 000 cells/well.<br>
15<br>
The fluorescence probe DiBac4(3) (DiBac Molecular probes) was used to measure membrane potential. DiBac4(3) maximally absorbs at 488 nM and emits at 513 nM. DiBac4(3) is a bisoxonol, and thus is negatively charged at pH 7.   Due to its negative charge, the distribution of DiBac4(3) across<br>
20 the membrane is dependent upon the transmembrane potential: if the cell depolarizes (i.e. the cell interior becomes less negative relative to cell exterior), the DiBac4(3) concentration inside the cell increases, due to electrostatic forces. Once inside the cell, DiBac4(3) molecules can bind to lipids and proteins, which causes an increase in fluorescence emission.<br>
25 Thus, a depolarization will be reflected by an increase in DiBac4(3) fluorescence. The change in DiBac4(3) fluorescence was detected by a FLIPR.<br>
66<br><br>
Prior to each experiment, the cells were washed 4 times in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove all culture media. The cells were then treated with 5 M DiBac4(3) (in 180 uL of PBS) at 35°C. Once a stable fluorescence was reached (usually after  10 min), 20 pL of the test<br>
5     substance was added, using FLIPR"s internal 96 well pipetting system. Fluorescence measurements, were then taken every 20 sec for a further 10" min.    All experiments were carried out at 35°C, due to the high temperature  sensitivity  of both  delayed  rectifier  potassium  channel conductance and DiBac) fluorescence.  Test substances were prepared in<br>
10 a second 96 well plate, in PBS containing 5 pM DiBac4(3). The concentration of substance prepared was 10 times that of the desired concentration in the experiment as an additional 1:10 dilution occurred during addition of substance during the experiment. Dofetilide (10 pM) was used as a positive control, i.e. to determine the maximum increase in<br>
15     fluorescence.<br>
Curve-fitting, used to determine the IC50 values, was performed with the Graphpad Prism program (Graphpad Software Inc., San Diego, CA).<br>
20    Test C<br>
Metabolic Stability of Test Compounds<br>
An in vitro screen was set up to determine the metabolic stability of the<br>
compounds of the invention.<br>
25    The hepatic S-9 fraction from dog, man, rabbit and rat with NADPH as co-factor was used. The assay conditions were as follows: S-9 (3 mg/mL), NADPH (0.83 mM), Tris-HCl buffer (50 mM) at pH 7.4 and 10 uM of test compound.<br>
67<br><br><br>
 The reaction was started by addition of test compound and terminated after  0, 1, 5, 15 and 30 minutes by raising the pH in the sample to above 10  (NaOH; 1 mM). After solvent extraction, the concentration of test  compound was measured against an internal standard, by LC 5      (fluorescence/UV detection).<br>
The percentage of test compound remaining after 30 minutes (and thus t1/2) was calculated and used as a measure for metabolic stability.<br>
10     The invention is illustrated by way of the following examples.<br>

The following intermediates were not commercially available, and were therefore prepared by the methods described below.<br>
5     Preparation A <br>
tert-Butyl 9-oxa-3,7-diazabicyclor3.3. nnonane-3-carb"oxylate hydrochloride<br>
(i) 2,6-Bis(iodomethyl)-4-(phenylsulfonyl)morpholine 10     The sub-title compound was prepared according to both of the following . two methods:<br>
(a) To a stirred mixture of water (835 mL), chloroform (1.25 L) and iodine (418.7 g, 1.65 mol) under an inert atmosphere (N2) was added,<br>
15   portion-wise over a period of 30 min, 2,6-bis[(acetoxymercuri)methyl]-4-(phenylsulfonyl)morpholine (prepared as described, in Chem. Ber. 96, 2827 (1963); 421.3 g, 0.55 mol), during which time the reaction mixture was warmed to reflux. After addition was complete, reflux was continued overnight before the mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature.<br>
20   The mixture was filtered and the chloroform layer separated. A saturated aqueous solution of Na2S203 was added to the organic solution until the iodine colour disappeared. The organic layer was again separated, then dried (Na2S04), filtered and concentrated in vacuo to yield 279.9 g (100%) of the sub-title compound as a light yellow crystalline solid.<br>
25     HPLC analysis indicated this product to be composed of 46% cw-isomer  and 54% trans-isomer.<br>
(b) Acetonitrile (50  mL)  and  then ether  (150 mL)  were  added  to triphenylphosphine (20.1 g, 77 mmol).  Imidazole (5.24 g, 77 mmoi) was<br><br><br>
                                                           69 <br><br><br>
   added and the solution cooled to 5°C. "Iodine (19.5 g, 77 mmol) was added, causing the temperature to rise to 17°C. A solution of 2,6-bis-(hydroxymethyl)-4-(phenylsulfonyl)morpholine (Preparation L; 10.65 g, 37 mmol) in acetonitrile (50 mL) was added and the reaction stirred at 5  room temperature for 22 hours. Aqueous sodium thiosulfate (5%, 100 mL) was added and the layers separated. The organic phase was washed with dilute sulfuric acid (100 mL) and then was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by chromatography over silica (200g), eluting with dichloromethane (1.5 L), to give a yellow 10    oil. This was triturated with ether to give the title compound as a yellow solid (a 1:1 mixture of cis- and trans- isomers; 6.1 g 37%). The ether wash contained impure product (1.90 g).<br>

(U) 3-Benzyl-7-(phenylsulfonyl)-9-oxa-3,7-diazabicyclol"(3 .3.1) nonane A mixture"of benzylamine (173.3 g,  1.62 mol),  cis- and trans-2,6-bis(iodomethyl)-4-(phenylsuIfonyl)morpholine   (from  step   (i)(a)   above; 275 g, 0.54 mol), and sodium hydrogencarbonate. (182.2 g, 2.17 mol) in<br>
20 acetonitrile (13.5 L) was refluxed for 24 h. After this time, an aliquot was removed and diluted with ethyl acetate. HPLC analysis of this sample indicated that approximately 9% of the cis-isomer of. the starting material remained unreacted. Reflux was continued for a further 6 n, but this gave no change in the percentage of unreacted starting material (as indicated by<br>
25   HPLC). The reaction was then allowed to cool to rt before the mixture was filtered and the filtrate concentrated in vacuo. The resulting crude product was partitioned between dichloromethane and 0.5 N NaOH solution. The organic layer was separated, washed with brine, dried (Na2S04), filtered and then concentrated in vacuo to afford a mixture of<br>
70<br><br><br>
oil and crystals.   This mixture was slurried in toluene (300 mL) and the  . crystalline product collected by filtration.   The filter cake of crystals was rinsed with cold toluene (100 mL), and then dried in a vacuum oven overnight (40°C, 13*3 "Pa (0.1 mmHg)) to give 61.7 g (31.9% yield, 5     72.8% conversion of the cw-isomer) of the sub-title compound.

The mixture was refluxed for 48 h before being cooled to -10 °C. The cooled mixture was then treated sequentially (and cautiously) with water (45.8 mL),  15%<br>
15     NaOH solution (45.8 mL) and then water (137.4 mL) again.     The resulting mixture was filtered through Celite® and die filtrate set aside. The inorganic salts from the filter cake were transferred to a beaker and stirred with ethyl acetate (1 L) for 30 min.   This slurry was then filtered through Celite® again.     The two filtrates were combined and then<br>
20 concentrated in vacuo to afford an oil (32.2 g). This oil was dissolved in methanol (120 mL) and treated with a solution of HC1 in IPA (100 mL), after which the solution pH was checked for acidity. After standing for 24 h, a-crop of crystals, was collected by filtration and dried to a constant weight of 26.8 g.  A second crop of crystals (7 g) was later obtained by<br>
25 crystallisation of the remaining crude product from IPA, giving a total yield of 33.8 g (68%) of the sub-title compound.<br>

Water (2.5 L, 10 vol.) followed by epichlorohydrin (500 mL, 4 eq.) were added to benzenesulfonamide (250 g, 1 eq.). The reactants were heated to 40°C. Aqueous sodium hydroxide (130 g in 275 mL of water) was added such that me temperature of the reaction remained between 40°C and<br>
25 43°C. This took approximately 2 hours. (The rate of sodium hydroxide addition needs to be slower at the start of the addition man at me end in order to keep within the temperature range stated.) After the addition of sodium hydroxide was complete, the reaction was stirred at 40°C for 2 hours, then at ambient temperature overnight. The excess epichlorohydrin<br>
90<br><br><br>
was removed as a water azeotrope by vacuum. distillation (ca. 40 mbar, internal temp 30°C), until no more epichlorohydrin distilled. Dichloromethane (1L) was added and the mixture stirred rapidly for 15 minutes. The phases were allowed to separate (this took 10 minutes 5 although totally clear phases are obtained after standing overnight). The phases were separated and the dichloromethane solution used in the subsequent step below.<br>

(iii) 3-Benzyl-7-(phenylsulfonyl)-9-oxa-3 J-diazabicycloP.3. llnonane The following is an alternative preparation to that described in Preparation A(ii) above. The toluene solution from the previous step (ii) above was cooled to 50°C.<br>
10     Anhydrous methanesulfonic acid (0.2 L) was added. This caused a temperature rise from 50°C to 64°C, After 10 minutes, methanesulfonic acid was added (1 L) and the reaction heated to 110°C for 5 hours. Toluene was then distilled from the reaction; 1.23 L was collected.  (Note that the internal temperature should not be allowed higher than 110°C at<br>
15    any stage otherwise the yield will be decreased.) The reaction was then cooled to 50 °C and a vacuum applied to remove the rest of the toluene. Heating to 110°C and 650 mbar allowed a further 0.53 L to be removed. (If the toluene can be removed at a lower temperature and pressure men that is beneficial.)    The reaction was then left to cool to 30°C and<br>
20 deionised water (250 mL) was added. This caused the temperature to rise from 30°C to 45°C. More water (2.15 L) was added over a total time of 30 minutes such that the temperature was less than 54°C. The solution was cooled to 30°C and then dichloromethane (2 L) was added. With external cooling and rapid stirring, the reaction mixture was basified by<br>
25 adding aqueous sodium hydroxide (10 M, 2 L) at a rate mat kept me internal temperature below 38°C. This took 80 minutes. The stirring was stopped and the phases separated in 3 minutes. The layers were partitioned. IMS (2 L) was added to the dichloromethane solution and distillation  started.     Solvent  (2.44  L)  was  collected  until   the  head<br>
92<br><br>
temperature reached 70°C. Theoretically, this left the product in 1.56 L of IMS. The solution was then allowed to cool to ambient temperature overnight with slow stirring. The solid product that precipitated was filtered and washed with IMS (0.5 L) to give a fawn-coloured product that, on drying at 50°C, in vacuum, gave 50.8 g (8.9% over 3 steps). 20.0 g of this product was dissolved in acetonitrile (100 mL) at reflux to give a pale yellow solution. After cooling to ambient temperature, the crystals that formed were collected by filtration and washed with acetonitrile (100 mL). The product was dried in vacuo at 4Q°C for 1 hour to give 17.5 g (87%) of sub-title compound.<br>

10    The crude sub-title product is isolated as a monohydrate.<br>
Ethanol (500 mL) and water (250 mL) were added to crude sub-title compound (50.0 g). The solution was heated to 75°C. Material was all dissolved at 55°C. The solution was held at 75°C for 5 minutes, then cooled to 5°C over 1 hour.    Precipitation started at 18°C.    The cold<br>
15 solution was filtered and the filtrate washed with ethanol:water (2:1; 150 mL), sucked dry on the filter, and then dried in vacuo at 40°C to give pure sub-title product (41.2 g, 82%).<br>
