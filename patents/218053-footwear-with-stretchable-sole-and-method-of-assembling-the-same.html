				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>Sole with stretchable structure, a footwear article provided with such a sole and its assembly method. The inventiion relates to a footwear sole where the forepart is associated with a stretchable material making it possible to fit differeing foot widths easily ; it also relates to the footwear equipped with such a sole and the method for mounting this footwear. It is constituted of a sole base (1) comprising openings (4) in which the lugs (3) of the stretchable part (2) are positioned in a sealed manner. The insole (5) comprises a deformable structure (6) in its forepart. When the wearer&#x27;s foot is put into a footwear article provided with such a complex, it exerts pressure on the edges of the upper (10) thus causing deformation of the sole. This ability of deforming the sole avoids feelings of compression of the foot. The device according to the inventiion is intended in particular for the manufacture of footwear with the ability of adapting to differing foot anatomies.</td>

				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a Footwear with stretchable sole and method of assembling the same.<br>
Osually shoes are manufactured with a width chosen by the manufacturer. This width nay be bigger or smaller but it 1s predetermined? it does not vary as a tunction of the width of the wearer's foot."<br>
It is also known how to adapt to several foot widths by manufacturing an upper part in elastic material, but without beiag able to enlarge the lower part in contact with the sole.<br>
The device according to the invention makes it possible to remedy these disadvantages. In fact, according to a first specification, it comprises a sole with at least one stretchable area in the forepart of the foot; thus, when worn, the manufactured shoe fits the anatomic width of the foot on its lower part.<br>
In the shoe sole according to the invention, the transversally stretchable forepart is obtained by moulding (or gluing}, on a sole base, one or several<br>
inserts of a material with deformable structure possessing an elasticity potential and a shape memory adapted to the comfort required. This stretchable insert is flat on the upper face and provided with one or several lugs on the lower face.<br>
These lugs are intended to be set countersunk in the base of the sole. According to another specification, the sole base is manufactured from a classic type of material such as leather, elastomer, rubber, polyurethane or any other material used traditionally for the manufacture of shoe soles and possessing the normal abrasion resistance specifications.<br>
According to another specification, the base of the sole comprises openings intended to receive the lugs of the lower face of the stretchable insert, while still preserving the sealing of the link between the two materials. According to another specification, an insole is constituted of one or several cut-out zones in the forepart of the foot and a rigid back part.<br>
This structure of the forepart of the insole allows transversal deformation of the forepart zone.<br>
Other embodiments of the insole can be envisaged. The deformable part of the forepart can be made simply by juxtaposition of longitudinal slits. According to another embodiment, the deformable part of the forepart can bc; obtained by producing one or several longitudinal openings, these being filled or not by moulding or gluing one or several inserts of stretchable material.<br>
The Invention also concerns the footwear article equipped with the stretchable sole as described above. According to a preferred embodiment, this footwear article is constituted of an upper, the insole with a deformable forepart and a rigid back part, of a non-glued<br><br>
sock lining in its peripheral part and of the stretchable insert sole according to the present invention.<br>
When the user tries on a footwear article provided with such a complex, the foot exerts pressure on the edges of the upper, causing deformation of the insole and the sole. This ability of the sole and the insole to be deformed avoids any feeling of the foot being compressed.<br>
The method of assembling this footwear article consists of preparing an insole with a rigid back part and a deformable part in the forepart area of the foot. Using a standard width last, the upper is mounted on said insole and glued on the sole equipped with its stretchable insert. Finally, the insole is set inside the shoe.<br>
The invention is illustrated, without being limited in any way, by the description of a preferred embodiment, provided only as an example and shown in the attached drawings in which figure 1 represents the sole as seen from above.<br>
Figure 2 shows a longitudinal'section of the sole.<br>
Figure 3 shows an exploded view of the sole base, elastic insert and insole as a whole.<br>
Figure 4 shows a section in perspective of a shoe equipped with the system.<br>
The sole shown in figures 1 and 2 is constituted of a sole base 1 and of an insert in stretchable material 2, assembled by moulding or by gluing to ensure that there is a seal between the two materials. The lugs 3 of the stretchable insert are positioned in the openings 4 made in the base of the sole.<br>
In the embodiment example shown, this type of implantation in parallel allows the addition of the elastic properties of each lug 3. This complex, with<br><br>
rigid sole base and stretchable insert makes it possible to obtain a sole that is sufficiently structured to be adapted to traditional soldering manufacture.<br>
figure 3 shows a stack of independent supports with deformable and stretchable properties. The sole base 1 in rigid material is made deformable through the openings 4 made in the forepart area.<br>
The insert 2 with lugs 3 which have been countersunk in the openings 4 of the sole base 1 is a stretchable sealed joint.<br>
The insole 5 is equipped with a foot forepart made deformable by the presence of longitudinal slits 6 and a rigid back part 7.<br>
In the embodimsnt as a whole shown in figure 4, this configuration makes it possible to maintain elasticity at every stage once the assembly has been completed. The sole base 1, the insert 2 and the insole 5 possess stretchable properties outside the gluing zones 9.<br>
The sock- lining 8, non-glued at the periphery, does not block the deformation of the lower layers.<br>
It is the pressure of the foot on the external edges of the upper 10 which produces the deformation of the superposed stretchable layers as a whole.<br>
As a non-limiting examplc, the dimensions of the insert at the level of the lugs should be of the order of 3.5 mm in thickness and 7 mm in width.<br>
It should be understood that these dimensions are only provided as indications; they can vary in function of the size and comfort required for the shoe.<br>
This shoe structure provides walking comfort suitable, in particular, for "sensitive feet items", but evidently this stretchable structure can be envisaged for<br><br>
other types of assembly besides soldering or other types of footwear.<br>
The present invention is intended, in particular, for the manufacture of shoes with the ability to adapt to varying foot widths.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
We claim:<br>
1.	Footwear with stretchable sole making it possible for different foot width to be fitted easily, comprising a rigid sole base (1) glued (9) onto the edges of the upper (10), characterized in that said sole base having an insert (2) transversally stretchable and provided with lugs (3) on its lower surface, the said insert (2) being produced by moulding a material with memorized shape and glued or soldered by injection on the forepart of the said sole base (1) provided with openings (4) in its base into which the said lugs (3) are countersunk, in a sealed way.<br>
2.	Footwear as claimed in claim 1, wherein base of the said rigid sole (1) has resistive properties suitable for abrasion.<br>
3.	Footwear as claimed in claim 1, wherein it is provided with an insole (5) equipped with a foot forepart made deformable by the presence of longitudinal slits (6) and a rigid back part (7).<br><br>
4.	Footwear as claimed in claims 1 to 3, wherein the said sole base (1), insert (2), and insole (5) posses stretchable properties outside the gluing zone (9).<br>
5.	Footwear as claimed in claims 1 to 4, wherein it is the pressure of the foot on the external edges of the upper (10) which produces the deformation of the superposed stretchable layer as a whole.<br>
5. Method of assembly of the footwear as claimed in any one of the claims 1 to 5, wherein the steps comprising;<br>
-	preparation of a sole sub-assembly, by assembling a rigid sole base (1) and a stretchable insert (2), glued or moulded on said base,<br>
-	preparation and assembly of the insole (5) and its deformable foot forepart (6) with its rigid back part (7),<br>
-	mounting and gluing using a last of standard shape of the upper (10) on the insole<br>
