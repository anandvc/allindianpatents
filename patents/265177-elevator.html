				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td> <br><br>
The present invention relates to an elevator prefer-<br>
ably an elevator without machine room and to a<br>
method for preventing/stopping the motion of an elevator.<br>
One of the objectives in elevator development work is<br>
to achieve an efficient and economical utilization of<br>
building space. In recent years, this development work<br>
has produced various elevator solutions without ma-<br>
 chine room and without counterweight, among other<br>
things. Good examples of elevators without machine<br>
room and without counterweight are disclosed in spe-<br>
cifications FI 20021959 and FI 20030153. The elevators<br>
described in these specifications are fairly efficient<br>
 in respect of space utilization as they have made it<br>
possible to eliminate the space required by the elev-<br>
ator machine room in the building and the space re-<br>
quired by the counterweight in the elevator shaft<br>
without a need to enlarge the elevator shaft.<br>
 In these basically good elevator solutions, the space<br>
required by the hoisting machine limits the freedom of<br>
choice in elevator lay-out solutions. Some space is<br>
needed to provide for the passage of the hoisting<br>
ropes. Stopping the motion of the elevator car at a<br>
 desired point especially in situations where the ele-<br>
vator is driven onto the buffers fitted in the eleva-<br>
tor shaft space below or above the elevator car or<br>
when the car is to be prevented from going too far up.<br>
In modernization of elevators, the space available in<br>
 the elevator shaft has often limited the sphere of ap-<br>
plication of the concept of elevator without machine<br>
room. Especially when hydraulic elevators are to be<br>
modernized or replaced, it is not practical to apply<br>
an elevator solution without machine room due to a<br><br>
lack of space in the elevator shaft especially in a<br>
situation where the hydraulic elevator to be modern-<br>
ized or replaced has no counterweight. Ensuring a<br>
safety space in the shaft is also a problematic task<br>
in connection with elevator solutions without counter-<br>
weight, especially ensuring a safety space above the<br>
elevator car and stopping an upward motion of the ele-<br>
vator.<br>
The aim of the invention is to achieve at least one<br>
the following objectives. On the one hand, it is an<br>
objective of the invention to develop the elevator<br>
without machine room so as to achieve more efficient<br>
space utilization in the building and in the elevator<br>
shaft than before. This means that the elevator should<br>
permit of being installed in a relatively narrow ele-<br>
vator shaft if necessary. On the other hand, it is an<br>
objective of the invention to achieve an elevator,<br>
preferably an elevator without counterweight, wherein<br>
it is possible to prevent and stop the motion of the<br>
elevator at a desired point in order to form the re-<br>
quired safety space in the elevator shaft, especially<br>
in situations where a serviceman wants to go onto the<br>
top of the car. It is an objective to ensure a safety<br>
space in the elevator and to prevent it from being<br>
driven too far up.<br>
The elevator of the invention is characterized by what<br>
is disclosed in the characterization part of claim 1,<br>
the method of the invention is characterized by what<br>
is disclosed in the characterization part of claim 10,<br>
and the use of the invention is characterized by what<br>
is disclosed in claim 11. Other embodiments of the in-<br>
vention are characterized by what is disclosed in the<br>
other claims. Inventive embodiments are also presented<br>
in the description part of the present application. The<br>
inventive content disclosed in the application can also<br><br>
be defined in other ways than is done in the claims be-<br>
low. The inventive content may also consist of several<br>
separate inventions, especially if the invention is<br>
considered in the light of explicit or implicit sub-<br>
tasks or in respect of advantages or sets of advantages<br>
achieved. In this case, some of the attributes con-<br>
tained in the claims below may be superfluous from the<br>
point of view of separate inventive concepts.<br>
By applying the invention, one or more of the follow-<br>
ing advantages, among others, can be achieved:<br>
-	the motion of the elevator of the invention can be<br>
stopped at a desired point in a simple and easy man-<br>
ner<br>
-	the upper safety space of the elevator can be easily<br>
ensured by applying the invention<br>
-	the safety and reliability of the elevator of the<br>
invention are improved<br>
-	the elevator and method of the invention are cheap<br>
solutions to implement<br>
-	as the motion of the elevator is prevented/stopped<br>
by means of a gripping element at a point as close<br>
to the hoisting machine as possible, the delay<br>
caused by the elongation of the rope is as small as<br>
possible and the elevator car stops within a short<br>
distance<br>
-	in addition, as the motion is stopped by a point as<br>
close to the hoisting machine as possible, the rope<br>
force required to keep the elevator car immovable is<br>
as small as possible<br>
-	when the elevator and method of the invention are<br>
used, savings in material and installation costs are<br>
achieved as compared to prior-art heavy and expen-<br>
sive structures in which a buffer is used, upward<br>
motion of the elevator car is easy to stop and when<br>
downward travel of the elevator is again started,<br>
the gripping element can be released automatically,<br><br>
allowing the elevator to move normally and the com-<br>
pensating gear to function in the normal way.<br>
The primary area of application of the invention is<br>
elevators designed for transporting people and/or<br>
goods. A normal area of application of the invention<br>
is in elevators whose speed range is about or below<br>
1.0 m/s but may also be higher. For example, an eleva-<br>
tor traveling at a speed of 0.6 m/s is easy to imple-<br>
ment according to the invention.<br>
In both passenger and freight elevators, many advan-<br>
tages provided by the invention are pronouncedly ap-<br>
parent even in elevators for only 2-4 persons, and em-<br>
phatically apparent already in elevators for 6-8 per-<br>
sons (500-630 kg).<br>
In the elevator of the invention, normal elevator<br>
ropes, such as generally used steel wire ropes, are<br>
applicable. The elevator may use ropes of synthetic<br>
material and rope structures with a synthetic-fiber<br>
load-bearing part, such as e.g. so-called "aramid" or<br>
kevlar ropes, which have recently been proposed for<br>
use in elevators. Applicable solutions are also steel-<br>
reinforced flat belts, especially because of the small<br>
deflection radius they permit. Particularly advanta-<br>
geously applicable for use in the elevator of the in-<br>
vention are elevator hoisting ropes twisted from e.g.<br>
round and strong wires. Using round wires, the rope<br>
can be twisted in many ways using wires of the same or<br>
different thicknesses. In ropes well applicable with<br>
the invention, the wire thickness is below 0.4 mm on<br>
an average. Well-suited ropes made from strong wires<br>
are those in which the average wire thickness is under<br>
0.3 mm or even under 0.2 mm. For example, thin-wired<br>
and strong 4-mm ropes can be twisted relatively advan-<br>
tageously from wires such that the average wire thick-<br><br>
ness in the finished ropes is between 0.15 ...0.25 mm,<br>
the thinnest wires having a thickness even as small as<br>
0.1 mm. Thin rope wires can easily be made quite<br>
strong. In the invention it is possible to use rope<br>
wires having a strength e.g. as high as about 2 00 0<br>
N/mm2. Appropriate rope wire strengths are 2100-2700<br>
N/mm2. In principle, it is possible to use rope wires<br>
of a strength of about 3000 N/mm2 or even more.<br>
The elevator of the invention, in which the elevator<br>
car is supported by a set of hoisting ropes comprising<br>
one rope or a number of parallel ropes, and which has<br>
a traction sheave that moves the elevator car by means<br>
of the hoisting ropes, comprises hoisting rope por-<br>
tions going upwards and downwards from the elevator<br>
car, and the rope portions starting from the elevator<br>
car in the direction of the upper rope portion are un-<br>
der a first rope tension (T1) and the rope portions<br>
starting from the elevator car in the direction of the<br>
lower rope portion are under a second rope tension<br>
(T2). In addition, the elevator comprises a compensat-<br>
ing device acting on the hoisting ropes to equalize<br>
and/or compensate the rope tension and/or rope elonga-<br>
tion and/or to render the ratio of the first and the<br>
second rope tensions (T1/T2) substantially constant.<br>
The motion of the elevator is prevented and/or stopped<br>
by increasing the ratio of the first rope tension (T1)<br>
to the second rope tension (T2) .<br>
In the method of the invention for preventing/stopping<br>
the motion of an elevator, in which elevator the ele-<br>
vator car is at least partially supported by a set of<br>
hoisting ropes comprising one rope or a number of par-<br>
allel ropes. The elevator has a traction sheave which<br>
moves the elevator car by means of the hoisting ropes,<br>
and which elevator has hoisting rope portions going<br>
upwards and downwards from the elevator car. The rope<br><br>
portions going from the traction sheave in the direc-<br>
tion of the rope portion above the elevator car are<br>
under a first rope tension (T1) and the rope portions<br>
going from the traction sheave in the direction of the<br>
rope portion below the elevator car are under a second<br>
rope tension (T2) - The elevator has a compensating de-<br>
vice acting on the hoisting ropes to equalize and/or<br>
compensate the rope tension and/or rope elongation<br>
and/or to render the ratio of the first and the second<br>
rope tensions (T1/T2) substantially constant. In the<br>
method, the motion of the elevator is prevented and/or<br>
stopped by increasing the ratio of the first rope ten-<br>
sion (T1) to the second rope tension (T2) .<br>
By increasing the contact angle using a rope pulley<br>
that functions as a diverting pulley, the grip between<br>
the traction sheave and the hoisting ropes can be im-<br>
proved. This makes it possible to reduce the weight of<br>
the car and also to increase its size, thereby in-<br>
creasing the space saving potential of the elevator. A<br>
contact angle of over 180° between the traction sheave<br>
and the hoisting rope is achieved by using a diverting<br>
pulley or diverting pulleys. The compensating device,<br>
which compensates the rope elongation, maintains a<br>
suitable T1/T2 ratio to ensure a grip between the<br>
hoisting rope and the traction sheave that is suffi-<br>
cient for the operation and safety of the elevator. On<br>
the other hand, it is essential for the operation and<br>
safety of the elevator that the rope below the eleva-<br>
tor car in an elevator solution without counterweight<br>
be kept at a sufficient tension. In addition, the in-<br>
vention makes it possible to limit the use of the ele-<br>
vator in its normal operating area, which is the area<br>
within which the elevator can be safely operated. It<br>
is possible to ensure especially the overhead safety<br>
space required for the elevator car and, if necessary,<br>
the invention can also be used to define and delimit<br><br>
other functional areas for the elevator. For example,<br>
it is possible to define for the elevator a maximum<br>
operating area in the direction of the upper part of<br>
the elevator shaft so that the elevator can not be<br>
driven upwards beyond this area, which area is larger<br>
than the overhead safety space required when work is<br>
being carried out from the top of the elevator car. In<br>
addition to this, it is possible to define a second<br>
area, which is an area where a larger overhead safety<br>
space is defined, in which case the elevator can not<br>
be driven as far up as in the maximum operating area,<br>
and which safety space meets the requirements stipu-<br>
lated e.g. when work is being carried out from the top<br>
of the elevator car.<br>
In the following, the invention will be described in<br>
detail with reference to a few embodiment examples and<br>
the attached drawings, wherein<br>
Fig. 1 presents a diagrammatic view of a traction<br>
sheave elevator without counterweight accord-<br>
ing to the invention,<br>
Fig. 2 presents a diagrammatic view of a second<br>
traction sheave elevator without counter-<br>
weight according to the invention,<br>
Fig. 3 presents a diagrammatic view of a third trac-<br>
tion sheave elevator without counterweight<br>
according to the invention.<br>
Fig. 1 is a diagrammatic representation of the struc-<br>
ture of an elevator according to the invention. The<br>
elevator is preferably an elevator without machine<br>
room and with a drive machine 4 placed in the elevator<br>
shaft. The elevator presented in the figure is a trac-<br>
tion sheave elevator with machine above and without<br>
counterweight. The hoisting ropes 3 of the elevator<br><br>
run as follows: One end of the hoisting ropes 3 is<br>
fastened to a fixing point 16 on a lever 15 immovably<br>
fitted fast on the elevator car 1, said point 16 being<br>
at a distance from the pivot 17 connecting the lever<br>
to the elevator car 1. Thus, in the situation illus-<br>
trated in Fig. 1, the lever 15 used as a compensating<br>
device is pivoted on the elevator car 1 at fastening<br>
point 17. From the fixing point 16, the hoisting ropes<br>
3 go upwards and meet a diverting pulley 14 mounted<br>
above the elevator car 1 in the elevator shaft, pref-<br>
erably in the upper part of the elevator shaft, from<br>
which diverting pulley the ropes 3 go further down-<br>
wards to a diverting pulley 13 on the elevator car,<br>
and from which diverting pulley 13 the ropes go again<br>
upwards to a diverting pulley 12 fitted in the upper<br>
part of the elevator shaft above the elevator car.<br>
From diverting pulley 12, the ropes go further down-<br>
wards to a diverting pulley 11 mounted on the elevator<br>
car, and having passed around this diverting pulley<br>
the ropes go further upwards to a diverting pulley 10<br>
fitted in the upper part of the of the elevator shaft,<br>
and having passed around it the ropes go back down-<br>
wards to diverting pulley 9 fitted on the elevator<br>
car. Having passed around diverting pulley 9, the<br>
hoisting ropes 3 go further upwards to the traction<br>
sheave 5 of the drive machine 4 placed in the upper<br>
part of the of the elevator shaft, having first passed<br>
via a diverting pulley 7 in "tangential contact" with<br>
it. This means that the ropes 3 going from the trac-<br>
tion sheave 5 to the elevator car 1 pass via the rope<br>
grooves of diverting pulley 7 and the deflection of<br>
the rope 3 caused by the diverting pulley 7 is very<br>
small. It could be stated that the ropes going from<br>
the traction sheave 5 only run in "tangential contact"<br>
with the diverting pulley 7. Such "tangential contact"<br>
functions as a solution damping vibrations of the out-<br><br>
going ropes and it can also be applied in other roping f<br>
solutions. The ropes pass around the traction sheave 5 l<br>
of the drive machine 4 along the rope grooves of the<br>
traction sheave 5. From the traction sheave 5, the<br>
ropes go further downwards to diverting pulley 7, pass<br>
around it along the rope grooves of the diverting pul-<br>
ley 7 and return back up to the traction sheave 5,<br>
passing around it along the rope grooves of the trac-<br>
tion sheave. From the traction sheave 5, the ropes 3<br>
go further downwards in "tangential contact" with di-<br>
verting pulley 7 past the elevator car to a diverting<br>
pulley 8 placed in the lower part of the elevator<br>
shaft, passing around it along rope grooves provided<br>
on it. From the diverting pulley 8 in the lower part<br>
of the elevator shaft, the ropes go further upwards to<br>
a diverting pulley 18 on the elevator car, from which<br>
pulley the ropes 3 go further to a diverting pulley 19<br>
in the lower part of the elevator shaft and further<br>
back upwards to a diverting pulley 2 0 on the elevator<br>
car, from which pulley the ropes go further to a di-<br>
verting pulley 22 on the elevator car, from which pul-<br>
ley the ropes 3 go further to a diverting pulley 23 in<br>
the lower part of the elevator shaft. From diverting<br>
pulley 23, the ropes 3 go further to the lever 15,<br>
which is fixedly pivoted on the elevator car 1 at<br>
point 17 and to which lever 15 the second end of the<br>
ropes 3 is immovably fixed at point 24 at a distance b<br>
from the pivot 17. In the case illustrated in Fig. 1,<br>
the hoisting machine and diverting pulleys are pref-<br>
erably all placed on one and the same side of the ele-<br>
vator car, but they may also be located on different<br>
sides of the elevator car. This solution is particu-<br>
larly advantageous in the case of a rucksack-type ele-<br>
vator solution, wherein the components in question are<br>
located behind the elevator car in the space between<br>
the elevator car and the back wall of the shaft. The<br><br>
roping between diverting pulley 7 and the traction<br>
sheave 5 is referred to as Double Wrap roping, in<br>
which roping the hoisting ropes are passed around the<br>
traction sheave twice and/or more than twice. In this<br>
way the contact angle can be increased in two and/or<br>
more stages. For example, the contact angle between<br>
the traction sheave 5 and the hoisting ropes 3<br>
achieved in the embodiment presented in Fig. 1 is 180°<br>
+ 180°, i.e. 360°. The Double Wrap roping presented the<br>
figure can also be arranged in another way, such as<br>
e.g. by placing diverting pulley 7 on the side of the<br>
traction sheave 5, so that as the hoisting ropes run<br>
twice around the traction sheave, the contact angle<br>
will be 180° + 90°, i.e. 270°, or by placing the di-<br>
verting pulley at some other suitable point. An advan-<br>
tageous solution is to place the traction sheave 5 and<br>
diverting pulley 7 in such manner that the diverting<br>
pulley 7 simultaneously functions as a guide of the<br>
hoisting ropes 3 and as a damping pulley. Diverting<br>
pulleys 14,13,12,11,10,9,7 together with the traction<br>
sheave 5 of the hoisting machine 4 form the suspension<br>
above the elevator car, which has the same suspension<br>
ratio as the suspension below the elevator car, which<br>
suspension ratio in Fig. 1 is 7:1. The rope portions<br>
going from the traction sheave 5 in the direction of<br>
the rope portion above the elevator car 1 are under a<br>
first rope tension (T2). Diverting pulleys<br>
8,18,19,2 0,21,22,23 form the suspension and rope por-<br>
tion below the elevator car. The rope portions going<br>
from the traction sheave in the direction of the rope<br>
portion below the elevator car are under a second rope<br>
tension (T2) . The hoisting machine 4 and traction<br>
sheave 5 of the elevator and/or the diverting pulleys<br>
7,10,12,14 in the upper part of the elevator shaft may<br>
be mounted in place on a frame structure formed by the<br>
guide rails 2 or on a beam structure at the upper end<br><br>
of the elevator shaft or separately in the elevator<br>
shaft or on some other appropriate mounting arrange-<br>
ment. The diverting pulleys in the lower part of the<br>
elevator shaft may be mounted in place on a frame<br>
structure formed by the guide rails 2 or to a beam<br>
structure placed at the lower end of the elevator<br>
shaft or separately in the lower part of the elevator<br>
shaft or on some other appropriate mounting arrange-<br>
ment. The diverting pulleys on the elevator car may be<br>
mounted in place on the frame structure of the eleva-<br>
tor car 1, e.g. on the car frame, or to a beam struc-<br>
ture or beam structures in the elevator car or sepa-<br>
rately on the elevator car or some other appropriate<br>
mounting arrangement. The diverting pulleys may also<br>
be of a modular construction, e.g. such that they are<br>
separate modular structures, such as e.g. cassette-<br>
type structures, which are fitted in place on the<br>
shaft structure of the elevator, on the structures of<br>
the elevator car and/or car frame or in some other ap-<br>
propriate place in the elevator shaft or in its vicin-<br>
ity or in conjunction with the elevator car. The di-<br>
verting pulleys placed in the elevator shaft and the<br>
hoisting machine equipment and/or the diverting pul-<br>
leys fitted in place in conjunction with the elevator<br>
car may be placed either all on one side of the eleva-<br>
tor car in the space between the elevator car and the<br>
elevator shaft or in a desired manner on different<br>
sides of the elevator car. The roping between the<br>
traction sheave 4 and diverting pulley 7 may also be<br>
implemented in other ways than as Double Wrap roping,<br>
e.g. as Single Wrap roping, in which case diverting<br>
pulley 7 is not necessarily needed at all, as ESW rop-<br>
ing (Extended Single Wrap) or by using some other cor-<br>
responding roping solution appropriate for the pur-<br>
pose .<br><br>
The drive machine 4 placed in the elevator shaft is<br>
preferably of a flat construction, in other words, the<br>
machine has a small thickness dimension as compared to<br>
its width and/or height, or at least the machine is<br>
slim enough to be accommodated between the elevator<br>
car and a wall of the elevator shaft. The machine may<br>
also be placed differently, e.g. by disposing the slim<br>
machine partly or completely between an imaginary ex-<br>
tension of the elevator car and a shaft wall. In the<br>
elevator of the invention, it is possible to use a<br>
drive machine 4 of almost any type and design that<br>
fits into the space intended for it. For example, it<br>
is possible to use a geared or a gearless machine. The<br>
machine may be of a compact and/or flat size. In the<br>
suspension solutions according to the invention, the<br>
rope speed is often high as compared to the speed of<br>
the elevator, so it is possible to use even unsophis-<br>
ticated machine types as the basic machine solution.<br>
The elevator shaft is advantageously provided with<br>
equipment required for the supply of power to the mo-<br>
tor driving the traction sheave 5 as well as equipment<br>
needed for elevator control, both of which can be<br>
placed in a common instrument panel 6 or mounted sepa-<br>
rately from each other or integrated partly or wholly<br>
with the drive machine 4. A preferable solution is a<br>
gearless machine comprising a permanent magnet motor.<br>
The drive machine may be fixed to a wall of the eleva-<br>
tor shaft, to the ceiling, to a guide rail or to some<br>
other structure, such as a beam or frame. In the case<br>
of an elevator with machine below, a further possibil-<br>
ity is to mount the machine on the bottom of the ele-<br>
vator shaft. Fig. 1 illustrates a preferred suspension<br>
solution in which the suspension ratio of the divert-<br>
ing pulleys above the elevator car and the diverting<br>
pulleys below the elevator car is the same 7:1 suspen-<br>
sion in both cases. To visualize this ratio in prac-<br><br>
tice, it means the ratio of the distance traveled by<br>
the hoisting rope to the distance traveled by the ele-<br>
vator car. The suspension arrangement above the eleva-<br>
tor car 1 is implemented by means of diverting pulleys<br>
14,13,12,11,10,9 and the suspension arrangement below<br>
the elevator car 1 is implemented by means of divert-<br>
ing pulleys 23,22,21,20,19,18,8. Other suspension so-<br>
lutions can also be used to implement the invention.<br>
The elevator of the invention can also be implemented<br>
as a solution comprising a machine room, or the ma-<br>
chine may be mounted so as to be movable together with<br>
the elevator.<br>
The function of the lever 15 pivoted on the elevator<br>
car 1 at point 17 in Fig. 1 and serving as a compen-<br>
sating device is to equalize and/or compensate rope<br>
tension and/or rope elongation and/or to render the<br>
ratio between the first and second rope tensions<br>
(T1/T2) substantially constant. It is essential to the<br>
operation and safety of the elevator that a suffi-<br>
cient tension be maintained in the lower rope por-<br>
tion, which refers to that part of the hoisting rope<br>
which is below the elevator car. By means of the<br>
lever arrangement 15 illustrated in Fig. 1, the ten-<br>
sioning of the hoisting rope can be implemented in<br>
such manner that the ratio T1/T2 between the rope<br>
forces Tx and T2 acting in different directions on the<br>
traction sheave 5 can be kept at a desired constant<br>
value, which may be e.g. 2. This ratio to be kept<br>
constant can be varied by varying the distances a and<br>
b, because Tx/T2 = b/a. When odd suspension ratios are<br>
used in the suspension of the elevator car, the lever<br>
15 is pivoted on the elevator car, and when even sus-<br>
pension ratios are used, the lever 15 used as an<br>
equalizing device is pivoted on the elevator shaft.<br><br>
Fig. 1 presents a device according to the invention<br>
that stops / prevents an elevator from moving too far<br>
up. From the reduction or disappearance of rope ten-<br>
sion T2 it follows that the friction between the trac-<br>
tion sheave and the hoisting ropes is lost, so that it<br>
becomes impossible to hoist the elevator car 1. In<br>
Fig. 1 a stopper element 2 5 arranged to meet the lever<br>
15 used as a compensating device has been fitted in<br>
the elevator shaft at a point 2 6 such that by means of<br>
the stopper element a desired overhead space is en-<br>
sured between the between the elevator car and the<br>
ceiling of the elevator shaft and the elevator car can<br>
be prevented from moving upwards beyond the desired<br>
point in the elevator shaft. When the elevator car 1<br>
is moving upwards and reaches the point beyond which<br>
the motion of the elevator car is to be prevented, the<br>
lever 15 used as the compensating device of the eleva-<br>
tor meets the stopper element 25, which turns the<br>
lever 15 downwards, thereby slackening the rope por-<br>
tion below the elevator car 1, as a result of which<br>
rope tension T2 disappears and the ratio T1/T2 between<br>
the first and the second rope tensions increases. Con-<br>
sequently, the motion of the elevator car 1 is<br>
stopped. In addition to stopper element 25, the eleva-<br>
tor of the invention can also be provided with a sec-<br>
ond stopper element, which can be so fitted in the<br>
elevator shaft that it can be used to guarantee a suf-<br>
ficient safety space above the elevator car e.g. dur-<br>
ing maintenance work. The second stopper element can<br>
be arranged to be set into the safety position, i.e.<br>
the position in which it will meet the compensating<br>
device 15, either manually or electrically, e.g. upon<br>
being activated via a service box provided on the car<br>
top. When the serviceman leaves the car top and main-<br>
tenance operation is terminated, the stopper is re-<br>
turned either manually or electrically to the final<br><br>
position in which it no longer meets the compensating<br>
device 15. The second stopper element may be provided<br>
with a safety switch that prevents normal operation of<br>
the elevator when the stopper is in the safety posi-<br>
tion.<br>
Fig. 2 presents a general illustration of a traction<br>
sheave elevator without counterweight according to the<br>
invention, wherein the elevator car is prevented from<br>
moving too far up in the elevator shaft. The elevator<br>
presented the figure is an elevator according to Fig.<br>
1, with the difference that the elevator in Fig. 2 has<br>
a suspension ratio of 8:1 and is provided with a dif-<br>
ferent compensating device 224. The elevator is a<br>
traction sheave elevator without counterweight, with<br>
an elevator car 1 moving along guide rails 202. In<br>
elevators with a large hoisting height, the elongation<br>
of the hoisting rope involves a need to compensate the<br>
rope elongation, which has to be done reliably within<br>
certain allowed limit values. It is essential in re-<br>
spect of elevator operation and safety that the rope<br>
portion below the elevator car be kept sufficiently<br>
tight. In the rope force compensating device 224 pre-<br>
sented in Fig. 2, a very long movement is achieved for<br>
the compensation of rope elongation. This permits the<br>
compensation of even large elongations. The compensat-<br>
ing device 224 according to the invention presented in<br>
Fig. 2 produces a constant ratio T3./T2 between the rope<br>
forces Ti and T2 acting on the traction sheave. In the<br>
case illustrated in Fig. 2, the ratio T1(/T2 is about<br>
2/1. With even suspension ratios above and below the<br>
elevator car, the compensating device 224 is fitted in<br>
the elevator shaft or in some other corresponding ap-<br>
propriate place not in conjunction with the elevator<br>
car, and with odd suspension ratios above and below<br>
the elevator car the compensating device 224 is fitted<br>
in conjunction with the elevator car 1.<br><br>
In Fig. 1, the hoisting ropes run as follows: One end<br>
of the hoisting ropes 3 is fixed to a diverting pulley<br>
225 fitted to hang on a rope portion coming downwards<br>
from diverting pulley 216. Diverting pulleys 216 and<br>
22 5 together with the fixing point 22 6 of the second<br>
end of the hoisting rope constitute a rope force<br>
equalizing device 224. This compensating device 224 is<br>
fitted in place in the elevator shaft. From diverting<br>
pulley 225, the hoisting ropes 203 go upwards and meet<br>
a diverting pulley 216 placed above the elevator car<br>
in the elevator shaft, preferably in the upper part of<br>
the elevator shaft, passing around it along rope<br>
grooves provided on the diverting pulley 216. From di-<br>
verting pulley 216, the ropes go further downwards to<br>
a diverting pulley 215 fitted in place on the elevator<br>
car, and having passed around this pulley the ropes go<br>
further upwards to a diverting pulley 214 fitted in<br>
place in the upper part of the elevator shaft. Having<br>
passed around diverting pulley 214, the ropes come<br>
again downwards to a diverting pulley 213 fitted in<br>
place on the elevator car, pass around it and go fur-<br>
ther upwards to a diverting pulley 212 fitted in place<br>
in the upper part of the elevator shaft, and having<br>
passed around this pulley the hoisting ropes 2 03 go<br>
further downwards to a diverting pulley 211 fitted in<br>
place on the elevator car. Having passed around this<br>
pulley 211, the hoisting ropes go further upwards to a<br>
diverting pulley 210 fitted in place in the upper part<br>
of the of the elevator shaft, and having passed around<br>
it the hoisting ropes 2 03 go further downwards to a<br>
diverting pulley 209 fitted in place on the elevator<br>
car, and having passed around this pulley the ropes<br>
2 03 go further upwards in tangential contact with di-<br>
verting pulley 207 to the traction sheave 205. Divert-<br>
ing pulley 207 is preferably fitted near and/or in<br><br>
conjunction with the hoisting machine 204. Between di-<br>
verting pulley 207 and the traction sheave 205 of the<br>
hoisting machine 2 04, Fig. 2 shows Double Wrap (DW)<br>
roping, as in connection with Fig. 1. Diverting pul-<br>
leys 216,214,213,212,211,210,209,207 together with the<br>
traction sheave 205 of the hoisting machine 2 04 form<br>
the suspension above the elevator car, which has the<br>
same suspension ratio as the suspension below the ele-<br>
vator car, which suspension ratio in Fig. 2 is 8:1.<br>
The rope portions going from the traction sheave in<br>
the direction of the suspension above the elevator car<br>
are under a first rope tension (T1) . From the traction<br>
sheave 2 05, the ropes go further in tangential contact<br>
with diverting pulley 207 to diverting pulley 208,<br>
which is preferably fitted in place in the lower part<br>
of the elevator shaft. Having passed around diverting<br>
pulley 208, the ropes 203 go further upwards to a di-<br>
verting pulley 218 fitted in place on the elevator<br>
car, and having, passed around said diverting pulley<br>
218 the ropes go further downwards to a diverting pul-<br>
ley 219 in the lower part of the elevator shaft and,<br>
having passed around this pulley, return to a divert-<br>
ing pulley 22 0 fitted in place on the elevator car.<br>
Having passed around diverting pulley 220, the hoist-<br>
ing ropes 2 03 go further downwards to a diverting pul-<br>
ley 221 fitted in place in the lower part of the ele-<br>
vator shaft, pass around it and go further upwards to<br>
a diverting pulley 222 on the elevator car. Having<br>
passed around diverting pulley 222, the hoisting ropes<br>
2 03 go further downwards to a diverting pulley 223<br>
fitted in place in the lower part of the elevator<br>
shaft, pass around it and go further upwards to a di-<br>
verting pulley. 228 on the elevator car. having passed<br>
around diverting pulley 228, the hoisting ropes 203 go<br>
further downwards to a diverting pulley 227 fitted in<br>
place in the lower part of the elevator shaft, and<br><br>
having passed around it the hoisting ropes go further<br>
upwards to the diverting pulley 225 of the compensat-<br>
ing device, pass around it and go further to the fix-<br>
ing point 226 of their second end, which is located in<br>
a suitable place in the elevator shaft. Diverting pul-<br>
leys 208,218,219,220,221,222,223,228,227 form the sus-<br>
pension and rope portion below the elevator car, which<br>
rope portion is subject to a second rope tension T2.<br>
The elevator presented in Fig. 2 comprises a compen-<br>
sating device designed to equalize and/or compensate<br>
the rope tension and/or rope elongation and/or to ren-<br>
der the ratio of the first and the second rope ten-<br>
sions (T1/T2) substantially constant, the action of the<br>
compensating device being produced by the motion of<br>
diverting pulley 225. The diverting pulley 225 moves<br>
through a limited distance, thereby compensating elon-<br>
gations of the hoisting ropes 303. In addition, this<br>
arrangement keeps the rope tension over the traction<br>
sheave 2 05 at a constant level, so that the Tl/T2 ratio<br>
between the rope tensions in the situation illustrated<br>
in Fig. 2 is about 2/1. It is also possible to imple-<br>
ment the compensating device 224 in other ways besides<br>
that described in the example, such as e.g. by using<br>
more complex suspension arrangements and larger num-<br>
bers of diverting pulleys in the compensating device,<br>
thus providing different suspension ratios between the<br>
diverting pulleys of the compensating device. In the<br>
elevator without counterweight presented in Fig. 2,<br>
the elevator must be prevented from being driven up to<br>
the shaft's ceiling to obviate injury to installers<br>
who may be working on the car top and to prevent dam-<br>
age to the elevator. If a traditional buffer is used,<br>
it will be necessary to use heavy and expensive solu-<br>
tions and structures. The arrangement of the invention<br>
for preventing the elevator from being driven up to<br>
the ceiling as illustrated in Fig. 2 is advantageously<br><br>
placed as close to the machine 24 as possible, so that<br>
the delay caused by the elongation of the hoisting<br>
rope 2 03 is as small as possible and the stopping dis-<br>
tance as short as possible. This placement is also<br>
preferable because the coercivity to the hoisting rope<br>
is minimized. When the elevator car 21 comes up and<br>
reaches the area where it has to be stopped at the<br>
latest, the gripping element 22 9 acting on the ropes<br>
grips the hoisting rope 2 03 and stops the motion of<br>
the rope. The gripping element 22 9 is closed when it<br>
is hit by a guard 230, preferably a buffer, fitted on<br>
the elevator car, whereupon the gripping element 22 9<br>
will stop the motion of the rope. In this situation,<br>
the compensating device 224 no longer works. In addi-<br>
tion, as the traction sheave is further supplying rope<br>
into the hoisting rope portion on the side of the sec-<br>
ond rope tension T2, the gripping element gripping the<br>
rope has the effect that, due to the internal stiff-<br>
ness of the rope, the second rope tension T2 in the<br>
rope portion above the elevator car is reduced so much<br>
that the frictional force between the traction sheave<br>
and the hoisting ropes disappears and the traction<br>
sheave starts slipping, the motion of the elevator car<br>
being simultaneously stopped. The gripping element 22 9<br>
presented in Fig. 2 is so arranged that when the car<br>
starts moving in the downward direction, the gripping<br>
element 22 9 will release the rope, and the compensat-<br>
ing device 224 and therefore the elevator again works<br>
in the normal way. As to the structure of the gripping<br>
element 22 9, it may be e.g. an arrangement comprising<br>
a first part which has been designed to meet the<br>
buffer 23 0 of the elevator car and which, upon meeting<br>
the buffer, is pressed against a second part of the<br>
gripping element, to which the first part is pivotally<br>
connected. As a consequence of this, the set of hoist-<br>
ing ropes is caught between the first part and second<br><br>
parts of the ,gripping element and its motion is<br>
stopped while the rope portion below the elevator car<br>
is immediately slackened. The gripping element is<br>
preferably fitted in place e.g. in the elevator shaft.<br>
Fig. 3 presents an elevator according to Fig. 2 with<br>
the difference that in the elevator in Fig. 3 the sus-<br>
pension ratio is 6:1. Fig. 3 presents a compensating<br>
device corresponding to that presented in connection<br>
with Fig. 2 and the passage of the hoisting ropes is<br>
implemented in the same way. The difference in Fig. 3<br>
with respect to Fig. 2 is in the equipment used to<br>
prevent and/or stop the motion of the elevator car and<br>
in the part the effect of said equipment is applied<br>
to. In the elevator without counterweight presented in<br>
Fig. 3, the elevator is prevented from being driven up<br>
to the ceiling by means of a gripping element 3 33<br>
whose action is applied to a hoisting rope portion<br>
near the compensating device 324, preferably to a di-<br>
verting pulley 314 placed in the upper part of the of<br>
the elevator shaft, the hoisting ropes being passed<br>
around said diverting pulley and then going further to<br>
the diverting pulley 325 of the compensating device.<br>
When the elevator car 1 comes up and reaches the area<br>
where the motion of the elevator car has to be stopped<br>
at the latest, the gripping element 333 stops the mo-<br>
tion of the rope. The gripping element stops the rope<br>
whose second end is connected to the diverting pulley<br>
325 of the compensating device 324. After the gripping<br>
action of the gripping element 333, the compensating<br>
device 324 no longer works, and consequently the first<br>
rope tension Ti acting over the traction sheave in-<br>
creases and the second rope tension T2 decreases, as a<br>
result of which the hoisting rope portion below the<br>
elevator car is immediately slackened and therefore<br>
the frictional force needed in the machine 3 04 between<br>
the machine 304 and the traction sheave 305 disappears<br><br>
and the traction sheave 305 starts slipping. The grip-<br>
ping element 333 preferably works automatically, so<br>
that when the elevator car 301 is set in motion in the<br>
downward direction the gripping element 333 releases<br>
the rope and the compensating device of the elevator<br>
again works normally. In Fig. 3 the gripping element<br>
333 is preferably fitted on the ceiling of the eleva-<br>
tor shaft and comprises a first part 334 designed to<br>
meet a stopper 33 0, preferably a buffer mounted on the<br>
elevator car. The first part may comprise a device 32 7<br>
which limits the braking force of the impact of the<br>
elevator car and which can be utilized to influence<br>
the braking speed of the gripping element 333 and<br>
which may also be provided with a second braking<br>
spring 332 which can be utilized to influence the<br>
speed of braking action of the gripping element 333<br>
and its release when the elevator is set in motion in<br>
the downward direction after the action of the grip-<br>
ping element. In addition, the gripping element com-<br>
prises a second part 331, with respect to which the<br>
first part is movably mounted. The first part also<br>
comprises an intermediate beam, on which is mounted a<br>
diverting pulley 314. When the buffer 330 of the ele-<br>
vator meets the first part of the gripping element<br>
333, the movement of the first part can be used to<br>
move diverting pulley 314, which presses the hoisting<br>
rope against the second part 331 of the gripping ele-<br>
ment, the result of which is that the motion of the<br>
rope is stopped and the motion of the elevator is<br>
stopped as described above.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the elevator of the inven-<br>
tion is an elevator without machine room and with ma-<br>
chine above, in which the drive machine has a coated<br>
traction sheave and which elevator has thin and strong<br>
hoisting ropes of substantially round cross-section.<br>
The contact angle of the hoisting ropes on the trac-<br><br>
tion sheave of the elevator is greater than 18 0° and<br>
is implemented using DW roping in a drive machine hav-<br>
ing a traction sheave and a diverting pulley, in which<br>
drive machine the traction sheave and the diverting<br>
pulley are ready fitted at a correct angle relative to<br>
each other. The drive machine is fitted in place on<br>
the elevator guide rails. The elevator is implemented<br>
without counterweight with a suspension ratio of 8:1<br>
so that both the roping suspension ratio above the<br>
elevator car and the roping suspension ratio below the<br>
elevator car is 8:1, and that the ropes run in the<br>
space between one of the walls of the elevator car and<br>
a wall of the elevator shaft. The elevator has a com-<br>
pensating device that keeps the ratio of the rope ten-<br>
sions T1/T2 equal to about the ratio of 2:1. The com-<br>
pensating device of the elevator comprises at least<br>
one slack rope prevention device for preventing uncon-<br>
trolled slackening of the hoisting ropes and/or uncon-<br>
trolled motion of the compensating device, said slack<br>
rope prevention device being preferably a buffer. The<br>
motion of the elevator is stopped and/or prevented by<br>
increasing the ratio of the first rope tension (T1) to<br>
the second rope tension (T2) , as a consequence of<br>
which the friction between the traction sheave and the<br>
hoisting ropes is removed.<br>
It is obvious to the person skilled in the art that<br>
different embodiments of the invention are not limited<br>
to the examples described above, but that they may be<br>
varied within the scope of the claims presented below.<br>
For example, the number of times the hoisting ropes<br>
are passed between the diverting pulleys in the upper<br>
part of the elevator shaft and those on the elevator<br>
car and between the diverting pulleys in the lower<br>
part of the elevator shaft and those on the elevator<br>
car may vary so that a desired suspension ratio is<br>
achieved both above and below the elevator car. Appli-<br><br>
cations are generally so implemented that the ropes go<br>
to the elevator car from above as many times as from<br>
below, so that the suspension above the elevator car<br>
and the suspension below the elevator car have the<br>
same suspension ratios. In accordance with the exam-<br>
ples described above, a skilled person can vary the<br>
embodiment of the invention as the traction sheaves<br>
and diverting pulleys, instead of being coated metal<br>
pulleys, may also be uncoated metal pulleys or un-<br>
coated pulleys made of some other material suited to<br>
the purpose.<br>
It is further obvious to the person skilled in the art<br>
that the metallic traction sheaves and rope wheels<br>
used as diverting pulleys in the invention, which are<br>
coated with a non-metallic material at least in the<br>
area of their grooves, may be implemented using a<br>
coating material consisting of e.g. rubber, polyure-<br>
thane or some other material suited to the purpose.<br>
It is obvious to the skilled person that the elevator<br>
of the invention can be implemented using as hoisting<br>
ropes almost any flexible hoisting means, e.g. a<br>
flexible rope of one or more strands, a flat belt, a<br>
cogged belt, a trapezoidal belt or some other type of<br>
belt suited to the purpose. It is also obvious to the<br>
person skilled in the art that, instead of using ropes<br>
with a filler, the invention can be implemented using<br>
ropes without a filler, which are either lubricated or<br>
unlubricated. In addition, it is also obvious to the<br>
skilled person that the ropes may be twisted in many<br>
different ways.<br>
It is also obvious to the person skilled in the art<br>
that the elevator of the invention can be implemented<br>
using other types of roping between the traction<br>
sheave and the diverting pulley/diverting pulleys to<br><br>
increase the contact angle a than the roping arrange-<br>
ments described above as examples. For example, it is<br>
possible to arrange the diverting pulley/diverting<br>
pulleys, traction sheave and hoisting ropes in other<br>
ways than in the roping examples presented. It is fur-<br>
ther obvious to the skilled person that the elevator<br>
of the invention may also be provided with a counter-<br>
weight, in which elevator, for example, the counter-<br>
weight preferably has a weight below that of the car<br>
and is suspended on separate ropes, the elevator car<br>
is supported partly by the hoisting ropes and partly<br>
by the counterweight and its roping.<br><br>

ABSTRACT<br><br><br>
"ELEVATOR"<br>
According to the invention there is provided an elevator, preferably an elevator<br>
without machine room, wherein the elevator car (1) is supported by a set of hoisting ropes<br>
(203) comprising one rope or a number of parallel ropes, and which elevator has a<br>
traction sheave (205) that moves the elevator car by means of the hoisting ropes, and<br>
which elevator has rope portions of hoisting ropes going upwards and downwards from<br>
the elevator car, and the rope portions going from the traction sheave in the direction of<br>
the rope portion above the elevator car are under a first rope tension (T1) and the rope<br>
portions going from the traction sheave in the direction of the rope portion below the<br>
elevator car are under a second rope tension (T2), and which elevator has a compensating<br>
device (224) for equalizing and/or compensating the rope tension and/or rope elongation<br>
and/or to render the ratio of the first and the second rope tensions (T1/T2) substantially<br>
constant, characterized in that the motion of the elevator is prevented and/or stopped by<br>
increasing the ratio of the first rope tension (T1) to the second rope tension (T2).<br>
There is also provided a method for preventing/stopping the motion of the<br>
elevator.</td>
