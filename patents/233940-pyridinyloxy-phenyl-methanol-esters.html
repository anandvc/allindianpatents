Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel pyridinyloxy phenyl methanol esters, viz., 4-/3-(3,5,6-trichIoropyridyl-2-oxy) phenyl methanol derivatives and 4-/3-(2,3,5,6-pyridinyl-4-oxy)phenylmethanol derivatives useful as crop protection chemicals. The present invention also relates to a process for the preparation of new pyridinyloxy phenyl methanol esters specifically 4-/3-(3,5,6-trichloropyridyl-2-oxy) phenyl methanol and/or 4-/3-(2,3,5,6-pyridinyl-4-oxy)phenylmethanol derivatives as potential crop protection chemicals. Background of the invention<br>
During the past decade or so the synthetic pyrethroids, (3-phenoxy methyl esters or (RS)-a-cyano-3-phenoxy benzyl esters) by the virtue of their high degree of insecticidal activity, rapid knock down properties and low mammalian toxicity, generated great excitement and have become the subject of much synthetic effort.<br>
In recent past some of the pyrethroids having heterocycles as alcohol moiety have shown high degree of insecticidal activity with great degree of persistence in the field conditions. Earliest recorded nitrogen containing pyrethroid being tetrmethrin (T. Kato, K. Ueda and K. Fuji'moto, Agri. Biol. Chem. 28 (1964) 914) wherein the alcohol compound is N- (3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-phthalimido) methyl alcohol. Masachika Hirano (M. Hirano, N. Itaya, T. Ohno, Y. Fujitha and Y.Hosioka, Pestic. Sci., 10 (1979) 291) reported pyrethroid type esters of substituted l-(3)-hydroxymethyl imidazolidin-2, 4-diones, which have knock down activity against insects.<br>
Oshumi (T. Ohsumi, M. Hirano, N. Itaya, Y. Fujitha, Pestic. Sci., 12 (1981) 53) utilised pyrrole derivatives as alcohol moiety for synthesizing the novel pyrethroids. Of them 3-benzyl pyrrol-l-ylmethyl-cis, trans-3- (2,2-dichlorovinyl)-2, 2-dimethyl cyclopropane carboxylate, was found to be more active than permethrin against musca domestica.<br>
Thomas P. Selby (ACS symposium series 355, synthesis and chemistry of agrochemicals: Page 162-172, ACS Washington.DC. 1987) reported the synthesis of heterocyclic pyrethroids by condensing methyl phenyl substituted pyrazoles with DV acid chloride and they were found to be more active than permethrin against musca domestica. S. K. Malhotra (S. K. Malhotra, J. C. VanHeertum, L.L. Larson &amp; M. J. Ricks, J. Agric. Food Chem., 29 (1981) 1289) of Dow Chemical Company (USA) has come out with a new and extremely important generation of pyrethroid insecticides with low mammalian toxicity and other advantages over conventional insecticide by incorporating pyridoxy ring on to cyano-6-<br><br>
Phenoxy picolinaldehydecyanohydrin, 3-phenyI-2-methyl benzyl alcohol, methyl phenyl substituted pyrazole methanol, are some of the new alcoholic moieties used to generate the novel pyrethroid esters and prepared so, were shown to possess high degree of insecticidal activity. Encouraged by these developments, a new pyrethroid alcohol, close congener and isomeric to the phenoxypyridinyl benzene methanol (Dowco-417) was prepared and utilised for the preparation of novel pyrethroid esters. The new pyrethroid alcohols are 4-/3-(3,5,6-trichloropyridyl-2-oxy) phenylmethanol, 4-/3-(2,3,5,6-pyridinyI-4-oxy) phenylmethanol. As a major goal of our research for the discovery and development of potent and biologically active agents, the new pyridinyloxy phenyl methanol derivatives (pyrethroid esters) could possibly provide a new alternative source for protection of plants, animals and human beings. Objects of the invention<br>
The main object of the invention is to provide novel pyridinyloxy phenyl methanol esters, viz., 4-/3-(3,5,6-trichloropyridyl-2-oxy) phenyl methanol and 4-/3-(2,3,5,6-pyridinyl-4-oxy)phenylmethanol esters useful as crop protection chemicals.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a process for the preparation of new pyridinyloxy phenyl methanol esters specifically 4-/3-(3,5,6-trichloropyridyl-2-oxy) phenyl methanol and/or 4-/3-(2,3,5,6-pyridinyl-4-oxy)phenyImethanol esters which are useful as crop protection chemicals. Summary of the invention<br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
In view of the growing importance for new molecules which could potentially provide<br>
new alternate protective agents, a synthetic strategy has been designed wherein a new<br>
molecule are synthesized and are evaluated for their bio-efficacy. The present invention<br>
envisaged as a process for synthesis of a new molecule(s) involving 4-/3-(3,5,6-<br>
trichloropyridyl-2-oxy) phenylmethanol and 4-/3-(2,3,5,6-pyridinyl-4-oxy)phenylmethanols,<br>
which in turn is reacted with acid chloride derived from a well established and commercially<br>
proven pyrethroid ester in a single step.<br>
The final product, the hitherto unknown/ unreported novel pyrethroid esters is in the<br>
pure form, the critical criteria for considering it in biological screening program.<br>
The pyridinyloxy phenyl methanol derivatives have been prepared according to the<br>
literature methods either by condensing hydroxy benzaldehyde followed by reduction or<br>
hydroxy phenyl methanol directly with halopyridines. (Gui-Dong Zhu, Verlyn Schaefer,<br>
Steven A. Boyd and Gregory F. Okasinki. J.Org.chem.67 (2002) 943). Synthesis of acid<br>
chloride was carried out according to the procedure of Farkas etal (Farkas, J.; Kourim. P.;<br>
Sorm. F. Chem. Listy 52(1958), 699.The relative and absolute sterochemistry about the<br>
cyclopropane ring influences both the level and spectrum of activity exhibited by these<br>
compounds. It is very well known that cis diasteromers are more active than the trans and the<br>
component of the racemate of R configuration at the carboxyl stereo centre is the more active.<br>
Accordingly DV acid chloride used was a single resolved isomer (IR-Cis -Acid) and as a<br>
consequence the corresponding esters are single isomers only and hi case of esterification<br>
with fluorinated acid, only one isomer was obtained and no trace of other diastereomer.<br>
The reaction mechanism of the process of the invention is given below:<br>
The preliminary activities of the compounds synthesized have shown very good<br>
activity against Musca domestica (Insecticidal) and also anti bacterial activity. The various<br>
aspects of the present invention are illustrated in more detail in the following examples.<br>
These examples should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention in any manner.<br>

200 mesh silica gel) chromatography (hexane as eluent) to obtain 50 % yield of the ester.<br>
1H NMR (200 MHz, CDC13): 8 1.3 (s, 6H); 1.9 (d, 1H); 2.1 (t, 1H); 5.0 (s, 2H); 6.2 (d, IHJf<br>
6.6-6.8 (d, 1H); 6.9 (s, 1H); 7.0-7.2 (d, 1H); 7.4 (m, 1H); IR (KBr, cnfl): 3020, 1710^1400^<br>
Mass (m/z) 619.<br>
Example 25: Preparation of the aryl pyridyl ethers via alternate route:<br>
A) To a solution of 4-hydroxy benzaldehyde (0.213 g, 0.0023 M) and 2,3,5,6-<br>
tetrachloropyridine (0.493 g , 0.0023 M) in DMF (8 ml) was added cesium carbonate-<br>
(0.740 g, 0.0023 M) at room temperature. The reaction mixture was stirred at 70 Â°C for<br>
4-6 h. The solvent was removed from reaction mixture under vacum and crude mixture<br>
was taken into chloroform and washed with water, dried over sodium sulfate and<br>
concentrated. The pure product was obtained by column chromatography in 80% yield.<br>
B) To a solution of 4-hydroxy benzyl alcohol (0.218 mg, 0.0023 mmol) and 2,3,5,6-<br>
tetrachloropyridine (0.493 mg, 0.0023mmol) in DMF (8 ml) was added cesium carbonate<br>
(0.740 mg, 0.0023 mmol) at room temperature. The reaction mixture was heated at 70 Â° Cfor 6-8 h. At the end of the reaction the solvent was distilled off and the residue wastakenup into chloroform and washed with water, dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated.<br>
The pure product was obtained by column chromatography in almost 85 % yield.<br><br><br><br><br>
