				<td>The present invention relates to a process and apparatus for<br>
condensing a drafted fibre strand in a condensing zone arranged<br>
downstream of a front roller pair of a drafting apparatus, in<br>
which process the fibre strand is transported through the condensing<br>
zone by means of a perforated, suctioned transport means.<br>
The present invention relates further to an apparatus for<br>
condensing a drafted fibre strand in a condensing zone arranged<br>
downstream of a front roller pair of a drafting unit, said<br>
apparatus comprising a stationary sliding surfaced, which has a<br>
suction slit extending essentially in the direction of the motion<br>
of the fibre strand, also comprising a perforated transport belt<br>
located between the fibre strand and the sliding surface, which<br>
transport belt transport the fibre strand over the sliding<br>
surface, the speed of said transport belt corresponding to at<br>
least the peripheral speed of the front roller pair, and also<br>
comprising a nipping roller bordering the condensing zone on its<br>
exit side.<br>
Such condensing apparatuses are used in addition to drafting<br>
apparatuses of textile machinery, especially ring spinning<br>
machines, for improving the quality of the spun yarn.<br>
A process and an apparatus of this type is prior art in<br>
Indian Patent 185214. The condensing zone is bordered on its<br>
entry side as well as on its exit side by a nipping point, namely<br>
on the entry side by the nipping point of the front roller pair<br><br><br>
and on its exit side by a nipping point defined by the nipping<br>
roller, whereby the nipping roller presses against a driven<br>
bottom roller. The distance between the two nipping points is<br>
given in the known publication as l.S times that of the fibre<br>
length. A light tension draft is provided in the condensing zone,<br>
that is the nipping roller has a somewhat higher circumferential<br>
speed than the front roller pair. On reaching the condensing<br>
zone, the direction of motion of the fibre strand differs from<br>
the direction of motion of the transport belt.<br>
A similar apparatus is prior art in German published patent<br>
application 197 22 528. According to this publication, the<br>
suction zone of the condensing zone is limited to between 10 and<br>
25 mm, in order that, in the case of reduced suction performance,<br>
an improved condensing effect is attained. However, the distance<br>
between the nipping points is significantly larger than the<br>
suction zone and also larger than the fibre length. In the case<br>
of the latter publication, the matter of the airways of the<br>
transport belt becoming clogged with time is addressed. As a<br>
remedy, the suggestion is made to design the perforations of the<br>
transport belt as edgeâ€”free.<br><br>
In the case of the known apparatus there is the risk that despite everything, fibre fly and trash can<br>
collect between the stationary sliding surface and the moving supporting surface of the transport<br>
belt. This trash build-up comes about, for example, in that individual fibres of the fibre strand to<br>
be condensed, in particular the shorter fibres, can insert themselves inwards with their front ends<br>
in the area of the suction slit in through the perforations of the transport belt. These fibres project<br>
then partly into the suction slit, namely until the suction slit has been passed. In the most<br>
favourable case, the relevant fibre can be cut off at the end of the suction slit and the cut-off end<br>
is suctioned off. In the least favourable case, the fibre end is simply turned over, so that it is not<br>
suctioned off, but rather is transported further with the transport belt, thus lying partly between the<br>
supporting surface and the sliding surface. This fibre can tear at any time, and can settle, in the<br>
form of dust, anywhere on the supporting surface or on the sliding surface, in particular in the<br>
case of sticky fibres containing honeydew. This results in time in varying condensing effects from<br>
spinning station to spinning station, so that at the exit side nipping points, varyingly condensed<br>
fibre strands are delivered.<br>
The condensing of a drafted fibre strand, namely in an area to which the spinning twist is not yet<br>
retroactive, serves the purpose of bundling the fibre strand in its cross section and to make it less<br>
hairy overall. This results, after the spinning twist has been imparted, in a smoother yarn with a<br>
higher tear resistance. When, however, the desired condensing effect does not occur at even one<br>
spinning station due to an impaired condensing zone, a so-called Moire effect occurs in the later<br>
fabric, which can render it a reject product. It must be ensured, therefore, that the condensing<br>
effect at the individual condensing zones of the spinning stations is constantly maintained.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to ensure that the perforations of the transport belt do not<br>
become clogged, and that in the area between the supporting surface of the transport belt and<br>
the stationary sliding surface no small deposits can form.<br>
This object has been achieved in the process in accordance with the present invention in that the<br>
fibre strand has the same direction of motion as the transporting means when it reaches the<br>
condensing zone, and in that a sufficient amount of fibres located in the fibre strand continues to<br>
be nipped by the front roller pair during condensing.<br>
The transport means has thus in the case of long fibres in the condensing zone - in the same<br>
direction - the same or a greater speed than the front ends of the fibres, which thus cannot insert<br>
themselves in the first place into the perforations of the transporting means. In the case of short<br><br>
fibres, however, it is sufficient when as high a percentage as possible of fibres are still controlled<br>
by the front roller pair as soon as the front ends are seized by the suction.<br>
This object has been achieved in relation to the apparatus in accordance with the present<br>
invention in that the distance between the nipping points defined by the front roller pair on the<br>
one side and by the nipping roller on the other side is, in any case, not very much greater than<br>
the average staple length of the fibres located in the fibre strand.<br>
This reliably prevents the fibres in the condensing zone from being seized by the suction force at<br>
their fronts ends and crawling forwards on the transport belt. The suction of the front end of the<br>
fibres into the perforations is thus effectively prevented.<br>
In the case of short stapled material to be spun, the distance between the nipping points<br>
measures advantageously between 20 and 27 mm. The smaller value is selected for synthetic<br>
fibre material, in particular for viscose fibres.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the suction slit arranged directed against the transport<br>
belt has a shaft-like opening. Experience has shown that in the case of such openings of suction<br>
tubes in general, almost no fibres collect there. The shaft-like opening may taper in suction<br>
direction, which results in an acceleration of the suctioned fibres. In contrast, in the case of a<br>
suction slit in a metal sheet, in which the height of the suction slit corresponds to the thickness of<br>
the metal sheet, the risk of clogging, caused by increased turbulences, would arise.<br>
The shaft-like opening is formed for the purpose by an exchangeable fitted window. The suction<br>
slit can then be adapted easily to various fibre materials.<br>
In a further embodiment of the present invention, the front roller pair can have a bottom roller<br>
which is provided on its periphery with a profiling, which is disposed with a light pressure on the<br>
transport belt outside of the condensing zone.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
These and further objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more<br>
readily apparent from the following detailed description thereof when taken in conjunction with the<br>
accompanying drawings wherein:<br>
Figure 1 is a part intersectional side view of an arrangement according to the present invention,<br><br>
Figure 2 is a view in the direction of the arrow II of Figure 1 onto the condensing zone,<br>
Figure 3 is a view similar to Figure 1 in another embodiment of the present invention,<br>
Figure 4 is a view in the direction of the arrow IV of Figure 3 onto the condensing zone.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Of the drafting apparatus 1 of a spinning station of a ring spinning machine, only the front roller<br>
pair 2 and the apron roller pair 3 arranged upstream thereof are shown in Figures 1 and 2. The<br>
front roller pair 2 comprises a driven bottom roller 4, which extends over a plurality of spinning<br>
stations, and also comprises a pressure roller 5 arranged to each spinning station. In a similar<br>
way, the apron roller pair 3 comprises a driven bottom roller 6, and also a pressure roller 7 per<br>
spinning station. In addition, a bottom apron 8 and an upper apron 9 can be seen.<br>
In the drafting apparatus 1, a sliver or a roving 10 is transported in transport direction A in a<br>
known way and is drafted to the desired degree of fineness. Directly downstream of the nipping<br>
point 11 of the front roller pair 2, a drafted, but still twist-free fibre strand 12 is present.<br>
A condensing zone 13 is arranged downstream of the drafting apparatus 1, said condensing zone<br>
13 comprising a device for condensing the fibre strand 12. This device comprises a hollow<br>
section 14, which extends over a plurality of spinning stations. The outer contour of the hollow<br>
section 14 comprises a stationary sliding surface 15, to which a transporting means in the form of<br>
a transporting belt is arranged to each spinning station.<br>
The transport belt 16 belonging to the condensing zone 13 is designed in an air-permeable way,<br>
and consists preferably of a fine-pored woven fabric of polyamide threads. The transport belt 16<br>
transports the fibre strand 12 to be condensed through the condensing zone 13 and over a<br>
suction slit 17 of the sliding surface 15. The suction slit 17 is somewhat wider than the condensed<br>
fibre strand 12 and is arranged at a slight slant in direction of motion B of the fibre strand 12, so<br>
that the fibre strand 12 is imparted a light false twist during condensing. The suction slit 17<br>
extends to a nipping point 18, which is formed between a nipping roller 19 and the sliding surface<br>
15 of the hollow section 14, and which borders the condensing zone 13 on its exit side. The<br><br>
Downstream of the nipping point 18, a thread 20 is present to which the spinning twist is<br>
imparted. The nipping roller 19 serves as a twist block for the spinning twist, so that the fibre<br>
strand 12 is twist-free in the condensing zone 13. Downstream of the nipping point 18, the thread<br>
20 is fed in delivery direction C to a ring spindle (not shown).<br>
The hollow section 14 comprises per machine section an opening 21, which is connected with a<br>
vacuum source (not shown) by means of a suction tube 22. Thus a suction effect acts through the<br>
perforated transport belt 16 onto the fibre strand 12 to be condensed.<br>
The nipping roller 19 is connected to a drive, which is derived by means of a transfer roller 23<br>
from the pressure roller 5 of the front roller pair 2. The peripheral speed of the nipping roller 19 is<br>
slightly greater than the peripheral speed of the front roller pair 2.<br>
The transport belt 16 is provided on its side facing away from the fibre strand 12 with a bearing<br>
surface, which slides on the stationary sliding surface 15. There is a risk here that fibre fly and<br>
trash will settle between the bearing surface and the sliding surface 15. The front ends of<br>
individual fibres, in particular the shorter fibres, can namely project through the perforations of the<br>
transport belt 16 into the suction slit 17. When such fibres turn over at the end of the suction slit<br>
17, that is when they are leaving the condensing zone 13, they then reach the area between the<br>
bearing surface of the transport belt 16 and the stationary sliding surface 15. This leads after a<br>
time to an impairment of the condensing effect of the respective condensing zone 13.<br>
In order to avoid this disadvantage it is provided that when the fibre strand 12 reaches the<br>
condensing zone 13, it takes the same direction of motion B as the transport belt 16. Thus the<br>
front ends of the fibres cannot reach the area of the perforations in the first place. In addition it is<br>
provided that most of the fibres located in the fibre strand 12 continue to be nipped by the front<br>
roller pair 2 during condensing. The front roller pair 2 thus controls the speed of the fibre strand<br>
12 when it reaches the condensing zone 13 and holds the fibre strand 12 back somewhat, while<br>
the transport belt 16 runs at a slightly higer speed. These measures also prevent the front ends of<br>
the fibres from inserting themselves into the perforations of the transport belt 16.<br>
The distance a between the two nipping points 11 and 18 is so selected that it is at most<br>
insignificantly larger, but preferably smaller, than the average staple length of the fibres located in<br>
the fibre strand 12. Thus the fibres leaving the nipping point 11 are prevented from crawling<br>
forward on the transport belt 16 under the effect of the suction action and thus from entering the<br>
perforations.<br><br>
The suction slit 17 aligned against the transport belt 16 comprises a shaft-like opening 24, which<br>
tapers slightly in suction direction. Experience has shown that such openings 24 in general are<br>
not clogged by fibre fly. It is provided that in the area of the suction slit 17 a window is fitted on<br>
the hollow section 14, so that the condensing zone 13 can, if required, be adapted to the fibre<br>
material to be spun.<br>
The bottom roller 4 is provided on its periphery with a profiling 26, which is disposed with light<br>
pressure on the transport belt 16. Thus the bottom roller 4 serves to a certain extent as a<br>
cleaning roller, which continuously cleans the transport belt 16 of any adhering fibre fly outside of<br>
the area of the condensing zone 13.<br>
In Figures 3 and 4, a further embodiment of the invention is shown in somewhat enlarged<br>
dimensions. Insofar as the same components as above are involved, the same reference<br>
numbers are used, so that a repeat description is omitted.<br>
In the embodiment shown in Figures 3 and 4, a somewhat differently designed hollow section 27<br>
is provided, which again extends over a plurality of spinning stations and which is connected by<br>
means of a suction opening with a vacuum source in a way not shown. The hollow section 27<br>
faces the condensing zone 13 with a sliding surface 28, on which the perforated transport belt 16<br>
again slides and which transports the fibre strand 12 through the condensing zone 13.<br>
A suction slit 29 per spinning station is located in the sliding surface 28, which suction slit 29 in<br>
the present case extends exactly in the direction of motion B of the fibre strand 12, that is, it does<br>
not extend diagonally. This has been proved favourable in the case of some fibre materials, for<br>
example, long staple fibre material.<br>
The opening 30 of the suction slit 29 is here also in the form of a chimney-like shaft, so that there<br>
is no tendency for fibre fly or the like to settle at this point. The chimney-like shaft graduates into<br>
a greatly enlarged cross section of the hollow section 27.<br>
In this embodiment of the present invention, an exchangeable window 31 is also fitted onto the<br>
hollow section 27, which window surrounds the suction slit 29 on all sides. On the side of the<br>
transport belt 16 facing away from the window 31, the condensing zone 13 is shielded by a non-<br>
contact cover 33 between the pressure roller 5 and the nipping roller 19, so that a blower which<br>
travels along the ring spinning machine does not disturb the fibre strand 12 to be condensed.<br><br>
On the side facing away from the condensing zone 13, the contour of the hollow section 27 is<br>
provided at the point where the transport belt 16 slides with longitudinal grooves 32 or with<br>
another type of diagonal knurling or fluting. In addition to the profiling 26 of the bottom roller 4<br>
already described, which engages from below at the transport belt 16, the transport belt 16 cal<br>
be freed of anv adherina fibre fly from the inside.<br><br>
