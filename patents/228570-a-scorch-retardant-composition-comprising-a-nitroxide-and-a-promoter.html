COMPOSITION COMPRISING A NITROXIDE, A PROMOTER AND OPTIONALLY A FREE-RADICAL INITIATOR<br>
The present invention relates to the prevention of scorching before crosslinking of a thermoplastic and/or elastomeric composition with peroxides or azo compounds.<br>
Premature crosslinking (scorching) during the preparatory phase is a major difficulty in the use of peroxides and azo compounds in crosslinking (curing) applications of elastomeric and/or thermoplastic materials. The preparatory phase consists in general in blending the constituents and optionally extruding them at temperatures that are often high. The operating conditions of this preparatory phase quite often lead to decomposition of the peroxide or azo initiator, thus inducing the crosslinking reaction with formation of gel particles in the bulk of the blend. The presence of these gel particles leads to imperfections (inhomogeneity or surface roughness) of the final product. Excessive scorching reduces the plastic properties of the material, such that the said material can no longer be converted, leading to loss of the entire batch. In addition, excessive scorching may lead to the total stoppage of the extrusion operation.<br>
Several solutions have been proposed to overcome this drawback. Thus, it has been proposed to use an initiator with a half-life of 10 hours at high<br><br>
temperature. The drawbacks of this approach are the low production efficiency due to a long curing time and the high energy costs.<br>
It has also been proposed to incorporate certain additives in order to reduce the scorch tendency. Thus, the use of organic hydroperoxides as scorch inhibitors for polyethylene-based compositions crosslinked with a peroxide was described in British patent GB 1 535 039. The use of vinyl monomers was the subject of patent US 3 954 907. The use of nitrites was described in patent US 3 202 648. Patent US 3 335 124 describes the use of aromatic amines, phenolic compounds, mercaptothiazole compounds, sulphides, hydroquinones and dialkyl dithiocarbamate compounds.<br>
Very recently, the use of 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidyloxy (TEMPO) and 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidyloxy (4-hydroxy TEMPO) was the subject of a Japanese patent application JP 11-49865.<br>
However, the use of the additives of the prior art cited above to increase the scorch-resistance time has a harmful effect on the curing time and/or on the final crosslinking density. It leads, therefore, to a reduction in the production efficiency and/or properties of the final product.<br>
The present invention eliminates the drawbacks of the prior art since it makes it possible to improve the scorch resistance or the crosslinking<br><br>
density without this having a negative impact on the crosslinking time. This is achieved by using a nitroxide in combination with at least one crosslinking promoter (promoter) chosen from group (P) consisting of compounds containing at least one double bond, which may be difunctional or polyfunctional. Mention may be made, by way of example, of difunctional vinyl monomers, difunctional allylic monomers, polyfunctional vinyl monomers and polyfunctional allylic monomers.<br>
The aim of the present invention is to provide a scorch-retardant composition comprising a nitroxide and at least one promoter chosen from the group (P). The nitroxide is preferably used in weight proportions ranging from 1:0.2 to 1:5 and advantageously between 1:0.5 and 1:2 relative to the amount of promoter present.<br>
One aim of the present invention is also to provide a scorch-retardant curing/crosslinking composition (A), comprising a free-radical initiator chosen from the group consisting of organic peroxides, azo compounds and mixtures thereof, a nitroxide and at least one promoter chosen from the group (P). The free-radical initiator is preferably used in weight proportions of from 1:0.02 to 1:1 and advantageously from 1:0.1 to 1:0.5 relative to the amount of nitroxide present.<br>
The free-radical initiator is preferably used<br><br>
in weight proportions of from 1:0.02 to 1:1 and advantageously from 1:0.1 to 1:0.5 relative to the amount of promoter used.<br>
The present invention also provides a crosslinkable composition (B) comprising a thermoplastic polymer and/or an elastomeric polymer which may be crosslinked by means of a peroxide or an azo compound, a free-radical initiator chosen from the group consisting of organic peroxides and azo compounds and mixtures thereof, a nitroxide and at least one promoter chosen from group (P). The free-radical initiator preferably represents between 0.2 and 5 parts and advantageously between 0.5 and 3 parts per 100 parts by weight of polymer. The proportions of nitroxide and of promoter used relative to the free-radical initiator are preferably in the region of those used for composition (A).<br>
The present invention also provides a process for crosslinking a crosslinkable composition comprising a thermoplastic polymer and/or an elastomeric polymer which may be crosslinked using a peroxide or an azo compound, in which the said polymer is mixed with a free-radical initiator chosen from the group consisting of organic peroxides, azo compounds and mixtures thereof, in the presence of a nitroxide combined with at least one promoter chosen from the group (P).<br>
The present invention also provides moulded<br><br>
or extruded articles such as wires and electrical cables obtained from a crosslinkable composition (B).<br>
Advantageously, the promoters chosen from the group (P) are trans-stilbene, divinylbenzene, trans,trans-2,6-dimethyl-2,4,6-octatriene, dicyclopentadiene, 3,7-dimethyl-1,3,6-octatriene (OCIMENE), the compounds represented by the general formula (I):<br><br>

The thermoplastic and/or elastomeric polymers taken into consideration in the present invention may be defined as natural or synthetic polymers which have a thermoplastic and/or elastomeric nature and which may be crosslinked (cured) under the action of a crosslinking agent. In Rubber World,    "Elastomer Crosslinking with Diperoxyketals", October 1983, pages 26-32, and in Rubber and Plastic News,    "Organic Peroxides  for Rubber Crosslinking",   29 September 1980, pages 46-50, the crosslinking action and crosslinkable polymers are described. Polyolefins which are suitable for the present invention are described in Modern Plastics Encyclopaedia  89,   pages 63-67 and 74-75. By way of example of polymers and/or elastomers, mention may be made of linear low density polyethylene, low density polyethylene, high density polyethylene, chlorinated polyethylene, ethylene/propylene/diene terpolymers (EPDM), ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymers, ethylene/propylene copolymers, silicone rubber, natural rubber (NR), polyisoprene (IR), polybutadiene (BR),<br><br>
acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymers (NBR), styrene-butadiene copolymers (SBR), chlorosulphonated polyethylene and fluoroelastomers.<br>
Mention may also be made of ethylene/methyl (meth)acrylate copolymers and ethylene/glycidyl methacrylate copolymers.<br>
In addition to the constituents mentioned above, the compositions (A) and (B) may comprise antioxidants, stabilizers, plasticizers and inert fillers such as silica, clay or calcium carbonate.<br>
The compositions (A) and (B) may comprise two or more nitroxides (N). They may also comprise two or more free-radical initiators.<br>
According to the process of the present invention, the crosslinking temperature may be between 110 and 22O°C and preferably between 140 and 2OO°C.<br>
Advantageously the process is implemented in the presence of an amount of initiator, nitroxide and promoter such that the initiator/polymer, nitroxide/polymer and promoter/polymer weight ratios are close to the composition (B).<br>
The conversion of the crosslinkable compositions into moulded or extruded articles may be carried out during or after crosslinking.<br>
EXPERIMENTAL SECTION<br>
In the text hereinbelow, the following abbreviations are used:<br><br>
MH  : the maximum value of the torque<br>
obtained from the curve recorded by the rheometer.<br>
This value determines the crosslinking density. T90 : crosslinking time, the time required to<br>
reach 90% of the maximum torque. Ts5 : scorch time, the time required at a given temperature for the torque to increase by 5 Mooney units. The crosslinking density (MH) and the crosslinking time (T90) of the blend obtained were measured at l8OºC using a Monsanto ODR 2000 E rheometer (Alpha Technologies, oscillation arc: 3°, oscillation frequency: 100 cycles/min).<br>
The crosslinking time is also determined using the rheometer used under the same conditions as above.<br>
The scorch time was measured at l45ºC using a Mooney MV 2000 viscometer (Alpha Technologies).<br>
Example 1 (not in accordance with the invention):<br>
1 000 g of low density polyethylene (Mitene sold by Ashland), 25 g of dicumyl peroxide (Luperox® DC) and 3 g of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidyloxy (TEMPO) were mixed together in a turbomixer at 8O°C (nominal temperature) for 15 minutes (stirring speed =930 rpm).<br><br>
The powder was then converted into a sample in the form of a disc by melting at HO°C for 3 min. The sample was then placed in the rheometer or viscometer chamber.<br>
Example 2 (not in accordance with the invention):<br>
Example 1 was repeated without the use of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidyloxy. The results are given in Table 1. Comparison of Examples 1 and 2 shows that the scorch time is higher in Example 1, but is accompanied by a large reduction in crosslinking density and by a slight increase in the crosslinking time.<br>
Example 3:<br>
Example 1 was repeated, adding 3 g of diisopropylbenzene (DIPB).<br>
Comparison of the results with those obtained in the above examples shows unambiguously that such a combination makes it possible to maintain an increase in the scorch time while at the same time giving a higher crosslinking density and a lower crosslinking time.<br><br>
