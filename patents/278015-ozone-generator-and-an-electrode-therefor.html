				<td>OZONE GENERATOR AND AN ELECTRODE THEREFOR<br>
The invention relates to an ozone generator of the type which comprises:<br>
-	at least one tubular external electrode,<br>
-	at  least  one  internal  electrode  comprising  a<br>
plurality of tubular metal segments which are closed,<br>
at least partially, at each end and externally coated<br>
with ceramic, these tubular segments being positioned<br>
one  behind  the  other,  mechanically  coupled  and<br>
electrically linked,<br>
-	means of holding the tubular segments relative to the<br>
external  electrode to form an annular discharging<br>
interstice,<br>
-	a rod passing axially through the tubular segments<br>
and provided  at  its  ends  with means  of  axially<br>
clamping  the  tubular  segments  to  each  other,  to<br>
establish electrical contact,<br>
-	means  for  connecting  all  the  electrodes  to  an<br>
alternating current source, and<br>
-	means for circulating a gas containing oxygen in the<br>
interstices.<br>
An ozone generator of this type is known, for example, from US patent No. 5 145 653. In such a generator, by applying an AC voltage across the electrodes that satisfies certain limiting conditions, corona discharges take place in the interstice between the surface of the dielectric formed by the ceramic coating and the external electrode. These discharges cause ozone to be produced. The use of ceramic as the dielectric coating makes it possible to obtain ozone production efficiencies that are higher than with a glass coating. In particular, the ozone content in the gas leaving the generator can exceed 12% by weight.<br>
However, the ceramic coating is relatively fragile andcracks can appear which prevent a good distribution of the surface electric charges, which can cause the acceptable voltage limit for the ceramic to be locally exceeded. This can result in a breakdown of the ceramic coating and cause the generator to be taken out of service.<br>
The mechanical stresses created by the axial clamping of the ceramic-coated tubular segments can also contribute to the appearance of cracks in the ceramic coating.<br>
The object of the invention is, primarily, to provide an ozone generator which no longer, or to a lesser extent, presents the drawbacks summarized above. In particular, it is desirable for the design of the generator to allow for a good resistance of the ceramic coating to the mechanical and electrical stresses so that the risk of cracks in the ceramic coating is significantly reduced, and the efficiency of the device is enhanced.<br>
According to the invention, an ozone generator of the type defined previously is characterized in that each tubular metal segment is provided, at each end, with an externally convex end plate, roughly in the form of a spherical cap, comprising a central area for electrical contact, and in that the ceramic coating comprises at least two layers deposited in succession. The assembly exhibits an enhanced resistance to the mechanical and electrical stresses.<br>
The risks of cracking of the ceramic coating are significantly reduced.<br>
Preferably, the assembly is designed for each internal electrode to withstand, without cracking of the ceramic coating, a torque at least twice the rated torque, exerted at the end of the axial rod.The thickness of each layer is preferably between 50 and 300 pm.<br>
Each layer of the ceramic coating is advantageously deposited by slurry coating, or powder coating, or plasma spraying.<br>
The external surface of the tubular segments can exhibit a roughness, in particular in the form of grooves, to enhance the keying of the ceramic coating. The depth of the grooves or irregularities is advantageously of the order of 0.1 mm. As a variant, the outer surface of the tubular segments can be roughened by sandblasting.<br>
The central area of each end plate of a tubular element comprises an orifice delimited by a cylindrical flange ring projecting externally in the axial direction, beyond the ceramic coating, relative to the end plate.<br>
Preferably, the external and internal electrodes and the tubular segments are made of stainless steel.<br>
The invention also relates to an internal electrode, for the ozone generator as defined previously, comprising a plurality of tubular metal segments which are closed, at least partially, at each end and externally coated with ceramic, these tubular segments being positioned one behind the other, mechanically decoupled and electrically linked, a rod passing axially through the tubular segments and being provided at its ends with means of axially clamping the tubular segments to each other, to establish the electrical contact, characterized in that each tubular metal segment is provided, at each end, with an externally convex end plate, roughly in the form of a spherical cap, comprising a central area for contact, and in that the ceramic coating comprises at least two layers<br>
deposited in succession.Apart from the abovementioned provisions, the invention involves a certain number of other provisions that will be more explicitly described below in relation to an embodiment described with reference to the appended drawings, but which is by no means limiting. In these drawings:<br>
Figure 1 is a diagrammatic lengthwise vertical cross section of an ozone generator according to the invention.<br>
Figure 2 is a vertical cross section seen from the left along the line II-II of figure 1.<br>
Figure 3 is a larger-scale partial lengthwise vertical cross section, similar to figure 1.<br>
Figure 4 is a larger-scale diagrammatic transverse cross section along the line IV-IV of figure 2.<br>
Figure 5 is a larger-scale partial lengthwise cross section of the wall of a tubular segment and of its coating.<br>
Figure 6 is a larger-scale partial transverse cross section of the wall of a tubular segment, before coating, with grooves on its external surface.<br>
Figure 7 is a perspective view of the end of a tubular segment of an internal electrode according to the invention, and<br>
Figure 8 is a side view of the end of a tubular segment on a scale different from figure 7.<br>
Referring to figure 1 in the drawings, an ozone generator is shown, arranged in a tank 1, of generally<br>
cylindrical form, closed at its ends. The tank 1 omprises, in the vicinity of each of its longitudinal ends, a wall 2, 3 orthogonal to the axis of the tank. Each wall has opposing holes in which are fitted tubes<br>
4	extending from one wall 2 to the other wall 3 . The<br>
length of the tubes 4 can be of the order of two meters<br>
or  more.  The  ends  of  the  tubes  4  are  welded<br>
respectively to the walls 2 and 3. The metal tubes 4<br>
constitute the external electrodes connected to the<br>
ground potential. It can be considered that the set of<br>
tubes 4 form a single external electrode. For reasons<br>
of clarity, the number of tubes 4 represented in figure<br>
1 is limited, but, in practice, the number of tubes can<br>
be greater than 100.<br>
The tubes 4 are fixed in a leaktight manner to the inside of the tank and to the walls 2, 3, which are also fixed in a leaktight manner, in particular by welding, to the cylindrical wall of the tank 1. A coolant, water for example, is used to externally cool the tubes 4. The coolant is introduced through an inlet<br>
5	and drained through an outlet 6.<br>
An internal electrode 7 is positioned inside each tube 4 . Each internal electrode 7 is made of a plurality of tubular metal segments 8, closed at least partially at each end and provided with an external ceramic coating 9. The tubular segments 8 are positioned one behind the other, in alignment; they are mechanically decoupled and electrically linked by their ends that are in contact with each other.<br>
Means 10 of holding the tubular segments 8 relative to the external electrode 4 are provided to form an annular discharging interstice I between the external surface of the ceramic coating 9 and the internal surface of the external electrode 4. The means 10 are formed, for example, by insulating projections fixed to he internal wall of the tubes 4.<br>
A metal rod II passes axially through the tubular segments 8 and exits at each end. The end sections of the rod 11 are threaded and provided with a clamping nut 12, 13 bearing against the end plate of the last adjacent segment 8. One end of each rod 11, the one located on the right according to figure 1, is electrically linked to a conductor 14, which is in turn linked to the high voltage terminal of an AC voltage source 15. An insulator 16 surrounds the conductor 14 at its point of entry through the wall of the vessel 1.<br>
Each tubular metal segment 8 is provided, at each end, with an externally convex end plate 8a, 8b, roughly in the form of a spherical cap, which is in particular roughly hemispherical. The radius of curvature of the end plate 8a, 8b can be different from the radius of the cylindrical part of the tubular segment 8.<br>
The central area of the end plate 8a, 8b has an orifice 17 for the rod 11 to pass through. This orifice 17 is delimited by a cylindrical flange ring 18 oriented externally relative to the end plate 8a, 8b.<br>
The ceramic coating 9, for a given thickness, is made up of at least two thin layers 9a, 9b (figure 4) . The sum of the thicknesses of the layers 9a, 9b corresponds to the desired thickness. The layers 9a, 9b are deposited in succession on the tubular segment 8. The number of layers 9a, 9b can be greater than two, in particular equal to three. The thickness of each layer 9a, 9b is preferably between 50 and 300 um.<br>
The ceramic coating 9 covers the cylindrical part and the convex end plates 8a, 8b of the tubular segment, but the axial end of the flange ring 18 projects from the coating 9. Thus, the flange rings 18 of two successive tubular segments 8 can bear against each other and establish the electrical contact when axially<br>
clamped using the rod 11 and the nuts 12, 13.<br>
Advantageously, the external surface of the tubular segments 8 has a roughness that is sufficient to enhance the keying of the ceramic coating 9.<br>
According to a first possibility, the tubular segment 8 comprises on its external surface, grooves 19 (figure 6), typically annular rotation-wise about the axis of the segment, the depth of which is of the order of 0.1 mm. As a variant, the roughness of the external surface of the segments 8 is obtained by sandblasting at adequate compressed air pressure.<br>
The tube 4 and the tubular segments 8 are preferably made of stainless steel, as are the walls 2 and 3 and the tank 1.<br>
Means for circulating a gas containing oxygen, in particular air, inside the generator comprise an inlet nozzle 21 on the tank opening into the space between the wall 3 and the adjacent end plate of the tank. The gas can circulate in the interstices I to arrive in a chamber delimited by the wall 2 and the other end plate of the tank. The ozone-enriched gas is discharged through an outlet nozzle 20.<br>
The ceramic used for the coating 9 is chosen to satisfy the following requirements:<br>
-	strong adhesion to the surface of the steel tubular<br>
segment 8;<br>
-	high resistance to mechanical stresses;<br>
-	appropriate thermal expansion coefficient;<br>
-	high  dielectric  withstand  strength,  greater  than<br>
10 kV/mm;<br>
-	dielectric capacitance that can be adjusted;<br>
-	stability with regard to oxidants.<br>
Among these requirements,  the first two are the most<br>
difficult to satisfy.<br>
The adhesion of the ceramic can be easily tested using a hammer to strike the surface of the ceramic. The resulting configuration of the flakes or slivers should resemble conical holes, the tips of which are formed by steel points on the wall of the tubular segment. A configuration showing greater areas of the steel wall of the tubular segment clearly indicates inadequate adhesion of the ceramic.<br>
The roughness of the surface of the tubular segment 8, obtained as explained previously, considerably enhances the keying of the ceramic coating.<br>
The mechanical strength of the ceramic coating can be verified on assembling the tubular segments 8 in a generator. For this, a torque greater than the rated torque is exerted on the nuts 12 or 13 located at the ends of the axial rod 11. For example, the testing torque is greater than twice the rated torque. Thus, when the torque of the nuts 12, 13 is designed to be of the order of 1 Nm, the mechanical resistance test on the ceramic coating is performed with a torque of approximately 3 Nm. According to the invention, the tubular segments 8 with convex end plates coated with at least two layers 9a, 9b support such a torque without cracks appearing in the ceramic coating.<br>
The convex surface, roughly in the form of a spherical cap, of the ends 8a, 8b of the tubular segments, has a radius of curvature ensuring an optimal transition for the electrical field. The rounded form of the ends 8a, 8b makes it possible to avoid excessively sharp corners and excessively abrupt variations of the electrical field between the external electrode and the internal electrode.<br>
A generator according to the invention well withstands<br>
the   shocks   of  pressure  and/or  voltage   and/or temperature.   Such  shocks  appear,   in  particular, following instabilities due to the decomposition of the ozone when its content exceeds  12%  of  the gas by weight. For such a content, when the ozone decomposes, pressure shocks with the release of heat take place.<br>
The operation of the generator according to the invention is the immediate result of the above<br>
explanations.<br>
The air that enters through the nozzle 21 flows through the interstices I and is subject to electrical discharges because of the voltage between the internal electrode 7, 8 and the external electrode 4. Ozone is produced and the ozone-enriched air exits through the nozzle 20.<br>
A generator according to the invention has correctly operated:<br>
-	at a high test voltage of 16 kV instead of the 10 kV<br>
normally provided;<br>
-	with  charges  ranging  up  to  12 kw/m2  instead  of<br>
6 kw/m2, in normal operation, to provoke an external<br>
insulation fault;<br>
-	with mechanical torques exerted on the nuts 12 or 13<br>
ranging up to 6 Nm instead of  the 2 Nm normally<br>
provided.Despite these extreme operating conditions, no cracks appeared in the ceramic coatings of the tubular segments 8.<br>
