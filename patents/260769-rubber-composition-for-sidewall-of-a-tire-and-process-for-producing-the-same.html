DESCRIPTION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a rubber composition for<br>
sidewall and a preparation process thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Conventionally, in a rubber composition for a sidewall of a<br>
tire, a butadiene rubber (BR) is compounded in order to improve flex<br>
crack growth property, in addition to a natural rubber (NR) showing<br>
excellent tear strength, and further, carbon black has been used so as<br>
to improve weather resistance and reinforcing property.<br>
However, in recent years, environmental problems have<br>
been emphasized, and regulations on suppression of CO2 emission are<br>
reinforced, and further, since petroleum resources are finite and-<br>
supply thereof has been decreasing year by year, increase of petroleum<br>
prices in the future is predicted, thus, there is a limit in use of raw<br>
materials derived from petroleum resources such as BR and carbon<br>
black. Therefore, when assuming the case where petroleum oil is depleted in the future, it is necessary to use resources other than<br>
petroleum resources such as NR-and silica. In such a case, however,<br>
there is a problem that the same or more performances such as flex<br>
crack resistance • and reinforcing property cannot be obtained as.<br>
compared with the case of conventionally used petroleum resources.<br><br>
JP-A-2003-63206 discloses an ecological tire having no<br>
less properties as compared with conventional tires, in which a ratio of<br>
resources other than petroleum resources is increased in a tire by<br>
using specific resources other than petroleum resources, but the<br>
ecological tire does not improve tear strength and flex crack growth<br>
resistance with favorable balance.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a rubber<br>
composition for a sidewall, in which an effect on environments can be<br>
taken into consideration, provision for the future decrease in<br>
petroleum supply can be satisfied, and further, tear strength, flex<br>
crack growth resistance and durability can be improved with favorable<br>
balance without increasing hardness, and a preparation process<br>
thereof.<br>
The present invention relates to a rubber composition for a<br>
sidewall, comprising 15 to 60 parts by weight of silica and 2 to 20<br>
parts by weight of a double bond-containing plasticizer derived from<br>
resources other than petroleum resources on the basis of 100 parts by<br>
weight of a rubber component containing 30 to 80 % by weight of a<br>
natural rubber and 20 to 70 % by weight of an epoxidized natural<br>
rubber.<br>
It is preferable that the double bond-containing plasticizer<br>
derived from resources other than petroleum resources has an iodine<br>
value of not less than 90.<br>
It is preferable that a process for preparing the rubber<br>
composition for a sidewall comprises (1) a step of kneading a natural<br><br>
rubber, silica and a double bond-containing plasticizer derived from<br>
resources other than petroleum resources, and (2) a step of kneading<br>
the kneaded product discharged in the step (1) and an epoxidized<br>
natural rubber.<br>
It is preferable that a process for preparing the rubber<br>
composition for a sidewall comprises (1) a step of preparing a<br>
masterbatch by kneading an epoxidized natural rubber and a double<br>
bond-containing plasticizer derived from resources other than<br>
petroleum resources, (2) a step of kneading a natural rubber and silica,<br>
and (3) a step of kneading the masterbatch discharged in the step (1)<br>
and the kneaded product discharged in the step (2).<br>
It is preferable that the rubber composition for a sidewall<br>
further comprises 4 to 16 parts by weight of a silane compound<br>
satisfying the following general formula:<br>
Xn-Si-Y4-n<br>
wherein X is an alkoxy group, Y is a phenyl group or an alkyl group,<br>
and n is an integer of 1 to 3, on the basis of 100 parts by weight of<br>
silica.<br>
The present invention also relates to a tire having a<br>
sidewall, which comprises the rubber composition for a sidewall.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The rubber composition for a sidewall of the present<br>
invention comprises a rubber component, silica and a double<br>
bond-containing plasticizer derived from resources other than<br><br>
petroleum resources.<br>
The rubber component comprises a natural rubber (NR)<br>
and an epoxidized natural rubber (ENR).<br>
As the NR, natural rubbers generally used in the rubber<br>
industries such as TSR20 and RSS#3 may be used.<br>
A content of NR in the rubber component is not less than<br>
30 % by weight, preferably not less than 40 % by weight. When the<br>
content of NR is less than 30 % by weight, crack growth resistance is<br>
deteriorated. The content of NR is not more than 80 % by weight,<br>
preferably not more than 70 % by weight. When the content of NR is<br>
more than 80 % by weight, crack growth resistance is deteriorated.<br>
As the ENR, commercially available ENR may be used, or it<br>
is possible to epoxidize NR to be used. A process for epoxidizing ENR<br>
is not specifically limited and the epoxidizing can be carried out using<br>
processes such as a chlorohydrin method, a direct oxidation method, a<br>
hydrogen peroxide method, an alkylhydroperoxide method and a<br>
peracid method. An example of the peracid method is a process of<br>
reacting peracid such as peracetic acid or performic acid with NR.<br>
An epoxidization ratio of ENR is preferably not less than<br>
5 % by mol, more preferably not less than 10 % by mol. When the<br>
epoxidization ratio of ENR is less than 5 % by mol, there is a tendency<br>
that effects resulting from compatibility between ENR and NR decrease.<br>
Further, the epoxidization ratio of ENR is preferably not more than<br>
60 % by mol, and more preferably not more than 50 % by mol. When<br>
the epoxidization ratio of ENR is more than 60 % by mol, there is a<br>
tendency that rubber strength is not sufficient.<br>
A content of ENR in the rubber component is not less than<br><br>
20 % by weight, and preferably not less than 30 % by weight. When<br>
the content of ENR is less than 20 % by weight, crack growth<br>
resistance is lowered. The content of ENR is not more than 70 % by<br>
weight, and preferably not more than 60 % by weight. When the<br>
content of ENR is more than 70 % by weight, crack growth resistance<br>
is deteriorated.<br>
The rubber component can contain, besides NR and ENR,<br>
rubbers such as styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), butadiene rubber<br>
(BR), butyl rubber (IIR), halogenated butyl rubber (X-IIR), and a<br>
halogenated product of a copolymer of an isomonoolefin and<br>
p-alkylstyrene, and it is preferable that rubbers other than NR and<br>
ENR are not contained from the viewpoints that such rubbers are<br>
obtained from resources other than petroleum resources, an effect on<br>
environments can be taken into consideration, and also provision for<br>
the future decrease in the petroleum supply can be satisfied.<br>
Silica is not particularly limited, and silica generally used<br>
in the rubber industries can be used.<br>
An amount of silica is not less than 15 parts by weight on<br>
the basis of 100 parts by weight of the rubber component, preferably<br>
not less than 20 parts by weight. When the amount of silica is less<br>
than 15 parts by weight, rubber strength is lowered, cut is generated<br>
on a side of a tire by stimulus from the outside, and abrasion<br>
resistance is lowered. The amount of silica is not more than 60 parts<br>
by weight, preferably not more than 40 parts by weight. When the<br>
amount of silica is more than 60 parts by weight, hardness excessively<br>
increases, and crack growth resistance is deteriorated.<br>
It is preferable that a silane compound is compounded<br><br>
together with silica in the rubber composition for a sidewall of the<br>
present invention. Flex crack growth resistance and durability can be<br>
enhanced by containing the silane compound. An example of the<br>
silane compound is a compound represented by the following formula:<br>
Xn-Si-Y4-n<br>
wherein X is an alkoxy group, Y is a phenyl group or an alkyl' group,<br>
and n is an integer of 1 to 3.<br>
In the formula, X is an alkoxy group, preferably a methoxy<br>
group or an ethoxy group for the reason of easily reacting with silica,<br>
and more preferably an ethoxy group for the reason that a firing point<br>
is high.<br>
Y is a phenyl group or an alkyl group, and when Y is a<br>
phenyl group, a firing point is as high as 111°C, thus, a phenyl group<br>
is preferable for the reason of being easily handled as compared with<br>
the case where when Y is an alkyl group, for instance, in the case of a<br>
methyl group (-CH3), a firing point is as low as 8°C, for example, in<br>
methylethoxysilane; and for instance, in the case of a hexyl group<br>
(-CH2(CH2)4CH3), a firing point is also as low as 81°C, for example, in<br>
hexyltriethoxy silane.<br>
n is an integer of 1 to 3. When n is 0, the silane<br>
compound does not have an alkoxy group, and there is a tendency that<br>
the silane compound cannot react with silica. When n is 4, there is a<br>
tendency that the silane compound is hardly compatible with a rubber.<br>
For the reason that reactivity with silica is high, n is preferably 3.<br>
Examples of a silane compound satisfying the<br><br>
above-described formula are methyltrimethoxysilane (such as KBM13<br>
available from Shin-Etsu Chemical Co., Ltd.), dimethyldimethoxysilane<br>
(such as KBM22 available from Shin-Etsu Chemical Co., Ltd.),<br>
phenyltrimethoxysilane (such as KBM103 available from Shin-Etsu<br>
Chemical Co., Ltd.), diphenyldimethoxysilane (such as KBM202SS<br>
available from Shin-Etsu Chemical Co., Ltd.), methyltriethoxysilane<br>
(such as KBE13 available from Shin-Etsu Chemical Co., Ltd.),<br>
dimethyldiethoxysilane (such as KBE22 available from Shin-Etsu<br>
Chemical Co., Ltd.), phenyltriethoxysilane (such as KBE103 available<br>
from Shin-Etsu Chemical Co., Ltd.), diphenyldiethoxysilane (such as<br>
KBE202 available from Shin-Etsu Chemical Co., Ltd.),<br>
hexyltrimethoxysilane (such as KBM3063 available from Shin-Etsu<br>
Chemical Co., Ltd.), hexyltriethoxysilane (such as KBE3063 available<br>
from Shin-Etsu Chemical Co., Ltd.), and decyltximethoxysilane (such<br>
as KBM3103 and KBM3103C available from Shin-Etsu Chemical Co.,<br>
Ltd.). Among these, phenyltriethoxysilane is preferable for the reason<br>
that reactivity with silica is high and a firing point is high.<br>
A content of the silane compound is preferably not less<br>
than 4 parts by weight on the basis of 100 parts by weight of silica,<br>
more preferably not less than 8 parts by weight. When the content of<br>
the silane compound is less than 4 parts by weight, there is a tendency<br>
that sufficient flex crack growth resistance, tear strength and<br>
durability cannot be obtained. The content of the silane compound is<br>
preferably not more than 16 parts by weight, more preferably not more .<br>
than 12 parts by weight. When the content of the silane compound is<br>
more than 16 parts by weight, there is a tendency that tear strength is<br>
lowered.<br><br>
In the present invention, a silane coupling agent can be<br>
used together with the silica and the silane compound. The silane<br>
coupling agent is not particularly limited, and silane coupling agents<br>
generally used in the rubber industries, for instance, sulfide silane<br>
coupling agents such as Si69 can be used.<br>
A content of the silane coupling agent is preferably not less<br>
than 4 parts by weight on the basis of 100 parts by weight of silica,<br>
and more preferably not less than 8 parts by weight. When the<br>
content of the silane coupling agent is less than 4 parts by weight,<br>
there is a tendency that rubber strength is lowered. The content of<br>
the silane coupling agent is preferably not more than 20 parts by<br>
weight, and more preferably not more than 16 parts by weight. When<br>
the content of the silane coupling agent is more than 20 parts by<br>
weight, there is a tendency that rubber strength is lowered.<br>
Examples of the double bond-containing plasticizer derived<br>
from resources other than petroleum resources are a linseed oil, a<br>
soybean oil, an oleyl alcohol, and a terpene resin. Among these, a<br>
linseed oil and/or a terpene resin is preferable from the viewpoint that<br>
crack growth resistance is excellent. Aromatic oils and paraffin oils<br>
are plasticizers derived from petroleum resources, which are, therefore,<br>
not suitable for the purpose of the instant application that an effect on<br>
environments can be taken into consideration.<br>
An iodine value of the double bond-containing plasticizer<br>
derived from resources other than petroleum resources is preferably<br>
not less than 90, more preferably not less than 130, further more<br>
preferably not less than 190. When the iodine value of the double<br>
bond-containing plasticizer derived from resources other than<br><br>
petroleum resources is less than 90, there is a tendency that sufficient<br>
improvement effects of crack growth resistance cannot be obtained.<br>
A content of the double bond-containing plasticizer derived<br>
from resources other than petroleum resources is not less than 2 parts<br>
by weight on the basis of 100 parts by weight of the rubber component,<br>
preferably not less than 4 parts by weight, more preferably not less<br>
than 5 parts by weight. When the content of the double<br>
bond-containing plasticizer derived from resources ■ other than<br>
petroleum resources is less than 2 parts by weight, sufficient<br>
improvement effects of crack growth resistance due to compounding<br>
the double bond-containing plasticizer derived from resources other<br>
than petroleum resources cannot be obtained. The' content of the<br>
double bond-containing plasticizer derived from resources other than<br>
petroleum resources is not more than 20 parts by weight, preferably<br>
not more than 15 parts by weight. When the content of the double<br>
bond-containing plasticizer derived from resources other than<br>
petroleum resources is more than 20 parts by weight, rubber strength<br>
is lowered.<br>
Besides the above-described rubber component, silica,<br>
silane compound, silane coupling agent and double bond-containing<br>
plasticizer derived from resources other than petroleum resources,<br>
compounding agents conventionally compounded in the rubber<br>
industries such as a wax, various antioxidants, stearic acid, zinc oxide,<br>
sulfur and various vulcanization accelerators can . be suitably<br>
compounded in the rubber composition for a sidewall of the present<br>
invention.<br>
The rubber composition for a sidewall of the present<br><br>
invention is used particularly for a sidewall in a tire from the viewpoint<br>
that flex crack growth resistance is particularly improved.<br>
A process for preparing the rubber composition for a<br>
sidewall in the first embodiment of the present- invention (preparation<br>
process 1) comprises the following steps 1 and 2.<br>
In the step 1, NR, silica and a double bond-containing<br>
plasticizer are kneaded.<br>
In the step 2, the kneaded product discharged in the step<br>
(1) and ENR are kneaded.<br>
In the step 1, compounding agents such as a silane<br>
compound, a silane coupling agent, a wax, various antioxidants,<br>
stearic acid and zinc oxide can be compounded.<br>
In addition, an effect of improving flex crack growth<br>
resistance can be obtained by kneading ENR in the step 2, not in the<br>
step 1.<br>
A process for preparing the rubber composition for a<br>
sidewall in the second embodiment of the present invention<br>
(preparation process 2) comprises the following steps 1, 2 and 3.<br>
In the step 1, a masterbatch is prepared by mixing ENR<br>
and a double bond-containing plasticizer.<br>
In the step 2, NR and silica are kneaded.<br>
In the step 3, the masterbatch discharged in the step 1<br>
and the kneaded product discharged in the step 2 are kneaded.<br>
In the step 1, a content of the double bond-containing .<br>
plasticizer when the masterbatch is prepared is preferably not less<br>
than 5 parts by weight on the basis of 100 parts by weight of ENR,<br>
more preferably not less than 10 parts by weight. When the content of<br><br>
th'e double bond-containing plasticizer is less than 5 parts by weight,<br>
there is a tendency that sufficient improvement effects of flex crack<br>
growth resistance due to compounding the double bond-containing<br>
plasticizer cannot be obtained. The content of double bond-containing<br>
plasticizer is preferably not more than 50 parts by weight, more<br>
preferably not more than 30 parts by weight. When the content of<br>
double bond-containing plasticizer is more than 50 parts by weight, a<br>
viscosity is excessively lowered, and there is a tendency that<br>
processability is significantly deteriorated.<br>
In the step 2, compounding agents such as a silane<br>
compound, a silane coupling agent, a wax, various antioxidants,<br>
stearic acid and zinc oxide can be also compounded.<br>
An effect of improving crack growth resistance can be<br>
obtained by preparing a masterbatch in the step 1 and kneading in the<br>
step 3.<br>
The tire of the present invention is prepared by using the<br>
rubber composition for a sidewall of the present invention; the rubber<br>
composition for a sidewall of the present invention obtained by<br>
compounding the above compounding agents according to the<br>
necessity by the above-described preparation processes 1, 2 or general<br>
processes is extrusion-processed while being adjusted to a shape of a<br>
sidewall of a tire in an unvulcanization step, and molded on a tire<br>
molding machine to form an un vulcanized tire. This unvulcanized tire<br>
is heated and pressurized in a vulcanizer to obtain the tire of the<br>
present invention.<br>
By using the rubber composition for a sidewall of the<br>
present invention, the tire of the present invention can be an ecological<br><br>
tire, in which an effect on environments can be taken into<br>
consideration, and provision for the future decrease in the petroleum<br>
supply can be satisfied.<br>

1.7L-banbury mixer manufactured by Kobe Steel., Ltd., to obtain a<br>
kneaded product 1 (step 1). Then, after discharging once, the<br>
kneaded product 1 obtained in the step 1 and the masterbatches 1 to 4<br>
were charged so as to have a filling ratio of 58 %, and kneaded until a<br>
temperature reached 140°C, using a 1.7L-banbury mixer<br>
manufactured by Kobe Steel., Ltd., to obtain a kneaded product 2 (step<br>
2). Then, the kneaded product 2 obtained in the step 2, sulfur and a<br>
vulcanization accelerator were kneaded for not less than 2 minutes<br>
under a temperature of not more than 100°C, using an 8-inch roll, to<br>
obtain an unvulcanized rubber composition (step 3). Further, the<br>
unvulcanized rubber composition obtained in the step 3 was<br>
press-vulcanized for 20 minutes under a temperature of 160°C,<br>
thereby, vulcanized rubber compositions of Examples 1 to 10 and<br>
Comparative Examples 1 to 11 were prepared.	Regarding<br>
Comparative Example 9, ENR was not kneaded in the step 1, but was<br>
kneaded in the step 2.<br><br>
(Hardness test)<br>
According to JIS-K6253 "Hardness testing method for<br>
rubber, vulcanized or thermoplastic", hardness was measured with a<br>
spring-type A.<br>
(Tear test)<br>
According ■ to JIS-K6252 "Rubber, vulcanized or<br>
thermoplastics — Determination of tear strength", a tear strength<br>
(N/mm) was measured by using an angle-shaped test piece without<br>
notches.<br>
(Flex crack growth resistance test)<br>
According to JIS-K6260 "Testing of flex cracking and crack<br>
growth for rubber, vulcanized or thermoplastic (De Mattia)", a bending<br>
test was carried out on the vulcanized rubber composition sample, and<br>
the number of times of bending until 1 mm-long crack was generated<br>
in the rubber composition sample was measured under a temperature<br>
of 25°C. Herein, log (10,000 times/mm) indicates the number of times<br>
measured until the crack is generated as an index. It indicates that<br>
the larger the value is, the more excellent flex crack growth resistance<br>
is. 70 % and 110 % indicate elongation ratios for a length of the<br>
original vulcanized rubber composition sample.<br>
(Durability)<br>
The above described unvulcanized rubber composition was<br>
molded into a shape of a sidewall and laminated with other tire parts<br>
to form an unvulcanized tire, and the unvulcanized tire was<br>
press-vulcanized for 20 minutes under a temperature of 160°C to<br>
prepare a tire for testing (size: 195/65R15).<br>
Using a drum (outer diameter: 1.7 m)," a load was applied '<br><br>
to. the prepared tire under the conditions of a rim (15 * 6.00 J J), a load<br>
(6.96 kN), an inner pressure (150 kPa), and a speed (80 km/h), and the<br>
tire was continuously run until a crack was generated in a sidewall<br>
part to measure a distance (crack generation distance) at the time of<br>
generating a crack. Then, the crack generation distance of each<br>
composition was expressed as an index from the following calculation<br>
equation, assuming a durability index of Comparative Example 2 as<br>
100.<br>
(Durability index) = (crack generation distance of each<br>
composition)/(crack generation distance of Comparative Example 2) *<br>
100<br>
Evaluation results of the above-described tests are shown<br>
in Table 1.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
In Comparative Example 1, a conventional rubber<br>
composition prepared using carbon black was used.<br>
In Examples 1, 2, 5, 6 and 9, due to compounding a<br>
specific rubber component and a double bond-containing plasticizer<br>
derived from resources other than petroleum resources, tear strength,<br>
flex crack growth resistance and durability could be improved with<br>
favorable balance without increasing hardness.<br>
In Examples 3, 4, 7, 8 and 10, due to adding<br>
masterbatches prepared by kneading ENR and a double<br>
bond-containing plasticizer derived from resources other than<br>
petroleum resources in the step 2, tear strength, flex crack growth<br>
resistance and durability could be further improved.<br>
In Comparative Examples 2 to 8, double bond-containing<br>
plasticizers derived from resources other than petroleum resources<br>
were not compounded, and not only hardness was increased but also<br>
tear strength, flex crack growth resistance and durability could not be<br>
improved with favorable balance, and as a result, durability was<br>
particularly insufficient.<br>
In Comparative Examples 9 and 10, although a plasticizer<br>
was compounded, the plasticizer was not a double bond-containing<br>
plasticizer derived from resources other than petroleum resources,<br>
consequently, tear strength and durability in particular resulted in<br>
being insufficient.<br>
In Comparative Example 11, since ENR was not<br>
compounded, any of tear strength, flex crack growth resistance and<br>
durability could not be improved.<br><br>
