				<td>FRONT SUCTION/DISCHARGE TYPE OUTDOOR UNIT FOR AIR CONDITIONER<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an outdoor unit for an air conditioner, and more particularly to, a front suction/discharge type outdoor unit for an air conditioner.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
An air conditioner implying a cooler, a heater or both of them is classified into a window type and a split type. In the case of the cooler, a split type air conditioner includes an indoor unit installed indoors for cooling a room, and an outdoor unit coupled to the indoor unit through refrigerant pipe lines and installed outdoors to contact air, for performing condensation heat exchange between outdoor air and a refrigerant gas in a condenser as a cooling medium, and supplying the condensed refrigerants to an evaporator of the indoor unit through the refrigerant pipe lines. The indoor unit is comprised of the evaporator for performing cooling heat exchange for evaporating the refrigerants and absorbing evaporation heat from indoor air, and a ventilating fan for circulating indoor air, and the outdoor unit is comprised of a compressor for compressing the refrigerant gas and supplying the compressed gas to the condenser, the air-cooled condenser for condensing the refrigerant gas supplied from the compressor, and a cooling fan for forcibly ventilating outdoor air to the air-cooled condenser to cool and condense the<br>
refrigerant gas. The compressor, the air-cooled condenser and the cooling fan of the outdoor unit are installed in an outdoor unit casing composing the outer appearance. The conventional hexahedral outdoor unit casing has an air suction<br>
unit for sucking air to the air-cooled condenser at its three sides, and an air discharge unit for externally discharging air absorbing condensation heat from the refrigerant gas by the heat exchange in the air-cooled condenser on its top surface.<br>
However, the conventional outdoor unit for the air conditioner is restricted in installation spaces due to high density and strict environment regulations of cities, and increases civil applications due to noise and heat. Especially, in a common residential area such as large-scaled apartment buildings, the outdoor units must be installed in indoor verandas to improve the appearance and prevent noise.<br>
In order to solve the foregoing problems, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application 6-101873 suggests an air conditioner mounted building where an indoor unit of an air conditioner is installed indoors or adjacent to a room intended to be air-conditioned, and an outdoor unit of the air conditioner is installed outdoors, wherein an opening is formed on the outer wall or roof, a louver is installed in the opening, the outdoor unit of the air conditioner is disposed in the louver, and suction/discharge of the outdoor unit is performed through a gap between louver plates.<br>
In addition, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application 3-213928 discloses a built-in type outdoor unit for an air conditioner including an outdoor unit main body for the air conditioner which is built in the wall and which includes a frame having the same size and thickness as the wall, a suction hole for heat exchange air installed on the same surface as the outdoor unit main body, and a discharge hole for heat exchanged air.<br>
Recently, the outdoor unit requires high heat exchange efficiency due to increase of air conditioning capacity. Differently from the general three-surface suction type outdoor unit, a front suction/discharge type outdoor unit sucks air through its front surface, namely one surface. Such a small suction unit reduces<br>
heat exchange efficiency. Nevertheless, there has never been suggested a structure or arrangement for improving heat exchange efficiency in a front suction/discharge type outdoor unit which inevitably has a small suction area of outdoor air.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is achieved to solve the above problems. An object of the present invention is to maximize heat exchange efficiency by efficiently inducing outdoor air to an air-cooled condenser in an outdoor unit for sucking air through its front surface, namely one surface due to a small area of a suction unit.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to increase heat exchange efficiency by passing outdoor air sucked through a front surface unit of a front suction/discharge type outdoor unit through an air-cooled condenser, exchanging heat between outdoor air and refrigerants, and discharging heat-exchanged air to the outdoors.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a coupling structure of inside components of an outdoor unit which can efficiently achieve the above objects.<br>
In order to achieve the above-described objects of the invention, there is provided a front suction/discharge type outdoor unit for an air conditioner, including: an outdoor unit casing having a front surface unit opened to be linked to the outside of a building, both side units formed at both ends of the front surface unit, a rear surface unit formed to face the front surface unit, a bottom surface unit formed at the lower ends of the front surface unit, the both side units and the rear surface unit, and a top surface unit formed at the upper ends of the front surface unit, the both side units and the rear surface unit; a compressor for compressing a<br>
refrigerant gas supplied from an indoor unit to the outdoor unit casing; an air-cooled condenser installed in the outdoor unit casing, and disposed to face at least two surfaces of the front surface unit, the both side units and the rear surface unit at a predetermined distance, for condensing the refrigerant gas supplied from the compressor; a cooling fan for sucking outdoor air from the outside of the building through the front surface unit and the air-cooled condenser, and discharging air heat-exchanged in the air-cooled condenser to the outside of the building through the front surface unit; and a top cover installed at the upper side of a space unit formed between the air-cooled condenser and the surfaces of the outdoor unit casing facing the air-cooled condenser, for inducing outdoor air sucked from the outside of the building through the front surface unit to the space unit.<br>
Preferably, the outdoor unit further includes a side cover having its one side fastened to the end of the air-cooled condenser, and its other side fastened to the surface of the outdoor unit casing facing the air-cooled condenser, the side cover fixedly supporting the air-cooled condenser to the outdoor unit casing, and preventing outdoor air sucked through the front surface unit from passing between the end of the air-cooled condenser and the outdoor unit casing. Preferably, at least one of both ends of the air-cooled condenser is fixedly installed on any one of the both side units and the rear surface unit of the outdoor unit casing. More preferably, the air-cooled condenser has its one end fixedly installed on the rear surface unit of the outdoor unit casing, and its other end fixedly installed on the side unit of the outdoor unit casing by the side cover having its one side fastened to the other end of the air-cooled condenser and its other side fastened to one of the both side units. In any case, the air-cooled condenser can be fixedly installed on the bottom surface unit of the outdoor unit casing by the side cover and/or other special<br>
member.<br>
Preferably, the top cover is installed to cover the uppermost end of the air-cooled condenser. In this case, the top cover is coupled to the both side units and/or the rear surface unit. Otherwise, a supporting member for supporting the coolingfan is provided, and the top cover is fixedly installed in the cooling fan supporting member.<br>
In addition, the outdoor unit casing is divided into a suction casing in which the air-cooled condenser is installed, and a discharge casing in which the cooling fan is installed, and the top cover is installed to compose a top surface unit of the suction casing. In this case, the top cover is further provided with a coupling member for coupling the discharge casing to the suction casing. The coupling member includes a guide means for guiding the discharge casing, when installed on the suction casing, and also includes a fixing means for fixing the discharge casing in a normal position, when installed on the suction casing. In any case, the suction casing and the discharge casing are coupled to each other by using the top cover.<br>
The top cover is formed by using one or plural members. When the top cover includes the plurality of members, the plurality of members are not coupled to each other but overlap with each other.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
A front suction/discharge type outdoor unit for an air conditioner in accordance with the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
Figs. 1 and 2A illustrate a front suction/discharge type outdoor unit for an air<br>
conditioner in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention.<br>
An external frame 4 is fixedly installed in an opened space linked to the outside of a building on an outer wall 2 of a residential and/or commercial building, and an internal frame 6 is fixedly installed inside the external frame 4. If necessary, the internal and external frames 4 and 6 can be incorporated. An inside area of the internal frame 6 is divided into a suction area 7a and a discharge area 7b. A plurality of louver blades 8 are installed in each area, so that air can be sucked or discharged through gaps between the louver blades 8 as indicated by arrows of Fig. 1.<br>
An open angle of the louver blades 8 is manually or electromotively controlled by using a driving device (not shown). If necessary, the louver blades 8 can be maintained in an open state at a predetermined angle by predetermining a suction/discharge direction of air.<br>
On the other hand, an outdoor unit 10 fixedly installed at the inside of the outer wall 2 of the building to contact the external frame 4 and/or internal frame 6 includes an outdoor unit casing compn'sed of components of Fig. 2A. In addition, outdoor unit components of Fig. 2A are installed in the outdoor unit casing.<br>
In the outdoor unit casing, a front surface unit facing the suction area 7a and the discharge area 7b of the internal frame 6 is opened to be linked to the outside of the building. The opened front surface unit is divided into a suction unit 11 a and a discharge unit 11b to correspond to the suction area 7a and the discharge area 7b of the internal frame 6. The outdoor unit casing also includes both side units 12a and 12b formed at both ends of the front surface unit, a rear surface unit 12c formed to face the front surface unit, a bottom surface unit 14 formed at the lower ends of the front surface unit, the both side units 12a and 12b and the rear surface unit 12c, and a top surface unit 16 formed at the upper ends of<br>
the front surface unit, the both side units 12a and 12b and the rear surface unit 12c. The both side units 12a and 12b, the rear surface unit 12c, the bottom surface unit 14 and the top surface unit 16 are closed to form, preferably, a rectangular parallelepiped outdoor unit casing. A mesh shaped front grill 60 is additionally installed on the front surface unit of the outdoor unit 10 to prevent invasion of animals (for example, rats). For convenience' sake, reference numeral 60 is used for both the opened front surface unit and the front grill. For easy transportation and installation, the outdoor unit casing can be divided into a suction casing corresponding to the suction unit 11a, and a discharge casing corresponding to the discharge unit 11b, which will later be discussed in detail.<br>
A plurality of leg members 18a, 18b, 18c and 18d are externally protruded from the bottom surface unit 14. The leg members 18a, 18b, 18c and 18d are installed on the bottom of the building, for example a veranda of an apartment building, for supporting heavy load of the outdoor unit 10. Preferably, four leg members 18a, 18b, 18c and 18d are formed in consideration of the shape of the bottom surface unit 14. A leg reinforcing member 19 for coupling and reinforcing the leg members 18a, 18b, 18c and 18d is formed below the bottom surface unit 14 in the horizontal direction. The leg members 18a, 18b, 18c and 18d further include screws (not shown) for controlling height. Accordingly, when the bottom of the building, for example the veranda of the apartment building is not flat, they can stably position the outdoor unit 10. If the two leg members 18a and 18b disposed in the forward direction (toward the outer wall of the building) among the leg members 18a, 18b, 18c and 18d further include transport wheels (not shown), it is much easier to transport the heavy load outdoor unit 10.<br>
A compressor 20 for compressing a refrigerant gas supplied from the indoor unit to the outdoor unit casing, and an air-cooled condenser 30 for performing<br>
condensed heat exchange between the refrigerant gas supplied from the compressor 20 and outdoor air are installed in the suction unit 11a of the outdoor unit 10.<br>
As described above, in the outdoor unit 10 sucking outdoor air through one surface, namely the opened front surface unit 60, the present invention is intended to improve heat exchange efficiency by efficiently inducing outdoor air sucked through the opened front surface unit 60 to the air-cooled condenser 30, and exchanging heat between outdoor air and refrigerants through the air-cooled condenser 30. For this, one of the most representative characteristics of the present invention is to install the air-cooled condenser 30 to face at least two surfaces of the front surface unit 60, the both side units 12a and 12b and the rear surface unit 12c at a predetermined distance. Figs. 2A and 3 illustrate a state where the air-cooled condenser 30 faces the opened front surface unit 60 and the both side units 12a and 12b at a predetermined distance.<br>
The air-cooled condenser 30 is fixedly supported on the both side units 12a and 12b and/or the bottom surface unit 14 by top covers 32a, 32b and 32c and/or side covers 34a and 34b. In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, condenser brackets 36a and 36b formed at both ends of the condenser 30 are fixed on the side covers 34a and 34b, and the side covers 34a and 34b are fixed on the both side units 12a and 12b, to fixedly install the condenser 30 in the outdoor unit casing.<br>
Fig. 2B shows the detailed example. The condenser 30 is formed by forming the condenser brackets 36a and 36b as shown in Fig. 2B at its both ends, inserting condenser tubes into a plurality of holes formed on the condenser brackets 36a and 36b, inserting condenser fins therebetween, and coupling the condenser tubes protruded from the plurality of holes by bent tubes. The side cover<br><br>
34b is coupled to one end of the condenser bracket 36b by using a special fastening member, and coupled to the side unit 12b of the outdoor unit casing by using a special fastening member, thereby fixedly installing the condenser 30 in the outdoor unit casing. If necessary, as described above, the condenser 30 can be coupled to the bottom surface unit 14 or the top covers 32a, 32b and 32c. However, the condenser 30 is stably fixedly installed in the outdoor unit casing merely by coupling the condenser brackets 36a and 36b formed at both ends of the condenser 30 to the side covers 34a and 34b in the length direction, and coupling the side covers 34a and 34b to the both side units 12a and 12b of the outdoor unit casing.<br>
That is, in accordance with the first embodiment of the present invention shown in Figs. 2A and 3, the condenser 30 is installed to have a U-shaped cross section, facing the opened front surface unit 60 facing the suction area 7a of the internal frame 6 at a predetermined distance, and facing the both side units 12a and 12b formed at both ends of the opened front surface unit 60 at a predetermined distance. Accordingly, outdoor air sucked through the suction area 7a passes directly through the condenser 30, or passes through the condenser 30 via the gaps between the both side units 12a and 12b and the condenser 30. Such a structure is shown in Fig. 3. In the air-cooled condenser 30, a plurality of condenser pipe lines are formed in a zigzag shape between a plurality of condenser fins. The structure and shape of the air-cooled condenser 30 have been publicly known, and thus detailed explanations thereof are omitted.<br>
The refrigerant gas compressed by the compressor 20 is transmitted through the pipe lines of the condenser 30, removed its condensed heat by externally-supplied air, and condensed. As a result, outdoor air sucked through the gaps between the louver blades 8 of the suction area 7a passes through the<br>
U-shaped condenser 30 along the wind path of the top covers 32a, 32b and 32c and the side covers 34a and 34b, and exchanges heat with the refrigerant gas flowing through the condenser pipe lines.<br>
The discharge unit 11 b of the outdoor unit 10 has a cooling fan 40 for supplying outdoor air to the air-cooled condenser 30 through the suction area 7a, and discharging heat-exchanged air through the discharge area 7b. One example of the cooling fan 40 is a sirocco fan. Still referring to Fig. 2A, the cooling fan 40 has its orifices face the upper and lower parts of the outdoor unit casing. However, the cooling fan 40 can also be formed to have its orifices face the both side units 12a and 12b of the outdoor unit casing. A cooling fan supporting member 42 is provided to support the cooling fan 40. In more detail, a housing of the cooling fan 40 can be fixedly installed on a cooling fan bracket 44 and a fan front 46. The shapes of the cooling fan bracket 44 and the fan front 46 for fixing the cooling fan 40 can be varied according to intentions of the designer.<br>
In addition, a control box 50 for controlling the operation of the outdoor unit<br>
10	is installed at the inside of the rear surface unit 12c, preferably in the suction unit<br>
11	a, and refrigerant pipe lines which the refrigerant gas evaporated in the indoor<br>
unit is sucked through, and a valve assembly 52, a path of the refrigerant pipe lines<br>
which the refrigerants condensed in the outdoor unit 10 are discharged through are<br>
installed below the control box 50.<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates flow of sucked outdoor air in a condenser-mounted structure of the outdoor unit of Fig. 1. Fig. 3 is a cross-sectional view illustrating the suction unit 11a of the outdoor unit 10 of Fig. 1. As discussed earlier, the side covers 34a and 34b fixedly support the condenser brackets 36a and 36b formed at both ends of the condenser 30, and are fixedly supported by the both side units 12a and 12b. Therefore, the condenser 30 is separated from the front surface unit<br><br>
60 and the both side units 12a and 12b, and thus a space unit is formed among the condenser 30, the front surface unit 60 and the both side units 12a and 12b. Outdoor air sucked through the opened front surface unit 60 is induced to pass through the front surface of the condenser 30 via the space unit between the front surface unit 60 and the condenser 30 as indicated by arrow A, or to pass through the side surface of the condenser 30 via the space unit between the both side units 12a and 12b and the condenser 30 as indicated by arrows B and C. Here, as described above, the top covers 32a, 32b and 32c are installed at the upper portion of the space unit, to prevent outdoor air sucked through the front surface unit 60 from being sucked to the cooling fan 40 in the discharge unit 11 b without passing through the condenser 30. Moreover, the condenser 30 includes rounded bending units 30a and 30b, so that outdoor air can more easily pass through the condenser 30 than when sucked through the opened front surface unit 60. Preferably, the condenser 30 is formed in the U shape.<br>
The operation of the front suction/discharge type outdoor unit for the air conditioner will now be described in detail.<br>
The refrigerant gas supplied from the indoor unit through the refrigerant pipe lines of the valve assembly 52 is compressed through the compressor 20 and supplied to the condenser 30. Because the cooling fan 40 is operated, air sucked through the gaps between the louver blades 8 of the suction area 7a and the front surface unit 60 of the outdoor unit casing evenly passes between the fins formed on the three surfaces of the U-shaped condenser 30 through the wind path of the top covers 32a, 32b and 32c, the both side units 12a and 12b and the side covers 34a and 34b, obtains condensed heat from the refrigerant gas flowing through the condenser pipe lines inserted between the fins, passes through the cooling fan 40 with a high temperature, and is externally discharged through the gaps between<br>
the louver blades 8 of the discharge area 7b.<br>
Figs. 4A and 4B are exemplary views illustrating variations of flow of sucked outdoor air by rounding R of the condenser in the outdoor unit in accordance with the present invention.<br>
When the rounding R which is a rounding value of the section of the condenser 30 is small, as indicated by arrows F and F' of Fig. 4A, air heated by heat exchange using the condenser 30 is discharged to the space unit between the both side units 12a and 12b and the condenser 30, and then passes again between the fins of the condenser 30, to reduce heat exchange efficiency. Accordingly, in the U-shaped condenser 30 as shown in Figs. 4A and 4B, the inventors of the present invention researched the relations between a gap distance D between the both side units 12a and 12b and the condenser 30 and the rounding R which is the rounding value of the condenser 30 according to numerical methods, and finally reached a conclusion that the rounding R must be at least twice as large as the gap distance D. In this case, as illustrated in Fig. 4B, air heated through the condenser 30 rarely flows backward to the gaps between the side covers 12a and 12b and the condenser 30. If R increases, air is more prevented from flowing backward. However, it may reduce the length of the pipe lines of the condenser 30 per unit area. Here, R is defined as a radius of an arc composing the bending unit of the condenser 30.<br>
Figs. 5A to 5F illustrate various examples of condenser shapes and mounted structures in an outdoor unit in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention. In the following description, same drawing reference numerals are used for the same elements.<br>
As depicted in Fig. 5A, the coupling units of the condenser tubes formed at both ends of the condenser 30 can be sufficiently long to contact the rear surface<br>
unit 12c. In this case, a volume of the space unit formed among the both side units 12a and 12b, the top covers 32a, 32b and 32c and the condenser 30 increases, and an absolute area for heat exchange increases, to improve heat exchange efficiency. Still referring to Fig. 5A, the side covers 34a and 34b can be coupled to the both side units 12a and 12b, or the condenser brackets 36a and 36b can be coupled directly to the rear surface unit 12c, to obtain a sufficient heat exchange area to the rear surface unit 12c. Although not illustrated, the condenser 30 can be formed to have its one end contact the rear surface unit 12c and its other end separated from the rear surface unit 12c or the side units 12a and 12b.<br>
As shown in Figs. 5B and 5C, when the condenser 30 mounted on the outdoor unit 10 has a sufficient space unit from one side unit 12a as described above, the side cover 34b can be installed in the R-bending end point of the condenser 30 in another side unit 12b (Fig. 5B), or fixed to the side unit 12b without forming the R bending in the side unit 12b (Fig. 5C). It reflects the flow analysis results of outdoor air sucked through the condenser 30 by the cooling fan 40 installed in the discharge unit 11b. As a result, the whole heat exchange efficiency is improved by reducing heat exchange in an area showing a relatively small suction flow. In the same manner, the condenser 30 is fixed to the both side units 12a and 12b by using the side covers 34a and 34b.<br>
As illustrated in Figs. 5D to 5F, one, two or more than three bent units can be formed to obtain the same effects, instead of the R bending. Referring to Fig. 5D, the bent unit is slightly tilted to face the both side units 12a and 12c or the front surface unit 60 at a predetermined distance. Here, outdoor air sucked through the front surface unit 60 passes between the fins of the condenser 30 and appropriately exchanges heat with the refrigerants flowing through the condenser tubes. In the condenser structures of Figs. 5E and 5F, the heat exchange can be<br>
efficiently performed in the same principle.<br>
In any one of the above cases, appropriate top covers 32a, 32b and 32c are required to prevent outdoor air sucked through the front surface unit 60 of the outdoor unit casing from being supplied to the discharge unit 11b without passing through the condenser 30. Fig. 2 shows the top cover including three members. However, as depicted in Figs. 6A and 6B, the top cover can be formed by using one member 32d or two members 32e and 32f. When the top cover includes a plurality of members, the plurality of members do not have to be mechanically coupled to each other. If the plurality of members overlap with each other, air sucked to the space unit below the top cover is rarely sucked to the discharge area 7b without passing through the condenser 30. In addition, the top cover needs not to be coupled to the condenser 30, but is coupled to the both side units 12a and 12b, and/or the side covers 34a and 34b, or the rear surface unit 12c of the outdoor unit casing, or coupled to the cooling fan supporting member 42.<br>
That is, the top covers 32a, 32b, 32c, 32d, 32e and 32f are installed at the upper side of the space unit formed between the air-cooled condenser 30 and the surfaces of the outdoor unit casing facing the air-cooled condenser 30 in order to induce outdoor air sucked from the outside of the building through the front surface unit 60 to the space unit. Therefore, outdoor air sucked to the space unit is prevented from being sucked to the discharge unit 11 b without passing through the condenser 30. In any case, the top covers must sufficiently cover the uppermost end of the condenser 30, to sufficiently induce air sucked to the space unit to the condenser 30.<br>
Fig. 6C shows another example of the top cover. Referring to Fig. 6C, the top cover 3 2g is used when the outdoor unit casing is divided into the suction casing corresponding to the suction unit 11 a and the discharge casing<br>
corresponding to the discharge unit 11 b. Here, the top cover 32g is comprised of one member, but can be formed by coupling a plurality of members as described above. The top cover 32g is fixedly supported on the suction casing to compose a top surface unit of the suction casing, and the discharge casing is disposed thereon. Still referring to Fig. 6C, guide members 33a and 33b and a fixing member 33c are curvedly formed o n t he top c over 3 2g, to h elp m ounting a nd installation of t he discharge casing.<br>
Fig. 7 is a perspective view illustrating disassembly of the outdoor unit in which the outdoor unit casing is divided into the suction casing and the discharge casing. Here, the cooling fan supporting member 42 is used as a frame of the discharge casing, and thus the same reference numeral is used. When the discharge casing is positioned on the suction casing and pushed along the guide members 33a and 33b, lower end side frames 42a and 42b of the discharge casing are guided by the guide members 33a and 33b, and a rear end bottom surface frame 42c contacting the rear surface unit 13c of the discharge casing is hooked on the fixing member 33c. The lower end side frames 42a and 42b and the guide members 3 3a a nd 3 3b a re coupled to each other by u sing a s pecial fastening member, and the rear end bottom surface frame 42c and the fixing member 33c are coupled to each other by using a special fastening member, thereby easily mounting and fixing the discharge casing on the suction casing.<br>
In the case that the outdoor unit casing is divided into the suction casing and the discharge casing, the condenser 30 is also fixed to the both side units 12a and 12b by using the side covers 34a and 34b. Here, the discharge casing also requires both side units 13a and 13b and a rear surface unit 13c. When the outdoor unit casing is divided into the suction casing and the discharge casing, if the whole volume and weight of the outdoor unit 10 increase, the outdoor unit 10 can be<br>
easily transported and installed.<br>
