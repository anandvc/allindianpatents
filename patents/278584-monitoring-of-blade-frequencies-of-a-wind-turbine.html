				<td>MONITORING CF BLADE FREQUENCIES OF A WIND TURBINE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method for monitoring blade frequencies of a wind turbine and a monitoring system for performing the method.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is known to monitor blade frequencies of a wind turbine to monitor if the frequencies of each blade are changing due to e.g. material faults in the blades, lightning strikes or other influences. The monitoring is usually done by placing one or more fast responsive sensors like accelerometers, in each blade of a wind turbine. This is an expensive solution because of the need of many expensive sensors.<br>
On existing wind turbines which do not have the mentioned sensors built into the blades to monitor the blade frequencies, it is very difficult and expensive to build in. the sensors afterwards as they have to be placed in each blade.<br>
•SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is thus an object of the present invention to provide a method for monitoring blade frequencies of a wind turbine and a monitoring system for performing the method which is both easier to build into existing wind turbines and less expensive.<br>
The inventive method for monitoring blade frequencies of a<br>
wind turbine with a tower, a nacelle, a hub and one or more<br>
rotating blades where an accelerometer or G-sensor placed in<br>
the nacelle senses the vibrations of the nacelle comprises<br>
the steps of:<br>
- modulating the sensed signals or vibrations from the G-<br>
sensor,<br>
- extracting the blade frequencies from the modulated G-sensor signals, e.g. by applying a Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT or DFFT) or a Phase Locked Loop oscillation (PPL).<br>
According to the inventive method, a sensor may sense the rotating angle azimuth of the blades. Then, modulating may be done with a function taking into account the rotating angle azimuth of the blades. For example, modulating could based on the cosine of the rotating angle azimuth of the blades.or on the sum of the cosine of the rotating angle azimuth of the blades and a constant number.<br>
Extracting the blade frequencies from the modulated G-sensor signals could be done by applying a Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT.or DFFT). or a Phase Locked Loop oscillation (PPL) on the modulated G-sensor signals.<br>
In a further development, the inventive method comprises the step of calculating a new frequency of each blade by comparing each blade frequency to the other blade frequencies and using this- comparing to calculate the change in each blade frequency. Alternatively or additionally, the metfhod could also"comprise the step of calculating a new frequency of each blade based on the difference between each blade frequency. When the new calculated frequency reaches a certain level, an alarm could be set.<br>
An inventive monitoring system monitors the blade frequencies of a wind turbine comprising a tower, in particular according to the inventive method. It comprises a nacelle, a hub and one or more rotating blades where an accelerometer or G-sensor placed in the nacelle senses the vibrations of the nacelle in a transverse and/or a. longitudinal direction and, optionally, a sensor that senses the rotating azimuth angle of the blades. The system is further equipped with a controller or calculating unit with input from the sensed signals. The controller or calculating unit comprises a modulation unit which modulates the sensed signals and a Fast<br>
Fourier Transformation (FFT or DFFT) unit or a Phase Locked Loop oscillation (PPL) unit which extracts each blade frequency from the modulated signal.<br>
The controller or calculation unit may further comprise a change detection unit detecting changes in the extracted ' blade frequencies. Such a change detection unit could, e.g., comprise a difference calculation unit for calculating differences between each blade frequency and a frequency calculation unit for calculating a new frequency of each blade based on the calculated differences. An integrator integrating the absolute value of the calculated differences could be used as the frequency calculation unit.<br>
The inventive system may further comprise an alarm unit which sets an alarm and/or stops the wind turbine when the change of each blade frequency or the new frequency reaches a certain level. Such an alarm unit may be integrated into the controller, in particular into the integrator.<br>
By the invention an accelerometer or G-sensor is placed into the nacelle of a wind turbine and thereby measuring the ■ vibrations of the nacelle. To extract the vibration signals originating from each blade, the vibration signals are, e.g..; combined with the measuring signals from the azimuth angle sensor (rotating angle), which is normally used for pitch, control. To further extract each blade frequency a Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) or Phase Locked Loop oscillation (PPL) is used. To further monitor a severe and alarming change in each blade frequency each blade frequency is compared to the other blade frequencies and an alarm is set if a given level is reached.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The monitoring system is build into a wind turbine 1 as shown in figures 1 to 3 comprising a tower 2, a nacelle 3, a hub 4 and one or more rotating blades 5. The monitoring system consists of a accelerometer 6 (also called a G-sensor) with a built-in controller or calculator (not shown) placed in the nacelle 3 for sensing vibrations of the nacelle 3 originating from the vibrations of each rotating blade 5. The G-sensor senses the vibrations in two directions, transverse the nacelle (x-direction) and along the nacelle (y-direction). As the G-sensor 6 with the built-in controller or calculator is placed in the nacelle 3 on top of the tower 2, it is obvious<br>
that the G-sensor senses the frequencies of all the blades through the vibrations of the tower 2. To extract each blade frequency the rotating angle (azimuth angle)   of the rotating blades is used by the monitoring system. The rotating azimuth angle  is sensed by using a sensor (net shown) which is normally used for the pitch control, which is a common control system of a wind turbine.<br>
By the invention it is hereby possible to use only one G-sensor 6 placed in the nacelle 3 of a wind turbine 1 to monitor each blade frequency.  As mentioned above, this is done by also using the azimuth angle sensor for sensing the rotating angle position (azimuth angle) $ of the blades 5 (A, B and C), and by using the cosinus values of the azimuth angle  multiplied with the frequencies in the x-direction monitored by the G-sensbr 6 in the nacelle 3 (modulation). By using the cosin'us_ values of the azimuth angle $ primarily the vibrations in the x'-direction of each blade is monitored. This is done .with basis in the theory that the frequencies of the blade edge (in the x-direction) have the largest influence on .the nacelle with the G-sensor 6, when the blades 5 are in a vertical position (0 or 180 degrees) and almost no influence in the" horizontal position (90 or 270 degrees!. By using' the frequencies "corresponding to a displacement of the blades 5 of.respectively 0 degrees, 120 degrees and 240 degrees (in a typical three bladed wind turbine), and applying a Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT)- to the modulated G-sensor signals, the frequencies of each blade 5 is monitored.<br>
Alternatively the measured frequencies from the G-sensor   in the y-direction (along the nacelle) are used to calculate each blade frequency. Then it is not suitable to use the cosinus values of the azimuth angle , as the blades vibrate in the y-direction during the whole 360 degree of rotation. But as the moment load of the tower is larger in the top vertical position of the blades than in the bottom vertical position of the blades, it would be suitable to multiply the sensed frequencies with a function simulating these<br>
circumstances, like a constant number (e.g. number 1) added to the cosinus value of the azimuth angle  and then dividing this number with 2 ((1 + cosinus (azimuth angle /2).   This function gives a number between 1 and 0 in the range of 0 and 360 degrees, and thereby extracting each blade frequency as further described above. •<br>
The controller or calculating unit which has input from the sensed signals from the G-sensor 6 and the azimuth angle * comprises a modulation unit which modulates the sensed signals, a Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT or DFFT) unit or a Phase Locked Loop oscillation (PPL) unit which extracts each blade frequency from the modulated signals, and further an alarm unit which sets an alarm and/or stops the wind turbine when the change of each blade frequency reaches a certain level. All these units in the controller are not shown.<br>
Looking "only at vibrations due to the' edgewise resonance frequency, the blade edgewise accelerations for each blade (A, B and C) can be described as the formula below:<br>
(FORMULA REMOVED)<br>
Where a(t) is the blade acceleration edgewise, co is the edge wise resonance frequency, t is the time and k is a constant.<br>
The edge vibrations in the blade are coupled into the nacelle with a lp modulation (once per revolution modulation). Assuming that the blade edge vibrations couple most with the nacelle, when the blades have a vertical position (as earlier described), the nacelle vibrations can approximately be described by:<br>
(FORMULA REMOVED)<br>
Where ay(t, is the nacelle acceleration, aA is the blade A acceleration edgewise, aL. is the blade B acceleration edgewise, a- is the blade C acceleration edgewise,   is the rotor azimuth angle and k; is a constant.<br>
Modulation of the ax signal again with respect to the individual blade position gives 3 new signals defined by:<br>
(FORMULA REMOVED)<br>
In figure 4, it can be seen, that the frequency spectrum for a'mA has its peak at the same frequency as the blade edge frequency aA. It can also be seen that the .blade . frequency can not be separated just looking at the .frequency spectrum for the nacelle acceleration (ax) .<br>
Figure 5 shows a plot for the frequency spectra for ax and The frequency peaks can be seen at 1.19 [Hz] for blade C and 1.22 [Hz] for blade A and B. The frequency peak can be founded in the frequency domain, using a Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT or DFFT). The FFT data could then be smoothed using a filter and maximum value would be the blade edge frequency. The frequency peak could also be detected in the time domain, using a Phase Locked Loop (PLL) which synchronizes an internal oscillator with the amA...c signal. When the PLL is synchronized, the PLL oscillator frequency will be equal to the blade frequency.<br>
The edge frequency will be varying with changes in the temperature of the blade. There would also be some initial difference in the blade frequencies e.g. because of different<br>
mass distributions. Therefore the detection of the frequency change of one blade has to be with respect to the other blades. A method for detecting relative changes in the blade frequency is described in the formula below. The blade frequency for e.g. blade A (fA) is subtracted by the mean value of the others blades (F;. and F-:) . The initial difference (dfA unit&gt; is subtracted to remove the initial deviation. This could be found by calculating the mean value for e.g. one day.<br>
(FORMULA REMOVED)<br>
Integrating the absolute value of the difference (dfA..) subtracted by an allowed difference (dfallowed) gives a signal that Increases fast if there is great difference and slow when having small deviations. When the DiffLevA  (the same"-analogy for DiffLevB and DiffLevc )   reaches a given level an alarm should be set and the turbine should be stopped.<br>
(FORMULA REMOVED)<br>
Figure 6 shows an example where the blade C edge frequency is decreasing. When the allowed difference (fd~) is reached, the difference level (DiffLevA) begins to increase and trigs or sets the alarm, when it reaches 0.2.<br>
The frequency difference could also be calculated by looking at the ratio between the frequencies instead of the absolute difference:<br>
(FORMULA REMOVED)<br>
Frequency difference level detection:<br>
1.	If the difference is varying as a function of e.g. generator speed at normal operation without blade damage, the difference dfA..: should be integrated with a number of integrator which should perform the integration over a given speed interval.<br>
2.	The alarm could be set when a given maximum deviation is reached, without using the integrating method.<br>
A system for performing the method according to the invention is shown on Figure 7, where the blade frequency is found by using a FFT on the modulated acceleration signal and thereby" finding the peak, in the spectrum.<br>
The system comprises for each blade' a memory 10A, 10B, 10C storing a phase factor for the respective blade, an adder 12A, 12B,' 12C, a cosine function unit 14A, 14B, 14C, a-murtiplier 16A, 16B, 16C, an FFT-unit 18ft, 18B, 18C, and a peak detector 20A, 20B, 20C. A difference calculation unit 22 and a difference level integrator 24 are common for all three rotor blades.<br>
The multipliers 12A, 12B, 12C, are each connected to the respective one of the memories 10A, 10B, 1OC for receiving the phase factor stored therein. They are each further connected to the rotor azimuth detector for receiving the detected rotor azimuth angle. In the adders 12A, 12B, 12C the respective phase factor is added to received rotor azimuth angle and the result is output to the cosine function unit, which calculates the cosine of the received sum of rotor azimuth angle and phase factor. The sum is then output to the respective multiplier 16A, 16B, 16C. Each multiplier 16A, 16B, 16C further receives the signal of the accelerometer<br>
located at the nacell of the wind turbine. In the multipliers 16A, 16B, 1-6C the received accelerations are multiplied by the respective cosine output by the cosine function units 14A, 14B, 14C. The multiplication result, which represents a modulation of the sensed signals or vibrations', is then output to the respective FFT-unit 18A, 18B, 18C, where a fast fourier transformation is performed on the modulated signals or vibrations in order to extract each blade frequency.<br>
The result of the fast fourier transformation is then output to the respected peak detector 20A, 20B, 20C where frequency peaks of the frequency spectra output by the FFT-units are dectected and then output to the difference calculation unit 22. In the difference calculation unit the difference between the respective blade frequency and the function depending on the mean values of the other blades is calculated as described above, These differerrce-s- are then input to- the difference level integrator1 and alarm'trigger 24 where' the integration is done as described above and an alarm is triggered when the set crite.ria are reached.<br>
An alternative system for performing method according to the invention is shown on Figure 8/ where the blade frequency is found by using a PLL 21 A (Phase Locked Loop oscillation) on the modulated acceleration signal. In the present embodiment, band pass filters 19A, 19B, 19C are located between the multiplier 16A, 16B, 16C and the PLL 21A, 21B, 21C for filtering the modulated signals before inputting them into the respective PLL.<br>
