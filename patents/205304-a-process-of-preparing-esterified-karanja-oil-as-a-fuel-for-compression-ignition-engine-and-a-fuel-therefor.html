				<td>The present invention relates to an alternate fuel for running the compression ignition engines.<br>
The compression ignition engines are run on diesel and thereby generating carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide among other undesirable gases and particulate matters. This causes pollution in the atmosphere and thus ecological imbalances to a large extent. Rapid increase in the prices of petroleum products, uncertainties of their supply and harmful exhaust emissions have attracted the researchers to go for alternative fuel.<br>
It has therefore been an endeavour of all concerned to look for a equifriendly and an effective petrol/diesel substrate.<br>
Thus an object of the present invention is to meet the challenge and to look for a substitute of diesel.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide a process of esterifying Karanja Oil to produce substitute for diesel.<br>
According to the present invention the process of esterification of Karanja Oil comprises the following steps-<br>
a)	heating Karanja Oil at about 60°C;<br>
b)	adding potassium hydroxide (KOH) and methyl alcohol;<br>
c)	stirring the mixture thoroughly;<br>
d)	separating glycerol from said mixture in a known manner;<br>
e)	washing said mixture with distilled water; and<br>
f)	heating the mixture for removing water.<br>
The process has been standardized in the laboratory.<br>
: 2 :<br><br>
The chemical reaction of the developed process is given hereunder.<br><br>
Karanja oil	Methanol	Karanja methyl ester Glycerol<br>
(Esterification of Karanja Oil )<br>
The amount of KOH and methyl alcohol required, duration of stirring, minimum holding time for separation of glycerol and ester for 1 litre of karanja oil were determined and are summarized in Table 1. The fuel properties of esterified karanja oil as well as its blends with diesel are summarized in Table 2.<br>
Table 1 Standardized processes for esterification of karanja oil.<br><br>
Sl.No.	Process	Quantity<br>
1.	Heating	60°C<br>
2.	KOH addition	13 g<br>
3.	Methyl alcohol addition	270 ml<br>
4.	Stirring at 500 rpm	35 min<br>
5.	Settling time	6 h (minimum)<br>
6.	Washing	Twice<br>
7.	Heating	100°C<br>

The fuel consumption thermal efficiency of the engine, power and torque were determined at different engine speed using the fuel substitute and are shown in the accompanying drawings, wherein —<br>
Fig.1 shows variation of break power with engine speed<br>
Fig.2 shows variation of torque with engine speed<br>
Fig.3 shows variation of brake specific fuel consumption with<br>
engine speed Fig.4 shows variation of brake thermal efficiency with engine<br>
speed Fig.5 shows the variation of CO with engine speed Fig.6 shows the variation of smoke density with engine speed<br>
Further data observed on engine testing is illustrated in Table 3 and the emission data during engine test is tabulated in Table 4 set out hereinbelow.<br>
