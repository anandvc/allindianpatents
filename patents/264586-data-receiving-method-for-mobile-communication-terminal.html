DATA RECEIVING METHOD FOR MOBILE COM-<br>
MUNICATION TERMINAL<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a E-UMTS (Evolved Universal Mobile Telecom-<br>
munications System), and in particular, relates to a data receiving method for a mobile<br>
terminal.<br>
Background Art<br>
To support broadband wireless (e.g., WiMAX) access, there are different types of<br>
broadband wireless air interfaces, such as cellular 3G technologies (e.g., UMTS,<br>
WCDMA, etc.), and multi-carrier based multiple access techniques (e.g., OFDMA,<br>
OFDM-TDMA, OFDM-CDMA, etc.). Frequency division multiplexing involves sub-<br>
channelization, of which at least four types (OFDM, Flash OFDM, sOFDMA and<br>
OFDMA) exist.<br>
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) involves the splitting of a<br>
radio signal into multiple smaller sub-signals that are then transmitted simultaneously<br>
at different frequencies to a receiver. OFDM refers to a form of multi-carrier<br>
transmission where all the sub-carriers are orthogonal to each other. Certain IEEE<br>
standards and 3GPP standards are related to various aspects of OFDM.<br>
Figures 1 and 2 show a typical frame that is used in OFDM. One frame has a time<br>
duration of 10 ms (milliseconds) and consists of 20 sub-frames, each having a time<br>
duration of 0.5 ms. Each sub-frame may consist of a resource block (RB) that contains<br>
data or information, and a cyclic prefix (CP) that is a guard interval needed for con-<br>
ventional OFDM modulation (but not needed for OFDM with pulse shaping, i.e.,<br>
OFDM/OQAM). The sub-frame duration corresponds to the minimum downlink TTI<br>
(Transmission Time Interval).<br>
Figure 3 shows a basic downlink reference-signal structure consisting of known<br>
reference symbols. Namely, a mapping of physical channel symbols in frequency<br>
domain is shown. In other words, channel-coded, interleaved, and data-modulated in-<br>
formation (i.e., Layer 3 information) is mapped onto OFDM time/frequency symbols.<br>
The OFDM symbols can be organized into a number (M) of consecutive sub-carriers<br>
for a number (N) of consecutive OFDM symbols.<br>
Here, it is assumed that 7 OFDM symbols exist per sub-frame (when the CP length<br>
is short). In case of a long CP or a different frame structure, this basic downlink<br>
reference-signal structure would be slightly different.<br>
Reference symbols (i.e., first reference symbols) are located in the first OFDM<br>
symbol of every sub-frame assigned for downlink transmission. This is valid for both<br>
FDD and TDD, as well as for both long and short CP. Additional reference symbols<br>
(i.e., second reference symbols) are located in the third last OFDM symbol of every<br>
sub-frame assigned for downlink transmission. This is the baseline for both FDD and<br>
TDD, as well as for both long and short CP. However, for FDD, an evaluation of<br>
whether the second reference symbols are need should be made.<br>
Figure 4 shows an exemplary network architecture of a E-UMTS (Evolved<br>
Universal Mobile Telecommunications System) applicable to the present invention.<br>
The E-UMTS system is a system that has evolved from the UMTS system, and its<br>
standardization work is currently being performed by the 3GPP standards organization.<br>
As shown in Figure 4, the E-UMTS network is generally comprised of a E-UTRAN<br>
and a core network (CN). The E-UTRAN is comprised of a terminal (i.e., user<br>
equipment: UE) and a base station (i.e., eNode B or eNB), as well as an access<br>
gateway (AG) that is located at an end of the E-UMTS network and connects with one<br>
or more external networks. The AG can be divided into a portion that handles user<br>
traffic and a portion that handles control traffic. In such case, the AG that handles user<br>
traffic and the AG that handles control traffic can communicate with each other via a<br>
newly defined interface. For one eNode B, one or more cells may exist. Between the<br>
eNode Bs, an interface for transmitting user traffic and control traffic may be<br>
employed. The core network (CN) may be comprised of nodes and the like that are<br>
used for registration and other functions for users of the UEs and the AG. Also, an<br>
interface for distinguishing the E-UTRAN and the CN may be employed.<br>
Also, in the E-UMTS network, there may be a control plane server (CPS) that<br>
performs radio (wireless) control functions, a radio resource management (RRM)<br>
entity that performs radio resource management functions, a mobility management<br>
entity (MME) that performs mobility management functions for a mobile terminal.<br>
Here, it can be understood that the particular names of the various network entities are<br>
not limited to those mentioned above.<br>
Figure 5 shows an exemplary architecture (structure) of a radio interface protocol<br>
between a terminal (UE) and a UTRAN (UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network)<br>
that is based upon a 3GPP radio access network standard. The radio interface protocol<br>
of Figure 5 is horizontally comprised of a physical layer, a data link layer, and a<br>
network layer, and vertically comprised of a user plane for transmitting user data and a<br>
control plane for transferring control signaling. The radio interface protocol layer of<br>
Figure 5 may be divided into L1 (Layer 1), L2 (Layer 2), and L3 (Layer 3) based upon<br>
the lower three layers of the Open System Interconnection (OSI) standards model that<br>
is known the field of communication systems.<br>
The physical layer (i.e., Layer 1) uses a physical channel to provide an information<br>
transfer service to a higher layer. The physical layer is connected with a medium<br>
access control (MAC) layer located thereabove via a transport channel, and data is<br>
transferred between the physical layer and the MAC layer via the transport channel.<br>
Also, between respectively different physical layers, namely, between the respective<br>
physical layers of the transmitting side (transmitter) and the receiving side (receiver),<br>
data is transferred via a physical channel.<br>
The physical channel is modulated by OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division<br>
Multiplexing) techniques, employing time and frequency as radio resources.<br>
The MAC layer of Layer 2 provides services to a radio link control (RLC) layer<br>
(which is a higher layer) via a logical channel. The RLC layer of Layer 2 supports the<br>
transmission of data with reliability. It should be noted that if the RLC functions are<br>
implemented in and performed by the MAC layer, the RLC layer itself might not need<br>
to exist. The PDCP layer of Layer 2 performs a header compression function that<br>
reduces unnecessary control information such that data being transmitted by employing<br>
Internet protocol (IP) packets, such as IPv4 or IPv6, can be efficiently sent over a radio<br>
(wireless) interface that has a relatively small bandwidth.<br>
The radio resource control (RRC) layer located at the lowermost portion of Layer 3<br>
is only defined in the control plane, and handles the control of logical channels,<br>
transport channels, and physical channels with respect to the configuration, re-<br>
configuration and release of radio bearers (RB). Here, the RB refers to a service that is<br>
provided by Layer 2 for data transfer between the mobile terminal and the UTRAN.<br>
The NAS (Non-Access Stratum) layer located at a higher level than the RRC layer<br>
performs the functions of session management, mobility management, and the like.<br>
As for channels used in downlink transmission for transmitting data from the<br>
network to the mobile terminal, there is a broadcast channel (BCH) used for<br>
transmitting system information, and a shared channel (SCH) used for transmitting<br>
user traffic or control messages. Accordingly, traffic for a downlink multicast or<br>
broadcast service, or a control message may be transmitted via a downlink SCH, or<br>
may be transmitted via a separate (distinct) downlink MCH (multicast channel).<br>
Also, as for channels used in uplink transmission for transmitting data from the<br>
mobile terminal to the network, there is a random access channel (RACH) used for<br>
transmitting an initial control message, and a shared channel (SCH) used for<br>
transmitting user traffic or control messages.<br>
Additionally, as for logical channels that are located at a higher level than the<br>
transport channels and that are mapped to the transport channels, a BCCH (Broadcast<br>
Channel), PCCH (Paging Control Channel), CCCH (Common Control Channel),<br>
MCCH (Multicast Control Channel), MTCH (Multicast Traffic Channel), and the like<br>
exist.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Technical Problem<br>
In the related art, the SCCH (Shared Control Channel), which is a channel that<br>
transmits control information of the SCH channel, always transports a mobile terminal<br>
(UE) identifier for identifying mobile terminals. Accordingly, when data of a common<br>
channel for multiple mobile terminals is transmitted by the SCH channel, the SCCH<br>
must transmit a plurality of mobile terminal identifiers to be used by multiple mobile<br>
terminals. As such, the large size (or amount) of control information that is transmitted<br>
by the SCCH is problematic.<br>
Also, in the related art, the mobile terminal should receive the SCH channel at each<br>
and every frame. However, because the data that should be read by the mobile terminal<br>
(i.e., the data for that UE itself) is actually transmitted only at particular frames, the<br>
reception of the SCH channel for each frame unnecessarily wastes battery power.<br>
Technical Solution<br>
The present invention has been developed in order to solve the above described<br>
problems of the related art. As a result, the present invention provides a data receiving<br>
method for a mobile terminal that can minimize the size (or amount) of data generated<br>
in the data transmitting and receiving process, and that can minimize the waste of<br>
battery power of the mobile terminal.<br>

Mode for the Invention<br>
One aspect of the present invention is the recognition by the present inventors<br>
regarding the problems and drawbacks of the related art described above and explained<br>
in more detail hereafter. Based upon such recognition, the features of the present<br>
invention have been developed.<br>
The present invention provides a data receiving method for a mobile terminal that<br>
can minimize the size (or amount) of data generated in the data transmitting and<br>
receiving process, which in turn, can minimize the waste of battery power of the<br>
mobile terminal.<br>
The features of the present invention may be implemented in a mobile commu-<br>
nications system, such as UMTS. However, the features of the present invention can<br>
also be implemented in other types of communication systems that operate under<br>
different standards.<br>
It should be noted that the features of the present invention are related to issues<br>
regarding the long-term evolution (LTE) of the 3GPP standard. As such, the 3GPP TS<br>
25.813 (LTE TR) and its related sections or portions thereof, as well as various<br>
developing enhancements thereof pertain to the present invention. Such enhancements<br>
and evolution have resulted in the use of a particular prefix (the letter E) when labeling<br>
various network entities (e.g., eNode B), protocol layers, channels, and the like.<br>
However, it can be clearly understood that such labeling and other terminology are<br>
merely exemplary and thus may be altered (or later clarified) as a result of ongoing or<br>
future discussions.<br>
In order to minimize the size (or amount) of data generated in the data transmitting<br>
and receiving process, and minimize the waste of battery power, the radio (wireless)<br>
network transmits identifier information, which distinguishes whether the data<br>
transmitted on a first channel is UE dedicated channel data or common channel data, to<br>
a terminal (UE) via a second channel. The terminal receives the second channel in a<br>
periodic or non-periodic manner, and if the identifier information received via the<br>
second channel indicates that the data is common channel data, the terminal then<br>
receives the common channel data via the first channel.<br>
The first channel may be a SCH channel and the second channel may be a SCCH<br>
channel that transmits the control information of the SCH channel.<br>
The radio (wireless) network may be an eNode B (eNB), the UE dedicated channel<br>
data may be data of a logical channel DTCH or DCCH, and the common channel data<br>
may be data of a logical channel CCCH or BCCH, MCCH, MTCH, PCCH and the<br>
like.<br>
The identifier information for the common channel data of the SCCH channel may<br>
include logical channel type identifier information that identifies the data as being<br>
related to a logical channel among a CCCH or BCCH, MCCH, MTCH, PCCH.<br>
The radio (wireless) network may transmit period information corresponding to the<br>
logical channel transmitted through the SCH channel or period information cor-<br>
responding to the SCH channel. The terminal may periodically receive the second<br>
channel or the first channel according to the period information received from the radio<br>
network.<br>
Figure 6 is a diagram to explain the features of the present invention by showing<br>
where the control information and resource blocks may be located within each sub-<br>
frame with respect to frequency and time.<br>
The structure (format) of a sub-frame in relation to the frequency domain and the<br>
time domain can be understood from Figure 6. Namely, a single sub-frame has a time<br>
duration of 0.5 ms with 7 OFDM symbols (portions) therein.<br>
In the first portion of the sub-frame, control information (i.e., L1/L2 control in-<br>
formation, FCCH, SCCH, etc.) is included, while resource blocks (RBs) that may be in<br>
the form of one or more chunks may be located in the remaining portion of the sub-<br>
frame. Here, a resource block may occupy the entire time duration of the sub-frame<br>
(excluding the time duration for the control information) or some partial time duration<br>
thereof. Also, each resource block (RB) may use a particular frequency range (i.e., a<br>
particular number of sub-carriers).<br>
The frequency axis can be referred to as a scalable cell bandwidth, which typically<br>
has a frequency range of 1.25 - 20 MHz. A plurality of sub-carriers exists in the<br>
scalable cell bandwidth. Of this frequency range, a so-called center frequency (of ap-<br>
proximately 10 MHz) is mainly used in transmitting system information.<br>
In the related art, such system information is considered to be fixed. Although this<br>
allows the terminal to easily read the system information, addition of new system in-<br>
formation is not possible. In contrast, the present invention allows for at least part of<br>
the system information to be flexible (or dynamic).<br>
To do so, the present invention divides (or separates or distinguishes) the system in-<br>
formation into primary system information (e.g., Master Information Block: MIB) and<br>
non-primary (or secondary) system information (e.g., System Information Block: SIB).<br>
The MIB is transmitted in a static manner (e.g., via a BCH for fixed manner<br>
transmission), while the SIB is transmitted in a dynamic manner (e.g., via a downlink<br>
SCH for dynamic manner transmission). Here, transmission in a dynamic manner<br>
means that different frequency ranges and time durations can be used.<br>
For each frame, the MIB contains information about where each SIB is located.<br>
Namely, the particular frequency range and particular time duration for each SIB is<br>
specified to allow the terminal (UE) to properly read the appropriate SIBs.<br>
In a similar manner, for each sub-frame within one frame, the control information<br>
(located in the first portion) contains information about where each resource block<br>
(RB) is located. Namely, the frequency range and particular time duration for each RB<br>
is specified to allow the terminal (UE) to properly read the appropriate RBs.<br>
The above concepts generally depicted in Figure 6 will be explained in more detail<br>
in the following description with reference to Figure 7.<br>
Figure 7 shows an exemplary embodiment of a data reception method for a mobile<br>
communication terminal according to the present invention.<br>
Referring to Figure 7, each SCCH channel (i.e., control information in the form of<br>
SCCH1, SCCH2, SCCH3, SCCH4) may be transmitted using a respectively different<br>
frequency and time from that of the SCH, and is transmitted once per each sub-frame.<br>
One sub-frame may be 0.5 ms in duration and each SCCH channel is transmitted by<br>
using one or two symbols that constitute the corresponding sub-frame. A single sub-<br>
frame consists of 6 or 7 symbols, and respectively different symbols constitute re-<br>
spectively different time periods (durations).<br>
Here, it should be noted that multiple SCCH channels may be required for various<br>
reasons. For example, different types of traffic may only need to be sent periodically.<br>
Also, the limits on the capability of the mobile terminal (UE) may only allow a certain<br>
type of data (or information) to be sent in certain periods. As such, the terminal (UE)<br>
need not read each and every sub-frame.<br>
In Figure 7, the SCCH channel (e.g., SCCH1, SCCH2, SCCH3, SCCH4) that is<br>
transmitted in a single sub-frame, transmits control information related to a SCH<br>
channel (e.g., SCH1, SCH2, SCH3, SCH4) of the corresponding sub-frame. The<br>
control information transmitted through one SCCH channel may comprise a mobile<br>
terminal identifier (identity), a multicast service identifier (identity), and a logical<br>
channel identifier (identity). The logical channel identifier may inform whether the<br>
data transmitted in a sub-frame of the corresponding SCH channel is data for a mobile<br>
terminal dedicated channel (e.g., DCCH or DTCH) or data for a common channel. In<br>
particular, if the data is for a common channel, the logical channel identifier informs<br>
about the type of common channel (i.e., BCCH, PCCH, MCCH, MTCH, or CCCH).<br>
The mobile terminal may receive different SCCH channels in a periodic manner,<br>
each having a respective period (e.g., every four sub-frames). To do so, the base station<br>
(eNode B) transmits period information to the mobile terminal. Then, the mobile<br>
terminal may receive the sub-frames of each SCCH channel in a periodic manner<br>
according to the period information provided from the base station.<br>
The mobile terminal obtains the logical channel identifier through the received<br>
SCCH channel, and by means of the obtained logical channel identifier, the mobile<br>
terminal can determine whether the data transmitted via the SCH channel is data for a<br>
dedicated channel or data for one of a BCCH, PCCH, MCCH, MTCH or CCCH (i.e., a<br>
common channel).<br>
If the logical channel identifier indicates a common channel, the mobile terminal<br>
receives the sub-frame of the corresponding SCH channel to thus receive the data of<br>
the common channel.<br>
Thus, according to the control of the radio network, the terminal (UE) periodically<br>
receives the SCCH1 or one among the SCCH2, SCCH3, and SCCH4. Thus, the eNode<br>
B can designate the specific SCCH channel that a particular terminal (UE) should<br>
receive.<br>
In Figure 7, the sub-frame of the SCCH channel and the sub-frame of the SCH<br>
channel that is mapped to the sub-frame of the SCCH channel are not the same, and<br>
there is a difference of one sub-frame therebetween. Accordingly, for example, for a<br>
terminal (UE) that periodically receives the SCCH2 channel, if a UE identifier<br>
(mapped to the sub-frame of the SCCH2 channel) is transmitted or if desired (or<br>
interested) information is transmitted, then a sub-frame of the SCH2 channel (that is<br>
transmitted one sub-frame after the sub-frame of the SCCH2 channel) is received. In<br>
other words, referring to Figure 7, for a UE that periodically receives SCCH2, if the in-<br>
formation in SCCH2 of sub-frame #2 indicates that certain information in SCH2<br>
should be read, then the SCH2 of sub-frame #3 is read by that UE.<br>
It should be noted that information in a particular SCCH (i.e., control information)<br>
need not refer to only its corresponding sub-frame that is located one subsequent sub-<br>
frame thereafter. In other words, the information in a particular SCCH may provide in-<br>
formation (i.e. resource block location based on time and frequency characteristics)<br>
about a sub-frame to be read at two or more sub-frames later. This may be necessary<br>
for various reasons, such as if the size of amount of data to be read is relatively large,<br>
when persistent scheduling is performed, or the like.<br>
As a result of the present invention, the radio (wireless) network transmits identifier<br>
information, which distinguishes whether the data transmitted on a first channel is UE<br>
dedicated channel data or common channel data, to a terminal (UE) via a second<br>
channel. The terminal receives the second channel in a periodic or non-periodic<br>
manner, and if the identifier information received via the second channel indicates that<br>
the data is common channel data, the terminal then receives the common channel data<br>
via the first channel. By using such procedures, the size (or amount) of data generated<br>
in the data transmitting and receiving process is minimize, and battery power<br>
consumption is minimal.<br>
It should be noted that the SCCH may also be described in different terms. Namely,<br>
the control information transmitted by the network may be called L1/L2 control in-<br>
formation, FCCH, SCCH, or the like.<br>
The present disclosure provides a method of receiving control information by a<br>
terminal in a mobile communications system having a single control channel and a<br>
plurality of common channels and having a network that periodically transmits the<br>
control information via the control channel, the method comprising: periodically<br>
receiving the control channel; detecting, at a particular time, an identifier from the<br>
received control channel; and receiving data via a particular common channel that is<br>
indicated by control information that includes the detected identifier.<br>
Also, the present disclosure provides a method of transmitting control information<br>
by a network to a terminal in a mobile communications system having a single control<br>
channel and a plurality of common channels, the method comprising: periodically<br>
transmitting the control channel; and transmitting data via a particular common<br>
channel that is indicated by control information that includes an identifier detected, at a<br>
particular time, by the terminal from the control channel.<br>
The identifier may be a terminal identifier for the terminal itself or is a common<br>
channel identifier. The at least one of the common channels may be a CCCH, a BCCH,<br>
a MCCH, a MTCH or a PCCH. The control information may be received via the<br>
control channel. The control information and data may be received (transmitted) in the<br>
same sub-frame. The control information and data may be received (transmitted) in<br>
different sub-frames. The control information may indicate time and frequency in-<br>
formation for the data in the same sub-frame or a different subsequent sub-frame. The<br>
control information may comprise at least one of SCCH, FCCH, and L1/L2 control in-<br>
formation. The control information may indicate at least one of a frequency parameter,<br>
