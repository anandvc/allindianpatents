				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of mixture of alkyl phenols. More particularly it relates to the process for the preparation of o-cresol and 2,6 xylenol by alkylation of phenol with methanol using boron oxide - zirconium oxide catalyst,/<br>
Alkyl phenols are industrially important chemical intermediates in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, resins, various additives, polymerization inhibitors, antioxidants and various other chemicals. Especially, ortho alkylated phenols, o-cresol and 2,6 xylenol and trialkyl substituted phenols are industrially important alkyl phenols.<br>
In the prior art, the catalysts used for alkylation of the phenol are ranging from zeolites to metal oxides. Reference may be made to U.S. Pat. No. 437174 wherein a process for the alkylation of phenols is described using a Y zeolite to both cresols and xylenols but no selectivity for 2,6 Xylenol.<br>
US pat. No.20010005769 describes a process for the alkylation of phenols using ortho selective cobalt/nickel ferrite catalyst with 75% conversion of phenol and 60% selectivity for 2,6 xylenol.<br>
European Pat. No. 1148040A1 describes a method for ortho-alkyaled phenols by reacting phenols with monohydric alcohol in presence of germanium oxide under conditions in which said alcohol is in supercritical condition.<br>
Most of these reported processes have the drawbacks such as; non selective catalysts for o-cresol or 2,6 xylenol, involves very critical control of catalyst structure and composition, low conversion of phenols and low conversion of alcohol to alkylated products producing large quantities of waste gases.<br>
 It is therefore desirable to provide a process for the preparation of o-cresol and<br>
2,6 xylenol using ortho selective catalyst which is comparatively easy to prepare,<br>
produces negligible quantities of p-cresol and removes the drawbacks of the<br>
earlier processes. The inventors of the present invention have observed that the<br>
use of boron oxide - zirconium oxide catalyst provided by the present invention<br>
removes the above mentioned drawbacks.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for the<br>
preparation of mixture of alkyl phenols.  More particularly it relates to the process<br>
for the preparation of o-cresol and 2,6 xylenol using boron oxide - zirconium<br>
oxide catalyst which obviates the above mentioned drawbacks.<br>
Another object is to provide a process for the said improved catalyst that gives<br>
high conversion and higher selectivity to o-cresol and 2,6 xylenol with negligible<br>
deactivation rate.<br>
Another object is to provide a process for the preparation of improved catalyst,<br>
which need not be prepared in situ and is easily prepared outside.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of   a<br>
mixture of alkyl  phenols which  comprises;  contacting  catalyst with  a feed<br>
consisting of an alcohol and a phenolic compound at weight hourly space velocity<br>
of   1 to 4 at a temperature ranging between 300 - 450°C, at an atmospheric<br>
pressure and collecting the mixture of alkyl phenols, o-cresol and 2,6 xylenol at -<br>
5°C to +5°C.<br>
In another embodiment the alcohol used may be lower alcohol such as methanol<br>
or any other methylating agent such as dimethyl carbonate.<br>
In yet another embodiment the phenolic compound used can be phenol, methoxy phenol, o-cresol or methyl methoxy phenol.<br><br><br>
In another embodiment the ratio of alcohol to phenolic compound may vary from<br>
1:1 to 10:1 (mol/mol).<br>
In still another embodiment the space velocity of the reaction mixture may vary<br>
from 1 to 4. WHSV (weight hourly space velocity expressed as grams of feed per<br>
gram of catalyst per hour).<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the catalyst used has general<br>
formula<br>
X B2O3: 1-x Zr02, where x may vary from 0.01 to 0.3 and characterized by XRD<br>
pattern showing amorphous or crystalline nature having surface area of 50 to 150<br>
sq. m/g.<br>
In still another embodiment, the catalyst used is B203 - Zr02, wherein selectivity<br>
of ortho methylated products is not less than 60% and conversion of phenol is<br>
not less than 75%.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the catalyst is prepared as<br>
per the procedure which comprises preparing the solution of source of Zirconium<br>
and  hydrolyzing  with  liquid  ammonia,  drying  it at  100-300°C,  adding  this<br>
powdered form to a solution of source of boron under stirring, drying the resultant<br>
slurry and calcining it to suitable temperature, ranging from 500 to 750°C for 12<br>
to 36 hours.<br>
The process of the present invention is described herein below with reference to<br>
the following examples, which are illustrative only and should not be construed to<br>
limit the scope of the present invention in any manner.<br>
The process of preparation of catalyst has been claimed in our co-pending<br>
application no. 0309/del/2003.<br>
Example 1 <br>
B2O3 - ZrO2 catalyst used in the present invention was prepared as follows:<br><br><br><br><br>
39.7 g of zirconyl oxychloride [ZrOCl2, 8 H2O] was dissolved in 110 ml distilled water and aqueous ammonia (25%) was added to it drop wise with constant stirring till the solution became alkaline (pH=10). The resultant solution was filtered and washed with hot distilled water till free from chloride ions. The residue was dried overnight at 85 °C in an oven.<br>
0.79 g boric acid [HjBOs] was dissolved in 150 ml distilled water. The zirconium hydroxide obtained above was added to the boric acid solution with stirring to obtain slurry. It was air-dried, heated in an oven at 110°C for 5h and calcined overnight at 650°C.<br>
The molar composition of the catalyst was 0.05 8203 : 0.95 ZrO2. Molar composition of the x 8263: 1-x ZrO2 catalyst was varied where x = 0.01 - 0.3. The catalyst was molded in the form of a pellet, which is granulated to -10 to +20 mesh size for its use in alkylation reaction.<br>
Examples 2-6 illustrate the process with various catalysts prepared as per example 1.<br>

Reaction conditions were as follows.<br>
Activation of catalyst= Air/500°C/12h Reaction temperature = 400°C<br><br>
