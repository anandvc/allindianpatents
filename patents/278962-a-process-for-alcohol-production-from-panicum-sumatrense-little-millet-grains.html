				<td>TITLE:   A   PROCESS   FOR  ALCOHOL   PRODUCTION   FROM   PANICUM<br>
SUMATRENSE (LITTLE MILLET) GRAINS CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
<br>
The present application claims priority to Indian Provisional Patent Application<br>
No. 389/CHE/2010, filed Feb. 15, 2010, which is incorporated by reference<br>
herein.<br>
<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
<br>
The invention relates ethanol production, more particularly method for the<br>
production of ethanol from little millet which is rich in carbohydrate and fiber<br>
using yeast under anaerobic condition. The plant is drought tolerant and adapted<br>
to acidic soils.<br>
<br>
BACKROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
<br>
Ethanol, unlike the fossil fuels, is a safe and environment-friendly energy carrier and therefore the importance of ethanol as the fuel for internal combustion engines has, of late, increased considerably. At present, commercial production of ethanol relies on the fermentation of sugars by microorganisms. There is growing need for the industry to improve the technology and expand production due to the ruling high oil prices, environmental pressures and the expected fossil oil crisis as well as the relatively high cost of fuel alcohol. Sugars can be fermented directly to ethanol, while complex carbohydrates like starch and cellulose must be broken down first to simple sugars before the fermentation. There are two important process involved in the break down technology. They are hydrolysis and pretreatment. Hydrolysis is generally carried out by two different treatments like chemical and enzymatic. A number of chemical are used/tried by wide group of people. But the optimum concentration and conditions are substrate specific. The main interest of hydrolysis process is to obtain maximum fermentable sugars. In case of enzymatic hydrolysis the substrate needs pretreatment because of the complexity of substrate. Unlike hydrolysis the main concept of pretreatment is to remove /reduce the rigidity of complex substrate here the sugar production is not in concern. Dilute acid hydrolysis is probably the most commonly applied method among the chemical hydrolysis methods.<br>
<br>
Starch is water-insoluble polymer and a major component of agricultural crops. It is widely distributed in the vegetable kingdom and is stored in all grains and tubers. A typical starch molecule is constructed from a-1,4 and a -1,6 glucosidic bonds, each of which links two dehydrated glucose molecules. These molecules form either unbranched or somewhat branched polymer chains with up to 360 or 1000 glucose units, respectively.<br>
<br>
Very few studies have reported ethanol production from millet. Wu and co-worker, Cereal chemistry, 83, (2006), 127-131 have disclosed that millet grains might be a useful feedstock for ethanol production. Four pearl millet genotypes were tested for their potential as raw material for fuel ethanol production in this study. Ethanol fermentation was performed by using Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ATCC 24860). The final ethanol yields ranged from 8.7% to 16.8% (v/v) at dry mass concentrations of 20 to 35%, and the ethanol fermentation efficiencies were between 90.0% and 95.6%. Results showed that the fermentation efficiencies of pearl millets, on a starch basis, were comparable to those of corn and grain sorghum. Because pearl millets have greater protein and lipid contents, distillers' dried grains with solubles (DDGS) from pearl millets also had greater protein content and energy levels than did DDGS from corn and grain sorghum. He also disclosed that pearl millets could be a potential feedstock for fuel ethanol production in areas too dry to grow corn and grain sorghum. The economic feasibility of using peart millet as a feedstock was compared to maize. The author disclosed the comparison on the following aspects, (i) they are composition of raw material (protein, fat, crude fiber, ash and moisture), (ii) cost of electricity to grind. Value of DDGS of pearl millet was high ($0.11/Kg) when compared with DDGS of maize ($0.07/Kg) due to its high protein content. Total profit from pearl millet as the sole feedstock was $25,175,000 per year compared to $23,758,000 for maize feed stocks. Wilson et al., Issues in new crops and new uses, (2007), 56-59 disclosed the maize as a feedstock for ethanol production.<br>
<br>
Panicum sumatrense, one of the minor millets belongs to the family Poaceae, is commonly known as little millet in English and in other local names as follows: Tamil-samai, Kannada-shame, Malayalam-shama, Telugu-samalu, save, Hindi-shavan, kungu, kutki, Bengali-gundli, gondola, Marathi-sava, Gujarathi-gadro, Oriya-suniva. It is a coarse perennial grass, with a thick creeping rootstock. It grows usually in clumps, in bushes and grazed by cattle only when quite young. When it grows old it gets hard and woody and acquires a bitter or salty taste. It is distributed mainly in the tropical and warm temperate parts of the world. Little millet grains are used as a food in India but in other countries, it is used as a fodder crop. In India it is cultivated as a sole crop or subsidiary crop mixed with other millets like Sorghum bicolor, Paspalum sp. and Eleusine sp. or pulses like horse gram, or with oil seeds like gingelli, castor and mustard. Till Green Revolution more people used little millet as staple food. Nowadays its usage as food has decreased. Obviously the cultivation of the millet has also simultaneously decreased. But it is a good source of starch and the plant is drought tolerant and adapted to acidic soils.<br>
<br>
Whole grains from this plant contains 11.0% moisture, 7.2 % protein, 4.9 % fat, 63.8% carbohydrates, 9.6 % fiber, 3.5% mineral matter, 0.024% calcium, 0.32 % phosphorous, 0.007% iron, and 0.00034 % thiamine. Husked grains contain 11.0% moisture, 7.1% protein, 2.1% fat, 77.4% carbohydrates, 0.7% fiber, 1.7% mineral matter, 0.019 calcium, 0.16 % phosphorous, 0.003% iron, and 0.00034% thiamine. In addition, millet contains essential amino acids like arginine 4.66%, histidine 1.87%, isoleucine 6.66%, leucine 10.80%, lysine 1.83%, methionine 2.27%, phenylalanine 4.76%, threonine 3.40%, tryptophane 0.56%, and valine 6.06 % of total nitrogen. Fresh leaves of the plant contain 18.50mg/100g of carotene.<br>
<br>
The grains of P. sumatrense, with 77% carbohydrate have not been tested for alcohol production till now. Hence this can be used as a substrate for ethanol production.<br>
<br>
Therefore it is an embodiment of the present invention is to provide a process for producing ethanol from organic feedstock, particularly little millet.<br>
 <br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is to provide a process for<br>
producing ethanol from little millet using dilute sulphuric acid to convert starch<br>
into fermentable sugars, which is then fermented with reference strain and<br>

<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is to find the effect of nitrogen<br>
source like urea in the fermentation process and ethanol production.<br>
<br>
Yet another embodiment of the present invention is to provide an industrially<br>
feasible, less energy utilizing and economical process for producing ethanol from<br>
little millet.<br>
<br>
Still another embodiment of the present invention is to provide a method for<br>
producing ethanol from little millet wherein the said method consumes very less<br>
energy during conversion of sugars.<br>

<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
<br>
Acid hydrolysis of little millet<br>
<br>
Incubation at varying conditions<br>
<br>
The organic feedstock optionally milled was used for further studies. One part of<br>
organic feedstock treated with  5-10  parts of mineral  acid  at different<br>
concentrations (1 - 25) under pressurized (15 lb) at different temperature (80 -<br>
130 degree C) for 1-50 minutes. The hydrolysate optionally separated by used<br>
centrifugation force at 10,000 rpm for 5-20 min.  The hydrolysate was<br>
neutralized with alkali and determined for sugars. The most important results of<br>
the hydrolysis were summarized in Figure 1.<br>
<br>
The results indicate that the initiation of maximum sugar release occurred in 2<br>
concentration mineral acid and it reduced dramatically in all other concentrations<br>
of H2S04. Since maximum initiation of sugar release has occurred in even diluted<br>
concentrations H2SO4, and it was also recommended that use of dilute acid for<br>
pretreatment would not have any post production problems in the form of acid<br>
disposal.<br>
<br>
The hydrolysate product was collected by centrifugation force, neutralized with<br>
alkali and estimated for reducing sugars. The resulting hydrolyzed fractions from dry grain are then subjected to fermentation as described below. The hydrolyzed product was found to be maximum 77.15 percentages. The hydrolyzed aqueous material was fermented by both reference strain and isolated yeast under anaerobic condition.<br>

<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
<br>
Seed culture and inoculum preparation<br>
<br>
Yeast strains Saccharomyces cerevisiae (MTCC 170) and Issatchenkia orientalis (MTCC 10641) were used for the present invention. Seed cultures were prepared by inoculating a large single colony into liquid glucose yeast extract malt medium under agitation (125 rpm) at 30 ± 2 degree C for 18 h.<br>
 <br>
Preparation of acid hydrolysates 100 parts of organic feedstock was used for the preparation of hydrolysates. 2 concentration of sulphuric acid and little millet were mixed and the substrate mixtures were hydrolysed under pressurized temperature at 80-130 degree C and 15 lb pressure with a residence time of 5-20 min. The hydrolysates were filtered using a nylon filter and neutralized to pH 5.0-5.5 with sodium hydroxide. The amount of fermentable sugars produced during hydrolyses of substrates were estimated.<br>
<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
<br>
Ethanol Production from hydrolyzed organic feedstocks of little millet The resulted hydrolysate was taken in a pre-sterilized container. 10 parts of the mother culture was inoculated and fermented, at 25 - 32 degree C 240 hrs. The sample was taken to analyze the production of ethanol.<br>
<br>
In the process, the ethanol production was preceded by reacting the samples with optimized concentrations of mineral acid. Two different reference and isolate yeast strains were used as fermenting microorganisms for conversion of organic feedstock hydrolyzed product to ethanol. The final ethanol yield from separate hydrolysis and fermentation is 30.53g / 100g (w/w) of organic feedstock at solid basis and with urea supplementation 37.5g / 100g (w/w) of organic feedstock at solid basis. Ethanol fermentation efficiencies were between 79.15 percentage and 97.21 percentage.<br>
<br>
In this invention, grain based ethanol production was studied to decide the various parameters essential for maximum ethanol recovery. The time for maximum ethanol production was also reduced in urea supplementation from 96 hrs to 72 hrs in little millet hydrolysate in SHF. EXAMPLE 3<br>
<br>
In the present invention, the pH of the urea supplement fermented aqueous material was found to regularly reduce from 5.0 to 3.5 and it was found reduced more to 2.95 in the lack of urea. The yeast growth also regularly increased initially and decreased in the later part of the process. The yeast cell number was high (25 log 5) in urea supplemented fermented broth (Figure. 2). From the results, it can be concluded that urea supplemented broth supports the growth of yeast cells and their fermentation ability.<br>
<br>
In the present study the dry milled little millet samples were used for ethanol production. The first step was the hydrolysis of the little millet to release maximum amount of sugars. This was done using physical, chemical and thermal reactions in the occurrence of dilute sulphuric acid. <br>
<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
<br>
To evaluate the competence of the isolate used in this invention, the aqueous material after hydrolysis were concurrently fermented using Saccharomyces cerevisiae (MTCC 170) a reference strain procured from Microbial Type Culture Collection, Institute of Microbial Technology, Chandigarh, India. The ethanol yield from little millet grains hydrolysate was 25.26g / 100g (Figure. 3). Maximum ethanol production was noticed on day 2 in little millet hydrolysate. The ethanol yield was comparably higher in the native isolate, /. orientalis (MTCC 10641) based fermentation than S. cerevisiae (MTCC 170) based fermentation.<br>
 <br>
The pH was found to regularly reduce from 5.0 to 4.75 in the fermented broth.<br>
<br>
Though there was no drastic reduction in the pH of the fermented aqueous<br>
material, a gradual drop in the same was observed over a period of incubation.<br>
<br>
The yeast cell number was maximum (14 log 5) in the same (Figure. 3C).<br>
