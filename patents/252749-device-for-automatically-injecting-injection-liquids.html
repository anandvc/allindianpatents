				<td>Device for automatically injecting injection liquids<br>
The invention relates to a device for automatically injecting<br>
injection liquids, including an axially subdivided housing whose<br>
parts are connectable with each other, wherein an axially<br>
displaceable pressure pin is guided in a first housing part,<br>
which pin is capable of being inserted against a force<br>
accumulator and locked in the inserted position and extended<br>
upon relief of the force accumulator, and an injection needle<br>
fixed in a needle guide and an ampoule are mounted in a second<br>
housing part so as to be axially displaceable relative to each<br>
other, wherein the injection needle on its side facing the<br>
ampoule is designed as a perforation piece for the ampoule.<br>
Devices of the initially defined kind have become known under<br>
the name of autoinjector. The known devices are instruments<br>
which facilitate the injection of an emergency drug into the<br>
body in case of emergency. Autoinjectors are, for instance, used<br>
in allergic emergencies, e.g. after insect bites, snake bites<br>
etc., yet also in the military field, for instance, in order to<br>
quickly counteract intoxications by chemical warfare agents. The<br>
known devices in most cases are devised as disposable devices<br>
and, therefore, disposed of after one-time use.<br>
From AT 303 251, an injection device is known, which comprises<br>
two housing parts capable of being screwed one into the other,<br>
an activator containing a spring-loadable pressure pin, and an<br>
injector containing the ampoule and the injection needle as an<br>
inseparable unit. After having been unlocked, the spring-loaded<br>
pressure pin exerts a force on the piston plug of the ampoule,<br>
whereupon the ampoule is, at first, displaced along with the<br>
injection needle in the axial direction within the injector<br>
housing so that the injection needle penetrates into the<br>
patient's body and the liquid contained in the ampoule is<br><br>
subsequently set under such a high pressure that a sealing<br>
membrane provided between the ampoule and the injection needle<br>
will break, thus causing the liquid to be ejected. That known<br>
configuration, however, involves the drawback that the broken<br>
membrane may obstruct the injection needle, thus preventing the<br>
rapid ejection of the injection liquid.<br>
From WO 01/07104, an advanced injection device has already<br>
become known, in which the ampoule and the injection needle are<br>
arranged within the housing so as to be relatively displaceable<br>
in the axial direction, and the injection needle end facing the<br>
ampoule is designed as a perforation piece for the ampoule. The<br>
ampoule is, in fact, mounted in the interior of the housing<br>
without being firmly connected with the injection needle. It is<br>
only during application that the ampoule is displaced in the<br>
direction of the injection needle under the force of the<br>
pressure pin extending upon relief of the force accumulator and<br>
pierced by the injection needle end designed as a perforation<br>
piece.<br>
The previously known autoinjectors, however, are only<br>
insufficiently able to meet the recent demands as are prescribed<br>
for use in the military field. Autoinjectors that are to be<br>
suitable for military purposes must, in fact, safeguard a<br>
longer-than-average storability and sterility of the respective<br>
injection devices and be designed extremely robust. On a trial<br>
basis, autoinjectors for military purposes are, for instance,<br>
dropped on a stone floor from a height of two meters in order to<br>
check whether the ampoule has broken or whether the mechanical<br>
impact has caused slipping of the ampoule and/or injection<br>
needle in a manner that the sealing disc of the ampoule is<br>
pierced by the injection needle. Similar tests are also carried<br>
out under extreme temperature conditions.<br><br>
The invention aims to provide a device of the initially defined<br>
kind, which complies with the demands set out above for use in<br>
the military field in a satisfactory manner. To solve this<br>
object, the device according to the invention essentially<br>
consists in that the ampoule with its end facing the injection<br>
needle is mounted to reach into a sleeve fixed within the second<br>
housing part and whose inner diameter substantially corresponds<br>
to the outer diameter of the ampoule, that radially inwardly<br>
protruding projections are formed on the inner periphery of the<br>
sleeve, and that the sleeve comprises locking members<br>
cooperating with locking members of the needle guide, whereby an<br>
axial displacement of the ampoule in the direction to the needle<br>
guide while overcoming the displacement resistance exerted by<br>
the projections causes the release of the locking members and<br>
the axial displaceability of the needle guide. By the ampoule<br>
with its end facing the injection needle being mounted so as to<br>
reach into a sleeve fixed within the second housing part, the<br>
radially inwardly protruding projections provided on the inner<br>
periphery of the sleeve and defining a smaller diameter than the<br>
ampoule are able to prevent the ampoule from slipping in the<br>
direction to the injection needle. The energy set free by an<br>
impact or other mechanical action at worst is absorbed by the<br>
inwardly protruding projections while expanding the wall of the<br>
sleeve. After a short displacement, the ampoule will, thus, be<br>
stuck between the inwardly protruding projections with any<br>
further displacement being prevented.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the sleeve is equipped with<br>
locking members which cooperate with respective locking members<br>
of the needle guide such that the needle guide too, along with<br>
the injection needle fixed therein, will be secured against<br>
axial displacement. Both the ampoule reaching into the sleeve<br>
and the needle guide connected with the sleeve are, hence,<br>
coupled to the sleeve, with the sleeve being, in turn, immovably<br><br>
retained in the second housing part, to which end the end-side<br>
annular sleeve surface facing the needle guide preferably rests<br>
on a radially inwardly protruding projection of the second<br>
housing part. This is to ensure that the ampoule or the needle<br>
guide will not be detached, and the injection needle will be<br>
unable to emerge from the injector housing, even if the<br>
injection device falls from an extreme height on hard ground.<br>
To activate the injection device, it is provided according to<br>
the invention that an axial displacement of the ampoule in the<br>
direction to the needle guide while overcoming the displacement<br>
resistance exerted by the projections causes the release of the<br>
locking members and the axial displaceability of the needle<br>
guide. Thereby, the locking members will only be released if the<br>
ampoule in the injector housing is pushed towards the injection<br>
needle by the spring force of the unlocked pressure pin, whereby<br>
such high forces are released that the displacement resistance<br>
exerted on the ampoule by the projections of the sleeve will be<br>
overcome. The release of the locking members fixing the needle<br>
guide may advantageously be effected in that the locking members<br>
of the sleeve are formed on arms capable of excursing outwardly<br>
in a resilient manner, said arms each carrying an inwardly<br>
protruding projection in the region of their coupling site,<br>
which cooperates with the ampoule under the excursion of the<br>
arms and release of the locking members. In this case, the<br>
locking members may be comprised of snap-in noses engaging in<br>
reception openings. An axial displacement of the ampoule, thus,<br>
causes the ampoule to run up inwardly protruding projections<br>
formed on outwardly resilient arms in a manner that further<br>
axial displacement causes an excursion of the arms and the<br>
locking members formed on said arms to disengage and release the<br>
needle guide.<br><br><br>
After having released the needle guide, the ampoule is able to<br>
pass through the sleeve unhampered and approach the injection<br>
needle end designed as a perforation piece. In order to cushion<br>
the hard impact of the ampoule on the injection needle to be<br>
expected subsequently, a spring element acting in the axial<br>
direction is preferably arranged between the needle guide and<br>
the ampoule. The spring action causes the absorption of the<br>
impact energy, thus preventing a possible fracture of the glass<br>
ampoule. The spring element may be designed in one piece with<br>
the needle guide, as a spring basket compressible in the axial<br>
direction such that the spring basket can be additionally used<br>
as a spacer in order to prevent the ampoule from striking<br>
against the bottom of the needle guide. The ampoule will<br>
consequently reach its end position closely in front of the<br>
bottom of the needle guide, whereby a rupture of the ampoule<br>
head will be safely prevented.<br>
In order to prevent the injection liquid from escaping<br>
prematurely, the configuration is advantageously further<br>
developed such that the injection needle includes a radial<br>
passage opening at an axial distance from its end designed as a<br>
perforation piece for the ampoule. The channel of the injection<br>
needle, thus, will not enter into fluid connection with the<br>
injection liquid immediately upon piercing of the ampoule, but<br>
only after a further axial displacement which causes the radial<br>
passage opening of the injection needle to reach into the<br>
ampoule. In order to ensure that the injection liquid be pressed<br>
into the injection needle through the radial passage opening<br>
rather than emerging around the injection needle laterally from<br>
the pierced rubber sealing disc or the ampoule head, the<br>
configuration is preferably further developed such that the<br>
radial passage opening in the axial direction is arranged<br>
between the injection needle end designed as a perforation piece<br>
and an annular web arranged on the needle guide and surrounding<br><br>
the injection needle, said annular web defining a closed annular<br>
space between the web and the injection needle reaching into the<br>
ampoule.<br>
In order to enhance the security against fracture of the<br>
ampoule, which is mostly made of glass, the configuration is<br>
preferably further developed such that the ampoule with its end<br>
facing away from the injection needle is arranged to reach into<br>
a sleeve-shaped ampoule socket which comprises a plurality of<br>
lamellar guide ribs extending in the longitudinal direction. In<br>
this case, the ampoule is positioned centrally within the<br>
sleeve-shaped ampoule socket. The elastic guide ribs of the<br>
ampoule socket protect the glass ampoule from fracture, since<br>
the vibrations acting on the injection device from outside are<br>
to the major extent absorbed by the guide ribs rather than<br>
transmitted to the ampoule. It is, thus, safeguarded that the<br>
glass ampoule is mounted in a fracture-proof manner even under<br>
heavy vibrations.<br>
In order to ensure the reguired sterility, the ampoule reception<br>
opening facing the first housing part including the pressure pin<br>
is advantageously closed by a gas-permeable sealing foil. This<br>
gas-permeable sealing foil enables the interior of the fully<br>
equipped, bilaterally closed injection part to be sterilized by<br>
the aid of a gas so as to guarantee the sterility of the<br>
injection part over years. To provide complete tightness, a seal<br>
and, in particular, an O-ring seal may be arranged between the<br>
outer periphery of the ampoule socket and the inner periphery of<br>
the second housing part.<br>
In the following, the invention will be explained in more detail<br>
by way of an exemplary embodiment schematically illustrated in<br>
the drawing. Therein:<br><br>

part;<br>

Fig. 4 is partially sectioned partial illustration of the<br>
injector unit;<br>
Fig. 5 is an exploded view of the injector part;<br>
Fig. 6 shows a modified configuration of the injector part; and<br>
Figs. 7a to 7h illustrate the operation seguence of the device<br>
according to the invention.<br>
Fig. 1 depicts an injection device 1 whose housing is subdivided<br>
in the axial direction. The first housing part 2 encloses the<br>
activator part and the second housing part 3 encloses the<br>
injection part of the device according to the invention, the two<br>
housing parts being connectable by means of a thread 4. The<br>
activator part, which is illustrated in more detail in Fig. 2,<br>
comprises a pressure pin 5 that is axially displaceable within<br>
the housing 2 and insertable against a spring 6. The pressure<br>
pin 5 comprises inwardly resilient snap-in projections 7 forming<br>
the conical termination of the pressure pin 5. In the locked<br>
position, a pin 9 of a cap 8 keeps the snap-in projections 7 in<br>
a radially outwardly excursed position such that the snap-in<br>
connections 7 overlap the annular part 10. Upon removal of the<br>
cap 8, the activator part can be triggered by actuating the<br>
safety sleeve 11 in the sense of arrow 12, whereby the snap-in<br>
projections 7 are pressed inwardly and the pressure pin 5 is<br>
catapulted in the sense of arrow 12 by the force of the spring<br>
6, thus causing the conical end formed by the snap-in<br>
projections 7 to pass through the clear cross section of the<br>
ring 10.<br><br><br>
Fig. 3 illustrates the injector part, in which an ampoule 13 and<br>
an injection needle 15 fixed in a needle guide 14 are mounted.<br>
The ampoule 13 in this case reaches into a sleeve 16 which is,<br>
in turn, secured against axial displacement in the housing 3. As<br>
is apparent from Fig. 4, the sleeve 16 on its inner periphery<br>
comprises radially inwardly protruding projections 17 defining a<br>
smaller diameter than the outer diameter of the ampoule 13. They<br>
are dimensioned such that the ampoule 13 rests on the wedge-<br>
shaped run-up surfaces of the projections 17. It is only under a<br>
strong mechanical action on the injector part occurring, for<br>
instance, as the latter is dropped from a great height, that an<br>
axial displacement of the ampoule 13 in the sense of arrow 18 is<br>
effected, which causes the ampoule 13 to be further displaced in<br>
the axial direction along the wedge-shaped run-up surfaces of<br>
the projections 17 under the expansion of the sleeve 16 and,<br>
consequently, be jammed between the projections 17, thus being<br>
secured against further axial displacement.<br>
The sleeve 16 comprises radially outwardly resilient arms 19,<br>
which are provided with recesses into which respective snap-in<br>
noses 20 of the needle guide 14 engage. The needle guide 14 is<br>
thereby coupled to the sleeve 16 and likewise secured against<br>
axial displacement. It is only upon actuation of the injection<br>
device by triggering the pressure pin 5 that the needle guide<br>
will be released. The spring 6 of the activator part in this<br>
case is devised such that the pressure pin 5 exerts a force on<br>
the piston plug 21, thus causing a further displacement of the<br>
ampoule 13 in the sense of arrow 18 against the displacement<br>
resistance created by the projections 17. After this, the<br>
ampoule 13, via wedge-shaped run-up surfaces 22, impinges on<br>
projections 23 formed on the resilient arms 19 of the sleeve 16.<br>
This causes an excursion of the resilient arms 19 in the sense<br>
of arrows 24 such that the recesses will no longer be engaged<br><br>
from behind by the snap-in noses 20 and the needle guide 14 will<br>
be released.<br>
In order to dampen the impact of the ampoule 13 on the needle<br>
guide 14, a spring element and, in particular, a spring basket<br>
25 is provided, which is formed in one piece with the needle<br>
guide 14. The ampoule 13 can subsequently be further moved on in<br>
the axial direction along with the needle guide 14, and the<br>
injection needle can emerge from the housing 3. From Fig. 3, it<br>
is apparent that the housing 3 is closed by a needle protection<br>
cap 26, which is held firmly in a clamping ring 27. From Fig. 3,<br>
it is further apparent that the ampoule 13 is retained in an<br>
ampoule socket 28, which protects the ampoule 13 against<br>
fracture. In the exploded view according to Fig. 5, the<br>
individual elements of the injector part are clearly<br>
illustrated, it being also apparent that the ampoule socket 28<br>
is closed by a sealing foil 29 and sealed relative to the inner<br>
side of the housing 3 by a sealing ring 30. In this manner, the<br>
whole interior of the injector part is encapsulated so as to<br>
safeguard the permanent sterility of the injection unit<br>
including the ampoule. The sealing of the injector interior may,<br>
however, also be effected in another way, as illustrated in Fig.<br>
6. There, the ampoule socket 28 on its outer periphery comprises<br>
a labyrinth seal which ensures the tightness of the ampoule<br>
socket relative to the housing 3. The labyrinth seal has a<br>
plurality of peripherally extending lamellas which are slit at a<br>
point along their peripheries, the slits of axially adjacent<br>
lamellas being each offset by 180°. The thus formed labyrinth is<br>
permeable for a gas that serves to sterilize the injector part<br>
so as to enable its introduction into the injector part through<br>
the labyrinth seal. The labyrinth seal, however, is impermeable<br>
to bacteria. Besides, the sealing ring 30 is to be seen, which,<br>
as opposed to the configuration according to Fig. 5, is not<br>
arranged between the ampoule socket 28 and the inner periphery<br><br>
of the housing 3, but between the ampoule socket 28 and the<br>
ampoule 13. With this configuration, a separate sealing disc is<br>
no longer necessary.<br>
Figs. 7a to 7h illustrate the operation sequence during the<br>
actuation of the injection device. Fig. 7a shows the starting<br>
position prior to the triggering of the activator. In Fig. 7b,<br>
the securing cap 8 has already been removed and the activator is<br>
triggered, with the snap-in projections 7 being compressed and<br>
the pressure pin 5 being released. In Fig. 7c, the pressure pin<br>
5 extends, with the pressure pin end provided with a sprocket 31<br>
punching the sealing foil 29. In Fig. 7d, the ampoule 13 is<br>
displaced forwardly in the axial direction against the displace-<br>
ment resistance exerted by the projections 17, running onto the<br>
projections 23 of the resilient arms 19. In Fig. 7e, the two<br>
spring arms 19 of the sleeve 16 are pivoted outwardly, thus<br>
releasing the needle guide 14. In Fig. 7f the ampoule-side<br>
injection needle end, which is designed as a perforation piece<br>
32, pierces the needle protection cap of the ampoule 13. The<br>
ampoule is, thus, moved forwardly as far as to the end position<br>
along with the needle guide 14, with the injection needle 15<br>
leaving the injection part with its full length. In Fig. 7g, the<br>
spring basket 25 is compressed while further displacing the<br>
ampoule 13 such that the injection needle 15 will pass<br>
completely through the sealing disc of the ampoule 13 and the<br>
radial opening 33 of the injection needle 15 will enter into<br>
communication with the injection liquid contained in the ampoule<br>
13. At the same time, the annular web 34 illustrated in Fig. 3<br>
penetrates the sealing disc of the ampoule 13, thus causing a<br>
closed annular space to form between the annular web 34 and the<br>
injection needle 15 reaching into the ampoule 13, which annular-<br>
space prevents the injection liquid from leaving the ampoule 13<br>
laterally outside of the injection needle 15. By enabling the<br>
injection liquid to emerge through the radial opening 33 and the<br><br>
injection needle 15, the piston plug 21 is driven forwardly as<br>
far as to the stop by the pressure pin 5 so as to cause all of<br>
the injection liquid to be ejected.<br><br>
