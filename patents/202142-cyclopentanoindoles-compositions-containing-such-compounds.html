				<td>TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
CYCLOPENTANOINDOLES, COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING SUCH<br>
COMPOUNDS AND METHODS OF TREATMENT<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to compounds and methods for treating prostaglandin mediated diseases, and certain pharmaceutical compositions thereof. More particularly, the compounds of the invention are structurally different from steroids, antihistamines or adrenergic agonists, and are antagonists of the nasal and pulmonary congestion effects of D-type prostaglandins.<br>
Two review articles describe the characterization and therapeutic relevance of the prostanoid receptors as well as the most commonly used selective agonists and antagonists: Eicosanoids: From Biotechnology to Therapeutic Applications, Folco, Samuelsson, Maclouf, and Velo eds. Plenum Press, New York, 1996, chap. 14, 137-154 and Journal of Lipid Mediators and Cell Signalling, 1996, 14, 83-87. An article from T. Tsuri et al. published in 1997 in Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, vol 40, pp.3504-3507 states that "PGD2 is considered to be an important mediator in various allergic diseases such allergic rhinitis, atopic asthma, allergic conjunctivitis and atopic dermatitis." More recently, an article by Matsuoka et al. in Science (2000), 287:2013-7, describes PGD2 as being a key mediator in allergic asthma. In addition, patents such as US 4,808,608 refer to prostaglandin antagonists as useful in the treatment of allergic diseases, and explicitly allergic asthma. PGD2 antagonists are described in, for example, European Patent Application 837,052 and PCT Application W098/25919, as well as W099/62555<br>
US Patent 4,808,608 discloses tetrahydrocarbazole-l-alkanoic acid derivatives as prostaglandin antagonists.<br>
European Patent Application 468,785 discloses the compound 4-[(4-chlorophenyI)methyl]-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-7-(2-quinolinylmethoxy)-cyclopent[b]indole-3-acetic acid, which is a species of a genus said to be leukotriene biosynthesis inhibitors.<br>
US Patent 3,535,326 discloses antiphlogistic compounds of the formula:<br><br><br>

Utilities<br>
The ability of compounds of formula I to interact with prostaglandin receptors makes them useful for preventing or reversing undesirable symptoms caused by prostaglandins in a mammalian, especially human subject. This mimicking or antagonism of the actions of prostaglandins indicates that the compounds and pharmaceutical compositions thereof are useful to treat, prevent, or ameliorate in mammals and especially in humans: respiratory conditions, allergic condidons, pain, inflammatory conditions, mucus secretion disorders, bone disorders, sleep disorders, fertility disorders, blood coagulation disorders, trouble of the vision as well as immune and autoimmune diseases. In addition, such a compound may inhibit cellular neoplastic transformations and metastic tumor growth and hence can be used in the treatment of cancer. Compounds of formula I may also be of use in the treatment and/or prevention prostaglandin-mediated proliferation disorders such as may occur in diabetic retinopathy and tumor angiogenesis. Compounds of formula I may also inhibit prostanoid-induced smooth muscle contraction by antagonizing contractile prostanoids or mimicking relaxing prostanoids and hence may be use in the treatment of dysmenorrhea, premature labor and eosinophil related disorders. More particularly compounds of formula I are antagonists of prostaglandin D2.<br>
Accordingly, another aspect of the invention provides a method of treating or preventing a prostaglandin mediated disease comprising administering to a mammalian patient in need of such treatment a compound of formula I in an amount which is effective for treating or preventing said prostaglandin mediated disease. Prostaglandin mediated diseases include, but are not linaited to, allergic rhinitis, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, perennial rhinitis, nasal inflammation, asthma including allergic asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and other forms of lung inflammation; sleep disorders and sleep-wake cycle disorders; prostanoid-induced smooth muscle contraction associated with dysmenorrhea and premature labor; eosinophil related disorders; thrombosis; glaucoma and vision disorders; occlusive vascular diseases; congestive heart failure; diseases or conditions requiring a<br><br>
treatment of anti-coagulation such as post-injury or post surgery treatment; inflammation; gangrene; Raynaud's disease; mucus secretion disorders including cytoprotection; pain and migraine; diseases requiring control of bone formation and resorption such as for example osteoporosis; shock; thermal regulation including fever; and immune disorders or conditions in which immunoregulation is desirable. More particularly the disease is to be treated is one mediated by prostaglandin D2 such as nasal congestion, pulmonary congestion, and asthma including allergic asthma.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention is a method of treating or preventing a prostaglandin mediated disease comprising administering to a mammalian patient in need of such treatment a compound of formula I in an amount which is effective for treating or preventing a prostaglandin mediated disease, wherein the prostaglandin mediated disease is nasal congenstion, rhinitis incuding allergic and perennial rhintis, and asthma including allergic asthma.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention is a method of treating or preventing a prostaglandin D2-mediated disease comprising administering to a mammalian patient in need of such treatment a compound of formula I in an amount<br>
which is effective for treating or preventing a prostaglandin D2 mediated disease<br>
■<br>
wherein said prostaglandin D2 mediated disease is nasal congestion or asthma.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention is a method for the treatment of nasal congestion in a patient in need of such treatment which comprises administering to said patient a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula I.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention is a method for the treatment of asthma, particularly allergic asthma, in a patient in need of such treatment which comprises administering to said patient a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula I.<br>
Dose Ranges<br>
The magnitude of prophylactic or therapeutic dose of a compound of formula I will, of course, vary with the nature and the severity of the condition to be treated and with the particular compound of formula I and its route of administration. It will also vary according to a variety of factors including the age, weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination and response of the individual patient. In general, the daily dose from about 0.001 mg to<br><br>
or oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, or syrups or elixirs. Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting of sweetening agents, flavouring agents, colouring agents and preserving agents in order to provide pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparations. Tablets contain the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. These excipients may be for example, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, for example, com starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, for example starch, gelatin or acacia, and lubricating agents, for example, magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. The tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be employed. They may also be coated by the technique described in the U.S. Patent 4,256,108; 4,166,452; and 4,265,874 to form osmotic therapeutic tablets for control release.<br>
Formulations for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredients is mixed with water-miscible solvents such as propylene glycol, PEGs and ethanol, or an oil medium, for example peanut oil, liquid paraffin, or olive oil.<br>
Aqueous suspensions contain the active material in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients are suspending agents, for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia; dispersing or wetting agents may be a naturally-occurring phosphatide, for example lecithin, or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids, for example polyoxyethylene stearate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for example heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived<br><br>
about 100 mg per kg body weight of a mammal, preferably 0.01 mg to about 10 mg per kg. On the other hand, it may be necessary to use dosages outside these limits in some cases.<br>
The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. For example, a formulation intended for the oral administration of humans may contain from 0.05 mg to 5 g of active agent compounded with an appropriate and convenient amount of carrier material which may vary from about 5 to about 99.95 percent of the total composition. Dosage unit forms will generally contain between from about 0.1 mg to about 0.4 g of an active ingredient, typically 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, or 400 mg.<br>
Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
Another aspect of the present invention provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of formula I with a phannaceutically acceptable carrier. The term "composition", as in pharmaceutical composition, is intended to encompass a product comprising the active ingredient(s)" and the inert ingredient(s) (pharmaceutically acceptable excipients) that make up the carrier, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combination, complexation or aggregation of any two or more of the ingredients, or from dissociation of one or more of the ingredients, or from other types of reactions or interactions of one or more of the ingredients. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention encompass any composition made by admixing a compound of Formula I, additional active ingredient(s), and pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.<br>
For the treatment of any of the prostanoid mediated diseases compounds of formula I may be administered orally, by inhalation spray, topically, parenterally or rectally in dosage unit formulations containing conventional non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants and vehicles. The term parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous injections, intravenous, intramuscular, intrastemal injection or infusion techniques. In addition to the treatment of warm-blooded animals such as mice, rats, horses, cattle, sheep, dogs, cats, etc., the compound of the invention is effective in the treatment of humans.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions containing the active ingredient may be in a form suitable for oral use, for example, as tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous<br><br>
r oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, r symps or elixirs. Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to ny method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and uch compositions may contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting if sweetening agents, flavouring agents, colouring agents and preserving agents in order to provide pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparations.

The tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be employed. They may also be coated by the technique described in the U.S. Patent 4,256,108; 4,166,452; and 4,265,874 to form osmotic therapeutic tablets for control release.<br>
Formulations for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredients is mixed with water-miscible solvents such as propylene glycol, PEGs and ethanol, or an oil medium, for example peanut oil, liquid paraffin, or olive oil.<br>
Aqueous suspensions contain the active material in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients are suspending agents, for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia; dispersing or wetting agents may be a naturally-occurring phosphatide, for example lecithin, or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids, for example polyoxyethylene stearate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for example heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived<br><br>

The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents such as those set forth above, and flavouring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid.<br>
Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional excipients, for example sweetening, flavouring and colouring agents, may also be present.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be in the form of an oil-in-water emulsion. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil, for example olive oil or arachis oil, or a mineral oil, for example liquid paraffin or mixtures of these.

The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butane diol. Among the acceptable vehicles<br><br>
and solvents that may be employed are water. Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. Cosolvents such as ethanol, propylene glycol or polyethylene glycols may also be used. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables.<br>
Compounds of formula I may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. These compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at ambient temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials are cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols.<br>

METHODS OF SYNTHESIS<br>
Compounds of Formula I of the present invention can be prepared according to the synthetic routes outlined in Schemes 1 to 6 and by following the methods described herein.<br>
Intermediate compounds of Formula IV may be prepared by the method presented in Scheme 1 from an appropriately substituted phenyl hydrazine (II). Reaction of II with an appropriate cyclopentanone III under Fisher Indole or similar conditions sives IV.<br><br>
Compounds of Formula IV may alternatively be prepared by the method presented in Scheme 2 from an appropriately substituted aniline (V). Reaction of V with iodine yields VI. Condensation with an appropriate cyclopentanone III followed by the cyclization under Heck or similar metal catalysis conditions leads to indole IV.<br><br><br>
Compounds of Formula IH may be prepared by the method presented in Scheme 3 from an appropriately substituted silyl enol ether (VII) or an approprilately substituted enamine (VIII). Addition of an appropriate electrophile such as QY (wherein Y represents a halogen or a leaving group) in the presence of a base such as an alkvl lithium or a Lewis acid such as silver trifluoroacetate with the silyl end ether VII gives the cyclopentanone III. The compound of formula. Ill may alternatively be prepared from the addition of QY on an appropriately substituted enamine VIII under Stork Enamine or similar conditions.<br><br>
Intermediate compounds of Formula X may be prepared by the method presented in Scheme 4 from an appropriately substituted indole (IX). Bromination of IX may be accomplished with bromine in a polar and basic solvent such as pyridine<br><br>
followed by the mono reduction of a dibromo intermediate under acid and reducing metal conditions to generate the indole X.<br><br>
Compounds of Formula I may be prepared by the method presented in Scheme 5 from an appropriately substituted indole (lY). Alkylation of IV with the appropriate electrophile such as ArXY (wherein Y represents a halogen or a leaving group) in the presence of a base and in a suitable solvent such as DMF gives I.<br><br>
Compounds of Formula I may alternatively be prepared by the method presented in Scheme 6 from an appropriately substituted bromoindole (XI) from compound of formula X following the coupling reaction described in Scheme 5. Palladium coupling or similar reactions of bromoindole XI with an appropriate organometallic compound R3M (wherein M represents a metal such as B, Mg, Zn or Sn) leads to compound I. The same bromoindole XI may alternatively first react with a suitable metallation agent, such as n-BuLi, followed by trapping with an electrophile such as R3Y to give compound I.<br><br><br>
REPRESENTATIVE COMPOUNDS<br>
Representative compounds of formula I are shown in the following Tables; the substituents are as indicated, and H is meant where no value appears for a particular variable. Each entry is intended to include the racemic or diastereomeric mixture, and the individual enantiomers and/or diasteromers. Methods for the resolution of enantiomers and for the separation of diastereomers are well known to those skilled in the art; selective illustration of such methods are also described in the Examples hereinbelow.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
ASSAYS FOR DETERMINING BIOLOGICAL ACTrVlTY<br>
Compounds of formula I can be tested using the following assays to determine their prostanoid antagonist or agonist activity in vitro and in vivo and their selectivity. The prostaglandin receptor activities demonstrated are DP, EP1, EP2, EP3,EP4,FP,IP and TP.<br>
Stable expression of prostanoid receptors in the human embryonic kidney (HEK") 293(ebnal cell line<br>
Prostanoid receptor cDNAs corresponding to full length coding sequences are subcloned into the appropriate sites of mammalian expression vectors and transfected into HEK 293(ebna) cells. HEK 293(ebna) cells expressing the individual cDNAs are grown under selection and individual colonies are isolated after 2-3 weeks of growth using the cloning ring method and subsequently expanded into clonal cell lines.<br>
Prostanoid receptor binding assays<br>
-	i]     II. I       I..	-	I—	-	pi<br>
HEK 293(ebna) cells are maintained in culture, harvested and membranes are prepared by differential centrifugation, following lysis of the cells in<br><br>
the presence of protease inhibitors, for use in receptor binding assays. Prostanoid receptor binding assays are performed in 10 mM MES/KOH (pH 6.0) (EPs, FP and TP) or 10 mM HEPES/KOH (pH 7.4) (DP and IP), containing 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM divalent cation and the appropriate radioligand. The reaction is initiated by addition of membrane protein. Ligands are added in dimethylsulfoxide which is kept constant at 1 % (v/v) in all incubations. Non-specific binding is determined in the presence of 1 μM of the corresponding non-radioactive prostanoid. Incubations are conducted for 60 min at room temperature or 30 °C and terminated by rapid filtration. Specific binding is calculated by subtracting non specific binding from total binding. The residual specific binding at each ligand concentration is calculated and expressed as a function of ligand concentration in order to construct sigmoidal concentration-response curves for determination of ligand affinity.<br>
Prostanoid receptor agonist and antagonist assays<br>
Whole cell second messenger assays measuring stimulation (EP2, EP4,<br>
DP and IP in HEK 293(ebna) cells) or inhibition (EP3 in human erythroleukemia<br>
(HEL) cells) of intracellular c AMP accumulation or mobilization of intracellular calcium (EPi, FP and TP in HEK 293(ebna) cells stably transfected with apo-<br>
aequorin) are performed to determine whether receptor ligands are agonists or<br>
antagonists. For cAMP assays, cells are harvested and resuspended in BBSS<br>
containing 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. Incubations contain 100 μM RO-20174<br>
(phosphodiesterase type IV inhibitor, available from Biomol) and, in the case of the EP3 inhibition assay only, 15μM forskolin to stimulate cAMP production. Samples<br>
are incubated at 37°C for 10 min, the reaction is terminated and cAMP levels are then<br>
measured. For calcium mobilization assays, cells are charged with the co-factors<br>
reduced glutathione and coelenterazine, harvested and resuspended in Ham's F12<br>
medium. Calcium mobilization is measured by monitoring luminescence provoked by<br>
calcium binding to the intracellular photoprotein aequorin. Ligands are added in<br>
dimethylsulfoxide which is kept constant at 1 % (v/v) in all incubations. For agonists,<br>
second messenger responses are expressed as a function of ligand concentration and both EC50 values and the maximum response as compared to a prostanoid standard<br>
are calculated. For antagonists, the ability of a ligand to inhibit an agonist response is determined by Schild analysis and both KB and slope values are calculated.<br><br>
prevention of PGD2 or allergen induced nasal congestion in allergic sheep<br>
Animal preparation: Healthy adult sheeps (18-50 kg) are used. These nimals are selected on the basis of a natural positive skin reaction to an intradermal injection of Ascaris suwn extract.<br>
Measurements of nasal congestion: The experiment is performed on onscious animals. They are restained in a cart in a prone position with their heads immobilized. Nasal airway resistance (NAR) is measured using a modified mask hinometry technique. A topical anaesthesia (2% lidocaine) is applied to the nasal passage for the insertion of a nasotracheal tube. The maximal end of the tube is connected to a pneumotachograph and a flow and pressure signal is recorded on an OScilloscope linked to a computer for on-line calculation of NAR. Nasal provocation s performed by the administration of an aerosolized solution (10 puffs/nostril). Changes in the N.AR congestion are recorded prior to and for 60-120 minutes post-challenge.<br>
Prevention of PGD2 and allergen induced nasal obstruction in cvnomolgus monkey<br>
. Animal preparation: Healthy adult male cynomologus monkeys (4-10 e,g) are used. These animals are selected on the basis of a natural positive skin reaction to an intradermal injection of Ascaris suwn extract. Before each experiment, [he monkey selected for a study is fasted overnight with water provided at libitum. The next morning, the animal is sedated with ketamine (10-15 mg/kg i.m.) before being removed from its home cage. It is placed on a heated table (36°C) and injected with a bolus dose (5-12 mg/kg i.v.) of propofol. The animal is intubated with a cuffed endotracheal tube (4-6 mm ID.) and anaesthesia is maintained via a continuous intravenous infusion of propofol (25-30 mg/kg/h). Vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, body temperature) are monitored throughout the experiment.<br>
Measurements of nasal congestion: A measurement of the animal respiratory resistance is taken via a pneumotachograph connected to the endotracheal tube to ensure that it is normal. An Ecovision accoustic rhinometer is used to evaluate nasal congestion. This technique gives a non-invasive 2D echogram of the inside of the nose. The nasal volume and the minimal cross-sectional area along the length of the nasal cavity are computed within 10 seconds by a laptop computer equipped with a custom software (Hood Laboratories, Mass, U.S.A.). Nasal challenge is delivered directly to the animal's nasal cavity (50 μL volume). The changes in nasal<br><br>
congestion are recorded prior to and for 60-120 minutes post-challenge. If nasal congestion occurs, it will translate into a reduction in the nasal volume.<br>
Pulmonary Mechanics in Trained Conscious Squirrel Monkeys<br>
The test procedure involves placing trained squirrel monkeys in chairs in aerosol exposure chambers. For control purposes, pulmonary mechanics measurements of respiratory parameters are recorded for a period of about 30 minutes to establish each monkeys normal control values for that day. For oral administration, compounds are dissolved or suspended in a 1% methocel solution (methylcellulose, 65HG, 400 cps) and given in a volume of 1 mL/kg body weight. For aerosol administration of compounds, a DeVilbiss ultrasonic nebulizer is utilized. Pretreatment periods vary from 5 minutes to 4 hours before the monkeys are challenged with aerosol doses of either PGD2 or Ascaris suum antigen; 1:25 dilution.<br>
Following challenge, each minute of data is calculated by computer as a percent change from control values for each respiratory parameter including airway resistance (RL) and dynamic compliance (Cdyn)- The results for each test compound<br>
are subsequently obtained for a minimum period of 60 minutes post challenge which are then compared to previously obtained historical baseline control values for that monkey. In addition, the overall values for 60 minutes post-challenge for each monkey (historical baseline values and test values) are averaged separately and are used to calculate the overall percent inhibition of mediator or Ascaris antigen response by the test compound. For statistical analysis, paired t-test is used. (References: McFarlane, C.S. et al. Prostaglandins, 28, 173-182 (1984) and McFarlane, C.S. et al., Agents Actions, 22, 63-68 (1987).)<br>
Prevention of Induced Bronchoconstriction in Allergic Sheep<br>
Animal Preparation; Adult sheep with a mean weight of 35 kg (range, 18 to 50 kg) are used. All animals used meet two criteria: a) they have a natural cutaneous reaction to 1:1,000 or 1:10,000 dilutions of Ascaris suum extract (Greer Diagnostics, Lenois, NC); and b) they have previously responded to inhalation challenge with Ascaris suum with both an acute bronchoconstriction and a late bronchial obstruction (W.M. Abraham et al.. Am. Rev. Resp. Dis., 128, 839-44 (1983)).<br>
Measurement of Airway Mechanics: The unsedated sheep are restrained in a cart in the prone position with their heads immobilized. After topical<br><br>
anesthesia of the nasal passages with 2% lidocaine solution, a balloon catheter is<br>
advanced through one nostril into the lower esophagus. The animals are then<br>
intubated with a cuffed endotracheal tube through the other nostril using a flexible<br>
fiberoptic bronchoscope as a guide. Pleural pressure is estimated with the esophageal<br>
balloon catheter (filled with one mL of air), which is positioned such that inspiration<br>
produces a negative pressure deflection with clearly discernible cardiogenic<br>
oscillations. Lateral pressure in the trachea is measured with a sidehole catheter<br>
(inner dimension, 2.5 mm) advanced through and positioned distal to the tip of the<br>
nasotracheal tube. Transpulmonary pressure, the difference between tracheal pressure<br>
and pleural pressure, is measured with a differential pressure transducer (DP45;<br>
Validyne Corp., Northridge, CA). For the measurement of pulmonary resistance (RL), the maximal end of the nasotrachel tube is connected to a pneumotachograph<br>
(Fleisch, Dyna Sciences, Blue Bell, PA). The signals of flow and transpulmonary<br>
pressure are recorded on an oscilloscope (Model DR-12; Electronics for Medicine,<br>
White Plains, NY) which is linked to a PDP-11 Digital computer (Digital Equipment Corp., Maynard, MA) for on-line calculation of RL from transpulmonary pressure,<br>
respiratory volume obtained by integration and flow. Analysis of 10-15 breaths is used for the determination of RL. Thoracic gas volume (Vtg) is measured in a body<br>
plethysmograph, to obtain specific pulmonary resistance (SRL = RL'Vtg)-<br>
