A   CAR   PARK<br>
FIELD   OF  THE   INVBNTION<br>
The  prasent   invention  relates   to  a   car  park  or  parking<br>
5      garage,   and  to   a  storage   facility.<br>
BACRGROUND   OF  THE   INVENTION<br>
Existing multilevel  car  parks  provide  multiple  parking<br>
compartments   ot  platforms,   each  generally  accessible  by<br>
10      means  of  a  sequence  of  ramps  joining  each  level.     The<br>
ramps  may  be   essentially   straight,   or,   in  some,  existing   car<br>
parks,   spijral.      The  tamps,   however,   consume   a  substantial<br>
amount  of   epace   that   ideally  would  be  devoted   to  parking<br>
compartments.<br>
15<br>
This  problem  has  been  addressed  in  some  existing   car  parks<br>
by  providing  a  multilevel   car  park  with  one  or  more<br>
hoists,   for   transporting   the  cats   to   the  parking<br>
compartments.      This   reduces  or   eliminates   the  need  for<br>
20      ramps.     For  example,   CH  6 8 6,896  discloses  a  car  park<br>
comprising   a   ailo  with,  radiating  parking   compartments   at<br>
each  level.      The  packing   compartments   at  any  particular<br>
level  form  an  annulus.     In  the  centre  of  the  ailo   -  within<br>
the  annulusss   -   is  a  central   shafe  with  a  hoist  for<br>
25      raising  and  lowering  cars  batwaen  the  different   levels,<br>
including  ground   level.      Each   car   is   either   driven   from<br>
the  hoist   into   a  vacant  parking  compartment  or  drawn   from<br>
the  hoiet  by  mechanical  means   into   the  parking<br>
compartment.<br>
30<br>
Another   existing  ayatern,   the  Trevipark   (TM)   parking<br>
system,   comprises   a  multi-level   automated,  car  park  that<br>
stores   cars  with  the  aid  of   a  stacking  system  and  usually<br>
underground..     A  typical  Trevipark   (TM)   packing  system<br>
35       stores  up   to   108   cars,   with  12  parking   spaces  per   level   on<br>
each  of   9   levels.     Its   structure  is   circular,   and<br>
incorporates   a  central  rotating   lift  mechanism  for  the<br><br>
WO2004/041684                                                                                                        PCT/AU2003/001466<br>
placement  and  retrieval  of  vehicles.<br>
Another  existing  system,   the  Robotic  Parking   (TM)   parking<br>
system,   comprises  a  generally  rectangular  construotion.<br>
5      Unlike   the  Trevipark   (TM)   system,   it  does  not  have   any<br>
revolving  elements.     Rather,    the  Robotic   Parking   (TM)<br>
parking  system  uses  vertical  lifts   and  lateral  conveyor<br>
transportation  to  place  and  retrieve  vehicles,   in  order   to<br>
minimise   the   area  required  by  access   sisles.     This   system<br>
10      thus  resembles  in  many  respects  older,   conventional<br>
parking  structures.<br>
SUMMARY   OF  THE   INVENTION<br>
It   is   an  object  of  the  present  invention  to  provide   a  car<br>
15      park  in  which  a  higher  parking  density  can  be  achieved  in<br>
an  alternative  to  existing  approaches.<br>
The  present  invention  provides  a  car  park  comprising:<br>
a  plurality  of  annular  parking  levels;<br>
2 0                    an  outer   structure   and   a  central   core   for<br>
supporting   said  parking   levels,   and<br>
a  hoisting  machanism;<br>
therein  each  of   said  plurality  of  parking  levels<br>
comprises  a  plurality  of  parking  compartments  located<br>
25      between  said  outer  structure   and  said   inner   core,   each  of<br>
said  levels  is   rotatabls  to  bring  a  respective  compartment<br>
into  alignment  with,  said  hoisting  mechanigm  so   that  said<br>
respective   compartment   can  be   detached   from  said<br>
respective  level   and  raised  or  lowered  by  said  hoisting<br>
3 0       mechanism.<br>
It  will  be  understood   that   the  car  park  of  the   invention<br>
can  be  used  to  park  vehicles  other   than  care,   and  that   the<br>
term  "car  park"   is   regarded  throughout   as   synonymous  with.<br>
35       "parking  garage."<br>
Thus,   it   is  not  necessary  to  provide  separate  hoist<br><br>
WO2004/041684                                                                                                        PCT/AU2003/001466<br>
3<br>
platforms  and  parking  compartments   as  each parking<br>
compartment  acts  as  necessary  as  a  hoist  platform.<br>
In  one  embodiment   the  hoisting  mechanism  is  arranged  to<br>
5       raise  or   lower   said  compartments  vertically,      In  another<br>
embodiment  the  hoisting  mechanism  is   arranged   to  raiae  or<br>
lower  the  parking  compartments   in  a   apiral   shaped  lift<br>
well.<br>
10      Thue,   in  the   former  of   these  embodimenta   each  parking<br>
compartment  is  moved  thorough  the  shortest  distance  between<br>
levele,   but  in   the  latter  embodiment  a  reduced  lifting<br>
force  can  be  used  by  taking  advantese  of   the  mechanical<br>
advantage  provided  by  employing  a  apiral  motion.<br>
15<br>
The  car  park  includes  at  least  one  entrance  level  at  which<br>
cars  may  enter   said  car  park  and  park  on  an  available   one<br>
of   said  parking  compartments,   whereby  said  available<br>
parking  compartment   (now  occupied)   is  mavable   to  a  parking<br>
20      location.     This  movement  optionally   inclndes   either  or<br>
both,   rotatioa  to   orgage   said  hoisting  mechanism  and<br>
upward  or  downward  movement  by  means   of   said  hoisting<br>
mechanism.     This  movement  generally  always - includes<br>
rotation  at  a   final  parking   level  out  of  engagement  with<br>
25       said  hoisting  mechanism  to  a  final  parking  location.<br>
The  entry  level   can  be  at  ground  level  at  the  bottom  of   an<br>
above  ground  car  park,   at  ground  level  at  the   top  of   a<br>
substantially  underground  car  park,   or   at  an  intermediate<br>
30       level  of  a  car  park   (whether   the  car  park  is  below  ground,<br>
above  ground  or  partially  above  and  below  ground) .      In<br>
addition,   the  car  park  need  not  he  a  free-standing<br>
structure.     While   it  can  be   free-standing,   an  alternative<br>
embodiment  has   the  car  park  incorporated  into  another<br>
35       structure   (such  as   an  office  building).     In   this   latter<br>
case,   the   outer  etructure  of   the   car  park  may  be  or<br>
include  porbiona   of  that   other  structure.<br><br>
WO2004/041684                                                                                                        PCT/AU2003/001466<br>
In  one  embodiment,    the  car  park  has  multiple  entrance<br>
levels  so  that  cars  may  enter   said  car  park  more  quickly.<br>
Preferably  the  car  park  exit  correaponds  with  the  car  park<br>
5       entrance,   but   this  meed  not  be   the  case;   for  example,   the<br>
car  park  exit  could,  be   located  in  a  different  level   from<br>
the  car  park  entrance   so   that  a  car  can  be  moved  through,<br>
the  exit  for  exiting  while   another  car  eatera   the   entrance<br>
in  anticipation  of  being  moved   to  a  suitable  parking<br>
10      location.<br>
In  one  embodiment,    the  car  park  includes   a  plurality  of<br>
hoisting  mechanisms.<br>
15      thus,   for  example,   separate   hoisting  mechanisms  could  be<br>
located  180°   apart;   although  this  would  generally  reduce<br>
the  number  of  parking  compartments,   it  might  be  deslrable<br>
where   epeed  of   vehicle   entrance  and  exit   is  particularly<br>
important.<br>
20<br>
In another embodiment,   at least some of  the parking<br>
compartments   are  adapted, to  receive more   than one  vehicle.<br>
Thus,   especially where vehioles are parked with high<br>
25      frequancy,   more   than one  could be   accommodated  in  or  on   a<br>
single parkinig  compartment.     this would  allow,   for<br>
example,   two  vehicles   to  park  and be  stored  at   the   same<br>
time.      In this  embodiment,   when, one of   such vehicles  is<br>
desired,,   the  other would  also  be moved  to   the  exit   level<br>
30      but  simply  returned with a  new second vehicle   (if   there<br>
remains   a high demand  for parking) ,   or  returned  to  a<br>
parking location alone,<br>
Preferably  at   least  one  drive   segment  is provided at  each<br>
35       level   for  rotating   said plurality of parking  compartments.<br>
Generally  the  drive  segment   (or drive platform)   does   not<br><br>
WO2004/041684                                                                                                        PCT/AU2003/001466<br>
comprise  a  parking  platform,   and  is   therefore  not  -  in  use<br>
-  removed  from  its  respective  level.<br>
in  one  embodiment,   said  plurality  o£  annular  parking<br>
5      levels  constitutes  a  first  parking  circuit  and said  car<br>
park  includes   at  least  one  additional  parking  circuit<br>
comprising  a  further  plurality  of  annular  parking  levels,<br>
wherein   said  first  parking  circuit  and  said  additional<br>
parking  circuit  are  coaxial.<br>
10<br>
The  levels  of  the  fuzther   (or  outer)   circuit  may  or  may<br>
not  be  aligned  vertically  with,  those  of   the   inner   (or<br>
first)   oireuit.<br>
15       The  present   invention,  also  provides   a  storge  facility,<br>
comprising:<br>
a  plurality  of  annular  storage  levels;<br>
an  outer   stueture   and  a  cantral  core   for<br>
supporting  said  storage  levels,   and<br>
20                       a  hoisting  mechanism;<br>
wherein  each  of   said:  plurality  of   storage   levels<br>
comprises  a  plurality  of   storage   compartments  located<br>
between  said  outer  structure  and  said  inner-core.   each  of<br>
said  levels  is  rotatable  to  dring  a  respective  compartment<br>
55      into  alignment  with  said  hoisting  mechanism  so  that  said<br>
respective  compartment  can  be  detached  from  said<br>
respective  level  and  raiaed  or   lowered  by   said  hoisting<br>
mechanism.<br>
30       Thus,    the   invention  provides   a   stotage   facility   for<br>
essentially  any  object,   in  which  case   cars  may  be  regarded<br>
as  aimply  ane  ey-ample  of   such  etorable  objecte.     As will<br>
be   appreciated,   the  size  and  meclianical   demands  of   the<br>
facility will  depend  on  the  nature  of  the  object  or<br>
35      objects   to  be  stored.<br>
Preferably  each,  compartment  includes  or  comprises  a<br><br>
WO2004/041684                                                                                                        PCT/AU2003/001466<br>
container  adapted  for   the  intended   stored,  type  of   article<br>
or  articles.<br>
Thue   mora   than  one   type  of  article   could  be   stored,   and<br>
5       one  or  more   types  of   container  of   suitable  design   for  the<br>
intended   artiales.<br>
Preferably  at   least  one  drive   setgment  is   provided  at  each<br>
level  for  rotating  said  plurality  of  storage  compartments,<br>
1-0<br>
Generally  the drive aegment  does  not  comprise  a  storage<br>
compartment,   and is therefore not -  in use  - removed from<br>
its raspactive  level.<br>
15       In one embodiment,   said plurality  of   annular  storage<br>
levels   constitutes  a   first  storage   oircuit  and   said<br>
storage   facility  includes  at   least  one   additional   storage<br>
aircuit   comprising  a  further plurality of   annular   storage<br>
levels,   wherein  said first   storage  circuit   and  said<br>
20      additional   storage circuit  are  coaxial.<br>
The  levels   of   the  further   (or  outer)   circuit may  or may<br>
not be  aligned vertically with  those  of   the  inner   for<br>
first)   circuit.<br>

DETAILED  DESCRIPTION<br>
A  car park  according  to  a  first preferred  embodiment  of<br>
the present   invention  is   shown genetally   at   10   in,  figure<br>
1.     In this  emibodiment,   the  car park 10  is  an above-ground<br>
20       car park,    though  it  will  be   appreciated   that   it   could   in<br>
some embodiments be partially or wholly below ground.<br>
Car park 10   lncludes  an inner core  12  and an outer<br>
supporting  stiruatrure 14,   and comprises  a plurality of<br>
25       annular parking levels  16a,   16b,   16c,   etc,     Each level<br>
comprises   a plurality of parking  compartments   in  the   form<br>
of  parking  platforms,    each   of   which  comprises   a   sector   of<br>
a  respective  annular parking  level  and  extending between<br>
inner  cors   12   and outer   atructure   14.<br>
Car park 10 includes a vertical lift shaft 20, generally<br>
comprising vertically aligned, gaps, one parking platform<br>
in width,   in each  of   the parking   levels   15a,   16b,   etc.<br>
35       In one  alternative embodiment,   the  lift. shaft  has  a spiral<br>
configuration in which the  gaps   are progressively  offset<br>
around the vertical axis  of  the  car park.     This<br><br>
WO2004/041684                                                                                                        PCT/AU2003/001466<br>
configuration has  the advantage of reducing  the lifting<br>
force required to raise vehicles.<br>
In another alternative embodiment,   each, level is offset<br>
5       relative  to   its   adjacent  levels,   so   that   the   inner  core   is<br>
not vertical.     The lift well   in  this embodiment  is<br>
straight but  slanted.<br>
The overall dimensions  of   the  car Park can be  chasten  to<br>
10       suit  the  application   (including  expected vehicle  size,<br>
etc),   but   in  this  embodiment   t:he   car park   10   has   21<br>
parking  levels,   each with   17  parking platforms,     The   outer<br>
oircumference of  each level   is   approximately 69, 2  m.      The<br>
height of  the car park 10   is approximately 48 m.<br>
15<br>
The vertical separation 25  of the parking  levels,   when<br>
used  for  parking passenger vehicles   is   approximately<br>
2,2  m.<br>
20      Figure   3   is   an  essentially cross-sectional   schematic   view<br>
of   the   car park  10,   occupied by a  number  of  cars   32.      In<br>
use,   each car is  raised  in  lift shaft 20  on  a parking<br>
platform 24   to the desired. Ievel,   as will be  described  in<br>
greater detail below.     Each of   the packing platforms   18,<br>
25       24   (of   steel   or  reinforced concrete)   has   a  thickness   of<br>
approximately  0-2   m.<br>
Each parking  level  l6a,   16b,   etc.   is rotatable,   so   that<br>
when parking platform  24   reaches   the desired  level,   the<br>
30       level   (including   the  parking platforms   constituting   that<br>
level   and the  junt   raised parking platform  24)   is  rotated<br>
so   that  the  car being parked  is moved out  of  the lift-well<br>
20;   an  unoccupied, parking platform is  instead located  in<br>
the   lift-well  20.     That  unoccupied platform  is   than<br>
33       lowered  to   the  entrance   level   ready  to  teceive   the  next<br>
car.     Alternatively,   if   a  driver wishes   to   retrieve his   or<br>
her car at the same  time as  another car   is  being parked,<br><br>
WO2004/041684                                                                                                        PCT/AU2003/001466<br>
the car being packed can be raisead to the  same level  as<br>
the  desired car,   after which  that   level   can be  rotated  to<br>
bring the desired car  Into alignment with the   lift-well  so<br>
that   the desired car  can be   lowered on  its  parking<br>
5      platform to  the  entrance/exit   level   (in   this   embodiment,<br>
ground level).<br>
Detailed views  of  an  individual  parking  platform are   shown<br>
in  figures  3A,   3B,   3C  and. 3D.      Referring  to   figure   3A,<br>
10       each parking platform 30   is   located between Outer wall   14<br>
and  inner  core   12.      Each, platform 30   and   the   other<br>
platforms at  the  same  level   are  supported at their  inner<br>
end, by  a  principal  inner bracker  32,   which  is   itaelf<br>
supported by inner   core   12   and  is   continuous   apart   from a<br>
15       gap  coinciding with  lift-well   20.     This   gap   allows   the<br>
lifting mechanism  to  raise or  lower parking platforms<br>
within   the lift-well  20.     Principal inner bracket  32<br>
includes a horizontal   slot   34   for  accommodating  the<br>
parking platforms   30.     The outer   end of  each, parking<br>
20      platform 30  is  supported by a principal outer bracket  36<br>
supported by outer wall   14  and including a  slot 36   for<br>
receiving each parking platform 30.     As with inner bracket<br>
32,   principal   outer bracket  36   circles   the entire  car  park<br>
10,   apart  from a, gap  coincidlng with lift well   20 .<br>
25<br>
Referring to  figure  3B,   the lift-well  20   (shown<br>
essentially in cross -section)   can  acccnmnadate   a   single<br>
parking platform 40,   raised or  lowered by means of  a<br>
hoi-sting  or  lifting mechanism     This mechanism includes<br>
30       inner  lift bracket   42   and outar   lift bracket  44   that   are<br>
essentially  identidal   in  cross-section with principal<br>
inner bracket   32   and principal   outer bracket   36   of  each<br>
level.     Brackets   42   and  44,   however,   have  widths<br>
correaponding  to   the  width of   lift-well   20   at   their<br>
35      rsspective  locations.     Lift- bxackets 42   and 44  retained<br>
aad move  in guides   (not  shown)   in  inner and outer walls<br>
12/   14   and are  raised or  lowered by  inner   cables  46   and<br><br>
WO2004/041684                                                                                                        PCT/AU2003/001466<br>

outer  cables  48 .     The  necessary  lift  can  be  provided  by<br>
any  suitable  hoist  located  above   the  upper  most  level   of<br>
car  park  10.<br>
5      This  arrangement  is   shown  more  clearly,   schematically,   in<br>
figura  3C  in  which  it  can  be  seen  how  inner  lift  bracket<br>
42   and  outer  lift  bracket  44   can  be  lifted  to   coincide<br>
with,  principal   inner  bracket   32   (principal   inner  bracket<br>
44)   so  that  parking  platform  40   (being  raided  or  lowered)<br>
10      can  be  brought   into  coincidence  with  other  parking<br>
platforms   already  at  that  respective  level.<br>
An  alternative  configuration  to  that  shown  in  figure  3B  is<br>
ahown  in  figure  3D ,     In  this  embodiment,   the  parking<br>
 15   platform  40  and  the  bulk  of  the  lifting  mechanism  is<br>
unchanged.      However,   the   lifting  mechanism  is   augmented  by<br>
a  rigid  tie  in  the  form  of  plate  45  joining  inner  lift<br>
bracket  42   and  outer  lift  bracket  44.     This  plate  45   is<br>
located  beneatb  the  parking  platform  40   and  is   of<br>
20       comparable  width   thereto,    and   serves   to   further   fix   inner<br>
lift  bracket  42   and  outer  lift  bracket  44   relative   to   each<br>
during   raising   and  lowering   of  parking  platform  40,<br>
particularly  When  carrying  a  vehicle.     Tne  plate   45  may<br>
also  be  provided  with  rollers  or  other  comparable<br>
25    meohanisms   to   facilitate   the   sliding  of  each  parking<br>
platform  onto   the   lifting  mechanism,   particularly  when<br>
loaded  with  a  vehicle.<br>
Optionally,    the   pairs   of   principal   inner   and   outer<br>
30      brackets   32,   3 6   may  also  be  provided  with   such  a   tie  or<br>
ties,   but  as   these  brackets   32,   36   are  not  moved  during<br>
the  operation  of   the  car  park   this   is  regarded  ad   less<br>
important.<br>
35      Figure  4   illustrates  how  the  packing  platforms   at   any<br>
single  level  are  rotated  so   that  a   car  that  has  been<br>
raised  or  lowered  to  that  level  can  be  moved  out  of   the<br><br>
lift-well   and  into   a  parking  location  or,    alternatively,<br>
how  a  parked  car  can  be brought  to  a  lift-well   so   that  it<br>
can  be   lowered  to   the  ground  and  exit  level,     as   explained<br>
above,   the   lifting  mecbanism  includes   inner   lift  bracket<br>
5       42,   the   lower  portion   of  which,  is   shown  in   figure   4.      When<br>
reised  or  lowered  by   the  lifting  mechanism,    this  bracket<br>
42  coincides  with  the  principal   inner  bracket  32.<br>
In  figure  4   is   shown  a  representative  parking  platform  50,<br>
10      whose  inner   end  is   exposed;   in  this   figure  the  upper<br>
portion  of   inner  bracket  32   is  omitted  for  alarity   (as   is<br>
the  upper  portion  of  movable  inner  lift  bracket  42) .<br>
Each  parking  level   (such as  the  representative  level  shown<br>
15      in  figure  4)   is  provided  with  a  drive  for   rotating  parking<br>
platforms  at   that   level.     Although  any  suitable  mechanism<br>
may  be  used   to  rotate  the  parking  platforms   that  form  a<br>
respective  level,   in   this   embodiment  a  continuous  driven<br>
belt  52   is  employed.   located  within  principal  innar<br>
20      bracket   32.     A  second,   comparable  belt   (not  shown)    is   also<br>
employed,   located  within  principal   outer  bracket   36,     Each<br>
of  these  belts  has   teeth  corresponding   to   teeth  along  the<br>
inner  periphery  and  outer  periphery  respectively  of   each<br>
parking  platform  50.     Each  belt  is  driven  by  means   of  a<br>
25      pair  of   drive  wheels    (for   inner  belt   52:   drive  wheels   54<br>
and  56) ,   provided  in  principal   inner  bracket  32   and<br>
principal  outer  brackat  36   respectively  near  the   ends  of<br>
the  principal   brackets  adjacent  the   lift-well  gap.     Drive<br>
wheels   54   and   56   (and   the   corresponding  drive  wheels<br>
30      driving  the  outer  belt)   are  driven  by  means  of  a  suitable<br>
alectric  motor,     The   drive  balts   are   only  operated  when<br>
the   lifting  mechanism  is  positioned  such   that   lift<br>
brackets   42   and   44   and  a  parking  platform  40   are   aligned<br>
with  that   respective   parkins  level.<br>
35<br>
If   a  car   is   to  be  removed,   the  drive  belts   rotate   the  now<br>
comlete   circuit  of   parking  platforms   until   the   desired<br><br><br><br>
cat  and  its   respective  parking  platform  are   located  in<br>
lift-well  20.     The  lift  mechanism  is   then  used  to  lower<br>
that  parking  platforst  with  its   car   to  ground  level.      The<br>
ampty  parking  platform  is,   in  consegueace,   rotated  into<br>
5       that   level   so   that   the  net  effect  is   that   an  occupied<br>
parking  platform  has  been  replaced  with  an  unoccupied<br>
parking  platform   (though  generally  in  a   different   location<br>
within  the  parking  level).<br>
10      If,   on  the  other  hamd,   a  car  is   to be  parked  at  that<br>
level,   which  includes  an  unoccupied  parking  platform,   the<br>
raised  parking  platform  40   is   initially  occupied  by  the<br>
car   to  ba  parked,   so  the  drive  belts   -  when  operated  0<br>
rotate  the  parked  car   out  of   the   lift  well   and  Continue   to<br>
15      rotate  until  the  unoccupied  parking  platform  is  located  in<br>
the   lift-well.     This  unoccupied  parking  platform  can  then<br>
be  lowered  by   the   lifting  mechanism  to   the  ground   level   to<br>
await   the  next  car  to  be  parked.     Preferably,   each  level<br>
is   left   in  a  configuration  where   any  unoccupied  parking<br>
20       platforms   are   adjacent   the   lift-well   so   that,    in   such<br>
circumstances,   a  minimal   amount  of   rotation  is   required  in<br>
order   to   translate  an  unoccupied  parking  platform  to  the<br>
lift-well.<br>
25      This  procedure  can  be   seen  more   clearly  in   figure  5,   which<br>
illustrates   a  plan  view  of   a   full  parking  level   60  from<br>
which   a  car   is   to  be  retrieved.      In   this   figure,   innex<br>
wall   12   and  outer  wall   14  have  been  omitted   for   the  sake<br>
of  clarity.<br>
Firstly,   an  empty  parting  platform  40   is  raised  by  the<br>
lifting  machgnism   (including   inner  lift  bracket   42   and<br>
outer   lift   bracket   44)    to   the   level   of  parking   level   60-<br>
At   that  point,   inner  lift  bracket  42   and,  outer   lift<br>
35       bracket   44   coincide,    respectively,   with  principal   inner<br>
bracket  32   and  principal  outer  bracket  36.     The  drive<br>
helts   (not  shown)   then  rotate  all  the  parking  platforms  of<br><br>
WO2004/041684                                                                                                        PCT/AU2003/001466<br>
level   50   (including  the  unoccupied  parking  platform  40)<br>
until   the  desired  car  and  its  respective  parking  platform<br>
ate  in  the  lift-well.     In  this  example,   the  desired  car  is<br>
cat  B  and  consequently,   as  this   embodiment   is   configured<br>
5       so   that   each  level   is   rotated  clockwise  when   seen  from<br>
above,   level   60   is  rotated  through  almost   a  complete<br>
Circuit  until   car   B   and  its   supporting  parking  platform<br>
are  aligned  with  the  lift-well,     This  procees  is   shown<br>
nearing  completion  in  figure   6,     It  will  be  understood<br>
10      that  principal   inner  bracket   32   and  principal  outer<br>
bracket  36  remain  stationary:   the  parking  platforms,<br>
driven  by  the  drive  beltsr   rotate  within   those  brackets.<br>
Referring  to   figure  1,   when  a  car  is  to  be  parked  at  the<br>
15      car  park,   it  enters  at  the  ground  level  onto  a  empty<br>
parking  platform   and  is   raised  by  lilting  mechanism  52   in<br>
which  there   is   at   least  one  vacant  parking  platform   64 .<br>
When  the   lifting  mechanism  has  raised  the  platform  65  with<br>
car  66   to   level   62   (as   shown   in  figure   7)    the  parking<br>
20      platforms  of  level   62   are  rotated  until  vacant  parking<br>
platform  64   coincides  with  the   lift-well   and   loaded<br>
parking  platform  66   is  out  of   the  lift-well.     At  this<br>
point  the  car   68   can  be   regarded  as  having  been<br>
appropriately  parked,   and   the   lifting  mechanism  can   lower<br>
25      vacant  parking  platform  64   to  ground  level  for  receiving<br>
another  car.<br>
Refering   to   figure  8A,   each  of  the  parking  platform  70,<br>
as   discussed  above,   is  provided  at   its   inner   face  72   and<br>
30      its  outer  face  74  with  teeth  that   engage   the  drive  belte<br>
I the   inner  of  which,  is  shown  at  52   in  figure   4) .     Each<br>
platform  70   has   a  size  suitable   to   receive   a  single   (in<br>
this   embodiment,   private)   vehicle   such  that   the  majority<br>
of  vehicles   cen  comfortably  be   accommodated.      Referring   to<br>
35       figure   8B,   in   this   embodiment   the  radial   length  76   of   each<br>
platform  70   is   opprorimatoly  5  m:   the  outer  periphery  74<br>
has  a  curved  length  of  approximately  3.34  m,   and  the  inner<br><br>
periphery 72   a   length of  approximately  2,1m,<br>
Referring to  figures  8C and 8D,   the upper  surface   82   of<br>
each parking platform 70  is provided,   at a distance 84   of<br>
5      approximately 1 m from its  inner periphery 72,  with a  stop<br>
buinp  86   (of  height  of   approximately 0.1m)   to   stop   a   car<br>
from driving too  far  towards   inner periphery 72   and<br>
thereby  colliding with the lifting mechanism,   the  inner<br>
core   12,   etc.     The upper  surface   82   is   also  patterned   to<br>
10      increase traction,   at lease   in those  regions  88 where  a<br>
vehicle's wheels  are  located when parked on  the  parking<br>
platform 70.     This patterning   assieta   a vehicle' s  ability<br>
to  brake when   entering   the parking   platform,   and   to<br>
commcnce  exiting  the parking  platform vrhen. desired,<br>

The car park is generally coutrolled centrally,   so  that  a<br>
database  in maitained of  occupied  and vacant  parking<br>
platforms.     Consequently,   when  a new vehicle  enters   the<br>
car park,   the  operation of  the  lifting mechanism and   the<br>
20       rotation of   the   correct  parking  level  can  proceed<br>
essentially automatioally,     To maximise   the  speed with<br>
which a car  is parked,   the   system will  generally  raise   and<br>
rotate a new car to the  lowest vacant parking platform.<br>
Once  a  car  has  been parked,   as   explained above   each<br>
25      packing  level   is  rotated  so   that any vacant parking<br>
platform is   adjacent   to   the   lift-well   suah  that   rotation<br>
of  that respective level by one parking platform clockewise<br>
will  move   that  vacant parking platform into   the  lift-well.<br>
30       It may be  advantageous   to provide more   than  one   exiting<br>
point   for a, car   to  exit,   each   situated  around   the  exit<br>
level.      In  one  embodiment,    the   driver  re-onters   the   car<br>
(after  its retrieval   from nome other  level)   and  - while<br>
the driver preparing for departure  -  is  rotated with the<br>
35      car  to  one of   the plurality of   axits.<br>
Each of   these exita  in this embodiment   is previded with a<br><br>
WO2004/041684                                                                                                        PCT/AU2003/001466<br>
set of  traffic lights,   with at least red  and green<br>
signals.     If the drivet  is  ready to exit,   he or  she   can<br>
drive out when a green signal   is  given.     if   the  signal<br>
returns   to  red before  the driver   is  ready   (indicating  that<br>
5       the  car will   shortly be   rotated  further,   perhaps   owing   to<br>
the  arrival or exiting of  another vehicle),   the driver<br>
need only wait  until  his   or  her  car haft been  rotated  to<br>
the noxt of  the plurality of exits.<br>
10      As  an alternative to the  drive for, rotating packing<br>
platforms   at  each level   shown in  figure  4,   in  a  further<br>
embodiment of  the  invention the platforms at each level<br>
are  instead driven by a drive  plattotm.     This platforms is<br>
similar to the parking platforms,   except that it has  an<br>
15       electric motor  and  -  as   it  is  not  required   to  accommobate<br>
a vehicle -  is narrower than the parking platforms.     The<br>
parking platforms are pushed or pulled by  the drive<br>
platform,   as is described below,<br>
20       Figure   9   is  a  schematic plan view  of  an  annular parking<br>
level  90   according  to  a  second preferred  embodiment  of   the<br>
present  invention.     the parking  level 90,   along with other<br>
like  levels,   is   located,   (as   in previous  embudiments)<br>
between the inner  cote 92   and an outer  supprotting<br>
25      structure  94  of a multilevel  cat park.<br>
The  level  90   comprises   a plurality of parking platforms   96<br>
and a drive platform. 98.     These are all  supported  on a<br>
pair of  counoentric rails or  tracks  100a,   100b laid around<br>
30      the level  90  apart from the  gap 102  that,   along with<br>
comparable  gaps  at  other  levels,   define   the   lift  shaft,<br>
(The   first  and second raile   100a,    100b  are  below  the<br>
platforms   96,   98,  but are   shown in this   figure  for<br>
explanatory purpoes.)<br>

Figure  10  is  a  schematic  view  in  cross  section  of  drive<br>
platform  98,     Drive  platform  98  has  two  pairs  of  wheela   (a<br><br>

first  pair  104  being  visible  in  this  figure,   joined  by<br>
axle   206)   that,   in  use,   are  located  in  rails   100a,   100b,<br>
The  drive  platform  98   also  has   an  electric  motor  108   that<br>
obtains  power  by  suitable  conventional  means.      This  can  be<br>
5      done,   for  example,   by  providing  a  live   third  rail  between<br>
the   firat  and  aecond  rails   100a,   100b.      Drive  platfrom  98<br>
need  have  only  three   states  of  operation:    stop,    forward<br>
and  reverse,   and  these  can  be  effected  by  controlling  the<br>
provision  of  power,   or  by  communicating  with,  a  controller<br>
10      (not   shown)   provided  on  drive  platform  98   by  conventional<br>
means.<br>
Vehicles  are  raised  and  lowered  within   the   lift  shaft<br>
essentially  as  described  above,   but  on  a  parking  platform<br>
15       identical   to  parking  platforms   96.      However,   this   platform<br>
is  raiced  and  lowered  on  a  hoist  platform  provided  with<br>
further  rail  segments   that,   when  aligned  with  level   90,<br>
allow  the  raised  or  lowered  platform  or  one   of  platforms<br>
96   to  move   from  or  onto   the   hoist  platform.<br>
20<br>
Thus,    in  use  drive  platform  is  only  activated  when   the<br>
hoist  platform  has  been  moved   to   level   90   and  thereby<br>
completed  the   ring  of  platforms  at   level   90-     Drive<br>
platform  98   is   then   activated   to   drive   the   complete<br>
25      circuit  of  platforms   in  the  appropriate  direction.     This<br>
direction  is  determined  according  to  whether   a  vehicla   is<br>
being  parked  or   retrieved.      If   a  vehicle   is   being  parked,<br>
the  packing  platform  hoisted  to   level   90   will  be   laden   and<br>
level   90  will   already  include   at   least  one  unladen  parking<br>
30       platform   95,      The   drive  platform   98   will   rotate   the<br>
platforms   to  move   the  unladen  parking  platform  96  nearest<br>
the   lift   shaft   towards   and   into   the   lift   shaft   (and<br>
thereby  onto  the  lift  hoist  platform)  .     The  lift  can  than<br>
lower  the  hoist  platform  with,  empty  parking  platform  for<br>
35       collection  of   another  vehicle.<br>
If  a  vehicle  is  being  retrieved,   the  lift  raises  an  empty<br><br>
WO2004/041684                                                                                                        PCT/AU2003/001466<br>
parking platform,   then the  drive platform  98  drives   the<br>
aircuit   of  platforms   until   the   requested  vehicle   is   in   the<br>
lift  shaft.     The   lift   can   then  lower  the  hoist  platform<br>
with parking platform and vehicle  to the  exit  level.<br>
5<br>
It  will  be understood  that   the drive platform is  only<br>
acitivited when an additional parking platform is  located<br>
in  lift  shaft,  gap   102,   so   coupling between   the  plstforms<br>
is  unnecessary.      Further,   drive platform  need not  enter<br>
10      the gap  102,   as  it  can be  driven  in both directions.<br>
However,    it might be   desirable  to  permit   it  to   cross   the<br>
gap  102    (while   the  hoist  platform  is   at   level   90)   to<br>
reduce  the time required to   affect   the required rotation<br>
of   the platforms.<br>
15<br>
This embodiment,  provides   a simpler  drive mechanism. for<br>
rotating  the  parking platforms,   as   only the  drive platform<br>
98  need be provided with a motor  or,   indeed,   any drive<br>
mechanism.     The parking platforme  96  are merely  shunted<br>
20      into plaoe as  reguired by  the  drive platform 98 .<br>
In  a  third preferred embodiment of   the present   invention,<br>
a, multi-level   car  park  is   provided  in whick a  plurality of<br>
concentric patking   levels,    each, comparable   to   —   for<br>
25       example   -   level   50   of   figure   5   or   level   90   of   figure   9 ,      A<br>
sohematic  view of   suck  an  arrangement  is   ahown  in  figure<br>
11,   employing   the  drive mechanism  shown   in   figures   9   and<br>
10.     Cars,   according   to   the present   invantion,   are  not<br>
hoisted  within  a central   core  or  outside   the  outer  wall  of<br>
10      the  car park,   but  rather within  a   lift   shaft  defined with<br>
each, level.     Consequently,    the   addition of   one   or more<br>
further  parking platforme   arranged  ground  an   innor  circuit<br>
of  parking platforme   need not  impede   the  parking or<br>
retrieval  of   cars.      Thus,   referring   to   figure   11,   inner<br>
35      circuit   90   of  parking  platforms   96    (with drive  platform<br>
98)   are   surrounded  by   furtbet  circuit  90'   of  parking<br>
platforms   95'    (with, drive  platform  98') .      Vehicles   to   be<br><br>

perked  in   or   retrieved   from   the   inner   circuit   90   of<br>
parking  pltforms   96   are  raised or  lowered  in lift  shaft<br>
110,   While  vehicles  to   be parked  in or   retriavad   trom  the<br>
outer  circuit   90'   of parking  platforms   96'   are  raised  or<br>
5      lowered in  lift   shaft  110'.<br>
In  this  embodiment,   different  entry  levels   are  used  for<br>
each circuit of parking platforms.<br>
10      In a fourth preferred embodiment of  the present invention,<br>
the car park performs all necessary tasks  to park the car,<br>
Figure  12  is   a perspective view of   this  car park 120   in<br>
situ   in  an urban  setting.     The  car park  120   comprises   a<br>
self-supporting  cylindrical   steel   superstructure  122   that<br>
15      can support   cars  or other vehicles,   each, of  up   to   2500   kg,<br>
and up   to   the  99  percentile vehicle  dimension,     The<br>
superstructure   122   can be built within an  existing<br>
building,   as   a  stand-alone  above ground structure,   or<br>
anderground.      In  addition,   car  park   120   comprises   a<br>
20       footings    (that will   be   dependent   on   the   soil   conditions) ,<br>
steel   support  columns  124   and   steel  beams.      A balustrade<br>
screen  126   at  each  level   can be provided   for  acethetic<br>
purposes where  required,   or  a   full   facade   ocreen can be<br>
added   (not   shown).<br>
25<br>
A representative  level   128   of   car  park  120   is  shown  in<br>
plan view   figures   13A to   13F,   togather with  approach<br>
driveway 130  (with tickst booth and book gata  132   and<br>
exemplary  car  134)   and turn-table  136,<br>
30<br>
Level   128   comprises  a  plurality  of  parking  compartments<br>
(in   this   example  sixteen) ,   each  in   the   form  of   a  vehicle<br>
parking  pallet   138,     As   in  the   above   embodiments,    the<br>
vehicle  parking  pallets   136   fill   the   entire   level   128,<br>
35      with  one   (pallets  140)   located   in  the   lift   shaft.     This<br>
pallet   140   snd   the   othex   corresponding  pallets   in   the<br>
other  levels  together  define  a  vertlcal  lift   though  as<br><br>
WO2004/041684                                                                                                        PCT/AU2003/001466<br>
will  now  be   appreciated,   the  identity  of  pallets   in  that<br>
lift  changes   as  the  car  park  is  used.<br>
The  pallets   138   in   level   128    (including  pallet   140)    are<br>
5       supported  on   a   circular   track   142,   comprising  a  pair   of<br>
concentric   rails,    for  the  horizontal   transport  of<br>
vehicles.      Pallets   138   are  moved  around  the   circular   track<br>
142  by  a  motorised  bar  unit  144   (comparable   to  drive<br>
platform   98   in   the   embodiment   of   figure   9)   between   a<br>
10      particular  pair  of   adjacent  pallets   138,   and  impact<br>
connections  between  other  pairs  of  adjacent  pallets   138,<br>
Thus,   when  a  vehiale  134   arrive  for  parking,   a  swipe  card<br>
is  issued  to  the  driver  that  identifies  that  vehicle<br>
15       throaughout  the  stacking   and  retrieval  process.     When  the<br>
driver  returns,   the   ewipe   card  will  activate   the   system,<br>
identify   the   required  vehicle,   and  return   that  vehicle   to<br>
the  exit  point.<br>
20      The  operation  of   the  system  is   fully  automated  via   a<br>
central  control  computer   (not  shown)   and  the<br>
aforementioned  swipe  card  system.<br>
This  vehiole   134  entars  the  car  park  driveway  130   and  stops<br>
25      at  a   ticket  booth,  and  book  gate   132,   where  a  swipe  card<br>
ticket  is  issued  to  the  driver.     The  ticket   issued  is<br>
identified  with  the  vehicle  and  its   awaiting  pallet.<br>
Referring   to   figure   13B,   the  boom  gate  opens  and  the  car<br>
30       134  proceeds   to   a   turn-table   136.      The   turn-tabls<br>
facilitates  accass   to  and  egrasa  from  the  car  park  120   for<br>
drivers.<br>
A  tranefer  pallet   (not   shown)   has  previously  been   located<br>
35       on   turn-table   136,    this   transfer  pallet   is   identical   in<br>
all  respects  with  other  pallets   138  being  in   fact  one  of<br>
those  pallets   (as  will  be  seen  below)  .     It   should  be  noted<br><br>
that   the  boom  gate  will   not   open  until   all  previous<br>
parking  operations  are  complete  and  the  access   area  is<br>
clear  of  all  ather  venicles.<br>
5      After   packing   the   vehicle   on   the   transfer  pallet  on   turn-<br>
table   136,   the  driver   switches   the   engine  off   and  all<br>
occupants  exit   the  vehicle   134.      The  driver  then  proceeds<br>
to   a  ticket  recognition  booth  148  beside   the   turn-table<br>
136   and  swipes   the  card   to  activate  the   automatic  parking<br>
10       system.      This  provides   security  against  activation  whilst<br>
the  driver  remains  in   the   car   134.      Following<br>
recognition/acceptance  of   ticket,   the   turn-table  136  will<br>
lock  the  vehicle  134   in  position  and  rotate  to  align   the<br>
ear  134  with.  the  lift.<br>
15<br>
Referring  to  figure  13C,   once  the   turn-table   136  with,<br>
transfer  pallet   146  end  car  134   are,  aligned,   the  pallet<br>
146  and  car  134   are  mechanically  advanced  towards  the  lift<br>
on  rails   150,      Once   in  position   in  the   lift   shaft,   pallet<br>
30       transfer   145   is   treated  as   any  other  pallet   138,   and  moved<br>
automatically  onto  a  lifting  mechanism  -  aligned  in<br>
anticipation  of   the   arrival  of   loaded  pallet   146   -   within<br>
the  lift   shaft.<br>
25      The  camputer  system  them  determines  the  optimum  stucking<br>
location  -within  the  car  park,   and  elevates  the  pallet  146<br>
to   the  appropriate  level   (see  the  partial  cross   sectional<br>
elevation  in  figure  13D)   on   lift  platform  152.<br>
30       Treating   level   128   as   the   level   on  which  car   134   is   to   be<br>
parked,   when  the  pallet   reaches   the  correct   level   (see<br>
figure   13E) ,   and   the  pallet  wheels   ore   aligned  with,  the<br>
circular  track  142,   the  motorized  bar  unit  144   is<br>
activated,     The  pallets   13B  on   this  level   (including<br>
35      loaded  pallet  146)   are   rotated  -  in  this   example<br>
comterolookwise  by  one  pallet   (i.e.   22. 5°)    -   by  bar  unit<br>
144   to   a  selected   final  arrangenment   (see   figure   13F) .<br><br>
WO2004/041684                                                                                                        PCT/AU2003/001466<br>
Bearing   in  mind   that   there   is   always   an   empty   segment   on<br>
each  full   level,   this   rotation  in   each  case  will   step  with<br>
an  empty  pallet  154  aligned  with  the  lift   shaft   (unless  it<br>
5       is   desired   to   immediately  add  or  retrieve   a  vehicle) ,<br>
That   is,   when   this   enpty  pallet   154   is   aligned  with   the<br>
lift  platfojTm  in  the   lift   shaft,   the  lift  platform  can<br>
return,  that  pallet  to   ground   level   in  preparation  for   a<br>
10      further  lift   and  stack  operation.   Alternatively,   if   a<br>
vehicle at that level is to be recovered and returned to<br>
gfound level, that pallet and vehicle will be located on<br>
the  lift  platform  for   roturn.<br>
15       for  vehicle   retrieval,    the   driver   returns   and  enters   the<br>
swipe   ticket   into   the  booth,   selecte   the   retrieve  option,<br>
and  the   system  automatically  retrieves   the  vehicle   from<br>
its   defined  location.      Between  parking   and   retrieving   any<br>
subject  vehicle,   the  system  may  have  perforated  a  number  of<br>
20      other  stacking  operations.<br>
For   retrieval  of  the  vehicles,   the  above-described  process<br>
is   reversed.<br>
25      All   storage   and  retrieval   activities   are   controlled  by   the<br>
central   computer,   with  sensors  within  the   lift   system,   on<br>
the  pallets   138   and  controlling   the  motorised   bar   unit<br>
144,     A   system  of  pallet   storage  and  control   at  ground<br>
level  minimises  wait   times   for  vehicles   entering   and<br>
30       leaving   the   car  park   120.<br>
In  this  embodiment,   horizontal   (i,e.   rotational)   pallet<br>
movement  can  be   effected  by  other  means.      Referring   to<br>
figure   14,   pallets  158   in  exemplary  level   160   can  be  moved<br>
35      around  the   circular   track  162   by  a   continuous   runner   chain<br>
254;   the   chain  has  connector  links    (not   shown)   to   the<br>
underside   of   each  pallet  158.      The   runner  chain   164   is<br><br>
WO2004/041684                                                                                                        PCT/AU2003/001466<br>

contained  in  a  guide  rail   (not  shown) ,   with  an   electric<br>
drive  motor   166  located  in  the  core  168   of   the   circular<br>
atructurs    (though  optionally  the  drive  motor  could  be<br>
located   in   on   the   perimeter)  .      The  mechanical   components<br>
5      of   the  system  in  this  variation  include  beams   for<br>
supporting  the   rails  of   the   track  162,   beams   for<br>
supporting  the  runner  chain   164,   and  other  equipment<br>
supporting.     All   ars  supported  on  secondary  steel   framing.<br>
10 In another variation, of this embodimant (shown in figure<br>
15), the pallets 170 are moved, around the circular track<br>
172 by powered friction wheels 174. The friction wheels<br>
174 are located approximately 45o apart around the inner<br>
perimeter  structure   176   and  the  outer  perimeter  structure<br>
15       178   of  each  level   180.     Additional   friation  wheels   182   are<br>
located  near  the  lift   shaft.<br>
In  another  embodiment,   the  arrangements  shown  in  figures<br>
13A   to   15   can  be   employed  with  a   dual   ring   car  park   (as<br>
20       described  by  referance   to   figure   11).      Thus,   figures   16A<br>
to  16F  are   comparable   to   figure  13A  to   13F,    except  that<br>
car  park   190   of   figures   16A   to   16F   includes   two   rings<br>
192a,192b   of   vehicle  pallets   194.      Each  of-these   rings<br>
132a., 192b ,   however,   opaxates   in  essentially  the   same  way<br>
25       as   -   for  example  -   the  ring  comprising  pallets   138   in   the<br>
embodiment  of  figures  13A  to  13F.<br>
Each  pallet  194  is   supported  on  a  respective  track<br>
196a,196b;   each  ring  192a, 192b  includee  a  respective<br>
30       motorised  drive  bar   unit   198a,l98b,      Each  ring   192a,192b<br>
can  therefore  be   rotated  indspendently  of   the   other,      For<br>
the  purposes  of   loading   a  car  200,   however,   only  the  outer<br>
ring   192b  of  palletn   194   is   initially  employed.      Thus   a<br>
car  200  is  loaded,  onto  a  pallet  on  turn-table  202   (see<br>
35 figures l6B and 16C) and advanced into the outer ring 192b<br>
and described above in the context of figures 13b and 13 C.<br>
By  the  approach  described  above   in  the   context  of   figures<br><br>
WO2004/041684                                                                                                        PCT/AU2003/001466<br>
13A  to  13F,   it   is   therefore  possible   to   locate   a  car  200<br>
In  a  final  pallet  194   in  the  outer  ring  192b.      However,<br>
referring  to   figrure   16D,   if  the  car  is   to  be   located  in<br>
the   inner  ring   192a,   the  car  200  and  the  pallet  204   on<br>
5       which   it   is  being  carried  are   firstly  raised   to   the   final<br>
level   206   at  which,  the  car  200   is   to  be  parked.     The   inner<br>
ring  of   this   level   (see   figure  16E)   will  have  previously<br>
been  rotated   so   that  an  empty  pallet   208   is   aligned  with<br>
the  lift  shaft   in  the  outer  ring,     Once  raised  to   the<br>
10      correct  level  206,   the  car  is  drawn  mechanically  from<br>
pallet 204 is the outer ring onto pallet 208 in the inner<br>
ring. The lnner ring is rotated (see figure 16F) so that<br>
an empty pallet 210 is again located adjacent to the lift<br>
shaft   212   of   the  outer  ring,   and  to  carry  the   car  200   to<br>
15      its  final  location  214.<br>
Figures   17   and  18   are  double  ring  versions   of   the<br>
variations  of   the  previous  embodiment.   shown   in  figures   14<br>
and  15,      In   figure   17,   each  of   inner  ring  216a  and  outer<br>
20       ring   216b   is   provided,  with  its  own  respective  continous<br>
runner  chain  216a,2l8b  and  respective   electric  drive  motor<br>
220a,220b.      With  separate  drive  motors  220a,22Db,   inner<br>
and  outer  ringa   216a,216b  can  be   rotated  independently.<br>
25       In   figure   18,   each  of   inner   ring   222a   and  outer   ring   222b<br>
is  provided  with  itd   own  respective   set  of  powered<br>
friction  wheels   2243a, 224b.      Again,   this  means   that   inner<br>
and  outer  rings   222a,222b  can  be   rotated  independently.<br>
30       Thus,   the   embodintents   of   figures   12   to   13   provide   car  park<br>
systerns   than  can  ha  built  above  or  below  ground,   eliminate<br>
vehlole  exhaust   emiseions   during   car  park   access   and   the<br>
parking  process,   and  minimises  land  area  required.     The<br>
steel-framed  structure  allows  off-site   fabrication,   rapid<br>
35      on-site   installation,   and  hence  minimal  on-site   labour-<br>
These   systems   are  relatively  quiet,   and  provides   a  high<br>
degree  of  security  for  parked  vehicles.<br><br>
