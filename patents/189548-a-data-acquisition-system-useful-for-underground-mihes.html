				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a data acquisition system useful for underground mines. This invention particularly relates to a microprocessor based intrinsically safe data acquisition system.<br>
In underground mines electrical signals equivalent to measured values of various parameters such as methane, carbon monoxide, air velocity, temperature, pressure etc. are transmitted from various areas in the underground mines to a central place at surface.<br>
In presently known data acquisition systems, a same or different pair of telephone cable is used for transmission of data from different areas in mine. The system generally consists of data stations underground, linked with a central console at surface with single/different pair of cables. Power supply for underground units is generally taken from underground power source using flame proof (FLP) structure and a chargeable battery is kept as an alternative source of power. In some cases charging of the battery is used which is either charged from surface through same pair of cable or periodically brought to surface for charging.<br>
These above described systems have<br>
the drawbacks such as: (i)  use of FLP structure in underground areas<br>
is    generally   not    preferred    if<br>
intrinsically safe (I.S) circuit can be<br>
designed; (ii) placement of local batteries underground<br>
creates maintenance problem; (iii)charging from surface requires additional<br>
pair   of cables which increases cost of<br>
cable; (iv) these    arrangements    require    more<br>
electronic equipment at underground which<br>
is   generally   not   preferred   from<br>
maintenance point of view.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide data acquisition system useful for underground mines which obviates the above noted drawbacks.<br>
We have found by our research and development efforts that:<br>
(i)by using microprocessor based switching, it is Possible to share intrinsically safe (I.S. ) power from surface to underground units and data from underground units to surface, on the same pair of cable, thereby reducing cost of cable.<br>
(ii) It is further possible to share power for methane sensor, power for underground data station and data from underground to surface on time division multiplexing (TDM) mode.<br>
(iii)Using a microprocessor based underground data station it is possible to simplify electronic circuitry for ease of maintenance.<br>
(iv)Any form of modem acoustical or optical could be avoided for data transmission up to 4 kilometers between underground data station and central console using input/output port (RS232C/RS422).<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides the data acquisition system useful for underground mines which comprises one or more underground data stations (1)( fig.l), the said data station consists of appropriate sensor (4)(fig.3), output of the said data station being connected to the input of a signal processor (5)(fig.3), the said signal processor (5) being connected to an analog to digital converter (8)(fig.3) of an underground microprocessor board (6)(fig.3) through a data link (2)(fig.3), serial port (9)(fig.3) of the said underground microprocessor board being connected to a surface microprocessor 10)(fig.4) of surface data station (3)(fig.l), the said surface microprocessors being connected to a personal computer (1 l)(flg.4), the said sensors, signal processor, underground and surface microprocessors and the personal computer all being connected to an stablised intrinsically safe power supply (7)(fig.7).<br>
The system will now be described with the help of diagrams of the drawings accompanying this specification.<br>
The data acquisition system according to the present invention consists of the following features as shown in the figure 1 and to 9<br>
I	underground data station, its number depending upon the number of districts<br>
(locations)<br>
II	Data link<br>

Figure 8 represents sharing of power and data on same cable using time division multiplexing for single data station.<br>
Figure 9 represents sharing of power and data on same cable using time division multiplexing by different data stations.<br>
(i) Underground data station: - A number of data stations (1) are connected with separate cable (2) as shown in figure 1 or share the same common bus as shown in figure 2.  An<br>
underground data station as shown in figure 3, comprises of different sensors (4), signal processors (5), microprocessor board (6) and an intrinsically safe stablised power Supply (7) with switching arrangement. An intrinsically safe power is fed from surface to under ground data station. The intrinsically safe power supply itself is powered by an uninterruptible power supply at surface<br>
Sensors: The output of all sensors (4) such as methane, carbon monoxide, air velocity, pressure, temperature has to be maintained between 0 to +5 volt for full scale deflection of parameters in question.<br>
Signal processor: The signal processor (5) is based on operational amplifier such as IC 741 op-Amp which is commercially available. The input signal from each sensor is in millivolts and is fed to the signal processor. The signal processor amplifies the signal to give it in the range of 0-5 volts D.C. This voltage is fed to the analog to digital converter (ADC) of the microprocessor board for further processing.<br>
Microprocessor board: The microprocessor board (6) used for the purpose are commercially available and generally comprises<br>
of following parts: 8 or 16 bit central processor, one or more no. of 2-64 KB of Read Only Memory, one or more no. of 2-64 KB of Read and Write memory, one 8 to 256 channel analog to digital converter using combination of 8 or 16 channel ADC(8) in cascade form, one or more no. of parallel port, one or more no. of serial port (9) one no. of programmable interval timer , one no. of keyboard interface and one or more stabilized power supply(7)powered from surface.<br>
(ii) Data link: The data link (2) is voice grade twisted pair copper cable of 0.5-1.0 millimeter (mm) diameter. In the case of multi channel link, line driver is provided at both ends. And in case of unichannel in the form of loop, T type connections are taken from this loop as required. There is a common line driver at surface data station and one line driver at the end of each T. A switching device is provided for poling of each underground data station by the surface data station. The line driver converts the TTL (transistor transistor logic) level signal into a maximum of ± 25 volt signal. At the receiving end the signal so received is converted to TTL level signal. With the technique developed it is possible to employ simple line drivers upto distance of 4 km. for mining applications.<br>
(iii)Surface data station: The surface data station is shown in figure 4 while its connection with data link and interconnection between two microprocessors is shown in figure 5. The surface data station comprises of (a) two microprocessor boards (10), (b) one PC-XT or PC/AT (IBM compatible) (11), (c) intrinsically safe power supply (12) and (d) uninterruptible power supply system (13).The two microprocessor boards are similar to the boards as used for underground data station except the surface microprocessor board does not have the analog to digital converter or digital to analog converter. Both the microprocessors remain in ON position all the time while one remains in operation. The other remains as standby.<br>
(iv)Intrinsically  Safe  Power  Supply:    The<br>
intrinsically safe power supply has been shown in figure 6. The power supply comprises of the following blocks<br>
1.	Signal Generator (17)<br>
2.	Amplifier (18)<br>
3.	Surface transformer  (19)  with associated<br>
circuitry<br>
4.	Underground transformer (27)with associated<br>
circuitry.<br>
1.	Signal generator (17): This produces an<br>
audio frequency in the range of 2-4 KHz. This<br>
audio frequency signal is fed to the second<br>
block i.e. amplifier (18) as shown in<br>
figure 6.<br>
2.	Amplifier (18): The amplifier is shown in<br>
figure 6. The audio frequency (A.F.) signal<br>
received from the signal generator is then<br>
amplified and fed as input to the surface<br>
transformer (19) .<br>
3.	Surface   transformer  with   associated<br>
circuitry:  The  third  block  consists  of<br>
transformer(29)  limiting  Resistance  (20),<br>
zeners  (21,  22,  23,  24),  bridge rectifiers<br>
(25,26) and silicon controlled rectifier (28).<br>
The transformer (19) has the turn ratio of<br>
4:100 to 8:1000 while the limiting resistance<br>
(20) (440-500 Ohm, 10W) is put across the arm.<br>
There are four zeners FZ60 (21,22,23,24), two<br>
each  placed  back  to  back.  Each  bridge<br>
rectifier (25) and (26) has four diodes (2-6<br>
Amp. rating) . The SCR (28) used has the peak<br>
inverse voltage of 200-600V.<br>
The input received by the primary of the transformer gives an audio frequency output between 30-90 V and a current of 15-50 mA. This output is fed to the underground transformer (27) of intrinsically safe power supply.<br><br>
4. Underground transformer with associated circuitry: The fourth block consists of transformer (27), filter circuit (29) and zeners (30). The underground transformer (27) has the turn ratio to suit various voltages required.<br>
Operation of the equipment: - The operation of the system is described with the help of figure 7 and 8 for multichannel and 7 and 9 for unichannel system, respectively.<br>
Intrinsically safe power needed for sensor,  microprocessor  boards  and  signal processor is fed in different units of time, in  time  division  multiplexing  (TDM)  mode. Similarly, power to different data stations are fed in different time frames in TDM mode. In between these two time  frames  for two consecutive data stations,  a time frame is added   for   transmission   of   data   from underground to surface data station. Each time frame may vary from 1 millisecond to  100 milliseconds  depending  upon  the  data  scan rate.  When power  to  any data  station  is switched off and a time frame is kept free for data transmission, power is stored with the help    of    capacitors.    This    enables microprocessor based switching of power and data on same pair of conductor. While power is being sent to any particular data station and data is being transmitted by the data station,<br>
all the other data stations connected on same pair of conductor remain non-functional.<br>
The main advantage of the present invention are :<br>
1.	There are no flame proof enclosures underground;<br>
2.	There are no batteries underground;<br>
3.	No power is taken from 110 V underground source.<br>
4.	The equipment has higher degree of safety since only intrinsically safe power is used.<br>
5.	With microprocessor based switching, intrinsically safe power can be fed from surface without use of additional cable.<br><br><br><br>
