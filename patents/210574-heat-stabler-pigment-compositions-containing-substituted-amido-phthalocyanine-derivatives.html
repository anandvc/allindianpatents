PIGMENT COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING SUBSTITUTED AMIDO PHTHALOCYANINE DERIVATIVES<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD.<br>
The present invention relates to novel compositions suitable for use as coatings comprising a) pigment and b) substituted amido phthalocyanines.The novel compositions are valuable for the delivery of excellent flow (non -flocculating) properties in ink and paint coatings as well as excellent heat stabilizing properties in thermoplastic resins.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
The use of phthalocyanine (Pc) derivatives in pigment compositions is known.Typically phthalocyanine derivatives can be utilized in surface coating compositions such as inks, paints and plastics to impart improved flow behaviour (reduced flocculation); dispensability ; heat stability and the like.<br>
GB949739 describes the use of non flocculating phthalocyanine preparations which contain as the relevant stabilising agent, substituted amino methyl phthalocyanine compounds having the formula:<br><br>
in which Pc is an m-valent phthalocyanine residue; R1 and R1, independently, are hydrogen or an optionally substituted aliphatic residue, or the group - NR1R1 is a heterocyclic residue, and m is 1,2,3 or 4.<br>
In GB2009205. phthalocyanine compositions are disclosed comprising a) a phthalocyanine pigment b) a substituted amino methyl amido methyl phthalocyanine compound having the formula:<br><br><br>
in which Pc is the n-valent residue of a metal free or metal phthalocyanine; R1 is hydrogen , alkyl, cycloalkyi, hydroxyalkyl, amino alkyl or aralkyl; ,R1 is alky!, cycloalkyi, hydroxyalkyl, amino alkyl or aralkyl; or R1 and R2 may be combined, with N-atom to form a 5 - 6 - or 7 membered heterocyclic ring ; I is 1 , 2 , 3 , or 4 and nisi ,2,3,4,5,6,7 or 8; and c) a polyvalent metal salt of an anionic surface active agent.<br>
in EP 0087713 there are described phthalocyanine preparations, having improved colorist properties and improved technical properties in application, comprising a) a finely divided phthalocyanine pigment; and b) a quarterlies amino alkyl amido methyl phthalocyanine compound having the formula:<br><br>
in which Pc is an n -valent phthalocyanine residue, optionally containing up to two chlorine atoms ; Ri and R2 independently , are C2 - Ce alkyl or C2 - C4 hydroxyalkyl; R3 is Ci - C14 alkyl, C2 - C4 hydroxyalkyl, 2-hydroxy-3-chlorpropyl or benzyl; X is one equivalent of an anion; z is 1 or 2; and n is 1,2,3 or 4.<br>
In GB695523, imide methyl and amido methyl phthalocyanine pigments are produced by reacting phthalocyanine with a hydroxymethylimide of formula:<br><br>
in which R is a divalent radical, eg. methylene or a o-perylene, resulting in the introduction, into the phthalocyanine molecule, of groups of formyI:<br><br>
in which R has its previous significance.<br><br><br><br><br>
Wherein R and R1 can be independently selected from the groups previously stated by formula 1, Z is the hydrochloride or the hydrogen sulphate salt of the amine.<br>
It is an object of this present invention is to describe and propose several pigment compositions which are based on the synthesised derivatives defined by formula I. It is a further object of the present invention to provide coatings compositions such as ink,paint and plastics comprising the substituted amido phthalocyanine pigment compositions.The particular substituted amido phthalocyanine pigment compositions according to the present invention are valuable for the delivery of excellent flow (non -flocculating) properties of ink and paint coatings as well as excellent heat stabilising properties in thermoplastic resins.<br>

coating media, in particular printing inks and paints, to which they can impart excellent flow (non-flocculating) behaviour. Compounds denoted by formula I can also impart excellent heat stabilizing properties to pigments used in thermoplastic resin compositions.<br>
The following non - limiting examples illustrate the compositions according to the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1.<br>
A.	Preparation of Mono Propvlamido Copper Phthalocyanine<br>
5g of copper phthalocyanine mono carboxamide (88% Pure) and 10g of propylamine hydrochloride were mixed well manually and heated to 280X for 2 hour using an iso-mantle. Reaction mixture was allowed to cool to 60°C and recurred by addition of water at 80 ""C, filtration of the slurry and further washing with 80 X water was carried out to remove excess amine hydrochloride. The filtered ,washed product was dried at 70'C in an oven to give 4.52g of mono propylamido copper phthalocyanine.<br>
The FTIR spectrum of the CuPc carboxamide starting material and that of the final product are clearly different. Very strong peaks appear at 2900cm*'* and 2850cm'' in the propylamido CuPc but not in that of the CuPc monocarboxamide. This is strong evidence for, and very characteristic of alkyl stretching activity which can be associated with the propyl group.<br>
B.	Preparation of pigment composition<br>
5.6 g of the product from 1A and 71 g of copper phthalocyanine are dry milled together in a Vibrato 0.6 litre mill pot containing 2315 g of 1.27 cm steel balls and 530 g roofing tacks, for 3 hours and 51 minutes. The pigment powder was then discharged through an Endecotts sieve pan.<br>
C.	Preparation of ink.<br>
To prepare,<br>
Mixed resinate - Calcium/Zinc resinate	64 g<br>
Toluene	18 g<br><br>
Pigment powder from IB	18 g<br>
Glass beads (2mm diameter)	-  300 g<br>
are charged to a 250ml beadily pot and beadmilled for 30 mins at 2000rpm with water cooling to keep at room temperature. Mapbase is discharged and let down using the following let down vehicle:-<br>
Mixed resinate- Calcium/Zinc resinate	100 g<br>
Toluene	60 g<br>
A 1:1 ratio of mill base and let down vehicle are blended and shaken before filling an efflux cup and measuring in seconds the discharge rate of the ink from the cup The resultant ink exhibits improved flow compared to example 4. Table I<br>
EXAMPLE 2.<br>
A. Preparation of Dodecvlamido Copper Phthalocyanine<br>
19.4g of dodecylamine was placed in a round bottom flask and hydrochloride gas bubbled continuously through the amine for about 1 hour with gentle heat about SO'C to form dodecylamine hydrochloride. 5g of CuPc monocarboxamide was then added and thoroughly mixed together manually. The mixture was heated to 280°C and held for 2 hours. The reaction mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature then re-slurried in a minimum quantity of chloroform, and added slowly portionwise to approx 400mis of ethanol with stirring. Filtration and washing with ethanol was carried out and the product dried at 70 °C in an oven to give 4.69g mono dodecylamido CuPc.<br>
The FITR Spectrum of the CuPc carboxamide and the final product are clearly different. Very strong peaks appear at 2900cm"' and 2850cm'' in the dodecylamido CuPc but not in that of the CuPc monocarboxamide. This is strong evidence for, and very characteristic of alkyl stretching activity which can be associated with the dodecyl group.<br>
MALDI-TOF mass spectra of the CuPc carboxamide and the final product are also clearly different. In the final product the mass spectra clearly shows the presence of mono dodecyl<br><br>
amido CuPc by an intense peak at 790 m/z. The starting material has no corresponding peaks at this mass to charge ratios.<br>
B.	Preparation of pigment composition<br>
5.6 g of product from 2A is dry milled with copper phthalocyanine according to the method described in 1B.<br>
C.	Preparation of ink.<br>
The resultant ink from 2B when assessed according to procedure 1C exhibits improved flow compared to example 4. Table I<br>
EXAMPLE 3.<br>
A.	Preparation of Octadecvlamido Copper Phthalocyanine<br>
5g of copper phthalocyanine mono carboxamide 88% Pure and 32g of octacdecylamine hydrochloride are mixed well manually and heated to ZBO1'C for 2 hours using an isomantle. Reaction mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature and the product isolated as for Example 2A, to give 4.91 g mono octadecylamido CuPc.<br>
FTIR spectra of starting material and final product were clearly different with very strong peaks at 2900cm"' and 2850cm'1 for the final product, but not in the case of the GuPc carboxamide. This is strong evidence, and characteristic of alkyI stretching activity associated with the octadecyl group. Maldi-toff mass spectra of the final product highlights an intense peak at 874 m/z which represents mono octadecylamido CuPc. The starting material has no corresponding peaks at this mass to charge (m/z) ratio.<br>
