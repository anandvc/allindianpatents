				<td>The present invention relates to a high strength cold<br>
rolled steel sheet used for automobiles, home appliances, or<br>
the like, in particular, to a high strength cold rolled<br>
steel sheet having superior press formability and a tensile<br>
strength TS of 340 MPa or more, and to a manufacturing<br>
method thereof.<br>
Background Art<br>
Heretofore, for automobile panel parts having a<br>
complicated shape such as a side panel or a door inner panel,<br>
which are difficult to be press formed, interstitial free<br>
(IF) cold rolled steel sheets (270E, F) having superior deep<br>
drawability and stretchability and a TS of around 270 MPa,<br>
have been widely used.<br>
In recent years, due to increasing needs of lighter<br>
weight and higher strength of automobile bodies, a high<br>
strength cold rolled steel sheet having a TS of 340 MPa or<br>
more, and particularly, 390 MPa or more, has been<br>
- 2 -<br><br>
progressively applied to those parts which are difficult to<br>
be press formed.  In addition, as is the case described<br>
above, there has also been a trend to apply a higher<br>
strength cold rolled steel sheet to inner parts or the like,<br>
in which a high strength cold rolled steel sheet has been<br>
used, so as to further reduce automobile weight by<br>
decreasing the number of reinforcement parts or by<br>
decreasing the thickness thereof.<br>
However, when the strength of the high strength cold<br>
rolled steel sheet used in automobile panels is further<br>
increased, and the thickness thereof is further decreased,<br>
the occurrence of surface strain is remarkably increased due<br>
to the increase in yield strength Y5, the decrease in work<br>
hardening coefficient n value, and the decrease in the<br>
thickness.  This surface strain is a defect such as an<br>
undulation or a wrinkle brought out on a surface of steel<br>
sheet after press forming and deteriorates dimensional<br>
precision or appearance of press formed panel.  Therefore,<br>
when a high strength cold rolled steel sheet is applied to<br>
parts which are difficult to be press formed such as<br>
automobile panel parts, the steel sheet must have superior<br>
resistance to surface strain and excellent stretchability,<br>
and more particularly, the steel sheet having a YS of 270<br>
MPa or less and a na_10 of 0.20 or more is preferably desired.<br>
Here, the n1_10 is a work hardening coefficient calculated<br>
- 3  -<br><br>
from the stresses at strains of 1 % and 10 % of a stress-<br>
strain curve obtained from a tensile test.<br>
In order to decrease a yield ratio YR (=YS/TS), a<br>
method has been well known, in which a Ti or Nb added steel<br>
having the amount of C and N decreased as small as possible<br>
is hot rolled and coiled at a temperature of 680 Â°C or more<br>
to decrease the number of precipitates containing Ti or Nb<br>
and thereby to promote grain growth at annealing after cold<br>
rolling.  In addition, in Japanese Unexamined Patent<br>
Application Publication No. 6-108155 and Japanese Patent No.<br>
3291639, methods for promoting grain growth have been<br>
disclosed in which the amounts of C and S of Ti added steel<br>
are controlled to bring about Ti(C, S) precipitates in order<br>
to suppress the formation of fine TiC precipitates.<br>
The above-mentioned methods are effective for a cold<br>
rolled mild steel sheet having a TS of approximately 270 MPa.<br>
However, when the grain growth is promoted, the TS is also<br>
decreased simultaneously as the YS is decreased, and<br>
therefore the methods are not always effective for a high<br>
strength cold rolled steel sheet having a TS of 340 MPa or<br>
more.  That is, since the decrease in TS must be compensated<br>
for by addition of alloying elements such as Si, Mn, or P,<br>
problems may arise in that a manufacturing cost is increased,<br>
surface defects take place, a YS of 270 MPa or less is not<br>
obtained, and the like.  For example, when the steel sheet<br>
- 4 -<br><br>
is strengthened by addition of Si, Mn, and P, accompanied by<br>
the grain growth of approximately 10 M m to 20 \i m in grain<br>
size, the steel sheet can only be obtained having a YS<br>
approximately 10 MPa smaller than that of a conventional<br>
high strength cold rolled steel sheet, and in addition, the<br>
resistance to the occurrence of orange peel and the anti-<br>
secondary work embrittlement of the steel sheet also<br>
deteriorates.<br>
On the other hand, in Japanese Unexamined Patent<br>
Application Publication Nos. 2001-131681, 2002-12943, and<br>
2002-1294 6, methods have been disclosed in which, without<br>
promoting grain growth, the YS is decreased and the high n<br>
value is obtained.  According to the methods described above,<br>
the amount of C is controlled to approximately 0.004 to<br>
0.02 %, which is larger than that of a conventional ultra<br>
low carbon steel sheet, and grain refinement and<br>
precipitation strengthenings are positively applied in order<br>
to decrease the YS by approximately 20 MPa than that of a<br>
conventional ultra low carbon IF steel sheet.<br>
However, when a high strength cold rolled steel sheet<br>
having a TS of approximately 390 MPa or 440 MPa is<br>
manufactured by the methods described above, the YS exceeds<br>
270 MPa, and it becomes difficult to perfectly suppress the<br>
occurrence of the surface strain.<br>
- 5 -<br><br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a high<br>
strength cold rolled steel sheet having a TS of 340 MPa or<br>
more, in which YS^270 MPa and n1_10^0.20 are satisfied, and<br>
a manufacturing method thereof, the steel sheet having<br>
superior surface strain resistance and press formability.<br>
This object can be achieved by a high strength cold<br>
rolled steel sheet composed of ferrite grains having an<br>
average grain diameter of 10 ï­ m or less, in which the<br>
average number per unit area (hereinafter referred to as<br>
"average area density") of Nb(C, N) precipitates having a<br>
diameter of 50 nm or more in the ferrite grains is 7.0X10 <br>
ï­m2 or less, and a zone (hereinafter referred to as "PFZ")<br>
having a width of 0.2 to 2.4 ï­ m. and an average area density<br>
of NbC precipitates of 60 % or less of that of the central<br>
portion of the ferrite grains is formed along grain<br>
boundaries of the ferrite grains.<br>

obtained, for example, by a high strength cold rolled steel<br>
sheet consisting of 0.004 to 0.02 % of C, 1.5 % or less of<br>
Si, 3 % or less of Mn, 0.15 % or less of P, 0.02 % or less<br>
of S, 0.1 to 1.5 % of sol.Al, 0.001 to 0.007 % of N, 0.03 to<br>
0.2 % of Nb, by mass, and the balance of Fe and inevitable<br>
- 6 -<br><br>
impurities.<br>
In addition, this high strength cold rolled steel sheet<br>
can be manufactured by a manufacturing method comprising the<br>
steps of: hot rolling a steel slab having the composition<br>
described above into a hot rolled steel sheet after heating<br>
the steel slab at a heating temperature SRT which satisfies<br>
the following equations (3) and (4); and pickling and cold<br>
rolling the hot rolled steel sheet, followed by annealing<br>
within a temperature range of a ferrite phase above the<br>
recrystallization temperature.<br>

Embodiments of the Invention<br>
1. Control of Precipitates Containing Nb<br>
The inventors of the present invention investigated how<br>
- 7 -<br><br>
to decrease the YS of a high strength cold rolled steel<br>
sheet and clarified that a high strength cold rolled steel<br>
sheet having a YS of 270 MPa or less, an n1_10 of 0.20 or<br>
more, and a TS of 340 MPa or more can be obtained when the<br>
steel sheet is composed of ferrite grains having an average<br>
grain diameter of 10 ï­m or less, in which the average area<br>
density of Nb(C, N) precipitates having a diameter of 50 nm<br>
-2    2<br>
or more is controlled to 7.0X10 /ï­m or less, and a zone<br>
having a width of 0.2 to 2.4 ï­ m and an average area density<br>
of NbC precipitates of 60 % or less of that of the central<br>
portion of the ferrite grains is formed along grain<br>
boundaries of the ferrite grains.<br>
The Nb(C, N) precipitates having a diameter of 50 nm or<br>
more are formed at hot rolling to have a diameter of<br>
approximately 50 nm, do not become larger even at annealing<br>
after cold rolling, and are uniformly dispersed in the<br>
ferrite grains.<br>
On the other hand, the NbC precipitates at the center<br>
of the ferrite grains are formed at annealing, the diameter<br>
of which is approximately 10 nm, and the NbC precipitates in<br>
the PFZ are formed in such a way that fins precipitates<br>
having a diameter of approximately 2 nm uniformly formed at<br>
hot rolling are coarsened to have a diameter of<br>
approximately 50 nm by the Ostwald-ripening.<br>
The average area density of NbC and Nb(C, N)<br>
- 8  -<br><br>
precipitates was measured as described below using a<br>
transmission electron microscope at a magnification of 5610<br>
times and an accelerating voltage of 300 kV.<br>
As to the Nb<c n precipitates having a diameter of></c>
ran or more uniformly formed in the ferrite grains, arbitrary<br>
50 portions therein were selected, the number of Nb(C, N)<br>
precipitates existing in a circle of 2 ï­ m in diameter<br>
centered at each of the portions was measured to calculate<br>
the number per unit area (area density), and finally the<br>
average was obtained therefrom.<br>
The average area density of NbC precipitates in the<br>
central portion of the ferrite grains was obtained in the<br>
same manner as described above.<br>
As to the NbC precipitates in the PFZ, arbitrary 50<br>
precipitates coarsened by the Ostwald-ripening were selected.<br>
For each of the NbC precipitates, a circle inscribed with<br>
the NbC and the grain boundary adjacent to the NbC was<br>
described, the number of NbC precipitates existing in the<br>
circle was measured to obtain the area density, and the<br>
average of the area density was then calculated.<br>
The width of the PFZ was obtained as the average of the<br>
diameters of the above 50 circles.<br>
The high strength cold rolled steel sheet of the<br>
present invention has the central portion of ferrite grain<br>
in which fine NbC precipitates having the diameter of<br>
- 9 -<br><br>
approximately 10 nm are formed at a high density and the PFZ<br>
along the grain boundary in which coarse NbC precipitates<br>
having the diameter of approximately 50 nm are formed at a<br>
low density.  It is considered that a low YS and a high n<br>
value can be obtained because the soft PFZ is deformed by a<br>
low stress at the initial stage of the plastic deformation,<br>
and that a high TS can be obtained due to the hard central<br>
portion of ferrite grain.<br>
As previously mentioned, the fine NbC precipitates<br>
having a diameter of approximately 2 nm are uniformly formed<br>
at the hot rolling and coarsen into the precipitates having<br>
the diameter of approximately 50 nm on the grain boundary of<br>
recrystallized ferrite grains at annealing in a continuous<br>
annealing line (CAL) or a continuous galvanizing line (CGL)<br>
after cold rolling.  Therefore, the PFZ is believed to be<br>
formed due to promotion of grain boundary migration.<br>
In order not to make ferrite grains extremely coarse,<br>
the recrystallized grains should be preferably as fine as<br>
possible, and the PFZ can be more effectively formed.<br>
2. Chemical Composition<br>
As a high strength cold rolled steel sheet of the<br>
present invention, for example, there may be mentioned a<br>
cold rolled steel sheet consisting of 0.004 to 0.02 % of C,<br>
1.5 % or less of Si, 3 % or less of Mn, 0.15 % or less of P,<br>
0.02 % or less of S, 0.1 to 1.5 % of sol.Al, 0.001 to<br>
- 10 -<br><br>
0.007 % of N, 0.03 to 0.2 % of Nb, by mass, and the balance<br>
of Fe and inevitable impurities.  C, Nb., and sol.Al play a<br>
very important role in the control of NbC and Nb(C, N)<br>
precipitates, and the amounts of C, Nb, and sol.Al must be<br>
controlled as follows.<br>
C: Since C is combined with Nb, C plays an important<br>
role in the control of NbC and Nb(C, N) precipitates.  The<br>
amount of C is set to 0.004 to 0.02 %, preferably 0.004 to<br>
0.01 %.<br>
Nb: In order to control the NbC and Nb{C, N)<br>
precipitates, the amount of Nb is set to 0.03 % or more.<br>
However, when the amount of Nb exceeds 0.2 %, the increase<br>
in the rolling load at the hot rolling and the cold rolling<br>
causes the decrease in productivity or the increase in cost.<br>
Therefore, the amount of Nb is set to 0.2 % or less.<br>
In order to increase r value, ([Nb]/ [C])X(12/93) 
preferably satisfied, and the ([Nb]/[C]) X (12/93) is more<br>
preferably 1.5 to 3.0.<br>
sol.Al: Even when the amount of C is controlled to<br>
0.004 to 0.02 %, and the amount of Nb is controlled to 0.03<br>
to 0.2 %, Ys of 270 MPa or less may not always be obtained<br>
in some cases.  It is considered to be due to coarse Nb(C,<br>
N) precipitates formed at hot rolling.  As the above-<br>
mentioned, it is believed that the coarse Nb(C, N)<br>
precipitates having the diameter of approximately 50 nm<br>
- 11  -<br><br>
which is formed at the hot rolling have difficulties to be<br>
coarsened by the Ostwald-ripening at annealing because of<br>
the large size and the smaller solubility in ferrite than<br>
that of NbC precipitates, and the suppression of the PFZ<br>
formation leads to the suppression of the decrease in YS.<br>
Then, the inventors of the present invention<br>
investigated a method for the formation of NbC precipitates<br>
effective for forming PFZ by suppressing coarse Nb(C, N)<br>
precipitates having a diameter of 50 nm or more, and found<br>
that the addition of 0.1 % or more of sol.Al is effective.<br>
It has been believed that-N is combined with Al to form<br>
A1N.  However, in steel containing 0.004 % or more of C and<br>
0.03 % or more of Nb, precipitation of Nb(C, N) takes place<br>
at finish rolling before A1N starts to precipitate.  When<br>
the amount of Al is increased to 0.1 % or more so that A1N<br>
is precipitated before Nb(C, N) is precipitated, the<br>
precipitation of NbC effective for forming the PFZ can be<br>
proceeded.<br>
Fig. 1 shows the relationship between the amount of<br>
sol.Al and YS, n value and r value.<br>
The results shown in Fig. 1 were obtained by<br>
investigating YS, r value, and n value of cold rolled steel<br>
sheets containing 0.0060 % of C, 0 to 0.45 % of Si, 1.5 to<br>
2 % of Mn, 0.02 % of P, 0.002 % of S, 0.003 % of N, 0.0005 %<br>
of B, 0.11 % of Nb, and 0.01 to 1.7 % of sol.Al, which are<br>
- 12 -<br><br>
heated at 1150 0C and 1250 0C, followed by the hot rolling to<br>
3 mm thick in the y region and coiling at 560 0C, and<br>
subsequently cold rolled to 0.8 mm thick, followed by<br>
annealing at 820 0C for 80 seconds.  Since the increases in<br>
TS by the addition of one percent of Si, Mn, and sol.Al were<br>
86 MPa, 33 MPa, and 32.5 MPa, respectively, the amounts of<br>
Si, Mn, and Al were controlled so as to obtain a constant TS<br>
of approximately 440 MPa.  That is,<br>
([Si]+[Mn]/2.6+[sol.Al]/2,6) was controlled to 1.25 %.  Here,<br>
[M] represents the amount of element M (mass%) .<br>
YS, r value, and n value are also examined in a<br>
conventional ultra low carbon cold rolled steel sheet<br>
manufactured under the same conditions as described above<br>
using a steel containing 0.0020 % of C, 0.75 % of Si, 2 % of<br>
Mn, 0.02 % Of P, 0.002 % of S, 0.003 % of N, 0.0005 % of B,<br>
0.015 % of Nb, and 0.03 % of Ti.<br>
The cold rolled steel sheets containing 0.004 % or more<br>
of C and 0.03 % or more of Nb have lower YS, higher n value,<br>
and higher r values than the conventional ultra low carbon<br>
cold rolled steel sheet.  In particular, when the amount of<br>
sol.Al is 0.1 to 1.5 %, YS becomes 270 MPa or less and n1-10<br>
becomes 0.20 or more.  In addition, when the amount of<br>
sol.Al is 0.2 to 0.6 %, the YS is further decreased to 260<br>
MPa or less in both cases of heating temperatures of 1250<br>
and 1150 0C.  The ferrite grains were sufficiently fine as<br>
- 13  -<br><br>
is the case in which the amount of sol.Al is 0.1 % or less.<br>
When the amount of sol.Al is less than 0.1 %, a large<br>
number of Nb(C, N) precipitates having a diameter of 50 nm<br>
or more, which inhibit the formation of PFZ, are observed.<br>
On the other hand, when the amount of sol.Al is 0.1 to 1.5 %,<br>
the coarse Nb(C, N) precipitates are remarkably decreased to<br>
an average area density of 0 to 7.0X10 /ï­m , and the PFZ<br>
is remarkably formed.<br>
The reason why the r value is remarkably increased when<br>
the amount of sol.Al is controlled to 0.1 % or more is not<br>
clear.  It is, however, inferred that Al has influences on<br>
the formation of deformation band at cold rolling or on the<br>
amount of solute C.<br>
Si: Si is an element for the solid solution<br>
strengthening, which may be added when it is necessary.<br>
However, the amount of Si which exceeds 1.5 % deteriorates<br>
the ductility and the anti-secondary work embrittlement, and<br>
increases the YS.  The amount of Si is set to 1.5 % or less.<br>
In addition, since the addition of Si deteriorates the<br>
conversion treatment properties of a cold rolled steel sheet<br>
and appearance of a hot dip galvanized steel sheet, the<br>
amount of Si is preferably set to 0.5 % or less.  In order<br>
to strengthen the steel sheet, the amount of Si is<br>
preferably set to 0,003 % or more.<br>
Mn: Since Mn is also an element for the solid solution<br>
- 14 -<br><br>
strengthening and an element for preventing the red<br>
shortness, Mn may be added when it is necessary.  However,<br>
when the amount of Mn exceeds 3 %, the decrease in ductility<br>
and the increase in YS occur.  The amount of Mn is set to<br>
3 % or less.  In order to obtain the superior appearance of<br>
the galvanized steel sheet, the amount of Mn is preferably<br>
set to 2 % or less.  The amount of Mn is preferably set to<br>
0.1 % or more for the solid solution strengthening.<br>
P: P is an effective element for strengthening the<br>
steel.  However, the excessive addition of P deteriorates<br>
the anti-secondary work embrittlement and the ductility, and<br>
causes the increase in YS.  Therefore, the amount of P is<br>
set to 0.15 % or less.  In order to prevent the<br>
deterioration of alloying treatment properties and adhesion<br>
failure of coating of the galvanized steel sheet, the amount<br>
of P is preferably set to 0.1 % or less.  The amount of P is<br>
preferably set to 0.01 % or more to increase the strength of<br>
the steel sheet.<br>
S: S exists as a sulfide in the steel sheet.  Since the<br>
excessive amount of S decreases the ductility, the amount of<br>
S is set to 0.02 % or less.  0.004 % or more of S is<br>
desirable for the descaling preferably set to, and 0.01 % or<br>
less of S is favorable for the ductility.<br>
N: Since N is necessary to precipitate as A1N with the<br>
addition of 0.1 to 1.5 % of sol.Al, the amount of N is set<br>
- 15 -<br><br>
to 0.007 % or less.  The amount of N is preferably decreased<br>
as small as possible.  However, since the amount of N can<br>
not be decreased to less than 0.001 % by the steel smelting<br>
process, the amount of N is set to 0.001 % or more.<br>
The balance is Fe and inevitable impurities.<br>
In addition to the elements described above, at least<br>
one element selected from the group consisting of 0.0001 to<br>
0.003 % of B, 0.5 % or less of Cu, 0.5 % or less of Ni,<br>
0.3 % or less of Mo, 0.5 % or less of Cr, 0.04 % or less of<br>
Ti, 0.2 % or less of Sb, and 0.2 % or less of Sn is<br>
preferably added for the following reasons.<br>
B: The amount of B is set to 0.0001 % or more in order<br>
to improve the anti-secondary embrittlement.  When the<br>
amount of B exceeds 0.003 %, the effect saturates, and the<br>
rolling load at hot rolling is increased.  Therefore, the<br>
amount of B is set to 0.0001 to 0.003 %.<br>
Cu, Ni, Mo, and Cr: In order to increase the TS, the<br>
anti-secondary work erabrittlement, and the r value, 0.5 % or<br>
less of Cu, 0.5 % or less of Ni, 0.3 % or less of Mo, and<br>
0.5 % or less of Cr may be added.  Cu, Cr, and Ni are the<br>
expensive elements, and when the amount of each element<br>
exceeds 0.5 %, the surface appearance deteriorates.<br>
Although Mo increases the TS without decreasing the anti-<br>
secondary work embrittlement, the amount of Mo exceeding<br>
0.3 % increases the YS.  When Cu, Cr, and Ni are added, the<br>
- 16 -<br><br>
amount of each element is preferably set to 0.03 % or more.<br>
When Mo is added, the amount of Mo is desirably set to<br>
0.05 % or more.  When Cu is added, Ni is preferably added<br>
with the same amount as Cu.<br>
Ti: In order to improve the r value, 0.04 % or less of<br>
Ti may be added.  The amount of Ti exceeding 0.04 %<br>
increases the coarse precipitates containing Ti, which lead<br>
to the decrease in the TS and the prevention of the decrease<br>
in the YS by the suppression of A1N precipitation.  When Ti<br>
is added, the amount of Ti is preferably set to 0.005 % or<br>
more.<br>
Sb and Sn: In order to improve the surface appearance,<br>
the coating adhesion, the fatigue resistance, and the<br>
toughness of the galvanized steel sheet, 0.2 % or less of Sb<br>
and 0.2 % or less of Sri are effectively added so that 0.002<br>
[Sb]+1/2X [Sn]^0.2 is satisfied.  Here, [Sb] and [Sn]<br>
represent the amounts'1 of Sb and Sn (mass%) , respectively.<br>
Since the addition of Sb and Sn prevents the surface<br>
nitridation or oxidation at slab heating, at coiling after<br>
hot rolling, at annealing in a CAL or a CGL, or at<br>
additional intermediate annealing, the coating adhesion is<br>
improved in addition to the suppression of the irregular<br>
coating.  Furthermore, since the adhesion of zinc oxides to<br>
the steel sheet in a coating bath can be prevented, the<br>
surface appearance of the galvanized steel sheet is also<br>
- 17  -<br><br>
improved.  When the amounts of Sb and Sn exceed 0.2 %, they<br>
deteriorate the coating adhesion and the toughness of the<br>
galvanized steel sheet.<br>
3. Manufacturing Method<br>
The high strength cold rolled steel sheet can be<br>
manufactured by a manufacturing method comprising the steps<br>
of: hot rolling a steel slab having a chemical composition<br>
within the range of the present invention into a hot rolled<br>
steel sheet after heating the steel slab at a heating<br>
temperature SRT which satisfies the following equations (3)<br>
and (4); and pickling and cold rolling the hot rolled steel<br>
sheet, followed by annealing within a temperature range of a<br>
ferrite phase above the recrystallization temperature.<br>
SRT
1050 0C^SRTS{770+([sol.Al]-0.0B5)Â°*24X820} 0C -(4),<br>
where [sol.Al] represents the amount of sol. Al (mass%).<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, when the amount of sol.Al is 0.1 to<br>
0.6 %, the lower YS can be obtained at the heating<br>
temperature SRT of 1150 0C as compared with that of 1250 0C.<br>
The relation between the amount of sol.Al and SRT and<br>
YS was investigated by using the cold rolled steel sheets<br>
shown in Fig. 1.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, when the amount of sol.Al is 0.1 to<br>
0.6 %, and SRT {770+([sol.Al]-0. 085) Â°'24X820} 0C is<br>
satisfied, the low YS such as 260 MPa or less can be<br>
- 18 -<br><br>
obtained.  It is believed to be caused by the suppression of<br>
Nb(C, N) precipitation at hot rolling, accompanied by the<br>
suppression of A1N dissolution at heating by controlling the<br>
SRT.  Fine ferrite grains having a grain diameter of 10 ï­ m<br>
or less were obtained.<br>
When the SRT is less than 1050 0C, the hot rolling load<br>
is increased, so that the productivity is decreased, and<br>
when the SRT is more than 1350 0C, the surface oxidation<br>
apparently occurs, so that the surface quality deteriorates.<br>
Therefore, SRT1350 0C, and 1050 t:SRT {770+ ([sol.Al] -<br>
0.085)Â°"24X820} 0C must be satisfied.<br>
In order to obtain the superior surface quality, the<br>
scales formed at slab heating and at hot rolling should be<br>
preferably sufficiently removed.  The heating by the use of<br>
a bar heater at hot rolling may also be performed.<br>
The coiling temperature after hot rolling has<br>
influences on the formation of PFZ and the r value.  In<br>
order to effectively form the PFZ, fine NbC must be<br>
precipitated, and in order to obtain a high r value, the<br>
amount of solute C must be sufficiently decreased.  In view<br>
of the effective formation of PFZ and the high r value, the<br>
coiling temperature is preferably set to 480 to 700 0C, more<br>
preferably 500 to 600 0C.<br>
The high cold rolling reduction is desirable.  However,<br>
the cold rolling reduction which exceeds 85 % increases the<br>
- 19 -<br><br>
rolling load, so that the productivity decreases.  Therefore,<br>
the cold rolling reduction is preferably 85 % or less.<br>
The high annealing temperature promotes the<br>
precipitation of coarser NbC existing in the vicinity of<br>
grain boundary, which causes the low YS and the high n value.<br>
Therefore, the annealing temperature is preferably set* to<br>
820 Â°C or more.  When the annealing temperature is lower<br>
than the recrystallization temperature, the sufficiently low<br>
YS and the high n value can not be obtained.  Therefore, the<br>
annealing temperature must be at least not less than the<br>
recrystallization temperature.  However, when the annealing<br>
temperature exceeds the Ac1 transformation temperature,<br>
ferrite grains become very fine by the ferrite<br>
transformation from the austenite, which leads to increase<br>
the YR.  Therefore, the annealing temperature must be the<br>
temperature of the AC1 transformation temperature or less.<br>
When the annealing time is increased, grain boundary<br>
migration occurs more significantly to promote the formation<br>
of PFZ.  Therefore, the soaking time is preferably set to 4 0<br>
seconds or more.<br>
A cold rolled steel sheet after annealing may be<br>
galvanized by electrogalvanizing or hot dip galvanizing.<br>
The excellent press formability can also be obtained in the<br>
galvanized steel sheet where pure zinc coating, alloy zinc<br>
coating, and zinc-nickel alloy coating may be applied.  Even<br>
- 20 -<br><br>
when the organic film is deposited after the coating, the<br>
superior press can also be obtained.<br>
Example 1<br>
Several types of steel A to V having the chemical<br>
compositions listed in Table 1 were smelt and continuously<br>
cast into the slabs having a thickness of 230 mm.  These<br>
slabs were heated to 1090 to 1325 Â°C and hot rolled to 3.2<br>
mm thick under the hot rolling conditions listed in Table 2.<br>
These hot rolled steel sheets were cold rolled to 0.8 mm<br>
thick, followed by annealing in a continuous annealing line<br>
(CAL), a hot dip galvanizing line (CGL), or a box annealing<br>
furnace (BAF) under the annealing conditions shown in Table<br>
2, and subsequently, temper rolling with the elongation of<br>
0.5 %.<br>
The hot dip zinc coating was performed at 4 60 Â°C in the<br>
CGL, followed by the alloying treatment of the coated layer<br>
at 500 Â°C in an in-line alloying furnace.  The amount of the<br>
coating per one surface was 45 g/m2 .<br>
The tensile tests were performed using JIS No. 5 test<br>
pieces cut from the direction of 0Â° , the direction of 45Â° ,<br>
and the direction of 90Â°  to the rolling direction,<br>
respectively.  The averages of YS, n10, r value, and TS<br>
were obtained by the following equation, respectively.<br>
The average V=([V0]+2[V45]+[V90])/4,<br>
- 21 -<br><br>
where [V0], [V45] and [V90] show the value of the properties<br>
obtained in the direction of 0Â° , 45Â°  and 90Â°  to the<br>
rolling direction, respectively.<br>
The ferrite grain diameter was measured by the point-<br>
counting method in the rolling direction, the thickness<br>
direction, and the direction of 45Â°  to the rolling<br>
direction at the cross section parallel to the rolling<br>
direction, and the average of the ferrite grain sizes was<br>
obtained.  The sizes of NbC and Nb(C, N) and the average<br>
area density thereof were obtained by the method previously<br>
mentioned.<br>
The results are shown in Table 2.<br>
Samples Nos. 1 to 19 of the present invention have the<br>
YS of 27 0 MPa or less, the n1-10 of 0.20 or more, and the<br>
high r value of 1.8 or more.  In particular, the samples Nos.<br>
2 to 6, 9 to 11, 15 to 17, and 19 have the YS of 260 MPa.or<br>
less because the amounts of sol.Al are 0.1 to 0.6 % and the<br>
temperature are within the present invention.  In case of<br>
samples of the present invention, the average area density<br>
of coarse Nb(C, N) precipitates having a diameter of 50 nm<br>
or more, which prevents the formation of PFZ, is 7.0X10 /ï­<br>
m2 or less, and the PFZ having a width of 0.2 to 2.4 ï­ m<br>
was formed in the vicinity of the ferrite grain boundary.<br>
On the other hand, samples Nos. 20 to 27 of the<br>
comparative examples have the high YS and the low n value<br>
- 22 -<br><br>
because the average area density of coarse Nb{C, N)<br>
precipitates having a diameter of 50 run or more or the width<br>
of the PFZ is out of the invention.  Sample No. 20 in which<br>
the amount of sol.Al is small has the YS of more than 27 0<br>
MPa, the n value of less than 0.20, ant the r value of less<br>
than 1.8.  Sample No. 21 in which the amount of sol.Al is<br>
excessive has the YS of more than 270 MPa and the n value of<br>
less than 0.20.  Samples Nos. 23, 24, 25, and 26 in which C,<br>
Si, Mn, and P are out of the range of the present invention<br>
have the YS of excessively larger than 270 MPa.  Sample No.<br>
27 in which the amount of Nb is small has the n value of<br>
less than 0.20 and the excessively low r value.<br>
Sample No. 22 as the conventional ultra low carbon high<br>
strength cold rolled steel sheet has the YS of much larger<br>
than 270 MPa, and the n value of less than 0.20.<br>
In each of samples Nos. 1 to 19 of the present<br>
invention, the ferrite grains are fine having a diameter of<br>
less than 10 ï­ m as compared with that of sample No. 22 of<br>
the conventional example, 11.4 ï­m.  Therefore, each of<br>
samples Nos. 1 to 19 of the present invention has the<br>
superior resistance to the occurrence of the orange peel and<br>
the anti-secondary work embrittlement.<br>
