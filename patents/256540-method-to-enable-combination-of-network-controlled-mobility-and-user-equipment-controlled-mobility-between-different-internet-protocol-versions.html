				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention, in general, relates to the field of mobile communication technologies. This invention also relates to the field of providing access to IPv6 and IPv4 nodes, even when the UE is connected to the network providing access to only one of the IP versions. The invention relates to the field where the session continuity needs to be maintained even after change in the Point of attachment. More specifically this relates to the field where the UE is connected to the network which supports only one of the IP versions and supports network mobility for the supported IP version. This relates to the field where the UE needs to continue the sessions during IP mobility across the IP versions. More particularly, the present invention relates to a system and method to enable combination of network controlled mobility and UE controlled mobility between different IP versions.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
When a dual stack UE moves into a network which supports only a single IP version, it is necessary to support that the UE can still continue the sessions which were started in either of the IP versions. DSMIPv6 provides the mechanism for the use of IPv6 IP address when the UE is connected via IPv4 (in addition to IPv4 nodes) and to use IPv4 addresses in addition to IPv6 when the UE is connected to the network supporting IPv6 only (later on refeered to as IPv6 only network).<br>
Similarly it is required by the network to be able to control the mobility between different points of attachments. One possible benefit is that UE need not be aware of the mobility. Also this increases the location privacy. This also reduces the header overhead and signaling overhead over the air.<br>
Dual Stack extension to MIP<br>
In this section we describe a mechanism which can be used for registration of the Home Address (HoA) of one IP version while sending the Binding to the Home Agent (HA) for the other. For ease of explanation we explain this in terms of registration of IPv4 address using the MIPv6 Binding Update. However similar mechanism can be used for registration of IPv6 address using MIPv4 Registration Message. We consider different scenarios and explain the working.<br>
When the UE is connected to IPv6 network, the UE configures the IPv6 address in the network where it has been connected. This address is the care of address (CoA) for MIPv6 binding. The UE also configures the IPv6 HoA using the MIPv6 mechanisms. UE now forms the MIPv6 binding update with the related extensions for registering the IPv4 HoA. We assume that the UE is not configured with the IPv4 home Address.<br>
The Binding update contains the IPv6 HoA. The BU also contains the IPv4 extensions which contains the IPv4 HoA. Since in this example the IPv4 HoA is not statically allocated, and UE doesnot know its HoA, So the UE includes 0.0.0.0 in the HoA field.<br>
When the HA receives the BU with IPv4 extensions, the HA allocates an IPv4 HoA for the UE. It adds two binding entries for the IPv6 CoA, one for IPv6 HoA and another for IPv4 HoA. Thus any packet with destination address as IPv6 HoA or IPv4 HoA will be tunneled to the IPv6 CoA.<br>
When the UE is connected to IPv4 network, similar procedure as described above is followed. However the UE registers the IPv4 CoA in the BU. Also the BU is tunneled to the HA via IPv4 tunnel to the IPv4 address of the HA.<br>
Thus the UE is able to access both IPv4 as well as IPv6 applications and Nodes when connected to either IPv4 or IPv6 network.<br>
Network based Mobility Mechanisms<br>
The network based mobility mechanism hides the change in the point of attachment from the UE. In the following section we explain one possible mechanism for hiding the change in the point of connectivity from the UE.<br>
When the UE powers on in the network supporting network based mobility mechanism, the router detects the L2 attach of the UE. The Router registers the UE with the Home Agent. The Home Agent registers the UE ID and informs the Router the prefix to be advertised. The UE can now configure an IP address based on this prefix by stateless or stateful address configuration. Then the R1 informs the HA about the IP address configured by the UE. Whenever a packet arrives at the HA for the UE IP address, the packet is tunneled to the R1. R1 then transfers the packet over the L2 interface. Similarly, all the packets in the uplink direction are tunneled back to the HA.<br>
When the UE moves from one Router to another within the same domain, the R2 authorizes the UE attach with the HA. The HA can inform the R2 of the prefix to be advertised which is same as the previous prefix. Since for the UE the prefix has not changed, it will assume that it is still connected to the same point of attachment. Hence the IP Address is not reconfigured. However the R2 is registers in the HA for the given IP address. Hence onwards any IP packet arriving at HA for the UE will be tunneled to R2 instead of R1.<br>
As shown in the Figure 1, the sequence for Power-on Procedure when the UE attaches to the NETLMM domain. Here the Mobility Access Gateway (MAG) is a router with some additional facilities. LMA is the local mobility agent and is like a Home Agent which registers the binding between the UE IP address and the MAG IP address for the tunneling. LMA is also in the user plane path which tunnels the UE packet to the MAG.<br>
The steps are as explained below:<br>
1. The UE attaches to the MAG at the L2 layer. MAG obtains the UE ID during this attach procedure.<br>
2.	MAG sends Location Registration Request to the LMA with the UE ID.<br>
3.	The LMA decides on whether the UE shall be allowed to access' the domain and if allowed sends the prefix to be advertised for the UE.<br>
4.	The LMA sends the router advertisement for the prefix as given by LMA.<br>
5.	The UE configures IP address based on the prefix. This can be either stateless or stateful address auto-configuration.<br>
6.	The UE sends IPv6 Neighbor solicitation as part of the Duplicate address detection.<br>
7.	The LMA now knows the address used by the UE. The LMA sends the UE-ID, IP address to the LMA in MN Address setup message.<br>
8.	The LMA checks whether this address has been bound to any other UE. If not, it configures the tunnel between LMA and MAG for the UE.<br>
9.	Now the tunnel is setup between the LMA and MAG for the given UE IP address. Any packet which arrives at the LMA for the given UE IP address will be tunneled to the MAG. The MAG detunnels the packet and tunnels it over L2 to the UE.<br>
As shown in Figure 2 the flow for network mobility when UE moves from one router to another within the same domain. The flow is as explained below:<br>
1.	The UE attaches to the MAG at the L2 layer. MAG obtains the UE ID during this attach procedure.<br>
2.	MAG sends the location registration message to the LMA.<br>
3.	LMA recognizes that the UE has been attached through a different router, tt sends route update message to the MAG.<br>
4.	LMA configures the tunnel for the UE IP Address and responds back with acknowledgement.<br>
5.	Now the LMA sends Location Reg. Acknowledgement with prefix to be advertised. Since UE receives the same prefix as previously stored, hence IP address does not change.<br>
LIMITATION<br>
Currently there is no mechanism to support the combined network based and UE based mobility mechanisms. If the UE needs to support the dual stack mobility with the network supporting only one of the IP versions, there is no current mechanism to reduce the header overhead.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention in general relates to the field of network mobility. More specifically, the invention relates to the field of providing session continuity when a User Equipment (UE) moves from one network to another network. The invention describes a method for providing access to nodes supporting both IPv4 and IPv6 on a network supporting only one of the IP versions. According to the method, both network based mobility and UE based mobility mechanisms are supported.<br>
This will allow a UE supporting dual stack mobility to access a network supporting only one of IPv4 or IPv6. The method results in reduction of header overhead and signaling overhead.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>

When the UE changes the point of attachment, the new AR registers the new location of the UE. The AR also advertises the same prefix as the UE's IP address. Hence UE does not reconfigure the IP address.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
The present invention provides a system and method of providing Dual Stack mobility when network controlled mobility mechanism is used.<br>
As depicted in Figure 3, the topology of the operation. UE and HA are dual stack. However the network, consisting of the routers R1 through R4 is single stack routers. The routers R1 and R2 are IPv6 only capable, while the routers R3 and R4 are IPv4 only capable.<br>
The invention is operated as detailed below:<br>
Combined Network Based and UE Based mobility across IP versions-<br>
1.	When the UE powers on in an IPv6 network, the UE attaches with the router R1 in L2 dependent manner. The router now advertises the network prefix which is assigned by the HA. This can be obtained by the router when the UE connects to the network (L2 Attach).<br>
2.	Based on the prefix received the UE forms an IPv6 IP address. This IP address is then registered at the HA along with the Router IP Address. This registration is done by the router. Now any packet for the UE is tunneled directly to the router.<br>
3.	The UE also has the IPv4 Home Address which can be assigned statically or dynamically. The UE sends the MIPv6 BU with the IPv4 HoA in the IPv4 extensions. The IPv6 HoA option is empty as the UE receives the same prefix as its home prefix.<br>
4.	When the UE moves from one router to another, the network manages the mobility for IPv6. Upon detection of L2 attach of the UE, R2 contacts the HA which informs the R2 the prefix which needs to be advertised. Also, HA switches the tunnel from R1 to R2. Also since the IPv4 HoA is bound to the IPv6 address, the MIPv6 BU is also not sent.<br>
5.	In HA, the IPv6 address is bound to IP address of the Router. Also, the IPv4 HoA is bound to the IPv6 IP Address of the UE. Hence whenever an IPv6 packet reaches the HA, it tunnels the packet to the router without any HA. When an IPv4 packet reaches the HA, the IPv4 packet is tunneled to IPv6 Address of the UE. However since the IPv6 address itself is tunneled to the Router, the Tunneled packet is again tunneled to the router.<br>
Hence, for IPv6 packet, the header over head is significantly less compared to the Dual Stack Mobility mechanism. In the case of IPv4, the overhead is same as in Dual Stack Mobility mechanism. Also network is in control of the mobility for the IPv6.<br>
Illustrative example of Power-On in IPv6 network-<br>
As shown in Figure 3, the topology of the network, it consists of an HA, which is connected to the routers. The routers R1 and R2 support only IPv6 network. The routers R1 and R2 also support the network supported mobility mechanism with the HA. HA supports MIPv6 registration with Dual Stack extensions. The procedure is as described (as depicted in Figure 4):<br>
1.	The UE attaches to the AR at the L2 layer. AR obtains the UE ID during this attach procedure.<br>
2.	AR sends Location Registration Request to the HA with the UE ID.<br>
3.	The HA decides on whether the UE shall be allowed to access the domain and if allowed sends the prefix to be advertised for the UE.<br>
4.	The AR sends the router advertisement for the prefix as given by HA.<br>
5.	The UE configures IP address based on the prefix. This can be either stateless or stateful address auto-configuration. Let the IP address be designated at IPv6<br>
6.	The UE sends IPv6 Neighbor solicitation as part of the Duplicate address detection.<br>
7.	The AR now knows the address used by the UE. The AR sends the UE-ID, IP address to the HA in MN Address setup message. Now HA has binding for the IPv6 and the AR IP address.<br>
8.	The HA checks whether this address has been bound to any other UE. If not, it configures the tunnel between HA and AR for the UE.<br>
9.	UE generates a MIPv6 BU with HoA as IPv4 address, and CoA as IPv6.<br>
10.	The HA forms a binding entry between IPv4 and IPv6. Hence now any packet for IPv4 will be tunneled to IPv6<br>
11.	HA responds back with the Binding response to UE. Now the User Plane setup is completed.<br>
Figure 6 depicts the decision flow for UE attaching to IPv6 only network. Data Transmission-<br>
1. When an IPv6 packet arrives at the HA for the UE IPv6 IP address, the packet is tunneled to R1. The R1 detunnels the packet and sends the IPv6 packet over the air. Hence there is no over the air header overhead.<br>
2. When an IPv4 packet arrives at the HA for the UE IPv4 IP address, the packet triggers IPv6 tunneling protocol. Thus the IPv4 packet is tunneled to IPv6 IP address. Now the IPv6 packet is tunneled to the AR1.A R1 detunnels the IPv6 packet and L2 tunnel to the UE. The UE detunnels the IPv6 packet and delivers the IPv4 packet.<br>
Illustrative Example of mobility from IPv6 only network to IPv4 only network- As shown in Figure 3, the topology of the scenario. The HA and UE are dual stacked and support both IPv6 and IPv4 networks. The Routers are connected to the HA (possibly through intermediate routers) and support either only IPv6 or only IPv4. In the figure the routers R1 and R2 support only IPv6 while routers R3 and R4 support only IPv4.<br>
Consider the UE is in R2 and is connected through IPv6 network. IPv4 address is registered with the HA. When the UE connects to Router R3, the network supports only IPv4. The procedure is as given below (as shown in Figure 5):<br>
1.	The UE is connected through oAR. OAR is an IPv6 node. Hence the HA keeps the binding between IPv6 and oAR IP address for tunneling of the packets. The IPv4 is bound with IPv6.<br>
2.	The UE attaches to the nAR at the L2 layer. nAR obtains the UE ID during this attach procedure.<br>
3.	nAR sends the location registration message to the HA.<br>
4.	HA recognizes that the UE has been attached through a different router. It sends route update message to the nAR. Since the nAR is IPv4 capable, the route update is for the IPv4 address only.<br>
5.	nAR configures the tunnel for the UE IP Address (IPv4 in this case) and responds back with acknowledgement.<br>
6.	Now HA keeps the binding between the IPv4 and nAR IP address.<br>
7.	Now the HA sends Location Reg. Acknowledgement with prefix to be advertised. Since the prefix is same as the IPv4 HoA, UE realizes that it has arrived in IPv4 home and needs to send deregistration message. However since the UE is IPv4 only network, it needs to send registration for the IPv6 address. 8-9. UE deregisters the IPv4 from the HA. Alternatively HA can do it when the nAR registers the UE in its domain.<br>
10.	UE also sends MIPv6 BU to register IPv6 with CoA as IPv4.<br>
11.	HA keeps the binding between the IPv6 and Ipv4. 12 The BU response will complete the protocol.<br>
Now all the data will be tunneled to the IPv4 address of the Router and over L2 to<br>
theUE.<br>
Figure 7 depicts the decision flow for UE attaching to IPv6 only network.<br>
According to the innovation, the UE should be able to send the DSMlPv6 BU even though it is attached to the home network for the other IP version. The UE also should be able to send multiple BU, one for deregistering the IP version supported by the network for Network based mobility and another for registering the IP<br>
address (HoA) of the unsupported IP version. ADVANTAGES<br>
1.	Enables Dual Stack mobility when the network supports network based mobility for one of the IP versions.<br>
2.	Enables network to be in control of mobility for atleast one IP version.<br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a microchip, microprocessor, handheld communication device, computer, rendering device or a multi function device.<br>

Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart there from. <br>
