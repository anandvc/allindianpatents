TRANSFER MECHANISM FOR A CONVEYER SYSTEM<br>
        LELE PRADEEP PURUSHOTTAM<br>
       an Indian National<br>
      of 7, Mahadev Darshan, Opp. Jeevan Vikas Kendra, Koldongri,<br>
Andheri (E), Mumbai 400 069, Maharashtra, India<br>
    THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE   INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br>
This invention relates to a transfer mechanism for a conveyer system.<br>
In particular, this invention relates to a transfer mechanism for conveyor system/machines specifically for conveying farm produce or the like articles.<br>
In conveying machines, articles are transferred along a conveyor from one station to another. Some stations may be stationary while other stations are movable; For instance, articles such as farm produce are conveyed from a storage site to a packaging site. On line there may be a weighing or a grading station where the food produce may have to be led from up stream conveyors for weighing and after weighing or grading the farm produce is then sent on to downstream conveyors for packaging. Generally in the prior art the conveyors are designed in such a manner that individual farm produce such as apples or melons and the like are dropped on to the weighing or grading station which is either a stationary station or a moving station and after weighing or grading the produce is then placed on the conveyor.<br>
Alternatively, the operation is a manual operation where physically the farm produce article is lifted off the conveyor and placed on the weighing or grading station by hand and thereafter the farm produce article is lifted off the station and placed back on a selected conveyor for packing.<br>
In the process of dropping or placing of the farm produce article, particularly delicate produce it often happens that the produce gets damaged, bruised or tarnished. This is counter productive to the whole process.<br>
An object of this invention is to provide a transfer mechanism by which farm produce or the like delicate article can be lifted off one conveyor, placed on a<br>
2<br><br>
station either moving or stationary and then lifted off the station and placed on the same or different conveyor, smoothly without any damage.<br>
Accordingly this invention provides a transfer mechanism for a conveyor system for smooth transferring of an article, without any damage from a conveyor to a station, such as weighing station or grading station or vice versa, comprising of a lifting device and a complementary section matching with the construction of the lifting device, the said lifting device consisting of a plurality of finger elements connected at one end to a connector bracket, the said finger elements being placed side by side in spaced apart manner and the said bracket being provided with a bore for mounting the said lifting device on a moving arm, the said complementary section consisting of a plurality of receiving elements interconnected to a transverse bar and placed side by side forming an array for receiving and holding the article in a stable fashion.<br>
Typically, each of the said finger element is contoured to form a trough shaped receiving formation by means of bent members of the finger element.<br>
Typically, the said finger elements are adjustably connected to the connector bracket such that the space between the two finger elements can be reduced or increased as per requirement.<br>
Typically, the said lifting device is mounted/connected to a variety of moving arms for conveying, lifting, reciprocating or otherwise moving in a combination thereof, in order to intermesh with the receiving elements of the complementary section.<br>
Typically, the said finger elements are spaced apart from each other, very similar to or resembling to the stretched fingers of a human hand.<br>
3<br><br>
Typically, the said transverse bar, interconnecting the receiving elements of the complementary section is connected or co-operates with other devices such as a weighing machine/station/digital weighting scale or a conveyor or the like.<br>
Typically, the said finger elements and the said receiving elements are made of metal, plastic, wood, ceramic or composite materials or combination thereof.<br>
Typically, the said finger elements and receiving elements are coated with hear, wear and tear resistant materials like Teflon.<br>
Typically, sensors are provided to elicit responses in between the finger elements of the lifting device and the receiving elements of the complementary section.<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings which are merely illustrative of one embodiment of the invention and are in no way limiting the scope of the invention and wherein<br>
Figure 1 illustrates in perspective view, a lifting device of the transfer mechanism which can lift an article off a conveyor and place the article on a station which is also modified to be complementary to the lifting device; Figure 2 shows the typical complementary construction of a station or conveyor modified and forming a part of transfer mechanism to suit the requirements of this invention;<br>
Figures 3 to 5 and 6 to 8 illustrate the working of the transfer mechanism in accordance with this invention.<br>
4<br><br>
Referring to Figures 1 to 8, the transfer mechanism for a conveyor system according to an embodiment of this invention comprises a lifting device (10) consisting of a plurality of finger elements (12) placed side by side in spaced apart manner and connected at one end to a connector bracket (14). Each of the finger element (12) is contoured to form a trough shaped receiving formation by means of bent members (16 and 18). The finger elements (12) are adjustably connected to the connector bracket (14) so that the space between the two finger elements can be adjusted that is either reduced or increased as per requirement. The connector bracket (14) is provided with a bore/hole or passage (15) through which the lifting device (10) can be mounted on a moving arm (not shown) provided at the junction where the article is required to be transferred from conveyor to a station, such as weighing station or grading station or vice versa. The finger elements (12) are spaced apart from each other very similar or resembling to a stretched finger of a human hand. The conveyor or the station, as the case may be is provided with a complementary section (20) matching with the construction of the lifting device (10). The complementary section (20) consists of a plurality of spaced apart receiving elements (22) for receiving an article (30) from the lifting device (10). The receiving elements (22) when placed side by side, as shown in Figure 2, form an array which can receive and hold the article 30 in a stable fashion as seen in the figures. The receiving elements 22 are all inter connected to a transverse bar 24 which in turn can be connected or cooperates with other devices such as a digital weighing scale or a conveyor or the like.<br>
As seen in the figures 3 to 5 and 6 to 8, the spacing apart of the receiving elements 22 and the finger elements 12 allows the two to intermesh. In the process of this intermeshing configuration articles 30 can be transferred from the lifting device to the complementary section 20 and vice versa.<br>
5<br><br>
The fingers (12) and the elements (22) may be made of metal, plastic wood ceramic or combination thereof or composite materials and may be further coated with heat wear and tear resistant materials like Teflon.<br>
The lifting device (10) may be connected to a variety of arms for conveying, lifting, reciprocating or otherwise moving in combination thereof to intermesh as seen in the figures 3 to 5 and 6 to 8.<br>
While considerable emphasis has been placed herein on the structures and structural interrelationships between the component parts of the preferred embodiment, it will be appreciated that many embodiments can be made and that many changes can be made in the preferred embodiment without departing from the principals of the invention. These and other changes in the preferred embodiment as well as other embodiments of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the disclosure herein, whereby it is to be distinctly understood that the foregoing descriptive matter is to be interpreted merely as illustrative of the invention and not as a limitation. For example, sensors [not shown] can be used to elicit responses in between the finger elements of the lifting device and the complementary section receiving elements. Further it may be envisaged that the space/pitch of the fingers (12) and the receiving elements (22) may be displaceable/adjustable so that the fingers and the receiving elements can be brought closer or further apart as per requirement in order to accommodate different articles.<br>
