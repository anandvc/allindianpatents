				<td>METHOD OF TABLET ENROBING<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention is for a method of tablet enrobing.<br>
This invention concerns tablet enrobing, that is coating ingestible tablets, e.g. of a<br>
medicament, vitamin, dietary supplement etc, with suitable ingestible material so that the<br>
tablets are tamper-evident, i.e. any attempt to tamper with the tablet e.g. by adulterating<br>
the contents will result in damage to the coating that is readily visually apparent. The<br>
invention is applicable to other solid forms of medicament etc, e.g. caplets and capsules as<br>
well as tablets, but for simplicity all such forms will generally be referred to herein as<br>
tablets.<br>
Background to the Invention<br>
As a safety precaution, it is nowadays becoming increasingly desirable 01 necessary to<br>
provide tamper-evident tablets in addition to tamper-evidence packaging for tablets of<br>
medicaments etc. It is known to enrobe tablets in gelatin for this purpose by dipping<br>
tablets into gelatin solution and allowing the solution to dry to form a coating. The gelatin<br>
solution may be coloured, and it is known to produce dual colour gelatin coatings, e.g. by<br>
coating the entire tablet with, say, yellow gelatin and then, after drying, coating half of the<br>
tablet with, say, red gelatin. This produces an attractive, tamper-evident tablet. However,<br>
the process involves several steps and is time consuming, even with single coating<br>
processes, as long drying times are involved. Further, problems are associated with use of<br>
gelatin in ingestible products as gelatin is an animal-derived material, obtained from the<br>
bones and skins of animals such as cattle, and there are increasing concerns over use of<br>
such materials in ingestible products in view of fear of animal related diseases such as<br>
Bovine Spongiform Enceptialopathy (BSE).<br>
The present invention provides an alternative approach to tablet enrobing not necessarily<br>
using gelatin coatings.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
In one aspect, the invention provides a method of enrobing a tablet, comprising vacuum<br>
forming a film of material onto the surface of the tablet.<br>
In practising the method of the invention, the tablet and enrobing film material are exposed<br>
to conditions of differential pressure across the film, with a vacuum or substantially<br>
reduced pressure on the side of the film material in the vicinity of the tablet, so that the<br>
film material is caused to deform so as to conform to the external surface of the tablet<br>
under the action of the pressure differential, forming a skin-tight coating on at least part of<br>
the tablet surface, fitting snugly to the tablet surface. In this way a skin-tight, tamper-<br>
evident film wrapping of the tablet may be produced. In order fully to enclose the tablet in<br>
the film material, it may be necessary to perform two or more vacuum forming steps, with<br>
different parts of the tablet in the vicinity of the film material prior to exposure to the<br>
pressure differential. Vacuum chamber or vacuum bed apparatus, in which the tablet is<br>
located on a suitably shaped support and exposed to conditions of vacuum (or substantially<br>
reduced pressure) can be used for vacuum forming. Such apparatus may be based on<br>
commercially available vacuum chamber or vacuum bed apparatus. Vacuum forming<br>
techniques result in the coating forming a vacuum-tight pack around the tablet, with the<br>
exclusion of air between the coating and tablet, leading to potentially better keeping<br>
properties and hence longer shelf life of the enrobed tablet as compared with uncoated<br>
tablet.<br>
The film should be of material that is suitable for human consumption and that has<br>
sufficient flexibility and plasticity to be vacuum formable. Some film materials have<br>
suitable properties in their natural condition, but commonly it will be necessary to pre-treat<br>
the film material so it is vacuum formable. For example, it may be appropriate to expose<br>
the film material to a solvent therefor; for instance, certain grades of polyvinyl alcohol<br>
(PVA) will vacuum form after application of a small amount of water to the surface thereof<br>
or when exposed to conditions of high humidity. A further, generally preferred,<br>
possibility is to use a film of thermoplastic material (i.e. material capable of deforming<br>
plastically on heating) with the film being heated to be in heat-softened condition prior to<br>
being thermofonned by exposure to vacuum. Suitable thermoplastic materials include<br>
modified cellulose materials, particularly hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) and<br>
hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyethylene oxide (PEO),<br>
pectin, alginate, starches, and modified starches, and also protein films such as soya and<br>
whey protein films. The currently preferred film material is HPMC. Suitable film<br>
materials are commercially available.<br>
When using film of thermoplastic film, the film is typically heated prior to application to<br>
the tablet (and so usually prior to exposure to the differential pressure conditions), so that<br>
the film is in heat-softened deformable condition. This can be achieved by exposing the<br>
film to a source of heat, e.g. an infra red heater, infrared lamps, a heated plate, a hot air<br>
source etc.<br>
The film material may include optional colourings, e.g. in the form of food dyes such as F<br>
D and C yellow number 5, and/or optional flavourings, e.g. sweeteners, and/or optional<br>
textures etc in known manner.<br>
The film material typically includes a plasticiser to give desired properties of flexibility to<br>
the film in known manner. Materials used as plasticisers include alpha hydroxy acids such<br>
as lactic acid and salts thereof, diacetin, triacetin, propylene glycol, glycerin or mixtures<br>
thereof. A typical thermoplastic film formulation is HPMC 77% by weight, plasticiser<br>
23% by weight.<br>
The film suitably has a thickness in the range 20 to 200 microns, conveniently 50 to 100<br>
microns, e.g. about 80 microns, with appropriate film thickness depending on factors<br>
including the size and form of the tablet.<br>
The method of the invention conveniently involves forming two separate, overlapping part<br>
(generally half) coatings on the tablet of the film material. Thus the method preferably<br>
involves first coating part (generally hall) of the tablet, removing remaining film material<br>
not coated on the tablet, e.g. by cutting, then coating the remaining part (generally half) of<br>
the tablet, with overlapping portions of the two coatings sealed together to provide a sealed<br>
complete enclosure for the tablet, and again removing remaining surplus film material not<br>
coated on the tablet. It may be necessary to apply adhesive material or glue between the<br>
overlapping film coatings, e.g. to the surface of one or both of the film layers, to ensure<br>
formation of an effective seal therebetween and to make the enrobed tablet tamper-evident.<br>
The adhesive material conveniently has the same composition as the film, but with a<br>
greater proportion of plasticiser, e.g. 93% to 98% by weight plasticiser, so as to provide a<br>
less viscous material. The adhesive material may be applied, e.g. by use of a roller,<br>
spraying etc. A typical adhesive formulation, with % representing % by weight, is HPMC<br>
4%, lactic acid 77%, water 19%.<br>
The tablet conveniently includes a generally cylindrical side wall portion, with the two half<br>
coatings overlapping on this side wall. Tablets of circular symmetrical form with a<br>
circular cylindrical side wall are very common, but other forms eg generally oblong and<br>
oval, again including a cylindrical side wall, are also known.<br>
It may also be advantageous or desirable to apply adhesive material, e.g. as described<br>
above, to the surface of the tablet prior to coating to promote adhesion of the film thereto.<br>
Again this may be achieved e.g. by use of a roller, spraying etc.<br>
A plurality of tablets in an array may conveniently be coated simultaneously, using a<br>
suitably large sheet of film material.<br>
In a further aspect, the invention provides a tablet enrobed by the method of the invention.<br>
The invention will be further described by way of illustration with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Figures 1 to 9 illustrate schematically enrobing of a tablet by a method in accordance with<br>
the invention using a split vacuum chamber, with Figures 1 to 5, 7 and 8 being sectional<br>
views, Figures 6 and 9 being perspective views on an enlarged scale and Figures 6A and<br>
9A showing details of Figures 6 and 9, respectively, on a further enlarged scale.<br>
Detailed description of the drawings<br>
Figures 1 to 9 illustrate schematically a method of enrobing a tablet in accordance with the<br>
invention, using a thermoplastic film in a vacuum forming technique. In practice an array<br>
of a plurality of tablets will generally be coated simultaneously, but for simplicity only one<br>
tablet 10 is shown in these Figures.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, tablet 10, is of circular symmetrical form and includes a generally<br>
circular cylindrical side wall portion 12 and two similar part-spherical upper and lower<br>
portions 14 and 16.<br>
In Figure 1, tablet 10 is shown located on a platen or support 18 which includes a recess<br>
20 shaped to be complementary to tablet lower portion 16 (and tablet upper portion 14).<br>
The support 18 and tablet 10 are located in a split vacuum chamber 22 of generally<br>
conventional construction, as shown in Figure 2. The chamber is in the form of a sealed<br>
generally cuboid box, and comprises an upper chamber portion 24 and a lower chamber<br>
portion 26 that fit sealingly together, with a circumferential seal 28 therebetween. Upper<br>
chamber portion 24 includes a vacuum port 30, and lower chamber portion 26 includes a<br>
vacuum port 32, but the chamber is otherwise enclosed and sealed with respect to the<br>
exterior.<br>
The support 18 is located on two elongate protrusions 34, 36 extending upwardly into the<br>
chamber cavity from lower chamber portion 26. A heatable plate shown schematically at<br>
38 is located in upper chamber portion 24. A sheet 40 of hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose<br>
(HPMC) film 80 microns thick is located between the upper and lower chamber portions,<br>
trapped and secured in position between the seal 28 and chamber portions and extending<br>
outwardly therefrom. The HPMC film comprises 77% by weight HPMC, 23% by weight<br>
lactic acid plasticiser.<br>
In use of the apparatus, plate 38 is heated to a temperature in the range 150 to 200°C,<br>
typically about 180°C. A vacuum is then drawn in the upper chamber, by connecting<br>
vacuum port 30 to a vacuum pump, with vacuum port 32 being left open to the<br>
atmosphere. The resulting pressure differential has the effect of drawing film 40 into<br>
contact with the lower surface of heated plate 38, as shown in Figure 3.<br>
A vacuum is then drawn in the lower chamber, by connecting vacuum port 32 to a vacuum<br>
pump, with the vacuum in the upper chamber being maintained. When the lower chamber<br>
is fully evacuated and the film 40 is at the correct temperature for thermoforming due to<br>
the effect of heated plate 38 (generally after about 5 seconds in contact with plate 38), air<br>
is readmitted to the upper chamber by opening vacuum port 30 to atmosphere. The<br>
resulting pressure differential has the effect of drawing film 40, which is in heat-softening<br>
condition, down onto the upper and side surfaces of the tablet 10 as shown in Figure 4.<br>
The absence of air in the lower chamber allows the film to conform precisely to the<br>
contours of the tablet.<br>
When the vacuum forming is complete (generally after about 10 seconds) air is readmitted<br>
to the lower chamber and the vacuum chamber is opened.<br>
The vacuum formed web of HPMC film and tablet (retained in the web) is removed from<br>
the chamber on platen 18.<br>
The tablet is cut out from the film web using a close-fitting hollow cylindrical blade 42, as<br>
illustrated in Figure 5. This results in a half-enrobed tablet, as shown in Figures 6 and<br>
6A, with the upper portion 14 and part of the cylindrical side wall portion 12 coated with<br>
film 44 to a point slightly below the central plane of the tablet, as shown best in Figure<br>
6A.<br>
The half-enrobed tablet is put back on the platen 18 in inverted position, with the enrobed<br>
part in contact with recess 20, as shown in Figure 7.<br>
The platen 18 is returned to the vacuum chamber, with a further sheet 46 of the HPMC<br>
film located between the upper and lower chamber portions, in like manner to sheet 40 as<br>
described above. The vacuum forming process, as described above with reference to<br>
Figures 3 and 4 is repeated, and the resulting vacuum formed web of HPMC film and<br>
tablet removed from the chamber on platen 18.<br>
The tablet is cut out of the film web using a close-fitting hollow cylindrical blade 48 of<br>
slightly larger diameter than blade 42, as illustrated in Figure 8. This results in the tablet<br>
being fully enclosed and enrobed by the two layers of film 44 and 46, with a<br>
circumferential overlapped seal as shown in Figures 9 and 9k.<br>
In order to achieve an effective seal between the overlapping film layers, glue is applied to<br>
at least one of the overlapping surfaces (e.g. to the outer surface of the cylindrical portion<br>
of film 44 coating the tablet side wall portion 12) after the first vacuum forming process<br>
and before the second vacuum forming process. The glue is of the same chemical<br>
composition as the HPMC film, but with a higher proportion of plasticiser, comprising<br>
HPMC 4% by weight, lactic acid 77% by weight and water 19% by weight. The glue is<br>
conveniently applied by use of a roller or by spraying.<br>
In a modification of the above described apparatus and method, heated plate 38 is replaced<br>
by an array of infra red lamps in the upper chamber portion 24. In use of the apparatus a<br>
vacuum is drawn in both the upper and lower chamber portions 24 and 26 by connecting<br>
the vacuum ports 30 and 32 to a vacuum source. By maintaining equal pressures in both<br>
halves of the vacuum chamber the film sheet 40 is held in position whilst being heated by<br>
absorption of infra red radiation from the infra red lamps. This condition is maintained<br>
until the film is at the correct temperature for thermoforming. Air is then readmitted to<br>
the upper chamber portion 24 by opening vacuum port 30 to atmosphere. This<br>
modification is currently generally thought preferable to the heated plate version.<br>
