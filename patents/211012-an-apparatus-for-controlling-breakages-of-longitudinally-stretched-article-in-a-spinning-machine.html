				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a system for controlling breakage of a longitudinally stretched article in<br>
a spinning machine and maintaining uniform spinning tension by varying the spindle speed of the<br>
machine with respect to the end breakage levels.<br>
In order to attain optimum spinning conditions, in which higher production, labour productivity and good<br>
yarn quality are the main requirements, end break levels are to be reduced and maintained so that<br>
higher spindle speeds and other optimum conditions can be arrived at.<br>
An end breakage in spinning is an occurrence in which discontinuity in spinning process is caused due<br>
to a situation when tension placed on the yarn during spinning exceeds the yarn strength. To explain, at<br>
higher spindle speeds, the spinning tension increases and as a result of higher spinning tensions, the<br>
difference between the yarn breaking force and the tension placed one the yarn becomes much less<br>
and therefore the probability of end break increases.<br>
Tension in yarn during spinning occurs due to various conditions such as poor raw material quality, non-<br>
optimised spinning preparatory processes, machinery conditions and various setting parameters of<br>
spinning process, varying ambient conditions and poor material handling.<br>
In our co-pending application No. 1321/Cal/98 there is provided a system for providing the yarn laid-in a<br>
slack form to attain uniform test conditions for yarn in an yarn tensile testing method comprising:<br>
- means to vertically holding the yarn to be tested comprising a top clamp and a bottom clamp and<br>
suction unit loosely holding the leading end of the yarn passing therethrough said top and bottom<br>
clamps, said top clamp being fixed and the bottom clamp movable;<br>
a plunger actuating unit having means for effecting a movement of an actuating member thereof to<br>
thereby pull required yarn length from said suction unit for laying in slack form of the yarn to be tested<br>
therebetween said top and bottom clamp, said bottom clamp having means for clamping said yarn after<br>
said laying in slack form of said yarn and said plunger actuating unit further having means for retracting<br>
said actuuating member thereof to its original position after claiming of said bottom clamp to thereby<br>
provide for slack laying-in of the yarn to be tested therebetween said top and bottom clamps.<br>
Our other co-pending application No. 1322/Cal/98 is directed to a system for constantly measuring<br>
mass variation of a longitudinal material in a continuous process of its manufacture requiring liner<br>
distribution and uniformity comprising:<br>
sensor means to sense a linear mass distribution of the material at the various stages of processing<br>
at the various subsystems;<br>
means to activate the sensor means for acquisition of product status at every sub station;<br>
- means to store the standard parameters of product status at every stage of processing at respective<br>
sub status;<br>
means to analyze and compare the data sensed by said sensor with respect to said standard<br>
parameters;<br>
control unit to generate working status signal to the various subsystems based upon comparative<br>
analysis carried out by said means for analyzing and comparing;<br>
a communication control means interfacing therebetween said means for activating, storing,<br>
analyzing and comparing said sensed data and said control unit and also with the various<br>
subsystems to the control unit for effecting necessary control in processing.<br>
Primary among the various factors which influences and breakage levels is spindle speed of the running<br>
machine and it offers an advantage that this can be successfully varied to control the end breakage<br>
level unlike other factors such as raw material<br>
quality which cannot be altered at the final stages of spinning<br>
processes.<br>
When yarn tension is measured during a yarn package build up<br>
from the beginning to the end of the yarn package while spinning<br>
the yarn, a long-term change in tension between two extremes of<br>
yarn package build up can be noted. At the beginning of yarn<br>
build-up, the spinning tension will be significantly higher than<br>
the end of the build-up. This excess tension in the beginning of<br>
the build up has a negative effect on the yarn quality and on<br>
the running conditions at this phase of the build up.<br>
It is therefore essential to control the tension at the initial<br>
stage of the cop build up inorder to maintain the end breakage<br>
rates uniformly and at a lower level throughout the doff.<br>
In order to atleast reduce the disadvantage of higher spinning<br>
tension at the beginning of the cop build, a 2 stage drive<br>
system available commonly serves the purpose to some extent. Two<br>
stage drive systems use two motors, one running at slow speed<br>
and other at high speed according to the required time for which<br>
these have to operated. This system makes possible the reduction<br>
of speed (and therefore a reduction of the spinning tension to a<br>
normal level) at the beginning of the cop build and at the end.<br>
Accompanying Figure 1 shows the resulting conditions of spinning<br>
tension with such a system.<br>
It is seen from Figure 1 that the excess tension at the<br>
beginning and at the end is eliminated. As a result, the working<br>
performance in spinning is considerably improved due to a<br>
reduction in end breakage rate at these levels. The limitation<br>
as the maximum spindle speed is therefore removed and<br>
consequently the average speed could be increased from the<br>
prevailing level, thus increasing the production of the machine.<br>
A certain disadvantage, with this system, however, is the sudden<br>
surge in spinning tension at the speed change-over point which<br>
results in a change in yarn quality characteristics and spinning<br>
performance at this point. As a result, though the system is an<br>
improvement over the constant speed arrangement, it is not<br>
entirely suitable for very high production spinning.<br>
Extending the concept introduced by the two-stage spinning<br>
process, several advancements took place with the prime<br>
intention of increasing the speed over a definite number of<br>
steps so that the change over of speed is not very abrupt.<br>
One such system is the VPS (Vari Pitch Sheare) drive system. VPS<br>
drives are commonly used and mechanically controlled. In VPS<br>
drive, motor will run at constant speed only. The VPS varies the<br>
speed of ring frame in finite steps by varying the pitch<br>
diameter of the V-belt sheaves. This is automatically done<br>
during working of the ring frame by changing the sheave diameter<br>
from minimum to maximum. The problems associated with VPS is the<br>
range of speed variators limited to only a certain percentage<br>
(for eg. About 25%). Due to various moving parts, the VPS pulley<br>
needs frequent maintenance. However, these are relatively less<br>
costlier.<br>
With variators, speed adjustment is not carried out at the<br>
motor, but by means of adjustable grooved discs in the belt<br>
drive. In the variator, to get change in speed, change in<br>
diameter is effected by shifting the belt with two V-pulleys<br>
each made up by a respective pair of conically faced discs<br>
movable towards and away from each other. The adjustment is<br>
effected usually by a control device acting via pneumatic or<br>
hydraulic pistons and a lever mechanism.<br>
Another development in speed controlled drives for ring frame is<br>
inventer. These are power electronic motor controller and<br>
generally has no moving parts. These are available as part of<br>
ring frames or can be installed separately. The speed of motor<br>
is varied according to the speed setting adjustments programmed.<br>
The motor speed is controlled by controlling the supply<br>
frequency by means of a current controlled frequency converter,<br>
relays, voltage or using binary inputs. Inverters have no speed<br>
limit, but depends on the machine parameters, motors, etc.<br>
Inverters reportedly consume more power and are also relatively<br>
expensive.<br>
It is thus the basic objective of the present invention to<br>
provide an economical system for providing smooth change over of<br>
speed from the start of the doff to the end thereby maintaining<br>
uniform tension in the yarn.<br>
Another object of the present invention reside in that unlike in<br>
all the known methods described earlier, wherein the speed<br>
profile is defined by the user according to information on end<br>
breakages available with line to have a system wherein the<br>
change in speed is effected based on information obtained on<br>
line about the end breakages.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
system wherein the end breakages could be controlled to a large<br>
extent by providing means for analyzing instantaneous end break<br>
and speed data and having means for adjusting spindle speed<br>
accordingly based upon said end breakage data.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to provide an<br>
improved method for controlling breakages of the stretched<br>
article utilizing the system of the invention.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
closed loop control system to monitor and control the end breaks<br>
effectively.<br>
Thus according to the present invention there is provided a<br>
system for controlling breakage of longitudinally stretched<br>
articles in spinning machines comprising :<br>
at least one sensor means for sensing process condition/article<br>
condition provided at each spinning machine ;<br>
each said spinning machine operatively connected to a<br>
microprocessor based machine station for acquisition of process<br>
condition/article condition data from said sensors ;<br>
said machine station operatively connected to a electronic<br>
control unit provided to control the spinning machine speed<br>
based upon article condition/process condition sensed.<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the present invention the<br>
system for controlling breakage of longitudinally stretched<br>
articles in variator driven spinning machines comprise<br>
said process condition/article condition comprising information<br>
on end breaks of the stretched article and the spindle speed ;<br>
said micro processor based system providing to acquiring<br>
information on end breaks and the spindle speed from said<br>
sensors which is further transmitted to the said electronic<br>
control unit ;<br>
said electronic control unit having means for controlling the<br>
variator drive spinning assembly speed of the variator driven<br>
spinning machine based upon the end breakage data via a<br>
pneumatic control unit.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the present invention the<br>
system for controlling breakage of longitudinally stretched<br>
articles in an inverter driven spinning machine comprise<br>
said processing condition/article condition comprising<br>
information on end break of said stretched article and spindle<br>
speed ;<br>
said microprocessor based system adapted to acquire information<br>
on end breaks and spindle speed from said sensors which is<br>
further transmitted on to said electronic control unit ;<br>
said electronic control unit having means for controlling the<br>
speed of the inverter driven spinning machine based upon the end<br>
breakage data.<br>
According to yet further aspect the invention provides for<br>
improvement in the method of controlling end breakage of<br>
longitudinally stretched articles in a spinning machine<br>
utilizing the system disclosed above comprising<br>
acquiring end break data from the machine station ;<br>
calculating the end breakage rate (EBR) after an observation<br>
cycle ;<br>
comparing the calculated EBR with standard values ;<br>
effectuating speed up or down control as required ;<br>
effectuating necessary changes in quantum of speed increase or<br>
decrease based on the input entry and speed input from machine ;<br>
transferring of control to pneumatic control unit and finally<br>
execution of controller.<br>
The present invention thus provides for the possibility of<br>
arranging a selective and continuous speed adjustment in<br>
spinning machine for the complete build-up. In this way, optimum<br>
conditions of spindle speed can be obtained such that,<br>
throughout the buildup, a practically constant spinning tension<br>
is available. Such a trace is shown in the accompanying figure<br>
2.<br>
In the above system of the invention by way of an on-line<br>
monitoring system information is acquired from each and every<br>
spindle in a ring spinning machine by sensor means and in a<br>
controlled manner for improvement of machines productivity.<br>
In particular, each spinning machine consists of a set of<br>
sensors which are the components which collect information such<br>
as end breaks, speed, production etc. Informations from these<br>
sensors are connected to a "Machine Station". The machine<br>
station is controlled by a microprocessor which accepts data<br>
from the sensors. Each machine has a separate machine station.<br>
The machine stations are connected to a central unit (also<br>
called control unit) which has input / output devices for<br>
interaction with the user. The machine stations are periodically<br>
called up by the central unit for obtaining the information.<br>
The electronic control unit of the system is operatively linked<br>
to the machine station of the on-line monitoring system to<br>
collect information on end breaks periodically. This information<br>
is subsequently processed by the system and acted upon.<br>
The details of the invention its objects and advantages will be<br>
further apparent from the non-limiting exemplary embodiments of<br>
the system of the invention discussed hereunder with reference<br>

spinning machines.<br>

Reference is first invited to Fig. 3A which shows a speed<br>
control device for variator driven spinning machines. Variator<br>
drive assembly (13), consists of taper shieves (5) and belt (6).<br>
The top variator drive assembly is connected to a motor (1)<br>
through motor shaft (2) and bottom of variator drive assembly is<br>
connected to tin roller (4) through tin roller shaft (3) . Input<br>
to the variator drive comes from a variator cylinder (7) which<br>
is pneumatically operated by a pneumatic control unit (8). The<br>
pneumatic control unit (8) gets the required signal from<br>
Electronic control unit (9) gets information from various sensor<br>
outputs (10) (one such sensor is a sensor (12) for measuring<br>
spindle speed) and machine inputs (11) programmed by the user.<br>
Reference is now invited to Fig. 3B which shows schematically<br>
the pneumatic control unit comprising of the two single solenoid<br>
valves and flow onto valve alongwith the pneumatic circuit<br>
diagram as illustrated.<br>
Speed control is effected by movement of the piston. Air flow<br>
into the piston is controlled by solenoid valves NC 1 and NC 2<br>
as shown below :<br>
Referring to Fig. 3A spindle speed is varied by using the taper<br>
shieve pulleys (5) fixed on the tin roller shaft (3) and motor<br>
shaft (2). The ratio between the revolutions of these two shafts<br>
is governed by the position of the belt (6) running between the<br>
pulleys. By adjusting the position of the belt (6) on motor<br>
shaft pulleys (5.1), the transfer ratio can be adjusted. With<br>
different transfer rations, the required tin roller shaft speed<br>
is achieved. The piston (14) in the variator cylinder controls<br>
the position of the taper sheives (5.1 &amp; 5.2). the position of<br>
the pistorn (14) is electronically controlled and the speed at<br>
which the machine is to be run as per the programmed settings<br>
(11) threads in electronic speed control unit (9) . Also, in case<br>
of frequency fluctuations, the speed of the tin roller shaft<br>
vary, which is monitored by tin roller shaft (12) and the sensor<br>
input is communicated to electronic control unit (9) which then<br>
effectuates necessary correction signals.<br>
The above speed control device (5) works in tandem with an online<br>
production monitoring system (2) to effectively vary the<br>
spindle speed of the spinning machine (1) as seen from Fig. 4.<br>
The on-line production monitoring system (2) has machine<br>
stations (3) available for every spinning machine. The machine<br>
station (3) collects informations such as spindle speed and end<br>
breaks from machine and passed on to a control unit (4) which<br>
consolidates the information and presents the report to the<br>
user. The device (5) collects these end breaks and spindle speed<br>
information directly from machine station (3) and alters the<br>
spindle speed of spinning machine after analysing the data based<br>
on the methods explained sufficiently in detail in Figs. 7 and<br>
8. The device (5) explained here can be either variator driven<br>
as explained in Fig. 3A and 3B or inverter driven as explained<br>
in Fig. 5.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a speed control device for inverter drivers<br>
spinning machines. The motor (1) gets the speed signal from<br>
inverter (2) which can be of any type through an electronic<br>
control unit (3) . The electronic control unit (3) gets sensor<br>
inputs (5) from machine, and machine input (4) set by user to<br>
give necessary speed signal to inverter (2).<br>
Reference is now invited to the illustration in accompanying<br>
Fig. 6 when the construction detail of the electronic control<br>
unit are provided in the form of a functional schematic diagram.<br>
The electronic control unit consists of two Micro controllers<br>
controlled by the software in their respective ROMs. One of the<br>
micro controllers MC1 receives user input such as settings from<br>
the keyboard through a Keyboard / Display controller and<br>
transfers serially to the other controller MC2. The same<br>
settings are stored in a Non-volatile RAM (NVRAM) controller.<br>
MC2 reads the setting and stores it in the RAM sequentially.<br>
End break information from the machine station (of the on-line<br>
monitoring system) is acquired and processed by the micro<br>
controller MC2 and stored in the RAM memory.<br>
Information on stops, doffs, tinroller speed and front roller<br>
speed which is necessary for the functioning of the device are<br>
obtained by Input/Output control unit and transferred to MC1.<br>
After completion of the observation cycle, Controller 2 (MC2)<br>
calculates the reference speed and also the EBR. Now EBR is<br>
compared with the corresponding block settings available in the<br>
memory and the speed is transferred serially to the Controller 1<br>
(MC1), whereafter the controller bypasses all the pattern<br>
control and the control is switched to the new speed calculated<br>
and assigned by the Controller 2 (MC2).<br>
In particular, in the electronic control unit the said<br>
Controller 1 (MC1) performs two serial operations a)<br>
Communication with the PC (Bi-directional) and b) Communication<br>
with the Controller 2 (MC2) (Bi-directional), while Controller 2<br>
(MC2) performs two serial operations a) Communication with<br>
Controller 1 (MC1) (Bi-directional) and b) Communication with<br>
Machine Station (Unidirectional).<br>
The above functional operation is the same for both Inverter<br>
based and variator based systems. The difference only being in<br>
the mode of effecting the change in speed. In the case of<br>
Inverter, MC1 gives the change signal through a Digital to<br>
analog converter (DAC).<br>
In case of Variator based system the speed change will be<br>
effected through a pneumatic control unit.<br>
Optionally, the electronic control unit can be connected a<br>
personal computer for data storage display and long-term<br>
analysis.<br>
Fig. 7 explains the instantaneous speed control method with<br>
respect to single setting condition. The method allows the use<br>
of a single set of parameters set by the user to vary the speed<br>
profile of a build up. The various critical parameters are upper<br>
and lower end break limits, observations and correction time,<br>
speed increase/decrease %. These are briefly explained below.<br>
• Observation time - Time for which end break is to be observed<br>
• Correction time - Time for which speed correction is to be<br>
done based on the observation.<br>
• Maximum and minimum end break limit<br>
• Maximum and minimum speed limite<br>
• Speed increase and decrease percentage<br>
Depending on the number of end breaks and speed during the<br>
observation period (reference Fig. 5), speed correction is done<br>
in the successive period. There are three possibilities of end<br>
breaks occurance here. The conditions explained below provides<br>
how the method reacts to these conditions.<br>
1. If End Breaks are within minimum and maximum limit, then speed<br>
remains the same as during the observation period.<br>
2. If End Breaks are less than minimum limit, then speed<br>
increases from average of speeds during observation time by<br>
the % speed increase set.<br>
3. If End Breaks are greater than maximum limit, then speed<br>
decrease from average speeds during the observation time by<br>
the % speed decrease set.<br>
Referring to Fig. 7 if observation period 13 is consideredd, the<br>
end breaks (next period) obtains at that period are more than<br>
the upper limit (12 EB/100 spdl. Hours) and hence the speed for<br>
period 14 is reduced by the set percentage. For the other<br>
observation periods, the table below explains the modalities of<br>
operation.<br>
Fig. 8 explains instantaneous speed control method with respect<br>
to multiple setting conditions. The method, allows instead of a<br>
single setting provision for various parameters lime upper and<br>
lower limits etc., a multiple setting provision. Each setting<br>
provision can be provided for different blocks of time/length<br>
zones within a build-up (Ref. Fig. 8 for an example) . Each block<br>
have a separate set of control settings to operate. This is<br>
advantageous over single setting provision for an entire doff.<br>
In situations, where in the initial stages of speed profile (for<br>
example, normally upto 30 minutes) in which higher end breaks<br>
are associated, a higher increase/decrease in percentage may not<br>
be wanted where as the same percentage increase/decrease may be<br>
the optimum levels for other length/time zones within doff.<br>
Hence, a separate setting provision for initial stages may be<br>
required and similarly for other time/length zones.<br>
It is thus possible by way of the system of the present<br>
invention to provide a system and method for controlling breaks<br>
and maintaining uniform spinning tension of a longitudinally<br>
stretched article in a spinning machine wherein control of end<br>
breaks and uniform spinning tension is effected by means<br>
collecting and analyzing end break and spindle speed of the said<br>
machine continuously and means determining and providing for the<br>
spindle speed likely to reduce end breaks. The invention further<br>
provides for a closed loop on-line production monitoring system<br>
and method wherein spinning machine speed is controlled based on<br>
end breakage data. Accordingly, the system of the invention is<br>
adapted for the control of the spindle speed based on end<br>
breakaging data with for variator driven spinning machines and<br>
also the inverter driven spinning machines.<br>
