				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>A data-optimized communication system provides support for legacy access terminals, such as access terminals operating under the 1xEV-DO standard. The system also supports multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications with access terminals configured to support MIMO. A number of MIMO spatial signatures are predefined or negotiated. MIMO rank and an identifier of the spatial signature determined at the MIMO access terminal are sent on the 1-Branch and Q-Branch of the existing IxEV-DO structure. In one embodiment, 1-bit rank and 3-bit spatial signature are transmitted through the I-Branch as a 4-bit symbol, replacing the data rate control (DRC) channel. In another embodiment, a 4-bit spatial signature is transmitted through the I-Branch, also replacing the DRC channel. A 2-bit rank is transmitted together with a 4-bit DRC channel through the Q-Branch. The 2-bit rank and the DRC channel can be distinguished because they are sent using different orthogonal codeword Walsh covers.</td>

FEEDBACK CHANNEL DESIGN FOR MULTIPLE-INPUT MULTIPLE-OUTPUT COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS<br>
Claim of Priority under 35 U.S.C. ยง119<br>
[0001]	The present Application for Patent claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent<br>
Application Serial Number 60/775,443, entitled Wireless Communication System and Method, filed on February 21, 2006; the present Application for Patent also claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial Number 60/775,693, entitled DO Communication System and Method, filed on February 21, 2006. Each of these Provisional Patent Applications is assigned to the assignee of the present Application and is expressly incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein, including all figures, tables, and claims.<br>
BACKGROUND Field<br>
[0002]	The present invention relates  generally to telecommunications,  and, more<br>
specifically, the invention relates to multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) cellular communication systems.<br>
Background<br>
[0003]	A   modem   communication   system   is   expected   to   provide   reliable   data<br>
transmission for a variety of applications, such as voice and data applications. In a point-to-multipoint communications context, known communication systems are based on frequency division multiple access (FDMA), time division multiple access (TDMA), code division multiple access (CDMA), and perhaps other muhiple access communication schemes.<br>
[0004]	A CDMA system may be designed to support one or more CDMA standards,<br>
such as (1) the "TIA/EIA-95 Mobile Station-Base Station Compatibility Standard for Dual-Mode Wideband Spread Spectrum Cellular System" (this standard with its enhanced revisions A and B may be referred to as the "IS-95 standard"), (2) the "TIA/EIA-98-C Recommended Minimum Standard for Dual-Mode Wideband Spread Spectrum Cellular Mobile Station" (the "IS-98 standard"), (3) the standard sponsored by<br><br>
a consortium named "3rd Generation Partnership Project" (3GPP) and embodied in a set of documents known as the "W-CDMA standard," (4) the standard sponsored by a consortium named "3rd Generation Partnership Project 2" (3GPP2) and embodied in a set of documents including the "TR-45.5 Physical Layer Standard for cdma2000 Spread Spectrum Systems," the "C.S0005-A Upper Layer (Layer 3) Signaling Standard for cdma2000 Spread Spectrum Systems," and the "TIAyEIA/IS-856 cdma2000 High Rate Packet Data Air Interface Specification" (the "cdma2000 standard" collectively), (5) the IxEV-DO standard (occasionally referred to as simply "DO") with its revisions 0/A/B, and (6) certain other standards. The standards expressly listed above are incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein, including annexes, appendices, and other attachments.<br>
[0005]	Data-optimized or "DO" cellular communication systems have been developed<br>
to satisfy the constantly increasing demand for wireless data services. Data-optimized systems include systems operating under the IxEV-DO standard mentioned above. As the name implies, DO systems are optimized for data transmission (as opposed to voice transmission), and in particular such systems are optimized for downlink data transmission. Data-optimized systems need not exclude uplink data transmission, or voice transmission in either direction. It should be noted that voice may also be transmitted as data, for example, in the case of voice over internet protocol (VoIP) transmissions.<br>
[0006]	A MIMO system employs multiple (NT) transmit antennae and multiple (NR)<br>
receive antennae for data transmission. A MIMO channel formed by the NT transmit and NR receive antennae may be decomposed into Ns independent channels, which are also referred to  as spatial channels, where//^ 
independent channels corresponds to a dimension.   The MIMO system can provide<br>
improved performance  (e.g.,  higher  throughput  and/or  greater  reliability)  if the<br>
additional dimensions created by the multiple transmit and receive antennae are used.<br>
[0007]	For a full-rank MIMO channel, where  N^ =^Nj <n an independent data></n>
stream may be transmitted from each of the A^'j, transmit antennae. The transmitted data streams may experience different channel conditions (e.g., different fading and multipath effects) and may achieve different signal-to-interference-and-noise ratios (SINRs) for a given amount of transmit power.   Moreover, if successive interference<br><br>
cancellation processing is used at the receiver to recover the transmitted data streams, then different SINRs may be achieved for the data streams depending on the specific order in which the data streams are recovered. Consequently, different data rates may be supported by different data streams, depending on their achieved SINRs. Since the channel conditions typically vary with time, the data rate supported by each data stream also varies with time.<br>
1008]	The use of MIMO transmission techniques allows increased spectral efficiency,<br>
an important performance characteristic of wireless systems.<br>
1009]	Therefore, there is a need in the art for methods, apparatus, and articles of<br>
manufacture that would allow the use of MIMO techniques in wireless systems, including cellular wireless systems. There is also a need in the art for methods, apparatus, and articles of manufacture that would allow the use of MIMO techniques while maintaining backward compatibility with legacy access terminals. There is a further need for methods, apparatus, and articles of manufacture for adapting existing data-optimized systems such as systems operating under the IxEV-DO revisions 0, A, and B for operation employing MIMO techniques.<br>
SUMMARY<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0041]	In this document, the words "embodiment," "variant," and similar expressions<br>
are used to refer to particular apparatus, process, or article of manufacture, and not necessarily to the same apparatus, process, or article of manufacture. Thus, "one embodiment" (or a similar expression) used in one place or context can refer to a particular apparatus, process, or article of manufacture; the same or a similar expression in a different place can refer to a different apparatus, process, or article of manufacture. The expression "alternative embodiment" and similar phrases are used to indicate one of a number of different possible embodiments. The number of possible embodiments is not necessarily limited to two or any other quantity.<br><br>
)42]	The word "exemplary" is used herein to mean "serving as an example, instance,<br>
or illustration." Any embodiment or variant described herein as "exemplary" is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments or variants. All of the embodiments and variants described in this description are exemplary embodiments and variants provided to enable persons skilled in the art to make or use the invention, and not to limit the scope of legal protection afforded the invention.<br>
[0043]	The word "traffic" generally refers to payload or user traffic, such as data other<br>
than air interface control information and pilots. For reverse link, data traffic is generally generated by an application, such a vocoder of a VoIP application.<br>
[0044]	A "link" (e.g., a forward or reverse link) may be a MIMO layer or another type<br>
of MIMO channel, as will be better understood after reading this document and reviewing the Figures.<br>
[0045]	An access terminal, also referred to as AT, subscriber station, user equipment,<br>
UE, mobile terminal, or MT, may be mobile or stationary, and may communicate with one or more base transceiver stations. An access terminal may be any of a number of types of devices, including but not limited to PC card, external or internal modem, wireless telephone, and personal digital assistant (PDA) with wireless communication capability. An access terminal transmits and receives data packets to or from a radio network controller through one or more base transceiver stations.<br>
[0046]	Base transceiver stations and base station controllers are parts of a network<br>
referred to as radio network, RN, access network, or AN. A radio network may be a UTRAN or UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network. The radio network may transport voice and data packets between multiple access terminals. The radio network may be further connected to additional networks outside the radio network, such as a corporate intranet, the Internet, a conventional public switched telephone network (PSTN), or another radio network, and may transport data and voice packets between each access terminal and such outside networks. Depending on conventions and on the specific implementations, a base transceiver station may be referred to by other names, including Node-B, base station system, BSS, and simply base station. Similarly, a base station controller may be referred to by other names, including radio network controller, RNC, mobile switching center, or serving GPRS support node.<br><br>
[0047]	The scope of the invention extends to these and similar wireless communication<br>
system components.<br>
[0048]	FIG.   1  illustrates selected components of a wireless communication radio<br>
network 101 configured to operate in accordance with various embodiments and variants described herein. The network 101 may include a radio network controller 110 (or several such devices) coupled to one or more base transceiver stations 120, each with one or more sectors. The base transceiver stations 120 receive reverse link wireless communication signals from and transmit forward link wireless communication signals to one or more access terminals 130. Each base transceiver station 120 may include a transmitter chain and a receiver chain, with each chain including a plurality of components associated with signal transmission and reception, respectively, such as processors, modulators, multiplexers, demodulators, demultiplexers, encoders, decoders, interleavers, deinterleavers, and antennae.<br>
[0049]	The base transceiver stations 120 communicate with access terminals 130A,<br>
130B, 130C, and 130D through wireless connections 140. The radio network controller 110 is coupled to a public switched telephone network 150 through a telephone switch 160, and to a packet switched network 170 through a packet data server node (PDSN) 180. Data interchange between various network elements, such as the radio network controller 110 and the packet data server node 180, may be implemented using any number of protocols, for example, the Internet Protocol (IP), an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) protocol, Tl, El, frame relay, and other protocols.<br>
[0050]	In the illustrated embodiment, the radio network 101 is a data-optimized cellular<br>
CDMA radio network, for example, a IxEV-DO 0/A/B radio network. The radio network 101 provides both data communication services and cellular telephone (voice) services to the access terminals 130. In alternative embodiments, the radio network may provide only data services (including VoIP and similar packetized data-based voice communications).<br>
[0051]	Multiple or even all of the access terminals 130 may be in the same cell or site,<br>
or each access terminal 130 may be in a separate cell or site.<br>
[0052]	A typical  access terminal   130  includes  receiver circuitry   131,  transmitter<br>
circuitry 132, encoder 133, decoder 134, equalizer 135, processor 136, and memory device 137.   The receiver circuitry 131 may include multiple receiver elements and<br><br>
receiver chains, to enable simultaneous receipt of signals through two or more antermae.<br>
Similarly, the transmitter circuitry 132 may include two or more transmitter elements<br>
and chains, to enable simultaneous transmission from two or more antermae. The<br>
antennae used for transmitting and receiving may be the same or different antermae.<br>
The receiver, transmitter, encoder, decoder, and equalizer are configured by the<br>
processor executing program code stored in the memory device. Each access terminal<br>
130 is configured to communicate data using at least one transmission protocol, such as<br>
the wireless packet transmission protocols described in the standards mentioned above,<br>
including IxEV-DO with its revisions. In variants, at least one of the access terminals<br>
130 is further configured to employ MIMO techniques described throughout this<br>
document in the process of communicating with the base transceiver stations 120.<br>
[0053]	Each of the base transceiver stations 120 includes one or more wireless receivers<br>
(e.g., receivers 121 of the BTS 120A), one or more wireless transmitters (e.g., transmitters 122 of the BTS 120A), radio network controller interface (e.g., interface 123), a memory (e.g., memory 124), a processor (e.g., processor 125), and encoder/decoder circuitry (e.g., encoder/decoder circuitry 126). As in the case of the access terminals 130, the BTS receivers may include multiple receiver elements and chains, and the BTS transmitters may include multiple transmitter elements and chains, thus enabling reception and transmission through multiple antennae of the BTS 120. The receivers, transmitters, and other components of each base transceiver station are configured by the station's processor operating under control of the program code stored in the BTS's memory, to establish forward and reverse linlcs with the access terminals 130, in order to send packets to and receive packets from the access terminals 130. In the case of data services, for example, the base transceiver stations 120 may receive forward link data packets from the packet switched network 170 through the packet data server node 180 and through the radio network controller 110, and transmit these packets to the access terminals 130. The base transceiver stations 120 may receive reverse linlc data packets that originate at the access terminals 130, and forward these packets to the packet switched network 170 through the radio network controller 110 and the packet data server node 180. In the case of telephone (voice) services, the base transceiver stations 120 may receive forward link data packets from the telephone network 150 through the telephone switch 160 and through the radio network controller<br><br>
110, and transmit these packets to the access terminals 130. Voice packets originating at the access teraiinals 130 may be received at the base transceiver stations 120 and forwarded to the telephone network 150 via the radio network controller 110 and the telephone switch 160.<br>
[0054]	In some embodiments, the transmitters, receivers, and other components of each<br>
BTS may each have separate processors.<br>
[0055]	The radio  network  controller  110  includes  an interface   111   to  the base<br>
transceiver stations 120, an interface 112 to the packet data server node 180, and an interface 113 to the telephone switch 160. The interfaces 111, 112, and 113 operate under control of one or more processors 114 executing program code stored in one or more memory devices 115.<br>
[0056]	A person skilled in the art would recognize, after perusal of this document, that<br>
alternative embodiments in accordance with aspects of the invention need not be limited to any particular number of public switched telephone networks, packet switched networks, base station controllers, base transceiver stations, access terminals, or other network components. For example, a lesser or a greater number of base transceiver stations, radio network controllers, and access terminals may be included in some embodiments. Furthermore, the radio network 101 may connect the access terminals 130 to one or more additional communication networks, for example, a second wireless communication network having a number of wireless access terminals.<br>
[0057]	In some variants, the radio network 101 may employ orthogonal frequency<br>
division multiplexing (OFDM), which effectively partitions the operating frequency band into a number of (Nj,) frequency sub-channels (i.e., frequency bins). During each time slot (which is a particular time interval that may be dependent on the bandwidth of the frequency sub-channel), a modulation symbol may be transmitted on each of the Np. frequency sub-channels. OFDM operation is not a requirement of the invention.<br>
[0058]	In variants, the radio network and one or more of the access terminals are<br>
configured to employ MIMO techniques described throughout this document in the process of communicating with each other.<br>
[0059]	FIG. 2 illustrates selected components of an exemplary anterma system 200 of<br>
one or more of the base transceiver stations 120 of the radio network of FIG. 1. The antenna system 200 has three antenna groups.    The first antenna group includes<br><br>
antennae 205 and 210, a second antenna group includes antennae 215 and 220, and a third antenna group includes antennae 225 and 230. Only two antennae are shown for each of the antenna groups, but as a person skilled in the art would recognize after perusal of this document, a different number of antennae may be included in each of the antenna groups. Additionally, a different number of antenna groups may be present. As shown in FIG. 2, the access terminal 130A is in communication with the antermae 225 and 230 over a forward link 255 and a reverse link 260; the access terminal 13 OB is in communication with antennae 205 and 210 over a forward link 265 and a reverse link 270. The linlcs 255 and 260 are parts of one of the wireless connections 140 of FIG. 1, for example, 140A; the linlcs 265 and 270 are parts of another wireless connection of FIG. 1, for example 1408.<br>
[0060]	Each antenna group and/or the area in which the group is designated to<br>
communicate with the access terminals 130 may be referred to as a "sector" of the corresponding base transceiver station 120. In communication over the forward, links 255 and 265, the transmitting antennae of the base transceiver station 120 may use, for example, beam-forming techniques in order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the forward links for the different access terminals 130. Additionally, a base transceiver station using beam-forming to transmit to access terminals scattered randomly throughout its coverage area causes less interference to mobile devices in neighboring cells and sectors than a base transceiver station transmitting through a single antenna to all access terminals in its coverage area. It should be noted, however, that MIMO communications in accordance with some variants are not limited to beam-forming techniques.<br>
[0061]	In MIMO communications, a "spatial signature" for a receiver is given by a<br>
channel response vector (for each frequency band) between the A'^ transmit antermae and each of the A'^ receive antermae at the particular receiver. (It should be understood that an access terminal 130 may be a receiver or a transmitter, depending on the direction of the communication; similarly, a base transceiver station may also be a receiver or a transmitter.) In other words, a spatial signature is a radio frequency characterization of the propagation paths between the transmit and receive antennae. A "rank" is the number of eigen-raodes in the channel with non-zero energy. The rank determines how many data streams or signals can actually be sent from a MIMO system<br><br>
transmitter and separated at the MIMO system receiver. Beam-forming is a special case in which rank is equal to one.<br>
[0062]	For the forward link transmissions, the access terminals 130 may estimate the<br>
various spatial physical channels, derive spatial signatures and ranks from the charmel estimates, and report the spatial signatures and ranks to the base transceiver station 120 through existing control channels on the reverse links. The base transceiver station 120 may then process the spatial signatures and ranlcs received from the access terminals 130 to select access terminals 130 for data transmission, and to derive mutually orthogonal steering vectors for each of the independent data streams to be transmitted to the selected terminals. Additionally, on the reverse link the base transceiver station 120 may derive the spatial signatures of the different access terminals 130, process these signatures to schedule terminals for data transmission, and further process the transmissions from the scheduled access terminals 130 to demodulate separately each transmission.<br>
[0063]	A way is needed to report spatial signature and rank information from the access<br>
terminals 130 to the base transceiver stations 120. This document describes a structure incorporating in an existing DO system support for the reporting of forward link spatial signature and rank information on the reverse linlc. In particular, this document describes enhancements of existing IxEV-DO systems that allow access terminals to provide MIMO spatial signature and ranlc components on the reverse link, while preserving compatibility with legacy IxEV-DO access terminals. In these systems, the existing IxEV-DO reverse link feedback mechanisms are used to transmit the spatial signature and rank components to the base transceiver station 120 of the radio network.<br>
[0064]	FIG. 3 illustrates selected blocks of a portion of a transmitter 300 of the access<br>
terminal 130 configured to encode and modulate spatial signature and rank information for transmission to the base transceiver station 120 on a reverse link. Here, three bits are used for the spatial signature and one bit is used for the rank of forward link MIMO, corresponding to the case of two transmit antennae in the serving sector of the base transceiver station 120.<br>
[0065]	Two branches are shown in FIG. 3: (1) an In-Phase or I-Branch 310, and (2) a<br>
Quadrature or Q-Branch 330. The I-Branch 310 includes a Bi-Orthogonal Encoder 312, a Codeword Walsh Cover (JV^) component 314, a Signal Point Mapper 316, an SRC<br><br>
and SSC Gain element 318, a Repeater (x8) 320, and a Modulator 322. The Q-Branch 330 includes a Bi-Orthogonal Encoder 332, a Codeword Walsh Cover (W^') component 334, a Signal Point Mapper 336, a DRC Channel Gain element 338, Modulators 340 and 342, and another Walsh Cover W^^^^j component 344.  All component blocks of<br>
the I-Branch 310 and the Q-Branch 330 may be arranged as shown in FIG. 3.<br>
[0066]	Spreading is applied to the physical transmission channels.    The spreading<br>
includes channelization and scrambling. Channelization transforms every data symbol into a number of chips, thus increasing the bandwidth of the signal. The number of chips per data symbol is called the Spreading Factor or SF. In the scrambling operation, a scrambling code is applied to the spread signal. With the channelization, data symbols on the I-Branch 310 and the Q-Branch 330 are independently multiplied with an Orthogonal Variable Spreading Factor (OVSF) code. The resulting signals on the I-Branch 310 and the Q-Branch 330 are further multiplied by complex-valued scrambling code, where I and Q denote real and imaginary parts, respectively.<br>
[0067]	The structure of the Q-Branch 310 used for data rate control (DRC) feedback on<br>
the reverse link may be similar or identical to the corresponding structure of the IxEV-DO revision 0. In DO revision B, the ability to transmit four more bits of DRC (for another CDMA charmel) on the I-Branch was added. (Thus, in DO revision B DRCs for up to four forward CDMA channels could be transmitted on one reverse link.) The Q-Branch 310 and the I-Branch 330 have now been additionally modified to carry the spatial rank information on the spatial rank channel (SRC) and the spatial signature information on the spatial signature channel (SSC). Thus, in the embodiment of FIG. 3, one-bit spatial ranlc channel and three-bit spatial signature channel replace the four-bit DRC at the input to the I-Branch of IxEV-DO system. The Bi-Orthogonal Encoder 312 now receives four SSC and SRC bits, instead of the same number of rate control DRC bits. If the replaced DRC bits are needed, for example, for multicarrier operation, they may be transmitted on another long code mask.<br>
[0068]	Note that three bits of SSC correspond to eight (or possibly fewer) distinct<br>
spatial signatures. The distinct spatial signatures may be predefined for the system or for each particular sector. In some variants, spatial signatures may be negotiated during connection setup between the particular access terminal and the particular base transceiver station.  In some variants, 5, 6, or 7 distinct predefined or negotiated spatial<br><br>
signatures are used. The number of the distinct spatial signatures may also be negotiated during connection setup.<br>
,069]	In the MIMO case with four transmit antennae, the number of bits for both the<br>
spatial rank channel and the spatial signature channel may increase. For example, the spatial signature my use four bits (instead of three), and the spatial rank may use two bits (instead of one). FIG. 4 illustrates selected blocks of a portion of a reverse link transmitter 400 of the access terminal 130 configured to encode and modulate four-bit spatial signature and two-spatial bit rank information for the case of four transtnit antennae.<br>
[0070]	I-Branch 410 of FIG. 4 may be similar or identical to the I-Branch 310 of FIG.<br>
3. As illustrated, it includes a Bi-Orthogonal Encoder 412, a Codeword Walsh Cover (WQ) component 414, a Signal Point Mapper 416, an SSC Gain element 418, a<br>
Repeater (x8) 420, and a Modulator 422. Q-Branch 430 includes a number of components similar or identical to analogously-numbered components of the Q-Branch 330 of FIG. 3: a Bi-Orthogonal Encoder 432, a Codeword Walsh Cover {W,') component 434, a Signal Point Mapper 436, a DRC Charmel Gain element 438, Modulators 440 and 442, and another Walsh Cover (W^^) component 444. Additionally,<br>
the Q-Branch 430 includes a Repeater (x4) 448, a Codeword Walsh Cover (W^-)<br>
component 450, a Signal Point Mapper 452, an SRC (Spatial Rank Channel) Gain<br>
element 454, a Repeater (x8) 456, and an adder 458. All component blocks of the I-<br>
Branch 410 and the Q-Branch 430 may be arranged in the configuration shown in FIG.<br>
4.<br>
[0071]	As shown in FIG. 4, a four-bit SSC symbol is input into the I-Branch 410,<br>
instead of the four-bit DRC of DO revision B. The additional DRC, if needed for another forward CDMA channel, may be transmitted on another long code mask. On the Q-Branch 430, a two-bit SRC symbol is sent together with a four-bit DRC symbol. The SRC and DRC are sent using different orthogonal codeword Walsh covers. For example, the SRC may be sent with the W{^ Walsh cover, and the DRC may be sent<br>
with the WQ  Walsh cover. Since the two Walsh covers are different, the SRC and DRC<br>
can be distinguished at the base transceiver station 120. This transmission mechanism is compatible with DO revision B.<br><br>
[0072]	Note that here four bits of SSC correspond to sixteen (or possibly fewer) distinct<br>
spatial signatures.    As in the previous case of three-bit SSC, the distinct spatial<br>
signatures may be predefined for the system, for each particular sector, or negotiated<br>
during connection setup.    In some variants, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, or 15 distinct<br>
predefined or negotiated spatial signatures are used.  The number of the distinct spatial<br>
signatures may also be negotiated during connection setup.<br>
[0073]	The Repeater 448 expands the two bits of the SRC to an eight-bit size, by<br>
repeating the two bit SRC four times (x4).<br>
[0074]	FIG. 5 illustrates selected steps of an exemplary process 500 performed at an<br>

appropriate forward linlc rate control, i.e., the DRC.<br>
[0080]	At step 525, the access terminal inputs the DRC into the Q-Branch of its<br>

The base transceiver station receives the slot transmitted by the access terminal,<br>
recovers the DRC information from the Quadrature signal component of the received<br>
slot, and recovers the spatial signature and rank information from the In-Phase signal<br><br>
component of the received slot.  The base transceiver station then configures itself for<br>
MIMO transmission in accordance with the received DRC, SRC, and SSC.<br>
]	FIG. 6 illustrates selected steps of an exemplary process 600 performed at an<br>
access terminal in accordance with the embodiment of FIG. 4.<br>
[0085]	At a flow point 601, the access terminal is in MIMO communication with a base<br>
transceiver station of a radio network.<br>
[0086]	At step 605, the access terminal estimates the various spatial physical paths<br>

identifier, based on the estimates.<br>
[0089]	At step 620, the access terminal determines the appropriate DRC, based on the<br>
estimates.<br>
[0090]	At step 625, the access terminal inputs the DRC and the two-bit spatial rank into<br>
the Q-Branch of its transmitter.  The DRC and the spatial rank are covered by different<br>
orthogonal Walsh codes, so that they can be separately decovered and distinguished at<br>
the base transceiver station.<br>
[0091]	At step 630, the access terminal inputs a spatial signature into the I-Branch of its<br>

repeat it for the next active slot.<br>
[0094]	The base transceiver station receives the slot transmitted by the access terminal,<br>
recovers the DRC and rank information (SRC) from the Quadrature signal component<br>
of the received slot, and recovers the spatial signature information (SSC) from the In-<br>
Phase component of the received slot.   The base transceiver station then configures<br>
itself for MIMO transmission in accordance with the received DRC, SRC, and SSC.<br>
[0095]	Note that the DRC transmitted on the Q-Branch may relate to the same or to a<br>
different MIMO forward link/channel as the SSC and the SRC transmitted concurrently.<br><br>
0096]	A few words describing the DO waveforms and adaptation of DO to MIMO (or<br>
MIMO to DO), and particularly regarding the forward link MIMO DO structure, may be useful for enhancing the reader's understanding of the topics discussed in this disclosure.<br>
[0097]	MIMO design has two modes of operation -single code word (SCW) mode and<br>
multiple-code word (MCW) mode. In the MCW mode, the transmitter may encode the data transmitted on each spatial layer (channel, link) independently, possibly with different rates. The receiver may employ a successive interference cancellation (SIC) algorithm, which works as follows. First, decode the first layer, and then subtract its contribution from the received signal after re-encoding and multiplying the encoded first layer with an "estimated channel," then decode the second layer, and so on with due alteration of the details. This "onion-peeling" approach means that each successively decoded layer sees increasing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and hence can support higher rates. In the absence of error-propagation, MCW design with SIC achieves greater capacity.<br>
[0098]	FIG. 7 shows selected blocks of an exemplary BTS design for MCW MIMO. In<br>
this design, one DRC value feedback is provided per spatial layer, and common acknowledgement stream is used, i.e., ACK until all layers decode.<br>
[0099]	In the SCW mode design, the transmitter may encode the data transmitted on<br>
each spatial layer with "identical data rates." The receiver may employ a low complexity linear receiver design such as a Minimum Mean Square Solution (MMSE) or Zero Frequency (ZF) receiver design, or non-linear receiver designs such as QRM, for each tone.<br>
[00100]	In MIMO SCW mode, a single packet may be encoded and sent through selected<br>
transmit antennae or a number of spatial beams that are determined by the rank, which is provided by the access terminal on the reverse link. A single hybrid ARQ state machine and DRC feedback may be used as in DO Revision B. When MIMO SCW with preceding is used, spatial signatures are sent to the radio network using predefined codebook of unitary matrices. The access terminal selects the preferred beam pattem(s) for the forward linlc based on common spatial pilots and sends an identifier of the pattern to the radio network. (As discussed above, only the number identiiying the particular spatial signature then is transmitted to the BTS.) Note that preceding with the<br><br>
rank equal to 1 is transmit beamforming. Cyclic delay diversity and antenna selection can be realized through codebook design. FIG. 8 shows selected blocks of an exemplary BTS design for SCW MIMO with preceding and OFDM.<br>
[00101]	As noted above, OFDM operation is not a requirement of the invention. It may,<br>
however, be desirable to use OFDM and/or single-carrier frequency division multiplexing (SC-FDM) for data sent in the traffic segments of slots. OFDM and SC-FDM partition the available bandwidth into multiple orthogonal subcarriers, which are also referred to as tones, bins and by similar appellations. Each subcarrier may be modulated with data. In general, modulation symbols are sent in the frequency domain with OFDM and in the time domain with SC-FDM. OFDM and SC-FDM have certain desirable characteristics such as the ability to readily combat intersymbol interference (ISI) caused by frequency selective fading. OFDM can also efficiently support MIMO and SDMA, which may be applied independently on each subcarrier and may thus provide good performance in a frequency selective charmel.<br>
[00102]	It may be desirable to support OFDM while retaining backward compatibility<br>
with DO Revisions 0, A and B. In DO, the pilot and MAC segments may be demodulated by all active teraiinals at all times, whereas the traffic segments may be demodulated by only the terminals being served. Hence, backward compatibility may be achieved by retaining the pilot and MAC segments and modifying the traffic segments. OFDM data may be sent in a DO waveform by replacing the CDM data in a given 400-chip traffic segment with one or more OFDM symbols having a total duration of 400 chips or less.<br>
[00103]	FIG. 9 illustrates a slot structure that supports CDM on a DO forward link. The<br>
transmission timeline is partitioned into slots. Each slot has duration of 1.667 milliseconds (ms) and spans 2048 chips. Each chip has duration of 813.8 nanoseconds (ns) for a chip rate of 1.2288 mega chips/second (Mcps). Each slot is divided into two identical half-slots. Each half-slot includes (1) an overhead segment composed of a pilot segment at the center of the half-slot and two Media Access Control (MAC) segments on both sides of the pilot segment, and (2) two traffic segments on both sides of the overhead segment. The traffic segments may also be referred to as traffic channel segments, data segments, data fields, and similar expressions. The pilot segment carries pilot and has duration of 96 chips.  Each MAC segment carries signaling (e.g., reverse<br><br>
power control or RPC information) and has duration of 64 chips. Each traffic segment carries traffic data {e.g., unicast data for specific terminals, broadcast data, etc.) and has duration of 400 chips.<br>
[00104]	Note that the CDM data shown in FIG. 9 may be selectively replaced with<br>
OFDM symbols, as is described in more detail in U.S. Patent Application entitled Flexible Time-Frequency Multiplexing Structure for Wireless Communication, attorney Docket Number 061757, filed on the same date as the present application; see also U.S. Patent Application entitled Spatial Pilot Structure for Multi-Antenna Wireless Communication, attorney Docket Number 070022, filed on the same date as the present application. The applications with the docket numbers 061757 and 070022 are assigned to the assignee of the present Application and are expressly incorporated as if fully set forth herein, including all figures, tables, and claims.<br>
[00105]	DO Revisions 0, A, and B use CDM for data sent in the traffic segments.   A<br>
traffic segment may carry CDM data for one or more terminals being served by a BTS. The traffic data for each terminal may be processed based on coding and modulation parameters determined by channel feedback received from that terminal to generate data symbols. The data symbols for the one or more teiTninals may be demultiplexed and covered with Walsh functions or codes to generate the CDM data for the traffic segment. The CDM data is thus generated in the time domain using Walsh functions. A CDM traffic segment is a traffic segment carrying CDM data.<br>
[00106]	FIG. 10 shows a single-carrier slot structure that supports OFDM in DO.   For<br>
simplicity, only one half-slot is shown. The half-slot includes (1) an overhead segment composed of a 96-chip pilot segment at the center of the half-slot and two 64-chip MAC segments on both sides of the pilot segment, and (2) two traffic segments on both sides of the overhead segment. In general, each traffic segment may carry one or more OFDM symbols. As shown in FIG. 10, each traffic segment carries two OFDM symbols, and each OFDM symbol has duration of 200 chips and is sent in one OFDM symbol period of 200 chips.<br>
[00107]	Space-Division Multiple Access (SDMA) provides additional dimensions.  With<br>
SDMA, spatially-separable users (i.e., ATs) may be served with the same physical resources. Each spatially-separable AT feeds back the beam coefficients (according to a predefined codebook) to be used for forward link transmissions matched to the AT's<br><br>
forward link channel. SDMA is similar to MCW, except that different spatial layers may be designated to different ATs.<br>
[00108]	Turning now to the codebook design for multi-antenna operation, including<br>
SDMA and MIMO, different modes may be supported simultaneously, depending on the terminal channel quality and flow type (enabled by the codebook design). The codebook may be segmented into multiple sets, such as preceding transmission set, SDMA transmission set, and sets for different beam patterns. An AT and the radio network may negotiate the particular codebook set to be used for the AT's forward link, or the set may be fixed. A feedback index may then be used to indicate the desired mode for the AT.<br>
[00109]	FIG. 11 illustrates a multi-carrier slot structure 400 that supports OFDM in DO.<br>
In DO Revision B, multiple IxEV-DO waveforms may be multiplexed in the frequency domain to obtain a multi-carrier DO waveform that fills a given spectral allocation and is transmitted on a first transmit antenna. As illustrated in FIG. 11, one DO waveform is configured as a legacy channel including the pilot and MAC segments that may be demodulated by all active terminals, whereas the traffic segments may be demodulated by only the terminals being served. Hence, backward compatibility may be achieved by retaining the pilot and MAC segments. Also shown in FIG. 11 are three IxEV-DO waveforms configured as non-legacy channels, transmitted on respective second, third and fourth transmit antennae, which do not require the overhead segments, because the OFDM symbols include periodic composite pilots (dedicated spatial pilots) embedded in the subbands or tones. In other words, some OFDM tones may be used as the dedicated pilots. A MIMO access terminal may receive the composite pilot in the OFDM symbols and is able to derive an estimate of the MIMO channel response..<br>
[00110]	FIGs. 12A-12D illustrate an exemplary pilot transmission scheme for a multi-<br>
antenna OFDM system. The spatial pilot tones may be differently formed according to the number of layers or beams that are formed by the multi-antenna OFDM system. FIG. 12A illustrates a single layer transmission across a half-slot of OFDM symbols 1-4. As illustrated for each OFDM symbol (such as OFDM symbol 1), the single layer spatial pilot tone repeats and occupies one tone for every 19 data tones. For a 180 tone OFDM symbol, there would be nine single layer spatial pilot tones. Specifically, for OFDM symbol 1 and OFDM symbol 3, the single layer spatial pilot tone is illustrated as<br><br>
beginning at tone one and repeating every 20 tones; and for OFDM symbol 2 and OFDM symbol 4, the single layer spatial pilot tone is illustrated as beginning halfway offset from the adjacent symbols at tone eleven and repeating every 20 tones. In an adjacent OFDM symbol, such as OFDM symbol 2, the single layer spatial pilot tones may be offset from the adjacent symbol's single layer spatial pilot tones. It is also noted that one OFDM symbol can leverage the offset position of an adjacent OFDM symbol's single layer spatial pilot tone for additional channel characterization without relying upon additional dedicated spatial pilot tones.<br>
[00111]	FIG.  12B illustrates a two layer transmission across a half-slot of OFDM<br>
symbols 1-4. As illustrated for each OFDM symbol, such as OFDM symbol 1, the first layer spatial pilot tone repeats and occupies one tone for every 19 data tones; and a second layer spatial tone is offset from the first and also repeats and occupies one tone for every 19 data tones. For a 180 tone OFDM symbol, there would be 18 first layer and second layer spatial pilot tones. Specifically, for OFDM symbol 1 and OFDM symbol 3, the first layer and second layer spatial pilot tones are illustrated as begirming at tone one and repeating every 10 tones and for OFDM symbol 2 and OFDM symbol 4, the first layer and second layer spatial pilot tones are illustrated as beginning halfway offset from the adjacent symbols at tone eleven and repeating every 10 tones. Accordingly, the bandwidth overhead for supporting the first layer and second layer spatial pilot tones is one in 10 or 10 percent per OFDM symbol for a two layer transmission.<br>
[00112]	FIG.  12C illustrates a three layer transmission across a half-slot of OFDM<br>
symbols 1-4. As illustrated for each OFDM symbol, the first layer spatial pilot tone repeats and occupies one tone for every 29 data tones, a second layer spatial pilot tone repeats and occupies one tone for every 29 data tones, and a third layer spatial pilot tone repeats and occupies one tone for every 29 data tones. The first layer, second layer, and third layer spatial pilot tones are staggered along the OFDM symbols 1-4 and repeat such that the first layer, second layer, and third layer spatial pilot tones repeat every 10 tones and occupy one tone for every nine data tones. For a 180 tone OFDM symbol, there would be 18 first layer, second layer, and third layer spatial pilot tones. Accordingly, the bandwidth overhead for supporting the first layer, second layer, and<br><br>
third layer spatial pilot tones is one in 10 or 10 percent per OFDM symbol for a three layer transmission.<br>
[00113]	FIG.  12D illustrates a four layer transmission across a half-slot of OFDM<br>
symbols 1-4. As illustrated for each OFDM symbol, the first layer spatial pilot tone repeats and occupies one tone for every 19 data tones, a second layer spatial pilot tone repeats and occupies one tone for every 19 data tones, a third layer spatial pilot tone repeats and occupies one tone for every 19 data tones, and a fourth layer spatial pilot tone repeats and occupies one tone for every 19 data tones. The first layer, second layer, third layer, and fourth layer spatial pilot tones are staggered along the OFDM symbols 1-4 and repeat such that the first layer, second layer, third layer, and fourth spatial pilot tones repeat every five tones and occupy one tone for every four data tones. For a 180 tone OFDM symbol, there would be 36 first layer, second layer, third layer, and fourth layer spatial pilot tones. Accordingly, the bandwidth overhead for supporting the first layer, second layer, third layer, and fourth layer spatial pilot tones is one in 5 or 20 percent per OFDM symbol for a four layer transmission.<br>
[00114]	Since the various layer spatial pilot tones are transmitted on different sets of<br>
pilot subbands in different symbol periods, this staggered pilot scheme allows the MIMO receivers to obtain pilot observations for more than their specific subbands without increasing the number of subbands used for pilot transmission in any one symbol period. For all pilot transmission schemes, the MIMO receivers may derive frequency response estimates for the channel based on their received symbols and using various channel estimation techniques.<br>
