				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a surfactant system for general use in agricultural compositions, including, but not limited to herbicidal, fungicidal and insecticidal formulations comprised of two components: an alkoxylated polyarylpheno! phosphate ester surfactant in combination with an alkoxylated lignosulfonate salt surfactant.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Alkylphenol ethoxylates (APE"s) and their anionic derivatives are surfactants that are well known to industry and have historically been relied upon heavily by agricultural chemical producers. However, formulations containing APEs do not always provide the most desirable combination of design specifications, e.g. product efficacy, working parameters and cost. Traditional non-APE surfactant systems have not been readily adaptable substitutes for APE surfactants. For example, depending on the formulation requirements, calcium dodecylbenzenesulfonate used in conjunction with fatty acid ethoxylates has proven to be an unacceptable APE substitute because of poor performance within one or more design parameters such as emulsion stability, acute toxicity, temporal and thermal stability, chemical and physical stability; solution, suspension or dilution dynamics, and viscosity and suspension stabilization. The inability of industry to adapt existing technology to improve upon characteristics of surfactant systems containing APEs has prompted the development of entirely new line APE surfactants. The additional challenge faced by the scientific community has been to develop new APE surfactants which can be easily made from readily available and cost effective raw materials. Accordingly, there continues to be a need for improved APE surfactants.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been discovered that the combination of alkoxylated polyarylphenol phosphate esters (or salts or acid forms thereof) with alkoxylated lignosulfonate salts provides a suitable surfactant system for general use in agricultural<br><br>
products. The surfactant system of the instant invention has been found to provide superior performance in aqueous suspension concentrates of pesticides. The instant invention includes the surfactant composition comprising one or more aikoxylated polyarylphenol phosphate esters (or salts or acid forms thereof) and one or more aikoxylated lignosulfonate salts. The invention also includes the agrochemical formulations containing the instantly disclosed surfactant system. In one embodiment of the invention, the compositions containing the instant surfactant system do not contain or are substantially free of other known APEs. The surfactants of the instant invention are obtained from combining the appropriate aikoxylated polyarylphenol phosphate ester with the appropriate aikoxylated lignosulfonate salt.<br>
The stearic configuration of the polyarylphenol group additionally seems to protect the appropriate aikoxylated polyarylphenol phosphate ester surfactant component of the surfactant system from hydrolytic cleavage typically observed in other known anionic phosphate based surfactant systems.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
One aspect of the invention is the surfactant system comprising: a) at least one aikoxylated polyarylphenol phosphate ester of the formula (1):<br><br>
wherein ]R^ independently is a straight chain or branched C2-C4 alkylene, R2 is phenyl, aryl or alkylaryl, wherein the phenyl nucleus in R2 is unsubstituted or substituted by one to three groups selected from the group consisting of CrC4 alkyl or Cr C4 alkoxy, and R3 and R4 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, sodium, potassium, and<br><br>
m, is 2 or 3, and n is a number from 1 to 150 inclusive, and b) at least one aikoxylated lignosulfonate salt.<br><br><br>
wherein n is defined as above, and R3 and R6 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, sodium, potassium, and<br><br><br>
A feature of the invention is where n is 4 to 25, preferably 16. Another aspect of the invention is wherein the surfactant system component (b) is an alkoxylated sulfonated kraft lignin, preferably an ethoxylated sulfonated kraft lignin. A feature of the invention is wherein the surfactant system component (b) is the sodium salt of an ethoxylated sulfonated kraft lignin having an EO equal to 2 to 4, preferably 3.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is the product obtained by the process of combining the components: a) at least one alkoxylated polyarylphenol phosphate ester of the formula (1):<br><br>
wherein Ri independently is a straight chain or branched C2-C4 alkylene, R2 is phenyl, aryl or alkylaryl, wherein the phenyl nucleus in R2 is unsubstituted or substituted by one to three groups selected from the group consisting of C,-C4 alkyl or CrC4 alkoxy, and R3 and R4 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, sodium, potassium, and<br><br>
m, is 2 or 3, and n is a number from 1 to 150 inclusive, and b)  at least one alkoxylated lignosulfonate salt.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is a chemically integrated surfactant composition comprising: a) at least one alkoxylated polyarylphenol phosphate ester of the formula (1):<br><br><br>
m, is 2 or 3, and n is a number from 1 to 150 inclusive, and b) at least one alkoxylated lignosulfonate salt.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the invention is the pesticide formulation wherein the pesticide is compound A having the formula:<br><br><br>
Another feature of the invention is the method of protecting crops comprising the step of applying to the locus of the crops in need of protection an agriculturally effective amount of the one or more of the compositions disclosed herein.<br>
The scope of the invention disclosed herein should not be construed to be limited by any particular chemical theory relating to the complexation, equilibration, reaction or acid-base chemistry of the components used to make the surfactants or other ingredients used to make other ultimately useful formulations (e.g. pesticide formulations). In this regard, another aspect of the invention is the surfactant system comprising one or more alkoxylated polyarylphenol phosphate esters (or salts or acid forms thereof) and one or more alkoxylated lignosulfonate salts wherein the constituent components may or may not have interacted chemically so as to result in a change in form of the components. The invention encompasses the static composition of the appropriate components admixed together as well as the chemically integrated surfactant system composition comprising at least one alkoxylated polyarylphenol phosphate ester and at least one alkoxylated lignosulfonate. "Static composition" denotes the composition composed of components wherein the components have not substantially changed by virtue of their combination with other composition components. "Chemically integrated composition" means a composition that results from the natural equilibration, complexation, dissociation or other chemical transformation if any that may occur after combination of the components and prior to ultimate use of the surfactant system in a pesticide formulation. Therefore, the "chemically integrated composition" of the instant invention by definition encompasses the situation where there is a "static composition" as well as any resultant composition occurring at any point in time between initial creation and ultimate use in the field of products containing the surfactant system. In other words, the disclosed invention is not limited to a static composition of chemically unaltered constituent components.<br>
The invention also includes the method of using the surfactant system as a substitute for known APE surfactants.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is the composition comprising the formulation of the surfactant system disclosed above in pesticide formulations that contain one or more other<br><br>
active ingredients. However, the invention is not limited to pesticide formulations. Other useful formulations that may contain the instantly disclosed surfactant system include shampoo formulations, detergent formulations generally and soap formulations used in the mining industry. The surfactant system presently disclosed is considered to have genera! applicability as a substitute for known APE surfactants, and therefore would be expected to be useful in many other known formulations. The invention encompasses any formulation obtained by otherwise substituting the instantly disclosed surfactant system for known APEs. The instantly disclosed invention also encompasses any formulation obtained by supplementing compositions containing APEs. Generally, any formulation that conventionally makes use of surfactant additives would be subject to modification by substitution or supplementation with the instantly disclosed surfactant system. Although the surfactant combination herein is disclosed as a surfactant system, it is expected that it will also have other nonsurfactant properties that may be useful independently of any inherent surfactant properties. Depending on the application of the instant invention, it may result in increased bioefficacy and/or reduced toxicity and irritation.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is the composition comprising the formulation of the surfactant system disclosed above in formulations that contain one or more herbicides and one or more safeners (antidotes). When applying herbicides, the cultivated plants may also suffer severe damage owing to factors that include the concentration of the herbicide and the mode of application, the cultivated plant itself, the nature of the soil, and the climatic conditions such as exposure.<br>
The alkoxylated polyarylphenol phosphate esters are either commercially available, prepared by known procedures or otherwise obtained using known chemistry. For example ethoxylated tristyrylphenol phosphate esters may be prepared from the corresponding tristyrylphenol ethoxylate by reaction with phosphorus pentoxide dissolved in phosphoric acid. The tristyrylphenol ethoxylate in turn may be prepared by treating tristyrylphenol with a base (e.g. sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide) followed by addition of the desired equivalents of ethylene oxide. Tristyrylphenol is either commercially available, may be prepared by known procedures or otherwise may be prepared using conventional chemistry knowledge. Also mixtures if different phenols (e.g. mixtures of tristyrylphenol and distyrylphenol) may be used as starting materials for preparing the phosphate ester surfactant components of the instant invention.<br>
The alkoxylated lignosulfonates are either commercially available, prepared by known procedures or otherwise obtained using known chemistry. For example, the alkoxylated<br><br>
lignosulfonates may be obtained by alkoxylation of the lignosulfonates using known alkylene oxide reagents, such as ethylene oxide. In particular, the desirable alkoxylated lignosulfonates are those selected from the group consisting of ethoxylated lignosulfonates, propoxylated lignosulfonates and butoxylated lignosulfonates. Other useful alkoxylated lignosulfonates are those compounds resulting from for example mixed alkoxylation whereby the alkylene oxide units introduced vary or alternate for example between ethylene oxide and propylene oxide. The degree of alkoxylation may vary depending on the desired formulation design parameters, e.g. emulsion stability of pesticide formulations.<br>
The lignosulfonates or sulfonated lignins used to make the alkoxylated lignosulfonates are well known in the art, and are for example derived from the sulfite pulping of wood and by sulfonation of lignins derived from the kraft pulping of wood. The lignin materials used are typically in the salt form (i.e. sodium, potassium, etc.). The lignosulfonates which may be utilized for preparing the alkoxylated lignosulfonate surfactants of the instant invention are commercially available, may be obtained from known procedures or otherwise prepared using known chemistry. Typically lignosulfonates may be obtained by sulfonation of spent sulfite liquors from wood conversion. It is preferable to use purified lignosulfonate material in which the sugars and other polysaccharide constituents have been removed and/or destroyed, or additionally inorganic constituents have been partially or fully eliminated.<br>
The alkoxylated lignosulfonates used to make the surfactant system of the invention are preferably those compounds that are readily available and inexpensive. However, cost of materials is only one factor in selecting the alkoxylated lignosulfonates starting materials. After performing a routine cost-benefit analysis and in view of other design parameters it may become apparent that more expensive and less readily available starting materials may be preferred.<br>
Typically the degree of alkoxylation in the alkoxylated polyarylphenoi phosphate ester and in the alkoxylated lignosulfonate is independently measured in terms of the average number of alkylene oxide units therein. The "average number of ethylene oxide units" is designated as an "EO" number. Similarly, the average number of propylene oxide and butylene oxide units is designated as a "PO" and "BO" number, respectively. "Average" is defined as the arithmetic mean of a set of real numbers. A preferred feature of the invention is where there is a continuous and symmetrical bell curve population distribution around the EO, PO or BO number. The alkoxylated surfactant components of the invention may contain mixtures of different alkoxy units, e.g. EO + PO + BO.   It is also desirable that<br><br>
there be low dispersion preferably within one standard deviation (a) of the mean (average EO).<br>
Table: Degree of alkoxylation in the surfactant system components.<br><br>
By "alkyl" is meant an alkyl group that may be linear or branched. By "aryl" is meant either a non-heteroaromatic ring system or heteroaromatic ring system. By "alkylaryl" is meant an aryl group substituted by one or more alkyl groups, wherein the "aryl" may be either a non-heteroaromatic ring system or heteroaromatic ring system.<br>
By "kraft lignin" is meant material typically recovered from alkaline pulping black liquors such as are produced in the kraft, soda and other well known alkaline pulping operations.<br>
By "sulfonated lignin" is meant the product which is obtained by the introduction of sulfonic acid groups into the kraft lignin molecule, as may be accomplished by reaction of the kraft lignin with sulfite or bisulfite compounds, so that the kraft lignin is rendered soluble in water.<br>
By "sulfite lignin" is meant the reaction product of lignin which is obtained during the sulfite pulping of wood, and is a principle constituent of spent sulfite liquor.<br>
By "alkoxylated lignosulfonate" is meant the reaction product obtained by alkoxylating lignosulfonates with an alkylene oxide, such as ethylene oxide.<br>
Another preferred feature of the present invention is the combination of the presently disclosed surfactant system with one or more co-surfactants. The co-surfactants are those compounds known in the art for formulating surfactant systems. The co-surfactants include<br><br>
polyglycol ethers, aliphatic alcohols, cycloaliphatic alcohols, alkylphenols (e.g. nonylphenol), saturated fatty acids, unsaturated fatty acids, polyglycol ether derivatives of aliphatic or cycloaliphatic alcohols, or saturated or unsaturated fatty acids. Said derivatives contain 3 to 30 glycol ether groups and 8 to 20 carbon atoms in the (aliphatic) hydrocarbon moiety. A more preferred co-surfactant is a nonionic co-surfactant, especially the nonionic co-surfactant selected from the group consisting of ethylene glycol and polyethylene glycol. Other preferred surfactants may include, castor oil ethoxylates, tristyrylphenol ethoxylates, ethylene oxide/propylene oxide block copolymers (pluronics), and/or ethylene oxide/propylene oxide block copolymers of aliphatic alcohols.<br>
A preferred aspect of the invention includes the combination of the surfactant system herein with a liquid pesticide composition so as to obtain an emulsifiable concentrate formulation which can be directly mixed with water or other aqueous solution to give an aqueous pesticide formulation without special mixing procedures.<br>
A preferred aspect of the invention includes the combination of the surfactant system herein with a solid pesticide composition so as to obtain a suspension concentrate formulation which can be directly mixed with water or other aqueous solution to give an aqueous pesticide formulation without special mixing procedures.<br>
A preferred aspect of the invention includes the combination of the surfactant system herein with a liquid pesticide composition and solid pesticide composition so as to obtain a suspoemulsion concentrate formulation which can be directly mixed with water or other aqueous solution to give an aqueous pesticide formulation without special mixing procedures.<br>
The following examples illustrate further some of the specific features of the invention but are not intended to limit its scope. Where not otherwise specified throughout this specification and claims, temperatures are given in degrees centigrade.<br>
