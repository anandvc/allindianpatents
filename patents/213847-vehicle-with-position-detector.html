THE PATENTS ACT 1970 [39 OF 1970]<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"VEHICLE WITH POSITION DETECTOR"<br><br><br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan, having a place of business at 1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to vehicle with position detector.<br>
The present invention relates to a vehicle with a position detector and"more particularly to a vehicle with" a position detector having a radio communication means for informing a supervisor of the position of the vehicle.<br>
[0002]<br>
[Prior Art]<br>
There is known a system wherein vehicles such as bicycles and motor-assisted bicycles are utilized by renting.  For example, in Japanese Patent Laid Open No. 142514/2000 - there is described a rental system wherein an ID card issued by a central control unit is used for unlocking a motor-assisted bicycle or for replacing a battery.<br>
[0003]<br>
[Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
In the above vehicle rental system, if a supervisor can detect positional information on rental vehicles, it will be useful in the operation of the rental system,<br><br><br>
including maintenance of the vehicles and accounting. The use of a radio communication means may be effective for information of a vehicle position.  In this case, however, the power consumption of the communication device used may become large, depending on the condition of radio wave.  Therefore, it is necessary to avoid a wasteful power consumption, or else the consumption of the battery as a power supply will be large.  From this standpoint it is preferable that the transmission and reception of radio wave be made intermittent, not constant, or the power be turned OFF during stop of the vehicle concerned.<br>
[0004]<br>
In case of performing the transmission and reception of radio wave intermittently, a vehicular stop position may be unable to be detected accurately at a certain difference between a power-OFF timing during vehicular stop and a position detecting timing by intermittent transmission and reception of radio wave. Therefore, it is desired to develop a system which can make an accurate position detection taking such timings into account.<br>
[0005]<br><br>
In view of the above demands it is an object of the<br>
A3<br><br>
present invention to provide a vehicle with a position detector capable of transmitting a position detection signal accurately while keeping power consumption low.<br>
[0006]<br>
[Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
For achieving the above-mentioned object, in a vehicle with a position detector, having a communication means which issues information to be used for deciding the position of the vehicle, the present invention is firstly characterized in that electric power for the communication means is obtained from a main power supply means installed in the vehicle and that there is provided a control means which maintains the supply of electric power to the communication means for a predetermined time after turning OFF the main power supply means.<br>
[0007]<br>
The present invention is secondly characterized in that the time for maintaining the supply of electric power to the communication means is set longer than an issuing interval of information to be used for deciding the position of the vehicle.<br>
[0008]<br>
The present invention is thirdly characterized in that the communication means includes a receiver means<br><br><br>
which detects a request signal outputted at a predetermined interval from a vehicular position detecting system and a transmitter means which upon receipt of the request signal transmits the information to be used for deciding the position of the vehicle.<br>
[0009]<br>
The present invention is fourthly characterized in that the information to be used for deciding the position of the vehicle permits the position to be displayed on a map by the position detecting system.<br>
[0010]<br>
The present invention is fifthly characterized in that the time for maintaining the supply of electric power to the communication means is set longer than an output interval of the request signal.<br>
[0011]<br>
The present invention is sixthly characterized in that there is provided a housing for receiving therein the communication means removably, the housing being provided with a contact means which fits a terminal provided on the communication means side and which is connected o the main power supply means.<br>
[0012]<br>
The present invention is seventhly characterized in<br><br><br>
that there an generating an a treading fo: of a vehicle ]<br>

[Mode for Carrying Out the Invention]<br>
The present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the drawings.  Fig. 1 illustrates the construction of a vehicle control system which includes a vehicle with a position detector according to an embodiment of the present invention.  In the same figure, plural base stations 5 8 are connected to a public circuit network NT.  In accordance with instructions provided from a position detection service center 59 as a master station each base station 5 8 transmits a position information issuance request signal (request) RQ at a predetermined interval T.  Upon detection of the request RQ a vehicle V issues an answer signal AQ which includes information {e.g., ID) to be used for deciding the position of the vehicle.  The base station 58 which has received the answer signal AQ transfers identification information, which is allocated beforehand to the answer signal AQ-issued vehicle, to the position detection service center 59 through the public circuit network NT. On the basis of the identification information of the<br><br><br>
vehicle V thus transferred and position information of the base station 58 the position detection service center 59 regards the position of the base station 58 as the position of the vehicle V and registers it. [0016]<br>
For improving the position detection accuracy for the vehicle V there can be utilized answer signals AQ to requests RQ issued from plural base stations 58.  For example, using answer signals AQ provided back from the vehicle V in reply to requests RQ issued from three base stations 58 whose positions are known, an exact vehicle position can be detected in accordance with the principle of triangulation. [0017]<br><br>
A vehicle control center 60 i&amp;   connected to another public circuit network NT1, which may be the same as the public circuit network NT.  The vehicle control center 60 transmits, together with identification information of the vehicle V, a retrieval request PRQ inquiring of the position detection service center 59 about the position of the vehicle V through the public circuit network NT1. On the basis of the retrieval request PRQ and the identification information the position detection service center 59 transmits the position of the vehicle V to the<br>
jrio<br><br>
vehicle control center 60 through the public circuit network NT1.<br>
[0018]<br>
On the basis of the position information obtained from the position detection service center 59 the vehicle control center 60 can recognize the position of the vehicle V.  In this case, the position of the vehicle V may be displayed on a map so that it can be easily recognized visually.  Map information for the display may be provided beforehand in the vehicle control center 6 0 or may be acquired together with position information from the position detection service center 59.<br>
[0019]<br>
The vehicle control center 60 has a transmitting and receiving function and an image processing function for the transmission of the position information retrieving request PQ, reception of position information, and processing necessary for the display of position information received.  These processings can be implemented by using a microcomputer, an image display unit such as CRT or LCD, and a memory for the storage of map information.<br>
[0020]<br>
The vehicle V is provided with a position detector<br><br><br>
having a receiving function for receiving requests RQ from the base stations 58 and a transmitting function for transmitting answer signals AQ together with identification information of the vehicle in response to the requests RQ.<br>
[0021]<br>

[0030]<br>
-WAT<br><br>
Fig. 3 is a perspective view of the goods basket 37 as seen from above.  In the same figure, a position detector 38 is installed at a right corner position of an inside bottom of the basket 37.  Thus, since the installed position of the position detector 38 is relatively high, there can be attained a satisfactory<br>
transmission/reception performance and the position detector 38 is difficult to undergo vibration and shock from the road surface, so that a high durability is ensured and maintenance and inspection are easy.  The position detector 38 is bound to the basket 37 with use of a band 4 3, provided any other suitable fixing means, e.g. screws, than such a band may be adopted. [0031]<br>
Fig. 4 is a partially exploded, enlarged view of a principal portion of Fig. 3, with a lid to be described later of the position detector 38 being removed.  A body 381 of the position detector 38 is bound together with a back lid and a control substrate to be described later with use of an elastic band 386 such as a cloth or rubber band and is fixed within a box 385. [0032]<br>
Fig. 5 is an exploded perspective view of the position detector 38.  In the same figure, the position<br><br><br>
detector 3 8 includes a receiving function for receiving a request RQ from each base station 58 and a transmitting function for transmitting an answer signal AQ together with identification information of the vehicle in reply to the request RQ.  The position detector 3 8 comprises a body 381, a body back lid 382, and a control board 383 with a power control circuit {see Fig. 6) mounted on the back side thereof, all of which are accommodated within the box 385 equipped with a lid 384.  A power code 44 extended from the battery 4 is drawn into the box 3 85 and is connected to the control board 383.  On the other hand, a code 4 5 drawn out from a DC-DC converter on the control board 3 83 which converter will be described later is connected to the body back lid 382 with screws 46a and 4 6b.  The screws 46a and 46b are inserted through the body back lid 382 from the back side to the body 381 side.  In this case, positioning is made so that the tips of the screws 46a and 46b come into abutment against power input pins 47a and 47b on the body 3 81 when the body 3 81 and the body back lid 382 are assembled together.  The screws 4 6a and 46b constitute contact means for the supply of electric power to the position detector 38. [0033]<br>
The control board 383 is fixed with four screws 49a<br><br><br>
to 49d which are threadedly engaged with bosses 48a to 48d formed on the bottom of the box 385.  The case lid 384 is fixed to the box 385 with four screws 51a to 51d which are threadedly engaged with bosses 50a to 50d formed at four corners of the box 385.  Pawls 382a are formed on the lid 382.  When the lid 382 is combined with the body 381, the pawls 382a come into engagement with holes 381a formed in the body 381.  The pawls 382a and the holes 381a are formed at plural positions.  It is preferable that the power code 44 and the code 45 be each connected to the control board 383 using a connector of a detachable type.<br>
[0034]<br>
A description will now be given of a power supply circuit mounted on the control board 383.  In a circuit diagram of Fig. 6, a main switch 29 is used also as the switch of the assist motor unit 1.  A DC-DC converter 52 converts the voltage (24 volts) of the battery 4, which is inputted through the main switch 29 and the diode 53, to a value (4 volts) matching the supply voltage of the position detector 38 and outputs the thus-regulated voltage.  The voltage thus regulated to 4 volts is applied as a supply voltage to the position detector 3 8 through the screws 46a and 46b which are connected to the code 45.<br><br>
[0035]<br>
J&amp;8<br><br>
A capacitor 54 is charged while the main switch 29 is ON.  Upon turning OFF of the main switch 29, the charge voltage of the capacitor 54 is applied to a timer 55, which turns ON for a preset time to be described later. While the timer 55 is ON, a transistor 56 turns ON and a relay 5 7 is energized.  As a result, a contact 57a of the relay 57 closes to maintain the input voltage to the DC-DC converter 52.  Upon turning OFF of the timer 55, the transistor is deenergized and the contact 57a opens to cut off the input to the DC-DC converter 52.  Thus, even after turning OFF of the main switch 29, the supply of electric power to the position detector 3 8 is maintained. [0036]<br>
For example, it is preferable that the time set for the timer 55 be decided in the following manner.  For a request interval T from the base stations 58, the time set for the timer 55 is assumed to be Tl (T<t1 by so making decision a reply can be made surely once to request issued from base station while the supply of electric power is continued timer as result when main switch turned off it possible communicate position at which operation motor-assisted bicycle stopped or least in vicinity thereof. for example if></t1><br><br>
interval T is 15 minutes, the value Tl set for the timer 55 is set to 20 minutes. [0037]<br>
In the above embodiment the vehicle control center 6 0 searches for the position of the vehicle V through the position detection service center 59.  That is, a control system is constituted by the base stations 58, the position detection service center 59, and the vehicle control center 60.  However, a control system may be constituted in such a manner that the vehicle control center 60 is allowed to possess the function of the position detection service center 59, a base station 58 is instructed to output a request RQ directly from the control center 60, and the control center 60 receives an answer signal AQ directly from the base station 58. Although in Fig. 1, the public circuit network NT to which the base stations 58 are connected and the public circuit network NT1 to which the vehicle control center 60 is connected are separate networks, the base stations 58, the vehicle control center 60, and the position detection service center 5 9 may be connected to a single public circuit network.  The present invention is widely applicable not only to motor-assisted vehicles but also to vehicles with a power supply such as a battery mounted<br><br><br>
thereon, e.g., electric vehicles.<br>
[0038]<br>
[Effect of the Invention]<br>
As will be apparent from the above description, according to the invention defined in claims 1 to 8, information to be used for deciding the position of the vehicle can be issued for a certain period of time even after turning OFF the main power supply means, so at a vehicular stop position it is possible to issue the said information let the control system recognize the position of the vehicle.  In the control system, therefore, the position of the vehicle can be recognized accurately even after the main power supply means is turned OFF, whereby the maintenance of the vehicle and accounting can be effected efficiently.<br>
