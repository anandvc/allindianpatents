BURST SUPPRESSION<br>
RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]    This application claims benefit of U.S. Provisional Pat. Appl. No. 60/667,901, entitled "CODING THE HIGH-FREQUENCY BAND OF WIDEBAND SPEECH," filed April 1,2005. This application also claims benefit of U.S. Provisional Pat. Appl. No. 60/673,965, entitled "PARAMETER CODING IN A HIGH-BAND SPEECH CODER," filed April 22, 2005.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]    This invention relates to signal processing.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003]    Voice communications over the public switched telephone network (PSTN) have traditionally been limited in bandwidth to the frequency range of 300-3400 kHz. New networks for voice communications, such as cellular telephony and voice over IP (VoIP), may not have the same bandwidth limits, and it may be desirable to transmit and receive voice communications that include a wideband frequency range over such networks. For example, it may be desirable to support an audio frequency range that extends down to 50 Hz and/or up to 7 or 8 kHz. It may also be desirable to support other applications, such as high-quality audio or audio/video conferencing, that may have audio speech content in ranges outside the traditional PSTN limits.<br>
[0004]    Extension of the range supported by a speech coder into higher frequencies may improve intelligibility. For example, the information that differentiates fricatives such as 's' and T is largely in the high frequencies. Highband extension may also improve other qualities of speech, such as presence. For example, even a voiced vowel may have spectral energy far above the PSTN limit.<br>
[0005]    In conducting research on wideband speech signals, the inventors have occasionally observed pulses of high energy, or "bursts", in the upper part of the<br><br>
WO 2006/107834	3	PCT/US2006/012228<br>
spectrum. These highband bursts typically last only a few milliseconds (typically 2 milliseconds, with a maximum length of about 3 milliseconds, may span up to several kilohertz (kHz) in frequency, and occur apparently randomly during different types of speech sounds, both voiced and unvoiced. For some speakers, a highband burst may occur in every sentence, while for other speakers such bursts may not occur at all. While these events do not generally occur frequently, they do seem to be ubiquitous, as the inventors have found examples of them in wideband speech samples from several different databases and from several other sources.<br>
[0006]    Highband bursts have a wide frequency range but typically only occur in the higher band of the spectrum, such as the region from 3.5 to 7 kHz, and not in the lower band. For example, FIGURE 1 shows a spectrogram of the word 'can'. In this wideband speech signal, a highband burst may be seen at 0.1 seconds extending across a wide frequency region around 6 kHz (in this figure, darker regions indicate higher intensity). It is possible that at least some highband bursts are generated by an interaction between the speaker's mouth and the microphone and/or are due to clicks emitted by the speaker's mouth during speech.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0007]    A method of signal processing according to one embodiment includes processing a wideband speech signal to obtain a lowband speech signal and a highband speech signal; determining that a burst is present in a region of the highband speech signal; and determining that the burst is absent from a corresponding region of the lowband speech signal. The method also includes, based on determining that the burst is present and on determining that the burst is absent, attenuating the highband speech signal over the region.<br>
[0008]    An apparatus according to an embodiment includes a first burst detector configured to detect bursts in the lowband speech signal; a second burst detector configured to detect bursts in a corresponding highband speech signal; an attenuation control signal calculator configured to calculate an attenuation control signal according to a difference between outputs of the first and second burst detectors; and a gain<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[00033] Unless expressly limited by its context, the term "calculating" is used herein to indicate any of its ordinary meanings, such as computing, generating, and selecting from a list of values. Where the term "comprising" is used in the present description and claims, it does not exclude other elements or operations.<br>
[00034] Highband bursts are quite audible in the original speech signal, but they do not contribute to intelligibility, and the quality of the signal may be improved by suppressing them. Highband bursts may also be detrimental to encoding of the highband speech signal, such that efficiency of coding the signal, and especially of encoding the temporal envelope, may be improved by suppressing the bursts from the highband speech signal.<br>
[00035] Highband bursts may negatively affect high-band coding systems in several ways. First, these bursts may cause the energy envelope of the speech signal over time to be much less smooth 'by introducing a sharp peak at the time of the burst. Unless the coder models the temporal envelope of the signal with high resolution, which increases the amount of information to be sent to the decoder, the energy of the burst may become smeared out over time in the decoded signal and cause artifacts. Second, highband bursts tend to dominate the spectral envelope as modeled by, for example, a set of parameters such as linear prediction filter coefficients. Such modeling is typically performed for each frame of the speech signal (about 20 milliseconds). Consequently, the frame containing the click may be synthesized according to a spectral envelope that is different from the preceding and following frames, which can lead to a perceptually objectionable discontinuity.<br>
[00036] Highband bursts may cause another problem for a speech coding system in which an excitation signal for the highband synthesis filter is derived from or otherwise represents a narrowband residual. In such case, presence of a highband burst may complicate coding of the highband speech signal because the highband speech signal includes a structure that is absent from the narrowband speech signal.<br><br>
WO 2006/107834	7	PCT/US2006/012228<br>
[00037] Embodiments include systems, methods, and apparatus configured to detect bursts that exist in a highband speech signal, but not in a corresponding lowband speech signal, and to reduce a level of the highband speech signal during each of the bursts. Potential advantages of such embodiments include avoiding artifacts in the decoded signal and/or avoiding a loss of coding efficiency without noticeably degrading the quality of the original signal. FIGURE 2 shows a spectrogram of the wideband signal shown in FIGURE 1 after suppression of the highband burst according to such a method.<br>
[00038] FIGURE 3 shows a block diagram of an arrangement including a filter bank Al 10 and a highband burst suppressor C200 according to an embodiment. Filter bank A110 is configured to filter wideband speech signal S10 to produce a lowband speech signal S20 and a highband speech signal S30. Highband burst suppressor C200 is . configured to output a processed highband speech signal S30a based on highband speech signal S30, in which bursts that occur in highband speech signal S30 but are absent from lowband speech signal S20 have been suppressed.<br>
[00039] FIGURE 4 shows a block diagram of the arrangement shown in FIGURE 3 that also includes a filter bank B120. Filter bank B120 is configured to combine lowband speech signal S20 and processed highband speech signal S30a to produce a processed wideband speech signal S10a. The quality of processed wideband speech signal S10a may be improved over that of wideband speech signal S10 due to suppression of highband bursts.<br>
[00040] Filter bank A1.10 is configured to filter an input signal according to a split-band scheme to produce a low-frequency subband and a high-frequency subband. Depending on the design criteria for the particular application, the output subbands may have equal or unequal bandwidths and may be overlapping or nonoverlapping. A configuration of filter bank Al 10 that produces more than two subbands is also possible. For example, such a filter bank may be configured to produce a very-low-band signal that includes components in a frequency range below that of narrowband signal S20 (such as the range of 50-300 Hz). In such case, wideband speech encoder A100 may be implemented to encode this very-low-band signal separately, and multiplexer A130 may be configured to include the encoded very-low-band signal in multiplexed signal S70 (e.g., as a separable portion).<br><br>
WO 2006/107834	8	PCT/US2006/012228<br>
[00041] FIGURE 5a shows a block diagram of an implementation Al 12 of filter band A110 that is configured to produce two subband signals having reduced sampling rates. Filter bank A110 is arranged to receive a wideband speech signal S10 having a high-frequency (or highband) portion and a low-frequency (or lowband) portion. Filter bank A112 includes a lowband processing path configured to receive wideband speech signal S10 and to produce narrowband speech signal S20, and a highband processing path configured to receive wideband speech signal S10 and to produce highband speech signal S30. Lowpass filter 110 filters wideband speech signal S10 to pass a selected low-frequency subband, and highpass filter 130 filters wideband speech signal S10 to pass a selected high-frequency subband. Because both subband signals have more narrow bandwidths than wideband speech signal S10, their sampling rates can be reduced to some extent without loss of information. Downsampler 120 reduces the sampling rate of the lowpass signal according to a desired decimation factor (e.g., by removing samples of the signal and/or replacing samples with average values), and downsampler 140 likewise reduces the sampling rate of the highpass signal according to another desired decimation factor.<br>
[00042] FIGURE 5b shows a block diagram of a corresponding implementation B122 of filter bank B120. Upsampler 150 increases the sampling rate of narrowband signal S90 (e.g., by zero-stuffing and/or by duplicating samples), and lowpass filter 160 filters the upsampled signal to pass only a lowband portion (e.g., to prevent aliasing). Likewise, upsampler 170 increases the sampling rate of highband signal S100 and highpass filter 180 filters the upsampled signal to pass only a highband portion. The two passband signals are then summed to form wideband speech signal S110. In some implementations of decoder B100, filter bank B120 is configured to produce a weighted sum of the two passband signals according to one or more weights received and/or calculated by highband decoder B200. A configuration of filter bank B120 that combines more than two passband signals is also contemplated.<br>
[00043] Each of the filters 110,130,160,180 may be implemented as a finite-impulse-response (FIR) filter or as an infinite-impulse-response (BR) filter. The frequency responses of filters 110 and 130 may have symmetric or dissimilarly shaped transition regions between stopband and passband. Likewise, the frequency responses of filters 160 and 180 may have symmetric or dissimilarly shaped transition regions between<br><br>
WO 2006/107834	9	PCT/US2006/012228<br>
stopband and passband. It may be desirable but is not strictly necessary for lowpass filter 110 to have the same response as lowpass filter 160, and for highpass filter 130 to have the same response as highpass filter 180. In one example, the two filter pairs 110, 130 and 160,180 are quadrature mirror filter (QMF) banks, with filter pair 110, 130 having the same coefficients as filter pair 160,180.<br>
r<br>
[00044] In a typical example, lowpass filter 110 has a passband that includes the limited PSTN range of 300-3400 Hz (e.g., the band from 0 to 4 kHz). FIGURES 6a and 6b show relative bandwidths of wideband speech signal S10, lowband speech signal S20, and highband speech signal S30 in two different implementational examples. In both of these particular examples, wideband speech signal S10 has a sampling rate of 16 kHz (representing frequency components within the range of 0 to 8 kHz), and lowband signal S20 has a sampling rate of 8 kHz (representing frequency components within the range of 0 to 4 kHz).<br>
[00045] In the example of FIGURE 6a, there is no significant overlap between the two subbands. A highband signal S30 as shown in this example may be obtained using a highpass filter 130 with a passband of 4-8 kHz. In such a case, it may be desirable to reduce the sampling rate to 8 kHz by downsampling the filtered signal by a factor of two. Such an operation, which may be expected to significantly reduce the computational complexity of further processing operations on the signal, will move the passband energy down to the range of 0 to 4 kHz without loss of information.<br>
[00046] In the alternative example of FIGURE 6b, the upper and lower subbands have an appreciable overlap, such that the region of 3.5 to 4 kHz is described by both subband signals. A highband signal S30 as in this example may be obtained using a highpass filter 130 with a passband of 3.5-7 kHz. In such a case, it may be desirable to reduce the sampling rate to 7 kHz by downsampling the filtered signal by a factor of 16/7. Such an operation, which may be expected to significantly reduce the computational complexity of further processing operations on the signal, will move the passband energy down to the range of 0 to 3.5 kHz without loss of information.<br>
[00047] In a typical handset for telephonic communication, one or more of the transducers (i.e., the microphone and the earpiece or loudspeaker) lacks an appreciable response over the frequency range of 7-8 kHz. In the example of FIGURE 6b, the<br><br>
WO 2006/107834	10	PCT/US2006/012228<br>
portion of wideband speech signal S10 between 7 and 8 kHz is not included in the encoded signal. Other particular examples of highpass filter 130 have passbands of 3.5-7.5 kHz and 3.5-8 kHz.<br>
[00048] In some implementations, providing an overlap between subbands as in the example of FIGURE 6b allows for the use of a lowpass and/or a highpass filter having a smooth rolloff over the overlapped region. Such filters are typically less computationally complex and/or introduce less delay than filters with sharper or "brick-wall" responses. Filters having sharp transition regions tend to have higher sidelobes (which may cause aliasing) than filters of similar order that have smooth rolloffs. Filters having sharp transition regions may also have long impulse responses which may cause ringing artifacts. For filter bank implementations having one or more IIR filters, allowing for a smooth rolloff over the overlapped region may enable the use of a filter or filters whose poles are farther away from the unit circle, which may be important to ensure a stable fixed-point implementation.<br>
[00049] Overlapping of subbands allows a smooth blending of lowband and highband that may lead to fewer audible artifacts, reduced aliasing, and/or a less noticeable transition from one band to the other. Moreover, in an application where the lowband and highband speech signals S20, S30 are subsequently encoded by different speech encoders, the coding efficiency of the lowband speech encoder (for example, a waveform coder) may drop with increasing frequency. For example, coding quality of the lowband speech coder may be reduced at low bit rates, especially in the presence of background noise. In such cases, providing an overlap of the subbands may increase the quality of reproduced frequency components in the overlapped region.<br>
[00050] Moreover, overlapping of subbands allows a smooth blending of lowband and highband that may lead to fewer audible artifacts, reduced aliasing, and/or a less noticeable transition from one band to the other. Such a feature may be especially desirable for an implementation in which lowband encoder A120 and highband encoder A200 as discussed below operate according to different coding methodologies. For example, different coding techniques may produce signals that sound quite different. A coder that encodes a spectral envelope in the form of codebook indices may produce a signal having a different sound than a coder that encodes the amplitude spectrum instead. A time-domain coder (e.g., a pulse-code-modulation or PCM coder) may<br><br>
WO 2006/107834		11	PCT/US2006/012228<br>
produce a signal having a different sound than a frequency-domain coder. A coder that encodes a signal with a representation of the spectral envelope and the corresponding residual signal may produce a signal having a different sound than a coder that encodes a signal with only a representation of the spectral envelope. A coder that encodes a signal as a representation of its waveform may produce an output having a different sound than that from a sinusoidal coder. In such cases, using filters having sharp transition regions to define nonoverlapping subbands may lead to an abrupt and perceptually noticeable transition between the subbands in the synthesized wideband signal.<br>
[00051] Although QMF filter banks having complementary overlapping frequency responses are often used in subband techniques, such filters are unsuitable for at least some of the wideband coding implementations described herein. A QMF filter bank at the encoder is configured to create a significant degree of aliasing that is canceled in the corresponding QMF filter bank at the decoder. Such an arrangement may not be appropriate for an application in which the signal incurs a significant amount of distortion between the filter banks, as the distortion may reduce the effectiveness of the alias cancellation property. For example, applications described herein include coding implementations configured to operate at very low bit rates. As a consequence of the very low bit rate, the decoded signal is likely to appear significantly distorted as compared to the original signal, such that use of QMF filter banks may lead to uncanceled aliasing. Applications that use QMF filter banks typically have higher bit rates (e.g., over 12 kbps for AMR, and 64 kbps for G.722).<br>
[00052] Additionally, a coder may be configured to produce a synthesized signal that is perceptually similar to the original signal but which actually differs significantly from the original signal. For example, a coder that derives the highband excitation from the narrowband residual as described herein may produce such a signal, as the actual highband residual may be completely absent from the decoded signal. Use of QMF filter banks in such applications may lead to a significant degree of distortion caused by uncanceled aliasing.<br>
[00053]' The amount of distortion caused by QMF aliasing may be reduced if the affected subband is narrow, as the effect of the aliasing is limited to a bandwidth equal to the width of the subband. For examples as described herein in which each subband<br><br>
WO 2006/107834	12	PCT/US2006/012228<br>
includes about half of the wideband bandwidth, however, distortion caused by uncanceled aliasing could affect a significant part of the signal. The quality of the signal may also be affected by the location of the frequency band over which the uncanceled aliasing occurs. For example, distortion created near the center of a wideband speech signal (e.g., between 3 and 4 kHz) may be much more objectionable than distortion that occurs near an edge of the signal (e.g., above 6 kHz).<br>
[00054] While the responses of the filters of a QMF filter bank are strictly related to one another, the lowband and highband paths of filter banks A110 and B120 may be configured to have spectra that are completely unrelated apart from the overlapping of the two subbands. We define the overlap of the two subbands as the distance from the point at which the frequency response of the highband filter drops to -20 dB up to the point at which the frequency response of the lowband filter drops to -20 dB. In various examples of filter bank Al 10 and/or B120, this overlap ranges from around 200 Hz to around 1 kHz. The range of about 400 to about 600 Hz may represent a desirable tradeoff between coding efficiency and perceptual smoothness. In one particular example as mentioned above, the overlap is around 500 Hz.<br>
[00055] It may be desirable to implement filter bank Al 12 and/or B122 to perform operations as illustrated in FIGURES 6a and 6b in several stages. For example, FIGURE 6c shows a block diagram of an implementation Al 14 of filter bank Al 12 that performs a functional equivalent of highpass filtering and downsampling operations using a series of interpolation, resampling, decimation, and other operations. Such an implementation may be easier to design and/or may allow reuse of functional blocks of logic and/or code. For example, the same functional block may be used to perform the operations of decimation to 14 kHz and decimation to 7 kHz as shown in FIGURE 6c. The spectral reversal operation may be implemented by multiplying the signal with the function ein or the sequence (-1)", whose values alternate between +1 and-1. The spectral shaping operation may be implemented as a lowpass filter configured to shape the signal to obtain a desired overall filter response.<br>
[00056] It is noted that as a consequence of the spectral reversal operation, the spectrum of highband signal S30 is reversed. Subsequent operations in the encoder and corresponding decoder may be configured accordingly. For example, it may be desired to produce a corresponding excitation signal that also has a spectrally reversed form.<br><br>
WO 2006/107834	13	PCT/US2006/012228<br>
[00057] FIGURE 6d shows a block diagram of an implementation B124 of filter bank B122 that performs a functional equivalent of upsampling and highpass filtering operations using a series of interpolation, resampling, and other operations. Filter bank B124 includes a spectral reversal operation in the highband that reverses a similar operation as performed, for example, in a filter bank of the encoder such as filter bank A114. In this particular example, filter bank B124 also includes notch filters in the lowband and highband that attenuate a component of the signal at 7100 Hz, although such filters are optional and need not be included. The Patent Application "SYSTEMS, METHODS, AND APPARATUS FOR SPEECH SIGNAL FILTERING" filed herewith, Attorney Docket 050551, includes additional description and figures relating to responses of elements of particular implementations of filter banks Al 10 and B120, and this material is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
[00058] As noted above, highband burst suppression may improve the efficiency of coding highband speech signal S30. FIGURE 7 shows a block diagram of an arrangement in which processed highband speech signal S30a, as produced by highband burst suppressor C200, is encoded by a highband speech encoder A200 to produce encoded highband speech signal S30b.<br>
[00059] One approach to wideband speech coding involves scaling a narrowband speech coding technique (e.g., one configured to encode the range of 0-4 kHz) to cover the wideband spectrum. For example, a speech signal may be sampled at a higher rate to include components at high frequencies, and a narrowband coding technique may be reconfigured to use more filter coefficients to represent this wideband signal. FIGURE 8 shows a block diagram of an example in which a wideband speech encoder A100 is arranged to encode processed wideband speech signal S10a to produce encoded wideband speech signal Sl0b.<br>
[00060] Narrowband coding techniques such as CELP (codebook excited linear prediction) are computationally intensive, however, and a wideband CELP coder may consume too many processing cycles to be practical for many mobile and other embedded applications. Encoding the entire spectrum of a wideband signal to a desired quality using such a technique may also lead to an unacceptably large increase in bandwidth. Moreover, transcoding of such an encoded signal would be required before even its narrowband portion could be transmitted into and/or decoded by a system that<br><br>
WO 2006/107834	14	PCT/US2006/012228<br><br>
only supports narrowband coding. FIGURE 9 shows a block diagram of a wideband speech encoder A102 that includes separate lowband and highband speech encoders A120 and A200, respectively.<br>
[00061] It may be desirable to implement wideband speech coding such that at least the narrowband portion of the encoded signal may be sent through a narrowband channel (such as a PSTN channel) without transcoding or other significant modification. Efficiency of the wideband coding extension may also be desirable, for example, to avoid a significant reduction in the number of users that may be serviced in applications such as wireless cellular telephony and broadcasting over wired and wireless channels.<br>
[00062] One approach to wideband speech coding involves extrapolating the highband spectral envelope from the encoded narrowband spectral envelope. While such an approach may be implemented without any increase in bandwidth and without a need for transcoding, however, the coarse spectral envelope or formant structure of the highband portion of a speech signal generally cannot be predicted accurately from the spectral envelope of the narrowband portion.<br>
[00063] FIGURE 10 shows a block diagram of a wideband speech encoder A104 that uses another approach to encoding the highband speech signal according to information from the lowband speech signal. In this example, the highband excitation signal is derived from the encoded lowband excitation signal S50. Encoder A104 may be configured to encode a gain envelope based on a signal based on the highband excitation signal, for example, according to one or more such embodiments as described in the Patent Application "SYSTEMS, METHODS, AND APPARATUS FOR GAIN CODING" filed herewith, Attorney Docket No. 050547, which description is hereby incorporated by reference. One particular example of wideband speech encoder A104 is configured to encode wideband speech signal S10 at a rate of about 8.55 kbps (kilobits per second), with about 7.55 kbps being used for lowband filter parameters S40 and encoded lowband excitation signal S50, and about 1 kbps being used for encoded highband speech S60.<br>
[00064] It may be desired to combine the encoded lowband and highband signals into a single bitstream. For example, it may be desired to multiplex the encoded signals together for transmission (e.g., over a wired, optical, or wireless transmission channel),<br><br>
WO 2006/107834	15	PCT/US2006/012228<br>
or for storage, as an encoded wideband speech signal. FIGURE 11 shows a block diagram of an arrangement including wideband speech encoder A104 and a multiplexer A130 configured to combine lowband filter parameters S40, encoded lowband excitation signal S50, and highband filter parameters S60 into a multiplexed signal S70.<br>
[00065] It may be desirable for multiplexer A130 to be configured to embed the encoded lowband signal (including lowband filter parameters S40 and encoded lowband excitation signal S50) as a separable substream of multiplexed signal S70, such that the encoded lowband signal may be recovered and decoded independently of another portion of multiplexed signal S70 such as a highband and/or very-low-band signal. For example, multiplexed signal S70 may be arranged such that the encoded lowband signal may be recovered by stripping away the highband filter parameters S60. One potential advantage of such a feature is to avoid the need for transcoding the encoded wideband signal before passing it to a system that supports decoding of the lowband signal but does not support decoding of the highband portion.<br>
[00066] An apparatus including a lowband, highband, and/or wideband speech encoder as described herein may also include circuitry configured to transmit the encoded signal into a transmission channel such as a wired, optical, or wireless channel. Such an apparatus may also be configured to perform one or more channel encoding operations on the signal, such as error correction encoding (e.g., rate-compatible convolutional encoding) and/or error detection encoding (e.g., cyclic redundancy encoding), and/or one or more layers of network protocol encoding (e.g., Ethernet, TCP/IP, cdma2000).<br>
[00067] Any or all of the lowband, highband, and wideband speech encoders described herein may be implemented according to a source-filter model that encodes the input speech signal as (A) a set of parameters that describe a filter and (B) an excitation signal that drives the described filter to produce a synthesized reproduction of the input speech signal. For example, a spectral envelope of a speech signal is characterized by a number of peaks that represent resonances of the vocal tract and are called formants. Most speech Coders encode at least this coarse spectral structure as a set of parameters such as filter coefficients.<br>
[00068] In one example of a basic source-filter arrangement, an analysis module calculates a set of parameters that characterize a filter corresponding to the speech<br><br>
WO 2006/107834	16	PCT/US2006/012228<br>
sound over a period of time (typically 20 msec). A whitening filter (also called an analysis or prediction error filter) configured according to those filter parameters removes the spectral envelope to spectrally flatten the signal. The resulting whitened signal (also called a residual) has less energy and thus less variance and is easier to encode than the original speech signal. Errors resulting from coding of the residual signal may also be spread more evenly over the spectrum. The filter parameters and residual are typically quantized for efficient transmission over the channel. At the decoder, a synthesis filter configured according to the filter parameters is excited by the residual to produce a synthesized version of the original speech sound. The synthesis filter is typically configured to have a transfer function that is the inverse of the transfer function of the whitening filter.<br>
[00069] The analysis module may be implemented as a linear prediction coding (LPC) analysis module that encodes the spectral envelope of the speech signal as a set of linear prediction (LP) coefficients (e.g., coefficients of an all-pole filter 1/A(z)). The analysis module typically processes the input signal as a series of nonoverlapping frames, with a new set of coefficients being calculated for each frame. The frame period is generally a period over which the signal may be expected to be locally stationary; one common example is 20 milliseconds (equivalent to 160 samples at a sampling rate of 8 kHz). One example of a lowband LPC analysis module is configured to calculate a set of ten LP filter coefficients to characterize the formant structure of each 20 millisecond frame of lowband speech signal S20, and one example of a highband LPC analysis module is configured to calculate a set of six (alternatively, eight) LP filter coefficients to characterize the formant structure of each 20-millisecond frame of highband speech signal S30. It is also possible to implement the analysis module to process the input signal as a series of overlapping frames.<br>
[00070] The analysis module may be configured to analyze the samples of each frame directly, or the samples may be weighted first according to a windowing function (for example, a Hamming window). The analysis may also be performed over a window that is larger than the frame, such as a 30-msec window. This window may be symmetric (e.g. 5-20-5, such that it includes the 5 milliseconds immediately before and after the 20-millisecond frame) or asymmetric (e.g. 10-20, such that it includes the last 10 milliseconds of the preceding frame). An LPC analysis module is typically<br><br>
WO 2006/107834	17	PCT/US2006/012228<br>
configured to calculate the LP filter coefficients using a Levinson-Durbin recursion or the Leroux-Gueguen algorithm. In another implementation, the analysis module may be configured to calculate a set of cepstral coefficients for each frame instead of a set of LP filter coefficients.<br>
[00071] The output rate of a speech encoder may be reduced' significantly, with relatively little effect on reproduction quality, by quantizing the filter parameters. Linear prediction filter coefficients are difficult to quantize efficiently and are usually mapped by the speech encoder into another representation, such as line spectral pairs (LSPs) or line spectral frequencies (LSFs), for quantization and/or entropy encoding. Other one-to-one representations of LP filter coefficients include parcor coefficients; log-area-ratio values; immittance spectral pairs (ISPs); and immittance spectral frequencies (ISFs), which are used in the GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) AMR-WB (Adaptive Multirate-Wideband) codec. Typically a transform between a set of LP filter coefficients and a corresponding set of LSFs is reversible, but embodiments also include implementations of a speech encoder in which the transform is not reversible without error.<br>
[00072] A speech encoder is typically configured to quantize the set of narrowband LSFs (or other coefficient representation) and to output the result of this quantization as the filter parameters. Quantization is typically performed using a vector quantizer that encodes the input vector as an index to a corresponding vector entry in a table or codebook. Such a quantizer may also be configured to perform classified vector quantization. For example, such a quantizer may be configured to select one of a set of codebooks based on information that has already been coded within the same frame (e.g., in the lowband channel and/or in the highband channel). Such a technique typically provides increased coding efficiency at the expense of additional codebook storage.<br>
[00073] A speech encoder may also be configured to generate a residual signal by passing the speech signal through a whitening filter (also called an analysis or prediction error filter) that is configured according to the set of filter coefficients. The whitening filter is typically implemented as a FIR filter, although EDR. implementations may also be used. This residual signal will typically contain perceptually important information of the speech frame, such as long-term structure relating to pitch, that is not represented in<br><br>
WO 2006/107834	18	PCT/US2006/012228<br>
the filter parameters. Again, this residual signal is typically quantized for output. For example, lowband speech encoder A122 may be configured to calculate a quantized representation of the residual signal for output as encoded lowband excitation signal S50. Such quantization is typically performed using a vector quantizer that encodes the input vector as an index to a corresponding vector entry in a table or codebook and that may be configured to perform classified vector quantization as described above.<br>
[00074] Alternatively, such a quantizer may be configured to send one or more parameters from which the vector may be generated dynamically at the decoder, rather than retrieved from storage, as in a sparse codebook method. Such a method is used in coding schemes such as algebraic CELP (codebook excitation linear prediction) and codecs such as 3GPP2 (Third Generation Partnership 2) EVRC (Enhanced Variable Rate Codec).<br>
[00075] Some implementations of narrowband encoder A120 are configured to calculate encoded narrowband excitation signal S50 by identifying one among a set of codebook vectors that best matches the residual signal. It is noted, however, that narrowband encoder A120 may also be implemented to calculate a quantized representation of the residual signal without actually generating the residual signal. For example, narrowband encoder A120 may be configured to use a number of codebook vectors to generate corresponding synthesized signals (e.g., according to a current set of filter parameters), and to select the codebook vector associated with the generated signal that best matches the original narrowband signal S20 in a perceptually weighted domain.<br>
[00076] -It may be desirable to implement lowband speech encoder A120 or A122 as an analysis-by-synthesis speech encoder. Codebook excitation linear prediction (CELP) coding is one popular family of analysis-by-synthesis coding, and implementations of such coders may perform waveform encoding of the residual, including such operations as selection of entries from fixed and adaptive codebooks, error minimization operations, and/or perceptual weighting operations. Other implementations of analysis-by-synthesis coding include mixed excitation linear prediction (MELP), algebraic CELP (ACELP), relaxation CELP (RCELP), regular pulse excitation (RPE), multi-pulse CELP (MPE), and vector-sum excited linear prediction (VSELP) coding. Related coding methods include multi-band excitation (MBE) and prototype waveform interpolation<br><br><br><br>
WO 2006/107834                                         19                               PCT/US2006/012228<br><br>
(PWI) coding. Examples of standardized analysis-by-synthesis speech codecs include the ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards Institute)-GSM full rate codec (GSM 06.10), which uses residual excited linear prediction (RELP); the GSM enhanced full rate codec (ETSI-GSM 06.60); the ITU (International Telecommunication Union) standard 11.8 kb/s G.729 Annex E coder; the IS (Interim Standard)-641 codecs for IS-136 (a time-division multiple access scheme); the GSM adaptive multirate (GSM-AMR) codecs; and the 4GV™ (Fourth-Generation Vocoder™) codec (QUALCOMM Incorporated, San Diego, CA). Existing implementations of RCELP coders include the Enhanced Variable Rate Codec (EVRC), as described in Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) IS-127, and the Third Generation Partnership Project 2 (3GPP2) Selectable Mode Vocoder (SMV). The various lowband, highband, and wideband encoders described herein may be implemented according to any of these technologies, or any other speech coding technology (whether known or to be developed) that represents a speech signal as (A) a set of parameters that describe a filter and (B) a residual signal that provides at least part of an excitation used to drive the described filter to reproduce the speech signal.<br>
[00077] FIGURE 12 shows a block diagram of an implementation C202 of highband burst suppressor C200 that includes two implementations CI0-1, CI0-2 of burst<br>
r<br>
detector C10. Burst detector C10-1 is configured to produce a lowband burst indication signal SB 10 that indicates a presence of a burst in lowband speech signal S20. Burst detector C10-2 is configured to produce a highband burst indication signal SB20 that indicates a presence of a burst in highband speech signal S30. Burst detectors C10-1 and C10-2 may be identical or may be instances of different implementations of burst detector C10. Highband burst suppressor C202 also includes an attenuation control signal generator C20 configured to generate an attenuation control signal SB70 according to a relation between lowband burst indication signal SB 10 and highband burst indication signal SB20, and a gain control element C150 (e.g., a multiplier or amplifier) configured to apply attenuation control signal SB70 to highband speech signal S30 to produce processed highband speech signal S30a.<br>
[00078] In the particular examples described herein, it may be assumed that highband burst suppressor C202 processes highband speech signal S30 in 20-millisecond frames, and that lowband speech signal S20 and highband speech signal S30 are both sampled at<br><br>
WO 2006/107834	20	PCT/US2006/012228<br>
8 kHz. However, these particular values are examples only, and not limitations, and other values may also be used according to particular design choices and/or as noted herein.<br>
[00079] Burst detector C10 is configured to calculate forward and backward smoothed envelopes of the speech signal and to indicate the presence of a burst according to a time relation between an edge in the forward smoothed envelope and an edge in the backward smoothed envelope. Burst suppressor C202 includes two instances of burst detector C10, each arranged to receive a respective one of speech signals S20, S30 and to output a corresponding burst indication signal SB 10, SB20.<br>
[00080] FIGURE 13 shows a block diagram of an implementation C12 of burst detector CIO that is arranged to receive one of speech signals S20, S30 and to output a corresponding burst indication signal SB 10, SB20. Burst detector C12 is configured to calculate each of the forward and backward smoothed envelopes in two stages. In the first stage, a calculator C30 is configured to convert the speech signal to a constant-polarity signal. In one example, calculator C30 is configured to compute the constant-polarity signal as the square of each sample of the current frame of the corresponding speech signal. Such a signal may be smoothed to obtain an energy envelope. In another example, calculator C30 is configured to compute the absolute value of each incoming sample. Such a signal may be smoothed to obtain an amplitude envelope. Further implementations of calculator C30 may be configured to compute the constant-polarity signal according to another function such as clipping.<br>
[00081] In the second stage, a forward smoother C40-1 is configured to smooth the constant-polarity signal in a forward time direction to produce a forward smoothed envelope, and a backward smoother C40-2 is configured to smooth the constant-polarity signal in a backward time direction to produce a backward smoothed envelope. The forward smoothed envelope indicates a difference in the level of the corresponding speech signal over time in the forward direction, and the backward smoothed envelope indicates a difference in the level of the corresponding speech signal over time in the backward direction.<br><br>
WO 2006/107834	21	PCT/US2006/012228<br>
[00082] In one example, forward smoother C40-1 is implemented as a first-order infinite-impulse-response (IIR) filter configured to smooth the constant-polarity signal according to an expression such as the following:<br>
Sf (n) = aSf (n - 1) + (1 - a)P(n),<br>
and backward smoother C40-2 is implemented as a first-order IIR filter configured to smooth the constant-polarity signal according to an expression such as the following:<br>
Sb(n) = aSb(n + l) + (l-a)P(n),<br>
where n is a time index, P(n) is the constant-polarity signal, Sf (n) is the forward smoothed envelope, Sb (n) is the backward smoothed envelope, and a is a decay factor<br>
having a value between 0 (no smoothing) and 1. It may be noted that due in part to operations such as calculation of a backward smoothed envelope, a delay of at least one frame may be incurred in processed highband speech signal S30a. However, such a delay is relatively unimportant perceptually and is not uncommon even in real-time speech processing operations.<br>
[00083] It may be desirable to select a value for a such that the decay time of the smoother is similar to the expected duration of a highband burst (e.g., about 5 milliseconds). Typically forward smoother C40-1 and backward smoother C40-2 are configured to perform complementary versions of the same smoothing operation, and to use the same value of a, but in some implementations the two smoothers may be configured to perform different operations and/or to use different values. Other recursive or non-recursive smoothing functions, including finite-impulse-response (FIR) or IIR filters of higher order, may also be used.<br>
[00084] In other implementations of burst detector CI2, one or both of forward smoother C40-1 and backward smoother C40-2 are configured to perform an adaptive smoothing operation. For example, forward smoother C40-1 may be configured to perform an adaptive smoothing operation according to an expression such as the following:<br><br>
WO 2006/107834	22	PCT/US2006/012228<br><br><br>
in which smoothing is reduced or, as in this case, disabled at strong leading edges of the constant-polarity signal. In this or another implementation of burst detector C12, backward smoother C40-2 may be configured to perform an adaptive smoothing operation according to an expression such as the following:<br><br>
in which smoothing is reduced or, as in this case, disabled at strong trailing edges of the constant-polarity signal. Such adaptive smoothing may help to define the beginnings of burst events in the forward smoothed envelope and the ends of burst events in the backward smoothed envelope.<br>
[00085] Burst detector C12 includes an instance of a region indicator C50 (initial region indicator C50-1) that is configured to indicate the beginning of a high-level event (e.g., a burst) in the forward smoothed envelope. Burst detector C12 also includes an instance of region indicator C50 (terminal region indicator C50-2) that is configured to indicate the ending of a high-level event (e.g., a burst) in the backward smoothed envelope.<br>
[00086] FIGURE 14a shows a block diagram of an implementation C52-1 of initial region indicator C50-1 that includes a delay element C70-1 and an adder. Delay C70-1 is configured to apply a delay having a positive magnitude, such that the forward smoothed envelope is reduced by a delayed version of itself. In another example, the current sample or the delayed sample may be weighted according to a desired weighting factor.<br>
[00087] FIGURE 14b shows a block diagram of an implementation C52-2 of terminal region indicator C50-2 that includes a delay element C70-2 and an adder. Delay C70-2 is configured to apply a delay having a negative magnitude, such that the backward smoothed envelope is reduced by an advanced version of itself. In another example, the current sample or the advanced sample may be weighted according to a desired weighting factor.<br><br>
WO 2006/107834	23	PCT/US2006/012228<br>
[00088] Various delay values may be used in different implementations of region indicator C52, and delay values having different magnitudes may be used in initial region indicator C52-1 and terminal region indicator C52-2. The magnitude of the delay may be selected according to a desired width of the detected region. For example, small delay values may be used to perform detection of a narrow edge region. To obtain strong edge detection, it may be desired to use a delay having a magnitude similar to the expected edge width (for example, about 3 or 5 samples).<br>
[00089] Alternatively, a region indicator C50 may be configured to indicate a wider region that extends beyond the corresponding edge. For example, it may be desirable for initial region indicator C50-1 to indicate an initial region of an event that extends in the forward direction for some time after the leading edge. Likewise, it may be desirable for terminal region indicator C50-2 to indicate a terminal region of an event that extends in the backward direction for some time before the trailing edge. In such case, it may be desirable to use a delay value having a larger magnitude, such as a magnitude similar to that of the expected length of a burst. In one such example, a delay of about 4 milliseconds is used.<br>
[00090] Processing by a region indicator C50 may extend beyond the boundaries of the current frame of the speech signal, according to the magnitude and direction of the delay. For example, processing by initial region indicator C50-1 may extend into the preceding frame, and processing by terminal region indicator C50-2 may extend into the following frame.<br>
[00091] As compared to other high-level events that may occur in the speech signal, a burst is distinguished by an initial region, as indicated in initial region indication signal SB50, that coincides in time with a terminal region, as indicated in terminal region indication signal SB60. For example, a burst may be indicated when the time distance between the initial and terminal regions is not greater than (alternatively, is less than) a predetermined coincidence interval, such as the expected duration of a burst. Coincidence detector C60 is configured to indicate detection of a burst according to a coincidence in time of initial and terminal regions in the region indication signals SB50 and SB60. For an implementation in which initial and terminal region indication signals SB50, SB60 indicate regions that extend from the respective leading and trailing edges,<br><br>
WO 2006/107834<br><br>
24<br><br>
PCT/US2006/012228<br><br>
for example, coincidence detector C60 may be configured to indicate an overlap in time of the extended regions.<br>
[00092] FIGURE 15 shows a block diagram of an implementation C62 of coincidence detector C60 that includes a first instance C80-1 of clipper C80 configured to clip initial region indication signal SB50, a second instance C80-2 of clipper C80 configured to clip terminal region indication signal SB60, and a mean calculator C90 configured to output a corresponding burst indication signal according to a mean of the clipped signals. Clipper C80 is configured to clip values of the input signal according to an expression such as the following:<br>
out = max(in, 0).<br>
[00093] Alternatively, clipper C80 may also be configured to threshold the input signal according to an expression such as the following:<br><br><br><br><br>
where threshold Ti has a value greater than zero. Typically the instances C80-1 and C80-2 of clipper C80 will use the same threshold value, but it is also possible for the two instances C80-1 and C80-2 to use different threshold values.<br>
[00094] Mean calculator C90 is configured to output a corresponding burst indication signal SB 10, SB20, according to a mean of the clipped signals, that indicates the time location and strength of bursts in the input signal and has a value equal to or larger than zero. The geometric mean may provide better results than the arithmetic mean, especially for distinguishing bursts with defined initial and terminal regions from other events that have only a strong initial or terminal region. For example, the arithmetic mean of an event with only one strong edge may still be high, and whereas the geometric mean of an event lacking one of the edges will be low or zero. However, the geometric mean is typically more computationally intensive than the arithmetic mean. In one example, an instance of mean calculator C90 arranged to process lowband results uses the arithmetic mean (½(a + b)), and an instance of mean calculator C90 arranged to<br>
process highband results uses the more conservative geometric mean  <br><br>
WO 2006/107834	25	PCT/US2006/012228<br><br>
[00095] Other implementations of mean calculator C90 may be configured to use a different kind of mean, such as the harmonic mean. In a further implementation of coincidence detector C62, one or both of the initial and terminal region indication signals SB50, SB60 is weighted with respect to the other before or after clipping.<br>
[00096] Other implementations of coincidence detector C60 are configured to detect bursts by measuring a time distance between leading and trailing edges. For example, one such implementation is configured to identify a burst as the region between a leading edge in initial region indication signal SB 50 and a trailing edge in terminal region indication signal SB60 that are no more than a predetermined width apart. The predetermined width is based on an expected duration of a highband burst, and in one example a width of about 4 milliseconds is used.<br>
[00097] A further implementation of coincidence detector C60 is configured to expand each leading edge in initial region indication signal SB50 in the forward direction by a desired time period (e.g. based on an expected duration of a highband burst), to expand each trailing edge in terminal region indication signal SB60 in the backward direction by a desired time period (e.g. based on an expected duration of a highband burst). Such an implementation may be configured to generate the corresponding burst indication signal SB 10, SB20 as the logical AND of these two expanded signals or, alternatively, to generate the corresponding burst indication signal SB10, SB20 to indicate a relative strength of the burst across an area where the regions overlap (e.g. by calculating a mean of the signals SB 10, SB20). Such an implementation may be configured to expand only edges that exceed a threshold value. In one example, the edges are expanded by a time period of about 4 milliseconds.<br>
[00098] Attenuation control signal generator C20 is configured to generate attenuation control signal SB70 according to a relation between lowband burst indication signal SB 10 and highband burst indication signal SB20. For example, attenuation control signal generator C20 may be configured to generate attenuation control signal SB70 according to an arithmetic relation between burst indication signals SB 10 and SB20, such as a difference.<br>

WO 2006/107834	26	PCT/US2006/012228<br><br>
 signal SB10 and highband burst indication signal SB20 by subtracting the former from the latter. The resulting difference signal indicates where bursts exist in the high band that do not occur (or are weaker) in the low band. In a further implementation, one or both of the lowband and highband burst indication signals SB10, SB20 is weighted with respect to the other.<br>
[000100] Attenuation control signal calculator C100 outputs attenuation control signal SB70 according to a value of the difference signal. For example, attenuation control signal calculator C100 may be configured to indicate an attenuation that varies according to the degree to which the difference signal exceeds a threshold value.<br>
[000101]It may be desired for attenuation control signal generator C20 to be configured to perform operations on logarithmically scaled values. For example, it may be desirable to attenuate highband speech signal S30 according to a ratio between the levels of the burst indication signals (for example, according to a value in decibels or dB), and such a ratio may be easily calculated as the difference of logarithmically scaled values. The logarithmic scaling warps the signal along the magnitude axis but does not otherwise change its shape. FIGURE 17 shows an implementation C14 of burst detector C12 that includes an instance C130-1, C130-2 of logarithm calculator C130 configured to logarithmically scale (e.g., according to a base of 10) the smoothed envelope in each of the forward and backward processing paths.<br>
[000102]In one example, attenuation control signal calculator C100 is configured to calculate values of attenuation control signal SB70 in dB according to the following formula:<br><br><br><br>
[000104] where DdB denotes the difference between highband burst indication signal SB20 and lowband burst indication signal SB10, TdB denotes a threshold value, and AdB is the corresponding value of attenuation control signal SB70. In one particular example, threshold TdB has a value of 8 dB.<br><br>
WO 2006/107834	27	PCT/US2006/012228<br>
[000105]In another implementation, attenuation factor calculator C100 is configured to indicate a linear attenuation according to the degree to which the difference signal exceeds a threshold value (e.g., 3 dB or 4 dB). In this example, attenuation control signal SB70 indicates no attenuation until the difference signal exceeds the threshold value. When the difference signal exceeds the threshold value, attenuation control signal SB70 indicates an attenuation value that is linearly proportional to the amount by which the threshold value is currently exceeded.<br>
[000106]Highband burst suppressor C202 includes a gain control element, such as a multiplier or amplifier, that is configured to attenuate highband speech signal S30 according to the current value of attenuation control signal SB70 to produce processed highband speech signal S30a. Typically, attenuation control signal SB70 indicates a value of no attenuation (e.g., a gain of 1.0 or 0 dB) unless a highband burst has been detected at the current location of highband speech signal S30, in which case a typical attenuation value is a gain reduction of 0.3 or about 10 dB.<br>
[000107] An alternative implementation of attenuation control signal generator C22 may be configured to combine lowband burst indication signal SB 10 and highband burst indication signal SB20 according to a logical relation. In one such example, the burst indication signals are combined by computing the logical AND of highband burst indication signal SB20 and the logical inverse of lowband burst indication signal SB 10. In this case, each of the burst indication signals may first be thresholded to obtain a binary-valued signal, and attenuation control signal calculator C100 may be configured to indicate a corresponding one of two attenuation states (e.g., one state indicating no attenuation) according to the state of the combined signal.<br>
[000108]Before performing the envelope calculation, it may be desirable to shape the spectrum of one or both Of speech signals S20 and S30 in order to flatten the spectrum and/or to emphasize or attenuate one or more particular frequency regions. Lowband speech signal S20, for example, may tend to have more energy at low frequencies, and it may be desirable to reduce this energy. It may also be desirable to reduce high-frequency components of lowband speech signal S20 such that the burst detection is based primarily on the middle frequencies. Spectral shaping is an optional operation that may improve the performance of burst suppressor C200.<br><br>
WO 2006/107834	28	PCT/US2006/012228<br>
[000109] FIGURE 18 shows a block diagram of an implementation C16 of burst detector C14 that includes a shaping filter CI 10. In one example, filter CI 10 is configured to filter lowband speech signal S20 according to a passband transfer function such as the following:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
which attenuates very low and high frequencies.<br>
[000110]It may be desired to attenuate low frequencies of highband speech signal S30 and/or to boost higher frequencies. In one example, filter CI 10 is configured to filter highband speech signal S30 according to a highpass transfer function such as the following:<br><br><br><br><br>
which attenuates frequencies around 4 kHz.<br>
[000111] It may be unnecessary in a practical sense to perform at least some of the burst detection operations at the full sampling rate of the corresponding speech signal S20, S30. FIGURE 19 shows a block diagram of an implementation CI 8 of burst detector C16 that includes a downsampler C120 configured to downsample the corresponding smoothed envelope in each of the forward and backward processing paths. In one example, each downsampler C120 is configured to downsample the envelope by a factor of eight. For the particular example of a 20-millisecond frame sampled at 8 kHz (160 samples), such a downsampler reduces the envelope to a 1 kHz sampling rate, or 20 samples per frame. Downsampling may considerably reduce the computational complexity of a highband burst suppression operation without significantly affecting performance.<br>
[000112] It may be desirable for the attenuation control signal applied by gain control element C150 to have the same sampling rate as highband speech signal S30. FIGURE 20 shows a block diagram of an implementation C24 of attenuation control signal generator C22 that may be used in conjunction with a downsampling version of burst detector C10. Attenuation control signal generator C24 includes an upsampler C140<br><br>
WO 2006/107834	29	PCT/US2006/012228<br>
configured to upsample attenuation control signal SB70 to a signal SB70a having a sampling rate equal to that of highband speech signal S30.<br>
[000113]In one example, upsampler C140 is configured to perform the upsampling by zeroth-order interpolation of attenuation control signal SB70. In another example, upsampler C140 is configured to perform the upsampling by otherwise interpolating between the values of attenuation control signal SB70 (e.g., by passing attenuation control signal SB70 through an FIR filter) to obtain less abrupt transitions. In a further example, upsampler C140 is configured to perform the upsampling using windowed sine functions.<br>
[000114]In some cases, such as in a battery-powered device (e.g., a cellular telephone), highband burst suppressor C200 may be configured to be selectively disabled. For example, it may be desired to disable an operation such as highband burst suppression in a power-saving mode of the device.<br>
[000115] As mentioned above, embodiments as described herein include implementations that may be used to perform embedded coding, supporting compatibility with narrowband systems and avoiding a need for transcoding. Support for highband coding may also serve to differentiate on a cost basis between chips, chipsets, devices, and/or networks having wideband support with backward compatibility, and those having narrowband support only. Support for highband coding as described herein may also be used in conjunction with a technique for supporting lowband coding, and a system, method, or apparatus according to such an embodiment may support coding of frequency components from, for example, about 50 or 100 Hz up to about 7 or 8 kHz.<br>
[000116] As mentioned above, adding highband support to a speech coder may improve intelligibility, especially regarding differentiation of fricatives. Although such differentiation may usually be derived by a human listener from the particular context, highband support may serve as an enabling feature in speech recognition and other machine interpretation applications, such as systems for automated voice menu navigation and/or automatic call processing. Highband burst suppression may increase accuracy in a machine interpretation application, and it is contemplated that an<br><br>

implementation of highband burst suppressor C200 may be used in one or more such applications without or without speech encoding.<br>
[000117] An apparatus according to an embodiment may be embedded into a portable device for wireless communications such as a cellular telephone or personal digital assistant (PDA). Alternatively, such an apparatus may be included in another communications device such as a VoIP handset, a personal computer configured to support VoIP communications, or a network device configured to route telephonic or VoIP communications. For example, an apparatus according to an embodiment may be implemented in a chip or chipset for a communications device. Depending upon the particular application, such a device may also include such features as analog-to-digital and/or digital-to-analog conversion of a speech signal, circuitry for performing amplification and/or other signal processing operations on a speech signal, and/or radio-frequency circuitry for transmission and/or reception of the coded speech signal.<br>
[000118]It is explicitly contemplated and disclosed that embodiments may include and/or be used with any one or more of the other features disclosed in the U.S. Provisional Pat. Appls. Nos. 60/667,901 and 60/673,965 of which this application claims benefit and in the related patent applications listed above. Such features include generation of a highband excitation signal from a lowband excitation signal, which may include other features such as anti-sparseness filtering, harmonic extension using a nonlinear function, mixing of a modulated noise signal with a spectrally extended signal, and/or adaptive whitening. Such features include time-warping a highband speech signal according to a regularization performed in a lowband encoder. Such features include encoding of a gain envelope according to a relation between an original speech signal and a synthesized speech signal. Such features include use of overlapping filter banks to obtain lowband and highband speech signals from a wideband speech signal. Such features include shifting of highband signal S30 and/or highband excitation signal S120 according to a regularization or other shift of narrowband excitation signal S80 or narrowband residual signal S50. Such features include fixed or adaptive smoothing of coefficient representations such as highband LSFs. Such features include fixed or adaptive shaping of noise associated with quantization of coefficient representations such as LSFs. Such features also include fixed or adaptive smoothing of a gain envelope, and adaptive attenuation of a gain envelope.<br><br>

ABSTRACT<br>
Title: "SYSTEMS, METHODS, AND APPARATUS FOR HIGHBAND BURST<br>
SUPPRESSION"<br>
In one embodiment, a highband burst suppressor includes a first burst detector configured to detect bursts in a lowband speech signal, and a second burst detector configured to detect bursts in a corresponding highband speech signal. The lowband and highband speech signals may be different (possibly overlapping) frequency regions of a wideband speech signal. The highband burst suppressor also includes an attenuation control signal calculator configured to calculate an attenuation control signal according to a difference between outputs of the first and second burst detectors. A gain control element is configured to apply the attenuation control signal to the highband speech signal. In one example, the attenuation control signal indicates an attenuation when a burst is found in the highband speech signal but is absent from a corresponding region in time of the lowband speech signal.<br></td>
