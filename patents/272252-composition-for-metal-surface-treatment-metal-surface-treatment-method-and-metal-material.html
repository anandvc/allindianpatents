COMPOSITION FOR METAL SURFACE TREATMENT, METAL SURFACE TREATMENT METHOD, AND METAL MATERIAL<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a metal surface treatment composition for use in media surface treatment, a metal surface treatment method for treating the surface of a metal material using the surface treatment composition  and a metal material treated with the metal surface treatment method.<br>
BACKGROUND ART When an article to be processed is to be coated, it is<br>
commonly subjected to surface treatment from the viewpoint of ensuring the corrosion resistance and adhesiveness of a coating film.  In particular, when a metal (metal material, metal structure) is to be coated, the metal surface is subjected to chemical conversion treatment (surface treatment) for chemically forming a chemical conversion coating film.<br>
An example of the chemical conversion treatment is chromate conversion treatment with a chromate containing composition; however, adverse effects of chromium have been noted.  In recent years, a zinc phosphate treatment agent .(zinc phosphate treatment) has been widely used as a chromium-free treatment agent (surface treatment agent, chemical conversion treatment agent) (see, for example, Patent Document 1).<br>
However, the zinc phosphate treatment agent is highly reactive due to the high content of metal ions and acids that<br>
 <br>
it contains, hence this treatment agent exerts an unfavorable impact on both the cost and the workability during drainage treatment.  In addition, metal surface treatment with the zinc phosphate treatment agent involves the generation and sedimentation of water-insoluble salts.  Such precipitates are generally referred to as sludge, and the removal and disposal of sludge generates an additional undesirable cost. Furthermore, the use of phosphate ions is not preferable because they may affect the environment through eutrophication, and the treatment of phosphate ion effluent requires considerable labor. Moreover, metal surface treatment with the zinc phosphate treatment agent requires surface adjustmentj. which can prolong the total treatment process.<br>
In addition to the zinc phosphate treatment agent and chromate conversion treatment agent, a chemical conversion treatment agent containing a zirconium compound is known (see, for example, Patent Document 2). The chemical conversion treatment agent, including a zirconium compound, contains less metal ions and acids, and hence is not as reactive.  This offers a favorable cost advantage and improved workability during drainage treatment.  Such a chemical conversion treatment agent is also superior to the above-described zinc phosphate treatment agent in regard to the inhibition of sludge generation.<br>

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION Problems to be Solved by the Invention<br>
However, a chemical conversion treatment agent containing zirconium usually contains highly toxic fluorine compounds such as hydrofluoric acid, which must be handled with great care.  Further, the waste liquid after carrying out a chemical conversion treatment using a metal surface treatment composition including a fluorine compound will invariably also include fluorine ions (fluoride ions) or complex fluoride ions, which are equally harmful as fluorine compounds- Accordingly^ with the current concern about environmental preservation, it is desired to develop a metal surface treatment composirion which, as far as possible, does not include fluorine compounds which have a high environmental load.<br>
Further, because prior zirconium based chemical conversion treatment agents use zirconium fluoride as a zirconium compound, the surface of a chemical conversion coating film will have Zr-F bonds, which cannot be said to have good adhesiveness to a coating film. Because of this, in order to improve the adhesiveness to the coating film, currently experiments are being carried out such as the addition of polyamine compounds.<br>
The present invention takes the above problems into account, and its objective is to provide a metal surface treatment composition which can orovide the same bs.se  metal<br>
 <br>
concealing properties, coating tilm aanesrveness, duu corrosion resistance as the prior art, a metal surface treatment composition which does not impart a burden on the environment and which has easy handling, a metal surface treatment method carried out on the surface of a metal material using this metal surface treatment composition, and a metal material treated by this metal surface treatment method.

Effects of the Invention<br>
According to the present invention, in a metal surface treatment composition containing a zirconium compound and/or titanium compound substantially not including fluorine, and an inorganic acid and/or salt thereof, by controlling the pH of the metal surface treatment composition to from 1.5 to 6.5, it is possible to provide a metal surface treatment composition which can form a chemical conversion coating film having the<br>
 <br>
same base metal concealing properties, coating film adhesiveness, and corrosion resistance as the prior art, in addition to having easy handling without imparting a burden on the environment, a metal surface treatment method which carries out surface treatment of the metal material usijig this metal surface treatment composition, and a metal material treated by this metal surface treatment method.<br>
PREFERRED MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Below, the metal surface treatment composition, metal surface treatment method, and metal material of the present embodiment are explained.in detail. Metal Surface Treatment Composition<br>
A metal surface treatment composition according to the present embodiment is used for metal surface treatment, and includes a zirconium compound and/or titanium compound, and an inorganic acid and/or salt thereof.<br>
Further, the metal surface treatment composition according to the present embodiment is diluted with water, and adjusted to make a metal surface treatment solution, which is used for metal surface treatment. Zirconium compound and/or titanium compound component<br>
.Zirconium and/or titanium derived from the zirconium compound and/or titanium compound component contained in the metal surface treatment composition according to the present embodiment is a component for forming a chemical conversion coating film. The formation of a chemical conversion coating<br>
 <br>
film including zirconium and/or titanium on a metal material allows the improvement of corrosion resistance and abrasion resistance of the metal material.<br>
Hitherto, metal surface treatment compositions containing<br>
fluorine such as K2ZrF6, (NH4)22rF6 and the like have been used,<br>
but the zirconium compound and/or titanium compound of the<br>
metal surface treatment composition according to the present<br>
embodiment; is one substantially not including fluorine. The<br>
expression "substantially not including fluorine" refers to<br>
the case that the measured value of the fluorine element<br>
concentration using an ion chromatograph SERIES 20001<br>
(manufactured hy  Dionex Corporation} is 10 ppm or less. - 	■<br>
When a metal material is subjected to surface treatment with the metal surface trearment composition including a zirconium compound and/or titanium compound according to the present embodiment, the metal constituting the metal material causes dissolution.  When a dissolution reaction of a metal occurs, due to an increase of the pH at the interface, hydroxides or oxides of zirconi^im and/or titanium are generated, and are thought to deposit on the surface of a metal material. Then, the adhesiveness of the chemical conversion coating film and the coating film formed on the surface of this chemical conversion coating film becomes good due to the presence of Zr-0 bonds and/or Ti-0 bonds derived from these hydroxides and/or oxides of zirconium and/or titanium.<br>
Further, the zirconium comooand and/or titanium compound<br>
 <br>
of the metal surface treatment composition according to .the present embodiment, unlike the prior art, is one   substantially not including fluorine. Accordingly, on the surface of the chemical conversion coating film formed by the metal surface treatment composition, there are no Zr-F bonds and/or Ti-F bonds which inhibit the adhesiveness to the coating film on the surface of the chemical conversion coating film, and thus it is possible to maintain a good adhesiveness of the chemical conversion coating film and the coating film formed on its surface.<br>
The zirconium compound is not particularly limited, and a nitrate, nitrite, sulfate, sulfite^ chloride, bromide, oxide, hydroxide, peroxide, and carbonate of zirconium, and the like, can be mentioned.  It is preferable that this zirconium compound is a compound which generates an acid, so that, the pH in the metal surface treatment is from 1.5 to 6.5 as mentioned above, but even in the case that it does not generate an acid, an acid can be added as described below.<br>
In the same way, the titanium compound is not particularly limited, and a nitrate, nitrite, sulfate, sulfite, chloride, bromide, oxide, hydroxide, peroxide, and carbonate of titanium, and the like, can be mentioned. Content of Zirconium and/or Titanium<br>
The content of zirconium and/or titanium in the metal surface treatment composition according to the present embodiment is preferably within the range from 10 ppm to 10000 ppm with respect to the metal element.  If the content is less<br>
 <br>
than 10 ppm, a"sufficient amount of coating cannot be provided on a metal material, and   if it is more than 10000 ppm,   no further improvement is expected and cost efficiency decreases. This content is mors preferably from 50 ppm to 1000 ppm with respect to the metal element. Inorganic Acid and/or Salt Thereof<br>
The inorganic acid and/or salt thereof included in the metal surface treatment composition according to the present embodiment it thought to promote the coating film formation reaction as an oxidant. As the inorganic acid, nitric acid, nitrous acid, sulfuric acid, sulfurous acid, persulfuric acid, phospho^eic acid, " hydrochloric acid, bromic acid, chloric ^acid-, ■ hydrogen peroxide, HMnO^, HVO3, H2WO4 and H2M0O4 and the like can be mentioned.  Further, in the meral surface treatment composition, as an oxidant, it is possible to include carboxylic acid group-containing compounds, sulphonic acid group-containing compounds-, and/or salts thereof. pH of the Metal Surface Treatment Composition<br>
The pH of" the metal surface treatment composition of the present embodiment is from 1.5 to 6.5.  If the pH is less than 1.5, the etching is excessive, and it may be impossible to obtain sufficient coating film formation, the coating film may be non-uniform, which may have an adverse effect on the external appearance "of the coating.  On the other hand, if it exceeds 6.5, the etching will be insufficient and a good coating film cannot be obtained. The pH is preferably from 2 to 5, and more preferably in a range from 2.5 to 4.5.<br>
 <br>
Further-, the pH of the metal surface treatment composition can be adjusted with acidic compounds such as nitric acid, sulfuric acid, and the like, and basic compounds such as sodium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, ammonia, and the like.<br>

The organosiloxane which can be included in the metal surface treatment composition according to the present embodiment acts on both of the surface of metal material and the coating film formed after metal surface treatment, to improve the adhesiveness between them.  It is assumed that the effect is produced as   follows: the alkoxy group in the organosiloxane is hydrolyzed to generate a silanol, which acts on the surface of the metal material through hydrogen bonds; and amino groups of the organosiloxane act on the coating film through chemical bonds or hydrogen bonds, which improves the adhesiveness between the coating film and the" metal material. More specifically, the organosiloxane contained in the chemical conversion coating film acts on both the metal material and coating film to improve the adhesiveness between them.<br>
Further, in order to improve the adhesiveness, the organosiloxane is preferably a monocondensate of the organosilane shown in the above Formula (7), or a cocondensate of the organosilane shown in the above Formula (7).  In order to further improve the adhesiveness, the organosilane shown in the above Formula (7) is preferably a cocondensate.  In the case that the organosiloxane is a monocondensate of the organosilane shown in the above Formula (7), then from among the organosilanes shown in the above Formula (7), an organosiloxane of monocondensed organosilanes having amino groups is produced.  Further, in the case  that the<br>
 <br>
organosiloxane is a cocondensate of the organosilane shown in the above Formula (7), then it is prepared so that an organosilane not having amino groups and and an organosilane having amino groups are cocondensed, and it includes at least two amino groups per molecule.  Polycondensates such as the above are balanced so as to have at least two amino groups per molecule. The at least two amino groups of the organosiloxane are have the characteristics of improving the adhesiveness to the coating film, and, because of the basicity of the amino groups, facilitating coprecipitation of the organosiloxane to deposit in the coating film during the formation of a chemical conversion coating film of zirconium or titanium. Accordingly, the film deposition and the adhesiveness can be improved with the metal surface treatment composition including an organosiloxane which is a monocondensate of the organosilane represented by the above general formula (7}, or cocondensate of the organosilane represented by the above general formula (7).<br>
The organosiloxane used in the present embodiment is a polycondensate of the organosilane represented by the above general formula (7) and has in a molecule thereof at least two amino groups.  Therefore, once it is polymerized, it is considered not to be readily hydrolyzed to monomers by dilution. The reason that the organosiloxane is stable in an aqueous solution is considered that the binding energy of Si-0-Si in the organosiloxane is significantly higher than the binding energy of Si-O-C- Further, the reason that the<br>
 <br>
organosiloxane having amino groups is stable in an aqueous solution is considered that silanol is neutralized by amino groups, and unpaired electrons on  nitrogen atoms coordinate on silicon atoms to relieve polarization in silanol.  Accordingly, the organosiloxane is relatively stable even if it is mixed in the metal surface treatment composition, and hence, it is effectively incorporated into a chemical conversion coating film to contribute to the improvement of the adhesiveness of the chemical conversion coating film.<br>
As specific organosiloxanes, those which are cocondenstes of organosilane and having at least 2 amino groups per molecule., such as vinyltrichlorsilane, vinyltrimet;ho^ysilanej vinyltriethoxysilane, 2-<br>
(3,4epoxyGycloheKyl)ethyltrimethoxysilane, 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane, 3-glycidoxypropylmethyldiethoxysilane, 3-<br>

As the organosilane which is the raw material of the organosiloxane, commercially available amino group-containing silane coupling agents, such as KBM-403, KBM-602, KBM-603, KBE-603, KBM-903, KBE-903, KBE-9103, and KBM-573 {all manufactured by Shin-Etsu Chemical Co.,   Ltd.)-, and XS1003 (manufa.ctured. by Chisso Corporation) and the like can be used.<br>
Because there is a tendency for the hydroxides or oxides of the Eirconium or titanium to be more readily incorporated as the number average molecular weight of the above organosiloxane becomes higher, it is preferably in the range from 150 to 500,000.  If less than 150, it is not possible to obtain a chemical conversion coating film having sufficient coating film adhesiveness, which is not preferable.  If over 500,000., there is concern that coating film formation will be inhibited. The above lower limit is more preferably 5,000, and the above upper limit is more preferably 70,000. Organosilane<br>
The metal surface treatment composition according to the present embodiment may further contain an organosilane having at least one amino group per molecule.  In the same way as for<br>
 <br>
the above organosiioxane, the organosilane having at least one -amino group per molecule, because it has amino groups, is considered to improve the adhesiveness when incorporated into the chemical conversion coating film.  Specifically, as an organosilane having at least one amino group per molecule, N-(2-aminoethyl)-S-aminopropylmethyldimethoxysilane, N- (2-aminoethyl)-3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, N-(2-aminoethyl)-3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane, 3-amihopropyltrimethoxysilane, 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane, 3-triethoxysilyl-N- (1, 3-diinethyl-butylidene)propylamine,  N-phenyl-3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, hydrochlorides of N-(vinylbenzyl)-2-aminoethyl-3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane,- -and the like can be mentiened.. -- ■ - -Blocked Isocyanate<br>
The blocked isocyanate which can be included in the metal surface treatment composition according to the present embodiment is a polycondensate of a compound (monomer) having at least one blocked isocyanate group per molecule.  For the blocked isocyanate group, with heating, the blocking group dissociates and generates isocyanate groups. A compound having at least one blocked isocyanate group per molecule can be obtained by the addition of a blocking group to a compound having at least one isocyanate group per molecule.  The compound having at least one isocyanate group per molecule is not particularly limited, and for example, aliphatic diisocyanates such as hexamethylenediisocyanate (including trimer), tetramethylenediisocyanate, and trimethylhexametylenediisocyante; alicyclic polyisocyanates<br>
 <br>
such as isophoronediisocyanate, 4,4'-<br>
methylenebis(cyclohexylisocyanate) and the like, and aromatic<br>
diisocyanates such as 4,4'-diphenylmethanediisocyanate,<br>
tolylenediisocyanate and xylylenediisocyanate and the like can<br>
be mentioned.<br>
Molecular Weight of Blocked Isocyanate<br>
The blocked isocyanate has a number average molecular weight within the range from 150 to 500,000.  If less than 150, it is not possible to obtain a chemical conversion coating film having sufficient coating film adhesiveness, which is not preferable.  If over 500,000, there is concern that coating film formation will be inhibit_ed. ^ The above lower limit is more preferably 5,000, and the above upper limit is more preferably 70,000. Surfactant<br>
The metal surface treatment composition according to the present embodiment may further include at least one kind of surfactant selected from the group consisting of nonionic surfactants, anionic surfactants, cationic surfactants, .and amphoteric surfactants. The nonionic surfactants, anionic surfactants, .cationic surfactants, and amphoteric surfactants may be known ones.  In the case where the metal surface treatment composition used in the present embodiment includes the above surfactants, a favorable film is formed with no necessity for degreasing and cleansing of the metal material in advance. Metal Element<br>
 <br>
The metal surface treatment composition according to the present embodiment may include a metal element which is capable of imparting adhesiveness and corrosion resistance ro the coating film.  Examples of the metal element which may be contained in the metal surface treatment composition as a chemical conversion treatment agent include magnesium, zinc, calcium, aluminum, gallium, indium, copper, iron, manganese, nickel, cobalt, cerium, strontium, rare earth elements, and silver. Metal Surface Treatment Method<br>
The metal surface treatment method which carries out a<br>
surface-treatment of a metal according to the present . -	<br>
embodiment is not particularly limited, and can be carried out by contacting a metal surface treatment solution   containing the metal surface treatment composition according to the present embodiment with a metal material. More specifically, the metal surface treatment method according to the present embodiment includes a treatment solution contact step of contacting a metal surface treatment solution containing the metal surface treatment composition with a metal material. Examples of the above metal surface treatment method include an immersion method, spray method, roll coat method, and flow coating. Surface Treatment Conditions<br>
The treatment temperature in the surface treatment is preferably within the range of 20'C to 70°C.  If the temperature is lower than 20°C, sufficient film formation may<br>
 <br>
not be achieved, and inconveniences may occur, such as the necessity to control temperature during the summer season and if above 10°C,   there is no particular effect, and it is economically disadvantageous.  The treatment temperature is more preferably within the range from 30°C to 50°C.<br>
The treatment time for the surface treatment is preferably within the range from 5 seconds to 1100 seconds. If less than 5 seconds, a sufficient coating film amount cannot be obtained, which is undesirable, and there is no meaning for a time over 1100 seconds, because there is no effect from further increasing the coating film amount.  This treatment time is more preferably within the range from 30 seconds to 120 seconds.<br>
The metal surface treatment method according to the present embodiment, in contrast with the conventional chemical conversion treatment method with a zinc phosphate chemical conversion treatment agent, does not require surface adjustment treatment in advance. This allows chemical conversion treatment of a metal material with fewer processes.<br>
Further, in the metal surface treatment method according to the present embodiment, a metal material may be electrolyzed as a cathode.  In this case, hydrogen is reduced at the interface of the metal material as a cathode to increase the pH. With the increase of pH, stability of the compound containing the zirconium and/or titanium element decreases at the interface of the cathode, by which a surface treatment film deposits as an oxide or hydroxide containing<br>
 <br>
water.<br>
Metal Material<br>
The metal material for use in the metal surface treatment method according to the present embodiment is not particularly limited, and examples thereof include a steel sheet and aluminum plate.  Steel sheet is not particularly limited and includes cold-rolled steel, hot-rolled steel, mild steel, or high tensile steel, and also include iron-based base materials (iron-based metal materials), aluminum-based base materials (aluminum-based metal materials), zinc-based base materials (zinc-based metal materials), and magnesium-based base materials (magnesium-based metal materials).  Iron-based base ■ -materials refer to base materials (metal materials) including iron and/or iron alloy, aluminum-based base materials refer to base materials (metal materials) including aluminum and/or aluminum, alloy, and zinc-based base materials refer to base materials (metal materials) including zinc and/or zinc alloy. Magnesium-based base materials refer to base materials (metal materials) including magnesium and/or magnesium alloy.<br>
When surface treating the above base materials other than an iron-based base material using the metal surface treatment composition containing a zirconium compound and/or titanium compound, there is not a large difference in the corrosion resistance and adhesiveness to the coating film of the formed coating film between a metal surface treatment composition substantially including fluorine and a metal surface treatment comDosition substantially not includina fluorine and either<br>
 <br>
one is favorable. On the other hand, when surface treating an iron-based metal, in the point of corrosion resistance of the formed coating film, both the case of substantially including fluorine and the case of substantially not including fluorine are good and show no difference between them, but in the point of adhesiveness to the coating film, a metal surface treatment composition substantially not including fluorine can have an improved adhesiveness to the coating film. Namely, in the above base material, when carrying out a surface treatment of a iron-based base material, the metal surface treatment composition containing a zirconium compound and/or titanium compound.substantially not including fluorine of the present embodiment is useful as an iron-based metal surface treatment composition.<br>
Furthermore, the metal surface treatment method according to the present embodiment may be simultaneously applied to a metal material including a plurality of metal base materials, such as iron-based base materials, aluminum-based base materials, and zinc-based base materials. Automobile bodies and automobile parts are constituted of various metal materials such as iron, zinc, aluminum and the like, but according to the metal surface treatment method according to the present embodiment, a satisfactory surface treatment can be carried out with a single treatment even for such automobile bodies and automobile body parts.<br>
Iron-based base materials used as a metal material according to the present embodiment are not particularly<br>
 <br>
limited, and examples thereof include cold-rolled steel and hot-rolled steel.  The aluminum-based base materials are also not particularly limited, and examples thereof include 5000 series aluminum alloy, 5000 series aluminum alloy, and aluminum-coated steel plates treated by aluminum-based electroplating, hot dipping, or vapor deposition plating. Zinc-based base materials are also not particularly limited, and examples thereof include zinc or zinc-based alloy coated steel plates treated by zinc-based electroplating, hot dipping, or vapor deposition plating, such as zinc coated steel plate, zinc-nickel coated steel plate, zinc-iron coated steel plate, zinc-chromium coated steel plate, zinc-aluminum coated steel plate, zinc-titanium coated steel plate, zinc-magnesium coated steel plate, and zinc-manganese coated steel plate.  High tensile steel plates are available in various grades depending on strength and manufacturing process, and examples thereof include J3C44 0J, 440P, 4 4DW, 590R, 5 90T, 590Y, 7 8 0T, 7SOY, 980Y, and IISOY. ■ Amount of Surface Treatment Film<br>
In order to increase the corrosion resistance of iron-based metal materials such as cold-rolled steel sheets, hot-rolled steel sheets, cast iron, sintered materials, and the like, and to form a uniform surface treatment coating film, and obtain satisfactory adhesiveness, if the surface treatment coating layer formed on an iron-based metal material surface contains at least 10 rag/m^ of zirconium element and/or titanium element, it is preferable for the mass ratio of the zirconium<br>
 <br>
element and/or titanium element with respect to the nitrogen element as analyzed by XPS of the surface treatment coating layer to be 0.05 to 500.<br>
Further, in order to increase the corrosion resistance of zinc-based metal materials such as zinc or galvanized steel sheets, alloy hot dip galvanized steel sheets and the like, and to form a uniform chemical conversion coating film, and obtain a satisfactory adhesiveness, if the surface treatment coating layer formed on a zinc-based metal material surface contains at least 10 mg/m^ of zirconium element and/or tit&amp;nium element, it is preferable for the zirconium element and/or .titanityiL element, mass ratio with respect to the nitrogen,., element as analyzed by XPS of the surface treatment coating layer to be 0.05 to 500.<br>
Further, in order to increase the corrosion resistance of aluminum-based metal materials such as cast aluminum, aluminum alloy sheets and the like, to form a uniform chemical conversion coating film, and obtain a satisfactory adhesiveness, if the surface treatment coating layer formed on an aluminum-based metal material surface contains 5 mg/m^ or more of zirconium element and/or titanium element, it is preferable for the zirconium element and/or titanium element mass ratio with respect to the nitrogen element as analyzed by XPS of the surface treatment coating layer to be 0.05 to 500.<br>
Further, in order to increase the corrosion resistance of magnesium-based metal materials such as magnesium alloy sheets, cast magnesium and the like, and to form a uniform chemical<br>
 <br>
conversion coating film, and obtain a satisfactory adhesiveness, if the surface treatment coating layer formed on a magnesium-based metal material surface contains at least 5 mg/m^ of zirconium element and/or titanium element, it is preferable for the zirconium element and/or titanium element mass ratio with respect to the nitrogen element as analysed by XPS of the surface treatment coating layer to be 0.05 to 500.<br>
For any of the metal material, there is no particular upper limit for the amount of the surface treatment coating layer, but if the amount is excessive, the surface treatment coating layer tends to cause cracking, which makes difficult the operation of forming a uniform film. Accordingly,■the amount of the surface treatment film formed by the metal surface treatment method of the present embodiment preferably is 1 q/ic?   or less, more preferably is 800 mg/m^ or less of zirconium and/or titanium with respect to the metal .element. Pretreatment of Metal Material<br>
The metal material according to the present embodiment is preferably a metal material which has been cleansed by degreasing treatment. After the degreasing treatment, the metal material of the present embodiment is preferably subjected to water washing treatment. The degreasing treatment and water washing treatment are conducted for removing oil and stains from the surface of the metal material.  In usual cases, immersion treatment is conducted for several minutes at 9 temperature from 30°C to 55"C using a degreasing agent such as a phosphate-free and nitrogen-free degreasing detergent.  If<br>
 <br>
desired, preliminary degreasing treatment may be conducted before the degreasing treatment.  Furthermore, for removing the degreasing agent, water washing treatment is conducted after the degreasing treatment at least once by spray treatment with a large amount of washing water.<br>
As described above, in the case where the metal surface treatment composition includes the surfactant, a favorable film is formed with no necessity of degreasing and cleansing of the metal material in advance. More specifically, in such a case, degreasing treatment of the metal material is simultaneously achieved in the treatment solution contact step. Aftertreatment of Metal Material<br>
A metal material having formed thereon a chemical conversion coating film by the metal surface treatment method according to the present embodiment is preferably subjected to water washing treatment before the subsequent formation of a coating film. More specifically, the metal surface treatment method according to the present embodiment includes a treatment solution contact step of contacting a metal surface treatment solution containing the metal surface treatment composition with the metal material, and a water washing step of washing the metal material with water after the treatment solution contact step.  Impurities on the surface of the chemical conversion coating film are removed by the water washing treatment before the formation of a coating film, which further improves the adhesiveness to a coating film to offer favorable corrosion resistance.<br>
 <br>
If the chemical conversion coating film formed by the metal surface treatment method according to the present embodiment incorporates a polyamine compound, a blocked isocyanate having at least 2 blocked isocyanates in one molecule, or an organopolysiloxane having at least 2 amino groups in one molecule, then is it possible to carry out a water washing treatment before the coating film formation. Namely, if the amine compounds are monomers, there is concern that they will be removed by the water washing treatment, whereas for a polyamine compound which is a polymer, there is a strong interaction with hydroxides or oxides of zirconium and/or titanium which form the chemical- conversion coating film, thus there is no such concern. Accordingly, the chemical conversion coating film formed by the metal surface treatment method according to the present embodiment will not-lose its adhesiveness by water washing treatment.<br>
In the water washing treatment after the surface treatment, the final water washing is preferably conducted with pure water.  The water washing treatment after the suriace treatment may be spray water washing, immersion water washing, or a combination thereof.<br>
Following the water washing treatment after the surface treatment, drying may be conducted as necessary in accordance with a known method, but in the case where a chemical conversion coating film is formed by the metal surface treatment method according to the present embodiment, the film mav be coated after water washing treatment with no necessity<br>
 <br>
for drying treatment. More specifically, the formation of a chemical conversion coating film by the meral surface treatment method according to the present embodiment could be followed by coating by a wet and wet coating method. Accordingly, the metal surface treatment method according to the present embodiment allows for the reduction of the surface treatment process for metal materials before electro-deposition coating, such as an automobile body, body shell of a two-wheel vehicle or the like, various parts, and the like before electro-deposition coating. Subsequently Formed Coating Film<br>
Following the formation of a chemical conversion coating film by the metal surface treatment method according to the present embodiment, a coating film is formed on the chemical conversion coating film, and examples thereof include coating films formed by conventionally known paints such as an electro-deposition paint, solvent paint, aqueous paint, and powder paint.<br>
Among these paints, electro-deposition paint, particularly cationic electro-deposition paint, is preferable for forming a coating film. The reason is that the cationic electro-deposition paint usually includes a resin having a functional group which exhibits reactivity or compatibility with amino groups, and hence, it acts on the polyamine compound having amino groups contained in the metal surface treatment composition as a chemical conversion treatment agent to further improve the adhesiveness between the electro-<br>
 <br>
deposition coating film and the chemical conversion coating -film.  The cation electro-deposition paint is not particularly limited, and examples thereof include known cationic electro-deposition paints such as an arainated epoxy resin, aminated acrylic resin, and sulfonated epoxy resin.<br>
Following the water washing step of washing the metal material with water after the treatment solution contact step of contacting the metal surface treatment solution containing the metal surface treatment composition according to the present embodiment, or following electrolytic treatment by contact, the metal material may be contacted with an acidic aqueous solution containing at least one selected from the group consisting of cobalt, nickel, tin, copper, titanium, and zirconium.  More specifically, the metal surface treatment method according to the present embodiment may include, following the water washing step of washing with water the metal material after the treatment solution contact step, an acid contact step of contacting the metal material with an acidic aqueous solution containing at least one selected from the group consisting of cobalt, nickel, tin, copper, titanium, and zirconium.  This further improves the corrosion resistance.<br>
The supply source of at least one metal element selected from the group consisting of cobalt, nickel, tin, copper, titanium and zirconium is not particularly limited.  Preferable examples thereof include oxides, hydroxides, chlorides, nitrates, oxynitrates, sulfates, oxysulfates, carbonates, oxycarbonates, phosphates, oxyphosphates, oxalates,<br>
 <br>
oxyoxalates, and organic metal compounds of the metal elements which are readily available.<br>
The acidic aqueous solution containing the metal elements preferably has a pH of 2 to 6.  The pH of the acidic aqueous solution may be adjusted with an acid such as phosphoric acid, nitric acid, sulfuric acid, hydrofluoric acid, hydrochloric acid, and organic acid, and alkali such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, alkali metal salt, ammonia, ammonium salt, and amine.<br>
Following the water washing step of washing the metal material with water after the treatment solution contact step of contacting,the metal surface,treatment solution containing the metal surface treatment composition according to the present embodiment with the metal material, or following electrolytic treatment by contact, the metal material may be contacted with a polymer-containing solution which contains at least one of a water-soluble polymer compound and water-dispersible polymer compound. More specifically, the metal surface treatment method according to the present embodiment may include, following the water washing step of washing with water the metal material after the treatment solution contact step, a polymer-containing solution contact step of contacting the metal material with a polymer-containing solution which contains at least one of a water-soluble polymer compound and water-dispersible polymer compound.  This further improves corrosion resistance.<br>
The water-soluble polymer compound and water-dispersible<br>
 <br>
polymer compound are not particularly limited, and examples thereof include polyvinyl alcohol, poly{meth)acrylic acid, copolymer of acrylic acid and methacrylic acid, copolymers of ethylene and acrylic monomer such as (meth)acrylic acid and (meth)acrylate, copolymer of ethylene and vinyl acetate, polyurethane, aminomodified phenolic resin, polyester resin, epozy resin, tannin, tannic acid and its salts, and phytic acid.<br>
EXAMPLES The invention is further illustrated by the following<br>
■£x-amples and Comparative Examples, but-the invention ■■should ■ not be limited to them.  The blending quantity represents parts by mass unless otherwise noted. Example 1<br>

Before the surface treatment (chemical conversion treatment) of the metal material, a metal surface treatment composition was prepared.
