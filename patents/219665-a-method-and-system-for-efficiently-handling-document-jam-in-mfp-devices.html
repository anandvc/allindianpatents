FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention in general relates to multi function peripheral (MFP) devices including devices such as scanners, copiers and fax machines. Further, this invention relates to document jam in the MFP devices. More particularly, this invention relates to a method and system for real time help mechanism for efficiently handling document jam in MFP devices.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
Presently, multi function peripheral devices are essential in most areas of work. It has been found that a major drawback in the use of multi functional devices especially scanners and facsimile devices is document jam. Since there are no effective tools for handling document jam situations in multi function devices, the problem increasingly affects the functioning of the devices.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary object of the invention is to invent a system and method of real time help mechanism for efficiently handling document jam in MFP devices.<br>
It is another object of this invenfion to invent a system and method for the generation and tracking of extra ordinary situations like document jamming in the scanner unit of the MFP.<br>
It is another object of the invention to invent a system and method wherein a printout would be fired after the document jam, which shall contain the details about the jam and help to the user to clear the document jam.<br><br>
It is another object of the invention to introduce a system and method that provides Help to the end user in clearing document jam in MFPs easily and without the need for referring to user manuals.<br>
It is also an object of the invention to provide a system and method of help in reducing the downtime of the machine for which special guide is provided by way of print out mechanism. Without a print out, the user might face difficulties and would call the administrator to clear the jam which would take more time than the user himself clearing the jam. This way the downtime is reduced.<br>
Accordingly the present invention relates to a method for handling of document jam in the multi function peripheral device by providing information to the user and to initiate a printout containing help instructions , the method comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	feeding the documents to the MFP devices;<br>
(b)	detecting of the jammed documents in a time bound manner; and<br>
(c)	responding by way of automatic mechanism by use of printer device and fire a print out detailing the steps to be taken to recover from the jam.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention further comprises a system for the detection, tracking and help in recovery of documents jammed in multi function peripheral devices, the system comprising:<br>
(a)	Mechanism    for taking    step-by-step help print out of jammed<br>
document; and<br>
(b)	Dual sensors which detect and recognize the exact location of the jammed document when the jam occurs and<br>
(c)	indicator for giving real-time alert in the manner of print out help when a document jam is detected.<br>
These and other objectives, features and advantages of the invention will become<br><br>
readily apparent from the reading of the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment taken in connection with the accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWING Figure 1 shows the block diagram of the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiment is merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
Figure 1 shows the block diagram of the present invention. Here, first the user starts scanning of the document. Then an error occurs which may lead to extra ordinary situation of document jam. This activity is detected and monitored by sensors which include one entry sensor and one exit sensor.<br>
If the document does not pass through the exit sensor after having passed through the entry sensor within a predefined time, then the alert is sent which is displayed in the user interface panel. The alert is generated from one piece of the MFP firmware that keeps watching the sensors and it is sent to another piece of MFP firmware that initiates printing.<br>
This will lead to automatic firing of print out which will inform the user the step-by-step manner of handling and clearing the document jam.<br><br>
The process may be carried out by the steps given below:<br>
1)	The MFP document feeder has entry and exit sensors for the documents.<br>
2)	The first activity that occurs is that the entry sensors will record in the timing of entry of document in to the scanner.<br>
3)	Then the mechanism will calculate the average minimum time required to complete the process and that will be intimated to exit sensors.<br>
4)	The exit mechanism will then try to check continuously whether the document being processed completes its activity in the given time limit.<br>
5)	The mechanism involves detecting of the jammed documents in a time bound manner and then to respond in real time by way of firing automatic mechanism by use of printer device and then to fire a print out.<br>
6)	If the document has passed through the entry sensor but has not passed through the exit sensor with in pre-specified time, this means that a document jam has occurred.<br>
7)	In the present scenario, when a document jam occurs while scanning, the display panel of the MFP s gives out an error message such as 'Document Jam'.<br>
8)	The mechanism also provides that when a document jam occurs, a print out shall be fired which shall contain help details for the user on how to clear the document jam.<br>
9)	The print out shall contain clear and detailed information that show the step-by-step procedure to the user on how to clear the document jam. The step-by-step activities shall also contain images and sentences.<br>
10)Document jam can be classified based on the different positions of the<br><br>
document in between the sensors. For example, if the head of the document has passed entry sensor but not reached the of the exit sensor, the head has reached the exit sensor but the tail has not reached the exit etc. These could be termed Document Jam 1, Document Jam 2 etc.<br>
11)Whenever a document jam occurs, depending on the position of the jam, a help page to clear the jam shall be printed out. The print out shall contain clear and detailed information to help the user remove the jam.<br>
12) When a jam occurs,<br>
I.	it would be identified by the MFP using the sensors although they were present earlier then also their ability to function in a novel manner is found out;<br>
II.	appropriate message would be displayed on the LCD; and<br>
III.  a help page would be printed whereby the user will be guided on handling<br>
documents jams that will make the application more user friendly.<br>
13)The existing interfaces for the printer in any MFP shall be reused. Some<br>
memory shall be occupied for storing the help page and small increase in code.<br>
A command to invoke the printer to be sent to print the help page shall be made to<br>
print it out whenever a document jam occurs. A Command shall be sent to the<br>
printer to print the help page. The printer has the capability to print image stored in<br>
the memory.  In the Memory is stored the set of commands to execute the print<br>
operation.. When one such command is given to the printer along with the memory<br>
address, the printer would print the help page.<br>
It is to be understood that the sensor detects whether the document passed it or not and not the nature of jam itself which is carried out by the MFP firmware.<br><br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a computer, printer or a multi function device.<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart therefrom.<br><br>
