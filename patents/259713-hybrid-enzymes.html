				<td>HYBRID ENZYMES<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates, inter alia, to hybrid enzymes comprising a carbohydrate binding module and having endo-amylase activity. The enzymes may be applied in processes comprising starch modification and/or degradation, or in dough making processes.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Bacterial endo-amylases are used in a large number of processes, e.g., for liquefaction of starch in processes where starch is modified, and/or degraded to smaller polymers or monomers of glucose. The degradation products may used in the industry, e.g., as maltose and/or fructose syrups or further processed in a fermentation step to a fermentation product, e.g., ethanol. The bacterial endo-amylases are used in baking to give additional softness and a better moistness of the bread crumb. However, the endo-amylases are easy to overdose which may results in gumminess and an undesirable loss in elasticity in the baked product. There is a need for endo-amylases with improved properties for use in various processes, e.g., within starch processing and baking.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present inventors have now surprisingly discovered that by addition of a carbohydrate binding module (CBM) to an endo-amylase the catalytic activity of the endo-amylase can be modified thereby resulting in an increased baking performance compared to the wild type enzyme. There is no significant change in the taste or smell of the baked product. Without being bound by theory it is suggested that the effect is due to an increased activity towards raw starch in the dough conferred by the CBM, and/or a reduced activity towards the heated starch in the baking bread conferred by the CBM. The endo-amylase with a CBM can be used as a baking enzyme with less risk of overdosing compared to the enzyme without a CBM. Such hybrids consisting of a polypeptide having endo-amylase activity and a carbohydrate binding module, primarily having affinity for starch like e.g. the CBM20, have the advantage over existing endo-amylases that by selecting a catalytic domain with desire properties e.g. the pH profile, the temperature profile, the oxidation resistance, the calcium stability, the substrate affinity or the product profile can be combined with a carbohydrate binding module with stronger or weaker binding affinities, e.g., specific affinities for amylose, specific affinities for amyiopectin or affinities for specific structure in the carbohydrate. The hybrid may be used as a baking additive, e.g., as an anti-staling enzyme.<br>
The  present  inventors  have  further  surprisingly discovered  that  by  adding  a carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) to an endo-amylase the activity and specificity can be<br><br>
altered thereby increasing the efficacy of various starch degrading processes, e.g., comprising degradation of raw, e.g., ungeiatinized starch as weil as gelatinized siarch. Due to the superior hydrolysis activity of these endo-amyiases having a CBM the overall starch conversion process can be performed without having to gelatinize the starch, i.e. the endo-amylases having a CBM hydrolyses granular starch in a raw starch process as weli as fully or partially gelatinized starch in a traditional starch process.<br>
Accordingly the invention provides in a first aspect a polypeptide which polypeptide is a hybrid comprising; a first amino acid sequence having endo-amylase activity and a second amino acid sequence comprising a carbohydrate-binding module. Preferably said first amine acid sequence and/or said amino acid second sequence is derived from a bacterium. The second amino acid sequence has preferably at least 60% identity to the amino acid sequence shown as amino acid residues 485 to 586 in SEQ ID NO:2 and/or the first amino acid sequence has at least 60% identity to the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:35.<br>
In a second aspect the invention provides a process for preparing a dough or an edible product made from a dough, which process comprises adding the polypeptide of the first aspect to a dough.<br>
In a third and a fourth aspect the invention provides a composition comprising the polypeptide of the first aspect, and a dough- or bread-improving additive in the form of a granulate or agglomerated powder comprising the polypeptide of the first aspect.<br>
In a fifth aspect the invention provides a process for designing a polypeptide suitable for baking, said process comprising; providing a first amino acid sequence having endo-amylase activity, and a second amino acid sequence comprising a carbohydrate-binding module; wherein said first amino acid sequence is derived from a bacterium; providing a second amino acid sequence comprising a carbohydrate-binding module; and constructing a polypeptide comprising said first amino acid sequence with said second amino acid sequence.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Hybrid enzymes<br>
The polypeptide of the invention may be a hybrid enzyme comprises a first amino acid<br><br>
sequence having endo-amylase activity, and a second amino acid sequence comprising a carbohydrate-binding module (CBM). The hybrid may be produced by fusion of a first DNA sequences encoding a first amino acid sequences and a second DNA sequences encoding a second amino acid sequences, or the hybrid may be produced as a completely synthetic gene based on knowledge of the amino acid sequences of suitable CBMs, linkers and catalytic domains.<br>
The terms "hybrid enzyme" (also referred to as "fusion protein", "hybrid", hybrid polypeptide" or "hybrid protein) is used herein to characterize the polypeptides of the invention comprising a first amino acid sequence comprising at least one catalytic module having endo-amylase activity and a second amino acid sequence comprising at least one carbohydrate-binding module wherein the first and the second are derived from different sources. The term "source" being understood as e.g., but not limited, to a parent enzyme, or a variant thereof, e.g., an amylase or glucoamylase, or other catalytic activity comprising a suitable catalytic module and/or a suitable CBM and/or a suitable linker. However the CBM may also be derived from a polypeptide having no catalytic activity. The first and the second amino acid sequence may be derived from the same bacterial strain, from strains within the same species, from closely related species or less related organisms. Preferably the first and the second amino acid sequence of the hybrids derived from different sources, e.g., from different enzymes from the same strain and/or species, or e.g., from strains within different species.<br>
Enzyme classification numbers (EC numbers) referred to in the present specification are in accordance with the Recommendations of the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (http://www.chem.qmw.ac.uk/iubmb/enzyme/).<br>
Hybrid enzymes as referred to herein include species comprising an amino acid sequence of an endo-amylase, i.e. an alpha-amylase (EC 3.2.11) which is linked (i.e. covaiently bound) to an amino acid sequence comprising a carbohydrate-binding module (CBM). The hybrid enzyme is thus an enzyme capable of catalyzing hydrolysis of starch in an endo-fashion.<br>
CBM-containing hybrid enzymes, as well as detailed descriptions of the preparation and purification thereof, are known in the art [see, e.g., WO 90/00609, WO 94/24158 and WO 95/16782, as well as Greenwood et al. Biotechnology and Bioenqineerinq 44 (1994) pp. 1295-1305]. They may, e.g., be prepared by transforming into a host cell a DNA construct comprising af least a fragment of DNA encoding the carbohydrate-binding module ligated, with or without a linker, to a DNA sequence encoding the enzyme of interest, and growing the transformed host cell to express the fused gene. The linker may be a bond (i.e. comprising 0 residues), or a short linking group comprising from about 2 to about 100 carbon atoms, in particular of from 2 to 40 carbon atoms. However, the linker is preferably a sequence of 0 amino acid residues (e.g., just a bond) or it is from about 2 to about 100 amino acid residues, more preferably of from 2 to 40 amino acid residues, such as from 2 to 15 amino add residues. Preferably the linker is not sensitive to or at least has low sensitivity towards hydrolysis by a protease, which e.g., may be<br><br>
present during production of the hybrid and/or during the industrial application of the hybrid. The CBM in a hybrid enzyme of the type in question may be positioned Oterminaiiy, N-terminally or internally in the hybrid enzyme, in an embodiment a polypeptide may comprise more than one CBM, e.g., two CBMs; one positioned C-terminally, the other N-terminaliy or the two CBMs in tandem positioned C-terminaily, N-terminally or internally. However, polypeptides with more than two CBMs are equally contemplated.<br>
Polypeptide identity<br>
The term polypeptide "identity" is understood as the degree of identity between two sequences indicating a derivation of the first sequence from the second. The identity may suitably be determined by means of computer programs known in the art such as GAP provided in the GCG program package (Program Manual for the Wisconsin Package, Version 8, August 1994, Genetics Computer Group, 575 Science Drive, Madison, Wisconsin, USA 53711) (Needieman, S.B. and Wunsch, CD., (1970), Journal of Molecular Biology, 48, 443-453. The following settings for amino acid sequence comparison are used: GAP creation penalty of 3.0 and GAP extension penalty of 0.1. The relevant part of the amino acid sequence for the identity determination is the mature polypeptide, i.e. without the signal peptide.<br>
Carbohydrate-binding modules<br>
A carbohydrate-binding module (CBM), or as often referred to, a carbohydrate-binding domain (CBD), is a polypeptide amino acid sequence which binds preferentially to a poly- or oligosaccharide (carbohydrate), frequently - but not necessarily exclusively - to a water-insoluble (including crystalline) form thereof.<br>
CBMs derived from starch degrading enzymes are often referred to as starch-binding modules or SBMs (CBMs which may occur in certain amylolytic enzymes, such as certain glucoamylases, or in enzymes such as cyclodextrin glucanotransferases, or in endo-amylases). SBMs are often referred to as SBDs (Starch Binding Domains). Prefered for the invention are CBMs which are Starch Binding Modules.<br>
CBMs are found as integral parts of large polypeptides or proteins consisting of two or more polypeptide amino acid sequence regions, especially in hydrolytic enzymes (hydrolases) which typically comprise a catalytic module containing the active site for substrate hydrolysis and a carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) for binding to the carbohydrate substrate in question. Such enzymes can comprise more than one catalytic module and one, two or three CBMs, and optionally further comprise one or more polypeptide amino acid sequence regions linking the CBM(s) with the catalytic module(s), a<br><br>
region of the latter type usually being denoted a "linker". CBMs have also been found in algae, e.g., in the red alga Porphyra purpurea in the form of a non-hydrclytic poiysaccharide-binding protein.<br>
In proteins/polypeptides in which CBMs occur (e.g., enzymes, typically hydrolytic enzymes), a CBM may be located at the N or C terminus or at an internal position.<br>
That part of a polypeptide or protein (e.g., hydrolytic enzyme) which constitutes a CBM per se typically consists of more than about 30 and less than about 250 amino acid residues. The "Carbohydrate-Binding Module of Family 20" or a CBM-20 module is in the context of this invention defined as a sequence of approximately 100 amino acids having at least 45% identity to the Carbohydrate-Binding Module (CBM) of the polypeptide disclosed in figure 1 by Joergensen et al (1997) in Biotechnol. Lett. 19:1027-1031. The CBM comprises the last 102 amino adds of the polypeptide, i.e. the subsequence from amino acid 582 to amino acid 683. The numbering of Glycoside Hydrolase Families applied in this disclosure follows the concept of Coutinho, P.M. &amp; Henrissat, B. (1999) CAZy ~ Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes server at URL: http://afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/~-cazy/CAZY/index.html or alternatively Coutinho, P.M. &amp; Henrissat, B. 1999; The modular structure of cellulases and other carbchydrate-actrve enzymes: an integrated database approach. In "Genetics, Biochemistry and Ecology of Cellulose Degradation", K. Ohmiya, K. Hayashi, K. Sakka, Y. Kobayashi, S. Karita and T. Kimura eds., Uni Publishers Co., Tokyo, pp. 15-23, and Bourne, Y. &amp; Henrissat, B. 2001; Glycoside hydrolases and glycosyltransferases: families and functional modules, Current Opinion in Structural Biology 11 ;593-500.<br>
Examples of enzymes which comprise a CBM suitable for use in the context of the invention are endo-amylases (i.e. alpha-amylases in EC 3.2.1.1), maltogenic a!pha-amy!ases (EC 3.2.1.133), glucoamylases (EC 3.2.1.3) or from CGTases (EC 2.4.1.19).<br>
Preferred for the invention is CBMs of Carbohydrate-Binding Module Family 20. CBMs of Carbohydrate-Binding Module Family 20 suitable for the invention may be derived from beta-amylases of Baciilus cereus (SWISSPROT P36924), or from CGTases of Bacillus circulans (SWISSPROT P43379). Also preferred for the invention is any CBM having at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80% or even at least 90% identity to any of the afore mentioned CBM amino acid sequences. Further suitable CBMs of Carbohydrate-Binding Module Family 20 may be found at URL: http://afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/'-cazy/CAZY/index.html).<br>
Once a nucleotide sequence encoding the substrate-binding (carbohydrate-binding) region has been identified, either as cDNA or chromosomal DNA, it may then be manipulated in a variety of ways to fuse it to a DNA sequence encoding the enzyme of interest. The DNA fragment encoding the carbohydrate-binding amino acid sequence and the DNA encoding the enzyme of interest are then iigated with or without a linker. The resulting ligated DNA may then be manipulated in a variety of ways to achieve expression.<br>
CBMs deriving from bacteria will generally be suitable for use in the context of the invention, however, preferred are CBMs of bacillus origin, such as a CBM20 from Bacillus<br><br>
flavothermus (Syn. Anoxybaciilus contaminans), preferably from amylase AMY 1048 (SEQ ID NO:2 herein), AMY1039, or AMY1079 (disclosed as respectively SEQ ID NOI, 2 and 3 in PCT/US2004/023031 [NZ10474]), the Bacillus amylases disclosed in WO 2002063589 from Diversa, Bacillus sp.

Stabilization of hybrids<br>
A hybrid of the invention may be volatile to proteolytic attack if the CBM and catalytic domain proteins do not form sufficiently tight protein-protein interactions. However, the stability of the hybrid can be improved by introducing substitutions on the surface of either of the proteins to create a stable hybrid.<br>
The present inventors have identified the following amino acid residues on the surface of bacterial endo-amyiases, e.g., such polypeptides having at least 60% identity to the amylase from Bacillus licheniformis (SEQ ID NO:8), to be in close contact with the CBM when comprised in the hybrid of the invention, i.e. within less than 5.0 A distance. These residues are suitable targets for mutations in order to make a stable hybrid: 12, 29, 30, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36.. 37, 38, 368, 371, 372, 381, 383, 384, 386, 387, 388, 389, 390, 391, 392, 394, 395, 396, 422, 423, 448, 449, 450, 451, 452, 453, 454, 455, 456, 458, 459, 460, 461, 483, 484, 485 using the numbering of SEQ ID NO: 40. Preferably the catalytic domain of the hybrid of the invention comprises one or more substitutions in positions corresponding to these residues.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the hybrid of the invention comprises a) the catalytic domain shown in SE ID NO:40 or a homologous catalytic domain, and b) the CBM shown as residue 485 to 585 of SEQ ID NO:2, wherein one or more, or preferably all, of the following substitutions have been introduced: N33S, K35S/A, D36A/N/S, K37L, E391I, Q394R, K395D, N484A/P using<br><br>

Expression vectors<br>
The present invention also relates to recombinant expression vectors which may comprise a DNA sequence encoding the hybrid enzyme, a promoter, a signal peptide sequence, and transcriptional and translational stop signafs. The various DNA and control sequences described above may be joined together to produce a recombinant expression vector which may include one or more convenient restriction sites to allow for insertion or substitution of the DNA sequence encoding the polypeptide at such sites. Alternatively, the DNA sequence of the present invention may be expressed by inserting the DNA sequence or a DNA construct comprising the sequence into an appropriate vector for expression. In creating the expression vector, the coding sequence is located in the vector so that the coding sequence is operably linked with the appropriate control sequences for expression and possibly secretion.<br>
The recombinant expression vector may be any vector (e.g., a plasmid or virus), which can be conveniently subjected to recombinant DNA procedures and can bring about the expression of the DNA sequence. The choice of the vector will typically depend on the compatibility of the vector with the host cell into which the vector is to be introduced- The vectors may be linear or closed circular plasmids. The vector may be an autonomously replicating vector, I.e. a vector which exists as an extrachromosomal entity, the replication of which is independent of chromosomal replication, e.g., a plasmid, an extrachromosomal element, a minichromosome, a cosmid or an artificial chromosome. The vector may contain any means for assuring self-replication. Alternatively, the vector may be one which, when introduced into the host cell, is integrated into the genome and replicated together with the chromosome(s) into which it has been integrated. The vector system may be a single vector or plasmid or two or more vectors or plasmids which together contain the totai DNA to be introduced into the genome of the host cell, or a transposon.<br>
Host cells<br>
The host ceil of the invention, either comprising a DNA construct or an expression vector comprising the DNA sequence encoding the polypeptide of the first aspect, e.g., a hybrid enzyme, is advantageously used as a host cell in the recombinant production of the hybrid enzyme, wild type enzyme or a genetically modified wild type enzyme. The ceil may be<br><br>
transformed with an expression vector. Alternatively, the cell may be transformed with the DNA construct of the invention encoding the hybrid enzyme or a genetically modified wild type enzyme, conveniently by integrating the DNA construct (in one or more copies) in the host chromosome. Integration of the DNA construct into the host chromosome may be performed according to conventional methods, e.g... by homologous or heterologous recombination.<br>
The host ceil may be any appropriate prokaryotic or eukaryotic ceiif e.g., a bacteria! cell, a filamentous fungus ceil, a yeast ceil, a plant cell or a mammalian cell.<br>
Isolating and cloning a DNA sequence encoding a parent endo-amylase<br>
The techniques used to isolate or clone a DNA sequence encoding the polypeptide of the first aspect, e.g., a hybrid enzyme, are known in the art and include isolation from genomic DNA, preparation from cDNAf or a combination thereof. The cloning of the DNA sequences of the present invention from such genomic DNA can be effected, e.g., by using the well known polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or antibody screening of expression libraries to detect cloned DNA fragments with shafed structural features. See, e.g., Innis et a/.T 1990, PCR: A Guide to Methods and Application, Academic Press, New York. Other DNA amplification procedures such as ligase chain reaction (LCR), ligated activated transcription (LAT) and DNA sequence-based amplification (NASBA) may be used.<br>
The DNA sequence encoding a parent endo-amylase may be isolated from any cell or microorganism producing the endo-amylase in question, using various methods well known in the art. First, a genomic DNA and/or cDNA library should be constructed using chromosomal DNA or messenger RNA from the organism that produces the endo-amylase to be studied. Then, if the amino acid sequence of the endo-amylase is known, labeled oligonucleotide probes may be synthesized and used to identify endo-amylase-encoding clones from a genomic library prepared from the organism in question. Alternatively, a labelled oligonucleotide probe containing sequences homologous to another known endo-amylase gene could be used as a probe to identify endo-amylase-encoding clones, using hybridization and washing conditions of very low to very high stringency.<br>
Yet another method for identifying endo-amylase-encoding clones would involve inserting fragments of genomic DNA into an expression vector, such as a plasmid, transforming endo-amylase-negative bacteria with the resulting genomic DNA library, and then plating the transformed bacteria onto agar containing a substrate for endo-amylase (/.e. maltose), thereby allowing clones expressing the endo-amyiase to be identified.<br>
Alternatively, the DNA sequence encoding the enzyme may be prepared synthetically by established standard methods, e.g., the phosphoroamidite method described S.L Beaucage and M.H. Caruthers, (1981), Tetrahedron Letters 22, p. 1859-1869, or the method described by Matthes et al. (1984), EMBO J. 3, p. 801-805. In the phosphoroamidite method, oligonucleoti-<br><br>
des are synthesized, e.g., in an automatic DNA synthesiser, purified, annealed, ligated and cloned in appropriate vectors.<br>
Finally, the DNA sequence may be of mixed genomic and synthetic origin, mixed synthetic and cDNA origin or mixed genomic and cDNA origin, prepared by ((gating fragments of synthetic, genomic or cDNA origin (as appropriate, the fragments corresponding to various parts of the entire DNA sequence), in accordance with standard techniques. The DNA sequence may also be prepared by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using specific primers, for instance as described in US 4,683,202 or R.K. Saiki et al. (1988), Science 239, 1988, pp. 487-491.<br>
Isolated DNA sequence<br>
The present invention relates, inter alia, to an isolated DNA sequence comprising a DNA sequence encoding a polypeptide of the first aspect, e.g., a hybrid enzyme.<br>
The term "isolated DNA sequence" as used herein refers to a DNA sequence, which is essentially free of other DNA sequences, e.g., at least about 20% pure, preferably at least about 40% pure, more preferably at least about 60% pure, even more preferably at least about 80% pure, and most preferably at least about 90% pure as determined by agarose electrophoresis.<br>
For example, an isolated DNA sequence can be obtained by standard cloning procedures used in genetic engineering to relocate the DNA sequence from its natural location to a different site where it will be reproduced. The cloning procedures may involve excision and isolation of a desired DNA fragment comprising the DNA sequence encoding the polypeptide of interest, insertion of the fragment into a vector molecule, and incorporation of the recombinant vector into a host cell where multiple copies or clones of the DNA sequence will be replicated. An isolated DNA sequence may be manipulated in a variety of ways to provide for expression of the polypeptide of interest. Manipulation of the DNA sequence prior to its insertion into a vector may be desirable or necessary depending on the expression vector. The techniques for modifying DNA sequences utilizing recombinant DNA methods are well known in the art.<br>
DNA construct<br>
The present invention relates, inter alia, to a DNA construct comprising a DNA sequence encoding a polypeptide of the first aspect "DNA construct" is defined herein as a DNA molecule, either single- or double-stranded, which is isolated from a naturally occurring gene or which has been modified to contain segments of DNA, which are combined and juxtaposed in a manner, which would not otherwise exist in nature. The term DNA construct is synonymous with the term expression cassette when the DNA construct contains all the<br><br>
control sequences required for expression of a coding sequence or ine present invention.<br>
Site-dfrected mutagenesis<br>
Once a parent endo-amylase-encoding DNA sequence suitable for use in a polypeptide of the first aspect has been isolated, and desirable sites for mutation identified, mutations may be introduced using synthetic oligonucleotides. These oligonucleotides contain nucleotide sequences flanking the desired mutation sites. In a specific method, a single-stranded gap of DNA, the endo-amylase-encoding sequence, is created in a vector carrying the endo-amyiase gene. Then the synthetic nucleotide, bearing the desired mutation, is annealed to a homologous portion of the single-stranded DNA. The remaining gap is then filled in with DNA polymerase 1 (Klenow fragment) and the construct is ligated using T4 ligase. A ispecific example of this method is described in Morinaga et ai. (1984), Biotechnology 2, p. 646-639. US 4,760,025 disclose the introduction of oligonucleotides encoding multiple mutations by performing minor alterations of the cassette. However, an even greater variety of mutations can be introduced at any one time by the Morinaga method, because a multitude of oligonucleotides, of various lengths, can be introduced.<br>
Another method for introducing mutations into endo-amylase-encoding DNA sequences is described in Nelson and Long, (1989), Analytical Biochemistry 180, p. 147-151. It involves the 3-step generation of a PCR fragment containing the desired mutation introduced by using a chemically synthesized DNA strand as one of the primers in the PCR reactions. From the PCR-generated fragment, a DNA fragment canying the mutation may be isolated by cleavage with restriction endonucieases and reinserted into an expression plasmid.<br>
Localized random mutagenesis<br>
The random mutagenesis may be advantageously localized to a part of the parent endo-amylase in question. This may, e.g., be advantageous when certain regions of the enzyme have been identified to be of particular importance for a given property of the enzyme, and when modified are expected to result in a variant having improved properties. Such regions may normally be identified when the tertiary structure of the parent enzyme has been elucidated and related to the function of the enzyme.<br>
The localized or region-specific, random mutagenesis is conveniently performed by use of PCR generated mutagenesis techniques as described above or any other suitable technique known in the art. Alternatively, the DNA sequence encoding the part of the DNA sequence to be modified may be isolated, e.g., by insertion into a suitable vector, and said part may be subsequently subjected to mutagenesis by use of any of the mutagenesis methods discussed above.<br><br>
Expression of the enzymes in plants<br>
A DNA sequence encoding an enzyme of interest, such as a hybrid enzyme of the present invention, may be transformed and expressed in transgenic plants as described below.<br>
The transgenic plant can be dicotyledonous or monocoty/edonous, for short a dicoi or a monocot Examples of monocot plants are grasses, such as meadow grass (blue grass, Poa), forage grass such as Festuca, Lolium, temperate grass, such as Agrostis, and cereals, e.g., wheat, oats, rye, barley, rice, sorghum and maize (corn).<br>
Examples of dicot plants are tobacco, legumes, such as lupins, potato, sugar beet, pea, bean and soybean, and cruciferous plants (family Brassicaceae), such as cauliflower, oil seed rape and the closely related model organism Arabidopsis thaliana.<br>
Examples of plant parts are stem, callus, leaves, root, fruits, seeds, and tubers as well as the individual tissues comprising these parts, e.g., epidermis, mesophyii, parenchyme, vascular tissues, meristems. in the present context, also specific plant cell compartments, such as chloropiast, apoplast, mitochondria, vacuole, peroxisomes and cytoplasm are considered to be a plant part. Furthermore, any plant cell, whatever the tissue origin, is considered to be a plant part. Likewise, plant pads such as specific tissues and cells isolated to facilitate the utilisation of the invention are also considered plant parts e.g., embryos, endosperms, aleurone and seeds coats.<br>
Also included within the scope of the invention are the progeny of such plants, plant parts and plant cells.<br>
The transgenic plant or plant cell expressing the enzyme of interest may be constructed in accordance with methods known in the art. In short the plant or plant cell is constructed by incorporating one or more expression constructs encoding the enzyme of interest into the plant host genome and propagating the resulting modified plant or plant cell into a transgenic plant or plant cell.<br>
Conveniently, the expression construct is a DNA construct which comprises a gene encoding the enzyme of interest in operable association with appropriate regulatory sequences required for expression of the gene in the plant or plant part of choice. Furthermore, the expression construct may comprise a selectable marker useful for identifying host cells into which the expression construct has been integrated and DNA sequences necessary for introduction of the construct into the plant in question (the latter depends on the DNA introduction method to be used).<br>
The choice of regulatory sequences, such as promoter and terminator sequences and • optionally signal or transit sequences is determined, e.g., on the basis of when, where and how the enzyme is desired to be expressed. For instance, the expression of the gene encoding the enzyme of the invention may be constitutive or inducible, or may be developmental, stage or tissue specific, and the gene product may be targeted to a specific cell compartment, tissue or plant part such as seeds or leaves. Regulatory sequences are, e.g., described byTague etal, Plant, Phys., 86, 506, 1988.<br><br>
For constitutive expression the 35S-CaMV, the maize ubiquitin 1 and the rice actin 1 promoter may be used (Franck et ai. 1980. Ceti 21: 285-294, Christensen AH; Shsrrock RA and Quail 1992. Maize poiyubiquitin genes: structure, thermal perturbation of expression and transcript splicing, and promoter activity following transfer to protoplasts by electroporation. Plant Mo. Biol. 18, 675-689.; Zhang Ws McElroy D. and Wu R 1991, Analysis of rice Act1 5! region activity in transgenic rice plants. Plant Cell 3, 1155-1165). Organ-specific promoters may, e.g., be a promoter from storage sink tissues such as seeds, potato tubers, and fruits (Edwards &amp; Coruzzi, 1990. Annu. Rev. Genet. 24: 275-303), or from metabolic sink tissues such as meristems (Ito et al., 1994. Plant Mol. Biol. 24: 863-878), a seed specific promoter such as the glutelin, prolamin, globulin or albumin promoter from rice (Wu et al., Plant and Cell Physiology Vol. 39, No. 8 pp. 885-889 (1998)), a Vicia faba promoter from the legumin 34 and the unknown seed protein gene from Vicia faba described by Conrad U. et al, Journal of Plant Physiology Vol. 152, No. 6 pp. 708-711 (1998), a promoter from a seed oil body protein (Chen et al., Plant and cell physiology vol. 39, No. 9 pp. 935-941 (1998), the storage protein napA promoter from Brassica napus, or any other seed specific promoter known in the art, e.g., as described in WO 91/14772. Furthermore, the promoter may be a leaf specific promoter such as the rbcs promoter from rice or tomato (Kyozuka et al., Plant Physiology Vol. 102, No. 3 pp. 991-1000 (1993), the chloreila virus adenine methyltransferase gene promoter (Mitra, A. and Higgins, DW, Plant Molecular Biology Vol. 26, No. 1 pp. 85-93 (1994), or the aldP gene promoter from rice (Kagaya et al., Molecular and General Genetics Vol. 248, No. 6 pp. 668-674 (1995), or a wound inducible promoter such as the potato pin2 promoter (Xu et al, Plant Molecular Biology Vol. 22, No. 4 pp. 573-588 (1993). Likewise, the promoter may inducible by abiotic treatments such as temperature, drought or alterations in salinity or induced by exogenously applied substances that activate the promoter e.g., ethanol, oestrogens, plant hormones like ethylene, abscisic acid and gibberellic acid and heavy metals.<br>
A promoter enhancer element may be used to achieve higher expression of the enzyme in the plant. For instance, the promoter enhancer element may be an intron which is placed between the promoter and the nucleotide sequence encoding the enzyme. For instance, Xu et al. op cit disclose the use of the first intron of the rice actin 1 gene to enhance expression.<br>
The selectable marker gene and any other parts of the expression construct may be chosen from those available in the art.<br>
The DNA construct is incorporated into the plant genome according to conventional techniques known in the art, including Agrobacterium-me6\a\e6 transformation, virus-mediated transformation, m'tcro injection, particle bombardment, bioiistic transformation, and electroporation (Gasser et al, Science, 244, 1293; Potrykus, Bio/Techn. 8, 535, 1990; Shimamoto et al, Nature, 338, 274, 1989).<br>
Presently,   Agrobacterium   fum&amp;far.mns  m^riiatftri   apne&gt;  transfer  is  thp.  method   nf<br><br>
choice for generating transgenic dicots (for review Hooykas &amp; Schilperoort, 1992. Plant Mol. Biol. 19: 15-38), and can also be used for transforming monocots, although other transformation methods often are used for these plants. Presently, the method of choice for generating transgenic rnonocots supplementing the Agrobacterium approach is particle bombardment (microscopic gold or tungsten particles coated with the transforming DNA) of embryonic calli or developing embryos (Christou, 1992. Plant J. 2: 275-281; Shimamoto, 1994. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 5: 158-162; Vasil et al., 1992. Bio/Technology 10: 667-674). An alternative method for transformation of monocots is based on protoplast transformation as described by Omirulleh S, et al., Plant Molecular biology Vol. 21, No. 3 pp. 415-428 (1993).<br>
Following transformation, the transformants having incorporated the expression construct are selected and regenerated into whole plants according to methods well-known in the art. Often the transformation procedure is designed for the selective elimination of selection genes either during regeneration or in the following generations by using e.g., co-transformation with two separate T-DNA constructs or site specific excision of the selection gene by a specific recombinase.<br>
Dough-based products<br>
The hybrid enzyme of the present invention may be used for the preparation of a dough-based edible product such as, bread, tortillas, cakes, pancakes, biscuits, cookies, pie crusts, more preferably baked products, such as, bread products.<br>
The dough used to prepare the dough based product generally comprises flour, e.g., from grains, such as, wheat flour, corn flour, rye flour, oat flour, or sorghum flour. The dough is generally leavened by the addition of a suitable yeast culture, such as a culture of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast) or a chemical leavening agent.<br>
The edible dough based product may preferably be any kind of baked product prepared from dough, either of a soft or a crisp character, either of a white, light or dark type.

Starch processing<br>
The polypeptide of this invention, i.e. an endo-amvlase having a CBM, possesses<br><br>
valuable properties allowing for a variety of industrial applications. In particular, enzymes of the first aspect are applicable as a component in washing, dishwashing and hard-surface cleaning detergent compositions. Numerous variants are particularly useful in the production of sweeteners and ethanoi from starch, and/or for textile desizing. One example of producing ethanoi, wherein an endo-amylase of the invention may be used is disclosed in US patent no. 5,231,017 which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Further, a process wherein an endo-amylase of the invention may be used is disclosed in DK patent application PA 2003 01568 (hereby incorporated by reference). Said process comprises hydrolysing starch into a soluble starch hydrolysate at a temperature below the initial gelatinization temperature of said granular starch. Another suitable process is disclosed in WO2004081193 (hereby incorporated by reference).<br>
Conditions for conventional starch- conversion processes, including starch liquefaction and/or saccharification processes are described in. e.g., US 3,912,590 and in EP patent publications Nos. 252,730 and 63,909.<br>
A preferred use is in a fermentation process wherein a starch substrate is liquefied and/or saccharified in the presence of the endo-amylase having a CBM io produce glucose and/or maltose, e.g., for use as sweeteners or suitable for conversion into a fermentation product by a fermenting organism, preferably a yeast. Such fermentation processes include a process for producing ethanoi for fuel or drinking ethano! (portable alcohol), a process for producing a beverage, a process for producing organic compounds, such as citric acid, itaconic acid, lactic acid, gluconic acid; ketones; amino acids, such as glutamic acid (sodium monoglutaminate), but also more complex compounds such as antibiotics, such as penicillin, tetracyclic enzymes; vitamins, such as riboflavin, B12, beta-carotene; hormones, which are difficult to produce synthetically.<br>
Production of sweeteners from starch:<br>
A "traditional" process for conversion of starch to fructose syrups normally consists of three consecutive enzymatic processes, viz. a liquefaction process followed by a saccharification process and an isomerization process. During the liquefaction process, starch is degraded to dextrins by an endo-amylase, preferably by an endo-amylase having a CBM, such as the polypeptide of the invention at pH values between 5.5 and 6.2 and at temperatures of 95-160°C for a period of approx. 2 hours. In order to ensure an optimal enzyme stability under these conditions, 1 mM of calcium is added (40 ppm free calcium ions).<br>
After the liquefaction process the dextrins are converted into dextrose by addition of a glucoamylase (e.g., AMG™) and a debranching enzyme, such as an isoamylase or a pullula-nase (e.g., Promozyme™)- Before this step the pH is reduced to a value beiow 4.5, maintaining the high temperature (above 95°C), and the liquefying endo-amylase activity is denatured. The temperature is lowered to 60°C, and glucoamylase and debranching enzyme are<br><br>
added. The saccharification process proceeds for 24-72 hours.<br>
After the saccharification process the pH is increased to a value in the range of 6-8, preferably pH 7.5, and the calcium is removed by ion exchange. The dextrose syrup is then converted into high fructose syrup using, e.g., an immmobtiized glucoseisomerase (such as Sweetzyme™).<br>

added together. When doing SSF it is common to introduce a pre-saccharification step at a temperature above 50°C, just prior to the fermentation.<br>
In accordance with the present invention the fermentation step (c) induces, without limitation, fermentation processes used to produce alcohols (e.g., ethanoi, methanol, butanoi); organic acids (e.g., citric acid, acetic acid, itaconic acid, lactic acid, gluconic acid); ketones (e.g., acetone); amino acids (e.g., glutamic acid); gases (e.g., H2 and C02); antibiotics (e.g., penicillin and tetracycline); enzymes; vitamins (e.g., riboflavin, B12, beta-carotene); and hormones. Preferred fermentation processes include alcohol fermentation processes, as are well known in the art. Preferred fermentation processes are anaerobic fermentation processes, as are well known in the art.<br>
From un-qelatinized starch: In this embodiment the invention relates to processes for producing a fermentation product from starch-containing material without gelatinization of the starch-containing material. In one embodiment a polypeptide of the invention, e.g. the hybrid enzyme of the first aspect, and optionally a glucoamylase is used during saccharification and fermentation. According to the invention the desired fermentation product, such as ethanoi, can be produced without liquefying the aqueous slurry containing the starch-containing material. In one embodiment a process of the invention includes saccharifying milled starch-containing material below the initial gelatinization temperature in the presence of the hybrid enzyme of the first aspect and a glucoamylase to produce sugars that can be fermented into the desired fermentation product by a suitable fermenting organism.<br>
A preferred process comprises a) contacting an aqueous granular starch slurry with a polypeptide comprising a first amino acid sequence having alpha-amylase activity and a second amino acid sequence comprising a carbohydrate-binding module, b) incubating said starch slurry with said polypeptide, c) fermenting to produce a fermentation product, and d) optionally recovering the fermentation product. Preferably the step b) is performed for a time and at a temperature sufficient to achieve conversion of at least 90% w/w of said starch substrate into fermentable sugars. Preferably the first amino acid sequence and/or second amino acid sequence of said polypeptide is derived from a bacterium. Said polypeptide may preferably be the hybrid of the first aspect.<br>
The term "initial gelatinization temperature" means the lowest temperature at which gelatinization of the starch commences. Starch heated in water begins to gelatinize between 50*C and 75"C; the exact temperature of gelatinization depends on the specific starch, and can readily be determined by the skilled artisan. Thus, the initial gelatinization temperature may vary according to the plant species, to the particular variety of the plant species as well as with the growth conditions. In the context of this invention the initial gelatinization temperature of a given starch-containing material is the temperature at which birefringence is lost in 5% of the starch granules using the method described by Gorinstein. S. and Lii. C, Starch/Starke, Vol. 44 (12) pp. 461-466 (1992).<br><br>
Before step (a) a slurry of starch-containing material, such as granular starch, having 20-55 wi-% dry solids, preferably 25-40 wt-% dry soiids, more preferably 30-35% dry so'-ids of starch-containing material may be prepared. The slurry/ may include water and/or process waters, such as stillage (backset), scrubber water, evaporator condensate or distillate, side stripper water from distillation, or other fermentation product plant process water. Because the process of the invention is carried out below the gelatinization temperature and thus no significant viscosity increase takes place, high levels of stillage may be used if desired. In an embodiment the aqueous slurry contains from about 1 to about 70 vo!.-% stillage, preferably 15-60% vol.-% stillage, especially from about 30 to 50 vol.-% stillage.<br>
The milled starch-containing material may be prepared by milling starch-containing material to a particle size of 0.05 to 3.0 mm, preferably 0.1-0.5 mm. After being subjected to a process of the invention at least 85%, at least 86%, at least 87%, at least 88%, at least 89%, at least 90%, ai least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, or preferably at least 99% of the dry solids of the starch-containing material is converted into a soluble starch hydrolysate.<br>
The process of the invention is conducted at a temperature below the initial gelatinization temperature. Preferably the temperature at which step (a) is carried out is between 30-75°C, preferably between 45-60°C.<br>
In a preferred embodiment step (a) and step (b) are carried out as a simultaneous saccharification and fermentation process. In such preferred embodiment the process is typically carried at a temperature between 28°C and 36°C, such as between 29°C and 35°C, such as between 30°C and 34°C, such as around 32CC. According to the invention the temperature may be adjusted up or down during fermentation.<br>
In an embodiment simultaneous saccharification and fermentation is carried out so that the sugar level, such as glucose level, is kept at a iow level such as below about 3 wt.-%, preferably below about 2 wt.-%, more preferred below about 1 wt.-%., even more preferred beiow about 0.5%, or even more preferred below about 0.1 wt.%. Such low levels of sugar can be accomplished by simply employing adjusted quantities of enzyme and fermenting organism. A skilled person in the art can easily determine which quantities of enzyme and fermenting organism to use. The employed quantities of enzyme and fermenting organism may also be selected to maintain low concentrations of maltose in the fermentation broth. For instance, the maltose level may be kept below about 0.5 wt.-% or below about 0.2<br>
wt-%.<br>
The process of the invention may be carried out at a pH in the range between 3 and 7, preferably from 3.5 to 6, or more preferably from 4 to 5.<br>
Starch-containing materials<br>
Any suitable starch-containing starting material, including granular starch, may be used according to the present invention. The starting material is generally selected based on<br><br>
the desired fermentation product. Examples of starch-containing starting materials, suitable for use in a process of present invention, include tubers, roots, stems, whole grains, corns: cobs, wheat, barley, rye, milo, sago, cassava, tapioca, sorghum, rice peas, beans, or cereals, sugar-containing raw materials, such as molasses, fruit materials, sugar, cane or sugar beet, potatoes, and cellulose-containing materials, such as wood or plant residues. Contemplated are both waxy and non-waxy types of corn and barley.<br>
The term "granular starch" means raw uncooked starch, i.e., starch in its natural form found in cereal, tubers or grains. Starch is formed within plant cells as tiny granules insoluble in water. When put in cold water, the starch granules may absorb a small amount of the liquid and swell. At temperatures up to 50°C to 75°C the swelling may be reversible. However, with higher temperatures an irreversible swelling called "gelatinization" begins. Granular starch to be processed may be a highly refined starch quality, preferably at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 97% or at least 99.5% pure or it may be a more crude starch containing material comprising milled whole grain including non-starch fractions such as germ residues and fibers. The raw material, such as whole grain, is milled in order to open up the structure and allowing for further processing. Two milling processes are preferred according to the invention: wet and dry milling. In dry milling whole kernels are milled and used. Wet milling gives a good separation of germ and meal (starch granules and protein) and is often applied at locations where the starch hydroiysate is used in production of syrups. Both dry and wet milling is well known in the art of starch processing and is equally contemplated for the process of the invention.<br>
The starch-containing material is milled in order to expose more surface area. !n an embodiment the particle size is between 0.05 to 3.0 mm, preferably 0.1-0.5 mm, or so that at least 30%, preferably at least 50%, more preferably at least 70%, even more preferably ai least 90% of the milled starch-containing material fit through a sieve with a 0.05 to 3.0 mm screen, preferably 0.1-0.5 mm screen.<br>
Fermentation Product<br>
The term 'fermentation product" means a product produced by a process including a fermentation step using a fermenting organism. Fermentation products contemplated according to the invention include alcohols (e.g., ethanol, methanol, butanoi); organic acids (e.g., citric acid, acetic acid, itaconic acid: lactic acid, gluconic acid); ketones (e.g., acetone); amino acids (e.g., glutamic acid); gases (e.g., H2 and C02); antibiotics (e.g., penicillin and tetracycline); enzymes; vitamins (e.g., riboflavin, B12, beta-carotene); and hormones. In a preferred embodiment the fermentation product is ethanol, e.g., fuel ethanol; drinking ethanol, i.e., potable neutral spirits; or industrial ethanol or products used in the consumable alcohol industry (e.g., beer and wine), dairy industry (e.g., fermented dairy products), leather industry and tobacco industry. Preferred beer types comprise ales, stouts, porters, lagers, bitters, malt liquors, happoushu, high-alcohol beer, low-alcohol beer, low-calorie beer or light<br><br>
beer. Preferred fermentation processes used include alcohol fermentation processes, as are well known in the art. Preferred fermentation processes are anaerobic fermentation processes, as are well known in the art.<br>
Fermenting Organisms<br>
"Fermenting organism" refers to any organism, including bacterial and.fungal organisms, suitable for use in a fermentation process and capable of producing desired a fermentation product. Especially suitable fermenting organisms are able to ferment, i.e., convert, sugars, such as glucose or maltose, directly or indirectly into the desired fermentation product. Examples of fermenting organisms include fungal organisms, such as yeast. Preferred yeast includes strains of Saocharomyces spp., in particular, Saccharomyces cerevisiae.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the fermenting organism, e.g. the yeast, may be transformed with the polypeptide of the first aspect and applied in a process comprising; a) contacting a starch substrate with a fermenting organism cell transformed to express a polypeptide comprising a first amino acid sequence having aipha-amylase activity and a second amino acid sequence comprising a carbohydrate-binding module; b) holding said starch substrate with said yeast for a time and at a temperature sufficient to achieve conversion of at least 90% w/w of said starch substrate into fermentable sugars; c) fermenting to produce a fermentation product, e.g., ethanoi, d) optionally recovering the fermentation product, e.g., ethanoi. The steps a, b, and c are performed separately or simultaneously. In a preferred embodiment the first amino acid sequence and/or second amino acid sequence of said polypeptide is derived from a bacterium.<br>
MATERIALS AND METHODS<br>
KNU amylolytic activity: The amyiolytic activity may be determined using potato starch as substrate. This method is based on the break-down of modified potato starch by the enzyme, and the reaction is followed by mixing samples of the starch/enzyme solution with an iodine solution. Initially, a blackish-blue colour is formed, but during the break-down of the starch the blue colour gets weaker and gradually turns into a reddish-brown, which is compared to a coloured glass standard.<br>
One Kilo Novo alfa Amylase Unit (KNU) is defined as the amount of enzyme which, under standard conditions (i.e. at 37°C+/- 0.05; 0.0003 M Ca2+; and pH 5.6) dextrinizes 5.26 g starch dry substance Merck Amylum solubile.

Example 1: Construction of hybrids between an endo-amylase and the CBM from AMY1048<br>
The amylase AMY1048 is a wild type Bacillus amylase made up of a catalytic fragment of 484 amino acid and in addition a CBM20 fragment of 101 aa. The DNA sequence coding the AMY1048 is included as SEQ ID NO:1 and the mature AMY1048 sequence is included as SEQ ID NO:2. In SEQ ID NO:1 the CBM is defined as amino acid residues 485 to 586 which correspond to nucleotides 1540-1845 in SEQ ID NO:2. The amylase including the CBM can be expressed from a construction similar to what have been described for other amylases i.e. e.g., inserted into a vector under the control of a constitutive active promoter and flanked by the signal sequence (SEQ ID NO:15) and the terminator sequence of BJicheniformis endo-amylase.<br>
Replacing the catalytic fragment of the AMY1048 endo-amylase with a catalytic domain of another endo-amylase, thus creating a hybrid of the CBM from AMY1048 and a new endo-amylase, is made by amplifying the DNA fragment coding the catalytic domain of the new amylase by PCR using two oligonucleotides. The sense oligonucleotide is in it's 5'end identical to the last 20 nucleotide of the DNA sequence coding for the signal sequence prior the AMY1048 mature sequence and further in it's 3'end is identical to the first 20<br><br>

flasks for 72 hours at and secreted into the supernatant. The presence of hybrid enzyme in<br>
the supernatant was demonstrated by SDS-PAGE.<br>
Example 2<br>
Construction of a hybrid amylase with carbohydrate binding domain.<br>
The catalytic fragment of the B.flavothermus endo-amyiase, AMY1048 can further be divided into the central AB-domain harboring the catalytic center and a C domain c-terminal to the catalytic domain but prior to the CBM. In SEQ ID NO:2 the catalytic core domain consist of the first 397 amino acid residues, the C domain is defined as the amino acid residues from 398 to 484 and the CBM is defined as amino acid residues 485 to 586. In SEQ ID NO:1 the signal sequence is encoded by nucleotide 1 to 87, the catalytic core domain is encoded by nucleotide 88-1278, the C domain is encoded by the nucleotides 1279-1539, and the CBM is encoded by nucleotide 1540-1845.<br>
The amylase including the CBM can be expressed from a vector construction similar to what have been described in WO0060060A2 in example 4 - i.e. the amylase gene is inserted into a vector under the control of a amylase promoter and flanked by the signal sequence and the terminator sequence of B.licheniformis endo-amyiase.<br>
As an alternative to harboring the gene on a plasmid, the cassette including the DNA sequence coding for the antibiotic marker, promoter, signal sequence, the mature protein and the terminator can be integrated into the genome of the B.subtilis by homologous in-vivo crossover, by flanked upstream and downstream genomic DNA with high similarity to a nonessential part of the B.subtilis DNA. Useful DNA regions could be the pectate lyase or the endo-amyiase loci. In this example the AMY1048 and the hybrid is inserted into the amylase<br><br>
icci in opposite direction relative to the original B.subtifis amylase.<br>
The catalytic core domain of the AMY1048 endo-amylase was replaced with a catalytic core domain of the Bacillus starothermophilus (BSG) endo-amylase, thus creating a hybrid of the C-domain and the CBM from AMY1048 and the catalytic core domain from the new endo-amylase.<br>
The DNA fragment coding the catalytic core of the B. stearothermophifus amylase (SEQ ID NO:36) was amplified by PCR using two oligonucleotides. The sense oligonucleotides were in it's 5'end identical to the, last 20 nucleotide of the DNA sequence (SEQ ID NO: 15) coding for the signal sequence prior the AMY1048 mature sequence (SEQ ID NO:1) and further in it's 3'end identical to the first 20 nucleotides of DNA sequence coding the mature part of the desire amylase DNA. The antisense oligonucleotides were in its 5'end identical to the antisense DNA of the first 20 nucleotide of the DNA sequence coding the C-domain from AMY1048 and further in its 3'end was identical to the antisense of the last 20 nucleotides of the DNA sequence coding the catalytic core of the BSG amylase DNA.<br>
To construct a hybrid of the B. stearothermophilus endo-amylase core domain and C-domain and the CBM20 from B.flavothermus amylase the following oligonucleotides were used by the present inventors:<br>
Sense: 5'-ctcattctqcagccqcqqcaqcaccqtttaacqqctttaa-3' (P7s SEQ ID NO:31).<br>
Antisence: 5'-atatagtcgtgctgtgttccgtaagcataatccctgcgcg-3' (P7as SEQ ID NO:32).<br>
To facilitate genome integration, a 5 kB fragment upstream from of the signal sequence and into the amylase genome sequence is made by PCR using the AMY1048 genomic construction as template, and the inverse primer of the antisense primer and the genome specific primer: 5'-ctgcatcagggctgcggcatcc -3; (P8 SEQ ID NO:33).<br>
Another fragment from the termination of the gene and upstream of the genomic B.subtiiis amylase is made by PCR using the AMY1048 genomic construction as template, and the inverse primer of the sense primer and the genome specific primer: 5'-ctgcatcagggctgcggcatcc-3'; (P9 SEQ ID NO:34).<br>
Taking advantages of the 40 bp overlap, the three PCR fragments were assembled by PCR and the resulting product amplified in another PCR using the genome specific primers, prior to transferring into Bacillus subtiiis strain SHA273 (described in W092/11357 and W095/10603).<br>

Example 3: Determination of Exo-Endo Improvement Factor (EIF)<br>
EIF is the measure of an increment of the exo/endo ratio relative to a parent enzyme i.e. EIF<br><br>
= (exo/endo of variant) / (exo/endo of parent enzyme). An enzyme has an increase in exo/endo ratio compared to its parent enzyme if EIF&gt;1. EiF may be based on one of the following methods.<br>
E1F1 Endo activity assay: The Phadebas Amylase Test (Pharmacia Diagnostics) is run according to the suppliers recommenda-tions and the endo units calculated from the supplied formula where the natural logarithm to the activ-ity equals N, where N = A + square root [B + C * ln(Abs)]. Abs is the absorbance at 620 nm, A = -13.3235, B = 243.3293. and C = 26.73797<br>
Exo activity assay: 50 microL of 50 mM sodium citrate, 5 mM CaCl2r pH 6.5 is mixed with 25 microL of enzyme in the same buffer and 25 microL Betamyi substrate (Betamyl Method, Megazyme) dissolved according to suppliers recommendations. The assay mix is incubated for 30 min. at 40°C and the reaction stopped by adding 150 microL 4% (w/w) Trizma base (Tris(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane). The activity is expressed directly as the absorbance at 420 nm measured using a microtiter plate reader.<br>
. EIF2 Endo activity assay: 1 mL resuspended Phadebas substrate (Pharmacia Diagnostics) (0.25 tablets/mL 50 mM so-dium acetate, 1 mM CaCI2, adjusted to pH 5.7) is incubated with 25 microL enzyme for 15 min at 40°C with agitation. The reaction is stopped by addition of 0.25 mL 1 M NaOH and the mix-ture is centrtfuged in a table centr'rfuge at 14,000 RPM. The absorbance of the supernatant at 620 nm is measured. The activity is determined by comparing to a standard with declared activity (BAN 480 L, 480 KNU/g)<br>
Exo activity assay: 900 microL 3.3 % solubilized waxy maize starch (3.3 % starch is boiled in 50 mM sodium acetate, 1 mM CaCI2, pH 5.7 for 5 min and cooled to 40°C) is incubated with 100 microL enzyme at 40°C with stirring. After appropriate reaction time the remaining starch is precipitated by addition of 450 microL 4°C 96 % ethanol. The precipitate is immediately removed by centrifugation at 3000 G for 20 min. The total carbohydrate in the supernatant is determined by mixing 200 microL supernatant with 50 microL 2 % tryptophan and 900 microL 64 % sulphuric acid. The mixture is heated for 15 min at 95CC and the absorbance at 530 nm is measured after cooling to room tem-perature. The activity is determined by comparing with the absorbance of glucose standards in the same assay. One unit is defined as the amount of enzyme that at initial rates liberates 1 mg oligomeric products (products that are not precipitated by ethanol) per min.<br>
Example 4: Liquefaction and saccharification with an endo-amylase with a CBM<br>
This example illustrates the conversion of granular wheat starch into glucose using a bacterial endo-amylase with a CBM (SEQ ID NO:4) or the same bacterial endo-amylase without CBM (SEQ ID NO:35) together with a glucoamylase and an acid fungal amylase. A slurry with 33% dry solids (DS) granular starch was prepared by adding 247.5 g of wheat starch under stirring to 502.5 ml of water. The pH was adjusted with HCI to 4.5. The granular<br><br>
starch slurry was distributed to 100 ml Erlenmeyer flasks with 75 g in each flask. The flasks were incubated with magnetic stirring in a 602C water bath. At zero hours the enzyme activities given in table 1 were dosed to the flasks. Samples were withdrawn after 24, 48 and 73 and 94 hours. The enzyme levels used were endo-amylase +/-CBM 100 KNU/kg DS, glucoamylase 200 AGU/kg DS, acid fungal aipha-amylase 50 AFAU/g DS<br>
Total dry solids starch was determined using the following method. The starch was completely hydroiyzed by adding an excess amount of endo-amyl&amp;se (300 KNU/Kg dry solids) and placing the sample in an oil bath at 95 °C for 45 minutes. Subsequently the samples were cooled to 60°C and an excess amount of glucoamylase (600 AGU/kg DS) was added followed by incubation for 2 hours at 60CC.<br>
Soluble dry solids in the starch hydrolysate were determined by refractive index measurement on samples after filtering through a 0.22 microM filter. The sugar profile was determined by HPLC. The amount of glucose was calculated as DX. The results are shown in table 2 and 3.<br><br>
Example 5: Effective dosage<br>
The "effective dosage" of the amylase in question is defined as the dosage resulting in a reduction in firmness of more than 10%, e.g., of between 10 and 20%, compared to the firmness of a bread without enzymes (the control). The reduction in firmness is measured after storage for 14 days in inert atmosphere at room temperature.<br>
Tolerance towards overdosing is measured by using the Elasticity Loss Ratio = ELR. ELR is measured day 1 after baking or later, such as day 5, day 10 or as in the example below after 14 days storage and is defined then as follows:<br>
ELR % = (ElasticitYnnntmi n*y iA - Elasticity,™^ riav -u x 100)/Elasticitycontroi day K<br><br>
in combination with 450 MANU/kg flour Novamyl© the tolerance towards overdosing is measured:<br>
ELRN % = (Elasticity Mayany! dav 14. ~ ElaSticitVN0v3mvt+ amylase dav 14  X 100)/ElasticityNDvamyj day 1*<br>
If the amylase is overdosed the ELR and/or ELRN will be &gt; 5%.<br>
