A grate within the base supports charcoal or similar fuels and a gas burner and electric heating element are also supported by the base for use in cooking. A container can be mounted within the base for holding food to be cooked.<br>
US patent 5,195,504 modifies the basic box cooker design with the judicious use of reflectors and the use of oil to reduce thermal losses. However this greatly increases the thermal capacity and weight of the cooker.<br>
US patent 5,139,010 uses reflectors with the objective of heating the dark bottom and back wall of the absorber where a heating element present maintains a constant temperature of the cooker.<br><br><br>
The panel cookers such as 'Cookit' from Solar Cookers International and the 'Hotpot' from Solar Household Energy use a semi concentrating arrangement for a pot type vessel. However they need glass vessel or consumable transparent bags for the greenhouse enclosure, else wind could have a substantial impact on cooking time. Another aspect of consideration is that some dishes need a more flat vessel for cooking compared to a pot.<br>
Thus the study of the related prior art reveals several technological gaps such as: <br>
s       Substantial thermal mass of cooking systems leading to prolonged timings for<br>
cooking, particularly in a box type cooker <br>
s       Use of fiber glass insulation <br>
S       Substantial temperature reductions in transferring heat from absorber to<br>
vessel <br>
S       Substantial convection losses from glazing <br>
s       Bulkiness and weight of these cookers pose limitations on the mobility and<br>
handling the same effectively in the sunlight. <br>
S       Considerable space requirement for concentrating cookers <br>
S       Tracking requirement on a continuous basis for concentrating cookers <br>
S       Substantial initial capital cost of the concentrating cookers. Adoption has been<br>
limited due to their initial capital cost, <br>
S       difficult to manufacture for unskilled labor, <br>
S       need continuous attention for tracking as well as likely to be unsafe due to the<br>
concentration of solar radiation<br>
Necessity has constantly been felt to develop a portable, compact, light weight, easily installable solar energy based heating / cooking device having substantially reduced thermal mass obviating the need for tracking mechanism / moving the device and separate absorber, yet effectively operable during early hours of the day when the sun's rays are slanted.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
