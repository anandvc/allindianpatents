				<td>System for forming and stacking raw calcium-silicate bricks<br>
1. Technical sphere<br>
The invention is related to construction materials production, calcium-silicate bricks<br>
production in particular.<br>
2. Preceding technical level<br>
The technology of raw calcium-silicate bricks heat treatment requires its block stowage<br>
(stacking) consisting of four walls one brick thick with an oval contour of the top part. It<br>
results in the top layers containing the amount of bricks that is decreasing while getting<br>
closer to the top of the stack. The specific amount of bricks in each layer is determined by the<br>
plan of stacking. The more the top part of the stack resembles an oval and the less it<br>
resembles a pyramid, the greater amount of bricks can be stowed in one stack. Unacceptable<br>
stack configuration causes a drastic decrease of the autoclave volume utilization coefficient.<br>
There is a system for forming and stacking raw calcium-silicate bricks that is well-<br>
known. It contains a press provided with a bed in which a multiple mould with cavities for<br>
bricks is arranged, a conveyor line, a steaming wagon, a puller transferring the bricks from<br>
the press to the conveyor and a stacking device transferring the bricks from the conveyor to<br>
the steaming wagon. The conveyor line is arranged perpendicularly to the bricks transport<br>
axis from the press. The cavities of the multiple mould are arranged in such a way that they<br>
form two parallel lines with 8 cavities in each, and these lines are perpendicular to the<br>
conveyor line. The longitudinal walls of the cavities in those lines are parallel to the<br>
conveyor line. The steaming wagon is arranged in such a way that it is movable along the<br>
conveyor. The puller and the stacking device are installed with a possibility of moving across<br>
the conveyor line (see booklet of the company "LASCO Umformtechnik GmbH Partner on<br>
the introduction of an efficient calcium-silicate brick production technology», 2001).<br>
Such an assembling of the system requires a simultaneous transportation by the puller<br>
of two lines of bricks with 8 pieces in each that are produced by the press. The bricks are<br>
transported by the puller through a window in the side-frame of the press onto the conveyor<br>
line that is perpendicular to the bricks transport axis from the press. During the recurring<br>
cycle of the press the puller transports two more lines with 8 bricks in each onto the conveyor<br>
line. Thus, a group of 4 lines with 8 bricks in each is formed on the conveyor. A stack with 4<br>
walls of one brick thick is formed from those groups on the steaming wagon with the help of<br>
the stacking device. As the length of one group (which is 8 bricks) is not sufficient for<br>
forming a full layer of a stack, it is formed from several groups (the lower part of the stack is<br>
formed from 2-3 groups, and the upper part is formed from 1-2 groups) in several trips of the<br>
stacking device.<br>
It is obvious that low productivity is a shortcoming of that system. It is conditioned by<br>
the fact that individual devices of the system during their working process manipulate a small<br>
amount of bricks simultaneously.<br>
There is a system for forming and stacking raw calcium-silicate bricks that is the<br>
closest in technical essence and achieved result, it was chosen as a prototype. That system<br>
comprises a press provided with a bed in which a multiple mould with cavities for bricks is<br>
arranged, a conveyor line disposed along a bricks transport axis from the press, a steaming<br>
wagon, a puller providing bricks transportation through a window in the face side of the press<br>
to the conveyor line, and a stacking device providing bricks transportation from the conveyor<br>
line to the steaming wagon. The mould cavities of the press bed are arranged in such a way<br>
that their longitudinal walls are parallel to the conveyor. The steaming wagon and the puller<br>
are arranged in such a way that they are movable along the conveyor, and the stacking device<br>
is installed with a possibility of moving across the conveyor line (see the book by L.M.<br>
Khavkin "Technology of silicate brick", Moscow, printed by "Stroiizdat", 1982, page 222,<br>
figure V - 1.25. The press of the company "Satcliff and Speakman" S-S 500).<br>
Such an assembling of the system requires transportation of the bricks produced by the<br>
press through the window in the face side of the press along the conveyor line. It changes the<br>
trajectory of bricks moving from the press to the steaming wagon. In this case, the puller<br>
moves along the conveyor line. However, such a big drawback of the assembling as forming<br>
a full layer from different groups on the steaming wagon is retained. It is explained by the<br>
fact that it is impossible to place the sufficient amount of bricks for forming a full layer<br>
across the conveyor line. Increasing the quantity of bricks in lines that are produced by the<br>
press at once causes increasing the group's length, which leads to forming big ledges in the<br>
stack contour. It does not allow to increase the system's productivity.<br>
*<br>
3. Invention revealing<br>
The primary goal of this invention is to increase the system's labour productivity by<br>
providing an opportunity of manipulating large groups of bricks.<br>
The said goal is achieved using a well-known system for forming, and stacking raw<br>
calcium-silicate bricks that comprises a press provided with a bed in which a multiple mould<br>
with cavities for bricks is arranged, a conveyor line disposed along a bricks transport axis<br>
from the press, a steaming wagon, a puller arranged in such a way that it is movable along<br>
the conveyor, providing bricks transportation from the press to the conveyor line, and a<br><br>
•stacking device providing bricks transportation from the conveyor line to the steaming<br>
wagon. According to this invention, the longitudinal walls of the multiple mould cavities<br>
and a path, on which a stacking device is installed with a possibility of moving, are arranged<br>
perpendicularly to the conveyor line, and the cavities of the multiple mould are arranged in<br>
four rows that are parallel to the conveyor line, each row comprising at least six cavities.<br>
Research work made with the help of patent and scientific-technical information<br>
showed that the presented system is unknown and does not come directly from the<br>
investigated technological level, i.e. it meets the criteria "novelty" and "inventive level".<br>
The system implementation in the presented way allows getting bricks from the press<br>
oriented concerning the conveyor line and the steaming wagon in such a way that at once the<br>
stacking device is able to take from the conveyor line and place onto the steaming wagon a<br>
group of bricks, the length of which is equal to the length of one layer on the steaming<br>
wagon. Under the condition of arranging the cavities in four rows, during one working cycle<br>
the press produces onto the conveyor the amount of bricks enough for forming four walls on<br>
the steaming wagon at once. An increase of the amount of cavities in one row allows<br>
collecting enough bricks for forming a full layer of the stack on the steaming wagon more<br>
quickly.<br>
Therefore, it is obvious that the suggested assembling of the system provides an<br>
increase of labour productivity.<br>
4. A brief description of the working drafts' figures<br>
The invention is explained by figures where the following is presented:<br>

stacking device's moving along the conveyor line is shown by dotted line)<br>

5. The best variant of the invention implementation<br>
The system for forming and stacking raw calcium-silicate bricks comprises a<br>
hydraulic press (1) provided with a bed in which a multiple mould (2) with cavities (3) for<br>
bricks (4) is arranged. A conveyor line (5) is situated along the brick transport axis (4) from<br>
the press (1). The system also contains a steaming wagon (6) placed on a track path (7), a<br>
puller (8) which is arranged in such a way that it is movable along the conveyor line (5) and<br>
transfers the bricks (4) from the press to the conveyor (5), and a stacking device (9)<br>
transferring the bricks (4) from the conveyor (5) to the steaming wagon (6). The longitudinal<br>
walls of the multiple mould (2) cavities (3) and a path (7), on which the movable steaming<br>
wagon (6) is disposed, are arranged in parallel to each other and perpendicularly with respect<br>
to the conveyor line (5). The stacking device (9) can be installed with a possibility of moving<br>
along and across the conveyor line (5) or with a possibility of moving only along the<br>
conveyor line (5). In the first case the steaming wagon (6) is placed at the side of the<br>
conveyor line (5), and in the second case the steaming wagon (6) is situated at the end of the<br>
conveyor line (5). The cavities (3) of the mould (2) are arranged in four rows which are<br>
parallel to the conveyor (5). Each row comprises six (or more) cavities (3). Compact<br><br>
arrangement of a large amount of mould cavities (3) in the press bed (1) is possible due to<br>
the cavities' (3) placement by their long side along the press bed (1) long side. Such a<br>
placement of the cavities (3) allows arranging four rows each containing 6-10 cavities (3),<br>
which provides production of 24-40 bricks (4) during one cycle of the press work.<br>
The system works as follows.<br>
The multiple mould of the press bed (1) is tilled with agglutinant sand with the help of<br>
'a mixture bunker moving back-and-forth above the multiple mould (the bunker is shown on<br>
the working draft). After the moulding cycle the press (1) ejects from the multiple mould (2)<br>
a group of bricks (4) arranged with their long sides along the press bed (1) longitude and<br>
perpendicular to the conveyor line (5). A group of bricks (4) comprises four rows, each of<br>
them contains 6-10 bricks. The puller (8) connected with the press (1) withdraws from the<br>
press bed (1) all the bricks (4) of the group at once, gripping them with claws by headers. It<br>
joins them while carrying and arranges them with equal space between each brick. Brick<br>
transport axis (4) by the puller (8) from the press (1) coincides with the longitudinal axis of<br>
the conveyor line (5). The bricks are placed on the conveyor line (5) by the puller (8) that<br>
fulfills the function of a storage device. The claws free the bricks (4), and the puller (8) goes<br>
back for the next cycle. When the puller (8) comes back to the press (1) for the next group of<br>
bricks (4), the conveyor line (5) moves by one step which is equal to the length of the group<br>
plus a little warranty gap. After 2-3 cycles the conveyor (5) stores the amount of brick lines<br>
enough for forming a full layer on the steaming wagon (6). Those lines, at the same time,<br>
contain four bricks (4), which allows forming four walls of a stack on the steaming wagon<br>
(6) at once. Due to the stacking device's (9) moving along the conveyor line (5) the device is<br>
installed in such a position that provides gripping of a full layer for the steaming wagon (6).<br>
Then, if the steaming wagon (6) is arranged at the side of the conveyor line (5), the stacking<br>
device (9) is moved across the conveyor line (5), and it places a full layer onto the steaming<br>
wagon (6). In case of the steaming wagon (6) arrangement at the end of the conveyor line (5),<br>
the stacking device (9) is moved only along the conveyor line (5) for transferring a full layer<br>
onto the steaming wagon (6). While the stacking device (9) is moving to the steaming wagon<br>
(6), a new group of bricks (4) is produced on the conveyor (5). The stacking device (9) picks<br>
the next layer for the steaming wagon (6) from that group. The amount of brick lines (4) in a<br>
group depends on the layer's position in the stack.<br>
Therefore, the presented system allows drastic increasing of the system's labour<br>
productivity and providing forming a stack with an oval shape of the top part. At the same<br>
time, the system provides forming a stack from complete layers which are quickly<br>
accumulated on the conveyor line due to a large amount of bricks produced by the press at<br>
once.<br>
6. Industry application<br>
The system can be manufactured at any factory specializing in such sphere, because<br>
well-known materials and standard equipment are needed for that, and can be widely used at<br>
the raw calcium-silicate brick production, as it is industrially applicable.<br>
I Claim:<br>
