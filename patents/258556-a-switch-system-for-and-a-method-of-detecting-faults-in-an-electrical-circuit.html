FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to vehicle diagnostic systems, and<br>
more particularly to a switch system for detecting faults in an electrical circuit.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
 Single throw switches can be used in vehicles to detect the<br>
presence of an input, such as fluid pressure. A simple switch includes two metal<br>
contacts that selectively connect to conduct current and complete a circuit.<br>
Although metal contacts are an acceptable means of conducting current flow, the<br>
contacts can form insulating oxides that corrode the metal and prevent the circuit<br>
from working properly.<br>
 Single throw switches operate in two modes, or positions. A<br>
first position separates the two contacts to provide an open circuit. A second<br>
position connects the contacts to complete the circuit (i.e. close the circuit) and to<br>
provide a current path. Accordingly, single throw switches are convenient for<br>
switching power to a circuit. However, further applications are limited.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, the present invention provides a switch for<br>
detecting an input. The switch includes a switch housing and a magnet that is<br>
mounted inside the switch housing and that generates a magnetic field having<br><br>
magnetic flux. The switch further includes a flux concentration device that is<br>
located inside the switch housing and that selectively moves between first and<br>
second positions. Furthermore, an actuator assembly is located inside the switch<br>
housing that receives an input and that selects the first and second positions<br>
based on the input. The switch further includes a hall-effect device that is<br>
located between the magnet and the flux concentration device. The hall-effect<br>
device conducts a current having a first value when the magnetic flux is less than<br>
a predetermined magnetic flux threshold and that conducts the current having a<br>
second current value when the magnetic flux exceeds the predetermined<br>
magnetic flux threshold. The first position communicates a first magnetic flux to<br>
the hall-effect device and the second position communicates a second magnetic<br>
flux that is different from the first magnetic flux to the hall-effect device.<br>
 In other features, the switch further includes a metal plate<br>
mounted on the inner base of the switch housing. The switch includes a first<br>
terminal that has one end that communicates with one side of the hall-effect<br>
device and that has an opposite end that communicates with the metal plate.<br>
The switch includes a second terminal that has one end that communicates with<br>
a side of the hall-effect device opposite of the first terminal and that has an<br>
opposite end that extends through the switch housing and outside the switch.<br>
 In still other features, the switch of claim 1 further includes an<br>
inlet. The switch includes a fluid sealing device fixed to the inlet and a chamber<br>
located inside the switch housing that is adapted to hold fluid. The inlet directs<br>
the fluid to the chamber.<br><br>
 In yet other features, the switch includes a pressure detection<br>
device adapted to detect a fluid pressure and a linking rod having one end that is<br>
coupled to the pressure detection device and having an opposite end that is<br>
coupled to the flux concentration device.<br>
 In another feature, the pressure detection device is a<br>
deformable membrane that receives a fluid and deforms based on a fluid<br>
pressure caused by the fluid. The fluid pressure causes deformation of the<br>
membrane and moves the flux concentration device toward the hall-effect device. In another feature, the flux concentration device is coupled to<br>
the base inside the switch housing using springs. When the fluid is not received,<br>
the springs position the flux concentration device a first distance away from the<br>
hall-effect device. When the fluid is received, the springs compress and position<br>
the flux concentration device a second distance away from the hall-effect device.<br>
 In still another feature, the second distance is less than the first<br>
distance.<br>
 In yet another feature, the second magnetic flux has a higher<br>
strength then the first magnetic flux.<br>
 In still another feature, the magnetic flux threshold includes an<br>
upper magnetic flux value and a lower magnetic flux value.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS The present invention will become more fully understood<br>
from the detailed description and the accompanying drawings, wherein:<br><br>
figures 1A and 1B are cross-sectional functional block<br>
diagrams of a hall-effect switch according to the principles of the present<br>
invention; and<br>
 Figure 2 is a flow chart illustrating steps executed by a hall-<br>
effect switch coupled with a circuit according to the principles of the present<br>
invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The following description of the preferred embodiment is merely<br>
exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its<br>
application, or uses. For purposes of clarity, the same reference numbers will be<br>
used in the drawings to identify similar elements.<br>
 Referring now to Figures 1A and 1B, an exemplary hall-effect<br>
switch 10 adapted to detect fluid pressure is shown. The hall-effect switch 10<br>
includes an outer housing 12 having a top 14 and a pressure chamber 16 within<br>
the housing that holds fluid 18. The top couples to a fluid pressure source (not<br>
shown) and functions as an inlet to direct fluid 18 to the pressure chamber 16. A<br>
sealing device 20 is attached to the housing 12 and surrounds the top 14 to<br>
prevent fluid 18 from escaping the switch 10. A metal plate 21 is disposed on the<br>
inner base of the housing. A mounting fixture 22 can be coupled to one side of<br>
the switch where it couples to the metal plate 21. When the mounting fixture 22<br>
contacts a ground source (not shown), the metal plate become grounded,<br>
thereby providing a ground point inside the switch 10.<br><br>
 A switch assembly 24 is located within the housing 12. The<br>
switch assembly 24 includes a magnet 26, a flux concentration device 28 and a<br>
hall-effect device 30. The magnet 26 is fixed to the metal plate 21 and generates<br>
a magnetic field (not shown) having magnetic flux (not shown). Although the<br>
magnet is shown to be directly mounted to the metal plate 21, the magnet can be<br>
mounted to the base of the housing 12. The flux concentration device is located<br>
above the magnet 26 and is coupled to the base of the housing 12 using springs<br>
32. The flux concentration device 28 provides a lower resistance path for the<br>
magnetic flux. The strength of the magnetic flux can be adjusted by adjusting the<br>
position of the flux concentration device 28. For example, the strength of the<br>
magnetic flux increases as the flux concentration device 28 moves closer to the<br>
magnet 26. The flux concentration device 28 can include a plate made of<br>
ferromagnetic material, or another material capable of amplifying magnetic flux.<br>
 The hall-effect device 30 is located between the magnet 26 and<br>
the flux concentration device 28. One end of the hall-effect device 30<br>
communicates with the metal plate 21 using a first lead 33. The opposite end<br>
communicates with a terminal 34 using a second lead 35. The terminal 34<br>
extends through the housing 12 and outside of the switch 10.<br>
 A voltage potential is created across the hall-effect device 30<br>
and a constant biased current flows therein when the metal plate 21<br>
communicates with a ground source (not shown) and the terminal 34<br>
communicates with a voltage source (not shown). Further, placing the hall-effect<br>
device 30 in a magnetic field where magnetic flux is received at approximately<br><br>
90° to the current flow creates a voltage output that is directly proportional to the<br>
strength of the magnetic flux. Accordingly, the hall-effect device 30 can include<br>
a magnetic flux threshold. When the magnetic flux is below the threshold, the<br>
hall-effect device 30 can output a current having a first value. When the<br>
magnetic flux exceeds the threshold, the hall-effect device can output a current<br>
having a second value.<br>
 A deformable membrane 36 is centered in the pressure<br>
chamber 16 and above the flux concentration device 28. The sides of the<br>
membrane 36 are coupled to the inside walls of the housing 12. The bottom of<br>
the membrane 36 is coupled to one end of a linking rod 38. The opposite end of<br>
the linking rod 38 is coupled to the flux concentration device 28.<br>
 The switch 10 operates in first and second modes based on the<br>
position of the membrane 36. A first mode (LO) can exist when the pressure<br>
chamber 16 contains no fluid 18 and the membrane 36 flexes away from the hall-<br>
effect device 30. When the membrane 36 flexes away from the hall-effect device<br>
30, the springs 32 are decompressed, thereby holding the flux concentration<br>
device 28 in a first position. When the switch 10 is connected to a circuit while in<br>
the first position, the flux concentration device 28 delivers a weak magnetic flux<br>
to the hall-effect device 30. As a result, the hall-effect device 30 conducts a<br>
current in the range of 2mA-5mA.<br>
 A second mode can exist when fluid 18 is delivered to the<br>
pressure chamber 16. As fluid 18 fills the pressure chamber 16, fluid pressure<br>
created by the fluid 18 forces the membrane 36 toward the hall-effect device 30.<br><br>
The. linking rod 38 moves the flux concentrator device 28 toward the hall-effect<br>
device 30 and into the second position. The second position places the flux<br>
concentration device 28 a short distance away from the hall-effect device 30,<br>
thereby delivering a high strength magnetic flux. Accordingly, the hall-effect<br>
device 30 conducts a current in the range of 12mA-17mA. Although the hall-<br>
effect conducts current in the ranges of 2mA-5mA and 12mA-17mA, it is<br>
appreciated that another hall-effect that can conduct different current ranges may<br>
be used.<br>
 By using a hall-effect device to conduct current problems<br>
caused by corroding metal contacts are reduced. Furthermore, the ability to<br>
conduct two different current strengths allows the switch to be used in a wide<br>
variety of applications.<br>
	Referring now to Figure 2, a flowchart illustrates steps<br>
executed by a hall-effect switch that is coupled to a circuit according to the<br>
principles of the present invention. In step 200, control determines whether the<br>
switch has received fluid. When the switch has received fluid, control proceeds<br>
to step 204. Otherwise control proceeds to step 202. In step 202, control retains<br>
a flux concentration device 28 in a first position and selects a LO mode. Control<br>
conducts a low current in step 206 and control ends.<br>
 In step 204, control flexes the membrane toward the hall-effect<br>
device. In step 208, control moves the flux concentration device to a second<br>
position and selects a HIGH mode. Control conducts a high current in step 210<br>
and control ends.<br><br>
Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the foregoing<br>
description that the broad teachings of the present invention can be implemented<br>
in a variety of forms. Therefore, while this invention has been described in<br>
connection with particular examples thereof, the true scope of the invention<br>
should not be so limited since other modifications will become apparent to the<br>
skilled practitioner upon a study of the drawings, the specification and the<br>
