				<td>The present invention relates to an apparatus for decelerating a hot roiled product and has been divided out of Indian patent application number 828/DEL/2004.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.  Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates in general to continuous rolling mills producing hot roiled long products .such as bars, rods and the like, and is concerned in particular with a method and apparatus for decelerating and temporarily accumulating such products at a selected stage in the hot roiling process.<br>
2.  Description of the Prior Art<br>
in  the typical  rolling mill installation,  billets   are  heated  to  an  elevated   rolling<br>
temperature in a furnace.    The heated billets are then subjected to continuous rolling in<br>
successive roughing, intermediate and finishing sections of the mill, with each mill section<br>
being comprised of multiple roll stands.   For larger products, the entire mill can usually be<br>
operated at or close to the maximum capacity of the furnace.    However, when the rolling<br>
schedule calls for smaller products, the capacity of the finishing section is often reduced to<br>
well below that of the furnace and the roughing and intermediate mill sections.   Under these<br>
circumstances, the roughing and intermediate sections can be slowed to match the capacity of<br>
the finishing, section, but there are limits beyond which this becomes impractical.    This is<br>
because acceptable rolling procedure dictates that the heated billets should be introduced into<br><br><br>
the first stand of the roughing section at a minimum take in speed of not lower than about 0.09-0.1 m/s.  Slower take in speeds will likely cause fire cracking of the work rolls.<br>
in other cases, for example, when rolling high speed tool steels or nickel based alloys, a higher take in speed is required to avoid excess cooling of the billet, while lower finishing speeds are required to avoid excessive heat generation, which can cause core melting and surface cracking of the product.<br>
In an exemplary modern day continuous rolling operation, with a furnace capacity of 100-150 tons/In or greater, a nominal carbon low alloy steel billet with a 150mm square cross section and a length of 11.7m is rolled into a 2000kg. coil. When rolling 5.5mm diameter rod at the mill's maximum delivery speed of, say, 105m/s, the take in speed is 0.111m/sec, which is safely above the acceptable minimum speed. Under these conditions, the mill can produce . 64.42 tons/hr (taking into consideration gap and yield). However, if the rolling schedule calls for a 3,5mm diameter rod, the take in speed for the same size billet at the same maximum delivery speed would have to be lowered to an unacceptably low level of 0.045m/s, with a corresponding reduction in the mill's tonnage rate to 26.8 tons/hr.<br>
Alternatively, in order to overcome the unacceptably low take in speed, a smaller billet of the same length with, for example, a 106mm square cross section could be rolled at the maximum delivery speed of 105m/s and at a safe take in speed of 0.09m/s. However, this would require a new pass design for the roll stands, different guides, a lowering of the coil weight of the finished product to 1031kg, and a reduced production rate of 26.31 tons/hr, again raking into consideration gap and yield. The necessity to store different size billets would create further problems.<br><br><br>
There exists a need, therefore, for a method and apparatus that will make it possible to roll smaller size products while maintaining the mill take in speeds at or above acceptable minimums, without having to reduce the size of the billets being processed, aud preferably while continuing to roll at the mill's maximum tonnage rate.<br>
One prior attempt at achieving this objective is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,486,359 (Hcin), where a laying head temporarily accumulates hot rolled products exiting from the intermediate mill section on a storage reel. The accumulated product is then unwound from the storage reel at a reduced speed for continued rolling in a mill finishing section. A number of drawbacks are associated with the Hein approach. For example, the product is not decelerated prior to being wound onto the storage reel. This, coupled with a lack of control over how the windings are distributed along the reel surfaces, can cause the windings to overlap one another, and this in turn can disrupt the unwinding process.<br>
Also, with the Hein arrangement, the laying head cannot be operated continuously, but. instead must be brought to a complete stop at the beginning of each storage cycle so that the product front end can be directed past the storage reel to a downstream stationary pinch roll unit. Thus, during the time required to overcome system inertia and to bring the laying head back up TO its operating speed, an unsteady state exists, which can further disrupt the pattern of windings on the storage reel.<br>
The present invention provides an improved method and apparatus for decelerating and temporarily accumulating hot rolled products that differ from the Hein approach in important respects that eliminate the above described drawbacks.<br><br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the present invention, a method and apparatus are provided for decelerating and temporarily accumulating a hot rolled product moving longitudinally along a receiving axis at a first velocity V1. The apparatus includes a laying assembly having an entry end aligned with the receiving axis to receive the product. The laying assembly has a curved intermediate section leading to an exit end that is spaced radially from the receiving axis and that is oriented to deliver the product in an exit direction transverse to the receiving axis. The curvature of the laying assembly and the orientation of its exit end is such that the exiting product is formed into a helix. The helix is received and temporarily accumulated on a cylindrical drum arranged coaxially with the receiving axis. The drum is rotated continuously about the receiving axis in a direction opposite to the direction of rotation of the laying assembly and at a speed selected to unwind the accumulating helix at the velocity V3 . The unwinding product is directed away from the drum by a catcher that is shiftable in a direction parallel to the receiving axis. During the time "T" required to roll a complete billet, a product length "L" equal to T x V2 is temporarily accumulated on the drum.<br>
The present invention relates to Apparatus for decelerating a hot rolled product moving longitudinally along an axis (A) at a first velocity V1, said apparatus comprising: a first guide (26,28) having an entry end (26a) aligned with said axis to receive said product, and having an exit end (28b) spaced radially from said axis; a cylindrical drum (30) rotatable about said axis (A); a first drive means (12,20,22,24) for rotating said first guide about said axis to temporarily accumulate said product as a helix on said drum; a second drive means (32,34,36,38,40) for rotating of said drum in a direction opposite to the direction of rotation of said first guide and at a speed such that said product is unwound from said drum; and a second guide (42) for receiving the product being unwound from said drum; characterized in that said first guide has a curved intermediate section (26b) with said exit end (28b) oriented to deliver said product in an exit direction (B) transverse to said axis (A) and in the form of said helix, and said first guide is rotated continuously in a direction opposite to said exit direction at a velocity (V2), thereby decelerating the product being delivered from said exit end to a reduced velocity V3 equal to V1 -V2.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the invention will now be described in greater detail with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein:<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Referring initially to Figures 1-5, an apparatus in accordance with the present invention is generally depicted at 10 as, comprising a laying head drive shaft 12 supported between bearings 14, 16.for rotation about a receiving axis A along which hot rolled product is received at a first velocity V1. One end of the drive shaft is coupled as at 18 to the output shaft 20 of a gear box 22, which, in turn is driven by a motor 24.<br>
The opposite end of the drive shaft is configured and arranged to support a curved laying assembly 25 comprising a laying pipe 26 and a helical trough extension 28.<br>
As can best be seen in Figure 6, the laying pipe has an entry end 26a aligned with the axis A to receive the hot rolled product, and a curved intermediate section 26b leading to an exit end 26c communicating with the entry end 28a of the helical trough 28.   The exit end 28b<br><br><br>
of the trough is spaced radially from the axis A and oriented to deliver the product in an exit direction along an axis B' transverse to the axis A.<br>
A cylindrical drum 30 is carried by and freely rotatable on the drive shaft 12. One end of the drum is partially overlapped by the exit end 26c of the laying pipe 26 and the helical trough 28. A driven sprocket 32 on the opposite end of the drum is mechanically coupled by a drive chain 34 to a drive sprocket 36 on the output shaft 38 of a second motor 40.<br>
The guide trough 28 rotates with the laying pipe 26 and coacts with the drum surface to provide an extension, of the guide path defined by the laying pipe. This extension is sufficient to -insure that the exiting product is formed into a helical formation of rings.<br>
As can best be seen by further reference to Figures 6 and 7, the exit end of the guide trough 28b terminates at a plane P perpendicular to the axis A. At the commencement of a deceleration cycle, the product front end is delivered from the trough 28 into a catcher 42. The curvature of the rotating laying pipe 26 and trough 28 coupled with the orientation of the delivery end 28b of the trough results in the product being delivered in the form of a helix H (see Figure 5). The rings of the helix have a diameter slightly larger than the outside diameter of the drum 30, thus enabling the helix to advance along the drum axis.<br>
With reference additionally to Figure 8, it will be seen that motor 24 operates to rotate the laying assembly 25 in a direction opposite to the exit direction of the product at circumferential velocity V2 that is less than V1. This results in a deceleration of the exiting product to a velocity V, equal to V1-V2.<br>
Motor 40 operates to rotate the drum 30 in a direction opposite to the direction of rotation of the laying assembly 25 and at a speed such that its peripheral velocity is V3, resulting in the product being unwound from the drum into the catcher 42 at velocity V3<br><br>
The catcher 42 is carried on a carriage 44 movable along rails 46 parallel, to the axis A. Carriage 44 is threadedly engaged by a screw shaft 48 driven by a motor 50. A pinch roll unit 52 having pinch rolls 52a driven by a motor 54 is also mounted on the carriage 44. The catcher 42 is arranged to direct the product being delivered .from the exit end 28b of the trough 28 to the pinch roll unit 52, which operates to propel the product to downstream equipment, e.g., the roll stands of a mill finishing section.<br>
Motor 50 is controlled to maintain the catcher 42 in alignment with the product being unwound from the helix H temporarily accumulating on drum 30. Thus, during an initial stage of the unwinding cycle, motor 50 will operate to traverse the carriage away from .the trough 28. and during the final stage of the unwinding cycle, motor 50 will reverse to traverse the carriage back towards the trough.<br>
With reference to Figure 9, the apparatus 10 is shown positioned between a rolling mill intermediate section 56 and a finishing block 58 comprising the mill finishing section. A velocity gauge 60 measures the velocity of the product exiting from the intermediate mill section 56, and a hot metal detector 62 detects the arrival of a product front end. The distance S1 between the hot metal detector 62 and the entry end- f the laying pipe 26 is known, as is the length S2 of the laying pipe and associated trough 28 making up the laying assembly 25. An encoder 64 associated with motor 24 provides a means of determining the exact angular position of the exit end 28b of the trough 28 at any given instant.-<br>
An exemplary control diagram is illustrated in Figure 10. A controller 66 receives signals from the velocity gauge 60 and hot metal detector 62 indicative respectively of the velocity V, of the product and the presence of a product front end.  Based on this data, and the<br><br>
known fixed distances S1 and S2, the controller calculates and predicts the exact time of arrival T.. of the product front end at the exit end 28b the trough 28.<br>
The signal from encoder 64 enables the controller to predict where the exit end of the trough will be at time Ta and to make adjustments to the speed of motor 24 to insure that the delivery end of the trough is properly located with respect to the catcher at time Ta. At time. Ta the product front end is delivered from the exit end 28b of the trough into, the catcher 42, and the controller signals motor 50 to begin traversing the carriage 44 along rails 46 to maintain the catcher in alignment with the product being unwound from accumulating helix H on dram 30.<br>
it will be seen, therefore, that with the present invention, rotation of the laying assembly effects a deceleration of the product from velocity V1 to velocity V3 while simultaneously forming the product length resulting from the velocity differential between V1 and V, into an ordered helical formation.  The laying assembly is rotated continuously, with only minor speed adjustments to insure proper positioning of the trough delivery end 28b with reference to the catcher 42 at time Ta when a product front end emerges from, the trough delivery end 28b.<br>
A second pinch roll unit 52 is advantageously employed in advance of the apparatus to continue propelling the product forward at the velocity V, after the product tail end drops out of the upstream roll stands of the intermediate mill.<br>
The receiving end of the drum 30 may advantageously be provided with a short helical track to assist in achieving an ordered spacing between the successive rings of the accumulating helix, and the laying pipe 26 and helical trough extension 28 may be rollerized to minimize frictional resistance.<br>
As shown in Figure 9. die apparatus 10 may be employed in a single strand mode between an intermediate null section 56 and a frrnshing section 58, the main advantage here being the ability to roll smaller diameter products at velocity V3 in the finishing section 58-while allowing the preceding mill sections to roll at the higher speed V,.<br>
Thus, for example, the previously described billet with a 150mm cross section, and a length of 11.7m could be rolled on a continuous mill at a higher and safe take in speed on the order of 0.09m/s to produce 3.5mm diameter rod at a finishing speed of 105m/s.  This avoids any need to change the pass design and guides, allows heavier coils to be produced, and eliminates billet inventory problems.<br>
Advantageously, a second decelerate! 10' and an additional finishing section 58' can be employed alternatively by means of a switch 68.  By employing multiple decelerators 10, 10' and finishing sections 58, 58' to alternatively process successive billet lengths, the entire mill can be operated continuously at the higher delivery velocity V,, resulting in a substantial increase in the rolling capacity of the mill.   Thus, for example, with an additional decelerator 10' and finishing mill 58' as shown in Figure 9, a mill rolling billets having 150mrn cross sections and lengths of 11.7m into 5.5mm diameter rods at a delivery speed of 105m/sec can achieve  a tonnage rate approximating mat of the furnace output, e.g., 128 tons/hr.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
