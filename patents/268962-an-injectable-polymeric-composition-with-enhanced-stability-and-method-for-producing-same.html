				<td>Pharmaceutical Compositions with Enhanced<br>
Stability<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] In recent years, a large number and variety of<br>
peptide agents such as peptides, oligopeptides,<br>
polypeptides, and proteins have been discovered and have<br>
received much attention as drug candidates. However,<br>
many peptide agents are not stable as they are easily<br>
hydrolyzed or degraded in vivo by enzymes resulting in a<br>
very short circulation half-life. Therefore, most of<br>
peptide medicines have been administered by injection,<br>
typically multiple times per day.<br>
[0002] Injection administration, however, is<br>
painful, very costly, and inconvenient. Often, the<br>
patient compliance is very challenging. For many<br>
peptide agents, particularly hormones, it requires the<br>
drug to be delivered continuously at a controlled rate<br>
over a long period of time, and thus a controlled<br>
release delivery system is desirable. Such systems may<br>
be provided by incorporating the peptide agents in<br>
biodegradable and biocompatible polymer matrices. In<br>
one approach the polymer is dissolved in an organic<br>
solvent and then mixed with the peptide agents that is<br>
fabricated into the forms of microcapsules,<br>
microgranules or implantable rods by removing the<br>
organic solvent. The peptide agent is entrapped within<br>
the polymer matrices. Several products have been<br>
successfully developed by using biodegradable polymers<br>
in the forms of microparticles and solid rod implants,<br>
such as Lupron, Zoladex, Triptorelin, etc. Although<br>
these products appear to be effective, but they have<br><br>
drawbacks and limitations, such as the large volume of<br>
suspending fluids for microparticles or surgical<br>
insertion of solid implants. These products are not very<br>
patient friendly. In addition, the manufacturing<br>
processes for producing sterile and reproducible<br>
products are complicated, resulting in high cost of<br>
manufacturing. It is highly desirable that a composition<br>
can be manufactured and used easily.<br>
[0003] In another approach, the biodegradable polymer<br>
and the peptide agents are dissolved in a biocompatible<br>
organic solvent to provide a liquid composition. When<br>
the liquid composition is injected into the body, the<br>
solvent dissipates into the surrounding aqueous<br>
environment, and the polymer forms a solid or gel depot<br>
from which the bioactive agent is released over a long<br>
period of time. The following references U.S. Pat. Nos.<br>

and 4,938,763 are believed to be representative in this<br>
area and are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Notwithstanding some success, those methods have not<br>
been entirely satisfactory for a large number of peptide<br>
agents that may be effectively delivered by such an<br>
approach.<br>
[0004] It is well recognized in the art that<br>
bioactive agent containing basic functional groups<br>
interacts with biodegradable polymer to catalyze (or<br>
expedite) the degradation of the polymer and form<br>
conjugate with the polymer and/or its degradation<br><br>
products. The interaction/reaction between the basic<br>
bioactive agents and polymer carriers may occur: 1)<br>
during formulation when the basic bioactive agents are<br>
incorporated in the polymer carrier, such as<br>
microencapsulation, injection molding, extrusion<br>
molding, mixing with polymer solutions in organic<br>
solvent, and the like; 2) during storage and 3) during<br>
the process of biodegradation and the release of<br>
bioactive agents in vivo.<br>
[0005] It is known that the degradation of peptide<br>
agents and biodegradable polymers, and reactions between<br>
the two typically occur much faster in solution than in<br>
a dry, solid state. The interaction/reaction between<br>
bioactive agents containing basic functional groups,<br>
i.e., amines, and polymers during the microparticle<br>
formation process using solvent evaporation/extraction<br>
methods where the bioactive agent and polymer were<br>
dissolved/dispersed in non-polar organic solvents were<br>
disclosed [ Krishnan M. and Flanagan DR., J Control<br>
Release. 2000 Nov 3; 69(2): 273-81] . Significant amount<br>
of amide moieties were formed. It was clearly shown<br>
that commonly used solvents for fabrication of<br>
biodegradable polymer drug delivery systems could permit<br>
rapid reaction between bioactive agent and polymer. In<br>
another disclosure, the accelerated degradation of<br>
polymers by organic amines in polar protic organic<br>
solvent (e.g., methanol) was also reported [Lin WJ,<br>
Flanagan DR, Linhardt RJ. Pharm Res. 1994<br>
Jul;ll (7) : 1030-4 ] .<br>
[0006] Since the controlled release delivery system<br>
is commonly fabricated through a step that involves<br>
dissolving/dispersing peptide agent into biodegradable<br><br>
polymer solution in an organic solvent, the<br>
stabilization of All the components in the composition<br>
at this step represents a very significant formulation<br>
challenge. One common approach that has been used to<br>
overcome the challenge of manufacturing and storage<br>
stability of peptide agent and biodegradable polymer in<br>
solution or suspension is to keep the peptide agent and<br>
the polymer solution in two separate containers and mix<br>
them just before use. This assumes that the organic<br>
solvent may be separated from polymeric matrix quickly<br>
through diffusion, extraction or evaporation after the<br>
peptide agents and polymer solution are mixed. An<br>
example was disclosed in US patent 6,565,874 and<br>
6,773,714 that describe polymeric delivery formulations<br>
of leuprolide acetate that is related to a commercial<br>
product Eligard® for treatment of prostate cancer. In<br>
order to maintain the stability of the formulations,<br>
this product is supplied in separate syringes and the<br>
contents in the syringes are mixed just before use.<br>
However, because of the viscous nature of the polymer<br>
formulations, it is often difficult to mix the contents<br>
in two separated syringes by end users. The uniformity<br>
of the formulations prepared by the end-user may vary<br>
significantly where contamination may Also occur and the<br>
quality of the treatment can be compromised<br>
significantly. In addition, this approach will not<br>
prevent the interaction between the peptide agent and<br>
polymer during mixing and administration. As disclosed<br>
in US20060034923 A1, when octreotide acetate was<br>
combined with polylactide-co-glicolide solution in NMP,<br>
more than 40% of octreotide was acylated within 5 hours.<br>
This modification of the peptide may lead to a<br><br><br><br>
significant loss of activity or change of<br>
immunogenicity. The molecular weight of the polymer<br>
Also decreased significantly within the same time<br>
period. This fast degradation of the peptide and polymer<br>
will Alter the release profile of the peptide and result<br>
in a compromised treatment outcome. Therefore, precise<br>
control for the preparation process and time is critical<br>
and this significantly increases the difficulty for end-<br>
user. Furthermore, the in vivo formation of the implant<br>
from the injectable polymeric composition is not<br>
instantaneous. Typically the solvent dissipation process<br>
can take a few hours to several days depending upon the<br>
solvents used. During this period, the presence of an<br>
organic solvent could Also promote the<br>
interaction/reaction between the peptide agents and the<br>
polymer. Therefore, there is a need to develop a<br>
pharmaceutical composition that will minimize or prevent<br>
the interaction/reaction between the peptide agent and<br>
the polymer in an organic solution. There is a further<br>
need to develop a pharmaceutical composition that is<br>
stable with a satisfactory storage shelf life in a<br>
ready-to-use product configuration.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007] It was surprisingly discovered that injectable<br>
biodegradable polymeric compositions comprising peptide<br>
agents in the form of a salt formed with a strong acid<br>
(e.g., hydrochloric acid) exhibit much higher stability<br>
than those in the form of a salt formed with a weak acid<br>
(e.g., acetic acid) or in the form of the free base.<br>
Such beneficial salts of peptide agents may be formed<br>
through the neutralization of any basic groups of the<br><br>
peptide agents with a strong acid. When such beneficial<br>
salts of peptide agents formed with a strong acid were<br>
formulated into injectable biodegradable polymeric<br>
compositions, the interactions/reactions between the<br>
peptide agents and the polymer are minimized or<br>
prevented. Using such beneficial salts of peptide<br>
agents formed with a strong acid Allows for the<br>
preparation of a stabilized injectable composition pre-<br>
filled in a single syringe in a ready-to-use<br>
configuration with satisfactory storage stability. The<br>
use of the salt of peptide agent formed with a strong<br>
acid of the present invention to enhance the stability<br>
of the injectable polymeric compositions is not<br>
contemplated by the prior art.<br>
[0008] Accordingly, the present invention provides<br>
a stabilized injectable biodegradable polymeric<br>
composition for forming an economical, practical, and<br>
efficient controlled release delivery system for peptide<br>
agents. The present invention Also provides a method of<br>
manufacturing and a method of use thereof. According to<br>
the present invention, the drug delivery system is<br>
produced easily and delivered conveniently to a subject<br>
such as a mammal or human. The compositions deliver<br>
therapeutic amount of peptide agents over a desired,<br>
extended period of time, preferably from several weeks<br>
to one year. The compositions are both biocompatible<br>
and biodegradable, and disappear harmlessly after<br>
delivering the dose of the peptide agents.<br>
[0009] The compositions in accordance with the<br>
present invention comprise a) a beneficial salt of a<br>
peptide agent formed with a strong acid that minimizes<br>
or prevents the interaction/reaction between the peptide<br><br>
agent and the polymer in an organic solution; b) a<br>
biodegradable polymer; c) a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
organic solvent. According to the invention, the<br>
pharmaceutical composition may optionally include<br>
excipients to achieve optimal delivery of the peptide<br>
agent. The pharmaceutical composition may be a viscous<br>
or non-viscous liquid, gel or semisolid that moves as a<br>
fluid so that it may be injected using a syringe. The<br>
pharmaceutical composition may be pre-filled into one<br>
syringe to form a product in a ready-to-use<br>
configuration.<br>
[0010] The peptide agent of the present invention<br>
contains at least one basic group. The peptide agent<br>
may be any peptide, oligopeptide, polypeptide, or<br>
protein that is capable of providing a biological,<br>
physiological or therapeutic effect in an animal or<br>
human. The peptide agent may be any one or more of known<br>
biologically active peptide, oligopeptide, polypeptide,<br>
or protein recognized in any documents cited herein or<br>
otherwise recognized in the art. The peptide agent may<br>
Also stimulate or inhibit a desired biological or<br>
physiological activity within the animal or human,<br>
including without limitation, stimulate an immunogenic<br>
or immunological response.<br>
[0011] According to one embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the peptide agent has an N-terminus that is<br>
not a primary amine (e.g., LHRH agonists, such as<br>
leuprorelin, goserelin, LHRH antagonists, such as<br>
cetrorelix, enfuvirtide, thymosin α1, abarelix, and the<br>
like) . In another embodiment of the present invention,<br>
the peptide agent has either an N-terminal primary amine<br>
or side chain primary amine group covalently modified<br><br>
with hydrophilic and/or lipophilic moieties that may be<br>
produced through pegylation, acylation, and the like.<br>
Furthermore, both N-terminal primary amine and side<br>
chain primary amine groups of the peptide agent may Also<br>
be covalently modified simultaneously with hydrophilic<br>
and/or lipophilic moieties through pegylation,<br>
acylation, and the like.<br>
[0012] The strong acid may be any acid having a pKa<br>
in water less than 3, preferably less than 0, more<br>
preferably less than -3. For example, a strong acid may<br>
be selected from, but not limited to, the group<br>
consisting of hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid,<br>
sulfuric acid, organic sulfuric acids, Alkyl sulfuric<br>
acids of 1-40 carbons, nitric acid, chromic acid,<br>
methanesulfonic acid, trifluromethane sulfonic acid,<br>
organic sulfonic acids, trichloroacetic acid,<br>
dichloroacetic acid, bromoacetic acid, chloroacetic<br>
acid, cyanoacetic acid, 2-chloropropanoic acid, 2-<br>
oxobutanoic acid, 2-chlorobutanoic acid, 4-cyanobutanoic<br>
acid, perchloric acid, phosphoric acid, hydrogen iodide,<br>
[0013] The biodegradable polymer can be any<br>
biocompatible and pharmaceutically acceptable polymers.<br>
The biodegradable polymers may be thermoplastic, which<br>
melts upon heating and solidifies upon cooling. The<br>
biodegradable polymers of the invention are<br>
substantially insoluble in aqueous or body fluid, but<br>
are capable of substantially dissolving or dispersing in<br>
a water-miscible organic solvent to form a solution or<br>
suspension. Upon contact with an aqueous fluid, the<br>
water-miscible organic solvent diffuses/dissipates from<br>
the inventive composition, which causes the coagulation<br><br>
of the polymer to form a gel, or solid matrix<br>
encapsulating the peptide agent. Examples of the<br>
polymers suitable for the present composition includes,<br>
without limitation, polylactides, polyglycolides,<br>
polycaprolactones, polyanhydrides, polyurethanes,<br>
polyesteramides, polyorthoesters, polydioxanones,<br>

polyhydroxybutyrates, polyhydroxyvalerates, polyalkylene<br>
oxalates, polyalkylene succinates, poly(malic acid),<br>
poly(maleic anhydride), and copolymers, terpolymers, or<br>
combinations or mixtures therein. Lactic acid-based<br>
polymers, and copolymers of lactic acid and glycolic<br>
acid (PLGA), including poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide)<br>
and poly(L-lactide-co-glycolide) are preferably used in<br>
the present invention. In some embodiments, the PLGA<br>
polymers have a weight average molecular weights of<br>
between about 2,000 to about 100,000 and monomer ratios<br>
of lactic acid to glycolic acid of between about 50:50<br>
to about 100:0.<br>
[0014] The pharmaceutically acceptable organic<br>
solvents may be selected from a group consisting of N-<br>
methyl-2-pyrrolidone, methoxypolyethylene glycol,<br>

acetate, methyl ethyl ketone, dimethylformamide,<br>

lactate, propylene carbonate, ethylene carbonate,<br>
butyrolactone, and 1-dodecylazacyclo-heptan-2-one, and<br>
combinations thereof.<br>
[0015] According to the present invention, one or<br>
more excipients may be incorporated in the inventive<br>
composition to achieve optimal delivery of the peptide<br>
agent. Suitable excipients may include release rate<br>
modifying agents, burst effect reducing materials,<br>
buffering materials, antioxidants, and the like.<br>
[0016] According to the present invention, suitable<br>

limited to, amphiphilic compounds or copolymers, such<br>

lipids, surfactants, copolymers of polyethyleneglycol<br>
and polylactide or poly(lactide-co-glycolide),<br>
poloxamers, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polysorbates, and the<br>
like; esters of mono-, di-, and tricarboxylic acids,<br>
such as 2-ethoxyethyl acetate, triethyl citrate, acetyl<br>
tributyl citrate, acetyl triethyl citrate, glycerol<br>
triacetate, di(n-butyl) sebecate, and the like;<br>
polyhydroxy Alcohols, such as polyethylene glycol,<br>
sorbitol, and the like; fatty acids; triesters of<br>
glycerol, such as triglycerides, medium-chain<br>
triglycerides such as MIGLYOL 810, 812, 818, 829, 840,<br>
and the like. Mixtures of rate modifying agents can Also<br>
be used in the polymer systems of the invention.<br>
[0017] According to the present invention, suitable<br>

method of making such compositions comprising the<br>
neutralization of basic amine groups of peptide agents<br>
to form a beneficial salt to minimize or prevent the<br>

as microparticle formation or other implantable matrix<br>
formation. Preferably, such injectable compositions are<br>
physico-chemically stable during preparation, storage,<br>
and subsequent administration to a subject and form<br><br>
consistent and controlled release implants upon<br>
administration to a tissue site.<br>
[0020] The present invention further provides a kit<br>

is a syringe. Accordingly, the present invention Also<br>
provides a method comprising a step of filling a syringe<br>
with the composition to form a stable product in a<br>
ready-to-use configuration.<br>
[0021] The present invention further provides a<br>

the peptide agent in a subject. The peptide agent is<br>
preferably incorporated into the in situ formed implant,<br>
and subsequently released into the surrounding tissue<br>
fluids and to the pertinent body tissue or organ as the<br>
polymer degrades. The method comprises: administration<br>

polymer; c) a pharmaceutically acceptable organic<br>
solvent. According to the invention, the pharmaceutical<br>
composition may optionally include one or more<br>
excipients to achieve optimal delivery of the peptide<br>
agent. The injectable polymeric composition of the<br>
present invention may be a viscous or non-viscous<br>
liquid, gel or semisolid that moves as a fluid so that<br>
it may be injected using a syringe. The injectable<br><br>
polymeric composition may be pre-filled into one syringe<br>
to form a product kit in a ready-to-use configuration.<br>
[0030] The controlled release delivery system of the<br>
present invention may be formed as an implantable<br>
polymeric matrix in vitro, or Alternatively, it may be<br>
formed in-situ in the forms of a gel or a solid implant.<br>
When administered to a subject, the controlled release<br>
of the peptide agent can be sustained for a desired<br>
period of time depending upon the composition of the<br>
implant. With the selections of the biodegradable<br>
polymer and other components, the duration of the<br>
sustained release of the peptide agent can be controlled<br>
over a period of time from several weeks to one year.<br>
[0031] The terms "a", "an" and "one", as used herein,<br>
are meant to be interpreted as "one or more" and "at<br>
least one."<br>
[0032] The term "stabilized", as used herein, refers<br>
to a significant improvement in the stability of the<br>
components in the injectable polymeric composition,<br>
which is necessary to achieve a stable state required to<br>
develop a viable product. The term "stabilized<br>
injectable polymeric composition" as used herein means<br>
that the components, e.g., the polymer and the peptide<br>
agent, of the composition retains at least 80%,<br>
preferably at least 90%, of their original molecular<br>
weight, structure and/or biological activity during<br>
manufacturing and after storage for an extended time<br>
period, e.g., months to years, preferably more than 12<br>
months, under appropriate conditions.<br>
[0033] The term "controlled release delivery", as<br>
defined herein, is intended to refer to the delivery of<br>
a peptide agent in vivo over a desired, extended period<br><br>
of time following administration, preferably from at<br>
least several weeks to one year.<br>
[0034] The term "peptide agent" as used herein is in<br>
a generic sense to include poly(amino acids) that are<br>
normally generally referred to as "peptides",<br>
"oligopeptides", and "polypeptides" or "proteins" which<br>
are used interchangeably herein. The term Also includes<br>
peptide agent analogs, derivatives, acylated<br>
derivatives, glycosylated derivatives, pegylated<br>
derivatives, fusion proteins and the like. The "basic<br>
peptide agent" is a peptide which is basic in nature,<br>
arising from the presence of basic amino acids, for<br>
example arginine or lysine, or arising from the N-<br>
terminus of the peptide agent, or simply a peptide agent<br>
which contains at least one basic group, optionally in<br>
the presence of one or more acidic amino acid groups.<br>
The term Also includes synthetic analogues of peptides,<br>
unnatural amino acids having basic functionality, or any<br>
other form of introduced basicity.<br>
[0035] The term "peptide agent" is meant to include<br>
any peptide agents having diagnostic and/or therapeutic<br>
properties including, but not limited to, antimetabolic,<br>
antifungal, anti-inflammatory, antitumoral,<br>

invention may be any peptides capable of forming a<br>
beneficial salt with a strong acid, in particular a<br>

[0037] The preferred peptide agents used herein<br>
include the peptide agents wherein the N-terminus is not<br>
a primary amine. For example, the N-terminus of the<br>
peptide agents may be a pyroglutamic acid, e.g., LHRH,<br>
and LHRH agonists such as leuprorelin, buserelin,<br>
gonadorelin, deslorelin, fertirelin, histrelin,<br>
lutrelin, goserelin, nafarelin, triptorelin, and the<br>
like. Alternatively, the N-terminal amine group may be<br>
capped or acylated, e.g., cetrorelix, enfuvirtide,<br>
thymosin α1, abarelix, and the like.<br>
[0038] The preferred peptide agents used herein Also<br>
include the peptide agents wherein the N-terminal<br>
primary amine is covalently modified with hydrophilic<br>
and/or lipophilic moieties such as through pegylation,<br>
acylation, and the like. The peptide agents used herein<br>
further include the peptide agents wherein the side<br>
chain primary amine(s) are covalently modified with<br>
hydrophilic and/or lipophilic moieties such as through<br>
pegylation, acylation, and the like. The preferred<br>
peptide agents used herein further include the peptide<br>
agents wherein both N-terminal primary amine and side<br><br>
chain primary amine groups are covalently modified<br>
simultaneously with hydrophilic and/or lipophilic<br>
moieties such as through pegylation, acylation, and the<br>
like.<br>
[0039] The term "hydrophilic moiety" refers to any<br>
water-soluble linear or branched oligomer or polymer<br>
including, but not limited to, polyethylene glycol and<br>
polypropylene glycol and similar linear and branched<br>
polymers. Preferably, the molecular weight of the<br>
polymer ranges from about 500 daltons to about 50,000<br>
daltons. Hydrophilic polymers for use in the present<br>
invention may have a reactive group incorporated for<br>
attachment to the peptide agent of interest through<br>
amine, carboxylic, hydroxyl, or thiol groups.<br>
[0040] The term "pegylation" used herein refers to<br>
the covalent conjugation of a soluble polyethylene<br>
glycol to the peptide agents. Polyethylene glycol can<br>
be prepared according to standard protocols with one end<br>
capped as with a methoxy group and the other end<br>
activated for facile conjugation to active groups on<br>
peptide agents. For examples, various methods for<br>
preparing polyethylene glycols and their use for<br>
pegylations are described in the art: [e.g., Roberts MJ,<br>

PEGylation. Adv Drug Deliv Rev. 2002 Jun 17; 54(4): 459-<br>

review of problems and solutions. Biomaterials. 2001<br>
Mar; 22(5): 405-17 and US Patents Nos. 6,113,906;<br>
5,446,090; 5,880,255] , which are all incorporated herein<br>
by reference.<br>
[0041] The term "lipophilic moiety" refers to any<br>
molecules having a solubility in water at 20 °C less than<br><br>
5 mg/ml, preferably less than 0.5 mg/ml, more preferably-<br>
less than 0.1 mg/mL. Such a lipophilic moiety is<br>
preferably selected from C2-39-Alkyl, C2-39-Alkenyl, C2-39-<br>
Alkadienyl and steroidal residues. The term "C2-39-Alkyl,<br>
C2-39-Alkenyl, C2-39-Alkadienyl" are intended to cover<br>
straight chain and branched, preferably straight chain,<br>
saturated, monounsaturated and di-unsaturated<br>
hydrocarbon of 2-39 carbon atoms.<br>
[0042] Introduction of a lipophilic moiety covalently<br>
to a peptide agent thereof leads to a lipophilically<br>
modified peptide that may have improved therapeutic<br>
effect comparing to the native molecule. This can be<br>
Typically done by reacting an amine group in a peptide<br>
agent with an acid or other reactive groups in a<br>
lipophilic molecule. Alternatively, the conjugation<br>
between peptide agent and lipophilic molecule is<br>
accomplished through an additional moiety such as a<br>
bridge, spacer, or linkage moiety, which can be<br>
degradable or non-degradable. Some examples are<br>
disclosed in the prior art, [e.g., Hashimoto, M. , et<br>
al., pharmaceutical Research, 6:171-176 (1989), and<br>
Lindsay, D. G., et al., Biochemical J. 121:737-745<br>
(1971), U.S. Pat. No. 5,693,609, WO95/07931, U.S. Pat.<br>
No. 5,750,497, and WO96/29342. WO98/08871, WO98/08872,<br>
and WO99/43708]. These disclosures are expressly<br>
incorporated herein by reference for describing<br>
lipophilically modified peptides and for enabling<br>
preparation of the same.<br>
[0043] The term "strong acid", as defined herein, is<br>
meant to include any acids with a pKa less than 3,<br>
preferably less than 0, and more preferably less than -<br>
3. The strong acids suitable for the present invention<br><br>
may be selected from, but not limited to, the group<br>
consisting of hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid,<br>
nitric acid, chromic acid, sulfuric acid,<br>
methanesulfonic acid, trifluromethane sulfonic acid,<br>
trichloroacetic acid, dichloroacetic acid, bromoacetic<br>
acid, chloroacetic acid, cyanoacetic acid, 2-<br>
chloropropanoic acid, 2-oxobutanoic acid, 2-<br>
chlorobutanoic acid, 4-cyanobutanoic acid, pamoic acid,<br>
perchloric acid, phosphoric acid, hydrogen iodide, and<br>
the like.<br>
[0044] The "strong acid" of the present invention<br>
Also includes any organic sulfuric acids such as Alkyl,<br>
aryl or Alkylaryl sulfuric acids of 1-40 carbons,<br>
preferably less than 18 carbons, and more preferably<br>
less than 6 carbons, and organic sulfonic acids such as<br>
Alkane, arylalkane, arene, or Alkene sulfonic acids of<br>
1-40 carbons, preferably less than 18 carbons, and more<br>
preferably less than 6 carbons.<br>
[0045] The term "a beneficial salt of a peptide<br>
agent", as defined herein, is meant to include any salts<br>
of a peptide agent formed with a strong acid. The<br>
beneficial salts of peptide agents can be prepared by<br>
simple acid and base titration or neutralization. The<br>
beneficial salts of peptide agents can be prepared<br>
during its synthesis and purification processes.<br>
Alternatively, they can be prepared from peptide agent<br>
in the form of a free base. The free base is dissolved<br>
in a suitable liquid medium. This solution of the<br>
peptide agent is mixed with a solution of a strong acid<br>
to form the beneficial salts by removing the solvent<br>
through suitable means such as filtration or<br>
lyophilization. If the peptide agent is in its common<br><br>
commercially available form of a salt formed with a weak<br>
acid (i.e., pKa&gt;3), the weak acid can be replaced by a<br>
strong acid through common ion-exchange methods such as<br>
lyophilization, precipitation or other methods known in<br>
the art. For example, leuprolide acetate is dissolved<br>
in a suitable liquid medium, e.g., water. This solution<br>
of the peptide agent is mixed with an aqueous solution<br>
of a strong acid such as hydrochloric acid. When the<br>
peptide acetate and a strong acid such as hydrochloric<br>
acid are dissolved in water, the peptide tends to be<br>
associated with chloride ion, as the stronger acid HCl<br>
displaces the weaker carboxylic acetic acid. The solvent<br>
and liberated acetic acid (or other weak but volatile<br>
carboxylic acid) may be removed under vacuum. Thus, the<br>
mixture solution is freeze-dried to remove water and<br>
weaker acid to form the beneficial salts. If the<br>
peptide agent is not stable under low pH, the beneficial<br>
salts of the peptide agent can be prepared through<br>
extensive dialysis against very low concentration of a<br>
strong acid.<br>
[0046] The injectable polymeric compositions of the<br>
present invention may contain peptide agent in a range<br>
of 0.01 to 40% by weight. In general, the optimal drug<br>
loading depends upon the period of release desired and<br>
the potency of the peptide agent. Obviously, for<br>
peptide agent of low potency and longer period of<br>
release, higher levels of incorporation may be required.<br>
[0047] The term "biodegradable" refers to a material<br>
that gradually decomposes, dissolves, hydrolyzes and/or<br>
erodes in situ. Generally, the "biodegradable polymers"<br>
herein are polymers that are hydrolyzable, and/or<br><br>
bioerode in situ primarily through hydrolysis and/or<br>
enzymolysis.<br>
[0048] The term "biodegradable polymer" as used<br>
herein is meant to include any biocompatible and/or<br>
biodegradable synthetic and natural polymers that can be<br>
used in vivo, provided the polymer is at least<br>
substantially insoluble in aqueous medium or body fluid.<br>
The term "substantially insoluble" as used herein refers<br>
that the insolubility of the polymer must be sufficient<br>
to result in precipitation of the polymer in aqueous<br>
medium or body fluid. Preferably, the solubility of the<br>
polymers is less than 1% by weight, and more preferably<br>
less than 0.1%. When the polymer solution in a water<br>
miscible or dispersible organic solvent is mixed with an<br>
aqueous solution, the polymer will precipitate to form a<br>
solid or gelled matrix as the organic solvent<br>
dissipates. Suitable biodegradable polymers are<br>
disclosed, e.g., in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,938,763; 5,278,201;<br>
5,278,2012; 5,324,519; 5,702,716; 5,744,153; 5,990,194;<br>
and 6,773,714. Some non-limiting examples of the<br>
polymers are polylactides, polyglycolides,<br>
polycaprolactones, polydioxanones, polycarbonates,<br>
polyhydroxybutyrates, polyalkylene oxalates,<br>
polyanhydrides, polyesteramides, polyurethanes,<br>
polyacetals, polyorthocarbonates, polyphosphazenes,<br>
polyhydroxyvalerates, polyalkylene succinates,<br>
poly(malic acid), and polyorthoesters, and copolymers,<br>
block copolymers, branched copolymers, terpolymers and<br>
combinations and mixtures thereof.<br>
[0049] The block copolymers include A-B-A block<br>
copolymers, B-A-B block copolymers, and/or A-B block<br>
copolymers and/or branched copolymers. The preferred<br><br>
block copolymers are those wherein the A block comprises<br>
a hydrophobic polymer and the B block comprises a<br>
hydrophilic polymer. Particularly, when using one of the<br>
aforementioned block copolymers, the most preferred<br>
polymeric matrices are defined where the A block is a<br>
biodegradable polymer selected from the group consisting<br>
of polylactides, polyglycolides, poly(lactide-co-<br>
glycolide)s, polyanhydrides, poly(ortho ester)s,<br>
polyetheresters, polycaprolactones, polyesteramides,<br>
poly(ε-caprolactone)s, poly(hydroxybutyric acid)s, and<br>
blends and copolymers thereof, and the B block is<br>
polyethylene glycol or monofunctionally derivatized<br>
polyethylene glycol such as methoxy polyethylene glycol.<br>
Many of these combinations may form acceptable thermal<br>
reversible gels.<br>
[0050] Suitable molecular weights for polymers may be<br>
determined by a person of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
Factors that may be considered when determining<br>
molecular weights include desired polymer degradation<br>
rate, mechanical strength, and rate of dissolution of<br>
polymer in organic solvents. Typically, a suitable range<br>
of weight averaged molecular weights of polymers is of<br>
about 2,000 daltons to about 100,000 daltons with a<br>
polydispersity of from 1.1 to 2.5, depending upon which<br>
polymer is selected for use, among other factors.<br>
[0051] The injectable polymeric compositions of the<br>
present invention may contain biodegradable polymer in a<br>
range of 10% to 70% by weight. The viscosity of the<br>
injectable compositions of the invention depends on the<br>
molecular weight of the polymer and organic solvent<br>
used. Typically, when the same solvent is used, the<br>
higher the molecular weight and the concentration of the<br><br>
polymer, the higher the viscosity. Preferably the<br>
concentration of the polymer in the compositions is less<br>
than 70% by weight. More preferably concentration of the<br>
polymer in the compositions is between 30 to 60% by<br>
weight.<br>
[0052] Poly(lactic acid), and copolymers of lactic<br>
acid and glycolic acid (PLGA), including poly(D,L-<br>
lactide-co-glycolide) and poly(L-lactide-co-glycolide)<br>
are preferably used in the present invention. The<br>
polymers (or thermoplastic polyesters) have monomer<br>
ratios of lactic acid to glycolic acid of between about<br>
50:50 to about 100:0 and weight average molecular<br>
weights of between about 2,000 to about 100,000. The<br>
biodegradable thermoplastic polyesters can be prepared<br>
using the methods known in the art, e.g.,<br>
polycondensation and ring-opening polymerization (e.g.,<br>
U.S.Pat. No. 4,443,340; 5,242,910; 5,310,865, which are<br>
all incorporated herein by reference). The terminal<br>
groups of the poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) can either<br>
be hydroxyl, carboxylic, or ester depending upon the<br>
method of polymerization. The suitable polymers may<br>
include a monofunctional Alcohol or a polyol residue and<br>
may not have a carboxylic acid terminus. Examples of<br>
monofunctional Alcohols are methanol, ethanol, or 1-<br>
dodecanol. The polyol may be a diol, triol, tetraol,<br>
pentaol and hexaol including ethylene glycol, 1,6-<br>
hexanediol, polyethylene glycol, glycerol, saccharides,<br>
reduced saccharides such as sorbitol, and the like.<br>
[0053] Many suitable PLGAs are available<br>
commercially, and the PLGAs of specific compositions can<br>
be readily prepared according to the prior art. The<br>
PLGAs of various monomer ratios and molecular weights<br><br>
are available from Boehringer-Ingelheim (Petersburg, Va,<br>
USA), Lakeshore Biomaterials (Birmingham, AL, USA) ,<br>
DURECT Corporation (Pelham, AL).<br>
[0054] The type, molecular weight, and amount of<br>
biodegradable polymer present in the compositions can<br>
influence the length of time in which the peptide agent<br>
is released from the controlled release implant. The<br>
selection of the type, molecular weight, and amount of<br>
biodegradable polymer present in the compositions to<br>
achieve desired properties of the controlled release<br>
implant can be determined by simple experimentations.<br>
[0055] In one preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the liquid composition can be used to<br>
formulate a controlled release delivery system for<br>
leuprolide hydrochloride. In such an embodiment, the<br>
biodegradable thermoplastic polyester can preferably be<br>
85/15 poly (DL-lactide-co-glycolide) containing a<br>
hydroxyl terminal group and a lauryl ester terminus; can<br>
be present in about 30% to about 60% of the composition<br>
by weight; and can have an average molecular weight of<br>
about 15,000 to about 50,000.<br>
[0056] In another preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the liquid composition can be used to<br>
formulate a controlled release delivery system for<br>
leuprolide hydrochloride. In such an embodiment, the<br>
biodegradable thermoplastic polyester can preferably be<br>
85/15 poly (DL-lactide-co-glycolide) containing two<br>
hydroxyl terminal groups; can be present in about 30% to<br>
about 60% of the composition by weight; and can have an<br>
average molecular weight of about 15,000 to about<br>
50,000.<br><br>
[0057] In still another preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention, the liquid composition can be used to<br>
formulate a controlled release delivery system for<br>
leuprolide hydrochloride. In such an embodiment, the<br>
biodegradable thermoplastic polyester can preferably be<br>
85/15 poly (DL-lactide-co-glycolide) containing a<br>
carboxylic acid terminal groups; can be present in about<br>
30% to about 60% of the composition by weight; and can<br>
have an average molecular weight of about 15,000 to<br>
about 50,000.<br>
[0058] In still another preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention, the composition can be used to<br>
formulate a controlled release delivery system of<br>
leuprolide. In such an embodiment, the biodegradable<br>
polymer can preferably be 100/0 poly (DL-lactide)<br>
with/without carboxylic acid terminal groups; can be<br>
present in about 40% to about 60% of the composition by<br>
weight; and can have an average molecular weight of<br>
about 8,000 to about 50,000.<br>
[0059] The term "pharmaceutically acceptable organic<br>
solvent" is meant to include any biocompatible organic<br>
solvents that are miscible or dispersible in aqueous or<br>
body fluid. The term "dispersible" means that the<br>
solvent partially soluble or miscible in water.<br>
Preferably, a single solvent or a mixture of solvents<br>
has a solubility or miscibility in water of greater than<br>
0.1% by weight. More preferably, the solvent has a<br>
solubility or miscibility in water of greater than 3% by<br>
weight. Most preferably, the solvent has a solubility<br>
or miscibility in water of greater than 7% by weight.<br>
The suitable organic solvent should be able to diffuse<br>
into body fluid so that the liquid composition<br><br>
coagulates or solidifies. Single and/or mixture of such<br>
solvents can be employed; the suitability of such<br>
solvents can be determined readily by simple<br>
experimentations.<br>
[0060] Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
organic solvent include, but not limited to, N-methyl-2-<br>
pyrrolidone, methoxypolyethylene glycol,<br>
Alkoxypolyethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol esters,<br>
glycofurol, glycerol formal, methyl acetate, ethyl<br>
acetate, methyl ethyl ketone, dimethylformamide,<br>
dimethyl sulfoxide, tetrahydrofuran, caprolactam,<br>
decylmethylsulfoxide, benzyl benzoate, ethyl benzoate,<br>
triacetin, diacetin, tributyrin, triethyl citrate,<br>
tributyl citrate, acetyl triethyl citrate, acetyl<br>
tributyl citrate, triethylglycerides, triethyl<br>
phosphate, diethyl phthalate, diethyl tartrate, ethyl<br>
lactate, propylene carbonate, ethylene carbonate,<br>
butyrolactone, and 1-dodecylazacyclo-heptan-2-one, and<br>
combinations thereof.<br>
[0061] The solubility of the biodegradable polymers<br>
in various pharmaceutically acceptable organic solvents<br>
will differ depending upon the characteristics of the<br>
polymers and their compatibility with various solvents.<br>
Thus, the same polymer will not be soluble to the same<br>
extent in different solvents. For example, PLGA has a<br>
much higher solubility in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP)<br>
than that in triacetin. However, when PLGA solution in<br>
NMP is in contact with aqueous solution, NMP will<br>
dissipate very rapidly to form a solid polymer matrix<br>
due to its high water miscibility. The fast diffusion<br>
rate of the solvent may result in a solid implant<br>
quickly, however, it may Also lead to a high initial<br><br>
burst release. When PLGA solution in triacetin is in<br>
contact with aqueous solution, triacetin will dissipate<br>
very slowly due to its low water miscibility. The slow<br>
diffusion rate of the solvent may take a long time to<br>
transform from a viscous liquid to a solid matrix.<br>
There may be an optimum balance at which the solvent<br>
diffuse out and the coagulation of the polymer to<br>
encapsulate peptide agents. Therefore, it may be<br>
advantageous to combine different solvents to obtain a<br>
desirable delivery system. The solvents of low and high<br>
water miscibility may be combined to improve the<br>
solubility of the polymer, modify the viscosity of the<br>
composition, optimize the diffusion rate, and reduce the<br>
initial burst release,<br>
[0062] The injectable polymeric compositions of the<br>
present invention Typically contain an organic solvent<br>
in a range of 30% to 80% by weight. The viscosity of<br>
the injectable compositions of the invention depends on<br>
the molecular weight of the polymer and organic solvent<br>
used. Preferably the concentration of the polymer in<br>
the compositions is less than 70% by weight. More<br>
preferably concentration of the polymer in solutions is<br>
between 30 to 60% by weight.<br>
[0063] The term "excipients" as used herein is meant<br>
to include any useful ingredient in the composition<br>
aside from the peptide agent or the biodegradable<br>
polymers used to form the composition. Suitable<br>
excipients include release rate modifying agents, burst<br>
effect reducing materials, buffering materials,<br>
antioxidants, and the like.<br>
[0064] According to the present invention, suitable<br>

and polylactide or poly(lactide-co-glycolide),<br>
poloxamers, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polysorbates, and the<br>
like; esters of mono-, di-, and tricarboxylic acids,<br>
such as 2-ethoxyethyl acetate, triethyl citrate, acetyl<br>

and the like. Mixtures of rate modifying agents can Also<br>
be used in the polymer systems of the invention.<br>
[0065] The release rate modifying agents may be<br>
present in the injectable polymeric composition in an<br>
amount effective to reduce the initial burst of peptide<br>
agent released from the polymeric composition during the<br>
first 24 hours after implantation. Preferably, the<br>
polymeric composition includes about 1% to about 50% by<br>
weight, more preferably about 2% to about 20% by weight<br>
of the release rate modifying agents.<br>
[0066] According to the present invention, suitable<br>
buffering agents include, but are not limited to,<br>
inorganic and organic salts including calcium carbonate,<br>
calcium hydroxide, calcium myristate; calcium oleate,<br>

palmitate, zinc stearate, zinc phosphate, and<br>
combinations thereof.<br>
[0067] The buffering agents may be present in the<br>
injectable polymeric composition in an amount effective<br>
to stabilize the pH within the implants during the<br>
degradation process. Preferably, the polymeric<br>
composition includes about 1 wt % to about 30 wt %, more<br>
preferably about 2 wt % to about 15 wt % of the<br>
buffering agents.<br>
[0068] According to the present invention, suitable<br>

to scavenge any radicals or peroxides generated within<br>
the implants. Preferably, the polymeric composition<br>
includes about 1 wt % to about 30 wt %, more preferably<br>
about 3 wt % to about 15 wt % of the antioxidants.<br>
[0070] In one aspect the present invention provides a<br>
stabilized injectable biodegradable polymeric<br>
composition for forming an economical, practical, and<br>
efficient controlled release delivery system for peptide<br>
agents comprises a) a beneficial salt of a peptide agent<br>
formed with a strong acid which minimizes or prevents<br>
the interaction/reaction between the peptide agent and<br>
the polymer in an organic solution; b) a biodegradable<br><br>
polymer; c) a pharmaceutically acceptable organic<br>
solvent; and d) optionally one or more excipients to<br>
achieve optimal delivery of the peptide agent.<br>
Preferably, the injectable composition is packaged into<br>
a kit comprising a step to fill the composition into a<br>
syringe in a ready-to-use configuration. The composition<br>
in the kit is stable for a reasonable period of time,<br>
preferably at least one year, to have a suitable storage<br>
shelf-life under controlled storage conditions. The<br>
composition is preferably injected into a subject to<br>
form in situ an implant, from which the peptide agent is<br>
released in a therapeutic effective amount over a<br>
desired, extended period of time.<br>
[0071] The stabilized injectable biodegradable<br>
polymeric composition of the present invention can be<br>
prepared by appropriately combining a beneficial salt of<br>
a peptide agent, a biodegradable polymer, a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable organic solvent, and an<br>
optional excipient. The composition for administration<br>
may conveniently presented in dosage unit form and may<br>
be prepared by any of the methods known in the art of<br>
pharmacy. One preferred method of preparing the<br>
composition of the present invention is to dissolve a<br>
biodegradable polymer and/or an excipient in a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable organic solvent to obtain a<br>
uniform polymer solution/suspension first. Then the<br>
beneficial salt of a peptide agent is added to this<br>
solution/suspension. The components are thoroughly mixed<br>
using any proper means to obtain a uniform solution or<br>
suspension. Then an appropriate amount of the solution<br>
or suspension is transferred into a syringe to obtain a<br>
ready-to-use product.<br><br>
[0072] The level of incorporation of the beneficial<br>
salt and polymer in the composition of the invention<br>
will naturally vary, depending upon the potency of the<br>
peptide agent component, the period of time over which<br>
delivery of the agent is desired, the solubility of the<br>
polymer in the solvent, and the volume and viscosity of<br>
the injectable composition which is desired to<br>
administer.<br>
[0073] In certain preferred embodiments of the<br>
present invention, the injectable biodegradable<br>
polymeric composition for forming an economical,<br>
practical, and efficient controlled release delivery<br>
system for peptide agents contains about 0.01% to 40% of<br>
the beneficial salt of a peptide agent and about 10% to<br>
70% of a poly(lactide-co-glycolide) polymer. The<br>
composition further contains about 30% to 70% of a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable organic solvent.<br>
[0074] In a preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the composition further contains about 1% to<br>
40% of a suitable excipient including release rate<br>
modifying agents, burst effect reducing materials,<br>
buffering materials, antioxidants, tissue transporting<br>
agents and the like as defined above.<br>
[0075] According to the present invention, the<br>
injectable composition is transferred into a sterile<br>
container suitable for injection administration, e.g., a<br>
syringe. The container is packaged for storage and the<br>
components of the composition retains at least 80%,<br>
preferably 90%, of their original molecular weight,<br>
structure and/or biological activity during<br>
manufacturing and storage processes or prior to<br>
administration to a subject such as an animal or human.<br><br>
[0076] Thus, according to the present invention, the<br>
stabilized compositions can be administered to a subject<br>
where controlled release delivery of a peptide agent is<br>
desired. As used herein, the term "subject" is intended<br>
to include warm-blooded animals, preferably mammals,<br>
most preferably humans.<br>
[0077] As used herein, the term "administered to a<br>
subject" is intended to refer to dispensing, delivering<br>
or applying a composition (e.g., pharmaceutical<br>
formulation) to a subject by any suitable route for<br>
delivery of the composition to the desired location in<br>
the subject. Preferably, the composition of the present<br>
invention can be administered by injection and/or<br>
implantation subcutaneously, intramuscularly,<br>
intraperitoneally, or intradermally to provide the<br>
desired dosage based on the known parameters for<br>
treatment of the various medical conditions with the<br>
peptide agent.<br>
[0078] The term "controlled release delivery", as<br>
defined herein, is intended to refer to continual<br>
delivery of a peptide agent in vivo over a period of<br>
time following administration, preferably from at least<br>
several weeks to one year. Sustained controlled release<br>
delivery of the agent can be demonstrated by, for<br>
example, the continued therapeutic effect of the agent<br>
over time (e.g., for an LHRH analogue, sustained<br>
delivery of the analogue can be demonstrated by<br>
continued suppression of testosterone synthesis over<br>
time) . Alternatively, sustained delivery of the peptide<br>
agent may be demonstrated by detecting the presence of<br>
the agent in vivo over time.<br><br>
[0079] The amount of the injectable composition<br>
administered will Typically depend upon the desired<br>
properties of the controlled release implant. For<br>
example, the amount of the injectable composition can<br>
influence the length of time in which the peptide agent<br>
is released from the controlled release implant.<br>
[0080] In a preferred embodiment, the volume of the<br>
injectable polymeric composition of the present<br>
invention to be injected to a subject ranges from 0.1 mL<br>
to 2.0 mL; preferably from 0.2 mL to 1.0 mL; and more<br>
preferably from 0.3 mL to 0.5 mL.<br>
[0081] The present invention further provides a<br>
method for in situ forming an implant in a subject<br>
comprising administering to a subject an effective<br>
amount of the injectable composition comprising: a) a<br>
beneficial salt of a peptide agent formed with a strong<br>
acid which minimizes or prevents the<br>
interaction/reaction between the peptide agent and the<br>
polymer in an organic solution; b) a biodegradable<br>
polymer; c) a pharmaceutically acceptable organic<br>
solvent; and d) optionally one or more excipients to<br>
achieve optimal delivery of the peptide agent; and<br>
allowing the solvent to dissipate into the surrounding<br>
aqueous environment to transform the liquid composition<br>
into a depot by phase separation. The depot may be a<br>
viscous gel, a semi-solid, or a solid matrix. The depot<br>
may Also be porous or non-porous. The depot serves as<br>
the delivery system from which the peptide agent is<br>
released over a desired and extended period of time.<br>
[0082] In another preferred embodiment, the<br>
injectable composition of the present invention may be<br>
administered to fit into a body cavity to form a depot<br><br>
system. Such cavities include the cavities created<br>
after a surgery or natural body cavity such as vagina,<br>
anus, and the like.<br>
[0083] In another aspect, the present invention<br>
provides a stabilized liquid biodegradable polymeric<br>
composition for forming an economical, practical, and<br>
efficient controlled release delivery system for peptide<br>
agents comprises a) a beneficial salt of a peptide agent<br>
formed with a strong acid which minimizes or prevents<br>
the interaction/reaction between the peptide agent and<br>
the polymer in an organic solution; b) a biodegradable<br>
polymer; c) an organic solvent; and d) optionally one or<br>
more excipients to achieve optimal delivery of the<br>
peptide agent. The liquid biodegradable polymeric<br>
composition may be fabricated into implantable polymeric<br>
matrices. Wherein the liquid biodegradable polymeric<br>
composition retains at least 90%, preferably 95%, of<br>
their original molecular weight, structure and/or<br>
biological activity before and during the fabrication<br>
process.<br>
[0084] As used herein, the term of "implantable<br>
polymeric matrices " is intended to include particles,<br>
films, pellets, cylinders, discs, microcapsules,<br>
microspheres, nanospheres, microparticles, wafers, and<br>
other known polymeric configurations used for drug<br>
delivery.<br>
[0085] Methods for forming various pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable polymer carriers are well known in the art.<br>
For examples, various methods and materials are<br>
described in US Patents: 6,410,044; 5,698,213;<br>
6,312,679; 5,410,016; 5.529,914; 5,501,863; and PCT<br>
Publication No. WO 93/16687; 4.938,763; 5,278,201;<br><br>
5,278,202; EP 0,058,481; which are all incorporated<br>
herein by reference.<br>
[0086] According to the present invention, the<br>
implantable polymeric matrices in the form of<br>
microspheres are produced by encapsulating the<br>
beneficial salt of peptide agents into the polymer. The<br>
beneficial salt of peptide agents can be encapsulated<br>
using various biocompatible and/or biodegradable<br>
polymers having unique properties that are suitable for<br>
delivery to different biological environments or for<br>
effecting specific functions. The rate of dissolution<br>
and, therefore, delivery of peptide agent is determined<br>
by the particular encapsulation technique, polymer<br>
composition, polymer crosslinking, polymer thickness,<br>
polymer solubility, size and solubility of biologically<br>
active compound/polyanion complex.<br>
[0087] The beneficial salts of peptide agents to be<br>
encapsulated are dissolved or suspended in a polymer<br>
solution in an organic solvent. The polymer solution<br>
must be concentrated enough to completely coat the<br>
beneficial salt after they are added to the solution.<br>
Such an amount is one that provides a weight ratio of<br>
the beneficial salt of peptide agents to polymer between<br>
about 0.01 and about 50, preferably between about 0.1<br>
and about 30. The beneficial salt of peptide agents<br>
should be kept suspended and not allowed to aggregate as<br>
they are coated by contact with the polymer.<br>
[0088] A polymer solution of the beneficial salts of<br>
peptide agents can therefore be subjected to a variety<br>
of microencapsulation techniques including spray drying,<br>
spray congealing, emulsion, and solvent evaporation<br>
emulsion.<br><br>
[0089] According to one embodiment of the invention,<br>
the beneficial salt of peptide agents is dissolved or<br>
suspended in a polymer solution in an organic solvent.<br>
The solution or suspension is transferred to a larger<br>
volume of an aqueous solution containing an emulsifier.<br>
In the aqueous solution, the organic phase is<br>
emulsified, where the organic solvent evaporates or<br>
diffuses away from the polymer. The solidified polymer<br>
encapsulates the beneficial salt of peptide agents to<br>
form a polymer matrix. The emulsifier helps to reduce<br>
the interfacial surface tension between the various<br>
phases of matter in the system during the hardening<br>
phase of the process. Alternatively, if the<br>
encapsulating polymer has some inherent surface<br>
activity, there may be no need for addition of a<br>
separate surface-active agent.<br>
[0090] Emulsifiers useful to prepare encapsulated the<br>
beneficial salt of peptide agents according to the<br>
present invention include poloxamers and polyvinyl<br>
Alcohol as exemplified herein, surfactants and other<br>
surface active compounds which can reduce the surface<br>
tension between the polymer encapsulated beneficial salt<br>
of peptide agents and the solution.<br>
[0091] Organic solvents useful to prepare the<br>
microspheres of the present invention, except for those<br>
disclosed above, Also include acetic acid, acetone,<br>
methylene chloride, ethyl acetate, chloroform and other<br>
non-toxic solvents that will depend on the properties of<br>
the polymer. Solvents should be chosen to dissolve the<br>
polymer and are ultimately non-toxic.<br>
[0092] Thus, according to the present invention,<br>
these implantable polymeric matrices can be administered<br><br>
to a subject where sustained controlled release delivery<br>
of a peptide agent is desired. Preferably, the<br>
implantable polymeric matrices of the invention can be<br>
administered by injection and/or implantation<br>
subcutaneously, intramuscularly, intraperitoneally, or<br>
intradermally to provide the desired dosage based on the<br>
known parameters for treatment of the various medical<br>
conditions with the peptide agent.<br>

herein are fully incorporated by reference.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
[0094] The following examples illustrate the<br>
compositions and methods of the present invention. The<br>
following examples should not be considered as<br>
limitations, but should merely teach how to make the<br>
useful controlled release drug delivery compositions.<br>
[0095] Example 1. Preparation of beneficial salts of<br>
peptide agents and peptide derivatives formed with<br>
strong acids<br>
[0096] Peptide agent or peptide derivative containing<br>
at least one basic functional group is dissolved in<br>
water. Stoichiometric amounts of a strong acid are<br>
added to the aqueous solution of the peptide agent,<br>
resulting in neutralization of the basic groups in the<br>
peptide agent. The salt is obtained by precipitation,<br>
filtration and/or lyophilization.<br>
[0097] Example 2. Preparation of leuprolide<br>
hydrochloride<br><br>
[0098] Leuprolide is a luteinizing hormone releasing<br>
hormone (LHRH) agonist containing 9 amino acid residues<br>
and two basic functionalities (a histidine and an<br>
arginine group). Its N-terminal amine was blocked in the<br>
form of pyroglutamic acid. It has been used in the<br>
treatment of prostate cancer and endometriosis.<br>
Leuprolide acetate (LA-Ac) was obtained from<br>
Polypeptides Laboratories, Inc. (PPL Lot#PPL-LEUP0401A).<br>
Leuprolide Hydrochloride (LA-HCl) was prepared by<br>
replacing acetic acid with HCl through an ion-exchange<br>
and lyophilization process. Typically, 1000 mg of<br>
leuprolide acetate was dissolved in 30 mL water. 3.19<br>
mL of 0.5 N HCl (HCl: LA ~ 2.2:1) was added and mixed<br>
well. The solution was freeze-dried for 72 h to remove<br>
acetic acid. The dried powder was re-dissolved in water<br>
and freeze-dried again.<br>
[0099] Example 3. Preparation of leuprolide mesylate<br>
343.5 mg of leuprolide acetate (PPL Lot#PPL-LEUP0401A)<br>
was dissolved in 20 mL water. 32 DL of methanesulfonic<br>
acid was added and mixed well (molar ratio of leuprolide<br>
acetate to methanesulfonic acid ~1:2). The solution was<br>
freeze-dried for 72 h to remove acetic acid. The dried<br>
powder was re-dissolved in water and freeze-dried again.<br>
[00100] Example 4. Preparation of goserelin<br>
hydrochloride<br>
[00101] 766 mg of goserelin acetate (PPL Lot#0603-219)<br>
was dissolved in 20 mL water. 2.12 mL of 0.5 N HCl<br>
(molar ration of HCl:goserelin acetate ~ 2.2:1) was<br>
added and mixed well. The solution was freeze-dried for<br>
72 h to remove acetic acid. The dried powder was re-<br>
dissolved in water and freeze-dried again.<br><br>
[00102] Example 5. Preparation of Palmitoyl-Octreotide<br>
(PAL-OCT)<br>
[00103] 50 mg of octreotide acetate was dissolved in<br>
1000 uL of anhydrous DMSO containing 100 uL TEA. 17.1 mg<br>
of Palmitic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Mw 353.50)<br>
was dissolved in 3 mL anhydrous DMSO and added by direct<br>
injection to the peptide solution. The reaction was<br>
allowed to proceed for overnight at room temperature.<br>
The mixture was poured into diethyl ether to precipitate<br>
Palmitoylated octreotide. The precipitate was washed<br>
with diethyl ether twice and then dried under vacuum.<br>
The resulting acylated peptide was in a form of white<br>
powder. The beneficial salt of the acylated peptide was<br>
formed by neutralizing the residual basic amine groups<br>
using a strong acid.<br>
[00104] Example 6. Preparation of Decanal-Octreotide<br>
(DCL-OCT)<br>
[00105] 50 mg of octreotide was dissolved in 2 mL of<br>
20 mM sodium cyanoborohydride (Mw 62.84, NaCNBH3) (2.51<br>
mg) solution in 0.1 M acetate buffer at pH 5. 13.7 mg of<br>
Decanal (Mw 156.27) (OCT:DCL = 1:2) was added by direct<br>
injection to the peptide solution. The reaction was<br>
allowed to proceed for overnight at 4 °C. The mixture<br>
was separated by centrifugation. The precipitated PAL-<br>
OCT was f reeze-dried. The beneficial salt of the<br>
acylated peptide was formed by neutralizing the residual<br>
basic amine groups using a strong acid.<br>
[00106] Example 7. Preparation of PEGylated octreotide<br>
[00107] A solution of octreotide acetate (10 mg/mL) in<br>
water was added to a vial containing 2 molar equivalent<br>
amount of succinimidyl propionate monomethoxy PEG (SPA-<br>
mPEG, MW 2000 dalton) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer at pH<br><br>
7.4. The reaction was allowed to proceed with stirring<br>
at 4°C overnight. Then the reaction mixture was<br>
separated by using reversed-phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) on C-18<br>
(YMC ODS-A 4.6X250 mm, 5 urn, Waters Corporation). The<br>
mobile phase consisted of 0.1% TFA in water (A) and CAN<br>
containing 0.1% TFA (B) . The mobile phase was run with<br>
a linear gradient from 30 to 60% eluent B for 20 min at<br>
a flow rate of lml/min and the UV absorbance of the<br>
elution was monitored at 215 nm. The elution fractions<br>
corresponding to respective peaks were collected<br>
separately, purged with nitrogen, and lyophilized.<br>
[00108] Alternatively, site-specific PEGylation of<br>
octreotide can be obtained. A solution of octreotide<br>
acetate (10 mg/mL) in 20 mM sodium cyanoborohydride<br>
(NaCNBH3) and 0.1 M acetate buffer at pH 5 was added to a<br>
vial containing 3 molar equivalent amount of monomethoxy<br>
PEG-propionaldehyde (ALD-mPEG, MW 2000 dalton) in water.<br>
The reaction was allowed to proceed with stirring at 4°C<br>
overnight. Then the reaction mixture was separated by<br>
using reversed-phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) on C-18 (YMC ODS-A 5<br>
‪m, 4.6x250 mm, Waters Corporation). The mobile phase<br>
consisted of 0.1% TFA in water (A) and CAN containing<br>
0.1% TFA (B) . The mobile phase was run with a linear<br>
gradient from 30 to 60% eluent B for 20 min at a flow<br>
rate of lml/min and the UV absorbance of the elution was<br>
monitored at 215 nm. The elution fractions<br>
corresponding to respective peaks were collected<br>
separately, purged with nitrogen, and lyophilized. The<br>
beneficial salt of the pegylated peptide is formed by<br>
neutralizing the residual basic amine groups using a<br>
strong acid.<br><br>
[00109] Example 8. Stability of peptide agent and<br>
biodegradable polymer in injectable polymeric<br>
compositions<br>
[00110] Poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) of an<br>
85/15 ratio of lactide to glycolide (DLPLG85/15, IV:<br>
0.28) with a lauryl ester end group was dissolved in N-<br>
methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) to give a 50% solution by<br>
weight. The leuprolide salts were mixed with the PLGA<br>
solution in NMP to give a uniform injectable composition<br>
at ratios shown in the Table 1. The injectable<br>
compositions were filled into 1.2mlL polypropylene<br>
syringes with luer-lock tips. Then the pre-filled<br>
syringes were sealed using luer-lock caps. The capped<br>
syringes were packaged in a container and sealed in a<br>
plastic bag under vacuum and then stored at 4°C and<br>
room temperature (~22°C) for up to 18 months. The<br>
injectable composition was sampled at 24 h, 1, 2, 3, 6,<br>
12, and 18 month time points. Purity of leuprolide in<br>
the sample was determined by HPLC. Molecular weight of<br>
the polymer was determined by gel permeation<br>
chromatography (GPC) using polystyrene standards with<br>
known molecular weights.<br><br><br>
[00111] It was surprisingly found that the use of<br>
hydrochloride and mesylate salts of leuprolide instead<br>
of acetate significantly reduced the degradation of<br>
leuprolide and polymer in PLGA solutions in NMP at both<br>
4°C and room temperature over time. Tables 2 and 3<br>
showed the degradation of leuprolide in PLGA solutions<br>
in NMP at 4°C and room temperature over time<br>
respectively. At 4°C, up to 23% of leuprolide was<br>
degraded in the polymeric composition containing<br>
leuprolide acetate, while less than 2% of leuprolide was<br>
degraded for those formulations containing leuprolide<br>
hydrochloride and leuprolide mesylate after 18 months.<br>
At room temperature, more than 35% degradation of<br>
leuprolide was observed for leuprolide acetate<br>
formulations, while only about 11% for leuprolide<br>
hydrochloride and leuprolide mesylate formulations after<br>
12 months. In addition, at room temperature, the color<br>
change (from milky to yellow to rusty color) and phase<br>
separation were observed. The phase separation resulted<br>
in heterogeneous formulations and uneven degradation of<br>
the peptide and the polymer in the formulation. The<br>
heterogeneity of the formulations may be the cause for<br>
the fluctuation of the results obtained at various time<br>
points.<br>
Table 2. Stability of Leuprolide in PLGA/NMP Formulation<br>
at 4°C<br><br><br><br>
Table 3. Stability of Leuprolide in PLGA/NMP Formulation<br>
at RT<br><br>
[00112] Table 4 and 5 showed the changes of molecular<br>
weight of the polymer in different formulations.<br>
Comparing to blank control, the molecular weight of PLGA<br>
in leuprolide acetate formulation decreased more than<br>
10% at 4°C and more than 90% at room temperature after 6<br>
months. The molecular weight of PLGA in leuprolide<br>
hydrochloride and leuprolide mesylate formulations was<br>
the same as that of the blank control at both 4°C and RT<br>
even after 12 months. However, after 12 months, more<br>
than 90% of the polymer from both blank control and<br>
leuprolide hydrochloride and leuprolide mesylate<br>
formulations was degraded. The results indicate that<br>
the salts of leuprolide formed with strong acid such as<br>
HCl and methanesulfonic acid completely prevent the<br>
interaction/reaction between the peptide and PLGA in<br>
solution. While the weak acid such as acetic acid does<br>
not prevent the deleterious interaction/reaction between<br><br>
the peptide and PLGA in solution. Thus, the improvement<br>
of the stability of the formulation by using the salt of<br>
the peptide formed with a strong acid enables the<br>
manufacturing of a ready-to-use injectable composition<br>
with a satisfactory storage stability of at least one<br>
year.<br>

[00114] Poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) of an<br>
85/15 ratio of lactide to glycolide (DLPLG85/15, IV:<br>
0.28) with a lauryl ester end group was dissolved in<br>
dimethylsulf oxide (DMSO) to give a 50% solution by<br>
weight. The leuprolide salts were mixed with the PLGA<br>
solution in DMSO to give a uniform injectable<br>
composition at ratios shown in the Table 6. The<br>
injectable compositions were filled into 1.2mlL<br>
polypropylene syringes with luer-lock tips. Then the<br>
pre-filled syringes were sealed using luer-lock caps.<br>
The capped syringes were packaged in a container and<br>
sealed in a plastic bag under vacuum and then stored at<br>
4°C and room temperature (-22°C) for up to 16 months.<br>
The injectable composition was sampled at pre-defined<br>
time points. Purity of leuprolide in the sample was<br>
determined by HPLC. Molecular weight of the polymer was<br>
determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using<br>
polystyrene standards with known molecular weights.<br><br><br>
[00115] It was surprisingly found that the use of<br>
hydrochloride and mesylate salts of leuprolide instead<br>
of acetate significantly reduced the degradation of<br>
leuprolide and polymer in PLGA solutions in DMSO at 4°C<br>
over time. Figures 1 and 2 showed the degradation of<br>
leuprolide in PLGA in solutions in DMSO at 4°C over<br>
time. Up to about 20% of leuprolide was degraded in the<br>
case of leuprolide acetate, while less than 5% of<br>
leuprolide was degraded for leuprolide hydrochloride and<br>
leuprolide mesylate formulations after 16 months.<br>
Figure 5 showed the changes of molecular weight of PLGA<br>
in different formulations. Comparing to blank control,<br>
the molecular weight of PLGA in leuprolide acetate<br>
formulation decreased about 40% at 4°C after 16 months.<br>
The molecular weight of PLGA in injectable polymeric<br>
compositions containing leuprolide hydrochloride and<br>
leuprolide mesylate was comparable to that of the<br>
control at 4°C after 16 months. The results indicate<br>
that the salts of leuprolide formed with strong acid<br>
such as HCl and methanesulfonic acid Almost completely<br>
prevent the interaction/reaction between the peptide and<br>
PLGA in DMSO solution. While the weak acid such as<br>
acetic acid does not prevent the deleterious<br>
interaction/reaction between the peptide and PLGA in<br>
DMSO solution.<br>
[00116] Example 10. In vitro release of leuprolide<br>
from injectable polymeric formulations<br>
[00117] Three polymer vehicle solutions were prepared<br>
as following: PLG 85/15 (0.28 IV) with a lauryl ester<br>
end group was dissolved in NMP at 50% and 55% by weight,<br>
and RG503 (0.42 IV) with a carboxylic acid end group was<br>
dissolved in NMP at 50% by weight. Then suitable amount<br><br>
of leuprolide hydrochloride (LAHCl) and leuprolide<br>
mesylate (LAMS) were mixed with the polymer solutions at<br>
6% by weight each. The formulations were thoroughly<br>
mixed to obtain uniform formulations.<br>
[00118] An Aliquot of the formulation suspension<br>
(about 100 mg) was injected into in 3 mL phosphate<br>
buffer saline solution at pH 7.4 with 0.1% sodium azide<br>
at 37°C. The receiving fluid was replaced at selected<br>
time points with fresh buffer solution, and the removed<br>
buffer solution diluted 2-fold with phosphate buffer at<br>
pH 7.4 was analyzed for drug concentration by HPLC. The<br>
amount released at each time point was calculated.<br>
Figure 3 shows the cumulative release of leuprolide for<br>
different formulations over time.<br>
[00119] As shown in Figure 3, there is no significant<br>
difference in leuprolide release between LAHCl and LAMS.<br>
However, the type and the concentration of PLGA seem to<br>
affect the release of leuprolide significantly. The<br>
release rate of leuprolide from RG503H formulation was<br>
much faster than that from PLG85/15 formulations. Thus,<br>
RG503H may be suitable for shorter-term delivery of<br>
leuprolide, while PLG85/15 may be useful for longer-term<br>
delivery of the peptide. The release rate of the<br>
peptide can Also be further modified by changing the<br>
concentration of the PLGA. As the concentration of<br>
PLG85/15 was increased from 50% to 55%, the initial<br>
release rate of leuprolide was significantly reduced.<br>
Thus, the parameters for a specific formulation for the<br>
peptide to achieve a desired release profile can be<br>
readily obtained by simple experimentations.<br>
[00120] Example 11. Effect of excipients on the in<br>
vitro release of leuprolide<br><br>
[00121] The polymer vehicle solutions with and without<br>
excipients were prepared as following: PLA 100DLPL<br>
(0.26 IV, Lakeshore, AL) with a lauryl ester end group<br>
and Vitamin E TPGS were dissolved in NMP at suitable<br>
amount according to the Table 7. Then suitable amount<br>
of leuprolide hydrochloride (LAHCl) was mixed with the<br>
polymer solutions at 15% by weight. The formulations<br>
were thoroughly mixed to obtain uniform formulations.<br>
Table 7. Effect of excipients on the in vitro<br>
release of leuprolide<br><br>
[00122] An Aliquot of the formulation suspension<br>
(about 100 mg) was injected into in 3 mL phosphate<br>
buffer saline solution at pH 7.4 with 0.1% sodium azide<br>
at 37°C. The receiving fluid was replaced at selected<br>
time points with fresh buffer solution, and the removed<br>
buffer solution diluted 10-fold with PBS at pH 7.4 was<br>
analyzed for drug concentration by HPLC. The amount<br>
released at each time point was calculated. Figure 4<br>
shows the cumulative release of leuprolide for different<br>
formulations over time.<br>
[00123] As shown in Figure 4, the incorporation of<br>
Vitamin E TPGS did not affect the initial burst, but<br>
seemed to reduce the release rate of leuprolide at later<br>
stages. Thus, Vitamin E TPGS may be useful for extending<br><br>
the delivery of the peptide and Also functioning as an<br>
antioxidant.<br>
[00124] Example 12. Effect of excipients on the in<br>
vitro release of leuprolide<br>
[00125] The polymer vehicle solutions with and without<br>
excipients were prepared as following: PLA 100D040<br>
(0.34 IV, Durect, CA) with a lauryl ester end group and<br>
medium chain triglyceride Miglyol 812 were dissolved in<br>
NMP at suitable amount according to the Table 8. Then<br>
suitable amount of leuprolide hydrochloride (LAHCl) was<br>
mixed with the polymer solutions at 15% by weight. The<br>
formulations were thoroughly mixed to obtain uniform<br>
formulations.<br>
Table 8. Effect of excipients on the in vitro<br>
release of leuprolide<br><br>
[00126] An Aliquot of the formulation suspension<br>
(about 100 mg) was injected into a vial containing 3 mL<br>
phosphate buffer saline solution at pH 7.4 with 0.1%<br>
sodium azide at 37°C. The receiving fluid was replaced<br>
at selected time points with fresh buffer solution, and<br>
the removed buffer solution diluted 10-fold with PBS at<br>
pH 7.4 was analyzed for drug concentration by HPLC. The<br>
amount released at each time point was back calculated<br>
using a standard curve. Figure 5 shows the cumulative<br><br>
release of leuprolide for different formulations over<br>
time.<br>
[00127] As shown in Figure 5, the incorporation of<br>
Miglyol 812 did significantly reduced the initial burst<br>
release of leuprolide, and seem to maintain the release<br>
rate of leuprolide at later stages. Thus, Miglyol 812<br>
may be useful for extending the delivery of the peptide.<br>
Comparing to the results in Example 11, it seems the<br>
molecular weight of the polymer Also significantly<br>
affect the initial burst release of leuprolide. It<br>
seems that the smaller molecular weight of the PLA, the<br>
smaller the initial burst release rate of leuprolide.<br>
[00128] Example 13. In vivo release of leuprolide<br>
[00129] Poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) of an 85/15<br>
ratio of lactide to glycolide (DLPLG85/15, IV: 0.28)<br>
containing a lauryl ester end group was dissolved in N-<br>
methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) to give a 55% solution by<br>
weight. The leuprolide salt, i.e., Leuprolide mesylate<br>
or Leuprolide HCl, were mixed with the PLGA solution in<br>
NMP to give a uniform injectable formulation at a drug<br>
loading of about 12%. The injectable formulations were<br>
transferred into 1.2ml polypropylene syringes with luer-<br>
lock tips and a 19 gauge thin-wall needle attached.<br>
Each formulation was then injected into the rats<br>
subcutaneously at a volume of about 100μL with 6 animals<br>
per group. The serum samples were collected from each<br>
animal at 3 hour, 1, 3, 7, 14, 28, 42, 56, and 70 days<br>
post injection. The serum samples were analyzed for<br>
leuprolide concentration by ELISA using the kits<br>
available from Peninsula Laboratories Inc. The<br>
leuprolide remaining in the implants at various times<br>
was analyzed by HPLC.<br><br>
[00130] Figure 6 shows the release profile of<br>
leuprolide from two different formulations up to 70<br>
days. Both formulations showed initial burst release of<br>
leuprolide. The formulation containing LAHCl reached<br>
Cmax of 661.6 ng/mL at 3 hours, and the formulation<br>
containing LAMS reached Cmax of 370.6 ng/mL Also at 3<br>
hours. Both formulations showed sustained release of<br>
leuprolide over an extended time period. The<br>
formulation containing LAMS showed a more constant serum<br>
levels of leuprolide than that obtained from the<br>
formulation containing LAHCl.<br>
[00131] Example 14. In vivo release of leuprolide<br>
[00132] Poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) of a 85/15 ratio<br>
of lactide to glycolide (DLPLG85/15, IV: 0.27)<br>
containing a 1,6-hexanediol moiety is dissolved in N-<br>
methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) to give a 50% solution by<br>
weight. The leuprolide salt, i.e., Leuprolide acetate or<br>
Leuprolide HCl, are mixed with the PLGA solution in NMP<br>
to give a uniform injectable formulation at a drug<br>
loading of about 12%. The injectable formulations are<br>
transferred into 1.2ml polypropylene syringes with luer-<br>
lock tips and a 19 gauge thin-wall needle attached.<br>
Each formulation is then injected into the rats<br>
subcutaneously at a volume of about 100μL with 6 animals<br>
per group. The serum samples are collected from each<br>
animal at 3 hour, 1, 3, 7, 14, 28, 42, 56, 70, 91, 112,<br>
133, 154, 175, and 206 days post injection. The serum<br>
samples are analyzed for leuprolide concentration by<br>
ELISA using the kits available from Peninsula<br>
Laboratories Inc., and for testosterone concentration by<br>
LC/MS/MS. The leuprolide remaining in the implants at<br>
various times may be analyzed by HPLC.<br><br>
[00133] Similar experiments can be designed and<br>
performed using other LHRH analogues such as buserelin,<br>
deslorelin, fertirelin, histrelin, lutrelin, goserelin,<br>
nafarelin, triptorelin, cetrorelix, abarelix, and other<br>
peptides, such as GLP-1, PYY, etc, and other polymers<br>
and solvents.<br>
[00134] Example 15. Use of the stabilized injectable<br>
polymeric compositions<br>
[00135] The administration of the stabilized<br>
injectable polymeric composition to a patient may be<br>
accomplished in a number of ways. A biodegradable<br>
polymeric composition may be injected subcutaneously or<br>
intramuscularly to form an implant in situ, applied as a<br>
transdermal cream, and Also introduced to the patient as<br>
a rectal or vaginal suppository.<br>
[00136] Example 16. Preparation of polymer<br>
microspheres containing LAHCl<br>
[00137] Poly(lactide-co-glycolide (PLGA) microspheres<br>
are prepared by an oil-in-water (O/W) single emulsion<br>
technique. PLGA is dissolved in methylene chloride<br>
(DCM). For the encapsulation of LAHCl, the drug is mixed<br>
with the PLGA solution in DCM. The mixed solution or<br>
suspension is emulsified in 500 mL of 0.5-1% (w/v) PVA<br>
(PVA, 88% hydrolyzed, average molecular weight of<br>
31,000-50,000, Sigma-Aldrich) solution pre-cooled in the<br>
refrigerator at 4°C. The emulsion is stirred<br>
continuously for 3 h at RT to evaporate the DCM. The<br>
hardened microspheres are collected, washed three times<br>
with deionized water, and then freeze-dried.<br>
[00138] Example 17. Use of the stabilized liquid<br>
polymeric composition for preparing implantable polymer<br>
matrices<br><br>
[00139] The biodegradable polymer consisting of a<br>
poly-(lactic acid -co- glycolic acid) having a ratio of<br>
lactide to glycolide of 50:50 to 100:0 such as RG503H<br>
(Boehringer Ingelheim Chemicals, Inc. USA) is dissolved<br>
in a volatile organic solvent, such as ethyl acetate or<br>
methylene chloride. An appropriate amount of a<br>
beneficial salt as defined herein such as goserelin<br>
mesylate (0.01%-30% by weight relative to the polymer)<br>
is dissolved/dispersed in the polymer solution. The<br>
solution is thoroughly mixed to obtain a uniform<br>
solution or suspension. After the mixing is complete,<br>
the solvent is removed by evaporation. This is done by a<br>
spray drying procedure to form small uniform particles<br>
for injection. This can be done Also in a mold to form<br>
an implant. The resulting polymer matrices can Also be<br>
ground to a powder and formulated as an injectable<br>
suspension.<br>
[00140] Thus obtained solid dosage forms can be<br>
injected subcutaneously or intramuscularly, or can be<br>
placed surgically under the skin in the form of an<br>
implant, or given orally as part of an oral delivery<br>
system for peptide agents. The solid microparticles may<br>
also be prepared as a suspension or a non-aqueous<br>
solution, which may also be administered to a patient<br>
via inhalation, for pulmonary drug delivery. The<br>
microparticles may also be suspended in oil and<br>
introduced to the patient as a rectal or vaginal<br>
suppository.<br><br>
