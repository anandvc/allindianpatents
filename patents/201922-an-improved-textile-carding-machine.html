Technical Field<br>
This invention relates to an improved carding machine . The invention particularly relates to an improved carding machine comprising a sliver delivering machine and a can coiler which is coupled to the carding machine. The sliver delivering machine possessing a drive arrangement and the can coiler possessing its own separate drive arrangement, with means provided for synchronizing all the drive elements of the sliver delivering machine andean coiler in the pre determined rotational speeds<br>
Background Art<br>
In the textile preparatory process, the use of carding machine for opening and pre parallelizing of the fibre is well known. In such carding machines the fibre material is fed to the feeding arrangement of the carding machine in the form of flocks or laps. The fibre is opened and parallelized during its passage in the wire point clothed feed rollers, licker-in, cylinder and flat zone of the carding machine. The opened fibre is gathered from the cylinder by a doffer clothed with wire points and converted as a draftable sliver during subsequent passage through the take off and web gathering devices of the carding machine. The sliver thus produced is fed to a can coiler and deposited on to a revolving can kept underneath the revolving coiler plate.<br>
In order to draft the sliver and to deposit the sliver subsequently in to the sliver can , it is essential that all the rotating elements of the sliver supply device, namely, the carding machine and the sliver delivery device namely the coiler are to be run at a pre determined ratio, in synchronization.<br>
In known carding machines, the drive elements of the carding machine and the coiler are driven by common gear trains to attain the above requirement. Such a machine is shown in Fig 1 of the drawing accompanying this specification .<br><br>
The carding machine shown in figure 1 comprises a feeding device for example feeding chute which contains fibre material fed from a flock conveyor system, from which it forms a batt which is transferred to the feeding device of the carding machine. The carding machine is further provided with licker-in ,a cylinder ,set of revolving flats all of them are   normally driven by a motor.<br>
In addition a doffer ,pair of take off rollers , a redirecting roller , a pair of crush rollers , and pair of delivery calender rollers are provided ,which forms the delivery end elements of the carding machine. A sliver is formed at the delivery end of the carding machine and the same is drawn off by said pair of delivery calender rollers at a pre determined speed. The sliver delivered by the delivery end of the carding machine is fed to the can coiler attached to the carding machine. The can coiler is provided with a pair of coiler calander roller, revolving coiler and a revolving can plate. Generally the delivery end elements and the coiler elements are coupled together by gearing and driven by a motor such that the delivery end elements and the coiler elements are driven in synchronization.<br>
Due to the mechanical gearing between the carding machine and the can coiler the position of the can coiler relative to the carding machine is fixed. In other words , the location of the can coiler with reference to the carding machine cannot be varied . For example , if the construction of the machine is suitable for the placement of coiler at a particular position of the carding machine the can coiler cannot be located at any other position , if such positioning is required . Such a situation imposes restriction on the layout of the spinning mill.<br>
More over the mechanical gearing between the carding machine and the can coiler imposes restriction on the delivery speed of the carding machine.<br><br>
Indian patent 188106 describes a textile machine , carding machine in particular , in which separate drive arrangement is provided for the sliver supplying elements and yet another separate drive for the sliver coiler (can coiler), both the drive for the sliver supplying elements of the device as well as the drive for the sliver coiler (can coiler) comprises at least one frequency controlled rotary current motor and a common frequency converter for energizing said motors. Such a carding machine is shown in figure 2 .<br>
The drive of the delivery end elements is denoted by (80) which comprises a motor(83) which is energized by an inverter (84) attached to said motor (80).The output frequency of said inverter (84) is set by an input device (86) which is being connected to said inverter(84) and integrated in the card programmable controller (88). Driver motor (100) drives the working elements of the top section of the coiler directly and indirectly drive the working elements of the base section of the coiler through drive (102) and a transmission medium (104). Said drive motor (lOO)is also connected to said inverter (84) and energized. The slip behavior of motor (100) being the same as the corresponding behavior of said motor (83) due to the fact that both it is determined by same operating parameters. Since the said motor (83) and (100) being energized by the same inverter (84) the drive elements attached to the said motors (83) and (100) run in synchronization.<br>
Though the motors (83) and (100) can drive the drive the delivery end drive elements and coiler drive elements in synchronization an error in mismatch can occur due to the difference in the acceleration and deceleration of the said motors (83) and (100).This will cause variation in the tension draft between the calendar roller of the carding machine and the calendar roller of the coiler.<br>
Normally the tension draft is applied between delivery rollers of the carding machine and the coiler calendar rollers for proper transfer and coiling of the sliver. It is observed in practice that always there remains   variation in actual<br><br>
tension draft and the applied tension draft due the behavior of the fibre material being processed and the slip in the drive system.<br>
Though with the arrangement described in Indian patent 188106 it is possible to locate the can coiler as per the mill lay out requirement, the system necessitates the usage of change wheels to control the tension draft between the delivery rollers of the carding machine and the coiler calendar rollers when used with single inverter and necessitates relative adjustment of the required tension   from time to time ,when two inverters are used.<br>
It will be advantageous if the can coiler could be placed at any desired location in relation to the carding machine as per the requirement of mill layout.<br>
It is the main objective of the present invention to provide an improved carding machine in which the coiler can be located at any desired position in relation to the carding machine .<br>
It is another objective of the present invention to provide an improved carding machine provided with an independent drive arrangement for the delivery end elements and an independent drive arrangement for the coiler elements with means provided for automatically compensating the variation in the tension draft.<br>
The details of the present invention is described with reference to the figures 3,4 and 5.<br>
In the drawings<br>
Figure 3 represents the   schematic view of the carding machine  and the can<br>
coiler according to the present invention.<br>
Figure 4 represents the schematic view of the can coiler having it's own separate drive<br><br>
Figure 5 represents the schematic view of the drive arrangement of the delivery end elements of the carding machine and the drive arrangement of coiler elements of the can coiler according to the present invention.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved textile carding machine which comprises delivery end elements (D) and coiler elements ( C ) associated with it, said delivery end elements (D) being provided with a separate drive arrangement ( A) comprising motor (Ml) and gearing ( Gl ), the said motor (Ml) being connected to an inverter(21), the said inverter (21) being connected to a programmable logic control ( 22 ) ; the said coiler elements ( C ) being provided with another drive arrangement ( B ) comprising motor (M2) and gearing ( G2 ) ,the said motor (M2) being connected to another inverter (24 ) , said inverter (24) being connected to another programmable logic control (25 ) ; said programmable logic controls ( 22,25 ) being connected to a display unit ( 28 ) ; a tension monitor (27 ) being provided in the sliver passage between delivery calender rollers ( 13,13') and coiler calender rolier( 19,19' ) and the said tension monitor ( 27 ) being connected to the said programmable logic control(25).<br>
The said tension monitor(27) senses the tension/slackness of the sliver (12) and input signal to programmable logic control (25 ) in the form of analogue/digital voltage. The said programmable logic control (25 ) modifies the voltage of said inverter (24 ) to regulate the speed of said motor (M2 ) there by regulating the rotational speed of said coiler calender roller(19,19'), said coiler (18) and said revolving can plate .<br><br>
Details of the Invention<br>
The carding machine (CM) with a can coiler (CC) associated with it is schematically shown is figure 3 .The carding machine (CM) comprises a feeding device for example feeding chute (1 ) which contains fibre material fed from a flock conveyor system (2 ) , from which it forms a batt (3 ) which is transferred to the feed rollers (4 ). In addition to the said feed roller (4), the carding machine (CM) is further provided with licker-in (5), cylinder (6) and set of revolving flats (7) which are being driven by one or more motors in known way.<br>
The carding machine (CM) is further provided a doffer (8 ). In addition to the said doffer (8 ), pair of take off rollers (9,9' ), a redirecting roller (10 ) and a pair of crush rollers (11 ,11' ) and pair of delivery calender rollers (13,13') are provided ,which forms the delivery end elements of the carding machine (D)<br>
A sliver (12 ) is formed at the delivery end and the same is drawn off by said pair of delivery calender rollers (13,13') at a pre determined speed. The sliver delivered by the delivery calender rollers (13,13') of the carding machine (CM) is fed to the can coiler (CC ).<br>
The can coiler (CC) schematically shown in figure 4 essentially comprises a frame (14 ), a top section(15 ) a bottom section (16 ), can plate (17 ) at the bottom section, a coiler (18 ) in the top section and a pair of coiler calender roller (19,19') above the said coiler(18). A sliver can (20 ) is positioned on the said can plate(17) to receive the sliver from the said coiler (18). The said can<br><br>
plate(17) and the said coiler(18) are rotated in vertical axis by means of the drive arrangement of the can coiler (CC). Also the said coiler calender roller ( 19,19') arranged in a horizontal longitudinal axis are driven by the can coiler drive system. The sliver delivered by the said delivery calender roller (13,13') pair of the carding machine is fed to the said pair of revolving coiler calender roller(19,19') and subsequently fed to the said coiler(18) and laid down in coils in the said revolving sliver can(20).<br>
Figure 5 schematically illustrates the drive arrangement according to the invention . The delivery end elements of the carding machine including delivery calander rollers (13,13') represented by (A ) being driven by a motor ( Ml ) through gearing (Gl) . The said motor (Ml) , which may be preferably a 3 phase asynchronous induction motor being connected to an inverter (21), said inverter being connected to a programmable logic control (22) , said programmable logic control (22) being provided to apply pre selected voltage to the said inverter (21). Sensor (23 ) which may be a proximity sensor or encoder provided to monitor the rotational speed of the said delivery calender roller ( 13) and connected to the said programmable logic control (22), the said sensor (23 ) inputs signal to the said programmable logic control (22 ) in the form of analogue or digital voltage. This feed back signal compares the actual speed of delivery calendar roller (13) against set value and the said programmable logic control ( 22 ) regulates the speed of the motor (Ml ) through inverter (21). The said programmable logic control (22 ) being connected to a display unit (28) to input the preset values to the said inverter (21).<br>
The coiler elements of the can coiler comprising can plate (17 ), the coiler (18) and the coiler calender roller (19,19' ) is represented by (B) and being driven by yet another motor (M2 ), which may be preferably a 3 phase asynchronous induction motor, through gearing G2. The said motor (M2) being cormected to an inverter (24), said inverter being connected to a programmable logic control<br><br>
(25) , said programmable logic control (25) being provided to apply pre selected voltage to the said inverter (24). Sensor (26 ) which may be a proximity sensor or encoder provided to monitor the rotational speed of the said coiler (18) and connected to the said programmable logic control (25), the said sensor (26 ) inputs signal to the said programmable logic control (25) in the form of analogue or digital voltage. This feed back signal compares the actual speed of the said coiler (18) against set value and the said programmable logic control ( 25 ) regulates the speed of the said motor (M2 ) through inverter (24). The said programmable logic control (25 ) being connected to a display unit (28) to input the preset values to the said inverter (24)<br>
Although pre set values can give smooth running of the rotating elements an error in mismatch can occur due to difference in the acceleration and deceleration of the said motors (Ml) and (M2). This will cause variation in the tension draft between the said calander rollers (13,13') and coiler calander rollers (19,19') . Hence tension monitor(27) is provided in the region of sliver between the said delivery calender roller (13,13' ) and coiler calender roller(19,19'). The said tension monitor (27) senses the excess tension/slackness in the sliver and input the signal to the said programmable logic control (25 ) in the form of analogue/digital voltage. The tension monitor (27) used in the invention may be a photo electric sensor. It may be a lever operated actuator or a capacitor. The said programmable logic control(25) modifies the voltage applied to the said inverter (24 ) and regulates the speed of the said motor (M2 ) to compensate the variation in tension sensed.<br>
A display unit ( 28) being attached to the said programmable logic control ( 22) and ( 25) to input the preset values of voltage to the said inverter (21 ) and (24 )   in accordance with the production requirement ,from the library in the said programmable logic control ( 22) and ( 25) .<br><br>
Working of the invention<br>
The motor (Ml) attached to the delivery end drive elements D of the carding machine (CM) is set at a pre determined rotational speed .The sliver delivered by pair of delivery calander rollers (13,13') of the delivery end is feed to the nip of the coiler calender roller (19,19') through the tension monitor (27) The relative distance between the sliver (12) and tension monitor (27) is pre determined. Coiler calender roller (19,19') being driven by motor (M2) attached to the can coiler drive elements C at the pre determined rotational speed. The variation is the ratio of rotational speed of the delivery calender roller (13,13') and coiler calender roller (19,19') results in sagging /over tensioning of the sliver(12) in the region between delivery calender rollers (13,13') and coiler calander roller (19,19'). This results in the alteration of distance between the sliver (12) and tension monitor (27). The above variation is sensed by said tension monitor (27) which sends corresponding signal to the programmable logic control (25) which suitably modify the voltage applied to the inverter (24). By this arrangement the rotational speed of the delivery calander roller (13,13') is altered to compensate the sagging /over tensioning of the sliver(12). This facilitates maintaining of the draft between the delivery calender roller (13,13') and coiler calender roller (19,19') as per the requirement.<br>
