Technical Field<br>
[002] The disclosure relates to prodrugs of acyloxyalkyl carbamate trans-4-<br>
(aminomethyl)-cyclohexanecarboxylic acid, pharmaceutical compositions thereof,<br>
methods of making prodrugs of trans-4-(aminomethyl)-cyclohexane-carboxylic acid,<br>
and methods of using prodrugs of trans-4-(aminomethyl)-cyclohexanecarboxylic acid<br>
and pharmaceutical compositions thereof to treat various diseases or disorders. The<br>
disclosure also relates to such prodrugs suitable for oral and topical administration<br>
including for oral administration using sustained release dosage forms.<br>
Background<br>
[003] Tranexamic acid (1) (trans-4-aminomethyl)-cyclohexanecarboxylic<br>
acid, Cyklokapron®):<br><br>
is an antifibrinolytic agent that reversibly blocks lysine binding sites on plasminogen<br>
and plasmin, and acts to prevent proteolytic degradation of fibrin clots which form in<br>
the normal physiologic process of hemostasis. Both plasminogen and plasmin are<br>
activators of fibrinolysis and active clot-lysing agents. Tranexamic acid thus helps to<br><br>
stabilize fibrin clots, which in turn maintains coagulation and helps to control<br>
bleeding.<br>
[004] Tranexamic acid is used clinically to control excess bleeding, for<br>
example, heavy bleeding associated with cardiac surgery, upper gastrointestinal<br>
hemorrhage, blood loss in patients with advanced cancer (both acute hemorrhagic<br><br>
events and low-volume chronic bleeding), excessive bleeding that occurs during<br>
dental procedures in hemophiliacs, and for heavy bleeding during<br>
menstruation,i.e.,menorrhagia {see Wellington and Wagstaff, Drugs, 2003, 63,1417-<br>
1433; Dunn and Goa, Drugs, 1999,57,1005-1032; Pereira and Phan, The Oncologist,<br>
2004,9, 561-570).<br>
[005] The importance of the plasminogen / plasmin proteolytic cascade in<br>
epidermal biology and pathophysiology is also well appreciated (Kramer et al, Biol.<br>
Chem. Hoppe-Seylar, 1995,3,131-141). Disruption of the stratum corneumby<br>
mechanical or chemical injury induces epidermal proteolytic activity. Topical<br>
treatment of human or rodent skin with tranexamic acid significantly accelerates<br>
barrier recovery and greatly decreases epidermal hyperplasia, suggesting a role for<br>
plasmin inhibitory compounds in promoting epidermal wound healing (Denda et al,<br>
J. Invest. Dermatol, 1997,109,84-90; Kitamura et al, J. Soc. Cosmet. Chem., 1995,<br>
29,133-145). Exposure of human skin to ultraviolet radiation causes erythema and<br>
pigmentation, with pigmentation resulting from increased melanin production. A role<br>
for plasmin in contributing to increased production of arachidonic acid and<br>
prostaglandin metabolites in skin following U.V. exposure has also been<br>
demonstrated. Topical application of tranexamic acid prevents U.V.-induced<br>
pigmentation in vivo through dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin production<br>
(Maeda and Naganuma,/. Photochem. Photobiol. B, 1998,47,136-141; Manosroi et<br>
al, J. Cosmet. Sci., 2002,53, 375-386; Suetsugu et al, U.S. Patent No. 5,690,914).<br>
[006] The plasminogen activation system is also a predominant protease<br>
pathway responsible for extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation. Cancer<br>
dissemination and metastasis is synonymous with invasive cell migration, a process in<br>
which the ECM plays the dual role of the substratum on which the cells move as well<br>
as the physical obstacle that the cells have to surpass. To degrade the physical<br>
obstacle that the ECM poses in the direction of migration, cells use proteolytic<br>
enzymes such as plasminogen and plasmin capable of hydrolyzing the ECM<br>
components (Stonelake et al, Br. J. Cancer, 1997, 75, 951-959; Dunbar et al, Expert<br>
Opin. Investig. Drugs, 2000,9,2085-2092; Sidenius andBlasi, Cancer Metastasis<br>
Rev., 2003,22,205-222). Plasmin inhibitory compounds such as tranexamic acid,<br>
therefore, show utility as anti-metastatic agents either alone or in combination with<br>
cytotoxic anticancer agents (Tsutsumi and Konisbi, Jpn. Kokai Tokkyo Koho,<br>
2002114673).<br><br>
[007] Menorrhagia is defined as blood loss &gt;80 mL per menstrual cycle and<br>
affects many women and represents a significant health problem. Prevalence rates are<br>
believed to be similar across the Western world, and in the U.K. at least one in 20<br>
women aged between 34 and 49 years will consult their general practitioners because<br>
of menstrual disorders. Menorrhagia accounts for 60% of primary-care consultations<br>
for menstrual problems and 12% of all gynecology referrals (Peto et al, Fain. Pract.,<br>
1993,10,207-211; McPherson and Andersson, eds., Women's problems in general<br>
practice, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1983, pp 21-41; Bradlow et al, Patterns<br>
of referral, Oxford: Oxford Health Services Research Unit, 1992). While various<br>
pathological mechanisms may contribute to the cause of menorrhagia, approximately<br>
50% of women with heavy menstrual blood loss have no underlying anatomical or<br>
endocrinological abnormality. In such women fibrinolytic activity in utero is higher<br>
than in women with normal menstrual blood loss, with this increased fibrinolysis<br>
resulting from elevated levels of endometrium-derived plasmin and plasminogen<br>
activators (Gleeson, Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol, 1994,171,178-183; Dockeray et al,<br>
Eur. J. Obstet. Gynecol. Reprod. Biol, 1987,24,309-318).<br>
[008] Despite the availability of clinically effective antifibrinolytic agents<br>
such as tranexamic acid (which has been shown to reduce menstrual blood loss by<br>
~50%), approximately 60% of women with menorrhagia undergo hysterectomy<br>
within 5 years of referral to a gynecologist (Coulter et al, Br. J. Obstet. Gynaecol,<br>
1991,98, 789-796). Women suffering from menorrhagia are typically treated orally<br>
with tranexamic acid concurrently with menstruation (4-7 days). Doses of 500-1500<br>
mg tranexamic acid tablets administered three or four times daily are typical.<br>
Intravenous dosage formulations are also available for use as a continuous infusion in<br>
the surgical setting. The requirement for frequent daily oral administration results<br>
from the suboptimal pharmacokinetic properties of tranexamic acid, which includes<br>
modest oral bioavailability (~30%) and a rapid terminal elimination half-life of ~2<br>
hours.<br>
[009] Sustained released oral dosage formulations are a conventional<br>
solution to the problem of rapid systemic drug clearance, as is well known in the art<br>
(See, e.g., "Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences," Philadelphia College of Pharmacy<br>
and Science, 19th Edition, 1995). Osmotic delivery systems are also recognized<br>
methods for sustained drug delivery (see e.g., Verma et al, DrugDev. Ind. Pharm.,<br>
2000,26,695-708). Successful application of these technologies depends on the drug<br><br>
of interest having an effective level of absorption from the large intestine (also<br>
referred to herein as the colon), where the dosage form spends a majority of its time<br>
during its passage through the gastrointestinal tract. Tranexamic acid is poorly<br>
absorbed following rectal administration in humans (Aimer et al., J. Clin. Pharm.,<br>
1992,32,49-54), consistent with limited permeability of the drug across the colonic<br>
mucosa. Development of an oral controlled release formulation for tranexamic acid<br>
should considerably improve the convenience, efficacy and side effect profile of<br>
tranexamic acid therapy. However, the rapid passage of conventional dosage forms<br>
through the proximal absorptive region of the small intestine has thus far prevented<br>
the successful application of sustained release technologies to this drug. Heasley et<br>
al. have described delayed release oral formulations of tranexamic acid based on the<br>
use of enteric polymer coatings that are designed to retard the dissolution of the drug<br>
by 1-2 hours until the dosage form has passed from the stomach to the small intestine<br>
(U.S. Patent Application No. 2005/002825). Such formulations are said to reduce the<br>
adverse gastrointestinal reactions that may accompany oral tranexamic acid therapy<br>
(including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dyspepsia and cramping). However these<br>
formulations would not be expected to substantially alter the elimination half-life of<br>
the drug, and hence overcome the requirement for frequent daily dosing.<br>
[0010] There is a significant need for new prodrugs of tranexamic acid that are<br>
well absorbed in the large intestine and hence suitable for oral sustained release<br>
formulations, thus improving the convenience, efficacy and side effect profile of<br>
antifibrinolytic therapy. Moreover, since the zwitterionic character of tranexamic acid<br>
limits the permeability of the compound across the epidermal barrier, there is also a<br>
need for more lipophilic prodrug derivatives of tranexamic acid which would provide<br>
for more effective topical administration in the treatment of skin disorders such as<br>
wound healing, epidermal hyperplasia, skin roughening, unwanted skin pigmentation,<br>
etc.<br>
[0011] One solution to the incomplete gastrointestinal absorption of<br>
tranexamic acid is through design of prodrug derivatives (see Svahn et al., J. Med.<br>
Chem., 1986,29,448-453; Svahn et al., European Patent No. 0 079 872 Bl; Svahn et<br>
al., U.S. Patent No. 4,483,867; Jonsson, International Publication No. WO94/15904;<br>
Svahn et al, Arzneim-Forsch., 1988,38,735-738; Edlund et al., Br. J. Obstet.<br>
Gynaecol, 1995,102,913-917). The prodrug l-(ethoxycarbonyl)oxyethyl trans-4-<br>
(aminomethyl)-cyclohexanecarboxylate (i.e.,Kabi 2161) showed markedly improved<br><br>
oral bioavailability of tranexamic acid in human patients, and was effective in<br>
reducing menstrual blood loss in women suffering from idiopathic menorrhagja.<br>

[00124] Intermediate (V), useful in the preparation of 1-haloalkyl carbamates<br>
of Formula (DQ, may be generated according to the reactions detailed in Scheme 1:<br><br>
[00125] The amino group of tranexamic acid is protected under standard<br>
conditions with a protecting group (Pg) to afford compound (VII). The carboxylic<br>
acid moiety of compound (VII) is esterified to yleld compound (Vm), either via<br>
alkylation or silylation wiui R4-X, where X is selected from fiuoro, chloro, bromo,<br>
iodo, and R20SO3- wherein R20 is selected from Q-6 alkyl, C5.7 aryl, and substituted<br>
C5.7 aryl, or any other suitable leaving group, or via condensation with alcohol R4-OH<br><br>
under standard acylation conditions (e.g., in the presence of a coupling agent such as a<br>
carbodiimide, via an acyl halide, acid anhydride, or other activated ester<br>
intermediate). Removal of the protecting group from compound (Vlll) under<br>
standard deprotection conditions affords compound (V).<br>
[00126] In certain embodiments, a compound of Formula (H) is prepared by<br>
acylation of compound (V) with compound (IX) (see Scheme 2), where X is a halide<br>
and Z is a leaving group (e.g, halide, jp-nitrophenolate, imidazolyl, etc.). In certain<br>

Suitable solvents for acylation include, but are not limited to, dichloromethane,<br>

including one or more of dichloromethane, dichloroethane, chloroform, toluene, ethyl<br>
acetate, isopropyl acetate, or methyl tert-butyl ether, can be utilized. Temperatures<br>
for performing the reaction of Scheme 2 can range from about -20 °C to about 50 °C,<br>
and in certain embodiments can range from about -20 °C to about 25 °C.<br><br>
[00127] In certain embodiments, a compound of Formula (IT), where R4 is<br>
triaikylsilyl or aryldialkylsilyl, can be prepared directly from tranexamic acid by<br><br>
silylation (e.g., using a silyl halide or silylamide reagent) followed by acylation of the<br>
resulting intermediate with compound (EX) (see Scheme 3). Suitable solvents for<br>
performing mis reaction include, but are not limited to, dichloromethane,<br>
dichloroethane, chloroform, toluene, pyridine, acetonitrile, and combinations of any<br>
of the foregoing. Suitable bases for performing this reaction include but are not<br>
limited to, triethylamine, tributylamine, diisopropylethylamine,<br>
dimethylisopropylamine, //-methylmorpholine, i^-methylpyrrolidine,<br>
iV-methylpiperidine, pyridine, 2-methylpyridine, 2,6-dimethylpyridine,<br>
4-dimethylaminopyridine, l,4-diazabicyclo[2.2J2]octane, 1,<br>
8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene, l,5-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]undec-7-ene, and<br>
combinations of any of the foregoing. Temperatures for performing the reaction of<br>
Scheme 3 can range from about -78 °C to about 50 °C, and in certain embodiments<br>
can range from about -20 °C to about 25 °C.<br><br>
[00128] In certain embodiments, iV-1-acyloxylalkyl carbamates of Formula (I)<br>

and combinations of any of the foregoing. In certain embodiments, the metal salt can<br>
be a salt of Ag, Hg, Na, K, Li, Cs, Ca, Mg, Zn, and combinations of any of the<br>
foregoing.<br>
[00132] In certain embodiments of the method of Scheme 4, compounds of<br>
Formulae (II) and (IDT) and an organic base are contacted with a solvent. In certain<br>
embodiments in which a compound of Formula (II), a compound of Formula (HI) and<br>
an organic base are contacted with a solvent, the ratio of a compound of Formula (H)<br>
to a compound of Formula (HI) can range from about 1:1 to about 1:20, in certain<br>

[00133] In some embodiments of the method of Scheme 4, a compound of<br>
Formula (ID) is a liquid under the conditions of contacting with a compound of<br>
Formula (II), and the compound of Formula (HI) further serves as a solvent for the<br>
reaction with a compound of Formula (H). m certain embodiments, a compound of<br>

acid, butyric acid, isobutyric acid, pivalic acid, valeric acid, isovaleric acid,<br>
2-methylbutyric acid, cyclobutanecarboxylic acid, cyclopentanecarboxylic acid, or<br>

[00134] In some embodiments of the method of Scheme 4, a compound of<br>

temperature ranging from about -25 °C to about 120 °C. In certain embodiments, the<br>

[00135] In certain other embodiments of the method of Scheme 4, a compound<br>
of Formula (H), a compound of Formula (HI), and#an organic base can be contacted<br>
at a temperature ranging from about -25 °C to about 120 °C. In certain embodiments,<br>
the temperature can range from about 0 °C to about 25 °C.<br>
[00136] In some embodiments of the method of Scheme 4, a compound of<br>
Formula (II), a compound of Formula (Til), and an organic base can be contacted<br>
with a catalytic amount of an iodide salt. In certain embodiments, the iodide salt can<br>
be sodium iodide, potassium iodide, tetramethylammonium iodide,<br>
tetraethylammonium iodide, or tetrabutylammonium iodide.<br>
[00137] In some embodiments of the method of Scheme 4, R4 can be a<br>
carboxylic acid protecting group that can be removed under mild conditions to<br>
provide a compound of Formula (I) where R4 is hydrogen. Carboxylic acid protecting<br><br>
groups removable via mild acidic hydrolysis, fluoride ion-promoted hydrolysis,<br>
catalytic hydrogenolysis, transfer hydrogenolysis, or other transition metal-mediated<br>
deprotection reactions can be used. In some embodiments, R4 can be trimethylsilyl,<br>
allyl, or benzyl.<br>
[00138] In certain embodiments, a compound of Formula (I) can be prepared as<br>
illustrated in Scheme 5.<br><br>
[00139] Chloroformate (X) is treated with an aromatic leaving group such as<br>
p-nitrophenol in the presence of base to provide/i-nitrophenylcarbonate (XI). Halide<br>
interchange provides iodide (Xn), which is reacted with a metal or<br>
tetraalkylammonium salt of a carboxylic acid to afford compound (XUI). Treatment<br>
of (XEQ) with tranexamic acid derivative (V), optionally in the presence of<br>
trimethylsilyl chloride, affords a compound of Formula (I). Methods for making<br>
related acyloxyalkyl carbamate compounds are described in the art (e.g., Alexander,<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,760,057; Alexander, U.S. Patent No. 4,916,230; Alexander, U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,466,811; Alexander, U.S. Patent No. 5,684,018).<br>
[00140] Another method for synthesis of compounds of Formula (I) proceeds<br>
via carbonylation of tranexamic acid derivative (V) to an intermediate carbamic acid<br>
species, which is captured by an in situ alkylation reaction in an adaptation of<br>
methods disclosed in the art (Butcher, Synlett, 1994, 825-6; Ferres et al., U.S. Patent<br><br>
4,036,829). Carbon dioxide gas is bubbled into a solution containing tranexamic acid<br>
derivative (V) and a base (e.g., CS2CQ3, Ag2C03, or AgO) in a solvent such as DMF<br>
or NMP. An activated halide is added, optionally, in the presence of iodide ion as a<br>
catalyst, and the carbonylation continued until the reaction is completed. This method<br>
is illustrated in Scheme 6 for the preparation of a compound of Formula (I) from<br>
halide (XIV).<br><br>
[00141] Yet another method for synthesis of a compound of Formula <t relies></t>
upon oxidation of ketocarbamate derivatives of tranexamic acid (e.g., Gallop et al,<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,927,036; and Bhat et al, U.S. Application Publication No.<br>
2005/0070715). As illustrated in Scheme 7, oxidation of ketocarbamate (XV) affords<br>
a compound of Formula (I). Methods for synthesis of a compound of Formula (XV)<br>
are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,927,036 and U.S. Application Publication No.<br>
2005/0070715. Examples of oxidants useful in the method of Scheme 6 include those<br>
successfully used in Baeyer-Villager oxidations of ketones to esters or lactones<br>
(Strukul, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., 1998,37,1198; Renz., Eur. J. Org. Chem., 1999, 4,<br>
737-50; Beller et al, in "Transition Metals in Organic Synthesis" Chapter 2, Wiley<br>
VCH; Stewart, Current Organic Chemistry, 1998,2, 195; Kayser et al, Synlett, 1999,<br>
153). The use of anhydrous oxidants can be beneficial since prodrugs of Formula (I)<br>
may be labile. Thus, performing the oxidation under anhydrous reaction conditions<br>
can avoid hydrolysis of the reactive products.<br>
Scheme 7<br><br><br>
In certain embodiments of compounds of Formulae (I) and (XV) in the method of<br>
Scheme 7, R1 is selected from acyl, substituted acyl, alkyl, substituted alkyl, aryl,<br>
substituted aryl, arylalkyl, substituted arylalkyl, cycloalkyl, substituted cycloalkyl,<br>
cycloheteroalkyl, substituted cycloheteroalkyl, heteroalkyl, substituted heteroalkyl,<br>
heteroaryl, substituted heteroaryl, heteroarylalkyl, and substituted heteroarylalkyl. In<br>
certain embodiments of compounds of Formulae (I) and (XV), R2 and R3 are<br>
independently selected from hydrogen, alkyl, substituted alkyl, alkoxycarbonyl,<br>
substituted alkoxycarbonyl, aryl, substituted aryl, arylalkyl, substituted arylalkyl,<br>
carbamoyl, substituted carbamoyl, cycloalkyl, substituted cycloalkyl, heteroalkyl,<br>
substituted heteroalkyl, heteroaryl, substituted heteroaryl, heteroarylalkyl, and<br>
substituted heteroarylalkyl, or R2 and R3 together with the atom to which they are<br>
bonded form a cycloalkyl, substituted cycloalkyl, cycloheteroalkylor substituted<br>
cycloheteroalkyl ring. In certain embodiments of compounds of Formulae (I) and<br>
(XV), R4 is selected from hydrogen, alkyl, substituted alkyl, aryl, substituted aryl,<br>
arylalkyl, substituted arylalkyl, aryldialkylsilyl, substituted aryldialkylsilyl,<br>
cycloalkyl, substituted cycloalkyl, cycloheteroalkyl, substituted cycloheteroalkyl,<br>
heteroalkyl, substituted heteroalkyl, heteroaryl, substituted heteroaryl, heteroarylalkyl,<br>
substituted heteroarylalkyl, trialkylsilyl, and substituted trialkylsilyl. In certain<br>
embodiments of compounds of Formulae (I) and (XV), each substituent group of R1,<br>
R2, R3, and/or R4 is independently selected from at least one of C1-3 alkyl, -OH, -<br>
NH2, C1-3 alkoxy, C1-3 acyl, C1-3 thioalkyl, C1-3 alkoxycarbonyl, C1-3 alkylamino, and<br>
C1-3 dialkylarnino.<br>
[00142] In certain embodiments of compounds of Formulae (I) and (XV) in the<br>
method of Scheme 7, R1 is selected from methyl, ethyl, /i-propyl, isopropyl, ra-butyl,<br>
isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, phenyl, o-tolyl, and cyclohexyl, R2 is hydrogen, R3 is<br>
selected from hydrogen, methyl, ethyl, w-propyl, isopropyl, phenyl, and cyclohexyl,<br>
and R4 is hydrogen.<br><br>
[00143] In the method of Scheme 7 oxidation can be performed in the liquid<br>
phase, and in certain embodiments, in the presence of a solvent. Choosing a solvent<br>
for oxidation of a compound of Formula (XV) is well within the ambit of one of skill<br>
in the art Generally, a useful solvent will dissolve, at least partially, both the oxidant<br>
and a compound of Formula (XV) and will be inert to the reaction conditions. Useful<br>
solvents can be anhydrous and include, but are not limited to, dichloromethane,<br>
dichloroethane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, toluene, chlorobenzene,<br>
xylene, acetonitrile, diethyl ether, methyl terf-butyl ether, acetic acid, cyclohexane,<br>
and hexanes. Combinations of the above solvents can also be used in the oxidation of<br>
a compound of Formula (XV) to a compound of Formula (I).<br>
[00144] In some embodiments, the anhydrous oxidant is an anhydrous<br>
peroxyacid generated in situ by reaction of a urea-hydrogen peroxide complex (UHP)<br>
with a carboxylic acid anhydride. In certain embodiments, the anhydrous oxidant is<br>
an anhydrous peroxysulfonic acid generated in situ by reaction of a urea-hydrogen<br>
peroxide complex with a sulfonic acid anhydride. The UHP complex serves as a<br>
source of anhydrous hydrogen peroxide and has been used in a variety of oxidative<br>
transformations, in anhydrous organic solvents (Cooper et al, Synlett., 1990, 533-535;<br>
Balicki era/., Synth. Commun., 1993,23,3149; AstadiUo et al.,Heterocycles, 1993,<br>
36,1075-1080; Varmaete/a/., Org. Lett., 1999, /, 189-191). However, other suitable<br>
sources of anhydrous hydrogen peroxide can also be used in the reaction instead of<br>
the UHP-complex (e.g., the l,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane-hydrogen peroxide<br>
complex).<br>
[00145] A useful oxidant is anhydrous peroxytrifluoroacetic acid, generated in<br>
situ by reacting the UHP-complex with trifiuoroacetic anhydride (Cooper et al,<br>
Synlett., 1990,533-535; Benjamin, et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc, 2002,124, 827-833).<br>
Anhydrous peroxycarboxylic acids (XVII) can be prepared by treating carboxylic<br>
acid anhydrides (XVI) with anhydrous hydrogen peroxide, and in certain<br>
embodiments, with the UHP-complex. Similarly, anhydrous peroxysulfonic acids<br>
(XIX) can be prepared by reacting sulfonic acid anhydrides (XVIII) with anhydrous<br>
hydrogen peroxide, and in certain embodiments, with the UHP-complex. Preparation<br>
of anhydrous peroxycarboxylic acids (XVII) and peroxysulfonic acids (XIX) is<br>
illustrated in Scheme 8.<br><br><br>
[00146] The UHP-complex and a carboxylic acid anhydride (XVI) or a sulfonic<br>
acid anhydride (XVIII) can be reacted in dichloromethane or other suitable solvent at<br>
temperatures ranging from about -25 °C to about 100 °C to generate the<br>
corresponding anhydrous peroxyacid oxidant. The peroxyacid oxidant can be<br>
generated first and subsequently reacted with a ketocarbamate (XV). In some<br>
embodiments, a carboxylic acid anhydride (XVI) is added to a stirred suspension or<br>
solution containing the UHP-complex and a ketocarbamate (XV) to generate the<br>
peroxycarboxylic acid, which reacts in situ with the ketocarbamate (XV) to give<br>
compound (I). In certain embodiments^ the molar ratio of UHP-complex and<br>
carboxylic acid anhydride (XVI) is about 6:1. In certain embodiments, the molar<br>
ratio of UHP-complex and carboxylic acid anhydride (XVI) can range from about 5:1<br><br>
to about 1:1. In certain embodiments, the molar ratio of UHP-complex and acid<br>
anhydride (XVI) can range from about 2:1 to about 1:1.<br>
[00147] In some embodiments of the method of Scheme 8, the molar ratio of<br>
the peroxyacid oxidant to a compound of Formula (XV) can range from about 8:1 to<br>
about 1:1. In certain embodiments, the molar ratio of the peroxyacid oxidant to a<br>
compound of Formula (XV) can range from about 4:1 to about 1:1. In certain<br>
embodiments, the molar ratio of the peroxyacid oxidant to a compound of Formula<br>
(XV) can range from about 2:1 to about 1:1. In certain embodiments, when the<br>
oxidant is peroxytrifluoroacetic acid or another substituted peroxyacetic acid, the<br>
molar ratio of the peroxyacid oxidant to a compound of Formula (XV) is about 2:1.<br>
[00148] Further, in the method of Scheme 8 the use of additives in the<br>
oxidation of a compound of Formula (XV) to a compound of Formula (I) is also<br>
contemplated. For example, additives can either catalyze the reaction or stabilize the<br>
final product or botii. In some embodiments, a Lewis acid or a protic acid or any<br>
combination of Lewis acid or protic acid can be used in the oxidation of a compound<br>
of Formula (XV) and in certain embodiments, in the presence of a solvent Examples<br>
of Lewis acids include, but are not limited to, BF3, SeC&gt;2, MeRe03, MuC^, SnCLt,<br>
Sc(OTf)3, Ti(0-iPr)4, AI2O3, and Fe2<i>3. Examples of protic acids include, but are not<br>
limited to, trifluoroacetic acid, acetic acid,p-toluenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic<br>
acid, trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, hydrochloric acid, and sulfuric acid. In certain<br>
embodiments, the Lewis acid and/or protic acid can catalyze oxidation by increasing<br>
the electrophilicity of the carbonyl group in Formula (XV).<br>
[00149] In certain embodiments of the method of Scheme 8, the oxidation can<br>
be conducted in the presence of an anhydrous base. In certain embodiments, the base<br>
can stabilize acid sensitive products by reacting with acidic by-products formed<br>
during oxidation.<br>
[00150] Generally, in the method of Scheme 8 the temperature of the reaction<br>
can be optimized by methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art. In certain<br>
embodiments, the oxidation of a compound of Formula (XV) can be carried out at a<br>
temperature ranging from about -25 °C to about 100 °C, and in certain embodiments,<br>
from about 0 °C to about 25 CC.<br>
[00151] A feature of this method of synthesis of a compound of Formula (I) is<br>
that oxidation of a ketocarbamate derivative (XV) proceeds stereospecifically, with<br><br>
retention of configuration at the carbon atom initially adjacent to the carbonyl group<br>
in the ketocarbamate derivative (XV). This stereospecificity can be exploited in a<br>
stereoselective synthesis of prodrug derivatives of Formula (I).<br>
[00152] Another method for synthesis of a compound of Formula (I),<br>
illustrated in Scheme 9, relies upon reaction of tranexamic acid, or a compound of<br>
Formula (V), with a l-(acyloxy)-alkyl N-hydtoxysuccinimidyl carbonate compound<br>
of Formula (TV), as described in the co-pending application Gallop et al, U.S.<br>

acylcarnitines, and the like can be added.<br>
[00164] For topical formulations of tranexamic acid prodrug compounds of<br>
Formula (I) in the form of creams, gels, viscous lotions, transdermal patches, and/or<br>
sprays can be used as appropriate delivery forms. Such formulations can comprise<br>
one or more tranexamic acid prodrug compounds of Formula (I), optionally in<br>

soluble in aqueous and other protic solvents than the corresponding free acid form.<br>
m some embodiments, sodium salts of a compound of Formula 00 can be used in the<br>
above described formulations.<br>
Sustained Release Oral Dosage Forms<br>
[00170] The disclosed compounds may be used with a number of different<br>
dosage forms, which can be adapted to provide sustained release of a compound of<br>
Formula (I) upon oral administration.<br>
[00171] In some embodiments, a dosage form can comprise beads that on<br>
dissolution or diffusion release a compound disclosed herein over an extended period<br>
of hours, in certain embodiments, over a period of at least 4 hours, in certain<br>
embodiments, over a period of at least 8 hours and in certain embodiments, over a<br>
period of at least 12 hours. The beads can have a central composition or core<br>
comprising a compound disclosed herein and pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles,<br>
including an optional lubricant, antioxidant, and buffer. The beads can be medical<br>
preparations with a diameter ranging from about 0.05 mm to about 2 mm. Individual<br>
beads can comprise doses of a compound disclosed herein, for example, doses of up<br>
to about 40 mg of the compound. The beads, in some embodiments, can be formed of<br>
non-cross-linked materials to enhance their discharge from the gastrointestinal tract.<br>
The beads can be coated with a release rate-controlling polymer that gives a timed-<br>
release profile.<br>
[00172] The time-release beads can be manufactured into a tablet for<br>
therapeutically effective administration. The beads can be made into matrix tablets by<br>
the direct compression of a plurality of beads coated with, for example, an acrylic<br>
resin and blended with excipients such as hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose. The<br>
manufacture of beads has been disclosed in the art (Lu, Int. J. Pharm., 1994,112,<br>
117-124; 'Tharmaceutical Sciences" by Remington, 14th Ed, pp. 1626-1628 (1970);<br>
Fincher, J. Pharm. ScL, 1968, 57,1825-1835; and U.S. Patent No. 4,083,949) as has<br>
the manufacture of tablets ('Tharmaceutical Sciences," by Remington, 17th Ed, Ch.<br>
90, pp 1603-1625(1985)).<br><br>
[00173] One type of sustained release oral dosage formulation that can be used<br>
with the disclosed compounds comprises an inert core, such as a sugar sphere, coated<br>
with an inner drug-containing layer and an outer membrane layer controlling drug<br>
release from the inner layer. A "sealcoat" can be provided between the inert core and<br>
the layer containing the active ingredient When the core is of a water-soluble or<br>
water-swellable inert material, the sealcoat can be in the form of a relatively thick<br>
layer of a water-insoluble polymer. Such a controlled release bead an thus comprise:<br>
(i) a core unit of a substantially water-soluble or water-swellable inert material; (ii) a<br>
first layer on the core unit of a substantially water-insoluble polymer; (iii) a second<br>
layer covering the first layer and containing an active ingredient; and (iv) a third layer<br>
on the second layer of polymer effective for controlled release of the active<br>
ingredient, wherein the first layer is adapted to control water penetration into the core.<br>
[00174] In certain embodiments, the first layer (ii) above can constitute more<br>
than about 2% (w/w) of the final bead composition, and in certain embodiments, more<br>
than about 3% (w/w), e.g., from about 3% to about 80% (w/w). The amount of the<br>
second layer (ii) above can constitute from about 0.05% to about 60% (w/w), and in<br>
certain embodiments from about 0.1% to about 30% (w/w) of the final bead<br>
composition. The amount of the third layer (iv) above can constitute from about 1%<br>
to about 50% (w/w), in certain embodiments, from about 2% to about 25% (w/w) of<br>
the final bead composition. The core unit can have a size ranging from about 0.05 to<br>
about 2 mm. The controlled release beads can be provided in a multiple unit<br>
formulation, such as a capsule or a tablet.<br>
[00175] The cores can comprise a water-soluble or swellable material and can<br>
be any such material that is conventionally used as cores or any other<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable water-soluble or water-swellable material made into<br>
beads or pellets. The cores can be spheres of materials such as sucrose/starch (Sugar<br>
Spheres NF), sucrose crystals, or extruded and dried spheres typically comprised of<br>
excipients such as microcrystalline cellulose and lactose. The substantially<br>
water-insoluble material in the first, or sealcoat layer can be a "GI insoluble" or "GI<br>
partially insoluble" film forming polymer (dispersed or dissolved in a solvent).<br>
Examples include, but are not limited to, ethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate, cellulose<br>
acetate butyrate, polymethacrylates such as ethyl acrylate/methyl methacrylate<br>
copolymer (Eudragit NE-30-D) and ammonio methacrylate copolymer types A and B<br>
(Eudragit RL30D and RS30D), and silicone elastomers, ha certain embodiments, a<br><br>
plastieizer can be used together with, the polymer. Examples of plasticizers include,<br>
but are not limited to, dibutylsebacate, propylene glycol, triethylcitrate, tributylcitrate,<br>
castor oil, acetylated monoglycerides, acetyl triethylcitrate, acetyl butylcitrate, diethyl<br>
phthalate, dibutyl phthalate, triacetin, and fractionated coconut oil (medium-chain<br>
triglycerides). The second layer containing the active ingredient can comprise an<br>
active ingredient with or without a polymer as a binder. The binder, when used, can<br>
be hydrophilic, and in certain embodiments can be water-soluble or water-insoluble.<br>
Examples of polymers that can be used in the second layer containing the active drug<br>
include hydrophilic polymers such as, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), polyalkylene<br>
glycol such as polyethylene glycol, gelatine, polyvinyl alcohol, starch and derivatives<br>
thereof, cellulose derivatives, such as hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC),<br>
hydroxypropyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose,<br>
hydroxyethyl cellulose, carboxyethyl cellulose, carboxymethylhydroxyethyl cellulose,<br>
acrylic acid polymers, polymethacrylates, or any other pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
polymer. The ratio of drug to hydrophilic polymer in the second layer can range from<br>
about 1:100 to about 100:1 (w/w). Suitable polymers for use in the third layer, or<br>
membrane, for controlling the drug release can be selected from water-insoluble,<br>
polymers or polymers withpH-dependent solubility, such as, ethyl cellulose,<br>
hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate, cellulose acetate phthalate, cellulose acetate<br>
trimellitate, polymethacrylates, or mixtures thereof, optionally combined with<br>
plasticizers, such as those mentioned above. Optionally, the controlled release layer<br>
comprises, in addition to the polymers above, other substance(s) with different<br>
solubility characteristics, to adjust the permeability and thereby the release rate, of the<br>
controlled release layer. Example of polymers that can be used as a modifier together<br>
with, for example, ethyl cellulose include, but are not limited to, HPMC,<br>
hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, methylcellulose,<br>
carboxymethylcellulose, polyethylene glycol, polyvinylpyrroUdone (PVP), polyvinyl<br>
alcohol, polymers with pH-dependent solubility, such as cellulose acetate phthalate or<br>
ammonio methacrylate copolymer, methacrylic acid copolymer, and combinations of<br>
any of the foregoing. Additives such as sucrose, lactose and pharmaceutical grade<br>
surfactants can also be included in the controlled release layer, if desired.<br>
[00176] The preparation of the multiple unit formulation can comprise the<br>
additional step of tramforming the prepared beads into a pharmaceutical formulation,<br>
such as by filling a predetermined amount of the beads into a capsule, or compressing<br><br>
the beads into tablets. Examples of multi-particulate sustained release oral dosage<br>
forms are described in, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 6,627,223 and 5,229,135.<br>
[00177] In certain embodiments, polymeric materials can be used (See<br>
"Medical Applications of Controlled Release," Laager and Wise (eds.), CRC Press,<br>
Boca Raton, Florida (1974); "Controlled Drug Bioavailability, Drug Product Design<br>
and Performance," Smolen and Ball (eds.), Wiley, New York (1984); Langer et al, J<br>
Macromol. Sci. Rev. Macromol Chem., 1983,23,61; see also Levy et al., Science,<br>
1985,228,190; During et al, Ann. Neurol, 1989,25,351; Howard et al, J.<br>
Neurosurg., 1989, 71,105). In some embodiments, polymeric materials can be used<br>
for oral sustained release delivery. Polymers include, but are not limited to, sodium<br>
carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxypropylmetnylcellulose, and<br>
hydroxyethylcellulose (especially, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose). Ottier cellulose<br>
ethers have been described (Alderman, Int. J. Pharm. Tech. &amp; Prod. Mfr., 1984,5(3),<br>
1-9). Factors affecting drug release are well known to the skilled artisan and have<br>
been described in the art (Bamba et al, Int. J. Pharm., 1979,2,307).<br>
[00178] In certain embodiments, enteric-coated preparations can be used for<br>
oral sustained release administration. Examples of useful coating materials include<br>
polymers with apH-dependent solubility (i.e., pH-controlled release), polymers with a<br>
slow or pH-dependent rate of swelling, dissolution or erosion (i.e., time-controlled<br>
release), polymers that are degraded by enzymes (i.e., enzyme-controlled release), and<br>
polymers that form firm layers that are destroyed by an increase in pressure (i.e.,<br>
' pressure-controlled release).<br>
[00179] In certain embodiments, drug-releasing lipid matrices can be used for<br>
oral sustained release administration. An example is when solid microparticles of a<br>
compound disclosed herein are coated with a thin controlled release layer of a lipid<br>
(e.g., glyceryl behenate and/or glyceryl palmitostearate) as disclosed in Farah et al,<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,375,987 and Joachim^ al, U.S. Patent No. 6,379,700. The<br>
lipid-coated particles can optionally be compressed to form a tablet. Another<br>
controlled release lipid-based matrix material that is suitable for sustained release oral<br>
administration comprises polyglycolized glycerides as disclosed in Roussin et al,<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,171,615.<br>
[00180] In certain embodiments, waxes can be used for oral sustained release<br>
administration. Examples of suitable sustained compound-releasing waxes are<br>
disclosed in Cain et al, U.S. Patent No. 3,402,240 (camauba wax, candelilla wax,<br><br>
esparto wax and ouricury wax); Shtohryn et al, U.S. Patent No. 4,820,523<br>
(hydrogenated vegetable oil, bees wax, camauba wax, paraffin, candelilla, ozokerite<br>
and combinations of any of the foregoing); and Walters, U.S. Patent No. 4,421,736<br>
(mixture of paraffin and castor wax).<br>
[00181] In certain embodiments, osmotic delivery systems can be used for oral<br>
sustained release administration (Verma et al, Drug Dev. Ind. Pharm., 2000,26,<br>
695-708). In some embodiments, OROS® systems made by Alza Corporation,<br>
Mountain View, CA can be used for oral sustained release delivery devices<br>
(Theeuwes et al, U.S. Patent No. 3,845,770; Theeuwes et al, U.S. Patent No.<br>
3,916,899).<br>
[00182] In certain embodiments, a controlled-release system can be placed in<br>
proximity of the target of a compound disclosed herein (e.g., within the spinal cord),<br>
thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose (See, e.g., Goodson, in "Medical<br>
Applications of Controlled Release," supra, vol. 2, pp. 115-138 (1984)). Other<br>
controlled-release systems discussed in Langer, Science, 1990,249,1527-1533 can<br>
also be used.<br>
[00183] In certain embodiments, a dosage form can comprise a compound<br>
disclosed herein coated on a polymer substrate. The polymer can be an erodible, or a<br>
nonerodible polymer. The coated substrate can be folded onto itself to provide a<br>
bilayer polymer drug dosage form. For example, a compound disclosed herein can be<br>
coated onto a polymer such as a polypeptide, collagen, gelatin, polyvinyl alcohol,<br>
polyorthoester, polyacetyl, or apolyorthocarbonate and the coated polymer folded onto<br>
itself to provide a bilaminated dosage form. In operation, a bioerodible dosage form<br>
erodes at a controlled rate to dispense a compound disclosed herein over a sustained<br>
release period. Representative biodegradable polymers include biodegradable<br>
poly(amides), poly (amino acids), poly(esters), poly(lactic acid), poly(glycolic acid),<br>
poly(carbohydrate), poly(orthoester), poly(orthocarbonate), poly(acetyl),<br>
poly(anhydrides), biodegradable poly(dihydropyrans), and poly(dioxinones) which<br>
are known in the art (Rosoff, Controlled Release of Drugs Chap. 2, pp. 53-95 (1989);<br>
and in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,811,444; 3,962,414; 4,066,747,4,070,347; 4,079,038; and<br>
4,093,709).<br>
[00184] In certain embodiments, a dosage form can comprise a compound of<br>
Formula (I) loaded into a polymer that releases the compound by diffusion through a<br><br>
polymer, or by flux through pores or by rupture of a polymer matrix. The drug<br>
delivery polymeric dosage form can comprise from about 10 mg to about 500 mg of<br>
the compound homogenously contained in or on a polymer. The dosage form can<br>
comprise at least one exposed surface at the beginning of dose delivery. The<br>
non-exposed surface, when present, can be coated with a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
material impermeable to the passage of the compound. The dosage form can be<br>
manufactured by procedures known in the art An example of providing a dosage<br>
form comprises blending a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier such as polyethylene<br>
glycol, with a known dose of a compound at an elevated temperature, (e.g., 37 °C),<br>
and adding the blended composition to a silastic medical grade elastomer with a<br>
cross-linking agent, for example, octanoate, followed by casting in a mold. The step<br>
can be repeated for each optional successive layer. The system can be allowed to set<br>
for about 1 hour, to provide the dosage form. Representative polymers for<br>
.manufacturing the dosage include olefinic polymers, vinyl polymers, addition<br>
polymers, condensation polymers, carbohydrate polymer and silicone polymers as<br>
represented by polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl acetate, polymethylacrylate,<br>
polylsobutylmethacrylate, poly alginate, polyamide and polysilicone. The polymers<br>

Patent Nos. 4,434,153; 4,721,613; 4,853,229; 2,996,431; 3,139,383; and 4,752,470.<br>
[00186] In certain embodiments, a dosage form can comprise an osmotic<br>
dosage form, which comprises a semipermeable wall that surrounds a therapeutic<br>
composition comprising the compound. In use within a patient, an osmotic dosage<br>
form comprising a homogenous composition, imbibes fluid through the<br>
semipermeable wall into the dosage form in response to the concentration gradient<br>
across the semipermeable wall The therapeutic composition in the dosage form<br>
develops osmotic pressure differential that causes the therapeutic composition to be<br>
administered through an exit from the dosage form over a prolonged period of time up<br>
to about 24 hours (or even in some cases up to about 30 hours) to provide controlled<br>
and sustained compound release. These delivery platforms can provide an essentially<br>
zero order delivery profile as opposed to the spiked profiles of immediate release<br>
formulations.<br>
[00187] In certain embodiments, the dosage form can comprise another osmotic<br>
dosage form comprising a wall surrounding a compartment, the wall comprising a<br>
semipermeable polymeric composition permeable to the passage of fluid and<br>
substantially impermeable to the passage of compound present in the compartment, a<br>
compound-containing layer composition in the compartment, a hydrogel push layer<br>
composition in the compartment comprising an osmotic formulation for imbibing and<br>
absorbing fluid for expanding in size for pushing the compound composition layer<br>
from the dosage form, and at least one passageway in the wall for releasing the<br>
prodrug composition. The method delivers the compound by imbibing fluid through<br>
the semipermeable wall at a fluid imbibing rate determined by the permeability of the<br>
semipermeable wall and the osmotic pressure across the semipermeable wall causing<br>
the push layer to expand, thereby delivering the compound from the dosage form<br>
through the exit passageway to a patient over a prolonged period of time (up to about<br>
24 or even about 30 hours). The hydrogel layer composition can comprise from about<br>
10 mg to about 1000 mg of a hydrogel such as a member selected from the group<br>
consisting of a polyalkylene oxide of about 1,000,000 to about 8,000,000<br><br>
weight-average molecular weight, which are selected from the group consisting of a<br>
polyethylene oxide of about 1,000,000 weight-average molecular weight, a<br>
polyethylene oxide of about 2,000,000 molecular weight, a polyethylene oxide of<br>
about 4,000,000 molecular weight, a polyethylene oxide of about 5,000,000 molecular<br>
weight, a polyethylene oxide of about 7,000,000 molecular weight and a<br>
polypropylene oxide of the about 1,000,000 to about 8,000,000 weight-average<br>
molecular weight; or about 10 mg to about 1000 mg of an alkali<br>
carboxymethylcellulose of about 10,000 to about 6,000,000 weight average molecular<br>
weight, such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose or potassium carboxymethylcellulose.<br>
The hydrogel expansion layer comprises about 0 mg to about 350 mg, in present<br>
manufacture; about 0.1 mg to about 250 mg of a hydroxyalkylcellulose of about 7,500<br>
to about 4,500,00 weight-average molecular weight (e.g., hydroxymethylcellulose,<br>
hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxybutylcellulose or<br>
hydroxypentylcellulose) in present manufacture; about 1 mg to about 50 mg of an<br>
agent selected from the group consisting of sodium chloride, potassium chloride,<br>
potassium acid phosphate, tartaric acid, citric acid, raffinose, magnesium sulfate,<br>
magnesium chloride, urea, inositol, sucrose, glucose and sorbitol; 0 to about 5 mg of a<br>
colorant, such as ferric oxide; about 0 mg to about 30 mg, in a present manufacture,<br>
0.1 mg to 30 mg of a hydroxypropylalkylcellulose of about 9,000 to about 225,000<br>
average-number molecular weight, selected from the group consisting of<br>
hydroxypropylelhylcellulose, hydroxypropypentylcellulose,<br>
hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, and hydropropylbutylcellulose; about 0.00 to about<br>
1.5 mg of an antioxidant selected from the group consisting of ascorbic acid,<br>

octyl gallate, lauryl gallate, propyl-hydroxybenzoate, trihydroxybutylrophenone,<br>
dimethylphenol, dibutylphenol, vitamin E, lecithin, and emanolarnine; and about 0.0<br>
mg to about 7 mg of a lubricant selected from the group consisting of calcium<br>
stearate, magnesium stearate, zinc stearate, magnesium oleate, calcium palmitate,<br>
sodium suberate, potassium laurate, salts of fatty acids, salts of alicyclic acids, salts of<br>
aromatic acids, stearic acid, oleic acid, palmitic acid, a mixture of a salt of a fatty,<br>
alicyclic or aromatic acid, and a fatty, alicyclic, or aromatic acid.<br>
[00188] In the osmotic dosage forms, the semipermeable wall can comprise a<br>
composition that is permeable to the passage of fluid and impermeable to the passage<br><br>
of prodrug. The wall is nontoxic and comprises a polymer selected from the group<br>
consisting of a cellulose acylate, cellulose diacylate, cellulose triacylate, cellulose<br>
acetate, cellulose diacetate and cellulose triacetate. The wall comprises about from 75<br>
wt % (weight percent) to about 100 wt % of the cellulosic waU-forming polymer or,<br>
the wall can comprise additionally about 0.01 wt % to about 80 wt % of polyethylene<br>
glycol, or about from 1 wt % to about 25 wt % of a cellulose ether selected from the<br>
group consisting of hydroxypropylcellulose and a hydroxypropylalkycellulose such as<br>
hydroxypropylmethylcellulose. The total weight percent of all components<br>
comprising the wall is equal to about 100 wt %. The internal compartment comprises<br>
the compoimd-cxmtainmg composition alone or in layered position with an<br>
expandable hydrogel composition. The expandable hydrogel composition in the<br>
compartment increases in dimension by imbibing the fluid through the semipermeable<br>
wall, causing the hydrogel to expand and occupy space in the compartment, whereby<br>
the drug composition is pushed from the dosage form. The therapeutic layer and the<br>
expandable layer act together during the operation of the dosage form for the release<br>
of prodrug to a patient over time. The dosage form comprises a passageway in the<br>
wall that connects the exterior of the dosage form with the internal compartment. The<br>
osmotic powered dosage form can be made to deliver prodrug from the dosage form<br>
to the patient at a zero order rate of release over a period of up to about 24 hours.<br>
[00189] The expression "passageway" as used herein comprises means and<br>
methods suitable for the metered release of the compound from the compartment of<br>
the dosage form. The exit means comprises at least one passageway, including an<br>
orifice, bore, aperture, pore, porous element, hollow fiber, capillary tube, channel,<br>
porous overlay, or porous element that provides for the osmotic controlled release of<br>
compound. The passageway includes a material that erodes or is leached from the<br>
wall in a fluid environment of use to produce at least one controlled-release<br>
dimensioned passageway. Representative materials suitable for forming a<br>
passageway, or a multiplicity of passageways comprise a leachable poly(glycolic)<br>
acid or poly(lactic) acid polymer in the wall, a gelatinous filament, polyvinyl<br>
alcohol), leach-able polysaccharides, salts, and oxides. A pore passageway, or more<br>
than one pore passageway, can be formed by leaching a leachable compound, such as<br>
sorbitol, from the wall. The passageway possesses controlled-release dimensions,<br>
such as round, triangular, square, or elliptical, for the metered release of prodrug from<br>
the dosage form. The dosage form can be constructed with one or more passageways<br><br>
in spaced apart relationship on a single surface or on more than one surface of the<br>
wall. The expression "fluid environment" denotes an aqueous or biological fluid as in<br>
a human patient, including the gastrointestinal tract Passageways and equipment for<br>
forming passageways are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,845,770; 3,916,899;<br>
4,063,064; 4,088,864; and 4,816,263. Passageways formed by leaching are disclosed<br>
in U.S. Patents Nos. 4,200,098 and 4,285,987.<br>
[00190] Regardless of the specific form of sustained release oral dosage form<br>
used, compounds of Formula (I) can be released from the dosage form over a period<br>
of at least about 4 hours, for example, over a period of at least about 8 hours or at<br>
least about 12 hours. Further, in certain embodiments, the dosage form can release<br>
from about 0% to about 30% of the prodrug in from 0 to about 2 hours, from about<br>
20% to about 50% of die prodrug in from about 2 to about 12 hours, from about 50%<br>
to about 85% of the prodrug in from about 3 to about 20 hours and greater than about<br>
75% of the prodrug in from about 5 to about 18 hours, m certain embodiments, a<br>
sustained release oral dosage form can provide a concentration of tranexamic acid in<br>
the blood plasma of a patient over time, which curve has an area under the curve<br>
(Cmax) that is proportional to the dose of the prodrug of tranexamic acid administered,<br>
and a maximum concentration Cmax.<br>
[00191] Jh certain embodiments, dosage forms are administered once or twice<br>
per day, and in certain embodiments, once per day.<br>

was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Inc. and was used without further manipulation.<br>
O-(l-Acyloxyalkyl) S-alkylthiocarbonates were previously synthesized according to<br>
the procedures disclosed in Gallop et al, U.S. Application Publication No.<br>
2005/0222431 and converted to the corresponding acyloxyalkyl N-<br>
hyd^oxysuccinimide carbonic acid esters as described therein, or according to the<br>
general procedure given below. All other reagents and solvents were purchased from<br>
commercial suppliers and used without further purification or manipulation.<br>
[00207] Proton NMR spectra (400 MHz) were recorded on a Varian AS 400<br>
NMR spectrometer equipped with an autosampler and data processing computation.<br>
DMSO-d6 (99.9% D) or CDC13 (99.8 % D) were used as solvents unless otherwise<br>
noted. The DMSO or chloroform solvent signal was used for calibration of the<br>
individual spectra (H. E. Gottlieb et al., J. Org. Chem., 1997, 62,7512). Analytical<br>
LC/MS was performed on a Waters 2790 separation module equipped with a Waters<br><br>
Micromass QZ mass spectrometer, a Waters 996 photodiode detector, and a Merck<br>
Chromolith UM2072-027 or Phenomenex Luna C-18 analytical column. Mass-<br>
guided preparative HPLC purification of final compounds was performed on an<br>
instrument equipped with a Waters 600 controller, ZMD Micromass spectrometer, a<br>
Waters 2996 photodiode array detector, and a Waters 2700 Sample Manager.<br>
Acetonitrile/water gradients containing 0.05% formic acid were used as eluents in<br>

General Procedure for the Synthesis of Acvloxvalkvi JV-hvdroxvsuccinimide<br>
Carbonic Acid Esters<br>
[00208] A 250 mL round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar and<br>
a pressure-equilibrating dropping funnel was charged with the 1-acyloxyalkyl<br>
alkyltbiocarbonate (10 mmol) and Jv"-hydroxysuccinimide (20-40 mmol).<br>
Dichloromethane (20-40 mL) was added and the reaction mixture cooled to ca. 0 °C<br>
in an ice-bath. Peracetic acid (32 wt.%) in a 40-45% aqueous acetic acid solution (30<br>
mmol) was added dropwise with stirring over a period of ca. one hour to the cooled<br>
solution. After addition was complete, stirring was continued for additional three to<br>
five hours at this temperature, the reaction being monitored by 'H NMR. spectroscopy.<br>
After complete consumption of the starting material, the reaction mixture was diluted<br>
with additional dichloromethane, and the organic solution was washed successively<br>
with water (three times) and once with a 10% aqueous solution of sodium<br>
metabisulfite or sodium thiosulfate to quench any remaining oxidant. The combined<br>
organic extracts were dried over MgSO^ filtered, and the solvent removed under<br>
reduced pressure with a rotary evaporator. Compound identity, integrity, and purity<br>
were checked by 'H NMR spectroscopy. The crude material was used directly in the<br>
next step, or could be further purified by commonly employed techniques well-known<br>
to those skilled in the art.<br>

propyl 2-methylpropanoate (2.3 g, 9.82 mmol) and iV'-hydroxysuccinirnide (4.6 g, 40<br>
mmol) were reacted in dichloromethane (20 mL) with peracetic acid (32 wt.%, 6.13<br><br>
mL). After aqueous workup, isolation and removal of residual solvents in vacuo, the<br>
crude product 2 (1.76 g, 61%) was obtained as a yellow oil. The material was used in<br>
the next step without further purification. lK NMR (400 MHz, CDC13): 8 = 1.02 (t, J<br>

General Nucleophilic Carbamovlation Procednre for Synthesis of Acyloxyalkvl<br>
Carbamates of Tranexamic Acid<br>
[00211] A screw-capped 40 mL glass vial equipped with a magnetic stir bar<br>
was charged with fran5-4-(aminomethyl)cyclohexanecarboxylic (tranexamic) acid<br>
(472 mg, 3.0 mmol). The appropriate acyloxyalkyl N-hydroxysucciriimide carbonic<br>
acid ester (2.0 mmol) was added either as a solid or was dissolved in a small volume<br>
of solvent (for oily materials). A mixture of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), acetone,<br>
and water (v/v/v = 4:3:1) (15-20 mL) was added, and the reaction mixture stirred for<br>
ca. 12 hours at room temperature. Upon completion of the reaction, the mixture was<br>
diluted with ethyl acetate and 1 N aqueous hydrochloric acid (ca. 10 mL) was added.<br>
After vigorous mixing followed by phase separation, the aqueous layer was extracted<br>
once more with EtOAc, and the combined organic extracts were washed with brine.<br>
The solvents were evaporated under reduced pressure, the dry residue was dissolved<br>
in a mixture of 60% (v/v) acetonitrile/water, and the solution filtered through a 0.2<br>
yaa nylon syringe filter. Final purification was achieved by mass-guided preparative<br><br>
HPLC. After lyophilization of the solvents, the pure compounds were obtained as<br>
white powders.<br>
General Procedure for One Pot Synthesis of Acvloxvalkvl Carbamates of<br>
Tranexamic Acid<br>
[00212] Under an atmosphere of nitrogen, a dry 100 mL round-bottomed flask<br>
equipped with a magnetic stir bar and a rubber septum was charged with trans-4-<br>
(arninomethyl)cyclohexanecarboxylic (tranexamic) acid (786.1 mg, 5.0 mmol).<br>
Anhydrous dichloromethane (10-15 mL) was added, and the reaction mixture was<br>
cooled to ca. 0 °C with an icebath. CMorotrimethylsilane (1.396 mL, 1.195 g, 11.0<br>
mmol) was added neat at this temperature, followed by slow addition ofN-<br>
methylmorpholine (1.374 mL, 1.264 g, 12.5 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred<br>
at this temperature for ca. 30 min, when an appropriately substituted<br>
chloroalkylchloroformate (7.5 mmol) was added dropwise and in neat form. The<br>
reaction mixture was stirred at this temperature for an additional 30 min when a<br>
premixed mixture of NMM (2.75 mL, 2.53 g, 25 mmol) and an appropriately<br>
substituted carboxylic acid (50 mmol) was added at ca. 0 °C. The reaction mixture<br>
was stirred overnight with warming to room temperature. The dichloromethane was<br>
removed in vacuo from the dark brownish reaction mixture using a rotary evaporator.<br>
The crude reaction product was diluted with methyl ter/-butyl ether (MTBE), and the<br>
solution washed three times with water. The organic layer was dried over MgSC&gt;4,<br>
and the filtrate evaporated in vacuo using a rotary evaporator. The crude dry residue<br>
was dissolved in a small amount of a mixture of 60% (v/v) acetonitrile/water (ca. 5<br>
mL), and the solution filtered through a 0.2 nm nylon syringe filter. Final purification<br>
was achieved by mass-guided preparative HPLC. After lyophilization of the solvents,<br>
the pure compounds were generally obtained as white powders.<br>
General Procedure for the Synthesis of Sodium Salts of Acvloxvalkvl<br>
Carbamates of Tranexamic Acid<br>
[00213] A screw-capped 40 mL vial equipped with a magnetic stir bar was<br>
charged with an appropriately substituted acyloxyalkyl carbamate of tranexamic acid<br>
(5.0 mmol). The material was dissolved in ca. 10 mL of acetonitrile. A solution of<br>
sodium bicarbonate (NaHCOs) (420.1 mg, 5.0 mmol) in ca. 20 mL of water was<br><br>
added at room temperature and the mixture was stored one hour after the evolution of<br>
carbon dioxide subsided. The clear solution was frozen at -78 °C and the solvents<br>
were lyophilized. After lyophilization of the solvents, the pure compounds were<br>
obtained as white powders.<br>

Example 51: Standard Methods for Determination of Enzymatic Cleavage of<br>
Prodrugs in Vitro<br>
[00262] The stabilities of prodrugs were evaluated in one or more in vitro<br>
systems using a variety of tissue preparations following methods known in the art.<br><br>
The chemical stability of prodrugs in aqueous buffers at a pH of 2.0,7.4, and 8.0 were<br>
also measured. Tissues were obtained from commercial sources (e.g., Pel-Freez<br>
Biologicals, Rogers, AR, or GenTest Corporation, Woburn, MA). Experimental<br>
conditions used for the in vitro studies are described in Table 1. Each preparation<br>
was incubated with test compound at 37 °C for one hour. Aliquots (50 uL) were<br>
removed at 0,30, and 60 min and quenched with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in<br>
acetonitrile. Samples were then centrifuged and analyzed by LC/MS/MS. Stability of<br>
prodrugs towards specific enzymes (e.g., peptidases, etc.) was also assessed in vitro<br>
by incubation with the purified enzyme.<br>
[00263] Pancreatin Stability: Stability studies were conducted by incubating<br>
prodrug (5 uM) with 1% (w/v) pancreatin (Sigma, P-1625, from porcine pancreas) in<br>
0.025 M Tris buffer containing 0.5 M NaCl (pH 7.5) at 37 °C for 60 min. The<br>
reaction was stopped by addition of 2 volumes of methanol. After centrifugation at<br>
14,000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatant was removed and analyzed by LC/MS/MS.<br>
[00264] Caco-2 Homogenate S9 Stability: Caco-2 cells were grown for 21 days<br>
prior to harvesting. Culture medium was removed and cell monolayers were rinsed<br>
and scraped off into ice-cold 10 mM sodium phosphate/0.15 M potassium chloride,<br>
pH 7.4. Cells were lysed by sonication at 4 °C using a probe sonicator. Lysed cells<br>
were then transferred into 1.5 mL centrifuge vials and centrifuged at 9,000 g for 20<br>
min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant (Caco-2 cell homogenate S9 fraction) was<br>
aliquoted into 0.5 mL vials and stored at -80 °C until used.<br><br><br><br>
[00265] For stability studies, prodrug (5 JJM) was incubated in Caco-2<br>
homogenate S9 fraction (0.5 mg protein per mL) for 60 min at 37 °C. Concentrations<br>
of intact prodrug and released tranexamic acid were determined at zero time and 60<br>
min using LC/MS/MS.<br>
[00266] pH-Dependent Stability: The long-term pH-dependent stability of<br>
tranexamic acid prodrug at 37 °C was measured by LC/MS/MS at five different<br>
representative pH values from pH 2.0 to pH 8.0 was determined. The test<br>
concentration was 5 uM. The amount of remaining prodrug and the amount of<br>
tranexamic acid released from the prodrug was determined at 0 hour and after 24<br>
hours.<br>
[00267] Compounds 13,15-19,32-34,44,46,48-49, and 51, for example,<br>
showed good stability from pH 2 to pH 8, are stable in the presence of pancreatin and<br>
colonic wash (&gt; 40% intact prodrug remaining after 60 min incubation) and are<br>
extensively hydrolyzed to liberate tranexamic acid in the presence of human liver<br>

Example 52: In Vitro Determination of Caco-2 Cellular Permeability of Prodrugs<br>
[00268] The passive permeability of the prodrugs of the present disclosure can<br>
be assessed in vitro using standard methods well known in the art (See, e.g., Stewart,<br>
et al, Pharm. Res., 1995,12,693). For example, passive permeability can be<br>
evaluated by examining the flux of a prodrug across a cultured polarized cell<br>
monolayer (e.g., Caco-2 cells).<br><br>
[00269] Caco-2 cells obtained from continuous culture (passage less than 28)<br>
were seeded at high density onto Transwell polycarbonate filters. Cells were<br>
maintained with DMEM/10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mM nonessential amino acids,<br>
and 6 mM L-Gln, 5% C02/ 95% O* at 37 °C until the day of the experiment.<br>
Permeability studies were conducted at pH 6.5 apically (in 50 mM MES buffer<br>
containing 1 mM CaCl2, ImM MgCl2,150 mM NaCl, 3 mM KC1,1 mM NaH2P04,5<br>
mM glucose) and pH 7.4 basolaterally (in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 10<br>
mM HEPES) in the presence of efflux pump inhibitors (250 uM MK-571 and 250 ^M<br>
Verapamil). Inserts were placed in 12 or 24 well plates containing buffer and<br>
incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Prodrug (200 uM) was added to the apical or<br>
basolateral compartment (donor) and concentrations of prodrug and/or released parent<br>
drug in the opposite compartment (receiver) were determined at intervals over 1 hour<br>
using LC/MS/MS. Values of apparent permeability (Papp) were calculated using the<br>
equation:<br><br>
where Vr is the volume of the receiver compartment in mL; dC/dt is the total flux of<br>
prodrug and parent drug (uM/sec), determined from the slope of the plot of<br>
concentration in the receiver compartment versus time; Co is the initial concentration<br>
of prodrug in uM; and A is the surface area of the membrane in cm2. Prodrugs with<br>
significant transcellular permeability may demonstrate a value of Papp of £ 1 x 10"6<br>
cm/sec, for example, a value of Papp of &gt; 1 x 10"5 cm/sec, or even a value of Papp of &gt; 5<br>
x 10"5 cm/sec. Typical values of Papp obtained for prodrugs of the present disclosure<br>
are shown in Table 2.<br><br><br><br>
[00270] The data in Table 2 shows that the prodrugs disclosed herein have high<br>
cellular permeability and should be well absorbed from the intestine. The apical-to-<br>
basolateral permeabilities of these prodrugs exceed their basolateral-to-apical<br>
permeabilities. This suggests that these compounds are substrates for active transport<br>
mechanisms present in the apical membrane of Caco-2 cells (although some<br>
component of this transcellular permeability may also be mediated by passive<br>
diffusion).<br><br>
Example 53: Pharmacokinetics of Tranexamic Acid Following Administration of<br>
Tranexamic Acid or Tranexamic Acid Prodrug to Rats<br>
[00271] Tranexamic acid or a tranexamic acid prodrug of the present disclosure<br>
was administered as an intravenous bolus injection (i.v.), by oral gavage (p.o.), or by<br>
intracolonic (i.e.) administration via an indwelling catheter in the ascending colon to<br>
groups of four to six adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (weight approximately 250 g).<br>
Animals were fasted overnight before the study and for 4 hours post-dosing and were<br>
conscious at the time of the experiment When administered intravenously,<br>
tranexamic acid was administered as a solution in water at a dose equivalent to 16 mg<br>
(0.1 mmol) of tranexamic acid per kg body weight Prodrugs were orally or<br>
intracolonically administered as a suspension in 0.5 % methyl cellulose in 0.1 %<br>
Tween 80 at a dose equivalent to 16 mg (0.1 mmol) of tranexamic acid per kg body<br>
weight. Blood samples (300 \iL) were obtained via a jugular vein cannula at intervals<br>
over 8 hours after oral dosing. Blood was quenched immediately using methanol and<br>
then was frozen at -80 °C until analyzed.<br>
[00272] The following procedure was used to prepared blood samples for<br>
analysis:<br>
[00273] 1. Rat blood (100 uL) was collected at different times into K2EDTA<br>
tubes, 300 uL of methanol, and the mixture was vortexed to mix the ingredients.<br>
[00274] 2. Blank rat blood (90 uL) was quenched with 300 uL of methanol.<br>
Then ten uL of a standard stock solution (0.04,0.2,1,5,25, and 100 ug/mL) were<br>
added to the tube individually. Then 20 uL of p-chlorophenylalanine (5 jag/mL in<br>
50% methanol) was added to each tube to make up a final calibration standard (0.004,<br>
0.02, 0.1, 0.5,2.5, and 10 ug/mL). The samples were vortexed and centrifuged at<br>
14,000 ipm for 20 min.<br>
[00275] 3. To the quenched blood samples were added 20 uL ofp-<br>
cblorophenylalanine (5 jag/mL in 50% methanol), the samples were vortexed and<br>
centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min.<br>
[00276] 4. The supernatant was analyzed by LC/MS/MS.<br>
[00277] The following method was used for LC/MS/MS Analysis of the<br>
prepared blood samples. An API 4000 or 2000 LC/MS/MS spectrometer equipped<br>
with Agilent 1100 binary pumps and a CTC HTS-PAL autosampler were used in the<br>
analysis. A ThermoHypersil-BetaSil CI 8,100 x 4.6 mm, 5 um column was used<br><br>
during the analysis. The mobile phase for the analysis of tranexamic acid and prodrug<br>
was (A) 0.1 % formic acid in water, and (B) 0.1 % formic acid in acetonitrile. The<br>
gradient condition was: 2 % eluent-B to 95 % eluent-B for 2.5 min, then to 98 %<br>
eluent-B to 4.0 min. At 4.1 min, it was returned to 2 % eluent-B and maintained at 2<br>
% eluent-B till 6.0 min. The flow rate was 1 rnL/min. An ESI source was used on the<br>
API 4000. The analysis of tranexamic acid was performed in positive ion mode for<br>
and negative ion mode was used for analysis of tranexamic acid prodrugs.<br>
[00278] The MRM transition for each analyte was optimized using standard<br>
solutions. 20 uL of the sample was injected. Non-compartmental analysis was<br>
performed using WinNonlin (v.3.1 Professional Version, Pharsight Corporation,<br>
Mountain View, California) on individual animal profiles. Summary statistics on<br>
major parameter estimates was performed for Cmax (peak observed concentration<br>
following dosing), Tmax (time to maximum concentration is the time at which the<br>
peak concentration was observed), AUC(<m under the serum concentration-time></m>
curve from time zero to last collection time, estimated using the log-linear trapezoidal<br>
method), AUC(o-»), (area under the serum concentration time curve from time zero to<br>
infinity, estimated using the log-linear trapezoidal method to the last collection time<br>
with extrapolation to infinity), and t\a (terminal half-life).<br>
[00279] The oral or intracolonic bioavailability (F) of tranexamic acid was<br>
determined by comparing the area under the tranexamic acid concentration vs. time<br>
curve (AUC) following oral or intracolonic administration of tranexamic acid or<br>
prodrug with the AUC of the tranexamic acid concentration vs. time curve following<br>
intravenous administration of tranexamic acid on a dose normalized basis. An AUCinf<br>
of 22.2 hr*(4.g/mL for the intravenously administered tranexamic acid (dosed at 16<br>
mg/kg) was used for the calculations of the bioavailability of tranexamic acid released<br>
from prodrugs post absorption. The results for tranexamic acid and tranexamic<br>
prodrug 13 are shown in Table 3, Figure 1, and Figure 2. In Table 3, the values<br>
represent the mean ± 1SD. When administered intracolonically, each of compounds<br>
13-20,23-24, and 44-45, for example, showed greater than 8-fold higher<br>
bioavailability of tranexamic acid compared to the bioavailability of tranexamic acid<br>
when tranexamic acid itself was administered intracolonically.<br><br><br>
