3.  PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is  to be performed : -<br><br>
The present invention relates to a hydraulic pressure intermediary, also referred to as a<br>
diaphragm seal, or chemical seal. The pressure intermediary of the invention includes:<br>
A platform, with a membrane- or diaphragm-bed on a surface of the platform;<br>
a separating membrane, or diaphragm, which is secured to the platform in its edge<br>
region to enclose a cavity;<br>
and a hydraulic path, which communicates with the cavity through an opening in the<br>
surface of the platform;<br>
wherein the cavity and the hydraulic path are filled with a pressure-transfer liquid.<br>
Pressure intermediaries of this type are basically known, and the state of the art includes a multitude of embodiments of separating membranes, which are optimized for the most varied of conditions.<br>
For example, DE 100 31 120 Al discloses a pressure intermediary proposed for minimizing or eliminating a temperature-dependent membrane error. This temperature-dependent error stems from elastic deformation of the separating membrane due to pressure in the pressure-transfer liquid resulting from the temperature-dependent volume change of the pressure-transfer liquid. DE 100 31120 Al discloses, for example, a pressure intermediary having a bowl-shaped separating membrane, which has a flat edge region for attachment of the separating membrane to a platform and a lightly waved, central region depressed relative to the edge region. Extending between the edge region and the central region is an inclined transition region connecting the edge and central regions together. The separating membrane and the platform are matched to one another in such a manner that the equilibrium position of the separating membrane changes as a function of temperature, and, in fact, in such a manner that the resulting volume in the cavity between the separating membrane and the platform corresponds to the temperature-dependent volume of the pressure-transfer liquid. This is achieved by, among other things, providing the platform with a greater coefficient of thermal expansion than the separating membrane. Although the described state of the art according to DE 100 31 120 Al might be of interest for thermal equilibrium situations, nevertheless in the case of temperature differences between the platform and the separating membrane, which<br><br><br>
can arise, for example, following CIP cleanings with hot steam and subsequent filling with cold media, large stresses can be experienced in the membrane, which effect a permanent zero-point shift and thus a measurement error. This is attributable not the least to the fact that the transition region effects a relatively stiffer coupling between edge region and central region. The coupling should determine the particular temperature-dependent equilibrium position of the separating membrane.<br>
The problem of CIP cleaning of membranes and the resulting hysteresis is discussed in U.S. Patent No. 5,495,768. According to this, due to the momentum of the incoming cleaning medium, the pressure-transfer liquid is shifted under the separating membrane and this leads to a bulging of the planar membrane and permanent deformation of the joint between the membrane and the platform. It is doubtful whether this description of the causes of the permanent deformation is actually appropriate or complete, because temperature gradients are not sufficiently taken into consideration. In any event, this patent discloses, as its proposed solution, a pressure intermediary with a bowl-shaped separating membrane, which has a flat edge region for attachment of the separating membrane to a platform and a lightly waved, central region depressed relative to the edge region. Extending between the edge region and the central region is an inclined transition region, which connects the edge region and the central region together. The platform has a mainly congruent surface, and, thus also, a flat, annular edge region, a deeper, lightly waved, central region and an inclined annular transition region lying between the edge region and the central region. The edge region of the separating membrane is flushly connected by means of solder with the edge region of the surface of the platform. For unloading the edge region, the transition region is very stiff. I.e., in the case of a deflection of the separating membrane for accommodating a shifted oil volume, the transition region and the edge region protected by such are scarcely deflected. The deformation occurs exclusively in the central region of the separating membrane.<br>
It need not be answered, whether the described the approach achieves the desired unloading of the joint. To accommodate the oil volumes, there are required, in such case, nevertheless,  such  deflections  of the  separating  membrane  that a plastic<br><br><br>
deformation and, therewith, a zero-point shift can occur. The required large deflections in the central region come, not lastly, from the stiffness of the transition region, which limit a deflection of the volume-efficient zones of the central region, thus the annular zones with large radii.<br>
An object of the present invention, therefore, is to provide a pressure intermediary overcoming the disadvantages of the described state of the art.<br>
The object is achieved according to the invention by a pressure intermediary as defined in claim 1.<br>

platform;<br>

The invention will now be explained on the basis of an example of an embodiment presented in the drawings, the figures of which show as follows:<br>
Fig. la	schematic, longitudinal section through the edge region of a pressure<br>
intermediary of the invention; and<br>
Fig. 2a	detail view of a longitudinal section through the membrane bed of a<br>
pressure intermediary of the invention.<br>
The hydraulic pressure intermediary shown in Fig. 1 includes a platform 1, which has an essentially axi-symmetric, bowl-shaped surface 2, with a flat, annular, platform-surface edge region 3 and a platform-surface central region 4 depressed relative to the platform-surface edge region 3 and surrounded by the platform-surface edge region 3. Further shown is an annular platform-surface transition region 5, which borders, on its inner side, on the platform-surface central region 4 and, on its outer side, on the platform-surface edge region 3. The platform-surface transition region is embodied axi-symmetrically in this example of an embodiment and, indeed, in such a manner that the fall of the platform-surface edge region to the platform-surface transition region is steeper than the rise of the platform-surface transition region to the platform-surface central region.<br>
The pressure intermediary further includes a bowl-shaped separating-membrane 6, which is connected with the platform-surface edge region 3 along a surrounding weld-seam 7 or solder connection. Separating-membrane 6 is formed by pressing it against the bowl-shaped platform surface.<br><br><br>
Formed between the separating membrane 6 and the surface 2 of the platform 1 is a cavity 8, which is filled with a pressure-transfer liquid. The cavity serves as a pressure chamber and communicates via an opening (not shown) in the surface of the platform with a hydraulic path, in order to transfer the pressure on the separating-membrane 2 to a pressure measuring cell.<br>
On the left side of Fig. 1, a radially inwardly located region of the pressure intermediary has been cut away. In this region, a membrane bed and the separating membrane conformed thereto exhibit an annular wave pattern. The size relationships between this wave pattern 9 and the platform-surface transition region are better shown in Fig. 2. As shown, the annular, concentric waves and the platform-surface central region have essentially flatter contours than the platform-surface transition region at the edge. In the example of an embodiment, the axial distance between wave and valleys and waves peaks amounts to about 0.14 mm in the case of a radial separation of more than 3 mm between neighboring wave peaks. The selected wave contour enables sufficient volume stroke of the separating membrane, without overly stiffening such.<br>
Comparative testing of the pressure intermediary of the invention and pressure intermediaries of the state of the art was conducted. The separating membranes of the pressure intermediaries of the state of the art had no moat. The pressure intermediaries were subjected to multiple temperature shocks. The pressure intermediaries of the state of the art exhibited thereafter a zero-point shift of about 1.2 mbar, while the pressure intermediary of the invention showed a zero-point shift lying between 0.2 and 0.4 mbar. The zero-point shift tendency in the case of pressure intermediaries of the invention with an asymmetric transition zone was toward smaller numbers as compared with the pressure intermediaries of the invention with a symmetric transition zone.<br><br><br>
