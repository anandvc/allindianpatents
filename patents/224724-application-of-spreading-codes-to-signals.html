				<td>The invention relates to methods and apparatus for spreading and/or despreading<br>
communications signals.<br>
As is well known, spreading codes are applied to communications signals in code division<br>
multiple access (CDMA) schemes. Spreading codes are used to produce spread-spectrum<br>
signals in signal transmission processes and are also used to despread spread-spectrum<br>
signals in signal reception processes.<br>
At least in so far as the current Universal Mobile Telephone System (UMTS) standards are<br>
concerned, the process of spreading a signal is defined as the application of at least one of a<br>
scrambling code and a channelisation code to the signal. The UMTS standards define the<br>
scrambling code as a sequence of complex values each having real and imaginary parts.<br>
The UMTS standards define the channelisation code as a sequence of wholly real values.<br>
A scrambling code and a channelisation code can be applied sequentially to a signal to be<br>
spread or despread. Alternatively, a scrambling code and a channelisation code can be<br>
multiplied together such that their product is then applied to a signal to be spread or<br>
despread.<br>
Figure 8 shows a prior art circuit for spreading or despreading an input signal (whose<br>
values have the complex format f+jg) by the application of a scrambling code (whose<br>
values have the complex format a-jb) and a channelisation code (whose values are real and<br>
denoted as c). As shown in Figure 8, the circuit comprises a scrambling code generator 50,<br>
a channelisation code generator 52, a NOT gate 56, two XOR gates 58 and 59, five<br>
multipliers 60, 62,64, 68 and 70 and two adders 72 and 74. The inputs to the circuit are a,<br>
b, c, f and g and the real and imaginary components of complex values emerge from the<br>
adders 72 and 74 respectively. The emergent complex values form a spread signal if the<br>
circuit is being used for spreading, whereas, if the circuit is being used for despreading, the<br>
emergent complex values can be accumulated over symbol periods.<br>
The XOR gates 58 and 59 combine the parts of the values of the scrambling and<br>
channelisation codes and the multipliers 60, 62, 64 and 70 form products on the basis of the<br>
components of input signal values and the outputs of the XOR gates 58 and 59. Multiplier<br>
68 multiplies the output of multiplier 70 by -1, thereby performing a negation. The<br>
products formed by the multipliers are then combined in adders 72 and 74 to produce the<br>
components or values of the output signal.<br>
One object of the invention is to provide an alternative scheme for applying spreading<br>
codes to signals to achieve spreading or despreading.<br>
According to one aspect, the invention provides CDMA communications apparatus for<br>
applying one or more code values to an input signal value to produce an output signal<br>
value, wherein the code value or values may lie only either on or equidistant from an<br>
orthogonal pair of axes defining a two dimensional signal space, the input and output signal<br>
values each have components along each axis and the apparatus comprises logic means for<br>
combining the code value or values to produce two multiplier values and a selector value,<br>
multiplying means for creating two product values by multiplying the multiplier values<br>
with respective components of the input signal value, negating means for negating one of<br>
the product values to produce a third product value and selecting means for selecting, on<br>
the basis of the selector value, two of the three product values to become the components<br>
of the output signal value.<br>
The invention also consists in a method for applying one or more code values to an input<br>
signal value to produce an output signal value in a CDMA communications scheme,<br>
wherein the code value or values may lie only either on or equidistant from an orthogonal<br>
pair of axes defining a two dimensional signal space, the input and output signal values<br>
each have components along each axis and the method comprises processing, via a logic<br>
function, the code value or values to produce two multiplier values and a selector value,<br>
creating two product values by multiplying the multiplier values with respective<br>
components of the input signal value, negating one of the product values to produce a third<br>
product value and selecting, on the basis of the selector signal, two of the three product<br>
values to become the components of the output signal value.<br>
Thus, the invention provides a scheme for applying spreading codes to signals, for the<br>
purpose of despreading or spreading.<br>
Advantageously, it is possible to implement the invention in hardware in a manner which<br>
uses less silicon area. Specifically, this saving can be achieved by using fewer adders and<br>
fewer multipliers than the known art discussed above. Also, it is possible, in conjunction<br>
with certain embodiments of the invention, to use a smaller number of bits to represent<br>
each of the complex components of a value of the output signal than the known art<br>
discussed above, which enables components which manipulate values of the output signal<br>
to be designed to occupy less silicon area.<br>
In one embodiment, there is a single code value to be applied to the input signal value. The<br>
code value is equidistant from, and has components along, the axes mentioned above. The<br>
logic means is arranged to pass one of the components of the code value as the multiplier<br>
values and to XOR the code value components to produce the selector signal.<br>
In another embodiment, there are first and second code values for application to the input<br>
signal. The first code value is equidistant from, and has components along, the axes<br>
mentioned above and the second code value lies on one of those axes. The logic means is<br>
arranged to XOR a component of the first code value with the second code value to<br>
produce a value for use as both multiplier values and to XOR the first code value<br>
components to produce the selector signal.<br>
In another embodiment, there are first, second and third code values for application to the<br>
input signal. The first code value is equidistant from, and has components along, the axes<br>
mentioned above. The second and third code values each lie on one of the axes (not<br>
necessarily the same one). The logic means is arranged to XOR one of the components of<br>
the first code value with one of the second and third code values and to XOR the other of<br>
the components of the first code value with the other of the second and third code values in<br>
order to produce the multiplier values. The logic means is also arranged to XOR the first<br>
code value components to produce the selector value.<br>
In another embodiment, there are first, second and third code values for application to the<br>
input signal. Unlike the embodiment described in the preceding paragraph, the first and<br>
second codes are each equally distant from, and have components along, the axes. The<br>
third code value lies on one of the axes. The logic means is arranged to XOR the<br>
components of the first code, XOR the components of the second code, XOR the results of<br>
those XOR operations and adjust the result by a NOT function to produce the selector<br>
value. The logic means is also arranged to provide the components of the first and second<br>
codes to a group of AND gates, some of whose inputs are inverted. The outputs of the<br>
AND gates are combined in an OR gate, whose output is then XORed with the third code<br>
value to produce both multiplier values.<br>
In some embodiments, there is a discrepancy between the manner in which the invention<br>
applies the codes to the input signal value and a desired process multiplying the input<br>
signal value by the code value or values. In such embodiments, it is sometimes desirable to<br>
use means for rotating the output signal value by 45° about the origin of the phase space<br>
axes. This rotation takes account of a phase element of the discrepancy. In some<br>
embodiments where a discrepancy exists, it may be unnecessary to attempt a correction<br>
because of, for example, a cancellation of the discrepancy between a pilot channel and data<br>
channel.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the invention is deployed within a participant of a<br>
wireless-communications network using a CDMA communications scheme.<br>
By way of example only, certain embodiments of the invention will now be described with<br>
reference to the accompanying figures, in which:<br>

The mobile telephone shown in Figure 1 is capable of communicating using a CDMA<br>
scheme. Figure 1 shows only the most basic elements of the telephone, namely an antenna<br>
10, a radio frequency (RF) section 12, a chip rate processor (CRP) 14 and a bit rate<br>
processor (BRP) 16. The functions of these elements will now be described in brief from<br>
the perspectives of signal transmission and reception.<br>
In the context of signal transmission, the BRP produces an information signal representing,<br>
say, digitised speech. The information signal is encoded to make it less susceptible to<br>
errors. The information signal is supplied to the CRP 14 which applies one or more<br>
spreading codes to the information signal. The CRP produces a spread-spectrum version of<br>
the information signal and the spread-spectrum signal is provided to the RF section for<br>
modulation onto a RF carrier wave. The modulated RF carrier wave then undergoes<br>
power amplification and is transmitted from antenna 10.<br>
In the context of signal reception, modulated carrier waves arrive at the antenna 10 and are<br>
demodulated by the RF section 12 to recover a base-band spread-spectrum signal. The<br>
spread-spectrum signal is then passed to the CRP 14 which performs a despreading<br>
operation using, for example, a rake receiver algorithm. The output of the CRP 14 is a<br>
despread information signal which can be processed by the BRP 16 to recover, for<br>
example, digitised speech for presentation to the user of the telephone.<br>
The CRP 14 is responsible for the spreading of information signals to be transmitted and<br>
for despreading received base-band spread-spectrum signals. Both of these roles involve<br>
the application of one or more spreading codes or spreading signals to the CRP input. The<br>
base-band spread-spectrum signals passing between the RF section 12 and the CRP 14<br>
comprise a series of data elements called chips and these signals are said to be at the "chip<br>
rate". Information signals passing between the BRP 16 and the CRP 14 comprise<br>
sequences of data elements called symbols and these signals are said to be at the "symbol<br>
rate". Sometimes, the BRP is known as a symbol rate processor.<br>
The relationship between chips and symbols can be outlined as follows. Consider the case<br>
where a single spreading code, comprising a sequence of values, is to be used. In the<br>
context of spreading an information signal for transmission purposes, the rate of<br>
application of the values of the exemplary code to the symbols is typically such that several<br>
values of the code are applied to each symbol, the application of each value generating a<br>
chip. In the context of despreading, for reception purposes, a spread-spectrum signal that<br>
was created using the exemplary code, each value of the exemplary spreading code is<br>
applied to a respective chip of the base-band spread-spectrum signal (with the code being<br>
recirculated as necessary to process all of the chips). The results of this process are<br>
accumulated over the duration of each symbol period in order to recover a stream of<br>
symbols constituting an information signal.<br>
The process by which the CRP 14 applies spreading codes to chip or symbol rate signals<br>
will now be discussed with reference to Figure 2.<br>
In Figure 2, two spreading codes are to be applied to signals undergoing<br>
spreading/despreading. The two spreading codes are a scrambling code and a<br>
channelisation code. The scrambling code is provided by a scrambling code source 18 and<br>
the channelisation code is provided by a channelisation code source 20. The signal that is<br>
undergoing spreading or despreading is applied to terminals f and g and the output of the<br>
process is taken from terminals n and p.<br>
The scrambling code is complex and each of its sequence of values takes the form of one of<br>
the following complex numbers: 1+j, 1-j, -1+j and -1-j. In binary format, these complex<br>
numbers are represented by two bit words, in which the first and second bits of the word<br>
represent the real and imaginary parts of the complex numbers, respectively. The binary<br>
value 0 is used to represent the decimal value +1 and the binary value 1 is used to represent<br>
decimal value -1. Accordingly, the aforementioned complex numbers translate into 00,01,<br>
10 and 11, respectively, in binary form. The channelisation code on the other hand, is<br>
wholly real-valued and can take the decimal values of +1 and -1. These values are<br>
rendered as 0 and 1, respectively, in binary form.<br>
In Figure 2, the real and imaginary binary parts of each value of the scrambling code are<br>
applied to terminals a and b, respectively. The binary values of the channelisation code are<br>
applied to terminal c. The signal which is undergoing spreading or despreading comprises<br>
a sequence of complex values. The real and imaginary binary parts of each value of this<br>
signal are applied to terminals f and g respectively. The output signal is taken from<br>
terminals n and p and has the same binary complex format as the signal applied to<br>
terminals f and g. The numbers applied to each of terminals f, g, n and p may be multiple<br>
bits in width.<br>
The signals a, b and c are applied to the inputs of XOR gates 22 and 24. The output d of<br>
XOR gate 22 is the result of performing the XOR operation on the binary parts of the<br>
complex scrambling code value. The output e of XOR gate 24 is the result of performing<br>
an XOR operation on the channelisation code value c and the real part a of the scrambling<br>
code value. The truth table for the XOR gates 22 and 24 is shown in Figure 3.<br>
The part of the circuit of Figure 2 that processes signals d and e comprises three multipliers<br>
26, 28 and 30 and two multiplexers 32 and 34. Multipliers 26 and 30 produce two product<br>
signals k and h respectively that are the results of multiplying signal e with signals g and f<br>
respectively. Product signal h is supplied to inputs of both multiplexers 32 and 34.<br>
Product signal k is supplied to an input of multiplexer 34. Additionally, product signal k is<br>
supplied to multiplier 28 where it is multiplied by the decimal value -1 to produce product<br>
signal m. In other words, multiplier 28 acts as an inverter to change the sign of product<br>
signal k. Product signal m is supplied to an input of multiplexer 32. Signal d is applied to<br>
the control inputs of both multiplexers 32 and 34 and therefore controls which one of the<br>
two inputs of each multiplexer is passed to the output of the multiplexer. If signal d has the<br>
binary value 1 then product signal m is passed to terminal n and product signal h is passed<br>
to terminal p. If signal d has the binary value 0, then product signal h is passed to terminal<br>
n and product signal k is passed to terminal p. As mentioned earlier, the signals at<br>
terminals n and p form the real and imaginary components of the complex-valued output<br>
signal. Figure 4 provides a truth table giving the outputs at n and p as a function of the<br>
inputs applied to the aforementioned terminals.<br>
The circuit shown in Figure 2 is capable of perfonning both despreading and spreading. If<br>
a chip rate signal is applied to terminals f and g, then the results emerging at terminals n<br>
and p can be accumulated over symbol periods to recover a symbol rate signal.<br>
Conversely, if the signal applied to terminals f and g is at the symbol rate, then a chip rate<br>
signal can be taken from terminals n and p. The complex values applied to terminals f and<br>
g and supplied from terminals n and p are typically multiple bits in length. The durations<br>
over which the values applied to terminals a, b, c, f and g are held will dictate whether<br>
spreading or despreading is performed, as will be apparent to the skilled person. It should<br>
also be borne in mind that, if a spreading operation is defined as the multiplication of a<br>
complex data value v by a complex spreading code u, then the corresponding despreading<br>
process performed on a complex received signal value v is defined as v • u+.<br>
The calculation performed by the circuit of Figure 2 is:<br>
Thus, if the circuit is being used to scramble using a code of a-bj to produce a result s+tj<br>
then the output of the circuit, in terms of s+tj, is:<br>
On the other hand, if the circuit is being used for despreading to counteract the effects of<br>
scrambling using a code a+bj to produce a despread result w+zj, then the output of the<br>
circuit, in terms of w+zj, is:<br>
In both cases, it will be apparent that the desired result is distorted by an amount y(l +J).<br>
This distortion can be corrected by a scaling unit 35 which multiplies n+pj by 1-j since<br>
1-2(l +j) -(1 -j) = 1. In some embodiments, it may be unnecessary to perform such scaling,<br>
as will now be described.<br>
In a UMTS system, a pilot signal containing reference data is often transmitted alongside<br>
one or more data signals. The reference data contained in the pilot signal will be known to<br>
a receiver acquiring the pilot signal and the received pilot signal can be used to make<br>
channel measurements, i.e. measurements of the properties of the environment through<br>
which the pilot signal propagated. Since the data signals will have travelled through the<br>
same environment as the pilot signal, the channel measurements can be used to correct the<br>
received data signals. If it is arranged that a data signal and a pilot signal are both spread<br>
using a circuit of the kind shown in Figure 2, then both the data and pilot signals will suffer<br>
from distortion by the j(l +/) factor. However, the channel measurements made by a<br>
receiver on the pilot signal would detect the y(l +j) factor and the application of the<br>
channel estimates to the correction of the data channel would correct the data channel for<br>
the y(1 +j) factor. Thus, a scaling circuit is not needed in the transmitter. Likewise, if a<br>
receiver were to despread pilot and data signals using a circuit of the type shown in Figure<br>
2, the distortion of the pilot signal by y(l +j) in the receiver would cancel out the<br>
equivalent distortion in the data signal.<br>
If the output n+pj is to be used for a power calculation, or the like, in which the square of<br>
its modulus is required, then the phase part of the distortion factor 7/1(1+j) can be ignored<br>
although one would still have to take account of the spurious halving of the squared<br>
modulus (unless one were comparing the moduli of signals all generated in the same way<br>
and all featuring the 1/2 factor). Such calculations can be used in a receiver (i.e. where the<br>
circuit of Figure 2 is being used for despreading) to measure signal power which is then<br>
used to detect the presence, and timing of, incoming signals.<br>
The outputs d and e in Figure 2 have an additional significance if one notionally scales the<br>
channelisation code by the complex number 1+j. This rotates the channelisation code<br>
anti-clockwise by 45° in the complex plane. The channelisation code then takes only<br>
values 1+j and -1-j. If the channelisation code is taken to have this complex format, then<br>
the product of the complex scrambling code and the content of the complex channelisation<br>
code can only assume values which are wholly real or wholly imaginary and which are<br>
either negative or positive. In this scenario, values of binary 0 and binary 1 at output d<br>
indicative that this product is real and imaginary, respectively, and values of binary 0 and<br>
binary 1 at output e indicate that this product is positive and negative, respectively.<br>
If one compares the circuits of Figures 2 and 8, it will be apparent that the circuit of Figure<br>
2 takes up less silicon area as it omits the adders of and two of the multipliers of, Figure 8.<br>
Admittedly, Figure 2 utilises two multiplexers instead but there is still a net saving in<br>
silicon area.<br>
Figure 5 shows an alternative construction for the circuit of Figure 2, catering for the<br>
situation where only a scrambling code is used. The circuit of Figure 5 is equivalent to<br>
fixing the value of c to binary 0 in Figure 2. In Figure 5, the evolution of signal d is the<br>
same as in Figure 2 whereas signal e is now simply the same as signal a. The production of<br>
the output signal at terminals n and p from the input signal at terminals f and g using values<br>
d and e is unchanged and follows the truth table given in Figure 4.<br>
The 3GPP standards require some data channels to contain predetermined symbols at<br>
predetermined positions in the channel. These symbols form a pilot sequence (distinct<br>
from the pilot signal mentioned earlier). A receiver can correlate the known pilot sequence<br>
against a signal received through such a channel in order to track the timing of the<br>
incoming signal. The symbols in the pilot sequence are complex numbers and all of the<br>
complex components of the symbols share the same magnitude. However, the signs of<br>
complex components may vary within and between symbols. The correlation of such a<br>
pilot sequence against a received symbol train can be regarded as despreading the symbol<br>
train using the pilot sequence. Or to put it another way, the pilot sequence can be treated as<br>
a spreading code. Figure 7 shows an embodiment which implements such an approach.<br>
The part of the circuit of Figure 7 that utilises the signals d and e operates in the same way<br>
as described in the previous embodiments. The circuit of Figure 7 also retains the<br>
scrambling code source 18 and the channelisation code source 20. However, these entities<br>
are now complemented by a further scrambling code source 76 which provides the<br>
conjugate pilot sequence symbols in the form x-yj. The circuit of Figure 7 aims to multiply<br>
together the quantities a-bj, x-yj, c and f+gj. However, the calculation that is actually<br>
performed by the circuit is:<br>
which is a factor of 1/2 less than the desired result. It should be noted that, in contrast with<br>
the circuit of Figure 2, the factor representing the difference between the actual and desired<br>
results is not a complex quantity. Therefore, if a scaling unit is employed in conjunction<br>
with the Figure 7 circuit then the scaling unit does not need to rotate the phase of the output<br>
n+pj.<br>
The part of the circuit that produces the signals d and e from the three code sources will<br>
now be described.<br>
The signals a and b are input to an XOR gate 78 and the signals x and y are input to another<br>
XOR gate 80. The outputs of these two XOR gates then become the inputs to a further<br>
XOR gate, 82. The output of XOR gate 82 is altered by a NOT function (as indicated by<br>
the circle following the XOR gate) in order to produce signal d.<br>
The signals a, b, x and y are also provided to various inputs of a row of four three-input<br>
AND gates 84-90. AND gates 84 and 88 each receive signals a, b and y and AND gates 86<br>
and 90 each receive signals a, b and x. All of the inputs to AND gate 84 are altered by<br>
NOT functions, as are input a to AND gate 86 and inputs b and x to AND gate 90.<br>
The outputs of the AND gates 84-90 are supplied to a four-input OR gate 92. The output<br>
of the OR gate 92 and the channelisation code value c are then provided as the inputs of an<br>
XOR gate 94, whose output is signal e.<br>
The output symbols, n+pj, can be accumulated over a suitable period in order to correlate<br>
the pilot sequence from scrambling source 76 against a data signal that has been subjected<br>
to spreading by scrambling code a+bj and channelisation code c.<br>
Moreover, it will be apparent that the circuit of Figure 7 could also be used to introduce a<br>
pilot sequence to a signal that is destined for transmission. As shown, Figure 7 would<br>
illustrate the application of a pilot sequence x-yj to a signal that is being scrambled by a<br>
code a-bj.<br>
Above, circuits have been described which use one or two scrambling codes with zero or<br>
one channelisation codes. On the basis of the foregoing description of those circuits, it is<br>
possible, as would be understood by a person skilled in the field of the invention, to<br>
extrapolate and produce different circuits that apply various numbers of scrambling and<br>
channelisation codes to a signal, simply by redesigning the logic circuit that produces the<br>
signals d and e from the scrambling and, if any, channelisation code or codes.<br>
To aid an understanding of how the invention can be extended to various other spreading<br>
code combinations, it is useful to characterise the spreading codes in terms of the following<br>
code types (using unity for real and imaginary magnitudes for the sake of simplicity):<br>
Forming a product of at least two codes of these types produces another code of type 1-3 or<br>
of a fourth type:<br>
Type 4 : 1, -1, j or -j (i.e. either wholly real or wholly imaginary)<br>
In fact, it can be seen that the type 1 and 2 codes are merely subsets of type 4, so,<br>
henceforth, only types 3 and 4 will be discussed for the sakes of clarity and brevity.<br>
If one forms a product of some codes drawn from type 3 and/or 4 then the resultant code<br>
will belong to:<br>
- type 3 if the product contains an odd number of type 3 codes.<br>
- type 4 if the product contains an even number of type 3 codes.<br>
It will be apparent that the circuits described earlier use the following combinations of code<br>
types:<br>
Therefore, another way of categorising the variants that may be devised by adjusting the<br>
logic circuit that produces signals d and e is to refer to the numbers of type 3 and 4<br>
spreading codes that are input to the logic circuit. If the logic circuit is redesigned to<br>
accept N1 type 3 codes and N2 type 4 spreading codes to produce the signals d and e such<br>
that the entire circuit overall is aimed at calculating the result Pr • (f+ gj), where Pr is the<br>
product of all of the spreading codes, then what the entire circuit will in fact produce is:<br>
Therefore, there is no phase rotation between the desired (Pr • (f+gf)) and actual results<br>
when N1 is even.<br>
Certain embodiments, such as that of Figure 6, do not conform to generalisation in terms of<br>
types 3 and 4 that was just mentioned. Sometimes, it is desirable to apply separate<br>
channelisation codes to the real and imaginary components of input signal values. Figure<br>
6 shows an arrangement for achieving this. Broadly speaking, the circuit of Figure 6 has<br>
the same construction as the circuit of Figure 2. Elements in Figure 6 that appear in Figure<br>
2 retain the same reference numerals and their function will not be described again. In<br>
Figure 6, the output of XOR gate 24 is now supplied only to multiplier 30 which acts on<br>
component f of a presented input signal value. An additional channelisation code generator<br>
21, producing the channelisation code value q, appears in Figure 6. The channelisation<br>
code value q is supplied to an input of a further XOR gate 25. The other input of XOR gate<br>
25 is the signal a from scrambling code generator 18. The output r of XOR gate 25 is<br>
supplied to multiplier 26 where it acts on component g of a presented input signal value. In<br>
other aspects, the operation of the circuit of Figure 6 is the same as that of Figure 2.<br>
