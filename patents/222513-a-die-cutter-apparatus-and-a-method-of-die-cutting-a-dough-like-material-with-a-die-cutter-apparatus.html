				<td>The present invention relates to a die-cutter apparatus and to a method of die-cutting a dough-like material with a die-cutter apparatus and more particularly to a die-cutting apparatus to cut pieces from a sheet of dough-like material such as paste for making mosquito repellant coils, dough for biscuits and the like.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the manufacture of mosquito repellant coils, dough-like sheet of moist material is passed under a die cutting apparatus (In this description, the term dough is used to describe a dough like material that is used to make mosquito coils, biscuits, etc. and other viscous or rubbery materials. The die-cutting apparatus consist primarily of a cutter device and a barrier device. In current manufacturing method and apparatus, the die-cutting apparatus is moved downwards along a vertical axis from a rest position where a sheet of dough is cut into the required shape. The cut dough sticks to the die-cutter device by surface tension. The die-cutting apparatus is then moved upwards along the vertical axis and then moved along a horizontal axis. Thereafter the cutter device is withdrawn vertically upwards, then to pass the barrier device which is stationary within the die-cutting apparatus. At this position the cut dough held in the cutter device by surface tension forces comes across a barrier device as a barrier in its nath of travel. The cut dough falls onto a tray below.<br>
A plurality of die-cutting apparatus, for example seven such apparatus are assembled onto a single housing body. The vertical and thereafter lateral movements of the housing body (containing the plurality of die-cutting apparatus), subjects the housing body to short jerky movements. Such movements of the housing body require large forces, resulting in greater wear and tear of the moving parts.<br><br>
In typical machine layouts, the die-cutting apparatus travels a lateral distance of 460mm and a vertical distance of 30mm making a total distance of 2 x 460 + 2 x 30 = 980 mm. The cycle time of the movement of the die cutting apparatus is undesirably long.<br>
Due to the lateral movement of the die-cutting apparatus, a 'L-shaped layout* of the die cutting machine and the conveyor systems transferring the uncut dough and cut dough is required. Consequently L-shaped layout of the die-cutting machine and the conveyor system for material handling, requires large shop floor area.<br>
Another problem frequently encountered in prior art die cutting machines is the unacceptably large percentage of spoilt coils. After the sheet of dough is cut by the cutter device, the cut dough sticks by surface tension to the cutter device while the die cutting apparatus moves laterally. When the cutter device is retracted upwards the cut dough meets the barrier device in its path of travel thereafter, the cut dough should fall onto a tray below by gravitational force. However, often parts of the cut dough stick to the barrier device. This is called stamping waste and it creates two sets of problems. Firstly the remaining part of a coil on the tray cannot be used and has to be discarded or recycled. The operator has to replace the spoilt coil with a good coil taken from an adjacent tray. Secondly the presence of portions of dough on the barrier device will spoil the subsequent die cutting and stamping cycles. Therefore the production line has to be temporarily stopped, in order to clean the cutter device and the barrier device, before commencing the production cycle. The downtime of, the die cutting apparatus is undesirably long and results in unnecessary waste of resources.<br>
Thus it is an objective of the present invention to reduce what is perceived as inefficiencies in the prior art die cutting apparatus.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A die-cutter apparatus mounted onto a housing body to cut out desired shapes from a sheet of dough-like material. It consist of an assembly of a cutter device with cutting edges defining the shape of the cut material and a barrier device housed within the cutter device. The cutter device and the barrier device are moveable coaxially and independently of each other. The barrier device is retractably moveable along the cutter device towards the cutting edges so as to eject the cut dough-like material from the cutting edge on to a receptacle.<br>
In a first position the die-cutter apparatus is distanced from the receptacle containing the dough-like material to be die-cut wherein the barrier device is distanced part from the cutting edge. In a second position the die-cutter apparatus is in contact with the dough-like material on the receptacle wherein the barrier device is distanced apart from the cutting-edge and the cutting-edge in a penetrated position within the dough-like material. In a third position the die-cutter apparatus is distanced from the receptacle wherein the barrier device is distanced apart from the cutter device and the cut dough like material is held by the cutting edge. In a fourth position the die-cutter apparatus is distanced from the receptacle wherein the barrier device extended marginally beyond the cutting edge such that cut-dough-like material is displaced from the cutting-edge. In a fifth position the die-cutter apparatus is distanced from the receptacle wherein the barrier device is in a retracted position within the cutter device.<br>
The housing body is stationery in relation to ground. The cutter apparatus is moveable along a vertical axis in relation to the housing body. The said dough like material is a damp mixture of mosquito repellant material which is formed into mosquito repellant coils. The dough like material is biscuit making dough mixture or rubbery material. The desired shape of the dough is a coil. The cutter device is profiled.<br><br>
The invention further describes a method of die cutting a dough like material utilizing a die cutter apparatus consisting of an assembly of a cutter device with a cutting edge defining the shape of the cut material and a barrier device within the cutter device. At least one said assembly mounted onto a housing body. The method comprising of the following steps:<br>
a)moving the assembly downwards along a vertical axis until the cutting edge cuts the dough like material placed on a receptacle;<br>
b)moving the assembly upwards along the vertical axis with the cut dough adhering the cutting edge;<br>
c) emoving the planar receptacle which held the dough like material;<br>
d) oving the barrier device downward to eject the cut dough from the cutting edge;<br>
e) etracting the barrier device to a position away from the cutting edge.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Referring to Figures 1 to 5, there is shown a die cutter apparatus (10) comprising of an assembly of two major component parts, a cutter device (12) and a barrier device (14). The cutter device (12) is essentially a spiral coil of vertical rigid plates (13) with sharp cutting edges (16). The vertical wall of the rigid plates are parallel and spaced apart equidistantly from one another. At the upper part of the rigid plates, a bracket (18) is used to hold and keep the rigid plates apart (See Figure 5). The bracket (18) is a rectangular block of rigid material, such as metal or alloy, with spaced apart slits (20) to accommodate and hold the upper portion of the rigid plates of the cutter device (12). The rectangular block (18) is secured to a shaft member (22) which is in turn secured to a pneumatic piston or other means to move the cutter device along a vertical axis. The present cutter device (12) of the<br>
embodiment is configured to cut a pair of spiral mosquito coils.<br>
- "The barrier device (14^Tconsists of a spiral ring of rigid material configured to move coaxially along the spiral rings of vertical plates (13). The barrier device is held together by a plurality of holding members (24) secured to a holding plate (26). The bottom face (2§) of the barrier device is flat and can advantageously include<br>
embossed matter sbh as letters, numerals or other graphical features. The barrier<br>
device is slideable coaxially along the cutter device independently of the cutter device (12).<br>
The die-cutter apparatus is mounted onto a housing body which is stationary in relation to ground. Suitable means are provided within the housing body to effect vertical movement of the shaft (22) the cutter device and the barrier device along a common longitudinal axis. The means could include hydraulic, pneumatic or other mechanical leverage means. This arrangement allows the lowering of the die-cutter apparatus onto a receptacle where the dough to be cut is positioned and the subsequent lifting of the die-cutter apparatus to a desired height above the receptacle.<br>
Winner the cutter device (12) and the barrier device (14) are moveable coaxially along a common axis and independently of each other.<br>
For ease of describing the operation of the die-cutter apparatus assembly, an operating cycle of the apparatus is devised into four periods. The relative position of the cutter device (12) and the barrier device at the completion of each period is referred to as the first, second, third and fourth position respectively.<br>
At the first position and period (before the dough is cut), the die-cutter apparatus assembly (10) is above the receptacle (which is to contain the dough-like material). The barrier device (14) is distanced from the cutting edge (16). In the second period the die-cutter apparatus assembly is moved along a longitudinal axis preferably vertically towards the receptacle. The cutter device (12) and the barrier device are still distanced apart at this second position. The die-cutter apparatus assembly is moved along the vertical axis for a predetermined length in a manner that the cutting edge (16) just shears into the dough. At this position the barrier device can be urge forward to stamp the dough-like material and thereafter retract.<br>
In the third period, after the dough is cut (or sheared), the die-cutter apparatus assembly is retracted along the longitudinal axis. It will be appreciated at this third position, the cutter device and the barrier device are still distanced apart. The cut dough is held between the cutting edge (16) by surface tension forces. In the fourth period, whilst the die-cutter apparatus assembly is distanced apart from the receptacle, the barrier device 914) is moved coaxially towards the cutting edges. As a result the cut dough on the cutting edges are ejected or pushed out of the cutter device. The cut dough in the form of spiral coils of dough is received in a receptacle. After the ejection of the cut-dough, the barrier device (14) is retracted along the longitudinal axis to its fifth position. (The die-cutter apparatus is now ready to commence the next cycle). The receptacle onto which the cut dough is received, is removed from under the die-cutter apparatus. Although the movement of the die-cutter apparatus assembly and the movement of the cutter device and barrier device is described in distinct<br>
periods, it would be appreciated in practice the movements would be continuous and synchronized.<br>
The receptacle to hold the uncut dough is preferable a conveyor means, which is used to transport sheets of uncut dough pre-mixed and made into sheets at a different location in the plant. The receptacle to receive the cut dough is preferably a tray. The cut dough is gathered in a tray, which tray is suitable to be introduced into a drier chamber to dry the cut-dough.<br>
The cutter device (12) in particular the cutting edge (16) can be profiled so as to hold cut-dough like material from the receptacle by frictional forces.<br>
The working of the die cutter apparatus assembly together with other features will be described now. A plurality of die cutter apparatus is mounted into a housing body.<br>
In this method, the die cutter apparatus only travels downwards and upwards along a longitudinal axis preferably vertical axis and there is no lateral or horizontal movement of the die cutter. The vertical distance traveled is about 100 mm, thus making a total distance traveled to only 200 mm. There is a tremendous savings in distance traveled by die cutter apparatus and in the time saved per cycle. As the cut dough is now pushed down by the barrier device (14) from the cutter device (12) the cut dough falls off the cutter device completely, without leaving portions or part of the cut dough on the cutter device or the barrier device.<br>
The barrier device can also be adopted for stamping or embossing on the dough. In this arrangement, the exposed part of the barrier device may include mirror images of trademarks, logos or other symbols or letters etc. after the dough is cut, the barrier device can move down to stamp/emboss on the surface of the cut dough and thereafter the barrier device is withdrawn upwards. The cutter apparatus assembly then moves vertically upwards. The rest of the process is as described before.<br>
The cutter device apparatus can be used to cut various shapes from sheets of dough- like materials such as dough for making biscuits and wet mixture for making mosquito coils and other viscous or rubbery materials. Other applications of the inventive concept can be envisaged.<br><br>
