				<td>This invention relates to an automatic regulated water tap for use at the public places.<br>
It is seen that water tapes are used at the public places for use by the public to get the water. A number of conventional water taps are known in the prior art. However, the main disadvantage associated with all kind of water tape is that the water leakage is very frequent.<br>
Another disadvantage is that the drainage of water is continued even after fulfilling of the pot with water and unless the tap is again operated by the user.<br>
Therefore the main object of this invention is to provide an automatic regulated water tap for use at the public places.<br>
According to this invention there is provided an automatic regulated water tap characterised in that a first platform mounted on a small helical spring rested on the base plate of a second platform being disposed in an outer body of the tap, a big helical spring is provided below the base plate of said second platform such that the lower end of said spring being rested on the bottom base of said body, a first connecting rod having a gate valve secured at the lower end thereof being secured to the lower surface of said first platform such that to allow the water supply to the outlet of the tap upon placing an empty pot onto said first platform, a second<br><br>
rod having a stop valve secured therewith being provided with the lower end of said gate valve such that to stop the water supply from the main water pipe line to the tap upon filling the water into said pot to a predetermined weight of water.<br>
In accordance with this invention an automatic regulated water tap has a first platform provided over a second platform and the extended base thereof is rested on to a small helical spring which is mounted on the base plate of the second platform disposed into the tap body. A big helical spring resting upon the bottom base of the tap body is secured to the base plate of the second platform for supporting the platform thereon. A first connecting rod having a gate valve secured at the bottom end thereof is connected to the lower surface of said first platform such that to allow water supply to the tap upon placing a water pot on to the first platform. A second connecting rod having a stop valve secured at the bottom end thereof is provided with the gate valve such that to stop the water supply upon downward movement of the second platform. The gate valve has a slot for accommodating the upper end of the second connecting rod for the adjustment thereof during the operation of the device. The water supply is allowed through the gate valve when the water pot is placed on to the first platform and the gate valve moves downwardly and comes in flow communication with the water supply pipe. When the water pot is filled up with water upto a predetermined weight of water, a second platform starts moving downwardly and thus the second outlet of the main water pipe line is closed and thus the water supply to the water tap is stopped.<br>
An  automatic  regulated  water tap for  use  at  public<br>
places  according  to a preferred embodiment  is  herein<br>
described  and illustrated in the accompanying  drawings<br>
wherein:<br>
Fig.l shows the sectional plan view of the device«<br><br>
Referring to the drawings, an automatic regulatsd watar tap of this invention has a first platform 1 and the downwardly extended portion thereof is mounted on a small helical spring 2 resting on a base plate 3 of the second platform 4 disposed into the tap body 5- A big helical spring 6 is provided between the base plate 3 and the bottom end of the body 5. A first connecting rod 7 having a gate valve S secured at the bottom end thereof is secured to the lower surface of the first platform 1 such that upon placing the water pot onto the platform 1, the gate valve 8 moves downwardly and water supply from the pipe line 12 to the water outlet 14 is started- A slot 9 is provided in the gate valve S. A second connecting rod 10 having a stop valve 11 secured at the lower end thereof is disposed in the slot 9 of the gate valve 8 such that to be adjusted therein during the operation of the tap.<br>
When the water pot is filled in with a predetermined weight of water, first platform 1 moves downwardly and rested on the second platform 4. Thus the second platform 4 starts moving downwardly and the stop valve closes the water inlet of the pipe line 12 of the tap to stop the water supply from the main water supply pipe line 13.<br><br>
Thus it is seen that upon putting a water pot onto the first platform, water supply to the water pot started automatically and upon filling the water in the water pot upto a pre—determined weight of water, the water supply to t.he water pot, is stopped automatically and thus the wastage of water is stopped at the public places.<br><br>
I CLAIM;<br>
1.	An automatic regulated water tap characterized in that a first platform (1) mounted on a small helical spring (2) rested on the base plate (3) of a second platform (4) being disposed in an outer body of the tap (5), a big helical spring (6) is provided below the base plate (3) of said second platform (4) such that the lower end of said spring being rested on the bottom base of said body (5), a first connecting rod (7) having a gate valve (8) secured at the lower end thereof being secured to the lower surface of said first platform (1) such that to allow the water supply to the outlet of the tap upon placing an empty pot onto said first platform (1), a second rod (10) having a stop valve (11) secured therewith being provided with the lower end of said gate valve (8) such that to stop the water supply from the main water pipe line (12) to the tap upon filling the water into said pot to a predetermined weight of water.<br>
2.	An automatic regulated water tap as claimed in claim 1 wherein a slot (9) is provided centrally in the said gate valve (8) so as to accommodate the upper end of the second connecting rod (10) therein.<br><br>
3. An automatic regulated water tap substantially as herein described and illustrated.</td>
