				<td>The present invention relates to a naovol fomiulation use ful ar corrosion protective coating and a process fop the preparation of corrosion protective coatings-therefrom,.<br>
These new high performance corrosion protective coatings are based on a polymeric alloy binder material of epoxy-polyamide and polyurethane polymers. These corrosion protective coatings possess improved corrosion resistance, chemical resistance, weather resistance and improved mechanical properties.<br>
Hitherto only two types of two pack systems namely epoxy-polyamide and polyurethane which have the ability to form hard films through self-catalyzing reactions at ambient conditions have been extensively used in the field of corrosion protective organic coatings for the protection of metallic parts from corrosion. Each of these systems is made up of one individual polymeric component ( base resin ) being cured by the other pre-polymer component (otherwise called crosslinking agent/curing agent/hardener) to result in a crosslinked film for providing better corrosion protection than linear polymeric films such as chlorinated rubber, vinyls, thermoplastic acrylics etc.<br>
In the present case, instead of using an individual polymeric component (such as<br>
epoxy or acrylic), a novel polymer alloy material as described and claimed in our(copending)<br>
patent application NF a-235/98which is a polymer alloy of individual polymeric components<br>
namely epoxy, urethane and acrylate, is used. This alloy material is synthesized in such a way that during synthesis the individual polymeric molecules are entangled/interlocked physically and permanently like a woven fabric to form a network. This alloy material is subsequently mixed with an appropriate curing agent in a specified proportion along with pigments and other additives and applied over mild steel substrates to get protective coatings with improved film properties over that of the individual component polymers out of which the alloy is made. The films thus obtained exhibit interpenetration of the individual polymeric molecules and possess improved film properties such as corrosion resistance, chemical resistance, weather resistance and improved mechanical properties over that of the individual component polymers out of which they are made.<br><br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a novel formulation useful as protective coating.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of high performance corrosion protective coatings using novel polymer alloys.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to prepare coatings by mixing the novel polymer alloy with an appropriate curing agent such as an isocyanate terminated urethane pre-polymer crosslinking agent along with suitably selected main pigments and extender pigments and other additives to get ambient cured films with improved corrosion resistance, chemical resistance, weather resistance, mechanical properties over that of the individual component polymers out of which it is made.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to prepare coatings by mixing the novel polymer alloy with an appropriate curing agent such as an isocyanate terminated urethane pre-polymer crosslinking agent to get ambient cured films which can be used as a two-component binder material out of which a number of coating formulations, with suitably selected main pigments and extender pigments and other additives, can be developed which may be suitable to a wide variety of aggressive corrosive environments.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a novel formulation useful as corrosion protective coating which comprises a pigment mixture containing optionally rutile grade pigment titanium dioxide, pigment red iron oxide, pigment zinc phosphate, pigment micaceous iron oxide, pigment middle chrome yellow, extender pigment talc, extender pigment mica, extender pigment silica, extender pigment whiting, extender pigment china clay, other rheological additives such as Thixotropic Agent, Anti-settling Agent, Flow Control Agents etc. commonly used in paints to improve liquid paint properties and mixture of organic solvents comprising aliphatic/aromatic hydrocarbons and ketones such as n-butyl acetate, methyl isobutyl ketone, xylene.Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of high performance corrosion protective coatings which comprises :<br>

The novelty of the present invention lies in<br>
i. Preparing the proper isocyanate terminated urethane pre-polymer crosslinking agent so as to react with the novel polymer alloy as obtained in another patent by the authors, NF 235/98 in the appropriate NCO/OH ratio so as to form hard films upon curing at ambient conditions through self-catalyzing reactions.<br>
ii. Ability of the above said two component system to achieve segmental interlocking within the polymer molecules so as to avoid the susceptibility to micro-separation of macromolecules on aging under aggressive conditions which is quite common with polymer blends systems where the blending of the polymer individual polymers is done through simple physical mixing. Proof for existence of interpenetration<br>
H.L.Frisch et al. (Pure. Appl. Chem., 53, 1557, 1981) and Edward.F. Cassidy et al., (J.Polym.Sci. Polym. Chem., 22, 1839-50, 1984) have extensively studied the glass transition behaviour and morphology of IPNs using electron microscopy. According to them, the existence of the interpenetration among the various networks in a polymer alloy can be established i. from the shift in dynamic glass transition temperatures of the IPNs incomparison to their corresponding homo-polyrners, pseudo-IPNs, linear polyblends and grafted-IPNs and ii. by using the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) where in the morphologies of the IPNs like phase mixing, phase domain sizes, sharpness etc. can be compared to their corresponding homo-polymers, pseudo-IPNs, linear polyblends and grafted-IPNs.<br>
All amorphous polymers have a glass transition temperature (Tg) depending upon the chemical nature of the polymer. Glass transition increases with increase in crosslink density. In the case of IPNs, the glass transition may be broadened or shifted depending upon the mixing of the polymer in the IPNs. In highly incompatible IPNs (which is highly phase-separated) each phase retains its individual glass transition temperatures. In the totally compatibilised IPNs where complete mixing takes place, only one transition is observed in the range between the glass transitions (Tgs) of the component polymers. Usually glass transition shifts inward from the individual components.<br>
But the observation of single glass transition temperatures (Tgs.) is an ideal condition and is seldom achieved in practice. In many cases, two distinct Tgs. as Tg1 and Tg2 ( in some cases more) which are always shifted inwardly than the Tgs of corresponding component networks have been reported confirming the existence of the interpenetration in the alloys according to the authors. In our case, table-VII shows the Tgs. of polymer alloys obtained from the DSC measurements with their component networks. It can be seen from table-VIII that the Tgs. of the alloys have shifted inwardly than the component networks confirming compatibilisation has occurred among the networks.<br>
Table-VII Tgs (in Kelvin) of IPNs &amp; their homo-polymers<br><br><br>
(Table Removed)The morphology of IPNs (molecular orientation) is related to physical properties such as modulus and glass transition temperature (Tg) and provides an insight into the latter. The morphology of IPNs is controlled by chemical compatibility (solubility parameters), interfacial tension, crosslink densities, mode and kinetics of polymerization, and component types. The IPNs synthesized to date show different morphologies with varying degrees of phase separation, which is a complicated subject both theoretically and experimentally. Phases vary in size, shape, sharpness at the interfaces, and degree of continuity. IPNs can be classified based on morphology as having large structures with domain sizes of a few microns, intermediate structures with sizes around 1000 angstrom and no resolvable domain structures at all. In general, as phase domains become smaller, the systems become more compatible. Compatible IPNs mix on a molecular level with 5.0 nm domains, and semi-compatible IPNs from 5.0-30 nm and incompatible IPNs have domain sizes of 30 nm and greater, i.e. very coarse morphology. The SEM micrographs of the developed polymer alloys show the molecular mixing with phase sizes as small as in nm range confirming the presence of interpenetration within the alloys.<br>
The formulation prepared as claimed here are not mere admixture resulting in mere aggregation of the properties of indivisual ingredients but it is a synergistic mixture resulting in different properties of indivisual ingredients.<br>

alloy binder material possess improved mechanical properties over those coatings based<br>

different ratios.<br>
5.	The high performance corrosion protective coatings formulated using novel polymer<br>
alloy binder material cure to form protective coatings at ambient conditions to provide<br>

substituted with a two coat corrosion protective coating system made up of the newly<br>
developed high performance corrosion protective coatings.<br>

developed coating material is economical when compared to the epoxy-polyamide and<br>
aliphatic	polyurethane	based	coatings.<br><br><br><br>
