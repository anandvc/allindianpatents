                                                   [See Section 10) and Rule 13)	n)<br>
"FRONT  COMPARTMENT  STRUCTURE  FOR  MOTORCYCLES  AND  THREE-WHEELED MOTORIZED VEHICLES"<br><br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan, having a place of business at 1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan,<br><br><br>
15-6-2005<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
[Detailed Description of the Invention]<br>
[Field of the Invention]<br>
The present invention relates to an improvement to a front compartment structure for motorcycles and three-wheeled motorized vehicles.<br>
[Prior Art]<br>
Motorcycles and motorized three-wheeled vehicles equipped with leg shields, at a front part of the vehicle body, for covering the legs of the rider, and a compartment at the upper rear part of the leg shield have been widely adopted. A structure for such a compartment is given in,for example, Utilit/Model Laid-open Publication No. Sho. 62-143582, "Accessory Case Assembly for a Vehicle such as a Motorcycle".<br>
In the above related technology, in FIG. 1 to FIG. 3 and FIG. 5 of this publication, an accessory case 16 is bolted to the rear of the upper part of a leg shield 8 (the numbers are cited from those listed in the publication, with the same going for the following). This<br><br><br><br>
accessory case 16 is bolt-fastened so as to be partitioned into two to the front and rear, i.e. partitioned into a rear case member 17 and a front case member 18. An opening at the back surface of the rear case member 17 is then covered by a lid 21 so as to form an accessory compartment 19.<br>
According to the aforementioned technology, an accessory case 16 can be provided at the leg shield 8 while maintaining the original overall shape of the leg shield 8. It is also easier for a rider to mount and dismount the vehicle than compared with the case where the accessory compartment 19 is provided at a lower part because the accessory case 19 is provided at the upper rear part of the leg shield 8.<br>
[Problems This Invention Sets Out To Solve]<br>
According to the aforementioned related technology, as the accessory case 16 is of a structure where partitioned rear and front cases 17 and 18 are joined together and attached to the leg shield 8, the structure is complicated, the number of parts is substantial and the number of assembly processes increases.<br>
However, even if the accessory case 16 is simply formed.integrally with the leg shield 8 in order to reduce the number of parts, forming the accessory compartment 19 while maintaining the original overall shape of the leg shield 8 puts a large load on the molds and manufacture is not straightforward. In particular, when a small opening is made in a relatively large capacity accessory compartment 19, a complicated mold is required in order to enable mold withdrawal and the load placed on the molds is further increased. The same can also be said for when an accessory case 16 formed as a single member is attached to the leg shield 8.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to (1) provide a compartment with fewer parts and a simple structure at an upper rear part of a leg shield while maintaining the original overall shape of the leg shield covering the legs of a rider and (2) to provide a leg shield and compartment where the load placed on the molds is reduced and where the structure is simple.<br>
[Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
In order to achieve the aforementioned objects,	a front compartment<br>
structure for motorcycles and three-wheeled motorized vehicles is provided with a compartment having a rider-side opening at a rear part of an upper part of a leg shield for covering the riders legs. The leg shield comprises a lower half and an upper half attached to<br><br><br>
the upper end of this lower half, a lower compartment having an opening that opens out upwards towards the rider-side is formed at the upper end of the lower half, a compartment recess for storing items is formed substantially across the entire width of the leg shield at the upper half on the rider-side, and an opening that opens out over substantially the entire surface on the rider side and opening at the lower compartment side is formed at the compartment recess. The compartment is constructed of the lower compartment, the compartment recess and a lid, as a result of covering the lower compartment opening and the compartment recess opening being covered by the lid.<br>
The lower half of the leg shield serves as the lower compartment, the upper half of the leg shield serves as the compartment recess, and the compartment is comprised of the lower compartment, the compartment recess and the lid, so that a compartment comprised of other members is not necessary.<br>
..	The leg shield is divided into a lower half serving as the lower compartment and an<br>
, ' upper half serving as the compartment recess, with the upper half being attached to the upper.end of the lower half. A compartment can therefore be provided at the rear part of the upper part of the leg shield while maintaining the original overall shape of the leg shield covering the riders' legs. Different directions of mold withdrawal can therefore be set when molding the separate lower compartment and compartment recess. Mold withdrawal when molding the compartment is therefore easy and the molds are simple.<br>
The lid is a member projecting along an edge of the compartment recess opening and an edge of the lower compartment opening on the rider side, and the depth of this projecting member is substantially the same as the depth of the compartment recess.<br>
The compartment opening is therefore large and storage is made substantially easier.<br><br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a front compartment structure for motorcycles and three wheeled motorized vehicles provided with a compartment having a rider-side opening at a rear part of an upper part of a leg shield for covering the riders legs, wherein the leg shield comprises a lower half and an upper half attached to the upper end of this lower half, a lower compartment having an opening that opens out upwards towards the rider-side is formed at the upper end of the lower half, a compartment recess for storing items is formed across the entire width of the leg shield at the upper half on rider side , and an opening that opens out over the entire surface on the rider-side and opening at the lower compartment side is formed at the compartment recess, with the compartment being constructed of the lower compartment, the compartment recess and a lid, as a result of the lower compartment opening and the compartment recess opening being covered by the lid.<br><br><br>

The compartment 48 comprises the lower compartment 63 integrally formed at the upper end of the lower half 60 on the rider side (back surface), a compartment recess 73 integrally formed at the upper half 70 on the rider side, and a lid 80 covering an opening 64 of the lower compartment 63 and an opening 74 of the compartment recess 73.<br>
The lid 80 is a projecting member that runs along the edge of the opening 64 of the lower compartment 63 and the opening 74 of the compartment recess 73 so as to project towards the rider side.<br>
The front cover 41, lower half 60, upper half 70 and lid 80 are resin molded from polypropylene resin etc.<br>
FIG. 5 is an exploded perspective view of a front cover and leg shield of the present invention.<br>
The lower compartment 63 is a member projecting from the upper end of the leg shield 42 in such a manner as to form the opening 64 opening both upwards and towards the front. Specifically, the lower compartment 63 is a compartment case lower part that goes from the upper end of the frame cover 61 and across the upper ends of the left and right lower leg shields 62 and 62 extending from the upper end of the frame cover 61 so as to span the whole of the lateral direction of the vehicle and extend in such a manner as to be<br><br><br>
bent upwards and towards the rear. The upper opening 64 of the lower compartment 63, i.e. the level of the upper end is in the vicinity of the lower end of the head pipe 12 shown in FIG. 2.<br>
The upper half 70 is a member of a shape with a lower end outline that runs along the upper end of the frame cover 61, and along the outline of the upper end of the lower leg shields 62 and 62. The upper half 70 is provided with left and right upper leg shields 71 and 71 extending upwards from the left and right lower leg shields 62 and 62 and a pair of left and right partitioning plates 72 and 72 are formed at the lateral center of the vehicle spaced at a prescribed interval in order to allow the head pipe 12 (refer to FIG. 2) to pass through.<br>
T<br>
The compartment recess 73 is a recess that forms an opening 74 that opens to the driver side and to the side of the lower compartment 63. Side plates 75 and 75 extend towards the rider from the back surface of the upper leg shields 71 and 71 and this recess is then the compartment case upper part that provides the space enclosed by the upper leg shields 71 and 71 and the side plates 75 and 75.<br><br>
FIG. 6 is a cross-section taken along line 6-6 of FIG. 3 and shows that the compartment recess 73 spans roughly the entire width of the leg shield 42 on the driver side, i.e. roughly the entire width of the upper part 70, and is of a size which makes storage of accessories possible. An opening 74 of the compartment recess 73 opens to the entire driver side surface. The size of the lower compartment 63 shown in FIG. 5 and the size of the opening 64 of the lower housing are the same as the size of the compartment recess 73 and the opening 74.<br><br>
The feature of the compartment 48 is that a depth LI of the lid 80 is substantially the same as a depth L2 of the compartment recess 73. The opening is therefore larger and storing items is made substantially easier.<br>
The compartment recess 73 is formed with a packing attachment channel 76 at the edge of the opening 74 and packing 77 is attached to the packing channel 76. The packing 77 then seals between the opening 74 and the lid 80.<br>
FIG. 7 is a cross-sectional view taken along line 7-7 of FIG. 3 showing where the opening 48 is made larger by making the depth of the lid 80 larger. The front end of the lower compartment 63 fits with the rear end of the compartment recess 73 and members 63<br><br><br><br>
and 73 are then fastened together using a screw. Sealant is applied between the front end of the lower compartment 63 and the rear end of the compartment recess 73 so as to seal therebetween.<br>
FIG. 8 is a perspective view of the essential parts of the surroundings of the opening of the compartment of the present invention showing packing 77 attached to the entire periphery of the entire periphery of the surface of the opening 74 of the compartment recess 73 coming into contact with the lid 80 (refer to FIG. 7).<br>
FIG. 9 is an exploded perspective view showing the external appearance of a structure for the leg shield and its attachment structure for the present invention.<br>
The lower half 60 of the leg shield 42 is integrally formed with a head cover 65 that extends from an upper part thereof and is C-shaped when viewed from above so that the rear part of the head pipe 12 is covered by this head cover 65.<br>
The lower half 60 can be reliably and firmly attached by (1) attaching the side walls of the head cover 65 to a gusset 34 of the head pipe 12 using bolts 91 and 91, (2) attaching side walls at the lower part of the rear of the frame cover 61 to a bracket 35 of the main pipe 31 using bolts 92 and 92, and (3) attaching side walls at a central lower part of the frame cover 61. to the cylinder block 28 of the engine 21 using bolts 93 and 93.<br>
Returning to FIG. 5, in order to attach the upper half 70 to the lower half 60, (1) the partitioning walls 72 and 72 fits with the side surfaces of the head cover 65 and are attached with screws 94 and 94, (2) the rear end of the compartment recess 73 fits with the front end of the lower compartment 63 and the upper leg shields 71 and 71 are attached to the lower leg shields 62 and 62 using screws 95 and 95 (just the left one of which is shown in FIG. 5).<br>
In order to attach the front cover 41 to the upper half 70, (1) the front cover 41 is made to cover the front part of the upper half 70, (2) the front cover 41 is fastened to both of the upper leg shields 71 and 71 using the screws 95 and 95, (3) the front cover 41 is attached to the upper part of the upper leg shields 71 and 71 using screws 96 and 96 (just the left of which is shown in FIG. 5).<br>
As a result of this fastening with screws the upper half 70 is attached to the lower half 60, the leg shield 42 is assembled and the front cover 41 is attached to the leg shield 42.<br>
Numeral 66 is an inspection lid and numerals 78 and 78 are bolt release channels.<br><br><br>
The following is a description of the operation of the compartment structure of the aforementioned configuration.<br>
(1)	As shown in FIG. 1, because the compartment 48 is provided at the upper part of the leg shield 42, it is easier for a rider to mount and dismount compared to when the compartment 48 is provided at the lower part of the leg shield 42.<br>
(2)	As shown in FIG. 2, the weight of accessories is borne directly by the lower compartment 63 of the leg shield 42 attached to the vehicle frame 11 and comparatively heavy accessories can therefore be stored.<br>
(3)	As shown in FIG. 4, a compartment recess 73 in which items can be stored is formed across roughly the entire width of the leg shield 42 and an opening 74, the entire surface of which opens out to the rider side, is formed at this compartment recess 73. The compartment 48 therefore has a large capacity and substantial open surface area and can therefore easily be used for storing large accessories such as a bag B, etc.<br>
(4)	As shown in FIG. 5, the lower half 60 of the leg shield 42 also serves as the lower compartment 63, the upper half 70 of the leg shield 42 also serves as the compartment recess 73 and the compartment 48 (refer to FIG. 4) is formed from the lower compartment 63, the compartment recess 73 and the lid 80. It is therefore not necessary to form the compartment from other members and the number of parts required to form the compartment 48 can be reduced.<br>
(5)	Further, the leg shield 42 is divided into the lower half 60 serving as the lower compartment 63 and the upper half 70 serving as the compartment recess 73, with the upper half 70 then being attached to the upper end of the lower half 60. The original overall shape of the leg shield 42 covering the legs of the rider can therefore be maintained and a compartment of a simple structure can be provided at the rear part of the upper part of the leg shield 42.<br>
(6)	When the separate lower compartment 63 and compartment recess 73 are molded, the orientation of the opening 64 and the orientation of the opening 74 can be lined up and the mold withdrawal directions can be set separately. Mold withdrawal when molding the compartment 48 (refer to FIG. 4) is therefore straightforward and the molds are simple. The load on the molds used for forming the leg shield 42 and the compartment 48 is therefore alleviated and manufacturing is straightforward.<br>
In the aforementioned embodiment of the present invention, (1) the motorcycle 10 includes scooter type motorcycles. In addition to being provided at the leg shield 42 of the<br><br>
motorcycle 10, the compartment 48 can also be provided at the leg shield of a three-wheeled motorized vehicle.<br>
(2)	The shape and dimensions of the front cover 41 are arbitrary, and the presence or absence of the front cover 41 is optional.<br>
(3)	The leg shield 42 also includes inner covers attached to the reverse side of the front cover 41, as in the case of scooter-type motorcycles. For example, the lower half 60 can be taken as the leg shield, the upper half 70 as the inner cover, the lower compartment 63 can be molded at the lower half 60 and the compartment recess 73 can be molded at the upper half 70.<br>
(4)	The presence or absence of the hinge 81 is optional, providing that the lid 80 covers the opening 64 of the lower compartment 63 and the opening 74 of the compartment recess 73.<br>
[Effects of the Invention]<br>
The present invention brings about the following results with the above configuration. The lower half of the leg shield serves as the lower compartment, the upper half of the leg shield serves as the compartment recess, and the compartment is comprised of the lower compartment, the compartment recess and the lid. A compartment comprised of other members is therefore not necessary and the number of parts required to form the compartment can be reduced. Further, the leg shield is divided into a lower half serving as the lower compartment and an upper half serving as the compartment recess, with the upper half being attached to the upper end of the lower half. A compartment simple in structure can therefore be provided at the rear part of the upper part of the leg shield while maintaining the original overall shape of the leg shield covering the riders' legs. The orientations of the respective openings can be aligned and different directions of mold withdrawal can therefore be set when molding the separate lower compartment and compartment recess. Mold withdrawal when molding the compartment is therefore easy and the molds are simple. The load placed on the molds for molding the leg shield and the compartment is therefore alleviated and manufacture is easy.<br>
A compartment recess in which items can be stored is formed across roughly the entire width of the leg shield and an opening, the entire surface of which opens out to the rider side, is formed at this compartment recess. The compartment therefore has a large capacity and substantial open surface area and can therefore easily be used for storing large accessories such as bags, etc.<br><br><br><br>
shield attached to tne vehicle frame so that relatively heavy accessories can be stored.<br>
Because the compartment is provided at the upper part of the leg shield, it is easier for the rider to mount and dismount than compared to when the compartment is provided at the lower part of the leg shield.<br><br>
