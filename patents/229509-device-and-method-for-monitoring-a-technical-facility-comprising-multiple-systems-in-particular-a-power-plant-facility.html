				<td>Description<br>
Device and method for monitoring a technical facility<br>
comprising multiple systems, in particular a power plant<br>
facility.<br>
The invention relates to a device as well as a method for<br>
monitoring a technical facility comprising multiple systems,<br>
in particular a power plant facility.<br>
Conventional devices and. methods for monitoring a technical<br>
facility comprising multiple systems, in particular diagnostic<br>
methods and diagnostic equipment, are often based on the<br>
observation and/or measurement of specific operational<br>
parameters of the technical facility, whereby exceeding or<br>
falling short of a reference value calls for a maintenance<br>
procedure.<br>
Naturally, the derivation of a necessary operational procedure<br>
by observing parameters measured in isolation is, at the same<br>
time, imprecise and prone to errors.<br>
If, on the other hand, an abundance of data that accumulates<br>
in the technical facility, in particular measurement values<br>
from various measurement positions and/or corresponding stored<br>
historical measurement values, is consulted in order to create<br>
a picture of the present or future expected operational<br>
status, then this likewise Leads to no satisfactory<br>
conclusion, because the mutual dependencies of this data from<br>
data sources which are gene rally highly diverse are mostly<br>
unknown, and therefore, likewise, no precise evaluation or<br>
even prediction of the operational situation from it is<br>
possible.<br>
In addition, it is to be expected that not all data that<br>
exerts an influence on the operational situation of the<br>
facility is included, which makes the problem even more<br>
complicated.<br>
As a result, the object of the invention is to show an<br>
improved device as well as a method for monitoring a technical<br>
facility comprising multiple systems, in particular a power<br>
plant facility. At the same time, high prediction accuracy in<br>
particular should be achievable with regard to a developing<br>
failure in the technical facility.<br>
In addition, so-called "creeping process deviations" that lead<br>
away from a desired operational situation and practically<br>
always precede the appearance of a failure and/or a process<br>
disruption should be able to be identified as early in time as<br>
possible.<br>
Furthermore, the expected point in time of the appearance of a<br>
failure should be identifiable as early in time as possible by<br>
means of a device according to the invention or a<br>
corresponding method, such nhat countermeasures (for example,<br>
a maintenance procedure) can be initiated before a failure of<br>
the facility or its components occurs.<br>
In addition, a device according to the invention as well as a<br>
corresponding method should reduce the expense of diagnostic<br>
applications in the facility that have been customary up until<br>
now, and furthermore allow a better optimization of the<br>
control devices used.<br>
The object according to the invention with regard to the<br>
device is achieved by means of a device for monitoring a<br>
technical facility comprising multiple systems, in particular<br>
a power plant facility, incLuding<br>
• at least one analysis module, which includes a dynamic model<br>
of at least one system of the technical facility, whereby<br>
operational and/or structural data for the technical<br>
facility can be supplied to the analysis module as input<br>
data, and<br>
• at least one algorithm based on artificial intelligence<br>
incorporated by the analysis module, by means of which the<br>
dynamic model of the system can be improved during the<br>
operation of the system,<br>
whereby output data is identifiable by means of the analysis<br>
module, which characterizes the present and/or future<br>
operational behavior of the system.<br>
At the same time, the invention starts from the consideration<br>
that, with conventional modeling known from the prior art, the<br>
achievable precision and thus the achievable degree of<br>
agreement with the corresponding actual measurements for the<br>
identified model measurements is too limited to come to<br>
reliable conclusions about a future behavior of the facility.<br>
At the present time, known modelings offer the most suitable<br>
results, i.e. there exists a high degree of agreement with the<br>
corresponding actual measurements at: the present time.<br>
Therefore, the further in the future that the relevant point<br>
in time for the behavior of :he facility lies, the greater the<br>
unreliability of the predict--on.<br>
An additional starting point for the: invention lies in the<br>
realization that, in many cases, it is impossible or possible<br>
only at extremely great expense to specify a fairly accurate<br>
model for the technical facility (for example, because of a<br>
strongly non-linear behavior of certain systems of the<br>
technical. facility) .<br>
With the device according to the invention, a dynamic model of<br>
at least one system of the technical facility is assumed,<br>
which is improved during operation by means of methods of<br>
artificial intelligence. The capability of the analysis module<br>
to describe and to forecast the operational behavior of the<br>
system is thereby improved.<br>
At the same time, it is not urgently necessary to start with a<br>
complex, uniform dynamic model of the system. For example, a<br>
set of a few insular, simple equations and characteristics,<br>
which can be supplemented by means of a neural network<br>
(preferably structured in a simple manner), fuzzy logic or a<br>
genetic algorithm, often suffices. The interaction between<br>
these "partial models" for a system description is then<br>
improved during operation by means of the algorithm based on<br>
artificial intelligence such that an interrelationship<br>
develops for the said elements.<br>
A model, particularly a deterministic one in the classical<br>
sense, is not necessary. On the contrary, the mentioned<br>
interrelationship is parameterized (for example, a Bernoulli<br>
equation for this relationship in order to use it on a<br>
specific existing flow), and the algorithm based on artificial<br>
intelligence searches in historical or present operational<br>
data and/or structural data of the system and/or of the<br>
technical facility for correlations, for example changes in<br>
measurements that are created as a consequence of the change<br>
in other measurements. Newly-discovered correlations of this<br>
type are then integrated into the dynamic model by means of<br>
the algorithm based on artificial intelligence - in particular<br>
as an additional characteristic and/or equation or as an<br>
adjustment of parameters oi the dynamic model, for example of<br>
the network weight factors of a neural network - and these are<br>
thereby improved.<br>
In the context of the invention, the term "system" should<br>
cover the range from a simple component - for example, a<br>
pipeline - up to a highly complex complete system, including a<br>
number of subsystems - for example a turbine set, a boiler<br>
facility, a power plant block or the complete power plant.<br>
The term "operational data" is to be understood to mean, in<br>
particular, all types of data that accrue during the operation<br>
of the technical facility such as, for example, temperature<br>
measurements, pressure measurement data, thermal images,<br>
sensor data, messages, alarms, warning, and so forth.<br>
The "algorithm based on artificial intelligence" includes, in<br>
particular, methods of artificial intelligence such as neural<br>
networks, fuzzy logic and genetic atlgorithms.<br>
The "dynamic model" can be described deterministically and<br>
numerically or also by means of methods based on artificial<br>
intelligence. Furthermore, at can include physical and<br>
mathematical equations. Combinations of the mentioned elements<br>
are also included, in particular physical and/or mathematical<br>
equations that are linked by means of methods based on<br>
artificial intelligence.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the improvement of the dynamic<br>
model includes the identification of that input data which has<br>
not yet been previously used by the dynamic model, and the<br>
dynamic model can be expanded with the help of this input<br>
data.<br>
At the same time, the algorithm based on artificial<br>
intelligence is used for the improvement of the dynamic model<br>
for the identification and establishment of correlations not<br>
yet considered in the dynamic model.<br>
The dynamic model preferably includes one or more elements<br>
from the group {characteristic, physical equation, neural<br>
network, fuzzy logic, genetic algorithm}.<br>
The dynamic model particularly includes at least one neural<br>
network, which can be trained with historical operational data<br>
from the system.<br>
The modeling of technical components and facilities by means<br>
of neural networks is a known and proven procedure. A<br>
particular advantage to be seen therein is that an analytical<br>
description of the components to be modeled heed not be known.<br>
The structure of the neural network first initialized by means<br>
of initial parameters ("initial weighting factors") and<br>
determined in advance througn the training phase (which, for<br>
example, includes a known backpropagation algorithm) is<br>
designed with respect to its weighting factors such that a<br>
good correlation with the actual component can be expected<br>
after the conclusion of the training phase. In this manner one<br>
obtains a model of the component without being required to<br>
undertake a precise analytical analysis. In the training<br>
phase, the neural network learns to respond to specific input<br>
values with specific output values; together with their<br>
corresponding output values, input values of this type are<br>
often designated as a training set. In operation, the neural<br>
network then interpolates for input values that are not<br>
included in the training set, such that output values are also<br>
calculated for input values of this type.<br>
During operation of the technical facility, the problem often<br>
appears that not all operational data that exerts an influence<br>
on the behavior of the component(s) to be modeled (or the<br>
entire technical facility as well) are known or ascertainable.<br>
Furthermore, the use of at Least one algorithm based on<br>
artificial intelligence makes it possible, by means of the<br>
dynamic model, to incorporate into the calculations of the<br>
status of the system of the technical facility those<br>
parameters that do not act directly on this system of the<br>
technical facility, for example as input and/or output signals<br>
or media flows. For example, for a serially ordered chain of<br>
systems, the modeling of a system located in the middle of<br>
this chain is provided, which - alongside input signals where<br>
appropriate acting directly upon this system - derive input<br>
signals from the preceding system that are not measurable or<br>
available in other ways.<br>
At the same time, the methods of artificial intelligence<br>
(which can be designed according to biological evolution, for<br>
example, as genetic search algorithms based on a suitable<br>
characteristic combination) a Lso them allow a calculation of<br>
the status of a system of the technical facility if the input<br>
parameters for the determination of the current status are<br>
largely unknown or identifiable only with difficulty, for<br>
example - as mentioned before - by means of a complex<br>
measurement of the output values of the preceding system.<br>
For example, statistical methods can also be used at the same<br>
time in connection with the algorithm based on artificial<br>
intelligence, whereby the most probable input and/or output<br>
values for a system that are not otherwise accessible are used<br>
.in a current operational situation in which the algorithm<br>
based on artificial intelligence determines these input and/or<br>
output values of the respective system which are required by<br>
the dynamic model, for example, through an evolutionary search<br>
strategy.<br>
In this manner, a good correlation for the model of at least<br>
one system can be expected with the actual behavior of this<br>
system, because also included in the modeling of the system by<br>
means of at least one algorithm based on artificial<br>
intelligence is that operating data that would otherwise be<br>
ignored and would lead to a more or less high level of<br>
imprecision for the model and, for this reason especially, the<br>
predictions created with it.<br>
Input and/or output data for the system that determines its<br>
operational status, but is not accessible, for example, by<br>
means of measurement, is also included for this reason in<br>
particular. Thus, the precision of the prediction is<br>
increased.<br>
A particularly preferred embodiment of the invention consists<br>
of a number of analysis modules, which each include a dynamic<br>
model of at least one system of the technical facility.<br>
Furthermore, at least one additional algorithm based on<br>
artificial intelligence is provided at the same time, by means<br>
of which correlations at least between the input and/or output<br>
data of a first of the analysis modules and the input and/or<br>
output data of a second of the analysis modules is<br>
identifiable.<br>
This embodiment of the invention relates to the expansion of<br>
the device according to the Invention to parallel monitoring<br>
of interacting systems, whereby the interaction in the form of<br>
a relationship between the respective input and/or output data<br>
of the analysis modules is determined from additional<br>
algorithms based on artificial intelligence and is established<br>
as additional correlations (for example, in the form of an<br>
equation, a neural network or a characteristic).<br>
Thus develops a precise dynamic model of the interactive<br>
systems comprising the dynamic model of the individual systems<br>
as well as the additional correlations.<br>
Thus, the current and/or future operational behavior of the<br>
individual systems as well as the operational behavior of the<br>
facility resulting from the interaction of the systems can be<br>
described.<br>
Advantageously identifiable at the same time by means of the<br>
correlations is additional cutput data that characterizes the<br>
current and/or future operational behavior of the technical<br>
facility, whereby this additional output data includes cross-<br>
system information.<br>
Correlations between the said data indicate mutual<br>
dependencies, by which the additional output data thus<br>
extracted goes beyond the system limits of the individual<br>
systems concerned in its informative value, and thus describes<br>
the behavior of a larger unit of the technical facility<br>
consisting of at least two systems.<br>
Preferably, the operational and/or structural data of the<br>
technical facility includes cne or more items of information<br>
from the group {process data, operational messages, warning<br>
messages, disruption messages, monitoring notifications,<br>
comments, design of the technical facility, hierarchy of the<br>
facility components}.<br>
At the same time, the process data can be acquired online and<br>
offline from a control system of the technical facility and/or<br>
a subsystem associated with it, or also manually entered.<br>
The operational messages particularly include sensor data and<br>
information derived therefrom about the operational status of<br>
the technical facility and its systems.<br>
The structural data particularly includes information about<br>
the design of the technical facility with regard to the<br>
systems comprising the technical facility (facility<br>
components, subsystems, system groups) as well as their<br>
hierarchical interaction and prioritization.<br>
At the same time, this data can include current and/or<br>
historical data, which, for example, is recorded in a short-<br>
or long-term archive or in an engineering system.<br>
The operational and/or structural data is preferably supplied<br>
by a process control system.<br>
For operating and monitoring complex technical facilities, a<br>
process control system in which the mentioned data is<br>
available or accrues during operation and is stored is<br>
typically used. In this embodiment, the data provision is<br>
therefore of especially low complexity.<br>
Furthermore, the invention leads to a method for monitoring a<br>
technical facility comprising multiple systems, particularly a<br>
power plant facility, including the following steps:<br>
• Operational and/or structural data from the technical<br>
facility is provided as input data to a dynamic model of at<br>
least one system of the technical facility,<br>
• the dynamic model of the system is improved during the<br>
operation of the system by means of an algorithm based on<br>
artificial intelligence, and<br>
• output data that characterizes the current and/or future<br>
operational behavior of the system is determined by means oi<br>
the dynamic model.<br>
The improvement of the dynamic model preferably includes the<br>
identification of that input data that has not yet been<br>
previously used by the dynamic model, and the dynamic model<br>
can be expanded with the help of this input data.<br>
In a further embodiment, a number of dynamic models are<br>
provided that in each case describe at least one system of the<br>
technical facility and at least one additional algorithm based<br>
on artificial intelligence, by means of which correlations at<br>
least between the input and/or output data of a first of the<br>
dynamic models and the input and/or output data of a second of<br>
the dynamic models are identifiable.<br>
Advantageously identifiable by means of the correlations is<br>
additional output data that characterizes the current and/or<br>
future operational behavior of the technical facility, whereby<br>
this additional output data includes cross-system information.<br>
The explanations provided in connection with the device<br>
according to the invention and its advantageous embodiments<br>
are transferable to the method according to the invention and<br>
are therefore not repeated here.<br>
In summary, the invention can be incorporated into the<br>
following environment:<br>
Artificial intelligence fcr the diagnosis of systems of a<br>
technical facility, for example a power plant facility, can be<br>
used to predict foreseeable failures, whereby all data<br>
available in the technical facility can be consulted.<br>
At the same time, the main points of emphasis lie, for<br>
example, in genetic algorithms and neural networks for<br>
modeling and accomplishing the monitoring tasks, particularly<br>
diagnosis tasks.<br>
It is of particular interest to decidedly reduce the expense<br>
of diagnosis applications in the technical facility, and<br>
furthermore to make possible an improved optimization of the<br>
controls.<br>
An improvement is achieved of, on the one hand, the relevant<br>
aggregate characteristics of systems of the technical<br>
facility, for example, power and energy consumption, are<br>
reduced with regard to legal regulations and resource<br>
scarcity.<br>
On the other hand, customer wishes for improved performance<br>
and diagnosis facilities are fulfilled.<br>
Both large systems and small systems can be integrated into<br>
the diagnosis by means of genetic/evolutionary algorithms.<br>
It is possible to facilitate conclusions about the status of<br>
at least one system of the technical facility by associating<br>
genetic (evolutionary) algorithms with Kohonen networks and/or<br>
neural networks of any type.<br>
The use of genetic algorithms therefore also makes it possible<br>
to include in the determination of the status of a system of<br>
the technical facility those parameters that do not directly<br>
affect this component of the technical facility, for example<br>
as input and/or output signals or media flows.<br>
The methodologies of genetic algorithms (search algorithms)<br>
therefore also then allow a calculation of the status of at<br>
least one system or of the entire technical facility if the<br>
input parameters for the determination of the current status<br>
are largely unknown and/or not identifiable or identifiable<br>
only with difficulty, for example, by means of an expensive<br>
measurement.<br>
Furthermore, the use of artificial intelligence for the<br>
diagnosis makes it possible for deviations from calculated<br>
current statuses to be reported to the operator of the<br>
technical facility in the case of complex facility statuses.<br>
A specific failure notice, for example about the narrowly<br>
isolated failure location, can be initially dispensed with in<br>
this case, because failures, for example of sensors, are<br>
usually measured and reported in any event by an existing<br>
control system.<br>
What is instead important in connection with the invention is<br>
the identification of creeping processes - that do not<br>
necessarily cause immediate failure of a facility component -<br>
such as contamination, loss of power through wear, ageing and<br>
so forth, which are incorrectly perceived or incorrectly<br>
interpreted by people because; of the "habituation effect".<br>
In many cases, creeping changes of this type sometimes lead to<br>
the failure of the technical facility. The changes are,<br>
however, often not identified because an existing control<br>
device, for example, attempts to counter this change.<br>
Contamination on the blades of a fan is compensated for by re-<br>
adjusting the fan blades, for example. Or the control device<br>
compensates for decreased outputs in oil pumps or coolant<br>
pumps through new reference value specifications; then the<br>
temperature of a bearing, for example, becomes higher only<br>
very slowly, because the control device can often delay the<br>
moment of system failure in the case of an impending failure.<br>
At the same time, however, ever more is demanded of the<br>
controlled systems, and the wear increases. The user of the<br>
technical facility notices nothing as a result, because,<br>
according to the control device, the technical facility<br>
continues to function even though one or more systems of the<br>
technical facility get closer to their wear limit.<br>
A risky operation exists in particular if a functioning system<br>
is operated under increased stress; such stress can be<br>
generated through a control device mentioned previously by<br>
means of a reference value specification.<br>
For example, a coolant loop is constructed for continuous<br>
operation at 50% output. Permanent operation at 70-80% output<br>
can then soon lead to serious damages. An impending failure of<br>
a coolant pump stricken with a leak remains unnoticed,<br>
however, because the control device increases the reference<br>
value (i.e. the pressure) for the coolant pump more and more<br>
to maintain the function of the coolant loop, which<br>
accelerates the failure of the pump further. Not until the<br>
failure actually occurs is the failure of the coolant pump<br>
noticed as the source of the failure of the cooling system. A<br>
device according to the invention as well as a method can<br>
provide a remedy here.<br>
Furthermore, genetic algorithms in conjunction with<br>
intelligent, adaptive networks allow the identification of<br>
risky operating modes of the technical facility, capacity<br>
overload or incorrect capacity utilization of units and<br>
systems, and so forth. This is advantageously reported to the<br>
operator/user of the technical facility, for example in the<br>
form of an operational diagram (i.e. a characteristic<br>
diagram) , from which results the current operation as well as<br>
a proposed improved operation.<br>
The presentation of deviations can occur advantageously by<br>
means of characteristic diagrams. In addition to the failure<br>
prediction, an optimization of the operation of the operation<br>
of the technical facility is also possible based on genetic<br>
algorithms.<br>
Furthermore, information can be extracted by means of genetic<br>
algorithms for the management personnel of the technical<br>
facility, which makes possibLe a conclusion about the overall<br>
status of the facility and if appropriate about maintenance<br>
procedures necessary within a time interval.<br>
The use of artificial intelligence advantageously makes<br>
possible an online calculation of system statuses, i.e. the<br>
operator can be notified of a. "failure behavior" in his<br>
facility and is then able to make anticipatory calculations<br>
that make a new approach possible for him.<br>
Example:<br>
A device according to the invention, for example in the form<br>
of a diagnostic system, reports "Failure in coal pulverizer XX<br>
grinding rollers zone" to the operator; it is determined<br>
through counterchecks that a maintenance procedure for the<br>
coal pulverizer is necessary (for example, because this is<br>
prescribed by the manufacturer in the related maintenance<br>
manual) .<br>
By means of anticipatory calculation, it can be determined by<br>
means of the diagnostic system according to the invention what<br>
would occur if the operator nevertheless leaves his technical<br>
facility in operation without maintenance procedures and when<br>
the actual appearance of an operational failure of the coal<br>
pulverizer is to be expected.<br>
With the combination of genetic algorithms and neural networks<br>
as well as optional Kohonen networks, a multitude of<br>
conclusions can be reached with respect to the current and/or<br>
future status of the technical facility, in particular when a<br>
maintenance procedure will oe necessary.<br>
In the following two exemplary embodiments of the invention<br>
are described in more detail.. They show:<br>
FIG 1 a system hierarchy, as customarily occurs in technical<br>
facilities,<br>
FIG 2 a device according to the invention, and<br>
FIG 3 a further embodiment c f a device according to the<br>
invention with two analysis modules.<br>
FIG 1 shows by way of example a hierarchical system design of<br>
a technical facility 2.<br>
The technical facility 2 is designed as a power plant facility<br>
for the generation of electrical energy and includes two power<br>
plant blocks 3.<br>
Each power plant block 3 includes two turbines 5, for example<br>
gas turbines. These turbines 5 in turn each contain a coolant<br>
loop 9.<br>
This coolant loop 9 includes a turbine blade 11 of the turbine<br>
5.<br>
Each of the mentioned elements should fall under the term<br>
system in connection with the invention. A system can<br>
therefore include a simple, isolated component such as, for<br>
example a turbine blade, as well as a complex system, such as<br>
the power plant block 3 or multiple power plant blocks 3.<br>
FIG 2 shows a device 1 according to the invention with an<br>
analysis module 13.<br>
At the same time, operational data 17 and structural data 19<br>
from the technical facility is conveyed to the analysis module<br>
13 as input data.<br>
The operational data 17 can for example involve online<br>
measurement data which is recorded in the technical facility<br>
in the system itself by means of sensors. At the same time, it<br>
can also involve data derived from this measurement data,<br>
which is produced in a computer system, for example.<br>
Furthermore, the operationa] data 17 can also include offline<br>
measurement data, which is stored in an archive or manually<br>
entered, for example.<br>
The structural data 19 describes the technical facility or the<br>
system itself. In particular, it includes information about<br>
the interconnection of subsystems that are included in the<br>
system and their hierarchical arrangement.<br>
A dynamic model 15 is proviced for modeling the system<br>
behavior. This model 15 can include analytic equations, for<br>
example, as well as methods of artificial intelligence such<br>
as, for example, neural networks, fuzzy logic or genetic<br>
algorithms. Furthermore, simple characteristics can in<br>
particular be provided for the description of the system<br>
behavior.<br>
An algorithm 21 based on artificial intelligence is provided<br>
for the improvement of the dynamic model 15 during the<br>
operation of the system 15.<br>
This algorithm 21 based on artificial intelligence can be<br>
designed as a genetic algorithm, for example.<br>
An important role for this algorithm 21 consists in effecting<br>
dynamic adjustments in the model 15 in order to achieve an<br>
improvement of this model 15 in the sense that an improved<br>
model behavior and thus a better correlation with the behavior<br>
of the actual system is achieved. For example, a modeling<br>
error can be called upon for the evaluation of this<br>
circumstance, for example, the difference between the actual<br>
chronological behavior of the system and the modeled<br>
chronological behavior of this system. An improvement of the<br>
model 15 can then take place by means of the algorithm 21<br>
based on artificial intelligence. At the same time, the<br>
algorithm 21 based on artificial intelligence is particularly<br>
used to identify parameters and data not yet considered during<br>
modeling which are included in the operational data 10 and/or<br>
the structural data 19 but have not yet been called upon for<br>
modeling, and to establish further correlations, for example<br>
equations or characteristics, including the mentioned<br>
identified parameters and/or data, and to add them to the<br>
dynamic model 15.<br>
An algorithm 21 based on artificial intelligence designed as a<br>
genetic algorithm optimizes correlations included in the<br>
dynamic model 15 such as, for example, equations,<br>
characteristics or network parameters of a neural network, in<br>
that it combines and re-conbines evolutionary parameters and<br>
data and, at the same time, discovers new correlations in<br>
particular, which are not yet included in the dynamic model<br>
15.<br>
In this respect, the described modeling used in connection<br>
with the invention and its improvement by means of the<br>
algorithm 21 based on artificial intelligence goes beyond<br>
known methods of, for exampLe, supervised learning and<br>
classical modeling.<br>
The analysis model 13 produces conclusions about the<br>
operational behavior of the system as output data 23. At the<br>
same time, for example, it can involve current or future<br>
operational behavior of the system (creation of a prediction).<br>
For example, operational data 17 is conveyed to the analysis<br>
module 13, and it is assumed that this operational data will<br>
persist over a particular future time period. The output data<br>
23 then allows a conclusion, for example, as to whether and,<br>
as the case may be, when a disruption of the system's<br>
operation is to be expected. The more precisely the model 15<br>
reflects the actual system behavior, the more precise is this<br>
conclusion. A high level of precision for the model 15 is<br>
provided by device 1 according to the invention, in particular<br>
by means of the algorithm 21 based on artificial intelligence,<br>
such that the predictions and diagnoses determined as output<br>
data 23 by the analysis module 13 are very precise.<br>
The output data 23 includes, in particular, qualified reports<br>
with regard to failure identification (trend analysis, wear<br>
and ageing), efficiency, process quality and expected future<br>
behavior of the system and the technical facility.<br>
In order to produce reports of this type, a set of rules can<br>
be included in analysis module 13 in order to transform output<br>
data generated from the model 15 into the mentioned reports.<br>
At the same time, the set of rules can include rules for the<br>
prediction of a short-tern observation period in particular as<br>
well as rules for a long-term observation period.<br>
At the same time, in addition to the output data from the<br>
model 15, additional information can be conveyed to the set of<br>
rules, for example reports and alarms related to the system or<br>
the technical facility.<br>
In the illustration for FIG 3, a device 1 according to the<br>
invention includes two analysis modules 13a and 13b.<br>
At the same time, operational data 17a and structural data 19a<br>
from a coolant system 29 is conveyed to the analysis module<br>
13a; the analysis module 13b receives operational data 17b and<br>
structural data 19b from a generator 31 as input data.<br>
In addition, environmental data 33 for the technical facility<br>
is conveyed to both analysis modules 13a, 13b, for example the<br>
ambient temperature, atmospheric humidity, atmospheric<br>
pressure and so forth.<br>
Each analysis module 13a, 13b detects output data 23a or 2 3b,<br>
which characterizes the operational behavior of the respective<br>
analyzed system 29 or 31.<br>
Because the coolant system 29 and the generator 31 are to be<br>
considered systems not procedurally isolated from one another,<br>
it is to be anticipated that changing operational data 17a<br>
from the coolant system 29 in particular influences the system<br>
behavior of the generator 31, and thus the output data 23b<br>
from the analysis module 13b. The same applies for changing<br>
operational data 17b from the generator 31, from which it can<br>
be expected that the operational behavior of the coolant<br>
system 2 9 and thus the output data 23a from the analysis<br>
module 13a changes as a result.<br>
In order to detect and quantify correlations of this type, the<br>
additional algorithm 25 based on artificial intelligence is<br>
provided.<br>
This can be designed, for example, as an additional genetic<br>
algorithm that produces additional output data 27, which<br>
includes cross-system information, and thus goes beyond the<br>
characterization of the behavior of one of the systems, and in<br>
particular contains information about the interaction of the<br>
systems 29 and 31 and their mutual dependencies.<br>
At the same time, the additional algorithm 25 based on<br>
artificial intelligence is therefore responsible for<br>
identifying and establishing higher-level cross-system<br>
correlations. These correlations can include, for example,<br>
equations, characteristics or neural networks, which are<br>
produced and/or parameterized by the additional algorithm 25<br>
based on artificial intelligence.<br>
At the same time, the strategy for the identification and<br>
establishment of cross-system correlations of this type can be<br>
similar to the identification and establishment of additional<br>
internal system correlations mentioned in connection with FIG<br>
2 by means of the algorithms 21a, 21b based on artificial<br>
intelligence.<br>
By using a device according to the invention and a method<br>
according to the invention, it should be possible, in<br>
particular, to create conclusions about the system behavior,<br>
in particular about that ir. the future, from a system's<br>
existing operational and structural data without complex<br>
diagnostic instruments.<br>
A self-adaptive dynamic model of the system is provided for<br>
this purpose, which is improved during operation by an<br>
algorithm based on artificial intelligence.<br>
The algorithm 21 based on artificial intelligence is used in<br>
particular for searching for correlations in a technical<br>
facility's operational and/or structural data that is<br>
typically available and processed in a control system, for<br>
example, and for integrating into the dynamic model the<br>
correlations identified in doing so in order to improve the<br>
said model incrementally.<br>
It is therefore not necessary that an analytical model of the<br>
system or of the technical .facility exists. Instead, the model<br>
based on, for example, a very simple characteristic from a<br>
characteristic array and/or on simple equations, is improved<br>
incrementally by means of a correlation analysis of the<br>
operational and structural data by means of the algorithm<br>
based on artificial intelligence by establishing the<br>
correlations determined in coing so, for example, in the form<br>
of additional characteristics, equations, and so forth.<br>
In contrast to conventional monitoring and diagnostic devices,<br>
the present is preferably based on a data-based method,<br>
whereby dependencies between parts of existing operational<br>
data and/or between parts of structural data from a technical<br>
facility are detected using methods of artificial intelligence<br>
and established as quantified correlations, for example<br>
equations and/or characteristics, such that a precise dynamic<br>
model of at least one system of the technical facility is<br>
produced.<br>
