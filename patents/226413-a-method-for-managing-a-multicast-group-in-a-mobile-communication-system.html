				<td>A METHOD FOR MANAGING A MULTICAST GROUP IN A<br>
MOBILE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a multicast service of a 3GPP universal<br>
mobile telecommunications system (UMTS) system and, more particularly, to a<br>
method for managing a multicast group according to movement of a terminal.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
A universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS) is a third<br>
generation mobile communication system that has evolved from a standard<br>
known as Global System for Mobile communications (GSM). This standard is a<br>
European standard which aims to provide an improved mobile communication<br>
service based on a GSM core network and wideband code division multiple<br>
access (W-CDMA) technology.<br>
In December, 1998, the ETSI of Europe, the ARIB/TTC of Japan, the T1<br>
of the United States,' and the TTA of Korea formed a Third Generation<br>
Partnership Project (3GPP) for the purpose of creating the specification for<br>
standardizing the UMTS.<br>
The work toward standardizing the UMTS performed by the 3GPP has<br>
resulted in the formation of five technical specification groups (TSG), each of<br>
which is directed to forming network elements having independent operations.<br>
More specifically, each TSG develops, approves and manages a<br><br>
standard specification in a related region. Among them, a radio access network<br>
(RAN) group (TSG-RAN) develops a specification for the function, items desired,<br>
and interface of a UMTS terrestrial radio access network (UTRAN), which is a<br>
new RAN for supporting a W-CDMA access technology in the UMTS.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates an example of the construction of a general UMTS<br>
network.<br>
The UMTS is roughly divided into a terminal, a UTRAN and a core<br>
network.<br>
The UTRAN includes one or more radio network sub-systems (RNS).<br>
Each RNS includes an RNC and one or more Node Bs managed by the RNCs.<br>
Node Bs are managed by the RNCs, receive information sent by the<br>
physical layer of a terminal (e.g., mobile station, user equipment and/or<br>
subscriber unit) through an uplink, and transmit data to a terminal through a<br>
downlink. Node Bs, thus, operate as access points of the UTRAN for terminal.<br>
The RNCs perform functions which include assigning and managing<br>
radio resources, and operate as an access point with respect to the core<br>
network.<br>
The UTRAN constructs and maintains a radio access bearer (RAB) for<br>
communication between the terminal and the core network. The core network<br>
requests end-to-end quality of service (QoS) requirements from the RAB, and<br>
the RAM supports the QoS requirements the core network has set. Accordingly,<br>
by constructing and maintaining the RAB, the UTRAN can satisfy the end-to-<br>
end QoS requirements.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
3<br>
The services provided to the specific terminal is roughly divided into a<br>
circuit switched service and a packet switched service. For example, a general<br>
voice phone call service belongs to the circuit switched service, while a Web<br>
browsing service through an Internet connection is classified as the packet<br>
switched service.<br>
In case of supporting the circuit switched service, the RNC is connected<br>
to the MSC of the core network, and the MSC is connected to a GMSC<br>
(Gateway Mobile Switching Center) managing a connection to other networks.<br>
Meanwhile, in case of the packet switched service, services are<br>
provided by a SGSN (Serving GPRS Support Node) and a GGSN (Gateway<br>
GPRS Support Node) 37 of the core network.<br>
The SGSN supports a packet communication going toward the RNC,<br>
and the GGSN 37 manages connection to other packet switched networks (i.e,<br>
the Internet network).<br>
As the 3GPP system has decided to provide a multimedia broadcast<br>
multicast service (MBMS), a fresh service of Release 6, 3GPP TSG SA (Service<br>
and System Aspect defines network elements required for the MBMS service<br>
and functions of each network element.<br>
A cell broadcast service the conventional Release 99 has provided is<br>
limited to a service that a text type short message is broadcast to a certain area.<br>
Comparatively, the MBMS service provided by the Release 6 is an advanced<br>
service that not only broadcasts a multimedia but also multicasts the multimedia<br>
to terminals (UEs) which have subscribed for the corresponding service.<br><br>
The MBMS will now be described in detail.<br>
The MBMS, a downward-dedicated service, provides a streaming or<br>
background service to plural terminals by using a common or dedicated<br>
downward channel. The MBMS is divided into a broadcast mode and a<br>
multicast mode. The MBMS broadcast mode is a service transmitting<br>
multimedia data to every user located in a broadcast area, whereas the MBMS<br>
multicast mode is a service transmitting multimedia data to a specific user group<br>
located in a multicast area. The broadcast area signifies a broadcast service<br>
available area, and the multicast area signifies a multicast service available<br>
area.<br>
Users who desire to receive the MBMS service should receive a service<br>
announcement and a service notification provided by a network. The service<br>
announcement means informing the terminal of a list of services to be provided<br>
and its related information, and the service notification means informing the<br>
terminal of information on broadcast data to be transmitted.<br>
Especially, if the user intends to receive the multicast mode MBMS<br>
service, he/she should be admitted to a multicast subscription group. The<br>
multicast subscription group means a group of users who has finished an<br>
admission procedure. Once the user is admitted to the multicast subscription<br>
group, he/she can join a multicast group to receive a specific multicast service.<br>
In this case, the multicast group signifies a user group receiving the specific<br>
multicast service, and 'joining' means joining the multicast group gathered to<br>
receive the specific multicast service.<br><br>
The joining behavior is in other way called a MBMS multicast activation.<br>
Accordingly, the user can receive the specific multicast data through the MBMS<br>
multicast activation or the joining behavior.<br>
Figure 2 shows a schematic network structure for providing the MBMS<br>
service.<br>
As shown in Figure 2, a broadcast multicast-service center (BM-SC)<br>
serves to schedule MBMS contents inputted from a contents provider. A cell<br>
broadcast center (CBC) is an entity (a physical or virtual unit handling a specific<br>
service) for providing an existing CBC service, that is, for broadcasting a text<br>
type short message to a certain area, and can be used for a service<br>
announcement of the MBMS service.<br>
Meanwhile, in the case of the packet switched service, the MBMS<br>
service is provided by an SGSN (Serving GPRS Support Node) and a GGSN<br>
(Gateway GPRS Support Node) of the core network. The SGSN supports a<br>
packet communication toward a serving RNC (SRNC) of the UTRAN, and the<br>
GGSN manages connection to other packet switched networks such as the<br>
Internet through a border gateway (BG).<br>
In the UMTS system, a GTP (GPRS Tunneling Protocol) layer is used to<br>
support transmission of the packet data. Specifically, the GTP layer is especially<br>
used for transmitting data of a service area. Thus, the GGSN manages a data<br>
transmission tunnel through the GTP layer in the existing UMTS packet domain,<br>
and generates and manages an MBMS context for the MBMS service.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates a transmission procedure of an MBMS data.<br><br>
As shown in Figure 3, data to be transmitted to members of the<br>
multicast group is delivered from an MBMS data source to the GGSN through<br>
an IP multicast, and the GGSN generates a GTP tunnel and transmits an<br>
MBMS data to the SGSNs which manage users subscribed for the<br>
corresponding multicast service. Each SGSN routes the MBMS data to each<br>
RNC managing corresponding users, and the RNC transmits the received<br>
MBMS data to a corresponding user cell (the area managed by one Node B).<br>
Accordingly, the specific MBMS service user located in the cell, that is,<br>
the specific terminals located in the corresponding multicast area, can be<br>
provided with the MBMS service upon receiving the MBMS data.<br>
If the BM-SC includes the function of the GGSN, the MBMS data can be<br>
directly delivered to the SGSN without passing through the GGSN, and the data<br>
would be transmitted to the other entities in the same manner.<br>
As mentioned above, the MBMS service is divided into the broadcast<br>
mode service and the multicast mode service. Unlike the broadcast mode<br>
service which broadcasts to all the area, the multicast mode service transmits<br>
data only to the users (terminals) admitted to the multicast group, of which the<br>
data is provided in a uni-directional point-to-multipoint transport method.<br>
When the multicast service is provided, information on which multicast<br>
group a user terminal currently belongs to is necessary. In addition, unlike a<br>
cable network, the user terminal is moved in the radio network, so that<br>
management of the multicast group according to the mobility of the terminal is<br>
requisite. If a user terminal moves while being provided with the MBMS service,<br><br>
the mobility information of the corresponding terminal should be sent to a<br>
multicast group managing entity.<br>
However, currently, the 3GPP defines only the requirements for the<br>
MBMS service, and no substantial matters have been discussed as to what<br>
information should be delivered between elements of the network nor as to on<br>
the basis of what information which element of the network should manage the<br>
multicast group, and in addition, as to whether the mobility information of the<br>
terminal should be unconditionally delivered to the entity managing the multicast<br>
group if the terminal is moved while being provided with the multicast service.<br>
Therefore, if the terminal being currently provided with the multicast<br>
service is moved, there is a possibility that the service provided to the terminal<br>
is interrupted, in addition, if the mobility information of the all the terminals is<br>
unconditionally delivered to the entity managing the multicast group, the<br>
network resource is not effectively used due to the unnecessary signaling.<br>
The above references are incorporated by reference herein where<br>
appropriate for appropriate teachings of additional or alternative details,<br>
features and/or technical background.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a method for<br>
managing a multicast group of a mobile communication system in which an<br>
RNC can selectively notify a core network of movement of a terminal.<br><br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for<br>
managing a multicast group of a mobile communication system in which an<br>
RNC can manage multicast group member information of by multicast services<br>
on multicast areas.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a method for<br>
managing a multicast group of a mobile communication system that is capable<br>
of preventing unnecessary transmission of a signaling to an RNC by judging<br>
whether a terminal moved in a multicast area can be supported with respect to<br>
the service of the multicast area.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a method for<br>
managing a multicast group of a mobile communication system that is capable<br>
of successively providing a multicast service to a moved terminal.<br>
To achieve at least the above objects in whole or in parts, there is<br>
provided a method for managing a multicast group of a system providing a<br>
multimedia broadcast/multicast service (MBMS), including: sensing movement<br>
of a terminal between multicast areas; and selectively notifying an entity<br>
managing a multicast group of the movement of the terminal by a network<br>
controller (RNC).<br>
Preferably, the multicast group member information is each multicast<br>
service information on a multicast area (MA) managed by one RNC. In this case,<br>
the entity managing the multicast group can be one of broadcast multicast-<br>
service center (BM-SC), a serving GPRS support node (SGSN) and gateway<br>
GPRS (GGSN).<br><br>
The method for managing a multicast group further includes: notifying<br>
movement of a terminal and updating multicast group member information by<br>
the RNC.<br>
Preferably, the RNC determines whether to notify movement of a<br>
terminal by comparing movement information of the terminal and multicast<br>
group member information.<br>
Preferably, if the terminal is moved to a different multicast area (MA)<br>
and the corresponding MA is managed by a different RNC, the RNC notifies a<br>
group managing entity of the movement of the terminal. In this case, the<br>
multicast area (MA) may provide the same or a different service as that of or<br>
from the previous multicast area.<br>
Preferably, if the terminal moves to a different multicast area (MA) and<br>
the corresponding MA is managed by the same RNC, the RNC notifies the<br>
group managing entity of the movement of the terminal. In this case, the<br>
multicast area (MA) may provide the same service as that of the previous<br>
multicast area or a different service from that of the previous multicast area.<br>
Preferably, if users for a certain service exceeds a predetermined<br>
number in the multicast area, the RNC notifies the multicast group managing<br>
entity of the movement of the terminal. In addition, even though users for a<br>
certain service in the multicast area does not exceed a predetermined number,<br>
if a QoS or a content of information is different between the multicast areas, the<br>
RNC notifies the multicast group managing entity of the movement of the<br>
terminal.<br><br>
To achieve at least these advantages in whole or in parts, there is<br>
further provided a method for managing a multicast group of a multimedia<br>
broadcast/multicast service (MBMS) system in a mobile communication system,<br>
including: managing multicast group member information on multicast areas by<br>
multicast services by an RNC; sensing movement of a terminal between<br>
multicast areas; notifying a multicast core network of movement of the terminal<br>
by the RNC when multicast group member information is changed according to<br>
the movement of the terminal between the multicast areas.<br>
Preferably, the RNC notifies a multicast group managing entity of the<br>
core network of the movement of the terminal. In such a case, the multicast<br>
group managing entity can be one of a broadcast multicast-service center (BM-<br>
SC), a serving GPRS support nod e(SGSN) and a gateway GPRS (GGSN).<br>
The method for managing a multicast group of a mobile communication<br>
system of the present invention further includes: updating multicast group<br>
member information by the RNC when the terminal moves.<br>
Preferably, if the terminal is moved to a different multicast area (MA)<br>
and the corresponding MA is managed by a different RNC, the RNC notifies a<br>
group managing entity of the movement of the terminal. In this case, the<br>
multicast area (MA) may provide the same or a different service as that of or<br>
from the previous multicast area.<br>
Preferably, if the terminal moves to a different multicast area (MA) and<br>
the corresponding MA is managed by the same RNC, the RNC notifies the<br>
group managing entity of the movement of the terminal. In this case, the<br><br>
multicast area (MA) may provide the same or a different service as that of or<br>
from the previous multicast area.<br>
Additional advantages, objects, and features of the invention will be set<br>
forth in part in the description which follows and in part will become apparent to<br>
those having ordinary skill in the art upon examination of the following or may<br>
be learned from practice of the invention. The objects and advantages of the<br>
invention may be realized and attained as particularly pointed out in the<br>
appended claims.<br>

MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention is implemented in a mobile communication<br>
system such as the UMTS (universal mobile telecommunications system)<br>
developed by 3GPP. Nonetheless, the present invention can be also adopted<br>
for a communication system operating in conformity to a different standard.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail.<br>
The present invention proposes a method where, by allowing an RNC<br>
to manage multicast group member information by multicast services on<br>
multicast areas that the RNC itself manages, when a user terminal being<br>
currently provided with an MBMS service moves, the RNC sends information on<br>
the movement of the terminal to a core network. Preferably, the information on<br>
the movement of the terminal is transferred to a multicast group managing entity<br>
of the core network which can be one of an SGSN, a BM-SC and a GGSN.<br>
In addition, the present invention proposes a method for selectively<br>
notifying the core network of information on movement of a user terminal by the<br>
RNC. That is, the RNC notifies the multicast group entity of the core network of<br>
the movement of the terminal for an effective of a network resource only when<br>
the number of multicast group members managed by itself changes according<br>
to the movement of the terminal between the multicast areas.<br>
In general, when a multicast service is provided, there may be several<br>
types of services related to one multicast group or there may be several<br>
multicast groups for one multicast service.<br><br>
In the present invention, the logical structure as shown in Figure 4 is<br>
defined for the concept of the multicast service and multicast areas to which the<br>
multicast service is provided. That is, the entire multicast area is classified by<br>
services, groups and RNCs. This classification can be defined by a member<br>
managing entity (i.e., SGSN, BM-SC and GGSN, etc.) of the core network or in<br>
the UTRAN in the future. Each RNC manages multicast group member<br>
information by multicast services on the multicast areas after receiving them<br>
from the multicast group managing entity of the core network.<br>
Figure 4 shows an example of three types of multicast services, that is,<br>
first to third services SER1-SER3.<br>
As shown in Figure 4, a multicast group may exist for each of the<br>
services SER1-SER3. Namely, the first service SER1 is provided to both the<br>
multicast groups (A and B), the second service SER2 is provided only to the<br>
multicast group A, while the third service SER3 is provided to the multicast<br>
group B. The multicast group A includes multicast areas of MA1, MA2, MA4 and<br>
MA7, while the multicast group B includes multicast groups of MA3, MA5, MA6,<br>
MAS and MA9.<br>
With such a logical structure, in spite of the same multicast service, a<br>
QoS and a transmission content (MBMS data) may differ according to the<br>
multicast group and the multicast area. Preferably, the multicast areas<br>
MA1~MA9 are mapped geographically. For instance, in consideration of the<br>
geographical area, the first RNC manages an area corresponding to the<br>
multicast areas MA1, MA4 and MA7, the second RNC manages an area<br><br>
corresponding to the multicast areas MA2, MA5 and MA8, and the third RNC<br>
manages an area corresponding to the multicast areas MA3, MA6 and MA9.<br>
The service should be differently provided in accordance with each area.<br>
As shown in Figure 5, the first service SER1 is provided in all multicast areas<br>
MA1-MA9. However, the second service SER2 is provided in only multicast<br>
areas MA1, MA2, MA4 and MA7 and the third service SER3 can be provided in<br>
only multicast areas MA3, MA5, MA6, MA8 and MA9. Accordingly, a terminal<br>
belonging to the multicast areas MA1, MA2, MA4 and MA7 can be provided with<br>
the first service SER1 or second service SER2 by joining the multicast group A,<br>
while a terminal belonging to the multicast areas MA3, MA5, MA6A MA 8 and<br>
MA9 can be provided with the first service SER2 or third service SER3 by<br>
joining the multicast group B.<br>
In general, the RNC manages movement of a user terminal between<br>
cells. Thus, in order to provide the multicast service, the multicast areas<br>
MA1~MA9 should be mapped by cells, the geographical areas. In such a case,<br>
one multicast area may include one or more cells, and the entire MBMS service<br>
area may include one or more multicast areas MA. In consideration of the<br>
geographical area (cell), the first RNC manages a cell corresponding to the<br>
multicast areas MA1, MA4 and MA7, the second RNC manages a cell<br>
corresponding to the multicast areas MA2, MA5 and MA8, and the third RNC<br>
manages a cell corresponding to the multicast areas MA3, MA6 and MA9.<br>
Movement types of the user terminal when the multicast services with<br>
the logical structure as shown in Figure 4 are provided can be expressed as<br><br>
follows.<br>
The first type is that a terminal belongs to the same multicast area MA<br>
which provides the same service and moves to a cell managed by the same<br>
RNC. For instance, the terminal moves from a cell belonging to MA4 to a<br>
different cell belonging to the MA4.<br>
The second type is that a terminal belongs to a different multicast area<br>
MA which provides the same service and moves to a cell managed by the same<br>
RNC. Fror instance, the terminal moves from a cell belonging to MA1 to a cell<br>
belonging to the MA4.<br>
The third type is that a terminal belongs to a different multicast area MA<br>
which provides the same service and moves to a cell managed by a different<br>
RNC. For instance, the terminal moves from a cell belonging to MA1 to a cell<br>
belonging to MA2.<br>
The fourth type is that a terminal belongs to a different multicast area<br>
MA which provides a different service and moves to a cell managed by the<br>
same RNC. For instance, the terminal moves from a cell belonging to MA2 to a<br>
cell belonging to MA5.<br>
The fifth type is that a terminal belongs to a different multicast area MA<br>
which provides a difference service and moves to a cell managed by a different<br>
RNC. For instance, the terminal moves from a cell belonging to MA2 to a cell<br>
belonging to MA3.<br>
According to the movement type of the terminal, the RNC needs to<br>
provide the MBMS member managing entity (e.g., one of SGSN, BM-SC,<br><br>
GGSN) with the movement information of the terminal. The reason is because if<br>
the terminal being currently provided with the MBMS service moves to a<br>
different MA where the same service is not provided, the MBMS member<br>
managing entity needs to update the MBMS group member information and<br>
reset an MBMS service area. Besides, that is to prevent unnecessary<br>
transmission of a multicast data from the MBMS member managing entity to the<br>
RNC where there is no user terminal any longer, and especially, to prevent<br>
charging unnecessarily the terminal which has not been provided with the<br>
service.<br>
In this respect, the MBMS member managing entity of the core network<br>
does not need to know every movement of the cell units of the terminal. Thus,<br>
the RNC manages members by services for the MBMS service area for the<br>
cells managed by itself, the MBMS multicast area and the multicast area<br>
managed by itself, based on which the RNC gives information provided it<br>
satisfies a specific condition to the MBMS member managing entity, rather than<br>
giving every movement information of terminals.<br>
In detail, the RNC does not always provide information on the first and<br>
second movements out of the five types movement examples to the MBMS<br>
member managing entity but provides movement information of a<br>
corresponding terminal to the MBMS member managing entity only if the same<br>
service is not supported between MAs, if the number of service users exceeds a<br>
predetermined number in spite of the fact that the same service is supported<br>
between the MAs, or if a QoS or a content of information is different between<br><br>
MAs.<br>
Figure 5 is a flow chart of a method for managing a multicast group<br>
member of a mobile communication system according to movement of a<br>
terminal in accordance with the present invention.<br>
The RNC manages the multicast group member information by<br>
multicast services on the multicast areas managed by itself and selectively<br>
informs the core network of movement of a terminal.<br>
First, when a terminal starts moving between cells (step S1), the RNC<br>
checks whether the movement of the terminal is made between cells in the<br>
same multicast area MA (step S2). If the terminal is moved between cells in the<br>
same MAs, the RNC does not inform the MBMS member managing entity of the<br>
movement of the terminal, simply updates the multicast group member<br>
information that the RNC itself manages, and provides a multicast service to the<br>
terminal (step S3). That is, it's the first type of the five movement cases, where<br>
the movement of the terminals is not informed to the multicast group managing<br>
entity.<br>
In the second step (step S2), if the terminal movement is not made<br>
between cells in the same MA, the RNC checks whether the MA to which the<br>
terminal has moved (referred to as 'destination MA', hereinafter) is an MA<br>
managed by itself (step S4). If the destination MA is not one the RNC itself<br>
manages, since the number of group members is changed, the RNC updates<br>
the multicast group member information that the RNC itself manages, and<br>
notifies the multicast group managing entity of the movement of the terminal<br><br>
(UE) (step S7).<br>
If the terminal movement is made between the cells in the MA that the<br>
RNC itself manages, the RNC checks whether the same multicast service is<br>
supported in the two MAs and whether the number of multicast users exceeds a<br>
predetermined number in the destination MA (step S5). If the condition of the<br>
step S5 is satisfied, the RNC checks whether the QoS or the content of the<br>
information are the same between the MAs (step S6). If the conditions of the<br>
steps S5 and S6 are all satisfied, the RNC does not notify the multicast group<br>
managing entity of the movement of the terminal and performs the operation of<br>
the step S3.<br>
If, however, the condition of the step S5 is not satisfied or if the<br>
condition of the step S5 is satisfied but the condition of the step S6 is not<br>
satisfied, the RNC updates the multicast group member information and notifies<br>
the multicast group managing entity of the movement of the terminal (UE) (step<br>
S7).<br>
That is, in the case of the second type of terminal's movement, the RNC<br>
notifies the multicast group managing entity of the terminal's movement only<br>
when a specific condition is satisfied. Meanwhile, in the case of the third to fifth<br>
types of terminal's movement, the RNC necessarily notifies the multicast group<br>
managing entity of the terminal's movement.<br>
Thereafter, the RNC checks whether the destination MA supports the<br>
same multicast service and the number of corresponding service users exceed<br>
a predetermined number (step S8). In addition, the RNC checks whether the<br><br>
QoS or the content of information are the same between the MAs. If the number<br>
of service users exceeds the predetermined number or if the QoS or the content<br>
of information is not the same between the MAs, the RNC interrupts the<br>
multicast service to the terminal, or resets a fresh multicast group and updates<br>
the multicast group information of the multicast group managing entity (step S9).<br>
If, however, the number of service users does not exceed the<br>
predetermined number and the QoS or the content of information is the same<br>
between the MAs, the RNC keeps providing the multicast service to the terminal<br>
which is located in the destination MA and updates the multicast group<br>
information of the multicast group managing entity with the multicast group<br>
information updated in the step S7 (step S11).<br>
Then, the multicast group managing entity controls the MBMS data<br>
transmitted to the terminal through the RNC on the basis of the updated<br>
multicast group information such that, for example, the MBMS data is not<br>
transmitted to an RNC where there is no terminal.<br>
As so far described, the method for managing a multicast group of a<br>
mobile communication system of the present invention has the many<br>
advantages.<br>
That is, first, since the RNC notifies the core network of the terminal's<br>
movement selectively on the basis of the multicast group member information<br>
by multicast services on the multicast area, the network resource can be<br>
effectively used, and especially, unnecessary transmission of terminal's<br>
movement information from the RNC to the multicast group managing entity of<br><br>
the core network can be prevented.<br>
In addition, since the RNC judges as to whether a service can be<br>
supported in the destination multicast area on the basis of the number of<br>
service users, the MBMS member managing entity is prevented from<br>
unnecessarily transmitting a multicast data to an RNC which does not have a<br>
terminal to be managed, and especially, the RNC can provide the multicast<br>
service continuously to the terminal belonging to the destination multicast area.<br>
The foregoing embodiments and advantages are merely exemplary and<br>
are not to be construed as limiting the present invention. The present teaching<br>
can be readily applied to other types of apparatuses. The description of the<br>
present invention is intended to be illustrative, and not to limit the scope of the<br>
claims. Many alternatives, modifications, and variations will be apparent to<br>
those skilled in the art. In the claims, means-plus-function clauses are intended<br>
to cover the structure described herein as performing the recited function and<br>
not only structural equivalents but also equivalent structures.<br><br>

supports the MBMS service, the RNC updates the multicast group information of<br>
the core network.<br><br>
A multicast service of a 3GPP Universal Mobile Telecommunications<br>
System (UMTS) is disclosed. By allowing an RNC to manage multicast group<br>
member information by multicast services on multicast areas, when a user<br>
terminal being currently provided with an MBMS service moves, the RNC sends<br>
information on the movement of the terminal to a core network. Since the RNC<br>
notifies the core network of the terminal's movement selectively on the basis of<br>
the multicast group member information by multicast services on the multicast<br>
area, the network resource can be effectively used, and especially, unnecessary<br>
transmission of terminal's movement information from the RNC to the multicast<br>
group managing entity of the core network can be prevented.</td>
