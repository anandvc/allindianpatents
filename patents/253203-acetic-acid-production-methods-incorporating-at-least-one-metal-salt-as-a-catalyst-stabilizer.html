ACETIC ACID PRODUCTION METHODS INCORPORATING	<br>
AT LEAST ONE METAL SALT AS A CATALYST STABILIZER	<br>
FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE<br>
[0001] This relates to processes for the production of acetic acid using rhodium-<br>
based catalyst systems.<br>
BACKGROUND INFORMATION<br>
[0002] Large volumes of commercial acetic acid are produced by carbonylation of an<br>
alkyl alcohol, especially methanol, and reactive derivatives thereof, with carbon monoxide in a<br>
liquid reaction mixture. Such carbonylation reactions are generally carried out in the presence<br>
of a catalyst, often a Group VIII metal catalyst such as rhodium and iridium, a halogen<br>
containing catalyst promoter, such as methyl iodide, and water. U.S. Patent 3,769,329 to Paulik<br>
et al. discloses the use of a rhodium-based carbonylation catalyst dissolved, or otherwise<br>
dispersed, in a liquid reaction mixture or supported on an inert solid, along with a halogen-<br>
containing catalyst promoter as exemplified by methyl iodide. U.S. Patent 3,769,329 to Paulik<br>
et al. discloses that water may be added to the reaction mixture to exert a beneficial effect upon<br>
the reaction rate, and water concentrations greater than 14 wt.% of the reaction mixture are<br>
typically used. This is sometimes referred to as the "high water" carbonylation process.<br>
[0003] An alternative to the "high water" carbonylation process is the "low water"<br>
carbonylation process, as described in U.S. Patents 5,001,259 to Smith et al.; 5,026,908 to Di<br>
Gioacchino et al.; and 5,144,068 to Smith et al. Water concentrations in the reaction mixture of<br>
14 wt. % and lower may be used in the "low water" carbonylation process. Employing a low<br>
water concentration simplifies downstream processing of the desired carboxylic acid to its<br>
glacial form. The more water there is in a reaction stream, the greater the operating costs to<br>
remove water from the product acetic acid and the greater the capital investment in product<br>
recovery and purification equipment. The efficiencies achieved when operating at very low<br>
water concentrations makes it attractive to operate at the lowest water concentration possible.<br>
[0004] However, while reducing the reactor mixture water concentration may<br>
minimize operating and fixed costs, it is more difficult to maintain catalyst stability and activity,<br>
as explained in U.S. Patents 5,001,259 to Smith et al.; 5,026,908 to Di Gioacchino et al; and<br>
5,144,068 to Smith et al. In low water acetic acid production, especially in processes using<br>
rhodium-based catalysts, the catalyst metals tend to precipitate out of the reaction mixture.<br>
Catalyst precipitation is frequently experienced in product recovery systems, especially flasher<br>
units. Significant catalyst precipitation may lead to catalyst loss, reduced reaction rates,<br><br>
interrupted unit operation, and complete shutdowns. It is known that catalyst stability problems<br>
may be minimized by the use of a catalyst stabilizer such as a soluble metal iodide or quaternary<br>
iodide salt. As discussed in U.S. Patents 5,001,259. to Smith et al.; 5,026,908 to Di Gioacchino<br>
et al; and 5,144,068 to Smith et al, especially suitable salts are alkali metal iodides such as<br>
lithium iodide since these are the most soluble and thermally stable in the reaction mixture. EP-<br>
A-0 161 874 to Smith et al. describes a reaction system in which methanol, is carbonylated to a<br>
carboxylic acid derivative such as acetic acid while using a liquid reaction mixture having low<br>
water content. The disclosure describes that this is achieved by the use of defined<br>
concentrations of an iodide salt, alkyl iodide and corresponding alkyl ester in the liquid reaction<br>
mixture to maintain rhodium catalyst stability and system productivity. EP 0 506 240 B1 to<br>
Watson discloses the introduction of one or more iodides of Group IA and IIA elements or<br>
hydrogen iodide into the flasher zone of an acetic acid recovery system. The introduction of the<br>
iodides is said to suppress the volatility of water relative to the acetic acid to aid in the recovery<br>
of the acetic acid.<br>
[0005] Several patent references disclose the use of ruthenium, osmium, cadmium,<br>
mercury, zinc, gallium, indium, and tungsten for use as promoters in iridium catalyst systems.<br>
See, U.S. Patent 5,510,524 to Garland et al.; EP 728 726 Al to Garland et al.; EP 752 406 Al to<br>
Baker et al.; EP 849 249 Al to Ditzel et al.; and EP 849 250 Al to Williams. Similarly, U.S.<br>
Patents 6,458,996 to Muskett; 6,472,558 to Key et al.; and 6,686,500 to Watt and EP 643 034<br>
Al to Garland et al. mention the use of ruthenium and osmium as promoters for iridium catalyst<br>
systems. U.S. Published Patent Application 2004/0122257 to Cheung et al. discloses the use of<br>
salts of ruthenium, tungsten, osmium, nickel, cobalt, platinum, palladium, manganese, titanium,<br>
vanadium, copper, aluminum, tin, and antimony as catalyst co-promoters with rhodium catalyst<br>
systems in acetic acid production systems having less than 2 wt.% water. U.S. Patent 5,760,279<br>
to Poole discloses the incorporation of a manganese stabilizer in conjunction with a rhodium<br>
catalyst. U.S. Patents 4,433,166 to Singleton et al. and 4,433,165 to Singleton and EP 0 055618<br>
to Singleton et al. disclose the use of tin as a rhodium catalyst system stabilizer used in high<br>
water carbonylation processes. The English language abstract of the publication entitled<br>
Stabilization of Stannous Chloride for Rhodium Complexes Catalyst, Journal of Xiamen<br>
University (Natural Science) Vol. 25 No 4 at pg. 488(July 1986) also discloses the use of tin as a<br>
rhodium catalyst system stabilizer. The use of tin as a rhodium catalyst system stabilizer over<br>
certain temperature and pressure ranges is disclosed in the publication Zong, Xuezhang, et. al,<br>
The Thermal Stability of Rh(I) Complex Catalyst In The Carbonylation of Methanol To Acetic<br>
Acid, Southwest Res. Inst. Chem. Ind., Naxi, Peop. Rep. China. Cuihua Xuebao (1982), 3 (2),<br><br>
110-16. CODEN: THHPD3 ISSN: 0253-9837. None of the references that disclose the use of<br>
ruthenium or tin as a rhodium catalyst system stabilizer or promoter disclose also the<br>
incorporation of the stabilizer in a low water system including an iodide ion, provided by an<br>
iodide salt, at concentrations of greater than 3 wt.% of the reaction mixture.<br>
[0006] EP 0 728 727 B1 to Poole et al. and equivalent U.S. Patent 5,939,585 to<br>
Ditzel et al. disclose the use of ruthenium or osmium as a catalyst promoter to enhance<br>
production rates in combination with alkyl halide such as methyl iodide for the production or<br>
carboxylic anhydrides and acetic acid. The patent discloses that when carboxylic anhydrides are<br>
being produced, the iodide co-promoter may be selected as N,N' dimethyl imidazolium iodide or<br>
lithium iodide preferably present at concentrations up to its limit of solubility, for example 30<br>
wt.% lithium iodide. However, when acetic acid is produced, the references disclose that the<br>
iodide co-promoter may be lithium iodide but it should only be present at concentrations of less<br>
than 3 wt.% lithium iodide. Such co-promoters will reduce the formation of volatile promoter<br>
species and thereby facilitate product recovery and purification. There is no mention of the use<br>
of lithium iodide as a stabilizer but only as a suppressant of volatility. However, the references<br>
note that the ruthenium or osmium promoters act as stabilizers for the rhodium catalyst at low<br>
partial pressures of carbon monoxide. Experiment "X" of EP 0 728 727 B1 to Poole et al.<br>
discloses 90.7% of rhodium precipitated in 23 hours without inclusion of ruthenium or osmium<br>
in an autoclave system. Example 33 of EP 0 728 727 Bl to Poole et al. discloses that inclusion<br>
of 20 molar equivalents of ruthenium trichloride hydrate per rhodium carbonyl chloride dimmer<br>
in the autoclave system reduced rhodium precipitation to 55.6% of rhodium from the solution.<br>
[0007] Experiment H of EP 0 728 727 B1 to Poole et al. notes that the addition of<br>
lithium iodide to a reaction mixture for the production of acetic acid does not allow the reaction<br>
to remain constant. Therefore, as noted in Experiment H, ruthenium or osmium was not added<br>
to a reaction mixture containing lithium iodide. Presumably, because of the perceived rate<br>
destabilizing effects of lithium iodide in combination with low water conditions, EP 0 728 727<br>
Bl to Poole et al. advises that when the ruthenium or osmium is added in combination with<br>
lithium iodide under low water conditions, it should only be done at lithium iodide<br>
concentrations of less than 3 wt.%.<br>
[0008] The publication New Acetyls Technologies from BP Chemicals, Science and<br>
Technology in Catalysis 1999, M.J. Howard, et al., pp. 61-68 reports "a non-commercial<br>
example" of, as described in EP 0 728 727 Bl to Poole et al. which is referenced in the<br>
publication, the use of ruthenium as a promoter to increase reaction rates in low water<br><br>
carbonylation systems using a rhodium catalyst. The use of another promoter, such as an iodide<br>
salt promoter, as a catalyst stabilizer, is not disclosed.<br>
[0009] Published PCT Applications WO 2004/101487 to Gaemers et al. and WO<br>
2004/101488 to Gaemers et al. discloses processes for production of acetic acid using rhodium<br>
and iridium metals coordinated with a polydentate ligand as catalyst systems. The published<br>
applications disclose the systems incorporating ruthenium, osmium, rhenium, cadmium,<br>
' mercury, zinc, gallium, indium, and tungsten compounds as promoters. Molar ratios of the<br>
promoter to the rhodium or iridium of 0.1:1 to 20:1 are disclosed. Alkyl halide co-promoters are<br>
also disclosed. Additionally, water concentrations of 0.1 wt.% to 10 wt.% are disclosed.<br>
Finally, the published applications indicate that "an effective amount" of a stabilizer and/or<br>
promoter compound selected from alkali metal iodides, alkaline earth metal iodides, metal<br>
complexes capable of generating iodide ions, and salts capable of generating iodide ions may be<br>
incorporated. No specific information regarding the concentration of the "effective amount" is<br>
provided. The term "effective amount" is considered to refer to the iodide concentrations<br>
disclosed in the representative art as suitable for use in conjunction with ruthenium and tin<br>
compound promoters. In other words, iodide salt concentrations of less than 3 wt.% are<br>
considered to represent an effective amount of the iodide compounds.<br>
[0010] In summary, certain references disclose the use of various rathenium and tin<br>
compounds as catalyst promoters and/or stabilizers. However, these references also disclose that<br>
the ruthenium and tin promoters and/or stabilizers are to be used only in systems incorporating<br>
low levels of iodide salt catalyst co-promoters or in the complete absence of iodide salt co-<br>
promoters. <br>

SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE<br>
[0013] This disclosure relates to processes for the production of acetic acid by<br>
carbonylation of alkyl alcohols, reactive derivatives of alkyl alcohols, and mixtures of alkyl<br>
alcohols and reactive derivatives thereof in the presence of a rhodium-based catalyst system in<br>
conjunction with a halogen promoter, and an iodide salt co-promoter at an iodide concentration<br><br>
equivalent to greater than 3 wt.%, in reaction mixtures having water concentrations of .1 wt.% to<br>
14 wt.%. The processes incorporate at least one of a ruthenium salt, a tin salt, or mixtures<br>
thereof in the reaction mixture as a catalyst stabilizer. The concentration levels of the iodide salt<br>
co-promoter described herein are higher than conventionally considered feasible for use in<br>
connection with stabilizers or promoters such as ruthenium and tin compounds.<br>
[0014] The at least one ruthenium salt, tin salt, or mixtures thereof stabilize the<br>
rhodium-based catalyst system and minimize precipitation of rhodium during recovery of the<br>
acetic acid product, particularly in flasher units in an acetic acid recovery scheme. Stability of<br>
the rhodium-based catalyst system is achieved even when acetic acid is produced in low water<br>
content reaction mixtures. The stabilizing metal salts may be present in the reaction mixtures<br>
for the production of acetic acid at molar concentrations of metal to rhodium of about 0.1:1 to<br>
20:1. The metal salt stabilizers may be combined with other catalyst stabilizers as well as<br>
catalyst promoters.<br>
DETAILED DISCLOSURE<br>
[0015] This disclosure relates to processes for producing acetic acid by carbonylation<br>
of alkyl alcohols, reactive derivatives of alkyl alcohols, and mixtures thereof. In particular, this<br>
disclosure relates to such carbonylation processes taking place at water concentrations of about<br>
0.1 wt.% to about 14 wt.% of the reaction mixture in which the carbonylation reaction takes<br>
place. Furthermore, the processes described herein relate to carbonylation reactions catalyzed<br>
by rhodium-based-catalyst systems in the presence of a halogen catalyst promoter, and an iodide<br>
salt catalyst co-promoter at an iodide concentration equivalent to greater than about 3 wt.% in<br>
the reaction mixture. Finally, the processes described herein incorporate at least one ruthenium<br>
salt, at least one tin salt, or mixtures thereof in the reaction mixture to stabilize the rhodium-<br>
based catalyst systems incorporating the halogen promoter and the iodide salt catalyst co-<br>
promoter.<br>
[0016] An important aspect of the processes described herein is the improved<br>
catalyst stability provided by the unique combination of the halogen catalyst promoter, the<br>
iodide salt co-promoter, and the ruthenium and/or tin salt stabilizer used in a low water<br>
carbonylation environment. In this unique combination the iodide salt co-promoter is present at<br>
a concentrations of greater than about 3 wt.% in the reaction mixture. In particular, the<br>
concentration of the iodide salt co-promoter described herein is higher than iodide salt co-<br>
promoters concentrations previously thought to be suitable for use in conjunction with<br>
ruthenium and/or tin stabilizers or promoters. It is the combination of these three components in<br><br>
a low water environment with the iodide salt co-promoter present at the described concentrations<br>
that provides unexpected enhanced catalyst stability.<br>
[0017] In certain embodiments, the water concentrations in the reaction mixtures in<br>
the processes described herein are from about 1 wt.% to 14 wt.%. In certain other embodiments,<br>
the water concentrations in the reaction mixtures in the processes described herein are from<br>
about 1 wt.% to about 8 wt.%. In other embodiments, the water concentrations in the reaction<br>
mixtures in the processes described herein are from about 1 wt.% to about 6 wt.%. In still other<br>
embodiments, the water concentrations in the reaction mixtures in the processes described herein<br>
are from about 1 wt.% to about 4 wt.%.<br>
[0018] The incorporation of at least one of the metal salts in the reaction mixture<br>
reduces the tendency of rhodium in the rhodium-based catalyst system to precipitate out of<br>
solution during the production and purification of acetic acid. Rhodium compounds are<br>
particularly susceptible to instability leading to precipitation of the rhodium catalyst as RhI3<br>
during recovery of acetic acid, particularly in the flasher unit. Rhodium is a very expensive<br>
metal and loss of the metal through precipitation may have significant negative financial impact<br>
on commercial acetic acid production processes by affecting catalyst usage and maintenance of<br>
high production.<br>
[0019] Although, as discussed above, the use of ruthenium and tin as catalyst<br>
promoters or stabilizers in certain systems is known, none of the known systems disclose the use<br>
of ruthenium or tin as rhodium catalyst stabilizers in combination with a halogen promoter and<br>
high iodide salt co-promoter concentrations, as defined herein, under low water conditions. The<br>
processes described herein recognize that this unique combination of carbonylation system<br>
components provides significant stability to rhodium-based catalyst systems.<br>
As discussed, the processes described herein relate to the use of rhodium-based catalyst<br>
systems. For purposes of this disclosure, a "rhodium-based catalyst system" or "rhodium-based<br>
catalyst" means a catalyst system providing a rhodium metal concentration in a methanol<br>
carbonylation reaction mixture of at least 300 ppm!<br>
[0020] In certain embodiments, the rhodium-based catalyst systems described herein<br>
provide from about 300 ppm to about 5,000 ppm of rhodium in the reaction mixture. In other<br>
embodiments, the rhodium-based catalyst systems described herein provide from about 1,000<br>
ppm to about 4,000 ppm of rhodium in the reaction mixture. In still other embodiments, the<br>
rhodium-based catalyst systems described herein provide from about 2,000 ppm to about 3,000<br>
ppm of rhodium in the reaction mixture. In certain embodiments, the rhodium concentration in<br>
the reaction mixture is at least 1000 ppm. In other embodiments, the rhodium concentration in<br><br>
the reaction mixture is at least 1500 ppm. In still other embodiments, the rhodium concentration<br>
in the reaction mixture is at least 2000 ppm.<br>
[0021] In addition to rhodium, the reaction mixtures of the processes described<br>
herein also include a halogen promoter, such as a hydrogen iodide or organic iodide and an<br>
iodide salt co-promoter. In certain embodiments, the organic iodide is an alkyl iodide such as<br>
methyl iodide. The halogen promoter may be present in the reaction mixture at a concentration<br>
of about 2.0 wt.% to about 30 wt.%. In other embodiments, the halogen promoter is present at a<br>
concentration in the reaction mixture of about 5.0 wt.% to about 15 wt.%. In still another<br>
embodiments, the halogen promoter is present in the reaction mixture at a concentration of about<br>
5 wt.% to about 10 wt.%.<br>
[0022] The iodide salt co-promoter used in the reaction mixtures of the processes<br>
described herein may be in the form of a soluble salt of an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal or<br>
a quaternary ammonium or phosphonium salt. In certain embodiments, the catalyst co-promoter<br>
is lithium iodide, lithium acetate, or mixtures thereof. The salt co-promoter may be added as a<br>
non-iodide salt that will generate an iodide salt. The iodide catalyst stabilizer may be introduced<br>
directly into the reaction system. Alternatively, the iodide salt may be generated in-situ since<br>
under the operating conditions of the reaction system, a wide range of non-iodide salt precursors<br>
will react with methyl iodide to generate the corresponding co-promoter iodide salt stabilizer.<br>
For additional detail regarding iodide salt generation, see U.S. Patents 5,001,259 to Smith et al.;<br>
5,026,908 to Di Gioacchino et al; and 5,144,068 to Smith et al.<br>
[0023] The concentration of the co-promoter is such that it generates an iodide ion<br>
concentration in the reaction mixture of greater than about 3 wt.%. In still other embodiments,<br>
the concentration of the co-promoter is such that it generates an iodide ion concentration in the<br>
reaction mixture of about 4 wt.% to about 20 wt.%. In additional embodiments, the<br>
concentration of the co-promoter is such that it generates an iodide ion concentration in the<br>
reaction mixture of about 5.0 wt.% to about 20 wt.%. In other embodiments, the concentration<br>
of the co-promoter is such that it generates an iodide ion concentration in the reaction mixture of<br>
about 10 wt.%o to about 20 wt.%. In still other embodiments, the concentration of the co-<br>
promoter is such that it generates an iodide ion concentration in the reaction mixture of about 5<br>
wt.% to about 10 wt.%.<br>
[0024] As discussed above, the reaction mixtures of the processes disclosed herein<br>
also incorporate at least one ruthenium salt, at least one tin salt, or mixtures thereof in the<br>
reaction mixture to stabilize the rhodium-based catalyst systems. The stabilizing metal salts<br>
may be present in the reaction mixtures at molar concentrations of metal to rhodium of about<br><br>
0.1:1 to about 20:1. In other embodiments, the stabilizing metal salts may be present in the<br>
reaction mixtures at molar concentrations of total metals to rhodium of about 0.5:1 to about<br>
10:1. In still other embodiments, the stabilizing metal salts may be present in the reaction<br>
mixtures at molar concentrations of total metals to rhodium of 1:1 to 5:1.<br>
[0025] Exemplary, but not exclusive, ruthenium and tin salts suitable for use as<br>
catalyst stabilizers as described herein include halide, acetate, nitrate, oxide, and ammonium<br>
salts of ruthenium and tin.<br>
.[0026] It should be noted that once in the reaction mixture, the ruthenium and tin<br>
salts are converted to at least one form of an iodide salt, an acetate salt, or mixtures thereof.<br>
Therefore, the identity of the ruthenium or tin salts added to the reaction mixture to stabilize the<br>
rhodium metal may vary. For purposes of this disclosure, references to the concentration or<br>
molar ratios of the ruthenium and tin salts refers to the total of all forms of the ruthenium and tin<br>
salts, regardless of whether a particular salt is an iodide salt, an acetate salt, or mixtures of iodide<br>
and acetate salts. For molar ratios, the molar ratio of the ruthenium or tin is, of course, governed<br>
by the concentration of the respective metal, regardless of the form in which it exists.<br>
[0027] To provide carbonylation reactions as described herein, all selected reaction<br>
mixture components are dissolved or dispersed in the reaction mixture vessel or reactor. During<br>
a period of active reaction, methanol and carbon monoxide are continuously fed to the reactor<br>
containing a reaction mixture in which a desired partial pressure of carbon monoxide is<br>
maintained. The carbonylation reactor is typically a stirred autoclave within which the reacting<br>
liquid components are maintained at a constant level. Into the reactor, there are continuously<br>
introduced fresh methanol, sufficient water to maintain the desired concentration of water in the<br>
reaction medium, recycled catalyst solution from the flasher base, and typically recycled methyl<br>
iodide and methyl acetate from an overhead of the methyl iodide-acetic acid splitter column. In<br>
certain embodiments, the methyl acetate is maintained in the reaction mixture at a concentration<br>
of about 0.5 wt.% to about 30 wt.%. Alternate distillation systems can be employed so long as a<br>
means is provided for recovering the crude acetic acid and recycling to the reactor catalyst<br>
solution, methyl iodide, and methyl acetate. Carbon monoxide is continuously introduced into<br>
the reactor just below the agitator which is used to stir the contents. The carbon monoxide is<br>
thoroughly dispersed through the reaction mixture. A gaseous purge stream is vented from the<br>
head of the reactor to prevent buildup of gaseous by-products and to maintain a set carbon<br>
monoxide partial pressure at a given total reactor pressure. The temperature of the reactor is<br>
controlled, and the carbon monoxide is introduced at a rate sufficient to maintain a constant total<br><br>
reactor pressure. The total reactor pressure is from about 1.5 MPa to about 4.5 MPa absolute,<br>
with the reaction temperature typically maintained from about 150° C to about 250° C.<br>
[0028] Liquid product is drawn off the carbonylation reactor at a rate sufficient to<br>
maintain a constant level of the reaction mixture and is introduced to a flasher ,unit. In the<br>
flasher unit, a catalyst solution is withdrawn as a base stream incorporating predominantly acetic<br>
acid containing rhodium catalyst, the iodide salt co-promoter, and the ruthenium and/or tin<br>
stabilizer, along with lesser quantities of methyl acetate, the halogen promoter, and water. An<br>
overhead stream from the flasher comprises predominately product acetic acid along with<br>
methyl iodide, methyl acetate, and water. A portion of the carbon monoxide along with gaseous<br>
by-products such as methane, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide exit the top of the flasher. For<br>

[0029] As discussed above, rhodium catalyst precipitation is frequently experienced<br>
in product recovery systems, especially flasher units. The benefits of the systems described<br>
herein in reducing rhodium catalyst precipitation are exemplified by the following experimental<br>
evaluations.<br>
Experimental Evaluations<br>
[0030] Rhodium catalyst stability experiments were conducted under a nitrogen (N2)<br>
atmosphere in sealed pressure glass tubes. The sealed pressure glass tubes are equipped with<br>
controlled temperature and stirring using a pressure tube reactor system made by Genevac (RS<br>
1000 Reaction Station). Stock rhodium catalyst solutions incorporating 1,500 ppm to 2,000 ppm<br>
Rh, containing 15 wt.% lithium iodide (Lil) in an approximately 2 wt.% to 4 wt.% aqueous<br>
acetic acid medium were prepared in a Fisher-Porter glass apparatus. The stock solutions were<br>
purged with carbon monoxide (CO) at 125° to 150° C and a pressure of 241.1 kPa with stirring<br>
for one hour to ensure complete dissolution of the rhodium catalyst complex before conducting<br>
catalyst precipitation tests. The prepared catalyst solutions were cooled and then purged with N2<br>
for one hour to remove dissolved CO before placing the catalyst solutions into glass tubes which<br>
are sealed under a N2 atmosphere. These solutions simulate the CO partial pressure in the<br><br>
flasher unit. The rhodium concentration for the stock solution and the test solutions were<br>
determined by atomic absorption (AA) spectroscopy.<br>
[0031] Three types of the catalyst solutions were prepared as outlined above. The<br>
first type of solution was a control solution without a ruthenium or tin stabilizer and 15 wt.%<br>
lithium iodide. A second type solution contained 15 wt.% lithium iodide and a ruthenium salt<br>
added as RuI2 at a molar ratio of ruthenium to rhodium of 5:1. A third type of solution included<br>
15 wt.% lithium iodide and a tin salt added as SnI2 at molar ratios of tin to rhodium of 10:1.<br>
[0032] The prepared solution were maintained for 72 hours in the sealed glass tubes<br>
at conditions simulating flasher conditions, at temperature of 150° C and 241.1 kPa under a N2<br>
atmosphere. Rhodium concentrations in each solution were determined at 24 hours, 48 hours,<br>
and 72 hours intervals.<br>
[0033] Two solutions containing a ruthenium stabilizer were tested simultaneously<br>
with a control solution that contained no ruthenium or tin stabilizer. The rhodium concentration<br>
of the ruthenium containing solutions and the control solutions existing at the outlined time<br>
intervals over time are reported in numerical and graphical forms in FIG. 1.<br>
[0034] Two solutions containing the tin stabilizer were tested simultaneously with a<br>
control solution that contained no ruthenium or tin. The rhodium concentration of each tin<br>
containing solution and the control solutions existing at the outlined time intervals over time are<br>
reported in numerical and graphical forms in FIG. 2.<br>
[0035] With reference to FIG. 1 and FIG. 2, it was observed that the presence of the<br>
ruthenium and tin salts in the rhodium catalyst solutions significantly reduced the rate of RhI3<br>
precipitation over time. In particular, it is seen that in the solutions in which no ruthenium or tin<br>
salt was present, approximately 50 wt.% to 70 wt.% of the soluble Rh precipitated as RhI3 by the<br>
end of each 72 hour period. It is observed that in the solutions incorporating ruthenium and tin<br>
salts, no significant RhI3 precipitation occurred over the 72 hour periods.<br>
[0036] Comparing the results reported in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2, discussed above, to the<br>
stabilization results reported in EP 0 728 727 Bl to Poole et al. in experiment X and example 33,<br>
it is seen that the systems described herein incorporating an iodide ion at concentrations greater<br>
than about 3 wt.% in combination with ruthenium or tin exhibited dramatically better<br>
stabilization than the systems incorporating ruthenium without an iodide ion as reported in EP 0<br>
728 727 Bl to Poole et al.<br>
[0037] With respect to the various ranges set forth herein, any upper limit recited<br>
may, of course, be combined with any lower limit for selected sub-ranges.<br><br>

ABSTRACT<br><br>
ACETIC ACID PRODUCTION METHODS INCORPORATING AT LEAST ONE<br>
METAL SALT AS A CARTALYST STABILIZER<br>
Processes for the production of acetic acid by carbonylation of methanol, and reactive derivatives<br>
thereof, in a reaction mixture using a rhodium-based catalysts system with at least one metal salt<br>
catalyst stabilizer selected from the group of ruthenium salts, tin salts, and mixtures thereof are<br>
provided. The metal salt stabilizers minimize precipitation of the rhodium metal during recovery<br>
of the acetic acid product particularly in flasher units in an acetic acid recovery scheme. Stability<br>
of the rhodium metal is achieved even when the acetic acid is produced in low water content<br>
reaction mixtures in the presence of an iodide salt co-promoter at a concentration that generated<br>
an iodide ion concentration of greater than abour 3 wt.% of the reaction mixture. The stabilizing<br>
metal salts may be present in the reaction mixtures for the production of acetic acid at molar<br>
concentrations of metal to rhodium of about 0.1:1 to about 20:1. The stabilizing metal salts may<br>
be combined with other catalyst stabilizers as well catalyst promoters.</td>
