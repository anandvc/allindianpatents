				<td>The present invention relates to a turbo-charging system with integral assisting electric motor.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention is directed to internal combustion engine exhaust gas-driven turbochargers and particularly to the use of an integral electric motor to boost output at low exhaust gas volume .<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In order to increase the power output of an internal combustion engine of a particular displacement volume, additional air can be supplied by compressing the air by means of a turbocharger. Additional air permits the burning of more fuel to produce increased power output.<br>
At very low engine speed such as, for example, at low idle, there is insufficient exhaust gas energy to drive the turbocharger fast enough to produce significant levels of boost.  Consequently, there is an appreciable lag time between opening of the engine throttle and when the turbocharger is running fast enough to produce enough boost pressure to eliminate smoke on acceleration.  Fuel control devices, such as rack limiters or aneroid controls, are employed to limit the amount of fuel delivered to the engine cylinders until the turbocharger is capable of delivering sufficient air to produce smoke-free combustion.  These fuel limiting devices cause slower response to throttle opening and a sluggishness in engine and vehicle response.<br>
There is need for boosting the output of an exhaust gas-driven turbocharger during those times when an increase in engine output power is required.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In order to aid in understanding this invention, it<br>
can be stated in essentially summary form that it is directed to an exhaust gas-driven turbocharger which has an integral electric motor to maintain compressor speed at low exhaust gas flow rates in order to supply sufficient engine air to eliminate uncombusted hydrocarbons and exhaust smoke and to boost power early in the acceleration mode. The invention includes structure to limit the upper temperatures of the motor and to limit heat flow to the motor.<br>
It is an aspect of this invention to supply power to a turbocharger which is driven by exhaust gas expansion by including an integrated motor to supply torque to aid in rotating the shaft in the same direction as exhaust gas expansion.<br>
It is a further aspect of this invention to provide an exhaust gas-driven turbocharger with an internal electric motor with provisions to cool the motor so as to limit motor temperature during and after operation.<br>
It is a further aspect this invention to provide thermal insulation between the exhaust gas turbine and the electric motor to limit heat flow from the exhaust gas turbine to the electric motor both during operation and subsequent to operation.<br>
It is another aspect of this invention to provide an exhaust gas-driven compressor with air flow in a direction from the internal motor to the exhaust gas turbine to remove heat from the structure around the electric motor. The features of the present 'invention which are believed to be novel are set forth with particularity in the appended claims.  The present invention, both as to its organization and manner of operation, together with further objects and advantages thereof,  may be best understood by reference to the following description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>

an electric motor mounted in said housing between said bearings, said electric motor having a rotor mounted on said shaft and a stator fixed in said housing; means for energizing said electric motor for maintaining rotation of said shaft at a preselected minimum speed, even though insufficient exhaust gas is supplied to the turbine to maintain such preselected minimum speed, such minimum speed being preselected to provide charge air to an engine over and above that amount of charge air which could be provided by the exhaust gas turbine alone; and<br>
means for passing fluid through said opening through said shaft even when said shaft is not rotating to remove heat from said rotor of said motor.<br>
Accordingly, there is also provided that a turbo-charging system comprising:<br>
a housing, said housing having a first end and a second end, said housing having a shaft extending therethrough, first and second spaced bearings mounted in said housing, said shaft extending through said bearings so that said shaft is rotatably mounted on said bearings, said shaft extending out of both said first and said second ends of said housing, said shaft having an opening therethrough from said first end to said second end;<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
FIGURE 1 is a longitudinal section through the gas driven turbocharger, and through the bearing and motor housing, showing the internal electric motor positioned between the bearings in the bearing housing.<br>
FIGURE 2 is an enlarged transverse section taken generally along line 2-2 of FIGURE 1.<br>
FIGURE 3 is an enlarged detail of the motor and its surrounding structure.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
The turbo-charging system of this invention is generally indicated at 10 in FIGURE 1. The gas turbine 12 and the air charging compressor 14 are mostly shown in a longitudinal section on the center line of their connecting shaft 16. The gas turbine has an inlet scroll 18 which is connected to receive the exhaust gas from an internal combustion engine, such as a diesel engine. Impeller 20 is mounted on shaft 16 and expands the exhaust gas. The waste exhaust gas is exhausted out of exhaust pipe 22. The impeller 20 imparts torgue to the shaft 16 and rotates the shaft.<br>
At the other end of the shaft, air intake 24 receives air from the outside after passing through an air filter or the like, which removes the'larger physical contaminants. The air intake 24 is part of the turbocharger, which includes scroll 26. Compressor impeller 28 is mounted on shaft 16 and rotates therewith. The rotation of the compressor impeller compresses the intake air which is delivered by the scroll, sometimes through an inter-cooling heat exchanger, to the internal combustion engine.<br>
A bearing and motor housing, indicated generally at 30, is a divided housing, as seen in FIGURE 2, for ease of assembly of the internal parts. However, housing 30 is shown in section in FIGURE 1 for clarity of illustration. Bearing 32 and bearing 34 embrace the shaft 16 substantially at the ends of the bearing housing 30. It is desirable that the bearings be spaced as far apart as possible to provide shaft stability. In addition to supporting the bearings, both the compressor scroll 26 and.<br><br><br><br><br>
