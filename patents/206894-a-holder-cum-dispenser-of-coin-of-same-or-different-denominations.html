				<td>The present invention relates to a  holder - cum - dispenser of coins of same or different denominations More particularly, thus invention pertains to a  coin dispenser - cum -holder, in which coins of same or varying denominations can be so arranged that they can be inserted or taken out without having to resort to cumbr ous counting of individual coins.<br>
Heretofore, handling of coins of different denominations from the shop / sales counter by sales people necessitated handling of coins in isolation and counting them individually, which was not only time consuming, but was also cumbrous and prone to personal error<br>
The principal object of this present invention is to provide a  coin holder - cum -dispenser<br>
A further object of this present invention is to provide a set of coin holder - cum - dispenser wherein the coins are housed in grooves of pre - determined dimensions so that definite number of coins may be housed in said grooves<br>
A still further object of this present invention is to provide a  coin holder - cum -dispenser wherein the said grooves are in staggered configurations such that one set of coin arranged in a particular groove does not hinder other coins from being put in or taken out<br>
Another object of this present invention is to provide a  coin holder - cum - dispenser wherein the groove dimensions are so designed as to hold coins in an integral whole number, preferably more than two, or modules of suitable multiples of 5 (five) or 10 (ten)<br>
Yet another object of this present invention is to provide a housing or holder for said dispenser which may be operated manually or may be spring actuated, wherein a series of dispenser holding coins of different denominations may be arranged for convenient insertion or taking out of said coins<br>
The foregoing objects are achieved by the present invention which relates to a  coin holder - cum - dispenser wherein a plurality of grooves of predetermined dimensions are provided in staggered configuration for effecting insertion or withdrawal of coins.<br>
For facilitating operation of the device of this invention, it has been found preferable if the said device is made slightly slanting, the farther side being a little elevated for the operator to get a better view and quicker computation<br>
The grooves of this dispenser may be suitably marked indicating the dimensions and number of coins held therein. This serves as a ready reckoner while withdrawing the coins from the groove, too.<br>
The materials of construction of the novel dispenser may be selected from any suitable object, strength, durability, scratch - resistance, light - weightedness and easy workability being the main criteria Polymeric materials like polystyrene, HDPE, polyolefins, copolymers, fibreglass and glass or light metals or alloys may be conveniently used to fabricate the coin holder - cum - dispenser of this invention<br>
This invention also encompasses within its scope a holder for the novel dispensers wherein the said dispensers may be suitably arranged for holding coins of specific denominations and the entire arrangement may be used as a system which has not been envisaged hithertobefore.<br>
2<br><br>
According to this invention, there is provided a holder-cum-dispenser of coins of same or different denominations, characterized in that the said dispenser has slots or recesses for holding coins of definite denominations and a lower curved portion which enables the dispenser to be placed in a slanted manner affording the operator/user a better view of the contents, and wherein the lower surface of the said slot or recess, the wider side of the top surface of the dispenser giving the same staggered configuration and the side wall of the dispenser.<br>
2A<br><br>
The present invention will now be more particularly described and illustrated with the help of the drawings accompanying the provisional specification showing a preferred embodiment thereof, in which.<br>
Fig 1 represents the top plan of the novel coin holder - cum - dispenser of the present invention.<br>
Fig 2 shows the section view from " A', as indicated in Fig 1,<br>
Fig 3 shows the view of the dispenser at section' G - G", as indicated in Fig 1,<br>
Fig 4 shows the sectional view of the slot or recess of the dispenser at "G - G " with reference to Fig 3,<br>
fig 5 is the perspective view of the slot or recess showing the actual configuration thereof, -drawn along section at" P-P", at appearing in,Fig 1 and<br>
Fig 6 is the bottom view of the novel coin holder - cum - dispenserwnen viewed from "B'as<br>
shown in Fig. 5.<br>
In Fig 1 showing the top plan of the novel dispenser, the staggered configuration of the slots or recesses will be dearly evident, wherein (1 ) is the main body of the dispenser, { 2 ) and ( 3 ) are the slots or recesses in which coins of definite denominations can be held The width of the recesses can be so made as to be capable of holding specific number of coins of particular denomination ( s ) A set of such grooves may be suitably marked to indicate the coin denominations from which rt will be easy to calculate and / or determine the amount introduced or withdrawn<br>
Fig 2 depicts the side view of the dispenser along section" A", as shown in Fig 1 in which ( 2 ) and { 3 ) have the same significance as above and ( 4 ) denotes the lower curved portion of the dispenser which enables the dispenser to be placed in a slanted manner affording the operator / user to get a better view of the contents<br>
Fig 3 showing view along section " G - G " of Fig. 1 illustrates the disposition of the groove - cum - holder for the coin in which (1 ) is the main body, ( 5 ) is the tower surface of the recess, ( 6 ) is the wider side of the top surface of the dispenser, giving the same a staggered configuration and (7) is the side wall of the dispenser<br>
Fig 4 showing the sectional view of the dispenser along "G - G " as in Fig. 3 has numerals (5) and (7) having the same significance as given above<br>
Fig 5 showing view along sectional fine " F - F " of Fig. 1 has numerals { 5 ), { 6 ), ( 7 ) and ( 8 ), the last two representing the wider and narrower surfaces, respectively, adjacent the staggered recesses for holding coins<br>
Fig 6 gives the bottom view of the dispenser when observed from " B " of Fig 5, in which (1 ), (2) and (3) have the same significance as given in connection with Fig 1<br>
The present invention also includes within its scope an arrangement for holding a plurality of devices which when taken as a whole can be used as a" system"<br>
The individual device may be earmarked for holding coins of specific denominations For instance, separate devices may be used for corns of say, 25p, 50p, Re1, Rs 2, Rs 5 and so on<br>
3<br><br>
However, the device may be so designed that coins of different denominations may be housed in the same device beanng sutable indicative markings The novel device may also be adapted to hold coins of different currencies, such as, for instance. Euro coins of different denominations<br>
The shape and size of the device may be suitably altered from the usual configuration to surt specific needs. For instance, the dispenser may be of round, semi - circular or quasi - elliptical n shape with suitably placed grooves and markings thereon The dispenser may be suspended from a suitable holding device or may be mounted on a turnstile with manual or powered rotation or indexing around 360 °. In case of round - shaped device, the grooves or coin - slots may be made a Iittle slanted, with the horizontal, for obtaining a better view. The groove or slot dimensions also may be altered to accommodate coins of different denominations and dimensional characteristics<br>
It has to be borne in mind that the dimension of the device is not critical, convenience of handling and operation being of utmost importance however, ease of insertion and withdrawal of coins are two other aspects which are to be borne in mind while forming the grooves Hence it would be preferable if individual holders are provided for coins of a specific denomination as the coins are of varying shapes, sizes and configuration. In case the size and configuration of the coins are varied or altered, the groove size may be altered accordingly<br>
While the invention has been described in detail and with specific embodiments thereof, it will<br>
be apparent to one skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be made therein without deviating or departing from the spirit and scope of the invention Thus the disclosure contained herein includes within its ambit obvious equivalents and substitutes as well.<br>
Having the invention in detail with particular reference to the drawings accompanying the provisional specification, it will now be more specifically defined by means of the claims appended hereinafter.<br>
