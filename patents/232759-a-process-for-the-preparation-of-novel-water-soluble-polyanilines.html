				<td>This invention relates to a process for the preparation of novel water-soluble polyanilincs in its conducting form. More particularly it relates to a process for the preparation of water soluble polyanilines in its conducting form, known as the emeraidine salt form or optionally polyaniline in the base form which is non-conducting that can be converted into conductive form by the use of conventional dopants. The polyanilines prepared by the process of this invention have general formula 1 in the drawing accompanying this specification wherein R1 /R2 /R3 /R4 = H or CH3 or C2H5 and Rx is alkyl sulphonate or sulphate group with x = 1-12.<br>
Polyaniline is different from other conjugated polymers in the sense that it can be doped to a conducting form without changing the number of pi- electrons through protonation by exposure to an appropriate protonic acid in an aqueous solution. However, the conductive form of polyaniline is difficult to be processed because it is insoluble in common organic solvents and is unstable at the melt processing temperatures. These factors limit its applications. Therefore the synthesis of soluble polyaniline is of great interest since the formation of a soluble material is essential to facilitate post synthesis processing. The polyaniline family of compounds is considered as the most attractive polymeric material, due to their environmental stability, their well-behaved electrochemistry, electrochromism, moderately high conductivity on doping, low cost of raw materials and ease of synthesis. It can exist in several molecular forms, differing in chemical compositions, structures and electrical<br><br>
conductivity. All these forms can be interconverted into each other by chemical or electrochemical oxidation.<br>
The development of synthetic methodology to get soluble polyaniline is of great interest because of the advantages offered by the material in post-synthesis processing.<br>
There are three possible methods for improving the processibility of polyanilines:<br>
1. Preparation of polyaniline dispersions; however, the Polyaniline dispersions reported so far precipitate rapidly, thus limiting the storage stability of the material.<br>
2.	Prefunctionalisation of the starting monomer with a suitable group prior to<br>
polymerisation. The products obtained were found to be intractable in the<br>
acid form and can be made soluble only by converting it into the non-<br>
conductive base form.<br>
3.	Formation of the polymer salt using an acid functionalised by a large non-<br>
polar substituent known as counterion induced processibility. The research<br>
so far carried out using this method introduced polyanilines soluble in<br>
organic solvents<br><br>
The emeraldine salt forms of polyanilines are usually insoluble in aqueous and most of the common organic solvents.<br>
There are no reports of soluble polyanilines in the conducting form and the process for the preparation of soluble polyanilines as described and claimed by the process of this invention is reported for the first time.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of novel water soluble polyanilines in its conducting form, known as the emeraldine salt form or optionally polyaniline in the base form which is non-conducting that can be converted into conductive form by the use of conventional dopants, to overcome the main drawback of insolubility of polyaniline, in its conducting form, namely the emeraldine salt, in aqueous systems.<br>
Another object is to provide a process for the preparation of water-soluble polyaniline using alkyl and alkyl aryl sulphuric and sulphonic acids as the protonating agent, which have solubilising surfactant properties.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide a process wherein the synthesised soluble emeraldine salt is a very clear green aqueous solution which can be diluted to any extent retaining the characteristics of polyaniline.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the<br><br>
preparation of water-soluble polyaniline with increased storage stability. Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of novel water soluble polyanilines in its conducting form, or optionally polyaniline in the base form which is non-conducting that can be converted into conductive form by the use of conventional dopants, which comprises polymerisation of aromatic amines in the presence of an acid, in aqueous medium, in the presence of in oxidising agent at a temperature in the range of 0°C to 60°C, for a period ranging between 2 to 24 hours, collecting the resultant product in the form of an aqueous solution, subjecting the aqueous'solution of the product to dialysis against water for 1 to 2 weeks to obtain the water soluble polyaniline of formula 1 in the drawing accompanying this specification wherein R1 /R2 /R3 /R4 = H or CH3 or C2H5 and Rx is alkyl sulphonate or sulphate group with x = 1-12. or optionally treat with a base to obtain the product in the non-conducting form.<br>

The conversion of n- nomine sulphonatcs to n-nonanc sulphonic acid was carried out by running through a cation ion exchange column of Amberlite -120.<br>
20.92 grams of n- nonane sulphonic acid were dissolved in 50 mL of deionised water. To this 4.65 mL of aniline was added and mixed thoroughly to obtain a clear solution. 18.9 grams of ammonium dichromate was added to this mixture and stirred to dissolve the ammonium dichromate. The reaction was allowed to proceed at 35°C for 12 hours. The product obtained was a clear green solution, purified by dialysis with semipermeable membrane (Spectra/Por3 membrane, molecular weight cut off 3500) in deionised water. The deionised water was changed frequently over a period of 9 days. The product obtained was polyaniline as emeraldine salt solubilised in water. The yield obtained was lOOgrams.<br>
Optionally the emeraldine salt form can be converted into a base, which is nonconducting, by treatment with 0.2 molar potassium hydroxide solution.<br>
Example 16<br>
The conversion of n- decane sulphonates to n-decane sulphonic acid was<br>
carried out by running through a cation ion exchange column of Amberlite -<br>
120.<br>
27.32 grams of n- decane sulphonic acid were dissolved in 50.mL of deionised<br>
water. To this 4.65 mL of m-toludine was added and mixed thoroughly to<br><br>
dcioniscd water. To this 6.97 mL of 2,5-dimcthyl aniline was added and mixed thoroughly to obtain a clear solution. 24 grams of potassium iodate was added to this mixture and stirred to effect dissolution of potassium iodate. The reaction was allowed to proceed at 20°C in an ice bath for 3 hours. The product<br><br>
obtained was aclear green solution, purified by dialysis with semipermeable membrane (Spectra/Por3 membrane, molecular weight cut off 3500) in deionised water. The deionised water was changed frequently over a period of 12 days. The product obtained was polyaniline as emeraldine salt solubilised in water. The yield obtained was 150 grams.<br>
Optionally the emeraldine salt form can be converted into a base, which is nonconducting, by treatment with 0.1 molar ammonia solution.<br>
Example 13<br>
The conversion of n- heptane sulfonates to n-heptane sulphonic acid was carried out by running through a cation ion exchange column of Amberlite -120.<br>
27.2 grams of n-heptane sulphonic acid were dissolved in 75 mL of deionised water. To this 6.97 mL of aniline was added and mixed thoroughly to obtain a clear solution. 22.2 grams of sodium iodate was then added and stirred to effect the dissolution of sodium iodate and the reaction mixture was maintained at 10°C in an ice bath for 5 hours. The product obtained was a clear green solution, purified by dialysis with semipermeable membrane (Spectra/Por3 membrane, molecular weight cut off 3500) in deionised water. The deionised<br><br>
emeraldine salt solubilised in water. The yield obtained was 100 grams. Optionally the emeraldine salt form can be converted into a base, which is nonconducting, by treatment with 0.3 molar sodium hydroxide solution.<br>
The advantages offered by the process of the invention are :<br>
The products obtained as per the process of this invention meet the requirement for the use as a soluble form of poly aniline.<br>
The polyaniline solution can be diluted to any extent and is stable over a long period of time.<br>
The base form of the polyaniline obtained (in the non-conducting form) was found to be soluble in many common organic solvents facilitating post synthesis processing. It could be converted into the conducting form by use of conventional dopants.<br>
The polyaniline prepared can be easily processed to films and other forms in aqueous system.<br>
The film processed can be used as a permanently doped one. The dedoping and redoping processes can be done effectively.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br></td>
