				<td>This  invenion  relates  to  a  very  fast  direct  acting pneumatically assisted solenoid controlled  valve  for  control of flow of liquid. PRIOR ART<br>
Presently there are two types of solenoid controlled vlves.<br>
a)	Indirect type: Pressurized liquid or air which is the<br>
motive force to move the piston or diaphragm of the valve is<br>
controlled by a small port fitted with a valve actuated by the<br>
solenoid coil.<br>
b)	Direct acting type: In this type the port is much larger<br>
and therefore the action of the valve is comparatively much<br>
faster.<br>
There are disadvantages associated with the present types of solenoid valves.<br>
The main disadvantages associated with the present Indirect type solenoid controlled valve is that because of small size of the port, the operation of the valve is comparatively slow.<br>
Another disadvantages associated with the present direct type solenoid controlled valve in that a much larger solenoid coil is required so that the valve is bulkier, more expensive and requires a higher operating current. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore the main object of the present invention of a direct acting pneumatically assisted solenoid controlled valve is to achieve even faster valve action than is presently possible with direct acting type.<br><br>
Another object of the present invention of a direct acting pneumatically assisted solenoid controlled valve in which the size of the solenoid coil is considerably reduced by using a separate compressed air motive power source.<br>
Yet another object cf the present invention of a direct acting pneumatically assisted solenoid controlled valve which is compact and requires lower operating current and cheaper.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a very fast direct acting pneumatically assisted solenoid controlled Valve comprising a valve body having an inlet at one end and an outlet at the other end, said valve body is provided with an opening/closing port for seating of a valve connected to a rod, the other end of said rod is connected to a piston disposed movably in a chamber, characterized in that said chamber is provided with a port at the top and a compressed air supply, a solenoid coil around a magnetic block is provided at the top of said chamber disposed with a corresponding port communicating with said port of the chamber, lower end of said magnetic block is provided with a cylinder with a shuttle disposed operatively to move up and down to close either the port of the magneic block or the port at the bottom opening to the atmosphere.<br>
The nature of the invention, its objective and further advantages residing in the same will be apparent from the following description made with reference to non-limiting exemplary embodiments of the invention represented in the accompanying drawings.<br>
-3-<br><br>
4 BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS:<br>
Figure 1 shows the sectional elevation of the valve of the invention in closed position;<br>
Figure 2 shows the sectional elevation of the valve of the invention in process of opening.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
Accordingly there is provided an improved direct-acting type pneumatically assisted solenoid controlled valve comprising a valve body having an inlet and an outlet for entry and exist of a liquid being controlled; a rod having a valve at one end and a piston being movable in a chamber disposed above the valve body; a valve port configured on said valve being openable and closable by means of a biasing member; a first inlet port for supply of compressed air via a second port and a third port respectively to a shuttle and to the chamber; a hollow cylinder interposed in a block, the block being disposed above the chamber; a solenoid coil is provided which when energised causes a reciprocating movement of the shuttle within the hollow cylinder thereby forcing the valve to open up for allowing flow of the liquid, and in that said solenoid coil when de-energised causes the compressed air to act on the piston thereby closing down the valve.<br><br>
4A<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
The valve body (3) has an inlet (1) through which the liquid enters and exists from the outlet (2) at the other end. There is a valve closing port (9) disposed at the upper portion of the valve body (3). The valve (5) as shown in Figure 1 is seating on the closing port (9). The valve at the other end is connected to a rod (4) of a piston (6). The piston (6) can move in a chamber (7).<br>
Compressed air supply is provided at (10) and the flow of compressed air is indicated by an arrow marked 'A'. The compressed air flows through the magnetic block (12) and then to a cylinder (14) to the chamber (7) via a port (15). The compressed air applied against the top of the piston (6) which keeps the valve (5) closed by seating against the port (9).<br><br>
The closing of the valve (5) against the port (9) can further be assisted by proiding a spring (8) between the valve (5) and bottom of the chamber (7) body.<br>
A shuttle (13) is provided inside the cylinder  (14) which is free to move up and down in the cylinder (14).<br>
A solenoid coil  (11) is provided over the magnetic block<br>
(12)	so that when switched on the solenoid coil (11) magnetises<br>
the magnetic  block (12) which pulls the shuttle (13) to close<br>
the air supply and pressure on top of the piston (6) and liqui,d<br>
under pressure enters through ports (17) pushes the piston (6)<br>
up and open the valve (5).<br>
DETAILED OPERATION OF THE VALVE<br>
Valve is normally closed (Fig. 1), compressed air enters at (10) through port (18) and passes through passage in shuttle<br>
(13)	and through port (15)  into chamber  (7) where it acts as<br>
a force on piston (6) keeping valve (5) on it's seat and closing<br>
port (9).<br>
To open valve solenoid coil is energised (Fig, 2). Coil magnetises block (12) which pulls shuttle (13) to top of cylinder (14). This uncovers port (16) allowing compressed air in chamber (7) to escape via ports (15) and (16) to atmosphere. As pressure is reduced in chamber (7) the force acting on upper side of piston (6) reduces and force acting on lower side through liquid<br>
-5-<br><br>
pressure flowing through ports (17) increases and forces the piston up the chamber thus lifting valve (5) off it's a seat and allowing liquid to flow through the valve (1 to 2 through 9).<br>
The invention described hereinabove is in relation to non-limiting embodiments and as defined by the accompanying claims.<br>
-6-<br><br>
